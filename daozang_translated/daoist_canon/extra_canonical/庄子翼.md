*Zhuangzi Yi (Wings of Zhuangzi)*

**Abstract**

We, your ministers, respectfully note: *Zhuangzi Yi* comprises eight juan, with *Zhuangzi Quewu* (Omissions and Errors in the Zhuangzi) appended as one juan and supplementary materials as another, compiled by Jiao Hong of the Ming dynasty during the *wuzǐ* year of the Wanli era. Its structure mirrors that of his *Laozi Yi*. The preface lists twenty-two commentaries from Guo Xiang’s annotation onward, sixteen supplementary expositions from Zhi Dun onward, and eleven works on chapter divisions, phonology, and exegesis from Guo Xiang onward. Upon examination, only the works of Guo Xiang, Lü Huìqīng, Chǔ Bóxīu, Luó Miǎnxué, and Lù Xīxīng are cited extensively; the rest appear sporadically, serving merely to round out the roster of commentators.

It is further noted that Chǔ’s *Yihai* (Sea of Meanings) cites Wang Pang’s annotations on the Inner Chapters and Liu Gai’s on the Outer Chapters. The *Daoist Canon* additionally contains Wang Pang’s *Xinzhuan* (New Transmission) in fourteen juan—perhaps his earlier and later annotations differed, warranting their parallel inclusion? Here, only the congruent passages are incorporated, with the *Xinzhuàn* distinguished accordingly. Yet upon inspection, no separate "Pang annotations" exist beyond the *Xinzhuàn*. The *Yangsheng Zhu* (Maintaining Life) chapter cites one passage from Liu Gai, suggesting his commentary also covered the Inner Chapters—a perplexing inconsistency. Ming scholars, fond of parading erudition, often prove hollow upon scrutiny. Such was the intellectual climate of the Wanli era and beyond, rendering deeper inquiry futile.

Zhi Dun’s *Zhuangzi* commentary is unattested in earlier histories. His exegesis on the *Xiaoyaoyou* (Free and Easy Wandering) chapter, originally cited in Liu Xiaobiao’s commentary to *Shishuo Xinyu*, is here misattributed entirely to "Zhi Daolin’s annotations"—a sleight of hand typical of Ming scholars, unworthy of credence. Nevertheless, among Ming polymaths since Yang Shen, none surpassed Jiao Hong in breadth. Though tainted by Li Zhi’s heterodoxy—blurring Confucian and Mohist boundaries with errant arguments—he remained vigilant against Buddhist and Daoist excesses. Thus, his selections often capture Zhuangzi’s intent: while heterodox from a Confucian standpoint, they remain true to the Daoist tradition. Judged by its own standards, this work surpasses vulgar commentaries in scholarly rigor.

The appended *Zhuangzi Quewu* reproduces Chen Jingyuan’s *Nanhua Jing Jie* (Exegesis of the *Nanhua Jing*) in full, offering valuable reference material. The supplementary juan includes:
- Sima Qian’s *Biographies of Zhuangzi* and Ruan Ji
- Wang Anshi’s *On Zhuangzi*
- Su Shi’s *Record of the Zhuangzi Shrine*
- Pan You’s *Miscellaneous Writings on Parting with Wang Pang*
- Li Shibiao’s *Nine Discourses on Zhuangzi*

The *Song History: Bibliography* records Li Shibiao’s *Ten Discourses on Zhuangzi* in one juan; here, only nine survive, the reason unclear. Moreover, three of these discourses—*Jie Niu* (Dissecting the Ox), *Huzi*, and *Hao Liang* (The Hao River)—are already incorporated in the main text, yet reproduced in full at the end. Such inconsistency suggests hasty compilation without thorough revision.

Respectfully submitted in the eighth month of the forty-third year of the Qianlong reign.

**Original Preface to the *Zhuangzi***

In the late Zhou, Laozi composed his book in two chapters, illuminating the meaning of Dao and virtue. His disciples included Guan Yinzi, Yang Zhu, Lie Yukou, Geng Cang, and Zhuang Zhou. Among these, only Yang Zhu left no writings. The *Liezi* emerged in the late Jin; its authenticity is suspect, likely padded with passages from the *Zhuangzi*. Thus, Sima Qian’s *Records of the Historian* omits Liezi’s biography. The *Geng Cangzi*, compiled by Wang Shiyuan of the Tang, and the *Guan Yinzi*—filled with infantile incantations and clay-idol sorcery—were absent in Laozi’s time, clearly later fabrications by Daoist adepts.

The *Zhuangzi* originally comprised fifty-three chapters; thirty-three survive today. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters contain dubious passages, but the Inner Chapters are unmistakably the work of Master Meng of Song. Thus, among Laozi’s disciples, only Zhuangzi’s writings endure.

Having compiled *Laozi Yi* in several juan, I turned to *Zhuangzi* commentaries, selecting the most congruent for this work, which I also title *Zhuangzi Yi*. Laozi and Zhuangzi relate as Confucius and Mencius do: Laozi and Confucius were contemporaries, as were Zhuangzi and Mencius. Confucius and Mencius never attacked Laozi or Zhuangzi. Yet scholars today clamor incessantly—why? Perhaps because Confucian teachings elaborate the "manifest" (*you*), while Lao-Zhuang texts expound the "latent" (*wu*), their divergence lying therein.

Alas! Confucius and Mencius did not neglect the *wu*; it is implicit in the *you*. They merely guided people from what was familiar—what is called "learning the lower to reach the higher." Laozi and Zhuangzi, witnessing how Confucian scholars remained confined to the *you* and few attained enlightenment, sought to transcend this limitation. Thus, they...

Having attained the *wu*, one may then employ the *you*—thus taking what was previously omitted and elaborating upon it, that it might nearly serve to supplement what Confucius and Mencius left incomplete. As for such matters as benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—Confucius and Mencius have already expounded upon them at length. Why should I redundantly reiterate them? This, indeed, was the refined intent of Laozi and Zhuangzi, not their invention of some lofty doctrine. Otherwise, "that which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the implement"—this is the very teaching of Confucius and Mencius. Now, if one merely substitutes *Dao* and *implement* with *you* and *wu*, or inverts *above* and *below* into *subtle* and *wondrous*, the words differ, yet their meaning remains the same. To let the difference in words obscure the sameness of intent is but the self-inflicted malady of those who attack them—how could it ever harm Laozi and Zhuangzi?

Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, and Zhuangzi all lamented that scholars had strayed from their true nature, and so they composed writings to awaken them. Yet instead of returning to their nature, they clamor endlessly over distinctions of similarity and difference—such matters are beyond my comprehension.

*Reading the Zhuangzi* [seven entries, recorded in *Literary Jottings*]

The *Zhuangzi* is a work that illuminates the Dao. The Confucians speak of the Dao yet do not depart from benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music; Zhuangzi, however, severs and discards them—one might suspect this is inconsistent. Yet even tiles, shards, husks, and chaff are none other than the wondrous Dao. Why then would benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music alone be excluded from its purview? Clearly, this does not accord with Master Zhuang’s intent.

Why is this so? Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music *are* the Dao—but what the worldly Confucians call benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are merely its traces. Clinging to these traces without understanding their origin, how can the Dao be made manifest? Thus, Zhuangzi had no choice but to cast them aside, that others might come to know the Dao.

This is like establishing images first, then transcending their constraints—only then can one realize that what one formerly grasped was of no true substance. Perhaps then one may advance and seek the Dao in earnest.

If one seeks and truly grasps it, one then realizes that images are none other than reality, and constraints are none other than principle—thus, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music need not be cast aside and abandoned. As Zhuangzi himself said: *"That which is distant yet cannot but be dwelled in is righteousness; that which is moderated yet cannot but be accumulated is ritual."* Scholars recognize one aspect but fail to see the other—how far they are from comprehending his words!

Laozi and Zhuangzi spoke extensively of the principle of emptiness and nothingness, not to abolish the teachings of the world, but because emptiness and nothingness are the very foundation upon which worldly teachings stand. Those who perceive only things cannot govern things, while those who perceive nothingness are sufficient to order being. Thus, the Dao is established in the constant alternation of non-being and being—otherwise, how could the sage’s work bring about transformation, enact change, and traverse the realms of ghosts and spirits? Yet if one demands of them a mind entangled in worldly clamor, how could they possibly succeed?

Laozi said: *"Hold to the ancient Dao to govern present being."* If what is called "present being" exists, then the ancient must have been non-being—this much is clear. To govern being, one must draw from non-being. How, then, can it be said that emptiness and nothingness abolish worldly teachings?

Thus, Shun’s *"governing through non-action"* was not a failure to govern, but governing through non-action. Yu’s *"acting without affairs"* was not a failure to act, but acting through non-affairs. Yet the benighted have come to equate pure discourse with the abandonment of affairs, as the scholars of the Jin and Song did—how far they have strayed!

Zhuangzi said: *"Water that is unmixed remains clear; when undisturbed, it is level. But if it is stagnant and blocked, it cannot become clear."* To mistake the abandonment of affairs for non-action is to stagnate and block it—how could it ever be as clear as water?

Sima Qian claimed that Zhuangzi *"slandered Confucius,"* and the world’s Confucians have largely echoed this view. Only Su Zizhan argued that *"in truth, he affirmed Confucius, though in form he did not."* Ah! Zizhan’s judgment truly grasped the marrow. Yet the world’s Confucians, ensnared by surface words, have never penetrated to its essence—how could they understand what Zizhan meant?

For what the world’s Confucians cling to are but the traces of Confucius, the dregs and husks. What Zhuangzi discussed was his essence. It is like Bian Que, who saw through walls to the five viscera and devised prescriptions. Two students learned from him: one could not see the viscera or diagnose illness, yet rigidly adhered to his teacher’s prescriptions; the other, like Bian Que, saw through walls to the viscera and composed prescriptions not necessarily derived from his teacher. Which would Bian Que have praised—the one who guarded his formulas, or the one who devised his own based on insight?

The Buddhist teachings on repaying kindness hold that those who revile the Buddha and curse the patriarchs are truly repaying their debt. If reviling and cursing are repayment, then those who take refuge and offer praise must be doubly indebted—yet who understands that reviling and cursing are the highest form of refuge and praise? Otherwise, when Qin Yi mourned Lao Dan, or when Zhuangzi wandered through the chestnut grove, were these not also acts of slander against Lao Dan and self-reproach? How could such interpretations be justified?

The *Records of the Grand Historian* states that Zhuangzi was contemporary with King Hui of Liang and King Xuan of Qi—yet in his writings, Wei Ying is none other than King Hui of Liang. It further claims that Zhuangzi debated Confucianism with Duke Ai of Lu, which would place him in the same era as Confucius. Though Sunshu Ao served as minister to King Zhuang of Chu before Confucius was born, and Yi Liao never held office in Chu, the text speaks of Confucius’s journey to Chu, where the people of Chu toasted him while Sunshu Ao stood holding the goblet and Yi Liao received the wine to offer libation. Such contradictions abound. Scholars have long questioned these discrepancies, yet Zhuangzi himself addressed them: “Nineteen out of twenty are parables; seventeen out of twenty are reiterations.” By “parables,” he meant borrowing others’ voices to lend credence to his own intent. If the intent alone is what matters, must the events themselves be true? Sima Qian observed that figures like *Weilei Xu* and *Kangsangzi* were mere fabrications, akin to the likes of *Master Nonexistent* and *Sir Vacuous*—yet to scrutinize them by dates and months is to mistake a fool’s dream for reality.

Nevertheless, Zhuangzi’s sole concern was affirming his own intent. Even if scholars were to recognize that names are not truly names and right and wrong are not truly right and wrong, they would still be following the very teaching of Master Zhuang. Su Zizhan defended Zhuangzi’s reverence for Confucius but doubted the authenticity of the *Robber Zhi* and *Fisherman* chapters, as if they alone truly slandered Confucius. Yet the *Yielding the Throne* and *Sword* chapters are shallow and far from the Dao. Reexamining the text, one finds the parable’s conclusion in the line: “When Yang Ziju journeyed west to Qin and met Laozi, those at his lodging welcomed him—his host held the mat, his wife the towel and comb, while the other guests yielded their seats and the stove-tenders withdrew from the hearth. On his return, they vied with him for seating.” Remove the *Yielding the Throne*, *Sword*, *Fisherman*, and *Robber Zhi* chapters to align with the *Liezi* passage: “When Lie Yukou journeyed to Qi, he turned back midway, saying, ‘I am astonished! I ate at ten porridge stalls, and five served me first.’ Then he understood and laughed, ‘This is surely one and the same lesson.’” Zhuangzi’s words were not yet finished, but the ignorant cut and pasted them into their own. Thus, in his *Eulogy for Prefect Xu Jun*, he wrote of “contending seats filling the hall” and “no longer five stalls serving first,” treating them as one event. Reading the parable in *Zhuangzi* alongside the two chapters in *Liezi* brings sudden clarity.

Now, the second chapter of *Liezi* begins with the story of Liezi’s porridge stalls, immediately followed by Yang Zhu’s contending seats—precisely matching Su Zizhan’s argument. Could it be that Su’s insight arose from this very passage? Generally, the marvels of Zhuangzi’s writings cannot be muddled by later generations; the differences in style and structure are discernible at a glance. Guo Xiang remarked, “Those with partial talent recklessly interpolate strange passages, such as the *Yan Yi*, *Xiu Zhi*, *Wei Yan*, and *You Fu* chapters, along with the *Wu Zixu* section—altogether, three-tenths of the text is spurious.” The *Book of Han*’s *Treatise on Arts and Letters* lists *Zhuangzi* in fifty-three chapters, corresponding to Sima Biao and Meng’s annotations. The language is often bizarre and fantastical, resembling the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* or divination manuals, leading commentators to take liberties in selection. Only the Inner Chapters remain consistent across all editions. Was this not what Su Zizhan meant by “the ignorant”?

The *Yan Yi*, *You Fu*, and other spurious chapters no longer survive. In Cui Zhuan’s edition of *Zhuangzi*, many passages differ. For instance:
*“The *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter: ‘The blind cannot appreciate the beauty of patterns; the deaf cannot appreciate the sound of bells and drums.’ Below: ‘One without feet cannot wear embroidered slippers.’*
*The *Equalizing Things* chapter: ‘Nothing is not so; nothing is impermissible.’ Below: ‘There is what is permissible in the permissible and impermissible in the impermissible; impermissible in the impermissible yet permissible in the permissible.’*
*The *Great and Venerable Teacher* chapter: ‘Riding the eastern ridge, Mount Jiwei, he joins the ranks of the stars.’ Below: ‘Born without parents, dead he ascends to the distant. After three years, his form vanishes—this speaks of the spirit beyond naming.’*
*The *Perfect Happiness* chapter: ‘Deep in sleep, suddenly awake; sweating profusely.’ Below: ‘Laughter comes before one can respond; joy before one can arrange it. Departing, transformation enters the vastness of heaven.’*
*One version reads: ‘Meeting an opponent, laughter comes before one can respond; joy before one can arrange it. Transformation departs, entering the boundless.’ Below: ‘Not yet male, drifting and sinking; drifting and sinking, not yet divining with milfoil and turtle shell. Divining with milfoil and turtle shell, entering the flowing vastness.’*
*The *In the World* chapter: ‘Knowing that Zeng and Shi are not the vanguard of Jie and Zhi.’ Below: ‘The mutual arising of being and non-being.’”*

Then how can Zeng and Shi, Jie and Zhi, not partake of both being and non-being? How could they not mutually grind against one another? Their differences, however, often persist. The transmitted *Outer Chapters* and *Miscellaneous Pieces* contain many passages revised by Guo Xiang—could this be his doing? Or was it some other meddler who falsely altered and interpolated them thus?

In *Laozi Zhigui* by Yan Junping, references to Zhuangzi abound. He writes:
A cart, though unharmed, overturns when a child drives it; though lofty, it plummets into ravines, and a thousand men cannot right it. An egg, unbroken, may yet be shattered by a single touch; once it becomes a soaring swan, beating its wings into the clouds, nets and arrows cannot reach it. A calf, while nursing, may be restrained by a single rope; when it becomes a bull, no snare can hold it. A tiger, seizing beasts and devouring oxen and horses, cannot be challenged by sword or shield.

Thus, a trickle of water, flowing long enough, becomes a river or sea; a small snake, if it does not die, transforms into a divine dragon. Accumulated goodness leads to good fortune, while minor evils, unchecked, bring ruin.

He further says:
That which makes me *me*—is it truly me? I am like the body, yet the body is not the body; the body exists because I am present. And that which makes me *me* exists because of spirit. The spirit that abides in me is made so by the Dao.

He further says:
The Dao’s generation, Heaven’s arising—all beginnings begin from non-beginning; life lives from non-life; existence exists from non-existence; perishing perishes from non-perishing.

He further says:
When blessings arise, benefits are born, achievements are completed, affairs are accomplished, resources are prepared, and uses are brought forth, men grow vastly wealthy and the world turns extravagant and transgressive. Yet wealth and goods never suffice, and the people grow ever more depraved. Blessings fill the mountains and marshes, gold and jade pile up in heaps, but the state grows ever more unstable and the people ever fewer. Profit adorns cunning, and men deceive one another, using fraud to bind one another. They block the paths of deviance and debauchery, yet the routes of treachery and villainy grow dense. They distinguish likeness and difference, right and wrong, in ever more numerous permutations—thus the state darkens and governance declines. They devise techniques and perfect skills, carving and polishing, adorning with patterns and colors, creating strange and monstrous novelties to glorify the virtuous and distinguish the noble from the base. Craft and deceit flourish, and the extraordinary grows ever more bizarre. Decrees multiply, rewards deepen, punishments grow harsh, and penalties sever. They hack at flesh and sever limbs, yet distant kin remain estranged and close kin grow discordant. Crimes lead to extermination, rewards to enfeoffment as marquises. Heaven and Earth quake in terror, yet thieves and bandits multiply.

He further says:
To eat twice as much when hungry, to drink twice as much when thirsty, to leap into water when overheated, to enter fire when cold—though one may remove the immediate cause, the body will surely die. A mass in the chest cannot be chiseled out; a disease in the throat cannot be scraped away. Mosquitoes alighting on the face cannot be shot; lice clinging to the body cannot be hacked apart.

He further says:
The rising and setting of the sun and moon share the same light; the death and life of men share the same form. The divisions of spring and autumn share the same benefit; the sage and the rustic share the same appearance. The open-minded and the narrow-minded share the same capacity; the Daoist adept and the infant share the same achievement. In all these cases, their inner natures differ while their outward manifestations are the same—none but the sage can discern this.

He further says:
Without yin, there is no yang, and the myriad things cannot be born; without yang, there is no yin, and the myriad things cannot be completed. The Way of Heaven and Earth begins with an end and ends with a beginning.

He further says:
The infant, though ignorant, is loyal and trustworthy even to enemies; yet when grown and possessed of understanding, he deceives his elder brothers and sisters-in-law. When the army prevails, he slays captives without mercy; the beast trapped in a ravine does not flee from rhinoceros or tiger. These are not changes in principle but in the nature of things.

The above passages are not found in the extant texts. According to the *Han shu: Yiwen zhi*, the *Zhuangzi* originally comprised fifty-three chapters. Guo Xiang excised its artful and miscellaneous portions, reducing it to thirty-three chapters—thus, what remains today is but four-tenths of the original. Yan’s work predates Xiang’s, and the passages he cites must have been from the lost chapters. Su Zizhan deemed the *Rangwang*, *Yu jian*, *Dao Zhi*, and *Yufu* chapters to be spurious; Luo Miandao further suspected the *Keyi* and *Shanxing* chapters as shallow and superficial, ultimately fixing the authentic text at twenty-six chapters. Broadly speaking, the refinement or crudeness of the language clearly distinguishes them. As for the passages cited by Junping, there is no doubt they were among those excised by Xiang.

Alas! Xiang was indeed a man of keen discernment. *Qinding Siku Quanshu*

*The Wings of Zhuangzi, Volume One*
*By Jiao Hong of the Ming Dynasty*
*Inner Chapters*
*Chapter One: "Free and Easy Wandering"*
[Guo’s commentary: Though small and great differ, when they roam in the realm of self-attainment, each thing employs its nature, each affair matches its capacity—all fitting their proper place. "Free and easy" is one and the same.
*Brush Notes*: "Free and easy" was anciently written as "dissolving and swaying." Huang Jifu explained: "Dissolving" is like yang moving and ice melting—though diminished, its root is never exhausted. "Swaying" is like a boat moving on water—though in motion, its interior is never harmed. Only one who embodies the Dao can wander through the world in this way.]

In the northern darkness there is a fish, and its name is *kun*. The *kun*’s greatness—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, and its name is *peng*. The *peng*’s back—no one knows how many thousand *li* it stretches. When it rises in fury and takes flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird—when the sea surges, it will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.

*The Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. It says: When the *peng* journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, whirls on the whirlwind and ascends ninety thousand *li*, departing on the sixth-month gale. Wild horses and dust motes—

The myriad creatures are blown along by the breath of life. Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it simply so distant that it has no end? From above, the *peng* gazes downward—it sees no more than this.

[The *ming* of the Southern Darkness means "boundless and without limit," as Ji Kang notes. Dongfang Shuo’s *Record of the Ten Continents* says its waters are black, hence the name *ming*. "Clouds hanging from the sky" means clouds at the edge, vast as the heavens themselves. *Qi Xie*, Sima, and Cui all refer to individuals; Emperor Jianwen speaks of a book. The "ascending wind" is called *fuyao*. The *Erya* says *fuyao* is a whirlwind. "Wild horses" are the *qi* between heaven and earth, galloping like untamed steeds. "Dust motes" are *qi* dense and swirling, like dust stirred into the air.]

Guo’s commentary: [The reality of the *kun* and *peng* is beyond my understanding. Zhuangzi’s great intent lies in wandering freely, embracing non-action, and finding contentment. Thus, he exhausts the extremes of small and great to clarify the fittingness of one’s nature. The discerning scholar should grasp its essential message and disregard its outward form. The *kun*’s transformation into the *peng* requires the boundless sea to bear its body, and ninety thousand *li* to support its wings—this is no mere love of the strange. It is simply that great things must arise in great places, and great places must give rise to such great things. A principle that is naturally so. With wings so vast, lifting is difficult; only by riding the *fuyao* can it ascend ninety thousand *li*. Once departed, it travels for half a year before reaching the Celestial Pond to rest. "Wild horses" are wandering *qi*. The *qi* of wild horses and dust motes are what the *peng* relies upon to fly. As for the deep blue of the sky—is it truly the sky’s true color, or merely its vastness without end? From above, the *peng* gazing down at the earth is like a person on the ground looking up at the sky. It turns southward, heedless of distance, driven only by what it can bear and where it must go.]

Lü’s commentary: [Wild horses and dust motes are the breath of life by which all creatures are blown along. This *qi* fills heaven and earth without gap, and humans dwell within it. From below, gazing upward, the sky appears deep blue—is this its true color, or is it simply so distant that it has no end? We cannot know. Because we cannot know, we do not take our place as "below," so how could the *peng*, from above, know what it means to be "high"?]

Oral exposition: [The *kun* and *peng*’s transformations are but a depiction of the boundless joy within. For those who see only the small, there is endless strife. But if one knows the world contains such vastness, one’s own body seems no more than a single grain in a granary. The *kun* and *peng* are metaphors for the flight of birds. The word "fury" alone makes it extraordinary. "Sea surges" means the sea moves—even today, coastal folk songs speak of the "sixth-month sea surge." When the sea stirs, great winds arise, its waters roiling from the depths, their sound heard for *li* around. Only such winds can carry the *peng* south. *Qi Xie* records strange and extraordinary things, like the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. "Three thousand *li*" and "ninety thousand *li*" merely describe its height and distance. "Departing on the sixth-month gale" means it flies for half a year before resting. The three lines about wild horses are set here to foreshadow what follows: when people look up at the sky, they see only its deep blue. Is this its true color? Or is it merely that our vision fails, and the sky has no end, so we see only a hazy expanse? When the *peng* flies to the heavens, gazing down, the distance to the earth is incalculable. The breath that blows wild horses and dust motes must appear just as hazy, like a person below looking up at the sky. These lines simply depict how high the *peng* flies.]

Personal observations: [What must transform cannot but transform; what must fly cannot but fly—all is moved by the mechanism of heaven. The transformed do not know it themselves. "Rising in fury" expresses the inevitability of movement when compelled by *qi*, swift and forceful as if enraged. It is not anger in the sense of resentment or injustice. All things that have lain hidden for long must burst forth; all that have been coiled for long must stretch. Is this weariness with the constant or delight in change? No—it is simply that when form is great and transformation fitting, it moves with the *qi* of yin and yang, waxing and waning, growth and decline, a principle inescapable. The *Qiwu Lun* speaks of the "ten thousand hollows roaring in fury"; the *Waiwu* chapter says "plants and trees grow in fury"—this is the same idea. The *Daodejing* says, "The ten thousand things arise together." Observing this, we understand the meaning of "resting in the sixth month." People see the fury but not the rest, know the arising but not the return. Thus, they turn away from the realm of carefree wandering and rush daily into the domain of striving, becoming entangled in affairs, ensnared by troubles, exhausted and adrift, not knowing where to return. Is this not lamentable? Master Guanyin said, "Though heaven and earth are vast, they can constrain the formed but cannot constrain the formless." To escape the constraints of the two *qi*, seek it in the time before the *ming* fish took shape.]

Supplementary notes: ["Departing on the sixth-month gale" and "the myriad creatures blown along by breath" both use *xi* in the sense of *qi*. Humans breathe as *xi*; creation breathes through the four seasons. "Departing on the sixth-month gale" refers to the great winds of the sixth month, which the *peng* uses to journey south. "The myriad creatures" is simply creation, with "born" replacing "made" for freshness. "Blown along by breath" echoes Laozi’s "Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?" The various commentaries take "sixth month" as half a year and *xi* as rest, but this is because they have not considered the context.]

Moreover, when water accumulates, if it is not deep, it cannot bear a great boat.

When no force is applied to spill a cup of water upon the hall’s floor, a mustard seed may serve as its boat; yet place the cup there, and the water is too shallow for so large a vessel. If the accumulation of wind is not deep, it cannot bear great wings. Thus, only when one reaches ninety thousand *li* does the wind lie beneath—only then, borne upon the wind, with the blue sky at one’s back and no obstacle to bar the way, does one set out to journey south.

The cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at this, saying: “We burst forth in flight, striking the elm and sandalwood, yet sometimes fail to reach them and fall to the ground—what need is there to go ninety thousand *li* south?” One who travels to the outskirts need only pack three meals, and returns with belly still full; one who journeys a hundred *li* must pound grain the night before; one who travels a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. What do these two creatures know?

Small knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not dusk and dawn; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short years. South of Chu there is the *fangling* tree, for which five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the great *chun* tree, for which eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is still renowned for his longevity—how sad that common folk compare themselves to him!

The *guobao* mushroom appears plump, the *dazhi* fungus grows beneath the sky’s shade—yet if exposed to sunlight, it perishes. Yang Shen notes: "The *chaojun* was originally written as *jīqūn*; in modern Yunnan, mushrooms are called *jīzōng*—this is it." The *huìgū* is the cold cicada, born in spring and dying in summer, or born in summer and dying in autumn. Pengzu, surnamed Jiān and named Kēng, was enfeoffed at Pengcheng by Yao and lived seven hundred years into the Shang dynasty.

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
The roc soars high because its wings are vast—thus it is. A small substance requires no great resource, just as a great substance cannot rely on what is small. Therefore, principle has its ultimate measure, things their fixed limits; each suffices for its task, and their success is one. Yet if one loses the master of life and pursues it beyond what is fitting—if affairs exceed one’s strength, if actions fail to match one’s nature—then even wings spanning the sky cannot escape exhaustion, nor can the swiftest flight avoid distress.

The reason the roc now plans its journey south is not that it craves height or admires distance, but that without accumulated wind, the path is blocked. Thus, for three meals, the farther one travels, the more provisions one must gather; the larger the wings, the thicker the qi must be. The "two creatures" refer to the roc and the cicada, the great contrasted with the small to show their differing inclinations.

Yet why do their inclinations differ? Not because they knowingly choose difference, but because each follows its nature unawares. This is the great meaning of *xiaoyaoyou*. The disparity in years and knowledge is so vast—compared to the sorrow of common folk, it is even more lamentable. Yet common folk never lament this, for each nature has its limit. If one knows this limit, then even the slightest excess is impossible; what in the world is there to grieve?

Things never shrink because they desire smallness, nor do they necessarily envy greatness. Thus, the distinction between small and great has its fixed measure, beyond the reach of envy or desire. Once the burden of envy and desire is severed, sorrow departs. With sorrow gone, how could one’s nature and life fail to be at peace? From this point onward, *Liezi* enumerates the varying scales of years and knowledge, each adhering to its own standard, none sufficient to overturn another. Only then does he unify them under the person free from dependence, who forgets the self and obscures these distinctions. All differences—whether of direction or kind—are equally attained, while I remain without merit or fame. Thus, the one who unites small and great is without small or great. If there were small and great, then even the great roc and the sparrow, the minister and the wind-rider, would alike be burdened by things.

The one who equalizes life and death is without life or death. If there were life and death, then even the great *chun* tree and the cicada, Pengzu and the morning mushroom, would be equally cut short. Therefore, to wander where there is no small or great is to be without limit; to be obscured in neither life nor death is to be without end. If *xiaoyaoyou* is bound to a particular realm, then even if one were set free to roam, there would still be an end—one would not yet be without action.

The newly transmitted passage states: *"Lesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge; short years do not reach long years. Thus, the morning mushroom does not compare to the cicada, the *mingling* does not compare to the great *chun*, and the short-lived child does not compare to Pengzu. Yet when viewed through the principle of neither small nor great, neither death nor life, all are equally burdens of form—how then can there be any ‘not reaching’ or ‘not comparing’ among them?"*

Following the source:
The *tiao* and cicada: Those with black markings that sing in the fifth month are called *tiao*; those with speckled markings that sing after the seventh month are called cicadas; those with green markings are called *diaoliao* (sounding like *diao liao*). Some say they transform from dung beetles, water insects, or grubs. The *xue* mountain magpie is named for its resemblance to the turtledove in form.

The *xuejiu*: Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Monthly Commands* states: *"The singing turtledove resembles the mountain magpie but is smaller, with a short tail and dark blue-black color; it is very vocal. Now in Jiangdong it is called *guzhou* (sounding like *gu zhou*)."* The *Monthly Commands* says: *"In the second month of spring, hawks transform into turtledoves; in the second month of autumn, turtledoves transform into hawks."* The *Zuozhuan*’s *Shuangjiu* lineage—Du Yu’s commentary identifies it as the hawk. Because the two creatures transform into one another, the turtledove can be named after the hawk. These two insects, capable of transformation yet small, are thus contrasted with the *kun* and roc.

The *jun* are ground mushrooms. Large ones are called *zhong* [□], small ones *jun*. Mushrooms grow by the morning, hence "morning mushroom." The *huigū* is also a cicada. The *Tongzhi Lüe* states: *"The cold cicada is properly called *huigū*; in the ninth and tenth months, its cry is mournful and urgent."* The *Xiaoshan* says: *"The *huigū* cries, *jiujiu*; the year ends, and it cannot endure."* This refers to the small purple-green cicadas of the fourth and fifth months, as in Zhuangzi’s *"the *huizhan* does not know spring and autumn."*

*Ming* is the Southern Darkness; *ling* is the spirit turtle. The unicorn, phoenix, turtle, and dragon are called the Four Spirits. The *mingling* is the spirit turtle of the Dark Sea. The morning mushroom and the great *chun*, the *huigū* and the *mingling*—these pair one plant and one animal, making it clear that the *mingling* is not a plant.

*"Five hundred years as spring, five hundred years as autumn"*: The *Records of the Grand Historian* states that a thousand-year-old turtle measures one foot two inches; two five-hundred-year periods make up the thousand years. *"Eight thousand years as spring, eight thousand years as autumn"*: The character *chun* is split into two; eight hundred multiplied by ten yields two eight-thousand-year periods.

The *guji* and fabrications arise by chance—this is likely another case of the character *hai*’s two heads and six bodies, merely unrecognized by readers.

When Tang questioned Ji about this, Ji replied: Beyond the northern lands of bare wilderness lies the Dark Sea—the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, spanning thousands of *li* in breadth, its length unknown; its name is Kun. There is also a bird, named Peng, whose back resembles Mount Tai and whose wings hang like clouds veiling the sky. It spirals upward on whirling winds like rams’ horns, ascending ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and bearing the blue heavens on its back, then sets its course southward, bound for the Southern Dark.

The quail mocked it, saying: “Where does it think it’s going? I leap and bound upward no more than a few *ren*, then descend to soar among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the utmost of flight! Where does it think it’s going?” This is the distinction between small and great.

Thus, those whose knowledge suffices to fill an office, whose conduct matches a village’s standards, whose virtue pleases a lord, or whose ability wins a state—they regard themselves no differently. Yet even Song Rongzi would laugh at them. Though the whole world praised him, he would not be encouraged; though the whole world blamed him, he would not be disheartened. He had settled the division between inner and outer, discerned the bounds of honor and disgrace—this was all. In his relation to the world, he was not hasty. Yet even he had not yet attained the ultimate.

Liezi rode the wind and traveled, light and effortless, returning after fifteen days. In his pursuit of good fortune, he was not hasty. Yet though he avoided walking, he still depended on something.

Those who ride the constancy of Heaven and Earth, who harness the transformations of the six qi to wander through the boundless—what could they possibly depend upon? Thus it is said: the Perfect One is without self, the Spirit Man is without achievement, the Sage is without name.

Those who distinguish between inner and outer set the self within and things without; those who demarcate the realms of honor and disgrace exalt themselves and debase others—this is the furthest they can go. Those who do not frequently engage with the world are content with themselves and thus remain aloof from it. Yet this is still akin to one who has not yet crossed the ford: they merely affirm themselves but cannot yet embrace all without exception.

The demeanor of one who is serene and effortlessly refined—though they may return after fifteen days—still relies on something. Even one who rides the wind cannot circumnavigate the world in an instant; their movement, too, is natural, not something they strive after. Yet without wind, they cannot travel; thus, they must depend on something. Only those who ride nothing are without dependence.

Heaven and Earth are the collective names for the myriad things. Heaven and Earth take the myriad things as their body, and the myriad things must take spontaneity as their norm. Thus, the great Peng’s ability to soar high, the quail’s ability to fly low, the great tree’s ability to live long, and the morning mushroom’s brief span—all these are what spontaneity enables, not what effort achieves. Not acting yet able to do so is the norm. Therefore, riding the constancy of Heaven and Earth is to follow the nature of the myriad things; harnessing the transformations of the six qi is to wander the paths of change. Proceeding thus, where could there be an end? Whatever one encounters, one rides—what then could one depend upon? This is the freedom of those of utmost virtue, who merge self and other.

If there is dependence, then even the lightness and wonder of Liezi cannot travel without wind; only by obtaining what they depend upon can they be free. How much more so for the great Peng? Only those who merge with things and follow great transformation can be without dependence and ever-unobstructed—how could this be mere self-attainment? They also guide those with dependence to not lose what they rely upon; if what they rely upon is not lost, they too merge with the great unobstructedness.

Thus, I cannot equate the dependent and the independent. As for each resting in its nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolding spontaneously, receiving without knowing—I cannot distinguish between them. If even the independent are not sufficient to distinguish themselves from the dependent, how much less the vast and minute among the dependent?

There is no end, so one follows things to the utmost. When principle reaches its limit, traces vanish. Now, following without aiding becomes one with the ultimate principle—thus, there is no achievement. The Sage is merely the name for things attaining their nature; this is insufficient to name how they attain it.

Zhi Daolin:

The carefree wandering reveals the mind of the Perfected Person. Zhuangzi established his discourse on the great Dao and conveyed his meaning through the roc and the quail. The roc, with its vast path of sustenance, loses its ease beyond its own form; the quail, content in proximity, mocks what is distant, harboring self-conceit within. The Perfected Person rides the celestial norm and roams joyfully, unbounded in unfettered wandering. Things are things, yet he is not thinged by things—thus, he remains remote, beyond their grasp. Profound responses do not fail to arise swiftly, yet in their arising, he is carefree, nowhere unsuited. This is why it is called carefree wandering.

As for those with desires, when they attain what suffices, they are content in their sufficiency, delighting as if in natural spontaneity. Yet like the hungry who eat their fill or the thirsty who drink to satiety, how could they forget the steamed grains or abandon the goblet of fine wine? If it is not ultimate sufficiency, how can it be called carefree wandering?

Xu Xi:

The intent of the parable is entrusted to the *Qi Xie*, yet it remains insufficient, so it is further entrusted to Tang’s inquiry—"If you do not believe it, try verifying it with so-and-so." Song Rongzi may have achieved this, yet he has not attained carefree wandering. Even Liezi, who rode the wind, reached this point, yet still did not attain carefree wandering. Only when one is utterly without dependence can it be called wandering. Thus, the earlier words about "riding the wind" still do not qualify as carefree wandering. The roc marks the beginning of wandering—ten thousand *li* from home, one first glimpses the sky’s hue, yet by the time one arrives, even the roc is no longer worth mentioning. The unplanted tree still leans upon something; it has not yet departed from...

Is this not the realm of right and wrong? Yet one who is *lingran* (serenely detached) dwells beyond the world’s right and wrong. To govern *qi* through form is still not to depart from *qi*. Only by riding the uprightness of Heaven and Earth does one stand at the origin of the ten thousand things—above the single *qi*, where there is no yin, no yang, no wind, no rain, no darkness, no light. Though Heaven and Earth arise together with me, the ten thousand things and I alone stand independent—not by entrusting form to another.

The perfected person has no self; how much less do they have achievements or fame?

---

**New Transmission:**
The Kun-peng’s southward flight and the quail’s leaping differ in scale, hence the saying: "This is the distinction between small and great." Yet the Kun-peng and the quail each possess their own form, which is why they do not attain carefree wandering. But does carefree wandering truly depart from the original body? Rather, each obscures its limits equally—whether carefree or burdened, whether at ease or in distress, the difference lies solely in whether one is enlightened or not.

---

**Brush Jottings:**
The perfected person knows the Dao, inwardly obscuring all thoughts until they vanish without reliance—hence "no self." The spirit-person exhausts the Dao, accomplishing the ten thousand things with wondrous efficacy deeply concealed—hence "no achievement." The sage forgets the Dao, their divine transformations vast and unfathomable—hence "no name."

Yao offered the world to Xu You, saying: "The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch-fire still burns—is it not difficult for its light to compare? The timely rain has fallen, yet you still irrigate—is it not laborious for its moisture to compare? You stand and the world is governed, yet I still occupy the throne. I see myself as lacking—please take the world."

Xu You replied: "You govern the world, and the world is already governed. Yet I would still replace you—would I seek fame? Fame is but the guest of reality; would I seek to be a guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs only a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet needs only a bellyful. Return, my lord—what use is the world to me? If the kitchen chef does not prepare the food, the invocator at the sacrifice does not step beyond the wine vessels and sacrificial stands to take his place."

*(Xu You, a man of Yangcheng in Yingchuan, styled Wuzhong, withdrew to Mount Ji. *Jue* means torch-fire; *jiaoliao* is a small bird; *yan shu* is the mole.)*

---

**Guo’s Commentary:**
One who can govern the world does not govern the world. Thus Yao governed by not governing—this is not governing yet governing. Now, Xu You clearly saw that the world was already governed, so there was nothing for him to replace. The governance truly belonged to Yao, hence Xu You’s words: "You govern the world." Governance arises from non-governance, issuing from non-action. Yao’s attainment was sufficient—what need had he of Xu You? To claim that one must withdraw to the mountains and forests to be called "non-action" is the talk of Laozi and Zhuangzi, which is why it is rejected by those in power. Those in power remain fixed in the realm of action and do not return.

One who takes on burdens responds to things; one who flows with things is without opposition to them. Thus Yao was without opposition to the world, and Xu You was a peer to Hou Ji and Qi. Why say this? Because one who guards against things cannot be separated from the multitude of things. Thus, with a mindless and dark responsiveness, one follows only what is felt—adrift like an untethered boat, east or west is not of one’s own doing. Therefore, one who takes no action yet shares all with the people also goes nowhere without being the lord of the world. To be a lord in this way is like the height of Heaven—truly the virtue of a lord.

If one stands alone atop a high mountain, guarding the bias of a single household, one remains but a common thing among the vulgar, an outer minister to Yao. If such an outer minister were to replace the inner ruler, one would have the name of a lord without the responsibility of a lord.

The wren settles on a single branch; the mole drinks its fill—each speaks to the nature of things having its own limit. If one is content within that limit, then the wealth of the world becomes surplus. The two lines "retire in peace" and "equally useless" show that Yao alone possessed them, revealing that one who embraces openness has no fixed bounds, and thus the world delights in elevating him without weariness.

The cook and the ancestral priest each abide in their appointed roles; birds, beasts, and the myriad things each find sufficiency in what they receive. Emperor Yao and Xu You each rest in what they encounter—this is the utmost reality of the world. When each attains their reality, what more is there to do? Simply to be self-content. Thus, though Yao and Xu You differ like Heaven and Earth, in their freedom they are one.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
From Yao’s perspective, though Xu You practiced non-action, he was never incapable of action. Thus, Yao offered the world to him without hesitation. From Xu You’s perspective, though Yao desired action, it always arose from non-action. Thus, when the world was already well-governed, he refused to accept it. To take the world through non-doing and thereby govern it—this is the true essence of non-action. Once the world is governed, if I were still to take its place, it would be as if seizing the world to act upon it, and one would soon find it unmanageable. This would be claiming the name of non-action while missing its reality. Since the name is but the guest of reality, would I willingly pursue it?

Therefore, when one acts, the Nine Provinces and Four Seas gladly elevate him without feeling it excessive; when one does not act, a single branch or a full belly brings retirement without feeling it insufficient. This is why the world’s affairs are of no use to Yao and Xu You, and why they attain freedom. When acting, Yao ruled as Son of Heaven and possessed all under Heaven without excess; when not acting, Xu You lived as a commoner, retiring to Mount Ji without want. Taking Xu You as an analogy for Heaven’s workings—like the sun and moon, timely and correct. Taking Yao as an analogy for human endeavor—like a torch’s flicker or irrigation’s slow spread.

Yao, knowing Xu You could govern the world, dared not claim his place; Xu You, knowing Yao could govern the world, refused to replace him. Then who shall govern the world? If governed by Yao, it is action within non-action; if governed by Xu You, it is non-action within action. For the Dao in the sage appears as Yao when manifest and as Xu You when hidden—

Yan Wu asked Lian Shu, saying: "I heard Jie Yu’s words—they are vast yet without measure, boundless and never returning. I am startled and terrified by them, for they seem as the Milky Way, without end. They are so extreme, so far from human sentiment—how can this be?"

Lian Shu said: "What did he say?"

Yan Wu replied: "On the distant Mount Miaogu Ye, there dwells a spirit-person. Their skin is like ice and snow, their bearing supple as a maiden’s. They eat no grain, but drink the wind and sip the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, driving flying dragons to wander beyond the Four Seas. Their spirit is so concentrated that things suffer no blight, and the harvests ripen. Yet I deem this mad and cannot believe it."

Lian Shu said: "Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the sight of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that may be blind and deaf? The mind, too, may suffer this. Such words as these are timely, yet it is you who are blind and deaf. That person, that virtue—it pervades all things, uniting the world as one. Who, then, would trouble themselves with the world’s disorder? Those who take the world as their burden—nothing harms them. The greatest floods rise to the heavens, yet they do not drown; the fiercest drought melts metal and stone, scorches mountains and earth, yet they do not burn. Their dust and chaff could mold even Yao and Shun. Who would trouble themselves with things?

The people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yao governed the world’s people and brought order to all within the seas. Yet when he went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu Ye, by the northern banks of the Fen River, he was suddenly lost to the world, his mind adrift in the boundless dark.

Jie Yu was a man of Chu, surnamed Lu, named Tong. *Naoyue* means supple and yielding; *shi nü* refers to the present moment—here, *nü* is the character for 'you,' meaning that wisdom, too, has its blindness and deafness, and it is you who are mad and disbelieving. Guo’s commentary, which likens this to a maiden sought by many, is mistaken. *Bi bi* describes ceaseless striving; *ji* means to reach. *Zi* means to carry goods; *zhang fu* are Yin dynasty caps. The Four Masters, as Sima and Li both note, are Wang Ni, Nie Que, Pi Yi, and Xu You.

Guo’s commentary: These are but figures of speech—the spirit-person is the sage. Though the sage may sit in the halls of power, their heart is no different from one dwelling in the mountains and forests. How could the world recognize this? They see only the yellow canopy and jade seals and think these enough to bind the sage’s heart. They see the sage traversing mountains and rivers, sharing in the people’s affairs, and think this enough to weary their spirit. How could they know that the most perfect remains unharmed?

Now, to speak of one of kingly virtue and place them on this mountain is to show that the world has no way to recognize them. Thus, they are set beyond the farthest reaches, beyond sight and hearing. The maiden does not let the outer harm the inner. Not eating grain but drinking the wind and sipping the dew shows that the spirit-person is not sustained by grain but by the wondrous qi of nature itself. Those who embody the spirit, dwell in the numinous, and fathom the profoundest principles—though they may sit quietly in their halls, their mystery is as boundless as the Four Seas. They ride the Two Modes and command the Six Qi, guiding the multitude and driving the ten thousand things. If nothing is not in accord, then floating clouds become their steed; if no form is not borne, then flying dragons become their chariot. They forget the self and attain spontaneity, moving as if dragging a withered tree, resting as if a heap of dead ashes. Thus it is said: their spirit is concentrated. When their spirit is concentrated, what is not concentrated attains its own harmony.

The world judges by what it sees—how could it ever believe this? Not knowing the subtlety of such perfect words, they deem them mad and refuse to believe. This is the blindness and deafness of wisdom. 'Such words are timely, yet it is you'—this means that Jie Yu’s words naturally seek things, but those blind and deaf in wisdom deny their truth.

The sage’s heart encompasses the utmost meeting of the Two Modes and fathoms the wondrous numbers of the ten thousand things. Thus, they embody transformation and harmonize with change, nowhere unwelcome. Pervading the ten thousand things, nothing is not so. The world, in its disorder, seeks them, but they are without intent. If they are without intent, why would they not respond to the world? Their way of uniting the natures of the ten thousand things and molding the world to achieve the governance of Yao and Shun is always to act by not acting. Who would exhaust themselves in striving, laboring the spirit and toiling the mind, taking affairs as their affair, and only then succeed?

'Nothing harms them'—this means that when one is at ease with what harms, harm cannot harm; when harm cannot harm, things do not harm them. Wherever one goes, all is fitting; life and death hold no change for them—how much less drowning or burning? Thus, the perfected do not cling to misfortune and calamity—not by avoiding them, but by following principle straight ahead, naturally meeting with good fortune.

Yao and Shun are but names for worldly affairs. To be named is not to be the name itself. Thus, Yao and Shun are not merely Yao and Shun—they must possess the reality of the spirit-person. What we call Yao and Shun are but the dust and chaff of their names. Yao’s uselessness to the world is like the Yue’s uselessness for ceremonial caps. Yet those who abandon the world are revered by the world. Though the world reveres Yao, Yao never possessed the world. Thus, he was suddenly lost to it, ever roaming his heart in the darkest depths. Though seated above the ten thousand things, he was never not free.

The Four Masters are but figures of speech to show that Yao was not confined to being Yao. Yao was truly guarded, yet his traces were those of Yao. The world sees only Yao as Yao—how could they know his mystery? Thus, they seek the Four Masters beyond the seas and judge Yao by what they see, claiming that those who flow with things lose their freedom. Yet they do not know that what seems most distant is in truth nearest, and what seems highest is in truth lowest.

If one clings to solitary loftiness as perfection and does not level with the common, they are but a hermit of the mountains and valleys—not one who is without dependence. How could they speak of the utmost and wander the infinite?

Fan Wu Yin: The mountain is an analogy for the body; *Miaoshe* speaks of its seclusion. The spirit-person is the utmost numinous within the body. If one seeks this utmost numinous within the secluded depths, then not eating grain, drinking the wind and sipping the dew, riding clouds and driving dragons to wander the Four Seas is no exaggeration. Yet to seek it outside is to go far indeed.

Guan Jian: Their skin like ice and snow—embodying pure simplicity, no dust can defile them.

Graceful as a maiden, she guards her softness to preserve her wholeness—harm cannot reach her. By not eating grain but drawing in the wind and sipping the dew, she severs worldly flavors to embrace heaven and earth’s pure chill. Riding clouds and driving dragons to wander the Four Seas, she soars through the vastness of space, merging with the primordial qi’s obscurity—this is what is meant by "arriving without traveling" and "roaming with the Creator." Her spirit congeals, preventing blight and pestilence so that the harvest ripens. This is the utmost of nurturing the spirit: not only preserving oneself but also aiding heaven and earth’s transformative nurturing and assisting the spontaneity of the myriad things. Such words reveal the effect of extending oneself to benefit others, thereby uniting with the unfathomable spirit and aligning with the boundless Dao.

Yet some, misled by names and appearances, seek this mountain beyond the furthest reaches—thus the so-called spirit-person becomes ever more distant. Moreover, the saying that "dust, grime, chaff, and husks mold Yao and Shun" seems to belittle them, but upon examining the classics and their safeguards, one finds the highest reverence. What the world calls Yao and Shun, extolling them as sages, merely praises their dust and chaff. How could the true essence of Yao and Shun be captured in mere names?

Xun Ben: *"Great divergence"*—*jing* refers to the path before the gate, and *ting* to the ground outside the hall. Though path and courtyard are not far apart, Jie Yu’s words differ so greatly from ordinary speech that they seem as distant as path and courtyard—unlike the usual proximity of path and courtyard.

Hui Zi said to Zhuangzi: "The King of Wei gave me a large calabash seed. I planted it, and it grew to hold five *dan*. When filled with water, its strength could not support itself. When split to make ladles, its hollowness left no place to contain anything. It was not that it wasn’t resoundingly large—it was simply useless, so I smashed it."

Zhuangzi replied: "You are indeed inept at putting great things to use. There was a man from Song skilled in making a salve that prevented chapping. For generations, his family made a living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of this and offered a hundred gold pieces for the recipe. The family gathered and deliberated: 'For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and earned no more than a few pieces of gold. Now, in one morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred gold. Let’s give it to him.' The traveler acquired it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Wu and Yue were at war, the King of Wu made him a general. In winter, he engaged Yue in a naval battle and decisively defeated them. A portion of land was carved out and bestowed upon him. The ability to prevent chapping was the same, yet one man was enfeoffed while another could not escape washing silk floss—the difference lay in how it was used.

Now you have a five-*dan* calabash. Why not consider making it into a great float to drift upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you worry that its hollowness leaves no place to contain anything—your mind is still as tangled as a clump of weeds!"

Hui Zi said to Zhuangzi: "I have a large tree—people call it a *chu*. Its massive trunk is gnarled and does not meet the inked line; its smaller branches are twisted and do not conform to compass or square. Standing by the road, no carpenter would glance at it. Now your words are grand but useless—everyone rejects them alike."

Zhuangzi replied: "Have you never seen a wildcat or a weasel? They crouch low to ambush their prey, leaping east and west, dodging high and low, only to be caught in a trap or die in a net. Then there is the yak, as vast as a drifting cloud—great indeed, yet it cannot catch mice. Now you have a large tree and fret over its uselessness. Why not plant it in the land of Nothingness, the vast wilds of boundless expanse? Wander idly by its side, roam carefree beneath it, sleep undisturbed under its branches. No axe will fell it prematurely, and nothing will harm it. If it is of no use, where is the hardship in that?"

Hui Shi, surnamed Hui and named Shi, served as Prime Minister of Liang. The *gourd that holds five piculs*—as Sima [Biao] notes, "holds five piculs within" and is *huoluo* (vast and hollow), meaning broad and empty. The *xu* (floss) is called *kuang*; the *zun* (goblet) resembles a wine vessel, its body floating upon rivers and lakes, allowing one to cross on one’s own—this is a matter of contemplation.

"Waiting for prey" means lying in wait for soaring creatures to feed upon them. "Nothingness" and "boundless expanse" refer to a desolate, useless land.

Guo’s commentary: "The medicine enables hands not to chap, so one constantly floats floss in water. The *peng* is not merely a vessel for direct use. This speaks of things great and small: if they lose their proper measure, the principles of benefit and harm are the same. When use is found in their proper place, all things wander freely."

Lü’s commentary: "Dao, as a term, is one. If not used well, it is insufficient even to sustain the four limbs—thus, generation after generation, washing floss brings no more than a few coins. If used well, it not only sustains the self but even when the world is drowning, one may still save it—this is like using it in naval battles or splitting the earth to establish fiefdoms. Pour into it, and it does not fill; ladle from it, and it does not empty."

The unexhausted—this too is man’s rivers and lakes. Now you possess a great vessel yet cannot float it in a vast expanse, fretting that it has no place to hold things—this is called a *peng*-bound heart. How fitting! Things take usefulness as their use: when used in small ways, they take uselessness as their use; when used in great ways, the leaping weasel and squirrel die in nets and snares, unable to be effortless, and so perish through cunning and skill—this is the analogy. The yak is vast yet cannot catch mice; to roam effortlessly, to preserve its form and life—this is the analogy. The sage’s relation to the Dao is to embody it with deep roots and firm stem, so that as a tree, it is great indeed. Those who wish to fell it would do best to return and seek their own hearts. The heart, as a thing, no one knows its abode; find its unknowable place and rest in it—this is the tree’s dwelling in the land of nothingness. Fill it, and it grows ever vaster; still it, and the ten thousand things cannot disturb it. Roam freely at its side, sleep beneath it—never for a moment is it apart. Then where is the distress in what is called great yet useless? Why do you fret over it?

Chen Xiangdao’s commentary: "Things have their proper place; affairs have their fitting application. The trouble lies in not using them well. The medicine that prevents chapped hands is one and the same: the Song people used it for small profit, the Wu people for great. The strategies of the Seven Warring States were one and the same: when Chao Cuo used them, disaster arose; when Zhufu Yan used them, chaos ceased. Is the use of the great gourd any different? The gourd is hollow within and good for holding things, round without and good for floating. Set it on the ground, and it loses its floating nature, its firmness unable to lift itself. Split it to make a ladle, and you destroy its roundness, leaving the gourd fragments with nothing to contain. But if you consider it as a flagon and float it on rivers and lakes, it lifts itself without effort, fitting everywhere without hindrance. Generally, small things are easy to use, while great things are hard to use. Yet human nature is skilled in using small things but often clumsy with great ones, finding them difficult. To handle them with skill rather than following their nature and letting principle guide—who can compare to one who sheds the burden of a *peng*-bound heart? The weasel and squirrel are small and useful, yet cannot escape disaster; the yak is large and useless, yet nothing harms it. Thus, the use of usefulness does not surpass the use of uselessness. The great catalpa is useless—yet if you plant it in a place of uselessness, the planter may wander freely, and those who wish to fell it are spared the axe’s harm. How can this compare to those who turn and twist on the path of profit and harm, battered by the俗世? They are not even worth mentioning in the same breath."

Xun Ben’s commentary: "This chapter is titled *Free and Easy Wandering*, yet the entire piece is threaded through with a single word: *transformation*. The first section speaks of the roc and the peng, the cicada and the quail, the sparrow—each transforms differently in size, so their flight varies in height. The second section speaks of Heaven’s transformations, which also differ in size, so their free and easy wandering varies in excellence. The third section speaks of how, if one can transform the useless into the useful, one may also wander freely and easily. What Heaven bestows has its fixed allotment—how can the cicada, quail, and sparrow be forced to match the roc and peng? Yet for humans, whether wise or foolish, worthy or unworthy, all may ascend the great Dao. Still, some see themselves as cicadas, quails, or sparrows. Thus, at the chapter’s end, it enlightens them: though a man may be like a hollow gourd too cumbersome to lift, or a gnarled, twisted catalpa, if he can follow its nature and use it according to circumstance, transforming with the moment—how could he lose his free and easy wandering?"

*Bishu* commentary: "The Master said, 'I am truly clumsy at using great things.' The reply: 'It is the difference in how they are used.'"

For human nature is fundamentally one—yet the use of it differs. When used with skill, one attains free and easy wandering; when used clumsily, one is bound and constrained. This is precisely what Confucius meant when he said, "By nature, men are close; by practice, they grow far apart." The land of Nothing-Whatsoever, the wilds of Boundless-Expanse—this is the use that is no-use, the true place of return. Thus the matter is concluded by way of use.

*General Observations in My Humble View*:
Those who follow the utmost principle find the Dao pervading all things; those who preserve their original nature move in harmony with the world. Once one attains the single Heavenly principle, how could one fail to wander freely and easily? The mind of the infant is originally without knowledge; as form grows, knowledge expands, and contact with things begins. Gain and loss lodge in the heart, ice and fire contend within—abandoning this, laboring for that, without respite. If one does not illumine principle with perfect clarity and let the power of Dao prevail, even those of the highest rank and greatest wealth cannot escape entanglement. Thus the essential task in learning the Dao is first to seek the joy of the sages and worthies, to embody and thoroughly investigate it. As the *Book of Changes* says, "Rejoice in Heaven and know fate"; Yan Hui found joy in his gourd bowl and bamboo cup; Mencius nurtured his vast qi until it filled Heaven and Earth; Yuan Xian sang as he walked, his voice ringing like metal and stone. All these transcended the burdens of external things, preserved their Heaven-given nature, and in action or stillness, going or staying, knew no joy but this—only thus can one speak of free and easy wandering.

The kun of the Northern Darkness transforms into the roc, riding the wind to strike the waters and migrate to the Southern Darkness. This illustrates how scholars, confined by narrow learning and petty concerns, lose sight of the profound clarity of the sea of nature and sink the pearl of fate into oblivion. Thus the text presents this great creature born in a vast place to clarify the origin of one’s own being. With long cultivation, body and spirit unite, and one emerges from yin to enter yang—its use unfathomable. Those who "take knowledge as their office, conduct as their norm, virtue as their match, or ability as their measure" will awaken to the lightness of external things and the weight of one’s own Heavenly nature. Then, nurturing the wind and soaring beyond the clouds, they merge with the boundless transformation—what worldly burden could reach them? Only when one rides Heaven and Earth, harnesses the six qi, and roams the infinite can one attain the ultimate in free and easy wandering. The utmost in spiritual sageliness is nothing but complete fusion and transformation—fame and achievement are but external things.

The chapter where Yao offers the throne to Xu You serves to confirm the preceding meaning, fostering a spirit of humility and warning later generations against coveting external pursuits. It greatly benefits the governance of the Dao. When Jian Wu hears the words of Jie Yu, the secrets of the spirit-person are revealed, illustrating that the utmost numinous power within the body must be cultivated through preservation and nurturance—it is not to be sought far away. "Dust and grime, chaff and husks, can be molded into Yao and Shun"—this speaks of the spirit-person’s virtue, which moves in accord with Heaven. Even its remnants suffice to bring about the governance of Tang and Yu, yet its true essence is beyond the ken of worldly people.

When Yao went to see the Four Masters on the distant Guye Mountain, the subtle principle could not be fathomed by conjecture—one must personally reach Guye. The Four Masters need not be described; let scholars take heed. This chapter begins with discussions of the kun and peng, the cicada and quail, the divine tree and the morning mushroom, all exploring the principle of knowing fate in terms of great and small. At its close, it presents the great gourd, preserving itself through emptiness within, and the massive catalpa, securing itself through deep roots—metaphors for fully realizing one’s nature to the utmost of fate, achieving the great completion of learning the Dao and entering the realm of the spirit. Without haste, one moves swiftly; without going, one arrives—where could one not wander freely and easily?

**Chapter Two: On the Equality of Things**

**Guo’s Commentary:** From one’s own perspective, this is right and that is wrong; one praises oneself and disparages others—none fail to do so. Yet though right and wrong differ, self and other are equal. *Jingchuan’s entire discourse argues that fundamentally there is no right or wrong, for right and wrong are all made by man.*

---

Nanguo Ziqi sat leaning against his table, gazing upward and exhaling with a sigh, as though he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, “What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the heart like dead ashes? Yet the one who now leans here is not the same as the one who leaned here before.”

Ziqi said, “Yan, is this not well asked? Now I have lost my self—do you understand? You have heard the *human pipes*, but not the *earthly pipes*; you have heard the *earthly pipes*, but not the *heavenly pipes*.”

Ziyou said, “May I ask the method?”

Ziqi said, “The great clod breathes forth *qi*—its name is wind. This only arises when there is no activity; when it acts, the myriad hollows roar and howl. Have you alone not heard its long, rushing sound? The towering peaks and forests, the lofty trees of a hundred spans—all their hollows resemble noses, mouths, ears, beams, rings, mortars, pits, or pools. Some gush, some whistle, some hiss, some inhale, some cry, some wail, some moan, some sob. The gentle breeze brings a small harmony; the whirlwind, a great harmony. When the fierce gale subsides, all hollows fall silent—have you alone not seen their quivering, swaying motion?”

Zifang said, “The *earthly pipes* are simply these myriad hollows; the *human pipes* are but the joined bamboo. May I ask about the *heavenly pipes*?”

Ziqi said, “The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own cessation. Who stirs them to such fury?”

The dissolution of form is but the pairing of semblances—some say it is the body, for body and spirit form a pair, vast as the great expanse of heaven. *Wei* resembles towering mountains and hills; *jī*, *bó*, and *lú* are brackets and capitals. *Yǎo* means deep; *yǎo*, a sound of sorrowful grief.

Guo’s commentary: “Since heaven and humanity are equal, self and other alike, nothing external remains to bring joy—thus one dissolves in stillness, as if losing one’s mate. Like withered wood or dead ashes, it speaks only of desolation and the absence of feeling. Those who follow nature and forget right and wrong rely solely on their innate truth—what else could they possess? Thus, their stillness resembles a withered tree, their movement drifting dust; in their bearing of motion and rest, I cannot find unity. In their effortless attainment of the uncontrived, I cannot find a second way. I have lost my self, and my self has forgotten itself—what in the world remains to be known? Only when all within and without is forgotten can one transcend and attain all.”

*Lài* means flute. Flutes and pipes, varying in length and pitch, produce myriad sounds of differing registers, yet the measure they receive is one. Thus, no distinction of superiority or inferiority arises among them. How much more so with the winds and things: though their sounds differ, all arise from their own accord. Herein lies the *heavenly pipes*.

A clod is nothingness; the sighing of breath—how could it be a thing? Qi simply sighs of itself, clod-like. All things that come to life do so clod-like, arising of themselves—thus the greatness of the clod-like body. Hence, it is called the *Great Clod*. The roaring of the long wind is the stirring of the mighty gale. From the nose and mouth onward, the text briefly lists the forms of the myriad hollows; from the rushing and whistling onward, it briefly lists their differing sounds. As for *yú*, it speaks of the harmony of notes: though the sounds of gong and shang transform endlessly, in their calls and responses, great and small, none fail to match what they receive, each fitting its proper place. *Jì* means cessation. When the fierce wind arises, the myriad hollows are full; when it ceases, they are empty. Though emptiness and fullness differ, in each attaining its own, they are the same. *Tiáotiáo diāodiāo* describes a quivering, swaying appearance: though the sounds of things differ, the movements of their forms likewise vary. Though their movements differ, in their attainment of equality, they are one. How could *tiáotiáo* alone be right and *diāodiāo* alone be wrong?

“The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own cessation”—this is the *heavenly pipes*. Are the *heavenly pipes* some separate thing? They are nothing but the myriad hollows, the joined bamboo, and all that connects with the realm of the living, coming together to form a single heaven. If there is no nothingness, it cannot give rise to being; if being has not yet arisen, it cannot give rise to life. Then who gives life to life? It arises of itself, clod-like. It is not I who give life; since I cannot give life to things, and things cannot give life to me, I am simply natural. Since it is so of itself, it is called *natural*—how could it refer to the azure sky? Yet some claim the *heavenly pipes* command things to follow them. But heaven itself cannot possess itself—how could it possess things? Thus, *heaven* is but the general name for the myriad things. If none is fit to be called heaven, who then commands things? Things each arise of themselves, without source—this is the Dao of heaven. “All attain their own, who stirs them to such fury?”—this further clarifies the *heavenly pipes*.

Lü’s commentary: “The reason one has form and mind is simply because one has a self. If there were no self, it would be no different from dead ashes or withered wood. Ziyou did not know whence his self arose, nor how it was enslaved by form and mind, leaving him no respite—how could he have come to this? Yet in that moment of stillness, he recognized the difference between past and present, his observation growing keen. For in the past, his stillness was a response to things; now, his stillness is a forgetting of things. If one knows whence the self arises, then existence and loss have never been beyond one’s grasp.

Bamboo pipes are things all know to be hollow and empty. The reason I am I is no different: when the myriad hollows roar in fury, is it not like the time when I am enslaved by my form and mind? When the hollows fall empty, is it not like the time when I have lost my self, like withered wood or dead ashes? ‘Have you alone not heard, have you alone not seen?’—it speaks of the arising and cessation of the *earthly pipes*, which you have heard and seen, while the arising and cessation of the mind, which you have never heard or seen. By investigating what you have heard and seen, you may understand what you have never heard or seen—thus the *heavenly pipes* may be known.”

Yi Du’s note: “The wind emerges from emptiness, seeking no trace; it arises from stillness and returns to stillness, is born from nothingness and returns to nothingness. Only the differing capacities of the hollows make the sounds heard by people vary; it is the same with the endowments of the myriad things. The myriad hollows are sounded by the wind; the myriad forms are moved by transformation. If the wind cannot sound, the myriad hollows are empty; if transformation cannot move, the myriad things are still. As for that which has no sound and no hollows—it is not something the wind can enter. This is what Liezi called *dubious solitude*.”

Xin Zhuan’s note: “*Ǒu* means pairing; all things have their mates, yet only the Dao and spirit are wondrous and without mate. Without mate, they return to unity, forgetting self and other—thus the judgments of things are equalized. The stillness of today is not the stillness of yesterday—this is what the Brahmin meant when he said, ‘I am still I, yet I am not the I of yesterday.’ The *heavenly pipes*, *earthly pipes*, and *human pipes*—the reason the myriad hollows differ is that they all receive the wind to form sound. Though the myriad things differ, they all entrust themselves to qi to form their bodies. Hollows are sounded by the wind, and things are moved by transformation; though their encounters differ, they all return to unity—thus self and other cannot but be equal. Yet the wind cannot sound without hollows, and transformation cannot move without things. Who can escape the burden of form and the delusions of the mind, attaining clarity and enlightenment, so that ‘I am not possessed by me’? Then one enters the wondrous and transcends the constraints of creation.”

Xun Ben’s note: “*The Equality of Things*—the form of the wind seems to flow from the tip of the brush; only the hand of a master craftsman could achieve this. Nose, mouth, ears—these three resemble human forms. *Jī* are stacked with gaps; *quān* are round and hollow; *jiù* are concave in the center—these three resemble the forms of vessels. Water pooling in a cow’s hoofprint is called *wā*; water flowing into a depression is called *wū*—these two resemble the forms of the earth. This speaks of their forms.

Below, it speaks of their sounds: *jī* is like the sound of rushing water; *hè* like the sound of an arrow leaving the bow; *hào* like the sound of wailing; *yǎo* like the sound in the southeast corner of a deep room; *yǎo* like the sound of a bird’s pecking; *chàng yú*—the *yú* is a reed pipe, as Han Fei said: ‘The *yú* leads the five notes, hence it is called *chàng yú*.’ *Yóng* means the hollows are like the gaping mouths of fish.”

The *líng* wind is the clear, cool wind; the *piāo* wind is the fleeting, drifting wind. *Diāo-diāo* describes the wind at the treetops—*diāo-diāo* in harmony, yet *diāo-diāo* in caution. In common speech, a gentle wind is called *diāo-diāo*, and tea-pickers pluck the tender shoots, saying they are *diāo-duō*—*diāo-diāo* and ready to be plucked.

Xūxī says: “My mate is lost, yet I remain. If things perish alongside me, from where does dispute arise? It is but contention without end.” Zhuangzi sought to depict the heartlessness of disputation, and from the world he found what is most rootless: the wind. To know whence the wind arises and what it receives is to equalize all that is unequal.

How vast is heaven and earth! How vast is the wind—a mere sigh. Such are the words of the enlightened. *Wéi* from the mountain is called *fáng*; *cuī* from the mountain is called *cuī*—the secluded corners and sharp angles of mountain forests where the wind does not reach.

*Jì* means crossing in chaos, as in a fierce wind greater than the *piāo* wind. Where it passes, all hollows resound together, like a breath through emptiness. If *jì* were to cease, to what would the fierce wind belong? With so many hollows and crevices, add *diāo-diāo* and *diāo-diāo*, and even the swaying treetops would be left with nothing untouched.

In the world, there is no day without right and wrong—small winds for small matters, great winds for great matters—yet in the end, all must still to rest. This is what is meant by equalization. To recognize their source is to equalize them without waiting for their cessation.

Who stirs up anger? That which acts without acting is heaven.

The *fùmò* [secondary ink—notes that serve the primary text]:

What destroys the self is forgetting the self. Forgetting the self, one attains heaven. One who wanders with heaven knows yet has never known, speaks yet has never spoken. Thus, though the three *lài* are raised in discussion, they ultimately return to the heavenly *lài*. *Lài* are flutes and pipes—their sounds rise and fall, bright and dark, like the unevenness of things and judgments, comparable to human actions. Hence, they are called the human *lài* and the earthly *lài*, while the wooden hollows produce sound; the heavenly *lài*, however, is soundless yet capable of all sounds under heaven. This is what is meant by "as if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found."

The hollows of wood have two holes resembling nostrils, one hole resembling a mouth, holes slanting inward like ears, square holes like crossbeams, deep round holes like rings, shallow ones like mortars, curved ones like depressions, and wide ones like puddles. These several phrases depict the hollows so vividly they seem visible. Furthermore, the sounds of these hollows: when struck, they clatter and cease; when blown, they rush forth swiftly; when shouted into, they issue roughly; when inhaled, they enter softly; when cried out, they rise sharply; when howled, they descend turbidly; when deep, they linger; when gnawed, they bark and continue—like light singing. *Yóng* is deep harmony; the advance and retreat of wind are its advancing and retreating fronts.

The *líng* wind is a gentle breeze; the *piāo* wind is a swift gale; the *lì* wind is a fierce gust. Though the myriad blows differ, each ceases of itself. "All take from themselves"—this phrase means that though the myriad sounds differ, each arising of itself, all are self-derived and not from Heaven. Then who is it that roars and howls within the hollows? Clearly, there is a true master governing them, yet no trace of it can be found. Thus it is called the Heavenly Pipe.

The great wisdom is expansive; the petty wisdom is cramped. The grand words blaze; the small words prattle. In sleep, the spirits intermingle; in waking, the forms open. Engaging with things, they weave connections, daily contending with the heart. Some are slack, some guarded, some timid, trembling with small fears, or drifting with great ones. Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow’s trigger—this is what it means to judge right and wrong. Their persistence is like a sworn oath—this is what it means to cling to victory. Their decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decay. Their drowning in things cannot be reversed. Their oppression is like sealing—speaking of their aging stagnation. The heart near death cannot be made to revive. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight; thought, sighing, change, and dread; coquetry, ease, openness, and postures—pleasure issues from emptiness, mushrooms form from steam, day and night succeeding one another before us, yet none knows whence they sprout. Enough! Enough!

At dawn and dusk we attain this—is this not the source from which life arises? Without that, there is no me; without me, there is nothing to grasp. This is nearly so, yet none knows what brings it about. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. It may act and be trusted, yet its form is unseen. It has essence but no form. The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all complete and present within—with whom should I be intimate? Do you all delight in them equally? Or is there partiality? Are they all servants and concubines? If so, are these servants and concubines insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and subject? Or is there a true lord residing within? Whether one seeks and obtains its truth or not, does it matter? Its truth is one: it receives its completed form and does not forget until its end. With things, it clashes and grinds away; its course runs to the utmost like a galloping horse, yet none can halt it. Is this not lamentable? A lifetime of toil and struggle, yet no success is seen. Exhausted and worn, one does not know where to return—how can this not be sorrowful? People call this "not dying"—what benefit is there? The body transforms, the heart with it—can this not be called great sorrow?

*[Spare and expansive in appearance, yet distinct in detail; blazing and magnificent in aspect, narrow and petty in speech; carefree and broad of heart.]*

Deep-heartedness—this is profound intent. Trembling timidity—this is petty caution. The appearance of equanimity toward life and death—unmoving stillness—these are the first signs. All-encompassing completeness—this is thorough preparation.

*[Guo’s Commentary: The spacious and distinct show differences in knowledge; the blazing and petty reveal disparities in speech. The mingling of souls and the merging of forms differ in waking and dreaming; the carefree and the secretive diverge in intimacy. Trembling and carefree mark differences in fear and dread; the judging of right and wrong, the guarding of victories, and the regulation of movement and stillness—all vary. Daily, they wane and decline, and cannot be drowned again to proceed thus. Sealed in desire, submerged in longing, the old grow ever more mired. Near death, they take profit and danger lightly, calamity and misfortune as nothing—none can restore their yang, their yin congealed, their wills fulfilled. Joy and anger below—these are the divergences of nature and emotion. Music arising from emptiness, mushrooms steaming into being—these are the transformations of events. From this point upward, the boundless spontaneity of Heaven’s piping is roughly sketched; below, the naturalness of boundlessness is clarified.]*

Each thing is spontaneous, not knowing why it is so, yet so it is. Though forms may differ endlessly, their spontaneity is ever the same. Day and night succeed one another, and thus the world renews itself. Heaven and Earth, the myriad things—all change and daily renew, advancing with time. What thing initiates this? It is simply so of itself. That by which it lives speaks of its self-generation. That is spontaneity. Spontaneity gives birth to me, and I give birth to spontaneity. Thus spontaneity is none other than my own spontaneity—how distant is it? Not knowing what impels it, all things, in all their variety, are simply thus of themselves, not acting at another’s behest. Therefore, if one follows it, principle arrives of itself.

The ten thousand things, the ten thousand dispositions—though their lodgings differ, it seems as if a true master makes them so. Yet when one arises to seek the traces of this true master, in the end it cannot be found. Thus it is clear that all things are spontaneous, with nothing compelling them to be so. The traveler who trusts in what can be traveled, whose feelings accord with things, who does not distinguish forms—then the hundred bones and nine orifices are entrusted to spontaneity, and none are not thoroughly preserved. If one delights in it, there is partiality; with partiality, one cannot be thorough and preserving. If the will exceeds its proper measure, high and low encroach upon one another, and none serve as lord and subject.

The distinction of lord and subject is like Heaven’s height and Earth’s lowness—when placed in their proper stations, the true lord allows them to be thus of themselves, not through artifice. All who attain their true nature and employ their spontaneity—whether knowing or not—are naturally thus. Yet the knowing guard their knowledge to the end, while the foolish cling to their folly until death. Adversity and good fortune intersect; each trusts in their own bias and indulges their conduct, none able to turn back. This, compared to what most people lament, is also lamentable. Yet they have never taken this as lamentable, for it is the nature of their spontaneity. Each thing is so by nature—what thing is worthy of lament?

Yet a lifetime of toil and struggle, weariness and exhaustion—though alive, one is in truth the same as dead. This is the greatest sorrow, yet people have never taken it as sorrow. Thus all that is lamented is not truly lamentable.

*[Lü’s Commentary: The spacious and distinct clarify the differences between great and small measure.]*

Sleep and wakefulness intertwine, yet their weave differs—some loose, some tight, some hidden, some dense. Likes and dislikes lie within, and when things strike them, their release is like the trigger of a crossbow. Fame and principle stand without, and when things draw them, their clinging is like a sworn oath. Thus their inclinations and aversions diverge. Their decline is like autumn and winter’s advent—none can restore the yang; thus their desires vary in depth. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, coquetry and ease, openness and poise—each emotion’s form and manifestation differ.

All these are the myriad breaths, each distinct, yet each left to itself. Like music emerging from emptiness or mushrooms forming from steam, day and night succeed one another, none knowing their origin—such is the Heavenly Pipe, the work of non-action. The differences in vessels’ size, in inclinations and aversions, in divergence and convergence—are these not like the varied shapes of caves and hollows? The distinctions in composure and agitation, joy and anger, sorrow and delight, in the forms of emotions—are these not like the diverse cries of the wind through gaping mouths? Music emerging from emptiness, mushrooms forming from steam—seeking their origin, one finds nothing. Are these not like the wind passing through hollows, now murmuring, now whistling, yet none knowing where it goes?

Viewed thus, where lies the "I" that makes me myself? Where is the form that is not like withered wood? Where is the heart that is not like dead ashes? The Heavenly Pipe is hard to know; the True Lord is hard to see. Only by losing oneself in serene oblivion and aligning the heart with it can one attain this. Morning and evening, one finds the source of life—knowing that its origin is unknowable, yet aligning the heart with it.

If one cannot grasp its signs or see its form, one cannot discern what moves it. Searching within the bodily frame for what moves it, one finds it was never there. Yet within the bodily frame, if one seeks what moves it and finds nothing, the True Lord is present—this much is knowable. All people possess the True Lord, yet none seek to know its nature, neither adding to nor diminishing it. Why? It cannot be attained by the mind’s nearness, nor can it be grasped by the mind’s distance.

*[New Tradition: Great knowledge and small knowledge, grand words and petty words—all fear the burdens of form, whether in sleep or wakefulness. With form, one is enslaved by transformation; enslaved by transformation, one experiences movement and stillness differently. This is why one remains bound. How much better to be formless, so that transformation cannot enslave! Only the spirit can partake in this.]*

*[Xu Xi: What has drowned them cannot be restored. The three "之" are empty words, indicating that their past inclinations, once drowned in intent, cannot be made to return. A ditch now full, now dry—merely saying "dry" does not convey how easily it was once filled. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight—here, sorrow and anger are depicted through "anxiety, sighing, change, and dread," while joy and delight are shown through "coquetry, ease, openness, and poise." "Openness" is the spirit’s release; "poise" is its bearing. Joy and delight are like music resonating in empty space, boundlessly unobstructed. What is pent-up is like yin qi congealing into mushrooms—all is spontaneous.]*

*[Xun’s Edition: Joy, anger, sorrow, delight, anxiety, sighing, change, dread, coquetry, ease, openness, poise—these seven emotions are here expanded into twelve variations. "Dread" (慹) combines "grasp" and "heart," signifying a heart that clings. "Coquetry" (姚) means allure; "ease" (佚), indulgence; "openness" (启), the awakening of intelligence; "poise" (态), demeanor. Xunzi’s line—"None fail to be beautiful, alluring, and adorned in their blood, qi, and bearing"—follows the same structure.]*

*[Guan’s Insight: Anxiety is premeditation of the future; sighing is lament for the past. Change is restlessness with purpose; dread is fear that inhibits action. Coquetry is self-indulgent beauty; ease is heedless abandon. Openness is the heart’s receptivity to things; poise is arrogance and haughtiness. Those who chase things and forget themselves exhibit these varied states within a single body. Calculating gains and losses, they are like scorching fire and congealing ice—body and heart both waste away daily, nearing death.]*

*[Secondary Ink: Below, the text depicts the heart’s shifting states, paralleling the earlier passage on wind and wood’s sounds. It guards against grand knowledge. "Spacious and distinct" (闲闲) aligns with Mencius’ "The wise act without contrivance." "Narrow and rigid" (间间) sets boundaries, dividing self and other—this is merely the knowledge of petty men. "Blazing brilliance" (炎炎) illuminates above; "babbling uniformity" (詹詹) aligns front and back. "Loose" (缦) is unhurried, gentle; "hidden" (窖), a concealed mechanism, treacherous. "Dense" (密) is meticulous, petty. "Anxious" (惴惴) is a heart ill at ease; "listless" (缦缦), scattered and self-doubting. Those who arbitrate right and wrong are litigious sorts, aiming for the vital point—like a crossbow’s trigger, cunning. Those who cling to victory are obstinate, like an oath’s unyielding hold—stubborn. Petty knowledge’s heart contends thus; innate truth fades daily, fading further, until the heart dies unawares. Thus it says, "Their decline is like autumn and winter," describing daily decay. "Drowned and submerged, it cannot be retrieved"—thus it says, "What has drowned them cannot be restored." Drowning and decline correspond; such scheming deepens with age. Thus it says, "Old ditches, sated and sealed"—like the *Great Learning*’s "sated and sealed." If the heart is not dead, there remains life’s vitality, like spring’s return. But this near-dead heart—can it restore the yang? It cannot. This exhaustively describes petty knowledge’s heart. Below, twelve words depict its interactions with things. Yet even so, it is not free—like music emerging from emptiness, now sounding, now ceasing; like steam forming mushrooms, now living, now dying, day and night succeeding one another. Yet none knows their origin—this is the "myriad breaths, each distinct." Who stirs them? Alas! Alas!]*

"From dawn to dusk, do we obtain this—what gives rise to life? The word *already* here is the *who* in 'Who stirs them?' Below, it is not that there is no self without that other; it now replaces this word with *that*, saying: if I am not that, then I cannot complete myself. If I reject or accept the other, then that too cannot manifest itself. Like wind departing from the hollow—it never forms sound. Such an argument about creation seems nearly apt.

Yet why does it fail to grasp its traces? It says: not knowing what causes it. If there were a true master yet it could not grasp its traces—read this as one phrase. One would only seek its traces if the true master had form. Now, the true master makes each person act spontaneously, and people likewise believe in it. Thus it says: 'It can be practiced and believed.' Only because its form is unseen are no traces to be found.

Though the true master has sentiment, it has no form; one must recognize it through the formed. Thus it speaks of the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera—there is self-interest in them. Is there a true lord residing within? The two *yan* and three *hu* are all interrogative particles, repeatedly questioning to urge deep reflection and personal realization. To seek and grasp its sentiment is to have sentiment without form—this sentiment neither benefits nor harms its truth. This truth is the truth of the true lord and true master; this truth originally neither benefits nor harms people. Only when deluded does one become ordinary; when awakened, one becomes sagely." *Human life—*

Firm indeed is this obscurity—yet am I alone obscure while others are not? If one follows the heart already formed and takes it as teacher, who then is without a teacher? Why must there be knowledge and succession when the heart naturally grasps things? Even the foolish share in this. Before the heart is formed, is there right and wrong? This is like arriving in Yue today yet having reached it yesterday. Thus to take nonbeing as being—though even the divine Yu could not comprehend it, how then should I fare?

Speech is not like the wind’s blowing. Those who speak have something to say, yet what they say remains unsettled. Is there truly speech, or has there never been speech? Do they deem it different from the fledgling’s chirp? Is there distinction, or is there no distinction?

Where does the Dao conceal itself to produce truth and falsehood? Where does speech conceal itself to produce right and wrong? Where does the Dao go and yet not exist? Where does speech exist yet remain unutterable? Concealed in petty accomplishments, speech is concealed in flourishing splendor. Hence arise the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. If one wishes to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, nothing surpasses clarity.

Nothing is not "that," nothing is not "this." From "that," one does not see; by knowing oneself, one knows. Thus it is said: "That" emerges from "this," and "this" likewise depends on "that"—"that" and "this" arise together. Yet even as they arise, they die; even as they die, they arise. Even as they affirm, they negate; even as they negate, they affirm. Therefore the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates it in Heaven—this too is dependence. "This" is also "that," and "that" is also "this."

Is that also one right and wrong, and is this also one right and wrong? Is there truly "that" and "this"? Or is there truly no "that" and "this"? Where "that" and "this" find no counterpart, this is called the *pivot of the Dao*. Only when one attains the pivot at the center of the ring can one respond to the inexhaustible. "This" too is inexhaustible, and "not-this" too is inexhaustible. Thus it is said: nothing surpasses clarity.

For all things are boundless and obscure—this is the realm where knowing is self-subsistent, where one’s own understanding stands in place of another’s. (Alternatively: where succession and change occur. The wind’s sound is the *lai*, the chirp of a fledgling breaking from its shell. The pivot is the essential point.) Guo Xiang’s commentary: Now, those who know do not know *how* they know, yet know of themselves; those who live do not know *how* they live, yet live of themselves. Though the myriad things differ, in that life does not arise from knowing, none are not the same. Thus the world is boundless and obscure. That by which the mind suffices to govern the body’s functions is called the *completed mind*. If one takes one’s completed mind as one’s teacher, then each person has their own teacher. Since each has their own teacher, one may entrust things to them, and they will naturally be fitting.

To use what is completed to replace what is not completed is not true knowing—it is merely the mind attaining itself. Thus even the foolish take their completed mind as their teacher, unwilling to employ what they deem deficient while discarding what they deem sufficient. If today one travels to Yue, how did one arrive there yesterday? Before the mind is completed, how does the clarity of right and wrong arise? Right and wrong are what the multitude cannot be without, so the perfected person accords with both. Those who are deluded by right and wrong take what is not as what is. Once the deluded mind is formed, even the sage cannot dispel it, so one entrusts it to its own nature without forcing knowledge.

Words each have their own basis, hence they differ from the wind’s sound. I deem this right, while another deems it wrong; what another deems right, I deem wrong—thus nothing is settled. That nothing is settled arises from the partiality of "that" and "this." If one claims there are words, this is not yet sufficient to settle anything; if one claims there are no words, one already relies on words. Words and the chirp of fledglings share the same end. Whether there is debate or no debate cannot truly be settled. The feelings of the world need not be the same, yet their words cannot differ, so right and wrong are in tumult, and none know what is settled.

Where is the Dao not present? Why would words conceal it, giving rise to names of truth and falsity, right and wrong? Petty accomplishments and flourishing splendor conceal themselves from the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be concealed. Thus truth and falsity, right and wrong arise in flourishing splendor and cease at what is fitting; they appear in petty accomplishments and vanish in great wholeness. The Confucians and Mohists alternately affirm and negate each other, each prizing their own views. To have right and wrong is what the Confucians and Mohists affirm; to have no right and no wrong is what they negate. If one wishes to affirm what they negate and negate what they affirm, one must clarify the absence of right and wrong. To clarify the absence of right and wrong, nothing surpasses using the Confucians and Mohists to mutually illuminate each other. Through mutual illumination, one knows that what they affirm is not right and what they negate is not wrong.

All things deem themselves right, so none are not right; all things deem others wrong, so none are not wrong. If none are not wrong, then the world has no right; if none are not right, then the world has no wrong. Without wrong and without right, this is called *mysterious sameness*. All things do not see what others see but know only what they themselves know. Knowing only what they themselves know, they deem themselves right; deeming themselves right, they deem others wrong. Thus it is said: "That" emerges from "this," and "this" likewise depends on "that"—"that" and "this" arise together.

The transformations of life and death are like the progression of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer. Though the states of life and death differ, in that each is content with its lot, they are one. Now, the living deem life as life and death as death, so there is no life; the living deem death as death and the dead deem death as life, so there is no death. Without life and without death, without right and without wrong, the debates of the Confucians and Mohists are what I cannot agree with. As for each obscuring their own portion, this is what I cannot differ from. Thus the sage accords with the world’s right and wrong yet is without right and wrong. Therefore, not proceeding by the path of right and wrong, right and wrong are never inappropriate—one simply illuminates their natural Heaven and does not impose upon them.

"This" is also "that," and I too am what "that" deems "that." "That" too deems itself right, so "that" and "this," being and non-being, are not yet settled. They are counterparts. "That" and "this" stand in opposition, yet the sage accords with both, so the mindless one guards things without ever having an opposite in the world. The pivot is the essential point. Abiding in the pivot, guarding the mysterious extremity, one responds to the boundless. Right and wrong follow one another in endless recurrence, thus it is called the *ring*. The center of the ring is empty. If one takes right and wrong as the ring and attains its center, one has no right and no wrong. Without right and wrong, one can respond; since right and wrong are inexhaustible, one’s response is also inexhaustible. The world deems itself right and others wrong, so one right and one wrong proceed endlessly. Only one who traverses the empty and attains the center is vast and without attachment, riding it in wandering.

Lu Huiqing’s commentary: The Dao is nowhere absent, so words are nothing but the Dao. Why would words conceal it, giving rise to right and wrong? Since things are nothing but the Dao, words too are the Dao. Why would words conceal it, giving rise to right and wrong? Since the Dao is nowhere absent, where does it not abide? Since words are nothing but the Dao, where do they not abide? Yet there are places where they do not abide and cannot—this is because the Dao is concealed in petty accomplishments, and one does not know great wholeness; words are concealed in flourishing splendor, and one does not know their root and substance. Hence arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists.

If one wishes to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, nothing surpasses clarity. Clarity means returning to one’s mandate and knowing constancy. Now, the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists do not depart from knowledge and perception, yet they have never employed clarity. Thus they are insufficient to be the standard of right and wrong. If one relinquishes knowledge and turns the light of awareness back to clarity, then what things call "that" and "this" truly have no fixed substance. Without fixed substance, there is nothing that is not "that," nothing that is not "this." From the perspective of the Dao, when things are in the process of arising, where does life come from? When in the process of dying, where does death go? Knowing the oneness of life and death, then the process of arising is the very process of dying, and the process of dying is the very process of arising. Right and wrong, affirmation and negation—all are the same.

Likewise, all these are fabrications of our own minds. Exhausting the mind and plumbing the spirit, one returns to the state of "no-self," and then their essence has never differed. Thus, "this" follows from "that," and "that" follows from "this," alternating in function—nothing more.

Following the root: Speech is not the blowing of the wind. When people speak, their words are not like the *tianlai* that blows through the myriad things with no mind. Speech arises from humans, yet they cannot be without mind, so their words remain unsettled and cannot serve as a standard. Since words are unsettled, others perceive them as if they were nothing. Thus, one may ask: do words truly exist, or have they never existed? When a fledgling bird first emerges from its egg, people hear its cries—if it is a magpie, they herald good fortune; if a crow, they foretell misfortune. The crane’s call foretells rain, the cuckoo’s urges plowing; these sounds can serve as standards. But the fledgling’s cry is not yet fixed, so it cannot be a standard. Human speech, when unsettled, is no different.

Xu Xi: Speech is not the blowing of the wind; it is not like the emotionless gusts. There must be meaning in it, yet what is meant remains unsettled. I deem it "this," while another deems it "that"—thus the debates of the world begin. Yet from the perspective of the enlightened, how is this different from the fledgling’s cry in the ear? Does it truly matter?

Jingchuan: The blowing arises naturally; speech, however, is intentional. Thus, it is said that "speech is not the blowing." Clarity is great wisdom. With luminous insight, one penetrates both self and other, and there is no "this" or "that." Yet things have "this" and "that," hence it is said: "Nothing is not 'that,' nothing is not 'this.'" It is self-generated. Because there is "that," one becomes obscured and cannot see; through wisdom, one comes to know it. "This" and "that" are to be understood through the characters *bi* (彼, that) and *ci* (此, this). They pertain to existence, yet they have never truly existed. Illuminated by the light of Heaven—Heaven being the state of neither "this" nor "that"—then clarity emerges. Only when there is neither "this" nor "that" can "this" and "that" be dissolved.

A humble view: Fan Wuyin said, "Before the mind is formed, true nature is undivided, its vastness equal to the empty sky. Once the mind is formed, it departs from nature, and there is good and evil."

In the midst of worldly interactions, one cannot avoid the formation of the mind. Yet when this occurs, one should model oneself on the state before its formation—then good and evil do not arise, right and wrong leave no trace, and what is there that cannot be harmonized? For a person, halting a thought is not difficult; the challenge lies in preventing its continuation. If, from the very moment the mind forms, one models oneself on the state before its formation, thoughts will not persist, and one’s nature may be restored. Thus, when facing things, the mind arises; when things are forgotten, nature manifests. The mind is like departing fire—fire cannot take shape on its own but must cling to something. If the mind is like the empty sky, it has nothing to cling to. Moreover, when the mind clings to things and acts with goodness, it is still inferior to having no mind and no action—how much worse when it clings to things and acts with evil?

Guan Yinzi said: "What comes to me is like the flash of flint and steel. Responding with one’s nature, things drift lightly away." This is the essential method of relinquishing things, departing from the human, gathering emotions, and returning to nature. Those who "know in place of" and "take for themselves with the mind" refer precisely to those who follow their own minds, using knowledge to replace the Dao and thus forming the mind.

*Brush Strokes* states: "That does not arise on its own; because of this, there is that. This does not arise on its own; because of that, there is this." Thus it is said: "That arises from this, and this also arises from that." Both emerge from nothing into being—this is what is meant by the "incipience of arising." Yet arising is paired with perishing, and perishing with arising. Only when there is being can there be non-being; only when there is non-being can there be being. These are matched pairs of affirmation and negation—this is the way of humanity, not of Heaven. The sage does not follow this but illuminates it through Heaven, standing transcendent beyond the bounds of right and wrong, roaming alone with the Creator. How could this be compared to those in the world whose opinions run rampant?

Even the sage does not discard right and wrong in this context, for what the world deems right, he deems right; what the world deems wrong, he deems wrong—no more than this. The character *yin* (因, "because") is the key safeguard of Laozi and Zhuangzi, hence the following text repeatedly responds to it. Knowing this, then this is that, and that is this; the right and wrong of that are the right and wrong of this. Is there truly a distinction? Or is there truly no distinction? The mutual seeking of matched pairs cannot be resolved, and the pivot of the Dao lies here.

All things, whether odd or round, are paired with even or square. The ring has no beginning or end, and its center is empty, containing nothing—this resembles one who has grasped the pivot of the Dao. Thus it is said: "Attain its ring’s center to respond to the endless." For one who travels the endless paths of right and wrong, the state of neither right nor wrong remains unchanged. Without illuminating it through Heaven, this cannot be achieved—hence the saying: "Nothing is better than clarity."

Using a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. Using a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse. Is this acceptable? Or is it unacceptable?

To speak of "that by which things are so" is not as good as to affirm their being so; to speak of "that by which things are not so" is not as good as to affirm their not being so. Things inherently have that which makes them so; things inherently have that which makes them acceptable. There is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not acceptable. Thus, whether it be a stalk or a pillar, a leper or Xi Shi, the grotesque, the strange, the deceptive, or the bizarre—all are subsumed into the One. Their division is their completion; their completion is their destruction. Yet all things, without completion or destruction, are again subsumed into the One. Only the enlightened know that all are subsumed into the One. For this reason, they do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary. The ordinary is the function; function is the penetration; penetration is the attainment. Attaining it, one is nearly there. Following this, one rests without knowing why it is so—this is called the Dao. To exhaust one’s spirit in striving to unify without knowing their sameness is called "morning three." What is "morning three"? A monkey-keeper distributed acorns, saying, "Three in the morning and four in the evening." The monkeys were all enraged. He then said, "Then four in the morning and three in the evening." The monkeys were all pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this too is an example. Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the Heavenly balance. This is called "walking two paths."

The pillar is a column; *lì* is ugliness—one says it is leprosy. *Huī*, *dà*, *guǐ*, *lì*, *jué*: vast, perverse, twisted, deviant, strange, and bizarre. The *jūgōng* is one who keeps monkeys. *Xù* are acorns. "Three in the morning and four in the evening" means three *shēng* in the morning and four *shēng* in the evening.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
That one takes oneself as right and others as wrong is the common tendency of the world. Thus, if I use my finger to illustrate another’s finger, then that finger, from the perspective of my finger, is not a finger. This is using a finger to illustrate the non-finger-ness of a finger. If, however, one reverses the analogy and uses that finger to illustrate my finger, then my finger, from the perspective of that finger, is also not a finger. This is using a non-finger to illustrate the non-finger-ness of a finger. To clarify the absence of right and wrong, nothing is better than mutual illustration. Through mutual illustration, that and this are both identical in their self-affirmation and equal in their mutual negation. Equal in mutual negation, then the world has no right; identical in self-affirmation, then the world has no wrong. For if right were truly right, then the world could not also have those who deem it wrong. If wrong were truly wrong, then the world could not also have those who deem it right. Now, with right and wrong lacking any fixed ground, they become confused and chaotic. This shows that these petty distinctions merely reflect each side clinging to its own bias, converging in their duality. Looking up and down, nothing is not like this. Therefore, the perfected person knows that Heaven and Earth are one finger, and the myriad things are one horse. Thus, in vast and boundless tranquility, each abides in its place, identical in self-attainment, without right or wrong.

What is acceptable to oneself is called acceptable; what is unacceptable to oneself is called unacceptable. The Dao accomplishes all things without anything it does not accomplish; each thing is as it is, each acceptable as it is acceptable. The stalk is horizontal, the pillar vertical; *lì* is ugly, Xishi beautiful—what is meant by "equalizing" is surely not equalizing forms or conforming to the same compass and square. Thus, whether vertical or horizontal, beautiful or ugly, vast or perverse, twisted or strange, each is as it is, each acceptable as it is acceptable. Though forms differ in ten thousand ways, their natures share the same attainment. Hence it is said: "The Dao penetrates to become one."

Some things are considered dispersed from this perspective yet complete from that; what I call completion, others may call destruction—all arise from self-regard and failure to see the other. Only the penetrating one is not fixed to one side. Suddenly self-forgotten, they lodge in what is fitting for spontaneous function. In spontaneous function, nothing fails to flow smoothly and attain itself. *Jǐ* means "exhaustive"; the utmost principle is exhausted in self-attainment. The penetrating one follows and does not act, hence it is said, "Following this, one rests." How could they know that following is good and thus follow it? They do not know why they follow and simply follow of themselves. Hence it is called the Dao. The Dao is simply the One. For the penetrating one, how could unifying require exhausting the spirit? If one exhausts the spirit to unify, it is not reliable—no different from those who are not one, merely like the monkeys who affirmed themselves based on what they preferred. Therefore, the sage does not lean toward any one side but entrusts things to their natural balance, halting at "walking two paths"—entrusting the world’s right and wrong to Heaven.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Using a finger to illustrate the non-finger-ness of a finger, desiring to distinguish between small and large in names and food, how could this not arise from the same body and thus fail to be a non-finger? Using a horse to illustrate the non-horse-ness of a horse, though there may be distinctions of coat and speed, how could this depart from the same kind and thus fail to be a non-horse? Only by not following right and wrong but illuminating them through Heaven can one transcend the same body and depart from the same kind—then one is sufficient to determine the world’s true right and wrong. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are no different from one finger, for they are born together with me and share the same body. Though the myriad things are numerous, they are no different from one horse, for they are one with me and share the same kind. Then who determines what is acceptable or unacceptable for things?

The Dao is enacted and thereby accomplished—not accomplished through non-action. Things are named and thereby become so—not inherently so. What they are and what they accept are the very sources of what they are not and what they do not accept. Seeking the one who makes them so, one ultimately finds nothing—thus knowing their fundamental absence. This is how things are equalized. Why pursue or reject among them? Small and large, beauty and ugliness are inherently opposed, but when the Dao penetrates and unifies them, their distinctions become what accomplishes their completion and what accomplishes their destruction. The myriad things have no completion or destruction, returning to become one—only the penetrating one knows that penetrating is one. Thus, I do not act but lodge in the spontaneous function of things. Lodging in things, one penetrates; penetrating, there is nowhere one does not attain oneself. If one does not know this and exhausts the spirit to act, this is precisely what makes one not one.

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
Knowing that beyond the finger there is something that moves it, one knows the finger is not the finger. Knowing that beyond the horse there is something that gallops it, one knows the horse is not the horse. Finger and horse are things with form; non-finger and non-horse are without form. Using what has form to illustrate the formlessness of form is not as good as using what is formless to illustrate the formlessness of form. Then one knows that the movement of Heaven and Earth and the generation of the myriad things all have a separate master. One may seek it beyond Heaven and Earth and the myriad things.

Acceptable or unacceptable, so or not so, vertical or horizontal, beauty or ugliness, vastness or perversity, twistedness or strangeness, right or wrong, completion or destruction—all return to become one, then there is no right and no wrong. Though there is right, one does not use it. *Yōng* is the ordinary; the ordinary is the function without function that becomes penetration. Penetrating, one attains; attaining, one is nearly at the Dao. If at this point one not only ceases to affirm but also ceases to negate, yet still does not know why it is so, and merely seeks to leave form and abandon knowledge as "sitting in forgetfulness," what is this if not exhaustion?

**Shizhang’s Note:**
The *Gongsun Longzi* has the chapters "White Horse" and "Pointing at Things," and it says, "A white horse is not a horse." Zhuangzi likely based his argument on this. Some commentators even interpret "horse" as a counting rod in *bo* and *sai* games—how absurd!

**Bishu:**
Heaven and Earth are vast yet no different from one finger; the myriad things are numerous yet no different from one horse. How much more is man, one thing among Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things? Knowing this, the true substance is vast and empty, right and wrong are entirely extinguished, and one’s Heavenly nature is complete. Yet the sage has no right or wrong and also does not abolish right and wrong—this is called "following." What people find acceptable, one finds acceptable; what people find unacceptable, one finds unacceptable. The Dao is enacted and thereby accomplished; things are named and thereby become so. This is not that I impose "so" on what things are so, nor impose "not so" on what things are not so. In this way, things naturally have what they are and what they accept—there is nothing that is not like this. Why then impose right and wrong among them?

The blade of grass and the pillar stand in opposition, ugliness and Xi Shi stand in opposition, division and completion stand in opposition, success and ruin stand in opposition—yet the utmost in vastness, strangeness, and marvelous transformations all pass through and are unified as one. Without penetrating clarity and profound understanding of the supreme principle, one cannot achieve this. This is what Zhuangzi called "attainment." Not employing, nor being self-employed—it is lodged in the ordinary and follows along. As for man, the ordinary is what man constantly employs, hence it is called "ordinary." *Yong* means "to employ." All things, if not employed, stagnate; if employed, they flow—hence it is called "employing." *Tong* means "to flow." When the Dao reaches flow, it is attained—hence it is called "flow." *De* means "to attain." When attainment is reached, it is near perfection. Yet all of this is entirely encompassed by the single word "following."

Lest the meaning of "following" remain unclear, observe Master Cu’s poem on the taro: it does not increase or decrease of itself but follows the joy and anger of the many monkeys to increase or decrease—what is this if not "following"? Thus, the sage externally follows people and harmonizes with them through right and wrong, while internally rests in the Heavenly balance of neither right nor wrong. Not allowing the existence of right and wrong in traces to obstruct the mind’s absence of right and wrong—this is what is called "dual operation."

The knowledge of the ancients reached a certain point.

How far does it reach? To take "there has never yet been anything" as the ultimate—this is perfection, completion, beyond which nothing can be added. The next level takes "there is something" yet "there has never yet been boundaries." The next takes "there are boundaries" yet "there has never yet been right and wrong." When right and wrong become manifest, the Dao suffers loss. The Dao’s loss is the completion of attachment. Is there truly completion and loss? Or is there truly no completion and loss? Because there is completion and loss, Master Zhao plays the zither. Because there is no completion and loss, Master Zhao does not play the zither. Master Zhao’s zither-playing, Shi Kuang’s tapping his staff, and Huizi’s leaning against the wutong tree—these three were nearly at the height of wisdom, each in their prime. Thus, their deeds were recorded in later years. Yet it was only their fondness for these things that set them apart from others. Their fondness for them sought to illuminate what others could not illuminate, and so they ended in the obscurity of the "hard and white" debate. Their sons, in turn, spent their lives weaving the threads of their fathers’ arts, yet in the end achieved nothing. Can this be called achievement? Even I, too, would have achieved something. Can this not be called achievement? Then neither things nor I achieve anything.

Thus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage avoids. To reject this and instead entrust it to the ordinary—this is called "illuminating through the ordinary." (Master Zhao was an ancient master of the zither. *Zhi* means the bridge of a stringed instrument; *ce* means a staff. To raise the staff and strike the rhythm on the wutong wood of the zither. "Recorded in later years" means their deeds are written down to this day. "Hard and white" refers to the debate over the hardness of stone and the whiteness of a horse. *Lun* means the strings of a zither or se. *Gu* means confusion.)

Guo's Commentary:
To know that there was never a beginning to things is to forget heaven and earth, to leave the myriad things behind, to look without seeing within the cosmos, to be unaware of one’s own body. Thus, one remains vast and unburdened, moving with things and responding to all without obstruction.

To know that there were never boundaries is, though not having forgotten everything, still to forget the distinction between self and other.

To know that there were never right and wrong is, though not having forgotten self and other, still to forget the right and wrong of self and other. When right and wrong become manifest, the Dao is diminished; only without right and wrong is it whole.

When the Dao is diminished, emotions become partial, and love takes form. One has not yet forgotten love or relinquished self-interest, thus failing to merge with the other in profound unity.

Sounds cannot all be enumerated. Thus, though blowing pipes and plucking strings may involve many fingers, many sounds are still missed. Yet those who grasp the flute and sound the reed seek to make sounds manifest. In making sounds manifest, sounds are lost; in not making sounds manifest, sounds remain whole. Thus, to seek completion and thereby diminish it is like Master Zhao striking the zither. Not to seek completion and thus remain undiminished is like Master Zhao not striking the zither. This is near to perfection.

These three masters all sought to clarify what they themselves did not understand, exhausting knowledge, depleting thought, wearing out form, and fatiguing spirit. Some leaned on staffs and dozed, some rested against the wutong tree and closed their eyes, relying on their prime to endure—otherwise, they would have succumbed long ago.

The three masters only cherished what they themselves understood, considering themselves distinct from the crowd, wishing to make the crowd share their own preferences. This is like playing the reed pipes to an ox. Since the other ultimately does not understand, their own arts end in obscurity.

Master Zhao’s son continued his father’s legacy, yet in the end achieved nothing. Though these three masters sought to illuminate others, the others ultimately did not understand. Thus, their lives ended without achievement. If these three can be called accomplished, then my lack of accomplishment can also be called accomplishment. If things all illuminate themselves yet remain unilluminated by others, and if this lack of illumination is called failure, then all things together achieve nothing.

Therefore, the sage does not display this to dazzle that, nor abandons the self to pursue things. Instead, they follow and entrust each to its own capacity, thus achieving all things in their particularity without omission.

Now, these three masters sought to make their own preferences clearly known to others—is this not delusion? The sage is without self, thus avoiding the dazzling confusion of doubt by setting boundaries, and unifying the strange and wondrous, allowing each difference to rest in its own place. The crowd does not lose what is right for them, yet the self is not employed by things, and the use of the myriad things is fully realized.

If all things are self-using, then who is right and who is wrong? Thus, though the changes of extravagance and the strangeness of the peculiar may vary endlessly, by following and entrusting them to their own use, their uses, though myriad, are clearly self-evident.

Lü's Commentary:
The Dao is present in all things, thus there is nothing that is not the Dao. If nothing is not the Dao, then there is nothing outside the Dao. This is how the ancients could speak of there never having been things, for they could encounter things and embody the Dao.

To know and stop at this is perfection. Next are those who believe in things but not yet in boundaries, who cannot encounter things as the Dao but can use the Dao to penetrate things. Then there are those who believe in boundaries but not yet in right and wrong, who cannot use the Dao to penetrate things but can leave things behind to merge with the Dao. Though the knowledge of these two is not yet fully good in relation to the Dao, it remains undiminished.

It is only when right and wrong become manifest that the Dao is diminished. When the Dao is diminished, emotions arise, and love takes form.

Yet from the perspective of the enlightened, was there ever truly a beginning to things? How could there be completion or diminution? Master Zhao’s zither playing, Shi Kuang’s staff, and Hui Zi’s leaning against the wutong tree nearly grasped the meaning of completion and diminution. If this can be called accomplishment, then lack of accomplishment is also accomplishment. If this cannot be called accomplishment, then neither things nor I ultimately accomplish anything. Why exhaust the mind over completion and diminution, seeking to call it accomplishment?

---

Zhao's Commentary:
Master Zhao’s zither playing was understood only by Shi Kuang; Hui Zi’s debates were grasped only by Zhuangzi. Each of the three masters attained the subtleties, yet not playing, not listening, not debating—this is what they did not know. Thus, Zhuangzi followed them, saying that what he understood differed from theirs. They sought to clarify what was insufficiently clear, yet even with the full force of the "hard and white" and "same and different" debates, they ended in obscurity and lack of understanding. Like Master Zhao’s son, who did not know the profundity of the zither without strings, they ended without accomplishment.

If this is called accomplishment, it can also be called lack of accomplishment—neither depends on its true nature. Thus, clarity emerges from the midst of confusion and doubt, which is what the sage values.

Oral Explanation:
This passage indeed speaks of the beginning before heaven and earth, yet to grasp this principle, one need only look before one’s eyes. For example, before a thought arises, there is "never a beginning to things." Once a thought arises, there are things. From this thought come things and self, which is the existence of boundaries. From things and self come likes and dislikes, joy and anger, which is the existence of right and wrong.

If one cannot return to the time before a thought arises but only sees the entanglement in one’s heart, this is the diminution of the Dao and the formation of love. Yet when this thought passes, all is as it was—where is there truly completion or diminution? If one can realize this, it is all a direct and personal experience.

Now, let me say something here: is it similar to this or not? If similarity and dissimilarity are themselves considered similar, then there is no difference from that.

Though this be so, let me attempt to speak of it.

There is "having a beginning." There is "never having had a beginning." There is "never having had that which never had a beginning." There is "having existence." There is "having non-existence." There is "never having had non-existence." There is "never having had that which never had non-existence." Suddenly, there is existence and non-existence—but who can know whether existence or non-existence is truly existent or non-existent?

Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know whether what I have called it truly has speech or truly lacks speech. In all the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. Nothing is longer-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. Heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since we have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. From this point onward, even the most skilled mathematician cannot reckon it—how much less the ordinary person!

Thus, from non-existence proceeding to existence, one reaches three—how much more so from existence proceeding to existence! Proceed nowhere from this.

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
Now, to speak of having no right or wrong—do we not know whether this is similar to having speech or not? If we call it similar, then I take non-existence as right while they take non-existence as wrong—this is not similarity. Yet even this, though right and wrong differ, is not free from having right and wrong, and thus is similar to that. Therefore, it is said: similarity and dissimilarity themselves considered similar—then there is no difference from that.

If one wishes to be greatly dissimilar to that, nothing surpasses having no mind. First, discard right and wrong; then discard the discarding. Discard it again and again until there is no discarding—then there is no discarding and nothing not discarded, and right and wrong depart of themselves.

Let me attempt to speak of it: the ultimate principle is without speech, yet speech is inevitably dissimilar. To speak of "having a beginning" is to acknowledge that speech must have an end. "Never having had a beginning" means there is no end or beginning, and life and death are one. "Never having had that which never had a beginning" means that to speak of oneness is not as good as forgetting oneness and naturally becoming equal—this is to forget even that oneness.

"Having existence" means beauty and ugliness, right and wrong, are all present. "Having non-existence" means one does not yet know that there is no non-existence, and right and wrong, likes and dislikes, still linger in the heart. "Never having had non-existence" means one knows there is no non-existence, yet still cannot be without knowing. "Never having had that which never had non-existence"—suddenly, there is existence and non-existence, yet one does not know which is truly existent or non-existent. This is to forget all knowing. Only then does one suddenly realize there is nothing at all. Realizing nothingness, heaven and earth, the myriad things, self and other, right and wrong—all are suddenly and completely clear.

"I have already spoken" means that to speak of having no right or wrong is itself to have speech again. Not knowing whether what I have called it truly has speech or truly lacks it—only then is the heart utterly free of the slightest obstruction.

In terms of form and appearance, Mount Tai is greater than an autumn hair. But if each possesses its own nature and things reach their limit, then great form is not excessive, and small form is not insufficient. If each is sufficient in its nature, then an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, and Mount Tai is not merely great in its greatness. If sufficiency of nature is considered greatness, then nothing in the world is more sufficient than an autumn hair. If sufficiency of nature is not considered greatness, then even Mount Tai may be called small. If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great. If an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Without small or great, without long-lived or short-lived—thus the mayfly does not envy the great *chun* tree but rejoices in its own contentment; the sparrow does not value the heavenly pond but delights in its own sufficiency. If one is sufficient in Heaven’s nature and at peace with one’s allotted portion, then even heaven and earth are not long-lived enough to surpass me, and the myriad things are not different enough to be separate from me.

The myriad things and myriad forms are self-sufficient, and thus one is already one. The principle requires no speech, but some things cannot clarify their oneness on their own and thus pursue one another with this. To speak of one in order to correct them is already to have speech. Yet to speak of one with speech is not one, so one and speech make two. One is already one, and speech makes it two—can this not be called three? To speak of one with one word still results in three—how much more so when tracing its branches and streams, where the names of ordinary things are beyond counting! Thus, those who speak of one are not different from that, while those who forget one are without speech and naturally one.

Therefore, resting in what one is capable of—this is the most correct.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary:
People cannot let go of self and other, forget right and wrong, and reach "never having had things" because they do not know the origin of the mind of self and other, right and wrong. To grasp this principle, one must observe it from its beginning. Thus, it is said: "There is having a beginning." The beginning originally had no source, but once there is this beginning, it has a source. It is also said: "Never having had a beginning"—this is to discard its source. Yet discarding it does not remove what is discarded; it merely avoids having a source. It is further said: "Never having had that which never had a beginning"—this is to discard the discarding. With no source and no discarding, the arising of my mind is suddenly understood, and one knows that what exists now all emerges from nothingness.

Only by knowing this can life and death be in my hands. If I wish nothing to arise, it does not arise. Seeking its beginning is impossible, and seeking its nothingness is also impossible—thus enlightenment comes in an instant, naturally fitting together. Therefore, it is said: suddenly, there is existence and non-existence, yet one does not know which is truly existent or non-existent.

Let scholars forget words and grasp it with the mind. Though this be so, what I have now spoken is also "never having had things"—whether it has speech or lacks speech, how can I know? Let scholars know that speech has never truly had words.

Only by knowing the origin of my mind’s arising do the tip of an autumn hair, Mount Tai, a child who dies young, Pengzu, and even heaven and earth and the myriad things—none arise apart from this. Then small and great, long and short—how can they have a constant form? With self, there is heaven and earth; without self, there are no myriad things. Thus, heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.

*Bishu*:
"Proceed nowhere from this" means that to speak of proceeding from non-existence to existence is to recognize the wind stirring the waves, turning endlessly without cease—being this, being that, ultimately without resolution. "Proceeding nowhere" means proceeding from having no destination. Proceeding to nothingness, there is no right or wrong, yet one takes others’ right and wrong as one’s own right and wrong. Therefore, it is said: "proceed from this." This phrase appears several times in the text, and commentators all err in their interpretations because they do not know that "is" is a particle and read it together with "from."

The Dao has never had boundaries, and words have never had fixed forms—yet by affirming "this," divisions arise.

Let me speak of these divisions:
There is left and right,
There are hierarchies and righteousness,
There are distinctions and debates,
There are competitions and conflicts—
These are called the Eight Virtues.
Beyond the Six Directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss;
Within the Six Directions, the sage discusses but does not deliberate.
The *Spring and Autumn* orders the world, embodying the intent of the former kings—
The sage deliberates but does not dispute.
Thus, what is divided also remains undivided;
What is debated also remains undebated.
Why is this?
The sage holds it within, while the multitude debates to display to one another.
Thus, it is said: what is debated also remains unseen.

The great Dao is not called "great,"
Great debate does not speak,
Great benevolence is not benevolent,
Great integrity is not modest,
Great courage does not harm.
When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao;
When words are debated, they fall short;
When benevolence is constant, it does not succeed;
When integrity is pure, it is not trusted;
When courage is harmful, it does not prevail.
These five, though rounded, nearly approach squareness.

Thus, to know where to stop in what one does not know is perfection.
Who knows the debate that does not speak,
The Dao that is not the Dao?
If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse—
Poured into but never filled,
Drawn from but never exhausted,
Yet one does not know its source.
This is called "preserving the light."

Thus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun:
"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao. Why do I remain unsettled when facing south?"
Shun replied: "Those three lords still dwell among the weeds and mugwort. Why are you unsettled?
In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, illuminating all things—
How much more so when virtue advances?"

The three states—Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao—are named thus: Zong is one, Kuai two, and Xu’ao three.

Guo’s commentary:
The Dao has never had boundaries, yet there is nowhere it is not present. It has never had fixed distinctions of "this" or "that," right or wrong. To impose divisions upon it is to deny the Dao’s boundlessness, for all things freely inhabit their own domains. "Left" and "right" refer to differing conveniences; "order" and "propriety" mean that each thing has its principle, each affair its fitting course. "Differentiation" is the division and distinction among groups. "Competition" is the pursuit of the same goal; "contention" is the dispute in debate. These eight virtues lie beyond the six directions—beyond the inherent nature of the myriad things.

Though principles exist even beyond the nature of things, they do not pertain to what lies within their inherent nature and thus never move the sage. Therefore, the sage never discusses them. To do so would be to lead things to learn what they cannot. Thus, the sage does not debate what lies beyond the eight boundaries, allowing all to find harmony in their own attainment.

To discourse without deliberation is to set forth their nature and let them rest in it. To deliberate without contention is to follow their completed traces, modeling the ultimate appropriateness without clinging to one’s own rightness, unlike the common people.

"Undivided division" and "uncontended contention" mean that each thing divides itself, each affair distinguishes itself, yet those who insist on imposing their own distinctions fail to see how things distinguish themselves. To "cherish" is to hold fast to non-contention. The sage harbors nothing. Contention arises from not seeing how things contend themselves, so one argues from what one knows to show others.

"Not naming" is to leave things to name themselves, without imposing names. "Not speaking" means things distinguish themselves. "Not benevolent" means existing without attachment, self-sustaining. "Not modest" means being utterly sufficient—things come and go, yet it is not I who acts, so there is no place for modesty or fullness.

"Not envious" means going nowhere without accord, thus able to traverse no peril without going. "Dao illuminated but not Dao" is to use this to clarify that, where both this and that are lost. "Words eloquent but insufficient" means unable to reach what distinguishes itself.

"Benevolence constant but unfulfilled" means things have no constant love; constant love cannot be all-encompassing. "Integrity pure but untrusted" means forced purity and clarity are but the greed for reputation, not true integrity. "Courage envious but unprevailing" means envious, contrary courage is detested by all under heaven, leaving no ground to stand.

These five all injure what is fitting through deliberate action. One cannot cease from this.

Seeking externals from one’s original nature is endless. Yet the external cannot be sought—pursuing it is like trying to square the circle or envying fish for birds. The nearer one draws, the farther it recedes; the more one learns, the more one’s nature is lost. Thus, when things are equalized, the burden of partial preferences vanishes.

What lies beyond knowing belongs to the realm outside one’s nature; therefore, one halts within what is known and arrives at the utmost. "Eloquence without words" and "the Dao that is not the Dao" are the boundless, all-embracing spontaneity. "Neither full nor exhausted" describes the heart-mind of the perfected person, like a mirror that reflects without storing—vast and free from the fluctuations of fullness or emptiness.

"Not knowing whence it comes" speaks of the arrival of the utmost principle, naturally and without trace. "Preserving light" means allowing it to shine of itself, so its radiance is never obscured. To desire to conquer the three states yet feel unresolved is to have not yet attained the Dao of tranquil compliance; thus, one remains uneasy even while attending court.

The question arising from wonder is posed to lodge the principle of luminous equality in the great sage. For what beings find peaceful is not base—even mugwort and artemisia are the wondrous abode of the Three Masters. Why, then, this unresolved feeling? When double brightness ascends the heavens, the six directions are all illumined, with no mugwort or artemisia left unenlightened. Though the sun and moon shine without partiality, there are still places they do not reach; virtue, however, misses nothing.

Yet now, to seize the aspirations of mugwort and artemisia and force them to follow one’s own path toward the utmost Dao—how could this be fitting? Thus, the unease lingers, a matter of spiritual discernment. If beings flow freely in their nature, each resting in what it finds peaceful, whether distant or near, hidden or deep, left to itself, all attain their utmost. Then nothing is amiss for them, and nothing is not joyful for me.

**Zhao’s Annotation:**
To know where to halt in what one does not know is to be beyond naming—this is the perfection of the Dao. If one can grasp this, one’s center is empty, hence called the "Celestial Storehouse," the source from which all things emerge.

"Not full, not exhausted" means without limit or end. "Not knowing whence it comes" is to cast off even that knowledge. "Preserving light" speaks of naturally concealing one’s brightness.

Following the root: *"Great integrity is not content"*—*qiàn* (嗛) here means "to hold in the mouth," implying the mind clings to something. Some cling to satisfaction and sufficiency; others cling to resentment and lack. This speaks of "not being content in integrity," for one does not take integrity as self-sufficiency.

**Supplementary Annotation:**
What *Zhuangzi* calls "the judgments of things" refers generally to the Hundred Schools and their various arts. Each school holds its own views, yet none communicate with the others—right and wrong, this and that, diverge along separate paths, their myriad concerns impossible to exhaust. It is like the wind passing through mountains and forests, where sounds differ, or like the limbs and organs of a single body, each serving its distinct function. The phrase *"blowing in ten thousand different ways"* means these differences arise naturally, not through the power of mere judgments to create division.

If one allows things to follow their nature without engaging in debate, then the judgments of things become equal. Yet there exists in heaven and earth a kind of fundamental principle—discourse on it cannot be omitted, nor can it be lumped together with the Hundred Schools and their arts. Thus, the text adds these two sections, from *"Beyond the Six Directions"* to *"preserving light,"* to clarify that the teachings of sages and saints differ from those of other schools. This distinction is perfectly clear in the author’s mind; it simply remains unarticulated.

**Brush Notes:**
The Dao has no boundaries; words have no constancy. Why, then, would the sage despise boundaries or constancy? It is because they establish divisions of right and wrong. Left and right, ethical norms, distinctions, debates, and contentions—these eight are all called *"boundaries."* The sage preserves them without discussion, discusses without debate, debates without contention, and thus transcends the realm of right and wrong—how could boundaries arise?

Yet the sage does not merely avoid discussion, debate, or contention to be free of boundaries. Even when the sage sometimes discusses or debates, this cannot be called a boundary. The sage’s mind is without discrimination; to discriminate is to fail to discriminate, to debate is to fail to debate. The difference lies in this: the sage takes *"not seeing"* as debate, while the common people take *"showing to one another"* as debate.

*"Not boasting, not speaking, not benevolent, not content, not envious"*—these ancient sayings are cited as proof. In these five, perfect virtue is complete, names and appearances unestablished—this is what is called *"round."* If the Dao is made manifest through words, if benevolence is constant, if integrity is pure, if courage is bold, if envy is present, then edges and corners are too exposed, approaching squareness. Squareness is a boundary.

Alas! The world knows that *"not knowing"* is the utmost, but not knowing while knowing is even more utmost—what is called *"debate without words"* and *"the Dao that is not spoken."* This is *"being yet nonbeing, color yet emptiness"*—is it not the *"Celestial Storehouse"* that is *"not full when drawn from, not exhausted when poured,"* whose origin cannot be known? *"Preserving light"* is the state of *"knowing yet not knowing."*

*Nie Que* asked *Wang Ni*, "Do you know what all things share in common?"
"How would I know?" replied *Wang Ni*.
"Do you know what you do not know?"
"How would I know?"
"Then do things have no knowledge?"
"How would I know? Still, let me try to say: How can we be sure that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How can we be sure that what I call not-knowing is not knowing? Now, let me ask you this: If people sleep in damp places, their waists ache and they become half-paralyzed—is that so for eels? If they dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—is that so for monkeys? Of these three, who knows the proper place to dwell?"

"Ah! Of these three, who knows the proper dwelling?

Humans eat the flesh of grain-fed and pasture-raised animals; elk and deer eat grass. Centipedes delight in snakes; owls and crows relish mice. Of these four, who knows the proper flavor?

Apes and monkeys take female gibbons as mates; elk consort with deer; loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Lady Li are considered beauties by humans—yet when fish see them, they dive deep; when birds see them, they fly high; when elk and deer see them, they flee in haste. Of these four, who knows the proper beauty of the world?

From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I discern their distinctions?"

Nie Que said, "If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfect Person likewise not know benefit and harm?"

Wang Ni replied, "The Perfect Person is divine. Though great marshes burn, they cannot be scorched; though the Milky Way freezes, they cannot be chilled; though thunder splits mountains and winds shake the sea, they cannot be startled. Such a one rides the clouds and qi, harnesses the sun and moon, and roams beyond the Four Seas. Death and life bring no change to them—how much less the beginnings of benefit and harm?"

Guo's Commentary:
What is shared is not necessarily correct, nor is what differs uniquely wrong—neither self nor other can rectify the other, so knowledge serves no purpose. If one knows what one does not know, this is already a form of knowing; with knowing, one cannot entrust things to the natural course of the many talents. Only with complete unknowing does one become vast and unobstructed, able to entrust all things.

Those who venture tentative words do so precisely because they do not know, and thus dare not speak definitively—they merely test their words. Fish swim in water, a capacity all creatures share, and thus it is called "knowing." Yet from a bird's perspective, what was called "knowing" becomes "unknowing." Therefore, he cites the examples of humans, gibbons, and monkeys to illustrate the differing conveniences of the myriad things; then he cites humans, deer, grubs, and crows to show that beauty and ugliness have no fixed standard. He further lists gibbons, *biandan*, elk, deer, *fang*, fish, and creatures with radiant fur to demonstrate that what the world favors is not the same. If one condemns what differs, one cannot know that what is shared is necessarily correct.

Benevolence and righteousness, right and wrong, are tangled and confused: what benefits one may harm another, and with the endless "other" and "self" in the world, the contest of right and wrong has no constancy. Thus, only by refraining from disputing and allowing each to be self-so can all things be harmoniously attained.

Nie Que has not yet mastered this unknowing, so he still doubts whether the Perfect Person must know these things—this is a question left unresolved. The Perfect Person is divine, without deliberate intent yet in accord with all things.

The one who is neither stifled nor chilled, neither startled nor alarmed—this is the person of complete spirit, whose form is whole and whose substance merges with things. Though traversing the utmost transformations, they have never ceased to be themselves, thus remaining unbounded, with no thorns lodged in the heart.

Those who ride the clouds and qi borrow things to journey, yet it is not the self that moves. Those who roam the sun and moon know day and night but not life and death. Those who wander beyond the four seas are without knowledge of it, yet entrust the world to its own self-so—thus they gallop through the ten thousand things without exhaustion.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The Dao cannot be known; to know it is precisely to be without knowledge. To know the "not-knowing" is to see the body of the Dao.

Now, the common people take bodily ease and comfort as the correct state, the taste of fodder and grain-fed animals as the correct flavor, and the sight of beautiful colors as the correct appearance—just as gibbons find their own rest, maggots and crows their own sweetness, and fish, birds, elk, and deer their own mates. Like them, each takes their own knowledge as the correct knowledge. But can the common people and the ten thousand things truly have a single correct state, correct flavor, or correct appearance?

If one knows without attaining the correct state, correct flavor, or correct appearance, then what they know is not correct—this much is clear. Thus, from my perspective, benevolence and righteousness, right and wrong, are tangled and confused. How could I know their distinctions? This is why, when asked four times, I four times did not know.

The Perfect Person is divine. Being divine, they wondrously embody the ten thousand things, yet in speaking of the ten thousand things, none are not the self—while the self, in the end, is nothing. Who could then stifle, chill, or startle them?

The Doubtful Alone:
In all under heaven, the correct state is no-state; the correct flavor is no-flavor; the correct appearance is no-appearance. Yet those who take nothingness as correctness see only nothingness. Thus, they speak only of the distinctions between having state, flavor, and appearance, never of nothingness as correctness. From my perspective, right and wrong, benevolence and righteousness, are tangled and confused—who could set them right? Therefore, not knowing their distinctions is precisely how one distinguishes them.

Narrow Views:
What all things share is called "understanding," yet these explanations remain unclear. In my humble opinion, what humans and other beings share is their nature; what differs is their emotions. Nature flows into emotion, and each thing takes itself as correct. Their partial views point to horses and blame one another, debates escalate, and resentments arise—even to the point where liver and gall become as distant as Chu and Yue, and father and son become strangers. Such calamities truly begin with the word "knowledge," which falsely generates distinctions. Thus, Wang Ni answered three times, "How could I know?" Desiring to gnaw through the gap, he instead sought what he did not know, attaining their shared, identical nature and obscuring the principle of great penetration—this was close. Yet I fear it was still not a true meeting of minds. He then spoke of the differences between humans and birds or beasts, of how their proper states, flavors, and appearances are not correct. If so, then what is called "knowing"—is it truly knowing? And what is called "not knowing"—is it truly not knowing?

Following the Root:
The milu deer eat the sweet grass *jian*; the grass grows thick. Emperor Jing of Han decreed that some ponds abound with *jian* grass. Zhao Chongguo memorialized, "Now the barbarians have abandoned their fertile lands and *jian* grass."

Master Ququezi asked Master Changwuzi, "I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao, has no words yet speaks, speaks yet has no words, and roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these reckless words, but I see them as the wondrous practice of the Dao. What do you think?"

Master Changwuzi said, "These are words that even the Yellow Emperor would find dazzling—how could Confucius understand them? Moreover, you are far too hasty in your calculations, seeing an egg and seeking a rooster to crow at dawn, seeing a slingshot and seeking a roasted owl. I have spoken to you recklessly; you have listened recklessly.

What is it like? The sun and moon embrace the cosmos within their lips, placing their obscurity and murkiness together to honor one another. The masses toil endlessly; the sage appears foolish and dull. They encompass ten thousand years as a single accomplishment, yet the ten thousand things are all complete. How could I know that delighting in life is not delusion? How could I know that hating death is not like a youth who has lost his way and does not know to return? Lady Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her collar was soaked. Yet once she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How could I know that the dead do not regret their initial longing for life?

One who dreams of drinking wine may weep at dawn; one who dreams of weeping may go hunting at dawn. When dreaming, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even interpret the dream. Only after waking does one know it was a dream."

Once awakened, one then knows it was a dream. Moreover, only with great awakening does one know this was all a great dream. Yet the foolish believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their keen discernment: "This is a lord! That is a herdsman!" How rigid! Even you and I, Qiu, are dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called "perverse and strange." Yet ten thousand generations hence, should a great sage arise who understands their meaning, it will be as if encountering them at dawn or dusk.

The Keeper of Changwu said to Confucius: "Menglang’s words drift without direction, like listening to fireflies—confusing and bewildering." Cui Zhu comments: "Small brightness, not great understanding." *Shiye* refers to the rooster that marks the night; the *e* is a bird as large as a turtledove, with mottled plumage and exquisitely smooth flesh. *Hun* means unsettled; *kuang* (or *kuang*) is a bed, a place of rest. *Qieqie* means meticulous; *diaogui* means utterly strange.

Guo Xiang’s commentary: Those who do not pursue affairs find affairs come of themselves, principles naturally aligning—this is not a matter of chasing after them. Those who do not seek profit or avoid harm proceed directly forward, without evasion. Those who do not delight in seeking take what comes without joy; those who do not resent take what comes without anger. Those who do not rely on the Dao yet arrive alone—this is the state of having no words for what is called "having words," or having words for what is called "having no words." All such designations are not what I call so; each claims its own. Thus, there is no "that" with words, yet there is "this" without words. All that is not true nature is dust and grime.

Things possess their natural principles and ultimate limits. Following them directly leads to dark harmony, not through words. Thus, to speak is to drift aimlessly, and to hear is to be dazzled. Even the Yellow Emperor could not prevent all beings from harboring attachments and being dazzled by words. Therefore, the sage entrusts things to the realm beyond dust and grime, merging obscurely beyond the bounds of seeing and hearing, illuminating with Heaven and not opposing calculations, letting things be as they are without deliberate elucidation.

Now, when Qūquè hears Menglang’s drifting words and takes them for the practice of the wondrous Dao, it is no different from seeing an egg and demanding the crowing of a rooster, or seeing a slingshot and seeking the roasted flesh of an *e*. Those who cannot rest in their time and follow their lot, who probe transformations and seek change, who contemplate death while alive, and cling to this to debate that—all are those who oppose calculations. Since words drift aimlessly, let us try speaking them recklessly. If one listens correctly to reckless words, it is like calculating for a great drought. Thus, take life and death as day and night, a metaphor like the sun and moon; take the myriad things as a single body, a metaphor like embracing the cosmos. Because there is that which is deemed base, hierarchy arises, and with it, confusion and disorder that no one can set right. Each claims rightness from their own side. Therefore, the Dao of effortless harmony is best left unspoken, entrusted to its own spontaneity.

*Hunran* means without ripples, the state of being driven and rushing about in the realm of right and wrong. *Yuchun* describes the ignorant, moving straight ahead without awareness. *Chun* means unadulterated. To survey ten thousand generations and compare their changes, the common people call it mixed. Thus, they toil their forms and startle their minds, abandoning this to grasp that. Only the great sage, free from attachments, moves directly forward and unites with transformation, roaming constantly in solitude amid all changes. Though the Dao passes through countless ages, myriad differences, and endless variations, its accomplishment remains one—ancient and present are the same. When things are called so, the myriad things are one in their so-ness. Nothing is not so, no time is not complete—this may be called *chun*.

*Yun* means accumulation. Accumulating "this" over ten thousand years makes ten thousand years one "this." Accumulating "so" over the myriad things makes the myriad things entirely so. Thus, one does not know where life and death, before and after, reside, nor where victory and defeat between self and other lie. Life and death are one. Yet to delight solely in life and oppose transformation—how can one know this is not delusion? To lose one’s original home in youth is called *ruofang*; *ruofang* means chasing comfort in one’s present place without knowing to return to the homeland. How can one know that life is not such a loss?

To know that death is not a return and yet to detest it—how is this different? Observe Lady Li: first she wept, then she repented—her emotions shifted thus within a single life. At such moments, one does not even know oneself; how then can one know the transformations of death and life? Thus, between waking and dreaming, if circumstances change, emotions differ, and the wishes of life and death cannot be the same. If one delights in life while alive, then one will delight in death when dead. Though life and death differ, in each attaining its wish, they are one. What then is there to cling to?

At the moment of dreaming, one does not know it is a dream; at the hour of death, one likewise does not know it is death but follows one’s will. The dreamer, even while dreaming, may interpret the dream—yet this differs not from the waking state. In whatever one encounters, there is nothing lacking. Why then, while alive, should one worry about death?

The great awakened one is the sage. The great awakened one knows that those who harbor anxieties and concerns have not yet awakened. The foolish, lost in a great dream, believe themselves awake, stealthily elevating their preferences as rulers and condemning their dislikes as servants. Joyfully clinging to the biases of their household, they may be called truly benighted. Extraordinary discourse is beyond the ken of ordinary men, hence it is called "consoling." Though it may seem strange and uncanny, they do not recognize its profound liberation. Those who encounter it at dawn or dusk, who can speak of it and shed all attachments, uniting life and death as one—such people are exceedingly rare.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The sage knows neither advantage nor harm, thus has no inclinations or aversions. Lacking nothing, he does not seek; acting without contrivance, he does not stray from the Dao. To have assertions is the very reason for having none; to have none is the very reason for having them. Only the unburdened heart can align with this. Ququezi once heard the Master speak of this, dismissing it as reckless—yet later deemed it the wondrous Dao. Both views miss the mark. The Dao is not borne by speech or silence. The *shiye* bird hatches from an egg, yet the egg is not the *shiye*; the osprey is roasted by the slingshot, yet the slingshot is not the osprey. The wondrous Dao arises from what is heard, yet what is heard is not the wondrous Dao.

Those who today hear the Dao believe themselves enlightened, yet they do not know to daily diminish their attachments until reaching non-action—all are disciples of Quque. The Dao cannot be transmitted through words. What I speak and what you hear are but delusions. To desire deluded words yet grasp them with the heart—this is to know how the sun and moon become luminous and merge with their light, to know how the cosmos becomes the cosmos and its mechanism lies within one’s grasp. When words align perfectly, this is the practice of the wondrous Dao—not merely hearing it. Those who muddy its clarity and exalt one another with flattery are surely set aside and not adopted.

The multitude toil endlessly, achieving nothing; the sage appears foolish and ignorant, vacant yet not scattered. Though ten thousand generations pass, he unites them as one, forming purity. The myriad things are entirely so, mutually accumulating through this. My body encompasses the myriad things; the myriad things are my body. Uniting ten thousand years into one pure whole, even a child who dies young may outlive Pengzu. The myriad things being entirely so, mutually accumulating through this, even a autumn hair may surpass Mount Tai.

Viewed through Lady Li’s example, how can one know the dead do not regret their former pursuit of life? Why then should life be delightful and death detestable?

**Bixu’s Commentary:**
"Uniting ten thousand years into one pure whole" means traversing past and present as a single dawn and dusk, merging all changes into undifferentiated completion. The perfected person regards life and death as a great dream, transcending them as the great awakening. The multitude take the mingling of souls as dreaming and the separation of forms as waking—confused and strange, they are deluded by life and death. Thus, the enlightened utter these ultimate words on dreams and awakening to console the uncanny bonds of death. Though life and death’s ties have no cords, they cannot be undone. If, after ten thousand generations, one encounters a great sage who unravels this knot of life and death, it is like an encounter at dawn or dusk.

**New Transmission:**
"Merging with the sun and moon" refers to a single day and night; "grasping the cosmos" means equaling far and near. The multitude have a self and objects, are enslaved by things, hence are called "toiling." The sage has no self, no objects, and becomes one with things, hence is called "foolish" and "vacant."

**Xuxi’s Commentary:**
"Flattery" is the lowest. Harmonizing with the dust and preceding the lowest—this is why flattery is exalted. To exalt flattery is to have no lower; to have no lower is to have no disgrace. Laozi said, "Honor is lowly"—this is the meaning. "Ruler or servant"—this refers to dreaming of being a lord or a servant. The whole world is dreaming, yet they stealthily choose between them—how benighted!

**Bishu’s Commentary:**
"Why" belongs to the next sentence. *Ruofang* in the *Record of Rites* (Chapter 20) means "loss." "Encountering it at dawn or dusk" means having one who knows it. Though ten thousand generations distant, it is like dawn and dusk—emphasizing its rarity. The ancients said, "A sage every thousand *li* is like shoulder to shoulder"—the meaning is similar.

Even if you and I were to debate, if you defeat me, or I defeat you—is it truly so?

"I am truly in the wrong—yet if I defeat you, or you do not defeat me, am I truly right? Or if you are truly right, yet I am truly wrong—is it possible one of us is right, or one wrong? Or could both be right, or both wrong? You and I cannot know each other—then people are fundamentally shrouded in obscurity. Whom shall we ask to set it right? If we ask one who agrees with you to set it right, since they already agree with you, how can they set it right? If we ask one who agrees with me to set it right, since they already agree with me, how can they set it right? If we ask one who differs from both you and me to set it right, since they already differ from both you and me, how can they set it right? If we ask one who agrees with both you and me to set it right, since they already agree with both you and me, how can they set it right? Thus, you, I, and others—none can know each other, yet must we await another?

What does it mean to harmonize with the Heavenly Pivot? It is to say: 'Is it so? Is it not so? If so, then so differs from not-so—yet there is no debate. If so, then so differs from not-so—yet there is no debate.' The mutual dependence of changing sounds—if they do not depend on each other, harmonize them with the Heavenly Pivot, follow them with the myriad transformations, and so exhaust the years. Forget the years, forget righteousness, rouse yourself to the boundless—thus lodge in the boundless."

Guo's Commentary:
To infer when one does not know, to debate when one does not see—debate is insufficient for self-assurance, for it stands in opposition to things. Debating in opposition all day, one remains in darkness until the end, unable to set anything right. Thus, one must leave it to self-correction. Agreement leads to affirmation, difference to negation—neither is fully trustworthy. If "so" were truly so, then the world could no longer negate it; if "not-so" were truly not-so, then there would be no grounds to affirm it. Now, one affirms what is agreed upon and negates what differs—yet with both agreement and difference present, affirmation and negation lack a foundation. Thus, affirmation and negation arise from the love of debate and rest in the Heavenly Pivot. Entrust them to the twofold course and cease in self-correction. If relying on another is insufficient to correct this, then none in the world can correct another. Thus, entrust it to self-correction, and therein lies perfection.

The Heavenly Pivot is the natural division. Affirmation and negation, so and not-so, self and other stand in opposition—hence there is no debate. With no debate, one harmonizes with the Heavenly Pivot, abiding in the natural division alone, without relying on another to correct this. The debate of affirmation and negation is but a changing sound; changing sounds in mutual dependence are all insufficient to correct one another. Thus, as if they do not depend on each other, harmonize with the natural division and follow the boundless transformation. Pursuing this path, the realm of affirmation and negation naturally dissolves, and the attainment of one’s nature and destiny is fully realized. Forgetting the years, one merges life and death; forgetting righteousness, one transcends affirmation and negation. When affirmation and negation, life and death are swept away into oneness, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows unbounded—thus, those who lodge in it find no limit.

Lü's Commentary:
What the world calls affirmation and negation is no more than: I affirm what you negate, you affirm what I negate, or both affirm, both negate—all four arise from you and me. Yet if neither you nor I can know each other, then what is called affirmation and negation remains ultimately obscure. Humans are inherently enveloped in darkness—who then can correct it? It must be corrected by others. But are others the same as oneself? If the same as oneself, then the same as you; if different from oneself, then different from you. Are they the same as you? If the same as me and you, then different from me and you. Yet you, I, and others are no more than these four, and none can correct another—thus, you, I, and others all cannot know each other. Must we await another? It means we do not await another.

Only the sage knows this: though changing sounds depend on each other, if they do not depend on each other, then affirmation and negation find no counterpart and rest in the Heavenly Pivot. Why? Affirmation and negation have no reality—they are but sounds arising from transformation. The dependence or non-dependence of you and others arises from the deluded calculations of the discerning mind. If I harmonize with the Heavenly Pivot without dividing or debating, follow the boundless transformation, and extend it endlessly, then the myriad things do not burden the mind. To exhaust the years is to merge the ten thousand ages into a single, pure whole.

The absence of debate over "so or not-so, so or not" arises from knowing their shared essence—all things are thus. To exhaust the years is to forget the years; to be without affirmation and negation is to forget righteousness. It begins in the boundless, thus it ultimately lodges in the boundless. "Changing sounds in mutual dependence—this is how one exhausts the years." This passage should be placed above "What does it mean to harmonize with the Heavenly Pivot?"—the text’s compilation is erroneous here, as the meaning makes clear.

Yi Du’s Notes:
Whenever one says "is," it is not necessarily so; whenever one says "so," it is not necessarily so—thus their agreement and difference are also without debate. Yet "so" and "is" stand in mutual opposition, equally subject to change. There are transformations, and there are transforming transformations; there are sounds, and there are sounding sounds. Sounds arise from transformations—without transformation, sounds are not manifest; sounds manifest transformations—without sound, transformations are not revealed. This is the mutual dependence of changing sounds. Yet sounds emerge from transformations, which sounds cannot know; transformations encompass sounds, which sounds cannot comprehend. This is as if they do not depend on each other.

Dependence arises from two things; if the ten thousand transformations are merged into one, then the traces of dependence have no place to arise. Sounds are constant sounds—they do not wait for things to be heard; hearing arises from things themselves. Transformations are constant transformations—they do not wait for sounds to be seen; understanding arises from sounds themselves. This is how they depend on each other yet seem not to.

Guan Jian’s Observations:
The distinctions between life and death, waking and dreaming arise from transformation; the debates of self and other, affirmation and negation arise from sound. They seem to depend on each other, yet transformations transform on their own, unaware of how they transform; sounds sound on their own, unaware of how they sound—thus, they seem not to depend on each other. In the end, the utmost principle of things cannot escape the spontaneity of creation. This is the source and passage of the ten thousand transformations, the great equalizer of the myriad things.

Xiang Dao’s Explanation:
The Heavenly Pivot is the beginning of nature and destiny; the boundless transformation is the endless change. Harmonizing with the Heavenly Pivot and following the boundless transformation, self and things are not obscured by affirmation and negation, and each fulfills its allotted nature and destiny—this is how one exhausts the years. Forgetting the years, life and death become a single thread; forgetting righteousness, right and wrong become a single strand. Life and death, right and wrong—once swept away into oneness, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows unbounded—thus, knowing the forgetful one does not take it as something substantial, but merely lodges in it.

Fu Mo’s Supplementary Notes:
Above, it was said that one must await a sage of future ages to resolve it—thus, another layer of discussion follows: you, I, and others—none can know each other, so why await another? That "another" is the sage, who is the knowing of the unknowing, the debating of the non-debating, the one who harmonizes with the Heavenly Pivot. The Heavenly Pivot is the vanishing of "is and is not, so and not-so"—though sounds may lodge in affirmation and negation, they are but changing sounds. Their dependence and non-dependence are the same. "Dependence" refers to the "awaiting another" above—it concludes in endlessness. A Chan master was once asked, "What is it ultimately?" He replied, "There is no ultimate here"—this is the meaning of "no bound."

Shadow asked Shade, "Previously you moved—now you are still; previously you sat—now you rise. Why are you so without constancy?"
Shade replied, "Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?"

Formerly, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering happily—a butterfly indeed! He was content and unaware of being Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, solidly Zhou. He did not know whether Zhou had dreamed he was a butterfly, or a butterfly had dreamed it was Zhou. Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction—this is called the transformation of things.

Guo's Commentary:
"Vast darkness is the shadow beyond the shadow—it is the yin that guards the outer bounds. 'Do I depend on something to be thus?' speaks of the heavenly mechanism moving of itself. To sit and rise without dependence—who alone attains this? Who could know its cause and demand its reason?

If one demands what it depends on and traces its origin, the tracing and demanding will be endless, until finally the principle of being without dependence and transforming alone becomes clear. If one depends on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada, then the source of its independent conduct would not be difficult to discern. Now, the reason it is not discerned lies precisely in its not depending on this and transforming alone.

Some say that vast darkness depends on shadow, shadow on form, and form on the Creator—then I ask: does the Creator exist or not? If not, how could it create things? If it does, then it is insufficient to give rise to the multitude of forms. Thus it is clear that the multitude of forms give rise to themselves and create themselves without dependence—this is the true nature of Heaven and Earth.

Therefore, self and other are mutually entailed, form and shadow arise together, and though they may seem to merge in mystery, they do not depend on one another. Now, vast darkness arising from shadow is like saying they arise together without dependence. Thus vast darkness is not controlled by shadow, nor is shadow manipulated by form, nor is form transformed by nothingness. Whether transforming or not, being so or not—whether following others or proceeding from oneself—all is so of itself. How could I know its reason?

Thus, to follow without aiding is to have no trace of beginning or end, inner or outer. But if one demands these proximate causes and forgets their self-so origin, attaching things to externals and losing the master within, then attachment and esteem arise. How could equanimity be attained?

'Content and unaware of being Zhou'—this is to delight in one’s own will, to find joy in one’s own nature, to act with ease and pleasure."

When one dreams of being a butterfly and forgets Zhou, this is no different from the distinction of life and death. Suddenly awakening, one feels only that Zhou is Zhou—this is merely called "awakening," yet it may well be another dream. Now, not knowing the butterfly is no different from the dream’s not knowing Zhou. Each suits its momentary will, so how can one prove the butterfly does not dream of being Zhou?

There are those who doze briefly yet dream of a hundred years—how then can one prove that this present hundred years is not the dream of a dozer? The distinction between waking and dreaming is no different from the debate over life and death. What now serves as self-comparison to suit one’s will arises from the fixity of these divisions, not from their absence.

Time does not pause even for an instant, nor does the present persist—thus yesterday’s dream has already transformed by today. Is the change of life and death any different? Why trouble the heart over such distinctions? When one is thus engaged, one does not know that the other dreams of being a butterfly. Taking it from a human perspective, in this single lifetime, one does not know whether the future will bring Lady Li—yet fools whisper to themselves, believing they know that life is joyful and death dreadful, as if they had never heard of the transformation of things.

Lü’s Annotation:
The relationship between the shadow’s attendant (wangliang) and the shadow is the same as that of ours with others—yet they do not know the shadow depends not on form, just as we do not know we depend not on others. For the shadow’s movement and stillness, sitting and rising, follow only the form, possessing no independent nature. Yet being without sentience, how could it know dependence? If one claims the shadow depends on form, then on what does form depend to exist? The shadow’s dependence on form is not like the snake’s reliance on its belly-scales to move or the cicada’s on its wings to fly. How can one know the reason for this being so or not so? If one can comprehend the insentience of things, then even the snake’s belly-scales and the cicada’s wings are without dependence.

Thus, when one is a butterfly, one flutters blissfully, unaware of Zhou; when one is Zhou, one stirs uneasily, unaware of the butterfly. If even the transformations of a single body are not self-known, how can things of differing forms know one another? When things do not know one another, each returns to its root; when things do not depend on one another, none finds its counterpart. How could there be any lack of uniformity?

Oral Exegesis:
In Zhuang Zhou’s case, the night’s transformation into a butterfly was a dream—yet he feared that the butterfly, existing there, might now take his present waking as a dream. Hence he said, “Does not know whether Zhou dreamed of being a butterfly or the butterfly dreamed of being Zhou.” This dream and waking must have a point of distinction, so he said, “Zhou and the butterfly must have a division.” This sentence seems to conclude yet does not, merely urging one to investigate the matter here.

Xu Xi:
Dream and waking are equal; things, self, small and large, right and wrong, life and death—all are equal. Others, in discussing this, would conclude with equality, but he coldly turns the phrase to overturn all previous arguments: “Zhou and the butterfly must have a division.” The unknowing take this as still making distinctions; the knowing see it as the mechanism by which both man and ox are lost. The words seem contrary, yet speak truly.

Supplementary Ink:
This further develops the earlier discussion of mutual dependence: the shadow’s attendant depends on the shadow, the shadow on form, form on creation—now I depend on others, others on Heaven. Thus, one need not depend on others; one may harmonize with Heaven’s natural boundaries and find sufficiency in the Heavenly within oneself.

To divide dream and waking between self and other: I am the butterfly in the dream, the other is Zhuang Zhou after waking. With one person divided between dream and waking, now the butterfly in the dream, now Zhuang Zhou after waking, he said, “There must be a division.” This is what is meant by “one yet two, two yet one.” If they were truly two, they would require mutual dependence; if originally one, there would be no need for dependence. The transformation of things speaks of past and present, dream and waking fused into one. Only after the transformation of things can one be “not a thing among things.”

General Observations from My Humble View:
The opening presents a dialogue between two masters, elaborating the inequality of human and earthly pipes to clarify the spontaneity of Heavenly pipes—not only does principle not depend on equality, but equality cannot reach it. Thus, in response to their questions, he cites evidence from the side and draws parallels, yet does not directly name the Heavenly pipes, wishing for the heart to intuit and grasp it for itself.

The myriad things entangle and disperse, flourish and fade, ever-changing in form and color, self-arising and self-ceasing, ultimately returning to the Heavenly pipes to rest. The Heavenly Axis is without form or sound, yet the source from which form and sound arise, the manifestation of divine transformation. If one can thoroughly investigate the origins of human and earthly pipes, then the Heavenly pipes may be known. As Guo’s commentary says, “Is there yet another thing? It is simply the myriad apertures, the bamboo flutes, joined in the commonality of living beings to together complete one Heaven.”

To the discussion of knowing words, waking and dreaming, the heart’s utterances, the blowing of approval or disapproval, right and wrong, life and death—are these not the same? The myriad apertures roar in fury, yet when one attains the center of the ring to respond to the inexhaustible, one is empty to receive things, and things are likewise unimpeded. This is forgetting while the other self-transforms—what is called “wind aiding the emptiness of apertures.”

“Heaven and earth as one finger, the myriad things as one horse”—this is using non-uniformity to unify the vast, the strange, the deceitful, the monstrous. The Dao unites them as one, not requiring uniformity yet naturally uniform. As for the monkey-keeper’s distribution of taro, the joy and anger it engenders, or Zhaowen’s zither playing, the completion and loss it reveals—these show that having a heart and acting intentionally are insufficient to transform things, let alone achieve uniformity.

Yet “Heaven and earth and I are born together, the myriad things and I are one”—this can be called uniformity. But one must guard against taking “one” and “words” as two, or “two” and “one” as three, which would be the omen of scattering and non-uniformity. Only by reaching “before there were things” and pouring from the inexhaustible, by awakening to the great dream and investigating the myriad ages to unify them, can one encompass the Dao of unifying the world’s things.

The shadow’s attendant questioning the shadow, not knowing the same yet different; the *Nanhua*’s butterfly dream—who can determine whether it is same or different? This thoroughly discusses the non-uniformity of self and other, life and death, waking and dreaming, yet ultimately returns to the transformation of things. The *Nanhua*’s “transformation” is the *Great Change*’s “spirit,” latent in the indistinct, manifest in daily use yet beyond knowing and knowledge. From this, one awakens to the myriad things as one form, the myriad forms as one transformation, the myriad transformations as one spirit. Illuminating the spirit and understanding it, transforming and penetrating it—who is thing, who is self? This is called the great uniformity.

Brush Notes:
The “Equalizing Things” chapter begins by unifying self and other, right and wrong, success and failure, more and less, small and large—yet when its words reach their utmost, it proceeds to investigate past and present, unify life and death, equate dream and waking, and harmonize the thousand changes and myriad transformations into one. This is what is called “understanding thoroughly without obstruction.”

Yet if self and other can be equalized, how can dream and waking be the same? For the actions of day and the dreams of night are one, though day is waking and night is sleep—a slight difference. Over time, when this is thoroughly understood, the actions of day and the dreams of night become indistinct, without division.

Jiang Yue said: “Waking can know dreams, but dreams cannot know waking—thus waking is certainly truer than dreams. What waking attains remains within thought and consideration; the foreknowledge of dreams arises outside thought and consideration—thus dreams are more numinous than waking. The waking of each day has its regular patterns; the dreams of each night often lack continuity. The difference between dream and waking is thus so great—how much more so the great change of life and death? If one is not such a person, can one avoid drowning in creation?”

Nevertheless, if one can early awaken to dream and waking, then the coming and going of life and death are also not worth discussing.

**Chapter Three: The Main Principle of Nurturing Life**
*(Guo Xiang’s Commentary: Life is preserved through nurturing, and thus nurturing life is the ultimate principle. Yet if nurturing exceeds its proper limit, it harms life—this is not the true principle of nurturing life.)*

Our life has limits, but knowledge is boundless. To pursue the boundless with the limited is perilous. And to persist in such pursuit is perilous indeed. In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment. Follow the central path as your constant guide—thus can you preserve the body, fulfill life, nurture your kin, and live out your years.
*(Perilous: as previously noted, meaning exhaustion. To follow the central path: to adhere to the middle. Zhao’s commentary: among the extraordinary meridians, the central vessel is the Governing Vessel; in clothing, it is the seam running down the back—also called the "governing" line. The *Book of Rites* and *Deep Robes* commentary: "constant" means unchanging.)*

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Life has its limits—each receives a destined allotment. When one lifts heavy burdens or carries light ones with ease, this is the limit of one’s strength. Yet those who crave fame and dominance, even if they surpass others in physical prowess, still find their desires unfulfilled—this is the boundlessness of knowledge. Thus, the pursuit of knowledge arises from misjudgment and vanishes in profound equilibrium. Profound equilibrium means following one’s inherent limits without the slightest excess. Therefore, though bearing a weight of ten thousand *jun*, if it accords with one’s capacity, one suddenly forgets the weight upon the body. Though responding to ten thousand affairs, one remains oblivious to their presence—this is the true principle of nurturing life. But if one with finite nature seeks boundless knowledge, how can one avoid exhaustion? Already exhausted by knowledge, and yet failing to cease, one further employs knowledge to remedy it—this is nurturing that harms life, truly the greatest peril.

The only way is to forget good and evil, abide in the center, and let all things follow their own course, merging obscurely with what is most fitting. Thus, punishment and fame recede, and the integrity of principle resides within. "Following the central path as one’s constant guide" means taking the middle as one’s norm. If one attains the center and moves in profound accord, then preserving the body, fulfilling life, nurturing kin, and living out one’s years—none of these are impossible. Nurturing life does not seek to exceed one’s limits; it is merely the fulfillment of principle and the completion of one’s years.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
Life follows form and thus has an end; knowledge pursues things and thus is endless. To follow knowledge with life is perilous indeed. To persist in such pursuit is perilous to the end. The world knows beauty as beauty, and thus ugliness arises; it knows good as good, and thus what is not good arises. Good and evil both arise from knowledge—how far apart are they? Only by neither upholding the conduct of benevolence and righteousness to seek fame nor engaging in licentious and perverse acts to court punishment, but instead abandoning both good and evil and adhering to what cannot be otherwise as one’s constant—only then does one hollow out the heart, cast aside knowledge, and rest in the Dao of unknowing. What more could be added to preserving the body, fulfilling life, nurturing kin, and living out one’s years?

**Yi Du’s Remarks:**
When true nature is divided, good and evil arise; when good and evil are established, fame and punishment follow. Only by following the natural tendencies of life without diminishing or adding to the myriad things, merging with them without praise or blame, can one transcend the reach of fame and punishment. The world’s notion of good fame arises from those who fall short; its notion of evil fame arises from those who exceed. Some lightly regard life and pursue righteousness to seek fleeting fame; others covet life and chase profit, only to meet an untimely death midway—all are what is meant by "proximity to fame and punishment" in good and evil. They do not follow the natural tendencies of life but instead depart from what is excessive in themselves.

**Personal Observations:**
"In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment." If one cites the idea that "good not accumulated is insufficient to establish fame, evil not accumulated is insufficient to destroy the self" as evidence, then this is doing and yet approaching fame and punishment. If one cites the idea that "above, one does not dare to uphold the conduct of benevolence and righteousness; below, one does not dare to engage in licentious and perverse acts," then this is not doing and yet not approaching fame and punishment. The meaning here differs from the text. What the world calls good and evil merely observes their traces. The good and evil of the sage and worthy are impartial and without boundaries, acting through non-action—how could the common mind comprehend this?

To do good and evil yet not approach fame and punishment, or to not do good and evil yet remain without fame and punishment—both accord with principle. Now, to act without approaching fame and punishment is viewed by the world as good and evil, yet the heart of the sage and worthy constantly follows the central path, aligning with the spontaneity of Heaven’s principle. Thus, profit and harm cannot reach it, and it is where the Dao returns.

The character *du* (督, "governing") glosses the "middle" as the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise—not the middle between good and evil. If, in the moment before the seven emotions arise, one follows this as the constant Dao, then the mind is empty, penetrating, and spiritually unobstructed, with nothing to bind it. One merges with the Supreme Ultimate in undifferentiated unity—how then could one know whether the body can be preserved, life fulfilled, kin nurtured, or years lived out?

---

Butcher Ding was carving an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot pressed, where his knee braced—*xi!* *huo!*—the sounds of the blade resounded in harmony. Every movement aligned with the rhythm of the *Sanglin* dance, matching the cadence of the *Jingshou* melody.

Lord Wenhui exclaimed, "Ah! Excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?"

Butcher Ding set down his knife and replied, "What your servant delights in is the Dao, which has advanced beyond mere skill."

When your servant first began carving oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the ox in its entirety. Now, I meet it with my spirit rather than seeing it with my eyes; my senses cease, and my spirit moves as it wills. Following the natural patterns, I cleave along the great crevices, guide the blade through the great cavities, moving in accord with what is inherently so. My skill never touches the ligaments or tendons, much less the great bones.

A good butcher changes his knife once a year—because he cuts. A common butcher changes his knife every month—because he hacks. Your servant’s knife has now been used for nineteen years, carving several thousand oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. For where the joints have space, and the blade has no thickness—when what has no thickness enters where there is space, how vast is the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, the edge of my knife remains as if newly whetted.

Nevertheless, whenever I come to a complex joint, I perceive the difficulty, become cautious, focus my gaze, slow my movements, and move the blade with utmost care. Then—*huo!*—it falls apart like clods of earth scattered on the ground. I stand holding the knife, look all around, linger in satisfaction, then wipe the blade clean and put it away."

Lord Wenhui said, "Excellent! From Butcher Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life."

The "Jingshou" is the movement of the *Xianchi* music. *Xie* refers to the spaces between, as Li of Que explains; *kuan*, as Sima explains, means "void." *Ken* denotes the attachment of flesh to bone, while *qing* refers to the knotted junctures. *Gu* are the large bones. "Nineteen years" takes ten years as a measure, with nine years added to express its length. *Xing* is a whetstone.

To "wipe the knife" means to clean it.

Guo’s commentary:
From the hand’s contact to the *Jingshou*’s divisions, it speaks of following convenience to apply skill, leaving nothing unmastered or unprincipled—so perfectly attuned to the ox’s structure that it also harmonizes with the rhythm of the music. "Advancing beyond technique" means merely lodging the Dao within skill. What he loves is not the skill itself. What he sees is nothing but the ox, for he has yet to perceive the spaces within its structure. He has never seen the whole ox, only the spaces within its structure. He encounters it with spirit, not with the eyes—obscuring the divisions with principle. The senses of perception cease, and the spirit’s desires move; the faculties of inspection are abandoned, and the mind flows freely in accord with principle. Those who follow Heaven’s pattern do not cut across it. To "strike the great spaces" means to follow the bounded places and strike them to separate. To "guide through the great voids" means to follow the joints’ openings and guide the blade to divide them. He relies on what is inherently so, never applying the knife recklessly. The blade moves through emptiness, never encountering obstruction—this is the marvel of the technique. "Intertwined and clustered" describes the complex joints; "gaze fixed" means no longer directing attention elsewhere. "Movements slow" refers to the hand’s caution. "Moving the blade with utmost care" means that once the division is achieved, little force is needed. "Like clods of earth scattered on the ground" means the structure is understood so thoroughly that the knife leaves no trace, as if earth were merely gathered. "Wiping the knife and putting it away" means cleaning the blade and sheathing it. Since the knife can be nurtured, one knows that life can also be nurtured.

Lü’s commentary:
Things are obstructed by their solidity, while the Dao flows through emptiness. Before hearing the Dao, one sees nothing but things; after hearing the Dao, one sees nothing but the Dao. "Encountering with spirit, not with the eyes" illustrates that those who have heard the Dao grasp it with the heart, not with knowledge or perception. "The senses of perception cease, and the spirit’s desires move" means relying on Heaven’s pattern to reach the great bones.

This is indeed to have never seen the whole ox. In the world, there is nothing that is not the Dao, and nothing through which it does not flow—it is simply thus. What one sees is nothing but the ox, and the analogy of the blade wearing out and harming life: after nineteen years, the blade is as if newly sharpened, not because it has not harmed the life within. As for its form, there has never been a thing that does not resemble its joints having spaces between them. As for its life, there has never been a life that does not resemble the blade’s lack of thickness. In its roaming of the blade, there is ever ample room—does this not resemble one who embodies the Dao and roams among the ten thousand things? Nevertheless, whenever one reaches the dense clusters, I see the difficulty in proceeding—what people fear cannot but be feared. With caution, one becomes alert; the gaze is fixed, the movement slow, until one reaches perfection, wipes the blade, and sheathes it. Thus, being as careful at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure.

Li Shibiao’s discourse:
Things are fundamentally no-things, and their essence naturally departs from the Dao, through which nothing does not flow—where then is there need for "dissolution"? What Zhuangzi calls "dissolving the ox" is to depart from things and empty the heart, never having seen the ox; to ride the void and follow principle, never having passed through the blade. This is also to dissolve through non-dissolution.

Moreover, nineteen years is not a short time, having traversed the cycles of yin and yang. The oxen dissolved number in the thousands, responding to the changes of worldly affairs—this is not a small matter. Yet the blade remains as if newly sharpened, for clinging to traces means that in an instant all has already shifted, while grasping the root means that from ancient times to the present, nothing departs. One’s own body is already illusory—what knife is there that can be wielded? The ten thousand things are all delusions—what ox is there that can be dissolved?

When both self and things are forgotten, subject and object vanish. Thus, without ever striking, the great gaps naturally part; without ever guiding, the great cavities naturally release. The blade moves with a *huo* sound, yet there is no labor in responding to things; the blade is set down, yet there is no burden of lingering things. In the end, "wiping the blade and sheathing it" is a return to non-use.

Viewed through the Dao, in dissolution there is no dissolution; if not obstructed, then dissolution is also unknowable. In obstruction there is no obstruction; if not dissolved, then obstruction also does not stand. From the perspective of Cook Ding, the ordinary cook dissolves obstructions. From the perspective of the ordinary cook, Cook Ding is obstructed by dissolution. When both dissolution and obstruction are relinquished, there is only emptiness. Roaming with this Dao beyond the ten thousand things—where then would there be any obstruction?

Yang Yongxiu remarked: "The *huo* sound of the blade never fails to strike the right note—it speaks of the rhythm of the cleaver’s dance in perfect measure. Thus we know that within heaven and earth, nothing is not music. The merchant’s bell harmonizes with the pitch of *huangzhong*; Cook Ding’s blade aligns with the *Sanglin* dance. Even the cowherd’s leaf-whistle and the chambered wife’s washing mallet—all correspond to tone. How could music ever be absent?"

Gongwen Xuan saw the Right Master and was startled, saying: "What manner of man is this? How is it that he is one-legged?" Was this given by heaven, or was it man’s doing? He replied: "It was heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him thus solitary; man’s form has its counterparts. From this we know it was heaven, not man."

The marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit may be royal, it finds no joy in such confinement.

[Note: Gongwen was a surname; the given name was Xuan, a man of Song.]

Guo’s commentary: *Jie* is the term for one who is partially amputated. To know what one cannot help is to acknowledge heaven. To violate what one knows is to act as man. Partial amputation is called *du*—solitary. The Master of a household may possess knowledge, yet if he cannot preserve both feet, then his knowledge is powerless. If the Right Master’s knowledge were to insist on preserving both, his spirit would be inwardly distressed, his body outwardly constrained. How could this be merely a matter of partial amputation?

When both feet walk together, it is called *having a counterpart*; in such a form, none doubt it is fate. Thus, to know the solitary is also not to claim it as oneself. Therefore, one who grasps the essence of life does not strive for what life cannot provide; one who grasps the essence of fate does not strive for what fate cannot accommodate. To preserve one’s natural state is all—seeking is the cage.

The cage is what confines the pheasant. To bow and rise between heaven and earth, to roam freely—this is the Way.

The realm of self-attainment is indeed the wondrous ground of nurturing life—why then seek to enter the cage and submit to confinement? For one begins in harmony yet ultimately never remains in harmony: this is the forgetting of harmony. When the spirit ever reigns supreme and the will’s qi overflows with ease, one naturally wanders in the clear and boundless expanse, suddenly unaware of goodness as goodness.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Right Master was one whose form was human but whose nature was of Heaven. Standing solitary and steadfast, when Gongwen Xuan saw him, he doubted whether he was man or Heaven’s creation—this is what it means to be made solitary. What one attains from the principle of nature and fate is originally thus. As for engaging with things and taking on the appearance of having a counterpart, that is merely the human. The marsh pheasant drinking and pecking at ease, its heart roaming with Heaven and harmonizing with its nature and fate, serves as an analogy. Not seeking to be caged and tamed, its spirit reigns supreme, untroubled by restraint—this is the analogy of one who, though dwelling among men, cannot attain free wandering. The nurturance within the cage, even if it brings the spirit to reign supreme, is not what it naturally prefers; it is not as good as the rare yet self-attained drinking and pecking in the marsh.

**Bǐshèng’s Notes:**
"Solitary and steadfast" (*jié dú*): seeing the solitary, one doubts the solitary. If there is a counterpart, then it is no longer solitary. Right Master had forgotten both knowledge and perception, calmly roaming his heart in solitude. Gongwen Xuan, upon merely glimpsing him, already knew this, hence his startled question: "Is he of Heaven or of man? How did he come to this?" For Heaven’s creation of man naturally endows him with knowledge and perception, yet man cannot pair with it—this is Heaven’s doing. If one does not know that knowledge is self-knowing and perception is self-perceiving, but instead adds further knowledge and perception, then one has a counterpart and belongs to the human. This is what Laozi meant by "Why do you, sir, bring the crowd with you?" The marsh pheasant, though it may find drinking and pecking difficult, must take the cage as its dwelling, striving to refine its spirit. Yet that knowledge and perception are also man’s cage—without being a perfected person, how could one suspend and dissolve them?

When Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to mourn him. After three cries, he departed. A disciple asked, "Was he not your Master’s friend?" Qin Shi replied, "He was." The disciple said, "Then is it proper to mourn him in this manner?" Qin Shi answered, "It is. At first, I thought him a man, but now I see he was not. Earlier, when I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own sons, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. In their grief, they must have spoken words they ought not to have spoken and shed tears they ought not to have shed—this is fleeing from Heaven and betraying one’s true nature, forgetting what one has received. The ancients called this ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.’ The Master came when it was his time, and he departed when it was fitting. To dwell in accord with the time and follow the natural order is to remain untouched by sorrow or joy. The ancients called this ‘the Great Release by the Lord.’"

It is like the flame passed from torch to torch—though the fuel is exhausted, the fire continues, and one does not know when it will end.

*(Note: The text records Qin Shi, though some versions write it as Yi. Guo Xiang’s commentary explains: Qin Shi mourned as others mourned, crying as others cried. The disciples found it strange that he did not linger by the door to observe the transformation, yet he cried three times, unaware that the perfected person is without fixed emotions and merely joins in the common lament. Thus, his conduct was fitting. The elders wept as if for sons, and the young as if for mothers—this arose from their prior attachment to the Master, bestowing kindness without grounding it in principle, leading to such excessive love.)*

The nature bestowed by Heaven endows each with its proper portion—this cannot be escaped, nor can it be augmented. To be overly moved by external things is not merely to flee from Heaven’s decree. Racing through the realms of sorrow and joy, though no corporal punishment be applied, one’s nature and emotions are already exhausted—is this not a form of punishment?

To arrive is to be born of itself; to depart is to die as principle dictates. Sorrow and joy arise from loss and gain. Yet the adept who merges with the transformations of the Dao is never unsettled, never out of harmony. Obscurely one with the workings of creation, there is nowhere that is not oneself—what gain or loss, what death or life could there be? Thus, abiding by what one has received, sorrow and joy find no place to lodge.

To take the entangled as "suspended" is to see the unattached as "released from suspension." Released from suspension, the passions of life and destiny are attained—this is the essence of nurturing life. "Exhausted" means fully spent; "fuel" is like the preceding fuel. The preceding fuel illustrates the principle of exhaustion, yet the fire is transmitted and does not perish. The heart attains the midst of nurturance, and so life continues without end. Clearly, nurturing life is the very means by which life lives.

Time does not come again; the present does not pause even once. Thus, human life is but a single breath, a single moment of attainment. The past breath is not the present breath, so nurturance continues life. The former fire is not the latter fire, so fuel transmits the blaze, and the blaze continues life. It is through nurturance that one reaches its utmost. How could the world know that what is exhausted is reborn?

Lü’s commentary:
The rite of condolence is to weep for the dead and console the living. To cry three times is to weep for the dead without sorrow; to leave without words is to console the living without sufficiency—this is why the disciples doubted Qin Shi’s lack of friendship. At first, I thought those who followed Lao Dan had all grasped his Way. Now, seeing the elders and youths weep in attachment, unable to rest in their time or abide in harmony, I know they are not true followers. For there must be those who speak without seeking words, weep without seeking tears—inner and outer in accord—this is how one guards against such excess.

What one receives from Heaven—the passions of life and destiny—has never been shaped by external things into sorrow or joy. To flee from Heaven and betray one’s nature, forgetting what one has received, is to desire escape from what is inescapably Heaven—yet one cannot avoid punishment. Knowing that arrival is to be at peace and departure is to follow principle, the ancients called this "the Great Release by the Lord," for one has never truly died.

The fire’s abode is the fuel, yet fire is not the fuel. Though the fuel is exhausted, the fire is transmitted—how could it end? The fire in this fuel is like the fire in that fuel; its transmission knows no end. Fire is likened to life, fuel to form. Understanding this, one knows that the means by which life lives has never had a beginning—how could sorrow or joy enter?

---

*Oral Exegesis*:
"Suspended" means the heart is entangled. "Lord" refers to Heaven. To know the spontaneity of Heaven’s principle is to see that even Heaven cannot bind one with life and death. Thus, it is called "the Lord’s release from suspension."

---

Liu Gai’s commentary:
The analogy of fire and fuel illustrates the spirit dwelling in form yet constantly shifting. The perfected of old, who carried their souls and regarded the body as an inn, did so for this reason—how could they cling to form and guard its honor?

---

*Brush Notes*:
Some Buddhist texts interpret this passage: the fire transmitted through fuel is like the spirit transmitted through form. The fire’s transmission differs from the fuel, just as the spirit’s differs from form. The former fuel is not the latter, revealing the subtlety of the "exhausted finger" technique. The former form is not the latter, awakening one to the depth of karmic conditions. The deluded see the body decay in one life and assume spirit and emotion perish with it—just as one sees fire expire in a single log and assumes its end is absolute. Is this not mistaken? Their insight is quite precise, yet to abandon life for life remains an incomplete discourse.

In my humble view, counting fuel by the finger, though fuel is plentiful and the finger limited, when fire is transmitted, it burns without immediate exhaustion. Molten metal does not leave the furnace; floating bubbles must return to the sea—this shows the unity of life and death. The earlier statement speaks of nurturing life; this speaks of life and death as one. Are they contradictory? Only by knowing the oneness of life and death can one truly nurture life.

---

*General Observations*:
Those who grasp the principle of nurturing form do not harm it; those who understand the Way of nurturing spirit do not act. Form is life’s abode; spirit is life’s master. The Way of emptiness and non-being is what nurtures the spirit. The world knows only how to nurture life but not how to nurture life’s master. The more they nurture, the more they lose their form—thus the true person teaches: do not follow the boundless with the bounded. This is the essence of nurturing life.

Those who embrace the Dao have no mind for good or evil; those who meet things with emptiness have no cause for punishment. Abiding in harmony without losing constancy is the principle of preserving life and fulfilling one’s years. The butcher’s metaphor illustrates responding to things: the knife represents life. After nineteen years, the blade is as if newly sharpened, cutting through complexity and chaos—how many times has it been used, yet one’s clarity remains unblemished? This is the master of life, who must be well nurtured. Only through daily cultivation can one succeed in this moment, where non-use becomes great use.

To sheath the blade well is to respond to things with leisure, to gather wisdom and conceal brilliance, letting things follow their nature and affairs reach their principle—yet one’s utility never diminishes. This is how the great recluses of old lived in the world, engaging with things yet always responsive and still, having attained this Way.

Thus, the essentials of learning the Dao begin with emptiness and stillness. Without emptiness, one cannot preserve the spirit; without stillness, one cannot return to destiny. When nature is whole and destiny restored, the work of nurturing life is complete. Like a mirror on its stand, it reflects without trace—what do things add to me? Ordinary people pursue things and lose their truth, cling to affairs and violate principle, tossed between gain and loss—how can they avoid harm? Thus, the pheasant in the marsh does not wish to be caged, as seen in later analogies. Lao Dan, the great sage, and Zhuangzi, his master, taught that death is but showing others how to rest in their time and abide in harmony, to guard constancy and fulfill one’s end. The marvel of transcending form and flying transformation is beyond the world’s measure. The death of a sage is called "spirit"—this is why Qin Shi mourned him with three cries, though he himself was a figure beyond conventional norms. Yet the disciples still doubted, so he explained: coming and going are fitting—rest in it, do not resist. This is the Lord’s release from suspension; the Creator cannot bind one.

To exhaust the principle of fuel is to see the fire transmitted endlessly. To exhaust the principle of nurturing form is to see the spirit preserved without perishing. Form ultimately has an end, but one cannot but nurture it. Thus, in the end, what is prized is...

To preserve wholeness and return it—when form is preserved and returned, the spirit is without error. Emerging from being and entering non-being, where can one go that is not right? Fuxi attained this and inherited the Mother of Qi; the Yellow Emperor attained this and ascended to the clouded heavens. Pengzu attained this and, riding the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, joined the ranks of the stars. The Supreme Ones say: "Those who die yet do not perish attain longevity."

**Scroll Two**
**Chapter Four: "Amid the Human World"**
*(Guo’s commentary: Those who engage with the human world cannot depart from it. Yet the vicissitudes of the human realm differ with each generation. Only those who are without self-will and do not act on their own can adapt to change without bearing its burdens.)*

Yan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and asked leave to depart, saying, "Where shall I go?"
"To Wei," said Confucius.
"What shall I do there?"
Yan Hui replied: "I have heard that the lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is solitary and reckless. He governs his state lightly yet fails to see his own faults. Thus, the people perish—so many that they are measured by the state’s expanse, like reeds in a marsh. The people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, Master: 'Leave well-governed states and go to disordered ones. The physician’s gate is crowded with the ill.' I wish to apply what I have heard and ponder its principles, that the state might perhaps be cured."

Confucius said, "Alas! You will likely go only to be punished. The Way does not tolerate杂乱.杂乱 leads to excess; excess leads to disorder; disorder leads to anxiety—and anxiety cannot be remedied. The perfected ones of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within yourself is not yet secure, how can you attend to the conduct of a violent man? Moreover, do you know how virtue is lost and whence knowledge arises?"

Names and knowledge arise from contention—contending for names, where men clash; knowledge, the instrument of contention. Both are ill-omened tools, not the means to perfect conduct. Moreover, when virtue is deep and trust steadfast, yet one’s qi remains unrecognized by others; when fame is heard but not contended for, yet one’s heart remains unrecognized, and one forcibly presents the language of benevolence and righteousness, the carpenter’s line and rule, before a violent man—this is to make others despise what is fine in you. Call it "harming others"; one who harms others will surely be harmed in return. How perilous to be such a harmer of men!

Furthermore, if you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, what use is it to seek distinction? If you refuse to instruct kings and lords, they will surely ride roughshod over others, provoking their defenses. Their eyes will dazzle, their complexion will level, their mouth will babble, their demeanor will take shape, and their heart will harden—this is like quenching fire with fire, flooding water with water. Call it "adding to the excess"; following the beginning without end, how perilous! With insincere, honeyed words, you will surely die before the violent man.

In ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both had cultivated themselves, humbling and soothing the people, yet contradicting their superiors. Thus, their rulers used their cultivation to cast them out: they were lovers of fame. In former days, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked the state of Youhu. Their lands were laid waste, their persons executed—yet their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no bounds. These were seekers of name and substance. Have you alone not heard of this? Even the sage cannot overcome name and substance—how much less can you?

Though it be so, you must have some purpose.

Pray, tell me: Yan Hui once came and said, "If I stand upright yet remain empty, strive earnestly and unite as one—would this suffice?"
I replied: "How could it be so? To take yang as fulfillment, to be full of brilliance and shifting hues—this is what the common man does not oppose. Following others' inclinations to seek their favor, the heart names this 'daily-accumulated virtue,' yet even this does not succeed—how much less can great virtue?
To cling rigidly without transformation, outwardly conforming while inwardly disdaining—how could this ever suffice?
Thus, if I inwardly straighten myself and outwardly bend, achieving compliance while aligning above: to be inwardly straight is to be a companion of Heaven. As a companion of Heaven, one knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven—yet would one alone seek to have one’s words approved by others, or seek others’ approval of oneself? Or would one fear others’ disapproval? If so, people would call one a child—this is what it means to be a companion of Heaven.
To be outwardly bent is to be a companion of men. Kneeling with clasped hands, bowing low—these are the rites of a minister. If all men do this, how dare I not do the same? To do what others do, others will find no fault—this is what it means to be a companion of men.
To achieve compliance while aligning above is to be a companion of antiquity. Though one’s words may seem admonishing, they are in truth the words of the ancients. What the ancients possessed, I do not possess. If so, though one be straight, it is no flaw—this is what it means to be a companion of antiquity. Would this then suffice?"
Confucius said: "How could it be so? Too many regulations and laws, though firm, are still without fault—yet this is all. How can one thus attain transformation? One who takes the mind as teacher remains so."

The annotations state:
- "Jiao" (蕉) is likened to grass and reeds.
- Cui interprets it as "its marshes appear as if mown," meaning the wilds are barren of green grass.
- Zhao explains: "The dead are measured by the state," where marshes filled with corpses use the marsh as their measure.
- As in "jiao yi" (蕉刈), the people are cut down like grass.
- Youhu was a state, now located in Hu County, Jingzhao. An abandoned dwelling is called "xu"; to die without heirs is to become a "li" (malevolent spirit). *Shu* and *shu* are synonymous. An ancient southern manuscript reads *yu* ().

Guo's commentary:
To act alone without sharing the people’s desires is to govern lightly. When a ruler lightly uses his state, every action stirs the people: one moment of anger brings corpses and flowing blood, one moment of joy fills the roads with carriages and caps. Thus, a ruler’s use of the state cannot be taken lightly.
Not seeing his faults, none dare admonish him. To lightly use the people’s lives is to treat them as expendable in death. "The dead are measured by the state"—like marshes of *jiao*, the whole state is cast into the realm of death, beyond counting, viewed as mere grass and reeds. The people have nowhere to turn.
The Dao does not tolerate杂乱. One must first rectify oneself and find the right person. If one does not find the right person, even a hundred physicians attending a single illness only deepen the doubt and fail to achieve a single cure.
The ancients’ perfected ones possessed the necessary qualities before engaging with the world. Those who do not empty their minds to respond to things but instead exhaust their thoughts in confronting difficulties reveal that what they hold within remains unsettled.
Only by externalizing knowledge to nurture the true, entrusting the wondrous to the multitude of talents, attributing merit and fame to others, and distancing oneself from personal concerns can one reach the conduct of violent men.
Moreover, virtue flows and scatters because of pride in fame. Knowledge spreads and overflows because of contention over goodness. Even Jie and Zhi, in what they prized and cherished, sought nothing beyond fame and goodness. Fame and knowledge are what the world employs, yet once fame arises, contention follows; once knowledge is used, strife emerges. Only by relinquishing fame and knowledge can one’s conduct be fully realized.
To offer a man a night-glowing pearl—few would not grasp their swords, for they do not yet understand. Yan Hui’s virtue, trustworthiness, and his reputation for non-contention—these they do not yet comprehend. To forcibly apply the standards of benevolence and righteousness to him would lead him to believe that Yan Hui seeks to destroy others to establish himself.
Thus, the perfected one does not employ the mind to order the world but empties the heart to respond to things. Sincerity and trust manifest in heaven and earth; non-contention flows through the myriad things. Only then do the myriad things return to embrace him, heaven and earth do not oppose him. When the resonance of virtue arises, the world responds; when the model of conduct shines, the six directions all follow. Only then can one traverse cold and heat, navigate order and chaos, without clashing with the逆鳞.
Those who harm others will inevitably be harmed in return. If one does not trust and accept, they will assume a contest for fame and retaliate with harm. If one can delight in the worthy and despise the foolish, hear righteousness and submit, one becomes an enlightened ruler. An enlightened ruler does not need worthy ministers. If you go, it will not be extraordinary; if you do not go, you will surely be harmed. To go with intention is not permissible; to respond without intention—if the response comes of itself, then there is nowhere one cannot go.
You need only remain silent and wordless. If you speak, kings and lords will wield their ruler’s authority to engage in verbal sparring, resisting admonition, adorning faults, and dazzling the eyes to confuse. Their countenance will flatten, unable to distinguish themselves from others. Their mouths will be occupied with self-justification, leaving no room for anything else. Their form and heart will conform, and they will release themselves to follow others. This is called "adding fuel to the fire," unable to save the situation but only furthering the other’s flourishing.
To follow the beginning endlessly, clinging to the usual and guarding the old, is to refuse change. Without trust, even earnest words become harmful when admonishing. Longfeng and Bigan took on the worries of those above while dwelling below—this was not their affair. Thus, their lord cast them out, unwilling to let ministers surpass their ruler in fame.
Violent rulers like Congzhi, Xuao, and Youhu were not merely indulgent in desire but also sought fame—though what they sought was not the Dao. Rulers who covet fame and lust for desire, even Yao and Yu could not transform them. Thus, to attack them with the multitude—how could you alone go empty-handed to transform them with the Dao?
Be upright and empty, rectify your form and empty your heart. Be diligent in one word, yielding and unwavering. To say "how could it be so?" is premature.
The Lord of Wei’s nature was arrogant and overbearing, swelling within and raging without—unyielding to the extreme. His countenance was unsettled, his joy and anger unpredictable. Such extreme obstinacy: when people provoke him with gratifying matters, he is overbearing and oppressive, then suppresses and humiliates them to seek ease, indulging his extravagant heart. Even minor virtues cannot be achieved. He will cling to his original intent, holding fast and refusing transformation. Your upright emptiness, diligent unity—outwardly conforming while inwardly unchanged—this is insufficient to transform him.
Yan Hui further proposed three principles:
- The inwardly straight is a companion of heaven: regarding things as without nobility or baseness, all equally receive life.
- Thus, whether good or not good, one entrusts it to impartiality. Seeking nothing from others, one relies on heaven’s principle, extending one’s nature and destiny like an infant’s straightforwardness.
- The outwardly bent is a companion of men: the outer form bends and curves, following what human affairs deem appropriate.
- To achieve compliance while aligning above is to be a companion of antiquity: achieving success in the present while comparing to the ancients—though this may seem like constant teaching with admonishing tones, one lodges straightness in antiquity, so it cannot be faulted.
Confucius still deemed this insufficient, for while it aligns with principle without contradiction, proposing three methods to govern and manage affairs does not merge with them. Though one may avoid blame and reproach, transformation remains unattained. This is because one clings to three arts to adapt to others, not entrusting the world to the mindless.

Lü's commentary:
Yan Hui wished to humble himself to extend the Dao, but the Master did not permit it, deeming杂多 a disturbance that cannot be remedied. First establishing oneself before establishing others—there is nowhere one cannot go. But Yan Hui’s self-establishment remains unsettled; how can he reach the conduct of violent men? Virtue scatters, knowledge emerges—tools of contention.
Moreover, profound virtue and steadfast trust suffice to reach others, enabling them to avoid baseness and perversity. Non-contention over names and ranks suffices to reach their hearts, preventing jealousy and doubt. Only then can one speak with them. Yet Yan Hui has not reached this and forcibly applies the language of benevolence and righteousness, standards and ink lines, to enlighten violent men before them—possessing beauty that others detest.
They merely love fame and contend with knowledge. To meet them with fame is to provoke them; to meet them with knowledge is to incite strife. If one can make them follow...

To wield these as lethal instruments is to invite calamity. Observe what they produce, and you will know what they revert to—Yan Hui’s approach would bring only disaster. If a ruler delights in worthiness and detests the unworthy, then you are already the same as he. Why seek difference? If you speak with him, you merely assent without instruction; he will surely exploit others, provoke contention, and fortify his defenses. His demeanor will bristle, his gaze will flash, and his heart will harden, seeking only escape or compliance—leaving no room for submission. This is like quenching water with water or fire with fire; compliance only begets endless beginnings.

He does not expect sincerity or depth from me, yet if I speak with him, I will surely perish before the violent. Long ago, Longfeng and Bigan cultivated themselves and soothed the people, yet their rulers, suspecting them of hoarding favor, cast them out—all for love of fame. Even Yao and Yu could not transform the barbarian states without destroying them. When it comes to names and realities, even sages cannot prevail—how much less can one like you?

Upright yet not utterly empty, striving yet not utterly unified, pride swells within and manifests without. To suppress others is to seek gratification; even minor virtue cannot be achieved—how much less great virtue? In correcting a ruler, one may achieve outward accord, but inwardly, he remains unchanged. What power is there to transform him?

To demand goodness from others based on one’s own words, to expect others to value what one despises—this is the error. From the perspective of the Dao, the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven. What distinction is there between them? Heaven, humanity, and antiquity form a single fellowship. Yan Hui, if you could adapt to these three, perhaps it would be possible. Yet to respond to things without attaining unity and emptiness of mind—this is why there is so much excess.

Outwardly, you entrust rectitude to antiquity, which is to govern others by law rather than by person, altering what they know. This is not true discernment. Discernment lies in secretly observing others’ intentions and grasping them—then it is secure. Even so, no harm may come, and transformation may follow, for though you guide with your heart, you have not yet attained heartlessness.

The newly transmitted passage states:
The sage has no name—thus they act without action. They possess no knowledge—thus they attain nothing. Without action, things naturally return to them; attaining nothing, nothing contends with them. The common person clings to name and employs knowledge—thus they act with action and seek attainment. With action, things do not submit; with attainment, things inevitably contend. Hence it is said: "Name is that by which one is constrained; knowledge is the instrument of strife."

Shuixi observes:
The phrases *"with eyes that scheme"* and *"with countenance that flattens"* vividly capture the evasive demeanor of the moment. At such times, one suddenly loses one’s sense of self, compelled to yield and retreat, with no opportunity for debate. The mouth strives to speak but cannot—only the lips move in restless agitation, revealing the distress. Though no words are uttered, the shifting expressions and deferential gestures already betray submission. The heart concedes, thinking to let it pass for now, planning for later—such are the inevitable turns of human nature. Previous interpretations have often missed this.

*Bicheng* notes:
*"If only you do not proclaim to the kings and lords"*—here, *"proclaim"* means official announcement. *"You must not announce to the kings and lords"*—if one speaks thus, one will surely set others against each other. The subsequent warnings all refer to Yan Hui.

Yan Hui said: "I have no means to advance further. May I ask the method?"
Confucius replied: "Fast—I will tell you. If you act with intention, will it be easy? That which is called easy is not fitting for the vast heavens."
Yan Hui said: "My family is poor; for months I have not drunk wine or eaten meat. Is this what you mean by fasting?"
Confucius said: "This is the fasting for sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind."
Yan Hui said: "May I ask what the fasting of the mind is?"
Confucius said: "Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind, but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at signs. Qi is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."
Yan Hui said: "Before I was instructed, I was truly myself. Once instructed, I could no longer regard myself as existing. Can this be called emptiness?"
The Master said: "You have attained it."

"Let me tell you: if you can enter and wander within its enclosure without being moved by its name—entering, then you may sing; not entering, then stop. Without gate, without harm, dwelling in one abode and lodging in necessity—then you are close.

To leave no trace is easy; to walk without treading the earth is hard. To be employed by others is easy; to feign for Heaven is hard. We have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. We have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge.

Behold that emptiness—from the vacant chamber, white arises; auspiciousness abides where it abides. Yet if one does not abide, this is called ‘sitting in motion.’ Following the ears and eyes inwardly, while the heart’s knowledge is cast outward—emptiness! Then ghosts and spirits will come to dwell, let alone men.

This is the transformation of the ten thousand things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the path nearly trod by Fuxi and Qi. How much more so for those who are scattered?"

Guo’s commentary:
To act with intention is indeed not easy; to regard effort as easy is to miss its proper measure. The one-minded refers to abandoning heterodoxies and embracing singularity. To forsake the ears and eyes, to discard the heart’s intentions, and to accord with the self-attainment of qi and nature—this is emptiness awaiting things. Only when Dao gathers in emptiness, when the heart is emptied, does the supreme Dao gather in the breast.

Before one is made to turn inward by reality, one has not yet attained the fasting of the mind, and thus possesses a self. When one is made to have never turned inward, having already attained the fasting of the mind’s command, then one is without a self. To enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by its name is to let the heart roam freely, attaining fulfillment and abiding in reality. It is like the resonance of gong and shang notes, responding without intent—thus it is called "sounding."

To respond without intent is to follow the ears of others, not forcing a response. It is to let things be as they are, without a gate; to entrust the world to its natural ease, without harm. "Harm" means governance; "inevitability" is the necessity of principle. To embody the abode of utmost oneness and guard against the tally of necessity—this is near indeed. Principle is exhausted in this.

To not act is easy; to act without treading the earth is impossible. To not do is easy; to do without harming nature is unattainable. What the eyes and ears perceive is coarse, thus easily deceived. As for the subtle retribution of the natural, it is difficult to falsify. The less one loses of the real, the less incomplete one is; the more one loses of the real, the more incomplete one is. The retribution of loss and gain never fails to match its portion. To defy Heaven and feign falsity—is this not difficult?

The analogy of wings and knowledge speaks of requiring the proper means to accomplish a task. Without the abode of utmost emptiness, there is no way to obtain the reality of transforming things. To regard being as non-being is the vacant chamber; in the vacant chamber, pure whiteness arises alone. The gathering of auspiciousness lies in utmost emptiness and stillness.

As for not abiding where one should, not guarding against extremes—this is to sit in motion all day, galloping without cease. Thus, before external enemies arrive, one is already exhausted within. How can one transform things? To make the ears...

The eyes and ears closed, what is naturally attained lies in the function of the heart’s knowing—beyond the external. Thus, to follow one’s nature and proceed directly is to be in darkness nowhere, free even from the burden of obscurity and dimness, let alone the burdens of the human world. Things hold no inherent nobility or baseness; none exist apart from the heart’s knowing, the ears and eyes.

The ears and eyes are what connect the self to the world. Thus, what the world calls "knowing"—is it knowing because one desires to know? What it calls "seeing"—is it seeing because one strives to see? If knowing and seeing could be obtained through desire and effort, then could one desire to be worthy and become worthy, strive to be a sage and become a sage? Certainly not.

Yet the world fails to understand that knowing arises of itself, and so seeks to know through forced knowing; that seeing arises of itself, and so strives to see through forced seeing. Not recognizing that life arises of itself, one then attempts to generate life through forced generation. Thus, seeing the eyes, one demands the clarity of Li Lou; hearing the ears, one expects the acuity of Shi Kuang. The heart’s spirit races within, the ears and eyes exhaust themselves without, and the body finds no ease—how then can one guard against things? Without such guard, how can one harmonize with the changes of the human world or respond to the rhythms of generation upon generation? Never has this been possible.

The Dao in detail: ["What arises from deliberate action" has long been questioned by the ancients. Where there is thought, there must be alignment; where there is action, there must be caution. Thus, those who would illumine their virtue with spirit must first fast the heart—this is what Confucius taught Yan Hui.

Wenzi said: In higher learning, one listens with spirit; in middle learning, one listens with the heart; in lower learning, one listens with the ears. If listening stops at the ears, it is limited to what the ears can hear; if the heart stops at signs, it is confined to what the heart can align with. But when one listens with qi, there is nowhere it does not reach—vast, flowing, and unobstructed. This is using form without being used by form, engaging with things without being bound by things. Empty yet unimpeded, responsive yet not retaining, thus a single focus preserves the qi, preserving the qi leads to attaining emptiness, and attaining emptiness gathers the Dao. This is the meaning of fasting the heart.]

Xu Xi [notes]: "Fences" are external and need not be deep; "names" are without substance—even the virtue-less among kings and dukes are without substance. There are no gates without poison; all things bear poison. Do not regard their poison, for there has never been a gate without poison. This means that in the human world, nothing is too deep or too shallow—all is to be feared. Once one enters, it is like a traveler lodging at a desolate inn along a forsaken road, responding wearily without contrivance.]

Jingchuan [remarks]: The inner communion of the ears and eyes shares the same meaning as the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s "perfect penetration through the ear faculty."

*Brush Strokes* [states]: Whether serving as Heaven’s envoy or as man’s, whether in the state of never having been employed or in the state of being employed, when one’s service aligns [with the Dao], Yan Hui heard "fasting the heart" as emptiness and suddenly awakened. Thus it is said: "Yan Hui’s inability to move at will was due to the self."

One who can move at will does so without the self. The Master sighed in perfect admiration and further instructed him, saying: "You may wander within its confines yet remain unmoved by fame. When intent aligns, speak; when it does not, cease. Vast and without gate, serene and without poison—abide in this as though compelled, and you approach the threshold. This threshold is the verge of being without self.

To sever all traces is to reaffirm this principle: to cease movement and leave no trace is easy; to act without treading upon the earth is difficult. When employed by man, the self remains, making deception easy. When employed by Heaven, the self vanishes, making deception impossible. To know without relying on knowledge, to walk without relying on steps, to fly without relying on wings—this is the work of Heaven’s envoy. This is what is called emptiness. When the chamber is empty, brightness arises; when the heart is empty, the Dao gathers. It is not that auspiciousness exists, yet no greater auspiciousness can be found. For one who seeks to settle the body and lodge the mind, to abandon this is to have no refuge. Yet if one persists in this, what else is it but *sitting in distraction*?

*Sitting in distraction* is like speaking of *drowning on dry land*—the human heart naturally comes to rest, yet one stubbornly clings to the belief that it does not, like a horse tethered in its stall while its mind gallops a thousand miles. Even if one sits in silent seclusion among mountains and forests, this only compounds the disturbance. When the ears and eyes commune inwardly, there is no hearing or seeing external to the heart; when knowledge is absent, there is no thought or action. Only then can one speak of emptiness, and even spirits will come to dwell. How much more so for men? This is how one commands the transformations of the myriad things without being transformed by them—what the ancient sages practiced throughout their lives."

Ye [She] asked Master Gongzi Gao, who was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi: "The king has entrusted this mission to Zhu Liang, placing great importance on Qi’s treatment of envoys. They will likely show utmost respect but no urgency. Even a commoner cannot be swayed lightly—how much less a feudal lord? I am deeply apprehensive. You once told Zhu Liang: 'In all matters, great or small, few succeed without relying on the Dao to bring joy. If the matter fails, one inevitably faces human calamity; if it succeeds, one faces the calamity of yin and yang. Only those of virtue can succeed or fail without disaster.'

I eat coarse food and do not hoard, guarding against desire like a man of purity. Yet this morning I received my orders, and by evening I am drinking ice—does this not reveal my inner turmoil? Have I not yet reached the truth of the matter? For once the affair is underway, the calamity of yin and yang is already present. If it fails, the calamity of human retribution will follow. These are two outcomes, and as a minister, I am unworthy of such a task. Please instruct me."

Confucius replied: "Under heaven, there are two great precepts: the first is fate, the second is duty. Your love for your parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is no place in heaven or earth where one may escape it. These are called the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, one finds peace regardless of circumstance—this is the perfection of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds peace regardless of the task—this is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, sorrow and joy do not alter one’s bearing. To foresee the inevitable yet accept it as fate—this is the perfection of virtue.

For a minister or child, there are always unavoidable circumstances. To act according to the nature of affairs while forgetting the self—how could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death? Your conduct is already sufficient. Let me add what I have heard: In close dealings, trust must be mutual; in distant dealings, words must convey loyalty. Words may be transmitted, but those that please both sides or anger both sides are the most perilous in the world. When both are pleased, there is an excess of flattery; when both are angered, there is an excess of slander. All excess is falsehood. Falsehood breeds doubt in the listener, and the transmitter of such words invites misfortune. Thus, the proper teaching says: Transmit the constant truth, not the excess of words—then you approach perfection."

---

Guo’s commentary: "The king’s emphasis on Zhu Liang’s mission indicates a desire to make a request. His 'utmost respect without urgency' suggests fear of an empty display of courtesy without promptly fulfilling the request. In matters great or small, few succeed without relying on words to bring joy—this is what Confucius once told Zhu Liang. If the matter fails, there is the calamity of human retribution, for success would have brought joy, while failure invites anger. This is something even the King of Chu cannot avoid. If the matter succeeds, there is the calamity of yin and yang: though the external trouble may pass, joy and fear still wage war in the breast, freezing and scorching the five viscera.

Only those of virtue can entrust success or failure to others without distressing the heart. 'Guarding against desire like a man of purity' means facing fire without longing for coolness, revealing the frugality of his fare. His frugal fare and inner turmoil, leading him to drink ice, stem from genuine concern over the difficulty of the task, not the allure of fine food. Before the matter is resolved, he fears only failure. If it truly fails, fear will knot within while the net of punishment ensnares without—hence the two calamities.

'Cannot be untied from the heart' means it is naturally and firmly bound, impossible to undo. 'No place in heaven or earth to escape' means that among a thousand gathered, if none serves as master, disorder or dissolution follows. Many worthy men cannot serve many lords; no worthy men cannot serve no lord—this is the inevitable principle of heaven and man. If lords could be escaped and parents untied, they would not be precepts. Thus, they are called the great precepts.

To 'know the inevitable' is fate; to accept it is to be without sorrow or joy—how could one’s bearing change? Thus, one calmly regards all encounters as fate, without applying the heart to them, merging with the ultimate rightness as one, without joy or sorrow. Even in serving ordinary men, one finds no obstacle—how much more so for lord and parent?

Affairs have their inevitable principles, and reason is always coherent. For a minister or child, to undertake them is to ensure success; if the matter succeeds but the self is lost, such a case has never existed. Why trouble the heart over the self? If one’s commitment to the Dao is not steadfast and delight or aversion lingers, one cannot proceed with the ultimate rightness, and no success can be achieved in scheming for life or fearing death.

'Close dealings must be mutual in trust' means that proximity allows verification, so trust and submission are mutual. 'Distant dealings must convey loyalty through words' means that from afar, words convey intent. Words of pleasure or anger, if they exceed reality, should be transmitted without losing the mean—hence the difficulty. All excess is falsehood: the speaker’s words are suspect, and the transmitter’s embellishments are reckless. 'Mo' means doubt."

The transmitter of words incurs misfortune; when words are transmitted, exaggeration resembles deceit. The receiver, harboring doubt, then transmits them, and the transmitter arbitrarily alters their weight—thus fault arises.

Citing legal principles as evidence: though one may hear words that overstep in the moment, they should not be transmitted. One must invoke the speaker’s usual disposition and demand their sincere intent—only then does it approach wholeness.

Xu Xi says: Few do not rely on the Dao to achieve joyful completion; there has never been one who, departing from the Dao, could bring about perfect fulfillment without later regret. As for sustenance, grasping the coarse and guarding against desire, purity arises of itself. One may claim to serve through toil and labor, yet if there is no seeking in the world, even among family, how much more so within? To drink ice inwardly—if one chases profit and races outward, then anxiety and sorrow follow. Profound indeed is the distress!

Bi Sheng says: Lord Ye’s worries lay in gain and loss, yet the extreme of loss is nothing more than death. Thus the Master resolved it with life and death. Even those who speak of loyalty and filial piety can discuss serving their own hearts—how much less should joy and sorrow be applied to what lies ahead? For now, it is not easy to speak of. In serving the heart, the self is forgotten; when the self is forgotten, joy and sorrow have nowhere to settle—how could they be applied to what lies ahead? Thus it concludes: in the circumstances of acting, forget the self—how then would there be leisure to delight in life and abhor death? Delight in life and abhorrence of death are precisely what joy and sorrow consist of. Knowing there is nothing to be done and resting content in fate, Xu Xi says: this single phrase is magnanimous and clear, its discourse overflowing with ease. "Nothing to be done" does not mean despondency—such is its self-determination.

Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with yang but invariably end...

Where contention arises from skill and strength, it begins with yang but invariably ends in yin—once extreme yin prevails, cunning and artifice abound. Those who drink wine with ritual propriety begin in order, yet invariably end in chaos—once excess prevails, extravagant pleasures multiply. All affairs follow this pattern: they begin in sincerity, yet invariably conclude in deceit. To despise their inception is to dismiss their simplicity; to neglect their conclusion is to invite their ruin. Grand words are but wind and waves; action is the loss of substance. For wind and waves stir easily, and the loss of substance courts danger. Thus, anger arises from no other cause than artful speech and biased words—like a beast at bay, its final cries are not chosen. Its qi scatters in disarray, and from this, the heart grows harsh and exacting. When exactingness becomes extreme, a base and unworthy heart inevitably responds, though one knows not why. If one does not know why, how can one foresee the end? Thus the *Fa Yan* says: "Do not alter decrees; do not urge completion—excess is harmful." To alter decrees and urge completion is perilous. Beauty lies in lasting success; evil, in failure to amend—can one not be cautious?

Moreover, to ride things and roam the heart, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there for contrived recompense? Better to deliver one’s mandate—this is the most difficult.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
Those who contend with skill and strength begin with playful rivalry, desiring victory. When passions run high, they secretly harbor harm for others and no longer follow reason. Those who drink wine with ritual propriety observe distinctions of rank and order in toasts. Yet when drunkenness and excess take hold, chaos spreads without restraint. For complexity arises from simplicity, and affairs emerge from prevention—this is an inevitable tendency. Words are wind and waves; thus, to act upon them is to lose substance. To abandon wind and waves and not act is to preserve substance. When affairs attain their substance, danger can be stabilized, and turmoil can be settled.

Anger arises from no other cause than artful speech exceeding reality and biased words missing the mark. Like a wild beast cornered, when pressed to its limit, its desperation spent, it does not choose harmonious sounds—its qi scatters in disarray, and violent rage arises, inviting blame in response. To be broad and accommodating is to draw all things to oneself. Yet when exactingness becomes too precise, a miserly heart arises unawares. If one does not awaken to this, how can one know where fortune and misfortune converge?

Thus the great person, vast and unconstrained, releases things into the realm of self-attainment—unlike others, they do not exhaust another’s joy. Therefore, the bonds of the Four Seas may be preserved. "Do not alter decrees" means transmitting their substance; "do not urge completion" means allowing them to reach fruition on their own.

Excess is harm in disguise—what is added ceases to be the natural truth. True beauty in completion lies in following the transformations of time, like planting seeds that cannot mature in a single morning. If one forces completion upon what another detests, regret and failure soon follow. Thus it is said: what is wrongly completed cannot be amended.

Riding things to roam the mind, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—words lodge in things to convey meaning, yielding to the inevitability of principle: this is the mark of perfect equilibrium. Such is the ultimate way of engaging with things. Why impose one’s intentions upon the natural recompense of things? Far better to devote oneself wholly to the task—this is the difficult path. To speak plainly, devotion is easiest, yet applying the heart through joy and anger makes it hard.

**New Transmission**
Silence cannot be disturbed by things, while speech invites response—and response disrupts stillness. Thus it is said: words are wind and waves. Without action, traces remain hidden; with action, traces become manifest. When traces appear externally, inner truth vanishes. Thus it is said: action is the loss of reality. Without stillness, one is moved; without inner truth, rest becomes difficult. Thus it is said: wind and waves easily stir, and the loss of reality easily endangers.

**Brush Jottings**
Those who transmit words of mutual joy or mutual anger yet dare not exceed them do so because ensuring a good end requires caution from the outset. Observe those who compete in strength: they begin with vigor but end in exhaustion. Those who drink begin with order but end in chaos. Thus one knows that human interactions start with trust but end in pettiness, and that small matters in life begin insignificantly but inevitably grow great.

A single word uttered may incite another’s fury—is this not a wind and wave? Once provoked, the person will act upon their anger—is this not the loss of reality? Thus, the arousal of wrath arises without cause: it stems from cunning speech and biased words, which invariably exceed the truth, disregarding right principle. Like a beast fearing death, it does not choose pleasing sounds; its breath issues forth in a frenzy, and the listener’s heart, too, becomes fierce—thus wrath is aroused.

Those who reprove others too harshly or scrutinize too severely do so in hope of another’s improvement. Yet if the other responds with an unworthy heart, one ought to know when to desist. If one fails to recognize this, resentment accumulates into harm, and the outcome will be unforeseeable—will it end, as before, in pettiness, or in something far greater?

When a lord’s command is altered at a general’s whim, or when unfinished affairs are forced through with urging, these are instances of excessive praise or blame. As it is said: excess is harmful. When words are exaggerated, the messenger courts disaster—how can one be without peril?

That which is beautifully accomplished endures: to bring out another’s goodness requires leisurely, deep, and prolonged engagement before it can take root. That which is badly done cannot be undone: a single resentful word may ruin a matter entirely, and by the time the heart hardens, regret will come too late.

Those who delight in excessive speech invariably harbor some intent and cannot remain empty. Thus it is with the ear.

Riding the things of the world while roaming the mind is to forget the self; entrusting oneself to necessity is to forget things. Thus, following its mandate and bringing it to fruition, I remain without intent—why must there be some action to repay it?

The Master’s teaching to Leaf Duke was once thought secondary to that given to Yan Hui, yet in truth it too could not depart from emptiness.

Yan He was about to instruct the Crown Prince of Duke Ling of Wei and so inquired of Qu Boyu: “There is a man here whose virtue is as if Heaven itself had slain him. If I deal with him without method, it will endanger our state; if I deal with him with method, it will endanger my person. His wisdom is just sufficient to perceive others’ faults but not their causes. In such a case, what am I to do?” Qu Boyu replied: “Excellent question! Be cautious, be prudent—rectify your own person! In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in mind, nothing surpasses harmony. Yet even these two have their perils: in compliance, one must not overstep; in harmony, one must not overreach. If in form you comply and overstep, you will invite collapse, ruin, downfall, and stumbling. If in mind you harmonize and overreach, you will invite clamor, fame, calamity, and misfortune. If he acts like an infant, then act like an infant with him. If he abandons all boundaries, then abandon all boundaries with him. If he casts off all limits, then cast off all limits with him. Reach this and you will enter the realm of flawlessness.

Do you not know the mantis? In its fury, it brandishes its arms to block the wheel-ruts of a chariot, unaware of its own incapacity—such is the beauty of its talent!”

Beware, take heed! When one accumulates boasts of one’s beauty and talent to provoke others, one approaches peril.

Do you not know the keeper of tigers? He dares not feed it living prey, lest it rouse the fury of killing. He dares not feed it whole prey, lest it rouse the fury of tearing. He times its hunger and satiety, he fathoms the heart of its rage. Though tigers and humans differ in kind, the tiger fawns upon its keeper—this is compliance. Thus, what provokes its killing is defiance.

Now, the lover of horses: he gathers their dung in a basket, collects their urine in a conch shell. Yet when a gnat or fly alights and he claps it too hastily, the horse breaks its bit, shatters its bridle, smashes its chest and head. His intent may be perfect, but his love may yet bring loss. Can one not be cautious?

The petty man’s nature is such that if you guide him by rules, he resents you; if you let him run unbounded, he brings chaos to the state. Unaware that the people’s faults arise from himself, he blames the people and never reforms. To rectify your person is to turn back and guard against both extremes—this is how one rectifies the self.

In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in mind, nothing surpasses harmony. Compliance does not mean discord, harmony does not mean sameness. “Compliance” means the form follows; “entering” means returning to sameness. “Harmony” means aiding with virtue; “exiting” means self-display. If you fully merge with another, you will stumble and not support them, perishing together. Thus, one should model oneself on Heaven and Earth, setting no petty distinctions.

If you display harmony and yet harbor resentment, you will invite the clamor of bearing shame and the fame of aiding others—he will resent your superiority and recklessly spawn calamity. Therefore, one should remain obscure, blending with the dust, so that none can draw near or distance themselves, benefit or harm you.

The seven lines beginning “If he acts like an infant...” speak of not setting sharp edges to provoke his scales. The mantis’s fury in raising its arms is not without beauty, yet it cannot match the chariot’s wheel-ruts. Now, knowing your incapacity yet forcing yourself to bear the task—this is the mantis’s fury.

“Accumulating boasts of your talent’s beauty to provoke others” is a path of danger. Hence the warning: “lest it rouse the fury of killing” means fearing that a killing intent will lead to rage. “Lest it rouse the fury of tearing” means that if you make the tiger bite and divide the prey itself, it will grow enraged from the effort. “Timing its hunger and satiety, fathoming the heart of its rage” means knowing why it rages and complying with it. Compliance with principle breeds affection even among different kinds; defiance of the proper order turns even the closest into enemies—this is why the tiger fawns upon its keeper.

Dung and urine are the basest things, yet he stores them in precious vessels—such is the utmost love for a horse. Clapping it too hastily breaks the bit, shatters the bridle, smashes its chest and head. Though he meant to remove the nuisance, startling the horse leads to this. “His intent may be perfect, but his love may yet bring loss” means that in striving to remove the nuisance, he acts rashly and causes destruction, losing what he loved. Thus, in all worldly dealings, one must be cautious in matters of compliance and defiance.

Lü’s Annotation: ["Approaching" errs by entering—entering makes one identical with it; "harmonizing" errs by departing—departing makes one different from it. Thus one falls into ruin, collapse, and downfall, becoming a portent of fame and ill omen. This is because in becoming identical with it, one does not know how to support it; in becoming different from it, one does not know how to comply with it. Treat it as an infant, guiding it to flawlessness—then, though you move with it without fixed method, you will not endanger the state; though you move with it by fixed method, you will not endanger yourself. For you follow what its nature already possesses and open the way for it—this is the subtlety of responding to its mechanism and transforming it. As when King Xuan favored courage and wealth, yet Mencius guided him toward the Kingly Way.]

Critique of *Zhuangzi*: [The six lines beginning "Treat it as an infant" correspond to "shaping" without desiring to enter; "guiding it to flawlessness" corresponds to "harmonizing" without desiring to depart. The passage on loving the horse illustrates the idea that what is beautifully formed endures, while what is badly formed cannot be altered.]

Supplementary Annotation: [The passage beginning "Treat it as an infant" is like the *Lotus Sutra*, where "if beings are to be delivered by the form of a bhikṣu, the Buddha appears as a bhikṣu to teach the Dharma; if they are to be delivered by the form of a woman, the Buddha appears as a woman to teach the Dharma." The phrase "clapping it too hastily" shows excessive love for the horse—seeing a mosquito, one suddenly swats it, startling the horse, which then reacts in alarm. Though the tiger is most ferocious, compliance tames it; though the horse is easily tamed, startling it makes it violent. Thus, in dealing with evil people, one must be cautious. If one does not carefully assess the moment or measure one’s strength, merely seeking to impose method upon the methodless, it is like the mantis angrily raising its arms to block the chariot wheel.]

When Master Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi, halfway along the road at Qu Yuan he saw an oak that was a sacred tree. It was so large that a hundred oxen could shelter in its shade; its girth measured a hundred spans. Its height towered above the mountain, and only after seventy feet did branches appear. A dozen or more of its side limbs could be made into boats. Spectators thronged around it like a marketplace, but the master carpenter did not glance at it and continued on his way without stopping. His disciple, having gazed his fill, ran to catch up with Master Carpenter Shi and said, "Since I took up the axe to follow you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent as this. Why did you not even deign to look at it, but walk on without pause?"

"Enough!" he said. "Say no more!"

A worthless tree—this!
Make it into a boat, and it sinks;
make it into a coffin or outer coffin, and it rots quickly;
make it into a vessel, and it breaks quickly;
make it into a door or gate, and it oozes sap;
make it into a pillar, and it is eaten by worms.
This is a tree of no use—
no purpose to which it can be put.
That is why it has attained such longevity.

Master Carpenter Shi returned home, and the sacred oak appeared to him in a dream, saying:
“With what will you compare me?
Will you compare me to the so-called ‘useful trees’?
Look at the crabapple, pear, orange, pomelo, and other fruit-bearing trees:
when their fruit ripens, they are stripped and humiliated;
their great branches are broken, their small branches are torn.
This is because their abilities bring suffering to their lives.
Thus they do not complete their Heaven-appointed years but die halfway,
having been struck down by the common world.
All things are like this.
As for me, I have sought to be of no use for a long time—
only now, on the verge of death, have I attained it.
This is of great use to me.
Had I been useful, could I have grown so vast?
Moreover, you and I are both things—
how could one thing judge another?
How could a man on the verge of death, a worthless man, know a worthless tree?”

Master Carpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple said:
“If it seeks to be of no use, why does it serve as a sacred tree?”
He replied:
“Hush! Say no more.
It merely lodges there,
as if to escape the scorn of those who do not understand it.
Were it not a sacred tree, would it not have been felled long ago?”

Moreover, that which it preserves differs from the common—yet to praise it for its righteousness is far indeed. The untrammeled tree stands apart from those counted as useful; the so-called "cultivated trees" are but things that wound themselves through their very utility. "Only now, on the verge of death, have I attained it"—this speaks of how often others have looked askance at it, and only now does Carpenter Shi recognize its truth. "Of great use to me" means that the accumulation of uselessness becomes the greatest aid to life; had it been useful, it would long since have been felled. "How could a man on the verge of death, a worthless man, know a worthless tree?"—this is but his playful address to Carpenter Shi.

The disciple still finds fault, believing the tree takes pride in serving as a sacred tree, not merely seeking to be of no use. Carpenter Shi replies that the sacred tree merely lodges there of its own accord—it is not that the tree sought to become one. It regards the sacred tree as those who do not understand it, who would revile and afflict it. How could this be an honor? Its nature is to take uselessness as its use; even if it were not a sacred tree, it would still avoid the harm of being felled.

That which it preserves differs from the common: it takes having nothing to preserve as its preservation, while others take having something to preserve as theirs. The purpose of the sacred tree is to benefit others, nurture things, and restrain people from wrongdoing. Yet the useless remains serene, doing nothing, while the various talents naturally find their place; each attains its proper order without interference. This is how the useless preserves itself. For you to praise it as a sacred tree is to draw no closer to its truth.

Southward Master Ziqi wandered to the mound of Shang, where he saw a great tree. Its branches were so vast that a thousand chariots could shelter beneath them, finding shade and refuge. Ziqi exclaimed, "What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!" Looking upward at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and twisted, unfit for beams or rafters. Gazing downward at its massive roots, he found them split and fissured, unsuitable for coffins or outer caskets. Tasting its leaves, his mouth blistered and burned. Inhaling its scent, he fell into a frenzied stupor that lasted three days without end.

Ziqi said, "This is truly a useless tree—yet it has grown so immense! Alas, the spirit-like person finds refuge in such uselessness. In the state of Song, there is a region called Jing where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrive. Those slender enough to grasp in one’s arms are felled by those seeking pegs for monkey traps. Those three or four spans in girth are cut down by those desiring lofty, renowned beams. Those seven or eight spans wide are hewn by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants in search of fine side planks. Thus, these trees do not live out their natural years but are prematurely felled by axes midway—such is the calamity of being useful.

"Hence, the ox with a white forehead, the pig with an upturned snout, or the man with hemorrhoids are deemed unfit to cross the river—this the shamans and priests have long known, for these are considered inauspicious. Yet this is precisely how the spirit-like person attains the greatest inauspiciousness."

The term *zhóu jiě* refers to wood grain that spirals and scatters; *chénɡ* denotes the sickness of drunkenness; *yì* are the pegs used to perch playful monkeys; *lì* signifies the beams of a house; *lǐ* should be written as *lì*, meaning lofty and renowned, or the grand households of the eminent. Sima [Biao] explains that *shàn bànɡ* refers to one complete side of a coffin. The phrase *shì hé* means to sink a person into the river as an offering, as in the case of Ximen Bao. Luo Miandao notes that in ancient times, the Son of Heaven performed the *jiě* sacrifice in spring, as recorded in the *Han Shu: Jiaosi Zhi*, where *jiě* means to absolve sins and seek blessings.

Guo’s commentary:
To conceal and shelter what one finds fragrant—its branches provide shade ample enough to hide a thousand chariots. The Heavenly King, being "useless," leaves the hundred officials to their tasks: the clear-sighted observe for him, the keen-eared listen for him, the wise counsel for him, and the brave defend for him. What, then, does he do? He remains profoundly silent, and yet the various talents do not fail in their proper roles—thus, "uselessness" is precisely what the truly useful depend upon. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without tiring, and he rides upon the myriad things without harm.

The ox with a white forehead, the pig with an upturned snout, and the man with hemorrhoids—shamans and priests perform exorcisms to cast these three aside. They meticulously select only flawless, unblemished sacrificial animals before daring to use them. In this, the shamans and priests recognize that "uselessness" preserves wholeness. Yet wholeness in life is what the world calls auspicious. How strange that shamans and priests deem "uselessness" inauspicious and refuse to employ it!

The world deems such "inauspiciousness" that preserves life as the greatest auspice. The spirit-like person is one without fixed intent, who flows with things—thus, what the world calls the greatest auspice, the spirit-like person does not oppose.

**Lü’s Annotation:** The preceding passage discussed the great tree that completes its natural span through "uselessness," followed by the catalpa and cypress felled by axes due to their "usefulness." Thus, the sage and spirit-like person delve even deeper into the application of things, concealing their utility even more profoundly. Therefore, "uselessness" becomes the means by which usefulness is realized, and "non-material" becomes the instrument through which material is employed. Those who wander the world while sharing in the fortunes and misfortunes of the people must especially understand this.

There was a man named Zhīlí Fáng: his chin was hidden in his navel, his shoulders rose above his crown, his topknot pointed to the heavens, his five viscera’s points faced upward, his thighs flanked his ribs. By sewing and washing clothes, he earned enough to feed himself; by sifting and winnowing grain, he sustained ten others. When the authorities conscripted warriors, Zhīlí Fáng waved his arms among them; when major labor was demanded, he was excused due to his chronic ailment. When the state distributed grain to the infirm, he received three *zhong* and ten bundles of firewood. Though his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose *virtue* is deformed?

**Guo’s Annotation:** When conscripting warriors, he waved his arms among them, relying on his "uselessness" and thus not hiding himself. When major labor was demanded, he was excused because he could not perform the work. If labor was not assigned, he accepted the rewards. Even one whose body was deformed could preserve himself thus. The spirit-like person is of no use to things, yet each thing attains its own use, returning merit and fame to the multitude of talents, blending with things without trace. Thus, he avoids the harms of the human world and dwells in the true beauty of constancy—this is one whose *virtue* is deformed.

**Following the Text:** *Xún* (navel) is interchangeable with *qí* (belly). A hunchback’s chin is hidden in the space between his navel. His shoulders rise above his crown because his head is lowered, making his shoulders higher than his crown. *Kuài* (topknot) is read as *cuō* (to gather). *Fáng* (to gather) is combined with *cuō* (to bind hair into a topknot). In ancient times, topknots were close to the nape, so when one’s back was bent and head lowered, the topknot pointed upward. *Guǎn* refers to the *shù* (acupuncture points), meaning the points of the five viscera all faced upward. The two thighs flanked the ribs, as the spine lies within the thighs, so the thighs were considered the ribs. *Cuò zhēn* means sewing clothes; *zhì xiè* means washing clothes. *Gǔ fáng bō jīng* means using a winnowing basket to sift grain.

Confucius traveled to Chu, where the madman Jiē Yú wandered near his gate, singing: *"Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! The future cannot be awaited, the past cannot be retrieved. When the world has the Dao, the sage achieves; when the world lacks the Dao, the sage survives. In this age, one barely escapes punishment. Blessings are lighter than feathers—who knows their weight? Disasters are heavier than earth—who knows how to avoid them? Cease! Cease! Applying virtue to others is perilous! Perilous! Drawing lines on the ground and following them—O brambles, brambles, do not harm my path! I walk my way—O thorns, thorns, do not wound my feet! The mountain tree seals itself, the grease feeds the flame. Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is slashed. All know the use of the useful, but none know the use of the useless!"*

**Guo’s Annotation:** *"Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined!"*—This speaks of following the times and moving forward to fulfill what is fitting. The rise and fall of the world are too subtle to perceive, hence *"How your virtue has declined!"* The future cannot be awaited, the past cannot be retrieved—one must fully grasp the present moment’s fittingness. *"When the world has the Dao, the sage achieves; when the world lacks the Dao, the sage survives."*—This means leaving things to their natural course, where principle arises of itself. Achievement and survival are not of my doing—how could order or chaos alter one’s rhythm? Order seeks its own achievement, so abandoning achievement prevents failure; chaos seeks its own survival, so forgetting survival avoids death. *"In this age, one barely escapes punishment."*—This means not looking ahead or behind, but fully attending to the present moment’s fittingness. Only by merging with the times can one attain subtlety and completeness, escaping punishment and preserving one’s name. *"Blessings are lighter than feathers—who knows their weight?"*—Feet can walk, yet they are released; hands can grasp, yet they are entrusted. Ears hear what they hear, eyes see what they see—knowing when to stop at what one does not know, using what one can use, letting each thing use itself and act for itself, indulging one’s nature inwardly without the slightest concern for what lies beyond—this is the utmost ease of non-action. There has never been one who practiced non-action yet failed to preserve their nature and life. If one’s nature and life are preserved, yet it is not called blessing, such a principle has never been heard of. Thus, blessing is simply what was previously called wholeness—it is not borrowed from external things. How could it bear the weight of a goose feather?

To follow one’s nature in movement—such movement never exceeds its proper measure: this is the utmost ease in the world. To lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself—this is the utmost lightness in the world. Yet knowing injures the nature with boundlessness, and the heart sways the true with likes and dislikes. Thus, one abandons this utmost ease of non-action and pursues that utmost difficulty of action; one discards this utmost lightness of self-lifting and takes up that utmost weight of bearing others—this is the common affliction of the world.

Disaster is heavier than earth—who knows to avoid it? When one acts from what lies within the nature, even bearing ten thousand *jun* feels no weight. When external things are entrusted to it, though heavy, they do not exceed a fraction of a *zhu*—yet one may still prove unequal to the task. This is inner blessing. Thus, blessing is the lightest; this is outer disaster. Thus, disaster is the heaviest. That disaster is heavy yet none know to avoid it—this is the great delusion of the world.

To draw a line on the ground and make others follow it—its end cannot be concealed. To have done with one’s own concerns and face things without guarding against them—this is how the great person does not dazzle others with their own brilliance but lets others shine on their own; does not impose their virtue upon others but lets others attain on their own. Thus, they pervade and unite the ten thousand things, merging with the world as one, and inner and outer share in blessing.

To be deluded by yang is still to lose yang. If one loses yang yet entrusts oneself to solitude without being swayed by externals, then one’s conduct is whole. If the world all preserves their own wholeness, then all who bear the name of "self" are wholly preserved. In one’s conduct, if there is crookedness without harm to one’s feet, the crookedness completes the walk, and each is sufficient in itself. When there is use, it joins with others to achieve; when there is no use, it preserves its own life.

To carve one’s flesh and skin for the sake of the world—this is what the world knows. To allow the hundred clans not to lose their self-preservation and to let self and others both find harmony—this is so subtle that one does not sense its wonder within oneself.

When the world has the Dao, the sage can accomplish success; when the world lacks the Dao, the sage preserves life alone. In the present age—a time of chaos—merely escaping punishment is considered fortunate. How dare one seek anything more? To live in chaos and merely escape punishment to preserve life is but a feather’s blessing, yet one does not know to bear it. The disasters of a chaotic age often reach the point of killing the body—this is heavier than earth—yet one does not know to avoid them. To face others with virtue is the way to invite disaster; it is no better than drawing lines on the ground and rushing to follow them. How constrained and self-afflicting! How perilous!

The catalpa, the cassia, the cinnamon, the lacquer tree—all are felled and cannot hide themselves. Those who seek fame in the world to court disaster are like this.

To face others with virtue is not yet to be obscure in the Dao; to draw lines and rush to follow is not yet to erase one’s traces. "Deluded yang" speaks of dimming one’s own brightness to avoid harming the conduct of preserving life. "Crookedness" speaks of withdrawing the body and bending to preserve it, without harming the feet that can walk.

In "my conduct is crooked," *qiequ* should follow *Bixu* as *qiequ*. *Qiequ* does no harm to one’s feet, which aligns with the preceding text. This is likely due to a scribal error repeating "my conduct." "Deluded yang" encourages the Dao, saying it is like the fern. The fern grows thickly and can obscure the path of yang brightness, hence "deluded yang." This is a metaphorical expression, and its meaning is quite unusual—it is preserved to broaden the range of knowledge.

In living in the human world, the relationship between ruler and minister is of greatest importance and cannot be neglected. Yet one must carefully consider what is appropriate, prudently attend to the timing of advance and withdrawal, and observe past and present without shame. To transcend regret and resentment and preserve oneself alone—this is excellence.

Thus, when Yanzi was about to go to Wei, the Master thoroughly explained the many perils of serving a ruler: the clashing of fame and knowledge, the obstruction of the heart and qi, the eventual arrival of both praise and slander, the presence of banners before and axes behind—such things exist. How much more so for one harboring intentions of certainty, wishing to transform a young and willful ruler? How can one ensure no regret? Thus, the Master strongly dissuaded him, making the ruler of Wei aware that the worthy do not advance lightly, thereby strengthening his resolve to honor the Dao. Why would one lightly risk their nature to feed arrogance and provoke violent conduct?

Yanzi then spoke of being "upright within and yielding without," which might allow self-preservation. The Master said this would only avoid disaster—how could it reach transformation? One who transforms does not rely on words to gain trust, making others’ intentions dissolve. How could it lie in multiplying government laws to provoke opposition?

At this point, Yanzi had no further questions to ask about the method, for his thoughts were already empty, and his heavenly truth was in a state of empty receptivity. The Master seized this moment of awakening and instructed him to equalize, making his empty heart receptive to teaching: "Do not listen with the ears but with the heart; do not listen with the heart but with qi." Suddenly, he realized that there had never been a Yan Hui. With heart emptied and form forgotten, transforming things was no longer difficult.

When Zigao was about to be sent to Qi, he was instructed on the affairs of conduct, to forget the self, to observe the winds and waves, and to be wary of real loss. When Yanhe was about to go to Wei, he was instructed to approach without entering and to harmonize without departing, to understand the tiger’s anger and communicate the horse’s disposition—all to clarify the many ends of worldly perils and the difficulties beyond things. For those of high discernment, penetrating the subtleties and guarding advance and retreat with righteousness—this is acceptable.

As for the crooked catalpa and the sacred tree, to take "no preservation" as preservation; as for Shang Qiu’s extraordinary talent, to see without being divine yet be divine—this further explains how talent is a burden, yet the world does not awaken. Often, relying on talent to seek use without measuring one’s proper measure, fame arises and jealousy harms; profit accumulates and disaster arrives. Even if one wishes to preserve oneself in clumsy self-protection, it cannot be achieved.

Thus, the great meaning of this chapter lies in externally responding to the world while internally preserving the true Dao, not departing from it, and letting things transform themselves. The sages and worthies of old, when unavoidably involved in worldly affairs, all secretly followed this Dao. Hence, the exchanges between Confucius and Yanzi are recorded to elucidate this. At the end, the song of Jieyu is cited to dispel the traces of sages and worthies engaging in worldly action and to curb the insatiable pursuit of things by the multitude. The conclusion, with the disasters of the mountain tree, the fat of fire, the cassia, and the lacquer, serves as a stern warning to the world. Only by knowing the difficulty of navigating the world can one live in the world without difficulty.

The *Taishang* says: "Even the sage finds it difficult, hence in the end there is no difficulty."

This chapter begins with the exchanges between Confucius and Yanzi, followed by the analogies of Zigao and Yanhe. Its discussion of preserving the body, conducting righteousness, responding to things, and discerning subtleties thoroughly covers the way to live in the human world. It then continues with the catalpa, the sacred tree, Shang Qiu, and the hunchback, showing that in the world’s calamities and chaos, one ultimately cannot act. Even if one does well, it is better not to do at all—this is the highest. Thus, the chapter concludes with the song of Jieyu.

**From *Brush Jottings*:**
Master Shi Zhang said: *"The 'Nurturing Life' chapter is the teaching of transcending the world; the 'Living in the Human World' chapter is the teaching of abiding in the world."* I say: only after transcending the world can one abide in it—this is what Laozi meant by *"grasping the ancient Dao to steer the present being."*

**Chapter Five: The Sign of Full Virtue**

*(Guo’s Commentary: When virtue is full within, it responds to things without; inner and outer merge in profound unity, as if commanded by fate, while the bodily form is forgotten.
Supplemental Note: "Sign" means that when virtue is full within, it naturally manifests without—not something the form can augment or diminish, nor something knowledge can conceal or reveal. The examples described in this chapter suffice to make this clear.)*

In Lu there was a man named Wang Tai who had lost a foot, yet those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Chang Ji asked Confucius, saying: *"Wang Tai is a man who has lost a foot, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. He does not teach when standing, nor discuss when seated; yet those who go to him empty return full. Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is he?"*

Confucius said: *"This master is a sage. I am merely one who follows behind and have not yet caught up. I intend to take him as my teacher—how much more should those who are not my equal! Why only Lu? I would lead the whole world to follow him."*

Chang Ji said: *"Though he is a man who has lost a foot, he surpasses even the worthy. If this is so, how does he employ his mind?"*

Confucius said: *"Life and death are great matters, yet they cannot alter him. Though heaven and earth collapse, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without reliance, does not shift with things, commands the transformations of things, and guards their root."*

Chang Ji said: *"What does this mean?"*

Confucius said: *"Viewed from their differences, liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from their sameness, the myriad things are all one. If one is like this, why would he trouble his mind with what the ears and eyes deem fitting? He roams in the harmony of virtue with things, seeing their unity and not perceiving their loss—regarding the loss of his foot as if it were discarded earth."*

Chang Ji said: *"He cultivates himself, using his knowledge to attain his heart, and using his heart to attain its constancy. Why should things be able to sway him?"*

Confucius said: *"People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water—only stillness can still the many. The earth receives its mandate, yet only the pine and cypress remain verdant through winter and summer. Heaven receives its mandate, yet only Shun was singularly upright. How fortunate is one who can rectify life and thereby rectify the many! The proof of preserving the beginning lies in the substance of fearlessness. A single brave warrior may charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and can bind themselves are like this—how much more one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, treats the six limbs as a temporary abode, the ears and eyes as mere reflections, and whose knowledge knows what is known while the heart never dies! He will choose a day to ascend to the heavens, and people will follow him. How would he deign to make things his concern?"*

The annotation states: *"Nine armies: Cui and Li explain that the Son of Heaven commands six armies, the feudal lords three, together making nine. Ascending to the transcendent realm: Lü’s pronunciation is ‘xiá,’ meaning one who attains this Dao moves without hindrance, ascending to the realm of the mysterious and boundless. In the ‘King Mu’ chapter of the *Liezi*, the character ‘登假’ is also read as ‘xiá,’ confirming this."*

Guo’s commentary:
To depart in emptiness and return in fullness—each attains what is sufficient in itself. Though formless, the heart reaches completion; how strange that when the body is maimed, the heart becomes even more abundant! When the heart is whole, one leaves the body behind, forgets the five viscera, and suddenly wanders alone—none in the world can separate from it. Why would one need the state of Lu to lead the world in following? When spirit is complete and the heart fully realized, the body harmonizes with things, and the world cannot fathom this—how could it be merely one state?

The transformations of life and death are the greatest of changes. Yet one who moves with change is unaltered by life or death; though heaven and earth collapse, they but follow its course. To discern the unborrowed is to understand the constancy of nature and destiny. To not shift with things is to let things shift of themselves. To command the transformations of things is to take transformation as destiny without resistance. To guard one’s root is to never depart from the ultimate rightness.

Though liver and gallbladder may be as distant as Chu and Yue, their natures of tranquility and bitterness differ, and so their perceptions of beauty and ugliness diverge. Yet when the myriad things are seen as one, though what they find beautiful differs, each finds beauty in what it finds beautiful—thus all things share a single beauty. Each affirms what it affirms, and so the world shares a single affirmation.

If one distinguishes based on differences, then the world is nothing but differences, and the vast spectacle of governing heaven and earth and storing the myriad things arises from knowing that differences need not be distinguished. If one unites based on sameness, then the world is nothing but sameness, yet knowing that sameness need not be clung to, one then unites based on nothingness—thus right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, all dissolve into nothingness.

That I am right and others wrong, that I am beautiful and others ugly—from those with understanding down to the insects, none are free of this. Yet if one is clear about oneself but unclear about others, how is this different from the sage who merges with the world? Such a one illuminates the world through the world, and the world has no "I" to oppose. Thus, to see that the world has no opposition is to see that there is no "other" to be right. To see that the world has no rightness is to see that there is no "this" to be right. With right and wrong, this and other blended into one, one can ride change, follow transformation, encounter things without fear.

Not knowing the proper bounds of the ears and eyes, the heart roams freely.

The harmony of virtue arises from what is deemed unsuitable. Without beauty or ugliness, nothing is unsuitable—thus one forgets suitability. To forget suitability entirely is to be unburdened by anything; to be unburdened by all yet find nothing unattainable has never been heard of. Without unattainability, disharmony is also unheard of. Therefore, the heart roams freely between heaven and earth, unbound and unfettered, expansive and unobstructed.

Things are seen in their unity, not in what they lose. To embody the subtlety of the utmost principle is to find no thing dissimilar. With no thing dissimilar, life and death, change and transformation—nowhere do they cease to be the self. Thus, life is the self in its time, death is the self in its compliance; gathering is the self in its convergence, dispersal is the self in its divergence. Though gathering and dispersal differ, the self remains the self—hence, life is the self. There has never been gain, nor has death ever ceased to be the self; there has never been loss. The transformations of life and death are but one. Having observed this oneness, one is unbound and carefree, merging self and other, treating life and death as waking and dreaming, the body as a temporary abode. To depart from life is like shedding sandals; to sever a limb is like discarding dirt. I have never seen such things ensnare the heart.

Those who act for themselves with their knowledge suspect that Wang Tai could not forget knowledge and thus preserve himself. Those who attain the heart through their heart suspect they cannot abandon the heart and thus attain themselves. Those who attain their constant heart—what can things do to rank them highest? For to attain the constant heart is to proceed with equanimity. The suspicion that one cannot proceed with equanimity and thus exceeds the constant in accommodating things is what causes things to converge upon them.

The still water that serves as a mirror does not seek to mirror by stillness. Thus, the crowds gathered by Wang Tai came of their own accord—how could he have drawn them to follow him? Only stillness can still the many; if one moves to still them, one cannot remain among the stillness of all things. Only Shun stood alone. To speak directly: those who receive the pure qi of nature are exceedingly rare. Lower their heads, and they are but pines and cypresses; raise them, and they are but sages. Thus, all that is not upright comes seeking uprightness. If all things possessed complete integrity, pines and cypresses would hold no esteem; if all people were upright, great sages would hold no distinction—and none would turn to them. Those fortunate enough to be upright themselves and thus upright others are fortunate in their own uprightness, not in using uprightness to make others upright. Those who seek fame and bind themselves to it are not those who can abandon fame and be unburdened by all. To govern heaven and earth and store the myriad things is to embody all without obstruction. To lodge temporarily in the six senses is what is meant by a temporary abode.

The ears and eyes are but images—people use them, yet they are also used by them, not because they require ears and eyes. When knowledge moves with change and transformation, there is nowhere it does not govern—this is the oneness of knowledge. When the heart follows life and death, there is no time it is not alive—this heart has never died. Those who select auspicious days to ascend to heaven do so to avoid losing governance. Such a person makes no selection; they follow the movement of heaven and act in due time. Thus, those who borrow from them esteem them most. Their tranquility preserves their wholeness.

Therefore, it is said: *How would they deign to make things their concern?*

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Those who study the Dao study what they cannot study; they practice what they cannot practice. Thus, the parable of Wang Tai. Those who followed Confucius knew how to follow what they could practice but not what they could not—thus, even if all of Lu had followed him, it would have been no different from Wang Tai, merely a division. Following what they could practice, they stood to teach and sat to discuss; their teaching could not be without words, their accomplishments could not be without form. Following what they could not practice, they stood without teaching and sat without discussion, going forth empty and returning full. Confucius and Wang Tai were but outer and inner to each other. If one does not take what they could do as the task of a ruler or teacher, the usefulness of the useless is far from the common.

Who would change with life and death? Who would discard with collapse and ruin? To discern clearly that what is attained is real and does not shift with things is to remain unchanged by life and death, collapse and ruin—only to command transformation and things, not to be transformed, to guard one’s root and origin without departing. People only fail to see things as the same because their ears and eyes do not turn inward. Those who see things as the same do not know what ears and eyes should do—thus, they see things in their unity and do not see what they lose.

Changji said of Taihuai: his inner sagely Dao was for himself alone. With his knowledge, he attained his heart; with his heart, he attained his constant heart. What could things do to rank him highest and make him a ruler or teacher? Only stillness can still the many—this is why people followed him to seek a mirror. No tree does not receive its mandate from the earth, yet only pines and cypresses remain whole. No person does not receive their mandate from heaven, yet only Shun stood upright. If uprightness were unique to Shun, would he not consider it fortunate to be upright himself and thus make others upright? Now, those scholars who name themselves brave can yet charge into nine armies—how much more so one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, and does not change with life and death? They are not like those who seek fame and bind themselves to it. They select auspicious days to ascend to heaven, their comings and goings leisurely—how could such a person not be followed and esteemed?

**Xu Xi:**
To be beyond externals is to stand alone even if heaven and earth collapse, without reliance or dependence. To sit and watch the transformations of the myriad things, alone with that which preceded heaven and earth—this is what is called the origin, the begetter of heaven and earth.

**Yi Du:**
To govern the formed with the formless is to govern heaven; to store the myriad things with nothing is to store them. To command the six senses is to lodge without attachment; to embody the ears and eyes is to preserve without use. To know without being divided by things, to keep the heart without it perishing with the body, to control fate from within rather than without—this is how one selects auspicious days to ascend to heaven.

**Tong Yi:**
"For oneself" means their learning was not for others, yet others revered them—why? Because with their knowledge, they attained their heart, speaking of introspection to see their celestial ruler. With their heart, they attained their constant heart, as if a wanderer returning home, knowing this was their inherent estate. This only speaks of acting for oneself—what does it have to do with others? Yet others revered them thus, revealing Changji’s own attainment.

**Fu Mo:**
To be upright is to align with one’s nature and mandate; to align with one’s nature is to guard the origin; to guard the origin is to preserve the beginning.

The verification of preserving the beginning is like one cultivating courage—taking fearlessness as the essence and thus remaining unmoved in heart. Therefore, a single warrior can dominate nine armies. How much more so for one who guards the origin and aligns with their nature, preserving the beginning before any beginning arose? What sign could there be that they cannot command life and death, directing the transformations of things?

They govern heaven and earth, administer the myriad things, and lodge within the six bodily forms as mere images of ears and eyes. They say: "I and heaven, earth, and the myriad things share a single root and origin. Scattered, they become the ten thousand; gathered, they become the One. This is merely lodged within the six bodily forms, with ears and eyes as its images." People only cling to images and lose their heart, recklessly giving rise to knowledge. Thus, the heart is born from things and dies with things. Now, if one unifies their knowledge with what is known, the heart has never truly died—so why should life and death be feared?

Formerly, Liu Bing studied the Dao. A divine person told him: "Your heart’s power is keen and fierce—you will surely break through life and death." Those who study know that the matter of life and death is great. If one applies keen focus and vibrant energy, rousing themselves to break through like a fearless warrior with true courage, they can dominate life and death, moving freely without obstruction. This is the learning of liberation from life and death. Zhuangzi casually revealed this, yet at that time, the sutras of Western India had not yet arrived, and the Buddha’s teachings were already in China. Who can say the Buddha’s teaching is merely a foreign law?

**Bi Sheng:**
*"Receiving mandate from earth—only the pine and cypress remain upright, verdant through winter and summer. Receiving mandate from heaven—only Yao and Shun stand at the head of the myriad things."* The original text is uneven, seemingly missing words. Zhang Junfang’s collated edition reads: *"Receiving mandate from earth—only the pine and cypress remain upright."* It adds *"verdant through winter and summer"* and *"receiving mandate from heaven—only Yao and Shun stand at the head of the myriad things,"* supplying seven missing characters. This follows Guo’s commentary, which notes *"below, only the pine and cypress; above, only the sage."* Now, punctuating *"only the pine and cypress remain upright"* with *"only Yao and Shun stand"* makes the text coherent and the meaning complete.

Shentu Jia was a man without feet, yet he studied with Zichan of Zheng under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay." The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now, I am about to leave—can you stay? Are you not yielding? You see the one in power and do not avoid him—do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?"

Shentu Jia replied: "Within the Master’s gate, is there truly one in power? If you delight in your own power and only then let others see you, I have heard: *When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; when dust settles, it is not bright.* Long association with the worthy leaves no faults. Now, what you take as great is the Master—yet you still speak like this. Is this not a fault?"

Zichan said: "You are already like this..."

Shentu Jia continued: "You still vie with Yao in claiming goodness—is your virtue not sufficient for self-reflection? Those who justify their faults and deem themselves undeserving of ruin are many; those who do not justify their faults and yet remain undeserving of survival are few. To know there is nothing to be done and yet rest content in it as fate—only those of virtue can do this. To wander within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the mark. Yet whether one hits it or not is a matter of fate. Many are those with whole feet who mock my incomplete foot. I was enraged at first, but when I came to the Master’s place, my anger melted away and I returned to myself. Did the Master not cleanse me with goodness? I have followed you for nineteen years, yet you never once saw me as a man without a foot. Now, you walk with me within the realm of form, yet you seek me outside of form—is this not a fault?"

Zichan, startled, changed his expression and said, "You need not say more."

*(Guo’s commentary: "If I leave, you stay"—he was ashamed to walk alongside a man without a foot. The next day, he pressed the matter, wishing to ensure they would not walk together. "You consider yourself equal to the one in power"—he constantly took pride in his position, so to say "you consider yourself equal" was enough to show his lack of deference. "Within the Master’s gate, is there truly one in power?"—this was a place for discussing virtue, not calculating rank. "If you delight in your own power and only then let others see you"—he mocked his arrogance in office, wishing to put himself before others. "Long association with the worthy leaves no faults"—though he served a wise teacher, his mean and grudging heart had not yet departed, which was the true fault. "You are already like this"—his form was impaired. To not reflect on oneself and yet slight those in power, comparing oneself to those of virtue—his virtue was not enough to make up for the fault of his impaired form. "Those who justify their faults and deem themselves undeserving of ruin are many"—he often confessed his faults, claiming he did not deserve to perish. To silently acknowledge one’s faults and deem oneself deserving of death was rare. Yi was a skilled archer of old; the range of his bow and arrow was called the "drawn bow." Where profit and harm contend, the world is all Yi. Those who do not forget themselves, who let knowledge go and flow with things, all wander within Yi’s drawn bow. Though Zhang Yi went forth and Shan Bao stayed in, neither escaped the mark—whether one hits it or not depends solely on fate. Yet these petty ones each meet their own circumstances and do not know that fate is thus. Those who escape the harm of bow and arrow take themselves as skillful, delighting in their own success. When they fail to escape, they resent their mistakes, their spirits wounded and their dignity lost—these have not yet grasped the nature of fate. As for my life, it is not something I myself have given.)*

Within the span of a single life, within a hundred years, all that arises—sitting and rising, moving and resting, stillness and action, inclinations and aversions, temperament and intellect, abilities and possessions, all that is present and all that is absent, all that is done and all that is encountered—is not the self. The principle is simply thus. Yet to arbitrarily generate joy and sorrow within it is to go against nature and lose oneself.

Those who mock my incomplete limbs with their own completeness do not understand fate and thus mock. Those who bristle with anger upon seeing this mockery are likewise ignorant of fate and thus angered. Those who despondently turn back do so upon witnessing the perfected person’s understanding of fate and relinquishment of form, thereby relinquishing their former anger and returning to constancy.

Do I not know that you, Master, have cleansed me with goodness? Or do I not know that you have washed me with the virtuous Way? Am I capable of self-reflection? This is to forget the form and cast off burdens. For nineteen years, I have never known my own lameness—so thoroughly have I forgotten the form. The form lies without; virtue resides within. Now you and I wander in virtue, not in the exchange of forms, nor in seeking external favors. Is this not excessive? You need not speak further; once awakened, one wearies of excessive words.

**Limited View:**
Shentu accepted fate and forgot his lameness; his inner virtue was full, and thus he felt no sorrow outwardly. Zichan prized his rank and despised the lame, his heart ensnared by externals and blind to what lies within. Those who ought not to die are many; those who ought not to live are few. This is Shentu’s discourse on the preservation or loss of limbs: few are those who, upon becoming lame, recognize their own faults and accept them. Yet fortune and misfortune alike return to fate. Thus, Shentu’s lameness arose not from fault. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow, none escape the mark; if one is not struck, it is mere luck. Living in the world, none escape suffering; if one avoids misfortune, it is also luck. Yet when others mock my misfortune because of their luck, I still harbor anger, for I have not forgotten myself. When I despondently turn back, I too have forgotten. Do I not know that you, Master, have cleansed me with goodness? Or is it my own awakening? Then both self and other are forgotten, subject and object are transformed—how can joy or anger arise? How can the form be sought?

In Lu there was a lame man named Shushan Wuzhi, who hobbled to see Confucius. Confucius said, “You were not careful before and thus incurred such suffering. Though you come now, what can be done?”

Wuzhi replied, “I was ignorant of my duties and recklessly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now I come because I still possess what is more honorable than feet, and thus I strive to preserve it. The heavens cover all without exception; the earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like heaven and earth—how could I have known you would be like this?”

Confucius said, “I am indeed narrow-minded. Why do you not come in? Please share what you have heard.” Wuzhi departed. Confucius said to his disciples, “Exert yourselves! Wuzhi is lame, yet still strives to study and make amends for his past misdeeds. How much more should those with complete virtue do so?”

Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, “Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he persistently seek you as a student? He seeks strange and marvelous fame, unaware that the perfected person regards such things as his own shackles.”

Lao Dan said, “Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as a single strand, thereby loosening his shackles? Would that not suffice?”

Wuzhi said, “How can one escape the punishment of heaven?”

**Guo’s Commentary:**
The heel and cheek. As for human life, the principle arises of itself.

“To simply refrain from action and allow things to arise of themselves—this is to value one’s person and know what truly matters. If, however, one forgets that things arise of themselves and instead meticulously guards and prides oneself on them, this is to use one’s person lightly and fail to know what truly matters. Thus the five viscera attack one another within, and hands and feet suffer injury without. Yet even one who reveres the foot still exists—this shows that the loss of a single foot is not enough to diminish one’s virtue. Clearly, the bodily frame is but a temporary abode. Abandoning self-importance and caution, allowing things to arise of themselves—this is the way to preserve wholeness.

Heaven does not act for the sake of covering, yet it constantly covers; Earth does not act for the sake of bearing, yet it constantly bears. If heaven and earth were to act for the sake of covering and bearing, they would at times rest. If a boat were to act for the sake of sinking yet float for people, it would at times founder. Thus, when things act for a purpose, they cannot fully sustain their existence. How can one who still clings to such ways demand that another be as meticulous as heaven and earth?

Wuzhi departed, having heard what he heard, and preserved his non-action. Why then did he persistently seek Lao Dan as a student? He was puzzled that Confucius was once again studying under Lao Dan.

One without self-interest learns, and others learn as well. The ancients studied for themselves; today, people study for others. Their divergence leads to this: they end up doing what others do. To teach others so that they attain self-realization is to guide them toward what is constant. To abandon oneself, imitate others, and chase external things is to seek an extraordinary reputation. Yet extraordinary reputations arise from what is constant.

Thus, the learner does not pursue illusions and marvels—illusions and marvels necessarily arise from learning. The practitioner of ritual does not seek florid shallowness—yet florid shallowness necessarily arises from ritual. This is an inevitable principle, something the perfected person cannot prevent. Why then regard it as one’s own shackles?

Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as a single strand, thereby loosening his shackles? To use direct principles to restrain him, hoping he will leave no traces—how can the punishment of heaven be escaped?

Confucius was not without restraint, yet when the principle of spontaneity moves, the shadow follows; when words are spoken, echoes respond. To accord with things is to establish a reputation and traces, yet one who accords with things does not do so for the sake of reputation. If not for the sake of reputation, one attains perfection—yet in the end, he cannot escape.”

Who then can untangle reputation? Thus, reputation is but shadow and echo—shadow and echo are the shackles of form and sound. When this principle is understood, reputation and traces may be abandoned, and one’s nature and life preserved.

**Supplementary Ink:**
Shushan Wuzhi knew there were those who prized their feet, so he sought to preserve them. When those who prized their feet were preserved, they saw the discarding of their feet as no different from discarding dirt. The Master, however, rejected other pursuits and studied to amend past misdeeds, unaware that such people do not arise from thoughts of good or evil—something not easily grasped by those bound by teaching.

Thus, Wuzhi and Lao Dan discussed in private: “Is the Master not yet a perfected person? Why does he so earnestly and reverently study under you?” He is ever hastening to seek a good name in the world, yet does not know that the perfected person regards this very thing as his own shackles. For the perfected person has no self, and the sage has no name. Like hands and feet, they are originally without shackles—those who bear shackles do so only because they create distinctions and bind themselves.

To loosen these shackles, one must reverse such distinctions and return to unity: regard life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as a single strand. Only then is it possible. To regard life and death as a single thread is to recognize that there was never a beginning to life—who then names death? To regard the permissible and impermissible as a single strand is to see that originally there was no right—what then is wrong? In this way, good and evil are but illusory dharmas, all distinctions mere deceptive names. There is no more essential way to free people from entanglement and remove their bonds. Yet those under heaven’s punishment remain suspended, unable to be freed.

*Heaven’s punishment* here refers to the inevitability of celestial retribution, an absolute and inescapable fate.

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, saying: "In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who dwell with him grow attached and cannot bear to leave. Women who see him beg their parents, saying, 'Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be this gentleman’s concubine'—there are already more than ten such cases, and the number does not cease. He has never been heard to initiate speech; he only responds in harmony. He holds no lordly position to aid others, nor does he possess wealth to fill their bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startles all under heaven. He harmonizes but does not lead; his knowledge does not extend beyond the four borders. Yet male and female alike gather to him—there must be something extraordinary about him. He is, after all, a man. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled all under heaven. Yet after dwelling with me for less than a month, I began to take notice of him. Before a full year had passed, I trusted him completely. When the state had no chief minister, I offered him the governance. He responded with reluctance, as if seeking to decline, and I felt ashamed. In the end, I entrusted him with the state. Before long, he left me and departed. I grieved for him."

Should it be as though he had perished—should he leave this state joyless—what manner of man is he?

Confucius replied: "I, Qiu, once served as envoy to Chu. There I happened to see some young pigs nursing from their dead mother. After a brief moment, they all abandoned her and fled, no longer seeing her as their own. For what they loved in their mother was not her form, but that which animated her form. When warriors fall in battle, their burial does not include the ornaments of the living; those who have lost their feet receive no shoes—none are mourned for what they have lost at the root. The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears; those who take wives remain outside the inner chambers, no longer employed—all preserve their bodies intact. How much more, then, one whose virtue is whole?

Now, Ai Taituo has never spoken yet is trusted, has done no deed yet is beloved, so much so that others offer him a state, fearing only that he will not accept. He must be one whose talents are complete and whose virtue remains unmanifest."

Duke Ai said: "What do you mean by *talents complete*?"

Confucius replied: "Life and death, existence and annihilation, failure and success, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the movements of fate. They follow one another day and night, yet one’s knowledge cannot encompass them in advance."

At its inception, it cannot disturb the harmony of the bones nor penetrate the numinous abode. It allows harmony and ease to flow without losing joy, day and night unbroken, ever spring-like in its resonance with things. This is what it means to keep one’s talents whole—what arises in the heart in perfect accord with the seasons.

What is meant by *virtue remaining unmanifest*? Consider still water at its fullest: it may serve as a model. Within, it preserves itself; without, it does not sway. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. When virtue remains unmanifest, things cannot depart from it.

Another day, Duke Ai told Minzi: "At first, I believed that by facing south as lord of the realm, holding the people’s guiding thread, and grieving over their deaths, I had attained the utmost understanding. Now, having heard the words of the perfected one, I fear I lack its reality. I have taken my person lightly and forgotten my state. Between Confucius and me, there is no ruler and minister—only a bond of virtue as friends."

One who seeks no accumulation of emoluments nor gazes upon others’ bellies makes plain that he does not go for the sake of food. One who repels the world with ugliness makes plain that he does not go for the sake of outward beauty. One who harmonizes without leading does not summon others to come—it is they who draw near of themselves. One whose knowledge does not extend beyond the four bounds does not exhaust thought on what lies beyond his portion.

The one whose *power remains whole* harms nothing in the world: thus men and beasts do not scatter their herds, birds do not disorder their flights, and he becomes the spirit of the ten thousand things. One who responds only after deep silence is not startled by favor or disgrace, for his spirit remains undisturbed. One who drifts as though declining does so because others decline first—he merely declines in turn.

Fangzi fed at the breast of his dead mother: he was nourished by milk. The living are guided by *power and talent*; when these depart in death, the living flee as though they have lost their guiding thread. Thus one whose *inner power* is profound resembles an infant: nothing in the world harms him, for he has attained the thread and made it manifest. If the heart’s disposition is thus whole, then even if the form differs, things will not harm it. But if the heart’s disposition is lost, then even if the form is that of mother and child, it is not enough to secure their bond.

What gives form is *talent and power*. A funeral fan is the resource of martial prowess; if one dies in battle, what use are the wings of war? Loved shoes are for the sake of the feet; why would a man without feet cherish shoes? Without their root—feet—fan and shoes are nothing. The root of martial prowess is the foot. Not cutting, not piercing, preserves the form whole; one cannot employ it again for fear of injuring the form.

Selecting consorts and concubines, or cherishing a new bride, is done for the sake of physical beauty. Thus the wholeness of form prevents even the most exalted sentiments from swaying the chastity of a steadfast woman. When *power* is whole, things naturally love it.

Life and death, existence and extinction, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these principles are inherent and cannot be escaped. Thus human life is not a mistake.

All that life possesses is not possessed in vain. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, what I encounter is precisely what lies before me—even the gods of heaven and earth, the state, sages, and those of utmost strength and wisdom cannot transcend it. Thus, what one does not encounter cannot be encountered, and what one encounters cannot but be encountered; what one does not do cannot be done, and what one does must be done. Entrusting it to its proper place, it naturally fits. Fate proceeds and affairs transform without ceasing day or night, pressing forward without pause, lingering without halt. Therefore, one whose *power* is whole follows whatever is encountered and entrusts it to its course.

The beginning is not what knowledge can plan, nor the end what emotion can detain. How could one who understands that fate must proceed and affairs must transform scheme for the end or cling to the new? Even with utmost wisdom, one cannot plan for it. What has passed is gone—what can I do? If one knows that nature and fate are inherently as they should be, then though death and life, poverty and prosperity shift in a thousand transformations, one remains serene and unperturbed, harmony and principle residing within. Thus it is said: what is insufficient does not disturb the harmony of the numinous abode, for the spirit dwells in the abode of essence. What is utterly sufficient does not startle the spirit with sorrow or misfortune. Thus it is said: nothing may enter the numinous abode. When harmony and ease fill the nature, the numinous abode remains undisturbed; though one traverses the greatest changes, one does not lose one’s joy. Thus it is said: harmony and ease flow freely without losing joy, day and night without gap—all is entrusted to its constant course. To be spring for all things is what the multitude of life depends upon. Meeting and generating the seasons in the heart is to follow the four seasons and transform together with them.

The peace of the world is nowhere more perfect than in still water, for it is utterly without emotion and thus utterly level—hence the world takes it as the standard. Thus it is said: levelness is the perfection of still water, and it may serve as a model. Preserving it within while remaining undisturbed without is to preserve one’s clarity within and be without emotion without, becoming a profound mirror that illuminates all things without partiality. Thus one preserves its levelness and enacts its model. Affairs are accomplished and things are harmonized—this is called *virtue*. No affair is unaccomplished, no thing unharmonized—this is the formless *virtue*. Therefore, the world delights in esteeming it and never tires of it.

Following the root: The *Record of Rites* states that for three years of mourning and for one who has newly married, there is no service. Thus it is said: one who takes a wife remains outside and may not again be employed. "Day and night without gap" means that though death and life, poverty and wealth alternate day and night before us, I employ them without fissure or crevice to enter. Viewing them as one, they blend indistinguishably, becoming spring for all things. Just as the year has four seasons yet one does not see its summer, autumn, or winter but only sees it as spring—this is seeing the days and meeting things, generating the seasons in my heart. Thus, from the word "spring," the word "season" arises below, signifying that the seasons do not arise from the *qi* of yin and yang but from my heart.

Limited view: The meaning of "male and female" is sometimes taken from the *Liezi* as referring to birds and beasts, where male and female mate in front and rear to form herds. Yet examining the classics’ intent, when a man dwells with a woman, he thinks of her and cannot leave, and a woman wishes to be his concubine—thus male and female unite. The preceding words say that many men and women return to this. Those who die in battle do not use the *sha*; the *Fan Wu Yin* follows the *sha* in an absolute phrase. The *sha* is an implement for adorning martial prowess, shaped like a square fan, made of wood, covered in white cloth, painted with cloud patterns, and placed on either side of a chariot for self-defense.

Examining the *Liji*’s "Tan Gong" chapter and the "Mingtang Wei," it is recorded that the Zhou placed *sha* in their rituals. Zheng’s commentary states: the Son of Heaven used eight *sha*, each adorned with jade and hanging feathers; feudal lords used six *sha*, each adorned with a *gui* tablet; great officers used four *sha*; and scholars used two *sha*, each adorned with *rui* tassels. From this, it is clear that *sha* were universally employed in ancient funeral rites, not merely as martial adornments. I privately trace the original intent of the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi]: the sages established rites to enable people to nurture life and send off the dead without regret. The Zhou used coffins and shrouds, decorated with willow and *sha*, with distinctions of rank and degree each fitting its proper measure—thus was the reverence for life’s end.

Those who die in bitter battle do not meet a proper end, and so in their burial, *sha* are not used. Their forms cannot be preserved whole—how then could one expect the full array of ritual objects? This is akin to one who has lost a foot having no use for shoes. This passage, beginning with the analogy of the child feeding from its dead mother, extends the metaphor to this point, layering comparisons to conclude: those whose virtue is full within have no need of external embellishment, while those whose inner power is depleted gain no benefit from outward adornment.

*Bisheng* states: "To *wang* is like the fullness of the moon—round, complete, and replete. Harmonious yet not initiating, one does not see their ability to lead affairs. Knowledge does not extend beyond the four realms, and one does not perceive their far-reaching strategy."

One possesses neither rank nor position, talent nor appearance—yet male and female alike turn to them in devotion. This is not that they compel things to preserve themselves, but that things preserve themselves through them. What manner of person is this? One wonders: where lies the power to move others? The analogy of the child at the breast suggests that form is not inherently lovable—it is what gives form that is lovable. A mother’s love takes what gives her child form as its foundation; in battle, martial prowess is the foundation; in conduct, the feet are the foundation. That Yutai Tuo was retained when present and missed when absent was because he possessed such a foundation.

Talent here refers to the "lesser talents" of Mencius—those whose talent is incomplete are often pleased with their own self-promotion. When talent is complete, virtue is full within. What need is there for form? Life and death, existence and annihilation, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, praise and blame, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—though their changes appear thus, one cannot grasp what brings them about. Thus, they are called *ming* (fate). If one knows the origin from which they arise, how could one remain indifferent? Yet though these changes alternate day and night without cease, their origin is such that even the wise cannot fathom it—this is what is meant by "never having had a beginning."

To know that there has never been a beginning—how then could one disturb the great harmony of one’s *lingfu* (spiritual abode)? Ye Yu, like Laozi, "seals the opening" of the senses, harmonizing and flowing without losing touch with the senses or things. This is the "formless" state, where one moves with the ten thousand changes yet never loses the proper moment. When water is still and level, all things align with it. Levelness allows it to preserve itself within; stillness prevents it from being disturbed without. The levelness of water is like the harmony of virtue.

This harmony is cultivated until it is complete—hence it is said, "the cultivation of completed harmony." Things cannot depart from it. This also explains the meaning of "formless": it is unity without division, the absence of change in life and death.

Yinqi, Zhili, Wuchun, and Shui—King Ling of Wei delighted in them, seeing in their deformities the wholeness of others. Their necks were like *dou* vessels, their shoulders like urns, their bellies like jars, their goiters vast. Duke Huan of Qi was ashamed before them, seeing in their deformities the wholeness of others. Thus, virtue may be long where form is forgotten. People forget what should be forgotten yet forget what should not be forgotten—this is called "true forgetting." Therefore, the sage wanders freely, while knowledge becomes a snare, schemes become glue, virtue becomes a bond, and skill becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—what need is there for knowledge? He does not carve—what need is there for glue? He does not lose—what need is there for virtue? He does not trade—what need is there for commerce? These four are bestowed by Heaven. What is bestowed by Heaven is the Heavenly succession.

Having received sustenance from Heaven, what need is there for man? One may possess the form of a human but lack the passions of one. Having the form of a human, one mingles with others; lacking human passions, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How trivial is that by which one is bound to humanity!

Alas! How vast! Alone, he completes his Heavenly endowment.

Huizi said to Zhuangzi: "Do humans truly lack passions?"
Zhuangzi replied: "Indeed."
Huizi asked: "If humans lack passions, how can they be called human?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao bestows upon them their appearance, Heaven bestows upon them their form—how can they not be called human?"
Huizi said: "If they are called human, how can they lack passions?"
Zhuangzi replied: "This is not what I mean by passions. What I call 'lacking passions' means that one does not inwardly harm the body with likes and dislikes, but always follows nature without artificially enhancing life."

Huizi asked: "If one does not enhance life, how can one possess a body?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao bestows upon them their appearance, Heaven bestows upon them their form—do not inwardly harm the body with likes and dislikes. Now, you are estranged from this: your spirit is wearied, your essence leans and sways, you hum while resting against a withered catalpa, and sleep with closed eyes. Heaven chose your form, yet you clamor about 'hard and white'—like the gatekeeper with crippled limbs, the one with a swollen goiter, or the hunchbacked jar-carrier."

Guo's commentary:
*"The gatekeeper with crippled limbs and the one without lips—these speak of partial passions leading one way: the ugly become more admirable, while the admirable become more ugly. 'Virtue has its strengths while form has its forgettings'—when virtue excels in harmonizing with things, one forgets ugliness; when it excels in resisting things, one forgets beauty. In life, they are cherished; in death, they are discarded—thus virtue is what the world does not forget, while form is what principle does not retain. Therefore, those who forget form do not truly forget; only those who do not forget form but forget virtue achieve true forgetting. The sage wanders in the realm of self-contentment, letting go without fail—his talents and virtue are complete. Knowledge becomes a snare, schemes become glue, virtue becomes a bond, and skill becomes commerce—these four arise naturally from one another, their principles already inherent. Thus, the sage has no use for his own contrivances. What is bestowed by Heaven is the Heavenly succession—it is naturally endowed. Having received this natural endowment, its principles are already sufficient. Though one may ponder deeply to avoid calamity or clearly admonish to evade misfortune, things do not occur at random; they are the safeguards of Heaven and Earth, the tendencies of the utmost principle. One must think for oneself—it is not I who thinks; one must not think for oneself—it is not I who does not think. Some think and escape; some think and do not escape; some do not think and escape; some do not think and do not escape—none of these are of my doing. What is there to do? Simply entrust it and let it come of itself."*

One who possesses the human form appears in semblance to others, yet lacking human sentiment, they are like the branch of a withered tree. To gather among people or disperse from them follows the natural Dao. One who does not take right and wrong to heart is without sentiment, and thus remains vast and unburdened, accepting all things without resistance—something those with sentiment cannot achieve. Thus, though their appearance is human, they alone fulfill their Heavenly nature. The Dao bestows their countenance, and Heaven grants their form—this speaks to human birth, which does not arise from sentiment. What life knows is not what sentiment knows. Therefore, those with sentiment strive for detachment yet cannot attain it; yet through detachment, one becomes perceptive and wise. Those with sentiment strive for sagehood yet cannot achieve it; yet through detachment, one becomes a sage. Is it only that sagehood is distant and detachment difficult to emulate? Even the most foolish, the deaf and blind, the crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs—if they cling to sentiment in their actions, they will never succeed. Whether distant or near, even if separated by but a fraction from the realm of Confucius and Yan Hui, they will never grasp it. Thus, observing all things, one returns to the self: the eyes cannot exchange their duty to achieve success, nor can the hands and feet substitute for one another’s tasks. When an infant is first born, it does not seek milk with its eyes, nor turn toward light with its ears; it does not grasp objects with its feet, nor attempt to walk with its hands. Are the hundred limbs without fixed roles? Is the body without an inherent master, governed solely by sentiment? If one is called human, how can they be without sentiment? Yet they fail to understand that form and appearance are not sentiment. What I call sentiment is not this—if right and wrong, likes and dislikes, are taken as sentiment, then one who is without right and wrong, without likes and dislikes, though possessing human form, is merely human in appearance. Where, then, does sentiment reside?

The person without sentiment does not harm their body with likes and dislikes. To proceed directly and accept what comes is not sentiment. To constantly follow nature without overstepping what is fitting is to remain within what is proper. Why seek to preserve the body if one does not understand that life arises of itself and principle is self-sufficient? Zhuangzi also said that the principle of life is already complete within form and appearance; simply entrusting it allows the body to endure. The sentiments of likes and dislikes do not enhance life but only harm the body, for life has its allotted measure. If the spirit does not rest within the bounds of its nature, it becomes external; if essence does not abide within the limit of its self-generation, it becomes exhausted. Thus, one walks leaning against a tree, chanting, or sits propped against a catalpa, sleeping—this is the self-imposed suffering of those with sentiment. Heaven selects the form to manifest purity and clarity. All that you do—expending spirit, exhausting essence, leaning against trees, propping against catalpas, chanting and sleeping—this is what the world calls sentiment. Yet it is said that Heaven selects, for sentiment does not give rise to these things—how much less anything else? Thus, though the myriad things and myriad forms, their actions and choices, all arise within the realm of non-sentiment, what use is sentiment in their midst?

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The man with no lips or a large goiter was esteemed for his virtue by two rulers, forgetting his form. People do not know how to preserve their spirit—this is what they forget. They are enslaved by sight, hearing, thought, and worry—this is what they do not forget. To forget what should not be forgotten and not forget what should be forgotten—this is called true forgetting. It is not merely the form that is forgotten; in true forgetting, the sage roams where things cannot escape and all are preserved. If it were so, then knowledge would be a calamity—calamity is not the root. Constraint would be glue—glue is what binds the scattered.

To connect through virtue is how disparate bodies are joined; to trade skill as merchandise is not how one makes vessels.

The sage does not scheme—what use is knowledge? Does not carve—what use is glue? Has no loss—what use is virtue? Does not traffic—what use is trade? These four are the Heavenly Market. Thus, though possessing human form, they lack human sentiment, for their roaming abides in true forgetting. If they mingled with others, would they not wander amid worldly right and wrong? Not gaining these at the self, they embody the Heavenly Equality. In the lesser, they belong to man; in the greater, to Heaven.

In appearance, their movements and dignified bearing are nothing but the Dao. In form, their six limbs and nine orifices are Heaven-born—this suffices to be human. Why doubt they cannot be without sentiment?

Hui Shi insisted on no sentiment, like wood or stone, unfit to be human. Zhuangzi said: "What I call sentiment is not gaining right and wrong at the self. What I call no sentiment is not allowing likes and dislikes to inwardly harm the body." If so, this suffices to preserve the self—why seek to augment life?

Hui Shi, not knowing that movement itself is stillness, clung to the withered paulownia to seek stillness. Precisely this ignorance is failing to grasp what enables action. He let form be chosen by Heaven, yet clamored about "hard and white"—how could it not be strange?

**Bi Xu’s Commentary:**
The sage roams beyond forgetting form and forgetting virtue. Though daily employing virtue, he does not pride himself, so glue and calamity never sprout. Not scheming gain or harm—what use is knowledge? Not carving emotion and nature—what use is glue? Having no loss of things—what use is virtue? Not hoarding goods and wealth—what use is trade? These four are all Heaven’s nurturance.

The dung beetle rolling its ball, the spider weaving its web—this is unplanned knowledge. Cloud-dragon and wind-tiger, pine and cypress, dodder and mistletoe—this is uncarved glue. Birds and beasts in forests, fish and turtles in rivers—this is lossless virtue. Each thing seeks its own benefit, each manages its own life—this is untraded commerce. These are what Heaven nurtures, hence "Heaven feeds the formed but not the sentimental." Gazing upon them, they resemble wooden chickens.

A foot-long face, with differing features—this the Dao bestows. A six-foot body, with hollows and cavities no different—this Heaven bestows. Neither belongs to sentiment. If Heaven entrusts you with form, how can there be sentiment? It merely lives and breathes of itself.

Now you possess human form, no different from others, yet forcibly clamor about "hard and white" and "same and different" before the crowd, calling yourself worthy—like smelted metal leaping from the furnace, how could it not be monstrous?

**Xun Ben’s Commentary:**
*Du* 脰 means the neck; *jianjian* 肩肩 describes its slender length. It speaks of delighting in the lipless man, yet seeing a whole person makes one feel his neck is too long and ugly, unworthy of regard. The *Rites of Zhou*’s "Artificer" says *shumu du* 數目顅脰, with the note "long-necked appearance." *Jian* 肩 and *du* 顅 are the same. *Gaowu* 槁梧 is today’s withered paulownia. Paulownia species vary, but only withered paulownia makes zithers and lutes, hence their name.

**Fu Mo’s Commentary:**
These three—ugly in form—could make the lords of Qi and Wei admire them, seeing whole men as inferior. They loved their virtue, forgetting their form. From this, we know: form has its shortcomings, virtue its strengths. Shortcomings can make others forget them, while in oneself, as if forgotten, must avoid the taint of ugliness. Strengths can make others not forget them, while in oneself, if not forgotten, must avoid the flaw of pride. To not forget what should be forgotten and forget what should not—this is true forgetting.

Taking the word "forgetting," I derive my own learning and use the sage to verify it. The sage truly forgets what should not be forgotten. His mind has somewhere to roam. He treats knowledge as calamity and does not rely on it; oaths and pacts as glue and does not use them; virtue and kindness as social engagement and does not value them; skill and ability as traded goods and does not possess them. Why? The sage neither thinks nor plans—what use is knowledge? Uncarved and unhewn—what use is glue? Fundamentally nothing is lost—what use is virtue? Deeply hidden, not for sale—what use is trade? Since he has no use for others, he roams with Heaven. Thus, it is called the Heavenly Market. In the Heavenly Market, the sage is fed by Heaven—what use is man? Though possessing human form, his form is small, yet without the sentiment of right and wrong, his Heaven is great.

"The Dao bestows features, Heaven bestows form"—appearance, form, image, and visage all arise from what has never had a beginning. The Dao bestows them, which is Heaven bestowing them. Hui Shi said: "Since it is called human, how can there be no sentiment?" He wanted them to be like withered wood and dead ashes to be without sentiment. Thus, Zhuangzi said: "This is not what I call no sentiment." It means not allowing likes and dislikes to inwardly harm the body, always following the self-so of life without augmenting it. Laozi said: "To augment life is called ominous." Zhuangzi’s text follows this. Hui Shi still did not awaken, saying: "Without augmenting life, how can one have a self?" He did not know life need not be augmented. The Dao bestows features, Heaven bestows form—life’s principles are sufficient in themselves. From this sufficiency, one cannot follow nature and arbitrarily generate likes and dislikes, chasing delusion and losing truth. This not only brings no benefit but also harms. Now, your spirit—was it not bestowed by the Dao, your form by Heaven? Yet you estrange your essence, labor your spirit, lean on trees, cling to the withered paulownia, chanting and sleeping. Heaven chose your form—nothing is lacking—yet you cannot follow it, merely clamoring about "hard and white," endlessly setting up right and wrong and same and different in the world, merely burdened by sentiment. Observing Hui Shi’s debate with Zhuangzi, he was entirely unclear about the matter. I do not know why Zhuangzi befriended him.

**Guan Jian’s General Discussion:**
What enables things to live is called virtue—this is Heaven’s pure endowment. From it, form is completed and life honored; through it, nature and the Heavenly Dao can be known. Since virtue originates in Heaven and is fulfilled in man, can one not cherish and esteem oneself?

Things’ correspondences and responses, particular details, serve as seals of virtue. When virtue is fulfilled, its success is great—there are those who assist Heaven and Earth, aiding transformation and nurturance. Thus, Wang Tai could inspire respect in Confucius, who wished to lead the world to follow him. His cultivation must have greatly surpassed others. Without teaching or discussion, learners came empty and left full. If not through mind connecting with mind, life and death unchanged, things commanded and the root preserved, transformation issuing from oneself—how could he achieve this?

Those who attain the Dao forget form by observing what they relinquish and what they lose. Only when one can halt the many does one reveal the clarity of halting through emptiness. All these serve as the Way to fulfill virtue. When virtue is fulfilled, things naturally gravitate toward it—just as pines and cypresses stand among common trees, or Yao and Shun among the people. Is this merely fortune in rightly ordering one’s life? The true fortune lies in rightly ordering the lives of others, while one’s own life and death, fortune and misfortune, are as insignificant as mustard seeds. Thus, choosing the day to ascend or depart, staying or leaving, rests with oneself—how could one be ensnared by external things?

Shentu Wuqu’s amputation was no greater a loss than being lame; to see the lame as whole is to see wholeness itself. Zichan, despite his noble rank as a minister, was arrogant toward the lame—though noble, he was base in spirit. Wuzhi, though without toes, was honored, for what remained was weightier than feet. Heaven’s punishment cannot be undone, yet one who accepts fate remains no different from the whole. Aitaita’s androgyny so captivated others that Duke Ai forgot his own flaws and wished to entrust him with the state—not because he loved his form, but because he loved what shaped his form.

Thus, when supreme harmony operates within, illness dissipates without; virtue renews daily, and the Dao connects with spiritual transformation. Affairs are accomplished, yet one does not claim merit, and there is nowhere one does not become the归宿 of all things. Duke Ai regarded Confucius as a "virtue-friend," for virtue’s honor transcends rank. Duke Ling saw Wushen as whole, for virtue’s honor transcends form. The sage’s realm merges with things without boundary—how vast! Only by perfecting one’s Heaven can one forget what others cannot forget, and the purest beauty becomes irresistible.

Huizi was rich in talent but poor in virtue. When asked about likes and dislikes, he answered in terms of nature and fate, thus deeply correcting his flaws. By embodying the Dao in appearance and transcending form, he remained unharmed by likes and dislikes. With form yet without attachment, he constantly aligned with spontaneity. At this stage, virtue is fulfilled, and things correspond—self and other both exhausted, right and wrong, likes and dislikes dissolved in wordless understanding. How could one exhaust spirit and labor essence to boast of "hard and white"? Taking the mutilated and disfigured as exemplars serves as a warning to those who exalt form over inner virtue.

**Chapter Six: The Great and Venerable Teacher**
*(Guo’s commentary: Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things abundant, what they revere as teacher is the mindless.)*

One who knows Heaven’s doing and knows man’s doing has reached the utmost. To know Heaven’s doing is to be born of Heaven; to know man’s doing is to use one’s knowledge of the known to nourish one’s ignorance of the unknown, thus completing one’s Heaven-appointed years without premature death—this is the pinnacle of knowledge. Yet there is a peril: knowledge depends on conditions, and what it awaits remains uncertain. How can we be certain that what I call Heaven is not man, or what I call man is not Heaven? Only with the true person does true knowledge arise.

What is a true person? The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not dominate success, and did not scheme with scholars. Thus, they passed without regret and hit the mark without self-satisfaction. They ascended heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without burning—such is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao.

*(Guo’s commentary: To know Heaven’s and man’s doings is to know they are both spontaneous. Thus, one inwardly releases the self and outwardly guards against things, sharing the same task with the multitude of mysteries, yet nothing is left undone. "Heaven" means spontaneity. Those who act cannot truly act but act spontaneously; those who know cannot truly know but know spontaneously. Spontaneous knowing is not knowing; spontaneous acting is not acting. Thus, knowing arises from not-knowing, and acting arises from not-acting. Acting arises from not-acting, so non-action is primary; knowing arises from not-knowing, so not-knowing is fundamental. Therefore, the true person abandons knowledge yet knows, does not act yet acts, and lives spontaneously. By sitting in forgetfulness, one attains—thus knowledge is called "cut off" and action "gone.")*

Man’s life, though a mere seven feet in form, must possess the Five Constants. Thus, though the body is small, it upholds heaven and earth to sustain itself. Heaven, earth, and the myriad things—none can be absent for a single day. If one thing is missing, the living cannot live; if one principle is unfulfilled, one’s Heaven-appointed years cannot be completed. Yet what the body possesses, knowledge may not know; where principle resides, action may not act. Thus, what knowledge knows is little, while what the body possesses is much; what action does is few, while where principle resides is vast. Those above cannot measure it to seek completeness.

People’s knowledge need not be the same, nor should their actions dare to differ. Difference breeds artifice and loses the real. Some love knowledge tirelessly, exhausting their bodies—what they love is but a branch, yet the root is ruined. This is using what they know to harm what they do not know. But those with the fullest knowledge know man’s doing has limits, so they act without forcing; they know man’s knowledge has bounds, so they use it without excess. Thus, their knowledge does not exhaust itself in boundlessness, and within the body, knowing and not-knowing guard each other to remain whole. This is using what they know to nourish what they do not know.

The peril lies in saying that even the fullest knowledge is not as good as abandoning knowledge and entrusting oneself to Heaven’s carefree spontaneity. Knowledge cannot be without "can" or "cannot," so it must depend on conditions. But if one entrusts oneself to Heaven and lives, one meets things appropriately. What it awaits is uncertain—if it depends on conditions, there is no certainty. My life has limits (Heaven), but to seek to extend it is man. Yet this is merely man’s view. Things are all Heaven; Heaven is spontaneity. If all is spontaneity, then order and chaos, success and failure, encounter and non-encounter are not man’s doing but all spontaneous. Only with the true person does the world’s knowledge become truly unconfusable.

Not resisting the few means following the many; not dominating success means not relying on success to precede things; not scheming with scholars means following the heart’s direct path, and the multitude naturally gathers—not through scheming to achieve it, but simply preserving wholeness when meeting things without fault. Not taking gain and loss to heart—such is the principle’s inherent wholeness, not fear of death. Thus, the true person walks on land not to avoid getting wet, distances from fire not to escape heat, and makes no mistakes not through careful placement. Though not taking heat as heat, they never rush into fire; not taking wetness as wetness, they never step into water; not taking death as death, they never lose life. Thus, life—does it live by living?

The accomplished—does it accomplish by accomplishing? Thus, one who entrusts all and yet nothing fails to reach is the true person. How could they have preconceived notions about what they encounter? To speak of knowledge ascending to the Dao—how distant it is!

**Lü’s Annotation:**
To know what Heaven does is to know that what gives rise to me is Heaven. That which acts without acting, and in which humans have no part, is what knowledge cannot know. What knowledge can know is what humans do—thus, one nurtures what they do not know with what they do know. To say that knowledge nurtures life is not to make life follow knowledge; this is how one may live out their years without being cut short. What the world calls the pinnacle of knowledge does not surpass this, yet it still cannot avoid calamity. For what is called "knowing Heaven and knowing humans" must rely on knowledge to be correct—this is not the true essence of the Dao, and what it relies upon is inherently unstable. How then can we be certain that what we previously called "Heaven" is not human, or that what we called "human" is not Heaven? Only the true person possesses true knowledge, knowing with non-knowing and requiring no reliance. The world’s rights and wrongs are not uniform, so one merely follows the multitude—but following the multitude risks resisting the few. The earthly Dao achieves nothing yet succeeds in alternation; rigidity risks dominating success. Seeking unanimous counsel risks scheming with scholars. These are all traces of the sage’s response to the world, not their true essence. The true person embodies pure simplicity and selflessness—though they may err, they cannot but err; what regret could there be? Though they may act rightly, they cannot but act rightly; what self-satisfaction could there be? If so, then climbing heights is what I do—whom should I fear? Water and fire are also what I do—whom should I dread to wet or burn? Knowledge is not the Dao, yet the true person’s true knowledge can ascend to the Dao by borrowing from it. If so—

**New Transmission:**
Heaven and humans are both the Dao, and only those who fully embody the Dao can know what Heaven and humans do. To know what Heaven and humans do is to know with non-knowing. Knowing Heaven with non-knowing is to penetrate the wondrous principle of non-action; knowing humans with non-knowing is to exhaust the ultimate of action. This is Laozi’s "without desire, observe the subtle; with desire, observe the manifest." At this point, one cannot say it is not the pinnacle of knowledge, yet calamity still arises—because one knows the duality of Heaven and humans but not their unity. The far-seeing know that Heaven and humans are fundamentally the same, indistinguishably merged. This is what is meant by "emerging together yet differently named, together called the mysterious." Thus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise. True knowledge is non-knowing, yet it can uphold compliance to await the few, guard the feminine and appear deficient, not scheme nor strive, and scholars naturally gather. Thus it is said: not resisting the few, not dominating success, not scheming with scholars. How could the true person err in this way? If they ever err, it is not because they take gain and loss to heart. Not taking them to heart means having no mind for things; having no mind for things means not opposing them, and things will not harm them. Is this not how the true person differs from others? It is by entering the Dao through true knowledge. Thus it is said: knowledge ascends to the Dao by borrowing from it. If so—

**Personal Insight:**
"Few" refers to times of scarcity; "success" refers to times of abundance. In scarcity, one must comply to avoid harm; in abundance, one must be humble to avoid disaster. As for "scholars," it is explained through affairs: not thinking, not premeditating. If so, then in interactions and dealings, errors arise naturally—how could there be regret? Rightness also arises naturally—how could there be self-satisfaction? It is like drifting tiles or an empty boat: having no mind to oppose things, things do not resent them. With this, climbing heights—whom should one fear? With this, entering water and fire—what would wet or burn one? If even ascending to the Dao through knowledge is like this, how much more so for one who forgets knowledge and attains sudden awakening?

The true person of old slept without dreaming, awoke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reaches their heels; the common person’s breath reaches only their throat. Those who are submissive speak with a choked voice, as if obstructed; those with deep desires have shallow heavenly mechanisms. The true person of old did not delight in life nor detest death. Their going forth was not joyful, their return was not resistant. They came and went with ease, neither forgetting their origin nor seeking their end. They accepted and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is called not using the mind to discard the Dao, not using humans to assist Heaven. This is called the true person.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
"Slept without dreaming" means having no intentions. "Awoke without worry" means being content with whatever they encounter.

The true person eats without relishing—food is simply what ought to be eaten. Their breath reaches the heels, arising from the very root. A choked voice sounds as if obstructed, for their qi is not smooth and unobstructed. When the root is deep and the utmost tranquility attained, one returns to unity, free from desire; thus, those with deep cravings have shallow heavenly mechanisms.

Those who do not delight in life nor detest death embody transformation itself. Without resistance or obstruction, they remain at ease and yield to it. Their coming and going is effortless, for they entrust themselves to the supreme principle, and thus their movements are never difficult. They forget all beginnings and endings, all changes and transformations—how could they merely forget life while still seeking the meaning of death?

To accept and rejoice is to question not what is received, for whatever they encounter brings no discomfort. To forget and return is to return not through conscious effort, but to the utmost. Human beings are tranquil by nature at birth, for this is Heaven’s nature. When moved by external things, desire arises from this nature. Yet the things that stir people are endless, and if one pursues them without restraint, the heavenly principle is extinguished.

The true person knows that using the mind goes against the Dao, and that assisting Heaven harms life, so they do not act thus.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Without thoughts, one sleeps without dreaming; without cravings, one eats without relishing—then their breath becomes deep, reaching the heels. The heel is the origin of qi, the source from which breath arises. Just as the foot’s heel is the lowest part of the body, so too is the origin of breath described as the deepest. To go deeper still is to reach the point of no-breath.

The common person, having lost their foundation, is submissive, their voice choked as if obstructed—how could they attain breath that reaches the heels? Their heavenly mechanism is shallow, stirred by the slightest touch. But when breath reaches the heels, one distances oneself from external things.

Those who know life rejoice in it and detest death, resisting departure and rejecting return—this contradicts the so-called "carefree" state. It is to forsake the Dao with the heart, to love life and seek its origin, to fear death and seek its end. Unable to joyfully accept it or forgetfully return to it, they obscure their natural state and thus seek to enhance life—this is to assist Heaven.

**Yi Du’s Annotation:**
When the heart is free of thought, the hun-soul is at ease and does not wander among things, so sleep is dreamless. When the body is without action, the shen-spirit is at rest and not enslaved by things, so waking is free of worry. When flavors are tasteless, one savors the flavor yet is not bound by flavor, so food is not relished.

**Xun Ben’s Annotation:**
Deep breath is as if stored in the feet; shallow breath emerges from the throat. In truth, the Sea of Qi is the root of breath. The "heavenly mechanism" refers to the natural movement of qi, that is, breath. The deeper the cravings, the shallower the breath—like those who are submissive, whose cravings run deep, whose voices choke as if obstructed, whose heavenly mechanism is shallow.

**Bi Sheng’s Annotation:**
"Departing the world" means to go forth—birth, coming, beginning, and receiving. "Returning to transformation" means to enter—death, going, ending, and returning. To know that the beginning has no true beginning is to not forget one’s origin. To know that the end has no true end is to not seek one’s end. Thus can one move in and out of transformation, play with life and death—what joy or aversion could there be? To "forsake the Dao with the heart" is to alter the heart even slightly, thereby abandoning the Dao. The Dao has no life or death, yet people hold dual minds—what is this if not discarding the Dao? To "assist Heaven" is as Laozi said: to constrict one’s dwelling, to loathe one’s life, and to seek enhancement beyond the realm of the living. The true person does not act thus. Even to fear death and seek liberation is but a secondary principle.

Those who are thus have a steadfast heart and a tranquil countenance, their foreheads broad and unadorned, their demeanor as chilling as autumn, as warming as spring. Their joy and anger flow with the four seasons, aligning with things without fixed limit. Thus, when the sage employs military force, he may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. His beneficence extends through ten thousand generations, yet he does not act out of love for others. To delight in things is not sagely; to have partiality is not benevolent; to follow the seasons is not worthy; to be obstructed by profit and harm is not noble; to act for fame and lose oneself is not a scholar; to lose one’s life without authenticity is not to serve others. Those like Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Wu Zixu, Yu Jita, and Shentu Di serve others’ purposes, follow others’ paths, and do not follow their own—this is to be enslaved by others’ enslavement.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
To dwell in peace is to be steadfast. Though active, the tranquil remain unharmed in stillness. *Kui* describes the appearance of great simplicity. To seem as autumn, withering things, is not to act with authority; to seem as spring, nurturing things, is not to act with benevolence. Joy and anger flow with the four seasons, meaning one who embodies the Dao moves with change, like cold and heat—warm and stern without intent. Thus, the semblance of warmth and sternness, the rhythm of growth and decay, are merely named as joy and anger. To "align with things" is to be without intent toward them, so nothing is forced out of place, and nothing is out of place—thus none know its limit. In employing military force, he follows the people’s desire to perish, so they perish, and thus he does not lose their hearts. The sun ascends the sky, illuminating the six directions—not out of love for others, but naturally. Thus, the sage’s presence in the world is as warming as spring, naturally harmonious, so those who receive his blessings do not give thanks. It is as chilling as autumn frost, naturally descending, so those who wither do not resent it. The sage has no delight—things simply flow unimpeded where nothing obstructs them. He has no partiality.

To follow the principle is simply to let things exist as they are. As for the seasons, even the worthiest cannot compare to one who forgets time and naturally aligns with it. Unable to unify the path of right and wrong, pursuing profit and avoiding harm will damage virtue and burden one’s proper place.

The true scholar abandons fame and finds contentment within, so his name matches his reality, and fortune responds to his person. Those who lose their nature and force themselves to follow things are enslaved by many. How can they enslave others? Like Hu Bujie and Wu Guang, they all abandon themselves to serve others, sacrificing the self to harm the self.

*Lü’s Annotation:*
One whose heart and will are set on the Dao: when his appearance is tranquil, his spirit congeals, unmoving. When his brow is serene, he returns to simplicity, without affectation. Chill as autumn, he bears no hatred; warm as spring, he bears no love. Joy and anger flow through the four seasons, harmonizing with the harmony of Heaven—this is how he aligns with things. A state may perish, yet he does not lose the people’s hearts, for he has no intent to hate. His blessings extend for ten thousand generations, yet he does not act out of love. Toward things, he follows their natural unfolding. Toward benevolence, he forgets it entirely across the world. Toward the times, action and withdrawal rest with him. Even in hardship, he does not lose what he upholds—this is how the noble one’s steadfastness differs from that of the common people.

The scholar forgets loftiness and depth, abandons life and death—he enslaves others. Thus, from sages and worthies down to those who enslave others, though their ranks differ in honor and baseness, all must possess what is called the "real" to fulfill their names. Hu Bujie and Wu Guang were but slaves to those who enslave others, never attaining their own proper satisfaction. Only by acting without acting can one truly attain one’s own proper satisfaction.

*Bisheng’s Note:*
The character *zhi* (志), according to Zhao’s correction, should be *wang* (忘, "forget"), which aligns with the meaning of "tranquil appearance." His interpretation seems apt. As for Ji Fu’s explanation of "enslaving others," it likely derives from *Xumi*, where one ascends heights without fear and abandons life and death. The idea is subtle, yet when viewed alongside the later phrase "slaves to those who enslave others," it becomes even clearer that Master Zhuang’s analysis is precise.

The true person of old had a demeanor upright yet not partisan, appearing insufficient yet not submissive. His edges were sharp yet not rigid, vast in emptiness yet not ostentatious. His joy was abundant, as if pleased; his bearing was lofty, as if compelled. His advance was smooth, enhancing my countenance; his pause was yielding, deepening my virtue. Stern, he seemed worldly; aloof, he seemed beyond control. Connected, he seemed fond of seclusion. Oblivious, he forgot his words.

He took punishment as his body, ritual as his wings, wisdom as his timing, and virtue as his path. Taking punishment as his body, he was lenient in execution. Taking ritual as his wings, he moved through the world. Taking wisdom as his timing, he acted only when unavoidable. Taking virtue as his path, he spoke as if he had feet, reaching the hills—yet people truly believed he exerted himself in practice.

*Guo’s Annotation:*
"Upright yet not partisan" means aligning with things without forming cliques. "Empty and without excess" means appearing insufficient. "Lowering himself without fail to raise others" means appearing insufficient yet not submissive. "Sharp yet not rigid" means roaming alone without fixed attachment. "Vast yet not ostentatious" means expansive and free, reaching true substance. "Abundant joy" means the perfected person has no joy, yet his harmony is so complete it seems joyful. "Lofty, as if compelled" means his movements, stillness, actions, and pauses always reside at the extreme of naturalness. "Smooth advance" means he does not let things harm himself. "Yielding pause" means he has no direction to pursue. "Stern, seeming worldly" means the perfected person is not stern, yet moves in step with the world, appearing so. "Aloof, beyond control" means he is high and free, self-content. "Connected, seeming fond of seclusion" means his depth is boundless, his gate unseen. "Oblivious, forgetting words" means he does not know or recognize, yet the heavenly mechanism moves of itself.

The penal code is the embodiment of governance, yet it is not I who enact it; ritual is the world’s own conduct, not something I impose. Knowledge arises from the movement of the times, not from my leading; virtue is what others follow, not what I create. To take the penal code as one’s foundation is to entrust governance to its own course—though it kills, it is lenient. To take ritual as one’s wings is to follow the flow of the times, so nothing fails to proceed. High and low receive one another in an irreversible current; small and great gather in an inevitable momentum. Vast and without emotion, it is the repository of all knowledge. Embracing the confluence of a hundred streams, dwelling at the teacher of humanity’s extremity—what is there to do? Entrust the knowledge of the times to necessity, consign the affairs of the world to their natural course, and that is all.

The root is what gives rise to all things. Speaking in terms of nature, it is the root of nature. Each thing has what suffices, and what suffices is its root. To entrust the self-following of the myriad virtues is to join those with what suffices in reaching the root. When the root is reached, principle is exhausted. All this is accomplished by others; its completion does not lie with oneself. Thus, though one dwells at the extremity of ten thousand affairs, one remains ever at leisure, self-content, unaware of the passage of events through the body, oblivious to the presence of words in the mouth. Yet people’s great delusion is to call the perfected person’s effortless conduct "diligent action."

】Profound Dao【
Its form is righteous yet not cliquish, unapproachable in intimacy or distance. Seeming deficient yet not deferential, beyond valuation as noble or base. Angular yet not rigid, conduct though not rounded is not obstinate. Empty yet not ostentatious, patterns though not substantial do not destroy substance. Joyful, as if in harmonious ease. Lofty...

Pressed by necessity, only then does one respond—how replete! Advancing, my countenance is restrained, essence stored within, spirit issuing without. How harmonious! Halting, my virtue is employed outwardly, undissipated inwardly. How stern! How towering! How continuous! These three attain the utmost in non-action. How oblivious! Such words are the utmost in wordlessness.

The Dao of the perfected person reaches non-action and wordlessness, taking penal codes, rites, knowledge, and virtue as its root alone. The classics often compare the Dao to mountains and virtue to hills—Mount Miaogu, the hidden hills of Yinfen, Mount Juci, and the Kunlun mounds are such examples. That people mistake the perfected person’s effortless conduct for diligent action is like gazing upon the multitude of the ten thousand things and suspecting Heaven and Earth of laborious carving.

Thus, whether one favors it or not, it is unified; whether one unifies it or not, it remains one. Those who unify it walk with Heaven; those who do not walk with man. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the perfected person. Life and death are its constants, like night and day, like Heaven. That humans cannot partake in this is the nature of things. If one takes Heaven as father and still cherishes the body, how much more should one cherish that which transcends it? If one considers having a lord superior and still dies for the body, how much more should one die for the genuine?

When springs run dry, fish find themselves stranded together on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—yet how much better to forget each other in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, how much better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.

Guo’s commentary:
To remain ever without intent yet follow others is to make no distinction between what one favors or disfavors, what one deems good or evil—all becomes one with them. That oneness is walking with Heaven; its absence is walking with man. The perfected person harmonizes Heaven and man, equalizing self and other, for their oneness admits no division. To lack oneness is to be without any lack of oneness—this is Heaven. To insist "that is that" and "this is this" is the way of man. The perfected person unites Heaven and man, aligning the myriad things without mutual rejection, for Heaven and man do not overcome one another. Thus, they are boundlessly without division, effortlessly without resistance, and profoundly one with all things.

Life and death are constants like night and day, the Way of Heaven. To know life and death is to grasp the ultimate of destiny—no delusion lies therein. They are but night and day; what bondage could there be? The perfected person, in daylight, attains daylight; in night, attains night. Taking life and death as day and night, what could they fail to attain? That humans fret and grieve over what they cannot possess is merely the nature of things, not principle. The transcendent is called "solitary transformation." No achievement of interdependence surpasses the perfection of solitary transformation.

What humans depend upon is Heaven; what Heaven engenders is solitary transformation. All regard Heaven as father, thus they endure day and night, cold and heat without complaint—how much more should they accept the transcendent, solitary transformation that reaches the ultimate of the mysterious and boundless? How could they not yield to it? The genuine is not borrowed from things but arises naturally. The inviolable nature of the natural extends far beyond mere obedience to a lord’s command.

Thus, the parable of the stranded fish: to love one another in scarcity is not as good as to forget one another in abundance. Praise and blame arise from insufficiency; in perfect sufficiency, good and evil are forgotten, life and death are left behind, and one becomes one with transformation. Boundless and without obstruction, what concern could there be for the whereabouts of Yao or Jie?

Lü’s commentary:
Things are seen by what unites them, not by what divides them. Thus, those who favor them call them beautiful and good, and beauty and goodness arise from this; those who disfavor them call them ugly and not good, and ugliness and not-goodness also arise from this. Therefore, favor and disfavor are one. Oneness is like still water; its absence is like flowing waves—yet both are water. Knowing this, one does not merely cease when ceasing.

That which is one walks with Heaven, retiring into concealment; that which is not one walks with man, sharing in the people’s fortunes and misfortunes. What comes without being summoned is destiny; what is done without being acted upon is Heaven. Thus, humans cannot possess certain things—this is the nature of things. Why should I indulge in sorrow or joy over them? Taking Heaven as that from which I am born, I still cherish the body—how much more should I cherish that which gave birth to my birth, my true Father? How transcendent! Could I not love it?

If one truly knows its transcendence and loves it, then life holds no cause for joy—this is evident. Do people merely consider having a ruler preferable? Even one’s own body perishes—how much more so that which is truly real? If one knows its essence and heeds it, then death holds no cause for fear—this is evident. The source of nature and destiny lies in the parched depths, yet people, stranded on the dry land of artifice, gasp and moisten one another with the damp foam of benevolence and righteousness—how much better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes of the Dao’s arts, oblivious to life and death, gathering and dispersal.

For delighting in life and loathing death is but human sentiment; the Dao is without death and without life. Praising Yao and condemning Jie is likewise but sentiment. Knowing both and forgetting both, transcending praise to embody the Dao—then that by which one forgets life and death is not originally different.

**New Transmission:**
The true person is without intent, and their likes and dislikes are thus unified. The true person embraces duality and is not one, and thus is in accord. Without intent and unified, they follow nature—hence it is said they "walk with Heaven." Embracing oneness and in accord, they may be moved by circumstances—hence it is said they "walk with man." Slander and praise are but the vicissitudes of worldly sentiment; though the sage responds to them, their heart is truly without them. Yet if one abandons worldly sentiment and insists on regarding the forgetting of both as correct, how then can one "walk with man"? This is what Zhuangzi criticizes, yet the foolish Confucians instead criticize Zhuangzi.

**Supplementary Notes:**
Only here is the reason for not delighting in life or loathing death revealed. "Like" is delight; "dislike" is loathing.

The reason for neither delighting in life nor loathing death is the knowledge of its oneness—this "one" is Heaven. Knowing its oneness, one does not assist Heaven with human effort nor discard the Dao with the heart. What is called "only with a true person can there be true knowledge" refers to knowing this alone—this is the true nature of things. Life and death are fated, like Heaven’s constant alternation of night and day, beyond human power to alter. This is the unchanging principle of things, what is called "transcendent and true." Humans cannot depart from this Dao, just as fish cannot leave water. If one departs from it, the one is no longer one, and right and wrong, slander and praise arise in confusion. How much better is it to forget both and be transformed by the Dao?

This is the oneness that unifies the one and the not-one. Not only should right and wrong, slander and praise be entrusted to mutual forgetting, but even the great change of life and death should be forgotten, without the slightest interference of human effort. Though life and death are not one, their oneness has never ceased to be one.

The great clod burdens me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to perfect my life is to perfect my death. Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh may seem secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unaware will not know. Though hiding the small and large may be fitting, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for escape—this is the great truth of things.

Only when one encounters the human form does one rejoice in it, yet the forms of humanity are but one of ten thousand transformations, without beginning or end. How can their joy be measured? Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and abides where all are preserved—perfecting early death, perfecting old age, perfecting beginnings, perfecting ends. People still imitate this, let alone the myriad things that depend on it and the one transformation that awaits them.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Form, life, old age, and death are all myself. Thus, form burdens me, life wearies me, old age eases me, and death rests me. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be me—why should I cling to them? Death and life are both fate. If there is no perfection, so be it; if there is perfection, then life is not alone in being perfected. If one deems one’s life good, then one’s death is also good.

To illustrate the inescapability of life and death’s transformations, first present the extreme of inescapability, then clarify it with the inevitability of change, so as to follow transformation without attachment. The power of the powerless is greatest in transformation. Thus, one lifts heaven and earth to pursue the new, shoulders mountains and peaks to abandon the old. Without the slightest pause, one has already traversed the new—heaven and earth, the myriad things, are never still. The world is all renewed, yet one takes it as the old. Boats and mountains change daily, yet one sees them as before. Now, in the blink of an arm, they are gone, vanished in an instant.

Thus, the "I" of the past is no longer the "I" of the present. I and the present both pass—how can one constantly guard the old? Yet the world does not realize this, believing what is encountered now can be grasped and held. Is this not delusion? Not knowing one’s body is transformation and seeking to hide it so it does not change—though one may hide it most deeply and securely, each in its proper place, nothing can prevent its daily transformation. Thus, those who hide and possess cannot stop its escape, while those who do not hide and yield to transformation cannot be changed by change.

Without anything to hide and fully yielding to it, one is one with things and one with transformation. There is no inner or outer, no life or death—embodying heaven and earth, merging with change, seeking escape yet finding none. This is the great truth of things, not the petty concerns of a single corner.

The human form is but one encounter among ten thousand transformations. In the boundless, what one encounters is all like the human form—why should only the human form be delightful while other things bring no joy? Originally not human, one transforms into human, losing what was before. Losing the old and rejoicing in what is encountered—what is encountered in endless transformation? Where is there no encounter? Where there is encounter, there is joy—how can joy have limits?

The sage wanders the paths of transformation, drifts in the currents of daily renewal. The myriad things and myriad transformations transform with him; the boundless transforms with him—who can escape? In life, one is gone; in death, one is preserved. If in death one is preserved, then when is one not preserved?

Those who are content within a hundred years, who do not perfect youth but deny old age, cannot embody transformation or equalize life and death. Yet their equanimity and purity are still enough to serve as teachers for others. How much more so for those who profoundly unite with the myriad things and embody transformation—they are rightly the masters of the world.

Lü’s Annotation:
The great cosmos is by nature indifferent to me. If I do good in life, then my death must also be good—what have I to love or hate? Things, whether great or small, exist when the mind is present and perish when the mind is absent. If one acts contrary to the Dao, nothing remains that does not depart. Thus, hiding a boat or concealing a mountain in a ravine or marsh may seem secure, yet once the mind is distracted, they vanish in an instant. Even at the profoundest hour of midnight, if there is something to be hidden, and one hides it in the most recondite place, could any but the most powerful accomplish this? To conceal things large and small appropriately and still have them escape—how could this be the nature of ordinary things? The world is where the myriad things attain unity. Concealed within this unity, even the most powerful, though they might wish to bear it away, would find nowhere to take it. Without true knowledge, one cannot partake of this.

Sengzhao’s Treatise:
Zhuangzi’s concealing of the boat and Confucius’s lament over the flowing river both arise from the difficulty of retaining what has passed. Why is this? People assume that youth and prime are of the same body, that a hundred years share one substance, knowing only that the years depart but not sensing that the form follows. Thus, when the Brahmin left home and returned with white hair, his neighbors asked, “Is the man of former days still here?” The Brahmin replied, “I am like the man of former days, yet not the man of former days.” The neighbors were all astonished, not grasping his words. This is what is meant by “the powerful bear it away and hasten, while the deluded do not perceive”—is this not the case?

Jiang Yu:
Things embody transformation, and the body follows transformation, vanishing within a hundred years. Within this span, the great transformation occurs four times, cycling repeatedly. Seasons change, years shift, days alter, and months transform—even in the space of a single breath, a sigh before and after reveals difference. It is like the wind striking water: the former wave is not the latter wave. It is like a lamp in a jar: the later flame is not the earlier flame. In the space between lowering and raising one’s gaze, the form has already undergone ten thousand changes. The deluded are imperceptibly moved by creation, seeing only the traces of their own form and unaware of creation’s silent operation. They rejoice in a thing’s completion but do not know the principle of its decay is already latent. They lament a thing’s decay but do not know the principle of its completion has already advanced. Yangzi’s profound words, “The moon wanes in the east, not knowing it waxes in the west,” speak of the subtle shifts of the great transformation, the alternating advance of decay and completion.

To seek this in oneself: the toil of a hundred years—complexion, wisdom, demeanor, skin, nails, hair—changes without cease. How could this be clearer? Why, then, does one not awaken to it? This is the meaning of Zhuangzi’s discourse on concealing the boat and Confucius’s sigh over the flowing river.

Personal Insight:
Concealing the boat or hiding the mountain is a metaphor for man’s place within creation, where one cannot escape creation’s ceaseless change. All things in the world, if concealed, must escape; if they escape, they do not endure. Only when there is nothing to conceal do things not escape and all endure. The place where things do not escape and all endure is the realm of nothingness, the boundless wilds. To attain this and wander therein, to meet all things without intention, to be open and all-pervading—nothing is not preserved. This is the Dao of concealing the world within the world. Though one enters and exits the mechanism of life, undergoes ten thousand transformations, one sees only daily renewal—where can things escape?

Yet people, clinging to private views, often claim things as their own, deeming boats and mountains unchanging objects, ravines and marshes secure hiding places, forms and substances unalterable. They do not realize that the hidden pivot silently revolves, that not an inch of time halts, that things and earth transform together with form, all unknowing. If one wishes to transcend and escape transformation, is there a Dao for this? It is said: have no concealment, no attachment; let the mind wander with heaven. Even the present is unattainable—how could one know what is called escaping transformation?

The Dao possesses sentiment yet is without emotion; it holds constancy yet is without form. It may be transmitted but not received, attained yet not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted—before heaven and earth existed, it stood firm from ancient times. Spirits and gods, emperors and thearchs, heaven and earth all arise from it, yet it does not reside above in the Great Ultimate, nor below within the Six Poles. Before heaven and earth were born, it was not ancient; though older than high antiquity, it is not aged.

Xi Wei attained it and thereby lifted heaven and earth; Fu Xi grasped it and thereby inherited the Mother of Qi. The Northern Dipper holds it and thus remains unerring through all ages; the sun and moon possess it and thus never cease their course. Kan Pi obtained it and thereby inherited Kunlun; Ping Yi mastered it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jian Wu acquired it and thereby dwelled in the great mountains; the Yellow Emperor attained it and thereby ascended the cloudy heavens. Zhuan Xu secured it and thereby resided in the Dark Palace; Yu Qiang stood firm by it at the North Pole. The Queen Mother of the West gained it and thereby sat in Shaoguang—none know its beginning, none know its end. Peng Zu possessed it, reaching from the age of Yu to the Five Hegemons; Yi Yin obtained it and thereby assisted Wu Ding, encompassing all under heaven, riding the Eastern Ridge and Tail Stars to rank among the constellations.

The Dao has the sentiment of the insentient, hence it is without action; it has the constancy of the inconstant, hence it is without form. Though it has dwelled through ancient and modern times, none can receive and possess it—all may find refuge within it, yet none perceive its form. Before heaven and earth existed, it stood firm from ancient times, revealing that nothing does not depend on being, yet it is non-being. How could non-being generate spirits? It does not spirit gods and thearchs, yet gods and thearchs are spirited of themselves—this is the spirit of non-spiriting. It does not generate heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth generate themselves—this is the generation of non-generating.

Thus, if one’s achievements are insufficient to be deemed spirit, yet one does not spirit, then one is truly spirit. What merit is there to claim? What deeds are there to rely upon? The Dao is high yet not high, deep yet not deep, enduring yet not enduring, aged yet not aged—it is nowhere absent, yet wherever it is, it is not.

Moreover, it reaches all above and below, yet cannot be named by high or low; it pervades all within and without, yet cannot be termed inner or outer. It moves with transformation, so cannot be called enduring; it is ever without beginning or end, so cannot be called aged. From Xi Wei’s attainment to ranking among the stars, those who gain it do so by the Dao, yet this only clarifies their self-attainment. The Dao cannot cause them to attain it, nor can my own lack of attainment prevent their attainment. Thus, all who attain it do not rely on the Dao externally nor depend on themselves internally—they suddenly attain it and transform alone.

The difficulty of life lies precisely in this solitary transformation and self-attainment. Having already attained life, why fear not attaining it and strive for it? Thus, striving for life is truly insufficient to preserve life, for life does not arise from oneself. To strive for it is to harm one’s true life.

Lǚ’s Annotation:
Eyes and ears attain it to see and hear; hands and feet attain it to move—how could this not be endowed with sentiment? Cold and heat attain it to come and go; the myriad things attain it to be born and nurture—how could this not be endowed with sincerity? Yet seeking what enacts it, one cannot find it—it is formless. Sometimes it is understood without speech, sometimes it is present at a glance—this can be transmitted, yet none can possess it; it cannot be received. Only by the heart’s resonance does it suddenly align—this can be attained, yet no trace of it can be grasped; it cannot be seen. The birth of the myriad things has never lacked a root, yet this is self-rooted and self-originating. The myriad things arise only after heaven and earth, yet this existed before heaven and earth, enduring since antiquity. Ghostly lords attain me through spirit, yet I am not spirit—even ghostly lords remain without numinous response. Heaven and earth attain me through life, yet I am not life—even now, I remain as the Supreme Polarity. Depth and height describe its form; age and antiquity describe its time, yet I am without form and without time—thus the Dao is hidden and nameless.

The sages of antiquity differed in concealment or manifestation, yet none became sages without attaining the Dao. This was not limited to Xi Wei alone, nor to Kui or Kui. The Dao is the mother of all under heaven; from heaven downward, none have stood without attaining the Dao. This was not limited to the Dipper and the sun and moon alone—this is why it is called the Supreme Ancestral Master.

*Brush Records*:
The Supreme Ancestral Master is the Dao. Only here is it made clear that Kui emerged from the formless, non-active Dao. Yet to speak of it as possessing sentiment and sincerity is to describe it from the perspective of those who perceive its subtleties. Sentiment is the movement of stillness; sincerity is the tally of movement—this is the "sincerity" of which Laozi spoke when he said, "Within it, there is sincerity." The Great Simplicity is before qi is seen; the Great Beginning is the inception of qi, before qi is seen. As the father, qi is the mother. The Northern Dipper is the net’s rope of heaven, hence called the "Dipper’s rope." Kanpei is the name of a spirit, with a human face and beast’s body. The *Qingling Zhuan* states: Hua Yin of Tongxiang, a man who ingested eight minerals, became a water immortal and was called the River Earl. Another account says he bathed in the river on the gengzi day of the eighth month and drowned. The mountain spirit of Jianwu is undying; by Confucius’ time, the Yellow Emperor had attained the Dao and ascended at Mount Dinghu. The Dark Palace is the northern palace. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: Its lord is Zhuanxu, its spirit is Xuanming. Yushang is the sea god. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: On an islet in the Northern Sea there is a spirit with a human face and bird’s body, wearing two blue serpents as earrings and treading two red serpents, named Yushang. The Queen Mother of the West: The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* describes her as resembling a human, with a dog’s tail, disheveled hair, wearing a sheng, skilled in whistling, and dwelling by the banks of the Xun River. Emperor Wu of Han’s *Inner Biography* records the Queen Mother of the West and the Upper Prime Lady descending; the emperor admired their divine beauty as immortals. Shaoguang is the name of a mountain, also said to be the name of the western void. Kui is a star above the tail, said to ride the eastern rope between the Winnowing Basket and the Tail.

Nanbo Zikui asked Woman Yu [Yu]:
"Your years are advanced, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this?"
"I have heard the Dao."

Nanbo Zikui said, "Can the Dao be learned?"
She replied, "How could it be? You are not the right person.

Now, there is Bolang Yi, who possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, teaching the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy indeed.

I still guarded and instructed him. After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once the world was outside, I again guarded and instructed him. After seven days, he was able to put things outside himself. Once things were outside, I again guarded and instructed him. After nine days, he was able to put life outside himself. Once life was outside, he could then attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, he could then perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could then enter the realm of neither death nor life.

That which kills life does not die; that which gives life does not live. As for this thing: nothing it does not send forth, nothing it does not welcome, nothing it does not destroy, nothing it does not complete. Its name is *Yingning*—*Yingning* is that which achieves through disturbance."

Nanbo Zikui said, "Where did you alone learn this?"

The Master said, "I have heard it said: what I heard came from the disciple of *Fumo*; the disciple of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*; the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*; *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*; *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*; *Xuyi* heard it from *Wu'ou*; *Wu'ou* heard it from *Xuanning*; *Xuanning* heard it from *Canliao*; *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*—that which kills life is not death, that which gives life is not life."

Guo Xiang's commentary:
To hear the Dao is to allow life to arise of itself, thus one’s qi and complexion remain whole. *Wai* means to relinquish. Things are what one requires from morning to night, yet they are difficult to forget. To put life outside is to abandon it entirely. To relinquish life is to cease hating death; ceasing to hate death, one finds peace in whatever is encountered, utterly unobstructed, acting upon the subtlest signs—this is morning clarity. To find peace in whatever is encountered is to forget all that comes before and after—this is perceiving the solitary. Without past or present, one moves with the solitary. Clinging to life brings death; hating death brings life. Without clinging or hating, there is neither death nor life. Allowing things to depart of themselves, nothing is not sent forth; allowing things to arrive of themselves, nothing is not welcomed; allowing things to be destroyed of themselves, nothing is not destroyed; allowing things to be completed of themselves, nothing is not completed. That which moves with things is itself moved by things, yet remains ever at peace. If things move while the solitary does not, this is defeat. Thus, to be moved yet allow it is to bring all things to their perfect fulfillment.

*Xuanning* names that which is not nothing yet is not being. To ascend by names to reach nothingness is to attain nothingness beyond names. Thus, though *Xuanning* is profound, it does not reach the ultimate, and so one must further entrust it to *Canliao*—profound upon profound. The principles of spontaneity may be cultivated through accumulated practice, ascending from the near to the far, refining from the coarse to the subtle. Thus, after seven layers, the name of nothingness is left behind; after nine layers, one doubts even the beginning of nothingness.

Lü Huiqing's commentary:
When one hears the Dao, cares and troubles cannot enter, which is why one’s years may lengthen while one’s countenance remains youthful. Those who possess the Dao of the sage grasp its great root and great source; those with the talent of the sage apply this Dao to the world and the state. Boliang Yi had the talent but not the Dao, so one must guard and instruct him, progressing from the coarse to the subtle. First putting the world outside, then putting things outside, then putting life outside—only then does one attain morning clarity, sinking into profound obscurity within the body until, self-examining, one reaches clarity at dawn. To perceive the solitary is for each thing to find its counterpart, without past or present, uniting the myriad ages into one pure whole. In the realm of neither death nor life, what dies is killed by me, yet I have never died; what lives is given life by me, yet I have never lived. Though sending forth and welcoming, destroying and completing all involve disturbance, I have never been imperiled—thus the name *Yingning*. *Yingning* is that which achieves through disturbance.

The Dao, when embodied, is the norm; what is discussed in texts and writings is but its secondary aspect. *Luosong* means to recite by threading together; "descendants" refers to where the Dao is generated. *Zhanming* is the clarity of perceiving principle; *Niexu* is to tread and practice it.

To employ through need is to utilize things in song and chant, delighting them. From *Fumo* to *Zhanming*, learning yields insight; from *Niexu* to *Ou*, practice leads to joy—yet none of these suffice as the embodied Dao. In *Xuanning*, there is no seeing, no knowing; in *Canliao*, there is neither "also" nor establishment. To doubt it as the beginning yet not know it as the beginning—this is how it begins.

**Following the Root:**
*Chaoche* means sudden, thorough clarity—not awaiting seven or nine days. To wither the form and kill the heart is to "kill life," yet not die; to indulge passions and indulge desires is to "give life," yet not live. "Sending forth" is disturbance; *Fumo* and *Luosong* borrow the names of texts and writings; *Zhanming* and *Niexu* borrow the names of ears and eyes; to "employ through need in song" borrows the names of laborers and ballads. *Canliao* means to merge with the vast, boundless beginning—profound and ever more profound.

**Secondary Aspects:**
Above, it speaks of attaining the Dao; here, it speaks of the Dao’s difficulty to hear and transmit. To "set aside the world" differs from "setting aside things." The world is distant yet things are near; the world is estranged while things are intimate. Thus, setting aside the world is easy, but setting aside things is hard. To set aside things is to assist in setting aside life; setting aside life is to forget the self. Only after forgetting the self can one reach *Chaoche*; only after *Chaoche* can one perceive the solitary. The solitary matches nothing. Perceiving the solitary, there is no past or present, no going or coming—this is how one may speak of the Dao.

It further explains how to enter the realm of neither life nor death: "Killing life" does not mean death, for the heart dies while the spirit lives; "giving life" does not mean life, for the heart lives while the spirit dies. The world engages in sending forth and welcoming, completing and destroying, intertwining with all things. The human heart wanders among them—now inclining toward one, now welcoming another; now fearing destruction, now achieving completion. Birth and death surge ceaselessly, never resting. Those who detest this seek to cast it aside, not realizing that removing the heart of birth and death is itself birth and death. How then can one enter the realm of neither death nor life? Now, there is no "sending forth."

No welcoming, no destroying, no completing—following what arrives of itself while I harbor no accommodating mind: this is called "touching tranquility." "Touching tranquility" means achieving completion through contact. It is to attain great stability amid the world’s tangled turmoil, thus realizing the true aspect without destroying the world’s appearances. How could this be the same as those who seek completion through severing and extinguishing the seeds of nature?

It is like written words on bamboo slips, recited verses in the Luoyang dialect, the vision of one who gazes clearly, the hearing of one who listens keenly, the movement of one who serves, the singing of one who chants. Profound and abyssal, vast and empty—doubting the beginning, doubting that there was ever a beginning at all. Speaking of the Dao, one grasps it through language and script, yet comprehends it with the heart and unites with it through spirit. This is how one’s own "dawn clarity" arises, and how one sees alone.

Zisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke among themselves, saying: "Who can take non-action as the head, life as the spine, and death as the rump? Who understands that death and life, existence and extinction, are of a single body? We would befriend such a one." The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord. They then became friends.

Before long, Ziyu fell ill. Zisi went to inquire after him, saying: "How magnificent! That the Creator would make me like this—so hunched and twisted!" His back was arched, his hair grew upward, five organs protruded from his spine, his chin was tucked into his navel, his shoulders rose above his head, and his neck bones jutted toward the sky. The qi of yin and yang had become disordered, yet his heart remained at ease, untroubled. He hobbled to a well and gazed at his reflection, saying: "Alas! That the Creator would again make me like this—so hunched and twisted!"

Zisi said: "Do you resent it?"

He replied: "Why should I resent it? If, by degrees, the Creator were to transform my left arm into a rooster, I would use it to herald the dawn. If, by degrees, the Creator were to transform my right arm into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt an owl for roasting. If, by degrees, the Creator were to transform my buttocks into a wheel and my spirit into a horse, I would mount them—why ever change steeds?

Moreover, to gain is to meet one’s time; to lose is to follow the flow. Abiding in time and dwelling in flow, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called ‘suspension and release.’ Yet if one cannot release oneself, things will bind one fast. For long now, things have not prevailed over Heaven—why then should I resent it?"

The *Comprehensive Meaning* states: "Head, spine, and tail are but the beginning and end of all things. All things begin in the formless and end in the formless—their birth and death are but the arising and ceasing of a single thought, the coming and going of a single breath. If one enters the state beyond death and birth, where then does one’s existence reside, if not beyond this seven-foot frame?"

Presently, Zilai fell ill, gasping for breath as if on the verge of death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Li went to inquire and shouted: "Away! Do not disturb the transformation!" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to Zilai: "How wondrous! The Creator—what will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s arm?"

Zilai replied: "Wherever a child is sent by father and mother—east, west, south, or north—he must follow their command. How can one defy yin and yang, which stand to us as father and mother? If they bring me near death and I refuse to heed, I would be obstinate. What fault would lie with them? The Great Clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and reposes me in death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.

Now, when the great smith smelts metal, the metal leaps up, crying, ‘I must become a *Mo Ye* sword!’ The smith would surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Yet once it assumes human form and declares, ‘I am a man! I am a man!’—the Creator must surely deem it an inauspicious being. Now, if we take heaven and earth as the great furnace and the Creator as the great smith, where can one go and not be at peace?" Thereupon, Zilai fell into a deep sleep, then awoke as if from a dream.

Guo's Annotation:
"Death and life are but waking and dreaming—by principle, one ought to dream without wishing to be startled awake, for when transformation comes, to rebuke it is to resist in vain. Since ancient times, some may have defied their parents’ commands, yet none have defied the changes of yin and yang or resisted the cycles of day and night. Death and life are no more than day and night, not something to oppose. When the time for death arrives, it is not something to forbid, yet stubbornly refusing to heed it only hastens one’s end through obstinacy. The swiftness of death arises from one’s own defiance, not from death itself. That which calls it ‘death’ exists in life, and thus to treat life well is to treat death well—principle remains constant in both. ‘I am a man! I am a man!’—this wish alone is like the metal leaping in the smelter. The world knows such metal is inauspicious, yet cannot allow it to transform of its own accord. The Dao of transformation encounters nothing it does not meet. Now, when it meets human form, was this done intentionally? Life is not made by design; it arises in its time. To cling to it and claim possession—is this not delusion? All know that metal bound to a purpose is inauspicious. Once one sees that the self is no different from that metal, the attachments of the heart may be untied. Untied, there is nothing that cannot be. ‘Falling into deep sleep, then awaking as if from a dream’—waking and dreaming remain as they are, unburdened by death or life."

Lü's Annotation:
"Mice and insects are what people most despise, and when their qi and form scatter, they become liver or limbs—things even more detested. At such a time, to ask what is despised or detested is to test Zilai’s equanimity. Knowing that yin and yang do not stand to us as father and mother, yet heeding them; knowing that the Great Clod reposes us in death, and thus treating it well—what need is there to ask, ‘What are you? What are you fit for?’ The metal leaping in the smelter is deemed inauspicious, and so too is the human wish to be human. Now, if we take heaven and earth as the furnace and the Creator as the smith, then mouse liver and insect limbs can be formed anywhere without hindrance. ‘Falling into deep sleep, then awaking as if from a dream’—the passage between death and life is as unhurried as waking and dreaming, unchanged by it."

Personal Insight:
"Man exists in the world as one among ten thousand things, and of those called ‘human,’ how many hundreds of millions are there? Why then do you cling to this? Release the stagnant mind and open the vast heart. The metaphor of smelted metal warns that the common fear of death, when inescapable, leads to calculations for future lives—yet even the slightest attachment entangles one for ten thousand kalpas. Like metal leaping in the smelter, it is only by being different that it seeks the *Mo Ye* sword, which cannot be guaranteed. Thus, the perfected person takes heaven and earth as the furnace and the Creator as the smith, moving with boundless transformation. Why must one say, ‘I am a man! I am a man!’ and worry over not attaining it? Observe how the ancients conducted themselves—were they ever constrained by life and death? For they took life as dreaming and death as waking. If death is waking, then what time is not waking?"

Zisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Zi Qin Zhang became friends, saying to one another, "Who can join together without joining, act together without acting? Who can ascend to heaven, roam in the mists, twist and turn without end, forgetting one another in life, with no final limit?" The three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in perfect accord. They became friends.

After some time, Zisang Hu died. Before he was buried, Confucius heard of it and sent Zigong to assist with the rites. One wove a funeral mat, another played the zither, and they sang in harmony:
"Ah, Zisang Hu!
Ah, Zisang Hu!
You have returned to your true nature,
While we remain as men—alas!"

Zigong hurried forward and said, "May I ask if it is proper to sing before the corpse?"

The two looked at each other and laughed, saying, "What does he know of the meaning of ritual?"

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius, saying, "What sort of men are they? They cultivate conduct without form, treat their bodies as external, sing before the corpse without changing countenance—there is no name for them. What sort of men are they?"

Confucius said, "They roam beyond the bounds, while I roam within them. Beyond and within do not meet, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how boorish of me! They are about to join with the Creator as companions, roaming as one with heaven and earth. To them, life is an excrescent wen, death the bursting of a sore. How could they know the precedence of death and life? Borrowing from different things, lodging in the same body, they forget their livers and gallbladders, discard their ears and eyes, reversing and circling without beginning or end, wandering in confusion beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the realm of the unbounded."

The work of non-action—how could they be muddled into performing worldly rites to display before the eyes and ears of the multitude?

Zigong said, "Then upon what Way does the Master rely?"
Confucius said, "I am one of Heaven’s punished people. Yet though this be so, I share it with you."
Zigong said, "May I ask about its method?"
Confucius said, "Do fish create one another in water, or do men create one another in the Way? Water, by carving out pools, nourishes and sustains them—do they create one another? The Way, by doing nothing, gives rise to constancy. Thus it is said: Do fish forget one another in rivers and lakes? Do men forget one another in the arts of the Way?"

Zigong said, "May I ask about the extraordinary person?"
Confucius said, "The extraordinary person is extraordinary among men yet equal to Heaven. Thus it is said: Heaven’s petty man is man’s noble man; man’s noble man is Heaven’s petty man."

[To toy and tease, to trace the root—it is but play.]

Guo’s commentary:
Those who embody Heaven and Earth and guard against change—though their limbs serve different functions and their five viscera govern distinct conduits—never act in concert, yet all joints harmonize as one. This is to be in concert through non-concert. Never acting for one another, yet inner and outer both attain fulfillment—this is to act for one another through non-action. If one instead employs the mind’s intent to care for the limbs, or moves the thighs and arms to manage the viscera, the more one strives to nurture, the more inner and outer become exhausted. Thus, those who take all under Heaven as one body harbor no partial love within it. To toy and tease without limit is to be capable of all tasks. Forgetting life, one forgets all things—thus able to follow change and respond to transformation without end. Those who gaze at one another and laugh, their hearts in perfect accord, entrust clarity to the most intimate yet harbor no affectionate attachment. To weep when others weep is the mark of the conventional; to equalize life and death, forget sorrow and joy, and sing before the corpse is the aspiration of those beyond the bounds.

Those who know ritual and propriety must wander beyond to order within, guard the mother to preserve the child, and follow the promptings of their nature with straightforwardness. If one instead vaunts reputation, is bound by appearances, then filial piety cannot bear sincerity, nor kindness bear substance—father and son, elder and younger brother, harboring feelings, deceive one another. Is this the great meaning of ritual? Ritual has its ultimate extreme, where inner and outer merge—there has never been one who attained the utmost in wandering beyond yet failed to merge within, nor one who merged within yet failed to wander beyond. Thus the sage constantly wanders beyond to refine within, uses no mind to accord with things. Though all day long he moves his form, his spirit and countenance remain unchanged; though he bends and rises amid ten thousand affairs, he is serene and self-possessed.

To see the form yet not reach the spirit—this is the common burden of the world. Thus, when one sees him walking alongside the myriad things, none can say he has abandoned things and departed from men. When one observes him embodying transformation and responding to things, none can say he sits in forgetfulness and attains self-possession. How could it be only the sage who is not thus? Yet some must insist that the ultimate principle lacks this. Therefore, Zhuangzi, wishing to clarify the lineage of the flowing unity and awaken the world’s understanding, did not directly attribute such qualities to Confucius. Had he done so, some would have relied on their own views to reject it. Thus he transcended the sage’s inner traces and entrusted the realm beyond the bounds to those several masters. If one forgets what he has entrusted and seeks the great meaning of his composition, then the Way of wandering beyond to refine within lies open and clear, and Zhuangzi’s book is indeed discourse that transcends the vulgar and surpasses the age.

Offering condolences is a proximate affair of the bounded realm. Applied to those beyond the bounds, it is boorish. Those who roam as one with Heaven and Earth’s single qi are all merged in it—there is no duality. To take life as an excrescent wen—this is the temporary gathering of qi, not what they delight in. To take death as the bursting of a sore—this is the qi’s natural dispersal, not what they regret. Life and death alternate without beginning or end; going along with them, there is no going that is not acceptable. Thus they do not know where victory or defeat lies. Life and death, gathering and dispersal, transformation without direction—all are different things. Yet there is no difference that is not borrowed; what is borrowed, though different, together forms one body. Thus they forget their livers and gallbladders, discard their ears and eyes, entrust themselves to principle and merge with the flowing, forgetting even the viscera—what thing is worth recognizing? Never having begun to recognize, they release their bodies onto the path of transformation, darkly one with the waves of reversal, not knowing where beginning or end lies.

The work of non-action is not mere folded-hands silence. The realm beyond the dust and grime is not seclusion in mountains and forests. What they display before the multitude is all dust and grime—it is not the merging with things beyond the bounds. Zigong did not hear of nature and Heaven’s Way, so he saw what they relied upon but not the reason for their reliance. That upon which they rely is non-reliance—how could the world perceive this?

Those who punish the people treat the realm within the bounds as shackles—what they esteem lies beyond the bounds. Yet those who roam beyond depend on what is within, and those who depart from humanity conform to custom. Thus, those who possess the world do not take the world as their possession. Only by relinquishing things can one enter the multitude; only by sitting in forgetfulness can one respond to affairs. The more one relinquishes, the more one attains. Should one abide in this ultimate state, even if one wished to cast it aside, principle would inevitably return of itself—this is what neither heaven nor humanity can absolve.

Though my words to you are but shackles of the world, they are shared with you alone. My illumination has ever dwelt beyond. Humans and fish differ in their attainments, yet both proceed from non-affair to affair, from beyond the bounds to within, and only then are nourished and sustained in life’s constancy—none are not thus. Each is self-sufficient and mutually forgetful.

To roam beyond while darkly merging with what is within, to entrust the spontaneity of the myriad things, allowing each to fulfill its heavenly nature—this is how the Dao of emperors and kings is accomplished. Such is to stand apart from humanity yet equal heaven. In terms of spontaneity, there is no small or great among humans; in terms of human principle, those who equal heaven may be called *junzi*.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
To be with one another in non-being-with, to act for one another in non-acting—this is the place of returning to the root and recovering destiny. Ascending to heaven, one reaches the heights of great clarity; roaming in mist, one enters the gate of profound obscurity. Thus, stirring and probing without end, one finds no final exhaustion. For those who take returning to the real as joy, singing before the corpse is only fitting.

The former kings established rites to balance likes and dislikes and restore the rectitude of the human Dao. Was not taking joy in returning to the real the very intent of ritual? Roaming beyond the bounds, one becomes a companion of heaven—thus, to take death as joy is no cause for sorrow. Roaming within the bounds, one becomes a companion of humanity—thus, to take death as sorrow leaves no room for joy. If three such persons were to take death as joy, those who double death and forget life would be many. Without these three, one remains entangled between life and death, unable to untie the knot—this is what the perfected ones lament.

The aspirations of inner and outer differ, and thus they do not intersect. Confucius sent Zigong to offer condolences, wishing him to grasp the intent of ritual, which does not lie in the passions of nature and destiny, for the world’s subtlest principles are not confined within ritual and law. Roaming freely...

The qi of heaven and earth is neither yin nor yang. To take life as an excrescent growth, a hanging tumor, is to treat life as loss and indulge in it; to take death as the bursting of a tumor, the draining of an abscess, is to treat death as return and rejoice in it. Borrowing from other things, entrusting to the same body—these are not taken as real, like liver and gall, ears and eyes. When these are forgotten and abandoned, one cycles through beginning and end without knowing their bounds—how then could one be bound by the rites of the vulgar world?

Confucius, though roaming within the bounds, extolled the loftiness of those beyond. Zigong doubted that even while roaming within, his reliance might not lie there—for what one roams are traces, while what one relies upon is the heart. The "punishment of heaven" speaks of celestial penalties that cannot be undone. But Confucius embodied his nature, embraced the spirit, and roamed through the vulgar world—what reliance could burden his heart? Thus, though he roamed within the bounds, he need not go beyond; though he endured heaven’s punishment, he need not undo it.

He further drew an analogy with fish: digging a pond to provide sustenance does not require vast waters. To live without affairs and attain stillness does not require roaming beyond. To forget one another in rivers and lakes is not merely about digging ponds; to forget one another in the Dao and its arts is not merely about being without affairs. The eccentric who matches heaven does so by being external rather than internal.

The petty man of heaven is the noble man of humanity—these are they who are meticulous in ritual and law yet ignorant of the passions of nature and destiny.

Yan Hui asked Confucius, saying, "When Mengsun Cai’s mother died, he wept without tears, his heart felt no sorrow, and in mourning he showed no grief. Yet for these three absences, he was praised for his mastery of mourning—could it be that in the state of Lu there truly are those who lack the substance yet attain the name?"

Hui found this strange. Confucius replied, "Mengsun has indeed exhausted it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. He has simplified, yet cannot further simplify, for he has already simplified himself.

Mengsun does not know why he lives, does not know why he dies; does not know why to follow what comes before, does not know why to follow what comes after. If he has transformed into a thing, does he await the transformations he does not yet know? Moreover, as he is about to transform, how could he know what is not yet transformed? As he is about to remain untransformed, how could he know what has already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have never yet awakened.

Furthermore, he may take on a startling form, yet his heart suffers no harm; he may dwell in a morning abode, yet death holds no emotion. Mengsun alone is awake—others weep, and so he weeps. This is simply what is fitting for him, and nothing more. We are together in this, are we not?

How could you know what I call ‘I’? You may dream of being a bird and soaring to the heavens, or of being a fish and sinking into the abyss—how can you tell whether these words now spoken are from one awake or one still dreaming? When one attains what is fitting, laughter does not follow; when one offers laughter, it does not dispel sorrow. At ease with change, he departs—thus he enters the vast emptiness and becomes one with heaven.

Guo’s commentary: In Lu, they observed his ritual; Yan Hui examined his heart. He had fully grasped the principle of life and death, responding to inner and outer with the movement of heaven—no knowledge can match this. Thus it is said he advanced beyond knowledge. He discerned life and death yet found no difference between them, as the four seasons proceed in their course. Having simplified and found nothing to reject, he was at ease in all things. At ease in all things, he did not let life and death weigh upon his mind but entrusted himself to spontaneous transformation. Life and death, turning and turning, become one with transformation—how could he forget what he knows in the present and fret over what he does not yet know? Having transformed and come to life, he knows the time before birth; about to transform and die, he knows the time after death. Thus he avoids nothing, follows nothing, and lives in accord with transformation.

Death and life are but waking and dreaming. If one dreams and takes it for waking, there is no way to prove that waking is not dreaming. If there is no way to prove that waking is not dreaming, then there is no way to prove that life is not death. Where do death and life, waking and dreaming truly lie? In whatever one encounters, there is nothing that is not self-possessed—why grieve over this and worry over that?

‘Startling form yet heart unharmed’ means that changes in form may shock the eye, yet they do not burden the heart with life and death. ‘Morning abode yet death without emotion’ means that the body’s transformations are like a dwelling renewed each day, yet the heart does not take them as death. The ever-awake man meets nothing with resistance, so when others weep, he weeps—this is simply what is fitting for him.

Life, death, and transformation are all my own—since all are from me, what have I lost? Never having lost myself, what cause for sorrow? Without resistance, when others weep, he weeps; without sorrow, he weeps yet feels no grief. Nothing is not myself.

Thus the mysterious unites inner and outer, pervades past and present, and daily renews with transformation—how could one know where the self resides? Dreaming of being a bird, dreaming of being a fish—this shows that in all things, one is self-possessed. The transformations of waking and dreaming are boundless, so the changes of life and death are likewise nothing to regret.

Wherever one arrives is fitting, and so one forgets what is fitting. Thus one does not laugh in time; when laughter is offered, it does not dispel sorrow. Grief and joy linger in the heart, and one cannot move with what is fitting. But Mengsun was always at ease, so he wept without grief and moved with transformation. At peace with change, he departed with it—thus he entered stillness and became one with heaven.

From this point up to Zisi, their attainment is the same; only their outward mourning differs, so their songs and weeping are not alike."

Lü’s commentary: Only one who knows that things have never truly existed sees no difference between inner and outer, life and death—why must one roam beyond the world and take death as joy, even singing before the corpse? Thus, in mourning, his weeping is the same as others’, yet he is not burdened by sorrow and grief—this is how he differs from others. This is illustrated through Mengsun Cai to show that the utmost attainment does not depart from the common customs of the world.

Life is as it is, death is as it is, weeping is as it is—though one may wish to simplify, one cannot. Those three masters, though they did not know where life, death, and existence reside, took life as mourning and death as returning—this was not truly knowing why one lives or why one dies. Taking the return to the real as joy and being admired by others—this was not truly following what comes before or what comes after.

Mengsun did not know why he lived or why he died, so in life he lost nothing, and in death he returned to nothing. Not following what comes before or what comes after, death held no joy for him, and life held no cause for admiration. Not only was this so, but he transformed into a thing, awaiting the transformations he did not yet know—and even he did not know them.

As he is about to transform, how could he know what is not yet transformed? As he is about to remain untransformed, how could he know what has already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have never yet awakened.

He has a human form, so his form may startle, yet his heart is unmoved—thus it suffers no harm. Life and death are like night and day—thus he has a morning abode, yet death holds no emotion. This is why Mengsun alone is awake.

Only by knowing this does one weep when others weep, without tears or grief—this is simply what is fitting for him, and nothing to wonder at. You may now dream of being a bird or a fish, yet not know you are dreaming—how can you tell whether these words now spoken are from one awake or one dreaming? This clarifies that Mengsun had forgotten himself and alone was awake.

What is fitting is what one attains, not what one naturally possesses—thus one does not laugh in time. Laughter is what one offers, not what brings joy—thus one does not dispel sorrow in time. ‘Dispelling’ means to cast off sorrow and depart. Mengsun’s forgetting of life and death cannot be attained or offered. At ease with change, he knew it could not be resisted and followed it. Stillness is without obstruction; heaven is without attachment; oneness is without duality—the Dao is fully realized here."

Xun’s edition: "Advancing beyond knowledge" means surpassing knowledge of mourning rites. "Simplifying" means reducing. Those who study the Dao wish only to reduce their emotions, yet cannot—Mengsun had already reduced his.

"In the higher transformation, one becomes things—this refers to those already transformed. In the lower transformation, one is oneself—this refers to those not yet transformed. The transformations one does not know are those of oneself, the transformations one does not self-know are those that have reached one’s own body.

If one were to assume that those who died earlier transformed into things to await those not yet transformed whom they do not know—then how could those who are dead and about to transform know those who have not yet transformed? And how could those who are alive and about to remain untransformed know those who have already transformed?

Now, your use of *er* and *ru* (informal pronouns) corresponds to the lower *wu* (I/me). Parents are one’s kin; others may be addressed as *er* and *ru*. Mengsun merely noticed others weeping and wept along—his weeping arose not from within but from those he addressed as *er* and *ru*, treating his kin as if they were others’ kin.

From this, the term *wu* (I/me) arises below. Suppose Confucius were to say: ‘Moreover, Yan Hui and I do not compare to Mengsun, who regards his kin as others, addressing them as *wu*.’ Yet how can we be certain that what we call *wu* is truly so?

Thus, I clarify with the distinction between dream and waking: merely dreaming of becoming a fish or bird is not strange. But to dream of being a bird and flying straight to heaven, or of being a fish and diving deep into the abyss—clearly, one’s body is that fish or bird. Yet now, here in speech, how do we know this present moment is waking? Perhaps it is still a dream. From this perspective, what we call *wu* is truly unknowable.

Earlier, I said, ‘I alone am with you and have never awakened.’ Now I say, ‘Awakening may also be a dream’—this is a deeper level of attainment.

*Shi* (fitting) means contentment. Those who rejoice must laugh, but those who suddenly attain contentment harbor true joy and do not wait for laughter to feel at ease. *Xian xiao* (offering laughter) means suddenly offering one’s own laughter.

*Arranging* means disposition. Those who offer their own laughter do so unconsciously, unable to arrange it—this illustrates natural spontaneity, unconstrained by adherence to ritual and norms.

*At ease with change and departing* continues the above *pai* (arranging): life’s wealth, honor, poverty, and lowliness each have their destined allotment, like the Creator’s arrangement. One should simply accept it. Death is transformation—no more. *Liao* (stillness) conveys vast emptiness; *one* refers to the state before the Great Ultimate divided. Entering *liao*, heaven returns to its origin.

Yi’erzi saw Xu You, who asked, ‘How has Yao aided you?’

Yi’erzi replied, ‘Yao told me, “You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right and wrong.”’

Xu You said, ‘Then why have you come? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting paths?’

Yi’erzi said, ‘Though so, I wish to wander their outskirts.’

Xu You said, ‘No. The blind cannot appreciate the beauty of brows and eyes; the blind cannot appreciate the patterns of blue and yellow embroidery.’

Yi’erzi said, ‘Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor lost his knowledge—all within the crucible and hammer. How do we know the Creator will not cease branding me, mend my mutilation, and let me ride completion to follow you, Master?’

Xu You said, ‘Alas, it cannot be known! Let me speak of the general principle. My Master! My Master! He bears the myriad things yet is not righteous; his blessings reach all generations yet he is not benevolent. He is older than high antiquity yet is not aged; he covers and supports heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms yet is not skillful—this is the realm in which one wanders.

Destroying the Dao to make benevolence and righteousness is like branding; breaking the profound unity to make right and wrong is like mutilation. *Zisui* (carefree) describes the appearance of self-contentment. *Fan* (outskirts) means boundary.

*Wutongzi* (no pupil) is called *mang* (blind); *you tongzi* (having a pupil) is called *gu* (blind). *Ji* means broken.’

---

Guo’s commentary:
*Resource* means to supply and aid. *Branding with benevolence and righteousness, mutilating with right and wrong*—this speaks of self-injury through teaching by form, unable to return to the realm of self-contentment or the path without constraints.

*Wandering their outskirts* means not daring to seek the middle way, only wishing to wander near the boundary. Not all things in the world necessarily complete themselves; the principle of spontaneity sometimes requires smelting and forging to become vessels. Thus, Wu Zhuang, Ju Liang, and the Yellow Emperor all heard the Dao yet later lost what they pursued.

These are all figurative words to dispel the burdens of action. Following one’s nature directly is spontaneity. Going forth and harming one’s nature, yet able to change, is also spontaneity. How do we know that my spontaneity will not cease branding and mend mutilation, letting me ride the completed Dao to follow you, Master? To abandon and not tell you would perhaps not be the Creator’s ultimate intent.

*Ji* (bearing) the myriad things—all is thus of itself, with no love intervening. Where is benevolence and righteousness lodged? Not aged—daily renewed. Not skillful—natural. *This is the realm in which one wanders*—wandering in non-action and learning from the teacherless.

---

Lü’s commentary:
The great thoroughfare of the Dao is the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting path. Wu Zhuang was naturally beautiful yet burdened by beauty; Ju Liang relied on strength yet was burdened by strength. The Yellow Emperor fasted in mind and served in form to return to non-knowing—yet initially could not avoid using knowledge.

The crucible is for smelting, the hammer for forging. These three lost their burdens not because their natures lacked them, but because of smelting and forging. How do we know the Creator will not cease branding, mend mutilation, and let me ride the completed mind to follow the Master’s non-action?

*Ji* (bearing) the myriad things, older than high antiquity, carving and shaping all forms—this is what I wander and take as my teacher. If you wish to cease branding and mend mutilation, take this as your teacher.

Yan Hui said, ‘I have advanced.’

Zhongni asked, ‘What do you mean?’

‘I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.’

‘Good, but not yet sufficient.’

Another day, they met again.

‘I have advanced.’

‘What do you mean?’

‘I have forgotten ritual and music.’

‘Good, but not yet sufficient.’

Another day, they met again.

‘I have advanced.’

‘What do you mean?’

‘I sit in forgetfulness.’

Zhongni started and asked, ‘What is sitting in forgetfulness?’

Yan Hui said, ‘I cast off my limbs, dismiss my intelligence, leave my form, abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called sitting in forgetfulness.’

Zhongni said, ‘Merged, you have no preferences; transformed, you have no constancy. You are truly worthy! I ask to follow after you.’

---

Guo’s commentary:
*I have advanced*—taking reduction as advancement. *Benevolence* is the trace of universal love; *righteousness* is the function of completing things. Love is not benevolence; benevolence is the trace of its practice.

The completion of things is not righteousness—righteousness is but the manifestation of its function. To preserve benevolence and righteousness is insufficient to understand the source of love and benefit. Without intent, forgetting them is permissible. Yet merely forgetting their traces is still not profound attainment. Ritual is the function of the body; music is the instrument of joyful life. To forget the instrument is not as good as forgetting that which makes the instrument possible.

What does sitting in forgetfulness not forget? Having forgotten the traces, one further forgets that which produces the traces. Internally, one is no longer aware of one’s own body; externally, one no longer knows there is heaven and earth. Then, vast and unobstructed, one merges with transformation as one’s very substance, and there is nothing that is not penetrated.

When nothing is not the same, there is never not suitability. Never not suitable—how could there be preferences or aversions? To be one with transformation is to follow only what transformation suits, and thus there is no constancy.

*Detailed Explanation of the Dao:*
If you take the sea as the hundred rivers, you see the rivers but not the sea. If you gather the hundred rivers into the sea, you see the sea but not the rivers. The Dao is the sea; benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are the rivers. Yan Hui attained the Dao and forgot benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—this is seeing the sea and forgetting the rivers, yet he still had not forgotten the Dao. When one leaves form and forgets things, abandons knowledge and forgets the mind, resting serenely without entanglement, where then is the Dao? It is forgotten along with oneself—this is why Yan Hui was truly worthy.

Righteousness is close to ritual; benevolence is close to music. Thus, forgetting righteousness precedes forgetting ritual, and forgetting benevolence precedes forgetting music. Yan Hui’s forgetting still had something not forgotten, and his advancement lay in what is called "reduction." Not forgetting what should be forgotten, one returns to sincerity. Reduce again and again, until there is no reduction—without attaining the subtlety of sitting in forgetfulness, how could one reach this?

*Lü’s Commentary:*
That by which one is human has been long established. Though awakening to the Dao may occur in a single moment of speech, returning to the absence of things is not the work of a day. Yan Hui heard of fasting the mind and, before there was ever a Yan Hui, awakened to the Dao in a single word. Yet his progress through benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, and finally sitting in forgetfulness was not the accumulation of a day. To be the same is to regard things as one, and thus have no preferences. To transform is to have no end. With no constancy, one is the same as the Great Thoroughfare—this is to be one with transformation.

Ziyu and Zisang were friends. When continuous rain fell for ten days, Ziyu said, "Zisang must be in dire straits." He wrapped rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s door, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping, as Zisang plucked his zither. He sang, "Father? Mother? Heaven? Man? The voice cannot bear it!" and hurriedly recited his poem. Ziyu entered and asked, "Why do you sing your poem like this?"

Zisang said, "I pondered who brought me to this extremity but found no answer. How could my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears all without partiality. How could heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one who caused this but could not find it. Yet here I am at this extremity—it is fate!"

*Guo’s Commentary:*
These two acted for one another without acting for one another. Now, wrapping rice and going to feed him was simply following the principle of heaven and acting spontaneously—not acting for one another and then going. Why act like this? It was to avoid the appearance of sentiment, to hasten out and distance oneself from such reasoning. "It is fate"—this means all things are naturally so, without any doer.

*Lü’s Commentary:*
Zhuangzi discussed the great ancestral master, concluding with Mengsun Cai and Yan Hui, taking Confucius as one who embodied nature and held to spirit to wander through the world, and thus as the ultimate. Yet he feared that scholars might think Zisang’s followers inferior to Mengsun’s, and Ziyu’s followers inferior to Zisang’s, so he combined them for discussion. Their words all reach the point of fate and resting in it. Though the traces of these masters differ, in taking the Dao as the great ancestral master and reaching fate, they are one.

*General Observations:*
The ancestral master is what scholars uphold and revere—prefixed with "great," like saying "the father of all fathers." First, he discusses knowing heaven and knowing man, clarifying rightness and fate to establish the foundation. Then he speaks of the true person and true knowledge, who sleeps without dreaming and wakes without worry. People love their fathers and are loyal to their lords, yet still die for them—how much more so for those who are eminently true?

The value of the true lies in its reverence for the mandate, surpassing even that for a lord or father, yet the world is ignorant of this. Panting, spitting, and licking are not as good as forgetting one another in rivers and lakes. The great clod bears form, lets the old rest, and accepts death—this is the goodness of creation in shaping my form. Yet people often cling to life and fear death, so he sets forth the metaphors of hiding the boat in the ravine and hiding the mountain in the marsh to dispel their delusions. All that has form and life is bound to vanish, though ravines and marshes be deep and secure—how can they escape? Only by hiding the world within the world can one be without vanishing.

This is where the sage wanders, where transformation awaits. Born of heaven, born of earth, myriad transformations yet without beginning—why cling to the human form and secretly rejoice in it? Living in high antiquity without aging, ascending to the cloudy heavens and dwelling in the dark palace—these are the wondrous uses of the true person. The great ancestral master embodies this as the foundation, and the people and things of the world rely on it as their destiny.

Nü Yu’s "no past, no present" means life and death cannot bind him. Si Lai’s "no opposition, mutual friendship" means things and self cannot separate him. Thus, whether left in difficulty or right in ease, whether spirit horses or rump wheels, he listens to the transformation of creation and rests wherever he encounters it—this is what the ancients called "suspended release." Why trouble over insect arms or rat livers, or foolishly arouse doubts of smelting and forging?

Zifan, Qin Zhang, and Cheng sang to mourn Sang Hu, taking toil in the world as labor and friendship with the true as fortune—these wanderers beyond the world differ from the common. They roam with creation as their companion, so longevity and early death, poverty and success do not exhaust their transformations; heaven and earth, cold and heat cannot constrain their bodies.

Mengsun Cai was startled by form but unharmed in mind, dreaming of fish and birds, ascending to heaven and sinking into the abyss, at peace with momentary transformation. How could form intervene to alter his feelings? Yanzi cast off his body, dismissed his intelligence, sat in forgetfulness, and reached the ultimate—entering the cave of principle, continuing the lineage of the sage’s gate, truly the power of the master’s transformation.

As for Zisang, plucking his zither, singing and weeping, seeking the one who caused this but finding nothing, ultimately attributing it to fate—the true person, having attained the Dao, transcends fate, and worldly entanglements cannot bind him. What is called true knowledge is the thorough investigation of heaven and man, the unobstructed understanding of nature and fate without doubt.

Exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach fate is, in terms of self-cultivation, fate. Governing the transformations of things and preserving their origin is, in terms of ruling things, fate. Zisang exemplifies the former.

The command of things’ fate—is it not the great宗师 alone?

**Chapter Seven: Responding as Emperor**

Guo’s Commentary: *"To be without mind and yield to self-transformation—this is how one responds as emperor. Following this principle, this chapter expounds the application of responding as emperor. If an emperor awakens to this, he returns to the age of Grand Antiquity. Thus, the Inner Chapters conclude here."*

Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni replied that he did not know. Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Master Puyi. Master Puyi said, *"Now you have finally understood! The Lord of Yu did not equal the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed virtue to entice men—thus he gained men, yet never transcended the realm of the unhuman. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease, awoke in carefree simplicity, now took himself for a horse, now for an ox. His knowledge was sincere, his virtue utterly genuine, and he never entered the realm of the unhuman."*

Guo’s Commentary: *"The Lord of Yu and the Lord of Tai were but traces of worldly affairs, not the source of traces. The source of traces is traceless. Who in the world names it? Never having been named, what victory or defeat could there be? Thus, riding the transformations of the multitude, treading the myriad ages, the world has its level paths and perilous ones, and traces may fall short. Those who take what they love as right and what others detest as wrong—those who make right and wrong their domain—are such. One who can depart from the domain of the unhuman must enter the realm where there is no unhuman. Thus, there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong. How could it be merely concealing virtue to entice men? To be horse or ox—what right or wrong of man is there in that? Entrusting to self-knowledge, his sincerity is trusted; entrusting to self-attainment, nothing he does enters the domain of right and wrong. This is how he cuts off the age of the Lord of Yu."*

Lü’s Commentary: *"The four questions—‘Do you know what things share as right?’ ‘Do you know what you do not know?’ ‘Then are things without knowledge?’ ‘What is called knowing—is it not non-knowing? What is called non-knowing—is it not knowing?’—Wang Ni answered all with ‘I do not know.’ What things share as right is limited to what one does not know. Wang Ni’s ‘not knowing’ is true not-knowing, embodied in practice. ‘Yu’ also means ‘anxious concern,’ and ‘Tai’ means ‘great stability.’ To have knowledge and be anxious is not as good as to be without knowledge and be greatly stable. The traces of the Lord of Yu still concealed virtue to entice men, and men followed him—thus he gained men. Yet to take concealed virtue as right and approve of it is not free from taking the absence of virtue as wrong and disapproving of it. This is never to depart from the unhuman. There is man and unhuman, confused and chaotic. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease, awoke in carefree simplicity, took himself for horse or ox, and none found fault with him. Thus, his knowledge was trusted without doubt, his virtue genuine without pretense. How could he know the wrong of the unhuman and enter its realm? From Wang Ni’s perspective, it is clear that the Lord of Yu did not equal the Lord of Tai. ‘Did not equal’ refers to his traces. The Lord of Tai is the source of the Lord of Yu’s traces. To attain the source of traces, one must release the mind, free the spirit, and deeply enter the realm of Wang Ni’s ‘not knowing.’"*

Following the Source: *"The Lord of Yu harbored and concealed the Dao of virtue to entice and bind men’s hearts—thus he also gained men. Yet this still arose from human artifice, not as good as the unhuman, where one is together without being together. Thus it is said, ‘never departed from the unhuman.’ In high antiquity, the Lord of Tai rested naturally, without contrivance. Sometimes he took himself for a horse, sometimes for an ox, with no fixed name. This was because the Lord of Tai’s knowledge was truly sincere, his virtue utterly genuine, unlike the Lord of Yu, who concealed virtue to entice men. Yet this was not intentional, thus it is said, ‘never entered the unhuman.’ The phrase ‘never departed’ gives rise to ‘never entered.’"*

Jingchuan: *"This says that Shun still acted with intention. Yu arose from the human Dao, not from the Heavenly Dao. ‘Never entered the unhuman’—the Lord of Tai’s accord with the Heavenly Dao was spontaneous and uncontrived."*

Personal Insight: *"True knowledge is non-knowledge, thus it can be without non-knowledge. The Dao of emperors and kings especially requires forgetting knowledge to entrust things, letting the keen-eared listen, the clear-sighted see, the wise plan, the brave defend. I, however, sit upright and bring about governance through non-action. Is this not grand? The Dao accords with Heaven, and men return to it—this is the primary meaning of ‘responding as emperor.’"*

Jian Wu saw the madman Jie Yu. Jie Yu said, "What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?"
Jian Wu replied, "He told me that those who rule men must issue their own canons, models, principles, and measures—who would dare not listen and be transformed?"

Jie Yu said, "This is deceitful virtue. In governing the world, it is like fording the sea or dredging a river and making a mosquito carry a mountain. The governance of the sage does not proceed by rectifying others but first acts beyond rectification, then entrusts affairs to those capable of them. Moreover, birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets, and field mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape the peril of fumigation and digging. Yet you deem these two creatures devoid of knowledge!"

Guo’s Annotation: *"Deceitful virtue means imposing one’s own standards on things, causing them to lose their true nature. If one entrusts matters to the myriad things, affairs will be accomplished without effort; but if one seeks to govern the world with a single body, no task will be completed, and the burden will be unbearable. Thus, the sage’s governance consists in preserving what lies within each being’s proper sphere and rectifying their natures and lives—nothing more. They do not attempt what they cannot. Moreover, even birds and beasts each have their own means of survival. If emperors and kings entrust matters to them without interference, all will naturally come to fruition. Have you not even attained the level of these two creatures, who preserve themselves without needing instruction?"*

*Bisheng*: *"Ri Zhongshi was a man’s name. Canons, models, principles, and measures are all means to rectify others, yet they depart from inherent nature and thus are called deceitful virtue. Fording the sea will surely lead to drowning; dredging a river is difficult to accomplish; making a mosquito carry a mountain is beyond its capacity. Governing the world with deceitful virtue is no different. The sage’s governance does not proceed by rectifying others but by allowing self-governance to unfold naturally. Thus it is said, ‘acts beyond rectification and then entrusts affairs to those capable.’ They earnestly fulfill the capacities of their natures and lives—nothing more. The capacities of natures and lives mean that I practice non-action, and the people rectify themselves."*

Tian Gen wandered to the south of Yin, arriving at the banks of the Liaoshui. There he encountered the Nameless Man and asked him, "May I inquire how to govern the world?"
The Nameless Man said, "Begone, you vulgar man! Why do you ask so inopportunely? I am about to become a companion to the Creator. If I grow weary, I will ride the bird of boundless vastness to soar beyond the six directions and wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the wild expanse of open emptiness. Why do you trouble my heart with governing the world?"

He then added, "Let your mind wander in blandness, harmonize your qi with stillness, follow things as they are, and make no room for selfishness—thus the world will be governed."

Guo’s Annotation: *"To ask about governing the world is not to transcend the Great Beginning and abide in the mysterious darkness. To become a companion to the Creator is to allow things to act on their own. The ‘bird of boundless vastness’ refers to the scattered and fragmentary. Riding the fragmentary to gallop through the myriad things, one can come and go freely, roaming in the realm of self-attainment. It is not governance but self-governance. To wander the mind in blandness is to follow one’s nature without adornment. To harmonize qi with stillness is to rest in quiescence, abiding in one’s nature. To follow things without selfishness is to govern the world by allowing things to arise naturally. The mind’s desire to augment is selfishness. Selfishness is truly insufficient to generate life, while following the public preserves all."*

Lü’s Annotation: *"The Nameless Man is one who embodies the Dao. Those who embody the Dao have no preferences or aversions—here he speaks of joy and weariness as if they were the same as others’. When joyful, he becomes a companion to the Creator; when weary, he rides the bird of boundless vastness to soar beyond the six directions. Why? For such a person, existence and nonexistence lie within themselves; their comings and goings leave no trace. Who would take governing the world as their concern? Why do you trouble his heart with governing the world? To wander the mind in blandness, harmonize qi with stillness, follow things as they are, and make no room for selfishness—this is the way to govern the world without effort."*

*Bisheng*: *"‘Inopportunely’ means that if one acts with foresight in all matters, one will succeed. To act with foresight is to place oneself before governing the world, and thus one will fall behind. To become a companion to the Creator is to move with transformation without aiding it. Riding the boundless vastness to soar beyond the six directions is to traverse the void and tread the subtle, transcending yin and yang. Wandering in the land of Nothing Whatever and dwelling in the open emptiness is to reside in the realm of the Dao, the domain of empty sameness. This is the way of foresight, yet he still does not awaken to it, so he further clarifies it in plain words. To wander the mind is to be carefree and return to utmost stillness. Thus it is said, ‘wander the mind in blandness.’ To harmonize qi is to breathe deeply and return to utmost emptiness. Thus it is said, ‘harmonize qi with stillness.’ These are all to follow things as they are without imposing oneself upon them. Thus the world is governed. Indeed, to have no intention of governing the world yet to embody the way of governing the world—nothing is more wondrous than this."*

Yang Ziju saw Lao Dan and said, "Here is a man who responds swiftly, is strong and resolute, sees through things, and studies the Dao tirelessly. Can such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"
Lao Dan said, "In the eyes of the sage, such a man is like a petty functionary, bound by skill, ensnared by technique, laboring his body and startling his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters, the agility of monkeys and apes leads to their capture, and the leaping of raccoon dogs brings them to the leash. Can such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"

Yang Ziju, startled, said, "May I ask about the governance of an enlightened king?"
Lao Dan said, "The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the myriad things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, and things delight in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in Nothingness."

Guo’s Annotation: *"Bound by skill, ensnared by technique, laboring the body and startling the mind—such efforts cannot secure one’s place, let alone compare to a sage-king. Tigers, leopards, monkeys, and raccoon dogs are all ensnared by their patterns and skills, not riding the void to master the boundless. If the world had no enlightened king, none could attain self-attainment. To cause self-attainment is truly the work of an enlightened king. Yet this work lies in non-action, returning the task to the world. When the world all attains self-mastery, it seems not the work of the enlightened king. The enlightened king fulfills the natures of things, so each person says, ‘I am thus of myself,’ without knowing they rely on the enlightened king. Though his achievements cover the world, he does not claim them as his own. Thus, things all believe they have attained themselves and rejoice. To stand in the unfathomable is to dwell in the path of transformation, daily renewing without fixed direction. To wander in Nothingness is to be one body with the myriad things, so what one wanders in is emptiness. If one cannot merge with things, one will be at odds with them and have no leisure to wander in emptiness."*

The Lü commentary states: Those who hasten toward affairs with urgency act with brute force, not overcoming things through softness. Those who penetrate all things do so not through knowing, but by guarding against knowledge—yet this is not the source of true clarity. One who studies the Dao without weariness has not yet reached the point of daily diminution to embody the Dao. To possess some skill is to labor the body; to bind the mind to some attachment is to startle the heart. This is like the mutual exchange of artisans, measuring short and long, having and lacking—it is not how the sage employs the world.

When tigers, leopards, apes, and hounds are lured into the hunt, each is taken by some means. Thus, those who labor the body and startle the heart to be employed by the world have brought it upon themselves through brute force and superficial clarity.

To borrow is to say that skill and strength are borrowed by others. If one does not dwell in power and does not rely on transformative generosity, then even those who possess something cannot claim it as their own, allowing things to rejoice of themselves. The reason for this lies in standing in the unfathomable and wandering in Nothingness.

Xun Ben’s notes: *Xū* means convicts; *yì* means to lead. Skill binds one through artifice. Convicts and laborers labor the body; those bound by skill and artifice startle the heart.

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of people, predicting them by year, month, ten-day period, or day as if by spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. When Liezi saw him, he was enchanted. Returning home, he told Master Húzi: "At first, I thought your Dao was the ultimate—yet there is something even more ultimate."

Master Húzi said: "You and I have grasped its patterns but not yet its reality—how could we truly have attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? Yet you take this Dao and contend with the world, and so you are deemed trustworthy. Thus others can divine your fate. Come, bring him here and let me show myself to him."

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Húzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. It will not be ten days before he perishes. I saw something strange in him: he was like damp ashes."

Liezi entered and wept, tears soaking his lapels, then told Master Húzi. Húzi said: "Just now, I showed him the earthly pattern, latent and still. Neither trembling nor upright, he likely saw me with my virtue’s mechanism sealed. Bring him again."

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Húzi once more. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "Fortunate that your master met me! He is recovering, fully alive. I saw his sealed mechanism shift."

Liezi entered and told Master Húzi. Húzi said: "Just now, I showed him heaven and earth. Name and reality did not enter, yet the mechanism arose from his heels—he likely saw my mechanism of goodness. Bring him again."

The next day, Liezi once more brought Ji Xian to see Master Húzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "Your master is unsettled. I cannot divine him. Let him settle, and I will divine him again."

Liezi entered and told Master Húzi. Húzi said: "Just now, I showed him the Great Thoroughfare where nothing prevails. He likely saw my mechanism of balanced qi. The deep pool where the *ní* fish coils, the deep pool of still water, the deep pool of flowing water—each pool has nine names, and here I showed him three."

The next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to see Master Húzi. Before Húzi could steady himself, Ji Xian lost his composure and fled. Húzi said: "Pursue him!" Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Húzi: "He has vanished, disappeared—I could not reach him."

Húzi said: "Just now, I showed him what had never yet emerged from my source. I met him with emptiness, drifting and yielding, not knowing who or what he was. He took me for a withered vine, for drifting waves—thus he fled. Only then did Liezi realize he had never yet begun to learn. He returned home and for three years did not go out. He cooked for his wife, fed the pigs as if feeding people, and in all affairs remained unattached. He cast off carving and returned to simplicity, standing alone like an unworked clod. Amidst the tumult, he remained sealed—thus he ended."

The one who lingers is Huán Pánhuán—examining the resonance, he circles within the flowing domain where sound gathers. Sima Biao says it should read "coiling and gathering." The character *dì* follows *rén* and *diào*, pronounced *tuí*, written as 䍺—incorrect.

Guo’s commentary: He fled in dismay, unwilling to hear of his own death. "No male, how eggs?"—this speaks of Liezi’s failure to embrace the Dao. Without embracing the Dao, one has a heart; with a heart, one exalts one direction and clings to worldly certainty, thus becoming predictable. Motionless like a withered root, neither correcting nor flourishing, damp ash merging with lifelessness—this is the moment when the perfected person is without response. The perfected person’s movement is like heaven, their stillness like earth, their going like flowing water, their cessation like a deep abyss. The abyss’s silence and water’s flow, heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness—these are one in non-doing, naturally so.

Now, when Jì Xián saw him sitting as if a corpse, forgetting all, he called him near death; when he saw his spirit move and heaven follow, he called him alive. If one can respond without mind, principle naturally aligns with the mysterious tally, ascending and descending with the world as measure—only then can one master things and follow time without limit, beyond the diviner’s reckoning. This is the great meaning of "Responding to Emperors and Kings."

The virtue-mechanism untriggered is called "blocked power"—yet it is still a mechanism. Now, having realized yesterday’s vision saw only the blocked mechanism, he called it near death. Yet within heaven and earth, the work of covering and bearing is manifest—compared to earth’s pattern, is this not still external? This is the appearance of responsive resonance. Entrusting to naturalness, covering and bearing, the heavenly mechanism mysteriously responds, and the adornments of profit and fame become discarded things. The mechanism arises from the heel, ever originating at the utmost height. When it emerges and excels in another, that one perceives it. Abiding at the great harmony’s utmost, vast and serene, the heart merges with the mysterious and unites with the ten thousand directions—thus victory and defeat cannot find place between them. Without going, all is level; blending into oneness, even gazing through a tube at heaven, one cannot see its bounds—hence it seems uneven.

The abyss means still silence. Water, ever without mind, submits to external things—whether flowing or halting, whether the *ní* fish coils or the dragon leaps, it remains profoundly serene, never losing its still silence. The perfected person’s use and disuse differ, yet their mysterious silence is one. Thus, briefly presenting three differences to clarify: though waves flow and nine transformations arise, order and chaos swirl—abiding at the utmost, one remains blandly content, drifting in forgetfulness of action.

"Never yet emerged from my source" means that though transformations are endless, the deep root remains firmly settled. "Drifting and yielding" means without mind, following things’ transformations. "Not knowing who or what" means floating without attachment. Transforming and declining, worldly affairs flowing—there is nowhere it does not follow. The perfected person is one, yet responds to worldly changes and moves with the times—thus the diviner cannot fix his gaze, loses himself, and flees. This clarifies that "responding to emperors and kings" is without fixed method.

Feeding pigs as if feeding people—he forgot nobility and baseness. In affairs, he had no partiality, only what he encountered. Carving discarded, simplicity restored—he cast off ornament and took up reality. Standing alone like an unworked clod—external adornment gone. Though tumultuous, he remained sealed—thus he ended, allowing things to each complete themselves.

Lü’s commentary: As for its pattern, it is not yet exhausted; as for its reality, it is the place of unknowing. The Dao has never yet had things; emptiness, formlessness—nothing matches it. Like a flock of hens without a rooster, I do not respond to things, yet there is something stored in my breast—like eggs without a male. Thus, when the Dao clashes with the world and insists on certainty, it allows others to divine it. Earth shares the same power as yin—none can perceive it; showing earth’s pattern, it becomes perceptible. Without shock, there is no movement; without correction, no stillness. The mechanism is the barrier to movement.

At first, seeing damp ash, he thought it death, not knowing it was blocked. Only when there was life did he realize what he had seen before was blocked power, not the true. Heaven shares the same wave as yang—none can perceive it; showing heaven and earth, it becomes perceptible. When name and reality do not enter, there is non-doing; the mechanism arises from the heel, thus it is shown. Earth is where things naturally grow; the heel is where breath naturally arises—thus knowing it has life and excels is the mechanism.

Earth’s measure is yin overcoming yang; heaven and earth is yang overcoming yin. The great harmony overcomes nothing, yet is not one—thus it seems uneven. Overcoming nothing is equipoise—hence it is called balanced qi and mechanism. The meaning of the three abysses is to compare the heart: though good abysses flow or halt, whether the *ní* fish coils or the dragon leaps, they never cease to be abyssal. The great harmony overcoming nothing is likewise.

When "never yet emerged from my source," it is hidden in heaven, shown as nothing to show—thus he cannot perceive it, loses himself, and flees. Jì Xián divined others’ hearts with his heart; when I am without heart, what he uses to divine also cannot stand alone—thus it vanishes and cannot be regained. Empty and drifting, not knowing who or what—this is non-doing, non-action, its stillness. Taking it for decline—none know it is decline. Its movement—taking it for flowing waves—none know it is flow. Seeking me between movement and stillness, both are unattainable—this is why he fled.

Feeding pigs as if feeding people—he forgot the self. In affairs, no partiality—reaching the utmost emptiness. Carving discarded, simplicity restored; standing alone like an unworked clod; though tumultuous, remaining sealed—thus he ended. Though the ten thousand things stir, my seal remains unchanged.

Following the text: "No male, how eggs?"—as the *Cantong Qi* says, "A hen alone cannot lay eggs." This speaks of how if the dog leans toward one side, it cannot complete the Dao—an analogy for Liezi’s failure to fulfill reality. "Earth’s pattern" refers to mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees. Grasses and trees sprout, tranquil and still, showing no movement; each corrects its nature and life without human effort. One only senses the great earth’s silence—this is the meaning of the *Duren Jing*: "Divine wind still and silent, mountains and seas concealed in clouds. Heaven without floating haze, the four qi bright and clear. A kingdom’s earth, mountains, rivers, forests—all level, no longer high or low." This is the so-called "blocked virtue-mechanism"—blocked, closed, hidden, and unseen.

"Blocked power" is within closure, yet there is adaptability—slightly different from what was seen yesterday. "Blocked power" and "blocked virtue" are opposites. "Heaven’s rarity" refers to heaven’s twelve branches—like saying heaven’s earth. The term "heaven and earth" also opposes "earth’s pattern." Earth governs stillness, heaven governs movement—calling it "heaven" already implies movement. Showing "heaven and earth" means externally, name and reality cannot enter the heart; internally, the mechanism arises from the deepest place. Jì Xián saw only the good beginnings of my mechanism’s emergence.

Still, there remains what is not fully understood. "Great Thoroughfare" is akin to "Great Harmony." The Great Thoroughfare resides between the blocked virtue-mechanism and the mechanism of the good—none surpasses this, hence it is called the "Great Thoroughfare, unsurpassed in balance."

The "balanced qi-mechanism" dwells between earth’s pattern and heaven’s earth, where movement and stillness are evenly divided, achieving equilibrium. The term "balance" further contrasts with the earlier "adaptability." To show the "Great Thoroughfare, unsurpassed" is precisely to demonstrate the balanced qi-mechanism.

"Níhuán" refers to where the salamander lingers. "Shěn" should be read as "settled rice-water"—where water forms a deep pool, bubbles like rice-water froth float upon its surface. In a flowing stream that becomes a deep pool, the surface may flow while the depths remain still. Where the salamander lingers, where still water gathers—where the surface flows yet the depths accumulate—all are called "deep pools." The *Liezi* lists nine names for deep pools; here, only three are mentioned, and the discussion remains incomplete.

The deep pool of still water serves as an analogy for earth’s pattern and the blocked virtue-mechanism—utterly unmoving. The deep pool where the salamander lingers serves as an analogy for heaven’s earth and the mechanism of the good: though the deep water is still, the salamander moves within it, suggesting stillness with the potential for movement. The deep pool of flowing water serves as an analogy for the Great Thoroughfare, unsurpassed in balanced qi-mechanism—half the water flows above, half remains still below, with flow and stillness evenly divided, thus perfectly embodying balance. This is the metaphor for the Great Thoroughfare and balanced qi, never departing from our school—our school being what is called the "Great Master."

Lǐ Shìbiǎo notes: Jì Xián, by using his own heart to influence others’ hearts, his own perceptions to influence others’ perceptions, gives rise to the delusive names of fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death.

Names being already delusive, they further delude through speech. Those in the world bound by appearances, unable to guard against delusion, further delude themselves by accepting them as true—hence their flight in panic. As for the perfected person, they tread form beyond the formless, transcend calculation before the uncalculable—how could they be fathomed by appearances? Thus, first they showed the pattern of earth to raise doubt of death, then the expanse of heaven to raise doubt of life, unaware that the birth and death of form are but the arising and ceasing of the heart-mind, and the arising and ceasing of the heart-mind are but the presence and absence of perception. Master Hu never possessed a heart-mind: in stillness, his virtue harmonized with yin; in movement, his waves aligned with yang. In equilibrium, he stood at the center of yin and yang, unsurpassed in the balance of heaven and earth. The myriad dharmas are of one essence, fundamentally without high or low—it is only that perceptions differ, giving rise to the illusion of disparity.

These three were called "mechanisms" because their potential for movement could be perceived. Yet before they ever departed from our school, they were shown the absence of any show—where the other offered solidity, this one remained empty; where the other received with presence, this one responded with absence. The other’s heart-mind and enslaved perceptions were finite, while this one’s departure from the human and entry into the celestial were infinite—hence their self-loss and flight. Master Hu said: "When he saw my three mechanisms, he still stood apart, confronting me with emptiness and compliance, unaware of who or what I was—thus I, too, forgot myself. Who was it that showed? Who was it that saw?"

Zhuangzi, in discussing the response of emperors and kings, speaks of this: the response of emperors and kings to the world arises from utter stillness and non-movement, thus their resonance is effortlessly penetrating. Only by retiring and concealing within the profound can fortune and misfortune be held as one. Once one emerges from this school to take the world as their affair, others can indeed fathom them by appearances. This is why the emperors and kings of old were so vast and unobstructed.

The people could not name them—this is how. Wang Dan [said]: "In ancient times, the emperors and kings who governed the world necessarily possessed unfathomable applications, making it impossible for others to fathom them by appearances. Confucius said: 'The noble person has three transformations: from afar, they appear solemn; when approached, they become gentle; when their words are heard, they turn stern.' How could one grasp them by a single aspect? Yao was one and the same, yet approaching him was like the sun, gazing upon him like clouds—his benevolence was like heaven, his wisdom like a spirit. With such manifold transformations, when the sage emerges to govern the world, making it impossible for others to fathom them by appearances, is this not indeed the Dao of seizing and employing the world?"

*Bicheng* [notes]: "Not shaken, not upright" in Cui's version reads "not shaken, not still"; in the *Liezi*, it is "ashen, inscrutable." "No one to befriend" in the *Liezi* reads "no kinship." "Sealed, alas!" in the *Liezi* reads "sealed, martial"—this seems superior in meaning and should be followed.

Be not the master of names, be not the repository of schemes, be not the bearer of tasks, be not the lord of knowledge. Roam boundlessly and wander without trace, exhausting what is received from heaven without displaying attainment—this is emptiness alone. The mind of the perfected person is like a mirror: it neither advances nor retreats, responds without storing, and thus can master things without harm.

[Annotations: *Shi* means "master"; *fu* means "repository."]

Guo's commentary: "Be not the master of names—let things each accord with their own names. Be not the repository of schemes—let things each scheme for themselves. Be not the bearer of tasks—entrust things to each bear their own. Be not the lord of knowledge—without intent, let things each master their own knowledge. Roam boundlessly—follow the self-so of the world, thus galloping through the ten thousand things without end. Wander without trace—entrust things to their own course, thus leaving no mark. Exhaust what is received from heaven—sufficiency halts. Display no attainment—displaying attainment means not knowing when to stop. This is emptiness alone—without emptiness, one cannot bear the multitude of realities. Like a mirror—it reflects things without emotion. Neither advancing nor retreating, neither storing—it responds to what comes and ceases when it goes. Things come and are reflected; reflection is not of the mind, thus even with the vastness of the world, there is no burden of spirit-labor."

Lü's commentary: "Be not the master of names—then I have no name, and the world cannot name me. Be not the repository of schemes—then I do not scheme, and the world schemes for me. Be not the bearer of tasks—then I do nothing, and those who bear tasks take responsibility. Be not the lord of knowledge—then I have no concerns, and the world thinks for me. Roam boundlessly—this is the utmost of vastness. Wander without trace—then even spirits cannot perceive, let alone people. Being thus, exhaust what is received from heaven without displaying attainment—this is what is meant by 'constantly following nature and not augmenting life.' As for emptiness, is it emptiness only after being made empty? My mind is originally empty. Its mind is like a mirror: not advancing means the past leaves no residue; not retreating means the future is not anticipated; responding without storing means past and present cannot be exhausted. Exhausting what is received from heaven is like this—thus one masters things without harm."

The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Realm was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s kindness, saying: "All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one lacks them. Let us try to bore them." Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.

[Shu symbolizes form, Hu symbolizes formlessness; Hundun, undifferentiated clarity and turbidity, symbolizes the natural. Jianwen said: "Shu and Hu take their names from swiftness, metaphorizing the artificial. Hundun, with its harmonious appearance, metaphorizes the effortless."]

Guo’s Annotation: ["To act is to ruin it."]

Lü’s Annotation: ["The Southern Yang symbolizes sudden existence; the Northern Yin symbolizes sudden nonexistence. The Central Realm, neither existing nor nonexisting, is thus their meeting place. Though Shu and Hu differ from Hundun, Hundun has never differed from them—hence it is said he treated them very well. Knowing his goodness, they plotted to repay it, so that what served for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing was daily chiseled to communicate with things. Yet to preserve his uncarved simplicity was no longer possible."]

General Observations on the *Inner Chapters*:
The ancients who responded to emperors and kings did so through nonaction, and the myriad things transformed; through desirelessness, and the world was sufficient; through profound stillness, and the hundred clans were settled. Thus *Nanhua* begins this chapter with Nie Que’s question to Wang Ni, using Youyu as a metaphor for excessive deliberation and Tai Shi as a metaphor for nonaction—nonaction being sufficient to match Heaven. This is what emperors and kings should respond to.

Yet those who impose their own standards, models, and measures to transform the people of the world differ not from hunters who use nets, arrows, smoke, and digging to catch birds and rodents—only hastening their flight to lofty heights or deep burrows. For where there is action, there is intent; where there is intent, schemes arise and deceit is born. Even the natural bond between father and son cannot be secured, and in the relationship between ruler and people, can one hope for the mutual forgetting of wild deer and their pursuers? Thus when Tian Gen asked about governing the world, the answer was to still the mind and empty the qi, following things without self-interest. When Zi Ju asked about the rule of an enlightened king, the answer was to forget merit, be kind in bestowing, and let things rejoice of themselves—all ways of responding to emperors and kings by taking nonaction as the principle.

Zheng had a divine diviner who knew men’s life and death, just as a strategist observes the times and politics to predict a state’s rise and fall. Yet schemes and arts do not surpass human artifice, which is why their use is finite. But for a master of nonaction, how can schemes be measured or arts be fathomed?

The chapter concludes with the two emperors of South and North meeting in the Central Realm, speaking of the Dao dispersing into things, separating from nonbeing into being, now reuniting as one—this is not wrong. Yet where there is one, there is dispersion, which prompted Shu and Hu’s chiseling. Better to forget each other without intent and mutually transform.

*General Observations on the Inner Chapters*:
The *Nanhua* Classic—its words surge and roar, howl and soar, towering above all other masters, seemingly beyond the reach of rules and measures. Yet the profundity of its *Inner Chapters* exhausts the spirit and transcends transformation, threading Heaven and humanity together in a hidden yet rigorous order, comparable to the *Yijing* and *Laozi*. Beginning with the *Free and Easy Wandering* and ending with *Responding to Emperors and Kings*, the essentials of learning the Dao lie in returning to seek within oneself. There is no place that is not joy, and thus one observes the principles of the myriad things—all are equalized. When things are equalized, the self can be forgotten; when the self is forgotten, the master of nurturing life is attained.

Nurturing life is to perfect oneself; responding to the world is to perfect things—both depend on virtue to fill them. When filled, the myriad things accord, and the ancestral teaching is established as the Great Ancestral Master. Applied to the Way of governance, what difficulty remains? Within, one becomes sagely and divine; without, one responds to emperors and kings. This is how the Dao gathers into one body without excess and scatters across the world without insufficiency.

The true person’s attainment is found within these seven chapters yet not confined to them; it departs from them yet harmonizes with them. Thus outwardly, one blends with the dust and light; inwardly, one preserves luminous awareness. The diligent student who seeks within the *Inner Chapters* will grasp more than half the truth.

*Outer Chapters*: "Webbed Toes" (Chapter Eight)

Webbed toes emerge from nature yet exceed virtue; superfluous growths and hanging warts arise from form yet exceed nature. The manifold applications of benevolence and righteousness, though arrayed among the five viscera, do not align with the true standard of Dao and virtue. Thus, toes fused together are but useless flesh conjoined; fingers sprouting branches are but superfluous digits grown. The manifold excesses that branch from the passions of the five viscera lead to perverse indulgence in acts of benevolence and righteousness, and to overreaching in the use of one’s faculties.

[Webbed toes: the big toe fused to the second toe. Branched fingers: a hand bearing six digits. *Fu zhui* (attached excrescence): flesh that clings to form, hence “attached growth.” *Xuan you* (hanging wart): a swelling or lump suspended from form, hence “hanging growth.” *Duo fang* (manifold): many-sided. Arrayed among the five viscera: as in the liver-spirit embodying benevolence and the lung-spirit embodying righteousness. *Duo fang* branching from the passions of benevolence and righteousness: the phrase “duo fang” here may be superfluous. *Duo fang* in the use of faculties: the word “fang” may also be superfluous, as evidenced by the later reference to “excess in faculties.”]

Guo Xiang’s Commentary:
That which is long is not in excess, nor is that which is short insufficient—thus webbed growths and superfluous excrescences all arise from form and nature, not from external things. Whether webbed or not, each nature is self-sufficient; only these particular cases of fusion and branching are deemed excessive by the multitude, hence called “superfluous.” Yet the deluded claim these are not of nature and, driven by desire, seek to cut and discard them. Such an approach would leave the Dao incomplete, virtue unfulfilled, people deprived of their talents, and things stripped of their uses—how could this reflect the intent of perfect governance?

All things, great or small, possess varying capacities; what is fused or superfluous in one may be essential in another. The distinction between fusion and superfluity exists in all things. To reject what one cannot employ is to discard the natures of the myriad things wholesale. Only one who merges with things remains free of excess.

Thus, those who multiply applications of benevolence and righteousness, though arrayed among the five viscera, adhere only to the standard of their own school and cannot align with things without partiality or allow each to rectify its own nature. Hence, they are said not to conform to the true standard of Dao and virtue. While the degrees of more or less in the world are not fixed, the difference between them has its own definite measure. Even the slightest deviation cannot be forced to match, so each must abide by its own measure, and then more or less will naturally find its place. Some, hearing that excess cannot rectify deficiency, seek to discard the many and employ the few—this is to cast aside the entire world, is it not absurd?

Therefore, webbed toes or branched fingers arise simply because one’s nature and destiny cannot be otherwise; they are not so because they are useful. The passions of the five viscera are inherently manifold, yet those with fewer faculties forcibly emulate those with more, leading to perverse indulgence and the loss of perfect harmony within the body. The use of one’s faculties has its own proper measure, so excess does not constitute surplus, nor does deficiency constitute lack. Yet the sway of emotions and desires invariably devalues the few and esteems the many. Seeing what is esteemed, one forcibly emulates it, thereby exceeding one’s original capacity and straining one’s natural endowment. If, however, one forgets what is esteemed and reverts to one’s inherent measure, then nothing is excessive in nature, and all differences are preserved in full.

Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:
Webbed toes and branched fingers do indeed emerge from nature, yet virtue has no place for them.

Webbed growths and pendulous warts do indeed emerge from form, yet nature has no place for them. That which arises where nature has no part—this is what constitutes excess in qi. As the five phases manifest their virtue as the five constants, their affairs as the five affairs, and their forms as the five viscera, they become manifold. Those who employ benevolence and righteousness are not absent from the five viscera, yet if they do not align with the true standard of Dao and virtue, they too are but what nature has no place for. Thus, webbed toes and branched fingers are all without use, and what is called the true standard of Dao and virtue lies solely in non-action that returns to unity.

Cui Zhuan’s Commentary:
Webbed fingers and pendulous growths, though not the norm of nature, arise from form and cannot be removed. The dispositions of the five viscera, though not the norm of Dao and virtue, emerge from nature and cannot be governed. Now, to impose the teachings of benevolence and righteousness to govern the dispositions of the five viscera is like cutting away webbed fingers and pendulous growths—it injures the principle of nature and only exacerbates the affliction.

Thus, those whose vision is webbed confuse the five colors, indulging in ornate patterns—azure and yellow, embroidered and variegated—are they not resplendent? Yet Li Zhu is such a one. Those whose hearing is webbed confuse the five tones, indulging in the six pitch-pipes—metal and stone, silk and bamboo, the grand sounds of *huangzhong* and *dalü*—are they not sonorous? Yet Shi Kuang is such a one. Those whose benevolence is branched pluck at virtue and obstruct nature to gather fame, causing the world to clamor in praise of unattainable standards—are they not so? Yet Zeng and Shi are such. Those whose eloquence is webbed pile tiles and knot cords, crafting phrases and roaming the mind amid the debates of "hard and white" and "same and different," exhausting themselves in useless words of fleeting renown—are they not so? Yet Yang and Mo are such. Thus, all these are the ways of excess, webbed growths, and branching offshoots—they are not the ultimate standard of the world. That which is truly standard does not lose the genuine dispositions of nature and life. Therefore, what is conjoined is not called webbed, what is branched is not called overreaching; what is long is not called excessive, and what is short is not called deficient. Thus, though the legs of the wild duck are short, to lengthen them brings sorrow; though the legs of the crane are long, to shorten them brings grief. What is long by nature cannot be cut, and what is short by nature cannot be extended—there is no cause for sorrow in this.

*(Li Zhu was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time; Mencius wrote of him as Li Lou, who could see the tip of an autumn hair at a hundred paces. "Plucking virtue" means selecting and displaying fine reputations. "Obstructing nature" means blocking the natural spontaneity of one’s nature. Zeng and Shi refer to Zeng Shen and Shi Yu.)*

Stacking tiles and knotting cords—such words gather useless speech, like tiles piled one upon another, like cords tied in knots. "Fleeing" means to embellish, to expand one’s phrases. "Worn" means exhaustion. "Half-step" is a single stride. The toil of the eloquent is like that of an exhausted man taking half-steps.

*(Guo’s commentary: Those with ears and eyes have never troubled themselves by admiring deafness or blindness. What truly troubles them lies in yearning for Li Lou or admiring Kuang—yet though Li and Kuang are keen by nature, such admiration disorders the mastery of ears and eyes. Zeng and Shi were long in benevolence by nature, but those not long in it forcibly emulate them; in emulating them, their benevolence becomes mere pretense. The world never admired Jie or Zhi, yet it must admire Zeng and Shi—thus Zeng and Shi’s allure drums the world into losing its true nature, more grievously than Jie or Zhi. Those who gallop in strange arguments and deliver perilous words have never paused to consider the jaws of Taowu, yet they must vie in debate between Yang and Mo—thus Yang and Mo become the masters who disorder the multitude of words. These several masters each follow their own nature, each boasting many conjoined and branching paths, each claiming their own school’s orthodoxy. Yet if one orthodoxy is used to correct the myriad, the myriad cannot be corrected. Therefore, the utmost orthodoxy does not use one’s own correctness to govern the world, but lets the world each attain its own correctness—only when things each follow their nature is there true orthodoxy. Viewed from this point onward, the utmost orthodoxy becomes clear. Using branches to correct the whole is called "whole" as conjoined; using the whole to correct branches is called "branches" as overreaching. Using shortness to correct length is called "length" as excessive; using length to correct shortness is called "shortness" as deficient. Each has its own correctness; one cannot use this to correct that, nor diminish or augment it. Knowing the allotment of one’s nature—what cannot be cut or extended—and following it, there is nowhere to cast off sorrow, and sorrow departs of itself.)*

*(Lü’s commentary: The enlightened are said to see for themselves. Now, taking what they see as enlightenment is to unite self-seeing with what is seen, thus conjoining them.)*

The perceptive are said to hear for themselves, yet when tones, rhythms, strings, and bamboo instruments all lie outside, this is but augmentation and excess. Thus, what the Dao issues forth follows the spontaneous flow of one’s nature, and the world is all-sufficient in itself—nothing is in surplus. To exalt virtue is to force growth; to obstruct one’s nature is to stifle what gives it life. Only when one acts excessively to garner fame and reputation does the world join in chorus to uphold laws that fall short—this is how Zengzi and Shishu became branches of benevolence.

The Dao resides in non-speech; disputation is not the Dao. Piling tiles values their accumulation; knotting cords values their straightness. The purpose of punctuation is to clarify reading, yet the mind that hides and hoards treasures the fullness that roams between the firm and the white, the same and the different. To exhaust one’s conduct and stand on tiptoe to expound useless words—like piling tiles and knotting cords—this is how Yangzi and Mozi became conjoined in disputation.

None of these are the utmost orthodoxy of the world. That utmost orthodoxy does not lose the true condition of one’s nature and life—it is non-action, spontaneity, without addition or diminution.

*Bi Sheng’s note: "Piled tiles" should read "piled pellets"; "hidden punctuation" should read "hidden self"; "tiptoe praise" should read "praise and blame"; "orthodox orthodoxy" should read "utmost orthodoxy"; "not for overreaching" should read "not for divergence." With these corrections, the principle flows smoothly, the text follows naturally, and no forced interpretation is needed. These are likely errors in transmission.*

Are benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature? Why, then, are those benevolent ones so full of sorrow?

Moreover, those with conjoined toes—severing them brings weeping; those with extra fingers—biting them off brings wailing. Whether one has surplus in number or deficiency in number, their sorrow is the same.

The benevolent of this age crane their eyes in distress over the world’s calamities, while the unbenevolent sever the true condition of their nature and life to glut themselves on wealth and nobility. Thus, are benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature? From the Three Dynasties onward, why has the world been so clamorous?

Now, those who rely on hooks, marking-lines, compasses, and squares to achieve correctness—this is carving away their nature. Those who depend on cords, glue, and lacquer to achieve solidity—this is encroaching upon their virtue. Bending and twisting rites and music, sighing and coaxing with benevolence and righteousness to console the world’s hearts—this is losing their constant spontaneity.

The world has its constant spontaneity: the crooked do not rely on hooks to become straight; the straight do not rely on marking-lines; the round do not rely on compasses; the square do not rely on squares; the joined do not rely on glue and lacquer; the bound do not rely on ropes and cords. Thus, the world is naturally so, all living yet unaware of why they live, all attaining yet unaware of why they attain. From ancient times to the present, this has never changed—it cannot be diminished.

Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling so tenaciously, like glue, lacquer, ropes, and cords, wandering between the Dao and virtue? They only serve to confuse the world.

Those with minor delusions lose their bearings; those with great delusions lose their nature. How do we know this is so? Ever since the House of Yu elevated benevolence and righteousness to disturb the world, the world has rushed to answer the call of benevolence and righteousness—is this not using benevolence and righteousness to alter their nature? Twisting limbs into ritual postures, contorting faces into expressions of benevolence and righteousness—these are but ropes and cords, means of disturbance and disorder.

Guo’s commentary: Benevolence and righteousness are inherently part of human nature; one should simply let them be. To fear that benevolence and righteousness are not of human nature and thus fret over them—this is truly what it means to be "full of worries." Those with fused toes are deemed deficient, so they weep as they split them; those with extra fingers are deemed excessive, so they wail as they bite them off. If one acts thus toward all things in their myriad differences, there will be no end to worry. Only by each resting in their natural endowment—without splitting fused toes or biting off extra fingers—can things curve to their completion without harm. What worry is there then? If the traces of universal love are deemed admirable, the eyes of the world will be confounded. To deem such admirable traces a cause for concern and thus fret over them is like preventing harm only after it has occurred. Yet in this age, this is precisely what is called "benevolence." Wealth and honor become objects of greed only because there are those who elevate them. If there were no such admirable traces, people would rest content in their lot, taking on tasks according to their capacity. How could they split themselves open to emulate others, coveting what is not theirs? Thus, benevolence and righteousness are indeed part of human nature. Yet since the Three Dynasties, people have clamored noisily, abandoning their true nature to chase after traces, as if they could not keep up—is this not being "full of worries"?

Things have their constant spontaneity; when left to themselves without interference, they merge naturally and attain fulfillment without self-awareness. Being of the same substance as all things, they remain undivided and constantly whole. Following the Dao and attaining spontaneity, they embrace simplicity and walk alone, ceaselessly borrowing from things without acting between them. Yet benevolence and righteousness, clinging tenaciously, only serve to delude things and make them lose their authenticity. To mistake east for west is to lose one’s bearings without harming the body; to uphold benevolence and exalt righteousness, losing one’s constant spontaneity and driving oneself to death—this is great delusion. Not harming things is not the same as practicing benevolence, yet the traces of benevolence appear. Making all principles accord is not the same as practicing righteousness, yet the achievements of righteousness manifest. Thus, when things accord without harm, it is not the summons of benevolence and righteousness. Yet the world rushes about, abandoning the self to pursue the other, thereby losing its constant spontaneity. The heart is not disturbed by the ugly but by constant beauty; the world is not disordered by evil but by constant benevolence and righteousness. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the tools that disturb the world. Though the House of Yu had no intention of altering human nature, the world’s nature was fundamentally changed.

Lü’s commentary: Benevolence and righteousness reside among the five viscera—how could they not be part of human nature? Only when they are pursued to excess and not guided by the Dao and virtue’s true standard do they seem contrary to human nature. Those "benevolent" people who are full of worries are precisely those who pursue them to excess. Extra or fused fingers on hands and feet may be excessive or deficient in number, but to worry over removing them is the same. Today’s "benevolent" people, with anxious eyes, fret over the world—this is excess in number. They split their nature to covet wealth and honor—this is deficiency in number. Yet they do not recognize that this is not the true nature of life and death. Instead, they cling to it, splitting and weeping, biting and wailing. Those who rely on compasses and marking-lines to straighten, on glue and lacquer to fasten, are carving away their nature and encroaching on their power, losing their constant spontaneity. Constant spontaneity does not rely on compasses, marking-lines, glue, or lacquer to be naturally straight and secure. Not knowing why they live, not knowing why they attain, from ancient times to the present, unchanged and undiminished—this is what is meant by constant spontaneity, the true standard of the Dao and virtue. Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling so tenaciously, like glue, lacquer, ropes, and cords, wandering between the Dao and virtue? They only serve to confuse the world. Losing one’s bearings means taking east for west; losing one’s nature means taking non-being for being. Born in tranquility, one is lured by benevolence and righteousness to be disturbed—this is using benevolence and righteousness to alter one’s nature.

Thus, let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties, the world has not failed to exchange its nature for things. The petty person dies for profit; the scholar dies for fame; the grandee dies for his house; the sage dies for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations vary in name, in harming their nature and dying for something, they are one and the same. Zang and Gu were two men who herded sheep together and both lost their sheep. When asked what Zang was doing, he was found clutching his bamboo slips, reading. When asked what Gu was doing, he was found playing games of chance. Though their undertakings differed, in losing their sheep, they were the same. Boyi died for fame at the foot of Shouyang; Robber Zhi died for profit on the eastern slopes. Though what they died for differed, in maiming their lives and harming their nature, they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is entirely given to dying for something. Those who die for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom; those who die for wealth and profit are called petty men. In what they die for, they are one and the same—some are called gentlemen, some petty men. But in maiming their lives and harming their nature, Robber Zhi is Boyi. Why distinguish between gentleman and petty man in this?

If one understands that traces arise from non-action, then by cutting off excessive attachments and returning to the profound, one reaches the ultimate—where Yao and Jie become equal in self-attainment. How then can one distinguish between gentleman and petty man?

**Lü’s Annotation:**
When the spirit descends to become a sage-king, it is but the outward form of sageliness. From the Three Dynasties onward, only the traces of sage-kings are seen, while that which makes them spirit has vanished. Take Yu’s calloused hands or Tang and Wu’s military campaigns: though arising from necessity, their traces could not escape becoming entangled in the world’s ills. Zhuangzi sought to sever these ills and return to the spirit’s original source—thus his critique of the sage is as it should be, not a belittling of them. Boyi died for fame, clinging to restraint like the man who lost his sheep; Robber Zhi died for profit, gambling like the man who lost his sheep. Though what they died for differed, in maiming life and harming nature, they were the same. This is why those who follow the Dao value forgetting both extremes and transforming through the Way.

---

**Detailed Explanation of the Dao:**
Boyi died for fame, yet could not weaken his resolve; Robber Zhi died for profit, yet could not harden his bones. The sheep is a creature that herds without faction, is reverent yet possesses propriety. The character for "sheep" (羊) combines "speech" (言) to form "obedience" (□), and "great" (大) to form "beauty" (美)—truly there is something to be taken from this. Thus Zhuangzi uses the lost sheep as a metaphor for losing the Dao.

---

**Oral Exegesis:**
"Clinging to restraint" (挟防) means holding to rules; "gambling" (博塞) refers to casting lots—"博" when thrown, "塞" when not—like modern dice.

Moreover, to tether one’s nature to benevolence and righteousness—though one may attain it like Zengzi or Shi, this is not what I call true goodness. To tether one’s nature to the five flavors—though one may attain it like Yu’er, this is not what I call true goodness. To tether one’s nature to the five sounds—though one may attain it like Music Master Kuang, this is not what I call true hearing. To tether one’s nature to the five colors—though one may attain it like Li Zhu, this is not what I call true vision.

What I call true goodness is not the pursuit of benevolence and righteousness, but preserving one’s inherent virtue. What I call true goodness is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but following the natural tendencies of one’s nature and fate. What I call true hearing is not hearing others, but hearing oneself. What I call true vision is not seeing others, but seeing oneself.

For one who does not see oneself but sees others, does not attain for oneself but attains for others—this is attaining another’s attainment, not one’s own. It is fitting oneself to another’s fitting, not one’s own. To fit oneself to another’s fitting rather than one’s own—whether Robber Zhi or Boyi, both are equally excessive and perverse. I am ashamed of this. Therefore, above, I dare not cling to the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not engage in excessive and perverse actions.

---

**Yu’er** was an ancient expert in discerning flavors. The *Huainanzi* writes him as Shen’er; the *Shizi* says, "The royal chef Yu’er seasoned food with ginger and cinnamon," and that he was "a ruler’s chef." Some say he was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time, others of Qi.

---

**Guo’s Annotation:**
To "tether" (属) is to bind this to that, to tether one’s nature to benevolence is to follow benevolence alone—thus it is not good. To follow one’s nature and connect with others is good; but to entrust it not to oneself but to others, though one may connect with them, one has already lost oneself.

Thus, when each employs the use of their ears and eyes without tethering them to detachment and emptiness, this is true acuity and clarity. Therefore, those adept at self-attainment forget benevolence, for to deem benevolence and righteousness as good is to harm the self in pursuit of them—this, in regard to one’s nature and life, is self-inflicted unkindness. If the self is not even kind to itself, how can it be so toward others? Only by entrusting oneself to one’s nature and life can one extend to others, and in extending to others without burdening oneself, where self and other are alike in self-attainment, this may be called true goodness.

To sever ties with detachment and emptiness, to rely solely on what is heard and seen—then the acuity and clarity of all directions will be wholly preserved. Yet to not see for oneself, not attain for oneself, is to abandon the self and imitate others. Though one may imitate them to resemble others, the self is already lost. If to lose one’s nature is deemed excessive and perverse, then though the paths of loss may differ, the loss itself is one and the same.

Ashamed of failing to embody the Dao and the virtue, repenting the absence of traces in profound return, one severs cultivated conduct, forgets fame and profit, moves with ease amid entanglements, relinquishes the self, and forgets others—this alone suffices.

---

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Nature is that to which things belong, not that which belongs to things. Yet Zeng and Shi tethered themselves to benevolence, Yu’er to flavors, Shi Kuang and Li Zhu to sounds and sights—these are not what I call *zang* (treasure). To treasure lies in one’s virtue, for this is the essence of treasuring, not that benevolence and righteousness can treasure it. Simply entrusting oneself to the essence of one’s nature and life suffices. To speak of benevolence and righteousness is already to impose a designation, and what they treasure remains indeterminate. To entrust oneself to the essence of nature and life is to be without designation, beyond naming—this is the true meaning of *zang*.

Acuity and clarity are likewise: to not hear others yet hear oneself, to not see others yet see oneself—this is to truly see what is seen and hear what is heard. If one’s seeing and hearing reside in others rather than oneself, this is attaining another’s attainment, suiting another’s suit, yet failing to attain one’s own nature and life and suit them. In this, what difference lies between Robber Zhi and Bo Yi? To neither practice benevolence and righteousness above nor engage in excess and perversion below is to forget both.

---

**General Observations on the Text:**
The "Inner Chapters" derive their themes from the Qi Garden, each bearing profound intent, while the "Miscellaneous Chapters" were edited by Guo Xiang, named merely by their opening characters, though their essential meanings remain preserved.

Since the Inner Chapters expound in detail the principles of nature, life, the Dao, and virtue, the Outer Chapters begin by discussing what virtue and nature ought not to possess, akin to superfluous limbs or growths upon the body. This intent originates from the *Daodejing*’s "leftover food and redundant conduct," illustrating how self-display and self-importance distance one from the Dao, yet here it unfolds in such vast and flowing elaboration.

A person’s virtue and nature are pure as jade within uncut stone; when nurtured by wood and moistened by mountains, their luster spreads. Yet when carved by acuity and clarity, divided by benevolence and righteousness, the pursuit of goodness in external things causes the innate purity within to be lost. Thus, the text cites Zeng, Shi, Li Kuang, Yang, and Mo—each grasping a partial aspect of nature, following perverse habits—and though these are but branching paths, the world still rushes to admire them. To act thus is to lose the essence of one’s nature and life, to stray from the rectitude of the Dao and virtue, and so to throw the world into chaos.

Only by forgetting differences and unifying them, like the wild duck and crane whose forms are unbroken yet each retains its natural state, can one draw near the Dao. Yet since the world remains deluded, what is to be done? The text then presents the parables of Zang and Gu losing their sheep, illustrating how Bo Yi and Robber Zhi each took their pursuits as the divide between gentleman and petty man, though both equally maimed life and harmed nature.

Truly, if one can abandon traces, sever attachments, return to nature without tether, and revert to the origin, roaming at the source of things—then superfluous limbs and growths will be forgotten along with the body, and gentleman and petty man alike will rest in self-attainment. Thus, the ultimate lies in following the essence of nature and life, while the original acuity and clarity remain undiminished.

The horse’s hooves can tread frost and snow, its coat can ward off wind and cold; it grazes on grass, drinks from streams, and prances upon the earth—such is the horse’s true nature. Yet though there be halls of state and royal chambers, they are of no use to it. Then came Bo Le, who declared, “I excel at managing horses.” He branded them, sheared their coats, pared their hooves, and bored their nostrils, binding them with halters and reins, tethering them to black stable racks. Of these horses, twelve or thirteen in every twenty died. He starved them, parched them, galloped them, raced them, drilled them, and aligned them. Before them lay the torment of bits and trappings; behind them, the threat of whips and restraints. Of these horses, more than half perished.

The potter says, “I excel at working clay: what is round fits the compass, what is square matches the carpenter’s square.” The craftsman says, “I excel at working wood: what is curved fits the hook, what is straight aligns with the marking line.” Yet does the nature of clay or wood truly desire to conform to compass, square, hook, or line? Nevertheless, generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for excelling at managing horses, and potters and craftsmen for excelling at working clay and wood—this, too, is the error of those who govern the world.

The bridle and reins that pass through the horse’s head are called *ji*; those that bind the feet are called *xi*. *Zaozhan* refers to the trough and stable. The bit in the horse’s mouth is called *jue*; the tassels on the bridle are called *shi*.

Guo’s commentary:
Each horse, whether swift or slow, finds its own nature sufficient. The true nature of horses does not reject the saddle or resent being ridden; it merely desires no excess of splendor. Yet when one deliberately seeks to "manage" them, management itself becomes the problem. Those who excel at driving horses aim to exhaust their abilities, but exhausting their abilities depends on letting them act of their own accord. Instead, they are made to gallop and race, forced to perform beyond their capacity—hence their inability to endure and their high mortality. If, however, one simply employs the strength of each horse, swift or slow, according to its natural pace, then even if their tracks extend to the farthest reaches of the eight wilds, the nature of all horses will remain intact. Some, hearing of "following the horse’s nature," take it to mean letting them roam without being ridden; others, upon hearing of the "wind of non-action," claim that walking is no better than lying down. How reckless and unreturning they are! They have strayed far from Zhuangzi’s meaning.

Lü’s commentary:
When horses bite grass and drink water without coveting the elevated halls and grand chambers, it is like the people plowing and weaving to sustain themselves without envying the lofty and illustrious. When Bo Le, by branding, shearing, and bridling, causes a third of the horses to die, it is like imposing benevolence and righteousness by force, so that the world begins to doubt. When horses die in droves from hunger, thirst, galloping, and racing, it is like bending and breaking ritual and music, so that the world begins to divide. The world has its constant principles; one should act in accordance with its nature. Now, when potters and craftsmen excel at making things round, square, curved, or straight, they all violate these constant principles. To govern the world while violating its constant principles is to fail to understand the Way of *inaction and indulgence*—this is the error of governance.

Following the original text:
Zheng Sinong said: In ancient times, the *Yili* (Book of Etiquette) only described the *yi* (proper forms). The *tai* (platform) refers to what the *Jiaotesheng* (Sacrificial Rites of the Suburban Altar) calls the *tai* gate—earth piled into a platform, with a house built atop it, the central door serving as the gate, hence the model for palace architecture. Today, the common term *yimen* (ceremonial gate) persists. In astronomy, there is also the *Dayi* (Great Regulator) court. The *luzhin* (main chamber) is the principal hall. *Yitai* and *luzhin* together refer to the entirety of palace architecture. Bo Le’s surname was Sun, his given name Yang. The *Shishi Xingjing* (Star Canon of the Shi Clan) states that Bo Le is the name of a celestial star governing heavenly horses. Sun Yang excelled at driving horses, hence the name.

In my view, those who excel at governing the world do not act thus. The people have a constant nature: they weave to clothe themselves and plow to feed themselves. This is called *shared virtue*—united yet impartial, named *Heaven’s release*. Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their gait is steady, their gaze fixed. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. The myriad things lived in close succession, their villages connected. Birds and beasts gathered in flocks, grasses and trees grew unchecked. Therefore, one could tether birds and beasts and wander with them, or climb to peer into the nests of crows and magpies. In the age of utmost virtue, people dwelled together with birds and beasts, lived in tribes alongside the myriad things. How could they have known of gentlemen and petty men? They were one.

The people, unaware of their virtue, do not depart from this unity. Without desire, they are called *plain simplicity*; in plain simplicity, the people’s nature is preserved. Yet when the sage comes, hobbling and straining for benevolence, stretching and contorting for righteousness, the world begins to doubt. Dissipating into extravagance for music, fragmenting into minutiae for ritual, the world begins to divide. Thus, if unhewn simplicity is not carved, what need is there for sacrificial vessels? If flawless jade is not shattered, what need is there for ceremonial tablets? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why seek benevolence and righteousness? If nature and emotion are not sundered, why employ ritual and music? If the five colors do not disorder, what need is there for ornament? If the five notes do not disorder, what need is there to harmonize with the six pitches? To carve simplicity into implements is the fault of craftsmen; to shatter the Dao and virtue into benevolence and righteousness is the error of sages.

Here the world’s common foundation lies. Those who preserve this Dao attain the perfection of non-action—let it be, and it unifies itself. This is no faction, hence called "Heaven’s letting-be." The demeanor of steadfast simplicity—self-sufficient, seeking nothing beyond—does not chase gains beyond hope, thus content within the household and fulfilled. Vague and indistinct, they merge with their age in tranquil indifference. Are nations different, or households distinct? They halt where nature is satisfied, harboring no desires to annex or subdue. Thus things remain whole, and in their wholeness, they harm nothing—hence all things are tame.

Knowledge strays from the Dao to pursue goodness; desire strays from nature to adorn the plain and simple—no need for such troubles. Knowledge and desire are the cause. The sage is but the trace where the people recover their nature, not the source of that trace. Here it says, "even unto the sage," meaning even unto that trace. Once the sage’s trace is manifest, benevolence and righteousness lose their authenticity, ritual and music depart from nature, and only the outward form remains. Where there is a sage, this corruption follows—what can we do?

Carving simplicity into implements, shattering jade into tablets—all such transformations turn the plain into the ornate, abandon the root to exalt the branch, and thus violate Heaven’s plainness. Though the world may prize them, it is not their true worth. Craftsmen have their compass and square; sages have their exalted traces.

When people return to their constant nature and do not depart from their truth, what is called "sage" cannot be seen. Without desire, the plain and simple remain unquestioned; with shared virtue and no division, there is no separation. But when they depart from truth, there emerges what is called the sage—acting as benevolence, acting as righteousness, not following the natural; enacting ritual, enacting music, not following the perfect uprightness—and the world begins to doubt, begins to divide.

Carving simplicity into sacrificial vessels is like destroying the Dao and virtue for benevolence and righteousness; shattering jade into tablets is like sundering emotion and nature for ritual and music—both are superfluous, branching paths. Cut off craft and return to simplicity, and the craftsman’s fault is removed; abandon benevolence and righteousness and follow the Dao and virtue, and the sage’s error is avoided.

Horses, when dwelling on land, eat grass and drink water; when pleased, they rub necks together; when angered, they turn backs and kick. This is all the knowledge horses need. Yet when yokes and bits are applied, when frontal plates align them, horses learn to butt, to feint, to block, to seize, to snatch bridles and steal reins. Thus the knowledge horses acquire, enabling them to become thieves, is the fault of Bo Le.

In the age of赫胥氏, people dwelled without knowing what to do, wandered without knowing where to go. Chewing their food, they played; patting their bellies, they roamed. This was all people could do. But when sages bent and contorted ritual and music to correct the world’s form, dangled benevolence and righteousness to soothe the world’s heart, people then began to stand on tiptoe, to vie in cleverness, to contend for profit—unable to stop. This, too, is the sage’s error.

The term *xiaoti* refers to kicking, while *yue ti* denotes the crescent-shaped frontal plate affixed to a horse’s forehead. *Jie ni* means to butt or feint, *yin* signifies bending or curving, *zhi* means to resist or strike, *man* means to thrust, *gui xian* means to spit out the bit, and *qie pei* means to gnaw at the reins.

Guo’s commentary: If one harnesses a horse’s true knowledge and rides its natural disposition, then a journey of a thousand miles may be completed without losing the nature of the herd. Yet horses’ natures differ, and when one seeks uniformity in their use, some will exhaust their strength and adopt unnatural postures.

The people’s true ability lies in chewing their food and patting their bellies. But when sages bend and twist ritual and music, dangle benevolence and righteousness, the people then begin to vie in cleverness—all due to the exaltation of such traces.

Lü’s commentary: Horses that eat grass and drink water, nuzzling or kicking, know when to stop—just as the people of the age of Hexu dwelled without knowledge or action, chewing their food and patting their bellies. Applying yokes and frontal plates is like bending ritual and music, dangling benevolence and righteousness to correct and soothe the world. Horses learn to butt, feint, spit out bits, and gnaw reins—just as people stand on tiptoe, vie in cleverness, and contend for profit without cease.

*Jie* means to butt, *ni* to feint; *yin* means to curve, *e* to restrain; *zhi* means to strike, *man* to deceive. Knowing where yokes, bits, frontal plates, and reins are placed, horses then employ their resistance and cunning to spit out bits and gnaw reins—this is how their knowledge leads to thievery. Yet if one wishes horses not to become thieves and people not to vie in cleverness, there is no other way but to return to their true nature.

Following the text: Further illustrating with horses, it notes that when they kick, they turn their backs and strike with their hind legs—hence *fen bei xiang ti* (turning backs to kick). *E* is the same as *e* (yoke), used to restrain a horse’s legs. *Gui xian* means to spit out the bit, *qie pei* to stealthily remove the reins. *Xian qi* means to dangle something so that one must stand on tiptoe to reach it.

General observations: This chapter presents a single idea in four sections. First, it introduces the theme, using horse-driving to illustrate governance, akin to the analogy in the *Book of Documents* of driving horses to govern the people. Here, however, the opening and closing vividly depict the horse’s nature and temperament, capturing its joy and anger in full. Next, it borrows the metaphor of pottery to argue that deliberate action in governance disrupts the world’s natural disposition, whereas non-action allows things to transform themselves. It then cites the age of utmost virtue, when people were without knowledge or desire, and later kings established laws, causing the world to doubt—no different from Bo Le’s methods of branding, trimming, and carving to pursue swift strides. Finally, it invokes the ancient era of simple people and honest customs, where all delighted in ease, proving the efficacy of the royal way of non-action. Later generations, in seeking governance, overreached and rendered the world ungovernable.

**Chapter Ten: "Breaking Open Chests"**
Those who would guard against thieves who break open chests, plunder sacks, and ransack coffers must bind cords tightly, fasten locks, and secure bolts—this is what the world calls "wisdom."

Yet when the great thief arrives, he hoists the coffer, lifts the chest, shoulders the sack, and flees—only fearing that cords, locks, and bolts are not secure enough. Thus, what the village once called "wisdom" is nothing but the accumulation of spoils for the great thief.

Let us then examine this: among what the world calls "wise," is there one who does not accumulate for the great thief? Among what it calls "sagely," is there one who does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?

In ancient times, the state of Qi had villages so close their roosters and dogs could be heard across borders. Nets and traps spread wide, plows and hoes tilled deep—its lands stretched over two thousand *li*. Within its four borders, all that established ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, governed towns, houses, districts, hamlets, and neighborhoods—was this not modeled on the sages’ laws?

Yet Tian Chengzi, in a single day, slew the ruler of Qi and stole the state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also seized the sagely wisdom and laws along with it. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of thief and bandit yet lived in the ease of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not condemn him; great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held Qi—was this not the theft of the state *and* its sagely laws to guard his bandit’s body?

*(Note: 胠箧 refers to prying open a chest from beneath, as if reaching under the armpit to seize it. 摄 means to bind tightly.)*

Gathering is the act of securing; *jiong* and *guan* are bolts and locks; *jué* and *niǔ* are latches and knots—some say they are rings and tongues. "For twelve generations he held Qi" refers to the twelve generations from Tian Jingzhong to King Wei of Qi.

Guo’s commentary: *"To amass as a great thief and guard as a great thief"—this speaks of how wisdom is not to be relied upon. Those who model themselves on the sages merely imitate their traces. Yet traces are things already departed, not tools for responding to change. How can they be esteemed and clung to? Clinging to fixed traces to govern the boundless—when the boundless arrives, the traces falter. Thus, one guards the state only to have it guarded by others. The great thief, if he does not steal the sagely laws, has no means to seize the state. This shows that sagely laws are but tools for men to use, not instruments sufficient for perfection.*

Lü’s commentary: *This speaks of how what the world calls sagely wisdom is truly not so—true sagely wisdom is fundamentally otherwise.*

Oral Exegesis: *This passage reveals the indignation of a heroic mind toward the world, showing how the wisdom of the vulgar is but preparation for petty thievery. When the great thief comes, he carries it all away. The Tian clan usurped Qi, lending with private measures and collecting with public ones—see the *Zuozhuan* for proof. They borrowed the sages’ laws to advance their bandit schemes, as was common in the Warring States era. Thus, Zhuangzi uses this as a metaphor.*

Let us examine this: Is there any so-called supreme wisdom in the world that does not serve to amass for the great thief? Any so-called supreme sageliness that does not serve to guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so? In ancient times, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was torn to shreds. Thus, though the four were worthy, their lives were not spared from execution. Now, the followers of Robber Zhi asked him, "Does theft also have a Dao?" Zhi replied, "Where is there anything that does not have a Dao? To recklessly guess the treasures hidden in a chamber—that is sageliness. To enter first—that is courage. To withdraw last—that is righteousness."

To know what is permissible and what is not—this is wisdom. To divide equally—this is benevolence. Without these five virtues complete, none in the world has ever become a great thief. From this we see: without the Dao of the sage, the good man cannot stand; without the Dao of the sage, Robber Zhi cannot act. If the good men of the world are few and the unvirtuous many, then the sage’s benefit to the world is slight, while his harm to the world is great.

Thus it is said: when the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when the Lu wine was weak, Handan was besieged. When the sage is born, great thieves arise. Only when the sage is struck down and thieves and bandits released does the world begin to be ordered. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. When the sage is dead, great thieves do not rise, and the world remains at peace without disturbance.

If the sage does not die, great thieves will not cease. Though one may exalt the sage to govern the world, this is but to multiply the gains of Robber Zhi. When measures and pecks are made to quantify, they are stolen along with the measures. When scales and balances are made to weigh, they are stolen along with the scales. When tallies and seals are made to authenticate, they are stolen along with the tallies. When benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, they are stolen along with benevolence and righteousness.

How do we know this is so? Those who steal a belt-hook are executed; those who steal a state become lords. At the gates of lords, benevolence and righteousness reside—are these not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom? Thus, those who pursue great thieves, who exalt lords, who steal benevolence and righteousness along with the profits of measures, scales, tallies, and seals—even the rewards of high office cannot encourage them, nor the threat of the executioner’s axe deter them. This multiplication of Robber Zhi’s gains, which cannot be restrained, is the fault of the sage.

Thus it is said: the fish must not leave the deep; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others. The sage is the world’s sharpest tool—he is not what should be displayed to the world.

In the midst of a crumbling river—】

Xiang Xiu:
When the sage is dead, great thieves do not arise. The sage’s work is ever-renewing; what is new is life, what is old is death. Riding the world’s uprightness, guiding the transformations of daily renewal, attaining substance while diminishing name, returning to truth while forgetting the path—then great thieves cease. Those who speak of “not dying” cling to the old and do not renew daily; they are bound by name and do not create substance. If great thieves do not stop, is this not fitting?

Guo’s Commentary:
When violent rulers rely on the sovereign’s authority to execute worthy ministers without opposition, it is all due to the sage’s laws. Without the sage’s laws, how could Jie and Zhou retain their thrones and unleash their poison, making the world avert its gaze? The sage’s courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence—these five are meant to restrain thieves, yet they instead become resources for thieves. The sage benefits the world little and harms it much. How true are these words! Though true, the world cannot yet do without the sage, for the world’s knowledge has not yet wholly vanished. Thus, the Dao of the sage is still needed to govern it. If all knowledge were abolished but the sage’s knowledge alone remained, the world’s harm would be greater than if the sage still existed. Yet though the harm of having the sage is great, it is still better than the chaos of a world without governance. Though better than a world without the sage, it is not as good as a world where all knowledge is abolished and no harm exists. How extreme it is! The world seeks nothing but profit, yet cannot unite in abolishing its knowledge—how deluded and lost it is in its pursuit!

Drying the lips does not chill the teeth, yet the teeth grow cold; the thinness of Lu’s wine does not besiege Handan, yet Handan is besieged. The sage is not born to incite great thieves, yet great thieves arise—this is the natural, inevitable course of mutual generation. The sage does not establish reverence for things, yet cannot prevent things from revering them. Thus, whether noble or base, whether true or false, if the world reveres the sage’s laws, it swallows its voice and submits in darkness. This is how Jie and Zhi rely on them to perfect their great thievery. If instead one rejects reverence, guards simplicity, discards prohibitions, and replaces them with few desires, one strikes at the sage and preserves one’s own simplicity. Even if one abandons thieves and bandits, their wickedness will cease of itself. As the ancients said: “To guard against deceit and preserve sincerity, one need not be keenly perceptive; to end excess and remove ornament, one need not rely on harsh punishments.” This is the meaning.

Draining the river does not empty the valley, yet the valley empties; leveling the hill does not fill the abyss, yet the abyss fills. Abolishing the sage does not stop thieves, yet thieves stop. Thus, stopping thieves lies in eliminating desires, not in exalting sagely knowledge. To further entrench the sage in governing the world is to provide Jie and Zhi’s ilk with the very laws they exploit. What they exploit is weighty, so the profit they gain cannot be light. The means by which petty thieves operate become the resources and profit of great thieves. The weight of caps and carriages, axes and halberds, rewards and punishments—these are meant to restrain thieves. Yet great thieves pursue and steal them, turning them to their own use. What they use is weighty, and thus it perfects their great thievery. The great thief must act with benevolence and righteousness, weigh with balanced scales, pledge with tallies and seals, encourage with caps and carriages, and threaten with axes and halberds. Only after stealing these public instruments can he lift up the lords. Thus, benevolence, righteousness, rewards, and punishments are sufficient only to execute those who steal belt-hooks. That Zhi cannot be restrained arises from the weight of the profit he steals; the weight of that profit arises from the sage’s refusal to diminish it. Thus, ending thievery lies in devaluing goods, not in exalting the sage.

When fish leave the depths, they become prey for men; when sharp tools are displayed, they become resources for thieves. Thus, they cannot be shown to others. If the sage truly could abolish sageliness and discard knowledge, returning to guard against extremes, then when things reach their extreme, each would guard against it—this is the trace of benefiting things, the tool that is but a trace. To display sharp tools to the world is to provide resources for thieves and bandits.

Lü’s Commentary:
What the world calls knowledge and sageliness is all constructed through laws. Even the most profound knowledge and sageliness do not transcend the names of courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence, yet they do not understand *why* knowledge is knowledge or *why* sageliness is sageliness. Thus, the Four Masters could not preserve their lives, while Zhi’s followers instead used them as resources for thievery. What the world calls sagely knowledge thus inevitably becomes the accumulation of great thieves. That the most profound knowledge lies in unknowing, and the most profound sageliness in namelessness, while the world’s sagely knowledge instead aids thieves—this proves that the sage benefits the world little and harms it much, no empty words.

Lips and teeth are an analogy for mutual dependence; Lu’s wine and Handan are an analogy for non-dependence that nonetheless leads to dependence. Thus, to govern the world, nothing is better than striking at the sage and abandoning thieves and bandits, forgetting both good and evil. The valley of the heart is not empty, yet thieving hearts arise within it because the sage is treated as an abyss and dammed. Drain the sage’s river and dry it, and the valley will empty, and thieves will not arise. The abyss of the heart is not full, yet thieving hearts enter it because the sage is treated as a hill and toppled. Level the sage’s hill and diminish it, and the abyss will fill, and thieves will not invade. This is how, when the sage is dead and great thieves do not arise, the world remains without disorder. What is called “death” is the cessation of its heart. When thieving hearts arise and great thieves appear, even if one relies heavily on the sage to govern the world, this is to heavily profit thieves. As seen in the passage below on “stealing together,” those who steal belt-hooks are executed, while those who steal states become lords, yet none can restrain them. At the gates of lords, benevolence and righteousness reside—this is to steal sagely knowledge, benevolence, and righteousness together. How much more so for those even greater who lift up the lords! Even with caps and carriages, axes and halberds, none can restrain them. All this stems from the error of departing from truth to become a sage, yet still using the sage’s laws to enlighten the world—this is to display sharp tools to others, allowing great thieves to seize them.

】

*Brush Notes*:
“Lu’s wine was thin and Handan was besieged”: According to Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi*, when the states gathered at Chu, Lu presented wine to the King of Chu. Lu’s wine was thin, while Zhao’s was rich. The Chu official in charge of wine demanded wine from Zhao, but Zhao refused. The official, enraged, exchanged Zhao’s rich wine for Lu’s thin wine and presented it to the King of Chu. The King, deeming Zhao’s wine thin, besieged Handan.

*Personal Observations*:
“The sage is the world’s sharpest tool”—“sage” here should undoubtedly be “sagely knowledge,” an error by the transmitter.

Thus, abolish sageliness and discard knowledge, and great thieves will cease. Cast aside jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise. Burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity and rusticity. Smash measures and break scales, and the people will not contend. Exhaust and destroy the world’s sagely laws, and only then can one discuss matters with the people. Uproot and disorder the six pitch-pipes, melt and sever the zithers and se, and deafen the ears of Music Master Kuang.

When the people of the world begin to contain their acuity within, extinguish patterns and disperse the five colors, and blind the eyes of Li Zhu, then the people of the world begin to contain their clarity within. Destroy and discard plumb lines and abandon compasses and squares, sever the fingers of Master Chui, and the people of the world begin to possess their own skill. Thus it is said, "Great skill appears clumsy." Eradicate the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue begins to attain primordial unity.

When people contain their clarity within, the world is not dazzled; when they contain their acuity within, the world is not burdened; when they contain their knowledge within, the world is not deluded; when they contain their virtue within, the world is not perverse. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Music Master Kuang, Master Chui, and Li Zhu all externally establish their virtue and use brilliance to disorder the world—such are the methods that should be discarded.

Guo Xiang’s Commentary:
Remove their resources, and prohibitions become unnecessary as transgressions cease of themselves. Diminish what they esteem, and punishments become superfluous as offenses fade away. Eliminate the reliance on artifice, and there will be no means to enact their cunning. What appears as minor leveling is in fact the very tool of great imbalance. Without external distortion, one preserves inner wholeness and the pristine self, free from the harm of self-loss.

For sound and color, Music Master Kuang’s ears and eyes are what men prize. Yet to be born with a lot and be led astray by what one prizes is to forfeit one’s nature and life. If, instead, one destroys what is prized and abandons external dependence, each person’s clarity and acuity remain intact, and people contain their true essence.

Consider the lowly spider and pill beetle: though crude, they weave webs and roll pellets without seeking the craft of artisans. All things possess their own abilities. Though their capacities differ, none dares deviate from what they practice—thus, what seems skillful appears clumsy. Therefore, one who excels in employing others assigns the square to those skilled in squares and the round to those skilled in rounds, each entrusted with their own ability. People rest in their nature, not demanding of the common folk the skill of Master Chui. Thus, the myriad arts, though not mutually surpassing, seem clumsy, yet the world naturally attains great skill.

Employ their innate abilities, and compasses and squares may be discarded, the master artisan’s fingers severed. Remove the leaders who disorder the multitude, and the world each returns to its uncarved simplicity, uniting in primordial virtue. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Li Zhu, Music Master Kuang, and Master Chui are endowed with multifarious talents, causing the world to leap and emulate them. In emulation, one loses oneself; in losing oneself through another, that other becomes the source of disorder.

As for the methods that should be employed: sight does not exceed what is seen, so the eyes of the multitude are all clear; hearing does not exceed what is heard, so the ears of the multitude are all acute; affairs do not exceed what one is capable of, so the skills of the multitude are all proficient; knowledge does not exceed what one knows, so the natures of the multitude are all fitting; virtue does not exceed what one attains, so the virtues of the multitude are all appropriate. Why establish what lies beyond the bounds of one’s nature and lot, causing the world to gallop forth without the ability to return to itself?

Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:
What Zhuangzi calls "abolishing sageliness and discarding knowledge" does not mean destroying classical texts or abandoning governance and education, but rather not allowing them to arise in the heart. "Cast aside jade and shatter pearls" does not mean emptying treasuries or discarding them from mountains, but rather not harboring a mind that values them. "Burn tallies and break seals" does not mean literally burning and smashing them, but rather trusting in trustworthiness, so that the people return to simplicity and rusticity, and tallies and seals are no longer relied upon. "Smash measures and break scales" does not mean literally smashing and breaking them, but rather leveling with levelness, so that the people do not contend, and measures and scales are no longer relied upon. Only then can the people return to the essence of their nature and life, and one may begin to discuss matters with them. "Deafen the ears of Music Master Kuang"—this is to return to inner listening.

When I return to inner listening, the world embraces its own acuity; when Jiao Li and Zhu desire inward vision, I turn my gaze within, and the world embraces its own clarity. When I sever the fingers of Gongchui, the world begins to possess its own skill; when I silence the conduct of Zeng and Shi and muzzle the mouths of Yang and Mo, the world’s virtue first achieves primordial unity—this lies in my abandonment of knowledge, severance of craft, and concealment of what may be desired. As for those who externally establish their virtue and thereby throw the world into chaos, they do not embrace its acuity and clarity, nor return to the essence of nature and life—such are those for whom the law has no use.

Yet some claim that Zhuangzi truly sought to strike down the sages, indulge thieves and bandits, and exhaust the legal codes—how could one engage in subtle discourse with such as these?

Do you alone not know of the age of utmost virtue? In ancient times, under Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people used knotted cords for records. They found sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, joy in their customs, and contentment in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs carried between them, yet the people grew old and died without ever journeying beyond. In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved.

Now, however, the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “In such-and-such a place there is a worthy one,” and carrying provisions, they rush to follow. Thus, they abandon their parents at home and forsake their lords’ service abroad. Footprints crisscross the borders of the feudal lords, and chariot tracks intertwine a thousand *li* away—this is the fault of those above who esteem knowledge excessively.

When those above truly esteem knowledge yet lack the Dao, the world falls into great chaos. How do we know this is so? When the cunning of bows, crossbows, snares, and traps multiplies, birds grow disordered in the skies. When the craft of hooks, baits, nets, weirs, and baskets multiplies, fish grow disordered in the waters. When the skill of pitfalls, fences, nets, traps, and snares multiplies, beasts grow disordered in the marshes. When the sophistries of deceit, treachery, venomous words, and the disputes over firmness and whiteness, purity and filth, sameness and difference multiply, the common folk are bewildered by argument.

Thus, whenever the world falls into great chaos, the fault lies in the esteem for knowledge. For the world all knows to seek what it does not know, yet none knows to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it deems unworthy, yet none knows to condemn what it already deems worthy. This is why great chaos arises. Above, it confounds the brightness of sun and moon; below, it scorches the essence of mountains and rivers; and in between, it disrupts the workings of the four seasons. Even the softest creatures and the tiniest winged things—none fails to lose its nature. How severe is the chaos wrought by the esteem for knowledge!

From the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case: abandoning the people of simple virtue, they delight in the flattery of the restless; forsaking the serenity of non-action, they take pleasure in the clamor of empty words. Such clamor has already thrown the world into chaos.

The "rabbit net" is called *bi*, the "cutting frame" *ge*—these are the implements used to set snares and nets. Bird nets are called *luo*, rabbit nets *ju*; *fu* is also written as *fou* (a revolving trap). *Xiehu* refers to perverse and improper speech; *jiegou* to devious and twisted words. *Zhuan* is also written as *chuan* (a legless creature); *xiaoqiao* refers to creatures that soar and fly. *Zhongzhong* denotes simplicity and honesty; *yiyi* describes the active, meddling person.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
People used knotted cords to record matters, which was sufficient to note essentials. Thus, they were content with what was fitting and found it naturally beautiful. But if one indulges in extravagance, there is never enough to satisfy. Not interacting with one another, having no desires—this is the ultimate state of non-seeking. Carrying provisions to chase after the worthy while abandoning kin and forsaking rulers—even the path to perfect governance leads to such corruption. Above, it refers to rulers who esteem knowledge: if they know and favor it, such errors arise. The more tightly one pursues, the more skillfully one evades; even birds and beasts cannot be captured by knowledge—how much less so humans! Thus, those who govern the world must not rely on knowledge; relying on knowledge is no subtle art. What those above value, those below cannot be content with little. If one’s nature is meager yet one chases after excess, one becomes lost. Not seeking what one knows but pursuing what one does not know—this is abandoning oneself to imitate others, exceeding one’s proper bounds. Approving what one deems good gives rise to competition and esteem. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—all arise from action. If the movements of knowledge can truly shake heaven and earth, govern all living things, how can a ruler fail to forget his knowledge?

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The governance of the sage constantly ensures the people are without knowledge and without desire. Without knowledge, they used knotted cords; without desire, they found their food sweet, their clothing beautiful, their customs joyful, their dwellings peaceful. The people lived to old age and death without interacting—this was the age of utmost virtue. When all under heaven knew beauty as beauty, ugliness arose; when all knew goodness as goodness, not-goodness arose. All knew to condemn what they deemed unworthy, yet none knew to condemn what they already deemed worthy—beauty and goodness. Again, through non-action, even beauty and goodness are not the true nature of life. The people did not interact yet formed clans naturally—this is called the *zhongzhong* people. If one carries provisions to chase after the worthy, this is the flattery of the *yiyi*. Their teaching resembles a father’s; their admonitions...

The semblance of a son yet the murmuring of dissent—such is the fault of exalting the worthy and prizing knowledge. From knowledge arises the sage; from the sage arises the great thief. Both sage and great thief emerge from the same source of knowledge, hence this chapter consistently advocates the abandonment of knowledge.

In detail: The *Dao* tradition states, "Multifarious affairs breed enmity; excessive speech is the thief of virtue." The *yiyi* are those who engage in ceaseless activity, while the *zhunzhun* are those who indulge in endless chatter.

Tracing to the root: "Knowledge and deceit gradually poison," "hardness and whiteness," "resolving grime," and "sameness and difference"—by the pattern of the preceding text, these should likewise be three matters. "Knowledge and deceit gradually poison" refers to mutual deception through knowledge, which accumulates into venom. "Hardness and whiteness" denotes obstinate insistence on whiteness, while "sameness and difference" denotes conflating difference with sameness—both phrases appear in the writings of Gongsun Long. "Jie" means competing for supremacy, while "hua" (slippery) suggests evasiveness and instability. Those who obstinately insist on whiteness and argue against it engage in such competition, rendering it elusive and unstable. "Jie" (resolving) means defense, and "gou" (grime) refers to the dust on the body. "Resolving grime and sameness" means dissolving defenses as grime is shed. The first phrase addresses knowledge, while the next two address disputation.

The *chuan* (insect) is a small creature, and the *qiao* (sprout) is a small plant.

**General Observations on the Chapter:**
This chapter takes "plundering the chest" as its title. Examining the rhyme, *qu* (胠) means the side of the ribs, so *quqie* (胠箧) refers to opening the side of a chest to take things—an act of theft. Those who govern cannot cultivate the Dao and virtue to align with the natural inclinations of all under heaven; thus, ambitious villains usurp their authority for private gain, and the world suffers harm. *Nanhua* (Zhuangzi) strives to abolish sagacity and discard knowledge, smash measures and break scales, aspiring to restore the governance of non-action of high antiquity. Yet the essence of returning to purity and reverting to simplicity lies in illuminating true knowledge to correct one’s course and reverting to true goodness to preserve what one has received. If those entrusted with governance were all of the mind of the Master of Qiyuan, what worry would there be that the world’s Dao would not flourish or that the pure wind would not return?

**Chapter Eleven: "Preserving and Accommodating"**
To hear of "preserving and accommodating" the world is not to hear of "governing" the world. "Preserving" means fearing the world will corrupt its nature; "accommodating" means fearing the world will alter its virtue. If the world neither corrupts its nature nor alters its virtue, who would govern it?

In ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made all under heaven joyful, and people delighted in their nature—this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made all under heaven weary, and people suffered in their nature—this was not contentment. That which is neither tranquil nor content is not virtue. Without virtue, nothing in the world can endure. When people are excessively joyful, they are harmed by yang; when excessively angry, they are harmed by yin. When yin and yang are both harmed, the four seasons do not arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is not achieved, and in turn, people’s physical forms are injured.

When people’s joy and anger are misplaced, their dwellings lack constancy, their thoughts are not self-possessed, and the mean is not attained. Thereupon, the world begins to distort and contend, to stand aloof and act perversely, and only then do the deeds of Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen and Shi Qiu arise. Thus, even if one were to reward all under heaven for their goodness, it would not suffice; even if one were to punish all under heaven for their evil, it would not be enough. The vastness of the world is insufficient for rewards and punishments. From the Three Dynasties onward, the world has been in tumult, ceaselessly occupied with rewards and punishments. When would they have leisure to settle into the natural conditions of their nature and destiny?

(*Note: "Accommodating" means tolerance.*)

The affliction of *cui* is illness; *pi* means excess; *assistance*. "Distorted and contentious" (*qiao jie*) signifies imbalance; "aloof and perverse" (*zhuo pi*) denotes conduct that is not level. Guo’s commentary: "To grant freedom is to govern; to govern is to disorder. Human life is inherently upright—if nothing sways it, then nature and destiny remain unharmed. Desires and aversions do not err. Those above cannot act without purpose; whatever they do, the people all rush toward it. Thus, when they are lured by admiration and fondness for desires, the people’s nature becomes licentious. What is prized in a sage-king is not his ability to govern, but his non-action that allows things to act of themselves. Without governance, there is no deviation or excess. Though Yao ruled the world with tolerance, his traces were those of governance. Though governance and disorder differ, their loss of the people’s serenity and contentment—causing them to vie for esteem, fear disgrace, and fail to find self-possession—is the same. Thus, to praise Yao and condemn Jie is no better than forgetting both. Only serenity and self-possession can endure. Joy and anger misplaced, dwellings without constancy—these are all the legacy of Yao and Jie, who caused the people’s joy and anger to exceed bounds and thus bring about these ills.

Humans, amidst heaven and earth, are most capable of disturbing the myriad beings and disrupting yin and yang with their intelligence, joy, and anger. Thus, between gain and loss, joy and anger gather, and the people’s hearts are drawn in. The harmony of cold and heat is broken, the seasons’ order is disrupted, the hundred measures falter, and the myriad affairs wither and fall. Admiration of rewards produces goodness, yet rewards cannot suffice; fear of punishments halts evil, yet punishments cannot prevail. Only by forgetting rewards and punishments and returning to innate goodness can nature and destiny be fully realized.

Rewards and punishments are how sage-kings address merit and fault—not to display encouragement or deterrence. Thus, when governance reaches its limit, it is abandoned, and only then can unity be restored. Yet from the Three Dynasties onward, rulers have followed these traces, ceaselessly competing with them, making what was merely a means their constant occupation. When would they have leisure to settle into the natural conditions of their nature and destiny?

Lü’s commentary: "The world is where the myriad things are one; their constant nature and constant virtue are none other than our own nature and virtue. To tolerate the world is to tolerate the self. *In* (to preserve) means to sustain without loss, to follow nature without addition. *You* (to tolerate) means to release without indulgence, like animals in an enclosure. Without excess or deviation, there is only non-action. With non-action, there is no self; without self, who governs the world? Thus, one forgets the right and wrong of Yao and Jie. Humans are born tranquil—what joy or suffering is there? To impose joy or suffering is to corrupt their nature; to corrupt their nature is to deviate from their virtue.

The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, their harmony arising from the *qi* of the center. Humans all possess this harmonious *qi* to commune with heaven and earth. Yet Yao caused the people to delight in their nature, leading to great joy and excess of yang; Jie caused them to suffer in their nature, leading to great anger and excess of yin. Thus, their harmonious *qi* was harmed, the seasons’ bestowal was thwarted, the harmony of cold and heat was unmade, and in turn, the human form was injured. As for thoughts not self-possessed and the mean not attained—this is what is meant by mutual harm. Thereupon, the world began to see distorted, contentious, aloof, and perverse conduct—conduct that exalts height, exhausts scrutiny, defies imitation, and rejects fellowship. None of this is level, easy, balanced, or upright. This is why rewards and punishments cannot suffice, and why the natural conditions of nature and destiny cannot be settled.

Xu’s commentary: "*In* means only to lodge this body in the world, making it aware of the self without excess. *You* means to release it naturally, so that even its cunning and deceit seem forgotten, and it loses itself—yet its joy remains unharmed. This is non-deviation. Not distinguishing Yao from Jie, not separating joy from suffering—this is the truth of what is seen."

The *Xun Ben* commentary: "Joyful yet not serene—this is the fault of not preserving. Weary yet not content—this is the fault of not tolerating. *Pi* means assistance. Joy pertains to yang; anger to yin. When yin and yang in the human body are harmonized, there is no illness. But excess joy assists yang’s dominance; excess anger assists yin’s dominance. The following text uses the yin and yang of the four seasons to illustrate the yin and yang of the human body. 'The mean is not attained' means that affairs are left half-finished, without order."

The *Fu Mo* commentary: "This speaks of joy and suffering, using joy and anger as analogies. A single joy, though enough to gladden the heart, is not as good as no joy; a single anger, though enough to vent frustration, is not as good as no anger. A single Yao or Jie, though enough to govern the world, is not as good as no governance. Now, when people’s joy and anger are misplaced, their dwellings lack constancy, their thoughts are not self-possessed, and the mean is not attained—all this is the fault of governance. Thereupon, the people lose their constant nature, and the world sees distorted, contentious, aloof, and perverse conduct, along with the deeds of Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen. Distortion means to exaggerate and exceed in height; contention means to demand of others with excessive strictness; aloofness means to stand apart to the point of defiance; perversity means to strike with violence to the point of ferocity. Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen both exhibited these four traits—all of which disrupt the natural order, shatter harmony, and are ultimately the people who have lost their true nature and disordered their essence.

Driven to this, goodness becomes too much for rewards to supply, and evil too much for punishments to restrain. Thus, even the vastness of the world is insufficient for rewards and punishments. Those who rule the world are ceaselessly occupied with them, constantly chasing their traces. How could they have leisure to settle into the natural conditions of their nature and destiny? To settle the natural conditions of nature and destiny, one must set aside rewards and punishments, preserve and tolerate, and only then can the world’s nature be realized."

Moreover: "Delight in beauty is excess in form; delight in music is excess in sound; delight in benevolence is disorder in virtue; delight in righteousness is perversion of principle; delight in ritual is competition in technique; delight in music is competition in excess; delight in sagacity is competition in artifice; delight in knowledge is competition in fault-finding. If these eight exist in the world, the natural conditions of nature and destiny may yet be settled; if they vanish, it may yet be so. But when the world cannot settle the natural conditions of nature and destiny, these eight begin to carve, coil, and entangle, throwing the world into chaos. Yet the world then begins to honor and cherish them—how profound is the world’s delusion! Is this not far more than a mere error?"

To cast them aside, then—must one fast and purify oneself to speak of them, kneel and sit to present them, drum and sing to dance for them? What would I be doing in such a case?

Thus, when the noble person cannot but govern the world, nothing compares to non-action. Only through non-action can the natural conditions of nature and destiny be settled. Therefore, one who values their person above governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their person above governing the world may be charged with the world. Thus, if the noble person can but refrain from disturbing their five viscera, refrain from flaunting their keen hearing and clear sight, remain still as a corpse yet manifest like a dragon, silent as an abyss yet thunderous as a storm, move as a spirit yet follow heaven’s course, and act with effortless non-action—then the myriad things will rise and fall like steam. What leisure would I then have to govern the world?

If one must preserve these eight, one cannot fully follow the natural course—hence the state of being coiled and constricted, like a choked sack. To fail to relinquish them is already an error; to then exalt them as noble is even more deluded. It is not merely that they pass away like a lodged guest, but that they are treasured and esteemed in this way. Non-action does not mean clasping hands in silence; it means each following its own nature, so that one’s life and destiny are at peace. The "unavoidable" is not forced by threats or punishments; it is simply embracing the Dao, holding to simplicity, and entrusting oneself to the inevitable—thus the world finds peace of its own accord. If one轻身以赴刑, abandoning oneself to die for things, then even one’s own person cannot be at peace—how could the world be governed? Without unraveling, without flaunting—unraveling and flaunting cause harm. In movement and stillness, speech and silence, one maintains no fixed intent, but entrusts all to nature. The spirit moves in accord with things, heaven follows principle in its course—like drifting dust that stirs of itself, one simply follows the natural way.

As Lü’s commentary states: If the world does not preserve the true conditions of life and destiny, then what is called keen hearing, clear sight, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, sageliness, and wisdom—all are not in their proper state, and one cannot avoid disordering virtue and perverting ritual. Whether these eight exist or perish, one can say they bring no benefit or harm.

The true essence is carved into fragments yet never made whole, bound into scrolls yet never unfurled—piled in sorrowful heaps yet never guarded, knotted in tangles yet never undone. All these disorder the world, yet people revere them, cherish them, speak of them with fasting and solemnity, drum and sing to them in dance, believing the world’s ultimate truth lies therein. The age has been deluded for so long—what can I do?

To govern the world truly arises from necessity, not choice; to act through non-action—why then should I not value and cherish this body, offering it for the world’s sake? Only thus can one be entrusted with the world. To value is not to treat the self lightly; to cherish is not to endanger the self. Entrustment is like entrusting the body, lodging is like lodging a thing—thus value becomes weight, cherishing becomes care, entrustment becomes burden, lodging becomes commitment.

Without unraveling the five viscera, one cannot guard against excess; without flaunting benevolence and righteousness, keen hearing and clear sight cannot be restrained from attachment. In stillness, one abides like a corpse; in activity, one appears like a dragon—such appearances arise from non-action. In profound silence, thunderous voices emerge—such sounds arise from wordlessness. When the spirit moves, response follows; when heaven follows, things come unbidden. Thus, in effortless non-action, the myriad things pile like steaming grain—steaming grain is the breath of things piling upon one another. The myriad things return to this as dust gathers of itself—what leisure then remains to govern the world?

Following the root—[the "steaming grain" of the myriad things denotes how all are encompassed within our nurturing life, like steam accumulating to ripen]—Cui Qu asked Lao Dan, "If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be safeguarded?"

Lao Dan replied, "Take care not to agitate the human heart. The human heart presses downward yet strives upward; between high and low, it is imprisoned and slain. Supple and yielding, it is yet hard and strong; sharp and incisive, it is carved and polished. When hot, it scorches like fire; when cold, it congeals like ice. In the space between a bow and a rise, it twice brushes against the bounds beyond the four seas. At rest, it is abyssal and still; in motion, it hangs like heaven. Proud and unbridled—can anything compare to the human heart?

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Yao and Shun thus wore their thighs bare of flesh and their shins bare of hair to nourish the forms of the world, fretting over their five viscera to enact benevolence and righteousness, straining their blood and qi to model laws and standards—yet still, they could not prevail. Yao then banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei, and consigned Gong Gong to Youdu—this was his failure to master the world.

By the time it reached the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great turmoil. Below were Jie and Zhi; above were Zeng and Shi; Confucians and Mohists arose in full force. Joy and anger bred mutual suspicion; foolishness and wisdom deceived one another; good and ill vied in reproach; falsehood and truth mocked each other—and thus the world declined. Great virtue diverged, and natures and destinies scattered. The world prized knowledge, and the common people exhausted themselves in pursuit. Thus it was."

Axes and saws shaped them, inked cords and marking lines cut them down, hammers and chisels split them open—thus the world fell into utter chaos, its spine broken. The fault lay in disturbing the human heart. Therefore, the worthy withdrew to dwell beneath towering cliffs and cavernous crags, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled in dread within their ancestral halls.

In this age, those condemned to death lie piled one upon another; those bound in wooden yokes press shoulder to shoulder; those subjected to punishment and execution stand in full view. Yet the Confucians and Mohists now stretch forth their toes and brandish their arms amid the fetters and shackles—ah, how extreme! Their shamelessness knows no bounds. How extreme indeed! I know not whether sagely wisdom is not itself the crossbeam and cangue’s mortise, whether benevolence and righteousness are not themselves the fetters and chisels’ tenon.

How do I know that Zeng and Shi are not the war cries of Jie and Zhi? Thus it is said: Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.

The blade wounds, the halter strangles. To hang and yearn for the lofty, to admire the distant, is to extend and stretch. The inked cord and marking line execute and correct. "Spine-broken" describes trampling and treading upon one another. The *hengyang* is the long restraint that binds neck and shins; the *jiexi* is its crossbeam. "Stretching forth their toes" means their soles barely touch the ground; "brandishing their arms" means their hands and feet both rise as they speak. A *haoshi* is an arrow that whistles in flight—*Pu* says it is a great cry.

Guo’s commentary: To disturb is to wound their innate goodness; to push them down is to provoke their ascent; to urge them forward is to incite their defiance—so easily are they swayed. Only when there is no pushing down or urging forward can they be secure. If one can be yielding and supple, even the rigid and strong will soften. The scorching heat of wildfire and the freezing cold of solid ice both arise from the accumulation of joy and anger. If one neither carves nor polishes, preserving one’s natural simplicity, how can there be such extremes of ice and fire?

To bow and rise again is to sway the customs of all beneath heaven. Still them, and they become like a deep abyss; stir them, and they soar bound to the heavens. The human heart’s transformations know no bounds. If left to follow its course, it becomes still and flows freely; if bound and restrained, it stretches and collapses in arrogance. Such arrogance is an unstoppable force.

The Yellow Emperor did not act for benevolence and righteousness; he simply merged with things, and the traces of benevolence and righteousness appeared of themselves. Once these traces appeared, later ages inevitably followed them—thus the Yellow Emperor’s traces disturbed the world. The reputations of Yao and Shun are but their traces. I lodge in these traces, yet the traces are not me. Thus, the alarmed grow ever more alarmed with each generation, and their traces grow ever coarser. Coarseness and subtlety are but the smooth and rugged paths of one’s own making. Does the traveler ever change his feet?

Thus, the sage is one, yet there are differences between Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu. These distinctions are but the names of their times and ages; they do not suffice to name the sage’s true reality. Therefore, Yao and Shun—were they merely Yao and Shun? Though there may be traces of benevolence and righteousness, the appearances of distress and sorrow, that which underlies these traces remains whole.

From mutual suspicion in joy and anger to mutual mockery in falsehood and truth, none can equal the self-contentment of one who attains it. When great virtue diverges, small differences arise and do not stop at mere division. Knowledge is boundless, yet people covet it, so there is no way to satisfy their demands. Thus, axes and saws, hammers and chisels carve and shape their natures and destinies, bringing them to this pass. If one instead follows nature and abides in what is fitting, the worthy and foolish will each embrace their true feelings, the noble and base will each tread their proper places, and ruler and minister, high and low, will all attain their ultimate end—then the world will know no trouble.

These traces disturb the world’s heart, setting it galloping without cease. Thus, those of middling wisdom and below all adorn their natures outwardly to delude the masses. They hate the upright and revile the correct; factions gather and follow one another. Those who embrace authenticity lose their defenses, while those who exalt falsity seize the reins. Thus, rulers worry above, and the people suffer below.

This is the calamity wrought by rotten scholars clinging to traces. Instead of discarding traces and returning to unity, they brandish their arms and employ traces to govern traces—truly, their shamelessness knows no bounds. The *hengyang* uses *jiexi* as its crossbeam; fetters and shackles use chisels and tenons as their tools. Sagely wisdom and benevolent righteousness are far removed from the traces of crime. The farther the traces from crime, the more people esteem them; the more they esteem them, the more deceit arises. Where deceit arises, instruments to control villainy are never lacking.

Thus, discard what is esteemed, and deceit will not arise; the *hengyang* and fetters will be abolished. What need is there for chisels, tenons, crossbeams, or mortises? A *haoshi* is a fierce arrow—this means Zeng and Shi are the sharp tools of Jie and Zhi.

Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and remove what disturbs.

Guo’s commentary: To push the heart downward is to confine it like a prisoner; to urge it upward is to enrage and kill it. To pare and wound it is to leave it maimed and incomplete; to carve and polish it is to adorn it with ornament and strip it of substance—thus the qi of yin and yang is thrown into disorder. When it lies still, it stiffens; when it rises, it collapses in arrogance. To bind and restrain it, forcing it into closure and constraint, is to provoke the response of the unworthy heart.

Benevolence and righteousness are internal, so they distress the five viscera; laws and standards are external, so they strain the blood and qi. Yet when benevolence and righteousness are practiced, deceit and falsity arise; when laws and standards are displayed, violence and chaos erupt. Even Yao’s perfect governance could not avoid punishing the Four Fiends—how much less could the Three Dynasties and later ages?

"Condemned" means cut off; "executed" means disgraced.

Deputy Ink:

When the human heart is even slightly suppressed by others, it loses its resolve, its spirit withers, and it sinks. When it is even slightly spurred onward, it aspires to lofty heights and gazes into distant realms—up and down without constancy, rising and falling at the whim of others. Bound as if imprisoned, it trembles in fear; driven as if to slaughter, it will take this tranquil, plain, and unadorned heart and transform it into a false, artful guise, flattering those who surpass it. All the integrity and principles one has cultivated in life are carved and polished away, nearly exhausted. Such is the intent of those who dread suppression and crave advancement.

Speak of its restlessness, and it burns like scorching fire; speak of its trepidation, and it chills like congealing ice. Speak of its swiftness, and in the space between a single bow and rise, it twice reaches beyond the four seas. When it has yet to stir, its stillness is like an abyss; once stirred, it soars as distant as heaven, as drifting as clouds—heaven and abyss utterly sundered. Such is the indignant, perverse, arrogant, and unbridled state of the human heart.

Yao and Shun toiled, Tang and Wu waged war, hoping to restrain it with benevolence and righteousness. Yet once the door of benevolence and righteousness is opened, those below bear the names of cruelty and injustice as Jie and Zhi, while those above gain the reputations of practicing benevolence and righteousness as Zeng and Shi. Thus, the Confucians and Mohists each established teachings along these lines: those who agree with them are met with joy, those who differ with anger. Seeing only this, they deem themselves wise; failing to see that, they deem others foolish. What lies with them is good, and they condemn others for its absence; what lies with them is true, and they mock others as absurd. That side has its right and wrong, this side has its right and wrong—and the virtue of profound unity declines, the true nature of life and destiny is lost.

The people, then, exhaust their thoughts and energies, ceaselessly responding to demands—what is called "seeking exhaustion." Adzes, saws, inked cords, mallets, and chisels—all tools of punishment and execution—are employed when benevolence and righteousness are exhausted and penal laws are put to use, an inevitable course. In the end, it drives the worthy to withdraw and flee, leaving the lord of ten thousand chariots burdened with sorrow and isolated. Yet the followers of Confucius and Mozi still cling to their discourses on benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and wisdom, rolling up their sleeves and striving to remedy the crisis. Who realizes that this very crisis arises from benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and wisdom?

The tenons and mortises are the pegs of the pillory; the round tenon and square mortise are what fashion the fetters. Where there are pillories, there must be tenons and mortises; where fetters are made, tenons and mortises must be used—the two depend on each other. This illustrates how benevolence and righteousness inevitably invite transgression and strife, and how Zeng and Shi inevitably rely on Jie and Zhi.

Xu Shizhang said: "Jie and Zhi are the first arrows—like saying dissenting opinions are red banners."

When the Yellow Emperor had reigned as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his decrees circulated throughout the land. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelled upon Mount Kongtong, he went to see him, saying: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask about the essence of the utmost Dao. I wish to draw upon the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition. How may this be done?"

Guangchengzi replied: "What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things; what you wish to govern is the ruin of things. Ever since you began to rule the world, clouds gather before they thicken into rain, grasses and trees wither before they yellow, and the light of the sun and moon grows ever more dim. And with your heart so full of petty cunning, how could you be fit to speak of the utmost Dao?"

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, and spread a mat of white couch grass. After dwelling in seclusion for three months, he went again to seek him. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from the north, crawling on his knees. He bowed twice, prostrated himself, and asked: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask how one may cultivate the body so as to endure long."

Guangchengzi sprang to his feet and said: "Excellent, your question! Come, I will tell you of the utmost Dao. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, hold fast to spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your body, do not stir your essence, and you may live long. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your body—your body will endure long. Be careful within, shut out the outer; much knowledge brings ruin. I will lead you to the source of great brightness, to the origin of utmost yang. I will guide you through the gate of profound obscurity, to the origin of utmost yin. Heaven and Earth have their offices, yin and yang their storehouses. Guard your body carefully, and things will flourish of themselves. I preserve the One and abide in harmony. Thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never decayed."

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and prostrated himself, saying: "Guangchengzi is indeed Heaven!"

Guangchengzi said: "Come, I will tell you. That which is boundless, men all deem finite; that which is unfathomable, men all deem limited. Those who attain my Dao are emperors above and kings below; those who lose my Dao see light above and become earth below. Now the hundred creatures all arise from earth and return to earth. Therefore, I will leave you and enter the gate of the boundless, to wander in the wilds of the infinite. I share the light of the sun and moon, I abide with Heaven and Earth as constant. Let me vanish—what is distant to me? Let me fade—what is obscure to me? Men may all perish, yet I alone endure."

Here the essence stands firm, the clans gather—yet before they gather, rain speaks of scant moisture; before yellowing, leaves fall, speaking of excess killing qi. The shearing, fawning guise—startled, they rise abruptly. Creatures will naturally mature; if one does not govern the world, all things will assume their own tasks and mature.

One thousand two hundred years: Li Chunfeng’s *Register of Things* states that one thousand two hundred years is called a "great cycle," also termed the "lesser reckoning of yin and yang." The hundred creatures: Sima [Qian] says they are the hundred things.

"Mín" (泯) means to merge; "hūn" (昏) means the absence of mind—both denote the state of no-mind.

Guo’s commentary:
To inquire into the essence of the supreme Dao may be called "substance." Not allowing things to be as they are but seeking to govern them—this is destruction. If all men cultivate themselves and do not govern the world, the world will be well-governed. Thus it is praised.

"Yǎomíng" (窈冥), "hūnmò" (昏默)—all denote utter nothingness. Why do Laozi and Zhuangzi repeatedly speak of "nothing"? To clarify that what gives birth to things is no-thing, and things arise of themselves. They arise of themselves—not for the sake of arising. Then what agency is there in their arising for oneself?

Forget seeing and yet see of oneself; forget hearing and yet hear of oneself—then spirit is not disturbed, and form does not deviate. Do not labor your form, do not agitate your essence; let it move of itself, and thus remain at ease, tranquil, and undying. All this is following one’s nature in movement, hence long life.

Guard within to preserve your true [nature]; close without to maintain your allotted place. To know no bounds is to fail. To fathom the origin of yin and yang is to ascend into the great brightness, to enter the gate of the profound and obscure.

"Having offices, having storehouses"—this speaks only of allowing things to take their course. To take the utmost of one’s nature and destiny, to reach the ultimate of long life—this is all. Only when the body does not perish can one extend to other things.

Boundless and unfathomable, yet men deem them finite and limited—this is merely seeing one transformation. The titles of emperor and king rise and fall with the times, yet in attaining the Dao of adaptability to respond to the boundless, they are one. To lose the boundless Dao is to cling to one partial view and fail to harmonize above and below, hence the differing minds of high and low. Earth is without mind; born from no-mind, one should return to guard no-mind and wander alone.

To enter the boundless, to roam the infinite, is to move with transformation. To share the light of the sun and moon, to abide with Heaven and Earth as constant—all is entrusted to spontaneity. "Mín" and "hūn" mean that the coming and going of things are all unperceived. "Alone enduring" means taking death and life as one body, so there is nowhere that is not existence.

Lü’s commentary:
Above Kongtong, where there is no-thing and great passage—there the Dao is the uncarved block of nameless simplicity, hence "substance." Yin and yang are the dispersal of the Dao, hence "destruction." Cloud-qi does not wait for clans to gather before it spreads into desolation—this is not assisting their natural course but rather impairing it.

Dwelling in seclusion for three months, attaining utmost purity, following the wind to advance, tracing the root to seek it—only the Dao can govern the body and bring long life. This is truly inquiring into its essence.

"Yǎomíng" means formless; words cannot discuss it, thoughts cannot reach it. Yet there is something called "essence"—if it can be known or spoken, it is not the ultimate. Only when utterly dark and silent does one reach the ultimate of the Dao. This speaks of the Dao’s body.

Without seeing, without hearing—only then can one attain long life and enter the Dao. Embrace spirit with correctness, and form will not seek correctness yet be correct of itself. It must be still, must be pure—speaking of not disturbing it with turbidity. Form not labored remains whole; essence not agitated returns. Only then can one attain long life.

Spirit has no form yet attaches to things. If it does not attach to things but returns to nothing, where will it abide without seeing or knowing? Not guarding its form—where will it go? Guard within to block its openings; close without to shut its gates—this is the way to nurture and preserve spirit. The opposite is excess knowledge leading to failure.

Before men know the Dao, they are confined to yin and yang and never reach its origin. Without seeing, without hearing, without knowing, one ascends into the great brightness, enters the gate of the profound and obscure. Attaining this and exhausting it, one knows Heaven and Earth have their offices, and these are their offices; yin and yang have their storehouses, and these are their storehouses.

In this, guard your body carefully—things will mature of themselves. Why seek externally? The Yellow Emperor was further told that what was called "no seeing, no hearing" is the body of the Dao. As for its function: no seeing is how one sees of oneself; no hearing is how one hears of oneself; no knowing is how one knows of oneself.

The Dao as a thing is boundless and unfathomable, yet to stop at no seeing, hearing, or knowing is to take the boundless as finite, the unfathomable as limited. Those who attain the Dao become emperors and kings because their spirit and brightness give rise to emperors and kings. Those who lose the Dao see light and become earth because their form does not transcend the realm of illumination, covering, and bearing.

The hundred creatures are born from earth and return to earth because of their form. Thus, I will leave you, enter the boundless, and roam the infinite—those who deem this finite and limited do not know me. Sharing the light of the sun and moon, their brightness does not cease; abiding with Heaven and Earth as constant, their duration is endless.

"When I mín"—one does not know it is "when." "Far from me hūn"—one does not know it is "far." Men all perish, yet I alone endure—seeking within myself, I do not know what thing can bring one to this.

Of the myriad creatures, man is the most spiritually endowed. How many transformations does creation undergo to produce a human? And of humans, how many are wise and perspicacious enough to attain this? Yet they do not diligently pursue it—thus those who treasure kindness do not weary of speaking of it repeatedly.

】Su Zizhan【 annotates: In the *Classic of Mountains*, the Master of Broad Accomplishment governed the hexagrams *Tai*, *Yi*, *Zhun*, and *Meng*, directing the movements of the sun and moon—truly the Perfected One of antiquity and the teacher of the Yellow Emperor. That creatures possess substance and that they decay—such is their nature, for their essence lies in desire, while long life is sought externally through nurturing the people and fostering the multitude.

Is not immortality the true reality of things, and that which is called "nurturing the people and fostering the multitude" merely the surplus of the Dao? Clouds gather without waiting to cluster, and rain falls; plants and trees wither without waiting to yellow—this shows that even the essence of Heaven and Earth cannot sustain the depletion wrought by intentional effort. Thus, the omen of decline and ruin first appears in the sun and moon; if one observes with the body, the ears and eyes are the first to ail.

The Perfected One and the flatterer are like grain and weeds: where grain is sown, though the soil be barren, weeds do not grow; where weeds are sown, though the field be fertile, grain does not grow. Now, those who wish to study the Dao yet inquire with insincerity—how can the seed of the Dao take root in such false and obsequious soil? Dwelling in seclusion for three months, the mind of putting others before oneself has no place to act, and thus their questions sink into obscurity and silence. This is the method of attaining the Dao, yet it is not the Dao itself.

Those who study the Dao fear its dissipation and falsity; thus, the profound obscurity is the means to achieve unity, and the deep silence is the means to preserve authenticity. Below, another line is drawn to instruct: all are words of truth—"see nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness" is non-action; "the heart knows nothing" is non-thought; "be still, be pure, neither toil the body nor disturb the essence" is non-desire. When these three are complete, form and spirit unite; when form and spirit unite, long life is attained. If one is not cautious within and does not close off without, form and spirit separate.

As for the source of utmost yang and utmost yin, these two function like the sun and moon, water and fire—through them, one refines, transforms, solidifies qi, and congeals things. Establishing the root of long life in profound obscurity and deep silence, eliminating its harms through non-action, non-thought, and non-desire, and further employing utmost yin and utmost yang to solidify and congeal—this is all that is needed in one’s affairs. Heaven and Earth have their offices and govern themselves for me; yin and yang have their treasuries and store themselves for me. The task lies in oneself, while completion lies in them.

Things inherently have no end; their division is their completion, and their completion is their fulfillment.

Destruction—things have never truly died. Thus, long life is the inherent nature of things, not something I alone can achieve. I merely preserve unity and dwell in harmony, so I do not perceive their division, completion, or destruction. Do others all perish while I alone endure? Those who speak of studying the Dao—few indeed can wholly let their "others" die while preserving only their "I."

What can be seen, spoken of, abandoned, or grasped is the "other"; it is not the "I." What cannot be seen, spoken of, abandoned, or grasped—that is the true "I." Draw near to this, and you are enlightened; distance yourself, and you are foolish. Attain this, and you attain the Dao. Thus, when others all perish while I alone endure, this is what is meant.

*Following the root*:
Those who proceed reach their end. The "offices" are like government bureaus; the "treasuries" are like storehouses; "things" are like the contents within these bureaus and storehouses. Born, they rise to behold the light of sun and moon; dead, they descend to become earth. The union of twisted silk is dim and obscure. What I call "near" is the realm that approaches me—it is the gate of the boundless, the wilderness of the infinite. What I call "far" is the world that turns away from me—it is "depart from you." This is to say, after this departure, will the immortal realm that once drew near to me remain as inseparable as twisted silk? Will the world that now recedes from me vanish into obscurity, never to be seen again? For those who have not attained the Dao, do all perish while I alone endure? The three instances of "乎" convey a mournful pity for the world.

Cloud General was traveling east when he passed the branches of the *fuyao* tree and happened upon Hong Meng, who was just then slapping his thigh and leaping about in play. Cloud General, seeing him, halted abruptly and stood in astonishment, saying, "Old sir, who are you? What are you doing here?" Hong Meng continued slapping his thigh and leaping without pause. Cloud General said, "I wish to ask you something." Hong Meng looked up at Cloud General and said, "Hmm?" Cloud General said, "Heaven’s qi is disharmonious, Earth’s qi is pent up, the six qi are unbalanced, and the four seasons are out of order. Now I wish to blend the essence of the six qi to nurture all living things. What should I do?" Hong Meng slapped his thigh, leaped, and shook his head, saying, "I do not know! I do not know!" Cloud General could not press further.

Three years later, he traveled east again and passed through the wilds of Song, where he once more encountered Hong Meng. Cloud General was overjoyed, hastened forward, and said, "Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and said, "I wish to hear your teaching, Hong Meng." Hong Meng said, "Wandering aimlessly, I know not what I seek; roaming wildly, I know not where I go. I drift and observe the unexpected—what do I know?" Cloud General said, "I, too, thought myself wild and aimless, yet the people followed wherever I went. I could not escape them, and now they imitate me. I wish to hear a single word from you." Hong Meng said, "You disrupt the warp of Heaven, oppose the nature of things, and thwart the mysterious workings of Heaven, preventing its completion. Beasts scatter from their herds, and birds cry out all night. Disaster reaches the grasses and trees, calamity befalls even the insects. Alas! This is the fault of those who govern men." Cloud General said, "Then what should I do?" Hong Meng said, "Ah, how poisonous! Rise lightly, rise lightly!"

Return, then! Cloud General said, "I have encountered the trials of Heaven—may I ask one final word?" Hong Meng replied, "Ah! Nurture your heart-mind. Dwell in emptiness, do nothing, and things will transform of themselves. Dissolve your form, expel your cleverness, and forget all distinctions with things—merge into the Great Sameness. Let the primal qi blend and vanish, unbind your heart-mind, release your spirit, and abide in utter non-attachment. Then the ten thousand things, drifting like clouds, will each return to their root. Each returns to its root, yet none knows it. Profoundly, profoundly murky—throughout life, never depart from this. If one claims to know it, one has already departed from it. Ask not its name, peer not into its conditions—things thus arise of themselves."

Cloud General said, "Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me, shown me silence, and through my own seeking, I have now attained it." He bowed twice, touched his head to the ground, rose, and departed.

The demeanor of rising and sitting in serene ease—yet one may still chafe at an inability to utterly dissolve and flow freely. Thus, one sends the heart-mind home: when use injures it, then to nurture the heart-mind is precisely not to employ it. Let principle and things alike be neither held in mind nor deliberately entrusted to spontaneity—then non-doing will transform of itself.

To merge into the Great Sameness is to be without boundary with things. To sit in oblivion, entrusting oneself to solitude—this is true return, for only in chaos and unknowing, allowing the self to return of itself, can one abide lifelong without departing from the root. To know and yet seek return is already to stray from return. To question, to peer—is to lose the self-arising. To know and yet not remain silent is ever to lose oneself.

Lü’s Commentary:
I do not claim this to be true knowing. All people have their seeking and their going; I alone know neither seeking nor going—simply abiding in unknowing. Though one may wander, one remains bound, as if shackled; yet when I observe the true nature of all under heaven, it is nothing more than this: the ten thousand things arise together, and I observe their return. In returning, there is no delusion—what more do I know? To deem oneself wild and unrestrained is still to act; to let the people roam free is still not non-doing. Heaven is non-doing; things are unknowing. To know, to act—is to disorder heaven’s warp, to contravene the nature of things, and thus fail to complete the mysterious work of heaven.

The year has its mysterious completion—this is the winter solstice. The month has its mysterious completion—this is the dark of the moon.

The day has its mysterious completion—this is midnight. And man, too, has his mysterious completion. Those of old who sought the abode of the true qi, preserving their spirit and beautifying their root, none failed to know this—though none spoke of it openly. Now, that disasters befall birds, beasts, and crawling things is simply due to the error of not governing through non-doing. To administer poison to cure illness is one thing; to govern through non-doing is like administering poison where no illness exists—how perilous! Return, then, to the root.

All men possess a mind bent on completion, yet it lies only in self-nurturance. In self-nurturance, there is nothing to be done, and things transform of themselves. When the bodily form dissolves, one knows not the six members; when keen perception is cast aside, one knows not the ears and eyes. Order lies within me; things lie without. The vast and boundless qi awaits things in its emptiness—when I and things forget one another, we merge with the vast and boundless. Then the heart is untied, the spirit released, and all is serene, without soul. This is how one abides in the Way of non-doing.

When the ten thousand things are just arising, I know them not; when I let things return to the root, I know not myself. Thus, chaos and vastness become one, and to the end of life, one never departs from it—without inquiry, without prying—and things arise of themselves. When one is without knowing, one knows not that one is without knowing. To say, “This is called ‘unknowing’” is to inquire after its name; to say, “Is this truly unknowing?” is to pry into its nature. It is like a thing just beginning to grow—if one picks at its root to examine it, none can grow. Heaven’s way of creating things is no different.

The common people all delight in others being like themselves and detest others being different from themselves. They desire those who are like them and do not desire those who are different—this is to take being part of the crowd as one’s heart. Yet how can one who takes being part of the crowd as their heart ever stand apart from the crowd? Relying on the crowd to secure what one has heard is not as good as the crowd’s many skills. Those who would rule others’ states grasp at the advantages of the Three Kings while blind to the dangers—this is to gamble with others’ states. How many gambles do not end in the ruin of others’ states? For every one that preserves another’s state, ten thousand and more are lost. How lamentable that those who hold land do not understand this!

Those who hold land possess great things. Those who possess great things cannot be ruled by things, and only by not being ruled by things can they rule things. How clear it is that those who are ruled by things are not things themselves! This is not merely about governing the world. Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces, going alone and coming alone—this is called "possessing alone." Those who possess alone are called the most noble.

The teachings of the great person are like form to shadow, sound to echo. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what lies in their heart, matching the world. They dwell without direction, move without fixed course, taking you by the hand to return to what disturbs you, roaming without bounds. Entering and exiting without sides, with the sun they have no beginning. They discourse on form and body, merging with the Great Unity. In the Great Unity, there is no end—where in no-end can one find "having"? Those who see "having" are the gentlemen of old; those who see "non-having" are friends of Heaven and Earth.

Guo’s commentary: The heart desires to stand apart from the crowd, to lead the many. The crowd all take standing apart as their heart, and thus they are the common people. If I too desired to stand apart, I would be no different from the crowd and could not surpass them. The crowd all take surpassing one another as their heart, yet I alone go nowhere without being the same—thus I am vastly different from the crowd and become their master. What I alone have heard is not as numerous as the crowd’s many skills, so I rely on the crowd to be at peace. If I did not rely on the crowd, the crowd’s thousands and tens of thousands would all be my enemies.

Those who would rule others’ states do not rely on the crowd’s self-governance but impose their own will—this is merely seeking the advantages of the Three Kings in ruling things while blind to the dangers of imposing their will. How could the Three Kings have gained their advantages by imposing their will? They relied on the world’s self-governance and left it at that. The world and I rely on one another to succeed. Now, if one alone controls the world, the world is blocked—how could one alone be unobstructed? Thus, one’s own body is not preserved, and the ten thousand regions suffer ruin.

One who cannot use things is used by things—this is to be a thing oneself. How can one who is a thing rule things? Unable to rule things, one is not fit to possess great things. Those who use things are not used by things. Not being used by things, they are not things. Not being things, they enable the things of the world to each attain their own. Relying on the world’s self-governance, they set the ten thousand things free without exhaustion.

People all distinguish themselves, yet I alone roam with the crowd—this is the one who goes alone and comes alone. Only this "possessing alone" can truly be called "possessing alone." To merge with the crowd in profound sameness is not to seek nobility from the crowd, yet the crowd cannot but honor them—this is the most noble. If one clings to one’s partial views and takes being uniquely different as one’s heart, then even if one aligns with a single purpose, one is but a thing among the common—no "possessing alone." Not yet able to possess alone, yet coveting rank and emblems, seizing what is not one’s due—how could the crowd follow? Thus, this is not the most noble.

The hearts of the common people are like form and sound; the teachings of the great person are like echo and shadow. What mind does the great person hold toward the world? Merely that of echo and shadow following form and sound. They allow each being’s inner inclinations to fully express themselves—those who ask become the host, those who respond become the counterpart. Without sound or silence, they await all things; without fixed direction, they turn and transform with things. Spontaneously stirring, they move of themselves. To guide the ten thousand things back to their self-moving nature—this is the perfection of non-action. Moving with transformation, they have no beginning; merging with the profound, they have no outward sign; advancing with daily renewal, they have no origin.

Those whose bodily forms unite with the Great Harmony resemble heaven and earth in appearance. If one clings to a self, one cannot achieve the Great Harmony. The greatest difficulty in the world lies in the self. Once the self is gone, the myriad existents need no longer be seen as existent. Those who perceive existence merely praise its name; those who perceive non-existence allow it to arise alone.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The Dao’s non-action is natural; not only should the ruler embody it, but those who assist the ruler with the Dao must also rely on the multitude to bring tranquility, avoiding affairs in a state governed for the people. One person’s knowledge cannot match the collective skills of the many. To take sole responsibility for governing a state for others is to risk ruin—survival would be mere luck. The rulers and ministers of the Three Dynasties once found this advantageous, but later ages have often seen it as a calamity. Those who seek to govern for others grasp at its benefits while ignoring its harms.

When the Yellow Emperor asked Guangcheng and Yao met the Four Masters, all regarded the "great thing" as a peril. They sought to clarify that what I embody is the Dao—beyond the Dao, there is nothing, hence it is called "possessing alone." The great person’s teachings follow like echo and shadow after form and sound, never taking the lead in the world—this is how they serve as the counterpart.

Abiding in no-sound, they remain still and unmoving; acting without fixed direction, they have never set boundaries. Thus, they guide the world back to its spontaneous stirring, where stillness is not enforced—this is called "the ten thousand things arising together," allowing me to observe their return and store the world within the world. Therefore, they roam through the beginning and end of things, unbound by directions that could obstruct or times that could confine.

The *Song Lun* speaks: speech arises from non-speech. The body is form; form is an image of the formless. Thus, one achieves the Great Harmony and dissolves the self. Without self, how could there be existence? Gentle and benevolent, this is called the noble person. The sage’s way of harmonizing with others means that those who perceive existence may be called noble, but those who perceive non-existence transcend even the title of "friend of heaven and earth"—for what they share with others defies naming.

---

**Supplementary Notes:**
"Relying on the multitude to bring tranquility" means grounding one’s own knowledge in the multitude’s perceptions and insights—thus, one’s limitations compared to the many skills of the people become even more apparent. To exalt benevolence and righteousness, to delight in sagacity and wisdom, is but a common view.

"Guiding you" means leading the world toward the Dao.

Returning, it weaves and wanders without end—this coming, this going—speaking of its comings and goings as free and unrestrained, stirring and provoking without limit. Emerging and entering without side or support, it goes alone, comes alone, dependent on nothing. Since it has no end, how could it have a beginning? Since it has no beginning, how could it have an end? Thus it is said: "With the sun, it has no beginning." Here, the bodily form cannot hinder it, and it merges with the Great Harmony. This is what is meant by "form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth."

In the Great Harmony, seeking what is one’s own cannot be attained—how could there be existence? Those who perceive existence are the noble persons of former times: the rulers and ministers of the Three Dynasties who governed with benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music all belong to this. Those who perceive non-existence are friends of heaven and earth, and none but those who are without self can partake in this.

That which is lowly yet cannot be neglected is the myriad things. That which is humble yet cannot be disregarded is the common people. That which is hidden yet cannot be left undone is affairs. That which is coarse yet cannot be omitted is the law. That which is distant yet cannot be abandoned is righteousness. That which is intimate yet cannot be narrowed is benevolence. That which is measured yet cannot be left unaccumulated is ritual. That which is centered yet cannot be left unexalted is virtue. That which is one yet cannot be left unchanged is the Dao. That which is numinous yet cannot be left unenacted is heaven.

Thus, the sage observes heaven yet does not assist, achieves virtue yet is not burdened, emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme, meets benevolence yet does not rely, refines righteousness yet does not accumulate, responds to ritual yet does not conceal, engages with affairs yet does not refuse, aligns with the law yet is not disordered, depends on the people yet does not slight them, and follows the myriad things yet does not abandon them. For what is there that can be done, yet cannot be left undone?

Those who do not understand heaven are not pure in virtue. Those who do not comprehend the Dao have no means by which they may act. Those who do not understand the Dao—how lamentable! What is the Dao? There is the Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity. That which is without action yet revered is the Dao of heaven. That which acts yet is burdened is the Dao of humanity. The ruler follows the Dao of heaven; the minister follows the Dao of humanity. The distance between the Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity is vast—this cannot be left unexamined.

Guo’s Commentary:
To govern by following their nature and entrusting them is order; to reverse their nature and oppress them is chaos. That the people and things are base and lowly stems from their inability to be entrusted. Thus, entrusting the lowly makes them noble, and following the base makes them exalted—this is the inevitable sign. Affairs are concealed in that which is distant, hence they are hidden there; each acts for itself, hence they cannot be left undone. One must only follow and entrust them.

The law is the trace of wondrous affairs—how can one, because the trace is coarse, fail to set forth the wondrous affair? Only by abiding in it does one thereby become distant from the near; then, suffering from partiality, one broadens it and calls it benevolence. As for ritual propriety, its trouble lies in being bound to one thing. If one embodies it in every thing, it accumulates and becomes all-encompassing. In affairs that are lowly, though they may hit the mark, it is not virtue. In affairs that are difficult, though they may be unified, it is not the Dao—how much less when they are not unified?

To hold to an intention and not act, though one be spirit-like, is not of heaven—how much less when one is not spirit-like? Observing heaven without assisting, one simply follows what is already so; virtue is not burdened, for it naturally accords with the lofty. Emerging from the Dao without scheming, one does not scheme yet is unified—this is why it is easy. Guarding benevolence without relying on it, for to rely on it is not to broaden it. Following one’s nature and dwelling in the distant is not accumulation. Naturally responding to ritual is not through avoidance. In affairs, one engages with principle; ability or inability is entrusted to oneself. Responding to movement by moving, there is no refusal or yielding. Governing the coarse with the wondrous, hence there is no disorder. Relying on the people to act for themselves is not to use them lightly. Following things and entrusting them is not to abandon their root.

How could one act with the aim of sufficiency? One’s body embodies this act, hence it cannot be stopped. Not understanding the natural leads to action, and with action, virtue is not pure. Unable to empty oneself and await things, one loses harmony in every affair—this is the lamentable state of those who do not understand the Dao.

The Dao of heaven resides above and entrusts the myriad things to act for themselves. The Dao of humanity is burdened by action and cannot follow its own attainment. The ruler aligns with the Dao of heaven, which is the same as heaven’s entrusting of things—naturally dwelling above them. The minister aligns with the Dao of humanity, each attending to their entrusted task. The ruler entrusts non-action and delegates to the hundred officials; the hundred officials have their respective duties, and the ruler does not intervene. Both, through non-action, attain their own fulfillment: the ruler’s Dao is ease, the minister’s Dao is toil. The difference between toil and ease cannot be spoken of on the same day. Without examination, the positions of ruler and minister become disordered.

**General Observations by the Humble Observer:**
When the noble person, out of necessity, oversees and governs the world, nothing is better than non-action. Thus, they cherish preserving the people and forgiving the multitude, never harboring a deliberate mind for governance. Therefore, the people of the world do not stray from their nature, and their virtue does not shift. Those who stand above the people maintain balanced joy and anger, and their rewards and punishments are just. This is because they follow the world’s self-governance and do not labor in governing it. Hence, the people are easy to follow, and the law is not obstructed.

Later rulers of the world lost the essential means to assist the age and nurture the people, instead focusing solely on rewards and punishments. Above, they were entangled in the disputes of Confucians, Mohists, Zeng, and Shi; below, they were bound by cangues, pillories, fetters, and shackles. Those who governed could not bear the toil, and the people had nowhere to place their hands and feet. Yet they still believed that benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom were sufficient to grasp the world’s sentiments, revering and cherishing them, passing them down through families and enacting them in states, never realizing they were tools to obstruct the people. This is why they wished to utterly abandon them.

If one truly heeds these words, then the world’s entrusted affairs and the manifestations of profound thunder lie herein. State governance does not descend into vulgarity, and the people’s hearts do not decay. With unhurried non-action, how would one have the leisure to govern the world?

Next, the questions of Cui and Qu are posed to elicit Lao Dan’s defense, clarifying that the fault in governance lies in disturbing the people’s hearts—this is the origin of cangues, pillories, fetters, and shackles, and the reason why Jie and Zhi profited from them. Thus, the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao from Kong Tong, who taught him the essentials of embracing the spirit, rectifying the form, clarity, and tranquility for long life: the body is the root, the family and state are secondary. There has never been a case where the body was well-governed yet the state was in chaos.

If today’s rulers of the world could vigorously practice the words of Guang Cheng, the governance of the Three Dynasties would not be difficult to restore. Heaven and earth, the officials, yin and yang—all reside within my non-action. This is the Dao of "Presiding and Forgiving." Hong Meng said: "It will cast off the body, dismiss hearing and sight, guard the root, and not depart"—this is the Dao of governing the self.

At the end of the chapter, the discussion of ruler and minister, ritual and law, leaves little unaddressed. It touches on the distinction between the Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity, which lies in the difference between action and non-action. Though they seem unequal, what arises in the heart and manifests in deeds and undertakings is one and the same.

**Chapter Twelve: Heaven and Earth**
Though heaven and earth are vast, their transformations are uniform. Though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one. Though the people are many, their lord is the ruler. The ruler originates from virtue and is completed by heaven. Thus, it is said: In high antiquity, those who ruled the world practiced non-action—only the virtue of heaven.

Viewing it through the Dao, the rulers of the world are upright. Viewing it through distinctions, the righteousness of ruler and minister is clear. Viewing it through abilities, the officials of the world are well-ordered. Viewing it broadly through the Dao, the responses of the myriad things are complete. Thus, that which penetrates heaven and earth is virtue; that which moves through the myriad things is the Dao. Governing people above is affairs; having skills is technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs; affairs are encompassed by righteousness; righteousness is encompassed by virtue; virtue is encompassed by the Dao; the Dao is encompassed by heaven. Thus, it is said: Those of old who nurtured the world desired nothing, and the world was sufficient; they acted not, and the myriad things were transformed; they were deep and still, and the hundred clans were settled.

The Record says: "Penetrating the One, all affairs are completed." Without deliberate mind, one obtains it, and spirits submit. (The Record’s origin is the original root; it is said to be the work of Laozi.)

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Heaven and earth are uniform in non-action and self-transformation. The myriad things are governed by self-attainment. The world, though of diverse minds, has the mindless as its lord. Taking virtue as its origin, nothing does not attain it. Attainment is self-attainment, hence it attains without gratitude—this is how heaven is completed. With non-action, one entrusts the natural movement; naturally, one is the ruler—is this not so?

Each abiding in their proper place is non-action in the superior position; action is in the inferior position. Officials each attend to their abilities, hence there is order. With non-action, the world responds with non-action. That which penetrates heaven and earth is virtue—it means the myriad things all attain it. That which moves through the myriad things is the Dao—it means the Dao does not obstruct its course, and the myriad things naturally attain their movement.

Governing people above means enabling each person to attain their own affairs. Technique is the peripheral use of the myriad things. The root and branches encompass each other, like the hand and arm embracing one another. When the body is harmonious, the hundred joints are all at ease; when the Dao of heaven is followed, the root and branches are all smooth. Thus, with one non-action, the governance of all is raised.

Lü’s Annotation:
The vastness of heaven and earth encompasses the myriad transformations, yet they have never reached an end. Though they transform, that by which they transform is uniform—without distinction of great or small, beauty or ugliness, long or short—this is precisely that by which they transform. The Dao gives birth to the One, and from it extends to the myriad things; how then could order arise from this? The One means each returns to its root without awareness—this is that by which order arises. Though the people are numerous, their ruler, the lord, originates from virtue, and thus his transformation pervades the uniformity of heaven and earth. When he completes himself in heaven, his governance reverts to the Oneness of the myriad things. These two are both called the Profound.

The ancients who ruled all under heaven practiced non-action, embodying the virtue of heaven alone. Viewed through the Dao, they never spoke, yet their speech was wordless. Could any lord of all under heaven fail to be upright? Viewed through the Dao, in their roles, non-action was lord and action was minister—could the righteousness of lord and minister ever be unclear? Viewed through the Dao, in their abilities, they were without ability yet lacked no ability—could any official fail to be well-governed? Viewed through the Dao in its ubiquity, there is nothing that is not the Dao—could the responses of the myriad things ever be incomplete?

That by which heaven and earth are heaven and earth is nothing more than attaining this. If a person attains this, their virtue communicates with heaven and earth, and the myriad things are none other than their Dao. The Dao as a thing is so great that those above employ it to govern people—then affairs are merely affairs, and if one has any skill, it is merely technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by heaven. When it is encompassed by heaven, how could that which nurtures all under heaven lie among technique, ability, affairs, or action?

Thus, when all under heaven is sufficient, when the hundred clans are settled, it is entirely because they communicate with the One, and what they attain is without intention.

Guan’s Observations:
Heaven and earth are supremely great, and the myriad people supremely numerous. Their governance and transformation are beyond reckoning, yet that which presides over them is the lord—how could the lord’s response to the world be mere chance? Originating from virtue, nothing can depart from it. Completing himself in heaven, people naturally turn toward him. His Dao is subtle and wondrous; it is forcibly named the Profound.

Thus, the ancients who ruled all under heaven practiced non-action, and their virtue harmonized with the natural. Viewed through the Dao, in their speech, their words harmonized with the Dao—could any lord fail to be upright? Viewed through the Dao, in their roles, their divisions harmonized with the Dao—could righteousness ever be unclear? Viewed through the Dao, in their abilities, their capacities harmonized with the Dao—could any official fail to be well-governed? Viewed through the Dao in its ubiquity, all things harmonized with the Dao—could their responses ever be incomplete?

From this, we know that in all under heaven, if any affair or thing departs from the Dao, it cannot stand on its own. That which communicates with heaven and earth is virtue—through virtue, one harmonizes with heaven and earth. That which moves through the myriad things is the Dao—through the Dao, one pervades all things. Those who esteem governing people, even if they indulge in punishments, rewards, and governance, are merely engaged in affairs. How much further do they stray from virtue and the Dao when they enter technique through skill?

The ancients who skillfully nurtured all under heaven had no other method: without desire, all under heaven was sufficient; without action, all under heaven transformed itself. Their minds were as still as deep waters—stirred, yet never muddied. How could the people fail to be settled? Communicating with the One, all affairs are complete. This is the teaching of the *Western Ascension*, where Laozi instructs Yin Xi: "Without intention, one attains, and spirits submit." This is what the *Book of Changes* means when it says, "Even heaven does not oppose it—how much less humans, how much less spirits?"

The Master said: The Dao is that which covers and sustains the myriad things—vast and boundless, great indeed! The noble person cannot but hollow out their heart to embrace it. To act without contrivance is called Heaven; to speak without contrivance is called virtue. To love others and benefit things is called humaneness. To harmonize differences without erasing them is called the great practice; to embrace diversity without limit is called magnanimity. To possess ten thousand differences is called abundance. Thus, holding fast to virtue is called discipline; the completion of virtue is called establishment. Following the Dao is called fulfillment; not allowing things to thwart one’s resolve is called wholeness.

The noble person who is enlightened regarding these ten principles will conceal their affairs as though veiled, for their heart is vast. They will act with such ease that the myriad things flow away like water. Such a one hides gold in the mountains and pearls in the abyss, neither coveting wealth nor drawing near to nobility and riches. They do not delight in long life nor mourn early death; they do not take glory in success nor shame in poverty. They do not constrain themselves for the sake of worldly gain, nor do they claim a share of it as private profit. They do not regard ruling the world as their own exalted position. In prominence, they illuminate all things as one treasury; in death and life, they see the same form.

*(The Master said—this continues the preceding as a quoted attestation, likely the recorded saying of Laozi cited above. The following passage, where the Master asks Lao Dan, clearly refers to Confucius.)*

Guo's Commentary:
To have a heart is to burden one’s natural spontaneity—thus it must be hollowed out and discarded. Not acting for this, yet this comes to be; not speaking for these words, yet these words arise of themselves—this is the Dao of Heaven. To love others and benefit things is to entrust them to the natural course of their nature and destiny. The myriad things, the myriad forms, each abide in their allotted place, not drawing others to be the same as oneself—only then is greatness achieved. Conduct that does not diverge into eccentricity is the profound sameness where self and other, the myriad things, naturally find accommodation. Thus, to have surplus is to possess the ten thousand differences—this is called wealth. To say, “I have no difference from them,” is to uniquely possess these ten thousand powers. This is the guiding principle of humanity; what is not accomplished through virtue cannot be called establishment.

“To follow the Dao is called completeness” means that the Dao is not partial to any single thing. Not allowing things to thwart one’s will results in inner self-possession; a great heart accommodates all affairs. Virtue and power overflow abundantly, allowing the myriad things to proceed on their own. Not prizing rare and precious things enables one to forget the self—how much more, then, wealth and property? “Not drawing near to nobility and riches” speaks of what comes and lodges of itself; the heart constantly distances itself from them. To forget both long life and early death is what is called “suspended release.” Having forgotten long life and early death, how much more the distinctions between poverty and success?

Not claiming worldly gain as private profit means entrusting it all to the myriad things. Not regarding ruling the world as one’s own exalted position means that glory, unawares, does not attach to the self. In prominence, one illuminates; in obscurity, one remains silent—this is all. The one treasury, the same form: like a cicada’s molting, there is nowhere it resides.

Lü's Commentary:
The Dao is so vast that a heart not hollowed out cannot embody it. To embody the Dao and act without contrivance is to appear human yet be of Heaven. To love and benefit in this way is called benevolence; to attain unity in this way is called great conduct. Not differing from the common is the utmost in magnanimity; to possess the ten thousand differences is the utmost in wealth. One who holds fast to virtue unites the one and completes the ten thousand, like the main cord that orders the net.

When virtue is perfected, one stands without reliance; when the Dao is within oneself, there is nothing to which one does not respond without completeness. Nothing can topple one who is whole—this is what is meant by “completeness.” The noble person hollows the heart in these ten matters alone. Turning inward to seek, one illuminates the heart’s greatness; when affairs find no obstruction, this is the effect of having hollowed it. Abundantly, the myriad things flow away—circulating without end.

Thus, one hides gold and pearls in mountains and abysses, unaware of the desirability of wealth and profit, nor ashamed of poverty and obscurity. One does not claim the world’s gain as private possession but entrusts it to all under Heaven. Not regarding ruling the world as one’s own exalted position: what benefits things is not oneself. In prominence, one illuminates—illuminating through virtue, not through rank. Dwelling above, one embodies the virtue of emperors and kings; dwelling below, one embodies the Dao of the profound sage and unadorned king. When the myriad things are complete within oneself, they form a single treasury. Whether things are coming to life or dying, dying or coming to life, they share the same form—this is all.

Detailed Explanation of the Dao:
When the myriad things are all complete within me, to possess them and not lose them is wealth. If the guiding cord is disordered, the eyes of the multitude are confused; if virtue is lost, the conduct of the multitude goes astray. Thus, “to follow the Dao is called completeness; not allowing things to thwart one’s will is called wholeness.”

“Veiled, the greatness of the heart’s affairs” refers to grasping the great image. “Abundantly, the myriad things flow away” refers to the world coming to one. Those of old who oversaw the world through the Dao showed without relying on traces, instructed without relying on words, allowing others to attain it themselves. The superior transforms the inferior without the allure of pleasure; the inferior delights in the superior without craving its scent. To hide gold and pearls in mountains and abysses is not to burden the self with things. Not calculating long life or early death, poverty or success, is not to sacrifice the Dao for the sake of the self.

Worldly gain is substantial, yet one does not claim it as private profit. The power of all under Heaven is weighty, yet one does not regard it as one’s own exalted position. That the myriad things cannot differ from one, that life and death cannot alter one—could one without a heart accomplish this?

The *Blue Void* states: When it begins with "The Master said," it refers to Zhuangzi receiving the esoteric teachings of Elder Sangong. The Dao is vast and boundless, filling all things; only those whose spirit is empty can contain it. Acting naturally accords with Heaven’s spontaneity, abiding in the center while speaking of the distant, free from discouragement in measuring life and engaging with things—such a heart never retreats. What others detest, I harbor no suspicion toward; harmonizing light with dust, I set no sharp edges, allowing the myriad things to flourish and the world to prosper. Upholding the highest virtue as its guiding principle, following the supreme principle to establish good governance, and aligning with true constancy without deviation—externally reflecting to preserve inner clarity—this is how one tempers the heart. Thus, affairs are all encompassed, principles all embraced, grace all abundant, and things all fulfilled.

Gold, pearls, and wealth are the roots of calamity; longevity or early death, poverty or success, are inner afflictions; private gain and exalted position are emotional maladies. If the heart is bound by even one of these, the will cannot be whole.

*Limited Views* states: Guo Xiang’s interpretation takes "manifest and thus bright" as a complete phrase, and most commentaries follow this, yet it seems disjointed from the following text. Master Fan Wulu connects it to the subsequent passage, which extends the meaning. I follow his approach: "To rule all under Heaven without regarding it as one’s own exaltation"—yet what is exalted does exist, manifesting in the clarity that the myriad things share a single repository, and life and death share the same form. If the myriad things share a single repository, there is no division of self and other; if life and death share the same form, there is no burden of coming or going. Is this not the ultimate achievement of an empty heart?

The Master said: The Dao dwells in profound depths, its clarity flowing like pure water. Metal and stone cannot remain silent; thus, they produce sound, yet without being struck, they do not ring. Who can determine the myriad things? The person of royal virtue moves with simplicity and feels shame in becoming entangled in affairs. Establishing the root and origin, their knowledge connects with the divine. Thus, their virtue is vast, and their heart, though moved by external things, does not precede them. Without the Dao, form does not arise; without virtue, life does not shine. To preserve form, exhaust life, establish virtue, and illuminate the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue?

Vast and boundless, suddenly emerging, suddenly stirring—all things follow. This is the person of royal virtue. Seeing in darkness, hearing in silence—within darkness, they alone perceive clarity; within silence, they alone hear harmony. Thus, delving deeper and deeper, they can master things; attaining greater and greater spirit, they can refine essence. In their engagement with the myriad things, they are utterly without substance yet fulfill all requests, swiftly meeting their needs, whether great or small, long or short, near or far.

Guo’s commentary: Sound arises from stillness, illustrating that those who embody the Dao respond only when moved by things. Who can determine the myriad things? This speaks of responding to stimuli without fixed direction. The person of royal virtue acts with simplicity, not seeking entanglement in affairs. Establishing the root and origin, their knowledge connects with the divine—only by establishing the root and not opposing it can one act with simplicity and connect with the divine. Their virtue is thus vast, their heart moved by external things, not preceding them. "Suddenly" and "stirring" describe the appearance of responding without intention; since movement arises without intention, all things follow—this is the boundlessness of royal virtue. Thus, they can preserve form, exhaust life, establish virtue, illuminate the Dao, and achieve royal virtue. Seeing in darkness and hearing in silence, perceiving clarity and harmony—if sight and hearing do not rely on stillness, they become dim and discordant. Delving deeper and deeper, exhausting the source, they can then master things; attaining greater and greater spirit, reaching ultimate compliance, they can then exhaust subtlety. I remain still and let things take their course; their needs are naturally fulfilled, freely and without restraint, meeting their ultimate ends.

Lü’s commentary: "Profound in its dwelling" speaks of its depth and immobility; "flowing in its clarity"...

The purity of its speech flows without turbidity—such is the Dao and nothing more. If one deems it absent, even metal and stone cannot sound without it; if one deems it present, metal and stone do not resonate when unstruck. Who can determine this? In its purity, it mingles with nothing; in its passage, it leaves no trace. Not bound to affairs, things become clear and distinct; penetrating the spirit, it pervades the myriad things without obstruction—why then seek to be "bound to affairs"? The root is the Dao; affairs are its branches. Establish the root, and affairs naturally flow—this is the heart not seizing upon things, abiding in stillness alone, neither pursuing nor resisting, responding without hoarding.

The ear hears, the eye sees, the mouth speaks, the heart thinks—none of these are not the Dao. Yet if form does not follow the Dao, life does not arise; if daily use does not recognize it, the power within me cannot be illuminated. Thus, life is not virtue, nor is it clarity. Only by preserving form, exhausting life, establishing virtue, and illuminating the Dao does it rest within me, grasped and wielded to govern the present with the ancient.

Suddenly emerging and moving, the myriad things follow—this is the hidden, unanticipated arising of the heart, never contrived by force. Though the Dao as a thing cannot be seen, it is the very source of seeing; though it cannot be heard, it is the very source of hearing. Profound and able to encompass things, within it lies something tangible; spirit-like and able to refine, within it lies essence. Utterly formless yet supplying all needs, its richness is the inexhaustible treasury of heaven. Racing through time and seizing its lodging, whether great or small, long or short, distant or near, its allotment is never insufficient—this is what the *Yi* means by "each settling into its nature and destiny, preserving the great harmony."

Fu Mo’s commentary: "Metal and stone cannot sound without it; metal and stone do not resonate when unstruck"—does resonance belong to the Dao, or does the striking belong to the Dao? Who can determine this? If one fixes it in the unstruck metal and stone, why do they not sound? If one fixes it in the striking, other sounds should be the same as metal and stone. If one fixes it in emptiness, why does striking produce no sound? Such questioning urges deep reflection to attain understanding. "Pure passage" means its flowing through the myriad things is passage itself—unadulterated, unified, flowing and unobstructed.

The "pure passage" is emptiness, stillness, tranquility, quiescence, and non-action—never sinking into the midst of affairs or their appearances. Thus it is said: "It is ashamed to be entangled in affairs." Yet when one establishes the root and origin, grasping the essential Dao, one’s knowledge naturally communicates with the numinous. Therefore, one’s virtue is vast and sufficient to rule all under Heaven. That which gives me life is the Dao; that which illuminates me is virtue. When virtue is taken as illumination, illumination reaches its utmost. Yet the Dao and virtue are not two: originating from Heaven, it is the Dao—this is establishing the root and origin; attained within oneself, it is virtue—this is the knowledge that communicates with the numinous. Preserving one’s form and exhausting one’s life, the root and origin are established; establishing one’s virtue and illuminating the Dao, the kingly virtue is vast. Thus it is further praised: "Vast and boundless!" Suddenly emerging, suddenly moving, and the myriad things follow—truly, its flowing through the myriad things is inexhaustible. "Utterly non-being yet supplying every demand" means emptiness without depletion, movement yielding ever more, non-action yet nothing left undone. "Ranging freely and returning to its lodging" means that passage is called "far-reaching," and far-reaching is called "return"; extreme movement reverts to stillness. Some are great yet suddenly small, long yet suddenly short, or short yet suddenly long and distant—such is the person of kingly virtue.

The Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water, ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun, and gazed southward. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Then he sent Xiang Wang, and Xiang Wang found it. The Yellow Emperor said, "How strange! Only Xiang Wang could obtain it!"

Guo’s commentary: This illustrates how one attains the true. To say that knowledge is insufficient to grasp the true, that keen hearing and sharp sight lead one further from the true—Xiang Wang obtained it, showing that attaining the true does not rely on the mind. Xiang Wang is the true itself.

Lü’s commentary: The north of the Red Water symbolizes the ultimate of the mysterious; Mount Kunlun is the highest within form. Gazing southward is to observe toward the light. The pearl, as a thing, cannot be sought through knowledge or recognition, so all attempts failed. Xiang, however, is not nothing; Wang is not something—neither being nor non-being, neither distinct nor obscure. This is how the dark pearl is obtained.

Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi. Yao asked Xu You, "Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him." Xu You said, "How perilous! How precarious! Nie Que’s nature is keen, wise, quick, and sharp—surpassing others. Yet he takes what he receives from man as if it were from Heaven. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgressions but does not know the source of transgressions. Could such a one match Heaven? Moreover, he rides upon man rather than Heaven, bases himself on the body yet differs in form, exalts knowledge and races like fire, acts as a taskmaster, becomes entangled in things, looks in all directions and responds to them, adapts to every circumstance, and transforms with things yet has no constancy. How could he be fit to match Heaven? Nevertheless, he has clan and ancestry and can serve as a father to the multitude—but not as the father of fathers, for he is a leader in times of order and chaos. This is the calamity of facing north."

The bane of facing south.

Guo's commentary: "To 'match Heaven' means to be the Son of Heaven. Being overly keen and quick surpasses others, yet this causes people to strain toward him, repeatedly harming others. Taking what he receives from man as if it were from Heaven—this is using knowledge to seek a return to one's natural state. Transgressions arise from keenness and wisdom, yet he further employs knowledge to prohibit them, making his transgressions all the more severe. Thus it is said: 'There are no transgressions when knowledge is abandoned, not when prohibitions are enforced.' Riding upon man rather than Heaven—this speaks of granting him the world and letting later generations rely on knowledge while losing their true nature. If one takes the myriad things as the root, then the transformations of the multitude can be unified, and differing forms can be harmonized—this is the path. Yet if later generations are made to follow his example in controlling things, the myriad things will fall into disorder. 'Exalting knowledge and racing like fire'—this means that when the worthy hold positions at the forefront, knowledge and perception are exalted behind them, leading to frantic competition and fiery haste. 'Acting as a taskmaster'—this will give rise to the beginnings of later generations being enslaved by affairs. 'Becoming entangled in things'—this will lead later generations to be constrained and controlled by things. 'Looking in all directions and responding to things'—this will result in later generations directing and moving things with gestures, commanding responses and managing tasks. 'Adapting to every circumstance'—this will cause later generations to be unable to forget goodness and benefit others by responding to every circumstance. 'Transforming with things'—this will lead later generations to chase after things and lose their inner constancy. All these are expedient for the moment, yet today one receives their virtue, and tomorrow one bears their harm. Thus it is said: 'having no constancy.' 'Having clan and ancestry'—this means his deeds can be traced and imitated, leaving the mark of a father to the multitude. Yet a father of fathers is one who leaves the mark of marks. If one grants him the world, he will not merely be a ruler in times of order but a leader in times of chaos. Jie and Zhou were not able to kill worthy ministers; rather, they relied on the traces of sagely wisdom to bring them calamity. Tian Heng was not able to kill his lord; rather, he used benevolence and righteousness to harm him. Thus it is said: 'the calamity of facing north, the bane of facing south.'"

Lü's commentary: "His nature surpasses others, yet he does not dismiss keenness and abandon knowledge to act only when unavoidable. Taking what he receives from man as if it were from Heaven—this means he is not wholly aligned with Heaven. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgressions but does not know their source, believing this aligns with non-action and matches Heaven. How could he not thereby discard Heaven for man? Basing himself on the body yet differing in form—this means he cannot be without self. Exalting knowledge and racing like fire—this means he cannot abandon knowledge, thus becoming enslaved by the world, entangled by things yet unable to free himself. Looking in all directions and responding to things—this is not sitting in stillness and letting the people act without knowing where to turn. Moreover, adapting to every circumstance—this is not establishing the root and origin, nor knowing the divine in all things. Thus he transforms with things yet has no constancy. How could he be fit to match Heaven?"

Personal observation: "Nie Que is keen, wise, and quick—his nature surpasses others. This discusses his talent but does not speak of his Dao. Taking what he receives from man as if it were from Heaven—this means he still engages in action to seek alignment with non-action. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgressions but does not know their source. If one grants him the world, he will ride upon the traces of action to govern the people, causing the world to lose its natural nature. Basing himself on the body yet differing in form—this is like the liver and gallbladder being as distant as Chu and Yue. Exalting knowledge and racing like fire—this is the urgency of schemes and calculations. Acting as a taskmaster—this means being enslaved by affairs. Becoming entangled in things—this means being hindered by things. Looking in all directions and responding to things—this means not forgetting others. Adapting to every circumstance—this means not forgetting things. Transforming with things—this means chasing after things and changing with them. Having no constancy—this means losing one's original self. How could he be fit to match Heaven? Nevertheless, having clan and ancestry—this means Nie Que's learning also has its lineage and lord, and he has generally heard the Dao. He can serve as a father to the multitude but not as the father of fathers."

Yao observed this. The border guard of Huahua said, "Ah! Sage, I offer a blessing to you. May the sage live long!" Yao said, "I decline." "May the sage be wealthy!" Yao said, "I decline." "May the sage have many sons!" Yao said, "I decline." The border guard said, "Long life, wealth, and many sons—these are what all people desire. Why do you alone not desire them?" Yao said, "Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; long life brings many humiliations. These three are not means to cultivate virtue, so I decline." The border guard said, "At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven gives birth to the myriad people and must assign them duties. If one has many sons and assigns them duties, what fear is there? If one is wealthy and lets others share it, what affairs are there? The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling, moves like a bird and leaves no trace. When the world has the Dao, he flourishes with all things; when the world lacks the Dao, he cultivates virtue and retreats into seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs and ascends as an immortal, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. The three calamities do not reach him, and his body remains free from harm—what humiliation is there?" The border guard departed, and Yao followed him, saying, "May I ask a question?" The border guard said, "Withdraw."

Guo's commentary: "Having many sons and assigning them duties ensures all things find their place and minds are settled. Being wealthy and entrusting it to the world means having no affairs. Dwelling like a quail means having no intention to seek comfort; eating like a fledgling means relying on things to be sufficient. Moving in accordance with one's nature leaves no extraordinary traces. Flourishing with all things—this is acting wildly and treading the great square. Cultivating virtue and retreating into seclusion—even the affairs of Tang and Wu, if they accord with Heaven and respond to people, are not without their intervals. The perfected person exhausts the length of life and embraces the changes of fortune. In life, they follow Heaven; in death, they transform with things. Weary of the world, ascending as an immortal, riding the clouds to the realm of the Emperor—this is the dispersal of the single qi, which reaches everywhere."

Lü's commentary: "The sage exhausts the Dao of Heaven, thus their body aligns with transformation, and things cannot burden them. The gentleman exhausts the Dao of man, thus fortune and misfortune are shared with the people. Long life, wealth, and many sons—though desired by all, one cannot but decline them due to the many affairs, fears, and humiliations they bring. Yao did not fail to exhaust the Dao of Heaven; his alignment with others was merely exhausting the Dao of man. Dwelling like a quail means not knowing where one resides; eating like a fledgling means not knowing where one's food comes from. Moving like a bird and leaving no trace means their path is unseen. The theories of immortals seek it through diet and breath control, but世儒 regard them as mad and do not believe them—both are mistaken. Those who embrace the spirit in life will also embrace the spirit in death. Those who preserve Heaven in life will also preserve Heaven in death. The *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* both speak of 'being in Heaven.' Why then doubt ascending as an immortal? Yao was not someone who clung to appearances or was seen as such by others, so the border guard's withdrawal was what he embodied."

】 The "Secondary Ink" [asks]: *What is meant by "dwelling like a quail, eating like a fledgling, moving like a bird and leaving no trace"?*

The quail has no fixed dwelling; the fledgling depends on its mother’s feeding; the bird flies through empty space, passing without a trace—all embody the intent of effortless spontaneity. The sage’s mind in navigating the world is likewise.

The *Three Calamities* refer to what the Buddhist scriptures call the *Three Disasters*: water, fire, and wind.

When Yao ruled the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was enfeoffed as a lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to till the soil. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the fields. Yu hastened to stand downwind and asked: *"In the past, when Yao ruled the world, you were enfeoffed as a lord. Yao ceded to Shun, Shun ceded to me, yet you resigned your lordship to plow. May I ask the reason?"*

Zi Gao replied: *"In the past, when Yao ruled the world, he did not reward, yet the people were encouraged; he did not punish, yet the people stood in awe. Now you reward and punish, yet the people grow ever less humane. Virtue declines from this; punishments arise from this; the chaos of later ages begins from this. Sir, depart—do not hinder my work!"* He bent low, *yi yi*, and plowed on without looking back.

[The *Tongbian Jing* of Bo Cheng Zi Gao states: *"Since the opening of heaven and earth, my body has undergone one thousand three hundred transformations. Those of later ages who attain the Dao—Bo Cheng Zi Gao is one such."* "Do not hinder my work" means "do not interrupt my plowing." *Yi yi* describes the posture of bowing one’s head to till the soil.]

Guo’s commentary: *In Yu’s time, three sages succeeded one another, governance was perfected, virtue was complete, and merit was consummate—gradually receding, hence the historians had nothing to record. Confucius could find no gap to intervene, and thus, though Yu possessed the world, he did not partake in it. This is the presence that is absence. Thus, when assessing the era, Yu was the most excellent; when evaluating the men, though three sages, they were but one Yao. The age lacked sages, so the world’s heart suddenly turned to Qi. The utmost impartiality in occupying the throne is to entrust the world to the people—taking and giving are not one’s own. Thus, to lose it is not sought; to gain it is not refused. It comes in a flash, departs in simplicity. Therefore, though he was slandered by men of integrity and frugality, and his name ranks among the Three Kings, it is no wonder. Zhuangzi uses this to illustrate Yao’s flaws—flaws that began with Yao and were completed by Yu. How much more so for later ages without sages? He projects distant traces onto Zi Gao, making him abandon governance and not rule, intending to "cut off sagacity and return to unity, discard knowledge and attain tranquility." Yet in truth, this was never heard of. Zhuangzi’s words cannot be confined to a single path. Some trace the steps of the Yellow Emperor, some shave the shins of Yao and Shun—how could he merely exalt Yao and disparage Yu? Thus, one must set aside what he projects and record his intent to "cut off sagacity and discard knowledge."*】

At the Great Beginning, there was Non-Being; Non-Being had no Having, no name. From Unity all things arise. There was Unity, yet no form—things came to life through it, and this was called "virtue." Before form, there were divisions, yet no gaps—this was called "destiny." When movement abides and living things are born, and when things attain completion and life’s patterns emerge, this is called "form." When form embodies spirit, each possessing its own standard, this is called "nature." When nature is cultivated and returns to virtue, and when virtue reaches its fullness to merge with the Beginning, this merging is called "emptiness." Emptiness is vastness. The cries of beaks harmonize; the harmony of beaks merges with Heaven and Earth. Their merging is seamless, like a thread passing through—seeming foolish, seeming dim. This is called "mystic virtue," aligning with the Great Compliance.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
Non-Being has no Having, thus nothing to name. Unity is the inception of Having, the subtlest of all. Being subtlest, it has no physical pattern or form. That from which Unity arises arises from Supreme Unity, not from Non-Being. Yet why does Zhuangzi repeatedly invoke Non-Being at the origin? The origin is that which, before birth, attains birth—the difficulty of attaining birth lies neither in relying on Non-Being above nor in depending on knowledge below. It arises suddenly and spontaneously. Why then strive for life after life has already arisen, thereby losing its self-generated nature? Non-Being cannot create things, yet it is said that things come to life through it—this clarifies that the life of things is self-attained. To allow their self-attainment is what is called "virtue." Virtue, form, nature, and destiny are names established through transformation, yet in their self-so nature, they are one. When nature is cultivated and returns to virtue, it constantly attains itself through non-action, unlike the Beginning. If one acts midway, one’s embrace is filled with things. With things, even if one nurtures them, virtue diminishes. To speak without intention and yet speak is to harmonize with the cries of beaks. The harmony of beaks merges with Heaven and Earth, for Heaven and Earth also act without intention. Their merging is seamless, a merging of sitting-forgetting, not a merging through discernment. This is called "mystic virtue." When virtue is mystic, what it complies with is vast.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Non-Being makes even Unity unattainable. Without a name, it is the arising of Unity, yet formless—the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Having already called it Unity, how can it remain nameless? This is what allows things to come to life, and thus it is called "virtue," the mother of the myriad things. That which is unformed has divisions yet no gaps—this is called "destiny," which admits no separation from the unformed. Only when movement abides and living things are born, and when things attain completion and life’s patterns emerge, is this called "form." When form embodies spirit without loss, each possessing its own standard without error, this is called "nature"—which does not lose what comes after form. There is nothing else to this: all things equally attain Unity to gain life, thus having divisions yet no gaps. Nature preserves spirit without loss, and spirit pervades the myriad things, filling Heaven and Earth. Therefore, when nature is cultivated and returns to virtue, it merges with the formless Unity. When virtue reaches its fullness to merge with the Beginning, even Non-Being becomes unattainable. This merging is emptiness; emptiness becomes vastness. Its vastness reaches the state before things ever existed. When vastness attains such non-differentiation, speaking in terms of non-action, the harmony of beaks merges. The harmony of beaks communicates with Heaven and Earth, merging with them. Between Heaven and Earth, it is like a bellows. The harmony of beaks merging with Heaven and Earth is like this. Their merging is seamless, not a merging sought after, nor a merging through knowledge or perception. This is called "mystic virtue," which originates in virtue and is completed by Heaven. Aligning with the Great Compliance means encountering nothing contrary.

**Liu’s Annotation:**
The Great Beginning is the inception of qi, thus there is Non-Being. The Great Commencement is the inception of form, thus there is no name. From Unity all things arise, and then there are names. Though Unity has no form, things come to life through it because of Unity. Before form, it is undifferentiated—it can be called undifferentiated, yet it already has divisions. "Moreover" does not imply long-lasting stability. "No gaps" means beginning and end are like a ring, seamless and unpointable. Within it lies essence; within it lies sincerity—this is what is meant by "before form, there are divisions." To establish virtue stealthily is what is meant by "moreover." To exist continuously without gaps is what is meant by "seamless." Yet when destiny descends, if it does not abide, it is insufficient to generate things. If it abides but does not move, it is sufficient to generate things but not the myriad things. When it abides, it is not without movement; when it moves, it does not harm its abiding—thus it can generate things. When things attain completion and life’s patterns emerge, this is called "form." When form embodies spirit, each possessing its own standard, this is called "nature." With life comes nature. When nature is obscured, one can know Heaven. Knowing Heaven, one returns to virtue. When virtue is perfected, it merges with the Dao.

**Following the Text:**
A question is posed: "At the Great Beginning, was there...?"

"Was there nothing?" The answer: "There was no 'having,' nor even this name. Yet within this 'nothing,' the One arises from it—there is the One, only not yet manifest or visible. This is what is called 'the Ultimateless and yet the Great Ultimate.' All things receiving this to be born is called 'virtue.' In its unmanifest state, the myriad principles are already complete, each with its own order and pattern, capable of distinction—yet for now, it is called 'destiny' precisely because it remains undifferentiated and seamless. When it abides, it cannot but move to generate things; each thing, once formed with its life-patterns, is called 'form.' When form embodies the primordial spirit, each possessing its own standard, this is called 'nature'—what is meant by 'each thing possessing a Great Ultimate.' Cultivating nature returns one to virtue; when virtue reaches its utmost, it merges with the unmanifest beginning. This merging is emptiness—emptiness of emptiness—where there is no right or wrong, no self or other. All in the world that clamor and contend with their beaks are united as one. When beaks are united in silence, they merge with Heaven and Earth—coiled like a thread drawn taut, seamlessly joined, appearing foolish, appearing dim, describing the meaning of union. Profound virtue is deep and wondrous; great compliance is following the natural without imposing the self."

*Oral Exegesis:*
"When beaks are united, there is no speech; when they cry out, there is speech. The 'union' of beaks and cries differs from the earlier 'union.' Here, the cries of beaks, though silent, become speech—thus merging with the natural. This natural union then merges with Heaven and Earth. Hence it is said, 'beaks united, coiled like a thread,' appearing foolish, appearing dim, describing this 'union.' This is profound and wondrous virtue, one with great compliance—the principle of the Great Beginning's naturalness."

Confucius asked Lao Dan: "There is one who practices the Way as if imitating—affirming what should not be affirmed, denying what should not be denied. A debater once said, 'Separating hardness and whiteness is like suspending a screen—so clear and evident.' Can such a one be called a sage?"

Lao Dan replied: "This is but a clerk’s skill, bound by technique, exhausting the body and disturbing the mind. A dog held on a leash grows anxious; a monkey’s agility, once brought from the mountains, becomes its trap. I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot utter: all those with heads and feet yet without minds or ears are many. Those with form cannot compare with the formless and shapeless, which yet all endure—none of their movements or stillness, their deaths or lives, their rises or falls, belong to their own doing. Is governance in man, or in forgetting things, forgetting Heaven? Its name is 'forgetting the self.' One who forgets the self is called 'entering into Heaven.'"

*Xuanfang’s note:*
"Clear as a suspended room before one’s eyes." *Liu* (留) is also written as *li* (狸); one says, "a dog held on a leash grows anxious." *Bian* (便) means agility, as in being captured.

*Guo’s commentary:*
"Imitating and forcing the unallowable to be allowable, the unso to be so—this distorts one’s nature. 'Suspended screen' speaks of its loftiness and clarity. A dog held on a leash, a monkey’s agility—these lose their natural state. 'Heads and feet' are like beginnings and ends; 'without mind or ears' means self-transformation. Those with form are prone to change and cannot endure alongside the formless and shapeless. Thus, one who excels in the Way does not cling to old patterns but follows the daily renewal of transformation. Their movements and stillness, deaths and lives, flourishing and decline, rising and falling—none have constancy, all arise naturally, not by their own doing. Let go, and they attain spontaneity. Governance lies in man, not in self-assertion. Forgetting things and Heaven, what remains but the self? If even the self is forgotten, what more is there to know? This is unknowing and unperceiving, yet merging with the natural—called 'entering into Heaven.'"

*Bixu’s note:*
"Affirming the unallowable, denying the unso—adorned knowledge seeking difference. The debate over 'separating hardness and whiteness' is like suspending the heavens, making all clear. Exchanging falsehoods, bound by skill, wearying the body and startling the mind—like a hunting dog on a leash or a monkey in a cage, all suffer from their own abilities. 'Heads and feet' are visible forms; 'without mind or ears'—their intent is unknowable. Without ears, they cannot hear; without minds, they cannot speak. Those with form have heads and feet; the formless and shapeless have no mind or ears. Yet all endure—'none' is also without end. Their movements and stillness, deaths and lives, rises and falls—none belong to their own doing. Where does one return? Governance lies in man—self-governance alone. Forget things, and you merge with them; forget Heaven, and you merge with it; forget the self, and you become undivided. What is there you cannot enter?"

*Bisheng:*
"'As if imitating' means resembling. Confucius asked Lao Dan: 'There is one whose dwelling in the Way seems to resemble the sage—affirming what others deny, denying what others affirm. A skilled debater once said, "Dissecting hardness and whiteness is like holding up the heavens—clear for all to see." Can such a one be called a sage?' What you cannot hear, what hearing does not reach; what you cannot speak, what speech does not attain."

"Now, that which is without mind, without ears, without form, without shape—this the world knows to be nothing. Yet if one has a head and feet but is without mind and ears, possessing form yet without form or shape, and you utterly negate all these, where then can your hearing and speech be applied? However, what I call 'utterly negating' does not mean that movements and stillness, deaths and lives, rises and falls all differ from those of others. When others move, one moves; when others are still, one is still; when others live or die, one lives or dies; when others rise or fall, one rises or falls—yet ultimately, one cannot be called 'having' these, for one has forgotten them. Having forgotten things, and then forgotten Heaven—from which things arise—when both are forgotten, this is the utmost of forgetting. Such is called 'forgetting the self.' What distinguishes man from Heaven is his having a self. When the self is forgotten, what is this if not Heaven? This is called 'entering into Heaven'—none but the sage can achieve this. The later phrase 'governance lies in man' responds to the earlier 'one whose governance of the Way seems to resemble [the sage].' The meaning is quite clear."

Jiang Lümen *[note: "Mian"]* saw Jiche and said: "The Lord of Lu said to me, 'I request your instruction.' I could not refuse and have already spoken, but I do not know if it was appropriate. Allow me to present it to you. I said to the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, elevate those who are publicly spirited and loyal, and eliminate partiality and self-interest. Then who among the people would dare not be harmonious?' Jiche laughed heartily and said: 'If this is what you advise, then your words on the virtue of emperors and kings are like a mantis raising its arms to block a chariot’s wheel—it will surely not suffice. Moreover, if one acts thus, one’s own position will be perilous, and the observation tower will be crowded with those who come to cast their lots.' Jiang Lümen was startled and said: 'I am utterly bewildered by your words. Nevertheless, I wish to hear the drift of your teaching.'"

Jiche said: "When the Great Sage governs the world, he stirs and sways the people’s hearts, shaping them into teachings and transforming their customs. He eradicates their predatory minds and advances their solitary aspirations, as if these arose from their very nature, and the people remain unaware of how this comes to be. If this is so, how could one regard Yao and Shun’s teachings as an elder brother and this Way as a younger sibling? One would rather seek unity in virtue while keeping the mind at rest."

[Alternative readings: *Jiang* as *Jiang Lümen*, *Mian* as *Tun*; *ji* (輯) in *Er Ya* means "harmony"; *huòhuò* () denotes laughter, *xìxì* (覤覤) denotes alarm. *Yaodang* (摇荡) means "to stir like dancing."]

Guo’s commentary: ["One must practice reverence and frugality" does not mean forgetting frugality while being frugal, nor does "elevating the publicly spirited and loyal" mean forgetting loyalty while being loyal. Thus, though one eliminates partiality and self-interest, this is insufficient to counter the task of deceit. These are all ways of placing oneself on high, like a towering observation platform visible to all, compelling things to exceed their natural bounds and straining to multiply attachments. This is like raising one’s feet to cast lots—abandoning one’s foundational steps. Each mind has its own inclinations; they cannot be imitated. Therefore, if one stirs them by following their own stirring, though they are stirred, it is not by force. If one sways them by following their own swaying, though they are swayed, it is not by movement. Thus, their predatory minds are naturally eradicated, and their solitary aspirations naturally advance. Teachings are established, customs transformed, and all is harmonious without trace. Nature is restored, and all acts as if of its own accord, unaware of its origins. All say, "This is natural." *Mingxing* (溟涬) means self-valuing—one does not humbly defer to Yao and Shun, nor does one regard them as an elder brother. "Keeping the mind at rest" means not pursuing externals; if the mind is not at rest, virtue is not unified.]

Lü’s commentary: ["One must practice reverence and frugality" refers to restraining one’s nature to observe the people, which endangers one’s own position. "Elevating the publicly spirited and loyal" refers to exalting the worthy, which multiplies the observation platforms. If this is so, one cannot avoid leaving traces, and those who come to cast their lots will be many. When the Great Sage governs the world, he stirs and sways the people’s hearts, shaping them into teachings and transforming their customs—this is what is meant by "drumming and dancing them to exhaust their spirit." If the people do not peer at the traces left by their superiors to follow them, their predatory minds are eradicated, and their solitary aspirations advance as if by nature, unaware of how this comes to be. If this is so, virtue surpasses Yao and Shun, and one does not act as if regarding their teachings as an elder brother, humbly following as a younger sibling. One seeks unity in virtue while keeping the mind at rest; with the mind at rest, there is non-action, and the myriad things are transformed.]

Detailed Daoist commentary: ["One must practice reverence and frugality" is not non-action. "Elevating the publicly spirited and loyal" is exalting the worthy. The virtue of emperors and kings lies in non-action, so the world has no weariness from reverence; not exalting the worthy, so the world has no striving for superiority. Thus, one stirs them by following their own stirring and sways them by following their own swaying. Their predatory minds are thereby eradicated, and their solitary knowledge daily advances, as if by nature, while the people remain unaware of its origins. Now, if one forces reverence, frugality, and the elevation of the publicly spirited as tasks, this is to open the people’s Heaven and guide their predatory minds, to obstruct Heaven’s Heaven and diminish their solitary aspirations. How far is this from the virtue of emperors and kings? Delicacies may please and halt the passerby, but their benefit is fleeting and cannot last. Foam may be insufficient, yet it does not cause forgetfulness; its benefit is slight but all-encompassing. This is why the spirit-like person dislikes the multitude’s arrival and holds to the Great Image, so the world comes to them. As for drumming up the mantis’s raised arms or setting up the perilous form of an observation tower to make people rush together and cast their lots—is this not the logic of delicacies and foam? In the past, Shun was burdened by his sagacity, Liezi was startled by the gift of broth, Nanguozi was troubled by his knowledge being sold, and Gengsang Chu was vexed by his roles in the altars of soil and grain. The key lies in dwelling in shade to rest one’s shadow and abiding in stillness to quiet one’s traces—only then is perfection attained.]

Fang Sishan’s note: [By *mingxing*, he refers to the era of primordial chaos and governance through non-action, which is to say, the "Great Unity" of the "Canon of Yao" chapter. Such governance surpasses that of Yao and Shun; Yao and Shun’s teachings involve action, hence the question: "How could one regard Yao and Shun’s teachings as an elder brother and this Way as a younger sibling?" The phrasing is extraordinary, yet the meaning is clear. Some among the various commentaries say it means "self-valuing," others "bowing one’s head in humility," and still others "no distinction"—these seem to miss the mark.]

Zigong traveled south to Chu and, on his return to Jin, passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man working in his vegetable garden. The man had dug a tunnel to enter a well, where he embraced a jar to draw water for irrigation. He toiled strenuously but accomplished little. Zigong said: "There is a device here that can irrigate a hundred furrows in a day, requiring little effort but yielding great results. Would you not like to use it?" The gardener looked up at him and said: "How does it work?" Zigong replied: "Carve wood into a machine—heavy at the back, light at the front—so that drawing water is like pulling a rope, swift as boiling over. Its name is a *gao* (桔槔)." The gardener flushed with anger, his expression changed, and he laughed: "I have heard from my teacher that those who use machines inevitably engage in machinations, and those who engage in machinations inevitably harbor a machinating mind. When a machinating mind resides in the breast, purity is incomplete. When purity is incomplete, the spirit is unsettled. When the spirit is unsettled, the Way cannot bear it. I am not ignorant of this—I am ashamed to do it." Zigong was taken aback, ashamed, and bowed his head without responding. After a while, the gardener said: "What are you doing?" Zigong replied: "I am a disciple of Confucius." The gardener said: "Are you not that learned man who compares himself to the sages, who struts about to overshadow the multitude, who sings mournful songs to sell your reputation throughout the world? You would do better to forget your spirit and vitality, cast off your bodily form, and perhaps approach something. Yet you cannot even govern yourself—how do you have leisure to govern the world? Be on your way!"

Zigong, abashed and crestfallen, his countenance wan and unsettled, walked thirty *li* before recovering. His disciples then asked: "Who was that man we met earlier? Why did you, Master, change your expression and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?"

Zigong replied: "At first, I thought there was but one man in the world—yet I did not know there was also such a man as this. I have heard from the Master that the Way of the sage seeks what is feasible, achieves what is complete, and expends little effort to yield great results. Yet this is not so in practice. Those who hold to the Way attain full virtue; those with full virtue attain full bodily form; those with full bodily form attain full spirit; and those with full spirit embody the Way of the sage. They entrust their lives to the people, moving alongside them without knowing where they go—vast and whole! They must forget the heart of that man, who neither pursues nor rejects what lies beyond his will, nor acts against his own mind. Though the world may praise him, he remains unmoved by what they call lofty; though the world may condemn him, he remains untroubled by what they call loss. Neither the world’s praise nor blame adds to or detracts from him—such is the man of complete virtue! Yet I am but a man tossed by the winds and waves."

Returning to Lu, he told Confucius what had transpired. Confucius said: "That man feigns the arts of Hundun. He grasps one aspect but not the other, cultivating his inner self while neglecting the outer. Those who embody clarity, enter simplicity, practice non-action, return to uncarved simplicity, embrace their nature, and hold fast to spirit while wandering among the common folk—you would be startled by such a one? Moreover, the arts of Hundun—how could you or I presume to understand them?"

[Textual variants: *Yitang* and Sima Biao’s edition read *yidang*, describing swift movement like a well-sweep. *Shi* glosses *man* as a look of shame, *yu yu* (or *yu xu*) as a demeanor of boastfulness, and *xu xu* as a state of self-loss.]

Guo’s commentary:
What is useful in its time is true wholeness. This man seeks wholeness by clinging to oneness and upholding antiquity, yet misses the point. Without forgetting or relinquishing, there is no path to approximation. "One man" refers to Confucius. The Way of the sage is simply the heart of the common people. Full spirit is the Way of the sage-king, not that of such a man. Zigong, hearing his feigned cultivation, was convinced, unaware that purity and wholeness are the same. This is like the followers of Song Rongzi, who fall short of complete virtue. Zigong’s confusion mirrors Liezi’s intoxication with Ji Xian. Confucius, recognizing his turn from the present toward the past and his preoccupation with worldly affairs, knew he was not a true Hundun. He merely emulates antiquity, clinging to the simplicity of uncarved wood, yet fails to adapt to the times and respond to things with ease. The true Hundun does not cultivate at all—how could he distinguish between inner and outer, favoring one over the other? Those who embody clarity, enter simplicity, practice non-action, return to uncarved simplicity, embrace their nature, and hold fast to spirit while wandering among the common folk are the true Hundun. Thus, moving with the world without losing themselves, though they wander among the common folk, they leave no trace—why should they startle you? Hundun and darkness are one—who can comprehend them? What the world recognizes is merely their outward form.

Lü’s Annotation: [To wield antiquity in governing the present is to make every daily act a technique of Hundun—why must one return to the primordial beginning of Heaven and Earth? Those who employ machinery and machinations, who engage in mechanical affairs and harbor mechanical minds, fail to see that the origin of the mechanical mind lies in a state where things have not yet arisen. Thus, they recognize one aspect but miss the other. Those who claim to forget spirit and qi, to cast off the body and its form in pursuit of the wholeness of virtue and the Dao, yet believe the Dao operates only within and not without, are merely cultivating the inner while neglecting the outer. "Clarity entering simplicity, wandering among the common folk"—this is what is meant by "discarding the mind and employing the form." When he first heard Zigong’s words, he was enraged, but later he laughed. It is fitting that he saw machinery as a burden and refused to engage in it, for it is through "not recognizing, not knowing" that one becomes Hundun. This chapter discusses the Heavenly virtue of non-action, yet lest some suppose non-action must resemble the Old Man of Hanyin, it clarifies that the true technique of Hundun is to wander among the common folk without being burdened by them.]

Xun’s Exegesis: [The phrase "like boiling water" describes swiftness, as when water boils over. "Pure white" refers to the original, unadulterated quality. "Dull-eyed" depicts a lack of vitality in the gaze. "Yu-yu" is a grammatical particle, akin to the colloquial "zai-hu" used to mock scholars. "Singing alone in sorrow" describes one who elevates their tone to make their voice resound across the world, all to sell their reputation. "Humble and self-effacing" means to keep to a lowly corner. "Feigning the technique of Hundun" is to falsely claim adherence to Hundun’s methods. Hundun is the Supreme Polarity. "Recognizing one but not the other" means fixating on a single aspect without duality. "Cultivating the inner but not the outer" is to attain self-mastery while forgetting the external world. The Old Man is one who embodies clarity, returns to simplicity, practices non-action, restores uncarved simplicity, embraces his nature, holds fast to spirit, and wanders among the common folk. Zigong’s learning was not equal to this, so he was bound to be startled. Moreover, neither you nor I can comprehend the technique of Hundun—is it not fitting that he was startled? By invoking Confucius’s words, the text clarifies that Hundun ought to be preserved in its entirety.]

Zhunmang was traveling east to the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuanfeng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuanfeng asked, "Where are you going?" "To the Great Abyss," he replied. "What will you do there?" "The Great Abyss," he said, "as a thing..."

The Great Abyss may be poured into without ever filling, drawn from without ever depleting—there I shall wander."

Yuanfeng said, "Do you, Master, have no concern for the horizontal-eyed people? I would hear of sagely governance."

Zhunmang replied, "Sagely governance? Offices are bestowed without failing to suit, talents are promoted without failing to match. All matters are seen in their truth, and actions proceed as they must. Words and deeds arise from oneself, and the world is transformed. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all arrive—this is called sagely governance. Would you hear of the virtuous person?"

"The virtuous person dwells without thought, moves without calculation, harbors neither right nor wrong, neither beauty nor ugliness. Within the four seas, all share in benefit and find joy; all are provided for and find peace. They are forlorn as an infant parted from its mother, bewildered as a traveler who has lost the Way. Wealth and resources abound, yet they know not whence they come; food and drink suffice, yet they know not from where they derive—such is the bearing of the virtuous person. Would you hear of the spirit person?"

"The supreme spirit rides the light, and form vanishes away—this is called luminous vastness. Life’s mandate is fulfilled, and true nature is exhausted. Heaven and Earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve; the ten thousand things return to their true nature—this is called primordial obscurity."

Guo’s commentary: "Acting as one must and thereby entrusting all to spontaneity, words and deeds arise from oneself and transform the world. If one compels things to act, they will not be transformed. That the people of the four directions all arrive means that with a mere gesture or glance, each attains their nature, for they are left to act of themselves. The virtuous person has no thought, no calculation, following only nature. Without right or wrong in the heart, they entrust all to the world, and all within the four seas share in benefit and provision without any trace of self-interest. Virtue is the trace of the spirit person, hence it is called ‘bearing.’ Riding the light means having no light, thus form vanishes away. Without self, one entrusts all to things, empty and without attachment—this is not darkness or obstruction. Nature is exhausted, life’s mandate is fulfilled, and Heaven and Earth rejoice. Affairs do not obstruct joy, and so there are no affairs. Nature returns, and primordial obscurity leaves no trace."

Lü’s commentary: "To pour without filling, to draw without depleting—such is the abundance of Heaven’s storehouse. Yuanfeng, not knowing that it suffices without limit to meet the needs of the ten thousand things, thought the Master had no concern for the horizontal-eyed people. Bestowing offices and promoting talents without failing to suit is not to lack concern for exalting worthies and employing the capable. Seeing all matters in their truth and acting as one must is not to compel people to conceal their nature and feign compliance. Words and deeds arise from oneself, and the world is transformed; with a wave of the hand or a glance, the people all arrive—this is not to rely on rewards to encourage or punishments to deter. This is the sage’s manifestation in governance, not the means by which virtue is cultivated. The virtuous person has no thought, no calculation, harbors neither right nor wrong, neither beauty nor ugliness—their heart is ever empty. That all within the four seas share in benefit and provision brings joy, and the world delights in following them without weariness. Like an infant parted from its mother, they know not where to turn; like a traveler who has lost the Way, they know not where to go. Wealth and resources abound, yet all within the four seas share in them; food and drink suffice, yet all within the four seas are provided for—this is the bearing of the virtuous person, not the means by which the spirit is attained. The vast expanse emits light to illuminate, but the spirit rides that light to illuminate, not merely as light or the vanishing of form. Thus, though it illuminates, it is vast. Fulfilling life’s mandate means casting off the old and returning to constancy; exhausting true nature means departing from falsity and abiding in reality. The myriad affairs dissolve, the utmost of emptiness is reached, and the ten thousand things return to their true nature. Luxuriant, they return to the root; mixed, they become one; obscure, even illumination is forgotten."

Fu Mo’s commentary: "Bestowing offices without failing to suit means no office is left vacant; promoting talents without failing to match means no worthy is overlooked. Seeing all matters in their truth and acting as one must means each person unfolds their true nature without pretense. Words and deeds arise from oneself, and the world is transformed—what is done and said is for oneself alone, without intent to act for others. Not harboring right or wrong, beauty or ugliness means right and wrong, beauty and ugliness do not reside in the heart—this is what is called ‘not thinking of good, not thinking of evil.’ The supreme spirit rides the light—this is what is meant by ‘proceeding above the great brightness.’ Form vanishes away—this is what is meant by ‘entering the gate of profound obscurity.’ Thus, it illuminates and penetrates the vast and boundless, no longer confined by form, hence it is called ‘luminous vastness.’"

Men Wuwei and Chi Zhang Manji observed King Wu’s army. Chi Zhang Manji said, "Is it not inferior to the governance of Youyu? Thus it has encountered this calamity."

Men Wuwei replied, "Was the world in harmony and then Youyu governed it, or was it in chaos and then he brought order?"

Chi Zhang Manji said, "For the world to be in harmony is the wish of all—why consider Youyu’s governance as Youyu’s remedy? It is like a bald man donning a wig or a sick man seeking a physician. The filial son administers medicine to heal his compassionate father, yet his countenance is scorched. The sage feels shame for this. In the age of utmost virtue, worthies are not exalted, the capable are not employed. Superiors are like the branches of a signpost, and the people are like wild deer. Upright yet not knowing it as righteousness, loving yet not knowing it as benevolence, truthful yet not knowing it as loyalty, proper yet not knowing it as trust—clumsy creatures moving and employing one another, yet not considering it a favor. Thus, actions leave no trace, and affairs leave no record."

Guo’s commentary: "These two sages both governed through chaos, so yielding and employing armies differ only in their times—there is no superiority between them. If the world is in harmony, each wish is fulfilled—why consider Youyu’s virtue and exalt him as ruler? Men Wuwei’s words are apt. Moreover, the world all suffers from the affliction of chaos, hence they seek Youyu’s remedy. The son who administers medicine to heal his father has a scorched countenance—those who govern the world do not do so for glory. In the age of utmost virtue, the worthy occupy their proper place, not because they are exalted; the capable act of themselves, not because they are employed. Superiors are like the branches of a signpost, emerging above things yet not self-aggrandizing; inferiors are like wild deer, released and self-content. Their benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust flow from nature, not from knowledge. Clumsy creatures employ one another through their own movement, hence they act without gratitude. The capable are left to act of themselves, hence actions leave no trace; each affair is confined to its proper place, hence no record is transmitted to others."

Lü’s commentary: "Youyu governed through chaos, and King Wu also governed through chaos—who does not take the world as their concern, yet falls short? Thus, Youyu is the world’s remedy for affliction."

Those who, bald, apply false hairpieces, or, ill, seek physicians—these are cases of disorder followed by order. Grasping medicine to mend one’s father’s appearance, their countenance yet flushed with urgency, the Dao does not reach the point of mutual forgetting, and the six relations remain discordant; such "filial piety" and "compassion" are indeed what the sage feels shame for. Thus, how could the governance of Youyu be deemed forced, or surpass that of King Wu? Viewed by its traces, even Fuxi and Suiren could not be called an age of utmost virtue; viewed by its heart, the subtlety of Youyu and King Wu is precisely what is meant by an age of utmost virtue. For they act through non-action, hence leave no name; leaving no name, their conduct leaves no trace, and affairs leave no transmission—who could presume to judge between them?

Bi Xu’s commentary: "Dan Zhu was unworthy, so Chong Hua replaced him; Yin Shou was cruel and evil, so the divine martial one subdued him—neither was a state of tranquil, equal governance. The black-headed people were afflicted, so Chong Hua treated them with the medicine of benevolence and righteousness—illness seeking physicians, disorder seeking order: could this be what a good physician or filial son wishes to hear? Not exalting the worthy, hence no contention; not employing the capable, hence no failure. Superiors are like the mindless branches of a signpost; inferiors are like wild deer, self-content. This, too, is the principle of resonance: where there is wrongdoing, righteousness appears; where there is hatred, benevolence emerges; where there is deceit, loyalty is revealed."

Where there is falsehood, trust becomes manifest—without the four principles above, the four matters below also vanish. The servitude of creatures in motion arises naturally, not as a bestowed favor. Without traces or transmission, it is not deemed extraordinary.

The filial son does not flatter his parents; the loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the flourishing of the minister-son. When parents’ words are heeded and their deeds deemed good, the world calls such a child unworthy. When the lord’s words are heeded and his deeds deemed good, the world calls such a minister unworthy. Yet how can this not be the natural way? What the world calls "heeding" is heeded, what it calls "good" is deemed good—yet it does not call such a one a flatterer.

Is it then that custom is stricter than kinship and more revered than lordship? To call a man "Dao-guided" provokes sudden anger; to call him a flatterer stirs instant outrage—yet all their lives, they guide others, all their lives, they flatter others. They assemble parables, adorn their words, and gather crowds, yet from beginning to end, root to branch, they do not hold themselves accountable. They drape themselves in robes, display vibrant colors, alter their expressions to ingratiate themselves with the age, yet never admit to being flatterers or followers of such men. They reconcile right and wrong yet never acknowledge themselves as common fools—the height of folly!

One who knows his folly is not utterly foolish; one who knows his confusion is not utterly confused. The utterly confused never awaken in their lifetime; the utterly foolish never gain wisdom. If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may yet be reached—for the confused are few. If two are confused, the effort is laborious and the goal unattained—for the confused prevail.

Yet now, with the whole world confused, though I have aspirations, they cannot be realized. Is this not lamentable? The great voice does not reach the ears of the village.

Breaking the yellow blossoms elicits a sudden burst of laughter—thus lofty speech never reaches the hearts of the common folk, and profound words do not emerge from vulgar speech, for the latter prevails.

To be led astray by two earthen jars and bells is to lose one’s way. Yet now, with the whole world deluded, though I have aspirations, how could they be realized? Knowing they cannot be realized and yet forcing them is but another delusion. Therefore, it is best to let go and not impose; if not imposed, who would share the sorrow?

**Guo’s Commentary:**
When one assents to the words of ruler or parent and acts with goodness, this merely defies convention to follow authority—hence the world calls it unfilial. Yet where lies true rightness? The world does not revere ruler or parent by following them, nor does it condemn flattery when one follows convention. If reverence cannot subdue others, then submission lies in conformity. Thus the sage never stands apart from the age but moves with its ebb and flow: when the age is august, he is august; when it is royal, he is royal. How could he oppose convention to impose himself?

The world deems conformity correct, calling it "guidance" or "flattery." Yet one may reject such terms with indignation while spending a lifetime in guidance, never seeking the Dao but merely striving to please. Those who reconcile metaphors, adorn words, and incur the charge of flattery—yet the world rewards them, gathers around them, and never faults their conformity. They reconcile right and wrong without calling themselves common folk, yet the world is so utterly foolish that it cannot but follow. The sage’s Dao is one, but the traces of emperors and kings differ—truly, the world’s delusion is insoluble. Thus one must follow and yield to it.

Though the whole world is deluded, though I possess the aspiration to seek the supreme Dao, it remains unattainable. Thus Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu merely followed their times. The great voice is not esteemed in narrow lanes; when vulgar folk hear a lewd tune, they laugh in unison. This is why the world never employs the sage but always relies on itself.

To be led astray by two earthen jars and bells is to lose one’s way—each clings to their own convictions, unaware of their destination. Better to align with them. Let go and do not impose; if not imposed, who would share the sorrow? Strive to suit the moment, and without forcing understanding, all may live without worry in this world.

**Following the Original Text:**
What the world calls loyal ministers and filial sons—those who admonish their superiors when they err and refuse flattery—are deemed flatterers if they follow ruler or parent. Yet those who follow worldly convention are never called flatterers. Does this mean one dares to admonish ruler or parent but not the world? Is the world more severe than kin, more revered than rulers?

Men reject the name of flattery, yet their conduct is a lifelong pursuit of it. They blend metaphors, embellish words, and seek to gather followers—what is this if not flattery? Yet they remain unaware. In one person, beginning and end, root and branch, never align in fault.

Below, this is applied to Shun: he donned robes and ruled the world, adorning the five colors with reverent dignity. Thus it is said: "He donned robes, displayed colors, and altered his expression." Shun thus ingratiated himself with the age yet never called himself a flatterer. He reconciled right and wrong without deeming himself one with the common folk—this is the height of folly!

The following uses conduct as analogy: if three walk together eastward and one wishes to go west, only one is deluded—there remains a chance of reaching the east. If two wish to go west, the deluded prevail, and the effort is laborious, the goal unattained.

*Yu Chi and Zhang Manji* (the speaker’s self-reference): "Though I have aspirations, they cannot be realized."

Below, music serves as analogy: earthen jars and bells (like the jars Qin kings struck) are ancient music, unpleasing to the masses. When vulgar music is heard, they rejoice. If two strike earthen jars as instruments, people delight in the novelty and are led astray—ancient music cannot prevail. Now, with the whole world deluded, though I have aspirations, how could they be realized? The repeated analogy deepens the lament.

The phrase "losing one’s way" connects to the prior section: above, it referred to conduct; here, to the path of music.

Here, these discussions concern the era of Youyu, and of King Wu there need be no further mention.

There was a man of Li who, when his son was born in the dead of night, hastily fetched fire to examine him, anxious lest the child resemble himself. Guo’s commentary: *"Li refers to an evil man. It means that none in the world wish to be evil—those who do evil are either driven by harsh servitude or deluded and lose their nature. Yet the deluded may reflect and return, while the evil may reflect and reform. Thus, if I do nothing, the world will transform itself."*

Fu Mo observes: *"The man of Li, fearing his son would resemble him, shows that all people know themselves—yet the profoundly foolish and confused may live their entire lives without understanding. Those who lack awareness are even less perceptive than the man of Li. This is meant to provoke deep reflection, conveying meaning beyond words."*

A century-old tree, split to make sacrificial goblets, is painted with azure and yellow patterns. Yet its offcuts lie discarded in the ditch. Compared to the goblets, the ditch’s scraps differ in beauty and ugliness, but in the loss of their nature, they are one and the same. Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen or Shi Qiu may differ in conduct and righteousness, yet in the loss of their nature, they are equal.

Moreover, the loss of nature takes five forms:
First, the five colors confuse the eyes, leaving them unclear.
Second, the five sounds confuse the ears, leaving them dull.
Third, the five odors cloy the nose, congesting the forehead.
Fourth, the five flavors cloy the mouth, leaving it numb and impaired.
Fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, causing the nature to scatter and soar.
These five are all harms to life.

Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, striving apart, claim to have attained something—this is not what I call attainment. For if one’s attainment is merely distress, can it truly be called attainment?

Within the cage, the turtledove and owl may likewise claim attainment.
Moreover, chasing after sounds and colors to stifle the inner self,
donning kingfisher-feathered caps and sashes, clutching tablets and girding long ribbons to constrain the outer form—
within, the limbs swell against the inner bars;
without, layers of cords and snares entangle.
Though trapped within cords and snares, gazing fixedly, they still believe themselves to have attained—
then the bound prisoner, arms crossed and fingers contorted, or the tiger and leopard caged in sacks and pens,
may likewise claim attainment.

The five colors do not clarify but rather obscure; it is clarity that perceives colors.
The five sounds do not sharpen but rather dull; it is acuity that perceives sounds.
Extending this principle, the five odors congest the nose, the five flavors numb the mouth,
and preferences and aversions agitate the heart—
all act in this same manner.
Without preferences or aversions, the heart would remain undisturbed;
it is the agitation of preferences and aversions that scatters the nature, ceaselessly soaring.
Those like Yang Zhu and Mo Di, though undoubtedly talented scholars of the world,
never heard the Dao. Their knowledge did not extend beyond these five senses.
Thus, striving apart, they claimed attainment—
then the turtledove and owl in their cages may likewise claim attainment.
Stifling the inner self so the Dao cannot gather,
constraining the outer form so the heart cannot be freed—
with the limbs swollen against the inner bars and layers of cords and snares without,
from the perspective of one who has attained true liberation, their entrapment within cords and snares is plain to see.
Yet still they believe themselves to have attained—
then the bound prisoner, arms crossed and fingers contorted, or the tiger and leopard caged in sacks and pens,
may likewise claim attainment.

As Laozi said: "The five colors make men’s eyes blind; the five sounds make men’s ears deaf; the five flavors dull men’s palates."
For man’s life is by nature tranquil, undisturbed by external things;
his virtue is profound, unshaken by change.
Yet when false realms arise before him, the wellspring of spirit daily grows obscured,
until he forgets his priceless inherent nobility and pursues endless, decaying desires—
how could he not be deluded?
This is why the noble person values frugality.

The shards discarded in the ditch, repurposed as sacrificial chalices—what difference lies between glory and disgrace? Both are but withered wood. This aligns with the parable of Zang and Gu losing their sheep: sounds and colors, scents and flavors—all suffice to disorder one’s nature. The four are thus paired with pursuit and rejection to restrain them.

A *kunzong* is one who clashes with others; the bridge of the nose connects to the forehead. A "fouled mouth" defiles the speech. *Lishuang* denotes deviation and loss. Pursuit and rejection, right and wrong, likes and dislikes—when these muddle the heart, one’s natural nature is lost. The teachings of Yang Zhu and Mo Di are those that disorder the heart through pursuit and rejection. Though they entrap themselves with their doctrines, they claim attainment—if this is attainment, then a turtledove in a cage may likewise claim it. Such condemnation is severe indeed.

Their pursuit and rejection, their right and wrong, obstruct the chest—thus "their inner being is like kindling." The cap and sash of the scholar-official, the restraint of ritual—thus "their outer form is bound." Within, obstruction and fullness press like a palisade; without, ritual and form confine like fetters. Though others see their self-inflicted suffering as entrapment, they believe themselves to have attained—then the bound prisoner, the tiger in the cage, may likewise claim attainment. Here, the criticism of Yang and Mo reaches its sharpest point.

A Comprehensive Overview in My Limited View

This essay first discusses the great transformations of Heaven and Earth and the multitude of beings. For one who rules all under Heaven, in all observations, proceed with the Dao in straightforward conduct, govern with virtue through non-action and desirelessness, and ensure clear division of official duties—thus, among things that differ yet are made the same, none may deviate.

Nothing is greater than Heaven and Earth; nothing is more revered than the Dao and virtue. The sage’s Dao encompasses both covering and bearing, hence it is rightfully paired with them. The *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] elucidates the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is the Way by which one unifies Heaven and Earth, governs the myriad things, and rules all under Heaven.

People see the sage’s multifaceted responses to things and suspect his wisdom and clarity far surpass others, yet they do not know these arise from the emptiness of the heart and non-action. Thus, one who possesses the virtue to rule all under Heaven establishes the root and source to rectify what lies within the self—then Heaven and Earth need not await union to unite, and the myriad beings need not await transformation to be transformed. Gazing, there is no form; listening, there is no sound—yet profound resonance and wondrous responses are unceasing.

Thus, the Yellow Emperor relinquished the mysterious pearl, and Xiangwang obtained it; Emperor Yao sought to yield to Nieque, and Xu You admonished him—this is to say, the Dao cannot be sought with intention, nor attained through wisdom and clarity. At Huafeng, the three blessings were requested of the sage, who then distributed wealth and conferred offices, ascending as an immortal of a thousand years—what encumbrance could there be? Zigao declined the lords and plowed in the wilds, demonstrating that when virtue declines, punishments arise; when worthy men retreat and the law is concealed, calamities accumulate, and chaos begins.

Therefore, one must return to the Great Beginning and Non-Being to thoroughly investigate the original nature of things and the source of life and destiny. When virtue aligns with the primordial, things will transform of themselves. Whether one affirms or denies, acts or does not, serves with reverence and frugality, or upholds impartial loyalty—these are but external exertions of the heart.

The shame of the man of Hanyin in using machinery, King Wu’s leading of troops to save the people—one embraces simplicity and guards authenticity, the other employs expedience to achieve righteousness. Their actions differ, yet neither departs from the Dao. As for those who terrify others like the madman Zisi, or the utterly deluded who remain benighted all their lives, or those who carve the unhewn into vessels, disturbing the heart and harming nature—if virtue is insufficient to preserve life, how can they govern all under Heaven? All such cases are those who mistake suffering for attainment, like the bitter toil of Yang and Mo, which is scarcely worth emulating.

To compare them to turtledoves and tigers is not merely to belittle them but to despise them most severely.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Dao of Heaven**

The Dao of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus all things are brought to completion. The Dao of the Emperor operates without accumulation, thus all under Heaven submit. The Dao of the Sage operates without accumulation, thus all within the seas yield. One who is enlightened by Heaven, attuned to the Sage, and whose virtue is all-pervading and all-embracing—such a one acts of their own accord, yet remains profoundly still, without exception.

The stillness of the sage is not stillness for its own sake but stillness born of inherent goodness. When nothing in the myriad things can disturb the heart, stillness naturally follows. When water is still, it clearly reflects the brows and beard; its level surface serves as the carpenter’s standard. If still water can be so luminous, how much more so the spirit? The sage’s heart, in its stillness, mirrors Heaven and Earth and reflects the myriad things.

Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, simplicity, quiescence, and non-action—these are the level of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of the Dao and virtue. Thus do emperors, kings, sages, and worthies find repose in them. In repose, there is vacuity; in vacuity, there is fullness; in fullness, there is order. In vacuity, there is stillness; in stillness, there is movement; in movement, there is attainment. Stillness is non-action; in non-action, those charged with affairs bear their responsibilities. In non-action, there is ease; in ease, cares and troubles cannot abide, and longevity is attained.

Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, simplicity, quiescence, and non-action—these are the root of the myriad things. He who understands this and faces south becomes a Yao as ruler; he who understands this and faces north becomes a Shun as minister. By this, one embodies the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven; by this, one follows the Dao of the obscure sage and unadorned king. By this, one retires to wander among rivers, seas, mountains, and forests, and the people submit; by this, one advances to govern the world, and great merit and illustrious fame are achieved, uniting all under Heaven.

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
The Dao of Heaven, the Dao of the Emperor, and the Dao of the Sage—these three allow things to follow their nature without hindrance. Though all-pervading and all-embracing, they do not disrupt stillness. Stillness born of goodness will move in due time. When nothing in the myriad things can disturb the heart, one attains self-realization. If still water can be so luminous, how much more so the sage’s heart in stillness? For it possesses the capacity to let things be as they are, and thus its illumination is utterly penetrating. The level of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of the Dao and virtue arise from non-action. Repose does not mean inaction; movement attains its end when it does not lose its proper cause.

"Those charged with affairs bear their responsibilities" means that in non-action, the myriad talents and things each fulfill their duties and bear their own burdens. Thus, Shun and Yu possessed all under Heaven yet did not interfere—this is what is meant. "Ease" describes a state of unhurried self-possession. When one understands that the root of the myriad things lies in non-action, whether facing south or north, whether in high or low position, one attains the perfection of non-action. One who possesses the Dao and is followed by all under Heaven yet lacks rank is called an "unadorned king," valuing the Dao above all. By this, one retires to wander in seclusion like Xu You and Chao Fu, or advances to govern the world like Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou.

The scope of non-action is vast—what can it not accomplish? If the ruler does not assume the duties of the chief minister, then Yi and Lü remain still in their offices. If the chief minister does not take up the tasks of the hundred officials, then the hundred officials remain still in their governance. If the hundred officials do not interfere with the affairs of the common people, then the common people remain still and secure in their occupations. If the common people do not alter their natural abilities, then all under Heaven remains still in self-realization. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, down to the insects—who can achieve anything through action? Thus, the more one embodies non-action, the more exalted one becomes.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
Heaven and Earth revolve endlessly yet never accumulate anything, thus the myriad things are completed without carving or chiseling. The Dao of the Emperor encompasses ten thousand affairs in a single day yet never accumulates anything, thus all under Heaven submits without seeking favor. The Dao of the Sage is nowhere absent yet never accumulates anything, thus all under Heaven yields without coercion. One who is enlightened by Heaven and attuned to the Sage, knowing that all things operate without accumulation, embodies the all-pervading and all-embracing virtue of emperors and kings. In operation, there is endless transformation; without accumulation, there is nothing that lingers in the breast. Even one’s own actions become obscure, as if one has not acted at all—how much more so when others act in their own ways?

The stillness of the sage is not stillness for its own sake but stillness born of inherent goodness. If stillness were deemed good and then pursued, it would not be true stillness. When nothing in the myriad things can disturb the heart, stillness is its natural state—not something achieved through stillness. Why? The myriad things are born through me; if I do not give birth to them, what can disturb me? Thus, in their bustling activity, one observes their return; in their profusion, one sees their root. In returning to the root, they are naturally still.

If still water can be so luminous, how much more so the spirit, which extends above and coils below, pervading all without limit, and resides in the sage’s heart? Its stillness is not merely like water reflecting brows and beard or serving as a level standard—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the reflection of the myriad things. Vacuity means nothing opposes it; stillness means unity without change; tranquility means peace in unknowing; simplicity means no entanglement with things; quiescence means utter motionlessness; non-action means harmony with the void. These six are the sage’s means of non-action, the level of Heaven and Earth, and the perfection of the Dao and virtue—where emperors, kings, sages, and worthies find repose.

When responding to the myriad changes and supplying the needs of the myriad things, if one lacks this, there is no repose, and the spirit is wearied by the multitude of affairs. How can one attain vacuity? Vacuity means hollowing the heart, concealing affairs, and possessing the myriad differences. Thus, vacuity leads to fullness; though things differ, their principle remains unconfused. Vacuity is not merely fullness in order but also stillness in movement and attainment in action. Who can remain tranquil amid prolonged movement? Stillness in movement means acting only when necessary and appropriately—thus movement attains its end.

Attaining vacuity to the point of stillness means nothing in the myriad things can disturb the heart, and non-action allows those charged with affairs to bear their responsibilities without my labor. In ease, there is no circumstance that does not accord; where can cares and troubles abide? Thus, longevity is attained. The root of the myriad things lies in non-action. He who understands this and faces south becomes a Yao as ruler; he who understands this and faces north becomes a Shun as minister. By this, one embodies the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven, or follows the Dao of the obscure sage and unadorned king. By this, one retires to wander in seclusion, and the people submit; by this, one advances to govern the world, achieving great merit, illustrious fame, and the unity of all under Heaven.

Understanding the discourse on emptiness and stillness, one finds that tranquility, indifference, silence, and desolation are but the same—only the terms differ. The teeming myriad things all grow from non-action, which is their root. The sages of antiquity, some faced south as Yao, some faced north as Shun; some dwelt above with the virtue of emperors and kings, the Son of Heaven, while others dwelt below with the Dao of obscure sages and unadorned kings. Some retired to wander in seclusion, others advanced to govern the world—yet their clarity regarding the root of the myriad things was one and the same.

*Brush Jottings*:
No accumulation, no stagnation. The imperial Dao refers to the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven; the sagely Dao refers to the Way of obscure sages and unadorned kings. These correspond to the branches, while the old annotations that assign them separately to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are incorrect. "Six penetrations and four openings" (六通四辟): *bi* (辟) is synonymous with *pi* (闢), meaning the six directions and four quarters are all thoroughly pervaded. "Obscure and dim" (昧然) means that keen hearing and sharp sight are entirely extinguished. "Level and centered" (平中) is the standard by which the great craftsman takes his measure, as in the *Rites of Zhou*, where the artisan levels the ground with a plumb line.

Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, silence, desolation, and non-action—these are the standards by which Heaven and Earth are aligned. Thus it is said: "The levelness of Heaven and Earth." *Yuyu* (俞俞) means contentment, like entering a state of ease. When one attains self-mastery, sorrow and grief cannot enter, and the body never declines. Thus it is said: "In *yuyu*, cares and troubles cannot abide, and longevity is attained." "Root" refers to the fundamental source. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all arise from emptiness and stillness, hence "the root of the myriad things." This is further expounded to make known that one’s security and destiny lie therein.

Stillness makes one sagely; movement makes one kingly. Non-action is revered, and simplicity is such that none under Heaven can rival its beauty. He who clearly understands the virtue of Heaven and Earth is called one who grasps the great root and great origin, who harmonizes with Heaven. This is how one harmonizes and regulates all under Heaven, and harmonizes with others. Harmonizing with others is called human joy; harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy. *Zhuangzi* says: "My master! My master! Who grinds up the myriad things yet is not cruel, who bestows blessings upon ten thousand generations yet is not benevolent, who is older than high antiquity yet is not long-lived, who covers and supports Heaven and Earth, carves and shapes the myriad forms yet is not skillful—this is called Heavenly joy." Thus it is said: "He who knows Heavenly joy lives by the movement of Heaven; when he dies, he transforms with things." Still, he shares virtue with yin; in movement, he shares the current with yang. Therefore, he who knows Heavenly joy bears no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no entanglement with things, and no curse from spirits. Thus it is said: "In movement, he is Heaven; in stillness, he is Earth." When the mind is settled and one rules all under Heaven, spirits do not haunt, and the soul does not weary. When the mind is settled, the myriad things submit. To extend emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, and to penetrate the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the heart of the sage by which he nurtures all under Heaven.

*Guo’s Commentary*:
Acting when it is time to act, ceasing when it is time to cease—naturally, all things revere and uphold him. Thus, only simplicity can rival the beauty of Heaven. He who harmonizes with Heaven regards non-action as the virtue of Heaven and Earth. By clarifying this root and origin, he does not oppose Heaven and Earth. He who harmonizes with others follows Heaven to respond to humanity, so when Heavenly harmony is complete, human harmony is also fulfilled. When Heavenly joy is attained, human joy is sufficient. "Grinding" (韲) means things changing and mixing together—it is merely their self-transformation, not the cruelty of my master. "Benevolence" (仁) is the name for universal love, but there is no love, so there is nothing to call benevolence. "Longevity" (寿) refers to distant expectations, but there are no expectations, so there is nothing to call longevity. "Skill" (巧) refers to the marvels of craft, but all things are self-so, so there is nothing to call skill. This is Heavenly joy—forgetting joy, yet joy is sufficient. Thus, in stillness, he shares virtue with yin; in movement, he shares the current with yang. Though movement and stillness differ, the mind is one. Always without mind, he rules all under Heaven without weariness. If my mind is at peace, the minds of the myriad things are connected; connected, they submit; disconnected, they rebel. What does the heart of the sage do to nurture all under Heaven? It is nothing but Heavenly joy.

*Lü’s Commentary*:
"Stillness makes one sagely" refers to the inner; "movement makes one kingly" refers to the outer. Non-action is revered, so those who serve under Heaven have no affairs to interfere with their talents. Knowing simplicity, none can rival its beauty, so those who govern all under Heaven have no need for ornamentation. It is simply a matter of clearly understanding the virtue of Heaven and Earth. Thus, whether dwelling above or below, advancing to govern or retiring to seclusion, though their paths differ, their great root and great origin are never distinct. Understanding this, one acts without action and harmonizes with Heaven; regulating all under Heaven, one harmonizes with others. Harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy; harmonizing with others is called human joy. It is merely a matter of taking this as one’s master. Grinding up things without cruelty, blessing generations without benevolence, shaping the myriad forms without skill—this is what *Zhuangzi* took as his master. Following the inherent inclinations of one’s heart as one’s master—who lacks a master? Thus, this joy does not come from without, and so it is called Heavenly joy. He who knows Heavenly joy lives by the movement of Heaven, and I have never been born; he dies and transforms with things, and I have never died. In stillness, he shares virtue with yin, yet does not know it as stillness; in movement, he shares the current with yang, yet does not know it as movement. He bears no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, because he has never been in their realm. He is unburdened by things, unaccused by spirits, because he has never been in his own. In movement, he is Heaven; in stillness, he is Earth. When the mind is settled and one rules all under Heaven, spirits do not haunt, and the soul does not weary. When the mind is settled, the myriad things submit.

The reason Earth is as it is lies solely in the settling of the one mind. Thus, when one rules all under Heaven, externally, spirits do not haunt, and internally, the soul does not weary—how could the myriad things fail to submit? The mind settles because it is never not empty, never not still. I can extend this emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is the Heavenly joy, the heart with which the sage nurtures all under Heaven.

**Limited Insight:**
The Dao within humans—when still, it is sageliness; when in motion, it is kingship. Both are exalted through non-action, beautiful in simplicity, just as the virtue of Heaven and Earth has never been contrived, never adorned, yet the movements of yin and yang, the four seasons, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers—are they not all manifestations of its workings and brilliance? This principle establishes the great root and great origin of all under Heaven. This root and origin are the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship, the harmony with Heaven. When applied to harmonize all under Heaven, it brings harmony with others—human joy and Heavenly joy both arise from harmony. Though their names differ, the source of their joy is one. Not harming things is not called cruelty; benefiting the world is not called benevolence—this is the forgetting of good and evil. Extending to the forgetting of longevity and skill, this is not constrained by time, not bound by ability or inability. The *Nanhua* takes this as its master, and this alone. In life, it moves with the natural course of Heaven; in death, it transforms with things. Movement must have its limit. Thus, in movement and stillness, it accords with the Heavenly Dao, bearing no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no burden from things, no reproach from spirits—this clarifies the source of its joy. In movement, it is Heaven; in stillness, it is Earth. This is the meaning of sharing virtue with yin and flowing with yang. When the one mind is settled and non-action prevails, all under Heaven turns toward it. Without reproach from spirits, spirits do not haunt; without burden from things, the soul does not weary. Conduct is blameless before the hidden and manifest—how could things fail to submit? There is no other reason than extending the principle of utmost emptiness and guarded stillness to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things. The heart with which the sage nurtures all under Heaven—how could it lie beyond this?

The virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, one employs all under Heaven with ease; in action, one is employed by all under Heaven and falls short. Thus, the ancients valued non-action. When the ruler practices non-action, the subjects also practice non-action—this is the subjects sharing virtue with the ruler. When the subjects practice non-action, the ruler also practices non-action—this is the ruler sharing the Way with the subjects. If the subjects act, the ruler also acts—this is the ruler not ruling. If the ruler must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven, the subjects must act to be employed by all under Heaven—this is the unchanging Dao. Therefore, the ancient rulers of all under Heaven, though their wisdom encompassed Heaven and Earth, did not rely on their own plans; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not rely on their own explanations; though their abilities exhausted the seas and lands, they did not rely on their own actions. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success. Thus, nothing is more spirit-like than Heaven, nothing more abundant than Earth, nothing greater than emperors and kings. Therefore, the virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth—this is the Way of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the human realm.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
"Employing all under Heaven with ease" means having leisure. If one busily seeks to be used by things, one can be made a subject. Yet even as a subject, one has ease. The craftsman does not act in carving wood but acts in using the axe; the ruler does not act in handling affairs but acts in employing ministers. When ministers handle affairs and the ruler employs ministers, when the axe carves wood and the craftsman uses the axe, each fulfills their capacity—this is the natural principle of Heaven, not contrivance. If the ruler takes over the affairs of ministers, he is no longer a ruler; if ministers wield the ruler’s authority, they are no longer ministers. Thus, when each attends to their duties, the principle of non-action reaches its perfection. Those who employ all under Heaven also act, but this acting arises from following their nature, hence it is called non-action. Those who are employed by all under Heaven also act on their own, but since those below handle affairs, even Yao and Yu as ministers are called "acting." Thus, in the context of ruler and subject, the ruler is still and the subject is active; in the context of antiquity and the present, Yao and Shun practiced non-action while Tang and Wu had affairs. Yet each acted according to their nature, and the celestial mechanism unfolded—who in antiquity or the present, ruler or subject, truly acted? The ruler’s error lies in being unable to practice non-action and instead taking over the duties of ministers. If Gao Yao could not exercise his judgment and Hou Ji could not carry out his planting, then all talents would lose their roles, and the ruler would be burdened by labor. Thus, the ruler dons the imperial crown, veils his eyes, and entrusts all under Heaven to them—when all under Heaven can act on their own, this is non-action that accomplishes everything. Therefore, both ruler and subject practice non-action. When the ruler practices non-action, he employs those below; when those below practice non-action, they act on their own. The transformation and nurturing of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—this is what is meant by "naturally so." Emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success—success arises from them, aligning with the non-action of Heaven and Earth.

The Lü commentary states: "In non-action, one person employs all under Heaven, and all under Heaven serves that person—thus there is abundance. In action, all under Heaven employs one person, and that person serves all under Heaven—thus there is insufficiency. Is it not clear? Heaven does not act with pure virtue; virtue is simply non-action. Therefore, when the superior practices non-action, the inferior also practices non-action, aligning with the superior—this is called 'accord with virtue and the Dao.' Thus, there is Heaven and there is humanity: non-action is the honored Way of Heaven, while action is the encumbrance of the human Way. Therefore, when the inferior acts, the superior also acts, aligning with the inferior—this is called 'speaking of the Dao.' The superior must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven, while the inferior must act to be employed by all under Heaven. This is the unchanging Dao.

Thus, the ancient kings of all under Heaven knew not to deliberate for themselves, for all under Heaven deliberated for them; not to speak for themselves, for all under Heaven spoke for them; not to act for themselves, for all under Heaven acted for them. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform—it is not that I produce them. Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured—it is not that I nurture them. Emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success—it is not that I accomplish it. This is why Heaven is divine, Earth is abundant, and emperors and kings are great. Non-action is how the Dao rides Heaven and Earth, gallops through the myriad things, and governs the human realm.

The root lies with the superior, the branches with the inferior; the essential lies with the ruler, the details with the ministers. The deployment of the three armies and the five weapons is the branch of virtue. Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the five punishments, and the establishment of laws are the branch of teaching. Ritual, laws, measurements, punishments, names, and precedents are the detailed governance of order. The sounds of bells and drums, the forms of feathered banners, are the branch of music. Weeping, mourning garments, and the gradations of funeral attire are the branch of grief. These five branches require the operation of spirit and the movement of the mind’s art before they can follow.

The branches were practiced by the ancients, but they are not what should come first. The ruler precedes the minister, the father precedes the son, the elder brother precedes the younger, the elder precedes the younger, the man precedes the woman, the husband precedes the wife—this is the order of precedence in human relations, following the course of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the sage takes this as a model: Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—this is the position of the divine and the bright. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things transform and take shape, flourishing and declining, changing and flowing—all have their inherent patterns. If even Heaven and Earth, though supremely divine, have an order of honor and precedence, how much more so does the human Way?

In ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, respect is honored; in village communities, age is honored; in conduct, worthiness is honored—this is the order of the Great Dao. To speak of the Dao while violating its order is not the Dao. To speak of the Dao while not following the Dao—how can one grasp the Dao?"

The Guo commentary states: "Spirit and the mind’s art are the root of the five branches. If allowed to move naturally, the branches of the five affairs will rise of themselves without need for effort—this is why the root comes first. Though the precedence of ruler and minister, father and son, is a human affair, it arises from the utmost principle and is not something the sage fabricated. Clearly, the order of honor and precedence is something even things cannot be without. The order of the Great Dao is not merely what human relations honor—it is why the Dao is taken as having order."

The Lü commentary states: "Knowing the five branches requires the operation of spirit and the mind’s art before they can follow. Thus, the so-called 'emptiness, tranquility, stillness, and non-action' are the very Way to preserve spirit, clarify the mind’s art, and nurture the root. Nurture the root, and the branches will follow. The branches were practiced by the ancients, but they are not what should come first. The ruler precedes the minister... down to the husband preceding the wife—this is the order of honor in the human Way. Even Heaven, though divine, holds the honored position above, while Earth, though bright, resides below. Spring and summer generate and come first, while autumn and winter complete and follow. From the myriad things’ initial transformation to their sprouting and taking shape, from the subtle to the manifest, all have their forms—flourishing and decline, change and transformation all have their inherent patterns and cannot be altered. If even Heaven and Earth, though unfathomably divine, have an order of honor and precedence, how can the root and branches, the superior and inferior of the human Way, be reversed?

Not only the precedence of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brother arise from the principle of Heaven and Earth. Even in ancestral temples, court, village communities, and conduct—wherever one is at a given time—each has what it honors and cannot be disordered. All are but the order of the Great Dao. Thus, to speak of the Dao while violating its order—how can one grasp the Dao?"

The Oral Explanation states: "From this point onward, it further discusses action, taking non-action as the root and action as the branch. The essential lies with the ruler’s non-action, while the details lie with the minister’s action. Military power and civil virtue are auxiliary—thus it is said, 'The deployment of the three armies and the five weapons is the branch of virtue.' The five weapons are the bow, *shu*, spear, halberd, and shield. Clarifying punishments to assist teaching—thus it is said, 'Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the five punishments, and the establishment of laws are the branch of teaching.' Measurements and gradations, names and things, precedents and examples, meticulous details—all are the branch of governance."

"Rites, laws, measurements, gradations, bells, drums, feathered banners—none of these are the root of ritual and music. As it is said, 'Is it only about jade and silk, bells and drums?' These are but the branches of mourning. Thus, it is better to grieve sincerely than to merely follow its outward forms. The movement of intent and spirit, the activation of the mind’s art—these arise first, and the external forms follow. This is to say, all branches originate from the inner heart. The ancients had scholars who understood this, yet what should come first is not what they took as primary. What should come first is emptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, and non-action—nothing more.

From this perspective, how could Zhuangzi ever have intended to entirely abandon the use of military power, punishments, ritual, and music? What should come first comes first; what should come after comes after—all are the natural principles of Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said, 'Nobility and humility, priority and posteriority, are the movements of Heaven and Earth.' The sage takes them as models. Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—these are also metaphors. *Hua* means transformation; *zuo* means generation. As the *Book of Songs* says of the *wei* plant, 'It grows, it stops'—this is an example. *Meng meng* refers to sprouts; *qu qu* refers to distinctions. This speaks of how things are born and their forms differ. Changing with the times, first flourishing and then declining—this too is a metaphor for the order of priority and posteriority, the gradations of flourishing and decline.

That which flourishes does not flourish in a single moment; that which declines does not decline in a single moment—all have their sequence. Thus, the gradations of flourishing and decline arise from priority and posteriority, and priority and posteriority also apply to nobility and humility. In conducting affairs, esteeming worthiness means prioritizing the worthy in assigning duties. Age and rank, nobility and worthiness—these too are the natural principles of the world. Thus it is said, 'This is the order of the Great Dao.' How can one grasp the Dao if one does not know its order?

In ancestral temples, kinship is esteemed, and the generations of the *zhao* and *mu* are arranged in sequence."

The newly transmitted text states: The preceding passage clarifies this by showing how [Yao] faced north to serve as Shun’s minister—thus, the Way of the minister should be non-action. Here, it further speaks of "the end lying below" and "the details pertaining to the minister," where the earlier passage addressed the mind and this one addresses the proper station. Where there is a root, there must be an end—how could the end ever depart from the root? The root is simply the principle of non-action. Knowing this principle and following it, the Five Relations proceed of themselves. Thus it is said, "These five require the movement of spirit and the activation of the mind’s art before they can be followed."

Master Zhuang deeply understood the principle of spontaneity—what is called "knowing Heaven"—and here, in speaking of the order of ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brother, husband and wife, male and female, nobility and humility, priority and posteriority, he also demonstrated what is called "knowing man." Xunzi criticized Zhuangzi for being obscured by Heaven and not knowing man—how could this be a case of not knowing man?

Therefore, those of old who illuminated the Great Dao first illuminated Heaven, then followed with virtue and power. Once virtue and power were illuminated, benevolence and righteousness followed. Once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, the observance of distinctions followed. Once distinctions were illuminated, forms and names followed. Once forms and names were illuminated, the delegation of tasks followed. Once tasks were delegated, the tracing of origins and examination of outcomes followed. Once origins and outcomes were traced and examined, right and wrong followed. Once right and wrong were illuminated, rewards and punishments followed. Once rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise found their proper places, the noble and the base assumed their stations, the benevolent and the worthy, the unworthy and the compliant—each followed their nature, each fulfilled their capacities, each adhered to their names.

With this, one serves superiors; with this, one nurtures inferiors; with this, one governs things; with this, one cultivates the self. Wisdom and schemes are not employed, for one must return to Heaven—this is called the Great Peace, the ultimate of governance.

Thus, the *Book* says: "There are forms, there are names." Forms and names existed among the ancients, but they were not what came first. Those who spoke of the Great Dao in ancient times underwent five transformations before forms and names could be established, nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be discussed. To rush to speak of forms and names is to not know the root; to rush to speak of rewards and punishments is to not know the beginning. To speak in a way that inverts the Dao is to go against the Dao and yet claim understanding—what men govern, how can one govern men?

To rush to speak of forms and names, rewards and punishments—this is to possess the tools of governance but not the Way of governance. Such things may be applied to the world, but they are insufficient to govern the world. These are called "disputers," men of partial understanding. Rituals, laws, measures, and degrees; forms, names, and detailed comparisons—these existed among the ancients. They are what inferiors use to serve superiors, not what superiors use to nurture inferiors. (Wu: Sima [Biao] explains: "transverse.")

Guo’s Annotation:
["Heaven" refers to spontaneity. Once spontaneity is made clear, things attain their Dao; when things attain their Dao, harmony and principle naturally align. When principle aligns, there is no loss of their proper roles; when roles are properly apportioned, each thing’s name accords with its form. Once forms and names are clarified, nothing remains to be altered—thus, following and entrusting come next. When things are entrusted to themselves, blame and responsibility dissolve. Next comes discernment: attaining one’s nature is deemed right, losing one’s nature is deemed wrong. Thus, right and wrong come next, and from there, rewards and punishments—these are the retribution for loss and attainment.

The Way of perfect governance originates in Heaven and culminates here. "Treading one’s position" means each speaks according to their capacity; "following one’s nature" means each acts according to their innate abilities. "Necessarily distinguishing their capacities" means no interchange of duties; "necessarily following their names" means names match reality, so proceeding from name to reality avoids excess.

From the clarification of Heaven to forms and names is the fifth stage; to rewards and punishments is the ninth—all follow the natural sequence of before and after. Those who govern others must adhere to this sequence, and the Way of governance shines brightly. Heaven does not abandon rewards and punishments, but one must not lose the order of before and after.

Those who employ the world must thoroughly comprehend the Way of following sequence, entrusting these matters to the multitude of talents—this is how superiors nurture inferiors.]

Lü’s Annotation:
["Heaven" is the ultimate of nature and destiny. To clarify the Dao without understanding Heaven is to call what is not the Dao "Dao," and what is not virtue "virtue." Only the true Dao and true virtue give rise to benevolence and righteousness. With benevolence on the left and righteousness on the right, there are distinctions and observances, forms become visible, and names can be spoken. With forms and names and no disorder, one follows and entrusts without losing talents and abilities. Internally examining the heart and externally scrutinizing traces, right and wrong attain their truth; rewards and punishments accord with principle. The foolish and the wise are placed appropriately and dare not transgress; the noble and the base tread their positions and dare not interchange. The benevolent and worthy, the unworthy, follow their natures and dare not feign.

"Necessarily distinguishing their capacities" means offices match their duties; "necessarily following their names" means names match reality. In all matters—governing inferiors, ordering things, cultivating the self—nothing does not proceed from this. When schemes are not employed, one must return to Heaven. This is how King Wen, though "not knowing, not perceiving," followed the decree of the Lord, and the many officers of Zhou all upheld the virtue of King Wen, responding to and serving Heaven—thus achieving Great Peace and equaling the heights of Tang and Yu.

To rush to speak of forms and names, rewards and punishments is to not know their root and beginning. Is not Heaven, with the Dao and virtue, their root and beginning? To invert is to not rectify, taking the branch as the root; to go against is to not follow, placing the later before the earlier. To speak of the Dao without the sequence of root and branch, before and after, is to create disorder. Self-created disorder is what men govern—how can one govern others?]

New Transmission:
[That upon which the myriad things depend for their existence is called Heaven.]

The movement from this to that is the Dao. What the Dao embodies in me is virtue. Virtue expressed as love is benevolence. Love that is fitting is righteousness. Benevolence has its before and after; righteousness has its above and below—this is called *fen* (distinction). The earlier does not usurp the later; the lower does not encroach upon the higher—this is called *shou* (observance). *Xing* (form) is the manifestation of this; *ming* (name) is the designation of this.

What is meant by the manifestation of this? It is the differentiation of noble and base, close and distant, by which things are adorned—this is the distinction in their forms. What is meant by the designation of this? It is the differentiation of noble and base, close and distant, by which things are named—this is the distinction in their designations. In their manifestations, noble and base each have their proper appearance; in their designations, close and distant each have their proper title.

Following the distinctions of close and distant, noble and base, and assigning tasks according to what is fitting—this is called *yinren* (following and employing). When tasks are assigned according to what is fitting, then one may let go without scrutiny—can this be done? One must trace to its essence and examine its affairs—this is called *yuanxing* (tracing and examining). Only when tracing and examining are clear can right and wrong be distinguished. Only when right and wrong are clear can rewards and punishments be applied.

The worthy and the foolish alike employ their fundamental nature, never abandoning themselves to imitate others or boast of their abilities—such is the folly of things.

In ancient times, Shun asked Yao, “How does the Heavenly King employ his mind?”
Yao said, “I do not act arrogantly toward those without recourse, nor do I neglect the destitute. I commend the young and pity women—this is how I employ my mind.”
Shun said, “It is fine, yet not great.”
Yao said, “Then how should it be?”
Shun said, “Manifesting the Heavenly virtue, one emerges in tranquility. The sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed, as day and night follow their constant course. Clouds drift and rain descends.”
Yao said, “Then must one be entangled and troubled? You align with Heaven, while I align with man. Now, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed great, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised together. Thus, those of old who ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply accorded with Heaven and Earth.”

Guo’s Commentary:
*Those without recourse* refers to the destitute; *not neglecting* means constantly bestowing kindness. Aligning with Heaven’s virtue, though active, remains tranquil—thus it is said, “emerges in tranquility.” The sun, moon, clouds, rain, four seasons, and day and night all act without contrivance, naturally. *Entangled and troubled* reveals one’s self-suspicion of busyness.

Lü’s Commentary:
Manifesting the Heavenly virtue, though active, is never without tranquility. The sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed—advancing and receding, bending and extending—none is the work of contrivance. Day and night follow their constant course, succeeding one another without awareness of their arising. Clouds drift and rain descends, and all under Heaven is made even. Compared to this, how could Yao’s refusal to act arrogantly toward those without recourse or neglect the destitute not seem entangled? Shun’s words align with Heaven; Yao’s align with man. Yet the Confucians of the world know Yao only thus. Therefore, I set forth these two sages to clarify that what is great and universally praised lies in this—no different from the Yellow Emperor.

Confucius sought to deposit his writings in the Zhou archives. Zilu counseled, “I have heard that among the Zhou’s archivists is one named Lao Dan, who has resigned and returned home. If you wish to deposit your writings, Master, you might first visit him.”
Confucius said, “Very well.” He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him.
Lao Dan, struck by his words, said, “How vast! I would hear the essentials.”
Confucius said, “The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness.”
Lao Dan said, “May I ask: are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?”
Confucius said, “Indeed. The noble person who lacks benevolence cannot be perfected; without righteousness, they cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity—what else could they be?”
Lao Dan said, “May I ask what benevolence and righteousness are?”
Confucius said, “Joyful harmony at the center, universal love, and selflessness—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness.”
Lao Dan said, “Alas! Nearly so. But is not *universal love* rather impractical? And *selflessness*—is that not itself a form of partiality?”

Should you wish the world never to lose its shepherds, then know: Heaven and Earth have their constancy, sun and moon their brightness, stars and constellations their ordered ranks, birds and beasts their flocks, trees and plants their rootedness. If you but follow virtue in your conduct and tread the Way in your steps, you will have arrived—why then this restless striving? To brandish benevolence and righteousness is like beating a drum in search of a lost child. I fear, sir, you would disorder human nature.

[The *Zhengzang Simafu* notes: *Zang* means "to conceal." The *Twelve Classics* refer to the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn*—the Six Classics—with the addition of the Six *Weft* texts, making twelve. Another account holds that the *Changes*’ upper and lower canons, together with the Ten Wings, form twelve. Yet another says the *Spring and Autumn* spans twelve reigns. *Mu* means "to shepherd."]

Guo’s commentary: [This is what the common world calls benevolence and righteousness, hence the use of Confucius and Laozi to correct it. The perfectly humane act without love yet advances directly. What the world calls "selflessness" is but the abandonment of self to love others. Yet to love others is to desire their love in return—this is extreme partiality, not the forgetting of the private for the public. From "Heaven and Earth have their constancy" to "trees and plants their rootedness"—all are self-sufficient and require no "universal love." When affairs arise, love as duty demands, then stop: this is to forget benevolence and righteousness. To dwell on them constantly is to disorder the true.]

Lü’s commentary: [Confucius, unheeded in his time, wished to conceal his words to await later noble persons. The *Twelve Classics* refer to the *Spring and Autumn*, through which Confucius ordered the world. Concealing its marvelous use without ever speaking of it, the *Twelve Classics*’ ordering of the world amounted to nothing more than benevolence and righteousness. Laozi, cutting off learning and returning to simplicity, revealed the true—thus benevolence and righteousness were to be cast aside, and it was fitting he deemed them not of human nature.

From the perspective of the human Dao: benevolence not only perfects the self but also completes things; righteousness not only establishes things but also establishes the self. The noble person’s flourishing lies in benevolence and righteousness, hence they are deemed the true nature of humanity.

From the perspective of the true Dao: "joyful harmony at the center" is not imposed from without. Nothing exists that is not joyful—this is the highest benevolence, acting without contrivance. "Universal love" is not the virtue of Heaven, nor does it resemble the spontaneous "walking and raining, acting and bestowing." Thus it is deemed impractical. All names arise from insufficiency—so "selflessness" is itself a form of partiality.

To wish the world never to lose its shepherds is to assist the spontaneity of the myriad things. From "Heaven and Earth have their constancy" to "trees and plants their rootedness"—this is what is meant by the spontaneity of things. Virtue is non-action; the Dao models itself on spontaneity—why then this restless striving? To beat a drum in search of a lost child is to say that the loss of human nature cannot be restored by benevolence and righteousness.]

The Dao of Lao Dan takes virtue and the Dao as its foundation, while the classics of Confucius take benevolence and righteousness as their root. Following virtue and aligning with the Dao, the world attains its nature through non-action; dwelling in benevolence and practicing righteousness, the world engages in action yet betrays its true feelings—this is why Zhuangzi employed the traces of Confucius to elucidate the matter. Inner harmony delights in all things: universal love is benevolence, selflessness is righteousness. Yet universal love inevitably fails to love some, which is not the highest benevolence. True benevolence knows no partiality; true righteousness does not objectify things. Thus the noble person values forgetting benevolence and righteousness to seek their ultimate expression. Confucius once said to Lao Dan, "I have studied the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn*—I have long immersed myself in them." This refers to the twelve classics, doubling the Six Classics into twelve.

Fang Sishan observed: One who grasps the essence of the teaching speaks only halfway before Laozi abruptly silences them. Nearly all later words, though seemingly close, fall short. Universal love arises from a mind intent on loving, yet it strays far from the Dao—hence it is called impractical. Beating a drum to seek a lost child only hastens their flight; likewise, governing the world by flaunting benevolence and righteousness only hastens chaos.

Shi Chengqi visited Laozi and asked, "I have heard that you are a sage. I did not hesitate to travel a great distance to see you, enduring a hundred nights of lodging and calloused feet without rest. Yet now I see you are no sage. You leave surplus grain to rot in rat burrows while abandoning your younger sister—this is not benevolence. You do not finish the food before you yet hoard without limit." Laozi remained unmoved. The next day, Shi Chengqi returned and said, "Yesterday I reproached you, but now my heart is at ease. Why is that?" Laozi replied, "Those of cunning wisdom and divine sagacity—I believed myself free of them. In the past, you called me an ox, and I accepted 'ox'; you called me a horse, and I accepted 'horse.' If one truly embodies a thing, others may name it, but to refuse is to invite calamity. I submit, always submit—not because submission exists, but because I have no submission."

Shi Chengqi stepped aside to avoid his shadow, then advanced and asked how to cultivate oneself. Laozi said, "Your countenance is haughty, your gaze piercing, your brow protruding, your mouth gaping, your bearing rigid—like a tethered horse. Your movements are restrained, your hair bristles, your scrutiny is mechanical, your cleverness betrays arrogance. All take you for untrustworthy. At the borderlands, there is one called 'the thief.'" (A hundred lodgings: Sima Biao explains this as stopping for a hundred days. *Jian*: calluses. The remainder of the text reads *xu*, meaning grain.)

Guo's commentary:
The phrase "defensive walls have surplus" speaks of his disregard for things, discarding them like worn sandals—this is unkindness, for he lacks even proximate compassion. Whether raw or cooked, nothing is exhausted before him; thus, he is ever in abundance. His accumulation is boundless, and the myriad things gather to his embrace. What comes, he receives, without setting narrow boundaries.

Shi Chengqi again appeared, his heart marred by self-reproach and biting criticism—this is what corrupts. To cast off the past: when called "ox" or "horse," he follows the name given to the thing, for it has substance, and thus neither slander nor praise disturbs his heart. If he were to accept these in his heart, both name and reality would burden him, and so he would again invite calamity. "Submission" refers to one’s bearing and conduct; not allowing slander or praise to harm oneself, one’s demeanor remains unchanged. If one acts with deliberate purpose, one cannot maintain constant submission.

"Crag-like" describes an uneasy, forward-leaning advance; "thrusting" means protruding. "Protruding" depicts the lofty display of beauty; "gaping" shows the open, roaring exchange. "Rigid" describes the strained, self-restraining posture—like a tethered horse, its will set on galloping. "Moving yet restrained" means not allowing oneself to relax. "Bristling" refers to the hair. "Mechanical" means swift in approach and retreat. "Scrutinizing" means discerning right and wrong with clarity.

The term "grandeur" refers to excess beyond one’s fundamental nature; skill in displaying grandeur leads to clumsiness in embracing simplicity. All these ten matters, by disregarding one’s inherent nature and destiny, become swayed by praise and blame—none are the Dao of cultivating the self.

At the borderlands, there are people who also recognize that your conduct is not that of a true person.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
When the mouse’s burrow holds surplus, it can be used to relieve the hunger of a younger sister, yet to abandon one’s younger sister is unbenevolent. If the raw and cooked are not fully consumed before one’s eyes, and one still takes without restraint while amassing without limit, this is unrighteous. Laozi abandoned learning and returned to simplicity, revealing the genuine to others. Yet when Shi Chengqi sought him through benevolence and righteousness, he responded with indifference—this was to dissolve his intentions and withdraw his heart.

If one deems oneself clever, divine, or sagely, believing one has transcended, then to abandon learning and return to simplicity is to have never possessed anything at all. Yet if you label certain acts as unbenevolent and others as unrighteous, this is like calling me an ox and naming me an ox, calling me a horse and naming me a horse. If the reality exists, others will assign the name, and I do not accept it—this is why I remain indifferent. To open one’s senses and engage in affairs while accepting such labels is to invite lifelong ruin, bringing calamity upon oneself.

My "submission" is constant; in this constancy, my heart never strays from the Dao. I do not submit because submission exists, nor do others truly regard me as diligent in practice. Shi Chengqi’s knowledge is insufficient to grasp the heart of the perfected person because what lies within him is inadequate.

If one’s bearing is "crag-like," it seems one does not engage with things; if one’s gaze is "thrusting," it pursues things outwardly. If one’s forehead is "protruding," it resembles raw simplicity; if one’s mouth is "gaping," it is as though words strain to escape. If one’s posture is "rigid," it appears unclear, yet the heart is like a tethered horse restrained. To be "moving yet restrained" is not an inability to act or to bristle; it is that the "mechanical" cannot be controlled. To "scrutinize with clarity" is not to borrow wisdom or skill; to perceive "grandeur" is not to preserve simplicity and restraint.

All these actions are merely deemed untrustworthy. Those at the borderlands do not wander within the Dao; to steal what is not theirs is to take what does not belong to them.

---
**Bishu’s Notes:**
The old interpretation of "abandoning one’s younger sister" as "unlearned" is overly forced. The intended meaning is that the *Mei* clan abandoned their surplus in the embankment. Laozi advocated frugality and thrift, thus reproaching wasteful abandonment. That the raw and cooked are not fully consumed before one’s eyes while amassing without limit is the proof of frugality.

If cleverness, knowledge, divinity, and sageliness still reside in the chest, there will inevitably be discord. Now, if one dissolves and transcends these, then to call it benevolence...

To call it "unbenevolent" is also permissible—even to call it "horse and ox" would not be amiss. Why? Because to know benevolence or its absence is still not to grasp its reality. If one perceives this reality yet refuses to accept it, one has already incurred the misfortune of unbenevolence; to accept it now would only compound the transgression.

*Serving* means compliance. My compliance with others is simply my habitual way—it is not an intentional act of submission. Thus, it is said: "I serve." Constant service is not service for the sake of service.

*Wild geese in formation* describes how they avoid their shadows, sidling as they advance. *Treading forward* depicts steady progress, heel to toe. *Cliff-like* signifies divergence, a gaze that clashes and darts. *Broad at the center, tapering at both ends* depicts a forehead’s shape. *Gaping mouth* conveys an open, stern, and resolute demeanor. Those who flaunt their refined tastes and set themselves apart present such a bearing.

*To move yet restrain, to be poised to strike yet forcibly hold back*—this describes a horse tethered yet ever straining to bolt, as if on the verge of breaking free yet forcibly restrained.

*Mechanism* refers to scrutinizing the trigger; *to examine* means to observe its workings in detail. *Cleverness and skill* lead to arrogance, which is plainly visible. The more cunning one becomes, the deeper the holes bored into the uncarved block, until the primordial simplicity is destroyed. Thus, it is called "untrustworthy," for it is not aligned with the natural disposition of life.

Like borderlands, each with its own boundaries, those who favor deceit constantly watch for gaps to exploit for personal gain. Thus, rival states regard them as thieves. The untrustworthy, who adorn themselves thickly to aggrandize themselves and obscure others, are no different from thieves—like the "tunneling and climbing" bandits Mencius spoke of.

The Master said: The Dao in its vastness does not terminate in the great, nor in its subtlety does it neglect the small. Thus, the ten thousand things are complete. Boundless, it admits all; unfathomable, it cannot be plumbed. Manifest virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the vestiges of spirit—who but the perfected person can stabilize them?

The perfected person engages with the world, yet how vast it is! Yet it is not enough to burden them. The world brandishes its power, yet they do not join in its pursuits. They discern the unreal and do not follow profit’s shifts. They grasp the essence of things and hold fast to their root. Thus, though they encompass heaven and earth and embrace the ten thousand things, their spirit is never constrained.

In harmony with the Dao, in accord with virtue, they relegate benevolence and righteousness, treat ritual and music as guests—the perfected person’s heart is thus settled.

Guo’s commentary: The perfected person employs the world yet does not fear its vastness. "Not joining in its pursuits" means to remain still and follow along. "Not following profit’s shifts" means to act with authenticity and proceed directly. "Relegating benevolence and righteousness" means advancing the Dao and virtue. "Treating ritual and music as guests" means taking essence and nature as primary. The perfected person’s heart is settled—settled in non-action.

Lü’s commentary: "In its vastness does not terminate" means heaven and earth are not separate from its embrace. "In its subtlety does not neglect" means even the autumn hair awaits its completion. Of the things under heaven, is there any not encompassed? Boundless, it admits all; unfathomable, it cannot be plumbed—this is how the Dao becomes spirit. Flowing forth, it takes form; losing its form, it becomes virtue; decaying, it becomes benevolence and righteousness—these are but the vestiges of spirit. Who but the perfected person can stabilize them?

"Engaging with the world is not enough to burden them"—they can abandon the world. "The world brandishes its power, yet they do not join in its pursuits"—they forget the world. Forgetting the world, they do not follow profit’s shifts. Able to abandon the world, they hold fast to their root. The spirit is constrained only by not knowing this.

Not obstructing the Dao, not adulterating virtue, relegating benevolence and righteousness without clinging, treating ritual and music as guests without making them primary—only then is the heart settled.

Detailed Explanation of the Dao: The great must have an end; the small is often overlooked. The Dao does not terminate in the great nor neglect the small. Great and small do not depart from the embodied, yet the formless does not concern itself with great or small. To discuss the Dao in terms of great and small is but to grasp at the fish-trap and rabbit-snare.

What the spirit responds to lies outside—when the external is forgotten, the spirit is whole. What the heart preserves lies within—when the internal is forgotten, the heart is still. Heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things are external; thus, to forget and abandon them is to ensure the spirit is never constrained. Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are internal; thus, to relegate and treat them as guests is to settle the heart.

What the world values in the Dao is the written word. Yet writing is but speech, and speech has its value. What is valued in speech is meaning. What meaning follows cannot be transmitted through words. Yet the world, valuing words, transmits books. Though the world values them, they are still not truly valuable.

*For* (read in the falling tone) what is valued is not the true value. Thus, what can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas! The world takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the essence of things. Yet if forms, colors, names, and sounds are truly insufficient to grasp that essence, then the knowing do not speak, and the speaking do not know—how could the world recognize this?

Duke Huan was reading in the hall when Wheelwright Pian was hewing a wheel below. Setting down his mallet and chisel, he ascended and asked Duke Huan: "May I dare ask what words my lord is reading?"

"The words of the sages," replied the Duke.

"Are the sages still alive?"

"They are already dead."

"Then what my lord reads are but the dregs of the ancients."

Duke Huan said: "This ruler reads—how can a wheelwright presume to comment? If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you die."

Wheelwright Pian said: "Your servant observes from his own craft: when hewing a wheel, if too slow, it is smooth but not secure; if too fast, it is rough and does not fit. Not too slow, not too fast—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart. The mouth cannot express it, yet a certain skill resides within. I cannot make my son understand it, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, at seventy years old, I am still hewing wheels. If the ancients and their untransmittable truths are dead, then what my lord reads are but the dregs of the ancients."

*(Duke Huan was Duke Huan of Qi. Wheelwright Pian was a craftsman named Pian. "Dregs" refers to the lees of fermented grain; another version reads "husks." "Smooth" means loose; "rough" means tight.)*

Guo's Annotation:
What is truly noble lies not in what is called noble, for its nobility ever resides beyond words and meaning. Only those who forget words and discard texts may grasp that reality. This is the intent of "cutting off learning" and "abandoning esteem." Wheelwright Pian could not make his son understand—each thing has its nature, and teaching is of no avail. The affairs of antiquity have perished in antiquity; even if transmitted, how could they make the ancient present in the now? The ancient is not in the present, and present affairs have already changed. Thus, to cut off learning, follow one’s nature, and move with the transformations of time—only then may one arrive.

Lü's Annotation:
Zhuangzi speaks here to urge scholars to forget words and texts, seeking not among forms, colors, names, or reputations. Hewing wheels is a coarse matter, yet the slow and fast, the smooth and rough, grasped by the hand and responding to the heart—even father and son cannot make one another understand or receive it. How much more difficult, then, is the transmission of the Dao as a thing! If one cannot seek it in the heart but only reads books, then the analogy of dregs is no empty word.

Detailed Explanation of the Dao:
Words in texts relate to meaning as forms, colors, sounds, and names relate to reality. Reality cannot be obtained from forms, colors, names, or sounds; meaning cannot be transmitted through words in texts—this is certain. Thus, the adept in the *Yi* obtains the meaning and forgets the images, obtains the images and forgets the words. The adept in poetry obtains the intent and forgets the phrases, obtains the phrases and forgets the lines. Is this not what is meant by "when the sacrifice is over, the straw dogs are discarded," "the pure essence flows away, and the dregs are cast aside"? It is why Duke Huan, through Wheelwright Pian, awakened to the futility of reading books, and why Wang Shou, through Xu Feng, rose to dance and burn his texts.

A Humble Overview and General Discussion:
This chapter takes "Heavenly Dao" as its title, prominently marking its beginning. It then sets forth the Dao of the Emperor, the Dao of the Sage, the Dao of the Dark Sage, and the unadorned kingly enterprise, all centered on the Dao and virtue, the constant of non-action—this is the Dao that rides Heaven and Earth, drives the myriad things, and serves the governance of human society. In its middle sections, it enumerates virtue, teaching, ritual, music, benevolence, righteousness, the division of duties, names, rewards, and punishments—all the instruments of ordering the world—yet none depart from the constant of the human Dao. Why? For one who excels in discoursing on the Heavenly Dao must be grounded in the human capacity to fulfill the human Dao, and thus may match Heaven. Heaven and humanity communicate; root and branch are one, vast without limit, deep beyond fathoming. How can one know that Heaven is not human, or that humanity is not Heaven?

When it discusses the five transformations and the establishment of names, the nine transformations and the application of rewards and punishments, these are the unchanging principles of all ages, the means by which human standards are set and the Heavenly Dao is praised. As for the Heavenly virtue emerging in tranquility, the sun and moon shining, the four seasons proceeding, day and night following their course, clouds moving and rain falling—these are Heaven’s self-expression, its solitary luminosity and spontaneous transformation. How could the Dao of Earth or the Dao of humanity fail to follow?

The cultivation of governance instruments to order the Dao is a common discourse of past and present. Yet some use them to bring order, while others use them to bring chaos—this is because they do not know the sequence of root and branch, before and after, or the proper balance of detail and essentials in ruler and minister. The world says that the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi] often esteems non-action and neglects governance instruments, but observing what this chapter sets forth—ritual, music, and political teachings—its subtlety and precision surpass what other masters can attain. All emerge naturally from Heaven’s principle, merely enacted through human agency.

If one truly understands the principle of spontaneity, one may proceed from governance instruments to comprehend the Dao of governance, so that ruler and minister, father and son, birds and beasts, grasses and trees all attain their proper place. The world will beat time on the earth and sing, unaware of imperial power—this may be called non-action. Yet when Confucius wished to hide his books and unrolled the classics to expound them to Cheng Qi, or when he was asked about cultivating the self and his countenance became stern—these were cases of following humanity and forgetting Heaven, which is why Lao Dan did not approve.

Only the perfected person knows that benevolence and righteousness are the branches of the Dao, and ritual and music are its guests. They can be Heavenly and human, exhaust the real and guard the root, and their spirit is never troubled. Thus, though there be an age, it is not enough to burden them. In the end, it takes the analogy of "obtaining meaning from discarded texts" and "dregs and lees" through Wheelwright Pian, for it fears that scholars may follow traces and forget the heart, abandon the root and pursue the branches, thereby drifting ever farther from the Dao. One should thoroughly investigate what the sage does not forget, so that scholars may themselves cut off learning and enter the profound, and those who would transmit may attain the transmission without transmission—then the heart of Heaven and Earth and the sages will be seen. Why cling to the dregs and lees of the ancients?

**Chapter Fourteen: The Turning of Heaven**

Does Heaven turn? Does Earth abide? Do the sun and moon contend for their places? Who governs and sustains this? Who weaves and upholds this? Who, without toil, propels and moves it? Is there some mechanism that compels it, leaving it no choice? Or does it revolve of itself, unable to cease? Does cloud become rain? Does rain become cloud? Who bestows and dispenses this? Who, without toil, indulges in excess and urges it on? The wind rises from the north, now west, now east, drifting aloft—who exhales and inhales this? Who, without toil, stirs and scatters it? May I ask the reason?

Wu Xian Chao replied: Come, I shall tell you. Heaven possesses the Six Limits and the Five Constants. When emperors and kings align with them, there is order; when they oppose them, there is chaos. The affairs of the Nine Luo bring governance to completion and virtue to fulfillment, illuminating the lands below. All under Heaven uphold them—this is called the Supreme August.

*(Alternative readings: "aloft" for "in the heights"; "wandering" for "drifting"; "whirlwind" for "gale." Wu Xian was a minister of Yin named Chao. The Six Limits refer to the four directions, above, and below. The Five Constants are the Five Phases. The Nine Luo are the nine regions of the realm.)*

Guo’s commentary:
Heaven does not turn yet moves of itself; Earth does not abide yet rests of itself; the sun and moon do not contend for their places yet alternate and pass away of themselves. Who governs and sustains this? All is self-so. Without it, nothing could be propelled; with it, each acts of its own accord. Then who, without toil, propels and moves it? None—each moves of itself.

Thus, being self-so, it cannot be known. Clouds and rain—these two cannot act upon each other, yet each is self-so. May I ask why? The question is posed precisely to illustrate the reason for their self-so nature. In proximate matters, one may discern their causes, yet tracing their origins to the utmost reveals no cause but their self-so nature. Being self-so, one can only accord with it: to accord is order, to oppose is chaos. This is because acquired learning may be altered, but Heaven-endowed nature cannot be reversed. Order is achieved, virtue is perfected, and the lands below are illuminated—all under Heaven uphold them because they accord with what is self-so.

Lü’s commentary:
Heaven’s movement, Earth’s stillness—I know not their true movement or true stillness. The sun and moon’s contest for position—I know not their true contest. Seeking their governor, their propelling force, yields nothing. Water ascends to become clouds, clouds dissolve to become rain—seeking their bestower of bounty or their indulgent joy yields nothing. Winds rise from the west, drift eastward, wandering without constancy—seeking their exhalation, inhalation, or sweeping force yields nothing. This is the unfathomable workings of the Dao, manifesting as the numinous. To know the numinous is to understand that all governance, bounty, and sweeping force arise from this alone. The Five Constants correspond to the Five Fortunes; when applied, the Five Fortunes bring authority, while the Six Limits bring calamity. To accord with them is auspicious; to oppose them is inauspicious. The Nine Luo are the *Luoshu*’s nine categories, whose application extends to fortune and calamity. When order is achieved, virtue is perfected, the lands below are illuminated, and all under Heaven uphold them—this is the Supreme August. The Supreme August harnesses Heaven and Earth, drives the sun and moon, dispenses clouds and rain, exhales and inhales the winds and qi, yet abides in the realm of non-action. Must one seek this in the primordial age?

---

Xiang Dao’s explication:
Heaven and Earth’s movement and stillness, the sun and moon’s coming and going—clouds emerge from Earth yet originate in Heaven, rain descends from Heaven yet originates in Earth, winds blow eastward yet arise from the north. Their covering and bearing, their illumination and oversight, their defense and nourishment—none are willed; all are borne of the Dao’s self-so nature. The wild horses drift yet do not move, the whirlwind topples mountains yet remains still, rivers rush yet do not flow, the sun and moon traverse the heavens yet do not revolve. Thus, Heaven and Earth’s movement and stillness arise from their non-movement and non-stillness; the sun and moon’s coming and going arise from their non-coming and non-going. Who can truly fathom their governor? Who knows what is meant by a true master?

---

Xun Ben’s note:
The sun and moon share the ecliptic, hence the phrase “contest for position.” The mechanism is as if bound by a cord—without it, they cannot halt. Winds arise from the north, proceed westward and eastward, then ascend and wander. They arise from the north and thus naturally move south, so the south need not be mentioned; they ascend from below, so the below need not be mentioned.

The Grand Steward Dang of Shang asked Zhuangzi about benevolence. Zhuangzi said, “Tigers and wolves are benevolent.”
Dang asked, “What do you mean?”
Zhuangzi replied, “Father and son are affectionate—why are they not benevolent?”
Dang said, “May I ask about perfect benevolence?”
Zhuangzi said, “Perfect benevolence has no partiality.”
Dang said, “I have heard that without partiality, there is no love; without love, there is no filial piety. Can perfect benevolence be unfilial?”
Zhuangzi said, “Not so. Perfect benevolence is loftier still. Filial piety is insufficient to describe it—this is not a matter of surpassing filial piety, but of falling short of it. One who travels south to Ying turns northward and does not see Mount Fang—why? Because it lies too far away. Thus, it is easier to practice filial piety with reverence than with love; easier to practice it with love than to forget one’s parents; easier to forget one’s parents than to make one’s parents forget oneself; easier to make one’s parents forget oneself than to forget all under Heaven; easier to forget all under Heaven than to make all under Heaven forget oneself. Virtue left Yao and Shun behind without effort; their beneficence extended to ten thousand generations, yet none in the world knew it. How could one merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety?”

Ah! Filial piety, fraternal duty, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, chastity, and integrity—these are all virtues by which one exhorts oneself to toil in service of one’s power, yet they are not worthy of praise. Thus it is said: the most noble discard state rank as one; the most wealthy discard state wealth as one; the most aspiring discard fame and reputation as one. Therefore, the Dao does not waver.

Guo’s commentary:
“Having no kin” does not mean to slight or despise them. The human body is one whole, yet it has no kin: the head naturally resides above, the feet naturally reside below, the organs dwell within, the skin and hair lie without. Within the body, outer and inner, above and below, noble and base, honored and humble each fulfill their utmost, yet there is no partial love among them. Thus, perfect benevolence suffices. Therefore, the five relations and six clans, the worthy and the foolish, the near and the far—none lose their place in the world, for this is the natural principle. What need is there for “having kin”? Filial piety is not worth speaking of; only when one speaks of it in the realm of forgetting benevolence and forgetting filial piety does one reach the ultimate. All names arise from insufficiency, so only by transcending the names of benevolence and filial piety and entering the realm of namelessness does one attain the ultimate. Mount Fang lies in the north, yet one traveling south to observe it finds it ever more distant. Perfect benevolence lies in having no kin, yet when one speaks of it in terms of benevolence and love, Ying may be seen, but it grows ever more distant. Though benevolence and filial piety may be manifest, they are ever farther from the ultimate principle. The perfectly benevolent one finds all parts of the body fitting, and thus goes through the day without self-awareness. When the sage is above, he does not act with purpose; he lets all things follow their own course and find their own fulfillment. When each finds its own fulfillment, all affairs naturally fit, all beings naturally suffice, and how could the world fail to forget itself? When all forget themselves, where does the ruler reside? This is what is called “mutual forgetting.” Only when virtue leaves Yao and Shun behind are the virtues of Yao and Shun complete. If one binds it in the heart, it is not self-attainment. The world knows it not, and all is serene and constantly fitting. Those who sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety have lost themselves in rivers and lakes and think only of wetting their lips. “Discarding” means to cast away. The noble lies in the person; if one forgets even the person, how much more state rank? This is the ultimate nobility. The most wealthy is self-sufficient alone; thus, one discards the wealth of all under Heaven. The most aspiring is contentment; attaining contentment, the names of benevolence and filial piety all depart. Therefore, the Dao does not waver, casting off the flower and taking the fruit.

Lü’s commentary:
The common world takes love as benevolence, yet how can the mutual affection of tiger and wolf father and child not be called benevolence? As for perfect benevolence, it is the benevolence of Heaven and Earth and the sage. It merges with the Dao in substance and acts without purpose—how could it harbor intention within? This is why perfect benevolence has no kin. To say “having no kin, then no love; no love, then no filial piety” is speech that falls short of filial piety. Perfect benevolence has no kin, and thus it surpasses speech of filial piety. One traveling south does not see Mount Fang because it lies too far away. Perfect benevolence renders speech of filial piety insufficient, for it too lies too far away. Reverence is ritual; love is emotion; forgetting kin is the Dao. Forgetting kin is forgetting what lies within oneself; making one’s kin forget oneself is forgetting what lies in others. Mutually forgetting all under Heaven means I can put the world outside myself, yet when all under Heaven mutually forget me, the world goes forth and we forget one another. Practicing benevolence to this point, virtue leaves Yao and Shun behind without effort; beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet none in the world knows it. This is called merging with the Dao in substance and acting without purpose. How could one merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety?

From the perspective of perfect benevolence, filial piety, fraternal duty, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, chastity, and integrity are all virtues by which one exhorts oneself to toil in service of one’s power—how could they be worthy of praise? Thus, the most noble discard state rank as one; the most wealthy discard state wealth as one. This is to grasp the nobility and wealth of all under Heaven and control its ranks and riches. The most aspiring discard fame and reputation as one. Cultivating what one may aspire to and reaching perfect benevolence, even if one discards filial piety and fraternal duty, their fame and reputation are already included within. The Dao does not waver, for the Dao is present wherever one goes.

Northern Gate Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor, saying: "When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of Dongting, at first I heard it and was afraid; I heard it again and grew weary; at last I heard it and was bewildered—adrift, silent, and no longer myself."

The Emperor said: "You were nearly so! I performed it with human affairs, verified it with the movements of Heaven, conducted it with ritual propriety, and established it with the Great Purity. The supreme music first responds to human affairs, accords with the principles of Heaven, proceeds through the Five Virtues, and answers to spontaneity. Only then does it harmonize the four seasons and bring all things into perfect harmony. The four seasons arise in succession, and the myriad things follow their generation—now flourishing, now declining; the patterns of civil and martial order alternate; now clarity, now turbidity; yin and yang blend in harmony, their radiance flowing as sound. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. In the end, it has no tail; in the beginning, no head—now dying, now living; now collapsing, now rising. What is constant is inexhaustible, yet one cannot await it—thus you were afraid.

Then I performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminated it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sound could be short or long, soft or firm, its transformations uniform yet not fixed—thus it ever abides. It filled the valleys, filled the hollows, filled every crevice, guarding the spirit with things as its measure. Its sound soared and spread, its name lofty and luminous. Thus, spirits guarded its depths, while the sun, moon, and stars followed their courses. I halted it at the bounded, yet let it flow into the boundless. You wished to ponder it but could not comprehend it; to gaze upon it but could not see it; to pursue it but could not overtake it."

Perchance standing in the boundless Way of the four voids, leaning upon a withered catalpa to chant—
your eyes reach their limit in what they long to see,
your strength falters in what they long to pursue.
I, having already fallen short, ceased.
When form fills emptiness, it becomes utterly supple.
You, supple, thus grew lax.

Then I played for you a sound without laxity,
tuned it to the mandate of spontaneity.
Thus it seemed to merge with the chase, to flourish in thickets and groves,
joyous yet without form,
spreading and unfurling without trailing,
dim and obscure yet soundless,
moving without direction,
dwelling in profound seclusion.
Some call it death, some life;
some call it substance, some glory.
Flowing, scattering, shifting—no constant master.
The world doubts it, yet the sage examines it.
The sage is one who penetrates to reality and fulfills the mandate.
The celestial mechanism is not displayed, yet the five officials are all in place—
this is called celestial music.
Though wordless, the heart delights.
Thus the Lord of Yán composed a hymn for it, saying:
*Hear it yet hear no sound,
see it yet see no form.
Filling heaven and earth,
enveloping the six directions—
you long to listen yet find no point of contact,
and thus are bewildered.*

Music begins with fear—
fear, thus reverence.
Then I followed with laxity—
laxity, thus escape.
Finally, bewilderment—
bewilderment, thus folly.
Folly, thus the Way.
The Way can be borne and journeyed with together.

The *Fèn* Sima states: "I am but a servant." *Kēng*, according to the *Ěryǎ*, means "void." Guo’s commentary: "This is what is called ‘sitting in forgetfulness’—not finding oneself in self-possession. The ultimate music is not a matter of sounds and tones. It must first accord with Heaven, respond to man, be grasped by the heart, and suit the nature; only then is it expressed in sound and performed in melody. Thus, the music of *Xiánchí* could only be completed after the transformation of the Yellow Emperor. The natural pitch-pipes fill the space between Heaven and Earth, but if one merely follows without seizing, the ultimate music is preserved whole. Therefore, one acts in accordance with its spontaneous arising, employing its inherent movements—without beginning, without end, revolving without limit, taking transformation as its constant. Thus, what is constant is inexhaustible.

At first hearing, the inexhaustible transformations cannot be met with uniformity, so one is fearful and listens with reverence. It is performed with yin and yang, illuminated by the sun and moon—this is called ‘employing the Dao of Heaven.’ Equalizing all within transformation without fixity, it thus constantly fills valleys and voids; the ultimate music is all-pervading. The paths of the senses are guarded, the gates of perception sealed. Taking things as measure, the great system remains uncarved. Its sounds are expansive and harmonious—what is called ‘manifesting harmony.’ When the name is fitting, the reality is lofty and luminous. Thus, spirits do not depart from their places, and the sun and stars do not lose their courses, abiding within limits while dwelling at the utmost extreme. Flowing without cessation, they follow transformation wherever it goes.

Contemplation cannot fathom it; pursuit cannot overtake it. Thus, one is dimly resigned, allowing transformation to depart, standing carefree amid the fourfold emptiness—this is called ‘boundless openness.’ Chanting beneath the withered *wú* tree, there is nothing left to be done. The knowledge and power of things each have their limits; when form fills emptiness, there is no self. Without self, one can be supple and yielding. Supple and yielding, one follows one’s nature, and the emotion of reverence slackens. Once the intent slackens, one attains the state beyond slackness—this is the ultimate."

What is endowed by fate is not through action—all is natural. In undifferentiated oneness, unbound, it arises amidst the thicket. Supreme joy lies in nothing more than attunement; attunement resides within the body, thus requiring no separate form. Its unfolding is effortless, self-spreading without strain—this is what is called "supreme joy." Moving without fixed direction, dwelling in profound obscurity—this is what is called "tranquil extremity." Life and death, flourishing and decay, flow and shift without fixed abode; their resonance changes with things.

The world doubts this, yet the sages verify it. The enlightened sage responds to the world not by initiating, but by comprehending emotions and fulfilling fate. Those who speak of emotions and fate draw from this. Joy forgotten is joy fulfilled; it is not through display that one is prepared. The heart delights in attunement, not in words. The hymn of Youyan is the joy of no-joy—the ultimate joy. Startled and reverent in listening, one venerates the ear, yet this is not the great harmony. Next comes slackness, and thus one retreats, traces gradually fading. Delusion gives rise to foolishness; thus the Dao takes "no-knowledge" as foolishness, and foolishness becomes the ultimate.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Joy is the Dao itself. In the vast wilderness of Dongting, in boundless expanses, when music is played, though people praise it as heavenly principle, true joy emerges from emptiness. Conduct guided by ritual and righteousness arises from the Great Purity, while music established in the Grand Beginning. The four seasons and the myriad things—none are not joy. Prosperity and decline, civil and martial arts, the warp and weft of governance—these cannot be disordered. The harmony of clear and turbid, yin and yang—never discordant. Its resonance flows luminously between heaven and earth, yet without stimulus, it does not manifest.

Seeking its root and branch, it has no beginning, no end. Life and death surge forth, yet what is constant is inexhaustible and one—unawaitable. Thus, one fears this, for there is no "other." I demonstrate it through humanity, and they enter through humanity. Yet entering through humanity, the myriad transformations differ—what is called "one" cannot be awaited. How fitting is this fear!

Moreover, when played with yin and yang, illuminated by sun and moon, it is simply heaven. Its duration is not fixed; it fills valleys and brims ravines. Guarding the spirit in its place, taking things as measure—this is how resonance arises. Effortless and unconstrained by the cosmos, lofty and luminous—this is how it becomes heaven. The spirit guards the obscure; the sun and stars follow their courses, abiding within limits. Flowing without cessation, it follows transformation wherever it goes. Contemplation cannot fathom it; pursuit cannot overtake it. The eye exhausts its vision, strength falters, and one becomes supple and yielding—thus slackness arises. There is no "other." I demonstrate it through heaven, and they receive it through heaven. Again, I play it with no slackness, harmonizing with the natural. Undifferentiated, it follows the thicket’s growth—the myriad things flourish abundantly.

Forest joy has no form; each returns to its root. Its unfolding is effortless, moving without fixed direction. Dwelling in profound obscurity, it is soundless. Life and death, flourishing and decay, shift without constancy—thus it is not constrained by the one. This is what the world doubts, yet the sage embodies it in rising, dwelling, and all moments, never departing. What is called a sage is none other than one who comprehends emotions and fulfills fate. Hearing and seeing—nothing is not this. Thus, it is simply the heavenly mechanism. This is the heavenly joy: wordless yet delighting the heart.

Therefore, the hymn of Youyan and the marvel of *Xianchi*—such is their wonder. If you wish to hear it, you must do so without attachment, for my hearing is not employed—hence delusion. There is no other reason: it is the forgetting of the self, the forgetting of humanity.

Only heaven—this is where fear begins, hence the dread of spirits. Then comes negligence, hence escape. Finally, confusion, hence folly. The reason the self cannot bear the Dao is its brilliance of knowledge and perception. Only by shedding knowledge and embracing folly can one bear the Dao and journey with it in unity.

Following the root, vast and boundless, the spirit unsettled, silently the mouth unable to speak, the heart ill at ease, never self-content. The four seasons and the myriad things speak of the spontaneity of creation and transformation—prosperity and decline, civil and martial, clarity and turbidity, yin and yang—alluding to their rhythmic cadence. "Flowing light" describes the radiance of their sound, smooth and luminous.

This line harmonizes with the preceding rhyme, pure and unadulterated. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. In the end, no tail; in the beginning, no head—suddenly arising, suddenly ceasing, like thunder’s unfathomable might. One death, one life; one collapse, one rise—ever constant, unending, yet the "one" cannot be awaited. Read as a continuous sequence: one death follows one life, one collapse follows one rise, cycling endlessly without pause. How can one hesitate or wait?

Beimen Cheng, hearing this music, was filled with terror. I then played for him the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of sun and moon. Though harmonious, distinctions remained—this is what is called "luminous clarity." Its sound could be short or long, soft or firm, ever-changing yet uniform, thus always luminously clear. Whether in valleys or ravines, the sound fills all—where it flows, it saturates. "Stopping up the ears" means merely blocking them; "sealing the eyes" means merely closing them. My music does not rely on keen hearing or sharp sight but guards the spirit, following the measure of things as they are. The sound’s magnitude arises from the capacity of what receives it. The music’s resonance expands boundlessly; its name looms vast and manifest. The spirit guards its mystery; sun, moon, and stars follow their courses, each unconfused. I halt it at the finite, flow it into the infinite—sometimes halting, sometimes flowing, without constancy.

Though you may strive to comprehend it, you cannot know it; though you may gaze upon it, you cannot see it; though you may pursue it, you cannot reach it. Helplessly adrift, you stand at the crossroads of emptiness, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting—only to find your eyes exhausted, your strength spent. This is what is meant by "though you wish to follow, there is no way."

Once it becomes unattainable, you see only its form filling the void, and your heart drifts, slackening of its own accord. I then played for him the sound of "no negligence"—what is called "no negligence" is attuned to the natural mandate of heaven, flowing as spontaneously as fate. Thus, its sound blends indistinctly, surging forth in clusters, rejoicing together like a forest, yet without form—this is what is called "continuous resonance."

When it spreads and acts, it exhausts all without residue; when it trails into profound obscurity, it falls utterly silent. In motion, it has no fixed direction; in stillness, it dwells in unfathomable depths, beyond measure. Some call it death, some life; some call it substance, some flourishing—only its ceaseless flux is seen, its sound without constancy. Thus, one doubts and examines its principles, consulting the sage, for only the sage can fathom human emotions and fulfill heaven’s mandate. This music is not for any but the sage.

This "mandate" echoes the earlier "attuned to the natural mandate." The heavenly mechanism neither unfolds nor restrains—its subtle workings are ever-present. The five officials are all complete; the five tones they govern are fully equipped. "Heavenly joy" is the natural mandate itself—ineffable yet delighting the heart. I cite the hymn of Youyan to reveal the marvel beyond sound.

If you wish to hear its wonder, you must not cling, for my hearing is not employed—hence confusion. Fear sharpens the spirit, as if haunted by spirits—hence "dread." Negligence exhausts the heart’s strength, making one wish to flee—hence "escape." Confusion clouds knowledge—hence "folly." Only through folly can one enter the Dao, and only then can one bear it and journey alongside.

This discussion of music extends to the Dao. The passage, though seemingly abrupt like the music played in the wilds of Dongting—without head or tail, difficult to grasp at first—unfolds with coherence upon careful reflection. It originates from Confucius’ discourse on music to the Grand Master, yet Zhuangzi does not merely repeat old words. His discussion of music naturally achieves such subtlety.

Confucius traveled west to Wei. Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, “What of your master’s conduct?”
Shi Jin replied, “Alas! Your master is doomed to hardship.”
Yan Yuan said, “How so?”
Shi Jin said, “Before the straw dogs are presented…”

When the straw dogs are yet to be presented, they are stored in fine baskets, wrapped in embroidered cloths; the invocators and shamans fast and purify themselves to prepare them. Once presented and used, passersby trample their heads and spines, while gatherers of kindling take them for fuel—no more. Yet should one again store them in fine baskets, wrap them in embroidered cloths, and rest or sleep beneath them, they would surely suffer nightmares or frequent confusion.

Now, your master has taken the already-used straw dogs of the former kings, and with his disciples, rests and sleeps beneath them. Thus, he was felled like a tree in Song, erased his tracks in Wei, and found himself in dire straits between Shang and Zhou—was this not his nightmare? Besieged between Chen and Cai, seven days without cooked food, death and life as close as neighbors—was this not his confusion?

In water, nothing surpasses the use of a boat; on land, nothing surpasses the use of a cart. It is because a boat can traverse water that one would seek to push it on land—yet to do so would be futile for a lifetime, covering but a few paces. Are ancient and modern times not like water and land? Are Zhou and Lu not like boat and cart? To seek to implement Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious yet fruitless, and one’s person will surely meet with misfortune. He does not understand the transmission of the boundless, which responds to things without exhaustion.

Moreover, have you alone not seen the well-sweep? Pulled, it bows; released, it rises. What pulls it is not the pull of man, and so it bows and rises without offending anyone. Thus, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for their sameness but for their efficacy in governance. The rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—are they not like the crabapple, pear, orange, and pomelo? Their flavors differ, yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Thus, rites, righteousness, laws, and standards are things that change with the times.

Now, if one were to take an ape and dress it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it would surely gnaw, tear, and rend them, casting them off entirely before being satisfied. Observe the differences between ancient and modern times—are they not like the differences between an ape and the Duke of Zhou?

When Xishi suffered from a heart ailment, she knit her brows in her village, and the village’s ugly women, seeing this, thought it beautiful. Returning home, they too clutched their chests and knit their brows. The village’s rich men, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and refused to come out; the poor, seeing it, took their wives and children and fled. They knew the beauty of knitting brows but did not know why it was beautiful.

Alas! Your master is doomed to hardship.

The herb *su* is taken as grass, and *mi* (眯), according to Sima Biao, means "to press down." Some texts write it as *yan* (魇), referring to nightmares and strange visions. To knit the brows is called *pin* (矉).

Guo Xiang’s commentary states: "Discarded things, when useless in their time, only invite further calamities. The notion of dreams and *mi* alludes to the idea of abolishing sagacity and discarding knowledge—nothing is to be slighted. The rituals and laws of the former kings served to suit their times; when their time has passed and they are not abandoned, they become monstrosities for the people, giving rise to the beginnings of affectation and imitation. Thus, as times change and the world transforms, rituals must also adapt. Following things without attachment is how one achieves effortless success.

The rituals, virtues, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors aimed only to suit their times and respond to the needs of governance. What one age deemed beautiful, another might deem ugly. Only by adapting to the times can all things be fitting. Thus, rituals and virtues, when used in their proper time, are like Xishi; when clung to past their time, they become like the ugly women."

Expounding on the Dao:
"The songs of Qi, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in melody yet all bring joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Man differ in sound yet all evoke sorrow. Therefore, the sage’s governance of the world rides the times to establish what is fitting and follows the people to set laws. If it truly benefits the state, methods need not be uniform; if it truly suits the matter, rituals need not be the same. Thus, Fuxi and Shennong taught without punishment; the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun punished without anger. The Xia valued substance over ornament; the Zhou valued ornament over substance. Can the laws of antiquity be applied today? Can today’s laws be rigidly adhered to antiquity? Confucius drew from the past to guide the present—not to cling to it, but to trace the path back to its origin.

Master Jin feared that the world would drown in the ills of clinging to traces, so he first compared it to straw dogs and boats, then to the shadoof and citrus fruits, and finally to apes and ugliness—just as the ways of antiquity and Zhou cannot be made one with the present."

At fifty-one, Confucius had yet to hear the Dao. He traveled south to Pei to visit Lao Dan, who said: "Have you come? I have heard you are a worthy man of the north. Have you attained the Dao?"
Confucius replied: "I have not."
Lao Dan asked: "How have you sought it?"
Confucius said: "I sought it in regulations and measures for five years but did not attain it."
Lao Dan asked: "How else have you sought it?"
Confucius said: "I sought it in yin and yang for twelve years but still did not attain it."
Lao Dan said: "Indeed. If the Dao could be offered, none would fail to offer it to their lord; if it could be presented, none would fail to present it to their parents; if it could be told, none would fail to tell it to their brothers; if it could be given, none would fail to give it to their children and grandchildren. Yet it cannot—there is no other reason: without an inner host, it does not stay; without an outer standard, it does not proceed. What issues from within cannot be received from without; the sage does not issue it. What enters from without has no host within; the sage does not store it. The name is a public vessel—it cannot be taken in excess.

Benevolence and righteousness are the temporary lodgings of the former kings. One may stay a night but cannot dwell there long. To gaze upon them and demand much is to invite trouble. The utmost person of antiquity borrowed the Dao from benevolence and lodged in righteousness to wander in the emptiness of freedom, to eat from the fields of simplicity, and to stand in the garden of non-giving. Freedom is effortless action; simplicity is easy nurturance; non-giving means no loss. The ancients called this the wandering of gathering truth.

Those who take wealth as right cannot relinquish emolument; those who take fame as right cannot relinquish renown. Those who cling to power cannot share authority. Grasping it, they tremble; releasing it, they grieve—and in all this, they have nothing to reflect upon, no mirror to see what never rests. These are the people punished by Heaven. Resentment and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and teaching, life and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification. Only those who follow great changes without obstruction can wield them.

Thus, it is said: 'Rectification is rectitude.' If one’s heart does not accept this, the gate of Heaven will not open."

Guo Xiang’s commentary: "This all borrows from Confucius and Laozi to clarify the meaning of abolishing learning. 'Without an inner host, it does not stay' means that without the capacity to receive the Dao in the center, even if one hears it, it passes by. 'Without an outer standard, it does not proceed' means that without an inner host, external things also lack proper alignment, so there is no communication.

What issues from within is the sage’s Dao, but it only emerges when there is one outside capable of receiving it. What enters from without is learning that forms one’s nature, but even if it forms through borrowed learning, it must have an inner host—without one, there is no place to store the sagely Dao.

The name is what the world shares; excessive adornment and taking beyond what is real cause disorder. *Qulu* (temporary lodging) is like a travelers’ inn. Benevolence and righteousness are human nature, but human nature changes with the times. To wander and lodge without attachment is like passing through without hindrance; to be bound to one place is to be seen, and where there is seeing, falsity arises. Falsity arises, and demands multiply.

Borrowing the Dao and lodging in righteousness means adapting to the times without fixed traces. Freedom is effortless action; effortful action is not benevolence or righteousness. Following simplicity makes nurturance easy. 'Non-giving' means not harming oneself for the sake of things. Wandering and following one’s nature is gathering truth; gathering truth means appearances are not falsified.

The world has no one who burdens themselves with what they reject, yet all perish in what they affirm. To perish in what one affirms is not to stand in the garden of non-giving."

The sorrow of relinquishment is that one cannot grasp it without trembling. To have nothing to reflect upon and peer into what never ceases—this means knowing how to advance but not how to stop, and thus one’s nature and life are lost. "To be executed at the Gate of Heaven without opening" speaks of clinging to the old without change, and thus losing the correct path.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, yet the Dao is not the One, Two, or Three. Seeking it in measurements and numbers does not go beyond the bounds of numbers, thus after five years one has yet to attain the Dao. Dividing it into yin and yang, the Dao is not yin and yang. Seeking it in yin and yang does not go beyond the vastness of the heavens, thus after twelve years one has yet to attain the Dao. The reason it cannot be offered to one’s parents, told to one’s brothers and descendants, is that within there is no master, and without there is no correctness. With no master within, though I wish to bestow it, the other does not stop. With no correctness without, though the other wishes to receive it, I cannot enact it. That things have a master is inherent to them. The Dao within oneself is simply one’s inherent possession; to lack it and yet possess it is to have no master within and thus no stopping. That archery has correctness is how it is received. The Dao in relation to others is simply what they receive; to lack what they receive and yet force it is to have no correctness without and thus no enactment. What issues from within is not received from without. The sage does not issue forth because there is no correctness. What enters from without has no master within. The sage does not store it because there is no stopping. Not storing it means it cannot be pushed and taken in—this is the meaning.

Thus, the Dao cannot be sought in measurements, numbers, or yin and yang. Seek it within oneself alone. Fame cannot be excessively taken; excessive taking dissipates virtue. Benevolence and righteousness cannot be long dwelled in; long dwelling leads to encounter and multiplied demands. Wandering freely means there is nowhere one does not reach. Following simplicity makes one’s seeking easy to sustain. "Non-giving" means not exchanging with things. In this way, all one gathers is nothing but truth. Inability to yield emolument means knowing only wealth. Inability to yield fame means knowing only prominence. Inability to yield power to others means knowing only authority. Those who cling to power and relinquishment harm their nature most severely. To have nothing to reflect upon and peer into the turbid water is to be deluded by the clear abyss. To never cease is to incur Heaven’s punishment, which cannot be undone. Gratitude and resentment, giving and taking, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of correctness, not the Dao of correctness. Only by following great change without obstruction can one employ the instruments’ Dao. Using the instruments by means of the Dao—this is how correctness becomes correctness. The Gate of Heaven is the path by which one enters and exits, following great change without obstruction. To think otherwise is to know that the Gate of Heaven does not open.

**New Transmission:**
The Dao gathers in emptiness, and emptiness suffices to contain the Dao. Emptiness is unity, and its movement is unimpeded. Thus, without emptiness, it does not gather. Hence, "with no master within, there is no stopping." Without unity, there is no unimpeded movement. Hence, "with no correctness without, there is no enactment." What gathers within must move without—this is what is meant by issuing from within. What issues from within—how could it be received from without? This is why the sage firmly guards it. Thus, "what issues from within is not received from without; the sage does not issue forth." What moves without is due to gathering within—this is what is meant by entering from without. What enters from without—how could it gather without emptiness? This is why the sage must enact it. Thus, "what enters from without has no master within; the sage does not store it." This is Lao Dan’s discourse on the beginning and end of entering the Dao and putting it into practice.

**Xu Xi:**
"Encounter and multiplied demands" means that whenever one sees these, one will expect and demand of me. If even one is unmet, the former is lost. "To have nothing to reflect upon and peer into what never ceases" means having no sight of true principle, only peering into the ceaselessness of desires—this is the punishment of the people.

**Fu Mo:**
Gratitude and resentment, giving and taking, admonition and instruction, life and death—these are the instruments by which one corrects others. "Change" refers to the great matter of life and death. "Without obstruction" means responding to the moment with clarity, like a single blade cutting two—no obstruction remains. Using these instruments with such a person allows one not to be turned by circumstances and to wander in the realm of freedom. If one’s heart thinks otherwise, there is external seeing but no master within, and the Gate of Heaven does not open. The Gate of Heaven refers to the numinous palace, also derived from Laozi’s "opening and closing of the Gate of Heaven."

Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: "When chaff blinds the eyes, the heavens and earth and the four directions shift places. When mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep through the night. Benevolence and righteousness, so overwhelming—nothing confounds the heart more! If you, Master, could make the world not lose its simplicity, you would also move with the wind and stand with total virtue. Why then exert yourself like one carrying a great drum in search of a lost child? The swan does not bathe daily yet remains white; the crow does not blacken daily yet remains black. The simplicity of black and white is not sufficient for distinction. The spectacle of fame and reputation is not sufficient for vastness. When the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on land, exhaling moisture upon one another, wetting each other with foam—better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes."

Confucius visited Lao Dan and returned without speaking for three days. His disciples asked: "Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what advice did you receive?" Confucius said: "Only now have I truly seen the dragon! The dragon coalesces to form its body, scatters to form its patterns, riding the..."

The clouds and qi nourish the Yin and Yang—yet when I open my mouth, I cannot speak. What advice could I possibly offer Lao Dan?

Zi Gong said: "Then are there indeed men who dwell like corpses yet manifest as dragons, who thunder like thunder yet remain as silent as the abyss, whose movements are like those of Heaven and Earth? Might I be permitted to witness such a one?" Thereupon, he announced Confucius’s arrival to Lao Dan. Lao Dan was just then reclining in the hall and responded faintly: "The years have borne me away—what warning could you have for me?"

Zi Gong said: "The governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors differed in method, yet their renown was the same. Why then do you alone deem them not sages?"

Lao Dan said: "Young man, come closer. Why do you say their methods differed?"

Zi Gong replied: "Yao ceded to Shun, Shun ceded to Yu. Yu labored with toil, while Tang wielded the sword. King Wen submitted to Zhou yet dared not oppose him; King Wu opposed Zhou yet would not submit. Thus I say their methods differed."

Lao Dan said: "Young man, come closer, and I will tell you of the governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors. The governance of the Yellow Emperor made the hearts of the people one: when a man’s kin died, he did not weep, yet none reproached him. The governance of Yao made the hearts of the people affectionate: when a man killed for his kin, none reproached him. The governance of Shun made the hearts of the people competitive: pregnant women gave birth in ten months, and their children spoke at five months, yet before they could even toddle, some began to die young. The governance of Yu made the hearts of the people change: men grew cunning, and warfare followed its own order. Killing thieves was not considered killing men, and the world became a breeding ground for strife. Thus did the world grow greatly alarmed, and the Ru and Mo schools arose, each with its own standards. And now—what need have women to speak of such things?

I tell you: the governance of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors was called ‘order,’ yet no disorder was greater. The wisdom of the Three Kings contradicted the brightness of sun and moon, disrupted the essence of mountains and rivers, and threw into chaos the workings of the four seasons. Their cunning was more venomous than the sting of a scorpion’s tail or the bite of a centipede. Even the smallest creatures could not preserve the integrity of their natures—yet they still called themselves sages. Is this not shameful? Truly, it is shameless."

Zi Gong stood uneasily, shifting his feet.

A child speaks at five months—this is called hasty instruction. "Who" means distinguishing others' intentions. Before learning to laugh, one already selects people—this is called competing for swift mastery. If one cannot harmonize self and other, the heart contends over closeness and distance, and thus one does not fulfill one’s natural lifespan.

Warfare arises from compliance with words, for the world already harbors disobedience. Thieves naturally deserve death; killing them is compliance. Thus, only through killing can the myriad things be greatly equalized, and each person distinguishes themselves—this is how people become their own kind.

Following the flow of a hundred generations and guarding against the present age’s changes, this corruption has reached such a point—not through Yu. Thus it is said: the world is but an ear. The traces of sagely wisdom do not disrupt the world, yet the world inevitably falls into this chaos.

Ru and Mo both arose from this, the corruption of a hundred generations. Now, even women act in rebellion above and below—this is not due to the irrationality of the founders, but the corruption of the utmost principle has come to this. What more is there to say?

Though the governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors did not escape corruption, Zi Gong originally believed Laozi alone surpassed the Three Kings and sought to equate the Three Kings with the Five Emperors. Now, seeing Laozi universally condemn the Five Emperors and extend his critique to the Three August Ones, he loses the basis of his argument.

Lü’s commentary:
Laozi likened benevolence and righteousness to chaff blinding the eyes or mosquitoes stinging the skin—thus, the Five Emperors and Three Kings were rightfully deemed unworthy of sageliness. Yet Zi Gong sought to reconcile them through yielding and contention, compliance and rebellion. In terms of their traces, altering the people’s hearts is no better than fostering kinship, and fostering kinship is no better than unity. All alike fail to avoid governing the world and making the people develop intentions—yet this is called "order," though the world’s chaos begins here.

If one employs cunning, it is not only the Five Emperors and Three Kings who will contradict the brightness of sun and moon below, disrupt the essence of mountains and rivers, and make their wisdom more venomous than the sting of a scorpion’s tail. Even the beasts that dwell in mountains and forests, active by night and resting by day, though starving and parched, still keep their distance on the rivers and lakes—how much more so the smallest creatures! Zi Gong, hearing Laozi’s condemnation of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors yet unable to grasp the grounds for it, stood uneasily, shifting his feet.

Supplementary Ink:
The governance of the Yellow Emperor made the people’s hearts unified—utterly pure and singular. Yao made the people cherish kinship, fostering harmony among the nine clans. When one killed in accordance with kinship, the people did not condemn it, for affection and ritual were uniquely exalted in kinship, while all else was diminished—yet the people did not feel slighted.

Shun made the people’s hearts contend—compete, that is. The Yu Emperor esteemed worthiness, so he made the people vie with one another. Contention ruptures harmonious qi, and the body’s mechanisms open prematurely, so that pregnant women give birth in ten months, children speak at five months, and before learning to laugh, they distinguish "who." No wonder they die young.

Yu made the people’s hearts change—change from the ancient ways. Each person developed intentions, each had their own scheming heart. Warfare arises from compliance, for using arms is deemed compliance. Those who kill are executed; those who kill thieves are blameless. Thus, killing thieves is not killing people. Each guards their own interests, mutually on alert—the world is thus. Hence, it is said: "each becomes their own kind," and the world is but an ear.

The great beginnings of men and women—ancient people established order: thirty for marriage, twenty for betrothal. Young girls were not held to human norms. Yet now—how could it be otherwise? The hearts of cunning and vigilance, the customs of deceit and shallowness—need one speak of them? Thus it is said: what more is there to say?

The passage bears a strong resemblance to the chapter *"The Great Dao is for the Public"* in the *Record of Ritual*. Confucius said to Laozi: "I, Qiu, have studied the Six Classics—*Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn*—and believed myself well-versed in their origins. Yet in expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the traces of Zhou and Shao, I have petitioned seventy-two rulers, and not one has put my words into practice. How difficult it is to persuade men! Is the Dao truly so hard to illuminate?"

Laozi replied: "Fortunate indeed that you have not met a ruler of a well-ordered age. The Six Classics are but the worn traces of the former kings—how could they be the essence of those traces? What you speak of now are still traces. Tracks are what emerge from shoes, but are tracks the same as shoes? When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils do not move, yet the wind transforms them. The male insect cries on the wind above, and the female responds from the wind below, and transformation occurs. Thus, male and female arise of themselves. The nature wrought by the wind cannot be altered; fate cannot be changed; the seasons cannot be halted; the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be done; if one loses it, there is nothing that can be preserved."

Confucius did not emerge for three months before returning to see Laozi, saying: "I have grasped it! The young of crows and magpies, the fry of fish, the mating of mayflies—those with younger siblings weep for their elder brothers. For too long, I, Qiu, have not transformed with the world; how could I transform others?"

Laozi said: "Good. You have grasped it."

The term "wind transformation" (feng hua), as noted by Sima, refers to the transmission of qi through wind that gives rise to transformation. The *lei* is a beast mentioned in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*: "On Mount Danyuan, there is a beast resembling a leopard but with a mane; its name is *lei*, and it reproduces as both male and female." Guo Pu’s commentary cites the *Zhuangzi* to explain this. Crows (*wu*) nurture their young by hatching them; fish reproduce through the foam they expel without direct mating; and the "slender-waisted" refers to wasps and their kin.

Guo’s annotation states: What leaves traces is true nature. To follow the true nature of things is to leave traces like the Six Classics. Yet in human affairs today, the natural is treated as the shoe, and the Six Classics as mere traces. The white egret gazes with unmoving pupils, and transformation occurs through the wind; insects respond to each other’s calls without physical union, and transformation follows. Thus, in wind transformation, the male and female of the *lei* each possess their own means of mutual resonance, and the variations of this resonance are boundless. If one grasps the essence of this resonance, transformation is effortless—even distant resonance can lead to wind transformation. Nature, fate, seasons, and the Dao: the perfected person harmonizes with and flows through them all. One who attains the Dao finds nothing impossible; one who loses it finds nothing that can be preserved. The transformations of crows, fish, and wasps speak to the natural dispositions of all things. "The elder brother weeps for his younger sibling" illustrates how human nature, abandoning the elder to favor the younger, elicits such a response. To "transform with the world" is to allow things to transform of themselves. If one inverts the Six Classics to expound upon this, one erects barriers.

Lü’s annotation states: The Six Classics are the laws of the former kings, clearly set forth in measures and records, yet they are not the means by which transformation occurs. The means of transformation lies in spirit and illumination alone. Traces arise from the shoe, but are traces the shoe itself? To govern the world by such means is surely ineffective. The white egret gazes without moving its pupils, and wind transformation occurs through mutual resonance of spirit, not sound. The male insect cries on the upper wind, and the female responds from the lower wind, their resonance arising from sound, not form. The *lei* reproduces as both male and female, thus exemplifying wind transformation. All such phenomena arise because nature differs and cannot be altered, fate is fixed and cannot be changed, the seasons proceed and cannot be halted, and the Dao flows and cannot be obstructed. How could mere words or speculative thought grasp this? To understand how the world is transformed, one must seek not in the remnants of the past but in the Dao itself.

Confucius did not emerge for three months, gaining insight during his fasting and bodily discipline. He realized that crows, magpies, fish, and wasps all give life, yet their means of doing so are never the same—this is knowledge beyond knowing. Transformation alone matters. "The elder brother weeps for his younger sibling" is a matter of human sentiment, for transformation is uniform, yet sentiment, even among brothers, is not. To expect others to transform is difficult indeed. For too long has it been so.

The Master did not align with transformation to become human; rather, he embodied the Dao without reaching the point of becoming human alongside the Creator. How then could he transform others? Those who study Confucius yet fail to grasp the essence behind his traces suffer precisely from this flaw.

The four lines—"crows and magpies nurture their young," "an elder brother weeps for his younger sibling"—may seem obscure at first reading, but upon deeper reflection, the principles of transformation are vast. For within them are manifest the four modes of birth—womb, egg, moisture, and transformation—though people remain unaware. The principles of heaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness, the mechanisms of creation’s growth and decline, though silently operating in formlessness, are all revealed through the four births. Among the four births, humans hold primacy; among the multitudes, the sage holds primacy. The sage aligns with transformation to become human, and in knowing transformation, one knows heaven.

Thus, this chapter concludes with a discussion of transformation. If one does not govern heaven and earth, administer the myriad things, and move independently beyond the realm of nurturing and transforming, how can one transform others? As the *Daodejing* states, "The highest virtue takes no action, yet the people transform themselves." Observe the wind-borne transformation of the egret, the hatching of crows and magpies, the foam-borne birth of fish, and the ritualized procreation of wasps—all arise from natural disposition and are perfected through concentrated effort. This mutual resonance, this unquestionable response, is called transformation.

Humans, being the most spiritually endowed, possess a transformation even more wondrous than these, yet it does not transcend the principles of nature or the power of concentrated effort.

**A Humble Overview**

This treatise begins by expounding the movements of heaven and the positions of earth, posing questions about the circulation of the sun and moon, the flow of wind and clouds. It answers that the Six Poles and Five Constants, along with the governance of the Three Sovereigns, follow the celestial rotations and enact virtue and education—thus, through non-action, the people transform themselves, delighting in spontaneity. Next, it discusses supreme benevolence as impartial and supreme honor as rejecting rank, both embodying the principle of celestial motion through effortless action.

Further, it speaks of the grand music performed at Dongting, illuminating the profound subtleties of the Great Dao—orchestrated through yin and yang, conducted with ritual and righteousness—establishing the foundation of resonance between heaven and humanity. Harmonizing the four seasons, fostering the great harmony of the myriad things, and aligning cold and heat in proper sequence constitute the wellspring of generation and transformation. Movement without fixed direction yet abiding in profound stillness, the celestial mechanism settled and the five officials complete—this allows for latent concealment or manifest emergence in response to things, unbound by form. Where sound is exhausted, celestial wandering arrives, and nowhere does it reach that is not perfect harmony; where resonance fades, supreme music abides, and nowhere does it dwell that is not ultimate joy.

As for governance, policies compared to withered straw dogs and laws likened to inverted pearwood or the tearing of Zhou Gong’s robes by apes, or an ugly woman mimicking Xi Shi’s beauty—these illustrate that politics must be fitting and timely. Cooking the fresh lies in not stirring; those who rule must embody the Dao, emulate heaven, and move in accord with transformation, rhythmically guiding the times. Their grace and nurturance will bring things to full maturity—how could there be any who remain untransformed?

When Confucius saw Laozi, he marveled at him as a dragon, for he had united humanity with heaven but had not yet achieved complete transformation. Upon hearing the wondrous subtleties of the profound thunder, he then discarded the vestiges of the Six Classics to investigate their essence. If one’s traces do not exceed three months and one becomes a person of transformation, then one’s traces align with humanity while one’s essence merges with heaven.

The *Book of Changes* states, "The movement of heaven is strong"—this is the essence of its rotation. "Essence and qi become things; the wandering soul becomes change"—this is the essence of its transformation. Ah!

Those who carve their intent and exalt conduct, distancing themselves from the world and differing from common customs, whose lofty discourse is but resentment and slander—these are but extremes. Such are the preferences of the recluses of mountain valleys, those who are not of this world, the withered and emaciated who plunge into the abyss.

Those who speak of benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust, reverence and frugality, deference and yielding—these are but cultivated refinements. Such are the preferences of the scholars of peaceful eras, the instructive and edifying, those who wander and dwell in study.

Those who speak of great achievements, establishing great names, observing the rites between ruler and minister, rectifying high and low—these are but governance. Such are the preferences of the courtiers, those who honor their lords and strengthen their states, the achievers and consolidators.

Those who dwell in marshes and wilds, abide in leisure and openness, fish and idle, doing nothing—these are but inaction. Such are the preferences of the recluses of rivers and seas, those who flee the world, the idle and unoccupied.

Those who blow and exhale, inhale and absorb, expel the old and take in the new, imitate the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—these are but longevity. Such are the preferences of the practitioners of Dao-yin, those who nurture the body, the long-lived like Pengzu.

Yet those who do not carve their intent yet rise high, who lack benevolence and righteousness yet are refined, who lack achievements and fame yet govern, who lack rivers and seas yet are at leisure, who do not practice Dao-yin yet live long—nothing do they forget, and nothing do they lack. Serene and boundless, all excellences follow them. This is the Dao of heaven and earth, the virtue of the sage.

Thus it is said: "Tranquility, indifference, stillness, emptiness, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of heaven and earth and the substance of the Dao and virtue."

Those who resent and slander the world as lacking the Dao resent only their own failure to meet with it. "Bear-climbing" is like the bear’s ascent of trees to guide the qi; "bird-stretching" is like the bird’s cries and groans. Dao-yin is the guiding of qi to harmonize it and the stretching of the body to soften it.

Guo’s commentary: These several masters each follow their own preferences, indulging their inclinations and pursuing their own methods—this too is a way of attaining freedom. Yet such practices merely allow each to attain their own satisfaction. How could they extend to all things without exception? As for enabling the myriad things each to fulfill their allotted portion without losing themselves, this must be entrusted to non-attachment and non-action. "Not carving the intent" refers to what is called "spontaneity." "Nothing is not forgotten, nothing is not possessed" means that only through forgetting can one possess; if one clings to possession, one cannot remedy forgetfulness. Thus possession is not possession through possessing, but possession through forgetting. If one forces oneself to act, one cannot attain boundlessness, and all evils arise.

Heaven and earth do not act for the sake of the myriad things, yet the myriad things arise of themselves. The sage does not act for the sake of the hundred practices, yet the hundred practices are accomplished of themselves. This is the equilibrium of heaven and earth and the substance of the Dao and virtue. If it were not for stillness, emptiness, and non-action, this equilibrium would be imperiled and this substance lost.

The newly transmitted passage states: Those scholars of mountain valleys and peaceful eras, those who strengthen their states or withdraw to nurture their forms—all are bound by the self. With the self comes the heart-mind; with the heart-mind comes inescapable delusion, each thus confined to a single corner. Those who delight in mountains and marshes go forth but cannot return; those who serve in court enter but cannot depart; those content with teaching bend but cannot extend; those devoted to nurturing form preserve but cannot forget. This is not the natural state of true nature—it is the distortion of their intent that makes it so. How could this be the same as the sage?

The sage is simply without self. Without self, there is no heart-mind; without heart-mind, there is no delusion. Thus, forgetting form, one penetrates all affairs. Ascending to the utmost Dao, one enters the vast oneness of heaven—was this achieved through forced effort and lofty ambition? Benefiting beings and moistening the world arises not from external imposition—was this accomplished through practicing benevolence and righteousness? Vast and boundless, governing the world through non-interference—was this done to establish merit and fame? Profoundly still and obscurely silent, roaming freely in the realm of self-attainment—was this sought by dwelling in rivers and lakes for leisure? Qi gentle and integrity whole, the form never declines—was this attained through pursuing breathwork and longevity? Existing yet not existing, absent yet not absent, none know its end, yet the utmost Dao gathers of itself. All is the supreme subtlety of non-action, and only the sage attains it.

Thus it is said: The sage rests in perfect ease.

Then it is level and easy. Level and easy, then tranquil and at rest. Level, easy, tranquil, and at rest—then cares and troubles cannot enter, and pernicious qi cannot assail. Thus their virtue remains whole and their spirit unharmed.

Thus it is said: The sage’s life follows the course of Heaven; their death is the transformation of things. At rest, they share the power of yin; in motion, they move with the waves of yang. They do not precede fortune, nor do they initiate misfortune. They respond only after being stirred, move only when pressed, and rise only when there is no alternative. Abandoning knowledge and old habits, they follow Heaven’s principle—thus they suffer no heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. Their life is like floating; their death, like repose. They neither scheme nor plan ahead. Radiant, yet not dazzling; trustworthy, yet not demanding. In sleep, they do not dream; in wakefulness, they know no care. Their spirit is pure, their soul unwearied.

Empty and tranquil, at rest and still—only thus do they accord with Heaven’s virtue.

Thus it is said: Sorrow and joy are deviations of virtue; delight and anger are transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes are losses of virtue. The heart free of sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue. Unchanging unity is the perfection of stillness. Nothing to oppose is the perfection of emptiness. No interaction with things is the perfection of blandness. Nothing to resist is the perfection of purity.

Guo’s commentary: *"At rest—tranquil, still, and silent; at peace—empty, without action. Though passing through..."*

The transformations of perilous obstacles are ever level and free from difficulty. Calamity arises from action, and action likewise arises from calamity—thus, level ease and tranquil stillness complete one another.

Anxieties and misfortunes cannot enter; perverse qi cannot assail, for one merges indistinguishably with the correct principle and proceeds as one with it. Thus, their virtue remains whole and their spirit unharmed.

As for those who are neither level nor bland—do they merely injure their form? Their spirit and virtue perish together within.

The movements of Heaven proceed by their own nature; the transformations of things shed their forms without attachment. In activity and stillness, they are without intent, entrusting themselves to yin and yang. They respond only after being moved, acting only when encounters arise. They rise when compelled, following principle in their arising—this is what I mean by "compelled." The naturalness of Heaven’s principle knows no action within its realm. Thus, disaster arises from opposing Heaven, and entanglements arise from resisting things.

Those who harmonize with others are many, and these must be correct. Therefore, free from human reproach, they align with self-attainment; free from demonic blame, their life drifts and their death rests, floating without attachment.

They do not scheme, entrusting themselves to Heaven’s principle; they do not plan ahead, responding only when principle arrives. Radiant, yet not dazzling—they employ the world’s own radiance, not their own brilliance. Trustworthy, yet not demanding—they employ the world’s own trustworthiness, not their own expectations.

Desiring nothing, their sleep is dreamless, their wakefulness carefree. Their spirit is pure, their soul unwearied—thus do they unite with Heaven and Earth in the virtue of tranquil stillness.

Supreme virtue is ever at ease, so emotions hold no sway. Still and unified, they cannot be altered. Their heart is open and utterly empty—this is the perfection of emptiness.

Things come of themselves. The most bland have no emotional entanglement with things; if mixed with turbid desires, there will be that which does not accord.

Lü’s Annotation:
The sage rests in perfect ease, never enslaving the mind to choices of acceptance or rejection. When level, there is no bias; when changing, there is no struggle. Serene and knowing nothing, tranquil and unengaged with things—this is what is meant by “stillness and non-action,” and it is no more than this.

Worry and misfortune, along with pathogenic qi, gain entry and strike only because of knowledge. Knowledge engages with things, and gaps arise between them. Yet life itself is the movement of Heaven, and thus has never truly been born—so why rejoice at emergence? Transformation of things is the process of Heaven, and thus has never truly died—so why resist reversion? Stillness shares its virtue with yin, yet one does not perceive it as stillness. Movement flows with yang, yet one does not perceive it as movement.

Not seeking fortune first, fortune too remains unaware. Not initiating calamity, calamity too does not arrive. For when fortune is sought first or calamity initiated, there is no resonance in response, no compulsion to act—only necessity arising from the use of knowledge and deliberate effort, which is the way of ordinary people. Following the natural spontaneity of Heaven’s principle, Heaven cannot bring disaster, things cannot impose burdens—thus there is no human fault or blame.

How fitting, then, that life drifts and death rests, without resonance yet still; things arrive and one responds, emanating Heaven’s radiance yet not dazzling. Within, there is trust yet no covenant; dreamless sleep and carefree wakefulness are the same. Purity is unadulterated, untiring, and non-action is the virtue of Heaven—this is how the sage rules all under Heaven.

Grief and joy are emotions difficult to dispel, hence they become deviations in virtue. Anger and delight arise and vanish in an instant, hence they become excesses in the Dao. All four stem from likes and dislikes—likes and dislikes are the unmanifest forms of grief, joy, anger, and delight.

If the human mind is filled with ten thousand thoughts all day without cease, how can it attain even a moment of stillness? The sage, free from sorrow and joy, reaches unity and remains unchanging—this is the ultimate stillness. Unobstructed and unopposed, like an empty boat striking objects yet not provoking anger—this is the ultimate emptiness. Unengaged with things, there is no flavor—this is the ultimate blandness. Thus, even entering water or treading fire, there is nowhere that is not oneself. How could there be resistance? This is the ultimate purity.

Fang’s Inquiry:
What distinguishes the characters *wu* (忤, opposition) and *ni* (逆, resistance) that they are spoken of separately? Reflecting on *xu* (虚, emptiness) and *cui* (粹, purity), one sees that to comply with affairs and respond to things without discord or friction, how could this be achieved without the utmost emptiness? With a mind utterly pure and unadulterated, it naturally encompasses all images and contains all things without resistance.

Thus it is said: when form labors without rest, it becomes exhausted; when essence is employed without cease, it becomes weary. Weariness leads to depletion. Water’s nature, unadulterated, is clear; undisturbed, it is level. Stagnant and blocked, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heaven’s virtue.

Thus it is said: pure and unadulterated, still and unified without change, bland and non-active, moving in accord with Heaven’s course—this is the way to nurture the spirit.

One who possesses a Gan-Yue sword keeps it cased and hidden, never daring to use it—such is its supreme value. The spirit reaches in all four directions, flowing without limit, ascending to the heavens, coiling through the earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things. It cannot be represented in form; its name is “co-equal with the Emperor.” The Dao of pure simplicity guards only the spirit, holding fast without loss, uniting with the spirit as one. Its essence communicates, harmonizing with Heaven’s order.

A rustic saying goes: “The common man values profit, the upright scholar values reputation, the worthy prizes aspiration, the sage treasures essence.” *Su* (素, simplicity) means having nothing mixed with it; *chun* (纯, purity) means not scattering one’s spirit. One who embodies pure simplicity is called a *zhenren* (真人, true person).

[Sima’s Note: Gan refers to Wu. Gan Stream is a great river in Yue where famous swords are produced.]

Guo’s Annotation:
Without rest, there is exhaustion; without cease, there is weariness; weariness leads to depletion—all things have their proper measure, which must not be lost. Water’s nature, an image of Heaven’s virtue, is without intent yet harmonizes with all. Pure and unadulterated, nothing is not in perfect accord. Still and unified without change, it constantly abides in what is proper. Bland and non-active, it merely prevents excess. Moving in accord with Heaven’s course—if one moves in pursuit of things, that is the movement of man.

One who cherishes a sword still keeps it cased and hidden—how much more should one dare to lightly use the spirit? The spirit reaches in all four directions, ascending to the heavens, coiling through the earth. Embracing the ultimate of Heaven and Earth, responding to the patterns of the myriad things—this is the nature of the spirit. Thus it is so.

If one achieves the work of Heaven and Earth, it is by following Heaven’s course, not by lightly using the spirit. Transforming and nurturing the myriad things, its name is “co-equal with the Emperor,” for what it nurtures is boundless, like the Heavenly Emperor who does not act. Pure simplicity, unlost, unites with the spirit as one. Constantly guarding pure simplicity in utmost stillness, undisturbed by externals—this is prevention.

Essence is the true nature of things. Uniting with the spirit is not about guarding the spirit, nor is treasuring essence about prizing essence—yet in practice, one values guarding it. If purity is taken as not being diminished, then even if a hundred deeds are performed together and ten thousand changes are encompassed, it is still purity. If simplicity is taken as not being mixed, then even with dragon patterns and phoenix forms, appearing with extraordinary beauty, it is still simplicity. But if one cannot preserve one’s natural quality and mixes it with external adornments, then even the markings of dogs and sheep—how can that be called pure simplicity?

Lü’s Annotation:
Observing the sage’s heart—empty, non-existent, serene, and bland—one sees that even when engaged in affairs all day, the spirit does not labor. The ancients spoke of “setting aside the mind and employing the form,” of seeing and hearing without using the ears and eyes—this is the way. Now, one must “entrust the ears.”

The eyes are ensnared by sights and sounds, the mind enslaved by grasping and rejecting—thus the form labors without rest, the essence is expended without cease, until exhaustion and depletion are only fitting. The nature of water is clarity and levelness, inherently so by nature; it remains unadulterated and unmoving. To know this yet take stagnation and blockage as "unmoving" is to fail to attain clarity. The image of Heaven’s virtue is likewise: purity without admixture is the image of water’s clarity; stillness and oneness without change is the image of water’s levelness. Yet when water moves, it follows the Way of Heaven—not taking stagnation and blockage as the image of "unmoving." The various arts of the world impose restraints through emptiness and stillness, unaware of observing return amid the surge of activity, of returning to the root amid the teeming profusion—this is because they do not know the Dao of nurturing the spirit. Yet the people of the world believe that nurturing the form is sufficient to preserve life, though it is not even comparable to the sheathing of a sword for its sharpness. The spirit spans Heaven and coils upon Earth—how could its utility be limited to the sharpness of a sword from Gan or Yue? Its name is shared with the Emperor—how could its value be merely that of a treasured blade? Yet they do not know to hone it with purity, to sheath it with stillness and oneness, to store it through non-action, to guide it by the Heavenly movement—this is to fail to understand the distinction between noble and base. Only the spirit is to be preserved; preserve it with pure simplicity alone. When one preserves it, there is what is called "preserving"; to preserve without loss is for the preserver and the preserved to merge as one. *Lun* is principle. When a person accords with Heavenly principle, they are simply Heaven. This is why the sage values essence. Simplicity is without admixture; essence is without diminution. Only the true person can achieve this.

**Guan’s General Discussion:**
This chapter is titled "Carving the Intent," for it speaks of carving and honing one’s intent, defying the world, correcting customs, embracing austerity, and bearing responsibility alone—things the world cannot do—hoping others will follow, no different from yoking an ox or bridling a horse, losing their naturalness. To know the long virtue is to disperse the people; the beginning of difficulty in governance lies here. Thus *Nanhua* recounts the differing aspirations of the ancients: Boyi and Shuqi’s defiance, Confucius and Mencius’s cultivation, Yi Yin and Fu Yue’s governance, Xu You and Chao Fu’s reclusion, Laozi and Pengzu’s longevity. Judging by their traces, none seem entirely without bias, yet they remain sages and worthies because their actions do not entangle them in being, their non-action does not drown them in non-being. They adapt to the possibilities of the times and the utility of the self—this is why they value emptiness, non-action, levelness, ease, tranquility, the Heavenly movement, and the transformation of things, sharing virtue and riding the same wave. Knowing the past does not linger; movement accords with Heavenly principle—then how could calamity and entanglement arise? How could life and death, plans and worries, disturb them? Thus, stillness, emptiness, tranquility, and purity do not clash with things, ultimately culminating in the work of nurturing the spirit. The analogy of sheathing the sword from Gan and Yue is extended: how lightly do people regard the body, yet they remain so deluded. Therefore, the argument begins by rejecting the habit of carving the intent and exalting conduct, and concludes by affirming that one who embodies pure simplicity is a true person. Thus, it is clear that those who carve and exalt are false. For nurturing life, pure simplicity is fundamental; for pure simplicity, preserving the spirit is primary. When one merges with the spirit as one, the great root of the Dao is established—what need is there to fuss over trifles and engage in carving the intent and exalting conduct?

To refine one’s nature through vulgar learning in pursuit of returning to its origin, or to muddy the marrow of desire with vulgar thoughts in pursuit of attaining clarity—these are called the benighted masses. Those who cultivated the Dao in antiquity nurtured knowledge with tranquility, never employing knowledge as a means. This is called using knowledge to nurture tranquility. When knowledge and tranquility mutually nurture one another, harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature.

Virtue is harmony; the Dao is principle. Virtue admits all without exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao governs all without disorder—this is righteousness. When righteousness is luminous, things draw near—this is loyalty. When the center is pure and solid, returning to genuine feeling—this is joy. When trust is enacted and the body is composed, conforming to refinement—this is propriety. If propriety and music are practiced in isolation, the world falls into chaos.

Those who rectify themselves yet remain benighted have already lost virtue. When virtue is lost, one becomes reckless; when reckless, things inevitably lose their nature.

Guo’s Commentary:
One who has already refined their nature through the vulgar, yet seeks to restore the root of life and destiny through vulgar learning, strays further from the Way the more they pursue it. One who has already disturbed their mind with the vulgar, yet labors thought to seek clarity, drifts further from truth the more they refine their thinking. To dispel ignorance, one must depart from the vulgar, relinquish desire, and only then approach the threshold.

Tranquility gives rise to knowledge; when knowledge does not stray, nature is not lost. If one does not employ knowledge as a means but allows it to arise naturally, then though knowledge encompasses all things, one remains serene and self-content. Knowledge that does not act as interference does no harm to tranquility; tranquility that acts of itself does no injury to knowledge. When the two mutually nurture one another, how could the division of harmony and principle arise from anything else?

Harmony, therefore, admits nothing that is not the Dao; principle admits nothing that is not governed. The all-embracing is not enacted as benevolence, yet the traces of benevolence manifest. The all-governing is not enacted as righteousness, yet the efficacy of righteousness becomes evident. If righteousness is luminous but does not arise from loyalty, things grow more distant. When benevolence and righteousness emerge from the center and return to the original disposition, the will is fulfilled. When the will is fulfilled, its outward expression is joy.

Faithfulness in conduct, accommodation in form, following the natural rhythms of spontaneity—its outward manifestation is ritual. If one imposes the practices of a single region or the joys of a single will upon the world, then one locality gains while the myriad regions lose. When each rectifies its nature and destiny, self-cultivating its inherent virtue, it does not use this to override that. If one uses this to override that, how could one not lose one’s nature?

**Lü’s Commentary:**
To refine one’s nature through conventional customs is ever troubled by the error of embellishing life and losing one’s original state; if one then seeks to restore it through vulgar learning, one strays even further. To muddy one’s desires with conventional customs is ever troubled by the error of abandoning simplicity and confounding one’s clarity; if one then seeks to attain it through reflection, one becomes even more obscured. Tranquility rests in what is so without knowing why—this is how one nurtures knowledge, not by seeking clarity through reflection. Life arises without employing knowledge, and thus does not differ from it—this is how one nurtures tranquility, not by restoring one’s original state through vulgar learning. The numinous clarity of the *Yijing*, the "elusive and indistinct" of Laozi, the "tranquility and knowledge" of Zhuangzi—these are in truth one and the same. Those in antiquity who cultivated the Dao never failed to nurture these two in mutual exchange and thereby attain mastery. The flaw of tranquility lies in obscurity, where it cannot radiate illumination; the flaw of knowledge lies in rigidity, where it cannot return to undifferentiated unity. When these two nurture one another, harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature—not from anything external.

That which pervades Heaven and Earth is virtue; virtue is harmony. That which courses through the myriad things is the Dao; the Dao is principle. The essence of virtue is harmony, and its function admits all without exclusion—this is benevolence. The essence of the Dao is principle, and its function governs all without exception—this is righteousness. When righteousness is luminous, things cannot but draw near in loyalty. When the center is pure and unfeigned, joy arises from it. Sincerity resides within and takes form without, becoming pattern and ritual. Ritual is the attenuation of loyalty and sincerity, the harbinger of disorder. When the myriad things each rectify their nature and destiny, they self-cultivate their inherent virtue—what need is there for virtue to override others? When ritual and music are practiced in isolation, the Dao and virtue grow ever more distant, and one cannot avoid overriding others. Overriding leads things to lose their nature, and this is why the world falls into chaos.

**Bǐshèng’s Notes:**
"Refining one’s nature through conventional learning" and "muddying one’s desires through conventional reflection" are complete phrases—previous interpretations have erred. Nature is not restored through learning, yet vulgar learning cannot restore nature. Clarity is not attained through reflection, yet vulgar reflection cannot seek clarity. What is called "vulgar" stands in contrast to the real, for the moment one moves in thought, one strays; how much more so when refining through imitation, where the mind is already misaligned. Not only does this fail to penetrate one’s obscurity, but it only deepens one’s delusion.

To nurture knowledge with tranquility is the essential path to restoring nature and attaining clarity. Knowledge is the awakened nature of humanity—this nature can be nurtured by tranquility but cannot be refined through learning or confounded by reflection. Tranquility is the state of non-action and spontaneity. To speak of "nurturing knowledge" seems to imply an intention toward knowledge, yet one does not realize that the essence of knowledge is emptiness, profound stillness, and utter absence of attachment. It is having knowledge while in truth not acting through knowledge. Thus, it is also called "nurturing tranquility with knowledge." Tranquility is what Chan Buddhists call "non-knowledge"; knowledge is what they call "knowing the nothing." When in tranquility, knowledge resides in tranquility; when in knowledge, tranquility resides in knowledge. Hence, it is said that knowledge and tranquility nurture one another. In this way, the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, ritual, and music are all unified, like a tree with roots where flowers and fruit flourish together—what is attained cannot be called partial practice.

If one does not proceed from nature but merely pursues ritual and music, one chases the branches and forgets the root, becoming fragmented by vulgar learning, and the world falls into chaos. Why? When knowledge and tranquility nurture one another, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music merge into the Dao and virtue. When knowledge and tranquility lose one another, the Dao and virtue branch into benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. This is the distinction between true and vulgar learning.

The ancients dwelled in primordial chaos, moving with their age and attaining serene indifference.

At that time, yin and yang harmonized in stillness, spirits remained undisturbed, the four seasons kept their proper rhythm, the myriad things suffered no harm, and all living beings met no untimely end. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called "perfect unity." At that time, none acted, yet all naturally followed their course.

When virtue declined, Sui Ren and Fu Xi first ruled the world, thus following the age yet failing to achieve unity. When virtue declined further, Shen Nong and the Yellow Emperor first ruled the world, thus bringing peace yet failing to follow the age. When virtue declined still further, Yao and Shun first ruled the world, initiating the flow of governance and transformation, where purity thinned and simplicity scattered. They departed from the Dao to pursue perilous virtue, acting through goodness. Then, they abandoned nature to follow the heart-mind. As heart-minds vied with one another in knowledge, it proved insufficient to stabilize the world. Thus, they adorned it with culture, expanded it with erudition, eroded authenticity, and drowned the heart-mind. Only then did the people begin to grow confused and disordered, unable to return to their original nature and recover their primal state.

The decline of virtue arose because sages did not succeed one another in rule. Those above could not practice non-action but instead coveted the traces of non-action, leading to such corruption. "Following yet not unified"—the world had already lost unity, and confusion could not be resolved, so they merely released it without further inquiry, following what was natural in its own place. "At peace yet not following"—they found peace in what was naturally peaceful. The sage has no fixed heart-mind but allows the world to achieve its own completion. Whether the age grows pure or thin is not the sage’s doing. The sage can only allow the world to attain its own nature—how could the sage make the world attain sageliness? Thus, the traces of emperors and kings shift with the age, yet the Dao of the sage has never been incomplete.

Goodness exceeds what is fitting in its praise, so though there is goodness, the Dao is not fully realized. Acting contrary to nature, one establishes conduct yet fails to level virtue. Abandoning nature to follow the heart-mind—speaking of the heart-mind as self-serving—is to lose nature. "Heart-minds vying with one another in knowledge" means that competing heart-minds strive to be first in recognition, leaving no room to follow nature. "Knowledge insufficient to stabilize the world" means that forgetting knowledge and following nature is what truly stabilizes. Culture and erudition are adornments of the heart-mind and essence, not the root of life and destiny.

From this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world—they mutually lose one another. How can the person of the Dao arise in the world? How can the world arise through the Dao? Though the Dao cannot arise in the world and the world cannot arise through the Dao, even if the sage does not dwell in mountain forests, their virtue remains hidden. Thus, the so-called "hidden scholars" of old did not conceal their bodies and remain unseen, nor did they shut their words and refuse to speak, nor did they hide their knowledge and refrain from expressing it. The great error lies in timing and destiny. When timing and destiny align and one acts greatly in the world, they return to unity without trace. When timing and destiny are greatly thwarted in the world, they deeply root themselves, secure their utmost foundation, and await—this is the way to preserve oneself.

The Dao endures in the world because it is not prized. Yet when the world endures, it prizes the Dao, and in prizing it, the Dao is lost. The Dao cannot prevent the world from prizing it, nor can the world avoid prizing the Dao—thus they mutually lose one another. If not prized, they would mutually arise. The reason they do not arise now is due to the emotions that stir them. How can they arise? Through the absence of prizing. If one does not hide oneself but instead employs things, the world and the Dao will mutually arise—what need is there for concealment?

Not knowing to return to unity to cease traces, yet chasing traces to seek unity, the more one obtains traces, the more one loses unity—this is the great error. Even if one rises in body to clarify it, opens words to express it, or displays knowledge to reveal it, how can they mutually arise? It only leads to mutual loss. When timing and destiny are greatly realized, this is the time of serene indifference—returning to unity without trace means returning to the nature of things, and the nature of things unifies itself, leaving no trace. When timing and destiny are greatly thwarted, this is a time that cannot achieve serene indifference. Yet even in an age of affairs, the sage has never failed to remain serene. Thus, they deeply root themselves, secure their utmost foundation, and await the world’s self-fulfillment—this is how the Dao is not lost. There has never been a case where the self is preserved yet the world does not arise.

When the world and the Dao mutually arise, sages appear and the myriad things behold them. When the world and the Dao mutually lose one another, sages wander amidst世俗 yet remain unknown—thus they are already hidden. Why seek concealment in mountain forests? Returning to unity without trace is like the dream of Huaxu or the wanderings of Guye. Deeply rooting and securing the utmost foundation is like the unshakable—hibernation of dragons and snakes to preserve the self is no different. Observing Zhuangzi’s words, one senses his lament over the misfortune of timing and destiny. When the world and the Dao mutually lose one another, it is indeed cause for sorrow.

The ancients who preserved their selves did not adorn themselves with clever disputation, nor did they exhaust the world with knowledge, nor did they endanger virtue by exhausting it with knowledge. Solemnly abiding in their proper place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do? The Dao is not diminished by petty conduct; virtue is not diminished by petty understanding. Petty understanding harms virtue; petty conduct harms the Dao. Thus it is said: rectify the self and that is all.

To be "joyfully whole" is what is meant by "attaining one’s aspiration." What the ancients called "attaining one’s aspiration" did not refer to carriages and caps of office. It meant that nothing could augment their joy. What is now called "attaining one’s aspiration" refers to carriages and caps of office. Yet carriages and caps are not one’s nature or destiny—they are transient things that come by chance, a temporary lodging. When they come, one cannot block them; when they depart, one cannot stop them. Thus, one does not indulge one’s aspirations for carriages and caps, nor does one follow worldly customs in poverty and constraint. Their joy is the same in both cases, and so they are simply without sorrow. Now, if the lodging departs and one is no longer joyful, then even in joy there has never been no dissipation. Thus it is said: those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to custom are called "the people of inverted priorities."

Guo’s commentary: Not adorning oneself with clever disputation is simply to follow one’s true knowledge. Not exhausting the world with knowledge—this is the sentiment of tranquility. Not exhausting virtue with knowledge is simply to guard one’s self-possession. *Weiran* describes the bearing of one who stands alone in correctness. The Dao is not diminished by petty conduct—it roams the level path. Virtue is not diminished by petty understanding—it is vast and all-pervading. One attains one’s aspiration, singularly at peace in heart without the emotions of sorrow or joy. This is the wholeness of joy. "Nothing can augment their joy" means being whole within and sufficient. Coming cannot be blocked; departing cannot be stopped—these are matters of external things. Gain and loss do not pertain to me. Indifferent and at ease, one does not sense the lodging in the self. Vast and self-possessed, one does not know poverty in the self. "Both" refers to carriages and caps and to poverty and constraint. "Simply without sorrow" means there is no joy of exultation either. If the lodging departs and one is no longer joyful, then when it comes, there is dissipation. This is to exchange the inner for the outer. When the outer is full and the inner is diminished, one’s priorities are inverted.

Lü’s commentary: To preserve the self is simply to be still; to act in the world is not merely to be still but must respond to change without harming stillness—this is acceptable. Forgetting words, knowledge becomes all-knowing; abandoning knowledge, virtue becomes all-pervading. Solemnly abiding in one’s proper place, one need not flee the world or separate from things, for worldly things are not enough to burden one—this is the Dao of acting in the world. The Dao is not diminished by petty conduct; virtue is not diminished by petty understanding. Not diminishing oneself to follow the world—this is what is meant by "rectifying the self." To be "joyfully whole" is to have nothing augment one’s joy, to aspire to the Dao and seek to attain it—this is what is called "attaining one’s aspiration." The Dao is one’s nature and destiny; carriages and caps are a lodging of things. Now, if one exchanges the joy of having nothing augment it for the departure of this lodging, one loses the self and forfeits one’s nature—this is to be one of "inverted priorities."

Master Guan’s general discussion: The main idea of this chapter is that people, lacking transcendent and unworldly insight, cling to worldly entanglements and gradually lose their original nature, polishing their natures and slipping into desire amid custom. Though they have not committed overt evils, they greatly obstruct the Dao. To augment it with external learning and confuse it with reckless thoughts, seeking to return to the beginning and attain clarity, is like heading north while driving toward Ying. The True Person, fearing that scholars would dread its emptiness and vastness, finding nothing to exert effort upon, set forth the theory of the mutual nourishment of tranquility and knowledge, making it easier for people to enter.

When one dwells in the world, responding to opportunities and adapting to change, one cannot forget knowledge. When knowledge is employed, it harms tranquility. The key lies in carefully weighing what is appropriate and abiding in the Dao. When affairs come, knowledge is manifest; when affairs depart, tranquility remains. Over time, as these two are harmonized and both are transformed, spirit and soul, hun and po, merge into supreme harmony, aligning with nature and destiny in the realm of the subtle and formless, returning to the root of virtue and the Dao. From this, expanding outward, one dwells among the people of the world, blending into the indistinct and attaining tranquility. Though one possesses knowledge, there is nothing to employ it for—such transformation is vast indeed.

Alas, governance has lost its purity and harmony; custom has turned toward frivolity and shallowness. Departing from the Dao and endangering virtue, authenticity is drowned and the heart submerged. When the world and the Dao mutually lose one another, they cannot be restored. Only then do the sages of mountain forests, deeply rooting and securing the utmost foundation, await their encounter, whether morning or night. Preserving the self is how the Dao is preserved. The coming and going of the lodging allow no room for joy or sorrow—how then could clever disputation be of use? Their joy is whole, their aspiration attained, transcending carriages and caps.

Those who covet the glory of carriages and caps merely suffer from not knowing how to seek it. This is the Dao by which the sagely and worthy dwell in obscurity to preserve themselves.

**Chapter Seventeen: Autumn Floods**

When the autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River. Its mighty currents swell so vast that between its banks and islets, oxen and horses cannot be distinguished. Thereupon, the River Lord rejoiced exultantly, believing all the world’s beauty to be contained within himself. Following the current eastward, he reached the Northern Sea. Turning to face the east, he saw no end to the waters. Thereupon, the River Lord turned his gaze, looked out across the expanse toward Ruo, and sighed:

“There is a common saying: ‘Having heard the Dao a hundred times, one believes none can compare to oneself.’ This describes me. Moreover, I once heard those who belittled Confucius’s learning and disparaged Boyi’s righteousness—at first, I did not believe it. Now, beholding the boundlessness of your realm, had I not come to your gate, I would have remained in peril, forever ridiculed by those of great understanding.”

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: “A frog in a well cannot speak of the sea, confined as it is by its narrow dwelling. A summer insect cannot speak of ice, bound as it is by its fleeting season. A scholar of limited learning cannot speak of the Dao, constrained as he is by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and beheld the great sea, you recognize your own insignificance—only then can you be spoken with about great principles.

Of all the waters under heaven, none are greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers flow into it, yet it never fills, no matter when they cease. The Tail Pool drains it, yet it never empties, no matter when it ends. Unchanged by spring or autumn, unmoved by flood or drought—this surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River, which cannot be measured in number. Yet I have never prided myself on this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive my qi from yin and yang. Within heaven and earth, I am but a pebble or a twig in a great mountain. Even if I were to consider myself small, how could I take pride in it? Measure the Four Seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a tiny crevice in a vast marsh? Measure the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary?

The number of things is called ‘ten thousand,’ yet humans occupy but one among them. The people of the Nine Provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carriages travel, are but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, are they not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body? The Five Emperors’ succession, the Three Kings’ strife, the benevolent’s worries, the devoted officials’ labors—all are encompassed in this. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition—this was their self-aggrandizement. Are they not like your former pride in your waters?

The River Lord said: “Then may I consider heaven and earth great and the tip of a hair small?”

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: “No. The measure of things is boundless, time knows no end, divisions are not constant, and beginnings and ends have no fixed origin. Thus, the one of great wisdom observes both near and far—small without paucity, great without excess—knowing that measure is infinite. Verifying past and present, he is at ease in remoteness and untroubled in proximity, unhurried in grasping and unstrained in reaching. Knowing time has no end, he examines its flow.”

The fluctuations of fullness and emptiness—thus one gains without delight and loses without sorrow, knowing that divisions are not constant. Clearly perceiving the level path, one lives without elation and dies without calamity, knowing that beginnings and ends have no fixed origin. Calculating what a person knows does not compare to what he does not know; the time of his life does not compare to the time before his birth. To seek the exhaustion of the greatest realm through what is most minute—this is why one becomes confused and cannot attain self-realization.

From this perspective, how can the tip of a hair suffice to determine the limit of the most subtle? And how can heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the realm of the greatest? Guo’s commentary: *"The measure of things is boundless"*—each thing has its own measure. *"Time knows no end"*—death and life are both the movement of time. *"Divisions are not constant"*—gain and loss are both divisions. *"Beginnings and ends have no fixed origin"*—each day is new. *"Small without paucity, great without excess"*—each is self-sufficient and without surplus. *"Knowing measure is infinite"*—by grasping and observing, one knows that things near and far, great and small, each have their measure. *"Verifying past and present"*—*xiang* means "illumination"; *gu* means "past and present." *"Remote"* means "distant"; *duo* means "near." *"Knowing time has no end"*—by verifying past and present, one knows that transformations do not cease with death and life, thus one is not troubled by length nor strained by brevity. Observing the alternation of fullness and emptiness, one knows that divisions are not constant in gain—thus one can forget sorrow and joy. *"Clearly perceiving"*...

The unobstructed Way speaks of death and life as the ever-renewing proper Dao. When the renewal of beginnings and ends is made clear, one knows that the old cannot be clung to or retained. Thus, one traverses the new without alarm and relinquishes the old without surprise—death and life’s transformations are as one. What one knows has its limits; each life has its allotted years. Better to rest content with the portion one has received. To seek the great with the small is ultimately futile. When each abides in its own portion, small and great are both sufficient.

If the tip of an autumn hair does not seek the workings of heaven and earth, then all the surplus of the body’s circumference becomes discarded matter. If heaven and earth are not seen as greater than an autumn hair, then merely regarding one’s form and appearance is self-sufficient. How, then, can one know the definiteness of the fine or the definiteness of the great?

Lü’s Commentary:
The Dao is neither small nor great—how could it have a fixed form? Now, heaven and earth I deem the utmost in greatness, yet what I know of them cannot be exhausted. Thus, what I call great—is it truly great? What I call small—is it truly small? Small is not paucity; great is not excess. This is to know that measure is infinite.

What I took as past is past, what I take as present is present. Before one speaks, the present has already become past. Thus, what is called past and present—how can they have an end? Verifying that past and present are both old, one is distant yet not troubled, brief yet not strained. This is to know that time has no end.

How can I fret and wait for a hundred years’ reign? That is to be distant and troubled. Pengzu was renowned for his longevity, yet when the common people compare themselves to him, they are brief and strained.

At noon the sun declines; when the moon is full, it wanes. Observing the alternation of fullness and emptiness, one gains yet does not rejoice, loses yet does not sorrow—knowing that divisions are not constant.

There is a beginning, then there must be an end; there is an end, then there must be a beginning. Tracing the beginning to its end, one understands that the unobstructed Way is such that life brings no joy, death brings no calamity—knowing that beginnings and ends cannot be clung to. Thus, what things call time, divisions, beginnings, and ends—are they truly known? To know yet not truly know is to know that what is known is surely not as good as what is unknown.

To live is to have knowledge; before birth, there is no knowledge. Thus, the time of one’s life is surely not as good as the time before one’s birth. Knowledge is the smallest; the infinite is the greatest. To seek the realm of the infinitely great with the smallest is to become lost and self-defeated.

Guan’s Observations:
If one can know that the measures of things, their times, and their divisions are not constant, then what need is there to examine beginnings and ends, small and great, much and little? When the impermanence of past and present is made clear, this principle becomes evident.

*Yao* means the duration of time; *duo* means the swiftness of change. Not being troubled means no weariness with one’s life; not being strained means no seeking to augment one’s life. Lifespan is fixed—one abides in it and that is all. People cannot but be born, cannot but have knowledge. Yet the sutra says, “Better not to know; better not to have been born.” This is because worldly people do not pursue true knowledge but seek delusive knowledge; they do not pursue the wholeness of life but seek to augment life. With the limited they chase the infinite, forgetting their inherent portion while coveting what lies beyond. With the harm and benefit that lie within themselves, they cannot see clearly—how then can they determine the boundaries of things, the fine and the great?

Better not to know—Wang Ni’s response to Nie Que’s question is an example. Better not to have been born—the skull’s unwillingness to return to the toils of the human world is another. Yet one is already born, already knows. How, then, can one free oneself? By taking non-birth as birth and non-knowledge as knowledge—then what burden is life? What possession is knowledge?

He Bo said: “Those who discuss the world all say that the most refined is formless, the greatest cannot be encompassed—is this a true reflection of reality?”

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: “From the fine one views the great—it is not fully seen; from the great one views the fine—it is not clearly perceived. The subtlety of the refined and small, the vastness of the great and abundant—these are the advantages of their respective conditions.

The refined and coarse are expected to have form. What is formless cannot be divided by numbers; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by numbers. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be conveyed by intention is the refined aspect of things. What cannot be discussed in words, what cannot be examined or conveyed by intention, does not depend on refinement or coarseness.

Thus, the conduct of the great person does not depart from harming others, yet does not overvalue benevolence and kindness. In action, they are not for profit, nor do they despise gatekeepers and servants. They do not contend over goods and wealth, nor do they overvalue deference and yielding in affairs. They do not borrow from others, nor do they eat excessively through force. They do not despise the greedy and corrupt, and their conduct differs from the common, yet they do not overvalue being unconventional. They follow the crowd yet do not despise flatterers and sycophants. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them; punishments and shame are insufficient to humiliate them. They know that right and wrong cannot be divided, that the fine and the great cannot be demarcated.”

It is said: “The Dao-person does not hear; the utmost virtue is not attained; the great person has no self.” This is the ultimate in abiding by one’s portion.

---

Guo’s Commentary:
The eye’s vision has a constant limit and cannot be without bounds. Thus, in regard to the great, there is what it cannot fully see; in regard to the fine, there is what it cannot clearly perceive. This is simply what the eye cannot reach. The refined and the great are not nonexistent—how could one know that what is formless and cannot be encompassed is so?

Great and small differ, so their advantages cannot be the same. If something is formless and cannot be encompassed, then it has no such differing advantages. There is refinement and coarseness—thus there cannot be formlessness. Only when there is nothing at all—then what refinement or coarseness could there be?

Words and intentions are something, yet what they express and intend is nothing. Thus, to seek beyond words and intentions is to enter the realm of no-words and no-intentions—only then does one reach the ultimate.

The great person has no intentions and follows the natural course. With every step, they tread on auspicious ground—how could they take the path of harming others? Without harm, they do not overvalue their kindness. In action, they do not act for profit—they respond to principle, and principle itself is without harm.

They do not despise gatekeepers and servants—they assign positions according to ability, and each is fittingly placed. It is not that they despise them and thus assign them to such posts. They do not contend over goods and wealth—each is made to abide by their fixed portion.

They do not overvalue deference and yielding—they act appropriately and that is all. They do not borrow from others—each is made to rely on themselves. They do not eat excessively—their strength is sufficient and that is all. They do not despise the greedy and corrupt—principle itself is without desire.

Their conduct differs from the common, yet they alone have no fixed preferences—thus they differ from the common. They do not overvalue being unconventional—they follow principle and naturally differ. They act in accord with the crowd yet do not despise flatterers and sycophants—they follow what the crowd does and are naturally upright.

Ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them; punishments and shame are insufficient to humiliate them—external matters do not lodge in their hearts. Knowing that right and wrong, the fine and the great, cannot be divided, they merge with the mysterious. They let things be, and the natures of things communicate of themselves—thus merit and fame return to things.

Thus the Daoist does not hear of "gain"—what is called gain arises from loss. When things each have no loss, the name of "gain" departs. Therefore, the utmost virtue does not "attain"—the great person simply allows things to be, and thus has no self. To reach the utmost of one’s allotted portion is to restrain oneself to that portion—thus it is a guard.

Only that which is boundless, formless, and cannot be encompassed is truly so.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
When one views the great from the perspective of the small, the eye’s power does not reach it—this is merely a failure to exhaust it, not that it cannot be encompassed. When one views the small from the perspective of the great, the midge perched on a mosquito’s eyelash is unseen—this is merely a failure of clarity, not that it is formless. The coarse and the fine are manifest in form; the formless is a matter of calculation that cannot be divided; the unencompassable is a matter of calculation that cannot be exhausted. What can be spoken of belongs to the coarse of things; what can be grasped by intention belongs to the fine of things. The Dao, however, transcends both speech and intention—it does not await the fine or the coarse.

Thus the conduct of the great person does not depart from harming the nature of others—yet they do not overvalue benevolence and kindness, for these are not deliberate acts. The gatekeeper acts for profit; the deferential do not contend. They eat by their own strength and do not rely on others. The greedy and corrupt are the opposite. Those who affect eccentricity make it their business to differ from the common; the sycophantic follow their lord or kin rather than the crowd. All this arises from nature. The world’s ranks, emoluments, punishments, and shames are insufficient to encourage or restrain them.

How could they know the divisions of right and wrong or the distinctions of fine and great? One who can restrain themselves to the utmost of their allotted portion, reaching the point where nothing is divided—this is why the Daoist does not hear of it, why the utmost virtue does not "attain," and why the great person has no self.

**Detailed Explanation of the Dao:**
The great person, in relation to the world, forgets things with the mind and forgets the mind with the Dao. They do not depart from harming others—yet one might suspect they overvalue benevolence and kindness, but they do not. They do not contend over wealth—yet one might suspect they overvalue deference, but they do not. They do not rely on others for tasks or consume more than their strength allows—yet one might suspect they despise the greedy and corrupt, but they do not. Their conduct differs from the common—yet one might suspect they overvalue eccentricity, but they do not. They do not despise gatekeepers to exalt themselves, nor do they despise the greedy and corrupt to purify themselves, nor do they despise sycophants to prove their uprightness.

Thus, ranks and punishments do not disturb their inner being; right and wrong, fine and great, are not worth distinguishing externally. Then what room is there in the heart for the coarse and fine that lie in speech and intention? Therefore, to hear is not truly to hear; to gain is to have nothing attained. Reaching the point of having no self, "I" am lost—how then could there be things? Without restraining oneself to one’s allotted portion and reaching its utmost, one is not equal to this.

**Personal Insight:**
When one views the great from the perspective of the small, it ends in failure to exhaust it—yet the great does not end there. When one views the small from the perspective of the great, it ends in failure of clarity—yet the small is not formless. The fine is the utmost of the small; the vast is the fullness of the great. Though small and great differ, both have form and number, and thus are subject to formation and decay. When the fine reaches the formless and the great reaches the unencompassable, they are not fixed by form nor divided by number—thus they are free from formation and decay.

The coarse of things can be spoken of; the fine can be grasped by intention. That which transcends the coarse and fine cannot be reached by speech or intention. What cannot be reached by speech or intention, nor divided by form or number—is this not the Dao? Thus the great person takes benefiting things as their priority yet does not overvalue benevolence and kindness. They are not moved by profit yet do not despise those who pursue it—all this describes the conduct of the great person, which differs from the common. Even sycophancy is not despised, allowing the noble and the base to follow their own paths. Right and wrong, fine and great, are not worth distinguishing—then how could ranks, punishments, encouragements, or restraints be of any use?

**He Bo said:** Where is the boundary between the outer and inner of things? Where is the distinction between noble and base? Where is the distinction between small and great?

**The Lord of the Northern Sea said:** From the perspective of the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness. From the perspective of things, each exalts itself and despises others. From the perspective of the common, nobility and baseness do not lie in oneself. From the perspective of difference, if you take what is great in something and make it great, then nothing is not great; if you take what is small in something and make it small, then nothing is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, and that the tip of a hair is a mountain—then the distinctions of difference are seen.

From the perspective of function, if you take what something has and affirm its having, then nothing does not have; if you take what something lacks and affirm its lacking, then nothing does not lack. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other—then the divisions of function are fixed. From the perspective of tendencies, if you affirm what something affirms, then nothing is not affirmed; if you negate what something negates, then nothing is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed themselves and negated the other—then the tendencies of conduct are seen.

In ancient times, Yao and Shun yielded and became emperors; Kuai yielded and was destroyed. Tang and Wu contended and became kings; Bai Gong contended and was annihilated. From this, we see that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, have their times—nothing can be taken as constant.

Thus, when we follow a thing’s nature and deem it sufficient to name it great, then the finest hair-tip and the towering mountain share the same name; when we follow its lack of excess and call it small, then heaven-and-earth and the tiniest grain of millet share the same designation. But if one observes differences without proceeding by this Dao, then differences accumulate, infinitesimal inclinations tilt, and distinctions become impossible to fathom.

All under heaven take each other as “that” and “this,” and both “that” and “this” wish to act for themselves—hence the opposition of east and west. Yet “that” and “this” together form lips and teeth: lips and teeth never act for each other, yet when the lips perish, the teeth grow cold. Thus, “that” acting for itself accomplishes my benefit—this is the way of opposition that cannot do without each other. Therefore, if we follow their self-directed action yet deny its merit, then all merit under heaven is denied; if we recognize their mutual indispensability and affirm its merit, then all merit under heaven is affirmed.

Now, if one forgets the merit of self-directed action and instead dwells on the kindness of acting for others, the more diligently one bestows kindness, the thinner it grows, and the more the world loses its proper work while human nature overflows in chaos. Thus, the apportionment of merit can never be fixed.

All things are so of themselves, hence nothing is not so; all things oppose each other, hence nothing is not opposed. Where nothing is not opposed, nothing is so; where nothing is not so, nothing is opposed. One who is neither so nor opposed is Yao; one who is both so and opposed is Jie. Yet these two rulers each received their natural endowment from heaven and could not act for each other. Thus, observing Yao and Jie reveals the tendencies of all under heaven: their inability to act for each other is manifest.

Those who receive all under heaven by responding to heaven and aligning with the people—on the surface, their traces are the traces of contention and yielding. Yet those who trace their traces miss the source of those traces, and so perish.

The Lü commentary states:
Viewing things through the Dao, how can there be noble and base? Viewing them through things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base—but the Dao is not a thing. Viewing them through custom, noble and base lie not in oneself—but the Dao is not custom. Since the Dao is neither thing nor custom, it is neither noble nor base. Magnify what is deemed great, diminish what is deemed small; know that heaven and earth differ from the Great Void, that a grain of millet or a hair’s tip differs from the formless, and that hills and mountains differ from the imperceptible—then the measure of such differences becomes clear. Yet the Dao is not difference, and thus not great or small.

Affirm what is affirmed, negate what is negated; know that east must have west, that without east there is no west, that Yao and Jie each arose from self-affirmation and mutual negation—then the tendencies of all become manifest. Yet the Dao is not tendency, and thus not affirmation or negation. If this is so, then one who embodies the Dao forgets both sides and rests in equilibrium. How could the Heavenly Equality trouble itself with distinctions of noble and base, great and small?

If Yao and Shun’s yielding is deemed right, then Zihuai perished by yielding; if Tang and Wu’s contention is deemed right, then the Duke of Bai perished by contending. The rites of yielding and contending, the conduct of Yao and Jie—noble and base shift with the times and cannot be taken as constant.

A roof beam can batter down a city wall yet cannot plug a mouse-hole—this speaks of differing implements. The swift steed Qiji or Hua-liu gallops a thousand li in a day yet cannot catch a mouse—this speaks of differing skills. The owl snatches fleas at night, discerning the finest hairs, yet by day stares blindly and sees not hills or mountains—this speaks of differing natures. Thus it is said: He who takes right as his teacher yet admits no wrong, takes order as his teacher yet admits no chaos, has not yet understood the principles of heaven and earth or the conditions of the myriad things. This is like taking heaven as teacher yet excluding earth, taking yin as teacher yet excluding yang—its impossibility is manifest. Yet those who cling to such speech without ceasing are either fools or deceivers.

The succession of emperors and kings differs; the inheritance of the Three Dynasties differs. Those who defy their times and customs are called usurpers; those who accord with their times and customs are called righteous. How silently flows the River Earl! How could a woman know the gate of noble and base, the house of great and small?

Guo’s commentary states:
Following their differences and letting each take its course, nothing among the myriad things is misplaced. The principles of heaven and earth and the conditions of the myriad things deem attaining me as right and losing me as wrong, fitting nature as order and losing harmony as chaos. Different natures and distinct capacities give rise to right and wrong without fixed standard. If one takes one’s own right as absolute, then others cannot but be wrong—this is knowing oneself yet not seeing others. Thus, viewing through the Dao, right and wrong have no fixed place. Entrusting all to the Heavenly Equality and letting both sides proceed freely, then differing directions and distinct paths all attain their due. Heaven and earth, yin and yang, give rise to each other; right and wrong, order and chaos, intermingle. What is there to discard?

What custom deems noble may later be deemed base; what things deem great one age may deem small another. Thus, following the traces of things cannot but lead to differences—this is why the Five Emperors and Three Kings differed. The Lü commentary states: A roof beam cannot plug a mouse-hole; a swift steed cannot catch a mouse; an owl cannot see by day—these three differ, yet to seek to equalize them is to fail to understand the principles of heaven and the conditions of things. To speak only of singular right or only of plural paths...

A humble observation:
Different implements have different uses, different skills have different capacities, different natures have different conveniences—they cannot be judged by a single standard. To take order as teacher yet admit no chaos, to take yin as teacher yet admit no yang, is not to understand the principles of heaven and earth and the myriad things. Abdication and succession, compliance and defiance, each follows its time—there is no need for much speech. Even if one speaks, it only addresses traces. How could one know the origin of noble and base, great and small? To know the origin of noble and base, great and small, one must seek it where things have not yet begun.

The River Earl said: Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I decide my acceptance or rejection, my pursuit or abandonment? What will become of me in the end?

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: Viewing through the Dao, what is noble? What is base? This is called "reversal and return," free from constraint, where will and Dao are greatly at odds. What is few? What is many? This is called "alternation and application," free from singularity, where conduct and Dao are out of step. How solemn! A state with a ruler has no private virtue—how reverent! A sacrifice with an altar has no private blessing—how boundless! Like the four directions without limit, without boundaries, embracing the myriad things—who bears and who assists? This is called "without direction." The myriad things are one in equality—who is short? Who is long?

The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and birth. Not relying on their completion, now empty, now full, they do not settle in their forms. Years cannot be lifted, time cannot be halted. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness, end and then begin—this is how one speaks of the great meaning’s direction, discusses the principles of the myriad things.

Things’ arising is like galloping, like racing—no movement without change, no moment without shift. What should one do? What should one not do? They will of course transform themselves.

Guo’s commentary states:
"Reversal and return" refers to the way of noble and base, which turns and repeats endlessly. Self-constraint leads to disharmony with the Dao; following one’s portion means application is without constancy. "Out of step with the Dao" means inability to follow change, hence not equal to the Dao. "No private virtue" means impartiality alone. "No private blessing" means what all under heaven seek together. "Without boundaries" means boundless, without fixed place. "Embracing the myriad things, who bears and who assists?" speaks of encompassing and guiding all beings, returning them to their proper portions and balancing their comings and goings. How could one support the distant and assist the near?

Only by being without direction can one take the myriad things as direction, and both long and short be sufficient. Life and death are but endless transformations—not true end or beginning. Not relying on their completion means completion has no constant abode. "Not settling in their forms" means forms do not take form as their position and guard it without change. "Years cannot be lifted" means wishing to lift them and make them depart, yet being unable. "Time cannot be halted" means wishing to halt it and make it stop, yet being unable. "Fullness and emptiness, end and beginning" means daily renewal of transformation, never abiding.

"Like galloping, like racing"—one should simply follow their use, for there is no change without shift, nothing to grasp and hold. What should one do? What should one not do? They will of course transform themselves.

If one intervenes with action or inaction amidst these transformations, one disrupts their natural course.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Scholars ordinarily remain entangled in things. Upon hearing the Dao’s teaching that nothing is noble or base, they become confused in matters of action and inaction, acceptance and rejection, not knowing where to turn—rightly so.

What is called noble or base is merely the reversal of things, not the Dao. Reversal entails departure and return: returning is noble, departing is base. Broadness entails depletion: depletion is noble, broadness is base. One should let the mind roam freely without constraint, for if one clings to purpose, one becomes greatly obstructed and cannot align with the Dao.

What is called few or many is merely the exchange and bestowal of things, not the Dao. Exchange entails flourishing and withering: withering is few, flourishing is many. Bestowal entails gathering and dispersing: dispersing is many, gathering is few. One should proceed with both without favoring one over the other, for if one acts singularly, one falls out of step with the Dao.

"Without private virtue" means not relying solely on the ruler one serves—this is what it means to have no constraint in purpose. "Without private blessing" means not bestowing favor solely upon those one sacrifices to—this is what it means to proceed without singularity. "Without boundaries" means being in accord with the Dao and not greatly obstructed.

Who, then, bears and assists? This is called having no fixed direction, treating all things as equal, and aligning with the Dao without discord. Relying on their completion means not understanding that end and beginning cannot be grasped; settling in form means not perceiving that fullness and emptiness have no constancy. "Years cannot be lifted," so one remains at ease without vexation; "time cannot be halted," so one acts without strain. The waxing and waning of fullness and emptiness, the end and the beginning—these are but the movements of Heaven. This is how one speaks of the Dao’s boundlessness and discusses the principles of all things. Why, then, entangle the mind in matters of acceptance and rejection?

"Like galloping, like racing"—if transformations shift imperceptibly, why fix the mind on action or inaction? They will of course transform themselves, proceeding without need for arrangement. This is what it means to let things transform naturally.

**Detailed Explanation of the Dao:**
"Broadness" refers to level ground; reversal restores it to a slope. The distinction between level and sloped has no fixed norm—how is the alternation of noble and base any different?

Bestowal is the function of benevolence; exchange is giving without clinging to benevolence. How can one calculate the tally of many or few? In reversal, one forgets noble and base and is not burdened by reputation; in exchange, one forgets many and few and is not bound by profit. If one does not thus return to the true, it has never been achieved.

**Bi Xu’s Annotation:**
Noble and base have no fixed master but flow in constant alternation—this is the norm. The great Dao is utterly smooth, and the mind roams freely in accord—this is alignment. One’s allotment is determined by fate, and the few exchange while the many bestow—this is fitting. The ways of the world are uneven, and one’s conduct adapts to change—this is principle.

If virtue is private, it lacks sternness; if blessing is private, it does not endure. If boundaries exist, it is not all-pervading. Having a fixed direction entails bearing and assisting, but if one clings to such support, the virtue of embracing all things is lost.

Forget the self, and there is no long or short; forget the mind, and there is no life or death; forget position, and there is no fullness or emptiness; forget years, and one follows transformation; forget time, and one follows change; forget the waxing and waning of fullness and emptiness, and who then determines end and beginning?

Things are never not born, never not transformed—their changes are like galloping, their shifts like racing. They are but yin and yang, the four seasons. They will of course transform themselves; why concern the mind with action or inaction?

The River Earl said, "If so, then what is the value of the Dao?"
The Lord of the Northern Sea replied, "One who knows the Dao necessarily grasps principle; one who grasps principle necessarily understands adaptability; one who understands adaptability does not let things harm the self. The one of utmost virtue cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or injured by birds or beasts. This is not to say one belittles them, but rather that one discerns safety and danger, finds peace in fortune and misfortune, and is cautious in approach and retreat—nothing can harm them.

Thus it is said: Heaven is within, humans are without; virtue resides in Heaven. To know the conduct of Heaven and humans is to take Heaven as fundamental. Abiding in attainment, one flexes and extends, returns to the essential, and speaks of the ultimate, saying: What is Heaven? What is human?

The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: 'Oxen and horses having four legs is called Heaven; placing a halter on a horse’s head or a ring through an ox’s nose is called human.' Thus it is said: Do not let the human obliterate Heaven; do not let the artificial obliterate fate; do not pursue fame at the expense of attainment. Guard this carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to the true."

**Guo’s Annotation:**
What is the value of the Dao? It lies in its self-transformation. One who knows the Dao knows their own inability. Inability—

Then how could anything else give me life? I am self-generated. And yet my four limbs, hundred parts, five viscera, and spirit—none act, yet all form of themselves. What further intention could there be after life and completion?

One who grasps this principle must be able to dismiss excessive knowledge, relinquish the emotions that seek to prolong life, and ride change while responding to contingency. Thus, one is not harmed within by what is without, nor injured by things, and so remains whole. Therefore, what the heart finds at peace cannot be endangered by danger; where intention finds nothing unsuitable, suffering cannot cause suffering.

This is not to say one should treat such things lightly—even what the heart finds at peace should not be allowed to encroach. Discerning safety and peril, one knows they cannot be escaped; abiding in fortune and misfortune, one rests in what fate encounters. Carefully weighing departure and approach, one examines what is not one’s own—thus, nothing can be taken as harm, and so nothing can harm.

That the Heavenly is within and the human without means the natural resides within, while what follows the natural resides without. Thus, the *Great Master* says: "One who knows what Heaven and humans do has attained the ultimate." Clarifying the division of inner and outer, one sees that neither acts. Virtue resides in Heaven—let humans follow their nature, and knowledge will flow unrestrained, losing its original purity. The knowledge of the natural acts on its own and does not exceed its allotted portion. Therefore, though it moves in the external, it always takes the Heavenly as its root. Abiding in attainment—this is it.

The pacing and flexing of steps—these words speak of responding to opportunities as they arise, giving rise to such changes. To return to essentials and speak of ultimates is to know that though knowledge may span heaven and earth, and affairs may touch the myriad things, one never loses sight of the essential and the ultimate. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and humans remains whole.

In human life, can one not harness oxen and ride horses? And in harnessing oxen and riding horses, can one not bridle and rein them? That oxen and horses do not refuse bridles and reins is because it is the fixed mandate of Heaven. If it accords with the Heavenly mandate, then though it may be entrusted to human affairs, its root remains in Heaven. Yet if one overworks them beyond measure, drives them out of step, and loses rhythm, then the Heavenly principle is extinguished. Where lies the mandate if one does not follow their natural actions but instead forces them? What one attains has a constant allotment; to pursue fame is to exceed it. Returning to one’s true nature—truth resides within the bounds of one’s inherent nature.

---
**Lü’s Commentary:**
Allowing things to transform of themselves—this is the Dao. The River Earl did not awaken, so he asked what was noble about the Dao. Sea If explained that understanding principles and discerning expedients, not allowing things to harm oneself—these are the affairs of one who knows the Dao, but not the ultimate attainment of embodying the Dao. As for being unharmed by water or fire, unassailed by cold or heat—this is how one who embodies the Dao is by nature. It is not that one belittles them.

To examine safety and danger, to be cautious in departure and approach, so that nothing can harm—this is to know the Dao, understand principles, and discern expedients. To be at peace with fortune and misfortune, knowing they cannot be helped and accepting them—this is the Heavenly within. To examine departure and approach is to know that what humans fear cannot but be feared—this is the human without. Through this, one enters virtue. Though one may not yet be Heavenly and not human, virtue resides in Heaven.

To know the actions of Heaven and humans is rooted in the Heavenly position. In attainment, one emerges from Heaven and turns toward the human; in pacing and flexing, in returning to essentials and speaking of ultimates, one moves from the human back to Heaven. From "not using the human to extinguish the Heavenly" to this—this is called returning to one’s true nature. In this, how could one’s relation to the Dao be merely a matter of knowing it?

Here the limited view—from the opening of this chapter to this point, six questions and answers unfold like wind driving distant waves, gradually nearing and surging until, at this moment, snow-white breakers spray forth, overwhelming the senses. In an instant, all settles, and the water’s gleam stretches boundless, a single azure embracing heaven and humanity. The breath of falsehood returns to truth; within the empty, still center, something profound stirs.

The man of utmost virtue, proceeding from the human to illuminate the Heavenly, employing adaptability to grasp principle, examining safety and danger, carefully weighing departure and approach—what thing could harm him? Yet he never relies on this to lord over others. The Heavenly within establishes his essence; the human without serves his function. Virtue residing in Heaven unites with the spirit, boundless and unfathomable. Abiding in Heavenly essence and dwelling in virtue, he bends and extends with the world; returning to essentials and speaking of ultimates, he never loses his true nature. Thus, the Way of conducting oneself and others is complete.

Hence, the River Lord’s mind was guarded, his understanding deepened, and he asked no further questions.

The single-footed *kuí* pitied the centipede: “I stride with one foot—you have no such ease. Now you command ten thousand feet—how do you manage?”
The centipede replied, “Not so. Have you not seen one who spits? When he sprays, the large droplets are like pearls, the small like mist, and those scattering downward are beyond counting. Now I move by Heavenly mechanism, yet I know not how it is so.”

The centipede said to the snake, “I walk with many feet, yet I do not match you, who have none. Why?”
The snake said, “How can the movement of the Heavenly mechanism be altered? What use have I for feet?”

The snake said to the wind, “I move by flexing my spine and ribs—there is something to it. Now you rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and rush into the Southern Sea, yet seem as if you were nothing. Why?”
The wind said, “Indeed, I rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea. Yet if one points a finger at me, I am overcome; if one blocks me, I am also overcome. Nevertheless, to snap great trees and topple vast halls—only I can do this. Thus, to turn many small defeats into a great victory—only the sage can achieve this.”

Sima [Biao] says: The *kuí* has one foot; the centipede, many; the snake, none; the wind, no form. The eye has form here but sees there; the mind, being formless, reaches everywhere without hindrance.

Guo [Xiang]’s commentary: When things are born, they do not know they are being born, and thus their living is not a matter of knowing how to live. How, then, could their walking be a matter of knowing how to walk? Thus, the feet do not know how they walk, the eyes do not know how they see, the mind does not know how it knows—yet all move forward of themselves, at ease. The rhythms of slowness and speed, the discernment of keen and dull—some can do these, some cannot, but none of it is “me.” Yet some, desiring to possess their bodies and pride themselves on their abilities, go against the Heavenly mechanism and harm the vessel of the spirit. The utmost person knows the Heavenly mechanism cannot be altered, so he discards keen hearing and sharp sight, abandons knowledge and planning, and in utter forgetfulness, lets things move of themselves. Thus, there is no movement that is not free and unfettered. When the Heavenly mechanism is allowed to flow without contention, even small defeats are overcome. Yet when one rides the myriad things, guiding the multitude of talents, letting each talent find its own way and each thing act of itself, then nothing in the world is not free and unfettered—this is how the sage achieves great victory.

Lü [Huiqing]’s commentary: The *kuí*, with one foot, pities the centipede’s many feet; the centipede, with many feet, pities the snake’s lack of feet; the snake, moving by flexing its spine and ribs, pities the wind, which rises in a great rush from the Northern Sea and enters the Southern Sea. Thus, the eye, bound to one place, sees another, while the mind, seeing nothing, reaches everywhere without hindrance—this is evident. The *kuí* finds one foot easy and pities the centipede’s many feet as difficult; the centipede finds many feet easy and pities the snake’s lack of feet as difficult. Yet when the Heavenly mechanism moves, none knows how it is so—how then can difficulty or ease lie in having many or few, having or lacking? From this, we know that wind, eye, and mind all arise from spontaneity. How could the River Lord’s petty calculations of high and low, few and many compare to this? The wind turns small defeats into great victory, yet the human eye and mind, whose spirit far surpasses the wind, cannot attain what is called “seeing without seeing, knowing without knowing,” and thus cannot master the great victory over the myriad things. Is this true knowledge?

Detailed Dao: To rely on feet is to find one foot inferior to ten thousand, so the *kuí* pities the centipede. To be burdened by feet is to find ten thousand inferior to none, so the centipede pities the snake. The snake has something, yet seeing nothing as insufficient, it pities the wind. The wind rushes forth—yet finding having direction inadequate, it pities the eye. The eye merely governs sight, while the mind governs all, so it is said to be pitied.

Confucius was traveling in Kuang when men of Song surrounded him in several layers, yet he continued singing without pause. Zilu entered and asked, “How can you be so joyful, Master?”
Confucius said, “Come, let me tell you. I have long avoided adversity, yet I cannot escape fate. I have long sought success, yet I have not attained it.”

Yet I have not met with the right time. Had I lived in the age of Yao and Shun, the world would have known no destitute men—not through any wisdom of mine in attaining success. Had I lived in the age of Jie and Zhou, the world would have known no flourishing men—not through any failure of wisdom on my part. Such is the way of time and circumstance.

He who travels by water without avoiding dragons and serpents displays the courage of a fisherman. He who travels by land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers displays the courage of a hunter. He who faces flashing blades and regards death as life displays the courage of a warrior. He who knows that adversity is bound to fate, that success comes in its proper time, and stands before great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage.

You may rest now. My fate is governed by forces beyond me.

Shortly after, an armored officer approached and said, “We mistook you for Yang Hu, hence the siege. Now that we know otherwise, we beg leave to withdraw.”

Sima Biao notes: “Song” should read “Wei”; Kuang was a town in Wei.
Guo Xiang comments: To clarify the unyielding nature of time and fate, the text illustrates it through the attempt to avoid adversity. “Such is the way of time and circumstance” means one should not weary the mind over success or failure. The courage of the fisherman, hunter, and warrior each finds comfort in its own domain; the sage finds comfort in all. Knowing fate is not within one’s control, one need not trouble the heart. He who is at peace with fate finds freedom wherever he goes—thus, being besieged in Kuang or imprisoned in Youli is no different from resting in the Purple Ultimate Hall.

Bi Xu comments: When Confucius traveled in Kuang and was surrounded by men of Song, it was said that all defenses were overcome—yet when they realized their mistake and withdrew, this was called the “great victory.”

Gongsun Long asked Wei Mou, “In my youth, I studied the Master’s Way. In maturity, I came to understand the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness, affirmed the not-so, denied the not-not, confounded the wisdom of the Hundred Schools, and silenced the eloquence of all disputants. I thought myself perfectly enlightened—yet now I hear the words of Zhuangzi and feel lost, as if adrift. I cannot debate them, nor do I grasp them. I cannot even open my mouth to ask. May I inquire into the method?”

Prince Mou of Wei sighed deeply, looked up to the sky, and laughed, “Have you never heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea, ‘How joyful I am! I leap and prance upon the well’s railing, rest in the broken bricks of its walls. When I plunge into the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin. When I trample the mud, it covers my feet and ankles. I look around at the shrimp, crabs, and tadpoles—none can compare to me! Moreover, to command the water of a single ravine and stand astride the joy of a shallow well—this is perfection. Why not come in and see for yourself?’

The turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet placed its left foot in the well when its right knee was already stuck. It withdrew, stepped back, and told the frog of the sea: ‘A distance of a thousand *li* cannot convey its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* cannot measure its depth. In the time of Yu, floods lasted nine years out of ten, yet the sea did not swell. In the time of Tang, droughts lasted seven years out of eight, yet its shores did not recede. Not to be moved by the passage of time, nor altered by the increase or decrease of water—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.’

At this, the frog in the shallow well was stunned, dismayed, and utterly at a loss. Now, you who do not even know the bounds of right and wrong yet wish to examine Zhuangzi’s words—this is like a mosquito trying to carry a mountain or a centipede racing across a river. It is beyond your strength. And you who do not comprehend the subtleties of his discourse yet seek only momentary advantage—are you not like the frog in the shallow well?

Moreover, he treads upon the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Emperor, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, lost in the unfathomable. Unconfined by east or west, he begins in the darkest mystery and returns to the great thoroughfare. Yet you seek to measure him with narrow vision, to grasp him with disputation—this is like using a tube to view the sky or a bodkin to probe the earth. Is it not too small a thing? Go now.”

Moreover, have you alone not heard of the young man of Shouling who went to Handan to learn its way of walking? Before he had mastered the state’s skill, he had already forgotten his own way of walking—so he could only crawl home on all fours. If you do not leave now, you will forget your own way and lose your own calling.

Gongsun Long’s mouth gaped open and would not close, his tongue lifted and would not descend, until he fled like a *han* (a red insect) or a centipede. Guo’s commentary: To monopolize a puddle’s water and strut about in the joy of a shallow well is like a small bird contenting itself with thistles and brambles. The left foot has not yet entered when the right is already entangled—how could one who understands the great not roam in the small? It is not that he does not delight in it, but that the small cannot envy the great. Each thing has its proper place; one cannot forcibly emulate another. Beginning in the darkest mystery and returning to the great thoroughfare—this speaks of his boundlessness. He who roams the limitless cannot be grasped by disputation or scrutiny. Those unequal to the task should depart. To imitate another is to lose both.

Lü’s commentary: The bounds of right and wrong speak of their origins. To grasp the origin of right and wrong is to see Yao and Jie as one, to know and not know as the same. From this perspective, one is left speechless, with no room for argument. From the Yellow Springs to the six directions below, from the Great Emperor to the Great Ultimate above—unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, lost in the unfathomable. Forgetting darkness and light, without direction, one enters the numinous. Unconfined by east or west, beginning in the darkest mystery and returning to the great thoroughfare, one merges with the harmonious center, transcends the spirit, and attains clarity. In short, this is what is meant by the six penetrations and four openings, form filling emptiness—this is it. This meaning cannot be exhausted in words, nor can it be debated. Yet to seek it with narrow vision, to grasp it with disputation, is like using a tube to view the sky or a bodkin to probe the earth.

Oral exegesis: Gongsun Long was a disputer of his time, like a red insect in a shallow well. In the hollow of a well, *han*-insects, crabs, and tadpoles all circle within it—hence the saying, “returning to the *han*-insects, crabs, and tadpoles.” Nine years of floods, seven years of drought—truly, all things perish. Zhuangzi wrote of ten years of floods and eight years of drought, but this is a separate matter. *Shishi* means startled; *shangju* is a small insect. *Ci* means to tread; *dahuang* is heaven. To tread below upon the Yellow Springs and ascend above to heaven speaks of his lofty and distant vision. *Shiran* means released; *sijie* means four directions unbound. *Lunyu buce* means entering the unfathomable. Beginning in the darkest mystery speaks of the time before the limitless; returning to the great thoroughfare means returning to the ultimate Dao. *Guoneng* refers to the way of walking practiced in Handan.

Zhuangzi was fishing in the Pu River when the King of Chu sent two great ministers to approach him first, saying, “We wish to trouble you with the affairs of the kingdom.” Zhuangzi held his fishing rod and did not turn, saying, “I have heard that in Chu there is a divine turtle that has been dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in silk and stored in a casket in the ancestral temple. Would this turtle rather have died and left its bones to be venerated, or lived and dragged its tail through the mud?” The two ministers said, “It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.” Zhuangzi said, “Go away. I will drag my tail through the mud.”

Guo’s commentary: The divine turtle is a metaphor for how each nature has its own place of rest.
Lü’s commentary: Zhuangzi did not know the dead—he spoke thus to rescue those of his time who pursued profit and forgot life. Only the two ministers’ understanding was sufficient for this.
Personal insight: Zhuangzi declined the summons with the turtle as a metaphor. Formerly, Tao Zhuo, when living in seclusion, yoked two strong oxen to answer an imperial summons—one was confined by the whip and bridle, the other roamed freely among the water and grass. This is the same idea.

When Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to see him. Someone said to Huizi, “Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as prime minister.” Thereupon, Huizi became alarmed and searched the state for three days and three nights. Zhuangzi went to see him and said, “In the south there is a bird called the *yuanchu*—have you heard of it? The *yuanchu* sets out from the South Sea and flies to the North Sea. It will not perch except on a parasol tree, will not eat except bamboo fruit, and will not drink except from sweet springs. At that moment, an owl had found a rotten rat. When the *yuanchu* flew over, it looked up and cried, ‘Hah!’ Now do you wish to use your state of Liang to ‘hah’ at me?”

Guo’s commentary: “Searched the state” means to muster troops and marshal forces. The *yuanchu* is a metaphor for how desires differ, and each has its own limits.
Supplementary notes: The *yuanchu* is a young phoenix; *lian* fruit is bamboo fruit. *Hah* is the sound of anger, fearing the loss of its food. The ways of the world and the feelings of men—seeing this, one can burst into laughter. Zhuangzi vividly depicted the petty man’s fear of loss with a single word. How splendid! Personal insight: *Sou* in the commentary means to search the state; Guo’s commentary takes *sou* as *shou* (to hunt). But if an owl has found a rotten rat and cries *hah*, how can it compare to the taste of bamboo fruit and sweet springs, or the perch on a verdant parasol tree?

Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, “The *tiao* fish swim out so leisurely—this is the joy of fish.” Huizi said, “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?” Zhuangzi said, “You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?” Huizi said, “I am not you, so of course I do not know you. You are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete.” Zhuangzi said, “Let us return to the beginning. When you said, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’ you already knew I knew it and asked me. I know it here on the Hao.”

Guo’s commentary: Zhuangzi said, “You are not me, so you can know that I am not a fish—then I am not a fish, so I can know the joy of fish.” Huizi abandoned the root of his words and quibbled to make his point. Zhuangzi followed Huizi’s original words, saying, “You are not a fish, so you have no way of knowing it. Now you are not me, yet you say, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’ This means you know I am not a fish. If you know I am not a fish, then all who know one another can know one another in this way—there is no need to be the fish to know the fish. So, following your ‘How do you know?’—you already knew what I knew. And now you ask me again—I simply know it here on the Hao. Why wait to enter the water? What is born in a place and finds rest there—heaven and earth cannot change its place, yin and yang cannot alter its nature. Thus, to know what is comfortable for land-dwellers and infer the joy of water-dwellers is hardly the subtlest point.”

The *Deputy Ink*—Huizi said, “You and the fish dwell in different realms, water and land. How then can you know the joy of fish?” Zhuangzi borrowed his words and turned them back, saying, “You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?” Huizi again borrowed his words and shifted them, saying, “I am not you, so of course I do not know you. Yet even you and I, both of the same kind, remain divided by the barrier of self and other and do not fully know one another. How much less, then, can you know the fish, who are not of our kind? By this reasoning, there is no possible way for you to know the fish at all.”

At this, Zhuangzi countered directly: “Let us return to the original words. All this back-and-forth debate of ours is but branch and leaf—it is not the root of the matter. Following the original thread, you already know that I know the fish. Yet you still ask me—precisely to seek the reason why I know the joy of fish. Not to understand the principles of things and the feelings of others is naturally something one may infer. I dwell at ease upon the Hao, and thus the joy of those beneath its waters goes without saying. As the ancients said, Zhuangzi was skilled at understanding the feelings of things—this is why.”

Li Shibiao: “Nothing is without the Dao, and so it is with me.”

"Is there any distinction in nature that is not sufficient unto itself? The celestial principle is thus with me. How could there be, though the affinity between things and myself be as such? For there exists a wondrous principle that knows without deliberate knowing, that grasps subtleties in silent communion—a reception so primal it cannot escape what precedes it. This is how Zhuangzi knew the joy of fish at Hao’s edge.

Now, to emerge and soar, to glide and swim—free from the peril of nets, untroubled by the need to moisten parched gills—leisurely within the bounds of a single watercourse: is this to be deemed the joy of fish? And if this is the joy of fish, why must one await Nan Hua to recognize it? For the joy of fish lies in the Dao, not in the water; what Nan Hua knew lay in joy, not in fish. Fish forget the water, and thus their joy is complete; man forgets the fish, and thus his knowing is whole.

Here, Zhuangzi would have remained silent. Hui Shi, too, would have asked nothing—yet this debate arose. Without inquiry, the ultimate words find no foothold; without words, the subtleties of the Dao remain unseen. It serves but to dispel the obstruction of later ages, the delusion that divides things and self into two.

Things will ever have their own nature—how could Zhuangzi, not being a fish, know the joy of fish? The self will ever have its own nature—how could you, not being me, know that I do not know the joy of fish? Knowing and not knowing are but the branches of the Dao. This is why I urged returning to the root. As for those who know neither root nor branch—ancients have spoken of this before: the eye is like the ear, the ear..."

The eye is like the ear, the ear like the nose, the nose like the mouth—what is within me is thus alike. Seeing life as death, seeing oneself as fish, seeing swine as men, seeing men as swine—what is within things is thus alike. If this be so, then everywhere is the ultimate wandering, and nowhere is not a wondrous place; every thing is true joy, and nowhere is not the harmony of Heaven. Why alone the joy of the minnows at Hao Bridge?

I know that Zhuangzi and the fish were never divided. Only those who understand that supreme joy is no-joy, true knowing is no-knowing, may speak of this.

**General Observations on the Chapter**

This chapter, titled "Autumn Floods," employs the dialogue between the River Lord and the Ocean Spirit to illustrate the principles of the small and the great, the refined and the coarse, clarifying the view of the Dao, things, functions, and tendencies—all rooted in nature, without nobility or baseness, success or failure, gain or loss, but fitting to their time. Through repeated debate and refutation, it ultimately returns to the idea that one must not use the human to obliterate the Heavenly, nor use the artificial to obliterate fate, but seek sufficiency within the bounds of one’s nature—this is called returning to the true, which lies beyond the reach of words, thoughts, or discernment.

Next, it discusses how the centipede pities the snake, and the snake pities the wind, using this to illustrate how people, ashamed of their own talents and knowledge, fail to realize that the mechanisms of Heaven cannot be altered, and that what is small may overcome what is great. Truly understanding this principle, each thing is sufficient in its own nature—what is there to pity? With nothing to pity, there is nothing to envy; thus, the longing of aspiration ceases, and the intent to discriminate dissolves. This is the ultimate essence.

When Confucius traveled to Kuang and faced danger without fear, he knew that fate was determined by the Creator, not by the people of Kuang. If one were to be obstructed or humiliated by adversity, how could the courage of the sage be seen? The well-frog and the sea turtle exemplify the earlier principle of the River Lord and the Ocean Spirit, returning to the understanding of principle and the exercise of adaptability, where no thing can cause harm. Yet the world, sunk in turbidity and narrow in vision, even when aware of sages and worthies before them, still clings to aspiration, like disciples imitating their masters’ steps, only to lose their own footing—seeking what is long with what is short, pursuing what is beyond one’s nature. Such efforts are not only futile but harmful.

The discussion of the divine turtle, which would rather drag its tail in the mud, and the phoenix chick, which has no attachment to rotten mice, laments the shallowness of the age and the obstruction of the Dao. The chapter concludes with Zhuangzi and Huizi’s debate at Hao Bridge, asserting that the natures of things and self are fundamentally the same, merely separated by form and thus unable to know one another. When united in nature, their joy is the same here as there—what one finds peaceful, the joy of the fish is no wonder. Yet those who exhaust themselves in debate while forgetting the root of nature and fate—this is truly strange.

These words are not only a remedy for Huizi’s deep-seated delusion but also a warning to the world: those who cling to a single master’s teachings and take pleasure in their own entanglement are no different from the River Lord, who boasted of his abundance of water. Thus, the chapter’s intent is brought to a close.

**Chapter Eighteen: "Ultimate Joy"**

Is there in the world an ultimate joy, or is there not? Is there a way to preserve life, or is there not? What should one do? What should one rely upon? What should one avoid? Where should one dwell? What should one pursue? What should one abandon? What should one delight in? What should one detest?

What the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and harmonious sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice. What it suffers are the inability to rest at ease, to savor rich flavors, to wear fine garments, to behold beauty, or to hear harmonious sounds. Those who cannot attain these things are deeply troubled and fearful for their bodies—how foolish!

The wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing wealth they cannot fully use—how alienated they are from their own bodies! The noble lie awake at night, fretting over right and wrong—how estranged they are from their own bodies! Human life is born with sorrow. The long-lived grow dull and weary, their prolonged sorrow never ending—what suffering! How distant they are from their own bodies!

The steadfast knight is praised by the world for his goodness—yet this is not enough to preserve his own life. I do not know whether goodness is truly good or truly not good. If it is deemed good yet insufficient to preserve life, or deemed not good yet sufficient to preserve others, then we may say: when loyal remonstrance goes unheeded, one should withdraw and not contend. Thus, when Wu Zixu contended and was destroyed in body, even his name did not endure—was there truly goodness in this, or was there none?

As for what the common world pursues and delights in, I do not know whether such delight is truly delight or truly not delight. I observe that those who rush together in pursuit of worldly pleasures do so with such urgency, as if they cannot help themselves, all claiming it is delight—yet I do not find it delightful, nor do I find it not delightful. Is there truly delight in this, or is there none?

I hold that non-action is true delight—yet it is precisely what the world deems most bitter. Thus it is said: the utmost delight is without delight; the utmost praise is without praise. The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. The utmost delight preserves life—only non-action comes close to this. Let me attempt to speak of it:

Heaven is non-active and thereby clear;
Earth is non-active and thereby tranquil.
When the two non-actions unite,
the ten thousand things are transformed.
Vast and obscure,
elusive and intangible—
from whence do they arise?

Vast and obscure, elusive and intangible—yet is there truly form in this? The ten thousand things, each in its own thriving, all grow from non-action. Thus it is said: Heaven and Earth are non-active, yet nothing remains undone. As for man—who can attain non-action?

[Annotations from commentators:
* "Crouching and following" (蹲循) suggests compliance without resistance; "roaming and hastening" (逡巡) describes the rush toward death. "Thronging" (誙誙) depicts the crowd’s frenzy; "each in its own thriving" (职职) means each thing has its proper place, while "flourishing" (繁植) describes their proliferation.]

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
Only when joy is forgotten does delight become sufficient; only when delight is sufficient does life endure. Shall we call this "having delight"? Yet the utmost delight is without joy. Shall we call it "having no delight"? Yet life is preserved, and care is absent. To cling to avoidance or pursuit, delight or aversion—none of these eight suffice to preserve life. Only by making no choices and yielding to what one encounters can wholeness be attained.

All flavors, sights, sounds, and pleasures—losing them harms not the form, while gaining them damages the nature. Yet people grieve over their absence, thus revealing their folly. To guard one’s form, know contentment; to cherish one’s form, find self-sufficiency within. Only by relinquishing life can one forget care; only by forgetting care can life become delightful. When life is delightful, the form is mine to possess, wealth is mine to claim, honor is mine to enjoy.

The resolute man sees goodness—yet it is not enough to preserve life, for goodness may exceed what is fitting and thus fail to aid others. "Crouching and following" means not contending; only the virtue of the Mean is fitting. Whether in goodness or its absence, one should follow the central course as one’s guiding principle.

The thronging masses hasten toward what they deem delightful, even unto death. That I neither delight in it nor fail to delight—this is to be free of attachment and let things take their course. The delight of non-action is simply freedom from care. The world takes clamor and splendor as delight, beauty and goodness as praise—yet the right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. If I practice non-action and leave the world’s right and wrong to itself, then right and wrong will settle themselves.

The utmost delight preserves life—only non-action comes close to this. When the people are content, my life nears preservation. Heaven and Earth are naturally clear and tranquil; they do not act, yet all things harmonize of themselves. Thus the ten thousand things are transformed, as if by design. Yet if one acts, there will be times of stagnation. That from which things arise—they arise of themselves, not through any act of creation. That which has no form is the form of non-action. That which grows from non-action grows of itself.

When man attains non-action, delight arises without delight.

Guan Jian’s reflections:
Man dwells in an illusory realm where delight is hard to attain and life hard to preserve. Thus this chapter begins by lamenting that the utmost delight and preservation of life cannot be assured. Yet if one abides in one’s natural lot, making no claims of avoidance or pursuit, then what delight or aversion remains?

What the world delights in—wealth, honor, longevity, goodness, rich flavors, sights, and sounds—yet beauty and goodness cannot always be had. What lies below, what brings suffering—poverty, lowliness, early death, evil, unfulfilled desires. If one wanders in the realm of things’ origins, one may yet forget them—how could external burdens reach one?

Yet observe the rich, who exhaust their bodies with illness; the noble, who weary their minds with cares; the long-lived, who endure prolonged sorrow over not dying—all have estranged their forms and drifted far from the Way. Even the resolute man’s path fails to preserve life. Thus, in loyal remonstrance, do not contend; gently guide and enlighten, that the ruler may avoid errors and the minister fulfill his duty—this is the flourishing of ruler and minister.

As for Wu Zixu, who contended and perished, yet thereby won fame—was this truly good, or was it not? Observe the world’s so-called delights: are they truly delightful, or not? I hold that non-action is true delight, yet the world deems it bitter—thus its inclinations are clear. Only by knowing that the utmost delight is without delight can one see that the world’s delights are not true delight. Only by knowing that the utmost praise is without praise can one see that the resolute man’s striving is not true fame. Then one may rest in non-action and thereby settle the right and wrong of the world.

Thus, those who seek the utmost delight and preservation of life come closest through non-action. Heaven and Earth are non-active and thereby clear and tranquil, so the ten thousand things are transformed. If man can practice non-action, how could things fail to be transformed?

When Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said, "You lived with her, raised children together, and grew old—yet not weeping at her death would be enough. To drum on a basin and sing—is this not excessive?"

Zhuangzi replied, "Not so. When she first died, how could I not have felt grief? Yet I examined her beginning and found that originally there was no life. Not only was there no life—originally there was no form. Not only was there no form—originally there was no qi. Amidst the vast and obscure, a transformation occurred, and there was qi; the qi transformed, and there was form; the form transformed, and there was life. Now there is another transformation, and she has died. This is like the passing of spring and autumn, winter and summer, the turning of the four seasons. She now lies peacefully in the great chamber, and I follow wailing loudly—would this not show a failure to understand fate? Thus I stopped."

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
Before enlightenment, there is grief; after enlightenment, it ceases. This is how one instructs those with attachments, urging them to extend this principle to cast off burdens.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary:
What Zhuangzi valued aligns with Confucius and Mengsun Cai, yet his conduct resembles that of Zisang Bo, Zifan, and Zi Qinzhang. Why? The corruption of the human Way lies in the world’s submersion in the perversity of sorrow and joy, which extinguishes Heaven’s principle. Thus the remedy lies in such conduct.

Zhili Shu and Gu Jieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo, the wasteland of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once rested. Suddenly, a willow sprouted from Gu Jieshu’s left elbow, startling him. Zhili Shu asked, "Do you dislike it?"

Gu Jieshu replied, "No—why should I dislike it? Life is a temporary borrowing; the borrower is but dust and grime. Death and life are like day and night. Moreover, you and I observed transformation, and transformation has reached me—why should I dislike it?"

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
This first shows attachment, then seeks the ultimate principle to cast it off. If one were to say, "I am originally without attachment, thus free from care," then those with attachments would remain trapped in the distant realm of remoteness, bewildered by the confines of sorrow and joy.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary:
Where the Yellow Emperor rested, the heart dies and the form withers, like soil unaware of the willow sprouting from the elbow. The willow is a thing of easy growth; Gu Jieshu’s initial reaction was unavoidable shock and dislike. Yet he ultimately understood that life is a temporary borrowing, mere dust and grime—why dislike it? The ancients’ way of observing transformation was like this.

Following the path of origin:
*Mingbo* is a posthumous title, akin to the *Mingmo Jun* mentioned in the *Wen Xuan*; *Mingbo’s Mound* is a tomb for the dead. This tomb lies in the wasteland of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once rested. Moved by this, one realizes that unlike the Yellow Emperor, who ascended as an immortal, this person died. The *liu* refers to the willow wood used to screen the coffin—*sandalwood bows* were placed against the walls by the Zhou people, and the *liu* garments were draped over them. Zhili Shu and Gu Jieshu, observing among the ruins and graves, found their thoughts suddenly manifest: a coffin-screening willow sprouted from the left elbow—a dire omen, portending death. Thus, their minds were shaken, startled, and repulsed. After Zhili Shu expressed his aversion, he asked Gu Jieshu, "Do you find it repulsive?" Gu Jieshu replied, "I feel no aversion. Life is but a temporary borrowing—what is called the *four great elements* conjoined in假合. Since life is but a borrowed state, it is no more than dust and grime gathering. Why cling or struggle? Death and life are as constant as day and night—what is there to fear or dread? Transformation is death. Mencius even likened transformation to *not letting soil cling to the skin*—I say, you and I came to the graveyard to observe others’ deaths, and now we witness this inauspicious sign. Death will come to me as surely as it comes to all. Why should I dislike it?" Some interpret *liu* as the willow tree, but this seems inconsistent with the text’s meaning.

When Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he saw an empty skull, its form stark and desiccated. He struck it with his horse whip and questioned it: "Did you, sir, covet life and lose the Dao, bringing this upon yourself? Or did you meet your end through the fall of a state, executed by axe and halberd? Or did you commit some unworthy deed, shamed before your parents, wife, and children, and so came to this?"

"Or did you suffer from cold and hunger, bringing you to this end? Or did your years naturally reach their term?" With these words, Zhuangzi finished speaking, then took the skull as a pillow and lay down to sleep. At midnight, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said, "Your words resemble those of a sophist. All that you have mentioned are the burdens of the living. In death, none of these remain. Would you like to hear the truth of death?"

Zhuangzi replied, "Indeed, I would."

The skull said, "In death, there is no lord above nor minister below, nor the affairs of the four seasons. One roams freely, taking heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass this."

Zhuangzi, unconvinced, said, "If I were to have the Controller of Fate restore your form—returning your bones, flesh, and skin, and bringing back your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances—would you desire this?"

The skull furrowed its brow deeply and replied, "How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human world?"

---

Guo Xiang’s commentary: The old saying that Zhuangzi delighted in death and despised life is mistaken. If this were so, what would it mean to equalize life and death? The meaning of equalization is to be at peace in life and at peace in death. Once the emotions of life and death are equalized, there is no need to grieve over death while living. This is Zhuangzi’s intent.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: To trace the origin and grasp the end is to understand the discourse on life and death, for they are but one body. Those who covet life and fear death are certainly mistaken, but those who delight in death and despise life—how can they be said to treat life and death as one? Zhuangzi spoke thus because the world’s greatest affliction lies in coveting life and fearing death. In this light, how could the joy of a king facing south be spoken of without purpose?

Bi Xu’s commentary: Those who cherish life find joy in worldly affairs, while those who embrace death see the human world as toil. Only those who transcend life and death can discuss its great outline.

New Transmission: Life is but the temporary gathering of a single *qi*, and death its temporary dispersal. Life is not necessarily without action, nor is death necessarily with action. The incompleteness of supreme joy lies in what is not necessarily without action, while its completeness lies in what is not necessarily with action. This is why Zhuangzi spoke of the skull’s unwillingness to abandon the joy of a king facing south. The six bodily forms are but lodgings for the self. In life, they temporarily gather with *qi*; in death, they temporarily disperse with *qi*. Gathering and dispersal are not inherently mine—how then can I claim ownership of the self? To claim ownership of the self is to fail to forget form. Failing to forget form leads to action, and action that clashes with things like blades prevents the supreme joy from being inwardly complete. This aligns with the skull’s reluctance to return to the human world.

When Yan Yuan traveled east to Qi, Confucius wore a worried expression. Zigong stepped down from his mat and asked, "May this student dare to ask why, when Yan Yuan travels to Qi, the Master wears a worried expression?"

Confucius replied, "Excellent question. Formerly, Guanzi spoke words I greatly admired: *'A small sack cannot hold a large thing; a short rope cannot draw from a deep well.'* Such is the way of fate—it has its completion, and form has its fitting place. It cannot be diminished or augmented. I fear that Yan Yuan will speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Dao of Yao, Shun, the Yellow Emperor, and further expound the words of Suiren and Shennong. He will seek within himself and find nothing, and finding nothing, he will confuse others. Confusion leads to death. Have you alone not heard the tale? Formerly, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Marquis of Lu welcomed it with an escort, offered it wine in the ancestral temple, played the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared a grand feast of sacrificial oxen. The bird, however, looked on with sorrow and dread, refusing to eat a single morsel or drink a single cup. After three days, it died. This was nourishing the bird with what nourishes oneself, not with what nourishes the bird. To nourish the bird with what nourishes the bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, roam open plains, float on rivers and lakes, feed on fish and frogs, follow its flock in flight, and rest at ease. It abhors human speech—why subject it to such clamor? When the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* was performed in the wilds of Dongting, birds heard it and flew away, beasts heard it and fled, fish heard it and dove deep, while people, hearing it suddenly, gathered to watch. Fish live in water and thrive, but humans drown in it—they must have different likes and dislikes, hence their differences. Thus, the sages of old did not unify abilities or standardize affairs. Names were confined to reality, and meanings were set to fit. This is called *tiaoda* (orderly flow) and *fuchi* (fortune sustained)."

---

Guo Xiang’s commentary: It cannot be diminished or augmented, so one should simply follow it. Seeking within and finding nothing leads to seeking without. Abandoning the inner for the outer—is this not confusion? *"Did not unify abilities or standardize affairs"* means each follows their nature. *"Names confined to reality"* and *"meanings set to fit"* ensure orderly flow, while *"fortune sustained"* means the constant of nature is preserved.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: The tale of the seabird is meant to urge scholars to reflect deeply and act cautiously. The differences between a city wall’s moat and a cave’s hole, the skills of a thousand-mile net and a hunting trap, the natures of night-bright and day-dark—these are why the sages did not unify abilities or standardize affairs. *"Names confined to reality"* avoids excessive names; *"meanings set to fit"* avoids excessive application. *"Orderly flow"* means following the length of each branch without seeking uniformity, for seeking uniformity leads to disorder. *"Fortune sustained"* means adhering to one’s allotted share without overreaching, for overreaching leads to loss.

Bi Xu’s commentary: Fate received naturally cannot be forced—like a small bag, how can it contain a large thing? One’s endowment and allotted share cannot be altered—like a short rope, how can it draw from a deep well? The seabird’s alarm at the *Nine Shao* is like the Marquis of Qi’s alarm at the august Dao. People vary in worthiness, so none can unify affairs; times differ between ancient and modern, so none can standardize them. If names and realities do not exceed their bounds, there is order without blockage; if principles and applications fit, misfortune departs without peril.

Liezi was eating by the roadside when he saw a hundred-year-old skull. He plucked some mugwort, pointed at it, and said, "Only you and I know that you have never died, never been born. Do you truly find nourishment in this?"

"Do you truly delight in this? The seed has its potential: when it obtains water, it becomes *fang*; when it obtains the border of water and earth, it becomes a frog; when the *pin*’s husk grows on a mound, it becomes *lingxi*; *lingxi* obtaining dense shade becomes *wuzu*; the root of *wuzu* becomes a grub, its leaves become butterflies. The butterflies in time transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off shell, their name *quduo*. After a thousand days, *quduo* becomes a bird called *ganyu*; the saliva of *ganyu* becomes *simi*; *simi* becomes *shixi*; *yilu* is born from *shixi*. *Huangkuang* is born from *yilu*; *maomao* and *rui* are born from *jiuyou*; *fuquan* is born from decayed matter; *yangxi* compared to unopened bamboo gives birth to *qingning*; *qingning* gives birth to *chengcheng*; *chengcheng* gives birth to horses; horses give birth to humans; humans in turn return to the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things enter into the mechanism."

[Guo’s annotation: "Never having died, never having been born—each delights in what it encounters. Is there truly nourishment? Is there truly delight? The reality of nourishment and delight has no fixed abode. 'The seed has its potential' speaks of transformations whose number cannot be exhausted. From 'when it obtains water, it becomes *fang*' to 'all things enter into the mechanism'—this speaks of one qi and myriad forms, of transformation without death or birth."]

[Lü’s annotation: "The wandering soul transforms without ceasing, going everywhere—what does a hundred-year-old skull know? When the heart is hollowed to the point of no-knowledge, then one knows it has never been born, never died, and is equal to it. Do you truly find nourishment and fear death? Do I truly delight and rejoice in life? Only by knowing the wandering soul goes everywhere and that essence and qi are things—does their seed truly have potential? Thus *fang* and the *pin*’s husk, *lingxi*, are one kind: some obtain the border of water and earth, some obtain mounds, and their lives differ. *Wuzu*, grubs, butterflies, and mounds are also one kind: some obtain dense shade, some roots, some leaves, and their transformations differ. *Quduo*, *ganyu*, *simi*, *shixi*, and *xu* are also one kind: some are born beneath the stove, some after long days, some from saliva, and their lives differ. *Huangkuang* compared to *jiuyou*, *maomao* and *rui* compared to *fuquan*, *yangxi* compared to unopened bamboo—one does not know the origin of their seed. *Qingning*, *chengcheng*."]

One kind they are—yet horses and humans are born of themselves. Thus, some things are born of the emotionless, some of the emotional; some emotionless things give rise to the emotional, some emotional things to the emotionless—all the work of the wandering soul and essence-qi. All that Master Lie spoke of, he had heard and seen and thus knew; but what he had never heard or seen—could one exhaust its telling?

**Bi Xu** notes:
I have never died—does life truly bring joy? You have never lived—does death truly bring nurturance? This seeks to fathom the principle of neither death nor birth. Once, Master Lie encountered a frog by the roadside and, pointing to it, discoursed on the mechanism of transformation: when frogs sense the qi of fire, they become quails; when they obtain water, they mate and breed. The *Shuowen* says: *fan* (蟠) reversed becomes *yi* (螠), which clings to water’s edge, where moss grows like clothing—this is the origin of tadpoles. *Yi* (螠) left on hills and mounds transforms into a plant called *lingxi* (陵舄), known medicinally as *cheqian* grass. Here, the emotional enters the emotionless, as when earthworms become lilies. *Yuqi* (郁栖) is dung and soil. The *wuzu* grass grows by water and is commonly called "ink grass" or "crow’s beard," used in prescriptions—one plant with roots and leaves differing due to the yin and yang of qi. Some things arise through mutual dependence, defying broad generalization. Butterflies, drawn to *yuqi*, transform into *quduo* (鸲掇): at first, their forms are pure, as if newly shed; after a thousand days, they can fly. Their foam becomes the *simi* (斯弥) insect. This speaks of endless mutual transformation between small and great. *Simi* feeding on vinegar and below clarifies how emotional beings change upon contact. *Maorui* (瞀芮) are fireflies born from rotting grass and decaying *fuquan* (腐蠸). Here, the emotionless becomes emotional, as when moldy wheat turns into butterflies. *Fuquan* gives rise to *yangxi* (羊奚), which is *yangti* vegetable—emotional returning to the emotionless. *Yangxi* and old, unopened bamboo combine, two emotionless things uniting to produce *qingning* (青宁), a creature resembling a hedgehog. Common folk say: "Where bamboo thickets decay, hedgehogs abound." The *Shizi* says: "The people of Yue call leopards *cheng* (程)." Some say *cheng* refers to tapirs. The *Soushen Ji* records that during Duke Xiao of Qin’s reign, a horse gave birth to a human—likely the five phases and six qi interacting with things to produce inexplicable changes.

**Jiang Yu** notes:
A skull, after a hundred years, may have its wandering soul transform again into a human, who then lives another hundred years before dying. If it transforms into other things, its deaths and rebirths would be incalculable. Yet the empty skull remains, its form still discernible. Master Lie alone grasped the wonder of his own body, while the skull had undergone a hundred years of change. Thus, Master Lie pointed to it and said: "Only you and I know that we have never died, never been born." Here, Master Lie, drawing on what he had seen and known of their origins, posed a question to the skull to illustrate the transformations of the myriad things. Some things are born through emotion, some through imagination; those born of moisture arise through union and response, while those formed by transformation arise through separation and correspondence. Emotion, imagination, union, and separation intermingle, shifting between great and small—all emerging and entering through the *mechanism*, yet equally containing the supreme principle, without distinction. What, then, is this *mechanism*? How do the myriad things emerge and enter through it? The *Suwen* says: "When emergence and entry cease, the spiritual mechanism of transformation perishes." For the success and failure of the myriad things depend on movement. Movement without end gives rise to change and transformation. Thus, without emergence and entry, there would be no birth, growth, maturity, or aging. Yet though emergence and entry differ, their mechanism is one; though their mechanism is subtle, it is revealed through emergence and entry. The mechanism operates through emergence and entry, yet one cannot say emergence and entry *are* the mechanism, nor can one seek the mechanism apart from emergence and entry. With each emergence and entry, the spiritual mechanism moves. The *Yinfu Jing* says: "Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is the mechanism." This speaks of the myriad things emerging from and entering into the mechanism—yet why single out humans, if not because humans are the most spiritually endowed of the myriad things, and thus exemplify them all?

**Fu Mo** notes:
Beneath the brambles lay a skull. Master Lie lifted the brambles and pointed to it, saying: "Only you and I know that we have never died." Examining its origin, we see it has never been born. If it has never been born, it should not expect nurturance; if it has never died, why fear annihilation or seek joy? Such delight in life and death is but delusion. You and I alike dwell in the great forge of creation—whether as *fang* (防) or liver worms, arms or legs—we are but what we transform into.

Surveying the varieties of transformation, consider those arising from moisture: earth’s dust, blown by the breath of the *xi* (息), floats upon water, each speck trailing another like silk threads—this is called *fang* (防). It is the precursor of water moss, which first appears where water and earth meet. When water receives the qi of earth, it congeals into substance, called the "clothing of frogs and clams"—that is, *shuixi* (水舄). Growing in water, it is *shuixi*, as in the *Book of Songs*: "We gather the *xu* (藚)." Frogs and clams cling beneath it as their clothing. When it grows on mounds, it becomes *lingxi* (陵舄), the *fu yi* (芣苡) of the *Book of Songs*—one thing with water and land variants. *Lingxi* obtaining *yuqi* (郁栖) transforms into *wuzu* (乌足); *yuqi* is dung and soil. *Wuzu* is also a plant name: its roots become *qicao* (蛴螬) grubs, its leaves butterflies—*xu* (胥) insects. Butterflies and *yi* (螠) further transform into other insects. Generally, when plants become insects, their forms are soft and wriggling. Those born in fields or beneath wild stoves, receiving the qi of fire, transform into insects without skin or shell, resembling newly shed skins—these are *quduo* (鸲掇). *Quduo* burrow into earth for a thousand days, then transform into birds called *ganyu* (干余). The foam of *ganyu* becomes *simi* (斯弥); *simi* becomes *shike* (食榼), the vinegar gnat. Fond of sourness, they gather around vinegar—hence "vinegar-eaters." *Shike* give rise to *yilu* (颐辂); *yilu* to *jiuyou* (九猷); *jiuyou* to *huangkuang* (黄軦); *huangkuang* to *fuquan* (腐蠸); *fuquan* to *maorui* (瞀芮)—each generating the next, all insects. *Yangxi* (羊奚) compared to old, unopened bamboo forms one phrase: *yangxi* is a plant whose roots resemble turnips, and when its roots connect with bamboo that has long ceased to sprout, they produce *qingning* (青宁), a bamboo-root insect. Tracing its origin, an old man once saw a five-inch-long insect, with an inch or so remaining—was this not the so-called *qingning*, the bamboo root yet to transform? *Cheng* (程) is an alternate name for leopards. The *Mengxi Bitan* notes that the people of Yanzhou still call tigers and leopards *cheng*.

The *qingning* gives rise to the *cheng*; the *cheng* gives rise to the horse; the horse gives rise to man—such matters exist in the world. As the histories record, the Wu Ling Man of Changsha were born from beasts, their primal ancestor conceived from the wombs of wolves and deer. One cannot restrict such transformations by the limits of ear and eye.

Where *qi* stirs, there is *ji* (mechanism); what emerges from *ji* is life, what enters into *ji* is death. Between heaven and earth, there is only the ceaseless circulation of the two *qi*—yin and yang. Nurturing them, delighting in them—why trouble the heart? Simply follow their natural transformations.

**A Humble Overview**

This chapter, titled "Utmost Joy," begins by discussing the burdens of existence, the manifold sorrows that compel one to flee or stay, yet leave one at a loss for how to preserve life. What is the reason? I contend that when, amid suffering, the heart generates revulsion and fiercely longs for return, joy will soon arrive. Thus, what the vulgar call "joy" may not truly be joy at all.

For all things under heaven, prosperity contains decline, and extremity must transform. The solitary minister and the grieving son—vigilant in heart, anxious in thought—attain insight precisely through this. Thus, one knows that poverty, lowliness, and sorrow forge the jade girl’s success, for the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune always lie in mutual concealment. The world is mired in the realm of sorrow and joy, unable to escape. How can one find peace in the nature of life and destiny?

Therefore, in the end, the absence of joy and praise is the highest praise and utmost joy. Later, the chapter records the song of the drum and basin and the skull’s reply, both taking what others find joyless as their own joy. How could such joy be shared with the vulgar?

In the middle, it describes observing transformations, where those touched by change undergo elbow mutations without aversion, while those who seek themselves in vain hear music and are startled by sorrow. This teaches that following transformation makes all joys equal, while resisting one’s nature—even in nurturance—is not true joy.

Finally, it discusses the inconstancy of human, plant, insect, and beast transformations, concluding: all emerge from *ji*, all return to *ji*. How vast is *ji*! Who can relax or tighten it? All that pertains to form and vessel arises from this. Birth and death, transformation and circulation—endless. Whether one delights in life and abhors death, or rejoices in death and wearies of life, one is trapped in partiality and not the essence of joy.

Only when there is no joy and no non-joy, no life and no non-life, does one cease to be enslaved by transformation or driven by *ji*. Attaining the wondrous emptiness of the Great Expansion—unified, uncontrived—vanishing into boundlessness, profound and abiding: this is the utmost joy.

**Chapter Nineteen: Attaining Life**

One who attains the nature of life does not pursue what life cannot provide. One who attains the nature of destiny does not pursue what knowledge cannot address. Why? To nurture the body, one must first rely on things. Yet there are cases where things are abundant, yet the body is not nurtured. To have life, one must first avoid separation from form. Yet there are cases where form is not separated, yet life perishes.

Life’s arrival cannot be refused; its departure cannot be halted. Alas! The people of the world believe that nurturing the body suffices to preserve life, yet nurturing the body does not suffice to preserve life. Then what in the world is worth pursuing? Though it may not suffice, one cannot avoid pursuing it—such pursuit is inescapable.

To escape the pursuit of form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Abandoning the world eliminates burdens; without burdens, one is upright and balanced. Upright and balanced, one exchanges life with the other; exchanging life, one approaches the subtle. What need is there to abandon affairs or forsake life? Abandoning affairs spares the body from labor; forsaking life preserves the essence from depletion.

When the body is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with heaven. Heaven and earth are the parents of the myriad things: united, they form bodies; scattered, they begin anew. When form and essence are not depleted, this is called "shifting essence," and essence returns to harmonize with heaven.

*Guo’s Annotation*: What life cannot provide are external things. What knowledge cannot address lies beyond destiny. Knowing when to stop within one’s allotment, matching one’s life with things—this is sufficient.

Excess brings harm. Clinging too rigidly to form leads to the loss of life; knowing what lies beyond one’s control, one acts without attachment, yet anxiety lingers within—thus, the more one nurtures, the more one loses. The more lavishly one tends, the swifter death approaches. Better to release and follow one’s nature. What each being is allotted arises from the utmost principle, and thus cannot be avoided.

Therefore, those skilled in nurturing life follow and yield to it. What is called "exchanging life" is daily renewal. Entrusting oneself to daily renewal, one’s nature and destiny are fully realized. Abandoning affairs spares the body from labor; forsaking life preserves the essence from depletion. Thus, in this forsaking and abandoning, form remains whole and essence restored, becoming one with heaven—both without contrivance.

Heaven and earth, parents of the myriad things, are impartial in their nurturing and thus give birth to all things. United, they form bodies; scattered, they begin anew. Wherever they are, all is impermanent. Those who can shift essence move in harmony with transformation; returning to assist heaven is to restore and aid its spontaneity.

*Lü’s Annotation*:
What life cannot provide is not what sustains it. What knowledge cannot address is what lies beyond knowing. Generally, those who do not nurture form do so because their pursuit of life is excessive, not because external things are insufficient. Those who lose life do so because they drive themselves toward death, not because form has departed from life. From this, we know that nurturing form is ultimately insufficient to preserve life—yet how can one abandon the world? One cannot escape the need to sustain form. To escape sustaining form, one must engage with the world without entanglement. Without entanglement, one is upright and balanced; upright and balanced, one ceases to regard form and affairs as burdens and exchanges life with the other. What is called "exchanging life" is to attain subtlety. Affairs are not worth abandoning; life is not worth forsaking. Not abandoning affairs burdens one with labor; not forsaking life depletes one’s essence. When form is whole and essence restored, virtue returns to its origin.

The myriad things receive essence from heaven and form from earth. Their union is how we come to have bodies—when heaven and earth intermingle, the myriad things transform in harmony. Their scattering is how things begin anew—when male and female unite, the myriad things are born. United, essence is not depleted; scattered, it can shift. Not depleting preserves essence; shifting returns it to its source within heaven. Thus, what is called preserving life—is it not wondrous?

*Liu’s Summary*:
Life is what I possess; destiny is ordained by heaven. Those who fully comprehend life understand heaven; those who fully comprehend destiny never forget humanity. What life cannot provide, one lets go—thus, whatever can be let go of, one does not pursue. What knowledge cannot address, one accepts—thus, whatever can be accepted, one seeks nothing beyond. Without seeking, without contrivance, one merges with the Dao.

Yet in the world, the burdens of form, worldly affairs, and external things are ever entwined and inseparable. Form is not the Dao; the world is not the self—entanglement lies in external things. Examining these three through principle, their burdens are easily shed. If burdens can be cast off, what does the world mean to me? If the world can be abandoned, what do I envy in form? Without attachment to the world, without envy of form, one attains the utmost in comprehending life and destiny.

*Xun’s Paraphrase*:
"Returning to assist heaven" rhymes with "shifting" (汀移). "Shifting" echoes the earlier "exchanging" (更), meaning one can renew and shift with it. Life originally possesses this essence, but toiling in worldly affairs nearly loses it. Now, by exchanging life, one regains this essence. What grants me this life is heaven; if I can preserve this life with heaven, this is "assisting heaven."

*Liezi asked Guanyin*:
The perfected person moves unseen without obstruction, walks through fire without heat, traverses the realm of the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?

*Guanyin replied*:
This is the preservation of pure qi. It does not belong to the ranks of knowledge, skill, or boldness. Let me tell you: all that has appearance, form, sound, or color is merely "thing." How can things be distant from one another? How can one attain what lies beyond?

Before form, there is only color—this is the origin of things. Without form, it comes to rest. Without transformation, it cannot be exhausted. Those who grasp this exhaustively are still bound to things. Those who attain and rest in it—where will they dwell?

To abide by the unexcessive measure and conceal oneself within the boundless principle, to wander amidst the beginning and end of the myriad things—unifying their nature, nurturing their qi, harmonizing their virtue to commune with the origin of things. Those who attain this preserve heaven in its entirety, their spirit whole without fissure—how could things find entry?

Consider the drunkard who falls from a carriage: though the fall be swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He knows not the riding, nor the falling; life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast. Thus, he is awakened to things yet unbroken by them. If one preserved by wine may yet be thus, how much more so one preserved by heaven? The sage conceals himself in heaven, and thus nothing can harm him.

The avenger does not break the sword Mo Gan, though it be wielded by one with vengeful intent; the flying shard of tile elicits no resentment. Thus, the world attains equilibrium—hence no wars of conquest, no punishments of slaughter—all arises from this Dao.

Not to open the heaven within man but to open the heaven of heaven: opening heaven gives rise to virtue; opening man gives rise to harm. To be unwearied in one’s heaven, not neglectful of the people—this is to approach the genuine.

**Guo’s Annotation:**
His mind is empty, thus he can master the fullness of things; attaining perfect accord, nothing is impossible. It is not that things come to him—how can things be distant from one another? Only the mindless alone transcend. All are beings of form and color, yet none surpass him; ever wandering at the utmost limit, he is not constrained by things. Abiding by the unexcessive measure, he rests within his allotted portion. Concealed within the boundless principle, he darkly harmonizes with transformation, ever renewed. Wandering amidst the beginning and end of the myriad things—this is the utmost of things. To unify their nature is to adorn it; to nurture their qi is to deplete it if directed by the mind. To harmonize their virtue is to sunder it with things. All things arise of themselves.

Like the drunkard who falls from the carriage, he loses what he knows—not through nature, but through absence of mind. The sage conceals himself in heaven, thus does not peer beyond the bounds of his nature. Hence it is said: "Concealed." Gan Jiang and Mo Ye may be wielded against a foe, yet the avenger does not seek to break them—this is because he is without mind. A flying shard of tile may strike a man, yet none resent it—this is because it is without intent. Thus, the world attains equilibrium; all inequity arises from intent. The Dao of no-intent is vast.

Without thought, one knows—this is opening heaven. With thought, one responds—this is opening man. Opening heaven is the movement of nature; opening man is the function of knowledge. When nature moves and encounters things fittingly, one forgets all else—thus virtue arises. When knowledge functions, one follows stimuli, striving without cease—thus harm arises. To act by the nature of heaven is to preserve human principle; the afflictions of the people, the rise of artifice, ever lie in the function of knowledge, not in the movement of nature.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
The revolutions of heaven and earth, the transformations of the myriad things—what are they if not qi? Truly, if one preserves pure qi, there is no obstruction, no heat, no peril—nothing strange in this. It is simply the attainment of utmost emptiness—how could knowledge, skill, or boldness compare?

Consider the dragon: when its body coalesces, it ascends and coils without limit; when its form disperses, it enters the formless, unseen. This too is but qi. All that has appearance, form, sound, or color is merely "thing." How can things be distant from one another? How can one attain what lies beyond? Before all, there is only color—this is the origin of things. Before this, there was no thing; with color, things have come to be. How can one speak of preserving pure qi or wandering in utmost emptiness?

The origin of things is formless—without appearance, form, sound, or color—thus it comes to rest. Without transformation, it cannot be exhausted. Those who grasp this exhaustively are still bound to things. Those who attain and rest in it—where will they dwell? To abide by the unexcessive measure is to be neither bright nor dim, fittingly attuned without excess. Concealed within the boundless principle, beginning and end are reversed—this cannot be exhausted. Wandering amidst the beginning and end of the myriad things—this is the so-called origin, formless and at rest, without transformation.

To unify nature is not to divide it; to nurture qi is not to deplete it; to harmonize virtue is to commune with the origin of things. Thus, nature is cultivated, virtue returned, and one becomes one with the creator of things. Formless, one preserves wholeness without flaw—how could things find entry?

One preserved by wine does not let life and death, terror and dread enter his breast—how much more so one preserved by heaven? Thus, nothing can harm him. There is ever one who wields death; when men encounter it, it is like Gan Jiang or a flying shard—this is why the world attains equilibrium. Though states be conquered, there are no wars of conquest.

Opening heaven gives rise to virtue—this is to forget all, to be without knowledge or action. Opening man gives rise to harm—this is to have intent, to have eyes for things. To be unwearied in one’s heaven is to open it alone; not to neglect the people is to fear what they fear. If the people know this, they approach the genuine.

】 Jiang Yu 【

The perfected person does not depart from the genuine. When the genuine resides within, what among the myriad things could suffice to alter it? This is why one may enter water without getting wet, enter fire without being burned, or ascend heights without trembling. Guan Yin spoke of this as the guarding of pure qi—pure, that is, in the sense of never diminishing one’s spirit. Not diminishing one’s spirit is what it means to be genuine.

Those who are cunning, resolute, and intent on overcoming things harbor suspicion within and rely on surging qi without. Even a single limb or fragment of their body would not find room between heaven and earth—how then could water or fire come near? Only when pure qi is guarded within do knowledge and perception revolve back, sight and hearing withdraw inward, and none can discern whether it is water or fire, for one has become one body with them. This is why there is nowhere one may enter without finding ease.

Forms, images, sounds, and colors are all called "forms." All things, arising from nonbeing into being, must begin with movement and thus generate form. Before the Great Simplicity, form and substance first take shape; yet the Great Simplicity does not reach the Great Beginning—how then could it attain the Prior? Only one who treats things as things yet is not a thing may reach the Prior. This is what Laozi meant by "there is a thing, undifferentiated and complete." All that has form belongs to creation; when form ceases, transformation halts.

One who attains this Dao and exhausts it departs from form and transcends transformation, reaching the Prior where things dissolve and right and wrong vanish. Even standing alone in correctness is insufficient to name it. It is supremely easy to know, supremely easy to practice, and does not violate the natural patterns of the myriad things—this is no profound measure. One who meets it does not see its head, and following it does not see its tail—this is the thread without beginning. Moving through the myriad things, the myriad things receive it to wax and wane, fill and empty; its bounds cannot be exhausted. Roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things, one unifies one’s nature and does not waver, nurtures one’s qi and does not deplete it, embraces one’s virtue and does not scatter it. Thus can one ascend and roam with the creator of things—this is to penetrate what things are created from. Penetrating what things are created from, one can become heaven. Becoming heaven is to become spirit. Guarding wholeness in heaven is for one’s spirit to be without flaw. When one’s spirit is without flaw, the guarding of pure qi is firm—how could things find entry?

Spirit gives birth to form, and form completes spirit. Without spirit, form cannot arise; without form, spirit cannot be perfected. Spirit desires not to diminish its wholeness, yet it may be diminished by having knowledge. Form desires not to harm its completeness, yet it is harmed by opposing things. Yet spirit gives birth to form—one who cherishes form does not necessarily guard spirit; one who contains spirit, however, cannot be opposed by things.

The drunkard, falling from a carriage, remains unaware—this is how spirit is preserved whole. When spirit is whole, life and death, terror and dread cannot move one’s center. Though one may fall from a carriage, it can only harm one’s form, not one’s spirit. This is what it means to encounter harm differently from others—thus, though injured, one does not die. Yet such wholeness is attained by wine-drinkers through drowning their knowledge in intoxication, not through knowing and forgetting emotion. As for one who is not drunk, knowledge remains clear and is not forgotten even for a moment. Thus, though one may not die, one may still be injured. But if one truly knows non-knowing, even water and fire cannot scorch or drown—how much less a fall from a carriage? This is the wholeness guarded by heaven, which nothing can harm. The sage conceals this—it is the Dao of long life and enduring vision.】

The *Comprehensive Meaning* states:
To originate is to be without form, without beginning;
To cease is to be without transformation, without end.
How could things ever reach an ultimate limit?
Yet those who speak of "transcending transformation and preserving spirit" mean that external things do not obstruct the substance of the Great Void.

Fangzi adds:
"Virtue gives life" refers to the heavenly virtue emerging in tranquility;
"Bandits give life" refers to the six bandits plundering one another—
Thus heaven may be constant,
But it cannot be offered;
Man may be cautious,
But he cannot be negligent.

Confucius, traveling to Chu, came upon a hunchbacked man in the forest catching cicadas with a sticky pole as easily as if picking them up. Confucius said, "You are skillful indeed! Is there a Dao to this?"
The man replied, "I have a Dao. After five or six months of piling pellets, if I can stack two without dropping them, I will lose only a few; if I can stack three without dropping them, I will lose only one in ten; if I can stack five without dropping them, it is as easy as picking them up. When I position my body, I stand as still as a tree stump; when I hold my arm, it is as steady as a branch of withered wood. Though the world is vast and things are many, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, nor do I waver, nor do I allow the myriad things to distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?"
Confucius turned to his disciples and said, "Where intention is undivided, it approaches the divine—does this not describe the hunchbacked elder?"

Cui Zhuan states, "橛株拘 refers to a stake preventing a tree." Originally, *疑于神* was written as *凝*; considering the context below, it should be *疑*. Here we follow Dongpo’s emendation.

Guo’s commentary: "Stacking two pellets without dropping them demonstrates the steadiness of the hand—thus, in catching cicadas, losses are but a trifle. Stacking three without dropping them, losses grow fewer still; stacking five without dropping them, steadiness reaches its perfection, and nothing is lost. Positioning the body like a stake, holding the arm like a branch of withered wood—this is the height of stillness. How could one fail? To say one forgets that in order to gain this is to speak of relinquishing one thing to attain another."

Lü’s commentary: "To grasp the Way of catching cicadas is to understand the preservation of pure qi—its undivided intention is precisely like this."

Jiang Yu: "Learning to catch cicadas by stacking pellets: pellets, as objects, can roll and turn, yet one can pile them without dropping them. From this, one may infer the stability of his stance, the precision of his arm, and the undividedness of his intention. With such skill, catching cicadas becomes as easy as picking them up. The cicada’s wings are light and swift, yet to seize them as if plucking them—this is to advance in the Dao. How could this belong to the realm of mere cleverness? Thus he says, 'I have a Dao.' When he positions his body like a stake and holds his arm like a branch of withered wood, he forgets himself within; when he does not allow the myriad things to distract him from the cicada’s wings, he forgets things without. With both self and things forgotten, how could he fail to catch cicadas? Thus Confucius sighs that his undivided intention approaches the divine. When intention is divided, spirit is depleted; when intention is unified, spirit is whole. This is what is meant by preserving pure qi—nothing more.

The cicada, though dwelling in lowly filth, aspires to lofty purity. It sings in season, seeks no sustenance, and makes no demands—thus it embodies the Way of form and dhyāna, which is why it is chosen as the object of pursuit."

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, "I once crossed the deep pool of Shang. The ferryman handled the boat as if by divine skill. I asked him, 'Can one learn to handle a boat?' He replied, 'One can. Those skilled in swimming can do so after a few attempts; as for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease.' I questioned him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?"

Confucius said, "Those skilled in swimming can do so after a few attempts because they forget the water. As for divers who have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease—they regard the depths as if they were hills, and a boat’s capsizing as if it were a cart rolling backward. Though countless dangers lie before them, none enter their minds. They are at ease no matter where they turn.

Those who wager with tiles play skillfully; those who wager with hooks grow cautious; those who wager with gold grow anxious. Their skill is the same, yet their concern for external things makes them clumsy within. All who are burdened by externals are inwardly inept."

Guo’s commentary: "Though things have their nature, they must be taught and practiced before they become second nature. One who regards the depths as hills thus sees a boat’s capsizing in the deep as a cart rolling backward on a slope. Though capsizings and reversals are many, he remains unperturbed, for his nature is at ease—whatever he encounters, he is composed. Observing those who wager: the more valuable the stake, the more their minds grow anxious. Those who wish to nurture life and preserve their inner being—should they not refrain from such burdens?"

Lü’s commentary: "From the ferryman’s handling of the boat and the wagering of gold, we see that one who preserves form and restores essence does not abandon the world or neglect life—only one whose spirit is without flaw can achieve this."

Jiang Yu: "Water bears the boat. To learn the ferryman’s skill in handling a boat yet fail to learn his essence is to fall short of his mastery. One practiced in water, adept at swimming, though untrained in boating, may yet match the ferryman’s skill. But one unaccustomed to water, trembling in fear, ever dreading drowning—how could he handle a boat? Thus, those who take water lightly can be taught; those who forget water can do so after a few attempts. As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease—this is because they have not only forgotten water but also forgotten the boat. Thus, they are at ease no matter where they turn.

Crossing water is like traversing peril; guiding the world is like steering a boat to ferry others to a place of no difficulty. Only one with the Dao can lightly forget worldly affairs, moving through myriad changes without ever being hindered. In governing the world, such a one is at ease.

The more valuable the stake, the more the mind grows anxious; the more anxious the mind, the more wit dulls and skill is lost. Skill lies within, while things lie without—once skill is mastered, why grow clumsy over external concerns? If one insists on valuing externals, even treating gold as mere tiles, one may remain skillful in all things, yet the stake will never leave oneself. But this cannot be forced—only one with the Dao achieves it naturally.

At first, one may be skillful; in the end, one may grow clumsy. Thus, skill may appear clumsy, for if one’s cleverness does not linger, one may not perceive the weight of the stake and may yet act skillfully in all matters. Is not the cleverness prized by the world in truth the greatest clumsiness? Hence it is said, 'Great skill appears clumsy.'"

Tian Kaizhi visited Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said, "I have heard that Zhu Shen studies the arts of longevity. You have associated with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?"

Tian Kaizhi replied, "Kaizhi merely sweeps the courtyard with a broom—what could I have learned from the Master?"

The Duke said, "Tianzi, do not be modest. I wish to hear it."

Kaizhi said, "I have heard the Master say, 'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd: he watches those who lag behind and whips them.'"

The Duke asked, "What does this mean?"

Tian Kaizhi said, "In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who lived in the mountains, drinking from streams, and did not compete with others for profit. At seventy, his complexion was still that of a child. Unfortunately, he encountered a hungry tiger, which killed and ate him. There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented the gates of the wealthy, running errands for all. At forty, he suffered from internal heat and died.

Bao nurtured his inner being, yet the tiger devoured his outer form; Yi nurtured his outer form, yet illness attacked his inner being. These two did not whip those who lagged behind."

Confucius said, "Do not retreat into hiding, nor stand exposed in the open—dwell in the center. If one attains the right measure in these three, one will reach the utmost. On perilous paths, if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another, and none will dare venture out without a large escort—is this not wisdom?"

The things people fear most lie in their bedding and at their meals, yet they fail to guard against them—this is their error.

Guo’s commentary: Those who study focus on the mean and adhere to one method, but when they exceed proper bounds, they fail to attain the balance of thorough caution. "Whipping those who lag behind" means correcting what falls short. "Hiding" is already inward, yet to further "enter" is excessive inwardness; "exposure" is already outward, yet to further "go out" is excessive outwardness. Like withered wood, one should be without intent and stand in the center. If these three attain their proper measure, one will reach the utmost, and reality will align with the name. On the road, if one in ten is killed, people grow greatly fearful, yet the harms of lust and desire lead them to death, and none avoid them—this is the gravest error.

Lü’s commentary: Shan Bao was one who preserved his form yet lost his life, while Zhang Yi was one who had excess in external things yet neglected his form. Bao turned inward and hid, Yi turned outward and exposed himself—both acted with intent. Standing in the center without intent is not like those who lag behind.

Following the text: Those who have already advanced need no whipping; only those who lag behind require it. This illustrates that one who has cultivated the inner need not further refine it but should cultivate the outer, while one who has cultivated the outer need not further refine it but should cultivate the inner. "Standing like withered wood" means standing in the center, neither entering nor going out.

The sacrificial officer, Xuan Duan, approached the pen to address the pig, saying: "Why do you hate death? I will raise you for three months, fast for ten days, purify for three, and lay you on white straw, placing your shoulders and rump upon the carved sacrificial platter—will you accept this?" Planning for the pig, he said: "Better to eat chaff and糟 and remain in the pen." Planning for himself, he said: "If in life one attains the honor of high rank and in death rests upon painted shields amid woven mats, one accepts it." For the pig, he rejects it; for himself, he embraces it. What makes the pig different?

Guo’s commentary: The desire for abundance leads to the loss of the body—this principle applies equally to humans and beasts.

Lü’s commentary: Planning for the pig, he rejects it; planning for himself, he accepts it. Is it that he values himself less than the pig? It is the world that burdens him. Only by abandoning the world and relinquishing life can one be free of burdens.

Yi Du’s interpretation: For the sacred turtle, he would rather drag its tail through the mud than leave its bones to be venerated; for the pig, he would rather eat chaff and糟 in the pen than be placed upon the carved platter. This means that going against the principles of life and nature to dwell in wealth and honor is worse than following them and delighting in poverty and lowliness. Zhuangzi compares himself to the sacred turtle and the worldly to the pig—his meaning is clear.

Explanation of terms: *Xuan Duan* refers to a ceremonial cap. *Fang* means to feed. *Dun* is a shield. *Ju lǚ* refers to woven mats used to bundle things. In the *Zuozhuan*, a chef was killed for undercooking a bear’s paw and placed in a basket—this is the same idea.

Fang Sishan’s note: *Dun dun* in the *Lu Shi Yin Yi* states the character should be *chūn*, a painted funeral carriage for carrying coffins. *Ju* should be *zōu* (zǐ guān), and *lǚ* should be *lóu* (lì jiǔ), referring to burial in woven mats. The *Liji*’s *Tan Gong* chapter states: "For the burial of the Son of Heaven, they apply *zōu* mud to the dragon-painted *chūn* with an outer coffin," and "they set up *lóu* screens." *Zōu* means to gather wood, cover the coffin, and apply mud. *Chūn* refers to the dragon patterns. The text’s meaning is that those who pursue wealth and honor in death would not exchange it for the pig’s life—how much less should humans be inferior to pigs?

Duke Huan was hunting in the marsh when Guan Zhong drove his chariot. They saw a *kui* spirit. The Duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked, "What did you see?" Guan Zhong replied, "I saw nothing." The Duke returned, sighing and muttering, and fell ill, taking to his bed for days without emerging. A Qi scholar named Huangzi Gao’ao said, "The Duke has harmed himself—how can the *kui* harm him? When pent-up *qi* scatters and does not return, it causes insufficiency; if it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger; if it descends but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness; if it neither rises nor descends but lodges in the center of the body, at the heart, it causes illness." Duke Huan asked, "Then are there *kui* spirits?" He replied, "There are. In the depths, there is *Shen*; in the hearth, *Lüzao*; in the door’s lintel, *Jihu*. The clamor of the inner walls and the dust of the eastern corner house *Beie*; in the northwest, *Longyue*. In the water, there is *Wangxiang*; on the hills, *Shan*; in the mountains, *Kui*; in the wilds, *Fanghuang*; in the marshes, *Weiyi*." The Duke asked, "What does *Weiyi* look like?" Huangzi said, "*Weiyi* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes with a vermilion cap. As a creature, it hates the sound of thunderous chariots and, upon hearing it, clutches its head and stands. Those who see it are nearly doomed to greatness." Duke Huan laughed heartily and said, "This is what I saw!" He then straightened his robes and cap, sat with Huangzi, and before the day was out, his illness had vanished.

Guo’s Annotation: [This passage speaks of how distress arises from delusion, obscuring clarity, while the resolution of affliction restores one’s nature, revealing the principle.]

Lü’s Annotation: [Here it is said that anxiety and doubt summon demons—though they possess no power to harm, one harms oneself. When doubt dissipates, illness, though still present, departs of its own accord. Thus, to be whole in Heaven and allow nothing external to intrude is to ensure nothing can harm one.]

Personal Insight: [Duke Huan’s illness stemmed from doubt; when Gao Ao dispelled his delusions, the delusions ceased. This reveals that the presence or absence of demons arises from the mind’s arising and ceasing, and that the mind’s likes and dislikes are but human delusions. When delusion departs, likes and dislikes return to their true nature; when the original mind is clear, arising and ceasing no longer depend on external forces. Today, those who chase delusion and lose their true nature all fall ill at the sight of demons. Gao Ao’s words—*"You harm yourself; how can demons harm you?"*—serve as an excellent remedy. This is akin to the child’s heartache vanishing when the clay figurine is cast aside, or the suspicion of illness fading once the bow’s shadow is gone. Though the recorded demon names seem fantastical, the *Kongzi Jia Yu* also mentions *Kui* and *Wangxiang*, and the *Zuozhuan* recounts the tale of the *Xin Gui*, while the *Shi* records the Historian’s presentation of jade to the Lord of Haochi—demons are not entirely nonexistent. Yet when yin and yang each finds its proper place, neither harms the other. As the classics say, *"When the world follows the Dao, its demons lose their numinosity."*]

Master Jisheng raised fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked, *"Are the cocks ready?"*
*"Not yet,"* he replied. *"They are still hollow and arrogant, relying on their qi."*
After another ten days, the king asked again.
*"Not yet,"* he said. *"They still respond to shadows and reflections."*
After another ten days, the king inquired once more.
*"Not yet,"* he answered. *"Their gaze is still fierce, and their qi remains overbearing."*
After another ten days, the king asked again.
*"Nearly so,"* he said. *"Though other cocks may crow, this one remains unchanged. From a distance, it resembles a wooden cock. Its virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee instead."*

Guo’s Annotation: [This passage speaks of nurturing to the point of wholeness, rendering one invincible externally—how much more so when one is whole within?]

Zhang Zhan’s Annotation: [This analogy of raising cocks illustrates the cultivation of life: being hollow and relying on qi is to be empty yet self-important; responding to shadows and reflections is to grasp at fleeting perceptions. A fierce gaze and overbearing qi seek victory over others. When the cock crows yet remains unchanged, it no longer reacts to provocation, forgetting both victory and defeat. When it appears like a wooden cock and no other cock dares respond, one realizes that the perfection of virtue not only stills one’s own mind but also prevents others from harboring intentions. This is the pinnacle of cultivation.]

Jiang Yu’s Annotation: [The cock is a creature of wood, and wood rubbing against wood ignites—hence its combative nature. Hollow arrogance and reliance on qi lead to aggression; though no opponent is present, it seeks conflict relentlessly. How can such a cock avoid fear, let alone ensure victory? Thus, when asked if it is ready to fight, the answer is *"Not yet."*
Still responding to shadows and reflections means it reacts to the mere sight of a shadow’s movement. A fierce gaze and overbearing qi mean it chases illusory perceptions, reacting to every provocation. When an opponent appears, it musters its ferocity to confront it—yet a fierce gaze unsettles the spirit, and overbearing qi disturbs the mind. Though it does not engage, its heart is stirred within, and its spirit falters without, merely suppressing rather than resolving its agitation. Hence, *"Not yet."*
Later, though the cock crows, it remains unchanged, appearing like a wooden cock—its virtue is complete. Internally, it forgets its qi; externally, it forgets its form. Though other cocks may crow in challenge, it does not hear them. How does this differ from withered wood? Thus, the virtue of non-contention reaches its zenith—*"complete."*
No cock in the world can rival it; all turn and submit, as Laozi subdued the Hu barbarians or Confucius won over his disciples. The heart is the Crimson Palace; in birds, it is the Vermilion Bird. The sage nurtures it within, ensuring sufficiency without greed, satiety without contention—thus none in the world can contend with him. The common man merely tends to it externally, leaving the Vermilion Bird perpetually hungry, soaring across the eight directions in pursuit of gain. Without greed, it cannot fill its desires; without contention, it cannot satisfy its cravings—until death brings an end. How lamentable!]

Personal Insight: [*"Are the cocks ready?"* should follow the *Liezi*, reading *"Are the cocks ready to fight?"* The *Zhuangzi* text is likely abbreviated.]

Confucius observed the waters of Lüliang, which plunged thirty *ren* deep, with foam stretching forty *li*, where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and assumed he was in distress, seeking to drown himself. He sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he strolled beneath the embankment. Confucius followed and asked him,
*"I took you for a demon, but you are a man. May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?"*
*"No,"* the man replied. *"I have no Dao. I began with what was innate, grew with my nature, and matured with my destiny."*

The swimmer said, *"I enter with the whirlpool and emerge with the surge—following the Dao of water without imposing my will. This is how I tread it."*

Confucius asked, *"What do you mean by 'beginning with what was innate, growing with your nature, and maturing with your destiny'?"*

The man replied, *"I was born on the hills and at ease on the hills—this is my innate endowment. I grew up in the water and at ease in the water—this is my nature. I do not know why it is so, yet it is so—this is my destiny."*

---

**Guo’s Annotation:**
*"The swirling vortex where water grinds and spirals inward is the 'whirlpool' (齊); the surging swell where it coils and bursts forth is the 'surge' (汨). To follow the Dao of water without imposing one’s will is to yield to the water, not to oneself. This passage shows that when one possesses a particular ability and entrusts oneself to it, nothing in the world is difficult. Applying this effortless mastery to the Dao of life and generation—where could one not pass through?"*

**Zhang Zhan’s Annotation:**
*"Lüliang is in present-day Pengcheng Prefecture. The *Erya* states, 'A rock that severs the water is called a *liang* (梁).' 'Beginning with what was innate' means abiding in one’s original simplicity; thus, one is at ease wherever one encounters. 'Growing with one’s nature' means following the principles of nature, so nothing opposes it. 'Maturing with one’s destiny' refers to the principle of spontaneity—what cannot be known, yet knowing that it cannot be known, is called destiny."*

**Lü’s Annotation:**
*"Following the principles of nature and destiny, one enters with the whirlpool and emerges with the surge, yielding to the Dao of water without imposing one’s will—this is why one can tread it. But where even soft-shelled turtles and alligators cannot swim, one must harmonize one’s virtue with the utmost reaches of things to traverse it. Only then is there nowhere one cannot tread and be at ease. 'Born on the hills and at ease on the hills' refers to innate endowment, which is not a matter of nature but of human effort. 'Growing up in the water and at ease in the water' refers to nature, which is one’s particular ability. If one lacks this nature and merely practices, one may acquire the skill but never surpass what others cannot achieve."*

**Jiang Yu’s Annotation:**
*"Water-born creatures do not swiftly change their nature. Humans, too, are born on land and at ease on land. Yet the man of Lüliang could swim where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not—this was his particular nature. Only because he possessed this nature could he grow up in the water and be at ease in it. Though at ease in the water, if he did not reach the point of 'not knowing why it is so, yet it is so,' he would not have truly followed the Dao of water without imposing his will—and thus would not have attained such mastery. His words ultimately return to destiny. Such a man is what the text calls 'one who has attained it to traverse great rivers.'"*

**Editor’s Note:**
*"The man of Lüliang treading water and singing—his marvel lies in following the Dao of water without imposing his will, so the water cannot harm him. If one conducts oneself in the world by following the Dao of others without imposing one’s will, others will not harm one either. Extending this principle to all interactions—where could one not preserve wholeness? 'Beginning with what was innate' means forming habits that become second nature; 'growing with one’s nature' means..."*

The long-standing nature formed by habit becomes spontaneous. When it reaches the point of destiny, one forgets the water and does not know why it is so, yet it is so—this is called preserving wholeness in Heaven. This chapter aligns with the meaning of "being in accord with things without harming them," and these words may well serve as the standard for navigating the world.

Ziqing carved wood into a *ju*. When the *ju* was completed, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of spirits. The Duke of Lu saw it and asked, "What technique did you use to make it?" He replied, "Your servant is but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Nevertheless, there is one thing: when I was about to make the *ju*, I never dared to deplete my *qi*. I first fasted to still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer dared to entertain thoughts of reward, rank, or emolument. After five days, I no longer dared to entertain thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forgot that I had four limbs and a body. At that time, I had no thought of the court; my skill became concentrated, and external distractions dissolved. Only then did I enter the mountain forest to observe the natural forms of the trees. When I saw one whose shape matched the *ju*, I set my hand to it—otherwise, I would stop. Thus, I joined Heaven with Heaven. Is this not why the vessel seems the work of spirits?"

**Annotations:**
*Ju*: A wooden percussion instrument resembling a crouching tiger, with twenty-seven serrated teeth on its back, used to mark the end of music.

---

Guo’s Commentary: "When one regards the court as nothing, all longing and admiration vanish. Skill becomes concentrated, and external distractions dissolve—all matters outside one’s nature are cast aside. Only then does one select the appropriate material and set one’s hand to it, joining Heaven with Heaven without departing from spontaneity. This is how one fully follows the marvel of things, so the work seems the work of spirits."

Lü’s Commentary: "If the vessel seems the work of spirits because of this, then if external distractions have not dissolved and one seeks to wander among the creations of things, one cannot attain such mastery."

---

Dudu’s Note: "The craftsman’s name was Qing. The *ju* is a musical instrument, also called *yu*, shaped like a crouching tiger. He never depleted his *qi* but emptied himself and stilled his mind. He did not entertain thoughts of reward, rank, or emolument, thus forgetting profit. He did not entertain thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness, thus forgetting fame. Forgetting that he had four limbs and a body, his spirit became whole and united with Heaven. Thus, he regarded the court as nothing, and the distractions of external matters dissolved. Only then did he enter the mountain forest to observe the shapes of the trees. When he found one that matched the *ju*, he set his hand to it without forcing it. He extended his own Heaven to join with the Heaven of the thing—this is why the vessel seems the work of spirits."

Dongye Ji presented his charioteering to Duke Zhuang. He advanced and retreated in perfect alignment, turned left and right in perfect arcs. The Duke thought even Wen could not surpass him and had him drive a hundred circuits and return. Yan He encountered him and entered to see the Duke, saying, "Ji’s horses are about to fail." The Duke remained silent and did not respond. Soon after, the horses indeed failed and returned. The Duke asked, "How did you know?" He replied, "His horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence I said they would fail."

Guo’s Commentary: "The horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence they failed. This shows that even the most fitting cannot be exceeded."

Lü’s Commentary: "Ji’s charioteering was superb, yet he could not avoid failure once the horses’ strength was exhausted. If one acts according to the Dao yet strives for what life cannot provide, or knows what cannot be known, how can one succeed?"

Bixu’s Note: "His driving aligned with the compass and square like weaving patterned silk. When made to turn back, he completed a hundred circuits, each retracing the same path. Han Ying said, 'Shun was skilled in employing people; Zaofu was skilled in employing horses. If one does not exhaust the people, there will be no idle people; if one does not exhaust the horses, there will be no idle horses. The stumbling and failure of horses arise from excessive restraint; the exhaustion of people’s knowledge arises from harsh governance. Thus, those who understand destiny do not strive for what cannot be known or done.'"

Guan’s Insight: "Holding the reins like weaving, the two outer horses danced—this illustrates the meaning of 'even Wen could not surpass him.' Weaving involves gathering threads here to form patterns there, just as a skilled charioteer holds the reins above while the horses harmonize below. 'A hundred circuits' means driving in circles without cease—hence it was known they would fail. When strength is exhausted yet one still demands more, not only will the horses fail, but the man will also be worn out."

Gongchui turned his hand and surpassed the compass and square. His fingers transformed with things without his mind interfering, so his spirit’s terrace was unified and unobstructed.

Guo’s Commentary: "Even with Gongchui’s skill, he still relied on the compass and square—this speaks of following the ease of things."

Lü’s Commentary: "Gongchui turned his hand and surpassed the compass and square, meaning his movements matched the compass and square without revealing the traces. His fingers met things as if transformed by nature, without waiting for the mind’s deliberation to align with the square and circle. Only thus is the spirit’s terrace unified and unobstructed. This is the proof of not interfering with the mind. When one forgets the feet, the shoes fit; forgets the waist, the belt fits; forgets right and wrong, the mind fits; does not change inwardly nor follow outwardly, the affairs one guards fit. One begins with fitting and never ceases to fit—this is the fitting that forgets fitting."

Guo’s Commentary: "When all parts of the body are fitting, one forgets the body entirely. Right and wrong arise from not fitting. Where one encounters and finds peace, there is no change or following—thus knowledge fits. Yet one who knows fitting is still not truly fitting."

Bixu’s Note: "Forgetting the feet and waist are minor matters; forgetting right and wrong is the root. How much more so for minor matters? Inwardly and outwardly, all one encounters is fitting and constantly fitting—this is the fitting without fitting. Gongchui’s marvel is also like this."

There was a man named Sun Xiu who came to the gate and reproached Master Bian Qingzi, saying, "Xiu lives in his village and is not seen as cultivated. When facing difficulties, he is not seen as brave. Yet when tilling the fields, he does not meet with good years; when serving his lord, he does not meet with the times. He is cast out by his village, expelled by his district—what crime has he committed? Is it Heaven? Is it Xiu’s misfortune to meet with this destiny?"

Master Bian said, "Have you alone not heard of the Perfect Man’s way of conducting himself? He forgets his liver and gall, leaves behind his ears and eyes, wandering in vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roaming in freedom..."

Sun Xiu left, and Master Bian entered to sit. After a while, he looked up to the heavens and sighed. His disciples asked, "Master, why do you sigh?"

Master Bian said, "Earlier, Sun Xiu came, and I told him of the Perfect Man’s virtue. I fear he was startled and thus fell into confusion."

The disciples said, "Not so. If Sun Xiu’s words were right and yours were wrong, he naturally could not be confused. If Sun Xiu’s words were wrong and yours were right, he was already confused when he came—how is this your fault?"

Master Bian said, "Not so. Once, a bird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu, delighted, prepared a grand feast to welcome it, playing the *Nine Shao* to entertain it. Yet the bird grew sorrowful and fearful, refusing to eat or drink. This is called nourishing a bird with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, float upon rivers and lakes, and feed on whatever it encounters—then it would be at ease even on level ground.

Now, Sun Xiu is a man of simple understanding and little learning. When I told him of the Perfect Man’s virtue, it was like burdening a mouse with chariots and horses or delighting a sparrow with bells and drums. How could he not be startled?"

【*Kuan* (款) and *kuan* (窾) both mean "small aperture"; *qi* (启) means "to open." *Kuan-qi* (款启) refers to limited understanding.】

Guo’s Annotation: [*To forget the liver and gall, to leave behind the ears and eyes, to obscurely entrust oneself to the natural—all that is not true nature is but dust and grime. All that is done by the self is the work of non-action. To follow one’s nature and act is not to rely on doing; to let things grow of themselves is not to govern their growth. To nourish a bird with what nourishes a bird is to suit its own convenience.* This chapter speaks of those who skillfully nourish life: each follows the suitability of their nature to reach the utmost.]

Lü’s Annotation: [*The purport of this chapter lies in preserving life to attain spiritual wholeness, essence restored, and unity with Heaven. What Sun Xiu does is the very opposite. When he heard these words, he could not but grow anxious, casting fearful glances and refusing to eat or drink. Thus, the chapter concludes with the analogy of the seabird.*]

Personal Insight: [*To delight in Heaven and know fate is to be without sorrow; to fathom principle and exhaust nature—what doubt remains? What Sun Xiu describes stands in stark contrast to the teachings of Heavenly mandate and human nature. Thus, Master Bian instructed him in the conduct of the Perfect Man: to forget the liver and gall is to empty the inner self; to leave behind the ears and eyes is to still the outer. Only then may one wander beyond the dust and grime—all the affairs and traces of the human world are but dust and grime. To depart from these is to make every action, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying, the work of non-action. This is what is called "transcending the world while within it." What is there to rely upon? What growth is there to govern? Now, you adorn your knowledge and cultivate your person until you shine like the sun and moon, yet in grasping at worldly calamities, you may—if fortunate—preserve your form without incurring Heaven’s wrath. How then could you have leisure to resent Heaven? This is why I deeply warn you of your delusion and urge you to return to true understanding.*]

New Compilation: [*The Way of preserving life is known only to the Perfect Man. To speak of it to one who is not a Perfect Man is like nourishing a bird with grand feasts and the *Nine Shao*—how could it not be startled? This is why Master Bian feared Sun Xiu’s confusion. Zhuangzi composed this to awaken the world to the principle of preserving life, yet the worldly cannot be abruptly told of this Way. Thus, he concluded with Master Bian’s lament, embedding his meaning within it. If Zhuangzi may be said to have fully expressed his intent, then so be it.*]

**General Remarks on the Chapter:**
This chapter begins by discussing life, which all people value. Some harm it through excessive nourishment, while life lies with Heaven and cannot be defied; others destroy it through reckless action. If one comprehends these two extremes, one can preserve life and rest content in fate—this is the Way of deep roots and firm foundations, of long life and enduring vision. Thus, all that life does not require, all that fate cannot endure, must be kept at a distance. Know what is not one’s proper duty, and hold fast to the purity and wholeness of Heaven, which cannot be parted from even for an instant.

Consider the drunkard’s indifference to chariots or the swordsman’s disregard for the *Mo Gan*—what room is there for concern? The cicada-catcher and the boatman exemplify mastery through accumulated practice; the shepherd fears the path and drives his flock from behind to avoid danger. The tale of the pig warns those who covet rank, while the *xuan*-bird parable shows how many are deluded by the inability to obscure the false. The subsequent analogies, varied as they are, all serve to expound the theme of life—truly earnest and incisive.

What nourishes human life has its fixed allotment: it is not gained by seeking nor lost by neglect. The troubles of life often arise unexpectedly, neither foreseen nor evaded, neither outwitted nor escaped. One must cultivate human affairs to accord with Heavenly principle, seeking only to be without remorse. Longevity or early death, fortune or misfortune—these are not to be eagerly pursued. Whether one retreats to mountain valleys for pure cultivation or serves in the court to manage affairs, whether inwardly nourishing life or outwardly governing others, it is all but the beautification of human relations and the promotion of teaching, ultimately converging in the principle of the Dao and virtue.

Yet how many truly know life’s weight and heed the warnings in the comforts of bed and board? Only when one appears like a wooden rooster, yet when employed, never exhausts their strength—only then have they grasped the principle of life and nearly attained the conduct of the Perfect Man.

The chapter concludes with the seabird of Lu, which grew sorrowful at the sound of bells and drums. When the outer nourishment is lost, the inner nature is harmed. If one knows how to nourish, one knows how to preserve. The key lies in understanding one’s own life, extending this to benefit all things, and harmonizing with them. To forget suitability is to find no suitability unmet.

**Chapter Twenty: "Mountain Trees"**

In the mountains, Zhuangzi came upon a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. When asked why, he replied, "It is of no use." Zhuangzi said, "This tree, by being useless, has fulfilled its Heaven-appointed years."

Zhuangzi then emerged from the mountains and lodged at the home of an old friend. Delighted, his friend ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, "One can caw, the other cannot—which should we kill?" The host replied, "Kill the one that cannot caw."

The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi, "Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, fulfilled its Heaven-appointed years. Today, our host’s goose, by being useless, met its death. Where would you, Master, choose to stand?" Zhuangzi laughed and said, "I would stand between usefulness and uselessness. Yet to stand between usefulness and uselessness is still to resemble without being it—thus one remains entangled in trouble.

"As for those who ride the Dao and float upon virtue, it is otherwise: they bear neither praise nor blame, now a dragon, now a snake, transforming with the times, never clinging to one form. Ascending and descending, they take harmony as their measure, floating upon the Ancestor of the Myriad Things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by things—how could they be ensnared? This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.

"But as for the passions of the myriad things and the conventions of human relations, it is not so: union invites separation, completion invites destruction, integrity invites injury, honor invites criticism, action invites loss, worth invites scheming, and worthlessness invites deceit. How can one be certain of anything? Alas! Disciples, take heed—only in the realm of the Dao and virtue is there refuge."

【Tradition: Sima comments, "This refers to matters that can be practiced."】
Guo's Annotation: ["If one were to dwell here, one would still not escape entanglement. As for those who ride the Dao and float freely—Zhuangzi also dwells therein. How could one be certain of anything? Since certainty is unattainable, one cannot rely on a single method. Only those who transform with the times can devise change while remaining perpetually unobstructed."]

Lü's Annotation: ["That sages and worthies are often unaccommodated by the world stems from the entanglement inherent in talent. Thus, Zhuangzi repeatedly warns against the burdens of talent. Yet fools and the unworthy, unable to make themselves heard, are often destroyed—how can one be certain that not being talented ensures escape? The trees of the mountain and the master’s geese share the same fate. Therefore, one seeks to dwell between talent and lack of talent, yet this still resembles the Dao without being the Dao. For the essence of the Dao does not cling to either extreme, nor does it reside in the center. Thus, even dwelling between talent and lack of talent does not escape entanglement. But those who ride the Dao and float freely bear neither praise nor blame, cannot be valued or disdained, are now a dragon, now a snake, and cannot be fixed as sage or commoner. Their waxing and waning transform with the times, now ascending, now concealing, harmonious yet never discordant—how could this depend on dwelling between talent and lack of talent? It is merely floating upon the Ancestor of the Myriad Things. The Ancestor of the Myriad Things may be called the Father of All. If one treats things as things yet is not treated as a thing by things, how could one be ensnared? As for the passions of the myriad things and the conventions of human relations, union invites separation, completion invites destruction, integrity invites injury, honor invites criticism, action invites loss, worth invites scheming, and worthlessness invites deceit. How can one dwelling between talent and lack of talent be certain of escaping entanglement? Those who seek to be free of entanglement must find refuge only in the realm of the Dao and virtue."]

Xu Xi’s Note: ["Separation, destruction, injury, criticism, and loss—all arise from human reluctance to rejoice in one another. The worthy are envied and schemed against, while the unworthy are deceived. Such is the bitter taste of this shallow and vicious world."]

Jilao of Shinan met the Lord of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Jilao asked, "Why does my lord appear troubled?"
The Lord of Lu replied, "I have studied the Way of the former kings and cultivated the legacy of my predecessors. I reverence the spirits, honor the worthy, and act with filial devotion, never straying for even a moment. Yet I cannot escape misfortune—this is why I am troubled."
Jilao said, "My lord’s method for dispelling misfortune is too shallow. The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, resting in caves and grottos—this is their stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is their caution. Though hungry and thirsty, even in dire straits, they still keep their distance from the rivers and lakes while seeking food—this is their steadfastness. Yet they cannot escape the calamities of nets, snares, and traps. What crime have they committed? Their pelts are their undoing. Is the state of Lu not my lord’s pelt? I wish for my lord to carve away his form, shed his pelt, wash his heart, and relinquish desire, then wander in the wilds where no one dwells. In the southern lands of Yue, there is a settlement called the Kingdom of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and guileless, with few private interests and scant desires. They know how to act but not how to hoard, give without seeking reward, do not know where righteousness leads, and do not understand where ritual guides. Wild and uninhibited, they tread the great square of the Dao. In life, they find joy; in death, they are buried. I wish for my lord to abandon your state, cast off custom, and walk alongside the Dao."
The Lord of Lu said, "That path is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what am I to do?"
Jilao replied, "Do not be haughty in form, do not linger in residence—let these be your carriage."
The Lord of Lu said, "That path is secluded and remote, with no people. Who would be my neighbor? I have no provisions, no food—how could I reach it?"
Jilao said, "Lessen your lord’s expenditures, reduce your lord’s desires. Though you have no provisions, you will find sufficiency. Cross the river and float upon the sea. Gaze into the distance, and you will not see its shores. The farther you go, the more boundless it becomes. Those who see you off will turn back from the shore, and you will be far from them. Thus, those who possess others are burdened, and those who are possessed by others are troubled. Yao neither possessed others nor was possessed by them. I wish to free you of your burdens, dispel your troubles, and wander alone with the Dao in the boundless realm. When a square boat crosses the river and an empty boat drifts into it, even a hot-tempered man would not grow angry. But if there were a person aboard, he would shout to make way. If unheard the first time, he would shout again, and if still unheard, he would curse. Before, he was not angry, but now he is—because before, the boat was empty, and now it is not."

When empty before, now full—if one can empty oneself and wander through the world, who could harm them?

Guo’s commentary:
To possess a self and take pride in one’s state, though one may harbor ten thousand cares and honor worthies while pursuing good deeds, one’s anxieties only deepen. Thus, let there be no self, no state, and entrust all to spontaneous transformation. To send one to Nanyue is to choose its remoteness from Lu. If each follows their own pace and every person treads their own path, then the ten thousand directions are attained—is this not vast? To leave one’s state and abandon customs is to sweep clean the heart’s chamber.

You, however, take this as truly sending them to Nanyue. "Form’s haughty obstruction" refers to lingering and stagnation; "form harmonizing with things" and "heart transforming with things" describe relying on things to bear oneself. If you can reduce expenditures and curb desires, nothing will be lacking. Crossing rivers and floating on seas without seeing their shores is a metaphor for cutting off passions and desires to a great distance. If you wish to sever them, the people will each return to guard their proper place, and you will be far from them—transcending and standing alone above the ten thousand things.

Those who "possess others" do so for private gain.

One who "sees possession in others" is one who is enslaved by others. Thus, though Yao possessed the world, he entrusted it all to the hundred officials and committed it to the ten thousand things without partaking in it—this is not "possessing others." Relying on the people and entrusting things without being enslaved by them—this is not "seeing possession in others." Those who wander in the boundless realm wish to be utterly free from the cares of state; though the world may change, their emptiness remains, and thus they avoid harm—this is one and the same.

**Lü’s Annotation:**
Those who take the state of Lu as their skin give rise to afflictions—this is the inability to forget one’s state. For if form is not abandoned, the state becomes a burden; hollowing out form is how one sheds the skin. If the heart is not pure, desires become a stain; washing the heart is how one sheds desire. Separating from man and entering Heaven—this is how one wanders in the wilds of no-man’s-land, where the state of established virtue and the realm of the Dao are founded. Its people are simple and desire little, untouched by refinement and unconcerned with hoarding. They supply what is sought when it is sought, yet do not expect repayment; they act with benevolence yet do not regard it as favor. Unaware of where duty leads, they do not value comings and goings; ignorant of ritual’s course, they act at will yet tread the great Way. What brings joy or sorrow does not cling to them, for they remain unchanged from beginning to end. Such is the state of established virtue. Yet those who cannot wander within it are merely fettered by state and custom. Abandoning virtue and discarding custom, one walks alongside the Dao—then the destination is reached without toil.

The Dao is near and utterly smooth, yet people regard it as distant and perilous because they are haughty in form and fail to yield, lingering in place without advancing. If one makes a chariot of formless haughtiness and non-lingering, and provisions of reduced expenditures and curbed desires, what hindrance could prevent arrival? Do you not see its shores? The boundless journey—those who see you off turn back at the shore, constrained by emptiness and daunted by its depth and remoteness, none dare proceed. From this point, you stand alone without peer, and none can follow. Is this not wandering? This is neither "possessing others" nor "seeing possession in others." Such was Yao’s way of being Yao.

The boundless realm and the state of established virtue are what the previous chapter called the "ancestor of the ten thousand things" and the "homeland of virtue and the Dao." Next, the discussion turns to the empty boat that strikes another yet arouses no anger. Those who ride the Dao and float through the world are likewise thus.

Duke Ling of Wei commissioned Beigong She to levy taxes and cast bells, erecting an altar beyond the outer gate of the capital. In three months, the bells were completed, suspended in upper and lower tiers. Prince Qingji saw this and asked, "What method did you employ?"

She replied, "In the space of oneness, I dared not impose any artifice. I have heard that once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity. How vast and unknowing! How careless and doubtful! How clustered and boundless! It sends off the departing and welcomes the arriving—those who come are not barred, those who go are not stopped. It follows the strong and unyielding, bends with the crooked and compliant, and relies on their self-exhaustion. Thus, though taxes were levied day and night, not a hair was harmed—how much more so for those who tread the great path?"

When Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food, Taigong Ren came to offer condolences, asking, "You nearly died, did you not?"

"Yes," Confucius replied.

"Do you detest death?"

"Yes."

Ren said, "Let me speak of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea, there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it flutters and drifts, appearing incapable. It flies only when drawn by others, perches only when pressed, never dares to advance first or retreat last, and never eats before tasting the leftovers. Thus, it is never expelled from the flock, and others never harm it. This is how it avoids disaster. The straightest trees are felled first, the sweetest wells run dry first. As for you, you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose impurity, and stride forth as if bearing the sun and moon—how could you escape harm?

Long ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast achieve no merit; those who accomplish destroy their names; those who succeed lose their integrity. Who can relinquish merit and fame to return to the common? The Dao flows unseen, dwelling where it is obtained without being named. Abide in purity, remain constant, and you approach madness. Erase your traces, discard your power, and do not seek merit or fame. Thus, no one blames you, and you blame no one. The perfected do not strive—why do you delight in this?'"

Confucius said, "Well said."

He severed ties with his acquaintances, parted from his disciples, and fled to the great marshes. Clad in coarse cloth, he ate the leavings of mulberry silkworms and wild chestnuts. Entering among beasts, he did not disrupt their herds; entering among birds, he did not disturb their flocks. Birds and beasts felt no aversion toward him—how much less would humans?

[Fēnfēn zhìzhì: Sima Biao explains this as a leisurely, unhurried demeanor. Pressed and threatened, he nested among the flock—Li Yun says this means he was squeezed among the birds, barely finding space to roost, so extreme was his avoidance of harm.]

Guo’s commentary: The sage has no preferences, neither hastening nor lingering, and his mind is free from fixed attachments. He does not dare to lead or follow but always abides in easeful centrality. In eating, he takes only what remains, content to follow things as they are. His conduct does not stand out, and he moves with the flock. Harm arises from the pursuit of knowledge and the scramble for advantage—this is why trees are felled and wells run dry. To scrutinize closely is to find minor differences and thus clash with the multitude. To merge in great sameness is to be without singularity in the world. Thus, what shines brightly is but the trace of profound obscurity.

He would lodge words to leave behind traces, so he used Chen and Cai as a pretext to convey his meaning. Those who rely on merit and fame as their accomplishment have never preserved their wholeness. Merit arises from the collective, so he returns it to the Dao, which moves dimly yet of itself. They all dwell in self-contentment—this is the conduct at hand, not something achieved through fame. Abiding in purity and constancy is likened to madness, for he moves without intention. Merit is accomplished by others, so power does not reside in him, and name and trace both vanish. Following his nature and yielding to others, each bears their own responsibility. Detached and without attachment, this is the perfected person.

Thus it is said: "The perfected do not strive." He severs ties with acquaintances and parts from disciples, relinquishing the world’s attachments. He does not disrupt herds or flocks, like plants and trees without intention, so birds and beasts do not fear him. This is the lodging of words to fully express the trust of utmost sincerity—where things find no ground for harm.

Lü’s commentary: *Fēnfēn zhìzhì*—though bustling, he is not disordered, seeming incapable yet not without ability. When drawn to fly or pressed to roost, he hesitates, compelled in movement and stillness. He does not dare to advance first or retreat last, neither emerging to display nor withdrawing to conceal. In eating, he does not taste first but takes only what remains, dwelling in the realm of non-contention. His conduct does not stand out, so he moves with others in the human flock. Knowing that the completion of merit and fame must bring loss, he abandons them to return to the multitude—this is the conduct of the man of great completion.

The Dao flows unseen, and when dwelling, none see his merit. When acting, none hear his name—this is virtue. Abiding in purity and constancy is likened to madness, a reckless and unrestrained course. Not pursuing merit and fame, he returns to the multitude. This is what is meant by "the man of the Dao can offer his surplus to the world."

The hardship of Chen and Cai—how to endure it was not for lack of means, but rather what knowledge could do nothing about. Those who study Confucius, if they do not understand what is meant by "not standing out in the ranks" and "being able to enter among birds and beasts," will scarcely avoid being burdened by the pursuit of merit and fame, walking as if beneath the sun and moon.

**Limited Insight:** The lines *"The Dao flows unseen, and when dwelling, none see his merit; when acting, none hear his name"* should be read with a pause after each couplet, their meaning then becoming clear. Guo Xiang, however, placed a commentary after the word *"unseen,"* leading later interpreters to follow suit. Only Lü Huiqing punctuated the lines as *"when dwelling"* and *"when acting,"* which is correct—*"merit"* should correspond to *"virtue,"* and *"name"* to *"unseen,"* harmonizing with the preceding text.

Confucius asked Zisang Hu, *"I was twice exiled from Lu, had my tree felled in Song, my traces erased in Wei, and was reduced to poverty in Shang and Zhou, besieged between Chen and Cai. I have endured these many misfortunes, yet my close relations have grown more distant, and my disciples and friends have scattered. Why is this?"*

Zisang Hu replied, *"Have you not heard of the man from Jia who fled? Lin Hui abandoned a jade worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a child on his back and flee. Someone asked, 'Was it for the sake of wealth? The child’s value in cloth is little. Was it for the sake of burden? The child’s weight is great.'"*

Lin Hui abandoned a jade worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a child on his back and flee—why? Lin Hui replied, *"That bond was forged by profit; this one is joined by Heaven. Those bound by profit abandon one another when pressed by poverty, calamity, or harm. Those joined by Heaven gather together when pressed by poverty, calamity, or harm. The distance between gathering and abandoning is vast indeed. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water; the friendship of the petty is as sweet as sweet wine. The noble grow closer through blandness; the petty grow estranged through sweetness. Those who unite without cause will part without cause."*

Confucius said, *"I respectfully receive your instruction."* He walked slowly, wandering freely, and returned home. He abandoned his studies, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer drew near to him—yet their affection for him deepened and advanced.

Another day, Zisang Hu said, *"When Shun was about to die, he truly grew cold. Yu said, 'Take heed! In form, nothing surpasses following; in emotion, nothing surpasses spontaneity. Following ensures no separation; spontaneity ensures no toil. Without separation or toil, there is no need to seek adornment to match one’s form. Without seeking adornment to match one’s form, one naturally does not depend on external things."*

The Guo commentary states: *"The friendship of the noble person rejects profit, hence its blandness; their Dao aligns, hence their closeness. The friendship of the petty person adorns profit, hence its sweetness. Profit cannot endure, hence it inevitably severs. Those who unite without cause are bound by Heaven’s ties; if union arises not from cause, then cause is insufficient to sunder it. Those who unite through cause must part through cause. That their affection deepened and advanced was because they abandoned adornment and embraced simplicity. Following form and yielding to emotion, they did not force themselves with profit. Form, unborrowed, remains ever whole; emotion, unforced, remains ever at ease. Not seeking adornment to match form is to proceed with uncarved simplicity. To be thus is to need nothing external, for unadorned sufficiency is complete."*

The Lü commentary states: *"Confucius studied yet did not grasp what was meant by 'Heaven’s ties.' He made learning and books his sole pursuit, so his interactions with the world were merely human unions. 'In form, nothing surpasses following'—following ensures no separation, hence union. 'In emotion, nothing surpasses spontaneity'—spontaneity ensures no toil, hence ease. Without separation or toil, one rests in the naturalness of their inherent quality, and their nature’s allotment is already sufficient. Why seek adornment to match form? Not seeking adornment to match form, one naturally does not depend on external things. This is the utmost realization of abandoning learning and discarding books."*

A personal observation: *"The character '待' has no dual meaning. If form follows and does not separate, it remains ever present. If emotion yields and does not toil, one’s nature remains ever at ease. What is meant by 'I' is thus attained. What need is there for ritual adornment? What reliance on external things?"*

Zhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his sandals with cords, and passed by the King of Wei. The king said, *"Why is the Master so weary?"* Zhuangzi replied, *"Poverty, not weariness. A scholar possesses the Dao and virtue yet cannot practice them—that is weariness. Worn clothes and tattered sandals are poverty, not weariness. This is what is called 'not encountering the right time.' Have you alone not seen the leaping monkeys? When they obtain nanmu, catalpa, or camphor trees, they grasp the vines, swing through the branches, and reign as kings among them. Even Yi or Feng Meng could not glance askance at them. Yet when they find themselves among thorny jujubes, trifoliate oranges, or wolfthorns, they tread cautiously, glance sideways, tremble, and quake. This is not because their sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened and lost their suppleness, but because their circumstances are unfavorable, insufficient to display their abilities. Now, dwelling among benighted rulers and chaotic ministers, how can one avoid weariness? This is like the heart of Bi Gan being carved out—a clear warning!"*

The Guo commentary states: *"When one encounters the right time and place, they can extend their skills, so even the archers of old could not harm them. When circumstances are unfavorable and one forces action, they suffer execution."*

The Lü commentary states: *"Though he spoke so boldly, he was not harmed—proof of his emptying himself to wander through the world."*

A doubtful note: *"Zhuangzi used the leaping monkeys as a metaphor for himself. Obtaining nanmu, catalpa, or camphor trees is like a noble person encountering the right time. Dwelling among thorny jujubes or wolfthorns refers to facing benighted rulers and chaotic ministers. Even if one wishes to avoid weariness, it is impossible. If one forces straight words and practices the Dao, the warning of Bi Gan’s carved-out heart is manifest."*

An oral exegesis: *"'大布' means coarse cloth; '緳' means a belt. '系履' means mending worn sandals with cords. '惫' means illness. '揽' means to grasp. '蔓' means to entwine. '王长' describes their spirit flourishing and their will fulfilled. '不柔'—the character '加急' above emphasizes the monkeys’ agility."*

Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning on a withered tree with his left hand and striking its branches with his right, he sang the airs of the Yàn clan. The melody had its structure but not its measures, its sound but not its modes. The sound of wood and the sound of man blended so piercingly that they resonated in the hearts of others. Yan Hui stood with hands clasped, turned his gaze, and watched. Confucius, fearing that Hui would broaden his own path and reach greatness, or love him and reach sorrow, said, *"Hui, not to accept Heaven’s diminishment is easy; not to accept man’s benefit is difficult. There is no beginning that is not an end. Man and Heaven are one. Who is it that sings now?"* Hui said, *"May I ask what 'not to accept Heaven’s diminishment is easy' means?"* Confucius said, *"Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, poverty, and constraint—these are the movements of Heaven and Earth, the outpouring of the turning of things. To speak of going along with them is to say one moves with them."*

A minister dare not abandon his duty, for even in holding to the Way of ministerhood, it is thus—how much more so in awaiting Heaven’s decree? What is meant by *"not to accept man’s benefit is difficult"*? Confucius said: *"At first, one is employed in all four directions, and ranks and emoluments arrive without end—yet what things deem profitable is not one’s own. My fate lies beyond me. The noble man does not steal; the worthy man does not pilfer. If I were to take these, what would I be? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the swallow. Where its eyes deem unsuitable, it will not even glance, though the fruit fall before it—it abandons it and flees, so wary is it of men. Yet it nests among men, where altars of soil and grain endure. What is meant by *'there is no beginning that is not an end'*?*

Confucius said: *"Things transform in their myriad forms, yet one knows not who succeeds them. One knows where they end; one knows where they begin. To align oneself and await them is all. What is meant by *'man and Heaven are one'*? Confucius said: *"There is man, and there is Heaven; there is Heaven, and there is also Heaven. That man cannot possess Heaven’s nature—this is why the sage, at ease in his embodiment, flows with the passing and comes to rest."*

*(Guo’s commentary: To the coming of Heaven’s diminishment, one only responds with equanimity—thus it is easy. Yet the adventitious gifts of things cannot be restrained. What is now called a beginning was yesterday’s end, so what is called a beginning is precisely an end. This speaks to the boundlessness of transformation. Man and Heaven are one—both are of spontaneity.)*

To follow one’s spontaneity is to sing without the singer being the self. The movements of Heaven and Earth cannot be escaped; to flow with them is to be unknowing and unperceiving, yet in accord with the Emperor’s decree. Wherever one is, all is at ease—without taking diminishment as diminishment, one awaits Heaven yet suffers no loss. Resonance and response extend in all directions, thus one may harness the advantages of lofty and great things. Yet this is not seeking and taking; rather, one’s mandate lies beyond. It is said: in human life, there must be a mandate that engages with things externally—unlike clay or stone, which are confined to form and substance alone. To steal is to take privately; the attainment of rank and emolument by worthy men and gentlemen is not private taking, but merely receiving. Like the swallow that flees men yet enters human dwellings, this is called wisdom. How much more so the perfected person, who is mysteriously one with all under Heaven—thus all under Heaven delight in exalting him without weariness, joining together to establish altars for him. This is why not receiving benefit from others is so difficult. Day and night succeed one another without end; thus to align oneself and await them is to harbor no anxiety. All that is called Heaven is luminous, acting without contrivance, being spontaneous. To speak of spontaneity is to speak of spontaneity—how could man intentionally possess this spontaneity? It is spontaneity alone. Thus it is said: *nature*. Therefore the sage, at ease and without self-importance, embodies transformation and flows with it.

*(Lü’s commentary: The airs of the Yanyu clan are but the odes of the Yanyu clan—already without self, and if one extends this, one creates great love; if one cherishes the self, one creates sorrow. Not to receive Heaven’s diminishment is easy; not to receive others’ benefit is difficult. Now, to accept only Heaven’s diminishment—why extend the self to create greatness? Without beginning yet not without end, one aligns and awaits them. Man and Heaven are one—at ease, embodying the passing, and that is all. Why cherish the self to create sorrow? To know the singer of today is to know how beginning and end, Heaven and man, are all contained therein. The movements of Heaven and Earth cannot be halted by man; the outpouring of the turning of things cannot be closed by man. Not to receive Heaven’s diminishment is to flow with it, not daring to regard it as loss and flee. Even the way of serving as a minister does not dare to flee—how much less the way of awaiting Heaven? This is why not receiving Heaven’s diminishment is easy. Rank and emolument arrive together; if one receives what is advantageous from external things as benefit, how is this different from stealing? The gentleman, amidst the convergence of all directions, regards what is advantageous to things as not his own. "My mandate lies beyond"—thus he does not dare to receive and take. Like the swallow that flees men yet enters human dwellings, all under Heaven join together to establish altars for him, and this cannot be refused. This is why not receiving others’ benefit is difficult. To transform the myriad things without knowing who succeeds them is to be untransformed. How then can one know their beginning and end? There is man, and there is Heaven—both are Heaven alone. That man cannot possess Heaven’s nature—this is why there is man. To know it as Heaven is to be at ease, embodying the passing, and come to rest.)*

*(Oral Exegesis: The withered tree is the stalk; the withered branch is the switch—this is what the "Equalizing Things" chapter calls the "switch-branch." Without number, without rhythm; without gong or jue, not conforming to the five tones. To extend the self is to honor the self. To seek with the intent of honoring the self is to create boundlessness; to think with the intent of loving the self is to reach sorrow. "Man and Heaven are one"—all within me is Heaven’s principle. Not to receive Heaven’s diminishment is to be poor yet joyful; not to receive others’ benefit is to be rich yet not excessive. When Heaven’s diminishment comes, one cannot but be at ease—thus it is easy. When others’ benefit arrives, one wishes to decline but cannot—thus it is difficult. "Imprisoned and obstructed"—unable to proceed, yet if pushed, it does not leave. The outpouring of the turning of things, the coming and going of qi and destiny—all is Heaven. I too flow with it, too, and pour forth with it—thus it is said: "to flow with them," which is what is meant by "flowing with the times" and "flowing with the times to their limit." Even the ruler’s command cannot be disobeyed—how much less Heaven’s mandate? This is why not receiving Heaven’s diminishment is easy. "At first use"—when this thought first arises, all directions converge, and affairs follow without obstruction. Rank and emolument arrive from without—this too is the mandate of the times, thus it is said: "My mandate lies beyond." To receive emolument without merit is shameful to the gentleman, who regards it as stealing. Though I may wish not to take it, there are those who push it and cannot be refused—like Gongsun He, who wept upon being appointed minister. This is why not receiving others’ benefit is difficult. "Without beginning yet not without end"—though one does not know their beginning and end, one abides within the transformations of creation and awaits them. Man is born of Heaven, thus it is said: "There is man, and there is Heaven." Heaven too is created by the transformations of creation, thus it is said: "There is Heaven, and there is also Heaven." Nature is the nature of Heaven’s mandate; this nature is born with life. All that man’s nature possesses at birth is received from Heaven—how could man possess it himself? Thus the sage abides in it at ease, exhausting his life alone.)*

*(Supplementary Ink: To extend the self to the point of greatness is to go too far in extending the self; to love the self to the point of sorrow is to go too far in loving the self. Here, the principle of Heaven and man, diminishment and benefit, beginning and end, is expounded in one thread. Urgently, one must determine: who is the singer? Who is the one who equalizes things? Who is the angry one? Who is the "who"? Who can know this "who"? To know who receives and who does not receive, and to seek the truth to the end, one will see that there is no receiver, nor is there one who does not receive—yet Heaven’s decree is settled within me. If not Yanzi, who is sufficient to discuss this?)*

*(Brush Jottings: "Plowing open"—like plowing a field, the soil is loosened. Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, poverty and obstruction—all are the flowing of Heaven and Earth’s qi, the movement and outpouring that animates the myriad things and cannot be stopped. How can man escape it? One can only flow with it. The yiyi is a swallow—unable to keep up, without leisure.)*

The term "實" here aligns with the *Yijing*’s "seeking one’s own mouthful"—it is the substance of the altars of soil and grain, the time of the spring and autumn sacrifices to the altars. The noble person regards unearned rank and emolument as theft; how could he willingly take them? Yet what is ordained may leave him no choice. Thus it is said: "It is not of oneself." The mandate lies beyond. Like the swallow that perches where it ought not, though it spurns the morsel, it cannot but heed the gaze of others—its fear of men is extreme. Yet it cannot but dwell among them, for the time of the altars seems to drive it, leaving it no autonomy. The swallow comes at the spring sacrifice and departs at the autumn sacrifice, hence these words. Though the passage is not hard to understand, old commentaries are often mistaken; I have briefly clarified it.

---

Zhuang Zhou wandered into the thicket of Mount Diao-ling, where he saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet; its eyes measured an inch across. It brushed Zhou’s forehead and alighted in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said, “What bird is this? Its wings are vast, yet it does not fly far; its eyes are large, yet it does not see clearly.” He hitched up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada that had found a fine shelter and forgotten its body; a mantis, seizing the shade, struck at it, seeing only its gain and forgetting its form; the strange magpie, drawn by the advantage, saw only the profit and forgot its true nature. Zhuang Zhou started and said, “Ah! Things indeed entangle one another; the two creatures summon each other’s doom.” He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued him with curses. Zhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not leave his courtyard.

Lin Qie followed and asked, “Master, why have you been so withdrawn of late?”
Zhuang Zhou said, “I guarded my form and forgot my body. I gazed at muddy water and was lost in clear depths. Moreover, I have heard from the Master: ‘When you enter a custom, follow its ways.’ Now I wandered into Diao-ling and forgot myself; the strange magpie brushed my forehead; I wandered into the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature. The gamekeeper of the chestnut grove took me for a thief. That is why I have not left my courtyard.”

*(Sima [Biao] says: “Diao-ling is the name of a mound; *fan* means ‘thicket.’”)*

"A shift of an inch may turn back an inch—this is the greatness of Yin. Twisting and turning is called *shi*; Li Yun says *yi* means great, *shi* means hard to see, and thus one does not perceive. People linger—Sima [Biao] says this means waiting for an opportunity. *Sui* means curses. ‘Three months’ should likely be ‘three days,’ as the phrase *qingjian* suggests.

Guo’s commentary: Holding a leaf to hide oneself from the cicada, one forgets the form that the strange magpie saw. The eye can see, the wing can fly—this is the bird’s true nature. Now, seeing profit, it forgets this. Those who mutually seek profit always mutually burden one another. One who desires something from things will find things desiring something from them—this is what is meant by ‘things inherently burden one another; the two *kuang* summon each other’s doom.’ *Sui* means to question. To dwell in the human world is to encounter both level ground and peril. If one applies the form of level ground to this world without measuring what is fitting for this world, this is ‘guarding the form and forgetting the body.’ ‘Gazing at muddy water and being lost in clear depths’ means seeing that and not understanding it, thus using that to see oneself and nearly forgetting the way of reflection. ‘Entering a custom and following its ways’ means not violating its prohibitions. ‘Taking me for a thief’ means taking the questioning as theft.

Zhuangzi extends impartiality to all under heaven, so he often conveys meaning through words. Thus, he disparages Confucius, belittles Lao Dan, attacks the Three Sovereigns above, and laments the suffering of his own body below.

Lü’s commentary: Following the profit of the strange magpie and pursuing the desires of the ears and eyes is ‘guarding the form.’ Not knowing that the gamekeeper’s curses are enough to bring shame is ‘forgetting the body.’ Movement and engagement with things is muddy water; stillness and profound observation is the clear abyss. The perfected person is never for a moment lost in the clear abyss, but Zhuangzi speaks of this to show that roaming the world with emptiness—like his words to the King of Wei—though sufficient to avoid harm, still fears what others fear and cannot but act accordingly.

When Master Yang traveled to Song, he lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was honored, while the beautiful one was despised. Master Yang asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied, ‘The beautiful one considers herself beautiful, but I do not see her beauty. The ugly one considers herself ugly, but I do not see her ugliness.’ Master Yang said, ‘Disciples, take note: act with worthiness and discard self-regard. Where can you go and not be loved?’ (Sima [Biao] says: Master Yang is Yang Zhu.)

Guo’s commentary: The way of self-regard is never appropriate.

Zhang Zhan: Pride, arrogance, and self-praise are what the spirits do not support. Humbling oneself and following principle is what all under heaven delights in yielding to. With this, who can resist?

Xin Yi: Those who wish to preserve their nature and live out their Heaven-appointed years should forget their form externally. When the form is forgotten, what one attains and where one goes—how could there be anything not attained? This is why Master Yang valued the innkeeper’s servant’s words. ‘The beautiful one considers herself beautiful, but I do not see her beauty; the ugly one considers herself ugly, but I do not see her ugliness’—this is forgetting the form externally, so that beauty and ugliness are both forgotten. How could this not fulfill the feelings of preserving one’s nature? Thus, Zhuangzi speaks of this at the end of the chapter.

Jiang Yu: Beauty and ugliness arise from deluded perception. Honoring one and despising the other is not the true principle. What is detestable about the innkeeper’s concubine is not her beauty but her reliance on it, which leads to her being despised. What is admirable about the innkeeper is not his ability to despise the beautiful one but his not perceiving her beauty, and thus valuing her. If the innkeeper’s concubine did not rely on her beauty and discarded self-regard, then wherever she went, she would be loved. Laozi said, ‘When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises’—it is not that beauty is detestable, but that detesting it comes from knowing it as beauty.

General Observations: This chapter is titled after the mountain tree, echoing the meaning of the great *chu* and oak—both preserved their Heaven-appointed years by being useless. The argument is set against the goose killed for not cawing, showing that Master Nan Hua’s view of worldly conventions is well-considered.

That a tree preserves its life by being gnarled is certainly so, yet the longevity or early death, success or failure of things each depends on fate and what they encounter. One cannot say that uselessness is a rule for fortunate escape. Both usefulness and uselessness are entangled in traces; the middle path between them still involves confusion, for it resembles yet is not the true way. Thus, one cannot avoid entanglement unless one leaves these three behind, upholds the Dao and virtue, floats with things, moves with the times, transcends things and origins without entanglement, sheds the outer skin without disaster. Then the kingdom of great virtue is not far off and will come of itself.

Like an empty boat striking another—no anger arises. Like levying taxes without harming even a hair—all is met with a heartless response, and things respond in kind. The highest discourse: the hardship of Chen and Cai does not compare to the *yiyi* bird’s knowledge of the mantis and cicada, or the magpie’s unawareness of the sling and its bearer. These all dwell in usefulness but have not reached perfection, so they cannot avoid entanglement. Lin Hui abandoned his jade to carry the infant and flee. Emperor Shun ordered Yu to value form but follow the heart’s inclinations—thus knowing to honor Heaven’s bonds without relying on external things. Wearing coarse cloth and passing the King of Wei, striking a withered branch and singing to the Lord of Yan—this shows that dwelling in poverty is not exhaustion, and knowing the ease of reducing desires means others will come to benefit you. Dwelling in this has its way.

The conclusion—acting with worthiness and discarding self-regard—transcends the distinction between usefulness and uselessness and is truly the semblance of the Way."

Thus the true person does not dread repeated admonitions, urging the learner to advance another step beyond the pole’s tip.

**Chapter Twenty-One: Tian Zifang**

Tian Zifang was in attendance upon Marquis Wen of Wei. Several times he mentioned Xi Gong, and the Marquis said, “Is Xi Gong your teacher?”
Zifang replied, “No. He is a man from my village of Wuze. He speaks of the Way often and aptly, so Wuze praises him.”
The Marquis said, “Then have you no teacher?”
Zifang said, “I do.”
“Who is your teacher?”
Zifang said, “Dongguo Shunzi.”
The Marquis said, “Then why have you never mentioned him?”
Zifang said, “His way of being is this: his appearance is that of a true person, yet his nature is empty of Heaven’s artifice; he follows things while preserving his authenticity; he is clear yet accommodates others. When things lack the Way, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. How could Wuze be worthy of mention beside him?”
Zifang departed, and the Marquis was lost in thought all day, saying nothing. He summoned his minister to stand before him and said, “How distant indeed is the noble one of perfect virtue! At first, I took sagely wisdom and benevolent righteousness as the ultimate in words and deeds. But when I heard of Zifang’s teacher, my form dissolved and I did not wish to move; my mouth was sealed and I did not wish to speak. What I have learned is but a clod of earth. Truly, Wei has become a burden to me.”

*(Note: "lost in thought" renders the descriptive term; "clod of earth" renders "土梗," a figurative term for something insubstantial.)*

Guo Xiang’s commentary: Dongguo Shunzi’s appearance was the same as others’, yet he alone followed nature, empty and yielding to things. Thus his authenticity was never lost. The clarity of others suffers from excessive purity; his clarity accommodated things, making him one with Heaven. Clear and empty, he rectified himself, and the perversity of things dissolved of itself. “His form did not wish to move, his mouth did not wish to speak”—this was his self-awareness of his nearness. A “clod of earth” is not a true thing. “Wei has become a burden to me” means he knew that the most noble thing is to take human rank as a burden.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: His way of being was true, so his appearance was naturally that of a person yet of Heaven. The hearts of ordinary people never, for even a moment, cease to follow things; the true person is empty, following things while preserving authenticity. The clarity of ordinary people suffers from excessive scrutiny; the true person is clear yet accommodates things. When things lack the Way, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, so what he imparts does not lie in repeated admonitions; when others’ intentions dissolve, what they reform does not lie in the midst of action. Sagely wisdom and benevolent righteousness are but words and deeds; Zifang’s teacher embodied the Dao and its virtue. Seek them in conduct and they cannot be found, so his form dissolved and he did not wish to move; seek them in speech and they cannot be found, so his mouth was sealed and he did not wish to speak. This is not something learning can attain, so he knew what he had learned was but a clod of earth.

When Wenbo Xuezi traveled to Qi, he lodged in Lu. A man of Lu requested an audience, but Wenbo Xuezi said, “No. I have heard that the noble ones of the Central States are enlightened in ritual propriety but coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet him.”
When he returned to Qi and lodged again in Lu, the same man requested an audience. Wenbo Xuezi said, “Last time he sought to see me, and now he seeks to see me again—he must have some way to rouse me.”
He went out to meet the guest and, upon returning, sighed. The next day, he saw the guest again and, upon returning, sighed once more. His servant said, “Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why?”
He said, “I already told you: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual propriety but coarse in understanding the human heart. The one who saw me before advanced and retreated as if following a compass and square, moved with the dignity of a dragon or tiger. When he admonished me, it was like a son; when he guided me, it was like a father. That is why I sighed.”

Confucius met him but said nothing. Zilu said, “Master, you have long wished to see Wenbo Xuezi. Now that you have seen him, why do you not speak?”

Confucius said, “In such a man, the Way is present the moment one’s gaze falls upon him. There is no room even for words.”

Guo’s commentary: *[His advance and retreat follow compass and square; his bearing is as composed as a dragon or tiger. His steps coil and stretch, his traces meander. When he admonished me, it was like a son; when he guided me, it was like a father—such are the embellishments of ritual propriety. Seeing him and saying nothing, I already understood his heart. There is no room for words: the moment my eyes met his, my intent was conveyed, leaving no space for his virtuous resonance.]*

Lü’s commentary: *[Advance and retreat follow compass and square, so his dignity is meticulous in every turn. His bearing is as composed as a dragon or tiger, so his adaptability emerges in moments of ease. When he admonished me like a son and guided me like a father, he did not grasp me in the space between my brows—this is what is meant by ‘enlightened in ritual propriety but coarse in understanding the human heart.’ Such are the flaws of ritual propriety, and the people of Lu are especially prone to them. Dongguo Shunzi’s upright demeanor awakens things; Wenbo Xuezi’s gaze alone makes the Way present. This is how the sages and worthies of old interacted—was it not subtle indeed?]*

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, “When you walk, I walk; when you hasten, I hasten; when you run, I run; when you sprint, leaving all behind, I can only stare in your dust. Yet, Master—when you do not speak, others trust you; when you do not form alliances, others gather around you; when you have no vessels, the people dance before you. How is this so?”

Confucius said, “How can you not examine this? There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and the death of the person is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches—nothing in the world does not follow its pattern. Those with eyes and feet rely on it to accomplish their tasks. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish. All things are thus: they depend on it. Death depends on it, and life does too. Once I received this completed form, I did not change but awaited its end, responding to things and moving, day and night without pause, yet never knowing where it would conclude. Vague and formless, I accepted this shape. Knowing fate, I could not plan for what lay ahead. With each passing day, I age. To spend my whole life with you, only to lose you in the space of an arm’s length—is this not sorrowful? You cling to what is already gone. Seeking what is no more is like searching for a horse in a market long past. I have worn you as my garment, yet you have utterly forgotten me. Though you have forgotten, why should you worry? Even if you forget, there remains something in me that does not forget.”

Guo’s commentary: *[The heart takes death as death, thereby hastening its own demise. The swiftness of this death arises from sorrow’s self-destruction. Without sorrow, it would be nothing; with sorrow, the death of the heart is the greatest sorrow of all. All things follow the sun’s pattern—all are visible. The eye completes vision; the foot completes movement. Only what is unseen is considered perished, yet it never truly perishes. What depends on concealment is called death; what depends on manifestation is called life. In truth, there is no death or life. What cannot change from being to non-being receives its completed form, then transforms endlessly. Responding to things without intent, day and night without pause, it is ever-renewing, never knowing its end. Not taking death as death, it is as if perfumed by its own form. What more is there to do? Knowing fate is not bound to what lies ahead but moves with change—thus it passes. Change cannot be grasped or held. Though you cling to my arm, you cannot make it stay. If you mourn death, this too is cause for sorrow. Yet people do not mourn this—why mourn death alone? The market is no place to stop a horse. To seek what once was is to seek what cannot be regained. A person’s life is like a horse passing through the market—never pausing, the old and new succeed one another without cease, day and night. ‘Clinging’ means seeing what I see. What you see in me is ever-new, so what is past is already gone. How could you possess it? ‘Wearing’ means contemplating its presence. ‘Utterly forgotten’ means the past vanishes swiftly. You depart, and suddenly you think of me, always feeling you cannot keep up. You wear me as a garment, yet you too are utterly forgotten—it is the same for both. Whether worthy or sagely, none can halt this. What does not forget remains: it is nourished by daily renewal. Though you forget the old me, the new me has already arrived. It was never not me—why should you worry? Thus one can leave the俗 behind, transcend the dust, and merge with all things without obstruction.]*

Lü’s commentary: *[When you walk, I walk...]*

To hasten, to gallop—these can be pursued and overtaken. Yet when one attains trust without speech, harmony without alliance, and the people follow of themselves, advancing without knowing why—this is like one who flees in wild abandon, leaving all dust behind, while those who turn to look lag far behind.

The mind that has never known death does not recognize death. Only when the mind dies does the person die in turn—this is the greatest sorrow. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west; all things follow its course, yet only those with eyes and feet depend on it to accomplish their ends. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish—yet the sun itself knows neither existence nor extinction. Things depend on it for life and death, but what they depend on has never known life or death. Thus, my trust without speech, my harmony without alliance, my people’s spontaneous following—all come down to this alone.

If I were to receive my completed form and remain unchanged, awaiting exhaustion, acting in accord with things day and night without respite, then I too would depend on things for life, like all the myriad beings. How could I embody what I depend on and reach the point of not knowing why it is so? If I were to pass my days thus, unchanging, awaiting exhaustion—would that not be cause for sorrow? Indeed, there is no greater sorrow.

You seek the place where I flee in wild abandon, leaving all dust behind, yet find nothing—is this not clinging? What you cling to, I do not see. What I do not cling to—how could the human mind, which grasps or abandons, possesses or loses, ever find something to cling to? That has already vanished. To seek it as if it still exists is no different from searching for a horse in an empty market. The market is where horses pass through, not where they dwell.

I wear you, yet utterly forget you—thus, what is called "I" no longer exists. You wear me, yet utterly forget me—thus, what is called "you" no longer exists. Why then should you worry about utter forgetting? Though you forget the old me, what is not forgotten remains. Thus, the one who flees in wild abandon, leaving all dust behind, can be seen.

Following the Root says: "I clasped arms with you, yet lost you—from that moment, there has been no step where I did not accompany you. I have shown you this Way all my life, yet now you say it is unattainable. It is as if we never clasped both arms, only one, and then lost each other—is this not cause for sorrow?

What you speak of is but the fleeting appearances of me that you see."

Seeing is but seeing—yet that Master exists unto himself. He has already attained perfect purity and emptiness, while you seek him as though he were something substantial, like searching for a horse in the market. The market is indeed where horses are sold, yet how can horses be constantly present there? As the *Book of Songs* says: "In the central path, there are tiles." The central path is the road through the courtyard, for the market where horses are sold must have a road to allow the horses’ entry and exit. The *Book of Han* records that west of the Jianzhang Palace lay a central path spanning dozens of *li*. Yang Xiong’s *Preface to the "Rhapsody on the Imperial Hunt"* speaks of "sweet dew descending in its courtyard, sweet springs flowing through its path," and Ban Gu’s *Rhapsody on the Western Capital* says, "before the central path, behind the Great Pond"—all referring to this same "path." *Fu* means to wear or bear. My bearing your words and your bearing my words—both should be utterly forgotten. Yet I fear Yan Yuan will worry he may never attain this. Still, why should you worry? Within forgetting, there remains that which is not forgotten. What is forgotten is attachment; what is not forgotten is the utmost truth. If you completely forget my old teachings, then the attainment of no-attainment becomes true attainment, and what is called "not forgotten" resides precisely here.

Confucius visited Lao Dan. Lao Dan had just bathed and was letting his hair dry, standing still as though he were not human. Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he saw him and said, "Was I deluded, or is it truly so? Just now, Master, your form and body stood like withered wood, as if you had left things behind and stood apart from others in solitude." Lao Dan said, "I let my mind wander in the beginning of things." Confucius asked, "What do you mean?" Lao Dan replied, "The mind is blocked and cannot know; the mouth is shut and cannot speak. Let me try to explain it to you. It approaches utmost yin, so still and silent; it approaches utmost yang, so blazing and bright. Stillness and silence emerge from Heaven; blazing brightness arises from Earth."

The two of Heaven and Earth intermingle to form harmony, and from this all things are born. Some take this as their guiding principle, yet none see its form. The ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness, the alternation of darkness and light—each day transforms, each month changes. There is action, yet none see its work. Life has its source of sprouting; death has its place of return. Beginning and end stand in opposition, yet without origin, none know where it ends. Is this not the ultimate?

Confucius said, "May I ask about wandering in this state?"

Lao Dan said, "To attain this is the utmost beauty, the utmost joy. Having attained the utmost beauty, one wanders in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfect Person."

Confucius said, "I wish to hear the method."

Lao Dan replied, "Beasts that feed on grass do not resent changing marshes; creatures born in water do not resent changing streams. They undergo small changes yet do not lose their great constancy. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight do not enter their breast. Thus, the world and the myriad things are unified in the One. If one attains this unity and becomes one with it, then the four limbs and hundred parts of the body become mere dust and grime, while life and death, beginning and end, become like day and night—nothing can disturb them. How much less could the distinctions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune intrude? Those who discard servitude do so as if casting off mud and mire, knowing the body is nobler than servitude. Nobility lies within oneself and is not lost amid change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have never had an end—who could trouble the heart of one who has already become the Dao? Such a one is freed."

Confucius said, "Master, your virtue matches Heaven and Earth, yet you still rely on profound words to cultivate the mind. Of the ancients, who could surpass this?"

Lao Dan said, "Not so. Water, when poured, acts without contrivance, yet its nature is spontaneous. The Perfect Person, in relation to virtue, does not cultivate it, yet things cannot depart from it. Like Heaven, which is naturally high; Earth, which is naturally thick; the sun and moon, which are naturally bright—what cultivation is needed?

Confucius departed and told Yan Hui, "In my relation to the Dao, am I not like a vinegar fly? How slight is the Master’s unfolding of my covering! I did not know the great completeness of Heaven and Earth."

Guo’s commentary:
To be "zhé" is to seem not of human stillness and desolation in their utmost—having left things and departed from others to stand alone. Only when mind and body are absent do external things depart. At the beginning, there was nothing, then suddenly there was existence, roaming in the origin of things, and only then does one realize that things do not act but exist of themselves. The heart is troubled, the mouth agape—this is to urge Confucius to seek beyond words and meanings. As for "discussing," it is but an attempt to discuss yin and yang to approximate the formless of earlier times. I dare not be certain. "Issuing from Heaven, emerging from Earth" speaks of their intercourse. No visible structure marks its form, yet it is so of itself. "Changing by day, transforming by month" never clings to the old. No sign of its work is seen, for it is so of itself and thus without work. Birth sprouts from what has not yet gathered; death returns to dispersion—this is what is meant by "meeting it, one does not see its head; following it, one does not see its tail." Attaining the utmost beauty and roaming in the utmost joy—there is no beauty or joy in them. Death and life are but small changes. Knowing them as small changes, one does not lose the great constancy; thus joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness do not enter the breast. Knowing the body is nobler than a servant, one discards it like dust. If one knows that the changes of death and life are all within the self, then what is noble is the self, and the self moves with change—thus nothing is lost. Is one who has already become the Dao freed from this? This is what is called "suspended liberation." Lao Dan said that Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, all do not cultivate or act yet attain of themselves. The "vinegar fly" is the midge in the jar. Confucius said that his completeness compared to Lao Dan’s was like the jar compared to Heaven and Earth.

Lü’s commentary:
Before things began to be, in rising, sitting, speaking, or silence—what was not roaming in the origin of things? The heart is troubled, and thus it is not what knowledge can know; the mouth is agape, and thus it is not what words can express. To "discuss" it is not to reach its utmost. Yin and yang intermingle to form harmony, and things are born. Whether distant as the year or near as the day, whether external as the myriad things or internal as the single body, all possess this. Some take it as their structure, yet no form is seen. Growth and decay, change and transformation—it is thus and no more. Birth sprouts, death returns; beginning and end are without end—it is thus and no more. What was earlier called the origin of things is likely this. What the world calls beauty and joy is not the utmost beauty and joy. Only by attaining this does one reach the utmost beauty and joy. The beast’s ease in the marsh, the fish’s ease in water—these are small changes that do not lose the great constancy of marsh and water. One who attains this and roams in it—nothing in the world is not unified and the same. Thus death and life cannot disturb it, let alone the trifles of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune. Knowing the body is nobler than a servant, what is noble is within the self. Though small changes occur, how could one lose what is noble for the sake of what is base? The boundlessness of the myriad things—how could it burden the heart? Is one who has already become the Dao freed from this? This is the reason.

One who can preserve the Dao wholly is thus able to preserve fate wholly—when fate is preserved, there is no greater joy. The Dao is the utmost beauty in the world; fate is the utmost joy of the myriad things. The utmost beauty emerges from the Dao yet cannot be seen when beheld; the utmost joy emerges from fate yet cannot be grasped when sought. One who enters the Dao can thereby preserve fate; one who possesses beauty can thereby possess joy. These two cannot be fully attained except by the perfected person. Thus it is said: to obtain the utmost beauty and roam in the utmost joy is to be a perfected person.

The *Blue Void* says:
The withered tree, detached from things—this describes one who conceals essence and stores spirit. Forsaking companions, standing alone—this describes one who severs duality and enters the vast. Roaming in the origin of things, never departing from its source.

To imitate knowledge is to weary the heart; to desire speech is to stammer the mouth. Departing from the heart and forgetting words—this comes close. The solemn yin qi descends below; the blazing yang qi ascends above. The two forces intermingle and harmonize, and the myriad things wondrously transform—this is called having a guiding principle. Yet no form is seen, no signs appear; its ebb and flow follow number, its obscurity and brightness follow constancy—this is called having creation and action. Yet no effort is discerned, no function perceived. In life, it sprouts from the indistinct; in death, it returns to the profound darkness. Without beginning, none know its origin; without end, none know its limit. If not for this Dao, what could serve as the master and lord of things?

Confucius again asked how one roams in this. To study the Dao—what is there to gain? To gain its utmost beauty and utmost joy is all. Regarding death and life, it is like the beast’s ease in the marsh, the fish’s ease in water—a fleeting, minor change. Why lament it?

The world is a crucible that fuses the myriad things into one. Viewed from what they share, even one’s own hundred limbs are but stench and rot. This life and death are like waking and dreaming—how much more so all else?

Thus, viewing the reins of governance and the trappings of rank is like the beast’s shift of marsh or the fish’s shift of water—this is what is called "external transformation while the inner remains untransformed." Nobility lies within me; it has never ceased to be mine. Its joy knows no bounds—how could there be suffering? It is like water, drawn and poured, ever flowing and beneficent—what need is there for contrivance? The perfected person’s virtue and power spread far and wide—what need is there for cultivation or regulation? It is like the height of heaven, the depth of earth, the brightness of sun and moon—what need is there for refinement?

Therefore, the Master compared himself to a jar or a gnat, casting off all coverings to recognize the great wholeness of heaven and earth.

Zhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke said, "In Lu, there are many Confucians but few who follow your Way."

Zhuangzi replied, "Lu has few Confucians."

The Duke said, "The entire state of Lu wears the garb of Confucians—how can you say there are few?"

Zhuangzi said, "I have heard that Confucians wear round caps to know the seasons, square shoes to know the earth’s forms, and jade pendants at their belts to act with caution when matters arise. Those who possess the Dao may not wear its garb, and those who wear its garb may not know the Dao. If you truly believe otherwise, why not issue a decree throughout the state: 'Those who lack this Dao yet wear its garb shall be put to death'?"

The Duke issued the decree for five days, and no one in Lu dared wear the Confucian garb—save for one man, who stood at the palace gate in full Confucian attire. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs. Though the questions shifted a thousand ways, his answers never faltered.

Zhuangzi said, "In all of Lu, there is but one Confucian—can this be called many?"

---

Guo’s commentary: *One whose virtue is full within does not adorn the outer.*
Lü’s commentary: *Zhuangzi often borrowed Confucius’ questions to disciples of Laozi to show that so-called sagely wisdom does not exhaust the utmost Dao. Without these words, scholars would have no way to know the true worth of revering Confucius.*

Baili Xi’s rank and emoluments did not enter his heart, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The Lord of Yu did not let life and death enter his heart, so he was able to move others.

Guo’s commentary: *One who is self-content within preserves all things without.*
Lü’s commentary: *Whether in small matters like Baili Xi’s rise to power or great ones like the Lord of Yu’s influence, none who let external things enter their hearts have ever reached such heights.*

When the Lord of Song was about to have a painting made, all the court artists arrived, bowed, and stood in attendance. Half had already prepared their brushes and mixed their ink, but one artist arrived late. He strolled in unhurriedly, without haste, and did not stand after bowing. The Lord sent someone to observe him and found him in his quarters, stripped to the waist, legs splayed like a winnowing basket.

The Lord said, "He will do—this is a true painter."

Guo’s commentary: *One who is inwardly sufficient is at ease in spirit and settled in mind.*

King Wen was observing at Zang when he saw an old man fishing. Yet his fishing was no fishing—he held the rod not to catch fish, but because fishing was his way of fishing.

The old man’s fishing was his constant way. King Wen wished to raise him and entrust him with governance, yet feared his ministers and elders would not accept it. He wished to let the matter rest, yet could not bear that the people would be left without a ruler. Thus, at dawn he gathered his ministers and said: *"Formerly, I dreamed of a worthy man, dark of complexion and with a full beard, riding a dappled horse with one red hoof. He called out, ‘Entrust governance to the old man of Zang—perhaps the people may yet recover.’"*

The ministers, startled, said: *"This was the former lord, our king!"*

King Wen replied: *"Then let us divine it."*
The ministers said: *"The former lord’s command—what further divination is needed?"*

Thereupon, they welcomed the old man of Zang and entrusted him with governance. He altered no laws, issued no unilateral decrees. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm: the ranks of scholars had dissolved, factions dispersed; officials no longer cultivated virtue; and grain measures dared not cross the four borders. When the ranks of scholars dissolved and factions dispersed, it was because all esteemed unity. When officials no longer cultivated virtue, it was because all shared the same purpose. When grain measures dared not cross the four borders, it was because the feudal lords harbored no divided loyalties.

King Wen then bowed northward and asked him as Grand Preceptor: *"Can governance extend to all under Heaven?"*
The old man of Zang remained silent and gave no answer. That evening, he fled in the night and was never heard from again.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: *"Was King Wen still not enlightened? Why then did he rely on a dream?"*
Confucius said: *"Be still and say no more. King Wen had already perfected it—what need is there for further criticism? He merely followed the moment."*

The annotations state:
*"Pian Zhu Ti Li" refers to a horse with one red hoof. "Zhi" means ranks. "San qun" means not nurturing followers. "Bu cheng de" means not pursuing merit or fame, as Sima explains. "Six hu four dou" is called a yu-measure.*

Guo's commentary:
*Not holding to his fishing—where the fisherman ultimately seeks nothing—nor weighing gain and loss in his mind, he merely borrowed fishing as a guise. "Esteeming unity" refers to what is called "blending one’s light and merging with the dust." "Not perfecting virtue" then means "sharing the same tasks," for one who purifies and completes oneself naturally differs from the common pursuits. "Grain measures dare not cross the borders" means that all under Heaven trust one another, thus unifying standards of measurement, weights, and balances. One who achieves merit does not claim it for oneself; thus, when the task is accomplished, one must withdraw, and when the name is established, one must depart. Only when name departs and self retreats can governance extend to all under Heaven. "King Wen perfected it" means he entrusted matters to his ministers rather than taking them upon himself—this is what "perfecting" means. "The moment" refers to the interval when the people’s sentiments are on the verge of awakening but have not yet done so; thus, King Wen followed and elicited it to align with their fundamental disposition.*

Lü's commentary:
*Knowing that the man of Zang was capable of governance, he grasped it in the space between fishing and not fishing. He entrusted it to a dream and set it by divination, yet did not divine—above, fearing the unease of great ministers and elders, and below, fearing the people’s loss of Heaven’s mandate. The laws and statutes, the Six Canons and Eight Regulations, were received from the Son of Heaven; this was the Way of a single state. If no decrees were issued domestically, they could then be shared with the feudal lords before being extended—this is how governance could reach all under Heaven. "Dissolving ranks" means dismantling the factions one has established. "Grain measures" means not adhering to the ancient standards of measurement.*

Bixu's notes:
*"Fishing and not fishing" refers to the straight hook, using fishing as a pretext while awaiting the right moment. "Dissolving ranks and dispersing followers" means that when the state is well-governed, loyal ministers no longer need to admonish from behind crumbling walls. "Officials not perfecting virtue" means the people are pure and governance is simple. "Grain measures not crossing borders" means the times are harmonious and the years abundant. "Esteeming unity" means ruler and ministers share one heart. "Sharing the same tasks" means the four classes of people engage in their proper occupations.*

Xun's edition:
*"Fishing the fishable" means angling for what can be caught—namely, fish. "Ordinary fishing" means casually casting a line without intent. It is not that he held his fishing rod to catch fish but rather that he had no intention of fishing, merely casting his line as usual. "No decrees issued" means he never issued a single command. "Dissolving ranks" means dismantling what one has established, not seeking to stand apart from others. This follows the example of Lü Wang, though it does not explicitly name him.*

Liu's summary:
*In the Three Dynasties, the straight Way was practiced. Knowing the man of Zang was virtuous, entrusting governance to him would have sufficed—why resort to a dream to convince the ministers?*

For one who knows the Dao, they must penetrate principle and understand adaptability—this is the Dao of Heaven. Self-trust is permissible; adaptability to others is indispensable—how could it be abandoned? Confucius and King Wen fully embodied this, yet even Yanzi fell short in some respects. Thus, the dream of Gaozong was not without reason. Gaozong was precisely one who "practiced the straight Way." His spirit reached in all four directions, flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth. The verification of utmost sincerity in the interplay of Heaven and humanity is like shadow and echo. That he dreamed of bestowing a worthy assistant is hardly cause for doubt.

Zhuangzi’s parable suggests that King Wen, wishing to demonstrate adaptability, examined antiquity to validate the present, hence feigning a dream to convince others. Some scholars, extrapolating from the discourse on Zang the Elder, apply it to Fu Yue—this is mistaken.

**Personal Observations:**
The character *fu* (夫) in *fufu* (夫夫) should be read as *tai* (大), as in the Qin Shi Huang stele inscription. The seal script forms of *fu* (夫) and *da* (大) closely resemble one another.

*Planting* (植) refers to what Fan Wulu calls border markers—wooden stakes erected as boundaries, like the Elm Pass and Willow Barrier. *Dismantling ranks* (坏植) means disbanding troops and withdrawing defenses, merging neighboring domains into one—this is the custom of *shangtong* (尚同).

In Yue Yi’s letter to the King of Yan, he writes: "The plantings of Jiqiu were relocated to the bamboo groves of the Wen River." Xu Guang’s annotation explains that Yan’s borders were moved to the Wen River in Qi, where boundary markers were established.

When Lie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren, he drew the bow to its fullest, balanced a cup of water on his elbow, and loosed the arrow. The arrow struck the target, and the next followed in its wake—at that moment, he was like a wooden figurine. Bohun Wuren said, "This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Let me ascend a high mountain with you, tread upon perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you still shoot then?"

Thereupon, Bohun Wuren climbed the high mountain, stepped onto the treacherous rocks, and stood at the brink of the sheer drop. Turning, he retreated until his heels hung over the edge, then bowed and beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself, drenched in sweat down to his heels. Bohun Wuren said, "The perfected person gazes upward into the azure sky, delves downward into the Yellow Springs, and roams to the eight limits—yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble, your eyes dart about in fear. Your inner state is perilous indeed!"

*Guan* (贯), as Sima explains, refers to the arrowhead.

"Xun" (*Er Ya* glosses as "xunli," meaning trembling), referring to the darting of the eyes. He Chengtian’s *Zuan* states: "The people of Wu call the blinking of eyes 'xunmu.'" Guo’s commentary: "Ying guan" means the arrowhead is full; the left hand is steady as a cabinet, the right hand firm as a branch. The right hand releases the shot while the left hand remains unaware—thus one may place a cup of water upon it. "Shi shi fu ta" means the arrow, once loosed, returns in rapid succession. "Fang shi fu yu" describes how the previous arrow has not yet reached the target when the next is already lodged in the cup on the elbow, illustrating the marvel of such swiftness. "Xiang ren" refers to the perfection of stillness. "Huichi" means to roam freely.

When virtue fills the inner self, spirit brims outward, and no place—whether distant or near, hidden or deep—remains obscure. Thus one discerns the pivot of danger and safety yet remains serene and self-possessed. Failing to grasp this ultimate distinction, one succumbs to fear, and in fear, much is lost. How could this apply only to archery?

Lü’s commentary: "Yin zhi ying guan" refers to the fullness of the draw; "zhi zhou cuo beishui" to the perfect levelness of the elbow bearing the cup. The first arrow is loosed, and as it returns in succession, the next arrow is already lodged in the cup—this describes the seamless continuity of the shots. "Xiang ren" means the mind is undivided. This is the archery of shooting, not the archery of non-shooting. The latter is what is called "the preservation of pure qi," not a matter of knowledge, skill, or boldness. Thus, when ascending mountains or facing abysses, the mind remains unmoved, and every shot finds its mark. To roam freely to the eight limits with spirit and qi unchanged is only fitting.

Jiang Yu’s commentary: The archery of shooting aims at what lies beyond; the archery of non-shooting abides in what lies within. The former is sometimes possible, sometimes not; the latter admits no impossibility. In this, one resembles the "xiang ren," for there is nothing to fear. The one who prostrates and sweats does so because the heart clings to pride. The mountain’s height, the rock’s peril, the abyss’s depth—none of these inherently harm a person. Those who tread upon them do not necessarily meet disaster. Yet when one clings to life, pursues external things, or hoards pride, no calamity is beyond reach. In the end, things cannot harm one, but one’s own heart brings harm upon itself, even to the point of losing life, and still one does not awaken. The perfected person, however, does not stray from the true. In ascending and treading, they differ not from others—only in their inner preservation of pure qi, unaware of any height or depth to fear. Thus, they go anywhere as the "xiang ren," roaming freely to the eight limits with spirit and qi unchanged. This is all there is to it.

*Bi Sheng*: Luo Miandao says: "Shi shi fu ta" means the arrow, once loosed, returns in succession to the previous one. "Fang shi fu yu" means the next arrow is already lodged in the cup as the current one is released. Fan Wulu argues that "fang shi" is like "fang zhou" (parallel boats), meaning the arrows are held side by side, already resting in the cup—not that the cup of water is placed on the elbow. Guo’s interpretation is incorrect.

Jianwu asked Sunshu Ao, "You have thrice served as Prime Minister yet show no pride, and thrice been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see your countenance so carefree—how do you cultivate your mind?"

Sunshu Ao replied, "How do I surpass others? I accept what comes, for it cannot be refused, and let go of what departs, for it cannot be stopped."

I hold that gain and loss are not of me, and so I show no sorrowful countenance—how do I surpass others? Moreover, I know not whether it lies in that other or in myself, whether it lies in that other and is lost to me, or lies in myself and is lost to that other. That one may hesitate, may look all around—what leisure has he to know? Is man noble and man base?

Confucius heard of this and said: "The true person of old—sages could not sway them with persuasion, beauties could not seduce them with excess, thieves could not plunder them by force, Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor could not befriend them. Life and death are indeed great, yet they undergo no change—how much less, then, rank and emolument? Such a one’s spirit threads through the great mountains without obstruction, abides in deep springs without wetting, dwells in the lowly and minute without weariness. It fills heaven and earth, and the more it is given to others, the more it possesses."

The King of Chu sat with the Lord of Fan. After a while, the King of Chu’s attendants said, "Fan has perished three times." The Lord of Fan replied, "Fan’s perishing is not enough to lose what I preserve. If Fan’s perishing is not enough to lose what I preserve, then Chu’s preservation is not enough to preserve what is preserved." From this perspective, Fan has never truly perished, and Chu has never truly existed.

**General Remarks on the Text:**
This chapter begins with Master Zifang’s teaching, where a countenance of heaven and virtue’s latent radiance—beyond all praise—was sufficient to awaken the Marquis Wen to the error of his learning and the burden of Wei’s state. Such is the power of a virtuous teacher: a single word awakens the ruler. Why fear, then, that the Way will not be established or the self not stand firm?

Confucius, upon meeting Wenbo Xuezi, perceived the Dao in a mere glance—thus the moment of enlightenment did not lie in the tedium of didactic instruction. When Yanzi marveled at the transcendent, leaving all dust behind, his gaze fixed upon what lay beyond, the great transformation had already shifted imperceptibly. Why seek it only in the fleeting instant when an opportunity slips through one’s grasp? Laozi wandered at the origin of things, while Confucius recognized his detachment from men and independence—such encounters with the wondrous were so profound that further questioning would have been superfluous. Yet without seizing the moment to expound the principle, how could later learners be enlightened? Thus, he elucidated the mysteries of yin-yang harmonizing and the generation of beings, tracing their sprouts to their ultimate return, so that all might grasp the great wholeness of heaven and earth and forget the petty changes of the bodily form. Such was the sagely heart of enriching the Dao and aiding all things.

When Duke Ai remarked that Lu had many Ru scholars, he judged by robes and caps; Zhuangzi examined their conduct and substance, thus finding them wanting. Yet when Confucius was hailed throughout the state and stood alone, it revealed that the true Dao is indestructible while false learning fades easily. How could the clear mirror of discernment be deceived? When King Wen raised the Elder of Zang, governance was achieved, yet he fled by night—this showed that those with intent to govern must urgently employ the worthy, while those who respond to things without attachment do not cling to achievement. The Way of ruler and minister reaches its perfection here, setting a standard for ten thousand generations.

As for Bohun, who observed Lie Yukou through archery, or the minister Shu Ao, who was dismissed thrice yet showed no distress—these were men of ultimate destiny, detached from men and merged with heaven, one with transformation, casting off the eight directions, unmoved by life or death. Only when learning the Dao reaches this point can it be called ultimate; otherwise, one merely pursues externals while endangering the inner self. In the end, the parable of the King of Chu and the lord whose state and self rise and fall clarifies the distinction between things and self, inner and outer—truly one who knows the weight of priorities.

*Knowing Northward Wandering, Chapter Twenty-Two*

At the Black Waters, Knowing Northward Wandered. Ascending the mound of Kunfen, he chanced upon Non-Action Spoken. Knowing said to Non-Action Spoken, "I wish to ask you: how does one think, how does one contemplate to know the Dao? Where does one abide, what does one practice to be at peace with the Dao? From what does one proceed, by what path does one attain the Dao?" Three questions he posed, yet Non-Action Spoken made no reply. Not that he would not answer—he did not know how to answer.

Knowing, having gained no answer, returned south of the White Waters. Ascending Fox Tower, he saw Mad Qu. Knowing repeated his questions to Mad Qu. Mad Qu said, "Ah! I know it—I would tell you, but mid-speech I forget what I wished to say."

Knowing, having gained no answer, returned to the Emperor’s palace and questioned the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor said, "Without thought, without contemplation—only then does one begin to know the Dao. Without abiding, without practice—only then does one begin to be at peace with the Dao. Without proceeding, without path—only then does one begin to attain the Dao."

Knowing asked the Yellow Emperor, "You and I know it; they and they do not. Which of us is right?" The Yellow Emperor said, "That Non-Action Spoken—he is truly so. Mad Qu resembles him. You and I, in the end, do not approach it. For the knowing do not speak; the speaking do not know. Thus the sage enacts the teaching without words. The Dao cannot be attained; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence may be practiced; righteousness may be diminished; ritual is mutual pretense.

Thus it is said: Lose the Dao, then virtue follows; lose virtue, then benevolence follows; lose benevolence, then righteousness follows; lose righteousness, then ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of chaos. Thus it is said: One who practices the Dao daily diminishes—diminishes again and again, until one reaches non-action. With non-action, there is nothing that is not done. Now that one has become a thing, to return again to the root—is this not difficult? How easy it is—only for the great person!"

Life is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life. Who knows their order? The life of humans is the gathering of qi—gathered, it becomes life; scattered, it becomes death. If death and life are companions, what cause for distress have I?

All things are one. What they deem wondrous is called "spirit-like marvel"; what they despise is called "foul decay." Yet foul decay transforms into spirit-like marvel, and spirit-like marvel transforms into foul decay. Thus it is said: Throughout the world, there is but a single qi.

Therefore the sage values oneness.

Huangdi said: "I asked Wuweiwei. Wuweiwei did not respond to me—not that he would not respond, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Kuang Qu. Kuang Qu wished to tell me but did not tell me—not that he would not tell me, but that in wishing to tell, he forgot it.

Now I ask you: You know it—why then are we not close?"

Huangdi said: "He is truly right because he does not know. This one resembles it because he forgets. You and I will never be close because you know."

Kuang Qu heard this and regarded Huangdi as one who knew words.

[Guo's commentary: To let things follow their own course is the teaching without words. The Dao resides in spontaneity and cannot be attained through speech. Not losing virtue is called "virtue," yet to speak of virtue is not to reach it. Ritual has its constants, from which arise the distortions of affectation. Daily diminishing is the shedding of artificial adornments. When adornments are gone and simplicity is whole, though one acts, it is as if one does not act. Things lose their proper place, hence there is action. The ease of returning to the root belongs only to the great person. The great person embodies transformation, thus transforming things is not difficult.

Those who know the Dao of transformation do not regard life and death as distinct, for they alternate as beginnings. If both are but gatherings, both are but scatterings—why should I be distressed? Distress arises from distinction. Each takes what it cherishes as spirit-like marvel and what it detests as foul decay. Yet what one cherishes, another may detest; what one detests, another may cherish. Thus all share in spirit-like marvel, all share in foul decay. In life and death, self and other—how are they different?

To take not-knowing as true is to know; to take knowing as closeness is to be far from it. Clearly, spontaneity is not something attainable through words or knowledge. One must dwell in the realm of wordlessness. First, the standard of wordlessness is raised; then clarity is entrusted to Huangdi, so that the obscurity of spontaneity may be guarded against and made visible.]

Lü’s Annotation:
The Dao has no fixed direction, thus it cannot be attained; to seek attainment is to summon it to come. Virtue resides within me, thus it cannot be reached; to seek arrival is to go from self to other. Virtue is non-action, yet benevolence may be enacted. Benevolence then becomes what is esteemed, while righteousness may be diminished. Ritual is performed, yet none respond—flailing arms and forcing compliance is but mutual pretense, the very source of chaos. Therefore, those who practice the Dao daily diminish until they reach non-action, whereupon benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music cannot but perish. Yet when non-action becomes all-action, which of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, or music is not the Dao? Now that one has become a thing, one possesses knowledge and desires to return to the root—is this not difficult? The great person shines brilliantly, and things cannot obscure them; returning to the root amid the teeming multitudes is but an easy matter. Birth and death, beginning and end—without origin, without order—qi gathers to form life, qi scatters to form death. To know that the gathering and scattering of qi are transient—what cause for distress? Thus the myriad things are one. What one cherishes is deemed spirit-like marvel, what one detests is deemed foul decay—these two transform into one another. From this, we know that all under heaven shares a single qi, which is why the sage values unity.

Bi Xu:
To withdraw sight and reverse hearing, all existents are empty. To take knowledge as right and ignorance as wrong is to compound error. Moreover, true reality and true knowing are both obstacles to the Dao, the most difficult to remove. One must first diminish knowledge, then diminish ignorance, until reaching non-knowing. Only after no-diminishing does non-action arise, and in non-action, nothing is not done. In non-action, there is no self—is this not the great person? Only by forgetting life can death not bind; only by forgetting death can one recover the source of life. To regard life and death as a single thread—what aversion or attachment could find leisure?

Brush Strokes:
Non-action is called true reality, for it does not speak. Huangdi’s distance from it arises from his speech. This clinging to appearances and contention over them—this is the great matter. Huangdi’s relation to the Dao is no less than that of non-action. In the *Vimalakīrti Sutra*, when the bodhisattvas discussed the Dharma-gate of non-duality, Vimalakīrti alone remained silent. His intent was that silence is supreme. Yet when Śāriputra remained silent, the goddess did not approve, saying: "The liberated one is neither within nor without, nor between the two. Speech and scripture are likewise neither within nor without, nor between the two. Therefore, one does not depart from speech and scripture to speak of the marks of liberation." Knowing this, speech and silence are one, knowing and not-knowing are one. Thought and reflection may also lead to the Dao; dwelling in a place and wearing robes may also accord with the Dao; following and guiding may also attain the Dao. Why? Because when thought is utterly empty, dwelling and robes have no place; when there is no following, there is no Dao to follow—yet the Dao is not truly a Dao.

Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons have bright patterns yet do not debate; the myriad things have completed principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of heaven and earth and penetrates the principles of the myriad things. Thus the perfected person practices non-action, and the great sage does not act—this is called observing heaven and earth. Now, that numinous clarity and utmost refinement, along with the hundred transformations of things—life and death, square and round—none know their root. Yet suddenly, the myriad things have existed since antiquity. The six directions are vast, yet nothing lies beyond their bounds; the autumn down is minute, yet it awaits completion to form a body. All under heaven floats and sinks, never constant throughout life. Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their courses, each maintaining its order. Obscure yet not absent, effortless yet spirit-like, the myriad things are nurtured without awareness—this is called the root. Through it, one may observe heaven.

Guo’s Annotation:
Non-action means allowing things to act of themselves; not-acting is merely following and yielding. To observe heaven and earth is to observe their forms and emulate their fittingness, so as to be no different from them. To be with the hundred transformations is to let the hundred things transform themselves while the numinous does not seize control. The dead have already died of themselves; the living have already lived of themselves. The round have already become round of themselves; the square have already become square of themselves. None has acted upon their root, thus none knows it. "Since antiquity, they have existed of themselves" means they do not depend on action to exist. "The six directions have not departed from their bounds" is a crude calculation—if one reckons the six directions within the boundless, it is shallow. "The autumn down awaits completion to form a body" means that though the autumn down is small, it is not nothing, nor can it contain its own substance. "Never constant" means daily renewal. "Moving in their courses, each maintaining its order" means they do not depend on action.

The manifestly existent is already lost—thus, in obscurity and purity, when form appears, numinosity is gone. Therefore, when qi accumulates smoothly yet fails to grasp the root of its inherent nature, one does not know by what it is accumulated.

To observe Heaven is to observe in unison with Heaven.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
That Heaven and Earth act without action yet lack nothing is the great beauty. The four seasons transform and alternate, beginning and ending without confusion—this is the luminous model. Though the myriad things are many, the Dao is present in all—this is the principle of completion. Beauty fills their midst; models can be emulated; principles reach everywhere without obstruction—all return to the Dao alone. The sage traces beauty to its source, comprehends principle, and knows that what is not acted upon exists naturally. Thus, observing Heaven and Earth suffices.

Now, the numinous and most refined, along with the hundred transformations—if one regards them as things, those things have already died, lived, become round, or become square. How could one know their root? Yet though unseen, the ten thousand things are none other than it. Since antiquity, it has inherently existed—it has never departed. Yin and yang, the four seasons, each attain their order. If not for it, who would act? If it were lost yet present, formless yet numinous, it could not be sought between existence and non-existence. The myriad things interpenetrate through this yet do not know why—this is called the root.

---

**Personal Reflection:**
Does the sage embody Heaven and Earth to nurture the myriad things merely as an inert, actionless block like a wooden puppet? No—acting yet without acting, creating yet without creating, like the movement of celestial seasons or the nurturing of earthly fertility, it does not transgress naturalness. Aligning with Heaven and Earth’s numinous and most refined, the flourishing and withering forms of the hundred transformations are clearly visible, yet none know who acts. This is what is called the root.

Though unseen, the ten thousand things are its very essence—this is the meaning of "the teeming multitude." Since antiquity, the Dao has inherently existed, unchanging. Thus, vast, it pervades the six directions; minute, it enters the autumn down. With things, it flows in the same current, daily renewed. Yin and yang move together in order. If lost yet present, it is dimly discernible as something; if formless yet numinous, it is obscurely manifest in clarity. The myriad things are all born and nurtured through this, yet do not know it as their root. What is called the root—how could it be sought elsewhere? Returning to one’s own body, one finds what gives life—this is it. Knowing the root and abiding by it without departure is called "returning to the root." Returning to the root is called "tranquility"; tranquility is called "reverting to destiny." Destiny is Heaven. Thus, it is said: one can observe Heaven.

Beigyi was asked about the Dao by Nie Que. Beigyi said: "Align your form, unify your gaze—Heaven’s harmony will arrive. Gather your knowledge, unify your measure—the spirit will come. Abiding in virtue will beautify you; the Dao will reside within you. Your pupils will be as bright as a newborn calf’s, seeking no reasons for things."

Before he finished speaking, Nie Que fell asleep. Beigyi, greatly pleased, sang as he departed, saying: "A form like withered bones, a heart like dead ashes—truly, such knowing does not cling to the past. Vague and obscure, without intent, it cannot be schemed with. What manner of person is this?"

Shun asked Cheng: "Can the Dao be possessed and held?"
Cheng replied: "Your body is not your own possession—how could you possess the Dao?"
Shun said: "If my body is not my own, then whose is it?"
Cheng said: "It is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form. Life is not your possession—it is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted harmony. Nature and destiny are not your possession—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted compliance. Even your descendants are not your possession—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted shedding. Thus, in movement, you know not where you go; in stillness, you know not what you hold; in eating, you know not the taste. These are the workings of Heaven and Earth’s vigorous yang qi—how could you possess them?"

The body is not something you can possess—it simply exists of itself. If the body were yours to possess, then beauty, ugliness, life, and death would be yours to control. Yet when qi gathers and you are born, you cannot forbid it; when qi scatters and you die, you cannot prevent it. Clearly, it is an entrustment that forms itself—it is not yours to own. Even descendants are but qi’s self-entrusted shedding. Movement, stillness, eating, and drinking all arise from this spontaneous process, so you do not know them. Vigorous yang is like movement itself. Those who understand this Dao may relinquish the body and forget life.

Yet when Shun inquired of his ministers, it was only because he could not but assume the throne after Yao—once the illustrious virtue had its beginning, he had already departed from the Dao. Thus his words were but a pretext. As for the ministers, they were those who aided the ruler with the Dao.

Confucius asked Lao Dan, “This evening, may I dare inquire about the supreme Dao?”
Lao Dan replied, “Purify yourself through fasting, cleanse your heart through abstention, and wash your spirit as with snow. Strike down your knowledge and then we may speak of the Dao—how profound and ineffable it is! Let me tell you its broad outlines. Luminous clarity arises from obscurity; order emerges from formlessness. Spirit arises from the Dao, while form originates from essence. All things take shape through form, thus the nine orifices belong to the womb-born, and the eight orifices to the egg-born. Their coming leaves no trace; their going has no boundary. Without gate or chamber, they are open on all four sides, vast and boundless.

Those who stray from this find their limbs stiff and their thoughts muddled, their ears and eyes sharp yet their minds wearied, their responses to things without constancy. Heaven cannot but be high, Earth cannot but be broad, the sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—such is the Dao. Moreover, vast learning does not necessarily bring knowledge, nor does eloquence necessarily bring wisdom. The sage guards against these. As for that which, when increased, is not more, and when diminished, is not less—the sage preserves it. How profound it is!"

Vast it stands, towering like the sea—how majestic! Its end returns to its beginning. It measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion, and this is the Dao of the noble person. Is it external to things? All things turn to it for sustenance, yet it is never exhausted—such is the Dao.

Within the central realms there are those who, neither yin nor yang, dwell between Heaven and Earth, simply being human. Yet they will return to their origin. Viewed from their root, the living are but dim and turbid things. Though some live long and others die young, how great is the difference? All is but a fleeting moment. How then can one judge Yao and Jie as right or wrong? Even the ripened fruits of trees have their principles; though human relationships are difficult to order, the sage encounters them without resistance, passes them without clinging, harmonizes and responds—this is virtue. To meet and respond by chance—this is the Dao. It is from this that emperors rise and kings emerge.

Human life between Heaven and Earth is like a white colt passing through a gap—gone in an instant. Suddenly, vigorously, all things emerge; gently, limpidly, all things return. Already transformed, they are born; again transformed, they die. Living things mourn this; humans grieve it. They break their Heaven-given bow cases, scatter their Heaven-given quivers, entangled and lost. The hun and po depart, and the body follows—all return to the great homecoming.

The formless takes form; form returns to the formless—this all people know in common, yet it is not what those who strive for the ultimate concern themselves with. This is what the multitude discusses together, but those who reach the Dao do not discuss it, and those who discuss it do not reach it. Clearly seeing what cannot be encountered, arguing is not as good as silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing it is not as good as stopping the ears—this is called the great attainment.

*(Annotations within the text: "Wooden fruits are called *guo*; herbaceous fruits are called *luo*. *Taō* is a bow case; *zhì* is a clothing bag.")*

Guo’s Commentary [states: "The dark and formless is called the Dao—all clarify its solitary arising without reliance. Form fundamentally arises from essence, proceeding from essence to the coarse. Though the myriad things generate one another through form, this too is simply natural. Thus, embryo and egg cannot alter their kind in generation, demonstrating the unfeignability of spirit and qi. Those who follow the nature of spontaneity and wander the traceless path release their forms amid Heaven and Earth, entrusting their spirit beyond the eight directions. Thus, they have no gate, no chamber—fourfold open, august, and carefree—roaming the Six Directions in step with transformation.

When a person encounters this Dao at birth, their Heaven-endowed nature remains whole and their spirit settled; Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things can only be as they naturally are—not that the Dao compels them. Therefore, the sage guards against and discards knowledge and wisdom, entrusting them to spontaneity, allowing each to preserve its proper allotment alone, without employing knowledge or wisdom. Like the sea, it receives all without limit. Ending, it begins again, moving with transformation. Using things without being enslaved by them, it is never exhausted—this clarifies that the Dao’s abundance lies in not being abundant, and that things naturally attain fulfillment when it is not abundant. Hence it is said: this is the Dao. To speak of the ultimate Dao as ‘without achievement’—only ‘without achievement’ suffices to name the Dao.

It is neither yin nor yang, without partiality, simply and directly human. Haughtily self-releasing, it finds peace in whatever it encounters, utterly devoid of achievement or fame. Returning to the source is not chasing after ends. Obscuring and steeping things is simply gathering qi. Life and death are not yet sufficient to distinguish—how much less the span between long and short life? Fruits and gourds have their principles; it is said that things are without principle, but one should simply follow them. Human relations involve the vicissitudes of knowledge and wisdom, hence their difficulty. Yet knowledge and wisdom are merely self-ranked—one should simply follow and entrust them, encountering without opposing, passing without clinging. This is called harmony and accord.

The rise of emperors and kings is no more than this. The fleeting white colt is not worth lamenting—‘going out’ and ‘entering’ are but names for transformation. It is said that nothing under Heaven does not change. Having transformed and been born, it transforms again and dies—both are transformation. Living things lament it; dead things do not lament. People grieve it; the dead do not grieve. Loosening the Heaven-given bow case and scattering the Heaven-given quiver speak of solitary release. ‘Entangled and lost’ describes the swirling of transformation. The great homecoming is using the mind without effort amid it all. The formless taking form completes it; if one shapes form, one ruins it. Striving does not reach it; humbly and unknowingly, one attains it. Clearly seeing what cannot be encountered, arguing is not as good as silence. Darkly arriving, it is encountered. Silencing and stopping the ears, there is nothing to chase—hence the great attainment."]

Lü’s Commentary [states: "Spirit and Dao are still luminous; at the ultimate of the Dao, it is dark. When things achieve their life-principle, there is order; when their essence is most true, it is formless. Yet the myriad things generate one another through form, coming and going without trace, fourfold open and august. Entering and wandering here, one rests in the profound mystery of the myriad things. By vigorously contemplating and grasping its use, there is no limit—Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things’ generation and completion are none other than this.

Broadness is not knowledge; eloquence is not wisdom. The sage has already guarded against them—what seems gain is not gain, what seems loss is not loss, for these are what the sage preserves. Abyssal! Vast! No one knows its bounds. There is movement, there is measure—these are not within the Dao. What the myriad things rely upon is not reliance on externals. Seeking the Dao thus, one finds its whereabouts.

Neither yin nor yang, only following the Dao—straight and simply human, the same as others. Returning to the source is the same as Heaven. ‘Obscuring and steeping’ speaks of what is not prized. Long and short life are equal in view—how can Yao and Jie be distinguished? Fruits and gourds have their principles; all things share them. Human relations are self-ranked—this is the order of the great Dao. Not opposing, not clinging, not leaving, not taking—this is called harmony and response. Virtue’s so-called ‘partial completion’ and response to stimuli—Dao does not examine or proclaim.

The rise of emperors and kings is no more than this Dao. Human life is like a colt passing a crack—nothing can be detained. Things lament, people grieve, because they do not understand that there was never birth, never death. Loosening the bow case is relaxation without constraint; scattering the quiver is rolling and unrolling without hindrance. The hun and po depart, and the body follows—this speaks of not going out. The great smelter does not shape the formless taking form; form returning to the formless—all people know this in common, but it is not what those who strive for the ultimate concern themselves with. Attaining it, one embodies it; not attaining it, one merely discusses it. Clearly seeing the Dao, there is nothing to encounter—hence arguing is not as good as silence. Truly hearing the Dao, there is nothing to hear—hence hearing is not as good as stopping the ears. Speaking without words, listening without hearing—this is called the great attainment."]

Following the Original [states: "It is said that one need not be broad or eloquent—the sage already has a fixed saying. The sage’s saying cannot be diminished or augmented. Abyssal!" ]

The Way is like the vast sea—majestic and boundless. Its end returns to its beginning, thus extolling the sage’s Dao: its measure encompasses the ten thousand things without exhaustion, yet this is merely the Way of the noble person. For they still harbor intent toward externals. All that lies beyond them—the ten thousand things—proceed to draw from it without exhaustion, and this is their Way. Yet speech is insufficient to convey the Dao.

Within the central realms, there are those who transcend beyond yin and yang, dwelling between heaven and earth as if merely passing as humans. They will return to their origin—the origin is the Great Void. Viewed from the Great Void, human life is like *yìyǐ*—fermented plum juice. The *Liji* annotates *yǐ* as plum broth, and *yìn* as long-fermented. Yet even long-fermented broth—how long can it last? Thus, all that people debate and expound are but fleeting discourses.

Though fruits and melons are humble things, their branches, flowers, and fruits still follow patterns of order—ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, friends—these human relations, though seemingly complex and arduous, serve to establish rank and sequence. The sage, dwelling amidst human relations, encounters them without resistance, never abandoning them; passes beyond them without attachment, never lingering. Harmonizing with them and responding—this is virtue. Aligning with them and responding—this is the Dao. The rise of emperors and kings all proceeds from this.

In turmoil and flux, the appearance of unraveling bow-cases and discarded scrolls—form emerging from the formless, and form dissolving into the formless. *Zhí* means encounter.

The essentials of the Great Dao cannot be encountered through mere clarity of vision—thus eloquence is not as good as silence.
*Supplementary Note:* Things encounter one another through duality, yet the Dao is simply one. To perceive the Dao with clarity is to enter into oneness—hence there is no encounter.

Dongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi, “Where is this so-called Dao?”
Zhuangzi replied, “There is nowhere it is not.”
Dongguo Zi said, “You must specify before I can understand.”
Zhuangzi said, “It is in the ant.”
“How can it be so lowly?”
“It is in the weeds.”
“How can it be even lower?”
“It is in the tiles and bricks.”
“How can it be still lower?”
“It is in excrement and urine.”
Dongguo Zi made no reply.

Zhuangzi said, “Your question, Master, fundamentally fails to reach the essence. When Zheng Huo asked the market inspector about the weight of a pig, the lower he felt, the more accurate the measure. You, too, should not insist on certainty—nothing escapes the all-pervading Dao. Such is the case with grand pronouncements as well. ‘All-encompassing,’ ‘universal,’ and ‘complete’—these three are different names for the same reality, their meaning one and the same.

Have we not wandered together in the Palace of Non-Being? There, in shared discourse, we find no end to our discussion. Have we not practiced non-action together? Serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease—my will is already at rest, yet I know not where it arrives. Departing and returning, I know not where it halts. I have already come and gone, yet I know not where it ends. Wandering freely, I enter the boundless—great knowledge penetrates, yet I know not where it reaches its limit.

That which is a thing among things merges with things without boundary, yet things have boundaries—this is what we call the boundary of things. The boundary of the boundless is the boundlessness of boundaries. We speak of fullness and emptiness, decline and decay, yet that which is fullness is not fullness, that which is emptiness is not emptiness. That which is decline is not decline, that which is decay is not decay. That which is root and branch is not root and branch, that which is accumulation and dispersal is not accumulation and dispersal.”

*(The market inspector is the overseer of the market.)*

Guo’s Commentary:
To expect a definitive answer is to demand a name and location for it. *Zhi* (substance) is the standard—it is said to be nowhere absent, yet to marvel at its presence here is to fall short of true *zhi*. *Xi* is the great pig. The market inspector who treads upon the pig to gauge its fatness knows that the more he treads upon the harder-to-fat areas, the better he grasps the essence of the pig’s fatness. Now, to inquire into the Dao’s whereabouts and constantly compare it to the lowly is to see that the Dao does not flee from things. This must be so. If one insists that the Dao escapes things, then the Dao is not all-pervading. A Dao that is not all-pervading is insufficient to be called the great Dao. The same applies to grand discourse: it is clear that the Dao does not flee from things. If one roams where there is something, one cannot encompass all. Only by discussing them together can one know that the Dao is nowhere absent. Knowing that the Dao is nowhere absent, one can then wander freely, untethered, and roam the boundless.

“Tranquil and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease”—these all arise from non-action. “Liao, my aspiration” means empty and void; if the aspiration is empty, then there is nowhere to go. With nowhere to go, one goes yet does not know where one arrives. If there is somewhere to go, then the principle has not yet stirred, yet the aspiration is already startled. “Coming and going without knowing where it halts” is to follow the natural course. “Wandering freely without knowing where it ends” means merely coming and going without relying on knowledge—it is not that there is no coming and going. Coming and going are the constant principles of nature. Can they have an end?

*Feng hong* refers to vast emptiness. Great knowledge roams the boundless, following the transformations of things as they please, hence it does not know. “That which is a thing among things” means there is no thing, yet things are things of themselves. Things are things of themselves, hence they are obscure. Things have boundaries, so they cannot be obscure together—this is what is truly called the boundary of things. The “boundless” merely clarifies that things are things of themselves. That which is a thing among things is ultimately no thing at all. Where, then, is its boundary? Having clarified that “that which is a thing among things” is no thing, and that things are not things of themselves, then who is the doer? All is suddenly and naturally so.

Lü’s Commentary:
Ants have knowledge yet are most minute; millet and weeds have no knowledge yet possess life; tiles and bricks have no life yet have form; excrement and urine have form yet are foul and decayed. If these are the Dao, then it is clear that the Dao is nowhere absent. One may expect the Dao to reside in these four, for they are its substance. To consider them too lowly and then ask again is to fall short of substance.

The one who treads upon the pig, descending further with each comparison, expects the Dao to be ever lower—how could this not be further from its true substance? Yet one insists on fleeing from things to assert that there is nothing in which the Dao is not present. Thus, though the previous four differ, they all embody the Dao’s essence, just as speech that is all-encompassing shares a single intent. To roam the Palace of Nothingness and find their convergence—how could these four not be the Dao? Though the myriad things arise together, when they return to non-action, then in tranquility, vastness, harmony, and ease, all revert to their root, empty and void. If my aspiration does not chase after things, then there is nowhere to go, and I do not know where I arrive. Coming and going, I do not know where it halts; wandering freely, I do not know where it ends. This is the Dao’s never having been a thing, and things’ being nothing but the Dao.

Thus, wandering freely in vast emptiness, great knowledge enters yet does not know where it reaches its limit. From this, one knows that “that which is a thing among things” merges with things without boundary. Small and great cannot be differentiated; things have boundaries—this is what we call the boundary of things, not “that which is a thing among things.” The boundary of the boundless is the boundlessness of boundaries, just as the formless is the form of forms. Fullness and emptiness belong to things; that which creates fullness and emptiness is the Dao. The same applies to decline and decay, root and branch, accumulation and dispersal. Then who is it that creates millet, weeds, ants, tiles, bricks, excrement, and urine?

Following the Original Text:
*Qi* means to specify in speech. *Zhi* is the root. The question is vague and does not reach the root, hence my response is as such. *Zheng huo* refers to the *Yili* (Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial), where the *sizheng* and *sihuo* oversee the archery ritual. The market inspector who treads upon the pig to know its weight is like the *sizheng* and *sihuo*—though their duties differ, they serve the same purpose in the archery ritual, hence the analogy. To tread upon the pig is to step from its upper body to its lower body; the lower one goes, the clearer the comparison of fatness and leanness becomes. Commonly, a pig is considered fat when its two thighs are equal—this illustrates that the lower one goes, the more evident the comparison, and thus the Dao becomes visible.

Supplementary Notes:
*Xi* is the great pig. *Lü* means to tread upon it with the foot.

The fatness or leanness of a pig can be known by treading upon its rump, for the rump is the lowest part of the creature. Thus, "below" must imply certainty. Only with certainty can one proceed to inquiry, hence the saying: "You must not insist on certainty, nor say it is uncertain—where, after all, could the Dao be escaped?" That by which a thing is called the Dao is ultimately one with the thing itself. Thus, the supreme Dao is as such, and so too are the supreme words: though "all-encompassing," "pervasive," and "universal" differ in phrasing, their meaning is one.

To speak all day of the profound and wondrous is no different from ashes and dregs. Yet though I speak of the Dao with words, and you inquire of the Dao with questions, neither words nor questions are the Dao itself. Shall we advance a step further together, wandering in the Palace of Non-Being, discussing the learning that knows no end or limit? In such unity, I have nothing to say, and you have nothing to hear—shall we be still and tranquil, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease? How boundless and distant is my aspiration! Distant, it seems to have a destination, yet in truth it goes nowhere. Going nowhere, it abides in serene constancy. If there is coming and going, it is merely the fitting arrival of the moment, the fitting departure in accord with it. Abiding in timeliness and accordance, one knows not where it rests. For once there is a resting place, one knows departure but not arrival, or arrival but not departure—both are grasping and not natural. Thus, I have come and gone without knowing what it is ultimately like, wandering in the vast and open wilderness, entering into the great knowledge without knowing its limits.

"Great knowledge" is but another name for the great Dao. This is what is meant by "wandering with you in the Palace of Non-Being, discussing without end or limit." All things are the Dao, yet the Dao is nowhere while being nowhere absent. Thus, it is said to have no boundaries, for boundaries belong to things. To speak of a thing having boundaries is to speak of the boundaries of things; the Dao, however, is the boundary that is no boundary. It is not that the Dao is separate from things and called by another name—it is simply the boundary that is no boundary.

What is called a boundary refers to fullness and emptiness, decline and decay—all of which have two sides. The Dao, however, is called fullness yet is not fullness, called emptiness yet is not emptiness, called decline yet is not decline, called decay yet is not decay, called root and branch yet is not root and branch, called accumulation and dispersal yet is not accumulation and dispersal. As Master Zhang said: "The two are present, hence it is unfathomable." Such is the case.

Fang Sishan notes: "All-encompassing, pervasive, universal—these are phrases with different words but one principle. To be able to be without action, tranquil and vast, harmonious and at ease—this is perfection. *Liaoyi* is a word praising its utmost stillness. Having boundaries means knowing its limits; having no boundaries means not knowing its limits. Not knowing its limits is to be one with all things. Being one with all things, it alone can be full yet not full, empty yet not empty, in decline yet not in decline, in decay yet not in decay—this is the boundary that is no boundary."

E, called Ahegan, studied with Shennong under Old Dragon Ji. Once, Shennong shut his door and meditated through the day. At noon, E opened the door and entered, saying, "Old Dragon is dead." Shennong leaned on his staff and rose, then suddenly dropped it and laughed, saying, "Heaven knew my stubbornness and arrogance, so it abandoned me and let him die. The Master died without eliciting my wild words—what a pity!" Yan Gang, upon hearing this, said: "Those who embody the Dao are the ones upon whom the noble of the world depend. Yet even one who has not attained so much as a hair’s tip or a ten-thousandth part of the Dao still knows to conceal his wild words upon death—how much more so for those who truly embody the Dao! It is formless to sight, soundless to hearing, and those who discuss it call it obscure. Thus, they speak of the Dao but do not reach the Dao."

Thereupon, Taiqing asked Wuqiong: "Do you know the Dao?" Wuqiong said, "I do not." He asked again. Wuwei said, "I know the Dao." Taiqing said, "Does your knowing the Dao have a pattern?" Wuwei said, "It does." Taiqing said, "What is its pattern?" Wuwei said, "I know the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be constrained, can be dispersed—this is the pattern by which I know the Dao." Taiqing, taking these words, asked Wushi: "If this is so, then Wuqiong’s not knowing and Wuwei’s knowing—which is right and which is wrong?" Wushi said, "Not knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not knowing is internal; knowing is external." Thereupon, Taiqing sighed and said, "Is not knowing, then, knowing? Is knowing, then, not knowing? Who knows the knowing of not knowing?"

Wushi said: "The Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Do you know that which gives form to the formless? The Dao should not be named." Wushi said: "One who answers when asked about the Dao does not know the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers. To ask questions is to ask about limits; to answer is to lack inwardness. To lack inwardness while facing questions about limits—is this not to observe externally? Within the cosmos, do you not know? Thus, one does not pass beyond the Great Beginning, does not wander in the Great Void, does not roam beyond Kunlun."

Guo's Commentary:
[When Liezi] awoke to the fact that death is nothing to be startled by, he put down his staff and laughed. From Jianwu downward, all took the ultimate words as madness and did not believe them. Thus, none but Lao Long and Lian Shu and their like were worthy of discourse. The gentleman’s concern with words that embody the Dao is the very foundation of humanity. The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet even this does not attain one ten-thousandth of it. Concealing his mad words, he died to illuminate that the ultimate Dao cannot be attained through words. It lies solely in self-realization. Though obscure, it is still not the Dao—this clarifies the namelessness of the Dao. All attainment does not come from knowledge but from obscurity, silently completing itself in the realm of the unseen and unheard, only then reaching it. To know the formless in forms is merely to speak of forms shaping themselves. The shaper of forms ultimately has no thing. The Dao has a name, yet ultimately no thing, so naming cannot capture it. Not knowing, one asks; to answer when asked is not the Dao. Not to answer is not what the questioner can attain, so though one asks, in the end one does not hear it. Without questions, without answers—this is the meaning of cutting off learning, abandoning teaching, and returning to spontaneity. "Questions about limits" refers to demanding the empty. To respond with what is actually nonexistent yet provisionally existent is external. As for those who wander freely between heaven and earth, roam the void, and traverse the distant to enter the obscure—it is enough not to respond.

Lü's Commentary:
Those who embody the Dao are the very foundation to which all gentlemen in the world are tied. Sagehood, life, kingship, and completion—none are not bound to this. Now, in regard to the Dao, one has not attained even one ten-thousandth of the tip of an autumn hair—this is the essence of what is called "attaining oneness." Yet one still knows to conceal one’s mad words and die—how much more so for those who embody the Dao and whose myriad transformations have never begun to have limits? Lao Long concealed his mad words and died, all because the Dao as a thing is not within the reach of seeing and hearing. Those who discuss it call it obscure, yet it cannot be discussed in words, so to discuss the Dao is not the Dao. Tai Qing heard a discussion of the Dao that was not the Dao and took it as sufficient to seek in the infinite, yet the infinite cannot be known. Non-action is not originally non-action; one knows that there is nothing worth doing and so does not act—this is how it is known. Otherwise, it would be mere emptiness. To know that the Dao can be noble or base, contracted or dispersed, is to be bound by calculation. Wu Shi reaches the limit of the beginning that comes from itself. Thus, to know not-knowing is profound; to know is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external. Tai Qing sighed in the midst of the Great Purity, saying, "Not knowing is knowing the infinite—this is so. Knowing is not knowing non-action—this is so. Who knows the knowing of not knowing? Only Wu Shi." The Dao cannot be heard or seen; if spoken, then what is heard, seen, or spoken—who is it? Only after there is form is there name. To know the shaper of forms as formless—this is why the Dao should not be named. Thus, one who hears hearing does not hear; one who sees seeing does not see; one who speaks speaking does not speak. It can be known that one who answers when asked about the Dao does not know the Dao. Even one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao has no questions, for the questioner cannot attain it. Questions have no answers, for the answerer cannot attain it. All is because there has never yet been a thing. To ask questions is to ask about limits, not knowing the infinite and taking questioning as nothing. To answer is to lack inwardness, not having attained the fact that there has never yet been a thing within. To lack inwardness while facing questions about limits—is this not to observe externally? Within the cosmos, do you not know? Thus, one does not pass beyond the Great Beginning, does not wander in the Great Void, and so does not know the height of forms, while heaven, earth, and the myriad things are contained within it.

He who follows the root—opening the door with a *zha*, pushing it wide, the sound of a staff clattering to the ground—pointed to Old Dragon Ji and said: "I have nowhere to vent my wild words. Those who die speaking my words say, 'What I spoke was mostly reckless and ignorant.' While Old Dragon Ji lived, I could pose questions to seek his correction. Now that Old Dragon Ji is dead, I have nowhere to vent my wild words, and so they too shall perish with my death. Now, in the Dao, I have not attained even the tiniest fraction—like the tip of an autumn hair—yet I point to Shen Nong. If I conceal my wild words, there is nothing to vent. In human discourse, this is called 'obscurity.' Those who discuss the Dao describe it as formless and soundless, and so they merely call it 'obscurity.'"

Guangyao asked Wu You, "Master, do you possess that which is called 'Wu You'?" Guangyao could not frame his question and instead stared intently at Wu You’s appearance—profoundly empty, utterly vacant. He gazed all day without seeing, listened without hearing, and grasped without obtaining. Guangyao said, "This is perfection! Who could attain such a state? I can attain 'having no-thing,' yet I have not attained 'having no no-thing.' How could one reach this state of 'Wu You'?" [Note: "When it comes to 'Wu You,' this should be 'having no no-thing'—a scribal error.]

Guo’s Commentary: "This conveys the meaning of cutting off learning. In the Dao, severing it leads the learner back to the root. Thus, the excellence of learning lies precisely in non-learning."

Lü’s Commentary: "Guangyao is the vast expanse emitting light, yet when it illuminates 'Wu You,' there is no illumination left. This is why Guangyao, unable to discern whether it was 'having' or 'no-thing,' could not frame his question. Profoundly empty, utterly vacant—sight, hearing, and touch could not reach it. This is why it is called 'Wu You.' Precisely because it has 'no-thing,' Guangyao could not attain 'having no no-thing,' and thus could not reach 'Wu You.' When it comes to 'Wu You,' how could one reach it from anywhere?"

The Great Marshal’s hook-forger was eighty years old yet never erred by even a hair’s breadth. The Great Marshal asked, "Are you skillful, or do you possess the Dao?" The forger replied, "I have my discipline. At twenty, I took delight in forging hooks. I beheld nothing else—nothing but hooks did I examine. This is using what is employed by relying on what is not employed. With age, I have mastered its use—how much more so for that which is never not employed? What thing would not draw upon it?" [Note: The Great Marshal is the Grand Minister of War. In the region between the three Wei rivers of Jiangdong, a *chui* is called a *gou*, a type of sword.]

Guo’s Commentary: "He gauges the weight of hooks without the slightest deviation. Utterly free of attachment, all things respond as they come."

Lü’s Commentary: "Only the Dao is both without use and without non-use."

Ran Qiu asked Confucius, "Before there was Heaven and Earth, could it be known?"
Confucius replied, "It could. The ancient was as the present is."

Ran Qiu, having posed his question amiss, withdrew. The next day, he returned and said, "Yesterday, I asked whether what preceded Heaven and Earth could be known. You said it could, that the ancient was as the present is. Yesterday, I was enlightened; today, I am benighted. May I ask what this means?"
Confucius said, "Yesterday’s enlightenment came because the spirit first received it. Today’s benightedness arises because you now seek it through what is not spirit. Without ancient, without present, without beginning, without end—could there be descendants without there first being sons? Could there?"

Ran Qiu did not respond. Confucius said, "Enough. No answer is needed. Do not use life to give rise to death; do not use death to give rise to life. Do life and death depend on something? All share one body. Is there something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Things emerge, yet nothing precedes them. As there are things, so there are things—without end. The sage’s love for humanity never ceases; this, too, is drawn from this."

Guo’s Commentary:
"Confucius says that Heaven and Earth are ever-abiding, for there was never a time when they were not. With an empty mind, one awaits destiny—this is the spirit’s reception. To seek through thought is to invite further confusion. Not only does the nonexistent fail to transform into existence, but the existent also fails to transform into nonexistence. Thus, as a thing, existence undergoes a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations yet never becomes nonexistent. Therefore, from antiquity, there has never been a time of nonbeing, and it abides eternally. 'Descendants' speaks of generations without end. Its essence has a source; it cannot arise from nothing. Thus, there are generations, and so there are descendants; one cannot have grandsons without first having sons. Likewise, Heaven and Earth cannot first have been nonexistent and now exist. Death is but the solitary transformation of the dead; it is not that life gives rise to this death. Life, too, is but a solitary transformation. Life and death, each sufficient unto itself, form their own bodies—who could precede things? I take yin and yang to precede things, yet yin and yang are themselves but things. Who, then, precedes yin and yang? I take spontaneity to precede them, yet spontaneity is but the self-so of things. I take the supreme Dao to precede them, yet the supreme Dao is but supreme nothingness. Having nothing, what could precede it? Who, then, precedes things? Yet there are things without end, making clear that the spontaneity of things is not caused by anything. The sage’s ceaseless love for humanity is also drawn from this self-so. Thus, benevolence flows through a hundred generations without ceasing."

Lü’s Commentary:
"Who named Heaven and Earth? To know how Heaven and Earth are named is to know how they came to be. To know how they came to be is to know that before Heaven and Earth, it was as it is now. The spirit first receives it, attaining without thought. Yet you now seek it through what is not spirit—this is why it is not spirit. Ancient and present, end and beginning, are mutually dependent; without dependence, all is without. If you understand this, you will know what is meant by 'before Heaven and Earth.' That it can be known means that there can be descendants without first having sons. I refrain from answering to prevent you from seeking with an intentful mind. For the mind has its so-called life, and only then can it give rise to its death; the mind has its so-called death, and only then can it give rise to its life. This is the error of seeking with an intentful mind. Do life and death depend on something? The body is originally without dependence. Whether dependent or independent, all share one body. Knowing that life and death form one body, how could there be something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which existed before Heaven and Earth gives rise to things. That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Thus, things emerge, yet nothing precedes them. What is called 'the thing formed in chaos before Heaven and Earth' is but 'as there are things, so there are things'—without end. It has never begun to have things. The sage’s ceaseless love for humanity is also drawn from this. This is how Qian’s origin governs Heaven. The noble person embodies this to lead others."

Yi Du’s Commentary:
"Could what preceded Heaven and Earth truly be known? By inferring from what came after, it can be known. Xunzi said, 'The Way of the hundred kings lies in the later kings.' A thousand years ago is as today. At first, Ran Qiu asked with an empty mind; emptiness gives rise to spirit, so he was enlightened. Later, he heard the words but did not comprehend; his mind was obstructed, and what was not spirit arose, so he became benighted. Without ancient, without present, without beginning, without end—this is spoken of the spirit. Originally, there was no death; death arises from life. Originally, there was no life; life arises from death. Life and death each have their own body; neither depends on the other. The *Great Change* does not show qi; it is neither form nor qi. Thus, it can give rise to things. That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Though it emerges before things, it cannot precede them. As there are things, so there are things—without end. The sage’s love for things is not benevolence, yet his love never ceases. This, too, is drawn from this."

Guan Jian’s Commentary:
"Ran Qiu’s question had the force of thunder splitting mountains. The Master answered casually, causing him to pose his question amiss and withdraw. The measure of the sage’s capacity is thus revealed. The human body models Heaven and Earth; what preceded Heaven and Earth is the original state of one’s own body. Knowing the original state of one’s body is to know what preceded Heaven and Earth. Knowing what preceded Heaven and Earth is also inferred from what came after. The sage holds to the ancient to govern the present, and so must be able to infer the present to illuminate the ancient. How could it be merely that a hundred generations can be known? Heaven and Earth are but tiny things in the void, the greatest of all things with form. Form arises from the formless and must ultimately return to dissolution. Yet humans, dwelling in brief lives, cannot see this—like summer insects that know nothing of ice. 'The spirit first receives it'—to know its spirit is to be spirit. 'Yet you now seek it through what is not spirit'—not knowing the spirit within what is not spirit. Yesterday’s enlightenment came from using knowledge to seek what is called spirit; the spirit first received it. Today’s benightedness comes from hearing the Dao and forgetting knowledge; within what is not spirit, the spirit resides. Why must you seek further? Let him return to illuminate the source of the mind, attaining non-attainment, neither enlightened nor benighted, without ancient or present. Then life and death cannot bind him. 'Do not use life to give rise to death; do not use death to give rise to life'—each transforms alone, without dependence. All share one body. Is there something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Things emerge, yet nothing precedes them. As there are things, so there are things—without end. The sage’s ceaseless love for humanity is also drawn from this self-so."

Just as the breath you now exhale is not the breath you inhaled before, just as the flame before is not the flame after—this principle having been raised again, the question arises: Was there something that existed before Heaven and Earth? It is said that only the Dao dwells before Heaven and Earth; there is no thing that precedes Heaven and Earth. That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. The Dao gives birth to Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, yet it cannot be named as a thing. Once a thing emerges, it enters the realm of form and vessels, and thus cannot be what preceded things. It is because there are things that this is so.

Because there are things, from the One arise the Ten Thousand; from the Ten Thousand arise the countless, which daily press upon us. Few indeed are those who can stand firm and independent, unconfused by them. Thus we know that the endlessness of people and things arises from the endlessness of creation. Therefore, the sage’s heart of ceaseless love extends to all things without end. Yet all alike cannot escape the scattering of pure simplicity into dissipation. The governance of the Great Ancients through non-action cannot be recovered.

If one wishes to return to the governance of non-action of the Great Ancients, must one not seek well that which is before one’s own Heaven?

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, saying: "Hui has once heard from the Master that one should neither send off nor welcome anything. May Hui ask about its wandering?"

Confucius said: "The people of antiquity transformed externally but remained untransformed internally. The people of today transform internally but remain untransformed externally. Those who transform with things are one with transformation; those who do not transform are also one. Where is the stability in transformation or non-transformation? Where is the harmony with them? One must be in accord with them, yet not be excessive.

The parks of the House of Xiwei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of the Lord of Yu, the chambers of Tang and Wu—these were all places where the noble person, such as the followers of Ru and Mo, took teachers and used right and wrong to guard against each other. How much more so for the people of today?

The sage dwells among things without harming them; one who does not harm things cannot be harmed by things."

Only one who harms nothing can truly accompany others in meeting and parting. Mountains and forests, hills and marshes—do they bring me joy? My joy is not yet complete when sorrow already follows. Sorrow and joy come, and I cannot resist them; they depart, and I cannot halt them. How lamentable that the people of this world are but transient lodgers in the realm of things.

Those who know what they encounter yet do not know what they do not encounter, who know what they can do yet cannot do what they cannot—such ignorance and inability are unavoidable for all people. Yet to strive to avoid what cannot be avoided—is this not also lamentable?

Ultimate words transcend speech; ultimate action transcends doing. To equate knowledge with what is known is shallow indeed.

Guo’s commentary:
*By aligning the mind with form, form transforms of itself. Using the mind to direct form, one remains externally untransformed; with a constant absence of mind, one is unified in non-transformation. Only one who is unified in non-transformation can merge with the transformations of things. Whether transforming or not, all is left to the other—this is the absence of mind. Without mind, one allows spontaneous transformation, neither meeting nor following, neither conforming nor resisting, neither excessive nor deficient. To speak of "not meeting, not following" is to stop where one is content.
The parks, gardens, palaces, and chambers—these are where those without mind and who follow transformation dwell, the very places where the sages roamed.
"Preventing" means harmonizing. The followers of Ru and Mo, who took teachers to harmonize the most difficult things in the world, could still achieve harmony through absence of mind—how much more so for ordinary people?
To dwell among things without harming them is the utmost compliance. Things cannot harm one because the matter lies entirely with oneself. With absence of mind comes utmost compliance; with utmost compliance comes the ability to be free from obstruction, and thus one’s righteousness surpasses that of meeting and following.
Mountains, forests, hills, and marshes are no better than I, yet I find joy in them—this is joy without cause. Joy without cause is also sorrow without cause; thus, what brings joy is not truly joyful, and what brings sorrow is not truly sorrowful.
The people of this world cannot sit in forgetfulness and find contentment, so their sorrow and joy are merely lodged in things, like transient guests.
What one’s knowledge encounters is what one knows; what it does not encounter is what one does not know. What one cannot do cannot be forced into ability. From this perspective, knowledge and ignorance, ability and inability—control does not lie with me. One must entrust it all to nature.
Ignorance and inability are unavoidable for all people, for each is born with their own allotment.
Ultimate words and ultimate actions arise from self-attainment. What is gained through knowledge is but the work of scholars—hence, it is shallow.*

The Lü commentary states:
The ancients, when external things transformed, would transform with them and pass away; when things did not transform internally, there remained something unforgotten within. The people of today, when things transform internally, their hearts align with them, yet when things do not transform externally, they measure themselves against what lies ahead and do not perceive the passage of days.

Those who transform with things are unified—if there is no transformation, how can there be transformation? If there is transformation and non-transformation, then this is not the means by which non-transformation operates. How can one then move in harmony with things? Their conduct is like a gallop that cannot be halted.

To move with things without excess is neither to lead nor to follow—merely to respond without reservation. We speak of enclosures, gardens, palaces, and chambers: as the world declines further, those who wander grow fewer, and their dwellings grow narrower.

The gentlemen of the Ru and Mo schools still use right and wrong to guard against one another—such guarding inflicts deep harm. How much worse is it for the people of today, who do not move in harmony with one another?

It is difficult indeed.

The sage engages with things without harming them, allowing right and wrong to proceed side by side and come to rest in the harmony of Heaven. How can things harm what is evenly balanced? Thus, though the sage may lead and follow others, he wanders alone in the realm of no leading and no following.

The people of the world are enslaved by external things, and sorrow and joy find their way into their abodes. Mountains, forests, rivers, and plains may bring me joy, but it is not yet complete—sorrow soon follows. These two alternate without cease. Their coming cannot be resisted, their going cannot be stopped; thus, the self is merely lodged in things, like a transient guest.

One knows what one encounters but not what one does not encounter. When one encounters, one aligns with things; when one does not encounter, one departs from them. One can do what one is able to do but does not know what one cannot do. When able, one is enslaved by things; when unable, one enslaves things.

Ignorance and inability are unavoidable for all people—these are one’s inherent endowments, all of which can be sought. Yet people strive to avoid them. To reject what is unavoidable for all is to lose one’s nature most grievously. Is this not lamentable?

Ultimate words abandon words; ultimate actions abandon actions. To equalize what knowledge knows and strive to avoid what all people cannot avoid—though one may know it, such knowledge is shallow.

Those who follow their root—externally transformed yet internally untransformed—respond to things while the mind does not move with them. Internally transformed yet externally untransformed, the mind has no constancy and is jostled by affairs and things. To be transformed with things is external transformation; to remain untransformed is internal non-transformation. What is peace? What is meant by transformation? What is meant by non-transformation? How can one grind against them without being worn away, leaving scarcely anything intact?

From the leather-clad sages, the Yellow Emperor, and the era of Yao and Shun down to the Tang and Wu dynasties, and further to the Confucians, Mohists, and the School of Names—all have engaged in debates of right and wrong, guarding against one another. How much more so for people today? Guarding against one another is even more severe than grinding. Gardens are narrower than parks, and chambers are deeper than halls—each step only deepens the entrenchment. The character *shāng* (傷, harm) here reflects the *mó* (磨, grinding) and *fáng* (防, guarding) above.

**Supplementary Annotation:**
What human knowledge and consideration reach is called "encounter," yet what one encounters is limited. What one’s strength and capacity reach is called "ability," yet what one can do is limited. Thus, one cannot avoid having things one does not know or cannot do. If one does not rest in the truth of one’s nature and fate but vainly seeks beyond one’s allotted portion to be without ignorance or inability, then though one exhausts one’s essence and depletes one’s strength, what one does not know or cannot do only increases. Is this not lamentable? This is not discussed in terms of Heaven and humanity.

**General Observations:**
This chapter takes "knowledge" as its theme, for knowledge is the origin of action and speech. *The Northern Wanderer* seeks the root, implying a return to the source. The *Mysterious Waters* are most wondrous, yet they retain the merit of nourishing things. The parable of having a mind for the Dao—without non-action and non-assertion, one remains obscure to the Dao.

Thus, the three questions go unanswered, for not-knowing is true knowledge. The Yellow Emperor’s answers grow clearer, yet they draw no nearer to the Dao. Therefore, the sage sheds form, abandons knowledge, casts off the body, and dismisses hearing. Through non-action, the myriad things are completed; without speech, the world is transformed. One knows the Dao cannot be possessed, the body cannot be privatized. The existence of things arises from non-existence; the world is pervaded by a single qi. The wondrous and the foul alternate; yin and yang intermingle, spontaneously generating, bursting forth, and silently receding—this is common to all.

To be transformed with things yet remain untransformed is unique to the sage. Life and death follow transformation; one conceals one’s traces and lets go. Abiding in transformation, one follows transformation—without transformation, nothing is not transformed. Forgetting transformation, one is transformed; at peace with transformation, how could one not be at peace?

Each step descends further, hence the Dao resides in tiles and bricks. It employs what is borrowed, not what is owned, thus it excels. The hammer and hook—knowing today, one knows the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Without abiding, one does not depart. Without approaching or withdrawing, one harmonizes the transformations of inner and outer. Engaging with things, one is not harmed.

From this, one knows that those who do not depend on circumstances to be still are still in all things; those who do not depend on things to be joyful are joyful in all things. Transformation cannot move them, nor can burdens encroach. One day may be as a hundred years, a hundred years as a day—how can one know that today’s dwelling is not the Heaven and Earth within a gourd?

Observing the world’s people, they treat things as transient lodgings, yet repeatedly harm their lives and injure their natures through what they encounter and what they can do—no different from sinking sandalwood into a furnace, its fragrance rising only as its form turns to ash. Better to preserve one’s authenticity in not-encountering and inability.

The highest say: the teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain them. Thus, the *Nanhua* concludes the Outer Chapters with "ultimate words abandon words; ultimate actions abandon actions."

**Volume Six of *Zhuangzi Yi* from the *Siku Quanshu*, compiled by Jiao Hong of the Ming Dynasty**
**Miscellaneous Chapters: "Gengsang Chu" (Chapter Twenty-Three)**

Among Lao Dan’s disciples was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially grasped the Master’s Dao. He went north to dwell on Mount Weilei. Those among his retainers who were cunningly clever departed from him; those among his concubines who were ostentatiously kind kept their distance. Only the dull-witted and the self-contented remained to serve him. After three years, Weilei flourished. The people of Weilei said to one another: “When Master Gengsang first arrived, we found him strange and extraordinary. Now, when we reckon by the day, we feel we have not enough; when we reckon by the year, we find we have more than enough. He must be a sage! Why do we not together offer him the sacrifices due to the spirits of the soil and grain?”

When Gengsang Chu heard this, he turned to face south with a troubled countenance. His disciples were perplexed. Gengsang Chu said: “Disciples, why are you perplexed by me? When spring’s qi stirs, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in its proper time, the myriad treasures ripen. Is it that spring and autumn achieve this of themselves? The Great Dao has already been at work. I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse in a walled chamber, yet the common people rush about wildly, not knowing where to turn. Now, with the petty folk of Weilei, I am secretly being exalted. They wish to place me among the worthy on their sacrificial platters—am I to become a mere marker for others? This is why I cannot let go of Lao Dan’s words.”

---

Guo Xiang’s commentary:
*Huaran* describes those who adorn their cleverness; *qieran*, those who flaunt their kindness. *Yongzhong* refers to the unrefined; *yangzhang*, to self-contentment. The disciples were perplexed because Gengsang Chu had abandoned cleverness and embraced simplicity. He moves in accord with the four seasons, achieving nothing by deliberate effort. Spring and autumn bring growth and fruition, all through the natural course of the Dao, so he does nothing. The perfected person dwells like a corpse, and the people come of their own accord—not through any exercise of knowledge. Thus, he does not wish to become a marker for others. Laozi said: “When his task is accomplished and his work done, the people all say, ‘We have done it ourselves.’” Now, the people of Weilei do the opposite, which is why Gengsang Chu was troubled.

Lü Huiqing’s commentary:
Lao Dan’s Dao rejects kindness and discards cleverness; it does not exalt worthiness. It does not seek to enlighten the people but to make them simple. Thus, his retainers and concubines who were kind and clever all departed, while only the dull-witted and rigid remained. *Huaran* and *qieran* describe petty cleverness and kindness; *yongzhong* and *yangzhang* denote slowness and inflexibility—these are not those who rely on knowledge or kindness. The people of Weilei were transformed by Gengsang Chu’s Dao, no longer employing cleverness but devoting themselves to clothing and food. Thus, the land flourished. His actions were sufficient to renew the people’s eyes and ears, so they found him strange and extraordinary. His Dao was one of non-action that brought about success, so when reckoned by the day, it seemed insufficient, but when reckoned by the year, it was more than enough. *Shi* and *zhu* refer to the sacrifices offered by rulers and ancestral temples; the people wished to honor him as such. Spring and autumn are the work of Heaven, unknown to the myriad things. The sage dwells like a corpse, and the people do not know where to turn. Now, the petty folk of Weilei wished to place Gengsang Chu among the worthy on their sacrificial platters—this is what is meant by being unable to prevent people from relying on one. How could he not refuse to become a marker for others?

---

The *Xun* edition:
The perfected person dwells like a corpse in a walled chamber, and the people rush about wildly, not knowing where to turn. This means the perfected person remains obscure, and people do not know his name, so they wander without direction. *Shao* is the same as *biao*: when a tree is raised as a marker, all can see it.

Liu Gai’s summary:
“When his task is accomplished and his work done, the people all say, ‘We have done it ourselves.’” Yet the people of Weilei wished to offer sacrifices to Gengsang Chu—was his grasp of the Dao still incomplete? I have heard that if one possesses true substance, people may offer a name, but one should not accept it; to accept is to invite misfortune. Hearing this, Gengsang Chu turned south with a troubled countenance—was his compliance with things still incomplete? I have also heard that Yao did not possess people; people saw him as possessing them. His legacy endures a thousand generations later, but it is only his traces. Thus, Gengsang Chu’s Dao had reached non-action, but it had not yet attained non-non-action.

The disciples said: “Not so. In a ditch of ordinary size, a great fish has no room to turn its body, and the minnows and eels become its masters. On a hillock of a few fathoms, a great beast has no place to conceal itself, and the foxes and badgers become its omens. Moreover, to honor the worthy, bestow abilities, praise goodness, and confer benefits—this has been the way since Yao and Shun. How much more so for the people of Weilei? Master, you should listen to them.”

Gengsang Chu said: “Come here, my little ones. A beast that can be enclosed in a carriage, if it leaves the mountains, cannot escape the nets and snares. A fish that can swallow a boat, if it is stranded on land, can be harmed by ants. Thus, birds and beasts do not weary of great heights; fish and turtles do not weary of great depths. For one who preserves his form and life, to hide himself is not to weary of profound obscurity—it is enough. Moreover, what are those two worthies to me?”

In their disputations, they would recklessly breach walls to plant brambles and thistles—combing their hair only to count grains of rice for cooking, all in petty fuss. How could such things suffice to benefit the world? Promote the worthy, and the people will contend with one another; employ cunning, and the people will steal from one another. These practices cannot enrich the people. The people’s pursuit of profit is relentless: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers; in broad daylight, they rob, and at noon, they tunnel through walls. I tell you, the root of great chaos must arise between the eras of Yao and Shun, and its branches will endure for a thousand generations. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.

*(A fathom is eight feet; twice a fathom is a *chang*; six feet make a *bu*; seven feet make a *ren*. "Omens" refers to strange and uncanny things.)*

*(Guo’s commentary: The disciples believed that a great man must possess abundant emoluments, so they urged their master to heed them. His reply was to shun profit and avoid harm, thereby preserving his person whole—if one clings to emoluments, one becomes coarse and shallow, not even equal to fish and turtles. As for the two worthies, Yao and Shun, what merit is there in praising them? They will only cause later generations to recklessly engage in disruptive actions, planting disorder and filth.)*

The trimming of hair or the counting of grains is like tending to the tip of an awl or blade—when all is merged into oneness without deliberate action, only then can one achieve success. If one resists and contravenes one’s nature to await what one esteems, and if what is truly insufficient is pursued through cunning and artifice, then falsehood arises. To seek life through falsehood—how is this not theft? When the people are so ardent in their pursuit of profit that they cast aside all else, it stems from the traces left by Yao and Shun, their embellished deceits sowing the seeds of later corruption.

*(Lü’s commentary: Lao Dan regarded the root as refined and things as coarse, accumulation as insufficiency. Abiding in serene solitude, he dwelt with the spirit luminaries. Chu attained Lao Dan’s Dao, thus concealing himself without tiring of profound obscurity, leaving Yao and Shun’s virtue behind and refusing to emulate them. To distinguish Yao and Shun within the realm where things have never yet arisen—how is this different from chiseling a wall to plant mugwort? It is neither fitting nor useful. Only by aiding things in their natural course without presuming to act can one achieve simplicity and efficacy. Otherwise, it is like trimming hair or counting grains—how can this save the world? The sage’s governance renders the people without knowledge and without desire. Yet observing through the traces of Yao and Shun, one cannot avoid elevating the worthy and employing cunning, ultimately leading to mutual contention and plunder. Thus, the greatness of human nature is altered by knowledge and action, and from this arises the source of disorder.)*

Nan Rong Chu rose abruptly and sat upright, saying: "As for one such as Chu, my years have already grown long. To what end..."

Nan Rong Chu, grasping at this teaching, asked: "Is it truly possible to attain such words?"

Geng Sang Zi replied: "Preserve your form whole, embrace your life—do not let your thoughts and cares flutter restlessly. If you can do this for three years, then you may reach these words."

Nan Rong Chu said: "The eye and the form—I know not their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves. The ear and the form—I know not their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves. The heart and the form—I know not their difference, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The form and the form should be one, yet things somehow come between them. I long to seek and attain this, yet now you tell me: *Preserve your form whole, embrace your life—do not let your thoughts and cares flutter restlessly.* I strain to hear the Dao, but my ears alone are open."

Geng Sang Zi said: "My words are exhausted. The fleeing bee cannot transform the hornworm; the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg, but the Lu chicken surely can. Chickens and chickens—their virtue is not different, yet some can and some cannot, for their capacities are inherently great or small. Now my capacity is small and insufficient to transform you. Why not go south to see Laozi?"

*(Annotations in original: Nan Rong Chu is listed as Nan Rong Chou in the *Gujin Ren Biao*. The "fleeing bee" is a small wasp. The "hornworm" is a large green caterpillar found in bean leaves. "Swan" here uses the ancient character for "crane.")*

Guo's commentary: *"Preserve your form"* means to guard your allotted portion; *"embrace your life"* means not to grasp at what lies beyond life. Eyes with eyes, ears with ears, minds with minds—their forms may resemble one another, yet their capacities differ. If there are differences, one cannot forcibly imitate another. *"Whole"* does not mean closed off; the two forms are open yet cannot attain one another—something must come between them. Having heard early that forms are separated, transformation thus becomes difficult.

Lü's commentary: Virtue left Yao and Shun behind not because it left no traces—it was perfect. Yet how could one prevent karma and still attain this? The answer: the form that humans constantly preserve, where spirit obtains life, is one and the same. How could external things be the affliction? But when ears and eyes cling to sounds and sights, nose and mouth cling to scents and flavors, and the mind is enslaved by things, then the form is diminished and not whole, life is severed and not embraced, and thoughts and cares flutter restlessly without cease. Thus one cannot be free of things. Only by preserving the form whole, embracing life, and having no restless thoughts can the constant mind be attained. Where then could so-called sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness find a place? As for the ears...

The eyes do not distinguish sounds and colors, the mind’s knowing does not discern right and wrong—this is what the world calls deafness and madness. Yet for those who follow the Dao, not seeing for oneself is blindness, not hearing for oneself is deafness, not attaining for oneself is madness. Madness and sageliness lie only in whether one clings to thoughts or not. My form and another’s form both preserve spirit, and spirit has no fixed direction. How could there be anything that closes and does not open? The reason they seek each other yet cannot attain one another is merely that something intervenes. Though Chu claims never to have heard the Dao, what he knows already differs from ordinary people—he simply has not yet matched Zhuangzi’s words with his own heart.

The superficial may reach the ears, but when spirit awakens, it penetrates the heart. How could a puddle’s minnows know the transformation of the kun and peng? How could a wasp’s nest contain the fledgling of a roc? The principle is naturally so. This is why Gengsangzi declined Chu’s questions, wishing to conceal his mad words to preserve himself and defer to the ultimate principle with Lao Dan.

The human mind, eyes, and ears are all open, yet the mad cannot attain themselves, just as the deaf and blind perceive nothing. My form and others’ forms are fundamentally open and unobstructed, yet now they are divided by desires. Seeking mind with mind, they cannot attain one another. You taught me not to let thoughts flutter restlessly—if I strive in this, might I yet reach understanding? Chu’s words show no sign of liberation, and Gengsangzi, wishing to prevent further delusion, could only say, “My words are exhausted.”

Nanrong Chu carried provisions for seven days and nights until he reached Laozi’s abode. Laozi said, “Have you come from Chu?”
Nanrong Chu replied, “Yes.”
Laozi said, “Why have you brought so many people with you?”
Nanrong Chu looked back in alarm. Laozi said, “Do you not understand what I mean?”
Nanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed, “Now I have forgotten my answer and lost my question.”
Laozi said, “What do you mean?”
Nanrong Chu said, “Is it not so? People call me foolish, yet if I were wise, I would only grieve for my body. If I were not benevolent, I would harm others, yet if I were benevolent, I would grieve for myself. If I were not righteous, I would injure others, yet if I were righteous, I would grieve for myself. How can I escape this? These three concerns are what trouble me. I wish to ask you about them through Chu.”
Laozi said, “Just now, I saw it in the space between your brows, and thus I understood you. Now you speak again, and I believe you—yet you are so narrow-minded, as if you had lost your parents and were holding a pole to search for them in the sea. You are lost! Bewildered! You wish to return to your true nature yet have no way in. How pitiful!”

Nanrong Chu asked to enter and rest in the guest quarters. He summoned what he loved and cast aside what he despised. After ten days of sorrow, he saw Laozi again. Laozi said, “You have cleansed yourself—how thoroughly! Yet you remain so burdened.”

Yet within you, there lingers a lingering aversion. Those bound by external fetters cannot be grasped by clinging, nor can those shackled within be seized by twisting. How much less can those who let the Dao run wild and act without restraint hold fast to virtue and power?

Nanrong Chu said, “When a villager falls ill, another villager asks after him. The sick man can describe his illness, yet the one who is truly ill does not know his own sickness. Now, when I hear the great Dao, it is like taking medicine that only worsens my condition. I wish only to hear the classic of preserving life.”

Laozi said, “Can you embrace the One and never lose it? Can you foretell fortune and misfortune without divination? Can you come to rest? Can you cease striving? Can you abandon seeking in others and turn inward to seek in yourself? Can you be carefree? Can you be uncontrived? Can you be like a child?

A child may wail all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of harmony. A child may clench its fist all day without cramping—such is the constancy of its power. A child may gaze all day without blinking—its attention is not fixed on externals. It walks without knowing where it goes, dwells without knowing what it does, moves with things and flows with their current. This is the classic of preserving life.”

The ears and eyes belong to the external, while the mind’s workings reside within. To preserve form and embrace life, nothing compares to forgetting the mind’s workings and abandoning the ears and eyes. Yet when sounds and sights entangle the external, the mind’s workings become obstructed within; when desires and aversions entangle the internal, the ears and eyes are lost to the external. Thus, only by having no gains and no losses can one attain thoroughfare. Even partial entanglement is unacceptable—how much worse when both external and internal are ensnared?

The ears and eyes are bewildered by the external, while the mind’s workings drift and surge within. Though one may grasp with frantic hands and bind with anxious care, one cannot halt it. Embracing the One without parting is to abide in one’s nature; not losing it is to return and find oneself. Rightness brings fortune, excess brings misfortune—no divination is needed. "Coming to rest" means resting within one’s allotment; "ceasing striving" means leaving no trace behind. "Abandoning seeking in others and turning inward" is to preserve the self without imitating others. "Carefree" means leaving no lingering traces; "uncontrived" means having no obstructions.

The throat does not grow hoarse because it lets sound emerge naturally, not through joy or anger. The hand does not cramp because it lets itself clench naturally, not through deliberate effort. The eyes do not blink because they let themselves see naturally, not fixed upon forms. Walking without knowing the destination, the feet proceed of their own accord, unobstructed. Dwelling without knowing what to do, the body follows its own course. Flowing with things and following their current—this is compliance. Moving with their waves, one’s own waves merge with theirs.

To know obstruction is to detest the mind’s turbulence and wish to cleanse it, returning to emptiness and stillness—this is to summon the good and dispel the bad. Yet one remains unable to practice this, and so the gloomy qi fills one’s essence, seeping and leaking. Where things cling and prove difficult to remove, one now resents the ears and eyes for being ensnared by sounds and sights, yet seeks to grasp and hold them—this is frantic restraint. Better to inwardly close off: when the mind does not go forth, the external is not entangled. As Laozi said, "Block the openings, shut the doors."

When the mind’s workings are entangled by affairs and endeavors, and one seeks to halt them one by one—this is anxious restraint. Better to outwardly close off: when things do not enter, the internal is not entangled. As Laozi said, "Open the gates, untie the tangles." Thus, in perfect stillness and non-action, the myriad things cannot disturb the mind. Otherwise, even those with the Way and its power may fail to maintain it—how much more those who merely imitate?

Those who hear the Dao know that from the beginning there has been nothing to do. You have diagnosed your own illness but lack the medicine of the great Dao; you wish only to hear the classic of preserving life. Preserving life takes non-action as its classic. The One is where the Dao arises, where auspiciousness abides—what need is there for divination? All this comes from halting one’s thoughts and endeavors and seeking within oneself. Carefree without attachment, uncontrived without obstruction—thus one becomes like a child.

If one’s howls arise from grief and rage yet remain unharmonized, how can their power not be hoarse? To the point of grasping without knowing it is a grasp, seeing without knowing it is sight—all movement and stillness arise from non-mind, flowing with things like waves in a current: this is the classic of preserving life.

**Following the Root:**
*"Vexation"* (韄) means binding things with leather to restrain them; *"barrier"* (揵) refers to the bolt of a door, closing it off. If one restrains the external with excessive complexity, rendering it ungraspable, one will instead shut it out internally. If one restrains the internal with delusion and chaos, rendering it ungraspable, one will instead shut it out externally. When both internal and external are bound, the affliction is thus.

**Brush Notes:**
To embrace the One and not lose it is what the *Dao De Jing* calls *"carrying spirit and soul, embracing the One, able to not part."* To know good and ill fortune without divination is *"not stepping out the door yet knowing the world, not peering through the window yet seeing the Dao of Heaven."* To halt is to know when to stop; to cease is to know contentment. Abandoning others to seek within oneself is *"the self-knowing are enlightened, the self-conquering are strong."* *"Carefree"* (翛然) is *"floating—how it may drift left or right!"* *"Uncontrived"* (侗然) is *"blended—how it seems turbid!"* *"Child"* is *"concentrating qi to attain softness, able to be like an infant."* Harmony at its utmost shares its power universally, not residing externally—this is what is meant by *"containing virtue in abundance, comparable to a newborn."*

Nanrong Chu said: "Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?"
"No," was the reply. "This is merely what is called *ice melting, frost dissolving.* The perfected person shares sustenance with others on earth and shares joy with them in heaven, not entangled by the gains and harms of people and things. They do not conspire in strangeness, do not scheme together, do not engage in affairs. They come and go carefree, uncontrived—this is called the classic of preserving life."
Chu said: "Then is this perfection?"
"Not yet. I have already told you: can you be like a child? A child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like the branch of a withered tree, its mind like dead ashes. In this state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune. Fortune and misfortune have no place, nor do the calamities of others."

**Guo’s Commentary:**
Chu asks: "If one can reform oneself and apply these words, can this be called the virtue of the perfected person?" *"Ice melting, frost dissolving"* means being able—yet this is not something one achieves alone. *"Sharing sustenance, sharing joy"* arises from having no self, all being shared with things. Chu then asks: "Can one attain perfection simply by hearing these words?" The answer is no—these words are not perfection itself, but merely what one who hears and studies may follow. If one does not attain it oneself, then even hearing the words of perfection can only serve as a classic—how can one reach perfection? Thus, the learner does not reach it; the perfected does not learn. Misfortune and fortune arise from loss and gain; the calamities of others stem from love and hate. Now, with the extremity of a withered tree and dead ashes—utterly without emotion—love and hate, loss and gain have no way to arise.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The human mind, serene like water, is obstructed by knowledge and cannot remain empty—like water freezing into ice. Knowing the classic of preserving life, the ice melts and the frost dissolves. The perfected person’s mind is always like water, so their virtue is not cultivated yet things cannot depart from them. They share sustenance and joy without entanglement in gain and harm. Not conspiring in strangeness, they are not seen as strange by the world; not scheming together, they are not aligned with the world. Without attachment or obstruction, how could they fail to embrace the One and not lose it? Carefree and uncontrived—what more need be asked? This is why the perfected person is the constant of preserving life, yet not its ultimate. The so-called ultimate is merely what lies beyond knowing. The child’s not knowing where it goes or what it does, being like a withered tree or dead ashes—this is it. Misfortune and fortune arise from having a body and mind, governed by heaven, earth, and spirits. If one’s body is withered and mind is ash, how can they be burdened?

**Personal Insight:**
The true nature is like water—empty, bright, clear, and profound, neither existent nor nonexistent. When obscured by worldly desires, it congeals like water freezing into ice. Water is utterly clear yet freezes into impure ice; spirit is utterly numinous yet congeals into dull form. Hearing the Dao and awakening to principle, the ice melts and frost dissolves—what harm is there to clarity and numinosity? The problem lies in not turning inward to seek. *"Sharing sustenance on earth"* means tilling and laboring together; *"sharing joy in heaven"* means harmonizing with the great harmony. If so, how could the gains and harms of people and things reach them? What use are strange actions, schemes, or affairs? Coming and going, how could they not be at ease? How could the classic of life not be preserved? Attaining this in learning the Dao is already perfection—yet it is still called *"not yet."* When pressed on what perfection is, the earlier words about the child are repeated—this is the teacher’s technique, shifting the listener’s perspective to prevent attachment.

**When the abode of the spirit is stable and settled, it emits the light of heaven.** When it emits the light of heaven, people see the person, but the person has cultivation—only now is there constancy. Those with constancy are abandoned by people yet aided by heaven. What people abandon are called *"heavenly people"*; what heaven aids are called *"heavenly sons."* The learner learns what they cannot learn; the doer does what they cannot do; the debater debates what they cannot debate. Knowing when to stop at what cannot be known—this is perfection. If there is any deviation, the balance of heaven will ruin it.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
When the abode of virtue is stable and settled, what it emits is the light of heaven, not human brilliance. When the light of heaven emits itself, people see the person, and things see things—each seeing itself, not seeing what makes the other stable and settled. If one cultivates as a person, one naturally attains it. Thus, there is constant stability, and one can return to dwell in one’s own abode, naturally receiving aid. Going forth, one is a heavenly son; staying, one is a heavenly person—both arise from stability and self-attainment, not from striving. Thus, all one’s abilities—though acted upon—are not action; though practiced—are not learning; though spoken—are not debate. What cannot be known cannot be forced to know, so stopping at this is perfection. If one intends to act, one will surely fail, for principle ultimately cannot be forced.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
The body is the abode of the person. Without obstruction or chaos, it emits the light of heaven. The light of heaven is unknowing and unperceiving, clear and penetrating. People see the person yet do not know their heaven—this is a person in appearance yet heaven in reality. Those who cultivate must reach heaven to endure. *"Abandoned by people"* means being among the crowd; *"aided by heaven"* means attaining heaven alone. The heavenly person is not something people can possess; the heavenly son arises from following heaven’s mandate. The things of the world can be known—thus, what can be learned is learned, what can be done is done, what can be debated is debated. Only the Dao cannot be known—thus, learning what cannot be learned is *"learning the unlearnable"* (as the classic says); doing what cannot be done is *"the Dao of the undone"*; debating what cannot be debated is *"the debate of the unspoken."* If one deviates from this and does not avoid action, one will fail.

To prepare things for the body’s form, to store against the unforeseen for the mind’s life, to revere the center to reach the other—if one is thus, then the myriad evils that arrive are all of heaven, not of man. They are not enough to disturb the marrow or become lodged within the *lingtai*. The *lingtai* has something it holds yet does not know what it holds, and what cannot be held. It does not see its own sincerity when it acts, and with every act it misses the mark; when karma enters and does not abide, with every change it becomes a loss—is this not doing evil? In the midst of clarity, can people condemn it as evil? In the midst of seclusion, can demons condemn it as evil? Only when one is enlightened can one act alone. Those who act within their contract remain within bounds; those who act beyond their contract set their minds on what is costly. To act without a name is merely to have light; to set one’s mind on what is costly is only to be a merchant. People see their striving as towering, yet it is but a hollow prominence. Those who exhaust themselves with things allow things to enter; those who merely accompany things cannot even contain themselves. One who can contain others yet cannot contain others has no kinship. One who has no kinship treats all people as enemies. No weapon is more cruel than the will; no bandit is more base than yin and yang. There is no escape from them between heaven and earth—unless yin and yang harm the mind, it is the mind that commands them.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
It means preparing for oneself and following the completion of form, allowing the mind to arise naturally—not through calculation or foresight. It reaches the other of its own accord, not by neglecting the center while revering the exterior. If one is thus and the myriad evils arrive, it is the natural principle of heaven’s ebb and flow. Evil that arises from action is of man; accepting it as fate is to remain undisturbed. What does not disturb the *lingtai* is the mind—clear and unobstructed, so that worries and misfortunes cannot enter. "Having something it holds" means not being moved by things, yet in truth it is not holding. If one knows what it holds and tries to hold it, holding is lost. Action that does not arise from one’s own sincerity—how can it be fitting? Affairs that do not reside within one’s proper role are thus lost. If one is without guilt in both the hidden and the manifest, one can act alone without fear, fulfilling one’s contract. Those who move within their bounds act without seeking a name; those who move beyond their bounds expect benefit or loss, seeking to expend themselves for things. To act without a name is to inherently possess this light and employ it. To set one’s mind on what is costly is, though one lacks it oneself, to borrow from others and trade like a merchant. Those who set their minds on what is costly appear to people as striving, yet they deem themselves secure. "Exhausting" refers to beginning and end; "merely accompanying" refers to acting beyond one’s contract while striving. One who strives cannot stand; one who can contain themselves cannot contain themselves, let alone contain others. How then can they have kinship? Thus, they treat all others as enemies, and their wills clash like scorching fire and congealing ice. Their weapons are sharper than swords and shields, for when the mind commands qi, yin and yang gather and bind in the five viscera. Wherever they reside, yin and yang are inescapable.

---
**Lü’s Commentary:**
The myriad things and I are one. "Preparing things for the body’s form" means that wherever one goes, things follow; when things come, the mind emerges—not born of foresight. Thus, reverence arises and reaches the other, not by holding externally but by revering to straighten the interior. If one is thus and the myriad evils arrive, they are of heaven, for they arise from not acting and thus failing. They are not enough to disturb the completion of the *lingtai*. When unmoved, it has something it holds, yet what holds it is unknown—it is held by not holding. Knowing this, what is called sincerity acts and must hit the mark; otherwise, reckless action brings misfortune—how could it be fitting? Karma enters from without yet has no master within, and thus it does not abide. "Does not abide" means it departs swiftly; "with every change it becomes a loss" refers to vulgar learning that seeks to return to the origin yet cannot avoid being deluded by *huanbi*. A contract is what governs things and possesses them. Acting with what one has within is acting within one’s contract—sincerity acting alone. Acting without what one has within is acting beyond one’s contract—sincerity is not seen, and the hidden and manifest are not unified. "Without a name" is the Dao, thus it is trustworthy yet does not expect; it does not expend. Those who act beyond their contract must first expect and expend to be trustworthy and to give. Only the ordinary have light that is not used, returning to its brightness; only merchants trade. It is merely a marketplace. People see their insufficiency and strive in admiration, like something towering and self-important. If one can see that things have never begun, then one exhausts things and has no self; with no self, things enter without obstruction—this is called knowing the constant and containing it. Otherwise, one merely accompanies things, and the self cannot contain itself. As it is said, "Your fragment of body will not be accepted by qi; your single joint will not be borne by the earth"—how then can one contain others? One who cannot contain others has no kinship; with no kinship, all people are as enemies. The will as a weapon harms the mind; *moye* blades harm the body. Bandits as thieves can be escaped, but the bandits of yin and yang cannot be escaped between heaven and earth. Only the perfected person weakens their will and does not insist, thus having no weapon. Hidden in the non-yin and non-yang, with no mind, the myriad things cannot steal from them.

---
**Xu’s Commentary:**
A contract is a union. Union within has no name; union without always has expectations and expenditures. One who strives to stand is seen by people as towering, yet is not truly towering—towering is not *kuang*. To speak of expectations and expenditures while forcing oneself is like this: pursuing things and going forth, things also enter—transformed by things. Those who merely accompany things are like those who temporarily agree yet their minds are not in it. With the mind not in it, the self cannot even contain itself—how can it be with others? Thus, outside the self there is no kinship; with no kinship, all are the people of the crowd.

---
**Supplementary Note:**
"Expecting expenditures" means seeking broadly and striving for much, like the saying "not discarding the small or the great"—thus it is likened to a merchant, meaning it is like commerce.

---
**Hong Mai’s Note:**
Guo Xiang said: "Having something it holds means not being moved by things, yet in truth it is not holding. If one knows what it holds and tries to hold it, holding is lost."

Chen Bixu said: "The true master abides within—following one’s formed mind as teacher." All these place their discourse beyond the realm of words and meaning, delving ever deeper into the profound, borrowing the words of *Zhuangzi* to expound, yet missing the original intent.

I once recall Hong Qingshan’s remark: "This chapter speaks of the Dao of holding the mind. If one does not know the means by which it is held, it can no longer be held." The two earlier interpretations were misled by the word "and," thus constructing their explanations accordingly.

The Dao flows through its allotted portion. What completes it also destroys it. What is detested in allotment is the allotment itself—what completes it is the very reason it is detested. Thus, emerging without return reveals its *gu*—emerging yet attaining is called attaining annihilation, possessing the reality of *gu* as one.

By means of the formed, one images the formless and settles it. Emerging without origin, entering without aperture—possessing reality yet nowhere to reside. Having growth yet no root, swiftness without source—this is space. Having growth yet no root, swiftness without source—this is time. There is that from which life arises, there is that from which...

The dead—does it have a "from"? The emergent—does it have a "from"? Entering and emerging without visible form—this is called the Celestial Gate. The Celestial Gate is Non-Being. All things emerge from Non-Being. Being cannot take Being as its Being; it must emerge from Non-Being. Yet Non-Being itself is not a "one" of Non-Being. The sage conceals himself therein.

Guo Xiang’s Annotation:
Completion and destruction are without constancy, yet the Dao flows through all allotments. Not abiding by one’s allotment while seeking completion—this is why allotment is detested. The root allotment is incomplete, yet one seeks completion through it—this is why completion is detested. If the root allotment were inherently complete, how could it be detested? Not returning to guard one’s allotment within, then death will not be long in coming. Not emerging yet attaining nothing—only then is life attained. Once one’s nature is extinguished, even if this life remains, how does it differ from *gu*? Even if this form remains, if one can be vast and without attachment, then life is preserved and form stabilized. Sudden emergence arises without root; sudden death occurs without source. What emerges does so from its own reality. That from which it emerges has no root or aperture. Space has four directions—above, below, and the four quarters—yet these are without limit. Time has the length of past and present, yet this length is without end. Death and life, emergence and entry—all occur suddenly of themselves, without cause, and thus no form is seen. The Celestial Gate is the great name for the convergence of the ten thousand things, like the "gate of all mysteries." Death and life, emergence and entry—sudden and self-so, without any agent. Yet gathering and scattering, concealment and revelation, give rise to the names of emergence and entry, though in truth there is no emergence, no entry, no gate. Where, then, could a gate reside? Thus, Non-Being is the gate. If Non-Being is the gate, then there is no gate. Before Being arises, what generates it? It must arise from itself. How could Being possess the power to generate Being? Clearly, Being cannot generate Being but arises of itself—not that Non-Being generates Being. If Non-Being could generate Being, what would Non-Being be? If Non-Being were a "one," it would be utterly null. That Non-Being is utterly null proves that Being arises suddenly of itself. Thus, the sage allows things to arise of themselves without generating life.

Lü Huiqing’s Annotation:
All things possess the Dao, so there is no completion or destruction—only their allotment, which is why the Dao flows through them. Completion is what gives rise to destruction; why detest allotment? Because it is completed. Why detest completion? Because of allotment. Completion is the fulfillment of allotment. If completion is set against allotment, then allotment becomes distinct from flow. If completion arises not from non-action but from deliberate effort, then it diverges from destruction. This is how the Dao disperses. Only by allotting without seeking completion, and completing without relying on completion, can one flow without obstruction. The Dao is without death or life, yet if there is life, it must return to what has never been born—then life is preserved. Emerging without returning, though alive, reveals its *gu*. Emerging and attaining—this is the result of deliberate action, and thus death is fitting. Extinguished yet possessing reality, it cannot return to the formless. Emerging without return and emerging to attain—how do these differ? Thus, their *gu* is one. Only by using the formed to image the formless can one settle it. Settled, one is not disturbed by death or life. Things that emerge must have a root, yet those emerging from the Dao have no root. Things that enter must have an aperture, yet those entering the Dao have no aperture. Things possessing reality must have a place, yet those emerging without root have reality without place. Things possessing growth must have a source, yet those entering without aperture have growth without source. Thus, the text should read: "Emerging without root, possessing reality; entering without aperture, possessing growth." Only then is the meaning complete. Space has four directions—above, below, and the four quarters—yet it possesses reality. If I take what is above me as "above," then what is above that becomes "below" for me. The same applies to what is below and the four quarters—where, then, is there a fixed place? Time has the length of past and present, yet it has no source. If I take the past as "past," then what comes after the present becomes "past"—where, then, is there a source? Realizing this, the cosmos cannot constrain one; the six directions open freely, and there is nowhere one is not present. Though death and life, emergence and entry exist, no form is seen—this is called the Celestial Gate. The Celestial Gate is Non-Being. Being cannot generate Being; it must emerge from Non-Being. The things of the world arise from Being, and Being arises from Non-Being—this is so. What is called "Non-Being" is not the absence of Being but the absence of any "one" of Non-Being—utter nullity. The sage conceals himself therein, roaming where things cannot escape and all are preserved.

The "Deputy Ink" [a metaphor for written teachings]:

The Dao is the uncarved simplicity of pre-heaven. When this simplicity scatters, it divides; when it divides, there is formation and destruction—but the Dao has never once departed from them. Thus, to penetrate its divisions, to penetrate its formations, to penetrate its destructions—none of these are not the Dao. When it divides, the Dao resides in the division; one need not seek completeness in its unity. The same holds true for formation and destruction: follow its inherent division, and each rests in what it ought to attain—thus, there is no aversion.

The aversion to division arises from the burden of seeking completeness. The aversion to seeking completeness stems from the notion that there is something to be complete. With this notion, one sees completeness but not division; thus, division brings anxiety. One sees formation but not destruction; thus, destruction brings sorrow. This is not knowing that the Dao is all-penetrating and cannot enter without self-attainment.

For one who knows the Dao, it is otherwise: though there be destruction and division, nothing is not at peace. When death comes, one is at peace with death and does not seek completeness in life. Thus, "emerging without returning" is the metaphor for emerging without returning—single-minded in this, without turning to that.

For humans, emerging and attaining this is the Dao of non-return. People call this death, yet how would they know that what perishes is not lost? Thus, to guard it is to have the reality of the "One." The One is the actual ground of principle. Therefore, extinction is not extinction, emptiness is not emptiness—this is because the metaphor of the "One" reveals the true principle of creation, which does not lie beyond it.

Thus, in human affairs, all is settled. Settled, there is no mind that seeks completeness, and formation and destruction, division and unity are all at peace. In life, one comes without root—hence it is called "emerging" without origin. In death, one departs without gate—hence it is called "entering" without aperture. Without origin, without aperture, there is no direction or place. Thus, it is said: "There is reality yet no place," and "There is length yet no beginning or end"—this is the true principle.

That there is reality yet no place means above and below, the four directions are all one. That there is length yet no beginning or end means past and present are all one. Emergence and entry, death and life—none do not proceed from this. Yet if one seeks its form, it is utterly unattainable. Hence, it is called the Celestial Gate.

To say that Non-Being is the Celestial Gate is not to posit Non-Being as something, but to negate even Non-Being. When both person and dharma are forgotten, subject and object are both relinquished—this is the sage’s desire to conceal the spirit. Beyond this, there is no refuge.

The ancients’ knowledge reached a certain point—where did it reach? It reached the point of taking what has not yet begun to be a thing as the ultimate. This is perfection, the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. Those of the next rank took things as existing, regarding life as loss and death as return. Thus, they divided themselves. Those of yet another rank said: first there was Non-Being, then there was life, and life soon becomes death. They took Non-Being as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail. Who knows the one who abides in the unity of Being, Non-Being, death, and life? I would befriend such a one. Though these three ranks differ, they belong to the same clan—like the Zhao and Jing lineages, the eminent Dai, and the noble Jia, each distinguished by their insignia. They are not one, yet life is obscure, and when one declares, “This shifts,” it is as if one has spoken of this shift—but this is not what was meant. Nevertheless, it remains unknowable.

The sacrificial ox’s tripe and hooves may be separated, yet they cannot be truly separated. One who observes a house surveys its halls and ancestral temples, then proceeds to its privies. In this way, what is raised up is shifted. Thus, they propose: “Let us speak of this shift.” They take life as the root and knowledge as the teacher, riding upon right and wrong. As a result, names and realities become fixed, and the self is taken as the standard, leading people to treat it as their own measure. They even repay this measure with death. If this is so, then utility is deemed wisdom, disuse is deemed folly, success is deemed fame, and failure is deemed disgrace. This is the “shift” of people today.

This is like the cicada and the owl, which are the same in their sameness. Guo’s commentary: “Life as loss—loss is dispersion and departure toward gathering. Death as return—return is the restoration of fusion. Though one may wish to equalize them, they are already divided. Thus, some take Being as Non-Being, some take Being as One, and some divide and equalize them. Though these three differ in completeness and incompleteness, all can free their hearts from right and wrong, hence they are called the same clan. The Zhao, Jing, Dai, and Jia, though all of the same clan, are not identical—thus the three ranks mentioned earlier are again differentiated. *Yan* (obscurity) is simply the gathering of qi. Once it is openly divided, each takes what it takes as right. Since rightness has no constancy, it is called ‘shift.’ The shift of what is right has already been established before words. If one does not speak of the shift, the shift remains unknowable—hence the attempt to speak of it.

The sacrificial ox’s tripe and hooves are an analogy: things each have their use. *Yan* refers to privies. Halls and temples are for feasting, while privies are for relieving oneself. When one relieves oneself, the rightness of halls and temples shifts to the privy. Thus, the shift of right and wrong is now here, now there—who can make it constant? The perfected person thus rides upon it, equalizing all. In the ceaseless transformations of things, wherever there is life, there is the root. Taking knowledge as the teacher, though what is known differs, each takes their own knowledge as their teacher. Riding upon right and wrong means having no right or wrong. That names and realities are fixed means that the names and realities of things are each inherently their own. *Zhi* (substance) is the master. Things each take themselves as sufficient to be the master of right and wrong, all claiming to be right—thus none communicate. In holding to their position, they are not truly liberated. Those who distinguish wisdom and folly, fame and disgrace cannot follow what they encounter and find peace in it.

The people of profound antiquity had no right or wrong—what shift could there be? Thus, it is said: ‘The shift belongs to the people of today.’ To be the same in sameness is no different for the cicada and the owl.” Lü’s commentary: “Though the three ranks differ, all return to the Dao, just as they belong to the same clan, though the Zhao, Jing, Dai, and Jia differ in closeness and distance. That within the realm of what has not yet begun to be a thing there is life is like the skin having a blemish—it is not its true body. Yet the two schools’ discussions openly divide, one taking things as existing and regarding life as loss, the other taking the beginning as Non-Being, then suddenly there is life. Thus, the wholeness of what has not yet begun to be a thing shifts to become the blemish of having life—this too is unknowable.

It is like the sacrificial feast, which assembles a hundred things, including tripe and hooves. These cannot be called not part of the hundred things, yet they cannot be separated. They cannot be separated because they are at the base of the body. One who observes a house surveys its halls and temples, then proceeds to its privies. The privy cannot be called not part of the house, yet one cannot speak of it as grand. The observer does so because of its lowly place. The Dao is present everywhere, so one cannot speak of a shift. What is spoken of as right and wrong is like this. The two schools’ theories are thus called ‘raising the shift’—this is why they have not reached the utmost, not attained perfection.

The theory of the shift begins with the existence of life, thus taking life as the root. Life arises from having knowledge, thus taking knowledge as the teacher. Following this, they ride upon each other, and right and wrong multiply. When right and wrong shift, names and realities become fixed, and the self is taken as the standard. At its worst, one takes what one deems right as one’s own measure and holds to it, even repaying it with death. They do not know that the so-called self is also what has not yet begun to be a thing. Use and disuse, success and failure—none of these are the self. Yet they falsely create distinctions of wisdom and folly, fame and disgrace. This is the flaw of the ‘shift’ of people today. Like the owl being the same in its sameness, how can they know the greatness of the Celestial Pond?”

Bi Xu’s commentary: “The Zhao and Jing are collateral branches of the Chu ducal clan. *Zhuo Dai* refers to their grand attire, *Jia Shi* to their lofty lineage, and *Zhuo Feng* to their abundant domains and counties. Though their affairs differ, they do not depart from the Chu capital. Just as life and death, though different, both emerge from the primordial qi.” Xun Ben’s commentary: “*Dai* refers to office and rank, *Feng* to fiefdoms. Though the three ranks differ, they are like the Zhao and Jia, all of the Chu ducal clan, distinguished only by their offices or fiefs, hence their differences. *Yan* is the soot at the bottom of a cauldron. *Piran* means scattered. *Yi Shi* (shift) refers to what is called rightness being unstable. The soot at the bottom of a cauldron, once scattered, shifts without constancy—hence it is called ‘shift.’ Like the sacrificial feast, where tripe and hooves are divided on the platter, they can be separated, yet as parts of one ox’s body, they cannot be separated. Or like observing a house, one must survey its halls and temples to call it complete, yet one must also proceed to its privies. Observing one requires division, while uniting requires combination. This is the unknowable. From this perspective, where is there a true rightness? The cicada and the owl are two creatures, yet they are the same—and people are the same as them. Thus, it is said: ‘the same in sameness.’”

Guan Jian’s commentary: “Endowed with form and below, one desires to return to...”

“Never having begun with things—is this not difficult? All things that exist are illusions. When the mind abides, they abide; when the mind perishes, they perish. If my mind does not sprout, in solitude and independence, it may be called ‘never having begun with things.’ If by chance one attains this, then even life and death are but lodgings.

The ancients who attained the Dao could do so. Next are those who, though things exist and life and death are distinct, can treat life as loss and death as return—thus differing from ordinary people adrift in the flow of life and death. Yet another level says there is no distinction between life and death, from head to tail, from beginning to end.

Though these three differ, they all emerge from the Dao, just as the royal clans of Chu, though one, have the three surnames of Zhao, Qu, and Jing. The soot that cakes at the bottom of a cauldron resembles form yet is not form, arising from form. Humans, lodging in form to have life, are like that soot. In an instant, it scatters—what was called ‘I’ shifts elsewhere, and one cannot definitively speak of its being or non-being. Thus, let us speak in analogy: in the sacrificial feast, tripe and hooves complete the body of the offering to present to the spirits—they cannot be separated. Once the rite ends and the sacrificial meat is divided, they can be. Observing the ancestral temple evokes reverence; entering the privy, one cannot but guard against carelessness. All these are instances of shifting rightness.

Let us place the five characters ‘this is the unknowable’ before the five preceding sentences. As seen in Guo’s commentary below, people’s self-rightness arises from having life, and life gives rise to knowledge, which becomes their guide. These two, life and knowledge, ride upon each other without cease. If one stubbornly clings to them as names and realities, taking them as one’s own substance, they cannot be changed. This means one cannot see through the illusory dust and mistake the empty for the real. Taking names and realities as one’s own measure and repaying them with death—all this stems from self-rightness, which leads to such harm. The world follows this habit without awakening to its error, no different from the cicada and owl content with the elm and sandalwood, unaware of the roc’s journey of ninety thousand miles.”

*Jian*:
When one treads on a market-goer’s foot, one excuses oneself as careless; with an elder brother, one acts as a doting mother; with one’s parents, one simply does as they wish. Thus it is said: “Ultimate ritual does not involve others; ultimate rightness does not objectify; ultimate wisdom does not scheme; ultimate benevolence has no favorites; ultimate trust dispels gold and unblocks the will.”

Agitation of the will comes from six things: wealth, honor, prestige, fame, profit. Distortion of the mind comes from six: demeanor, movement, expression, principle, qi, intent. Encumbrance of virtue comes from six: aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, delight. Obstruction of the Dao comes from six: departure, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, ability.

If these twenty-four are not swept from the breast, then:
No agitation—rectitude.
Rectitude—stillness.
Stillness—clarity.
Clarity—emptiness.
Emptiness—non-action, yet nothing is not done.

The Dao is the reverence of virtue; life is the radiance of virtue.”

The nature is the essence of life. The movement of nature is called action; its artificiality is called error. Knowledge is encounter; wisdom is strategy. What knowledge does not know is like a sidelong glance.

Movement from necessity is called virtue; movement without self-exclusion is called governance. Names may oppose each other, yet in reality they accord.

Guo’s Commentary:
If one treads on a stranger’s foot, one excuses oneself with carelessness; if it is an elder brother, one humbly apologizes without refusal; if it is a close relative, one does nothing—this is the plain sufficiency of understanding and forbearance. Not involving others means regarding others as oneself; regarding others as oneself means no mutual apologies—this is the ultimate of ritual. "Not objectifying" means each attains its proper place, so all things are oneself. To know only after scheming is not natural; thus, ultimate wisdom does not scheme. It is like the five viscera never having been intimate, yet benevolence already exists—thus, ultimate benevolence has no favorites. Gold and jade are but the substance of petty trust; great trust dispenses with them—thus, ultimate trust dispels gold.

This is called "ear" because it moves from nature itself, constituting true action, not contrived action. The eye’s ability to see is not knowing how to see but seeing; not knowing how to know but knowing—this is what is meant by natural. If one acts only after knowing, that knowing is artificial. To move only when compelled is to act with strength, thus to err. To act by imitating others is to invite chaos, for there are names of self and other. Yet if names are reversed to grasp reality, then they accord.

Lü’s Commentary:
If another draws a bow to shoot me, I speak of it with laughter, for they owe me no kindness; since I expect no kindness, treading on their foot requires no apology but carelessness. If a brother draws a bow to shoot me, I speak of it with tears, for they owe me kindness; since I expect kindness, even treading on their foot does not seem unloving—one merely humbles oneself without need for apology. For a close relative, kindness is utmost; no humility is needed.

From this we see: the ultimate of ritual, rightness, benevolence, and wisdom requires no external reliance. Understanding the intent of ritual yet not performing vulgar rituals to impress others—this is ritual that does not involve others. Acting appropriately without seeking appropriateness—this is rightness that does not objectify. Responding to events without prior scheming—this is wisdom that does not scheme. Treating the people as straw dogs yet enabling the world to be universally protective—this is benevolence without favorites. Trust is not expected to dispel gold—yet if one attains the Dao, these five are all perfected.

The will is where the mind goes; the mind is the harmony of virtue; virtue is the Dao within me. Thus, only by unblocking the will can the mind be liberated; only by removing encumbrances can obstructions be cleared. To cultivate the will, one values weakness—regarding wealth and honor as will is not weakness but rebellion. Thus, it must be unblocked. To cultivate the mind, one values emptiness—regarding movement and stillness as mind is not emptiness but distortion. Thus, it must be liberated. To perfect virtue, one must equalize the beginning—regarding desire and aversion as virtue’s encumbrance, they must be removed. To penetrate the Dao, one must unify—regarding departure and approach as the Dao’s obstruction, they must be cleared. If all these encumbrances are swept from the breast, the Dao gathers.

Without reverence, there is no Dao—thus, the Dao is the reverence of virtue. Without life, virtue cannot be seen—thus, life is the radiance of virtue. Nature is the essence of life; when nature moves and acts, artificiality arises and error occurs. Life without innate knowing is mere encounter; knowledge is not born with birth. To use knowledge only after scheming is strategy. What knowledge does not know is like the sidelong glance that does not see—yet that is precisely how it sees.

Thus, movement from necessity is nature’s action, not artificiality—this is called the Dao. Movement without self-exclusion means things and self are one; how can movement cause chaos? If one is truly thus, then though the world’s self and other, right and wrong may seem opposed in name, in reality they never fail to accord—because the Dao excludes nothing as "not-self."

The subtle and unrefined—can one make others praise them without self-promotion? The sage excels in being Heavenly yet appears clumsy among men. Can one excel in being Heavenly yet remain nimble among men? Only the complete person can do this; only the creaturely can be creaturely, only the Heavenly can be Heavenly. How can one despise Heaven? How can one despise the Heavenly in man—and how much more so the Heavenly in oneself?

A single sparrow encounters Yi—Yi must capture it, for that is his power. If one takes all under Heaven as one’s cage, then no sparrow can escape. Thus, Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin; Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to enclose Bai Li Xi. Therefore, if one does not use what they love to enclose them, there is nothing that can be obtained.

The hunchbacked painter, though extravagant beyond measure, does not seek praise. The convict laborer climbs high without fear, forgetting life and death. Now, repeated practice without shame and guarding against others—guarding against others thus becomes one’s Heaven.

Therefore, one who respects without delight and insults without anger is only in harmony with Heavenly harmony. When anger arises from non-anger, then anger issues from non-anger. When action arises from non-action, then action issues from non-action. To desire stillness, level the qi; to desire spirit, follow the heart—this is having intent. To desire appropriateness, abide in necessity; necessity’s constancy is the sage’s Dao.

*(Guo’s commentary: "Excelling in the mean is to excel in receiving praise—principle and constancy are both present. Following nature is Heavenly; acting with intent is human.")*

One skilled in Heaven is thus adept among humans—this is called the "complete person," and the complete person is the sage. If an insect can guard its insect-nature, this is to be skilled in Heaven. Not knowing yet entrusting to it—this is called mastery. Heaven’s majesty seizes things, yet things must flee from it. All things under Heaven have their preferences, and each preference allows escape—where then lies the constancy of adornment? Adornment serves to embellish appearance. The mutilated one’s visage is already marred and incomplete, so they no longer harbor concern for beauty or ugliness, casting aside embellishment and abandoning it. The convict laborer, having no reliance on life, thus fears not death. Again, it is said: "without shame and guarding against others"—this speaks of not recognizing what others cherish. Devoid of human sentiment, one naturally becomes a "Heavenly person." If even the mutilated convict laborer can still harmonize with Heavenly harmony, how much more so the natural harmony of Heaven itself?

Anger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action—thus, non-being cannot generate being, nor can being generate the intent to be. Leveling the qi brings stillness; following the heart brings spirit. Abiding in necessity makes all actions appropriate. Therefore, the sage takes this as the Dao—how could they seek non-action beyond the indistinct and obscure?

*(Lü’s commentary: "Within the classic are the Heavenly person, the spirit person, the perfected person, and the sage—here, there is also the 'complete person.'")*

The sage flees transformation—though skilled in Heaven, they remain clumsy in human affairs. The complete person, however, surpasses even this, for they are both skilled in Heaven and adept in human matters. Those creatures that crawl, breathe through beaks, gather in groups, or cluster in swarms—each performs its creaturely functions, yet knows not *why* it does so; this is the creaturely capacity. The Heavenly capacity, however, lies in not knowing *why* one is as one is. The complete person detests the Heaven of humans, for the Heaven of humans entails knowing what one does not know. As for the Heaven of Heaven—it guards against even this unknowing. If knowing *why* one is as one is still detestable, how much more so Heaven and humanity? How could one presume to deliberate over them?

When Yi aims at a sparrow, he is certain to hit it—such is the power of his skill. Those who do not fall within his aim are beyond the reach of that power. If one takes the world as a cage, then all things are trapped within it, with nowhere to escape—how much more so the sparrow? Only one who delves deeply, ever more deeply, and thereby penetrates the minds of all under Heaven can take the world as a cage. Thus, even figures like Yi Yin and Baili Xi could not escape it—they were caged by what they loved.

The maimed man, though scorned and slandered, may still cast aside fame and follow no set path; the convict laborer, though facing life and death, may still climb heights without fear. How much more so one who can guard against human influences—should they not be even more resolute and unyielding? Yet those who grow accustomed to such things through repeated exposure may still fail to guard against what others cannot. They take this as the Heavenly person, believing that the Heavenly person is merely one who guards against human influences. But this is to equate oneself with Heaven in a manner no different from the creatures. The complete person, the Heavenly person, and the sage share the same pattern, though their momentum differs.

Anger arises from non-anger as a constant; action arises from non-action as a constant. Non-anger and non-action are the states before things arise, the source from which all things emerge. Qi is emptiness awaiting things; humans cannot level it and instead agitate it, hence they are not still. If one can truly level the qi, there is nothing that will not become still. The heart, in humans, is spirit; humans cannot follow it and instead disturb it, hence they are not spirit. If one can truly follow the heart, there is nothing that will not become spirit. To act and desire appropriateness is to be constrained by necessity. Hesitation in initiating affairs, caution like crossing a river in winter—these are all expressions of acting from necessity.

*(Fangzi’s commentary: "The complete person detests Heaven—not Heaven itself, but the Heaven of humans. The Heaven of humans is constrained and harms life. Even the Heaven of humans is detestable, how much more so one’s own Heaven, or humanity? Is there anything that can overcome and yet remain unsettled? Only the creaturely capacity of Heaven—what is called the Heaven of Heaven. To guard against human influences is to share the same Heaven as creatures. The complete person and the Heavenly person share the same pattern as the sage, though their momentum stirs differently. Thus, the text concludes: ‘Acting from necessity—this is the Dao of the sage.’")*

*(General Observations: Guan Jian’s Summary)*
Master Gengsang’s grasp of the Laozi was concrete and thorough, yet what he had not yet attained still involved some attachment. Living secluded on Weilei, he was praised by the people for his virtue—this is the common way of sages and worthies in benefiting the world. Yet when the hearts of the multitude are moved and they wish to exalt him, the traces of love and benefit become manifest, and human feelings arise. Thus, what Nangong saw in him was no different from Weilei.

Fearing his virtue was insufficient to transform others, Gengsang sent him to see his teacher, hoping to shift his mindset and awaken him. This was a case of "passing the baton" to another, ensuring trust without doubt so that the profound teachings could take root. Upon entering the door, there was no gentle questioning or exchange—only a sudden shock, a wordless rebuke, a severing of all supports. This was the "letting go at the cliff’s edge," where the root of life hangs by a thread—how rare to encounter such a moment! Alas, Nangong could not immediately accept it and instead meandered, rambling on at length. Laozi diagnosed the source of his ailment and administered a sharp needle. Nangong then withdrew, dwelling in solitude, washing away his attachments, and returning for another audience—one could say he was good at receiving instruction and capable of renewal.

Thus, in their second encounter, Laozi seized the moment to point directly, sweeping away all his clinging obsessions. Gradually, he applied the medicine, urging him to reflect on his capacity to receive the Dao. Nangong, measuring his own vessel, wished only to hear the teachings on preserving life—seeing the Dao as a method to be expanded or contracted according to the person. Laozi taught him to embrace the One, seek within himself, return to infancy, and follow things—these are the general outlines of the teachings on preserving life.

The questioning reached its utmost, and the meaning returned to the child’s capacity: "Words have their source; affairs have their ruler." Next, the discussion of vast spaciousness arises from Heavenly illumination, the numinous terrace—one does not know what sustains it. The chamber is empty, and brightness arises naturally; there is no need to seek it eagerly with a mind of doing. The distinctions between outer and inner bonds, the metaphors of the sharp sword and the blunt blade—these enable the learner to discern weight and make clear choices.

There is no before or after in life and death; the ancestral temple and the privy each have their proper place. This is to awaken to the fundamental oneness of all life, shattering the delusion of fixed distinctions. The account of wealth, honor, desires, and aversions stirring the will and confounding the heart shows that the will must be unified and the heart emptied. Anything that entangles one in worldly burdens and obstructs clarity must be abandoned and kept far away. The sacrificial meats and organs may be scattered, for they are not eternal. Yi was skilled at hitting targets but clumsy in other matters—this is to store up fame.

All these are explanations to dissolve the common person’s attachments, to expand the transformation of emptiness and mystery, to merge Heaven and humanity, to transcend skill and clumsiness, to rise above things and self, right and wrong, praise and blame, respect and insult. Only then can one attain non-action and non-anger, stillness that levels the qi, and a heart that follows spirit. In this way, one becomes serene, dwelling alone with the numinous, stabilized in the One, and responding without limitation.

Xu Wuque was visited by Nü Shang, who then met with Duke Wu of Wei. The Duke greeted him, saying, "Master, you must be weary." He continued, "You have endured the hardships of mountain forests, and only now have you deigned to see me."

Xu Wuque replied, "I am weary because of you, my lord. What weariness have you endured on my account? If you indulge in desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the true nature of life and destiny will sicken. If you suppress desires and restrain likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I weary you, my lord—what weariness have you endured on my account?"

Duke Wu, startled, made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wuque said, "Let me tell you something: I read dogs. A low-quality dog stops when it is full—this is the virtue of a wildcat. A middling-quality dog gazes like the sun. A high-quality dog seems to have lost its singular focus. Yet my reading of dogs is not as refined as my reading of horses. When I read horses, a straight one aligns with the marking line, a curved one with the hook, a square one with the carpenter’s square, and a round one with the compass—these are state horses. But they do not compare to the horses of the world. The horses of the world possess perfect form, as if guarding something, as if losing something, as if they have lost their singular focus. Such horses surpass all, leaving dust behind, their destination unknown."

Duke Wu was greatly pleased and laughed. When Xu Wuque departed, Nü Shang asked him, "Master, how did you alone manage to delight my lord? When I try to persuade him, I cite the *Book of Poetry*, the *Book of Documents*, ritual, and music. When I follow his inclinations, I present him with the *Golden Tablets* and the *Six Bow-Cases*. Those who serve him with great merit are too numerous to count, yet my lord has never once opened his mouth in response. How did you delight him so?"

Xu Wuque said, "I simply told him how I read dogs and horses."

Nü Shang said, "Is that all?"

Xu Wuque replied, "Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? When they leave their state for a few days, they rejoice upon seeing those they know. After a month away, they rejoice upon seeing those they once saw in their homeland. After a year, they rejoice even upon seeing those who merely resemble people. Is it not true that the longer one is away from others, the deeper one’s longing for them grows? Those who flee into the emptiness of the wilds, where only brambles and thorns stand, where the paths are trodden only by weasels and badgers—even they, upon hearing the sound of human footsteps, rejoice at the echo. How much more so, then, for the voices of brothers and kin at one’s side?"

How long has it been since the true person’s words echoed at our lord’s side?

Guo’s commentary:
Desires and aversions, both inner and outer, have no cause—thus we call it affliction. To not respond is to not delight in his words. Yet what fault lies in the true person’s speech? It is only what things naturally favor that may be so. To expound at length without our lord ever parting his lips is like a lark rejoicing in bells and drums—hence the sorrow. To hear of reading dogs and horses and rejoice is like exiles seeing those they know: each longs for what accords with their fundamental nature. To attain what one favors is to be without longing; to be without longing is to forget the cause of one’s joy. The true person’s words thus accord with our lord’s nature. At first, he rejoices in attaining them; with time, he forgets them.

Lü’s commentary:
Xu Wuque resisted the might of Marquis Wu and admonished his affliction. The marquis, unwilling to yield, remained aloof and unresponsive. Xu Wuque thus employed the metaphor of reading dogs and horses to convey his own lack of seeking. Dogs of low quality act only when sated—like men who serve when hungry and seek when in need. Those of middling quality, like one gazing at the sun, see what is lofty and distant but cannot yet forget themselves; if even one aspect is forgotten, the rest may be inferred. Horses that meet the compass and square are state steeds—how much more so for the wandering of state scholars? Those within the realm belong to the world.

Those of superior quality attain completion without practice, naturally so—if preserved, none can share their joy; if lost, none can match them. To lose even one aspect is to lose one’s very self, not merely to lose it but to transcend all bounds, leaving dust far behind, unknown in their essence. How much more so for the scholars of the world who wander beyond the realm, unknowable in their nature?

This implies: if even the finest dogs and the world’s finest horses are thus, how could I presume to humble myself before your power? How could you fail to esteem me?

Marquis Wu grasped his meaning and rejoiced greatly. For words that meet the Dao are truly received. Words that do not accord with the Dao, though they be the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, rites, or music, cannot move one. But words that accord with the Dao, though they speak of dogs and horses, suffice to bring joy.

When one loses the true nature of life and indulges in human artifice, it is like abandoning one’s homeland and kin to wander in distant lands, or fleeing into the void to dwell among foxes and weasels. What is called the "real" is the inherent nature one originally possesses, like the old bonds of homeland and kin. Unless one is utterly deluded, who could hear the coughs and whispers of a true person and not rejoice?

---

Wu Chou’s commentary:
Xu Wuque was a spirit-like person. He seized the moment and rode the tide without allowing his heart to intervene. Thus, his words subtly conveyed his intent. He followed the return of the Dao without opposing its principles, aligning with the other’s preferences without offending their sensibilities. Even the fierce and violent Marquis Wu was thus pleased and enlightened by his Dao-infused metaphors.

---

New Tradition’s commentary:
Marquis Wu’s nature was of middling quality. One could not abruptly instruct him in the ultimate Dao but had to guide him through what he already favored. This is why Xu Wuque spoke of dogs and horses. Yet Xu Wuque was not truly evaluating dogs and horses; he embedded the meaning of the Dao within them. The finest dogs, if one aspect is lost, seem as though they have lost everything—this describes one whose form is whole and whose spirit is sovereign, able to preserve their person. The world’s finest horses are those of completed talent—this describes one whose virtue is vast and settled, never losing their root. To preserve one’s person is to act without contrivance; to never lose one’s root is to be without use. Without contrivance and without use, one can enter into the profound.

---

Guan Jian’s observation:
The phrase "the world’s horses of completed talent" evokes an image of transcendent, dust-leaving excellence. Gazing at the sun and preserving even one aspect can be described, but the state of "losing one aspect" is harder to depict—unlike state steeds, which can be measured by compass and square. "One" refers to the first stirring of things, as if lost or vanished, lingering between presence and absence, its form and substance impossible to pin down. Only by guiding with the Dao can one win Marquis Wu’s heart, achieving an effect swifter than the *Book of Songs* or the arts of concealment.

---

Fang Sishan’s note:
Excessive desire harms the spirit; complete abstinence also impedes it. Only the perfected person can act within desire without being swept away—this is the true way to nurture the spirit. To act within desire without being swept away is the province of those who transcend life. The phrases "as if losing one aspect" and "as if losing one" are metaphors for transcending life. Lü’s interpretation, which takes them as metaphors for ministers preserving their position, is too shallow.

Xu Wuque met with Marquis Wu. The marquis said, "Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating acorns and water-chestnuts, spurning scallions and leeks, yet you have long honored me with your presence. Are you now old? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or has my state been blessed with good fortune?"

Xu Wuque replied, "Wuque was born in poverty and lowliness and has never dared to partake of your lordship’s wine and meat. I have come to trouble you."

The marquis asked, "How so? How do I trouble you?"

Xu Wuque said, "I trouble your spirit and your form."

The marquis asked, "What do you mean?"

Xu Wuque said, "The nurturing of heaven and earth is impartial—ascending high does not make one long, nor does dwelling low make one short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, oppress the people of an entire state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. The spirit does not authorize this itself. The spirit loves harmony and hates discord, for discord is sickness. Thus, I trouble you. What sickness do you suffer?"

The marquis said, "I have long wished to see you, Master. I desire to love the people and practice righteousness, to lay down arms—is this possible?"

Xu Wuque said, "No. To love the people is the beginning of harming them; to practice righteousness and lay down arms is the root of raising arms. If you proceed thus, you will fail and not succeed. All completion of beauty is an instrument of ugliness. Though you practice benevolence and righteousness, you will verge on falsity. Form inevitably creates form; completion inevitably invites change; change inevitably leads to external conflict. You must not parade cranes in formation between the watchtowers, nor gallop steeds in the palace courtyards, nor harbor rebellion in your gains. Do not seek to overcome others with skill, do not seek to overcome others with schemes, do not seek to overcome others with war.

Those who kill others, who seize others’ land to nourish their own selfishness and their own spirit—whose victory is good, whose defeat is bad? It lies with you. If you cannot stop, cultivate sincerity within your breast to respond to the feelings of heaven and earth, and do not disturb the people. Then death will have already departed, and you will no longer need to ask how to lay down arms."

---

Guo’s commentary:
Heaven and earth nurture all equally; they do not grant one the status of lord to indulge without limit. To oppress the people to nourish one’s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth is to violate the balance of heaven and earth. The spirit does not authorize itself; it shares with things. To share with things is harmony; to authorize oneself is discord.

The traces of loving the people are what the people esteem; esteeming is loving, and loving oneself is false. To practice righteousness is to make one’s name manifest; when names are manifest, competition arises, and competition leads to the loss of one’s true nature. How can one hope to lay down arms when father and son, ruler and minister, harbor feelings and deceive one another? Only by following non-action can one succeed.

Beauty completed in the present gives rise to falsity in the future; thus, the completion of beauty is an instrument of ugliness. When the lord practices benevolence and righteousness, the people will respond with falsity and not take it as real. Benevolence and righteousness have form, so false forms inevitably arise. Completion invites display, so there will be rebellion and change—this refers to losing one’s constant nature.

Cranes in formation are military arrays; watchtowers are high towers. Infantry are called "common"; one should not practice righteousness or love the people in this way. Nor should one parade troops or gallop horses. To gain and harbor rebellion is to lose the mean. Do not seek to overcome others with skill—guard your simplicity, and each will have its own ability, thus achieving balance. Do not seek to overcome others with schemes—follow true knowledge, and each will have its own strength, thus achieving equality. Do not seek to overcome others with war—respond to things with the Dao, and things will submit without the name of victory.

If one does not know what is good, even victory is not one’s own. If one cannot stop, it is better to cultivate one’s own sincerity so that armor and weapons have no place to be arrayed and are not laid down.

】 Lü’s Annotation【
To govern the state with knowledge is the state’s bane; to govern the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing. Thus, loving the people is but the beginning of harming them, and laying down arms is but the root of raising them—all because one relies on knowledge rather than the Dao.

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness is already present; thus, the completion of beauty is but the vessel of ugliness. Once a vessel is formed, it has already departed from the Dao. Though there be the benevolence of loving the people and the righteousness of laying down arms, these are but artifices. The form of loving the people inherently contains the beginning of harm; the form of laying down arms inherently contains the root of war. Only when there is no form can there be nothing to create.

When cranes array themselves upon lofty towers, they are admired for their spectacle; when infantry and cavalry parade upon altars, they are toyed with and displayed—yet none of this is done out of necessity. Whenever one gains something contrary to the principle of heaven, rebellion is concealed within. To overcome others with skill is to rely on knowledge rather than the Dao; to overcome others with war is to rely on military strength rather than virtue. To kill men and seize lands to nourish one’s own selfishness and the selfishness of one’s spirit—those who praise such acts call it "good warfare" and "victory over others," yet who knows what is truly good and what is evil?

If a ruler must act, let it be out of necessity: cultivate sincerity to respond to the sentiment of heaven and earth, and all things will answer. Why then fear the death of the people or their escape?

】 Oral Exegesis【
"宾" is interchangeable with "摈" (to cast aside). "养生" means to nourish life. Heaven and earth give birth to things without distinction of high or low, noble or base. "和" means to be of the same kind; "奸" refers to selfishness. My spirit is originally one with the myriad things, yet desires and selfishness obscure this unity—this is what is detested. If a ruler is afflicted by this and remains unaware, I labor to admonish him.

To love the people with intent is to harm them; to lay down arms with intent is to raise them. To act with a mind of contrivance is to create forms; to fix upon forms is to solidify them. When the mind clings rigidly and does not transform, it injures the inner self, and external things disrupt and confuse it—this is called "external warfare." "鹤列" is the name of a battle formation; "丽谯" is the name of a tower; "锱坛" is a place of sacrifice. This means that if the human heart contends with things, even within a single chamber, it is as if troops and cavalry are arrayed before one, and all becomes a realm of strife.

Human nature deems gain as compliance and loss as rebellion; without gain, there is no loss—thus it is said, "Do not conceal rebellion within gain." "巧" refers to cunning, the machinations of the mind; intelligence and schemes arise from this cunning, and war arises from these schemes. To seek victory through such means is to gratify the selfishness of the eyes and ears. Though one may appear victorious, the mind is besieged by external things, and the spirit is wearied by the pursuit of victory alone.

Thus it is said: Where lies the evil of victory? Simply cultivate one’s inherent sincerity to respond to the natural reality of Heaven and Earth, and with nothing that opposes things, one will triumph without contention—then the people, though dead, are already freed. What need is there to seek the cessation of arms?

The Yellow Emperor was about to visit the Great Hidden One at Mount Juzi. Fangming drove the chariot, Changfang rode as the right attendant, and Zhang Ruo, Xi Peng, Kun Hun, and Huaji followed as the rear guard. When they reached the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all became lost, with no one to ask for the way. They happened upon a boy herding horses and inquired of him, saying, “Do you know Mount Juzi?”
“Yes,” he replied.
“Do you know where the Great Hidden One resides?”
“Yes,” he said.
The Yellow Emperor said, “How extraordinary! This boy not only knows Mount Juzi but also knows where the Great Hidden One resides. Let me ask you about governing the world.”
The boy said, “Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do? When I was young, I wandered freely within the Six Directions. Then I fell ill with confusion, and an elder taught me, saying, ‘If you ride the chariot of the sun and wander in the wilds of Xiangcheng, now that my illness has slightly improved, I will once again wander beyond the Six Directions.’ Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do?”
The Yellow Emperor said, “Governing the world is indeed not your concern, yet allow me to ask about it.” The boy declined, but the Yellow Emperor asked again, “How is governing the world different from this?”
The horse-herding boy replied, “It is no different from herding horses—simply remove those that harm the horses, and that is all.”
The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, called him “Heavenly Master,” and withdrew.

The scholars of knowledge take no delight without the changes of thought and contemplation; the disputatious scholars take no delight without the order of discourse; the scrutinizing scholars take no delight without the affairs of reproach and inquiry—all are confined by things. The world-summoning scholars rise in the court; the people-centered scholars glory in office; the sinew-and-strength scholars boast of hardship; the brave and daring scholars stir at peril; the martial scholars delight in war; the withered and emaciated scholars lodge in fame; the legal scholars expand governance; the ritual scholars revere demeanor; the benevolent and righteous scholars value connections; farmers, without the affairs of tilling and weeding, do not unite; merchants, without the affairs of markets and streets, do not unite; the common people, with their day-and-night labors, encourage the hundred crafts; artisans, with their skill in tools and machines, strengthen wealth; if money does not accumulate, the greedy worry; if power and influence do not excel, the boastful grieve. These followers of things delight in change, and when the times afford them use, they cannot be without action.

All these conform to the seasons yet do not accord with the transformations of things. They drive their natures and dispositions into the ten thousand things, never to return for their entire lives—how lamentable!

Those who cannot find contentment within and delight in things without are each confined by what they enjoy, so that the ten thousand things come of themselves without being summoned. From those who rise in the court to those who glory in office, the differences among scholars are like this, and those who encounter them cannot alter their ways. When their abilities align, their affairs align, and so they unite. When their work attains its purpose, they are encouraged. If their skill is not their own, then the nature of things finds what it desires and delights in. Power and influence arise from the changes of affairs. All these scholars are used according to their times, and when the times employ them, they cannot restrain themselves. If they do not encounter the times, though they wish to employ themselves, how could they succeed? Thus, nobility and baseness are not constant, and the abilities of scholars each have their limits, like the four seasons, which cannot be altered. When the times accord with their proper order, each has its use.

Therefore, those who conform to the seasons follow the sequence of time, but those who alter their natures do not accord with things. To accord with things without being things—what is this if not destruction? Not abiding in the abilities of a single household but instead pursuing the ten thousand directions to seek the profit of the times—thus there are those who crawl back in exhaustion, which is the cause for lament.

People all have a place of utmost joy; to attain it and wander therein is to be confined in a vastness indeed. Yet these scholars alone delight in the biases of their natures, thus confined by things and unable to confine things. From the world-summoning scholars to the followers of power and influence, though their inclinations differ, when the times afford them use, they cannot be without action—this is one in not knowing where the true ruler resides.

To act when the times afford use is not of one’s nature and destiny. The times have past and present, just as the years have cold and heat. Now, having encountered one occasion, they cling to it without release, unable to be without action. All these conform to the cold of the year yet do not know of the heat; they know the heat yet do not know of the cold, taking what they encounter as constant and not according with the transformations of things. People all have a true ruler within, yet they drive their natures and dispositions to chase things without knowing to return—this is what the utmost person laments.

**Translation:**

The *Comprehensive Meaning* states:
Those confined by things are two kinds—those who stand apart from affairs and employ cunning, and those who conform to the times are fifteen kinds—those who engage in affairs and expend effort. Those who "do not treat things as transformable" are those who cannot adapt to the changes of things. If things can transform, then form, though material, may yet attain spirit-like efficacy. The various arts and conditions previously described are all like things with fixed directions, incapable of transformation.

Zhuangzi said: "An archer who hits the mark without aiming beforehand is called a master archer—should all under heaven then be Yi?"
Hui Zi said: "They should."
Zhuangzi said: "If there is no shared standard under heaven, and each takes their own standard as right, should all under heaven then be Yao?"
Hui Zi said: "They should."
Zhuangzi said: "Then if the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bing, along with you, make five—who is correct? Or perhaps someone like Lu Ju is right?"
His disciple said: "I have attained the Master’s Dao! I can boil a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer!"
Lu Ju said: "This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Dao. Shall I show you my Way?" My Dao lies herein.

Placing one zither in the hall and another in the chamber, when the gong note is struck, the gong note resonates; when the jue note is struck, the jue note resonates—their tonal laws are the same. Yet if one alters a single string’s tuning so that it no longer corresponds to the five notes, and then strikes it, all twenty-five strings will vibrate, though their sounds are not inherently different. Is this then the ruler of tones?

Hui Zi said: "Now the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bing all engage me in debate, clashing with words, overpowering with phrases, and contending with voices—yet they have never begun by admitting their own errors. What is to be done?"

Zhuangzi said: "A man of Qi who was sent to execute someone in Song—though his mission was to guard the gate, he did not fulfill his request for a tripod; though his duty was to bind the criminal, he fulfilled his request for a bell. Yet he never left his domain, and nothing was left undone. A man of Chu who was sent as a gatekeeper and lodged elsewhere, in the dead of night when no one was present, fought with a boatman. Though he never encountered peril, he still incurred resentment.

[Guo’s commentary: Hitting the mark without prior aim is not true mastery. If one calls accidental hits mastery, then all under heaven could be called Yi. This cannot be. If one who hits by chance is Yi, then those who insist on their own rightness could likewise be called Yao. Zhuangzi uses this to show that those who hit the mark by mistake are not Yi, and those who insist on their own rightness are not Yao. If all were Yao, why would the five schools still contradict one another? It is like Lu Ju boasting to his disciple about striking the zither: both merely summon yang with yang, yet he claims this as his own achievement. If one alters a single string’s tuning, the five notes change accordingly—without sound, there is no resonance; with sound, they are not in harmony. Now, if this one string is altered and all twenty-five strings change, it is merely adjusting the tension to retune them. Lu Ju takes this as proof of his skill, yet it is nothing more than mutual resonance—he has not uniquely mastered the art.]"

The five masters each cling to their own views and affirm what they affirm—no different from Lu Ju boasting to his disciple without surpassing one another. Those who have never deemed themselves wrong each insist on their own rightness. Huizi then sought to take this as the ultimate truth, so Zhuangzi cited the case of the Qi man who abandoned his son in a foreign land, instructing the gatekeeper to guard him yet failing to preserve his life—such was the Qi man’s lack of compassion. Yet he, too, deemed himself right. Thus, he valued his bronze vessel, binding it with straw to prevent damage or loss, yet lost his son without searching far, neglecting the qi he had bestowed—yet he never once deemed himself wrong. Zhuangzi further invoked the Chu man who entrusted his son to a gatekeeper: both entrusted their sons, yet neither cast himself onto high ground or a steep bank. In the dead of night, he alone boarded another’s boat; before leaving the shore, he was already fighting with others. The conduct of these two men from Qi and Chu was no different, yet they never once deemed themselves wrong. Now, if the five masters insist on their own rightness, how are they any different?

**Lü’s Commentary:**
That all under heaven could be Yi is surely impossible. Huizi, recognizing that Zhuangzi’s words were directed at him, took them as admissible: to hit the mark is to be Yi, and to insist on one’s own rightness is to be Yao—no need for prior intent or impartial affirmation. This is what is meant by taking opposition to others as truth and victory over others as renown. Nevertheless, if the five masters are not all right, then the claim that all are Yao cannot stand. Otherwise, it is like Lu Ju tuning his zither—inevitably summoning resonance through sound alone—yet he deems himself superior to the other four masters, though in reality, he differs not at all. He may say, “I am no different from the four masters, yet if you grant me debate, I have never once deemed myself wrong—how does this compare?” Such words aim to establish the claim that all are Yao. Zhuangzi, through subtle speech, sought to move him: the bond between father and son is a matter of heavenly nature. Yet the Qi man abandoned his son in Song, entrusting him to a gatekeeper not to preserve his life but to illustrate how Hui Shi slighted the natural affection for life while prizing his bronze vessel, binding it with straw. In seeking his lost son, he never ventured beyond his domain—likening Hui Shi’s attachment to verbal debate and reputation as external things, cherishing them while enduring harm to what he received from heaven, losing it without seeking to recover, deeming it regrettable. The Chu man who entrusted his son to a gatekeeper is a metaphor for Hui Shi losing the true dwelling of his return, contending with others amid the obscurity of right and wrong, striving for victory without achieving anything—merely failing to adapt to things, which is not what is called wisdom.

**Following the Text:**
An archer must aim at the target beforehand and hit it to be called a skilled archer. Now, if one does not aim beforehand but merely hits the mark by chance and is thus called a skilled archer, then all under heaven would be Yi—is this admissible? This illustrates that without impartial affirmation, each affirms their own rightness, claiming all under heaven are Yao.

Is this admissible? Yang Zhu and Gongsun Long—during winter’s cold, they could kindle fire without flame; in summer’s heat, they could freeze water into ice. Though these feats seem marvelous, they merely rely on the yang’s resurgence at the winter solstice to summon yang and produce fire, or the yin’s resurgence at the summer solstice to summon yin and produce ice. Nothing extraordinary.

Place one zither in the hall and another in the chamber: strike the *gong* note on this zither, and the *gong* note on that zither resonates of its own accord; strike the *jiao* note on this one, and the *jiao* note on that one responds likewise. This may seem marvelous, yet because their tuning is identical, their sounds naturally harmonize—nothing extraordinary.

Take the case of Cao Shao-kui of the Tang, who understood musical temperament. In Luoyang, a monk’s chamber housed a chime stone that tolled day and night on its own. The monk, unsettled by the strangeness, fell ill. Shao-kui, who had long been on good terms with the monk, came to inquire after his illness. The monk told him what had happened. Just then, the temple bell was struck, and the chime stone sounded again in response. Shao-kui laughed and said, “Tomorrow, prepare a feast, and I will rid you of this.” The monk did as he said. After the meal, Shao-kui took a file from his sleeve, struck the chime stone several times, and left. The sound ceased. When the monk pressed him for an explanation, he said, “This chime stone shares the same temperament as the bell, so when one is struck, the other responds.” The monk rejoiced, and his illness was cured.

Another case: Li Sizhen obtained a carriage bell, and when he struck it, something beneath the earth responded. He dug and unearthed a bell—surely there was a resonance at work.

The *Record of Learning* states: “Striking a drum has no direct correspondence to the five notes, yet if one alters a single string’s tuning without aligning it to any of the five notes and strikes it, all twenty-five strings vibrate in response. Though this string is no different from the others, it alone can command them, for it serves as the master of the assembled scholars. Thus, when struck, none of the strings fail to obey its command.”

The sixty-four modes all arise from the *gong* note of *Huangzhong*, and *gong* is the sovereign, so it can govern the other temperaments. This, too, is common principle—nothing extraordinary.

If this is so, then Hui Shi’s self-affirmation is like the case of Lu Ju. Hui Shi replied: “Zhuangzi claims that I, along with the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Gongsun Long, make five schools, yet he cannot determine which is right. But since the arguments of the other four cannot refute me, I am right and they are wrong.”

*Ti* (蹢) means to hesitate, to walk without advancing. The *Record of Rites* says: “He hesitates, lingering.” *Chichu* (踟蹰) has the same meaning.

The *xing* bell and the *xing* tripod are akin to bells; the *Tang* hall and its paths are the thoroughfares of the courtyard. As the *Book of Songs* says: “Within the central hall-path, there are tiles.” The *Tang* servant refers to those who attend to the hall’s paths—messengers and orderlies—just as the *Rites of Zhou* speaks of “gatekeepers,” now commonly called “porters.”

There was a man of Qi who hesitated to entrust his son to Song, instead making him a gatekeeper there, casting him off to a foreign land because his form was imperfect. Yet though his form was imperfect, he was still his own flesh and blood—how could he bear to abandon him? Let us examine his motives: when seeking a *xing* bell, he bound and secured it, fearing even the slightest damage. How does this compare to discarding his own son? When seeking a *Tang* servant, he merely employed him to attend the hall’s paths and run errands, never sending him beyond the borders. How does this compare to abandoning his son in a foreign land? In this way, his principles of examination were flawed.

People are often blinded by distinctions of kinship and estrangement, nobility and baseness, nearness and distance, unaware of their own biases. This is like Hui Shi, who recognized the errors in the arguments of the four schools yet failed to see his own.

*Li* (離) and *li* (罹) both mean “to arrive.” *Cen* (岑) refers to a steep riverbank. A man of Chu, lodging on a boat and hesitating to become a gatekeeper in another land, quarreled with the boatman in the dead of night when no one was present. He did not consider that before reaching shore, it was unwise to provoke conflict—such actions only breed resentment. This is a further step: in disputes with others, one not only risks self-delusion but also invites disaster.

Zhuangzi, passing by Hui Shi’s grave while attending a funeral, turned to his followers and said: “There was a man of Ying who had a speck of plaster on the tip of his nose, as thin as a fly’s wing. He called upon Carpenter Shi to shave it off. Carpenter Shi swung his axe with such force that it created a gust of wind, and with perfect precision, he sliced away the plaster without harming the man’s nose. The man of Ying stood firm, his expression unchanged. When the Lord of Song Yuan heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said, ‘Try to do it for me.’ Carpenter Shi replied, ‘Your servant once could wield the axe in such a way. However, my partner has been dead for a long time. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no one to work with—I have no one to converse with.’”

Guo Xiang’s commentary: “To swing the axe with such force that it creates a gust of wind is to act with eyes closed and hands unrestrained. Yet without the unshakable composure of the partner, even the most skillful words and finest craftsmanship would be of no use.”

Lü Huiqing’s commentary: “It is precisely because of this that Zhuangzi repeatedly engaged with Hui Shi, deeply lamenting that he never reached such heights.”

When Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, “Uncle, your illness has grown severe. Dare I ask—if it should become critical, to whom should I entrust the state?” Guan Zhong replied, “Whom does the Duke wish to appoint?” The Duke said, “Bao Shuya.” Guan Zhong said, “He will not do. His conduct is pure and upright, a fine gentleman. But when he encounters those who do not measure up to him, he does not associate with them. Moreover, once he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it for the rest of his life. If you place him in charge of the state, he will above seek to control his lord and below oppose the people. It will not be long before he incurs the ruler’s displeasure.” The Duke said, “Then who is suitable?” Guan Zhong replied, “If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that he forgets those above him and does not alienate those below. He feels ashamed that he does not equal the Yellow Emperor, and he pities those who cannot keep up with him. To divide virtue among others is called sageliness; to divide wealth among others is called worthiness. To rule others with worthiness has never won their allegiance, but to humble oneself with worthiness has never failed to win their hearts. In governing the state, he remains unheard of; in managing his household, he remains unseen.”

If one must proceed, then Xi Peng is suitable—could this not be called a definitive judgment? "To hook" is to oppose; "to alienate" is to rebel. The *Liezi* renders this as "not defying those above and not betraying those below." Guo’s commentary states: "To forget those above and not alienate those below means to be lofty yet not overbearing. To pity those who cannot keep up with him is to leave none behind. If all affairs were heard and seen, they would converge upon oneself, leaving subordinates with no room to act—thus, to relinquish them is fitting. Yet since he cannot relinquish all, he is merely suitable."

Lü’s commentary states: "Capacity becomes impartiality; impartiality becomes kingship; kingship becomes Heaven; Heaven becomes the Dao. These five are all that one embodies. Impartiality thus enables one to act as a lord; kingship, as a king. The titles of lord and king arise from this. Could Xi Peng’s virtue be said to embody capacity that becomes impartiality?"

Jiang Yu states: "One who guards against those above governs with opacity; one who does not alienate those below nurtures a people of simplicity. To feel ashamed of not equaling the Yellow Emperor is to avoid self-satisfaction; to pity those who cannot keep up is to take saving goodness as one’s heart. To divide virtue among others so that all people may return to their mandate and restore constancy is the Dao of the sage. To divide wealth among others so that all people lack nothing in supporting their superiors and raising their dependents is the power of the worthy. To rule others with worthiness is like a mountain’s barren slopes; to humble oneself with worthiness is like a marsh’s fertile growth. As for 'in governing the state, he remains unheard of; in managing his household, he remains unseen,' this does not mean he truly does not see or hear—his Dao suffices to contain all. Herein lies why Xi Peng is suitable and Bao Shuya is not. In the *Preface to the 'Kudzu Sandals'* of the *Book of Songs*, it speaks of the parsimony and pettiness of the lord of Wei, while the poem itself says, 'It is only this petty heart'—thus critiquing how such pettiness harms governance."

King Wu of Wu was floating on the river when he ascended Mount Ju. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, scattered in alarm and fled into the dense thickets. One monkey, however, remained.

The monkey crouched and clambered, displaying its skill before the king. The king shot at it with swift precision, his arrows flying in rapid succession. The king ordered his attendants to hasten and shoot as well, but the monkey seized the arrows mid-flight. The king commanded his ministers to close in and shoot together, and the monkey was captured and killed. The king turned to his friend Yan Buyi and said, "This monkey flaunted its skill, relied on its agility, and scorned me—thus it met its end. Take heed! Alas, do not let your demeanor grow arrogant toward others!"

Yan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to uproot his prideful bearing. He renounced pleasure and declined honors. After three years, the people of the state praised him.

Nanbo Ziqi sat leaning against a table, gazing upward and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said, "Master, you surpass all things—can your form truly be made like withered bones, your heart like dead ashes?"

He replied, "Once I dwelled in a mountain cave..."

When Tian He caught sight of me, the multitudes of Qi celebrated thrice—yet I had already preceded him. Thus he knew me, and thus he sold me. Had I not possessed it, how could he have known? Had I not sold it, how could he have trafficked it? Alas! I grieve for those who lose themselves, and I grieve yet more for those who grieve for them, and I grieve still further for those who grieve over the grief of others. Thereafter, the distance grows ever greater with each day.

Guo's Annotation: The people of Qi celebrated thrice upon seeing Ziqi, taking it as an honor. Ziqi knew that such actions could not save others but only harm oneself, so he chose not to grieve. In this way, his sorrow gradually faded, his heart became still, and his form withered—thus the distance grew day by day.

Lü's Annotation: When Tian He glimpsed me, the state of Qi rejoiced thrice, for I had already preceded him in selling it, and thus he knew and trafficked it. The heart not yet emptied within leaves traces without, so others come to know it. The Dao of Heaven has never begun with things. If a rigid knowing remains stored in the heart, this is self-loss—loss meaning the forfeiture of one’s original heart. Ziqi grieved for those who lost themselves in this way, wishing them to return. Yet to know their loss and grieve for it is still loss, not return. I grieve further for those who grieve for others’ grief, for both the lost and those who grieve for them remain unaware of their state. This is why the distance grows daily. If one is not ensnared by things, how could the form not wither, the heart not turn to ashes?

When Confucius traveled to Chu, the people of Chu offered him wine. Sunshu Ao held the goblet and stood, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and made a libation, saying, "People of ancient times—" Then he spoke to me, saying, "Qiu!"

Hearing the wordless words—have you never spoken of this? When Yiliao of Shinan juggled his pellets, the feuds of two clans dissolved; when Sunshu Ao slept soundly, holding his feather fan, the men of Ying sheathed their blades. I would wish for a beak three feet long—what they call the Way that is not the Way, this is what I call the eloquence of silence. Thus virtue gathers where the Dao unifies, and speech rests where knowledge reaches its limit. That which the Dao unifies, virtue cannot equal; what knowledge cannot know, debate cannot exhaust.

Names like "Confucian" or "Mohist" bring only misfortune. Thus the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—it is the utmost of greatness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know his name. Therefore, in life he bears no rank, in death no posthumous title; no wealth accumulates, no fame is established—this is called the Great Person. A dog is not good because it barks well; a person is not worthy because they speak well—how much less so for greatness? To be great is not enough to be called great—how much less so for virtue? Greatness is complete—none surpasses heaven and earth. What is there to seek? And yet greatness is complete.

One who knows completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, does not alter the self for things. Returning to the self without exhaustion, following antiquity without friction—this is the sincerity of the Great Person. Guo’s commentary: "The ancients who spoke did so only to guard against uniformity. The sage does not speak; what he speaks are the words of the common people. Thus it is said: the wordless words. If one takes speech as non-speech, then though words issue from the mouth, they have never truly been spoken here—speech amid silence. Yiliao and Sunshu Ao settled disputes through quietude, remaining unperturbed, and conflicts dissolved of themselves. If what is spoken is not one’s own, then though one speaks all their life, it is as if they have never spoken. Thus a beak three feet long is hardly worth praising. The common person’s silence is not yet wordlessness—what he refers to as the two masters, this refers to Confucius.

What the Dao contains, though boundless, gathers in its great return to self-possession—thus it is one. Speech halts at its proper limit—what could be more ultimate? Each attains self-possession, not through sameness, yet the Dao remains one."

The knowing of what lies beyond one’s proper share—thus even eloquence cannot encompass it. The Ru and Mohists sought to unify what cannot be unified, to encompass what cannot be encompassed—hence their calamity. The sea receives all things without refusal, and so becomes vast; thus the sage, drifting and all-embracing, lets things take their course. In life, there is no rank to possess, yet none is lacking; in death, there is no posthumous title, for such titles name merit, and merit does not reside in oneself—though titled, it is not one’s own. The real does not accumulate, so the myriad things each know contentment. The name is not established, for merit is not one’s own doing—thus the name returns to things. This is called the Great Person. If one were to act and possess, one would be small indeed.

Excellence arises from nature, not from speech—how much less can the great be attained through effort? Only through spontaneity is it attained. Heaven and earth are greatly complete, yet not through seeking. One who knows their own completeness does not abandon the self to seek things—thus there is no seeking, no loss, no rejection. Returning to guard one’s own principle, one’s principle naturally flows unimpeded; following one’s constant nature, it arrives of itself—no polishing is needed. Without acting, one attains of itself—hence it is called *sincerity*.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Three persons not existing at the same time are here presented as a parable—what is called "wordless words" is not the absence of a beak. If one were truly like those two masters, then even with a beak three feet long, it would still be as if one had not spoken. Their conduct is called the *Dao of the non-Dao*; Confucius’ silence is called the *eloquence of wordlessness*. How could the world understand this? What virtue cannot unify, what eloquence cannot encompass, is fundamentally nameless. To halt at the nameless is where auspiciousness resides; otherwise, even if one’s name resembles that of the Ru or Mohists, one cannot avoid reckless action and calamity.

The Dao in the world is like the hundred rivers to the sea—receiving without refusal. The sage, likewise all-embracing, nourishes things without knowing whose they are. Without rank, without posthumous title—this is why the sage’s namelessness is great. If even excellence in speech cannot be considered worthy, how much less can greatness reside in words? Thus what knowing cannot know, what eloquence cannot encompass, gives rise to the *eloquence of wordlessness*. The sage does not act as great, for that would be insufficient to be great—how much less can one act to possess virtue? The Dao is one, yet virtue cannot unify it—hence there is the *Dao of the non-Dao*.

That by which heaven and earth are greatly complete is fundamentally without seeking, yet complete. People, too, have what may be called great completeness—it is nothing but *sincerity*. With sincerity, there is no seeking; without seeking, there is no loss, no rejection, for one is sufficient in oneself and does not exchange it for things. The Great Person knows that in oneself, the myriad things are not lacking—thus turning back, one is inexhaustible, enduring from high antiquity without decay. Hence, following it, one does not polish. *Sincerity* is that which, without striving, hits the mark; without thinking, attains; without acting, accomplishes.

**Xun’s Annotation:**
The ancients, in speaking thus, praised Confucius—not comparing him to men of today who beg for words. Sunshu Ao, son of Wei Jia, was named Yi; as a hunter, he became Prime Minister to King Zhuang of Chu, living before Confucius. Shi Nanyi Liao was skilled at juggling balls and bells, keeping eight in the air while one remained in hand. When Chu fought Song, Yi Liao bared his chest and stood before the army, juggling as the blades fell—both armies halted, and victory was won. Both lived before Confucius’ death, yet this is but a parable. These two resolved difficulties and stilled warfare through non-action—then what need have I for words? If words were of use, I would gladly have a beak three feet long. If words are of no use, then such a beak is useless.

Master Qi had eight sons, whom he arrayed before him. He summoned Jiu Fang Yin and said, "Examine my sons for me and tell me which is most auspicious." Jiu Fang Yin said, "Kun is most auspicious." Master Qi started in surprise and joy, asking, "In what way?" He replied, "Kun will share the ruler’s table for the rest of his life." Master Qi’s face fell, and he wept, saying, "What has my son done to reach such an extreme?" Jiu Fang Yin said, "To share the ruler’s table is to extend blessings to three clans—how much more to one’s parents? Now, sir, you hear this and weep—this is to shun good fortune. Your son is auspicious; you, his father, are not." Master Qi said, "Yin, how could you know that Kun is auspicious? His fortune will be exhausted in wine and meat, entering through nose and mouth—how could you know its source? I have never herded, yet a ewe was born in my inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet a quail was born in my secluded hall. Why should I find this strange?

What I share with my sons is wandering in heaven and earth. With them, I roam in joy through heaven; with them, I roam in sustenance upon earth. I do not share in their affairs, do not share in their plans, do not share in their strangeness. With them, I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth, not contending with things; with them, I drift and wander, not sharing in their affairs. What is fitting now is but the recompense of the vulgar world.

Wherever there are strange omens, there must be strange conduct—perhaps this is not the fault of my sons and me, but heaven’s doing. This is why I weep."

Within no time, he was sent bound to Yan, where bandits seized him on the road. To sell him whole would be difficult; to maim him would be easy. Thus they severed his foot and sold him in Qi, where he happened to be bought by Qu Gong, a wealthy man serving as street warden. There, he ate meat to the end of his days.

Nie Que encountered Xu You and asked, "Where are you going?"
"I am fleeing from Yao."
"Why so?"
"Yao teems with benevolence—yet I fear he will become the laughingstock of the world. Later generations may even turn to cannibalism. The people are not hard to gather: love them, and they draw near; benefit them, and they come; praise them, and they strive. But bring them what they detest, and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, yet those who discard them are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is neither sincere nor genuine—it is the device of ravenous birds and greedy beasts. Thus, one man’s restraints are used to control the world’s profit, like a single fleeting shadow. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world, yet he does not see how they harm it."

Only those who stand beyond it understand: the worthy know this. There are the "warmly content," the "soaked and mired," and the "coiled and crouched." The so-called "warmly content" learn the words of a single master, then glow with private delight, smug in their sufficiency, unaware that nothing has truly begun—these are the "warmly content." The "soaked and mired" are like lice on a pig: they pick the sparse bristles, imagining them a vast palace or grand park, nestling in the crooks of hooves, the creases of knees, the gaps between teats, believing themselves secure in their cozy dens. They do not know that one morning the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread the straw, and wield the torch—leaving them charred along with the pig. These advance and retreat within their bounds—these are the "soaked and mired." The "coiled and crouched" are like Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton—mutton reeks. Shun’s conduct reeked, and the people delighted in it. Thus he moved thrice, each time founding a city, until at Deng’s wastes a hundred thousand households gathered. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from barren soil, saying, “May his coming bring us blessing.” Shun was raised from barren soil, his years advanced, his hearing and sight dimmed.

The so-called "coiled and crouched" cannot rest or return—this is why the spirit-person abhors the thronging of crowds. When crowds throng, there is no harmony; without harmony, there is no benefit. Thus, they hold no one too dear, no one too distant, embracing virtue and kindling harmony to follow the world. This is what is called the "true person." To the ants, they abandon cunning; to the fish, they gain strategy; to the sheep, they forsake intention. With the eyes, they see; with the ears, they listen; with the heart, they reflect upon the heart. If such is the case, their equilibrium is like a plumb line, their transformations like the tracing of a curve.

Guo’s commentary:
This is the origin of contention among the benevolent—hence the calamities of later ages. Once benevolence and righteousness are practiced, pretense arises to enact them. Their traces become visible, and the greedy will borrow these tools to achieve their aims. If benevolence and righteousness each arose from genuine feeling, their restraints would never cease. To carve all things and all forms with a single blade is to wound them. Only by esteeming the worthy externally can the worthy remain unfeigned. The "cozy dens" exhaust their intentions in shaping teachings—how could they know of my solitary transformation in the mysterious darkness? Without the talent to comprehend change or transcend the world, clinging to momentary advantage, they are all but lice on swine. The sage’s form differs not from that of ordinary people—thus the ears and eyes. The use of the eyes may wane, yet the spirit remains ever whole. If one is immature in youth and declines in old age, can the sage’s sagacity be achieved in a single morning? The crowds come of their own accord, not drawn by desire. Clearly, Shun’s attainment of the realm arose from necessity, not choice. If he sought profit from the people, his blessings upon Shun would be but bodily toil. The ant, the fish, and the sheep—these three have yet to free their ears, eyes, heart, and intention. Thus, they cannot cast off the plumb line to find equilibrium or sever traces to reach the mysterious barrier.

Lü’s commentary:
The affairs of Shun and Yu—I understand them well.

Then this is but the instrument of those who mimic the greedy birds. To call it "benevolence and righteousness" is still to remain within the realm of knowledge; with knowledge, one is confined by form and instrument—this is not what the world shares in common. Thus, when one person’s defenses and controls benefit the world, it is no more than a single hiding place. This is not the natural, curved completion that leaves nothing behind.

What is called the root of great disorder must arise between Yao and Shun, while its branches persist a thousand generations later. This is it: taking warmth as right without knowing the world has ultimate sufficiency; taking beauty as right without knowing the world has ultimate perfection. Thus, learning the words of a single master, one deems oneself complete, unaware that what is named has never truly existed.

To be drenched is not to depart; to wait is to depend. Content in baseness and filth, one remains unaware of disaster. Therefore, to name it after the lice on swine is to gather and hoard without concealing its stench, causing the world to admire and turn toward oneself—hence the name of Shun. From learning the words of a single master without knowing that nothing has ever truly existed, one becomes mired in dependence when seeking profit and tangled in hoarding when facing harm. Speaking of Shun’s traces, what does the world add to me? It is enough to weary the body. Thus, speaking of hoarding, though the crowds come and turn toward one, even like Yao and Shun, this is what the spirit-person detests. Not comparing oneself to them, they come not for profit.

This is how the true person holds no extreme closeness or distance, embracing virtue and blending harmony to follow the world. The world delights and turns toward them; Shun, too, delights and follows. Shun regards the world as a worn-out sandal, and what makes Shun "Shun" he regards as dust, grime, chaff, and husks. What is this if not the spirit and the real?

The ant, with its knowledge, busies itself; the fish, by its depth, preserves its life; the sheep, with its intention, grows fierce. With the eye, one sees—what is seen is obtained. With the ear, one hears.

Then with the ear, one hears—what is heard is obtained. With the heart returning to the heart, one knows—what is known is obtained. Cast aside knowledge and intention, and one conceals the self in the depths of the abyss, attaining what is called seeing what is seen, hearing what is heard, knowing what is known. Then there is nowhere one goes that is not level, assisting things by their own nature without deliberate action. This is the Way of returning to one’s true state.

**Limited View:**
In governing the world, one ought to practice non-action and let transformation arise of itself. If one toils diligently, seeking to benefit and aid with effort, one will fall short and inevitably resort to artifice. Once artifice emerges, calamities and harms arise without end. Those who stand above the people must truly take the hearts of the common people as their own hearts. Though they do not practice benevolence and righteousness, they will unwittingly accord with them. Otherwise, it is like lending the tools of snares and nets to a greedy hunter—the harm done to creatures will only grow worse.

Thus, when one person imposes controls, seeking to benefit the world, it is like trying to grasp the nature of the myriad things in the fleeting moment of a blink. One knows only that exalting the worthy brings advantage, yet does not see how it harms later generations. Only by standing outside the realm of the worthy can one know this—one must rise above by a head’s height before one can see through it.

The "ant, fish, sheep" triad was spoken by Shun in response to a malodorous conduct, and his words were most extraordinary. He placed the ant first, the sheep next, and the fish last—not being transformed by the stench. The ant abandons knowledge, not being moved by malodorous conduct to sway others. The sheep abandons intention. Thus, superiors and inferiors each remain content in their station, without traces of emulating sages or exalting the worthy. Like fish that are never sated by the depths and gather in rivers and lakes—is this not a wise course? Thereafter, one uses the eye to see the eye, not deluded by forms; the ear to hear the ear, not confused by sounds; the heart to return to the heart, not enslaved by knowledge. Thus, one’s equilibrium is as straight as a plumb line, becoming a model for the world. In responding to the vicissitudes of affairs, one follows the spontaneity of principle—what worry is there that the world will not transform itself, or that one must govern it with deliberate effort?

*Comprehensive Meaning*: The ant is most minute, the sheep most yielding, yet neither is entirely without knowledge or intention. The true person adopts their minuteness and yielding, yet discards their knowledge and intention—just as fish gather in water and nothing more.

*Brush Jottings*: "Using the eye to see the eye" means not seeing with the self. "Using the ear to hear the ear" means not hearing with the self. "Using the heart to return to the heart" means not returning with the self. Only when the self exists does one fail to follow things, often losing equilibrium. When ears, eyes, and heart are all entrusted to things without any interference—this is what *Liezi* calls "discarding the heart and employing the form." How could it not be as level as a plumb line? As for changes, one follows them. "Changes" refer to the myriad transformations of things. Speaking of the heart alongside ears and eyes corresponds to the Buddhist scriptures’ six roots: intention, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body—all sharing the same meaning of equilibrium. The plumb line represents change, and following it represents spontaneity. Wang Yuanze’s version reads: "Its equilibrium is like water; its straightness, like a plumb line; its changes, to be followed."

The true persons of antiquity treated things with the Heavenly, not imposing the human upon the Heavenly. The true persons of antiquity attained this; those who lost it were born to lose it.

Death is attaining it; death is losing it. Life is medicine—its true substance is *jǐn*, *jiégěng*, *jīyōng*, and *shǐlíng*. These are emperors in their time—how can one exhaust their praise? Goujian, with his three thousand armored men, perched upon Mount Fangjī, had only Fan Li who knew how to preserve what was doomed to perish; only Fan Li did not know why his own person would come to grief. Thus it is said: the owl’s eyes have their proper use; the crane’s legs have their proper measure—dissect them, and you harm them. Hence the lament: when the wind passes over the river, it diminishes it; when the sun passes over the river, it diminishes it. Yet if wind and sun were to contend in guarding the river, the river would deem them no disturbance at all. They rely on the source and proceed from it. Thus water guards earth; the reflection guards the person; things guard things. Hence, the eye’s clarity is perilous; the ear’s acuity is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of externals is perilous. All abilities stored in the treasury are perilous. When peril accumulates, it cannot keep pace with the growth of misfortune. Here lies its reversal: following merit brings its fruition. To wait long and then claim it as one’s own treasure—is this not lamentable? Thus, the ruin of states and the slaughter of peoples never cease, for they do not inquire into the cause.

(*Jǐn*, as Sima Biao notes, is *wūtóu*; *jīyōng* is *qiàn*; *shǐlíng* refers to *xīlíng*, as mentioned in the *Jìn Xué Jiě*.*)

Guo’s commentary: Abiding in non-action to await action—only thus can one attain it when action arises. Seeking non-action amid action only deepens entanglement. Life and death, gain and loss, each follow their abode. In life, one may attain it; in death, one may lose it again. What is needed is without baseness; what is untimely is without worth. Worth and baseness have their seasons—who can make them constant? Each suits its time; none can be universally applied. Thus, there are times of loss and times of grief. *Jiě* means "to sever." The formed naturally burden one another; only by transcending form can one remain unscathed. Though wind and sun pass over the river and truly diminish it, one does not perceive it. The unperceived is not the undiminished—it is the reliance on the source. Without intention, one rests within one’s allotment, thus attaining certainty. With intention, one strays into boundlessness, thus falling into peril. Therefore, value the inability to act and entrust oneself to the natural. *Cuì* means "to gather." If one cannot comprehend this, misfortune grows unchecked. Reversal lies in guarding one’s nature, where merit arises effortlessly. Haste precludes fruition—thus it is said: "its fruition." To wait long and claim it as one’s own treasure refers to possessing knowledge and ability. Thus, the calamities of ruin and slaughter are one’s own doing, for one does not inquire into the source of misfortune—only into the heart’s cultivation to avert it.

Lü’s commentary: Treating things with the Heavenly means responding without contrivance; imposing the human upon the Heavenly, though acting, is never true action. The true person does not know life or death—sometimes attaining it in life, sometimes losing it in death. Death: all things cannot but live by it. This speaks to those who take life lightly. Sometimes it is said: attaining it in life, losing it in death. Life: to take life as loss, death as return—this speaks to those who abhor death. Like medicine, some is sweet, some poisonous; in its time, it is emperor, otherwise a mere minister. To take life as gain and death as loss is medicine for those who take life lightly; to take life as loss and death as return is medicine for those who abhor death. Observe the illness and administer accordingly—its transformations are beyond enumeration. Minister Fan knew how to preserve Yue from ruin but did not know why his own person would come to grief. Like the owl’s eyes, which see at night but not by day, their use cannot be abandoned; the crane’s legs, which are long but not short, have their measure and cannot be severed. This is to be bound by form and not know the source. Wind and sun pass over the river, not without diminishing it, yet the river deems them no disturbance—it relies on the source and does not exhaust. One who penetrates the Dao is at home with all things, yet this too has its source. Water reaches every crevice in earth, every ant’s burrow; the reflection follows the person’s every movement—without emotion, it guards with certainty. The ear’s hearing, the eye’s seeing, the heart’s thinking—none departs for an instant, thus things guard things with certainty. Yet the ear’s acuity, the eye’s clarity, the heart’s intent are not like water and reflection, without emotion, and so cannot but fall into peril. All abilities stored in the treasury are perilous. The treasury refers to the five viscera; peril means resting where one should not. If one cannot keep pace with change, misfortune gathers. Only by tracing it back does one reverse it; following merit brings its fruition. To wait long—this is why the superior person diminishes and diminishes again, for peril cannot be perfected. Yet the world claims it as its own treasure—is this not lamentable?

The received text: From "the owl’s eyes" onward, five instances of *gù* ("thus") elaborate the meaning. The owl’s eyes are bright at night but dim by day—they have their proper use. The crane’s legs are long but not short—they have their proper measure. To sever them with a blade harms their life. This speaks to following the natural. The next passage drives the point home: it is not about forcing things to conform but having one’s own source, like water with its headwaters, thus guarding earth, guarding the person, guarding things. This principle originally abides without separation, like water guarding earth, the reflection guarding the person, things guarding things—settled and unchanging. The three instances of *dài* ("peril") reverse the three instances of *shěn* ("certainty"). If the heart, ears, and eyes pursue externals, they cannot remain settled and fall into peril.

Moreover, extending this principle further: whatever one possesses as ability becomes a harm. To display it is to conceal it within. The formation of peril is not yet beyond remedy, but the growth of calamity accumulates—this speaks to how swiftly misfortune arises when one does not act rightly. To reverse peril into security, to turn calamity into fortune, one must proceed step by step with gradual effort. Even those who are resolute and self-mastering must wait long before success—this speaks to how difficult it is to cultivate goodness.

Yet the people of the world indulge their desires—ears, eyes, keen perception, and cunning thought—as if they were treasures. Near at hand, they lose their lives; on a grand scale, they destroy states, slaughter the people, and their misfortunes never cease. This is because they do not inquire into these matters, nor has anyone enlightened them.

The *Xin Zan* states:
Water arises from earth yet does not depart from earth. Reflection arises from form yet does not depart from form. Things emerge from the Creator yet do not depart from the Creator. Thus it is said: guard them. They are settled, yet earth has no intention toward water, and water thus clings to it. Form has no intention toward reflection, and reflection thus arises. The Creator has no intention toward things, and things thus come to be. None of these three has any intention of mutual dependence.

How can the common world resemble this? The eye necessarily seeks clarity, the ear necessarily seeks acuity, the heart necessarily seeks to pursue externals. Thus, to necessarily seek clarity is to have intention toward clarity; to necessarily seek acuity is to have intention toward acuity; to necessarily seek to pursue externals is to have intention toward external things. Having intention toward keen perception and the pursuit of externals inevitably leads to peril—how can this be the Way of mutual dependence?

The utmost persons of antiquity knew that excessive knowledge is the root of calamity. Though wise, they never failed to relinquish wisdom, so misfortune could not entangle them. The common world, unable to do this, prides itself on its intelligence—this is why misfortune spreads unchecked.

Yet when misfortune first arises, it lurks within fortune, following its momentum—like Minister Fan Li, who initially preserved Yue. Thus it is said: its reversal depends on merit. But when it becomes a burden, it is not established in a single morning or evening. Consider Minister Fan Li, who in the end could not escape the loss of his life. Thus it is said: its fruition requires time. All this is summoned by intelligence.

The common world, unaware of this, instead treasures intelligence as the jewel of the self. Are these not the people described as "the benighted masses"?

Thus the foot’s relation to the ground: though it treads, it relies on what it does not tread to achieve its full reach. So too with human knowledge: though little, it relies on what it does not know to grasp what Heaven truly means. To know the Great Unity, to know the Great Yin, to know the Great Vision, to know the Great Equality, to know the Great Square, to know the Great Faith, to know the Great Constancy—this is perfection. The Great Unity unifies them; the Great Yin dissolves them like a crab’s molting; the Great Vision sees them; the Great Equality follows them; the Great Square embodies them; the Great Faith verifies them; the Great Constancy upholds them. In all, there is Heaven’s order, illumination, obscurity, and pivot—only then does one begin to possess them. Yet in dissolving them, one resembles one who does not dissolve; in knowing them, one resembles one who does not know. Only by not knowing does one truly know. In questioning them, one cannot be bound by limits, nor can one be without limits—intertwined and shifting, yet substantial. Past and present do not replace each other, nor can they be diminished. Can this not be called possessing great barriers?

To close is not to question—why then be perplexed? To resolve perplexity with non-perplexity is to return to non-perplexity—this is the highest non-perplexity.

To lift and draw them forth is to display their patterns. Guo’s commentary: Only when Heaven and Earth relinquish the myriad things can the wings of the cicada be known—how much more so for desiring to know what Heaven intends, can one do so without emptying the heart? The Great Oneness is the Dao. The Great Yin dissolves them; when its inner divisions are employed, the ten thousand affairs encounter no obstruction. To employ the self-manifestation of the myriad things is also the Great Eye. Following their fundamental nature so each attains its own is the Great Equality. To embody them so each attains its proper place is why the ten thousand directions all attain it—this is the Great Square. What is ordained has its appointed time, with no allowance for transgression—this is the Great Faith. When the real is unperturbed, it naturally stabilizes; thus, to uphold it with the Great Constancy is to not uphold it at all.

No thing is without its natural course; to follow it is illumination without contrivance. The utmost principle has its limit, but if one obscures it, one grasps its pivotal essence. That which begins them is the "other." Thus, I transmit without creating; to dissolve is to entrust it to the "other," and the "other" dissolves itself. Dissolution yields no merit, hence it resembles non-dissolution. Employing the "other’s" knowledge, hence it resembles non-knowing. If I do not know, then the "other’s" knowledge operates on its own. When the "other’s" knowledge operates on its own, there is nothing under Heaven that is not known. To be without limits is to respond to things appropriately without fixed methods. To be without absence of limits is for each to follow its own division. Though the myriad things are tangled and shifting, each thing possesses its own reality. Each possesses its own reality, so they cannot replace one another, nor can they be diminished—it is fitting that each exhausts its own division.

To guard and restrain them is to possess great barriers. If one questions these great barriers, then things have their ultimate divisions. Thus, Guo says: Entrusting oneself to the principle of things, what is there to be perplexed about? If perplexity cannot be dissolved, then the highest non-perplexity is the utmost foolishness. The sage follows and entrusts himself to it—hence the traces of emperors and kings differ, and their names vary with the age.

Lü’s commentary: What the feet tread is little; relying on what they do not tread, one can then be broadly good—this is what is meant by knowing non-use and only then can one speak of employing others’ knowledge. Relying little on what one does not know, one can then know what Heaven intends—thus the Great Oneness, the Great Yin, and even the Great Constancy can be known. Those who practice the Dao take the Great Oneness as their master, and there is nothing they do not penetrate. Entering the gate of profound obscurity, they reach the utmost yin’s principle and also arrive at the utmost yang’s source. Things bear yin and embrace yang, yet remain bound and cannot dissolve—this is because they do not know the source of the utmost yin.

The eye’s vision is limited; not seeing with the eye, there is nothing unseen. Following the One, none can equalize harmony with right and wrong—entrusting it to their twofold operation is following the Great Equality. Without south, without north, without east, without west—embodying the Great Square. Its essence is most real, and within it lies faith—verifying it with the Great Faith. Moisture burns without heat, rivers freeze without cold, thunder splits mountains, winds shake the sea, yet it remains unshaken—upholding it with the Great Constancy. To exhaust Heaven’s order is to halt at what knowledge does not know. Following illumination, though one does not know, there is nothing unknown. Obscuring the pivot, neither this nor that can find its counterpart. Beginning with the "other," that which responds to the "other" and "this" is inherently inexhaustible.

Dissolution resembles non-dissolution—words are originally unbound, hence non-dissolution precedes dissolution. Knowledge resembles non-knowing—it is originally without knowledge, hence non-knowing precedes knowing. This is how the utmost person roams among the common customs, appearing foolish and clumsy. To question with limits or without limits is to be bound by limits—this means seeking from one’s own boundaries, yet it cannot be sought between existence and non-existence. Tangled, it cannot be bound; shifting, it cannot be grasped—it is as if nothing exists, yet it possesses reality. Past and present do not replace each other and cannot be diminished.

Can one not call this possessing great barriers? Yang means to reveal its subtleties; Fang means to examine its reality. If the "other" does not question this, I cannot inform it with this. Only by seeing that there has never been a thing can one be without perplexity. To dissolve the perplexity of having things with this and still retain the state of never having had a thing is still perplexity. Only by dissolving it and returning to non-perplexity can one approach the Great Non-Perplexity.

Following the original text: What the feet tread is little, but what they do not tread is essential for action. What knowledge knows is little, but what it does not know is essential for great knowledge. The Great Oneness, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Equality, the Great Square, and the Great Faith—all are not confined to small matters. I consider them exhaustive, yet there is also Heaven’s inexhaustible. I consider following what one ought to do sufficient, yet there is also that which oversees it. I consider it profoundly obscure, yet there is also that which grasps its pivot. I consider it a beginning, yet there is also the "other"—the "other" itself is a beginning. Following the earlier statement that the Great Yin dissolves it, ultimately, this is dissolution, yet it resembles non-dissolution; this is knowledge, yet it resembles non-knowing. Only by not knowing does one then know—this aligns with the earlier statement about questioning without knowing.

Thus, in conclusion, the word "question" is introduced to bind it together. If one questions this Dao, which is fundamentally without boundaries yet also never without boundaries, it seems like the earlier debate over tangled hardness and whiteness, yet here it possesses reality. All things undergo replacement, but this cannot be replaced or diminished. *Heng* means to lift, and *fang* means to turn the hand repeatedly. When many lift and expound, answering with hands turning back and forth to point and display—this Dao, though spoken of as differing, is truly real. Is this not a great lifting and expounding, a handle for discourse? Why do people not question this and instead become perplexed by having something? If one can use one’s own non-perplexity to dissolve others’ perplexity, enabling them to return to non-perplexity, then all may achieve non-perplexity. Even without questioners, one still hopes for enlightened immortals among people—scholars often apply their minds in this way.

General observations from a limited perspective: Though Marquis Wu was fierce and stubborn, difficult to approach, and lacked persuasive discourse, the adept began by praising fine steeds to open his heart, also clarifying that a ruler’s regard for ministers must be discerning. Thus, he was initially rebuffed but ultimately aligned—this is because the good nature of the human heart cannot be entirely extinguished, just as one who leaves a country rejoices at seeing someone resembling a person. Upon meeting again, he then accepted loyal admonitions, even if harsh to the ear, to warn of his faults. Fond of harmony and detesting treachery, he fulfilled the essentials of self-cultivation—sincerity aligning with Heaven and Earth, exhausting the Dao of serving the state. Where does this lie? In acting with righteousness to benefit the people, laying down arms to seek governance.

The Yellow Emperor met Great Hiddenness, and the Seven Sages all became lost—this illustrates how, when the six senses are clouded, the heart’s ruler cannot alone be clear. If a ruler desires to see the great Dao, he must abolish sagacity and discard knowledge, seeking it in the spirit of guarding the heart and removing what harms the self. Then, Great Hiddenness will arrive without being sought.

Only in later generations did the various scholars diverge in their pursuits, concealing their inherent nature and turning toward the myriad things—no longer hoping to return to the root, thus drifting ever farther from the Dao. Take the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and the followers of Bing and Hui: each clung to one partial truth, claiming to have exhausted the Dao. Yet in their debates, when the thrust of their arguments struck true, they too could reveal the Dao’s subtleties—like the man of Ying whose foot-stamping aided the master carpenter’s work.

It is also said that only one with the talent of Xi Peng could bring forth Guan Zhong’s rise; arrogance hastens ruin, while humility invites praise—this serves to warn the world against pride and insolence. How could such posturing compare to those who still their hearts and wither their forms? Those who juggle balls or wield plumes remain entangled, their bonds difficult to undo.

Jiu Fang Gao discerned the essence of a horse without mentioning its lameness; Xu You, fearing Yao’s benevolence, fled to escape it—both saw the subtle and knew the manifest, prizing worthiness to secure advantage. The *jingen* and *weiling* herbs serve as imperial metaphors for how people shift with the wind; the Yellow River’s currents illustrate how transformation sweeps all things along. To cling to things is indeed delusion—yet none can avoid being swept away, and to be swept away is perilous.

Only one who knows contentment and does not tread upon the heart, who relies on unknowing, can fully embody Heaven to illuminate the Heaven in things. Then, one is no longer deluded and can resolve the world’s delusions. **Ze Yang, Twenty-Five**

Then Ze Yang journeyed to Chu, where Yi Jie spoke of him to the king, yet the king did not summon him. Yi Jie returned to Peng Yang and met with King Guo, saying, “Why did you not speak of me to the king?” King Guo replied, “I am not your equal—rather, Gong Yue Xiu is.” Peng Yang said, “What sort of man is this Gong Yue Xiu?” The king answered, “In winter, he spears turtles in Jiangxia; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. When someone passes by and asks, ‘Whose dwelling is this?’ he replies, ‘It is mine.’ Yi Jie is already incapable—how much more so am I? And I am not Yi Jie’s equal. As for Yi Jie’s character: though he lacks virtue, he possesses cunning. He does not commit himself wholeheartedly, yet his connections are firmly entangled in obscurity. In the realm of wealth and honor, men do not aid one another with virtue but instead assist in one another’s decline. The frozen borrow garments in spring; the sweltering long for winter’s return. The cold wind—such is the nature of the King of Chu. His form is august and stern; in matters of punishment, he grants no pardon, fierce as a tiger. If not for flatterers and men of true virtue, who could sway him? Thus the sage, in his poverty, makes his household forget their want; in his eminence, he makes kings and lords forget their ranks and titles, transforming them to humility. In his dealings with things, he delights in their harmony; in his dealings with men, he rejoices in their communion while preserving himself. Thus, though he may not speak, he intoxicates others with harmony; though he stands beside them, he transforms them, making fathers and sons fulfill their proper roles. How profound is his influence! Returning home, he remains in quiet unity with all he has bestowed. His effect on the human heart is as vast as this. Therefore it is said: await Gong Yue Xiu.

Guo’s commentary: King Guo, by praising Gong Yue Xiu’s character, sought to restrain Peng Yang’s eagerness to advance. He meant that he himself was not equal to Yi Jie, who pursued wealth and honor, forging connections through cunning and flattery to curry favor with superiors. “Assisting in decline” means that, in the rush to advance, virtue thins and reputation fades. The metaphor of cold and heat suggests that, though he follows the seasons’ gifts, he cannot meet Peng Yang’s expectations. The sage, serene and desireless, finds joy in what he encounters, prizing not extravagance but virtue. Thus his family forgets the bitterness of poverty; he scorns rank and title, valuing virtue instead. Detached, he sits in stillness, unaware of the honor upon him, so that kings and lords lose their sense of superiority. He delights in things without self-harm, rejoicing in their communion while preserving himself. Each finds contentment, and harmony flows without need for words. Standing beside others, he transforms them without relying on power, so that fathers and sons return to their proper places. His influence is like Heaven and Earth, quiet and unchanging. “Await Gong Yue Xiu” means he would have Peng Yang abandon the King of Chu and follow Gong Yue Xiu, whose tranquil virtue would settle the king’s restless heart.

Lü’s commentary: Gong Yue Xiu, being so free of desire, was surely trusted by the king. The spirit is the common ground of human hearts—it can be exhausted and yet still enter. Yi Jie claimed he could not enter, yet his connections were already entangled in the realm of wealth and honor, where men assist in one another’s decline. The frozen, in winter, borrow garments from spring; the sweltering, in summer, long for winter’s return—winter’s cold offers no relief. The King of Chu was harsh and cruel; only flatterers and men of true virtue could sway him. To speak of me to him was beyond my power. Only flatterers can bend a ruler’s integrity; only true virtue can bend his perversity. The flatterer is Yi Jie; the man of true virtue is Gong Yue Xiu. I delight in poverty and sit in stillness, so my family also forgets their want. When the Way is honored and virtue prized, rank and title lose their luster, and kings and lords are transformed to humility. He intoxicates others with harmony, his virtue sufficient to nourish the human heart without need for words. Standing beside others, he transforms them without relying on power. Fathers and sons return home, fulfilling their proper roles without neglecting human bonds. His influence is unified and unobtrusive, free from regret. When the human heart is so profoundly moved, its errors are undone. Gong Yue Xiu’s character is such that speaking of him to the king would surely be believed. Thus it is said: await Gong Yue Xiu.

Xun’s commentary: “Not committing himself wholeheartedly” means yielding to others so that none can fathom his motives. The frozen, encountering spring, find garments; the sweltering, meeting the cold wind, return to winter. This metaphor suggests that, though the King of Chu is steeped in desire, he is easily swayed by persuasion. To “sway” means to submit: flatterers do so with flattery, the upright with uprightness. “Transforming to humility” means becoming submissive. Standing beside others, he transforms them into proper father-son relationships. “How profound is his influence!” expresses admiration—whether concealing or employing his power, he remains unmoved, free from the common cravings of men. His effect is as vast as this. The passage from “This is my dwelling” to “assisting in decline” describes Gong Yue Xiu; from “The frozen” to “who could sway him” describes the King of Chu; and from “Thus the sage” onward describes following Gong Yue Xiu.

Fang’s commentary: The frozen must borrow garments, yet even thick clothing is not as warming as spring’s gentleness; the sweltering must seek wind, yet even a cool breeze is not as relieving as winter’s arrival. Those who covet power must rely on the favor of the mighty, yet even the mighty’s favor is not as noble as the self-sufficiency of retreat. With the King of Chu’s power, how much greater is his cold than winter’s chill, his heat than summer’s swelter! Those entangled in obscurity would weary of him—how could they succeed? Thus it is said: await Gong Yue Xiu—this is admonition.

The sage, in his thoroughness, is boundlessly intertwined with all things as one, yet unaware that this is his nature. He returns to his mandate, moves with spontaneity, and takes Heaven as his teacher. Others follow and name it. How troubling is knowledge, for the actions it guides are fleeting—when will they cease? How can one who is born beautiful rely on others for recognition? If not told, he does not know his beauty in others’ eyes. If he knows, he seems not to know; if he hears, he seems not to hear. His joy is endless, and others’ admiration for him is likewise unceasing—this is his nature. The sage’s love for others is such that, if not named, they do not know his love. If he knows, he seems not to know; if he hears, he seems not to hear. His love for others is endless, and their contentment in him is likewise unceasing—this is his nature.

Guo's Commentary:
[To "attain the intertwining" is what is called "penetrating the profound." It pervades all as one, with no inner or outer, yet all is thoroughly illuminated. If one does not know why it is so yet it is so—what is this if not nature? To "sway" is to sway of itself; to "act" is to act of itself. None fails to return to the mandate and take its naturalness as teacher. This is not striving for a name or exalting one’s traces—moving by following nature, one’s traces are naturally exalted, and thus others cannot humble the name. To act by relying on knowledge is to be entangled in cares and mirrors. A mirror reflects things impartially, and thus people admire it. How could the mirror know it is mirroring when it mirrors? If one is born mirror-like, others call it a mirror. If people do not tell one another, none knows their beauty in others. It is like the sage—others give the name. The mirror’s delightfulness lies in its lack of emotion: whether one knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, it reflects what comes before it, and thus is endless. If the mirror depended on hearing and knowing, it would cease at times. What one’s nature does not favor, how could it reflect for long? The sage’s love is like the mirror. Yet because it benefits things, others give the name. If people do not tell one another, none knows his love for others. Vast and unobstructed, he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs, yet the Dao accords with loving others—thus he can be endless. If love for others depended on hearing and knowing, it would wane at times. How could what nature does not settle in endure for long?]

Lü's Commentary:
[The human heart is entangled in affairs and things, unaware of the one body. Only the sage can penetrate this, thus inwardly not seeing the self and outwardly not seeing things—things and self are one. What he embodies is inherently all-pervading. That he does not know why it is so is limited to nature and not obtained from without. To "return to the mandate" is to return to the root; to "sway and act" is to be like the teeming grasses. Though still and returning to the mandate, this does not hinder swaying and acting. Thus, though speaking all day, he has not spoken; though acting all day, he has not acted—all is simply taking Heaven as teacher. What Heaven knows, he does not know. How could I know myself to be a sage? Others follow and name it. Without knowledge, there is no care. The multitude worries over knowledge, and their actions are like galloping—how could they have a moment of rest? How could one attain this? One born beautiful is given a mirror by others, and only after being told does he know his beauty in others. Whether knowing or not knowing, hearing or not hearing, his delight is endless, and others’ admiration for him is likewise unceasing—this arises from nature. The sage’s love for others is such that others give the name, and only after being told does one know it is love for others. Whether knowing or not knowing, hearing or not hearing, his love for others is endless, and others’ contentment in him is likewise unceasing—this arises from nature. It is not increased or diminished by knowing or not knowing, hearing or not hearing.]

Following the root, entangled in the intricacies of affairs and principles, only the sage can fully comprehend them. Throughout the body, nothing is not this principle, yet one does not know its source—this is called the nature. In stillness, it returns to the root and restores the mandate; in movement, its swaying and arising all accord with Heaven. Thus, people name it the sage. Worrying over knowledge, their actions are ever without respite—human life does not reach a hundred years, yet they constantly harbor the cares of a thousand. Gazing upon an old state or former capital, one feels unbounded joy. Even if hills, mounds, grasses, and trees have changed nine parts out of ten, the joy remains unbounded—how much more so for those who see what they see and hear what they hear?

A tower of ten *ren* hangs suspended amidst the multitude—this is the mystery. The house of Ran Xiang attained its central pivot, following completion without end or beginning, without limit or time. The one who transforms with things is not transformed. How could one ever abandon this to take Heaven as a teacher and fail to learn from it? All things would then be enslaved to what one takes as their task.

How is it that the sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with man, never begun with a beginning, never begun with things? They move with the world without decline, their actions complete yet not excessive, their harmony perfect. How did Tang attain his minister of chariots, or the gatekeeper Yin Deng serve as his tutor? Following the master without constraint, he attained the capacity to follow completion and thus became its steward. The name of his name was Ying Fa, who grasped both aspects. Confucius, in exhausting his thoughts, served as his tutor. The house of Rong Cheng said: "Remove the days, and there are no years; no inside, no outside."

Unbounded joy, ease amidst the profound—*Yuan Jia* edition reads "leisure." Excessive indulgence, or as another says, ruin and decay.

Guo’s commentary: *"If even what one has long possessed still brings such unbounded joy, how much more so when one attains their true nature? To bind and unite—what one has always seen, what one has always heard, still brings such ease; how much more so when one embodies its essence and employs its nature? Though the multitude clings to habit, even in peril they remain at leisure; how much more so the sage, who knows no peril?*

*Ran Xiang was a sage-king of antiquity. Dwelling in emptiness, he followed things, and things formed themselves. With things, he had no end, no beginning; suddenly, all moved together. Thus, he transformed with things, yet remained constantly without self. Being constantly without self, he was constantly unchanging.*

*What is the use of striving? Why not abandon what one strives for? Only by having no master does one attain the mastery of Heaven. Yet even mastering Heaven is not free from subjugation—how can it suffice as a pursuit? If mastering Heaven is still insufficient, how much less so what lies below it? Only when Heaven, man, the beginning, and things are all absent does one achieve perfect union.*

*Thus, Tang entrusted matters to his hundred officials without interference. He allowed them to gather naturally, not confining them; to disperse freely, not releasing them. Even his ministers of chariots could follow the self-formation of things, and Tang attained this. Thus, his name was lent to things, and his merit did not reside in himself. The name and method are but traces of the past, not the true fulfillment.*

*Therefore, it is said: ‘Ying, free and without intent, entrusts governance to the many officials, and thus his name and traces appear in them.’ Confucius said: ‘What thought, what worry is there in the world? Thought is already exhausted.’ If even the slightest concern remains, how can one be still and unmoving, responding endlessly to the infinite, aiding the spontaneity of the myriad things?*

*Rong Chengzi said: ‘Remove the days, and there are no years.’ The reason we now have years and preserve days is because of life and death. If there were no death, no life, then the reckoning of years and days would be abolished. Without self and other, there is no inside or outside."*

The Lü commentary states: *Gazing upon the old brings joy—such is human nature. Even if the mulberry trees on the hills twist and entwine, one still feels this joy, yet this is merely to forget their origin. How much more so when what we see and hear has stood alongside heaven and earth, becoming our homeland for so long? Yet to perceive and hear it is like gazing from a towering terrace suspended amidst the multitude—nothing escapes its view. How boundless is this joy!*

*"Amidst the multitude"* refers to places devoid of people, where the center revolves endlessly without beginning or end, where things form spontaneously without agency. Thus, there is no termination or commencement, no moment of reckoning. *"Reckoning"* means calculation; when one merges with the transformations of things, if even one aspect remains untransformed, why would it not persist? Its movement is constant, without pause or cessation.

Those who seek to emulate heaven but fail merely follow things in their pursuits. The sage, however, has never distinguished between heaven and humanity, nor between beginnings and things. Moving in unison without cessation, complete yet unexhausted—this is what is called *"returning to the mandate"* and *"acting in accord."* The true emulator of heaven thus aligns with it.

Tang obtained the *Controller of Chariots*, who presided over regulation and governance. The *Gatekeeper* and *Steward of Constancy* were the offices he entered. *"Constancy"* refers to the enduring cultivation of the Dao. The *Controller of Chariots* is the mind’s rectitude; what it enters is the Dao. Constancy is the Dao’s permanence—all these take heaven as their teacher.

Only by following the teacher without being confined by things, and by obtaining the ability to *"follow completion,"* do names arise. Thus, the names of *Controller of Chariots* and others follow the completion of one’s mind, not the names of those who act with intent. Its essence is the Dao; its excess is the method. Observing the origin of names reveals the source of methods—this is called *"dual manifestation."* Though there is perception, if one does not realize that the world has never begun with thought or worry, it remains incomplete. Thus, Confucius exhausted all concerns to serve as its tutor. Yet Confucius was not Tang’s tutor.

By *"following completion,"* one attains what Ran Xiangshi obtained. From this, we know that the names of *Controller of Chariots* and others are allegories. *"Remove the days, and there are no years"*—thus, one does not recognize time. *"Without inside or outside"*—thus, one does not recognize space. Only those who exhaust all concerns can partake in this.

---

**Dubious Alone** states: *The joy of perceiving one’s nature is like the joy of seeing one’s old homeland. Even climbing a perilous high terrace becomes effortless with familiarity—how much more so for one who attains true nature?*

Ran Xiangshi and the sage-kings before the Three Sovereigns grasped the principle of true emptiness, revolving endlessly and following the myriad things to complete the Dao, without beginning, end, or reckoning. To *"merge with the transformations of things"* is to be one with them; not transforming in one aspect enables transformation in all. Why do those in the world who act with intent not abandon their doing and return to natural true nature? Yet those who deliberately seek to emulate heaven fail—how much more so those who follow things without return?

There has never been a heaven, a humanity, a beginning, or things—yet heaven, humanity, beginnings, and things exist of themselves. Moving through the world, they bend and extend without cessation; in full conduct, they guard humility without excess. How can they so merge with principle? The offices of *Controller of Chariots* and *Gatekeeper*, the title *"Steward of Constancy"*—these names of the Dao can serve as teachers for others.

The sage follows the teacher without being confined by the teacher, simply allowing spontaneity. For example, if the other is an infant, one becomes an infant with them. Tang obtained these three as his transmission, following them without confinement, aligning with and completing the Dao. Thus, Tang became the one who bore their names, while the traces of those three vanished from the world.

These names—*"excess method"* and *"dual manifestation"*—appeared in Tang. Though Tang was a sage who fulfilled the human Dao, his methods were not yet complete. By the time of Confucius, the world’s transformations were fully manifest, so he exhausted all concerns to establish and complete the methods—thus serving as Tang’s tutor.

---

**Following the Origin** states: *Heaven is spontaneity. To abandon the teacher and method is to depart from spontaneity. Those in the world who are not at peace with their nature sacrifice themselves to things, making them their affairs. How can such affairs align with the Dao?*

The sage transcends even heaven’s absence—what then remains of so-called humanity, beginnings, or things? Though moving alongside the world, they are not hindered; though engaging with affairs and things, their conduct is complete without falling into excess. How can this not align with the Dao?

What does *"dual"* refer to? The *Gatekeeper* and *Steward of Constancy*—some say these are Yi Yin. Tang took them as teachers without being bound by rules, achieving success through allegory. What they accomplished was merely to bear Tang’s names, making him renowned in the world. Yet names are external, surplus to one’s true nature—what benefit do they bring? They only make others see the ruler and minister as admirable.

Yet Confucius and his disciples exhausted their thoughts to serve the rulers of their time—this was excessive. The later quote from Rong Chengzi—*"The reason years are named as such is because they accumulate three hundred and sixty days. Remove the days, and there are no years"*—means that if one eliminates even the subtlest thought, the burden of external names vanishes. Without inside, there is no outside.

---

**Xu Shichang** states: *From "Tang obtained the Controller of Chariots" onward, the three obtained their roles, mutually reinforcing one another—only thus can it be understood. The Yellow Emperor commanded Rong Cheng to create the calendar, hence his saying, "Remove the days, and there are no years." Some commentators mistakenly take Rong Cheng as an ancient sage.*

**Wei Ying** states: *Wei Ying made a covenant with Tian Houmou, who betrayed it. Wei Ying was enraged and intended to send an assassin. Xi Shou heard of this and found it shameful, saying: "You are a lord of ten thousand chariots—why resort to the methods of a commoner? Allow me to request two hundred thousand armored troops to attack him, capture his people, seize his cattle and horses, and make his lord’s back burn with fury before seizing his state. Let him flee, then strike his back and break his spine!"*

*Ji Zhi heard of this and found it shameful, saying: "Building a ten-ren wall only to tear it down—this is the toil of convict laborers. Now, for seven years, there has been no war..."*

This is the foundation of a king’s rule—Yan’s chaotic words must not be heeded.

Master Hua heard this and found it shameful, saying: "Those who speak well of attacking Qi are agents of chaos; those who speak well of not attacking are also agents of chaos. To call both attacking and not attacking agents of chaos—this too is the speech of an agent of chaos."

The lord said: "Then what should be done?"
He replied: "Your lordship need only seek the Dao."

Master Hui heard this and went to see Dai Jinren. Dai Jinren said: "There is a creature called the snail—do you know of it?"
The lord said: "Yes."
Dai Jinren continued: "On the left horn of the snail there is a state called Chus; on the right horn, a state called Mans. At times, they fight over territory, leaving tens of thousands of corpses. After pursuing the routed army for fifteen days, they return."
The lord said: "Alas! Are these empty words?"
Dai Jinren replied: "Allow me to make it real for you. When your mind roams the four directions, above and below—is there a limit?"
The lord said: "There is no limit."
Dai Jinren said: "To know the mind’s roaming in the boundless and then return to the realm of states that are known—do they seem as if they exist, as if they do not?"
The lord said: "Yes."
Dai Jinren said: "Within the known realm lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies your lordship. Do you and the lord of Mans have any real distinction?"
The lord said: "There is no distinction."

The guest departed, and the lord was left in a daze, as if something had been lost. When the guest left, Master Hui saw the lord and said: "That guest is a great man—even a sage cannot compare to him."

Master Hui said: "Blowing into a pipe produces a resonant sound, but blowing into the ring of a sword’s hilt yields only a faint *xuē*. Yao and Shun are praised by all, yet speaking of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint *xuē*."

Guo's Annotation:
The snail is most minute, yet it bears two horns—truly, if one knew that what men contend over is as trifling as this, there would be no strife under Heaven. The realm where human footprints reach is called "the known"—this refers to all within the Four Seas. Now, though one may take the Four Seas as vast, when measured against the boundless, they seem as if they exist, as if they do not. The lord and the lord of Mans are both finite things; being finite, whether great or small, neither can be compared to the boundless. Even Heaven and Earth, sharing in the boundless, are all as nothing—how much less the Liang within Wei, the lord within Liang, that they should contend? Lost in a daze, as if something had been lost, he mourned the pettiness of what he had contended over. It is like the faint *xuē*—so slight it is scarcely heard.

Lü's Annotation:
No fault is greater than desire for what is desirable. To speak well of attacking Qi is to reveal the desirability of gain, which surely disorders men; to speak well of not attacking is to reveal the desirability of goodness, which also disorders men. To say that both attacking and not attacking disorder men is still to be trapped in partial views, which further disorders men. Only by seeking the Dao can one avoid clinging to one-sided views, and thus still the source of disorder. If one roams the mind in the boundless, then the Four Directions and the Six Realms—the known lands like Wei and Liang—are all but projections of one’s own heart. Not only is there no distinction between the lord and the lord of Mans, but even the known lands—Wei, Liang, and Mans—are without distinction. Knowing this, nothing is greater than a hair’s tip, and Mount Tai is small. The lord awakened to the fact that the origin of strife is fundamentally non-existent, and so he was left in a daze, as if something had been lost. The divine man, the sage, and the great man are fundamentally without superiority or inferiority—the difference lies only in how they are spoken of. Blowing into a pipe produces a resonant sound because it has something to receive; blowing into a sword’s hilt yields only a faint *xuē* because it has nothing to receive.

Fu Mo's Note:
Blowing into a pipe still produces a resonant sound, but blowing into the ring of a sword’s hilt yields only a faint *xuē*—why? The pipe’s bore is small, yet it allows form and qi to clash and produce sound. The ring of a sword’s hilt, when blown into, lets the breath pass with a faint *xuē*, unable to produce sound. Now, to speak of the sage before the great man is to cause the sage to lose his sageliness—how could there be any sound? Even the yielding Yao and Shun could find no place for their voices—how much less the contention of the lord of Mans?

Confucius was traveling in Chu and lodged at the home of a seller of millet-wine on Ant Mound. A neighbor, a man with his wife, servants, and concubines, climbed onto the roof. Zilu said: "What is this *zōngzōng* gathering?" Confucius said: "This is the servant of a sage. He buries himself among the people, hides himself in the wilds. His voice is stilled, his aspirations boundless. Though his mouth speaks, his heart has never spoken. Far from conforming to the world, his heart disdains to accompany it—this is one who sinks beneath the land. Is this not Yiliao of Shinan?" Zilu asked to go and summon him. Confucius said: "Enough. He knows that I am renowned, that I am traveling to Chu, and that I would surely have the King of Chu summon him. He would take me for a flatterer. If this is how he feels about flatterers, he would be ashamed to hear their words—how much more to see them in person?" Zilu went to look, but his house was empty.

The servant of a sage is a disciple of the sage. "Sinking beneath the land" means to appear eminent yet vanish like sinking without water. 】

Guo's Annotation:【"Buries himself among the people" means to be one with them. "Hides himself in the wilds" means neither to flourish in advancement nor wither in retreat. "His voice is stilled" means his fame is diminished. "His aspirations boundless" means he seeks long life. Though his words are those of the world, his heart differs from it. One who "sinks beneath the land" is like sinking without water. "Renowned" means manifest. "How could he remain?" means it would be better to leave him to follow his own aspirations—his house was empty, and indeed he had fled.】

Lü's Annotation:【Seeing Confucius arrive and climbing onto the roof was to show he would not engage with him, intending to ascend even higher. The servant of a sage, though possessing sagely virtue, buries himself among the people, so his conduct is not visible; hides himself in the wilds, so he does not dwell in the mean of virtue. His voice is stilled, his aspirations boundless—retreating into seclusion, he roams beyond the world. Though his mouth speaks, his heart has never spoken. He desires silence yet cannot remain silent, differs from the world yet disdains to accompany it, wishing to flee the world and depart. Though he wanders among men with sagely virtue, none recognize him—like one who dwells on land yet sinks. From Confucius’ perspective, his restless efforts to attend to the world seem like flattery. Yet if all were like Yiliao, then among the mass of people, who would save the sagely Way? It would fall to the ground and never rise again. Formerly, Weisheng Mu once took Confucius for a flatterer, and Confucius replied that he dared not. Here, with Yiliao, he calls himself a flatterer to clarify that what he values lies elsewhere, and his restless efforts are not by choice.】

Changwu’s border guard asked Zilao: "When you govern, do not be reckless; when you order the people, do not be careless. Formerly, when I planted grain, if I tilled recklessly, the harvest repaid me recklessly; if I weeded carelessly, the harvest repaid me carelessly. The next year, I changed my method—deepened the plowing and thoroughly harrowed—and the grain flourished and multiplied. I had my fill for the whole year." Zhuangzi heard this and said: "Now, those who cultivate their bodies and order their minds often resemble what the border guard described: they flee their Heaven, depart from their nature, extinguish their emotions, lose their spirit, and take the crowd as their model. Those who recklessly abandon their nature allow the sprouts of desire and aversion to become their nature. Like reeds and rushes, reeds and reeds, they begin to sprout, propping up our form and soon uprooting our nature. Together they burst forth, leaking and erupting without choosing their outlet—boils, scabies, abscesses, internal heat, and oily urine are all such cases."【"Qi" is the same as "fen," a method of plowing. "Wei" and "jia" are reeds. "Together they burst forth, leaking and erupting" means essence and qi scatter and drain, rising to leak above and seeping below, without choosing their outlet.】

Guo's Annotation:【"Reckless" and "careless" mean hasty, superficial, and incomplete in fulfilling one’s duties. "Changing the method" means exhausting one’s duties without omission. Fleeing, departing, extinguishing, and losing are all caused by following the crowd. If each fully realizes its utmost, how could reeds harm the grain? Desire and aversion injure the true nature. When form is propped up loosely, spirit and qi are harmed. If desire and aversion lead the nature without stopping at what is proper, the consequences below—bursting, leaking, and erupting—are the repayment for recklessness. Thus, in cultivating the nature, how can one not fully realize its utmost?】

Lü's Annotation:【The daily diminishing of the Way to reach non-action is how one cultivates the body and orders the mind. Yet to flee Heaven, depart from nature, extinguish spirit, and lose emotions by following the crowd without restraint is the height of recklessness. If one could calmly maintain what has not yet arisen and easily plan for it, with internal desires and aversions like reeds and external reeds and rushes propping up our form and uprooting our nature, then the Heavenly principle would be extinguished. At such a time, could one still govern it? The bursting, leaking, and erupting below are all the work of desire and aversion as calamities, seizing what is true.】

Yang Yongxiu:【Poor plowing is called "reckless"; poor weeding is called "careless." "Lu" is salty land, so plowing such land requires extra effort. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s "Way of Plowing" speaks of "strengthening the soil and weakening it." "Mang" is grassy land; the *Book of Songs* says, "They hew, they slash"—this is good plowing. Not treating the salty land or clearing the grassy land is called "reckless plowing." Weeding is like birds pecking at food—this is good weeding. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* says, "Good weeding lets the elder brother grow and removes the younger brother"—the elder brother is fine grain, the younger brother is weeds like smartweed. Poor weeding lets the younger brother grow and removes the elder—this is "careless." "Lie" means to dig up the soil along with it. It also says: when desires and aversions first sprout, they seem to prop up our form but immediately uproot our nature. The character "shi" (beginning) pairs with "xun" (soon)—the common reading of "jianjia shimeng" as a phrase is incorrect.】

Boju studied under Lao Dan and said: "I request to travel the world." Lao Dan said: "Enough. The world is the same as this."

Boju again asked Lao Dan, saying: "Where shall I begin?"
Lao Dan replied: "Begin with Qi."
When he arrived in Qi, he saw a man condemned to execution. He pushed forward, forced his way through the crowd, removed his court robes to cover the man, and cried out to Heaven, wailing: "Alas for you! Alas for you! The world suffers great calamity—yet you alone have been the first to encounter it. It is said: 'Do not steal, do not kill.' Yet once honor and disgrace are established, one sees what brings suffering; once wealth and property are amassed, one sees what sparks strife. Now, by establishing what brings people suffering and amassing what sparks their strife, you exhaust their strength without respite. How could this not lead to such an end?

The rulers of old held that success lay in the people and failure in themselves; that uprightness lay in the people and crookedness in themselves. Thus, if their person erred, they would withdraw and reproach themselves. Now it is not so: they conceal their faults as if the people were ignorant, and when great difficulties arise, they punish the people for not daring to bear them. When tasks are heavy, they penalize those who cannot endure them; when the path is distant, they execute those who cannot reach it. When the people know their strength is spent, they resort to deceit. Day by day, deceit multiplies—how could the people not be deceitful? When strength is insufficient, they feign ability; when knowledge is lacking, they deceive; when wealth is wanting, they steal. On whom can the blame for thievery and deceit rightly fall?"

The character *lí* (離) here—Master Chǔ’s note states it should be *yī* (一), likely a scribal error in transcription. Guo Xiang’s commentary: "Great calamity in killing" refers to the matters below. Once such calamity exists, even if one warns against it, how can it be avoided? Each attains their own Way, and thus there is no honor or disgrace, no gain or loss in tumult. Yet when honor and disgrace are established, one boasts of what is called disgrace and strains for what is called honor. Racing and striving between boasting and straining—what is this if not affliction? If one takes contentment as wealth, what is there to contend over?

When those above have preferences, those below cannot rest in their fundamental duties. If the ruler makes no errors, the people naturally attain the Way; if the ruler makes no deviations, the people naturally align with uprightness. How then do the natures and forms of things come to be lost? All stem from the ruler’s interference, leading to these calamities.

Thus, self-reproach returns to one’s nature; concealment obscures it. Employing one’s nature reveals it. Therefore, when revealed by things, all recognize them; when things are easily altered, all dare to treat them lightly. When tasks match their strength, all endure them; when distances suit their capacity, all reach them. But when the people know their strength is spent, they resort to deceit to avoid punishment. If the ruler daily fosters deceit, how can one expect the people not to be false? Whom can one blame?

Lü’s commentary: "A certain official, having once held office, removed his court robes to cover the deceased, fully expressing his compassion. Clearly, this man had once committed faults. Thus, he did not hesitate to criticize those above. If superiors cannot regulate honor and disgrace, the people see their afflictions; if they do not value wealth and goods, the people see their contentions. Now, those above impose afflictions on the people and gather their grievances, incite their contentions and multiply their disputes—how can they expect the people not to steal or kill, not to incur death? Tang and Wu said, ‘The myriad regions’ faults lie in me alone,’ taking attainment as belonging to the people and failure to themselves. Yi Yin said, ‘If even one man is not saved, it is my fault.’ When their person erred, they withdrew and reproached themselves. Now, it is not so: they feign ignorance, punish those who dare not bear, execute those who cannot endure, and kill those who cannot reach. This differs from the leniency of the former kings, who measured people’s strength and pitied their incapacity. When the people know their strength is spent, they cannot but resort to deceit. If those above multiply deceit, how can they expect those below not to be false?"

Qú Bóyù, at sixty, transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he deemed right and end by condemning it as wrong. How could he know that what he now called right was not the wrong of fifty-nine years prior? All things have life, yet none see their root; they emerge, yet none see their gate. People all honor the knowledge they possess but do not know to rely on what their knowledge does not grasp—only then can one be said not to harbor great doubt. Cease, cease! There is no escape from this. Is this what is meant by "so" and "so"?

Guo Xiang’s commentary: "Transformation means following the world without being bound to self or other, aligning with things and flowing with the changes in their nature. Yet the changes in things’ nature have no end, no root, no gate—suddenly, naturally, thus none see them. Only those who neither live nor emerge can perceive their gate and fathom their root. What I do not know, other things may know. Thus, employing the knowledge of things, there is nothing unknown; relying solely on my own knowledge, what I know is scant. Now, if one does not rely on things for knowledge but instead exalts one’s own, how is this not great doubt? Unable to employ others, one has no place to lodge the self. Those who claim to be ‘so’—the world does not affirm them."

Lü’s commentary: "At sixty, Bóyù transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he deemed right and end by condemning it as wrong—just as Confucius did. If knowledge does not rest in what it does not know, then what is called ‘right’ is not fixed. How can one know that what is now deemed right is not the wrong of fifty-nine years prior? Things live, yet none see their root; they emerge, yet none see their gate. What one’s knowledge does not grasp is precisely the source and emergence of the myriad things. Yet people all honor the knowledge they possess, while regarding what their knowledge does not grasp, they constantly fear its emptiness and do not rely on it. Each time, they reach the brink and turn back—how is this not great doubt? Cease, cease! There is no escape. Such words ultimately cannot reach the ultimate, nor can one’s person contain them. Though what is now said may be ‘so,’ how can one know it is truly so? One must observe words to verify them."

A humble view: People pass through others to form an age; affairs change to form transformations. Like mosquitoes or wild horses passing before one, their number is unknown, yet one’s true constancy never alters. If one knows this, life and death cannot move the heart. The life, death, emergence, and entry of things have root and gate. If one truly knows what one does not know, the root and gate of the myriad things can be seen. Their life, death, emergence, and entry follow constant principles—what confusion can there be? Yet what people know and can do is but one ten-thousandth of what they do not know and cannot. Even sages cannot exhaust all knowledge and ability—how can they escape the transformations of things? Though what I now say may be deemed ‘right,’ how can I know it is truly so?"

Confucius asked the Grand Historian Dàtāo, Bó Chángqiān, and Shǐ Wěi: "Duke Líng of Wèi indulged in wine and revelry, neglecting state affairs; he pursued hunting and archery, ignoring relations with the feudal lords. How then did he come to be called ‘Líng’?" Dàtāo replied, "It was because of this." Bó Chángqiān said, "Duke Líng had three wives, with whom he bathed promiscuously. When the historian Fáng presented the ceremonial silk, he supported him, his arrogance reaching such extremes..."

Seeing a worthy man, he was so reverent—this is why he was called ‘Líng.’ Shǐ Wěi said: "As for Duke Líng, when he died, divination for burial at the ancestral tomb proved inauspicious, while divination at Shāqiū proved auspicious. Digging several fathoms deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing it and examining it, they saw an inscription that read: *‘Do not rely upon his descendants’*—whereupon Duke Líng seized it and buried it there. That Duke Líng was called ‘Líng’ has long been so. How could those two men suffice to understand it?"

*(The promiscuous bathing vessel refers to the three wives; Shǐ Fáng was Shǐ Yú. ‘Do not rely upon his descendants’ means the lineage was unworthy of trust, thus allowing the Duke to secure this site for his tomb.)*

Lǚ’s annotation states: *"Bó Chángqiān judged by human standards, while Shǐ Wēi judged by Heaven’s decree. Judging by Heaven, even posthumous names are not something humans can determine."*

Fāng Sīshàn comments: *"The *Book of Posthumous Names* states: ‘Disorderly yet unharmed is called *Líng*’; ‘Virtue’s essence and clarity is called *Líng*.’ Given how the Lord of Wèi conducted himself, why was his posthumous name *Líng*? The implication is that it was insufficient to match his wickedness. *Fèngyù* is akin to what we now call ‘summoning for audience’; ‘supporting and guiding him’ speaks to propriety. The shared bathing was one matter, the audience another—they need not have occurred simultaneously. The general intent shifts from human affairs to Heaven’s will, departing from contrivance to honor spontaneity, merely using this as an analogy. *Lǐ* is also written as *mái*; examining the inscription’s rhymes, *zǐ* and *lǐ* form a perfect rhyme. Ancient texts refer to the grave as *hāolǐ*, so writing it as *mái* is likely incorrect."*

Shàozhī asked Dàgōng Tiáo: *"What is meant by ‘the speech of the mound and village’?"*
Dàgōng Tiáo replied: *"The ‘mound and village’ unites ten clans and a hundred names to form customs. It merges differences into sameness and disperses sameness into differences. Now, if you point to a horse’s hundred parts, you do not obtain the horse; yet when a horse stands before you, you unite its hundred parts and call it a horse. Thus, hills accumulate the low to become high; rivers converge waters to become vast. The great man unites all to become impartial. Therefore, what enters from without has a master yet is not grasped; what issues from within has a norm yet is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct *qi*, yet Heaven does not bestow them, and so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not favor them, and so the state is well-governed. The civil and martial virtues of the great man are not bestowed, and so his power is complete. The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not favor them, and so it is nameless. Nameless, it is non-action; through non-action, nothing is left undone. Time has endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow ceaselessly—where there is obstruction, there is also what is fitting. Those who sacrifice themselves for distinct faces have what is correct and what is awry. Compared to the great marsh, all materials find their measure; gazing upon the great mountain, trees and stones share the same altar. This is called ‘the speech of the mound and village.’"*

Shàozhī said: *"Then is this sufficient to be called the Dao?"*
Dàgōng Tiáo said: *"No. Now, if we tally the number of things, they exceed ten thousand, yet we designate them as ‘the ten thousand things’—using the term for what is most numerous to name them. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yīn and yáng are the greatest of *qi*; the Dao is what they share in common. If we follow their greatness to name and designate them, that is permissible. But if we claim to have already attained it, how could we compare to it?"*

Then, if one employs private disputation as an analogy, it is like dogs and horses—how far they fall short!

*(Annotations: In the *Rites of Zhou*, four wells make a hamlet, four hamlets a mound, five households a neighbor-group, and five neighbor-groups a village. "Gift" here means bestowal; "awry" means discordant; "face" means orientation. It is said that hearts differ, and thus right and wrong diverge—what is correct in one case may be awry in another. "Measure" means dwelling-place. Though regions and positions differ, all take the great marsh as their dwelling; though trees and stones vary in kind, all share the same altar upon the great mountain. This may be called "the speech of the mound and village.")*

Guo’s commentary:
When the great person holds no private interests in the world, the world’s customs become unified. What enters from without is the transformation wrought by the great person; what emerges from within is the nature of the people and things. Each nature attains its proper state, so the people harbor no contrary intentions. The transformation must reach impartiality, so the ruler holds to nothing—thus they can unite the mound and village and merge the world, unify the ten thousand things and level their differences.

Distinct *qi* naturally exists, so it can endure; if it were fundamentally nonexistent and merely bestowed by Heaven, it would at times be exhausted. Distinct offices naturally possess their talents, so they are entrusted accordingly. It is not that the great person privately bestows them. As for cultural refinement, it arises from culture itself; martial prowess arises from martiality itself—these are not gifts from the great person. If they depended on bestowal, they would at times be lacking. Not only cultural and martial traits, but all natures are thus: names are limited by reality, so "non-action" prevails; realities each act on their own, so "nothing is not done." Times and eras change, but the one without intent follows them. Fortune and misfortune flow ceaselessly, turning back and forth. What is discordant here may be fitting there; each affirms what it affirms and cannot depart from it. What is correct here may be awry there. Compared to the great marsh, no material is discarded; gazing upon the great mountain, differences are united as one.

The speech of the mound and village can thus reveal the world. Things numbered do not stop at ten thousand—how much less can the unnumbered be called sufficient to name the Dao? Things attain communication through their own openness; if one forcibly designates this as the Dao, it is what is meant by "the Dao that can be spoken." The name already exists—how then could one attain and compare to it? Now, the disputation of names falls far short. Thus, to call it the Dao is still insufficient. It must reside in the realm of namelessness and wordlessness before it is reached. Though there are names, none can compare to it.

Lü’s Annotation:
To unite surnames and given names is to make the village diverse yet one; to disperse the village is to make names identical yet distinct. It is not like the words of a single household, where differences cannot be united and unity cannot be dispersed. The hundred parts of the body are no less than a horse—point to them and you cannot call them a horse; yet stand them all together and call them a horse. By analogy, the great person does not regard their greatness in its entirety, for then even what is called "great" cannot be attained. Compare it to hills and mountains, rivers and streams—these are the ultimate in greatness.

Thus, when viewed from things, the myriad things are all complete within me. What enters from without has its master within, and though one holds to the ten thousand, nothing is excluded. When viewed from myself, it flows freely as the ten thousand things pass away. What issues from within has its correctness and does not resist; it circulates everywhere and nothing is left untouched.

Heaven does not bestow the four seasons based on what is inherently theirs—if its achievements were incomplete, the year would not be fulfilled. The ruler does not claim the work of the five offices as his own—if wisdom were not all-encompassing, the state would not be well-governed. King Wen and the Duke of Zhou had different talents; the myriad things have different principles. Yet their non-bestowal and non-appropriation are like this—without self-interest, there is no self; with no self, nothing can be named. With no name, there is non-action; with non-action, nothing is left undone.

Times change without ceasing; fortune and misfortune have no constancy. What is adverse may be fitting; what is good may become ominous. The dispositions of things each follow their own faces, not uniform—some are correct, some are awry. What is correct may become strange. Since the principles of things are not uniform, the Dao is what makes them impartial. The Dao is fundamentally a forced name—calling it the Dao is still insufficient. Originally nameless, yet named with a name, it already exists. How then could it be compared to the nameless?

Following the Root:
The great person unites and makes things impartial. Thus, what enters from without has the impartial Dao as its master within and does not cling. What issues from within has the impartial Dao as its counterpart without, correct and not resisting. It does not bestow, so does not treat as favor. Time has its endings and beginnings; the world has its changes and transformations—one cannot cling to uniformity.

Sincerity is real. Fortune follows goodness, misfortune follows excess—all are real principles. What is adverse may be fitting, like the old man who lost his horse—who knows if it is not fortune? Those who follow their own faces have what is correct and what is awry. People each follow their private intentions as if faces were not different, yet seeking to correct them only leads to deviation.

Personal Insight:
Within every village, there must be one venerable in age and virtue who examines the sentiments of the multitude and establishes discourse—like the so-called "moonlit critiques" or local proverbs that record customs and things. This is the speech of the village, uniting differences as one. Those who emerge from the same village have disparities in age, worth, success, and failure—unity becomes difference.

The greatness of the world arises from the village; the greatness of the Dao pervades all things. Dispersing unity into difference is like pointing to the hundred parts of a horse; uniting differences as one is like assembling the hundred parts and calling it a horse. In speech, there is union and dispersion; in profound insight, all returns to undifferentiated oneness. Principles have their ultimate, beyond which sound cannot reach.

Hills and mountains accumulate the lowly; rivers and streams gather waters. The great person unites impartiality—this principle is no different. If one can unite the village and attain fittingness, then uniting the sentiments of the world is likewise. It resides in the single word "impartiality." Laozi said: "Impartiality becomes kingly; the kingly is what the world turns toward—how could it be refused?"

Thus, what enters from without is learning. The noble person’s learning is mastered by the Dao. Mastering the Dao, things are without obstruction. What issues from within is thought. The noble person’s thought is correct in principle. Correct in principle, things have nowhere to resist. Just as the four seasons have different qi yet complete the year, and the five offices have different duties yet complete governance, all return to the virtue of the great person, who embodies and elucidates the Dao’s impartiality. How then could it be named?

With no name, there is non-action; with non-action, nothing is left undone—this is the necessary consequence of principle. Yet times have their changes; mechanisms have their hidden and manifest. There are those for whom adversity becomes fitting, and those for whom correctness becomes deviation—all due to following one’s own sentiments, thus unable to avoid divergent tendencies.

For example, the hundred materials of the great marsh unite in the use of the master carpenter—difference becomes unity. The trees and stones of the great mountain disperse into the world’s use—unity becomes difference. If one profoundly unites with principle and returns to the Dao, what debate remains over unity and difference?

The name "Dao" is insufficient to exhaust the Dao; the number "ten thousand" is insufficient to exhaust things. Each is spoken of in terms of its greatness. The greatest of forms is governed by Heaven and Earth; the greatest of qi is governed by yin and yang. The Dao governs Heaven and Earth, yin and yang—how could its greatness be measured? Yet once there is the name "Dao," it cannot be compared to the nameless. Thus, the Dao of the perfected person operates in namelessness—how could the world name it?

Little Knowledge said: "Within the four directions, within the six conjunctions, where do the myriad things arise? What is the great impartiality?"
Great Impartiality said: "Yin and yang illuminate, cover, and order each other; the four seasons replace, give birth to, and destroy each other. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches arise here in succession; male and female unite here in commonplace fashion. Safety and danger alternate; fortune and misfortune give birth to each other; urgency and leisure rub against each other. Gathering and scattering form the names and realities that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted.

Following the sequence of their principles, the succession of their movements—exhaustion returns to beginning, ending returns to commencement. This is what things possess, what words exhaust, what knowledge reaches—nothing more. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what is abandoned, do not trace what arises. Where does this discussion end?"

Little Knowledge said: "Ji Zhen’s 'non-action' and Jie Zi’s 'or-activation'—which of these two theories is correct in its essence, which pervades its principles?"
Great Impartiality said: "Cocks crow and dogs bark—these are what people know. Even with great knowledge, one cannot speak of their spontaneous transformations, nor can one conceive of what they will become. Analyzing them precisely, they reach the point of no category; in greatness, they reach the point of being unencompassable. To activate them is to be inevitably constrained by things and ultimately considered excessive; to let them be is to have emptiness in reality and fullness in name. Having name and reality, they reside in things; having no name and no reality, they are in the emptiness of things. They can be spoken of, yet the more one speaks, the more distant they become. Before birth, they cannot be prevented; after death, they cannot be obstructed. Death and life are not far apart, yet their principles cannot be seen.

To activate them or let them be—both are doubtful assumptions. I observe their roots—they are without end. I seek their ends—they are without cessation. Without end, without cessation—speech is without it."

With things, they share principle; to activate them or let them be—this is the root of speech. With things, they begin and end—Dao cannot be possessed, possession cannot be without Dao. Dao is a name borrowed for its function, activated or left to be—within things, it is but a fragment. How then could it align with the great square?

Speech that suffices exhausts Dao in a day’s words; speech that does not suffice exhausts things in a day’s words. The ultimate of Dao and things cannot be borne by speech or silence—neither speech nor silence can discuss their limit.

*(Annotations within text: "Bridge-rise" denotes the swift onset of speech’s momentum; "following sequence" refers to transformations that proceed in order; "bridge-movement" signifies alternating and successive arrival.)*

Guo’s commentary:
When asked about the origin of things, some say Dao generates them. Yet yin-yang and the four seasons arise of themselves, not from nothing. All these affairs are thus said to be "acts" or "abandonments." They arise from the mutual illumination of yin-yang and the alternation of the four seasons. Beyond this lies spontaneity—who knows the cause of its mutual principles and activations? All belong to things, arising naturally, not from some power that enables them. Beyond things, nothing further exists, so knowledge cannot surpass the limits of things. Arising and ceasing occur of themselves, without origin or following. This is where discussion ends—it reaches spontaneity, hence there is no further discourse.

Jizhen said, "Dao does nothing." Jiezi said, "Dao sometimes activates, sometimes lets be"—it has the function of activating things. Yet things possess spontaneity, which no act can achieve. From this perspective, Jizhen’s words are correct. The utmost refinement and vastness arise not from action but of themselves. Things have mutual activation, which also occurs of itself. Thus, "letting be" is not the absence of things—all things arise and pass through "letting be." "Activating" makes them substantial, for they activate themselves; "letting be" makes them empty, for nothing activates them. Residing in names and realities, they are where things are; their reality is utmost emptiness. The more one seeks in speech, the more distant they become—only beyond speech and intention does one reach them.

Suddenly, they are born—we cannot prevent it; suddenly, they die—we cannot obstruct it. Near as they are in the body, we cannot see their spontaneity, yet we worry over them. These two—activating and letting be—are the world’s greatest doubts. The principles of things are endless, so their words are endless; only then do they share principle with things. To begin and end with things is to be constantly without action yet spontaneous. Dao cannot make possession exist; what exists is always spontaneous. Thus, it is said: Dao cannot be possessed, possession cannot be without Dao. Things proceed by it, so it is provisionally called Dao. How could a fragment align with the great square? Seeking Dao beyond speech and intention suffices; seeking it in speech and intention does not. The ultimate of things is always spontaneous, not residing in speech or silence. It reaches spontaneity—neither speech nor silence can discuss it.

Lü’s commentary:
Those of little knowledge call it Dao, yet once possessed, it cannot compare to Dao, hence they doubt its nonexistence. Asking whence all things arise—what governs them? The void. The sun and moon come and go, rise and set, wax and wane, illuminating and covering, ordering each other. Cold and heat, contraction and expansion, mutual generation and conquest, alternation and succession—things born between heaven and earth move with yin-yang and the four seasons. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches ride these to act; male and female, separation and union, movement and stillness follow constancy, hence there are peace and danger, fortune and misfortune, gathering and scattering. These are the names and realities that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted—none are beyond inquiry.

"Following sequence" means preceding and succeeding in order, mutually ordered without chaos. "Bridge" means riding them to act; "movement" means relying on them to cross. They activate each other without fixation. Exhaustion returns to beginning, end returns to start—yin-yang and the four seasons belong to things, not to Dao’s absence. Knowledge’s limit ends here; this is where all things arise, not where they are generated and arise. "The mother of the myriad things" is such a name.

Those who perceive Dao never lack things, so they do not follow what ceases; never possess things, so they do not trace what arises. Nameless, they emerge beyond the six directions—how could speech and knowledge reach them? Jizhen’s "letting be" follows what ceases; Jiezi’s "activating" traces what arises. The crowing of roosters and barking of dogs—these are their transformations, what they have already done. Their crowing and barking—these are their spontaneous transformations, what they will do. Utmost refinement has no within; utmost vastness has no beyond. Where then do "activating" and "letting be" reside? This is why they are not free from things—unattached to reality, they attach to emptiness. Taking names and realities as things’ residence, they do not know they never possessed them; taking namelessness and emptiness as things’ void, they do not know they never lacked them. Thus, the more they speak, the more distant they become.

Life and death cannot be avoided or halted—transcending speech and intention, though near in the body, they cannot be seen. "Activating" and "letting be" are both doubtful assumptions, not the true principle. Without end, one cannot see the beginning; without cessation, one cannot see the end. These are the principles of things, not their forms. "Activating" and "letting be" can be spoken of and conceived, yet they are not free from things, only beginning and ending—how can one see their endlessness and boundlessness?

Dao cannot be possessed because it has no possession; possession cannot be without it because it arises not from our absence. Thus, Dao is a provisional name—how can names be Dao? "Letting be" and "activating" are but fragments of things—how could they align with the great Dao? Speech that exhausts Dao is rare speech, spontaneous; speech that exhausts things is excessive speech, leading to exhaustion. Viewed from things, Dao is not things; viewed from Dao, no thing is not Dao. The ultimate of Dao and things cannot be borne by speech or silence. Speaking all one’s life without speaking—this is not speech; remaining silent all one’s life without not speaking—this is not silence. Only when discussion reaches this point does it attain its limit.

Xun’s commentary:
"Bridge-rise" means rising abruptly, separation and union. "Essence that can be noted" refers to recording the subtle. Speech’s limit is knowledge’s end—it reaches only things. Where speech ends and knowledge reaches is merely the limit of things. Only those who perceive Dao do not follow things’ end or trace things’ beginning—they return to nothingness. This is why debate ceases.

"Letting be" means nothing acts; Mencius said, "What acts without acting is Heaven." "Activating" means something causes it; Mencius said, "Acting or causing to act"—the two masters’ teachings differ thus. This is splitting hairs. The *Book of Songs* says, "The axe splits it"—splitting it refines it to no category, expands it to unencompassability. The *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of "hair, which still has category"; "The bearing of heaven has no sound, no scent"—this is the utmost. The so-called "letting be" and "activating" are not free from things and ultimately have discrepancies.

Jingchuan states: *"Letting be"* is the Buddha’s nature of spontaneity; *"activating"* is the Buddha’s nature of dependent origination. Dwelling in words clings to things. *"Activating"* and *"letting be"* both arise from the origin of speech—thus speech has its root.

**General Observations on the Text**

This essay begins with Zeyang and Wang Guo’s discussion, invoking Shan Fan’s virtue to quell the clamor of marketplace striving, guiding people toward tranquility and harmony—this is to nourish others with harmony and transform them. Its benefit to governance is profound. People often chase things and lose themselves, growing ever more distant from the old capital; yet even from afar, one gazes toward it with longing. If one could but glimpse what they once saw and hear what they once heard, how joyful would they be? Governing the self is like governing a state: when the heart-king is upright, the five officials are well-ordered; when the ruler is upright, his ministers are worthy. This is not merely advantageous for the present—it is enough to inspire transformation for generations to come. Tang had his three ministers in the past, and later Confucius arose in his wake. Like the four seasons completing the year’s work, what distinction is there between inner heaven and outer humanity?

Next, it recounts Qi and Wei breaking their alliance and resorting to arms, drawing the analogy of the *Chu Man* to admonish the bellicose rulers of the time, exposing the narrowness of their habits and the futility of their conflicts. Confucius abandoned the ant-hill debate, for its traces invited suspicion; the border official discussed the *wei*-grain, cautioning against desire and aversion as harbingers of calamity—all demonstrating the essentials of engaging the world and cultivating the self. Bo Ju lamented the condemned man, taking his misfortune as his own; to rectify others, one must first rectify oneself. Qu Yuan adapted to the times, relying on what he knew and employing what he did not—this is the method of governing the people and transforming things. Duke Ling’s posthumous title of "Ling" was determined before his death; thus, all his actions were bound by fate, as if the Creator’s calculations were entrusted to human hands.

As for the words of the village: union and separation, sameness and difference—though a horse is not a hundred parts, it is named by its standing form. The great person unites all in public; the myriad things differ, yet the Dao is complete. Like the hundred materials of the great marsh or the trees and stones of Mount Tai, some share origins but serve different uses, some differ in source but share a common end—all within the bounds of form and qi. Through transformation, the utmost principle is exhausted.

The conclusion invokes Ji Zhen and Jiezi: both *you* and *wu* are attachments, inevitably caught in the cycle of things. Only by transcending speech and silence, where the heart fuses and intent is realized, does the ultimate discourse on things reside. Thus, one knows that what can be spoken or named is not the true constant, and that the Dao cannot be carried by either speech or silence. This is clear.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: External Things**

External things cannot be relied upon—thus, Long Feng was executed, Bi Gan slain, Jizi feigned madness, and E Lai put to death. Jie and Zhou perished. No ruler fails to desire loyalty from his ministers, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust. Thus, Wu Yun’s words: *"Flowing in the Yangtze,"* while Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood concealed for three years before transforming into jade. No parent fails to desire filial piety from their child, yet filial piety does not necessarily bring love. Thus, Xiaoji grieved, and Zeng Shen mourned.

When wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal and fire are held together, they melt. When yin and yang clash, heaven and earth convulse—hence thunder and lightning. Fire burns within water, consuming the great locust tree. Such profound sorrow leaves one trapped with no escape. The *chen* and *dun* cannot fulfill their hearts, suspended between heaven and earth, restless and oppressed, sunk in distress. As profit and harm grind against one another, fire blazes fiercely, and the multitude is consumed. The moon, though constant, cannot withstand the flames. Thus, one collapses, and the Dao is exhausted.

*(Wang [Bi] says: "Those who forget attachment to the self have no adversaries in the world; then external things have no necessity to rely upon.")*

*Chen* and *dun* are read as *chong* and *rong*, signifying the unsettled qi of fear and dread, two fluids in turmoil. *Wei*, *yu*, *min*, and *men* denote oppression and gloom; *shen* and *tun* mean deep distress. *Tui* means compliance.*

Guo’s commentary:
Good and evil outcomes alike cannot be predetermined—jade turns to azure from congealed blood, the utmost of sincerity and devotion. Loyalty is not necessarily met with trust, nor filial piety with love. Thus, the perfected person responds to things without fixed intent, adapting only to what befits the moment. Thunder, lightning, water, fire, and the burning locust tree—these are what is meant by "errant movement." If one cannot transcend form, one is bound to whatever form one encounters, sinking into sorrow or joy, with no right or wrong to guide them. The more one clings, the greater the difficulty; nowhere is there a firm foothold. Thus, one cannot fulfill their aspirations, suspended between heaven and earth, striving for what is lofty yet distant. Oppression, gloom, deep distress—these are not clarity, peace, or ease. The arising of fire is inner heat. To abandon profit is to harmonize, but if profit and harm linger in the heart, that harmony is consumed. The moon cannot overcome fire: when vast, it is dim and burdened; when small, it is bright and knows its limits. Only by yielding without clinging, forgetting form and attaining self-possession, is the Dao fully realized.

Lü’s commentary:
All that is not of one’s inherent nature and destiny is an external thing. Thus, it cannot be predetermined. Longfeng and Bigan took benevolence as something to rely upon and clung to it; Elai and Jie and Zhou took the lack of benevolence as something to rely upon and clung to it—all met with inescapable ruin. If one acts with goodness or evil yet remains distant from penal measures, what need is there for such clinging? External things cannot be predetermined not only in others but also in oneself. Rulers and parents all desire the loyalty and filial piety of their ministers and children, yet loyalty is not necessarily met with trust, nor filial piety with love. The desire for ministers and children to be loyal and filial lies within oneself. If the Dao has not yet reached its culmination in yielding, even what one desires remains an external thing and cannot be predetermined—how much less so in others? Wu Yun, Chang Hong, and others clung to what they expected from others, and thus met their deaths in sorrow. Their blood turned to azure, the utmost of devotion, yet even this could not ensure the fulfillment of their desire for loyalty in others. Is this not lamentable? When wood rubs together, it ignites; when similar natures interact, they cannot avoid mutual harm. When metal guards fire, it melts; when dissimilar natures interact, they cannot avoid mutual harm. From "the errant movement of yin and yang" onward, it speaks of great calamities from which there is no escape between heaven and earth: they shake into thunder, burst into lightning, emerge from the dissimilar, or harm the similar, even giving rise to fire that consumes harmony, leaving the moon unable to prevail. The great peril lies in having a self—how can one be without sorrow? Whether bound to the similar or the dissimilar, one is doubly trapped. *Chen* and *dun* cannot fulfill their desires, their hearts suspended between heaven and earth, oppressed and gloom-ridden, sunk in deep distress, unable to find resolution. This is like the errant movement of yin and yang, the great disorder of heaven and earth. As profit and harm grind against one another, fire blazes fiercely—this is like the time of thunder, lightning, and the burning locust tree. Even the clear and luminous nature, like the moon, cannot overcome the fire that consumes harmony. All this arises from having a fixed intent. Only by yielding does one let the heart roam freely, reaching the state of no intent, where the Dao is fully realized.

Yi Du’s commentary:
*Chen* and *dun* are doubt and confusion, preventing the completion of affairs and the fulfillment of intent. When aspirations are thwarted, there is oppression; when intentions are crossed, there is gloom. When encountering circumstances, one sinks; when touching things, one is mired. As profit and harm clash in the breast, fire arises, consuming harmony, and trust is no longer whole.

Bi Xu’s commentary:
The Dao rests within, yet affairs extend without. Even what lies within oneself cannot be predetermined—how much less external things? If benevolence and righteousness were predetermined, Boyi and Shuqi would not have starved to death. If wisdom were predetermined, Bigan would not have had his heart cut out. If loyalty were predetermined, Wu Yun and Chang Hong would not have been executed. Here, the loyal and worthy, the flattering and fortunate, are doubly trapped, with no escape. Wu Yun and Chang Hong knew to serve their lords with utmost loyalty but did not foresee that a lord’s treachery would bring disaster. Xiaoji and Zeng Shen knew to serve their parents with utmost filial piety but did not foresee that parental suspicion would bring sorrow. None of them understood the principle that external things cannot be predetermined. Elai, who followed Zhou, aided a kindred tyrant yet could not escape ruin—like wood rubbing together. Longfeng, who opposed Zhou, clashed with a tyrant of opposing nature yet met execution—like metal guarding fire. When yin and yang move errantly, heaven and earth fall into great disorder. When loyalty and filial piety are met with punishment, the state collapses. Loyalty and filial piety are what ministers and children must fulfill. Yet if, by misfortune, one encounters a dark ruler or stubborn father—perverse and violent—it is like fire in water, burning the great locust tree (as in the *Huainanzi*, where an old locust tree burst into flame). If one is loyal and remonstrates, sorrow befalls the minister; if one flatters and deceives, sorrow befalls the ruler—both fall into the calamity of action. Thus, sorrow runs deep, and one’s aspirations cannot be fulfilled. Desiring to stand lofty and resplendent between heaven and earth, yet finding the world’s ways in collapse, one is stifled, mired, and drowned, with no outlet for their abilities. As loyalty and flattery grind against one another, resentment and hatred blaze daily, and human harmony is consumed. Loyalty and filial piety are like the moon; arrogance and emptiness are like fire. The moon cannot overcome fire. Only by yielding without intent, attaining perfect compliance, is the Dao fully realized.

Kou Yi’s commentary:
In the time of Jie and Zhou, the worthy and the unworthy alike suffered calamity—nothing could be predetermined.

Chang Hong was exiled and returned to Shu, where he disemboweled himself and died; the people of Shu stored his blood in a casket, and after three years, it transformed into jade. When Emperor Yuan of Jin’s grain transports failed to arrive, he executed his minister, whose blood spurted upward against the pillars. The Qi, on the pretext of the "Bright Moon Decree," killed Hulü Guang, and his blood, spilled upon the ground, could not be extinguished—all instances of this same pattern. Xiao Ji, son of Gaozong of Yin, was driven away by his stepmother; Zeng Shen fled when his father wielded a great staff while weeding—both were harmed by their filial piety. Thus, external things cannot be relied upon.

Wood, by nature, holds no fire, yet friction generates it; metal, though utterly hard, melts when exposed to flame—all attest to the unreliability of certainty. During great thunderstorms, trees may be struck and burned. Thus it is said: "Within water there is fire, which burns the great locust tree." These are all cases of yin and yang clashing in their courses, giving rise to calamity.

Xun Ben’s commentary:
When rain falls and thunder roars, it is "water containing fire." Thunderfire can also burn wood, yet only the locust tree is mentioned here because it is the wood used to kindle fire. What follows speaks of the fire within the human heart—how people, beset by deep sorrow, become trapped between two perils, as previously described. Though wood grinds against wood and metal abides with fire, they ultimately cannot escape, for the heart cannot transcend considerations of gain and loss. Like insects stirring in hibernation before fully awakening, affairs fail to come to fruition. When matters do not succeed, the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, stifled, repressed, restless, and sunk in stagnation—afflicted by these manifold ills. As gain and harm grind against one another, the fire within the heart blazes ever more fiercely, ceaselessly, like the fire within water, flaring for a time. The masses are all consumed by this, their innate harmony scorched. The moon, by nature yin, is likewise transformed into fire, unable to withstand its proliferation. The subtlety of Heaven’s principle cannot contend with the blazing flames of human desire, and thus the Dao is lost in perfect compliance.

Hong Mai’s commentary:
The annotation states: "Great yet benighted, one is burdened by many entanglements; small yet enlightened, one knows one’s place." Zizhan’s citation instead reads: "Guo Xiang believed that being great yet benighted is inferior to being small yet enlightened—how vulgar!" This saying should be revised to: "The moon cannot overcome the candle." That which is bright in great matters must be dim in small ones. The moon can illuminate heaven and earth yet cannot light the tip of a hair—this is why it cannot overcome fire. Yet in the end, does fire overcome the moon, or does the moon overcome fire? I recall Zhu Yuanzheng’s *Pingzhou Ketan*, which records that Wang Jiefu, while in the Classics Bureau as a reviser, encountered the phrase "holding up a candle" in Buddhist scriptures, where it speaks of the "Brightness of the Sun, Moon, and Lamp Buddha." He asked, "How can lamplight compare to the sun and moon?" Lü Jifu replied: "The sun blazes by day, the moon blazes by night—does the lamp blaze as well?"

The sun and moon, though vast in their reach, serve without distinction where their light does not extend. Jiefu greatly approved of this. In my humble opinion, the essence of *Zhuangzi* lies in likening the human heart to the moon—serene, empty, and still—yet when assailed by profit and harm, a fire blazes forth to consume its harmony, and thus the moon cannot overcome it. This is not a matter of brightness or dimness.

*Supplementary Ink*:
Among the qi of the Five Phases, fire is the most fierce. The *Cantong Qi* states: "Wood and fire are companions; fire, though yin in root, is yang in abode, dwelling in wood. When stirred, it arises—yet in doing so, it injures its mother." Thus, when wood grates against wood, it ignites. The *Yinfu Jing* says: "Fire is born of wood, yet when calamity erupts, it must conquer"—this is the principle. Even metal, though utterly hard, when held with fire, is melted by it. If yin and yang become entangled and pent-up without release, then thunder strikes, lightning surges, and fire rises from water to burn the great locust tree. The locust is the wood of the East, which in its old age gives birth to fire. In the human body, this is what is called the "fire of the Five Emotions," which cannot be directly suppressed.

Therefore, those who embody the Dao are empty, still, tranquil, and desireless, practicing non-action—thus the fire of the Five Emotions is all at once subdued. Profit and harm do not disturb their hearts, and life and death bring no change to their selves. The common people are not so: unaware that external things cannot be relied upon, they clash and grind against one another in the vortex of profit and harm. Thereby, the fire within grows ever greater, and the harmony of heaven is consumed.

The moon, after all, cannot overcome fire. The moon is water, and water cannot overcome fire—this aligns with the medical notion that "one water cannot overcome five fires."

Zhuang Zhou was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The Marquis said, "Very well. I will soon receive the taxes from my fief and will lend you three hundred gold pieces—will that suffice?" Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and replied, "On my way here yesterday, I heard a cry from the middle of the road. I looked and saw a crucian carp in the rut of a wagon wheel."

Zhuang Zhou asked it, saying, "Crucian carp, where have you come from?"
It replied, "I am a minister of the waves from the Eastern Sea. Might you have a dou or sheng of water to keep me alive?"
Zhuang Zhou said, "Very well. I am about to journey south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue to channel the waters of the Western River to welcome you—would that suffice?"
The crucian carp flushed with anger and replied, "I have lost my accustomed element and have nowhere to abide. A dou or sheng of water would suffice to keep me alive for now. Yet you speak of this—you might as well have sought me earlier in the dried-fish market."

*(The *Shuo Yuan* records the Marquis of the River as the Marquis of Wei, and "gold from the fief" as taxes from the domain. *Guang Ya* glosses "crucian" as *ji*. "Minister of the waves" is akin to a water official. "Accustomed element" refers to water. "For now" implies "if that were so, I could live." "Dried-fish market" refers to dried fish. The "kings of Wu and Yue" may be a scribal error for "local lord.")*

Guo Xiang’s commentary: *"To speak of what accords with principle, no matter how small—if it is not fitting, even greatness is of no benefit."*
Lü Huiqing’s commentary: *"Zhuangzi’s borrowing of grain makes clear that those who nourish life seek only to sustain the body and do not pursue excess."*

Ren Gongzi fashioned a great hook with a thick black line and fifty steers as bait. He crouched upon Mount Gui, cast his rod into the Eastern Sea, and fished day after day for a year without catching anything. Then, a great fish took the bait, dragging the massive hook down as it plunged, thrashing its fins and raising waves like mountains. The sea churned, the sound like thunder, and the spectacle terrified all within a thousand *li*. Ren Gongzi landed the fish, sliced it into strips, and dried it. From the Zhe River eastward to north of Mount Cangwu, none did not feast upon it. Thereafter, those of mediocre talent—peddlers of shallow rhetoric—all marveled and spread the tale.

Yet those who brandish their rods and chase minnows in ditches, guarding only the tiniest of catches, find it difficult to land a great fish. Those who adorn petty words to seek high office are far from true attainment. Thus, one who has never heard of Ren Gongzi’s manner of conduct is far indeed from being able to navigate the world.

The great black fishing line is vast indeed; mediocre talents assess others’ abilities. "Recited sayings" refer to well-rehearsed discourses. A "fine line" is a slender fishing cord. "County commands" resemble reward proclamations, seeking compliance with their stipulated standards.

Guo’s annotation: *As aspirations differ, so too do the proper scales for navigating the world—each suited to its own measure.*
Lü’s annotation: *Ren’s fishing illustrates how those who steer the world set their minds on great accomplishments, never seeking immediate results.*

Dubi’s note: *The castrated ox—when the great fish devours it, its might shakes a thousand* li*, showing that those with far-reaching minds may achieve late, yet their impact startles the world, and all share in their blessing. Later generations marvel and spread the word, for those who realize their ambitions across the world leave names for posterity—such were Yi Yin and the Grand Duke.*

Xuxi’s note: *Both passages invert external things to emphasize: the first speaks of the scholar’s fate, sometimes confined to the smallest measure; the second speaks of the scholar’s aspiration, which must await boundless opportunity—both are valid. Circumstances arise by chance, not to be judged by scale. When minnows are the catch, a pint or peck is great, and Ren Gongzi’s methods seem trivial.*

The Confucians built their households on poetry and ritual; the great Confucians proclaimed: "The east is stirring!"—what of affairs? The lesser Confucian replied: "I’ve yet to untie my skirt and jacket, but a pearl lies in my mouth." Poetry indeed contains this: *"The green-green wheat grows on the hillside slope; / Alive, you give nothing; dead, why clench a pearl?"* They seized his temples, pressed his whiskers, and with a metal mallet pried his jaw, carefully parting his cheeks to spare the pearl within.

Guo’s annotation: *Poetry and ritual are the traces left by former kings. If the person is unworthy, the Way cannot operate in vain—thus Confucians who misuse them for deceit prove that such traces cannot be relied upon.*
Lü’s annotation: *Petty Confucians wield the words of former kings to serve their own injustice—how do they differ from this?*

When Lao Laizi’s disciple went out to gather firewood and encountered Confucius, he returned and reported: "There is a man over there with a tall forehead and a hunched back, his ears set far back. His gaze seems to survey the Four Seas—I know not whose son he is." Lao Laizi said: "That is Qiu. Summon him." When Confucius arrived, Lao Laizi said: "Qiu, shed your bodily pride and your cultivated demeanor—only then can you be called a gentleman." Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression troubled. He asked: "May I advance in my work?" Lao Laizi replied: *"One who cannot bear the wounds of a single generation yet courts calamity for ten thousand ages—is this not obstinate poverty, or perhaps a lack of broader vision? Kindness that feigns joy to mask obstinacy becomes a lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus: ears drawn by fame, bound by shared afflictions, praising Yao while condemning Jie—yet it is better to suspend judgment and close off such praise, for to act without error is impossible. The sage proceeds with deliberation to initiate affairs, ensuring success in every endeavor—how could it be otherwise? Your carriage is laden, yet you remain proud to the end."*

*Lao Laizi was a man of Chu. "Hunched back" may refer to the head or the back. "Afflictions" denotes troubles. "Deliberation" means unhurried composure.*

Though one proceeds with deliberation to initiate affairs and achieves success, still their traces bring harm for a hundred generations—how much worse when one acts with pride in good conduct and ceaselessly bears its burden?

**Guo’s Annotation:**
This describes superiors hastening subordinates. Yet when one steps back, stoops forward, and peers upward like a marionette, appearing as though managing another’s affairs—this is to say, Confucius could relinquish form and abandon knowledge, thus being deemed a noble person. He bowed and withdrew, receiving instruction.

When he asked, *"Might my work be advanced?"* it was a hypothetical question to prompt Lao Laizi to clarify its impossibility. If one acts for a single generation, the traces become a calamity for ten thousand ages—thus it cannot be taken lightly.

*"Is this not obstinate poverty, or perhaps a lack of broader vision?"* This means that if one simply follows the people’s nature, they will not be impoverished in virtue but will naturally possess vision, with nothing beyond their reach.

*"Kindness that feigns joy"*—without kindness, one incurs disgrace. Yet kindness cannot be prolonged, so a single act of kindness becomes a lifelong disgrace.

*"The conduct of the common people advances thus"*—this means they are easily swayed, so one must not rashly bestow kindness upon them. *"Bound by shared afflictions"* refers to their mutual advancement.

*"Close off"* means to block. *"To act without error"*—following the Way preserves wholeness; stillness ensures correctness.

Affairs do not stray from their root, so success is achieved in every endeavor. Pride cannot be borne, so one abandons it and does not claim possession.

The Lü commentary states: Those who study Confucius in this world cling to his outward traces but fail to grasp his inner heart—hence Zhuangzi’s critique. From the self-cultivating superior man to the inferior who seeks the sage by appearance, all are those who, in their personal conduct, take pride in their own actions. Yet to display knowledge in one’s demeanor is not the abundant virtue of one who feigns foolishness.

Great disorder arose between Yao and Shun. If one cannot bear the harm of a single generation and thus acts to save it, this is to court calamity for ten thousand generations. Is the enterprise of abundance inherently impoverished? Or does it lack the strategy to reach its goal? Neither is the case.

Kindness is not great wisdom, yet to pursue it with joyful zeal courts lifelong disgrace—even this, one should refrain from doing. But when people mutually draw one another by reputation, bind themselves by cliques, and advance together, this is the conduct of the common people. How could a noble person who embodies the Dao be like this?

It is because they cannot utterly abandon sagely knowledge and the dual pursuit of good and evil—both of which court calamity for ten thousand generations. The Dao is non-action, yet to turn away from it is to harm the Dao; to act without non-action is to stray into error. Where is there anything worthy of esteem or praise?

To be as cautious as one crossing a river in winter, as wary as one fearing one’s four neighbors—this is what is meant by hesitation. How can one claim possession of it, believing that without pride it cannot be attained?

Following the root—cultivating the highest brings growth to the body, while hastening to the lowest makes it narrow. This is what is meant by "the waist and below fall short of Yu by three inches." The ends are guarded; the back is slightly hunched. From behind, the ears are visible, but when facing forward, they cannot be seen. To be self-important is to hold oneself with restraint, adorning one’s outward appearance to seek recognition—this is reckless abandon, heedless of consequences. To recklessly court calamity for ten thousand generations is to believe oneself right without regard for the disaster left to posterity.

Or rather, is it that you are truly impoverished and thus act thus? Have you lost your wisdom and foresight, failing to consider this? *Hui* (compliance) is to follow others’ wishes to foster affection, unaware that it courts calamity for ten thousand generations. Thus it is said: "Compliance makes delight its recklessness." Though you take this as recklessness, it remains a lifelong disgrace, no more than the conduct of ordinary people advancing together. They lead one another by reputation, bind themselves by obscurity—this is *hunbi* (obscuration). Confucius often praised Yao and blamed Jie, yet his teaching was: "Rather than praise Yao and blame Jie, it is better to forget both praise and blame." To turn against this principle is nothing but harm; to act without non-action is nothing but error.

The sage acts with hesitation, as if compelled by necessity, and thus always succeeds. How can one claim to possess it, believing that without pride it cannot be attained? Beware lest one persist in such conduct.

**Supplementary Note:**
Is it that your fate is truly meant to be impoverished? Or have you lost your foresight, failing to consider this? The Master’s actions suffice to bring hardship, yet he accepts it without change—is this his destined lot, or does his wisdom fall short of considering this?

In the middle of the night, the Lord of Song dreamed of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate, who said: "I come from the Zailu Abyss. I was sent by the Clear River as an emissary to the River Lord, but I was caught by the fisherman Yu Qiu." The Lord awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said: "This is the spirit *gui*."

The Lord asked: "Is there a fisherman named Yu Qiu?" His attendants replied: "There is." The Lord said: "Summon Yu Qiu to court tomorrow." The next day, Yu Qiu appeared before the Lord. The Lord asked: "What did you catch?" Yu Qiu replied: "I caught a white *gui* in my net, five feet in circumference." The Lord said: "Present your *gui*." When the *gui* arrived, the Lord wavered between killing it and sparing it. His mind unsettled, he divined: "Killing the *gui* will bring good fortune." He then carved the *gui* seventy-two times, leaving no crack unprobed.

Confucius said: "The spirit *gui* could appear in the Lord’s dream but could not evade Yu Qiu’s net. It knew how to survive seventy-two probings without a single crack but could not escape the disaster of having its entrails carved out. Thus, knowledge has its limitations, and even spirits have their inadequacies. Though one possesses the greatest wisdom and ten thousand men conspire, fish do not fear nets but fear pelicans. Abandon petty knowledge, and great knowledge becomes clear; forsake goodness, and one becomes good of itself."

A newborn babe, without a teacher of stone, can speak—this is because it dwells among those who can speak.

Guo's commentary: "The insufficiency of spiritual knowledge is thus. Only one who abides in stillness, dwelling in what they can do without scheming outwardly, remains whole. Not employing one’s own knowledge but using the schemes of the multitude is like a net without intent—thus it catches fish. Petty knowledge is self-serving; great knowledge accords with things. Forsake goodness, and goodness arises without contrivance—like the newborn babe, who speaks without a teacher of stone, dwelling among those who can speak, not straining to learn from them."

Lü's commentary: "The *gui* possessed knowledge yet could not avoid calamity; it had spirit yet could not evade the net. This is what it means to have limitations and inadequacies. Those who follow the Dao thus abandon sagacity and discard knowledge. Though one possesses the greatest wisdom and ten thousand men conspire, the few cannot overcome the many—this is the nature of things. Fish do not fear nets but fear pelicans; pelicans have knowledge, nets do not. Thus, abandon petty knowledge, and great knowledge becomes clear; forsake goodness, and one becomes good of itself. How then should a ruler govern? The newborn babe, without a teacher of stone, can speak—if one relies on knowledge to dwell among the people, how can one make them unaware? "

Xun's text: "Though one possesses the greatest wisdom, it is not equal to consulting the multitude. Fish do not fear nets but fear pelicans—this is the fish’s ignorance. For the fish know that pelicans can harm them, yet nets emerge from what they do not perceive. How much less do they know that the harm of pelicans is small, while the harm of nets is great! One who can abandon petty knowledge and let great knowledge become clear, who does not flaunt their goodness yet becomes good of itself—like the newborn babe, who has no teacher of stone to instruct them yet can speak of itself, dwelling among those who can speak. Though one possesses knowledge, one should still consult the multitude."

Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi: "Your words are useless."
Zhuangzi replied: "Only when one knows the useless can one speak of the useful. The earth is not narrow or small, yet what man uses of it is only enough to stand upon. If one were to dig beneath their feet to the Yellow Springs, would there still be use?"
Hui Shi said: "It would be useless."
Zhuangzi said: "Then the usefulness of the useless is also clear."

Guo's commentary: "The sage responds from within, acting when the occasion arises, expressing outwardly to unfold the circumstances. When circumstances unfold, affairs are resolved; when the outer is clear, the inner is employed—this is the principle of mutual necessity."

Lü's commentary: "The world deems those with knowledge and ability as useful, and those without as useless, yet does not know that the useless is the source of the useful. From the perspective of the Dao, what the world calls knowledge and ability—how small is its use, no more than the space a foot occupies upon the earth!"

Zhuangzi said: "Is there one who can roam yet does not roam? Is there one who cannot roam yet roams? The aspirations of those who flee and the conduct of those who sever ties—alas, are these not the burden of the utmost knowledge and profound virtue? Falling and not turning back, rushing like fire and not looking back—though they may for a time be ruler and minister to each other, with the change of generations, they will have no means to hold each other in contempt. Thus it is said: The perfected person does not linger in their conduct. Those who honor the past and belittle the present are the way of scholars. Yet observing the present age through the lens of the Xi Wei clan—who can remain undisturbed by its waves? Only the perfected person can roam in the world without bias, follow others without losing themselves. They teach without instruction, respond to others’ intentions without opposition."

Guo's commentary: "What one’s nature can do, one cannot but do; what one’s nature cannot do, one cannot force. The sage, without constraint, is thus the same as all things—all attain without knowing how they attain. If one’s virtue is not profoundly thick, one cannot bear their aspirations and trust their unique abilities. Falling and rushing like fire—this speaks of what people desire, not shunning right or wrong, life or death, in pursuit of it. With the change of generations, they have no means to hold each other in contempt—this is how they are equal as people. The perfected person does not linger in their conduct, following whatever they encounter, thus moving in accord with transformation. The past is not inherently honored, the present not inherently belittled, yet scholars honor the past and belittle the present, losing their source. Following the times and adapting to things—this is leveling and blending. The perfected person responds to affairs as they arise, taking what is at hand as the norm. Thus it is said: they roam in the world without bias, for they have no self—what self is there to lose? Thus it is said: they follow others without losing themselves. Teaching arises from their nature, not from learning. Thus it is said: they teach without instruction. They respond to others’ intentions naturally, so the myriad things each attain their self. Thus it is said: they respond to intentions without opposition."

Lü's commentary: "Liezi said: The utmost roaming is not knowing where one goes; the utmost observation is not knowing what one sees—all things roam, all things observe. This is what I call roaming, what I call observing. Zhuangzi’s roaming is like this. The one who has attained the Dao finds nothing that is not the Dao—thus all things roam, all things observe. Though they may wish not to roam, they cannot but do so. One who has not attained the Dao, though they may wish to roam, cannot do so. The aspirations of those who flee follow custom to be humble; the conduct of those who sever ties departs from the world to be lofty—neither is the burden of the utmost knowledge and profound virtue. Blinded by one corner, they fall and do not turn back, rush like fire and do not look back. Though they may for a time be ruler and minister to each other, with the change of generations, they will have no means to hold each other in contempt—their deviation from the Dao is the same. One with utmost knowledge and profound virtue is neither humble in fleeing nor lofty in severing ties, following only the Dao. Thus the perfected person does not linger in their conduct, leaving no traces. If one honors the past and belittles the present, observing the present age through the lens of the Xi Wei clan, their heart will be shallow—who can remain level and undisturbed by its waves? Only the perfected person can roam in the world without bias, follow others without losing themselves, teaching in accord with others, not through learning. Understanding their intentions and responding to them—how can there be opposition? This is the perfected person’s roaming."

Jingchuan: "No relationship is stricter than that of ruler and minister; with the change of generations, it alters—how much more so for other principles! This is merely used to illustrate that the perfected person does not linger in their conduct. Not lingering in conduct is like the Buddhist who does not stay three nights under the same mulberry tree—this is the idea."

Fumo: "‘They teach without instruction, respond to intentions without opposition’—what the world calls teaching, though they do not deign to learn it, they still respond to its intentions without opposing it. What is opposed is external words; not opposing means not externalizing them. Why? Worldly and transcendent dharmas are not two things. If one selects and rejects, then one is not roaming in the world without bias or following others without losing oneself. From this perspective, what Zhuangzi calls roaming is certainly not the learning of those who cut themselves off from things and flee the world. There is a way of following and not losing oneself—this is the utmost knowledge and profound virtue."

Fang Sishan: "Those who can roam drown without ceasing; those who cannot roam depart without returning. This ‘roaming’ is roaming in the world, not carefree wandering. Thus, one becomes either dissolute or utterly severed—falling and never returning is the flaw of severance, racing like fire without regard is the flaw of dissolution. When two men become ruler and minister, each values himself and devalues the other. Judged across eras, both are equally unfit for the task of utmost knowledge and profound virtue. Therefore, the perfected person roams skillfully, neither altering with the world nor losing himself, without distinction between past and present, self and other. Why? The past is not necessarily worthy of reverence, nor the present necessarily base. Viewing emperors from the vantage of sovereigns, emperors become base; viewing kings from the vantage of emperors, kings become base in turn. Past and present rise and fall in succession—who can avoid being swept along? This is why the perfected person roams in the world without bias."

Eyes penetrating are clarity; ears penetrating are acuity; nose penetrating is keen scent; mouth penetrating is savor; mind penetrating is knowledge; knowledge penetrating is virtue. The Dao does not desire obstruction—obstruction causes choking, and choking without end leads to stumbling, which gives rise to manifold harms. That sentient beings rely on breath is not Heaven’s fault. Heaven bores through them day and night without cease; it is humans who block their apertures. The womb has layered chambers, the mind has celestial roaming. If a room lacks emptiness, mother and daughter-in-law quarrel; if the mind lacks celestial roaming, the six senses contend. The great forests and towering mountains are good for people—yet the numinous is not as potent as virtue overflowing, fame overflowing.

Fierce scheming arises from cunning; contention emerges from knowledge; firewood is born of guarding office and attending to affairs. When the rains of the multitude’s proper spring arrive in season, grasses and trees burst forth in vigorous growth—hoeing and weeding begin then. Yet more than half of those who tend to the planting of grasses and trees do not understand why this is so.

When passage should be open but is blocked, principles cannot flow freely and trample one another. "Life arises"—all roots that sprout do so without awareness, and this too is called "relying on breath." "Proper" means fitting; breath does not depend on knowledge, for it is through knowledge that one loses fittingness. Losing fittingness leads to obstruction, and obstruction arises from knowledge relying on breath—breath does not rely on knowledge. Yet the use of knowledge and desire is governed by humans, not by an inescapable mandate.

"Heaven bores through without cease"—the circulation of principle has its constant movement. "Humans block their apertures"—without sincerity, they fail to follow Heaven, and their apertures remain closed. "Layered chambers" means spaciousness; "celestial roaming" means wandering without attachment.

Conflict arises where contention dwells; "usurpation" means rebellion. The finest of great forests and mountains follow the natural principle, which finds its expression through things to achieve free flow. Virtue overflows—when reputation is lofty, profit runs deep, so those who cultivate virtue exceed what is fitting. Fame overflows—when one restrains violence, one’s reputation surpasses their virtue.

"Hasty" means urgency; "deliberation" follows haste—only after urgency does one examine their plans. "Wisdom emerges"—when contention is resolved through equanimity, wisdom becomes unnecessary. "Obstruction" means blockage; "official duties" are fulfilled—since what the multitude deems fitting varies, official duties are established. When plants and trees grow, and hoes and sickles are prepared, the arising of all affairs has its cause. "Arriving at growth without awareness"—affairs arise from principle, so one remains unaware of their unfolding.

Lü’s Commentary:
When a person’s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth are not obstructed by sounds, sights, scents, and flavors, they become keen of hearing, clear of sight, discerning of taste, and wise in virtue. When virtue is obstructed, it chokes and fails to flow; when obstruction grows severe, things trample one another. Gain and loss wage war in the breast—how long before they lead to ruin? This is the affliction of yin and yang, the source from which all harm arises.

All sentient beings live when breath abides and die when breath departs. The ebb and flow of breath follow the cycles of midnight and noon, moving left and right in accord with yin and yang, ever in communion with primordial qi. Thus, Heaven bores through without cease, its circulation even and unchanging, never waning. Yet humans, by allowing sounds, sights, scents, and flavors to block their apertures, prevent this flow—hence their decline rather than flourishing.

If one can embody tranquility, emptiness, and non-attachment, true qi will follow, the body will align, and harmony with Heaven will arrive. Thus, the womb holds layered chambers, and filth cannot invade; the mind roams freely, and affairs cannot disturb. The room must have emptiness to differ from the mundane. Without proper hierarchy, mother and daughter-in-law will clash in conflict.

The mind must have celestial roaming to rise above the dust—otherwise, the six apertures will trample and rebel against one another. The six apertures are the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and the mind’s knowing. If one truly understands what is meant by "celestial roaming," though they wander in the human world, the myriad things will not disturb their heart, and their spirit will be sufficient to overcome all. Why seek refuge in great forests and mountains?

Supreme virtue does not claim virtue, so it has no name. When there is a name, virtue overflows; when one acts violently yet conceals nothing, fame overflows. Thus, plans cannot but be examined in haste, and wisdom cannot but emerge from contention.

Those who contend over firewood cannot but give rise to strife—is it by guarding this that one attains fulfillment? The many preferences for sounds, colors, scents, and flavors barricade the outer self, while thoughts, worries, knowledge, and schemes barricade the inner, yet they fail to communicate with one another.

For those who practice the Dao, governing the heart means tending to it before disorder arises—no different from how grasses and trees flourish in their natural vigor before the hoe and sickle begin their work.

】Following the root:【
Choking and gasping, trampling and treading—those whose feet are unsteady in walking are as if trodden upon by others. The three yin meridians of the foot all originate in the toes and ascend along the throat; when perverse qi travels through the channels and collaterals, choking becomes unceasing, and foot ailments arise. Once foot ailments manifest, a host of harms follow—not merely choking or trampling. This illustrates how the Dao must not be obstructed; obstruction breeds such afflictions.

Abundance and flourishing—it is also said that sentient beings rely on the free flow of breath to sustain this body. When breath fails to prevail, it is not heaven’s doing; heaven endows humans with perforated orifices through which qi circulates day and night without cease. It is people who block their own apertures.

Descending—within the human body, breath always ascends from below; if it descends without rising, death follows. This analogy of breath serves to illustrate the heart.

*Làng* (阆) sounds like *xiàn* (限): layered thresholds, layered doorways. The womb’s emptiness, its passageways, resemble a chamber’s layered thresholds. Just as the womb has layered thresholds, the heart has celestial roaming. If a chamber lacks emptiness, mother and daughter-in-law will be cramped before one’s eyes. For when a chamber has space, mother and daughter-in-law may dwell in ease; when the heart lacks celestial roaming, the six apertures will vie and seize. But if the heart possesses its natural, unfettered roaming, emotions and desires will not contend. It is like those who admire great forests and mountains—only because their daily minds are narrow and their spirits insufficient to overcome them. If one’s spirit were sufficient to prevail, why would they admire them?

Virtue resides within, yet overflows due to fame; fame, though inherently unmanifest, overflows through ostentatious display. *Overflow* is like water spilling beyond its bounds. Schemes, in their essence, involve no deep calculation, yet the desire to entice others causes them to linger and deepen.

*Chái* (柴) refers to the meaning of "palisade" in the *Heaven and Earth* chapter: the places where officials station and guard, erecting palisades for defense. Palisades are not originally established; they arise from what officials must guard. Matters, in their essence, lack fixity—yet when they align with what the multitude deems fitting, decisions are made and actions taken, all losing their spontaneity. It is like the season of spring rains, when grasses and trees naturally flourish in exuberance; to then wield the hoe and sickle is to harm their growth and violate their nature.

*Dào* (倒) means *to reverse*.

】 *Limited Insight* 【

The ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and heart—capable of unimpeded communication—all arise from thorough knowing as virtue’s accomplishment. If virtue does not thread through them, these five become obstructed, causing much harm. All living things possess breath to circulate the qi of the entire body and harmonize with the concord of Heaven and Earth. To act in ways that obstruct or block this is to depart from the Dao of the primordial qi’s free flow. Primordial qi permeates all things without cease; where decline and decay occur, it is only that humans, through the six senses, reverse and block its apertures.

Animals rely on breath, plants on roots—each depends on what sustains its life. Great forests and towering mountains appear excellent to humans because, accustomed to narrow and cramped views, they suddenly behold vast, open, and luminous expanses, and their hearts necessarily delight in them. Yet this is the spirit failing to overcome things, instead being overcome by them. Mountains, forests, and riverbanks may bring me joy, but before it is complete, sorrow follows. Thus, do things truly benefit humans? Does delight in things truly bring joy? Only because external admiration creates internal deficiency: valuing one thing means slighting another.

Reputation is a public vessel and cannot be taken in excess. Thus, the emergence of reputation marks the loss of virtue. To admire reputation is to lose it again. When both are lost, one hastily devises schemes, and knowing arises in contention—this is the proof of the multitude of harms. Even those who can maintain integrity suffer from rigid obstruction, unable to adapt. As for the earlier saying that grasses and trees, though uprooted, revive with rain—this is their nature, yet people remain unaware.

Human life depends on breath; if it is made to descend without vigor, how could there be no way to support, protect, and replenish it? The key lies only in knowing the right time.

】 *Ink Traces* 【

When the eyes are obscured by forms, they do not see clearly; when the ears are confused by sounds, they do not hear keenly; when the nose is seized by scents, it does not discern; when the mouth is sated with flavors, it does not savor; when the heart is stirred by perception, it does not know. Knowing that involves discrimination is not the knowing of virtue. These six senses and their six dusts must be thoroughly purified to restore their original, inherent numinous awareness. Yet at the gates of the six senses, each is an obstruction. Though one may apply the word "thorough" in a few places, in truth, to understand one is to understand all; where one is thorough, all are thorough.

Thus the Dao does not desire obstruction. If not thorough, one is naturally obstructed by external things. Like a person choking: if the obstruction persists, distress follows, and from distress arise the multitude of harms. The tracks of distress are like feet sinking into mud. When the human spirit’s emptiness is obstructed by things, it becomes mired in desire, unable to extricate itself. Those who preserve it are few indeed.

All living things depend on this principle of generation and breath. Now, those who preserve it are few, so their generation and breath become faint and weak, not flourishing. This lack of flourishing is not Heaven’s fault. Heaven’s piercing of them continues day and night without cease; it is humans who block their own apertures. For this luminous essence constantly shines forth: with ears, one naturally hears; with eyes, one naturally sees—this is what Heaven pierces day and night without pause. It is like a room with apertures: sunlight naturally pierces through, yet humans block their own apertures, causing light to seem diminished or obscured, unseen.

】 *Reflections on Goodness* 【

Humans rely on breath to live, and breath relies on emptiness to reign. Emptiness is where the Dao gathers. Thus, when empty, the six senses serve me; when not empty, the six senses become my thieves. When they serve, the spirit is stored; when they thieve, the spirit is lost. Those who lose within inevitably seek fulfillment without. Thus virtue overflows into reputation, reputation overflows into display, schemes arise from restlessness, knowing arises from contention, palisades arise from defense, and official matters arise from the multitude’s approval. All these occur when things overcome the spirit and thieves assail emptiness.

"Spring rains in their season" refers to timely rain and sunshine. For things that rely on breath, when the time comes, they grow. Hoes and sickles cannot suppress them—why? Because Heaven’s compliance is at work. When Heaven complies, what is reversed can be planted; compared to wandering with Heaven, what is pierced suffers no obstruction. Thus, those who skillfully nurture things guard their roots; those who skillfully nurture life guard their breath. This is why the perfected value wandering with Heaven.

Stillness can mend illness, plucking can rest old age, tranquility can halt haste. Though such are the tasks of the toiling, they are not what the at-ease ever inquire about. What startles the world is what the sage never inquires about; what startles the age is what the spirit-person never inquires about; what startles the state is what the worthy never inquires about; what aligns with the times is what the petty person never inquires about.

】 *Guo’s Commentary* 【

Mending illness does not mean being free from illness; resting old age does not mean being free from aging; halting haste does not mean being free from haste. Such are still matters of toil, so the at-ease transcend and disregard them. The spirit-person is the sage: "sage" speaks of the external, "spirit" of the internal. Their courses and renunciations each have their place; their heights and depths each have their rank, so they do not inquire of one another.

】 *Lü’s Commentary* 【

"Stillness can mend illness" to "tranquility can halt haste"—these are ancient arts of the Dao. Though such exist, movement precedes stillness, complexity precedes plucking, blazing precedes extinction, disturbance precedes tranquility. These are spoken for the toiling to ease their labor. The at-ease have never moved—why would they need stillness? They have never been complex—why would they need plucking? They have never blazed—why would they need extinction? They have never been disturbed—why would they need tranquility? Thus they do not inquire.

Only those with virtue attain ease; the at-ease encompass the spirit and the sage. The spirit-person and the sage differ in their traces; the worthy and the gentleman differ in their talents; the gentleman and the petty person differ in their adherence to righteousness or profit.

**】Brush Notes【**

The old explanation of *zì* (眦) holds it to be an eye ailment. Xu Xi said: "Stillness is no medicine." Yet it may remedy the eye that sees nothing—though afflicted, it can rest and age without knowing *zì*. This is indeed a technique of the life-nurturing school.

According to the *Zhen’gao*: "At times, press the four corners of the eyes with the hands until the light appears clearly—this is the way to examine the spirit of the eyes. Prolonged practice reveals the signs of a hundred spirits and the omens of aged forms emerging at the eye corners. Parting the *zì* and smoothing wrinkles can bathe the countenance of age."

**Extended【Practice】**

At the Yan Gate, when a parent died, one was ennobled as an official teacher for grieving to the point of emaciation. Half of his fellow townsmen grieved themselves to death. Yao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You fled from it. Tang offered it to Wu Guang, and Wu Guang raged against him. Ji Tuo, hearing of this, led his disciples to crouch by the Kuǎn River. The feudal lords mourned him for three years, whereupon Shentu Di threw himself into the river.

【Yan Gate was the name of a city gate in Song; *bó* means to collapse, to fall prostrate.】

Guo’s commentary: "To revere reward and filial piety is to stray far from the true. This is the excess of esteeming worthiness—its waves unsettle the nature, leading even to drowning in the river."

Lü’s commentary: "The official teacher’s encouragement led his townsmen to grieve themselves to death; Xu You’s flight led his followers to drown in the river. Such are the harms of following traces."

The *quan* is used to catch fish—once the fish is caught, the *quan* is discarded. The snare is used to catch hares—once the hare is caught, the snare is discarded. Words are used to convey meaning—once the meaning is grasped, the words are discarded. How might I find one who has discarded words, that I may speak with them?

【The *quan* is an aromatic herb used to bait fish—alternatively, it refers to a fish trap. The snare is a device for trapping hares by their feet, hence called a "hoof-trap."】

Guo’s commentary: "When it comes to the two sages, they had no intent, and thus nothing to say at all."

Lü’s commentary: "Zhuangzi feared that later generations, grasping his words, would lose sight of what lay behind them. Thus he concluded with the analogy of the *quan* and the snare, urging scholars to forget words and delve into their meaning."

General Observations in My Humble View:
This chapter begins by weighing the relative importance of inner and outer, clarifying the closeness or distance between self and things. What lies outside is bound to external things and cannot be relied upon; what lies within arises from the self, and seeking it yields attainment. Yet most people devote themselves to external pursuits, and when they fail, resentment and blame follow. Thus, he establishes this discourse to dispel their confusion. Even loyalty and filial piety—virtues that define one’s conduct—cannot guarantee the understanding of ruler or kin, for they are external matters sought from within. How much less can one expect to attain what is external by pursuing it externally? From this, we know that within the nature and destiny of the self, there is nothing that is not the Dao. To awaken to it is to preserve one’s nature and destiny; outside of this, nothing is certain, and those who cling to externals lose themselves. Only by embracing effortless non-action and merging obscurely with the Dao can one escape the dual pitfalls of entanglement. When Zhuangzi borrowed grain and used the analogy of the drying cart tracks and stranded fish, he showed that bestowing kindness must be timely. When Master Ren cast his great hook and scorned the petty catch, he made clear that the Dao must be sought in the grand. Scholars who study poetry and ritual may begin with upright intentions, yet once swayed by material desires, they may violate prohibitions and harm moral transformation without compunction—worse than the unlearned, who at least retain some fear and abide by their allotted place. All this stems from...

The ruler who governs the people through sagely wisdom for too long will see cunning leaders among the people usurp that sagely wisdom. Again, Zhuangzi used the parable of Lao Lai and Confucius—when the world’s praise and blame ceased of themselves, this embodied the principle that “through my non-action, the people transform themselves.” The white minnow can perceive the dream but cannot escape the net, showing that the numinous does not make itself numinous; only then does one know there is a numinous beyond the numinous. This illustrates that relying on knowledge to escape calamity is not as free from trouble as forgetting knowledge altogether.

Next, he shows that only when one knows the uselessness of knowledge can one begin to speak of its use, with these ideas mutually illuminating each other. He further states that one who can roam does so by roaming the mind in tranquility—this roaming is internal. The preceding passages are all parables; here, he invokes Zhuangzi directly to clarify the chapter’s fundamental intent: to guide scholars beyond the entanglements of external things and into the realm of emptiness and penetration, where the spirit fuses and the mind is at ease, unbound in any direction—then the Dao is near.

Yet as worldly habits grow baser, people often roam where they should not, rushing headlong into ruin without a thought. Even if a sage were to reappear, what could be done? Some take pleasure in roaming, yet they merely treat rivers and seas as leisure, mountains and forests as refinement, and drift through life in dissipation. Such roaming in the world, though eccentric, remains mired in external pursuits.

Thus, he teaches that when the body is noble and the six senses are unobstructed, the Dao does not become stagnant. When knowledge rests and ceases, one should value the empty chamber, where the uncarved simplicity of the void gives rise to a roaming unbound by place—where the toiling strive for ease, the restless do not inquire, just as the noble person and the sage differ in degree.

As for Yanmen, who gained rank through slander, and Shentu, who fled Tang yet drowned in the river—all arose from the ruler’s esteem for lofty and exceptional conduct, which led subordinates to establish names for purity and cultivation. Though intended to encourage the world and promote teaching, they unwittingly harmed life and corrupted customs.

Thus, these examples serve as a mirror for later generations. To judge words by conduct is also to be bound by externals. Yet without pointing, one cannot see the moon; therefore, the noble person does not shrink from earnest instruction, while the learner must skillfully seek its essence.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: "Parables"**

"Parables" make up nineteen-tenths,
"Weighty Words" seventeen-tenths,
and "Goblet Words" emerge daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equilibrium.

"Parables" (nineteen-tenths):
Borrowing the words of outsiders to discuss—
a father does not act as his own son’s matchmaker;
a father’s praise of his son is not as credible as that of one who is not his father.
This is not my fault—it is the fault of others.
When others align with me, I respond;
when they do not align, I oppose.
What aligns with me is deemed right;
what differs from me is deemed wrong.

"Weighty Words" (seventeen-tenths):
These are the words of the aged and venerable.
Though one may be advanced in years,
without the warp and weft of beginnings and ends to mark the seasons,
the aged cannot be said to be truly ahead.
A person without means to surpass others is no person at all.
A person without the Way of humanity is called a "worn-out man."

"Goblet Words" emerge daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equilibrium:
They flow and extend, exhausting the years.
To not speak is to be equal;
to speak is to not be equal.
Speech and equality are not equal.
Thus it is said:
"To speak without speaking,
to speak all one’s life without having spoken;
to not speak all one’s life without having not spoken—
there is a source to this.
Yet there *can* be a source,
and yet there *cannot* be a source.
And if there is a source, how can it be so?
If it is so, then what is its *so*-ness?
If it is not so, then what is its *not-so*-ness?
What is permissible has its *permissible*-ness;
what is not permissible has its *not-permissible*-ness.
Things inherently have their *so*-ness;
things inherently have their *permissible*-ness.
No thing is not so;
no thing is not permissible."

"Goblet Words" emerge daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equilibrium:
Who attains their enduring essence?
All things are seeds,
each succeeding the other in different forms,
beginning and ending like a ring—
none can grasp their order.
This is called the "Heavenly Equality."
The "Heavenly Equality" is the Heavenly Equilibrium.

[The purpose of such words is to end human disputes.
*A zhī* is a round wine vessel.]

Borrowing causes—】
Guo’s commentary:【
When entrusted to others, ten words gain ninefold credence;
what the world esteems, ten words gain sevenfold credence.
A *zhī* brims and tilts, empties and rights itself—
it holds no constancy.
How much more with words?
They follow things, shift with change,
yielding only to what accords with them.
Thus it is said: "Emerging daily, emerging daily"—
meaning daily renewal.
Renewal exhausts their natural allotment;
natural allotment exhausted, harmony ensues.
Words spoken from oneself are often rejected by the vulgar,
hence the need to borrow from without.
Yan He, Lian Shu, and their like—
all are borrowed.
A father’s praise of his son is mostly disbelieved;
even when believed, it is suspected as habitual bias.
Thus, borrowing from without is necessary.
Yet even when one’s own words are trusted,
those harboring habitual doubt still refuse them.
Entrust them to others, and they are believed.
Such is the burden of human hearing.

Alike, they respond; different, they oppose,
mutually rejecting one another.
Three share sameness, two dispute their choice—
only where none dispute, all differing,
does one alone affirm right and wrong.
Why then borrow from without?
Because of their seniority.
The world collectively venerates age.
Even if their words do not borrow from without,
seven out of ten are still believed.
For the aged stand first among things—
yet in all else, root and branch,
they offer nothing to await others.
*Awaiting*—this is expectation.
Here, one merely enumerates the long-lived,
yet the vulgar readily believe them.
Such is the world’s settled habit.

Now, the natural has its allotment,
while right and wrong have no master.
Without a master, they sprawl endlessly—
who can fix them?
Thus, cast aside all attachments,
follow and entrust them to things,
so each may fulfill its Heaven-appointed years.
Consign them to things and employ their words,
then this and that, right and wrong,
naturally align as one.
If one cannot follow them in speech to unify them,
self and things remain unaligned.
Speaking what they speak,
though words exist, I ultimately do not speak.
*Free*—this is freedom.
From the bias of self and others arise approval and disapproval,
each thing naturally so.
Each naturally approves—
summed together, there is no approval, no disapproval.
No approval, no disapproval—
this is perfection.

Only words that follow things and conform to their natural allotment
avoid premature decline.
Though transformations succeed one another,
their *qi* remains one.
Now as beginning, yesterday as end—
all follows principle of itself.
Thus, none grasp their order.
This is called the "Heavenly Equality."
How could the Heavenly Equality be false?
All are the natural allotment.】

Lǚ’s Commentary:
"Of Zhuangzi’s *yuyan* parables, nineteen in ten are not parables; of his *chongyan* reiterations, seventeen in ten are not reiterations. Only the *zhiyan*—daily emerging, harmonizing with the Heavenly Boundary—is neither parable nor non-parable, neither reiteration nor non-reiteration.

What are the *yuyan* in nineteen cases? The Dao lies near in our hearts; if we discourse from our hearts, others may doubt and disbelieve—just as a father does not act as his son’s matchmaker, one must rely on external discourse. It is not that I do not wish to speak directly, but that people cannot be addressed directly.

What are the *chongyan* in seventeen cases? When others align with us, they respond and affirm; when they differ, they oppose and negate. What I speak to others aims to elicit response, not opposition. Thus, I speak to people through what their hearts already esteem, citing those they revere. All references to the ancients in the text are to those revered for their precedence—not for their age, but for their capacity to guide with structure and principle. Those who can lead others are followed; those who cannot are called ‘stale relics.’ How can the stale be esteemed?

Words that emerge have never truly been words—they are like the *zhi* vessel, poured from the wine jar yet ever empty, ever unaccumulated. The Heavenly Boundary is the ultimate of non-action, where the sage rests in harmony, letting right and wrong cease.

The Heavenly Equality means that action and stillness, speech and silence, are all the Heavenly Equality. Following its unfolding is principle itself, by which one exhausts the years. Only by being without self and without speech can one align; with speech, there is self and things—how can they align? Thus, alignment and speech, speech and alignment, have never been aligned. Without speech, though aligned, it still differs from alignment with speech—this is not yet great alignment. Only when speech is no-speech does great alignment arise: this is *zhiyan*.

Thus, one may speak a lifetime yet never have spoken; remain silent a lifetime yet never have ceased speaking. What is called ‘affirmable’ or ‘negatable,’ ‘so’ or ‘not so,’ all have their source. What is inherently so, inherently affirmable, admits no negation, no opposition—this is evident. The seeds of the ten thousand things emerge no differently; knowing their sameness, one knows their beginning and end as a circle. This is the Heavenly Equality. In this equality, right and wrong harmonize, the ten thousand things align—this is the ultimate of non-action, called the Heavenly Boundary."

Liu’s Summary:
"Water in the *zhi* vessel is like words in virtue: unfilled, they do not issue forth. What comes from without may be added but not increased; what emerges from within, though abundant, is never diminished. Thus it is said: *zhiyan* daily emerge. Things with boundaries must have a beginning; the natural boundary is a circle of beginning and end. Hence, ‘harmonizing with the Heavenly Boundary.’ Like creeping vines or flowing water, it exemplifies the thread of the natural. The Dao is whole, and things are unharmed—thus one may exhaust the years. ‘A lifetime of speech yet never having spoken; a lifetime of silence yet never having ceased speaking’—then the Six Classics are not fragmented, nor is the *Laozi* overly concise."

Zhuangzi said to Huizi:
"Confucius lived sixty years, and in sixty years, he transformed. What he once affirmed, he later negated—who knows whether what he now calls right is not what he called wrong at fifty-nine?"
Huizi replied: "Confucius was diligent in purpose, devoted to knowledge."
Zhuangzi said: "Confucius has transcended that. He never spoke of it. Confucius said: ‘One receives talent from the great root, returning to spirit to live. To sound in accord with pitch, to speak in accord with law, to set forth profit and righteousness before others—this merely subdues their mouths. To make people submit in heart and dare not oppose, to establish the world’s stability—is this enough? Enough? I cannot even reach him!’

Guo’s Commentary:
"Following the years, following transformation, moving with the times—when the times change, so do customs. One who rides things to roam the mind, how is he different from the common? Change does not cease; it cannot be constant. To call Confucius diligent in purpose and devoted to knowledge is to know he could not entrust himself to spontaneous transformation. This shows Huizi’s inadequacy—his spirit falls far short of the sage’s.

Confucius relinquished the self’s transformations as naturally so, not through knowledge or effort. Thus, he moved with the times, responded to things, and did not contrive words. If one employs talent and knowledge without returning to the root of spirit, life is lost. Sound arises from pitch; words emerge from law—but pitch and law are what the multitude creates. The sage merely employs them. Thus, he is never inappropriate, yet never speaks, never acts. *Fu* means ‘to employ.’"

I do not speak—what I speak is merely employing the mouths of others. The recitation of likes and dislikes, right and wrong, righteousness and profit has never once issued from my own mouth. The mouth serves to express the heart, so if I employ the mouths of the multitude, I employ their hearts. If I align with the hearts of the multitude, their hearts trust me—who would dare oppose or stand apart? I rely on the self-stabilization of all under heaven to stabilize it—what need is there for action? Thus, riding upon it, nothing is beyond reach.

Lü’s commentary:
It is said that Confucius at sixty "listened," and at seventy "followed the heart’s desires without overstepping the mark." This means that whatever the heart conceives, no right or wrong arises; whatever the mouth utters, no benefit or harm ensues. Before the Dao reaches the point of "following the heart," one cannot escape transformation—transformation must begin with "right" and end with "wrong." How can the "right" of sixty be certain that the "wrong" of fifty-nine is not so? Huizi did not understand this. What Confucius shared with others was merely the common—what he shared with heaven, from ancient times to the present, has never undergone transformation. To truly believe that he acted through diligent purpose and devoted knowledge is to misunderstand. To relinquish is to let go of things, allowing them to live—this is what is called "virtue," what is meant by "receiving one’s endowment." The great root returns to spirit to give life. Before birth, there is no qi, no form—how could there be what is called "spirit"? With birth, qi and form arise, and spirit is restored. When sound accords with pitch, there is no need to adjust tones; when words accord with law, there is no need to explain principles. Yet when righteousness and profit are recited before me, I merely follow and employ the mouths of others—likes and dislikes, right and wrong are but the straight path of others’ speech. For what they await is not yet settled, not the spontaneous transformation of non-action. As for making hearts submit so none dare stand apart, and thus stabilizing the stability of all under heaven—this is enabling self-transformation, not merely employing the mouths of others. That which I cannot attain is what he relinquished, never once speaking of it.

Following the root:
Employing knowledge to attend to affairs...

"Knowledge" here is talent, just as Mencius spoke of "Heaven’s bestowed talents." The "great root" is like the "great beginning." "Restoring spirit" means the human heart, empty and numinous, is obscured by material desires, and one restores it to its original state. *Wu* (蘁) means defiance. "Stabilizing the stability of all under heaven" means that all under heaven has its own inherent principle of stability—one merely stabilizes what is already stable.

When Huizi heard Zhuangzi’s words about Confucius transforming at sixty, he thought Confucius had merely toiled in mind and will to attend to affairs. But possessing much knowledge does not constitute transformation. Zhuangzi said: Not so. Confucius himself said: "One receives one’s nature from the beginning and can return to its empty numinosity to live. When one sounds forth, it accords with the pitch-pipes; when one speaks, it accords with the laws. When profit and righteousness are set before one, one knows likes and dislikes, right and wrong—this is the task of the Confucians, but it only submits the mouths of others. As for making hearts submit so none dare defy—this is the Way of the perfected person." He further praised it, saying: "Does the Dao stop here? Does it stop here? Yet I cannot attain that perfected person!"

The following is Confucius’ speech:

Zengzi took office twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: "When I served to support my parents, three measures of grain made my heart joyful. Later, when I served with three thousand bushels, I could not [reach] my heart’s sorrow." A disciple asked Confucius: "Can one say that Shen (Zengzi) had no entanglement in his faults?" Confucius said: "He was already entangled. How could one without entanglement feel sorrow? To him, three measures or three thousand bushels were like watching cranes, mosquitoes, or gnats pass before him."

Guo’s commentary: *Ji* (洎) means "to reach." *Xian* (县) means "entanglement," referring to Zengzi’s taking office for his parents without fault of entanglement in salary. Yet he was already entangled—bound to salary for sustenance. To nourish parents is to suit them, regardless of means. If one could be without entanglement, one would not weigh noble or base in mind, but remain peaceful and content, fulfilling the proper way of serving with countenance. That is what it means to be without entanglement. One without entanglement regards honor and salary as mosquitoes, gnats, or birds passing before him—how could there be sorrow or joy in between?

Lü’s commentary: Abiding in timeliness and following circumstances, sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this "the Emperor’s disentanglement." If one has no entanglement, one cannot feel sorrow. Life and death are great matters, yet sorrow and joy cannot enter—thus three measures or three thousand bushels are like watching sparrows, mosquitoes, or gnats pass before one. The insignificance of their size or quantity is self-evident.

Oral explanation: The disciple asked whether Zengzi’s words entailed the fault of entanglement, suspecting that his two transformations involved sorrow and joy. Confucius said: "He was already entangled." This sorrow and joy alone prove entanglement. If one were without entanglement, external things passing before one would be like mosquitoes or gnats—how could they cause sorrow or joy?

Yan Chengzi You said to Dongguo Ziqi: "Since I heard your words, after one year I became rustic; after two years, compliant; after three, penetrating; after four, in accord with things; after five, things came to me; after six, the spirit entered; after seven, Heaven was accomplished; after eight, I knew neither death nor life; after nine, I attained the great mystery. Life is something one does; death is something one is exhorted by. As for life, it has a source—it is yang. As for death, it has no source—it is indeed so. Where does it go? Where does it not go? Heaven has its celestial reckoning; earth has its human demarcations. Where should I seek it? I do not know its end—how could it be without fate? I do not know its beginning—how could it have fate? If there is something to respond to, how could there be no spirit? If there is nothing to respond to, how could there be spirit?"

Liu’s commentary: Those who discuss Heaven have the reckoning of celestial patterns; those who discuss earth have the traces of human demarcations. *Ren ju* (人据) means each person clings to their own boundaries without communication. Guo’s commentary: "Rustic" means relinquishing external advantages. "Compliant" means not acting on one’s own.

The all-pervading is the same in others and myself—things and things are identical. Coming arises from attainment; spirit enters the external form. Heaven completes without further action. Not knowing where death and life reside, one is at ease in all circumstances. Wondrous goodness! Good and evil being the same, there is nowhere one does not guard against. This speaks of one who has long heard the Dao and understood the spontaneity of the heavenly pipes. Suddenly, one forgets oneself, and the defilements daily recede until they are entirely gone.

To live and act is to guard against life’s spontaneity. Because of acting, there is death; because of selfishly cherishing life, there is action. Now, what I urge you with is that death arises from selfishness. The yang of life flourishes, and by leaving no traces and acting without contrivance, it suddenly stands alone—not arising from anything. Yet it is indeed so. Thus, there is nowhere it goes and nowhere it does not go, and only then is it at ease everywhere. When all is at ease, it reaches completion. Heaven and earth are already self-sufficient; principle must naturally end, not depending on knowledge. If it is not fate, how can one not know the reason for its being so? Yet to call it fate seems as if there were intent. Therefore, I discard the name of fate to clarify that it is spontaneously so, and only then is the principle of fate complete.

Principle must have a response, as if there were spirit to bring it about. Yet principle responds of itself, not depending on causes—thus, though it responds, there is no spirit.

Lü’s commentary:
The Dao has never yet had things. Once there are things, and one desires to return to the absence of things, then the attainment of emptiness and the preservation of stillness are not the work of a single morning. "Rustic" means forgetting benevolence and righteousness, guests and rituals, music and propriety. "Compliant" means the heart is without opposition. "All-pervading" means the heart thoroughly penetrates things, and when it reaches things, all things roam; all things are observed. "Coming" means the Dao gathers there; "spirit enters" means spirit and divinity come to dwell. "Heaven completes" means uniting virtue with Heaven. Not knowing death, not knowing life, is to know rest in what one does not know. Great wondrousness—then one is spirit! Only after speaking of the wondrousness of the myriad things can one embody spirit.

To live and act without contrivance is not to know there is life, not to know there is death. To live and act is to have death. I urge you to be impartial and without selfishness, and then you will not know there is death. Life and action are the source of death. Thus, the sage puts the body outside and yet preserves it. By being without selfishness, one can perfect one’s selfishness—this is how I urge you. Tracing beginnings and grasping ends, one knows the explanation of life and death. Beginning and end are like a ring—life is yang, and that is all. How could there be a source from which acting arises? It is also spoken from the perspective of the feelings of things—is it indeed so?

Thus, those who embody the Dao and exhaust spirit do not know there is death or life, nor do they know where they go or do not go. If one seeks it in celestial reckoning and human demarcations, they have never been the same—how could one seek it there? Or seek it in the fortunes and misfortunes between human affairs? If one takes it to be without fate, in the end it seems as if there were something controlling it. If one takes it to be with fate, seeking its beginning is impossible. If one takes it to be without spirit, yet there is something to respond to; if one takes it to be with spirit, yet there is nothing to respond to—thus, one rests in what one does not know and has no place for the heart. This is how one attains it.

Two inquiries were posed to the Reflection by the Penumbrae: "Earlier you bowed your head, now you raise it; earlier your hair was bound, now it hangs loose; earlier you sat, now you rise; earlier you walked, now you halt—why is this?" The Reflection replied: "Such trifling matters—why do you ask so persistently? I act, yet I know not why I act. I am like the cicada’s shed husk, the snake’s sloughed skin—resembling them, yet not them. Fire and sunlight are my gathering; darkness and night are my alternation. Is it that I depend on these? How much more so for those who depend on others? When they come, I come with them; when they go, I go with them. When they are vigorous and radiant, I am vigorous and radiant with them. What question is there to ask in this?"*

*[Annotations from the text: The cicada’s husk and snake’s slough are shed skins. "Gathering" (屯) means to assemble. "Trifling" (叟叟) is also written as 搜搜, pronounced *sōu*.]

Guo’s commentary: *[Movement occurs of itself, with no cause for inquiry—it is simply so, hence one knows not why. The reflection resembles form yet is not form. Pushing this to its limit, what is now called "dependence" ultimately reaches the principle of "no-dependence" and "self-transformation," which becomes manifest. It is merely vigorous radiance, movement, mutual following, coming and going—endless and unquestionable.]*

Lü’s commentary: *[The Penumbrae arise from the reflection; beyond the reflection lies subtle darkness, not singular, hence called "trifling." The reflection’s bowing, raising, walking, and halting merely follow the person—how could it know why? That form has a reflection is like the cicada having a husk or the snake a slough, yet it is not the cicada’s husk or the snake’s slough. The reflection gathers and becomes visible in fire and sunlight, alternates and vanishes in darkness and night—this is what the reflection depends on to be a reflection, yet it is without awareness. How could it know of dependence? What the reflection depends on—sunlight, fire, darkness, night—cannot be called dependence. How much less so for those who depend on others? Those who depend on others arise from the reflection, which is form. Since the Penumbrae are without dependence, we know the reflection is without dependence; since the reflection is without dependence, we know what gives rise to the reflection is also without dependence—thus it is not burdened by form. When they come and go, I come and go with them; when they are vigorous and radiant, I am vigorous and radiant with them—yet none of this is me. What question is there to ask?]*

Xun’s edition: *[括 means "bound hair." 叟 is an address for an elder. 稍 means "slight." 彼 refers to form.]*

Moreover, when one employs it to instruct others, forcing the yang—this unbalanced yang qi—then Penumbrae and reflections become like two elders meeting. How long can two elders remain in the world? The moments they might question one another are but fleeting. Why must you ask even briefly?

I speak of my own reflection. Though I possess this shadow, I know not the reason for its existence. Some say the shadow arises from form, like the cicada’s shell or the snake’s slough—this seems plausible, yet it is not so. The shell still belongs to the cicada, the slough still belongs to the snake. But when the shadow encounters fire or sunlight, it gathers and appears; when it meets darkness or night, it departs and vanishes. Without fire or sunlight, even with form present, it cannot become my shadow. Thus, while that form may produce my shadow, it must depend on something else. How much more so for the Penumbrae, which rely on the shadow’s dependence?

When that form comes and goes, I necessarily come and go with it; when that form is vigorous and radiant, I too am vigorous and radiant with it. Yet this vigorous radiance is not the true qi of blood and breath, and the shadow merely follows it to manifest. Neither form nor shadow is real—why then ask about this false doubling, which only repeats itself while the meaning grows ever more transcendent?

Yang Ziju traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west to Qin. Invited to the outskirts, they met at Liang, where Laozi looked up to the heavens and sighed: “At first, I thought you could be taught—now, you cannot.”

Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching his lodging, he washed his face, rinsed his mouth, combed his hair, removed his shoes outside the door, then crawled forward on his knees and said: “Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you a question, but you were walking without pause, so I dared not speak. Now there is a pause—may I ask the reason?”

Laozi said: “Your gaze is haughty and overbearing—with whom do you dwell? Utter purity appears defiled; abundant virtue seems insufficient.”

Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: “I respectfully receive your instruction.”

When he had left, the innkeeper welcomed him, leading him home; the master of the house held the mat, his wife held the comb and towel, the guests rose from their seats, and the cook left the stove. When he returned, the innkeeper and guests contended with him for the seat.

---

[Yang’s given name was Rong, styled Ziju; the *Liezi* writes it as Yang Zhu. *Sui* means to raise the eyes; *xu* means to widen the eyes—both describe an upward gaze on the face, verging on arrogance. *Yang* refers to cooking.]

Guo’s commentary: [*Sui sui xu xu* describes a domineering manner; others will find it difficult to approach and will distance themselves. He exalted his form and set himself apart, so they feared and avoided him. Once he shed his pride, they contended with him for the seat.]

Lü’s commentary: [His haughty gaze set him apart, so the innkeeper welcomed and led him in—this was the summons of shoes filling the doorway. Laozi’s sigh over Ziju’s formed brilliance, and Bohun’s departure from Yu Kou, share the same principle.]

Jiang Yu: [Confucius said: “Without refinement, one cannot attain truth.” Washing his face, rinsing his mouth, combing his hair, removing his shoes, and crawling forward on his knees—all were to seek truth. Among human faculties, none is finer than the pupils, for they are where the spirit resides. When those who have attained the Dao meet, a glance conveys the Way; those who know others often discern them in the brows and lashes. Thus, Yangzi’s haughty, overbearing gaze led Laozi to deem him unteachable.

“Clear in all four directions” is called utter purity; “ever more humble when descending” is called appearing defiled. Empty yet inexhaustible, abundant virtue seems insufficient. Such a one regards the world with equanimity—what place is there for haughty gazes? Avoiding the seat was not merely about non-contention; contending for the seat was not merely about non-avoidance. Upon receiving instruction and returning, those who once avoided him now vied with him. The distance between Qin and Liang is not great; the innkeeper today is the same as yesterday, and Yang Zhu is not two different people. Yet their encounter changed so abruptly—this reveals how the subtlest Dao, though ever-present, alters form and shifts thought, eluding common understanding.

When he traveled south to Pei, he followed external things; upon returning, he reverted to the root of destiny. Whether avoiding or contending, it lay in the difference between going and coming.]

A humble opinion in summary: [This chapter uses allegory as its title, conveying the Immortal of Nanhua’s meaning of “crossing water without wetting the feet.” Reflecting on my own words, I fear later generations might cling to traces and become ensnared, so I erase the traces step by step. The allegories and reiterations are unavoidable borrowings from external discussions.

The *zhi*-vessel’s water, though bounded, does not spill—its outflow comes from within, thus it “flows without ceasing.” Right and wrong, same and different, each finds its proper place. Words arise from wordlessness, just as silence is also a form of speech. Whether affirmed or negated, it is merely the world’s preferences.]

Alas! How can one know whether this is inherently so or inherently permissible? Thus, only by reaching wordlessness does equality arise.

Ah! As the world declines and the Dao withers, none believe in oneself, and one cannot fulfill one’s aspirations in the present age. Yet still, one hopes to leave teachings for future generations, fearing there will be no way to ensure posterity’s understanding. Therefore, one guards what is most essential to gain their trust.

Let them enter through allegory to preserve their authenticity, following subtle signs to ascend to the marvelous—its achievement is one and the same.

As for the ultimate discourse, the Master’s traces shift with the years: what was right at first may end in wrong, and what is right in one’s own time cannot endure forever. How much less, then, can one expect to be unquestionably believed by later ages?

Zengzi took office twice and changed twice, his heart not free from entanglement; sorrow and joy took shape. Was it not asked whether it was for his parents or for emolument?

Yet those who hear words and awaken—like Ziyou, who in a single year went from rustic to attaining the great marvel—find their hearts growing ever more empty and the Dao ever more gathered.

Next, the discussion of whether fate and spirits have form, and the causes of shadows and echoes, all reveal the marvels of creation that cannot be fathomed. If one can fulfill what creation bestows and not obstruct the heavenly within, then the heaven and earth of one’s own body—this unfathomable spiritual thing—are likewise so.

Concluding with haughty arrogance: who would dwell with such a person? Yet those who hear the command and return to their homes, contending for mats, do so in the instant of listening with the heart and awakening. Who would say that those who carry the Dao to instruct later generations are like those who catch fish and forget the trap?

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Yielding the Throne**

Yao offered the empire to Xu You, but Xu You declined. He then offered it to Zizhou Zhipu, who said: *"That you would make me Son of Heaven is acceptable—yet I happen to suffer from a deep-seated melancholy, and am presently occupied with curing it. I have no leisure to govern the empire. The empire is the weightiest of burdens, yet I would not let it harm my life—how much less would I do so for other things? Only one who takes no account of the empire can be entrusted with it."*

Shun offered the empire to Zizhou Zhibo, who said: *"I, too, suffer from a deep-seated melancholy and am presently occupied with curing it. I have no leisure to govern the empire. Thus, the empire is a great vessel, yet one must not exchange life for it—this is how those who embody the Way differ from the vulgar."*

Shun then offered the empire to Shan Juan, who replied: *"I stand amid the cosmos: in winter, I wear furs and pelts; in summer, coarse or fine kudzu cloth. In spring, I plow and sow, toiling enough to labor my body; in autumn, I reap and gather, resting enough to nourish myself. I rise with the sun and rest with its setting, wandering carefree between heaven and earth, my heart and mind content. Why would I take the empire? Alas, how little you know me!"* He refused and departed, entering the deep mountains where none knew his whereabouts.

Shun offered the empire to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer said: *"How earnest you are! Here is one who preserves his strength—a man of true vigor. Yet even Shun’s virtue has not reached its perfection."*

Then the man shouldered his burdens, his wife carried their belongings on her head, and together they led their child into the sea, never to return.

King Tai of the Zhou dwelt in Bin, but the Di tribes attacked him. He offered them furs and silks, yet they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, yet they refused; he offered them pearls and jade, yet they refused. What the Di sought was land.

King Tai said: *"To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—how could I bear it? Go, all of you, and dwell as you will. What difference is there between serving as my subjects and serving the Di?"* Moreover, he had heard it said: *"Do not let what nourishes harm what is nourished."* So he leaned on his staff and departed. The people followed in such numbers that they formed a line, and together they established a state beneath Mount Qi. This King Tai may be said to have known how to honor life.

One who knows how to honor life, though noble and wealthy, does not let prosperity harm his body; though poor and lowly, does not let profit burden his form. Yet men of this age who occupy high office and exalted rank all cling fiercely to what they might lose, and for the sake of gain lightly risk their lives—are they not deluded?

The people of Yue murdered their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, troubled by this, fled into the Cinnabar Caves, and Yue was left without a king. When they could not find Prince Sou, they pursued him into the Cinnabar Caves. The prince refused to emerge, so the people of Yue fumigated the cave with mugwort. They brought the royal carriage, and Prince Sou, grasping the reins, mounted it. Looking up to heaven, he cried: *"A ruler! A ruler! Could you not spare me alone?"*

Prince Sou did not despise being a ruler—he despised the calamities that come with being one. One such as Prince Sou may be said not to let the state harm his life. This is precisely what the people of Yue desired in a ruler.

Duke Lu’s note: *"You"* (幽) means hidden, as in the *Book of Songs*: *"as if harboring hidden sorrow."* *"Juanjuan"* (卷卷) describes strenuous effort—what is used to nourish the land, while what is nourished is the people. *"Not letting prosperity harm the body"* and *"not letting profit burden the form"* mean that in wealth and nobility, one possesses nourishment yet does not blindly let it harm the body, while in poverty and lowliness, one lacks profit yet does not let the pursuit of it weigh down the form. *"Sou"* is the prince’s name; the *Huainanzi* writes it as *"Yi."* The *Erya* states: *"Where the sun shines from the south is called the Cinnabar Caves."*

Lü’s commentary: In the late eras of the Three Dynasties, fathers and sons, brothers, all contended for the realm, slaughtering one another. The so-called scholars of the age risked their lives and treated existence lightly to seek favor—this is why the *"Yielding the Throne"* chapter was composed. Perhaps it was inspired by men like Zhi Fu, who would not exchange their lives for all under heaven. Yang Xiong believed that the ancient sages, in the weightiness of Yao’s abdication to Shun, did not take Yu lightly. What is meant by *"weightiness"* if not that one must test a successor thoroughly before entrusting the realm to him? Yet they did not realize that what made Yao able to obtain Shun lay not in such trials—for trials are common to all men, as in the saying *"exposing him to the people."* Had Yu not possessed the intent to avoid Yao’s favor, how could they have known his trials would not surpass Shun’s?

Yi Du’s note: To have a body is to require nourishment; to have life is to bear burdens. The wealthy and noble delight in nourishment, but excess harms the body. The poor and lowly are pressed by profit, but loss entangles the form. Only by avoiding these two perils can one truly honor life. Yet this is but the remnant of the sage’s way, not its essence. The sage’s true essence lies in forgetting life so that life is perfectly preserved, forgetting nourishment so that nourishment is fully realized. Though entrusted with the realm and its affairs, it is merely a matter of circumstance—what cause is there for reluctance?

Xun Ben’s note: In present-day Wuling County, south of Changde Prefecture, stands the Altar of Shanjuan. During the Zhenghe era of the Song, it was bestowed the title *"Master of Reclusive Loftiness."* The prefect Li Fang composed an inscription for the altar, near which his tomb still lies.

The states of Han and Wei contended over border lands. Zihua Zi met with Marquis Zhao of Han, who wore a troubled expression. Zihua Zi said: *"Suppose the world inscribed a maxim before you, which read: ‘If you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be severed; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be severed. Yet whoever seizes it shall possess all under heaven.’ Would you seize it?"* Marquis Zhao replied: *"I would not."* Zihua Zi said: *"Excellent. From this, we see that your two arms are weightier than all under heaven, and your body weightier still than your arms. How much lighter, then, is Han’s claim compared to the realm? And how much lighter still is what you now contend over? You grieve, harming your life with sorrow—all for naught."* Marquis Zhao said: *"Well said! Many have instructed me, yet never have I heard such words. Zihua Zi truly understands the weight of things."* (Zihua Zi was a man of Wei. *"Jue"* means to seize; *"fei"* means to sever and discard.)

Lü’s commentary: Marquis Zhao, by heeding Zihua Zi’s words and dismissing what he contested, ranks next to those who would not exchange their lives for all under heaven.

Bi Xu’s note: Which is dearer—name or body? Which is greater—body or wealth? Why exhaust oneself over barren battlefields? The *Honglie* explains: *"To slaughter warhorses in pursuit of foxes, to clutch two turtles while losing a sacred tortoise, to sever one’s right arm for a single hair, to break a Mo Ye blade for a mere awl—these are truly those who know not the weight of things."*

When the Lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao, he sent an envoy bearing gifts to precede him.

Yan He dwelt in a humble lane, clad in coarse cloth of hemp and ramie, tending his own cattle. When the envoy of the Lord of Lu arrived, Yan He himself received him. The envoy asked, “Is this the home of Yan He?” Yan He replied, “This is He’s home.” The envoy presented the gifts, but Yan He said, “I fear the messenger may have erred in his instructions and thus bring blame upon himself. It would be better to verify.” The envoy returned and confirmed the matter, then came again to seek him, but Yan He could no longer be found. Thus it was clear that one such as Yan He truly despised wealth and honor.

Therefore it is said: The true essence of the Dao is for the cultivation of the self; its remnants and leavings may be used for the state. Its dregs and chaff may be applied to govern the world. From this perspective, the achievements of emperors and kings are but the surplus affairs of sages—never the means to perfect the self or nurture life. Yet today, the gentlemen of the俗世 often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue external things. Is this not lamentable?

In all the actions of sages, they must examine their purpose and their means. Suppose there were a man here who used the pearl of the Marquis of Sui to shoot a sparrow a thousand *ren* high—surely the world would laugh at him. Why? Because what he employed was weighty, while what he sought was trivial. How much more so is life itself, which far surpasses the pearl of the Marquis of Sui!

The Lord of Lu (or the Marquis of Lu) had a son named Ma, whose status was as low as weeds or dung. Yet even such humble origins may offer glimpses of insight—difficult to advance, easy to retreat, this is the constant cultivation of the noble person, growing deeper with time until it stands beyond all debate. Moreover, among all the achievements under heaven, none surpass those of emperors and kings, yet even these are deemed mere surplus affairs of the sage. If this is so, how could the true essence of the sage be fathomed by common minds? The "purpose" and "means" (or "path" and "resting place") refer to the *suoyou* and *suoan*. I fear that listeners may misconstrue the character *zhe* (者) as redundant. The phrase "to perfect the self" (*zhi shen*) should be understood as "to preserve." In all the actions of the sage, the character *sheng* (圣) is superfluous. The "weight of the Marquis of Sui" should read "pearl of the Marquis of Sui," as confirmed by the *Lüshi Chunqiu*. Lü Buwei lived not long after Zhuangzi and must have preserved the authentic meaning.

Liezi appeared impoverished, his countenance bearing the hue of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Ziyang of Zheng, saying, "Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao. That he dwells in your state yet suffers hardship—does this not suggest you do not favor scholars?" Ziyang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send grain to Liezi. Liezi met the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed. Liezi entered his home, where his wife, clutching her heart, reproached him: "I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and joy. Now you bear the look of hunger, yet the lord, recognizing his error, sent you food, and you refused it. Is this not fate?" Liezi laughed and replied, "The lord does not know me personally. He sent me grain based on another’s words, and he could just as easily condemn me based on another’s words. This is why I did not accept it." Later, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang. (Ziyang, the chief minister of Zheng, was severe and merciless; none who offended him were spared. His retainer broke a bow, fearing Ziyang’s wrath, and the people, likening him to a rabid dog, killed him.)

Bi Xu comments: Would a true scholar willingly sink into obscurity, bending his will to accept undeserved emolument? Could one who indulges the sentiments of wife and children thus entangle himself in the snares of disaster?

When King Zhao of Chu lost his state, a butcher named Yue followed him into exile. When the king returned to his state, he sought to reward those who had followed him, including the butcher. The butcher said, "When the great king lost his state, I lost my butcher’s stall. Now that the great king has returned, I have regained my butcher’s stall. My rank and emoluments are restored—what reward is there to speak of?" The king insisted, saying, "Compel him to accept." The butcher replied, "The great king lost his state not through any fault of mine, so I dared not submit to punishment. The great king’s return is not through any merit of mine, so I dare not claim reward." The king said, "Let me see him." The butcher replied, "According to the laws of Chu, only those who render great service are granted audience. My wisdom was insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage was insufficient to die in battle. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled in fear of disaster—not out of any special devotion to the great king. Now the great king wishes to set aside the law and break the covenant to see me. This is not what I have heard of the ways of the world." The king said to Sima Ziqi, "The butcher’s station is lowly, yet his exposition of principle is lofty. You must secure for me a position of the Three Standards for him." The butcher said, "I know that a position of the Three Standards is nobler than a butcher’s stall, and an emolument of ten thousand *zhong* is richer than a butcher’s profit. Yet how could I greedily accept rank and emolument and thereby cause my lord to bear a reputation for reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall." Thus he declined the offer. (The Three Standards: The *Shiji* reads "Three Jade Tablets," as the three ministers of the feudal lords all held jade tablets.)

Bi Xu comments: Those who recite the Odes and Documents yet act with integrity in a butcher’s stall—such men exist in every age. Those who seize power as their own merit or barter influence for great reward, upon hearing this, should feel shame.

Kou Yi notes: When the great king returned to his state, the butcher returned to his stall—each regained his proper place. The Three Standards refer to the Three Dukes, whose carriages and robes each bore distinct insignia, hence "Three Standards."

Yuan Xian lived in Lu in a dwelling of barely twenty paces square, its roof thatched with growing grass, its door incomplete, its hinge made of mulberry wood, its windows of earthen jars. Two rooms were partitioned with coarse cloth, the roof leaked above, the floor was damp below, yet he sat upright and sang. Zigong arrived in a grand carriage, his inner robe dark blue, his outer robe white, his carriage too wide for the lane, and went to see Yuan Xian. Yuan Xian, wearing a hat of thorns, shoes of hemp, leaning on a staff, answered the door. Zigong said, "Alas! Master, what ails you?" Yuan Xian replied, "I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, and to study yet be unable to practice is called affliction. I am poor, not afflicted." Zigong retreated, his face flushed with shame. Yuan Xian laughed and said, "To act for the sake of the world, to befriend for mutual advantage, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to conceal one’s virtue with benevolence and righteousness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do."

Zengzi lived in Wei, wearing a quilted robe without lining, his complexion swollen, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not light a fire, for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its tassel broke; when he grasped his lapel, his elbow showed; when he put on his shoes, his heels split. Yet as he dragged his hempen shoes, singing the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filled heaven and earth, as if issuing from metal or stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject, the feudal lords could not befriend him. Thus, he who cultivates his will forgets his form; he who cultivates his form forgets profit; he who attains the Dao forgets his heart.

Confucius said to Yan Hui, "Come, Hui. Your family is poor, your station low—why do you not serve in office?" Yan Hui replied, "I do not wish to serve. Outside the city walls, I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge. Within the city walls, I have ten *mu* of fields, enough to supply silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough for my amusement; studying the Master’s Dao is enough for my joy. I do not wish to serve." Confucius’s expression changed, and he said, "Excellent, Hui’s intent! I have heard that he who is content does not burden himself with profit, that he who truly possesses himself is not dismayed by loss, and that he who cultivates virtue within is not ashamed by lack of position. I have recited this for a long time, but only now do I see it in you. This is my gain." (The character *kuang* 匡 means "to correct." *Xi* 縰 refers to dragging one’s shoes.)

The term *yingmen* 应门 refers to answering at one’s own gate; *xishi* 希世 means to disregard worldly reputation. *Zhongkuai* 肿哙 describes rough, chapped skin, while *bocuo* 剥错 signifies tattered and worn. Another interpretation holds that it describes the inconstant nature of fullness and emptiness.

The newly transmitted teaching states:
Wealth and honor are what all people desire; poverty and lowliness are what all people detest. Both desire and aversion arise from the heart. If one can be without heart, then desire and aversion are thereby forgotten. When desire and aversion are forgotten, one abides in wealth and honor yet remains unaware of their presence, dwells in poverty and lowliness yet remains unaware of their weight. Serene and self-content, one roams freely between Heaven and Earth.

Men like Yuan Xian, Zengzi, and Yan Hui may be called those without heart. Yuan Xian lived in a wattle hut with a door of woven thorns and a window of broken jars. Zengzi’s complexion was rough and chapped, his robes and cap torn and frayed. Yan Hui, poor and of low station, had only gruel and porridge, silk and hemp to sustain him. Yet none of the three ever resented poverty or forgot the Dao. Sometimes singing, sometimes humming, they forgot their forms and attained self-contentment. How could they have striven to chase external things and harm their lives? This is what sets them apart from the common world.

Thus it is said: he who attains the Dao forgets the heart.

The Prince of Zhongshan, Gongzi Mou, said to Zhanzi, “Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart resides beneath the towers of Wei—what is to be done?”
Zhanzi replied, “Value life, and profit will naturally grow light.”
The Prince of Zhongshan said, “Though I know this, I have not yet overcome myself.”
Zhanzi said, “If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your spirit—what harm is there in that? If you cannot overcome yourself yet forcibly resist, this is called double injury. A doubly injured person cannot long endure.”

Though Wei Mou was a prince of ten thousand chariots, his retreat to mountain caves and caverns would have been difficult even for a commoner. Though he had not yet fully attained the Dao, he may be said to have grasped its intent.

The *Xiang Wei* observes the gates of a lord’s state—*Huainanzi* renders it as *guī què*; Xu Shen explains it as the two watchtowers of the Son of Heaven.

To doubt alone:
The Lord of Wei, Gongzi Mou, was enfeoffed in Zhongshan; Zhanzi was a worthy man of Wei. The human heart is most difficult to overcome, and though his body dwelt by rivers and seas, his heart resided beneath the towers of Wei, confessing that he had not yet freed himself from thoughts of wealth and rank. To value life is to make profit light; when profit is light, one no longer longs for the towers of Wei. Though Mou knew that life should be valued and things made light, his heart could not overcome itself. If one cannot overcome oneself, it is better to follow one’s spirit rather than forcibly suppress it—suppression wounds the inner spirit, and the spirit abhors it. Inability to overcome oneself is one injury; forcing suppression is a second. Thus it is called double injury, which is no way to nurture oneself. Hence it is said: “A doubly injured person cannot long endure.”

What Zhanzi spoke of cannot serve as a model for those who study the Dao. It is like a skilled physician treating illness: he must examine the patient before prescribing a remedy, aiming only to cure the ailment.

Confucius was beset between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food, his gruel of wild greens lacking even a grain of rice. His complexion was utterly worn, yet he sang in his chamber. Yan Hui picked vegetables while Zilu and Zigong spoke to one another: “The Master was twice driven from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, and now he is trapped between Chen and Cai. Those who would kill the Master bear no guilt; those who would lend him aid face no prohibition. Yet he sings and plays the zither without ceasing—can a gentleman be so shameless?”

Yan Hui had no reply. He entered and told Confucius, who pushed aside his zither and sighed deeply: “You and Ci are small-minded. Call them in; I will speak to them.” Zilu and Zigong entered. Zilu said, “In such straits, one may truly be called destitute.” Confucius said, “What words are these? A gentleman who is at one with the Dao is called ‘at one’; one who is cut off from the Dao is called ‘cut off.’ Now I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness yet suffer the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, when I look within, I am not cut off from the Dao; when I face adversity, I do not lose my virtue. When bitter cold arrives and frost and snow descend, I thereby know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai may yet prove fortunate for me.”

Confucius then calmly returned to his zither and sang, while Zilu, inspired, took up his shield and danced. Zigong said, “I did not know the height of heaven or the depth of earth!” The ancients who attained the Dao found joy in poverty and joy in prosperity—their joy was not in poverty or prosperity. When virtue and power reside here, then poverty and prosperity become as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain. Thus Xu You delighted in Yingyang, and Gong Bo found contentment on Mount Gong’s summit.

Lu’s commentary:
From Yan He driving bandits to Confucius, none recklessly accepted rank or emolument, bestowing gifts even in poverty and want, enduring cold and hunger without altering their joy. Next to them, Gongzi Mou, though not yet having attained the Dao, may be said to have grasped its intent. As for the common run of men, steeped in worldly falsity, when they hear of the ways of Xu You and Shan Juan, they deem them mad and do not believe. Thus, recounting the sagely and worthy—none who forgot life found it easy—makes clear that to not let the world and its states harm one’s life is no small matter.

Sima Biao:
Gong Bo’s name was He; he cultivated his conduct and loved worthy men. During King Li of Zhou’s troubles, when the Son of Heaven’s line was severed, the feudal lords all requested that he become the new ruler. He reigned for fourteen years, but a great drought came, houses burned, and divination at Taiyang revealed an omen: King Li was the cause. The Duke of Shao then enthroned King Xuan, and Gong Bo returned to his ancestral line, wandering carefree at the summit of Mount Gong.

Shun yielded the world to his friend, the Northerner Wu Ze. The Northerner Wu Ze said, “How strange! What sort of man is this latter-day ruler?”

Dwelling amid the furrowed fields and wandering at Yao’s gate were not enough—he sought still to sully me with his shameful conduct. Ashamed to face him, I cast myself into the limpid, icy abyss.

When Tang was about to strike down Jie, he consulted Bian Sui. Bian Sui said, “This is not my affair.” Tang asked, “Who, then, is suitable?” He replied, “I do not know.” Tang then consulted Mao Guang. Mao Guang said, “This is not my affair.” Tang asked, “Who, then, is suitable?” He replied, “I do not know.” Tang said, “What of Yi Yin?” Mao Guang answered, “A man of strength and endurance, who tolerates disgrace—I know nothing beyond that.” Thereupon Tang took counsel with Yi Yin, overthrew Jie, and offered the throne to Bian Sui. Bian Sui declined, saying, “When the sovereign attacked Jie, he sought my counsel—he must have regarded me as a traitor. Having vanquished Jie, he offers me the throne—he must regard me as greedy. I was born into a disordered age, and now this man of no Dao twice comes to sully me with his shameful conduct. I cannot bear to hear of it again.” He cast himself into the Zhou River and died.

Tang then offered the throne to Mao Guang, saying, “The wise devise the plan, the martial carry it out, and the humane dwell in its fruits—this is the Way of antiquity. Why do you not ascend?” Mao Guang declined, saying, “To depose a sovereign is not righteous; to kill the people is not humane. Others endure hardship while I enjoy the profit—this is not integrity. I have heard it said: one who does not act righteously does not accept its emoluments; in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its soil—how much less accept its honors? I cannot bear to witness this long.” He carried a stone and drowned himself in the Lu River.

In the rise of the Zhou, there were two knights dwelling in Guzhu named Boyi and Shuqi. The two conferred, saying, “We have heard there is one in the west who seems to possess the Dao. Let us go and observe.” When they reached Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them. He made a covenant with them, saying, “I will raise your rank two grades and appoint you to the first rank of office,” and sealed it with the blood of a sacrificial victim, burying it. The two looked at each other and laughed, saying, “Alas! How strange! This is not what we call the Dao.” In ancient times, when Shennong ruled the world...

At that time, sacrifices were performed with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessings. In their dealings with others, they were loyal and trustworthy, administering affairs thoroughly yet without seeking anything in return. Joy accompanied governance when governance was joyful; joy accompanied order when order was joyful. They did not achieve self-fulfillment through others’ ruin, nor exalt themselves through others’ lowliness, nor profit from the times they encountered. Now, the Zhou, seeing the disorder of the Yin, hastily seized governance—scheming above and bribing below, relying on military force to maintain power, slaughtering sacrificial victims to swear oaths as tokens of trust, employing flattery to please the masses, and resorting to killing and warfare to seize advantage. This is but replacing chaos with violence.

We have heard that the knights of old, when encountering an age of order, did not shirk their duties; when facing an age of chaos, they did not seek mere survival. Now, the world is benighted, the Zhou’s virtue has declined, and it has become one with the Yin. For the Zhou to employ us would be to stain our persons. It is better to avoid them to preserve the purity of our conduct.

The two men traveled north to Mount Shouyang and there starved to death.

As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and honor, if they could be avoided, they would certainly not rely on them. With lofty integrity and unyielding conduct, they rejoiced in their own aspirations and did not serve the world. Such was the integrity of these two knights.

*(The State of Guzhu lay within the borders of present-day Lingzhi County in Liaoxi. "Blood of a sacrificial victim" in some versions reads "slaughter of a sacrificial victim.")*

*(Guo’s commentary: The *Analects* states that Boyi and Shuqi starved beneath Mount Shouyang without mentioning their deaths. This text speaks of their deaths, but only to clarify that they endured starvation to the end—not necessarily that they died of starvation. Lu’s commentary: Those like Wuze, Suiguang, and Boyi and Shuqi not only refused the world and its ranks and emoluments but also regarded hearing its words or dwelling in its age as defilement, even to the point of drowning or starving to death. This makes their joy in the Dao and forgetfulness of life all the more difficult—something the common world cannot believe. These several worthies were all sages and worthies, thus they were fundamentally enlightened regarding the meaning of life and death. Death may be weightier than Mount Tai or lighter than a goose feather, yet the abdications of Shun and Yu later degenerated into the usurpations of Zihuai and King Wu of Yin. The deeds of Wuze, Suiguang, Boyi, and Shuqi, when their influence reached later ages, were no small benefit to the world. Thus, death was not what they loved. Yet Han Fei claimed that Tang, fearing the world would deem him greedy, feigned refusal to Wu Guang, and that Wu Guang, fearing acceptance, had Tang’s flatterers drown him so that Tang might shift ill repute onto Wu Guang. Sima Qian also did not believe in the existence of one called Suiguang. Han Fei, in knowing how to sacrifice his life, would measure Tang and Wu Guang by such standards. Yet Xu You, Zhi Fu, and Zhi Bo would not exchange their lives for the world, thereby teaching later ages to honor life and disdain profit. Wuze, Suiguang, Boyi, and Shuqi, on the other hand, abandoned life to benefit the world, teaching later ages to forget life and esteem righteousness. Their benevolence was one and the same.

Zhuangzi, when discussing the supreme Dao to relinquish fame and profit, placed Boyi, Shuqi, and Suiguang among those to be rejected. Yet when discussing abdication to awaken the world from the folly of endangering oneself for external things, he placed them among those to be esteemed. The reader who understands this will grasp the meaning without needing the words.)*

*(Guo’s general commentary: The overarching intent of this chapter is to inspire a spirit of lofty refusal and distant retreat. Thus, those touched by this spirit, even if they were greedy and reckless men riding the celestial thoroughfare or entering the imperial court, would still sigh in lament midway. How much more so for ordinary men? Therefore, the likes of Boyi and Xu You are worthy counterparts to Yi and Lü. Those who dwell in mountain valleys yet ennoble the world, though not all become sagely ministers, are still loftier than those mired in dust and grime. Their deeds may be difficult to emulate, but their influence is less prone to corruption and thus can be transmitted. Where lies the flaw in Boyi and Xu You? Xu You’s flaw was that it led men to feign refusal in order to seek advancement, culminating in the likes of Zihuai. Boyi’s influence allowed tyrannical rulers to wield their poison without anyone daring to resist. The flaw of Yi and Lü was that it emboldened the world’s greedy and reckless heroes to dare usurpation and rebellion. Only the sage leaves no trace, and thus no flaw. If Yi and Lü are considered the sage’s traces, then Boyi and Shuqi are also the sage’s traces. If Boyi and Shuqi are not the sage’s traces, then the deeds of Yi and Lü are also not sagely. The sage follows the spontaneous course of things, thus leaving no trace. Therefore, what is called sagely is fundamentally traceless, and when traces are obtained, the term "sage" is forcibly applied. Thus, the sage is but a name for the traceless.)*

*(Lu Deming’s note: Some ask, "The chapter 'Abdicating the Throne' contains many passages valuing life, yet two or three worthies drowned themselves—why?" The answer: The rise of Zhuangzi’s book lies in returning to the root. The means of returning to the root takes precedence in relinquishing glory. Thus, the chapter "Abdicating the Throne" establishes the lofty aspirations of transcending the world, preventing surrender to prevent the corruption of custom, and not exalting oneself to preserve life. The occasional passages valuing life ultimately convey the intent to abandon glory. This deeply dispels the flaw of worldly affairs. Those of lesser degree wear coarse cloth and sip congee to preserve themselves, yet even this self-preservation is lofty and transcends the common. How much more so to cast oneself into the clear and cold, never yielding to the world’s entanglements?)*

】 Liu Gai’s Commentary [
To act only when unavoidable is to reject nothing; to persist when avoidable is to seize everything. Those who reject nothing verge on restraint; those who seize everything verge on recklessness. The sage, attaining the central Dao and aligning with it, deems both extremes fit for abandonment. Yet without attaining the central Dao, both fall within the realm of measured judgment.

Recklessness and restraint are indeed the corruptions of the central Dao, but later ages’ reckless ones do not merely advance and seize. They plunge into greed for life and love of profit, sinking into the abyss of desire. The restrained do not merely refrain from action; they wash their ears and cast themselves into the depths to spurn the names of Yao and Shun—this, too, is the corruption of restraint and recklessness.

Zhuangzi called abdication a name that, in the space between offering and receiving, should not be misapplied. For one who rules as a king within the realm, what matter could there be in yielding? Thus, the sage, acting only when unavoidable in governing the world, is exemplified by Wangzi Sou. When the sage reaches the point of having nothing external to trouble him, who would weary himself? Taking the world as his concern, when he attains inner selflessness, the world naturally turns to him—how could he refuse? In this light, Yao’s abdication to Shun, Tang and Wu’s conquests, Yi Yin’s service to Tang, and Boyi’s avoidance of Zhou differ not at all from those who dwell in fields and furrows.

】 A General Overview [
This chapter records the lofty integrity of those who abdicate rulership, from Yao and Shun to Xu You, Shan Juan, and Wangzi Sou—all esteemed the Dao and honored life, refusing to burden their hearts with wealth and honor, regarding the world as a worn-out sandal. Figures like Zihua, Yan He, Zeng and Yan, and Gongzi Mou preserved their authenticity and upheld simplicity, valuing wealth and honor no more than floating clouds. Among them, Wei Mou, though comparing himself to the sages as if inadequate, as a prince of a state, relinquished the exalted position of kingship to embrace the seclusion of mountain caves—this was no small feat.

Thus, the far-reaching influence of their noble winds inspired rulers to esteem the Dao and honor life, establishing the teachings of purity and non-action, and manifesting the legacy of the profound and unsullied king. Those who forget themselves and pursue external things, even when facing the slightest gain or loss, will contend over a single hair. Yet to yield a throne while occupying it is the grandest deed in the world.

Those who embrace the Dao and hold fast to virtue, entrusted by others, may not desire rulership and retreat to mountains and seas—such cases exist. Why, then, do followers like Wuze and Suiguang hastily drown themselves, forsaking their priceless bodies? It is because scholars who fail to attain the central Dao and stand alone in restraint cannot avoid corruption. The excessively greedy, insatiable in their pursuit, inevitably descend into usurpation; the excessively yielding, fleeing without refuge, inevitably drown themselves. Both stem from an excess of admiration for reputation. Only the sage, embodying the mean without corruption, yields and receives appropriately, retreats or advances with the times, and moves with ease in the central Dao—Yao and Shun’s deeds exemplify this.

Boyi and Shuqi yielded their kingdom and fled to Shouyang, subsisting on ferns and bracken until their end—this was not a deliberate display of defiance or pursuit of posthumous fame. For one who yields while already a ruler, the act is conspicuous; for one who avoids rulership before ascending, the act is concealed. The intent to withdraw is the same; only the timing differs.

】 "Robber Zhi" Chapter Twenty-Nine

Confucius and Liuxia Ji were friends. Liuxia Ji’s younger brother was named Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi led a band of nine thousand men, rampaging across the world, assaulting the feudal lords, breaking into chambers and smashing doors, driving off people’s oxen and horses, seizing their wives and daughters. Greedy for gain, he forgot his kin, disregarded his parents and brothers, and neglected to sacrifice to his ancestors. Wherever he passed, the great states fortified their cities, the small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the common people suffered greatly.

Confucius said to Liuxia Ji, “As a father, one must be able to instruct his son; as an elder brother, one must be able to teach his younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is of no worth. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your younger brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge to the world, and you cannot teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and admonish him on your behalf.”

Liuxia Ji replied, “You say that a father must instruct his son, and an elder brother must teach his younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, what can even your eloquence do? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind surges like a spring, his will sweeps like the wind. His strength is sufficient to resist enemies, his eloquence sufficient to gloss over wrongs. When his heart is pleased, he is joyful; when it is crossed, he rages. He is quick to insult others with words. You must not go.”

Confucius did not listen. With Yan Hui driving the carriage and Zigong at his right, he went to see Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was then resting with his followers on the southern slope of Mount Tai, mincing human livers for his meal. Confucius alighted from the carriage and approached, saying to the attendant, “I, Kong Qiu of Lu, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and respectfully bow twice in greeting.” The attendant went in to announce him.

When Robber Zhi heard this, he flew into a great rage, his eyes blazing like stars, his hair bristling beneath his cap. “Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kong Qiu of Lu?” he said. “Tell him for me: you fabricate words, concoct phrases, falsely invoking the names of Kings Wen and Wu. You wear a cap like a tree’s branches and a belt of dead oxhide. You prattle endlessly, weaving lies, neither plowing to eat nor weaving to clothe yourself. You flap your lips and wag your tongue, creating right and wrong to delude the rulers of the world, causing the scholars of the world to abandon their roots and recklessly fabricate filial piety and brotherly respect, hoping to gain enfeoffment and riches. Your crimes are great and grave. Flee at once, or I will add your liver to my midday meal.”

Confucius again sent word, saying, “I am fortunate to be acquainted with Ji and wish to gaze upon the hem of your robe.” The attendant went in again to announce him.

Robber Zhi said, “Bring him forward.” Confucius hastened forward, avoided the mat, stepped back, and bowed twice. Robber Zhi, greatly enraged, stretched out his legs, rested his hand on his sword, glared like a nursing tiger, and roared, “Qiu, come forward! If your words please me, you will live; if they oppose me, you will die.”

Confucius said, “I have heard that there are three virtues in the world. To be born tall and large, handsome and peerless, so that young and old, noble and base all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend heaven and earth and to distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be brave, resolute, and daring, gathering followers and leading troops—this is the lowest virtue.”

“Any man possessing even one of these virtues is fit to face south and style himself a lord. Now, General, you combine all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches, your face and eyes radiant, your lips bright as cinnabar, your teeth even as strung cowries, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell—yet you are called Robber Zhi. I, for one, feel shame on your behalf. If you are willing to heed me, I shall journey south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, west to Jin and Chu, to build for you a great city of several hundred *li*, establish a metropolis of several hundred thousand households, and honor you as a feudal lord. Together we shall renew the world, disband your troops, rest your soldiers, gather and nurture your brothers, and jointly sacrifice to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, and the desire of all under heaven.”

Robber Zhi flew into a rage and said, “Qiu, come forward! Those who can be swayed by profit and admonished by words are but the foolish, common folk. Now, my great stature and beauty, which all who see delight in—are these not the legacy of my parents’ virtue? Though you do not praise me, do I not know myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who love to flatter others to their face also love to slander them behind their back. Now you tell me of great cities and teeming subjects—this is to lure me with profit and treat me as livestock. How can such things last? Of all great cities, none is greater than...”

“The world is vast indeed! Yao and Shun possessed all under heaven, yet their descendants had not even a pin’s land to stand on. Tang and Wu established themselves as Sons of Heaven, yet their posterity was cut off—was this not because the profit was too great? Moreover, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and people few, so all dwelt in nests to avoid them: by day they gathered acorns and chestnuts, by night they roosted in trees, and thus they were called the people of the Nest Builder. In those days, people knew not clothing; in summer they piled up firewood, in winter they burned it for warmth, and thus they were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease and rose without care; they knew their mothers but not their fathers, and lived among the deer and elk. They plowed to eat and wove to clothe themselves, with no thought of harming one another—this was the height of perfect virtue. Yet even the Yellow Emperor could not fully realize virtue: he fought Chiyou on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred li. Yao and Shun arose and appointed ministers; Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu killed Zhou. From that time onward, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many bullied the few. From Tang and Wu down, all have been the kind who bring chaos.

Now you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s debates, and teach posterity. You wear fine robes and narrow sashes, speak with artful words and feign virtuous conduct to delude the lords of the world, all to seek wealth and honor. There is no greater thief than you! Why does the world call me Robber Zhi and not call you Robber Qiu? You sweet-talked Zilu into following you, making him cast off his warrior’s cap and lay down his long sword to receive your teachings. The world says Confucius can stop violence and forbid wrongdoing—yet in the end, it was not so. Zilu wanted to kill the lord of Wei, but the plan failed, and his body was pickled above the eastern gate of Wei. This was the result of your inadequate teaching!

Do you call yourself a man of talent and a sage? Then why were you twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and left with no place in the world? You taught Zilu to meet such a fate—above, you brought no benefit to yourself; below, you brought none to others. Is your Way truly worthy of esteem? Of those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor, yet even he could not preserve his virtue intact: he fought on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred li. Yao was not kind, Shun was not filial, Yu was paralyzed on one side, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned in Youli. These six men are those the world exalts—yet upon examination, all were deluded by profit, forcing their true nature into false paths. Their conduct is truly shameful!

The world calls Boyi and Shuqi worthy men: they renounced the lordship of Gubuzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their flesh and bones left unburied. Baofu adorned his conduct to criticize the age and died clinging to a tree. Shentu Di admonished his lord and, when unheeded, carried a stone into the river to be eaten by fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was the very model of loyalty: he cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Duke Wen, yet later the duke betrayed him. Enraged, Zitui left and burned to death holding a tree. Weisheng made a tryst with a woman beneath a bridge; when she did not come and the waters rose, he would not leave but held fast to the bridge pillar and drowned. These four were no different from dismembered dogs or drifting pigs; like beggars clutching gourd ladles, they courted fame, scorned life, and forgot the root of nurturing their allotted span.

The world calls none more loyal than Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, and Bigan had his heart cut out—these two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end they were laughed at by all under heaven. From a higher perspective, even Zixu and Bigan are not worthy of esteem. As for what you praise to me: if you speak of spirits and ghosts, I cannot know it; if you speak of human affairs, it is no more than this—all of which I have heard and understood. Now let me tell you of human nature: the eye desires to see beauty, the ear...”

The ear desires to hear sounds, the mouth to taste flavors, and the will and qi seek fulfillment. The long-lived reach a hundred years, the middling eighty, the short-lived sixty—yet within this span, discounting illness, emaciation, death, mourning, and sorrow, the days one opens their mouth to laugh number no more than four or five in a month.

Heaven and earth are without end, but human death comes at its appointed time. Grasping the implements of this fleeting span and entrusting oneself to the boundless, one vanishes in an instant—no different from a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall. Those who cannot fulfill their aspirations and nurture their allotted years are not masters of the Dao.

All that you, Qiu, have spoken of is what I reject. Leave quickly, return home, and speak no more of it. Your Way is but a frenzied, grasping, deceitful, and hollow affair—it cannot preserve the genuine. What is there to discuss?

Confucius bowed twice, hurried out the door, mounted his carriage, and took up the reins. Three times he fumbled them, his eyes dazed and sightless, his complexion ashen like dead embers. Leaning against the crossbar, he lowered his head and could scarcely breathe. Upon returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he encountered Liuxia Ji.

Liuxia Ji said, "For days now, you have been absent, and your carriage bears the marks of travel. Might you have gone to see Zhi?"

Confucius looked to the heavens and sighed. "Indeed."

Liuxia Ji said, "Did Zhi not offend you as before?"

Confucius said, "Yes. What I did was like needlessly cauterizing oneself—racing to measure a tiger’s head, weaving through its whiskers, nearly escaping not from its jaws!"

---

Zizhang asked Mangoude, "Why not act? Without action, one is not trusted; without trust, one is not employed; without employment, one gains no benefit. Thus, when one observes fame and calculates profit, righteousness is truly in them. If one abandons fame and profit and turns inward, then how can a scholar’s conduct be absent for even a day?"

Mangoude said, "The shameless grow rich, and the trusted become eminent. The greatest of fame and profit lie in shamelessness and trust. Thus, when one observes fame and calculates profit, trust is truly in them. If one abandons fame and profit and turns inward, then a scholar’s conduct embraces their Heaven-given nature."

Zizhang said, "In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under heaven. Yet if one told a slave or servant, ‘Your conduct resembles Jie or Zhou,’ they would flush with shame and bristle with indignation—such is the disdain of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di were impoverished commoners, yet if one told a minister, ‘Your conduct resembles Confucius or Mo Di,’ they would change countenance and protest their inadequacy—such is the esteem of true scholars. Thus, to be a Son of Heaven is not necessarily noble, nor is poverty as a commoner necessarily base. Noble or base lies in the beauty or ugliness of one’s conduct."

Mangoude said, "Petty thieves are imprisoned, while great thieves become lords. At the gates of lords, righteous scholars reside. In the past, Duke Huan of Qi killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. In speech, they condemned such acts; in conduct, they deferred to them—is this not a clash of principles in their hearts? Is it not perverse?

Thus, the *Book* says: ‘Who is evil? Who is good? The successful are heads; the failed are tails.’"

Zizhang said, "If you do not act, then kinship will lack order, noble and base will lack distinction, and seniority and precedence will lack sequence. How then can the Five Constants and Six Positions be differentiated?"

Mangoude said, "Yao killed his eldest son, and Shun exiled his younger brother—where is the order in kinship? Tang exiled Jie, and King Wu killed Zhou—where is the distinction in noble and base? King Ji was made heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—where is the sequence in seniority? The Confucians preach hypocritical words, and the Mohists advocate universal love—how can the Five Constants and Six Positions be differentiated?

Moreover, you rectify for fame, and I rectify for profit. In substance, fame and profit do not accord with principle or reflect the Dao. Daily, I dispute with you before Wu Yue, saying: ‘The petty man pursues wealth; the gentleman pursues fame.’ Though their motives differ and their natures change, when it comes to abandoning what they do and dying for what they do not, they are the same.

Thus it is said: ‘Do not act as a petty man; instead, die for what you do not, and Heaven will be without action. Act as a gentleman, following Heaven’s principle.’ Whether crooked or straight, they serve as Heaven’s limit. Observe the four directions, and move with the times. Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, and your intent will wander with the Dao. Without turning, act; without achieving, embody righteousness. Lose what you do, and you will not hasten to wealth; do not pursue, and you will not achieve. Abandon these, and you will align with Heaven.

Bigan had his heart cut out, and Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged—these were the calamities of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, and Weisheng drowned—these were the perils of trust. Bao Jiao stood as a pole and starved, and Shenzi refused to defend himself—these were the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, and Kuangzi did not see his father—these were the failures of righteousness. These are what the ancients lamented and later ages recount as lessons for scholars. Rectify your words and align your conduct, and you will suffer their misfortunes and encounter their woes."

The Guo commentary states: "This chapter speaks of exalting conduct, yet conduct becomes artificial; honoring scholars, yet scholars become false. Thus, one must despise conduct and belittle scholars to preserve one’s inner integrity—only then will conduct be lofty and scholars esteemed."

The Lü commentary states: "Good and evil stand opposed, so Confucius could not transform Robber Zhi. Fame and profit stand opposed, so Zizhang could not subdue the man of base gain. The man of base gain is one who litigates with Wu Yue—Zizhang studied to seek office, thus knowing fame; the man of base gain knows profit. Wu Yue embodied the Dao and was trustworthy. Those who do evil and pursue profit, the world calls petty men; those who do good and seek fame, the world calls noble men—this is speaking in terms of the human Dao. In terms of the Heavenly Dao, the noble man of men is the petty man of Heaven. If one follows Heaven and adheres to its principle, then noble and petty men cannot be distinguished. Crooked and straight are seen in Heaven’s center; observing the four directions and moving with the seasons, even the center is not held as fixed—this is why the Dao pervades all six directions and opens the four gates, existing everywhere without absence. Right and wrong are one; clinging to nothing, the round mechanism responds to all. Standing alone, the mind wanders with the Dao, then hesitation arises in affairs, and success is achieved in every instance. All such things are how one reaches Heaven without turning, acts without achieving, and aligns with Heaven by abandoning. This is what it means to preserve one’s Heavenly nature without letting men obstruct Heaven’s principle.

Loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and righteousness—what the world calls fame and goodness—yet all suffer calamity. People know only that profit and evil are burdens but do not realize that fame and goodness are also not the Dao. Thus, Wu Yue’s argument weighs heavily upon them."

The humble opinion states: "The two commentators’ views remain unresolved, so the man of base gain once debated with Wu Yue. Petty men pursue wealth to the end of the chapter, where Wu Yue’s words appear—both men clung to one side and did not accord with the Dao. Better to forget good and evil entirely, cling to nothing, and follow nature. Without divisions of noble and petty men, each attains the correctness of their nature and disposition. What need is there for distinctions of crooked and straight, inner and outer, right and wrong? Standing alone without being entangled by things, one wanders with the Dao without loss. If one alters natural conduct to seek the fame of righteousness or pursues wealth and profit hoping for achievement, one abandons and extinguishes Heavenly principle, drowning in the desires of things."

Wu Zu asked Zhi He: "Among men, none do not strive for fame and pursue profit. The wealthy attract followers; followers become subordinates; subordinates are honored. Those who see subordinates honored possess the way of long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment. Why do you alone have no such intention? Is your knowledge insufficient? Do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you deliberately uphold correctness without forgetting?"

Zhi He said: "Now, such men regard those born in the same era and dwelling in the same village as themselves, believing them to be those who transcend custom and surpass the world. They lack a fixed standard, thus surveying the times of past and present and the divisions of right and wrong. They adapt to custom and transform with the age, abandoning what is most weighty and discarding what is most honorable to pursue their own ends. How can their discussion of the way of long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment not be far off? The pain of sorrowful illness and the peace of serene joy are not reflected in the body; the fear of alarm and the delight of happiness are not mirrored in the heart. Knowing to act but not knowing why one acts—this is why one may be honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven yet still not escape suffering."

Wu Zu said: "Wealth brings every advantage to men, exhausting beauty and perfecting power—what men cannot attain, what even sages cannot reach. Harnessing others’ courage and strength to create might, wielding others’ wisdom and plans to achieve clarity, relying on others’ virtue to become worthy—without enjoying a state’s rule, one is revered as sternly as a lord and father. Moreover, the allure of sounds, sights, flavors, and power over men’s hearts brings joy without need of learning, and the body finds comfort without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, avoidance and pursuit—these are inherent in human nature. Though all under Heaven oppose me, who can reject them?"

Zhi He said: "The wise act for a reason, moving with the people without violating their measure. Thus, they are content and do not contend; having no purpose, they do not seek. Not being content, they seek and contend, occupying all four quarters yet not considering themselves greedy. Having surplus, they decline it, abandoning all under Heaven yet not considering themselves incorrupt. The reality of incorruptibility and greed does not come from external pressure but from reflecting within and observing the measure. As Son of Heaven, one does not use nobility to arrogantly overbear others; possessing all under Heaven, one does not use wealth to toy with others. Calculating their troubles and considering the consequences, they see these as harmful to their nature, thus declining and not accepting—not to seek fame and reputation. Yao and Shun ruled as emperors yet were not harmonious, for benevolence does not benefit all under Heaven. They did not allow beauty to harm life. Shan Juan and Xu You declined the throne, not with empty words of yielding but to avoid letting affairs harm themselves. Both accepted benefit and declined harm, and all under Heaven called them worthy—yet they did not do so to seek fame and reputation."

Wu Zu said: "If one must endure hardship in name, torment the body, reject sweetness, and restrict nourishment to preserve life, one will long suffer illness and hardship without dying."

Zhi He said: "Levelness brings fortune; excess brings harm—nothing does not follow this principle, and wealth is the most extreme case. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the taste of fine meats and fine wines, disturbing his mind and causing him to neglect his affairs—this can be called chaos. Obstructed and drowned in pent-up qi, he bears a heavy burden climbing upward—this can be called suffering. Greedy for wealth, he seeks comfort; greedy for power, he seeks exhaustion. At rest, he drowns in bodily ease; in comfort, he is obstructed—this can be called illness. Pursuing wealth and profit, his ears are filled like a wall, yet he does not know to avoid obstruction and does not cease—this can be called disgrace. Wealth accumulates without use; it burdens the heart and does not leave. The mind is anxious and distressed, seeking more without end—this can be called worry. Within, he fears the threats of robbers and extortion; without, he dreads the harm of bandits and thieves. Inside, he fortifies towers and bars gates; outside, he does not dare walk alone—this can be called fear. These six are the greatest harms under Heaven. All are forgotten and unexamined, and when calamity strikes, one seeks to exhaust one’s nature and deplete one’s wealth, returning to a single day’s freedom from trouble—but it cannot be obtained. Thus, observing fame, one sees nothing; seeking profit, one gains nothing. Entangling the mind and severing the body to contend for these—is this not delusion?"

[The note on "knowledge insufficient" asks: "Is it because knowledge and strength are insufficient that one does not act? Or is it simply that one pursues the correct Dao without forgetting, thus not acting? *Feng qi* refers to pent-up, obstructed qi."]

Those who "fortify towers within and bar gates without" speak of encircling inner towers with layered defenses and opening outer pavilions for communication—this is called establishing defenses.

Guo’s annotation: *This chapter speaks of those who know contentment as ever-content.*

Lü’s annotation: *To take insufficiency as wealth is to be seen as base and esteemed as noble—this is the Way of securing the body and delighting the mind. Those who know harmony as wealth dwell together in the same life and same village, yet the world invariably esteems the base and noble. From this, it is clear that their minds lack mastery. To abandon what is most weighty and most honorable, following the ways of the world, and losing the true nature of life and destiny—this is called securing the body and delighting the mind, yet it is far off the mark. Grief and joy do not reflect in the body; fear and delight do not reflect in the mind. Then one knows acting for the sake of acting but not knowing why one acts—this is what was meant by "shooting a thousand-yard sparrow with the Marquis of Sui’s pearl." Even those of utmost wealth and nobility cannot escape suffering; how much less can those content with mere possessions, who take insufficiency as wealth? This is the nature of all people—who can refuse it? Those who know harmony yet remain discontent cannot yield their boundaries, thus contending in all directions without considering it greed. Those who know contentment take nothing in the world as their own, thus abandoning the world without considering it integrity. The reality of integrity and greed merely reflects the measure of one’s capacity—yet capacity, like vessels of varying sizes, differs among people. To claim this as the nature of all is incorrect.*

*Drowning in pent-up qi* speaks of relying on abundant resources, where one’s qi becomes arrogant and the body overflows with moisture—this is called *feng*, where the body is glossy yet one does not know how to preserve life. To such an extreme does wealth bring harm, and thus it ends.

Observing fame, one sees nothing; seeking profit, one gains nothing. Yet people entangle their minds and sever their bodies to contend for these—this is what was meant by "knowing to act for the sake of acting but not knowing why one acts." Confucius could not transform Robber Zhi; Zizhang could not tame Longfu. "Seeking gain, seeking gain"—to take what is right without restraint, to be humbled by knowing harmony—shows that good and evil, fame and profit, are insufficient to overcome one another. Only virtue and the Dao are sufficient to overcome them.

Nothing is more weighty than the body, yet nothing is more weighty than life. Now, people conform to世俗 conventions, drifting away from what is truly weighty, discarding reverence to pursue their own ends—how then can they discuss the Dao of preserving the body and delighting the mind? How could they draw near to it? In poverty and lowliness, they tremble with fear; in wealth and nobility, they rejoice with elation—this is to obscure the root and boast of mere traces.

Those who act for the sake of acting strive for fame and pursue profit, yet do not know that wealth and nobility arise of themselves. To abandon what arises of itself and desire to strive for them is to know that one cannot escape [the consequences]. The ants in a mound of dirt gather only around rank odors; scholars who cover their faces in shame scorn even the offer of food. Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; people forget one another in the Dao and its arts—what need is there to rely on external things? Why cling to them?

Those who indulge without restraint delight in music and beauty; those who are arrogant and extravagant find comfort in power and influence—this is human nature. Who does not desire these? Yet when the common people act, it is not for themselves. Not transgressing their measure, reducing selfishness, and diminishing desires—those who contend on all sides speak of campaigning in the four directions, their aim being to pacify the people, not to profit from treasures. Thus, they are not deemed greedy. When their achievements are complete and their fame established, they abdicate in favor of the worthy—neither do they consider themselves paragons of integrity.

Prince Sou fled into the cinnabar caves; Yan He fed oxen and declined official appointments—did they seek fame and reputation? Shun offered the world to Shan Juan, yet Shan Juan plowed on without a glance—did he strive for fame and reputation?

The greedy and rapacious regard tranquility and simplicity as affliction, solitude as distress, unaware that ease is fortune and excess is harm. Wealth brings swift disaster, more grievous than other things, yet the世俗 world does not awaken to this. From the perspective of those who embody tranquility and solitude, bells and drums, fine wine and rich food lead to the ruin of the Dao and its works. Those who seek comfort in power and influence drown in bodily illness; those who snatch gold without regard suffer more than execution or humiliation. Hoarding without satiety, their anxieties and fears never cease—once disaster strikes and their bodies are overthrown, they wish only for their accumulated wealth to be quickly exhausted.

At such a time, their true nature is already exhausted, their goods and wealth already depleted. They long to release hawks on the plains of Cai or hear the cries of cranes in Huating—how could these ever be regained?

Yang Yongxiu’s commentary:
*Chén nì yú féng qì* (侅溺于冯气): The old annotation reads, "From eating and drinking to swallowing is *chén*; *féng* means fullness, as in 'swollen with arrogance.'" However, *féng* should be pronounced as in *féng hé* (冯河, "crossing the river"), for the wealthy accumulate resources as if bearing a heavy burden—already difficult, yet they proceed further, making it even more arduous. Thus, it is said, "This can truly be called suffering." Below, "In stillness, one drowns; in glossiness, one is full" further explains *chén nì yú féng qì*. In stillness, one drowns—indulgence is like poison, deluded by music and beauty, sinking without water. Thus, it is said, "Drowning." *Tǐ zé zé féng* (体泽则冯) means bustling about like one crossing a river on foot, only to sink into the nine depths. Thus, it is said, *féng*—why must it be read as "arrogance"?

Liu Gai’s general discussion:
In the world, there is no inherent right or wrong—right and wrong arise from human emotions. Yet in the world, there *is* right and wrong, and right and wrong dissolve in human nature. The virtue of affirming is auspicious; the virtue of negating is inauspicious. The *Yi* says, "Auspicious and inauspicious are the triumph of correctness." Those who cannot guard correctness and equalize forgetfulness, yet entangle themselves in the realm of action—each thing values itself and devalues others. Who can settle this? Thus, even the distinction between Confucius and Robber Zhi becomes a matter of calling one another thieves.

Zhuangzi was not ignorant of the need to honor Confucius and despise Robber Zhi. Yet because世俗 people do not awaken to the principle of equalizing forgetfulness, they contend with knowledge, boast of ability, and if one further indulges emotions to honor them, right and wrong become even more pronounced, and the true nature of life and destiny grows ever more chaotic. Therefore, he borrowed what the world universally condemns to describe its self-righteous emotions—even a sage could not prevail in debate. Thus, the final chapter deems Zizhang’s words inappropriate and concludes with the discourse on "knowing harmony."

**Records of Cinnabar and Lead**

Shao Yaofu remarked: "In the *Robber Zhi* chapter of the *Zhuangzi*, matters of utter helplessness—even a sage can do nothing about them. Though the cook does not prepare the feast, the invocator does not presume to take his place beyond the wine vessels and sacrificial stands. This speaks to the gentleman’s thought never straying beyond his station."

Yang Zhongli observed: "The *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter embodies what Zisi called ‘the gentleman finds fulfillment in every circumstance.’ The *Preserving Life’s Integrity* chapter reflects what Mencius meant by ‘acting without contrivance.’ If one reads the *Zhuangzi* with this understanding, one may discuss the Nine Schools with those of perfect discernment. Those who fault the *Zhuangzi* simply do not read it well."

**Chapter Thirty: The Sword Banquet**

Long ago, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Over three thousand swordsmen lodged as guests at his gates, clashing before him day and night. Each year, more than a hundred died or were wounded, yet his passion never waned. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against him. The crown prince, Kui, grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: "Whoever can please the king and put an end to the swordsmen will receive a thousand gold pieces."

His attendants said, "Zhuangzi is the one for this."

The crown prince sent envoys bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi, but he refused. Accompanying the envoys back, he asked the crown prince, "What instruction do you have for me, that you bestow a thousand gold pieces upon me?"

The crown prince replied, "I have heard that you are enlightened and sagely. I humbly offer this thousand gold as a gift for your attendants. Since you refuse it, how dare I speak further?"

Zhuangzi said, "I have heard that you wish to employ me to dissuade the king from his obsession. If I were to admonish the king and offend him, failing to meet your expectations, I would face execution. How then could I make use of the gold? But if I satisfy the king above and meet your wishes below, what in Zhao could I not obtain?"

The crown prince said, "Indeed. Yet my father sees only swordsmen."

Zhuangzi replied, "Very well. I am skilled in the sword."

The crown prince said, "But the swordsmen my father sees all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, slouching caps with coarse tassels, short jackets, glaring eyes, and speak with difficulty. The king delights in them. If you, sir, appear before him in Confucian robes, the matter will surely go awry."

Zhuangzi said, "Allow me to prepare my sword attire."

After three days, he completed his sword attire and met the crown prince, who then accompanied him to see the king. The king, bare blade in hand, awaited him.

Zhuangzi entered the palace hall without haste and did not bow to the king. The king asked, "What would you teach me, that you have the crown prince precede you?"

Zhuangzi replied, "I have heard that Your Majesty delights in the sword, so I have come to present my swordsmanship."

The king asked, "What can your sword do?"

Zhuangzi said, "My sword can cut down one man every ten paces and travel a thousand *li* without hindrance."

The king, greatly pleased, exclaimed, "You would be invincible in the world!"

Zhuangzi said, "The way of the sword is to show emptiness, offer advantage, strike after the opponent moves, and arrive before he does. I would like to demonstrate."

The king said, "Sir, rest at your lodging and await my command. I will arrange a contest and summon you."

The king then tested his swordsmen for seven days, during which over sixty died or were wounded. He selected five or six and had them stand with their swords in the palace courtyard, then summoned Zhuangzi.

"Today, let us see these gentlemen engage in swordplay," the king said.

Zhuangzi replied, "I have longed for this."

The king asked, "Sir, what length of weapon do you wield?"

Zhuangzi said, "Any length will do, but I have three swords, and Your Majesty may choose which to use. Allow me to describe them before demonstrating."

The king said, "I wish to hear of the three swords."

Zhuangzi said, "There is the Son of Heaven’s sword, the feudal lord’s sword, and the commoner’s sword."

The king asked, "What is the Son of Heaven’s sword like?"

Zhuangzi said, "The Son of Heaven’s sword has Yanxi and Shicheng as its point, Mount Tai of Qi as its edge, Jin and Wei as its spine, Zhou and Song as its hilt, and Han and Wei as its guard. It is wrapped in the Four Barbarians, bound by the Four Seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Chang. It is governed by the Five Phases, judged by punishment and virtue, opened by yin and yang, sustained by spring and summer, and wielded in autumn and winter. When thrust forward, nothing stands before it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. When this sword is used once, it rectifies the feudal lords, and the world submits. This is the Son of Heaven’s sword."

King Wen, lost in thought, asked, "What is the feudal lord’s sword like?"

Zhuangzi said, "The feudal lord’s sword has the wise and brave as its point, the pure and incorrupt as its edge, the worthy and good as its spine, the loyal and sagely as its hilt, and the heroic and outstanding as its guard. When thrust forward, nothing stands before it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it models the round heavens, following the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth, following the Four Seasons. Within, it harmonizes the people’s will and brings peace to the four directions. When this sword is used once, it is like the shock of thunder. Within the four borders, none dare resist; all obey the ruler’s command. This is the feudal lord’s sword."

The king asked, "What is the commoner’s sword like?"

Zhuangzi said, "The commoner’s sword is wielded by those with unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, slouching caps with coarse tassels, short jackets, glaring eyes, and harsh speech. They clash before you, striking above at necks and throats, below at livers and lungs. This is no different from fighting cocks—one morning, their lives are cut short, and they are of no use to the state. Now, Your Majesty occupies the position of Son of Heaven yet delights in the commoner’s sword. I humbly deem this unworthy of you."

The king then led Zhuangzi up to the hall, where the royal chef served the feast. The king circled the table three times.

Zhuangzi said, "Your Majesty, sit calmly and compose yourself. The matter of the sword is concluded."

Thereafter, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all died by their own hands in their lodgings.

The mouth of the sword is called the *tan*; the hilt is called the *jia*. One account says: the *tan* follows the ridge toward the spine, while the *jia* follows the ridge toward the blade. The "three circuits" refer to King Wen’s shame upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words—he circled the feast twice but could not sit to eat. "Serving and perishing" means that, enraged at not being shown courtesy, the swordsmen all took their own lives.

Lu’s Commentary:
Zhuangzi’s conduct and aspirations were to drag his tail through the mud rather than become a sacrificial beast in the grand ancestral temple. To awaken the world from its perilous custom of risking life for mere objects, the art of the sword was perhaps unheard of—yet he borrowed it to illustrate that the Dao’s application knows no bounds. If one can curb a ruler’s obsessions and secure a state’s stability, the blessings bestowed are no small matter.

The Son of Heaven’s sword takes all under Heaven as its blade. This is to say: the divine instrument of all under Heaven cannot be wielded lightly. He demonstrates its emptiness, opens with advantage, follows with what comes after, and initiates with what precedes—thus employing the way of the divine instrument. Though it "cannot be wielded," one wields it nonetheless. To know its root and branches, its weight and measure, the method of its governance, and the moment of its application is to wield it so that all under Heaven submits.

From Yanxi and Mount Tai to the Bohai Sea and Mount Heng—this illustrates the Son of Heaven’s sword, which takes all under Heaven as its blade. From the Five Phases and the balance of punishment and virtue to the severing of earth’s ties—this illustrates the timeless, boundless nature of the divine. Only a spirit-like person can master the divine instrument, thus rectifying the feudal lords and bringing all under Heaven to submission. Such was Zhuangzi’s way of the sword. King Wen, upon hearing this, was struck dumb with realization, knowing his own fondness was not for the true sword.

The feudal lords’ sword takes a single state as its blade, hence it is spoken of in terms of the *shi* (knight). The *shi* is the people’s hope. Courage and valor lead the way, thus forming the tip. Integrity and uprightness follow, thus forming the edge. Worthiness and excellence lean upon it, thus forming the spine. Loyalty and sagacity are planted within, thus forming the *tan*. The heroic and outstanding are what one grasps and employs, thus forming the *jia*. For those who govern a state, observing what serves as tip, edge, spine, *tan*, and *jia*—whether they align or not—reveals whether the weapon is sharp or dull, and whether the state is secure or imperiled.

Though the scale of all under Heaven and a single state differs, the spirit in which they are wielded is one and the same. When asked about the commoner’s sword, Zhuangzi directly pointed to the king’s own predilection to correct his error.

Liu’s Summary:
In the nature of all things under Heaven, none do not disparage the different while revering the same, discard the small while admiring the great—even to the point of shunning harm and pursuing profit, which is often the case. If something does not align with oneself, though advantageous, it is not followed; though the benefit be great, it is not admired.

Zhuangzi’s discourse on the Dao in this chapter, extending even to the words of swordsmen and wandering persuaders, conceals profound principles in subtle allusions, necessarily employing such language to achieve his aim. The nature of things inherently values the self and devalues others, naturally affirms the self and negates others. To seek unity with others despite such differences—even the sagacity of Confucius would bow before the brutality of Robber Zhi.

Yet by leveraging what is shared to overcome others, Zhuangzi’s single remark severed King Zhao’s lifelong obsession—this was indeed the principle at work. The bristling sideburns, slouching caps, coarse tassels, short jackets, glaring eyes, and harsh speech were the king’s preferences, not Zhuangzi’s. Now, by altering his usual demeanor and changing his usual attire, the king would come to respect what he had once disdained.

First discussing the Son of Heaven, then the feudal lords, and finally the commoner, the king would come to admire what was grand. Grandness commands all under Heaven; next, it welcomes the four borders; below, it severs necks and throats—he would thus pursue what was advantageous. The nature of things does not extend beyond this. The sage harmonizes and responds, nurturing things as one rears creatures. Thus, the multitude of monkeys submitted to the morning-four, evening-three trick—was there not a method to this?

As for bending oneself without ever straightening another—Zhuangzi’s persuasion through the sword seems to seek alignment. Yet even Robber Zhi and the Fisherman were not his true concerns. The grand intent of his words was mutual critique, though the principle was subtle. To press for traces and seek meaning is to misunderstand the speaker.

The Fisherman, Chapter Thirty-One

Confucius wandered in the forest of black curtains and rested, seated upon the Apricot Platform. His disciples read aloud while Confucius hummed a tune, plucking the zither. Halfway through the melody, a fisherman descended from his boat and approached. His beard and brows were snowy white, his hair unbound, and his sleeves swaying as he strode across the plain until he reached the shore. There he halted, his left hand resting on his knee, his right hand cradling his chin, listening to the music. When the piece ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong. Both stepped forward to face the stranger, who pointed at Confucius and asked, “What manner of man is he?”

Zilu replied, “A gentleman of Lu.”

The stranger inquired about his lineage, and Zilu answered, “The Kong clan.”

“And what does the Kong clan govern?”

Zilu did not respond, but Zigong answered, “The Kong clan cultivates loyalty and trust in their nature, embodies benevolence and righteousness in their conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects proper human relations. Above, they serve the lords of the age with loyalty; below, they transform the common people. They seek to benefit all under Heaven—this is what the Kong clan governs.”

The stranger asked again, “Is he a lord with lands?”

Zigong said, “No.”

“Is he an advisor to kings and princes?”

Zigong said, “No.”

The stranger laughed and turned to leave, saying as he walked, “Benevolent, indeed, he is—but I fear he will not escape suffering. His heart toils, his form labors, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far removed he is from the Dao!”

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, “Was he a sage?” He then descended to seek him, reaching the marsh’s edge, where the stranger was poised to pole his boat away. Turning, he saw Confucius and stood facing his homeland. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and approached, saying, “What do you seek, Master?”

The stranger replied, “A moment ago, you left with words unfinished. I, unworthy as I am, did not grasp their meaning. I have waited humbly below, hoping to hear the sound of your cough or whisper, that I might fully assist you.”

The stranger said, “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “From my youth, I have cultivated learning, and now, at sixty-nine, I have yet to hear the ultimate teaching. How dare I not empty my heart?”

The stranger said, “Like seeks like, and sounds resonate in harmony—this is the principle of Heaven. I shall set aside what I possess and expound for you the Way of your endeavor. Your endeavor is human affairs. The Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the great officers, and the common people—these four ranks, when properly ordered, bring the finest governance. When these four depart from their stations, no greater disorder arises. When offices fulfill their duties and people attend to their tasks, none encroach upon another. Thus, fields are tilled, homes stand firm, clothing and food suffice, taxes are not levied unjustly, wives and concubines live in harmony, and elders and youth observe proper order—these are the concerns of the common people. Inability to bear office, failure to govern, impure conduct, subordinates’ negligence, unrecognized merit, and unheld ranks and emoluments—these are the concerns of the great officers. The court lacking loyal ministers, the state in chaos, craftsmen’s work unskillful, tribute unworthy, the seasons out of sequence, and the Son of Heaven and feudal lords disobeying Heaven’s order—these are the concerns of the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords. Yin and yang out of harmony, cold and heat untimely, harming the myriad things, feudal lords violent and usurping, waging war to devastate the people, ritual and music unrestrained, resources exhausted, human relations disordered, and the hundred clans licentious—these are the concerns of the Son of Heaven’s ministers.

Now, you possess neither the authority of a lord or minister above nor the office of a great officer below, yet you presume to regulate ritual and music, select human relations, and transform the common people. Is this not excessive meddling? Moreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these must not go unexamined.

To engage in affairs not one’s own is called *zong*; to advance without regard is called *ning*; to speak to curry favor is called *chan*; to speak without discerning right or wrong is called *yu*; to delight in others’ faults is called *chan*; to sever bonds and estrange kin is called *zei*; to praise falsely and corrupt others is called *te*; to fail to choose good or ill, to accommodate both sides, and to stealthily seize what one desires is called *xian*. These eight flaws externally disorder others and internally harm oneself. The noble person does not befriend such, and the enlightened lord does not employ them.

The four perils are: to love managing great affairs, altering constants to claim merit, is called *tao*; to monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, encroach upon others, and act self-righteously is called *tan*; to see faults yet not change, to hear admonitions yet grow worse, is called *hen*; to approve of what aligns with oneself yet disapprove of what does not, even if good, is called *jin*. These are the four perils. Only when one has removed the eight flaws and refrained from the four perils can one be taught.”

Confucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying, “I was twice driven from Lu, my traces erased in Wei, my tree felled in Song, and I was besieged between Chen and Cai. I do not know what I have lost to incur these four slanders—what is it?”

The stranger’s expression turned somber as he said, “How difficult it is for you to awaken!”

A man feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, so he fled from them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints appeared; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing himself still too slow, he ran without rest, exhausted his strength, and died—never realizing that if he had stood in shade, his shadow would have vanished, or if he had remained still, his footprints would have ceased. How utterly foolish!

You scrutinize the boundaries between benevolence and righteousness, examine the distinctions between sameness and difference, observe the shifts between movement and stillness, measure the degrees of giving and receiving, weigh the inclinations of likes and dislikes, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you still nearly fail to escape. If you diligently cultivate yourself, guard your true nature with care, and return things to others, you will have no encumbrances.

Now, if you do not cultivate yourself but seek it from others, is this not misplaced?

Confucius, with a solemn expression, said, “May I ask what is meant by *true*?”

The stranger replied, “*True* is the utmost of essence and sincerity. Without essence and sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though stern, is not awe-inspiring; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is mournful without sound; true anger is awe-inspiring before it erupts; true affection is harmonious before it smiles. When truth resides within, the spirit moves without—this is why truth is prized.

When applied to human affairs: serving parents with filial devotion, serving rulers with loyal integrity, drinking with joyful abandon, mourning with profound grief—loyal integrity takes merit as its aim, drinking takes joy as its aim, mourning takes grief as its aim, and serving parents takes comfort as its aim. The beauty of merit’s completion leaves no trace.

Serving parents with comfort does not debate the means; drinking with joy does not select the vessels; mourning with grief does not inquire after rites. Rites are what the common customs devise; truth is what one receives from Heaven. It is natural and cannot be altered. Thus, the sage models Heaven, values truth, and does not adhere to convention. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model Heaven but fret over others, do not value truth, and meekly submit to the whims of custom. How pitiful! You have long been steeped in artifice and only now hear of the great Dao.”

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “Today, I have had the good fortune to meet you. If Heaven has favored me, and you do not disdain to treat me as a servant, instructing me in person—may I ask where you dwell? I would follow to receive your teachings and complete my study of the great Dao.”

The stranger said, “I have heard: one who can be led may be guided to the subtle Dao; one who cannot be led does not understand the Way. Be careful not to accompany such a person, lest you bring misfortune upon yourself. Strive on—I leave you now.” He poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds.

Yan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed the reins. Confucius did not look back, waiting until the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the oar vanished before daring to board. Zilu stepped aside from the carriage and asked, “I have served you for a long time, yet never have I seen you meet another with such reverence. Even the lords of ten thousand chariots or the rulers of a thousand have never failed to receive you with equal courtesy, yet you still bore a haughty demeanor. Now, this old fisherman stands before you with his staff, and you bow deeply, bending at the waist, responding with words of deference. Have you not gone too far? Your disciples all find this strange—how has this fisherman earned such treatment?”

Confucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed, “How difficult it is to transform you, You! You have been steeped in ritual and righteousness for some time, yet your coarse and vulgar heart remains. Let me tell you: to meet one’s elders without respect is discourteous; to meet the worthy without reverence is unkind. If he were not perfectly kind, he could not humble himself before others. If one does not humble oneself with utmost sincerity, one cannot attain truth. Thus, to lack kindness harms oneself—what greater misfortune is there? Yet you alone indulge in this. Moreover, the Dao is the source of all things. Those who lose it die; those who attain it live. To act against it is to fail; to follow it is to succeed. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage honors it. This old fisherman possesses the Dao—how dare I not revere him?”

The term "common folk" (齊民) refers to the ordinary people; after the Spring and Autumn period, they were excluded from the ranks of those attending court audiences. "Both cheeks in harmony" (兩容頰適) describes a countenance that accommodates both good and evil, its appearance composed and balanced.

Guo’s commentary:
This chapter speaks of one who, though not of rivers and seas, can humble himself before those of rivers and seas. Was what Confucius taught and undertook limited to the fisherman alone? He would circulate through the six directions, penetrating all without boundary, so that even the crawling creatures could fully express what they harbored, exhausting principle and reaching destiny—this is precisely the Way of the perfected person.

Lü’s commentary:
If Confucius embodied his nature, embraced the spirit, and wandered through the world, how could he have suffered the fisherman’s reproach? The reason for speaking thus is that those in later ages who study Confucius grasp only his traces. Thus, he employed the fisherman as a metaphor to clarify that what Confucius valued was beyond the understanding of the vulgar. What Zigong reported to the fisherman was merely what the worldly Confucians knew of Confucius. Though the world is vast, it is but a thing. What made Confucius Confucius—who would willingly take things as his affairs? The true essence of the Dao is for governing the self; its remnants and dregs are for governing the state and the world. If things were truly as Zigong described, then to undertake tasks beyond one’s capacity would be to stray far from the Dao. How could he not incur the eight flaws and four maladies? Observing those in later ages who grasped only Confucius’s traces and examining their conduct, one sees that Zhuangzi’s words, even a thousand years later, remain as if witnessed firsthand. Can this not be called a spirit-like person?

**Lie Yukou, Chapter Thirty-Three**

Lie Yukou was on his way to Qi when he turned back mid-journey. He encountered Bohun Maoren, who asked, "Why have you returned?"

"I was startled," Lie Yukou replied.

"By what?"

"I dined at ten soup stalls, and at five of them, they served me first."

Bohun Maoren said, "If this is so, why were you startled?"

Lie Yukou answered, "When inner sincerity is not dissolved, the outward form radiates light, thereby overawing others’ hearts and causing them to slight their elders and guard against harm. Those soup vendors merely peddle their wares for profit, seeking surplus gain. Their power is meager, and even so, they act thus—how much more so with the lord of ten thousand chariots? His body toils for the state, and his knowledge is exhausted by affairs. He would entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. This is why I was startled."

Bohun Maoren said, "Excellent observation! Now, watch how you conduct yourself—others will safeguard you."

No sooner had he spoken than the shoes outside the door were filled to overflowing.

Bohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning on his staff, his chin nearly touching it. After a moment, without a word, he went out. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed to the door barefoot, shoes in hand.

"Since you have come, Master," he said, "why have you not offered a remedy?"

"It is already done."

"Indeed, I told you that others would safeguard you, and now they truly do. It is not that you can make others safeguard you, nor that you can prevent them from doing so—why then this emotional response, this display of surprise? There must be some stirring of feeling that shakes your inborn nature, yet this is meaningless. None of those who wander with you would tell you this. Their petty words are all poison to men. None awaken, none comprehend—how could they scrutinize one another? The cunning toil, the wise worry, the incapable seek nothing, eating and wandering freely like an untethered boat, empty and drifting."

[The annotations in the original text are not translated as they constitute interpretive commentary.]

The reverence for elders speaks of how things are stabilized through inner substance—this is why people’s respect for elders is sincere. Guarding against misfortune speaks of how refined appearances move others, yet what they guard against is the chaos of the master. The vendor’s influence is light, their profit meager; they need seek nothing from others. As for those who safeguard you, if you do not abandon your form, you will be protected wherever you go—"protection" means gathering and keeping watch. If you act with impartiality and transform through it, there will be no stirring, no seeking; without stirring or seeking, there is no mutual safeguarding. The first to bestow favors does so without prior intent—this is what makes it extraordinary.

If there must be some stirring, it moves against your original nature. Petty cleverness and subtle words enter people—only the sage is without such ability. From this point downward to the insects, none forget their own abilities to entrust themselves to the multitude.

---

The sage wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within, preserving their form and life, concealing themselves without tiring of depth or obscurity. If inner sincerity is not dissolved, one cannot yet still the heart and manifest its radiance—this can be discerned as if by spies, and is no way to conceal oneself. Eating from ten vendors, half of whom offer first, is to rely on externals to stabilize others’ hearts, causing them to slight elders and esteem oneself—this invites misfortune and brings it upon oneself. Guarding is like bearing gifts; only by responding to stirrings does one embody nature, embracing spirit to wander through the world—only then can one make others cease their safeguarding. To stand out is to fail in concealing one’s use; to stir in advance is to disturb and lose one’s original nature—the great peril of nurturing the heart and preserving spirit. Thus, to speak without revealing and to utter petty words is poison, yet none awaken, none comprehend—how could they scrutinize one another? Their influence permeates like incense, gradually shaping those who study, so they toil and worry. Those who follow the Way daily diminish, shedding knowledge and craft to return to a state of no ability—adrift like an untethered boat, empty and wandering.

---

Nature is like water: frozen, it becomes ice; melted, it returns to water. Frozen, its form does not change; melted, its use is boundless. The mind of the perfected person is as ice about to melt, returning to clarity—where is there any radiance to externally stabilize? As for those who inwardly pride themselves on true wisdom yet cannot dissolve it, when things become knotted, their mannerisms form a sheen—others can secretly observe them, as with vendors whose influence is light and profit meager. They are thus slighted, their reverence for elders guarded against as a source of misfortune—a defense against chaos.

The peril lies in its multitude of arrivals—offering the five brews first as alarm reveals one adept at inward contemplation. In one’s own conduct, one claims to leave no form behind; standing northward, one distinguishes among things. Pressing the staff close, one furrows the brow—cheeks forget the self, words emerge without speech. Yet when Liezi grasps his shoes and runs barefoot, he has not yet silently grasped the teaching of wordlessness.

One may not lose virtue yet not reach the supreme virtue of non-virtue; one may know the Dao that leaves traces yet not attain the constant Dao of no-mind—thus one cannot make others free of reliance on you. To deem the inability to free others from reliance a peril differs from those who make others rely on you. The one who moves first to influence acts preemptively; Liezi never once set forth the extraordinary to move things. Yet when others come to rely on him, it is because something has moved them unawares.

Once moved, they tax your spirit and unsettle your essence, daily debating with those who tread your doorstep—do their words truly hold meaning? Thus it is said: agitation uproots one’s nature, and still there is no meaning. Those who wander with you sink together into the perils of the human way, so none know where to lodge their petty words—how could they deliver the medicine of ultimate speech? Such is the shared plight: lost on the path, things and self achieve nothing.

Thus it is said: none awaken, none realize—what comparison can there be? Following the root, those whose inner sincerity remains unbroken cannot attain the central void. Those who scheme outwardly to craft an aura of radiance cannot dissolve into tracelessness. Outwardly, one may be spied upon and their brilliance fashioned into spectacle for others to scrutinize. Guarding against this is like fermenting brine—what one fears is abandoning one’s natural state to pursue external reverence, thus inviting peril. Those who rely on you are drawn to you as a means of protection, just as in the *Records of the Han*, Xiao and Cao feared crossing the city walls to protect the Gaozu Emperor—here, *dun* (protection) and *fang* (guard) share the same resonance. To furrow one’s brow, leaning on a staff until flesh wrinkles—this is *cu* (constriction). To act preemptively is to respond to what has not yet come to pass; thus, the proof of extraordinary influence must lie in some prior stirring, which then unsettles your fundamental nature. Meaningless, devoid of anyone to speak to—even those who wander with you will offer no counsel. Petty words are the clever, insinuating speech that harms others. *Shu* (who, what) is an interrogative: none can awaken or realize, so what is there to compare?

Among the people of Zheng, there was Huan. In the land of Qiu, he chanted and intoned for three years, becoming a Confucian. His influence seeped like a river moistening nine *li*, nourishing three clans. He sent his younger brother Mo to study Mohism, and the two debated for a decade, until Huan, aiding Di, took his own life. His father appeared to him in a dream, saying: *"If your son were to become a Mohist, it would be I who made him so."* Hu once examined the mulberry—it had already borne the fruit of autumn cypress. The Creator’s retribution does not punish the person but the Heaven within the person. Thus, it caused that man to regard himself as exceptional, distinct from others, and to despise his kin. Among the people of Qi, those who drew water from the well would brawl. Thus it is said: in this age, all are Huan. Even those with virtue do so unknowingly—how much more so those with the Dao? The ancients called this "the punishment of fleeing from Heaven."

Guo’s commentary:
*Shen-yin* refers to chanting and intoning. *Zhi* means "to go." Di was Huan’s younger brother. Huan resented his father for aiding his brother, so in a surge of emotion, he killed himself. In death, he appeared in a dream, saying that since he had already transformed himself into a Confucian and transformed his brother into a Mohist, his brother, though shaped by him, could not follow his lead. He had taken a fine teacher as his enemy and died in resentment—such was the depth of his sincerity that he became the fruit of autumn cypress. From *"The Creator"* onward are the words of Zhuangzi.

The power of accumulated practice is retribution—it repays one’s nature, not one’s actions. Thus, the work of study and habit perfects one’s nature, but is this truly for its own sake? That which possesses its own nature is made to cultivate it. Huan prided himself on his Confucianism, believing it the fruit of his accumulated learning, unaware that it was the natural unfolding of his nature. Those who take merit in despising others do not spare even their kin. Those who forget the self to harmonize their nature do not lose sight of the proper order, whether noble or base. Digging a well is for channeling the spring; chanting and intoning are for channeling one’s nature. Without a spring, there is nothing to dig; without nature, there is nothing to chant. Yet the world forgets the natural spring and nature, fixating only on the superficial work of digging and chanting. Desiring to claim these as their own merit—is this not delusion? Observe Huan’s folly: he believed that studying his father enabled him to act as he did, yet how could he have known that it was effortless, arising from the space between things? Those who take the power of nature as their own achievement are those who flee from Heaven.

Thus, when punishment and execution befall them—Lu’s annotation states: Huan styled himself a Confucian yet compelled his younger brother to become a Mohist, leading them to debate one another. Their father sided with Di, and Huan took his own life—all this was merely the doing of the man. As for Huan’s becoming a Confucian and Di’s becoming a Mohist, that was the Heaven of the man. Judging by the man, father and son, elder and younger brother, were not of one mind; Confucianism and Mohism divided their pursuits. Judging by the Heaven of the man, they were one and the same. What their father dreamed of was Huan’s Heaven; Huan’s Heaven was his younger brother’s Heaven, yet Huan did not act as Huan. To say that Di became a Mohist was truly Heaven’s doing—goodness was received from nature, not something attainable through study—it was simply Heaven. To call his younger brother’s actions his own and claim his own Heaven as goodness was to forget the words of father and son, elder and younger brother. To study Confucianism and become a Confucian, to study Mohism and become a Mohist, or for Huan to become a cypress fruit—all were repayment, all were Heaven’s doing. Yet people do not know that what moves them to aid others is never different from themselves. They take themselves as possessing something distinct from others, even to the point of despising their kin, as Huan did—is this not lamentable? This is no different from the man of Qi who claimed a well as his own, leading to mutual brawling. The world, not knowing its Heaven, despises others and exalts itself—all are Huan. Tracing the source of such loss of nature, it lies in possessing knowledge. Those with virtue preserve their Heaven by not knowing. How much more so for those who embody the Dao?

Those with knowledge flee from Heaven; fleeing from Heaven, they betray their true nature and cannot avoid returning to it—thus the ancients called this "the punishment of fleeing from Heaven." Following the root: "Moaning and reciting for three years, only three years, and Confucian learning is complete." The river moistens nine li, a metaphor for beneficence extending to the three clans—speaking of Confucians who receive emoluments and extend grace to their clans. *Hé* means "all," *hé* and *hú* both mean "why." In a dream, he spoke with his father in earnest tones: "I provided for you, yet you studied Mohism—it was I!" But when had his father ever regarded him with favor? "After my death, I will become the fruit of the catalpa on my grave." Zhuangzi cited this and concluded: The Creator’s repayment to man does not stoop to repaying what man has done; it often repays what man cannot do. Huan, however, demanded repayment for what he had done—this was his error. The Creator truly enabled his brother to become a Mohist, yet Huan, relying on himself, despised his kin. This is like the man of Qi who drank from a well and fought over it: the well made no distinction between giving and taking, yet the drinkers fought among themselves—this was ignorance of Heaven. Today, all people are like Huan. From this, we see that those of virtue regard the Creator’s repayment as unknowable—how much more so for those who embody the Dao? Those who embody the Dao entrust everything to nature.

The ancients called those like Huan "fugitives from Heaven’s principle." General meaning: The two sentences *hé hú* lack depth in all interpretations—why did the father not see his younger brother’s goodness, like autumn or the cypress fruit, ripening his talent and unfolding his vitality, yet instead sided with his brother to bring about my death? A decade of old resentment—his Confucianism is evident. Lu Deming: The digger of the well claimed credit for creating the spring, yet those who fought over drinking did not know the spring’s emergence was Heaven’s doing. Huan took credit for making his brother a Mohist and resented his father for not recognizing Zhai’s ability to become a Mohist—this too was Heaven’s doing.

The sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not; the multitude finds peace in what is not naturally peaceful and does not find peace in what is. Guo’s commentary: The sage is neither at peace nor not at peace, following the hearts of the people. What brings peace differs, and thus they are the multitude. Lü’s commentary: What is peaceful is Heaven; what is not peaceful is man. Following the root: These few lines suffice to convey the above meaning—Huan was one who did not find peace.

Zhuangzi said: Knowing the Dao is easy; not speaking of it is difficult. To know and not speak is to follow Heaven; to know and speak is to follow man. The ancients followed Heaven and not man. Guo’s commentary: Though knowledge pervades Heaven and Earth, they never spoke to lead others, merely responding to what was fitting. Lü’s commentary: The distinction between following Heaven and following man—this is the "inaction" referred to. Thus, those like Kuang and Qu, though knowing, never came close to the Yellow Emperor. Zhu Ping studied the art of dragon-slaying under Zhi Liyi, exhausting a thousand gold from his family. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet there was no use for his craft. Guo’s commentary: Affairs lie in appropriateness; distant achievements are not prized. Lü’s commentary: The dragon, as a creature, resembles sagely wisdom in its transformations. To slay it is to reject it. Exhausting a thousand gold from one’s family is to empty one’s possessions. Having no use for his craft is to have no need for rejection—this is the wholeness of Heaven.

The sage treats the inevitable as if it were not, and thus has no need for arms; the multitude treats the inevitable as if it were, and thus has many arms. Those who follow arms act with intent; relying on arms leads to ruin. Guo’s commentary: Though a principle is inevitable, treating it as if it were not is the height of compliance. Though arms may not be inevitable, insisting on them breeds discord. Each follows its nature, and sufficiency leaves no room for desire. When arms must be used, employing them with tranquility ensures no ruin. Lü’s commentary: Nothing is more dangerous than the will; *Mo Ye* and *Yan Yue* are inferior. The sage’s talent establishes itself, and the Dao moves accordingly—this can be inevitable. Yet he never insists, entrusting it to Heaven. Thus, treating the inevitable as if it were not prevents injury from unfulfilled ambitions, and so he has no need for arms. The multitude does the opposite, and thus has many arms. Following arms and acting with intent, relying on them, leads to ruin. Xin Yi: The Dao is the uncarved simplicity of non-action; arms are the instruments of action. The sage embodies the Dao and acts without contrivance, following the nature of things, and thus has no need for arms. The multitude, having lost the Dao and acting with contrivance, opposes the nature of things, and thus has many arms. Having many arms means following arms and seeking externally. Thus, it is said: "Following arms, they act with intent." Yet arms are what the sage uses only when unavoidable—how could he delight in them or rely on them? Relying on them makes survival difficult. Thus, it is said: "Arms—relying on them leads to ruin." *Bisheng*: Arms do not refer to spears and halberds; the battles of joy and anger within the breast are arms. Gengsangzi said: "Resentment not yet expressed is arms." How could it be merely the cruelty of blades and arrows?

The petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond bribes and letters, wasting his spirit on trivialities, yet he desires to guide all things and unify the Dao. His form is as empty as this—bewildered by the cosmos, burdened by form, he does not know the Great Beginning. The perfected man, however, returns his spirit to the beginningless and delights in the realm of nothingness. Like water flowing without form, like breath dispersing in the Great Purity—alas! Your knowledge clings to the tip of a hair, yet you do not know the Great Peace. Guo’s commentary: Bribes for gifts, bamboo slips for inquiries—these are the tools of petty knowledge, which pursues trivial affairs. Bewildered by small tasks, his gains are shallow, yet he desires to guide all things. Traversing emptiness and vastness, his ambitions are great, his spirit exhausted, his form burdened—thus he is bewildered and loses the essence. Therefore, the perfected man is serene and inactive, entrusting himself to Heaven’s course. The petty man’s knowledge is slight, yet he burdens himself with great peace. Lü’s commentary: The petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond inquiries and gifts, and thus he wastes his spirit. Clumsy and shallow, he desires to guide all things, unify the Dao, and empty his form—this is beyond his capacity. Thus, he is bewildered by the cosmos, burdened by form, and does not know the Great Beginning. He cannot unify the Dao or empty his form.

Only the sage returns his spirit to the Non-Beginning and delights in obscurity within the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever. When he moves, his actions flow like water, issuing forth formlessly into the Great Purity—thus he guides all things with unified Dao, emptying his form. The heart as a thing knows no bounds, yet its knowledge remains confined to inquiries and gifts. Such knowledge extends no further than a hair’s breadth, ignorant of the Great Tranquility—how lamentable!

**Xun Ben’s Commentary:**
The "unified Dao" and "emptied form" here differ from the common usage of "Great Oneness" or "Great Beginning." The syntax pairs "guiding all things" with "unified Dao," and "emptying form" with "Dao and things." "Guiding all things" corresponds to "Dao," while "unifying" corresponds to "form and emptiness"—implying the utmost balance. "Burdened by form, ignorant of the Great Beginning" means being shackled by form, unaware of the Great Beginning. "Delighting in obscurity" is like deep slumber. "Flowing like water, formless, issuing into the Great Purity" describes the perfected man’s effortless nature. "Knowledge confined to a hair’s breadth" refers to petty knowledge.

There was a man of Song named Cao Shang, sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his departure, he received several chariots; the King, pleased, granted him a hundred more. Returning to Song, he met Zhuangzi and said: "To dwell in a cramped alley, impoverished and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is what I was once incapable of. Yet now, awakening to the favor of a lord of ten thousand chariots and following with a hundred chariots—this is my strength!"

Zhuangzi replied: "When the King of Qin was ill, he summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils or drained abscesses received one chariot; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five. The lower the treatment, the more chariots they gained. Did you, perchance, treat his hemorrhoids? How else could you have received so many chariots? Begone!"

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
Serving the lowly leads to great merit; great merit leads to heavy rewards. Thus, those who value lofty detachment abandon such honors.

**Xun Ben’s Commentary:**
"A withered neck" means a gaunt, fleshless neck. "Sallow face" describes a haggard, emaciated appearance, as if mutilated. *Cuo* (痤) refers to sores or ulcers.

Duke Ai of Lu asked Yan He: "I regard Confucius as the pillar of the state—will this bring recovery?"

Yan He replied: "Perilous indeed! Confucius adorns himself with feathers and embellishments, engaging in ornate affairs, using flowery words as defenses, suppressing his nature to impress the people. He does not know whether what he receives is governed by the heart or the spirit—how can he lead the people? That may suit you, or perhaps Xu Yu, but it is mistaken and untenable. Now, to lead the people away from reality toward falsity is no way to govern them. Considering posterity, it would be better to cease such efforts. To bestow upon others yet never forget it is not the Heavenly Way. Merchants are held in contempt, and even if one treats them as scholars, the spirit disregards them. External punishments are metal and wood; internal punishments are agitation and transgression. The petty man suffers external punishments—metal and wood interrogate him; he suffers internal punishments—yin and yang consume him. Only the true man can escape both internal and external punishments."

**Guo Xiang’s Commentary:**
*Ji* (圾) means peril. The perfected man finds peace in the people’s tranquility. If one becomes a pillar of the state, one leaves behind an exalted legacy for ten thousand generations, inciting competition in benevolence and righteousness, adorning their embellishments. The people are then endangered, and the perfected man has no means of securing peace.

Whenever the text says "engaging in," it refers to later generations’ pursuits of adornment, not genuine action. "Engaging in ornate affairs, using flowery words as defenses" means that later generations’ actions lack substance, their intentions running wild. Later rulers will admire Confucius’ distant path and force themselves to suppress their nature, governing the people through pretense. Superiors and inferiors will grow accustomed to this, unaware of their own falsity.

"Leading the people" means later generations will not merely imitate his outward form but will receive and employ his ways with their hearts and spirits, no longer acting from their own nature. "That" refers to the people; "you" refers to Duke Ai. Each has their proper role. Imitating one another leads to losing authenticity—this is already evident today. "Xu Yu" refers to following him, which is no way to cultivate oneself. To call it correct is impossible.

"Considering posterity" clearly does not refer to the present. Governing leads to falsity, so the sage does not govern. To recognize yet not treat things as straw dogs—merchants are held in contempt, let alone scholar-gentlemen! Only those who bestow favors are acknowledged in affairs, yet because they do not forget, the spirit disregards them—this is the great truth of the people.

"Metal" refers to blades, axes, and halberds; "wood" refers to flogging, cangues, and fetters. When one is calm and appropriate, there are no internal or external punishments. Those who do not follow the bright and level path are called petty men. Acting beyond measure harms the inner nature and qi; metal and wood interrogate externally. Unless one is a true man, none can restrain their transgressions.

**Lü Huiqing’s Commentary:**
The *Book of Changes* takes *zhen* (贞) as the pillar of affairs. The movement of all under Heaven is steadfast in the One.

Only by forgetting the heart-mind can one attain unity; attaining unity is how one becomes the steadfast pillar and the governing principle for all under Heaven and the state. If those who would govern the realm and the nation do not understand this but merely rely on sagely wisdom to order affairs, their corruption will inevitably reach the state described above.

The Dao and its laws follow nature—just as the swan is white without daily bathing. When sagely wisdom becomes a burden, it is like adorning feathers with paint. Feathers are the natural quality of Heaven; painting is the artifice of man. It is like pursuing ornate words to magnify the small, where names and realities become confused and affairs do not arise from nature. If one forces the self and suppresses the inner nature to observe the people, they will not know trust. If one cannot forget the heart-mind and receive it, the heart-mind cannot embody the spirit and govern it. This is why the spirit exists for the people—how could it be sufficient to govern them?

The reason the Dao cannot be shared with others is that its center lacks a master and is not upright. Then, was Confucius able to make you fitting, or did you nourish yourself? Only by cutting off learning and nurturing the heart-mind can one attain unity. Merely taking the sage as the steadfast pillar is a mistake—this is not how to be upright. Departing from true learning is falsehood; this is not how to observe the people. If one claims to move like clouds and rain like moisture, how can there be forgetting? Merchants are not ranked with scholar-gentlemen—this is ancient ritual. Ranking them by affairs is a change in ritual. The spirit does not rank people by their nature. Valuing righteousness and despising profit is indeed rooted in human nature; those who love profit and forget righteousness have lost their original heart-mind.

Metal and wood punish the body; movement and excess punish the heart-mind. One who is still and unmoving has uprightness of heart; movement without deviation is not perverse. Acting with desire to be appropriate stems from necessity—otherwise, it is all excess. Yang Xiong said: "By day, one’s faults are few; by night, one’s faults are many." "Night" here means the same as "dark"—those who have not fully attained the Dao, though grand and great, cannot escape internal and external punishments and remain petty men. Only the true man, acting in stillness out of necessity, cannot be burdened by internal or external punishments.

**Xun Ben’s Commentary:**
"Those" refers to the people; "she" refers to Duke Ai; "you" refers to Confucius; "I" refers to Yan He, who speaks of nourishing the self. "Error" means mistake. The people should forget you, and you should forget them—merely pointing the way is sufficient. What need is there for government decrees? Even if there are errors, it does no harm, for they are united in reality. Merchants cannot be ranked with scholar-officials—though occasionally ranked by circumstance, the spirit of man is ultimately unwilling, as if not wishing to rank with them. Yan He’s displeasure with Confucius likely stems from this. "Petty men" are the same as "small men"; the ancient characters are interchangeable, as in the *Book of Han*: "Do not draw near petty men." Here, Yan He speaks of the Dao of the true man as vastly different from Confucius.

**New Transmission:**
The sage harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth and aligns function with yin and yang. He does not display his spirit to make people contend, nor reveal his traces to entrust things to self-transformation. Profound and effortless, he returns to simplicity—how could he merely assist the times? The Dao of the sage lies in the subtle, wondrous, empty, and still; the sage’s traces lie in the obscure, dark, hidden, and silent. The Dao cannot be known, and traces cannot be seen. If one serves in Lu as an assistant, then the Dao can be known and traces can be seen—all under Heaven will surely adorn the exterior and value rhetoric to imitate him. Thus, the sage cannot but act, and all under Heaven cannot but lose their authenticity. This is not the way to govern.

Therefore, it is said: "One is then adorning feathers with paint, pursuing ornate words to make branches the essence." It is also said: "Difficult to govern." Yan He understood the sage’s "useless use." Confucius said: "Human hearts are more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven at least has the seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer, and the times of dawn and dusk. But humans have deep appearances and hidden emotions. Some appear sincere yet are harmful; some seem long yet are unworthy; some appear compliant yet are restrained; some seem firm yet are slack; some seem slow yet are resolute. Thus, those who rush to righteousness may flee from it as if burned. Therefore, the noble man sends them far to observe their loyalty, brings them near to observe their respect, burdens them to observe their ability, questions them suddenly to observe their wisdom, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their restraint, and mixes them in company to observe their demeanor. Through these nine tests, the unworthy are revealed."

**Guo’s Commentary:**
"More treacherous than mountains and rivers... flee from it as if burned" describes how human emotions and appearances can be so contradictory. The noble man is easy to observe, while the unworthy are hard to discern. Yet by examining their motives, observing their conduct, and scrutinizing their contentment, one can know them through these methods.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
"Sincere" is the opposite of "harmful"; "long" is the opposite of "unworthy"; "compliant" is the opposite of "restrained"; "firm" is the opposite of "slack"; "slow" is the opposite of "resolute." Since these are all opposites, one cannot examine them through a single method.

Zheng Kaofu, upon his first appointment, bowed; upon his second, stooped; upon his third, bent low, creeping along the wall—who would dare not follow the rules? But the common man, upon his first appointment, stands tall; upon his second, dances atop his chariot; upon his third, names his peers "uncle"—who could align with the ways of Yao or Xu? There is no greater thief than virtue with a heart-mind, and the heart-mind has its flaws. When it has flaws, one turns inward; turning inward leads to ruin. There are five inauspicious virtues, with inner virtue as the first. What is inner virtue? Inner virtue is having self-regard and rejecting what one does not do. There are eight extremes of poverty and three of success; there must be form, and there are six repositories. Handsomeness, whiskers, height, size, strength, beauty, bravery, and daring—if all eight surpass others, one may still be impoverished. Following circumstances, slouching, cowardice, and fearing inferiority—if all three are mastered, one may still succeed. Wisdom and intelligence externally communicated, brave action breeding resentment, benevolence and righteousness multiplying demands—these are the conditions of a successful life. Those who succeed through knowledge are flawed; those who succeed in great destiny follow it; those who succeed in small destiny encounter it.

**Guo’s Commentary:**
"Who would dare not follow the rules" means no one would dare insult him with unruly conduct. "The common man" refers to ordinary people. "Yao" refers to the sage-king; "Xu" refers to Xu You. This says: Which of these—ordinary people or Zheng Kaofu—aligns with the ways of Yao and Xu? Having a heart-mind for virtue is not true virtue. True virtue is suddenly and naturally attained without knowing how. Following the heart-mind in virtue may still be acceptable.

To labor the heart-mind between the brows is already extreme artifice—yet to seek to probe and divine the obscure, making profundity one’s business, is to ruin both heart-mind and endeavor. To condemn and criticize: when one deems oneself right and others wrong, those who attack are many, thus becoming the chief culprit. If within there is no self-preferring inclination, and one freely allows all things to be as they are, each without self-loss, then the world will all wish to serve him.

"Exhaustion" refers to exhaustion in being employed; the world is never exhausted by its shortcomings but constantly ensnares itself with its strengths. Those who "cling and follow" rely on things to proceed; those who are "haughty and indolent" cannot stoop to tasks; those who are "distressed and timid" are weak—these three, though unfit for affairs, may still succeed through assistance. "Intelligence externally communicated" means outward communication harms the inner through boundlessness. "Brave action breeds resentment" means timidity and stillness strengthen the self. "Benevolence and righteousness" are what the world expects in love, yet love cannot be all-encompassing—thus multiplying demands.

"Puppet-like" describes the appearance of great awakening and release; "resemblance" means dispersal. "Following" means blending indistinguishably with transformation. "Encountering" means stopping at the proper juncture and awakening.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
From Zheng Kaofu onward, who aligns with Yao and Xu? Such is the measure of one’s capacity—unaware and unknowing, following the emperor’s standard. To slander is to become a thief. Virtue with a heart-mind, and a heart-mind with an eye—knowledge complete yet ruining the standard—no thief is greater than this. Inward vision reveals what is called a thief. The movements of the five senses, deluded and unreturning, are all inauspicious.

"Virtue with a heart-mind" means virtue with intention; with intention, there is a self. Deeming oneself right and others wrong, one thus prefers oneself and condemns what one does not do. The eight qualities all surpassing others lead to self-conceit, hence exhaustion. The three qualities inferior to others lead to self-exertion, hence success. "Intelligence externally communicated" brings things to bear; "brave action breeds resentment"; "benevolence and righteousness multiply demands"—this clarifies that what the world deems fine is not truly fine, and what it deems detestable is not truly detestable. The essential point lies in vigorous conduct, having the will to abandon the form. If one can, in life, attain this, then what is called "Heaven-given" is beyond knowing.

"Puppet-like" means merely attaining knowledge; one knows that one’s knowledge arises from unknowing yet cannot achieve unknowing—only resembling it. "Destiny" is what the Creator makes; I and the Creator are one, thus those who succeed in great destiny follow it without departure. Knowing that success and failure lie with Heaven, not with oneself, those who succeed in small destiny encounter it without refusal.

**Textual Note:**
Zheng Kaofu was the ten-times great-grandfather of Confucius.

"Events are recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*: 'pointing' refers to common people dancing atop their carriages, leaping and swaying as they ride. 'Naming one’s elders' means addressing one’s uncles by their given names. 'Tang Xu'—Xu You of the Tang era—declined the empire when it was offered to him, refusing to accept it. How could he take pride in rank or office? Who could compare to him?

The desires of the ear, eye, mouth, nose, and heart—these five—are all baleful powers, with the heart’s desires chief among them. Whenever one favors oneself and disparages others for not acting as one does, this is baleful power. To be fine-bearded and tall is one kind of majesty; to be brave and daring is another kind of wisdom. When Viscount Xiang admired fine beards and great stature, he deemed archery and charioteering sufficient skill; when he admired strength and vigor, he deemed them sufficient virtue—thus two things became six, and six became eight. By these eight abilities, one surpasses others, and by this, one exhausts the limits of exhaustion—hence the saying, 'Exhaustion has eight extremes.'

'Following along' means aligning with nature; 'reclining freely' means resting at ease; 'constrained and fearful' means being oppressed and timid, placing oneself beneath others. These three do not seek passage yet attain it naturally—hence the saying, 'Attainment has three necessities.' Below, the text appends to the earlier discussion of 'penetrating comprehension': those who attain knowledge outwardly through bold action invite much resentment, while those who act with benevolence and righteousness invite much reproach. Only those who penetrate the natural conditions of life can remain grandly self-reliant. Those who attain knowledge, though not yet reaching this, can still approximate it—this is what it means to 'embody form with likeness.' Those who penetrate the great mandate of Heaven move in accord with it; those who penetrate its lesser mandate, though not fully attaining this, can still accept what befalls them. Is this not what is meant by 'penetrating comprehension'—is it not about what lies beyond?

Fang Sishan notes: 'Exhaustion has eight extremes' means these eight exhaust all limits. 'Attainment has three necessities' means these three are essential to attainment. 'Form has six repositories': 'form' is what is manifest externally; 'repository' is what is stored within. To say there are six stored within is to say that what is stored within cannot avoid being manifest externally. Knowledge, wisdom, bold action, benevolence, and righteousness—these are the six repositories. Thus, only those who attain [the Way] are free of them. Those who attain life do so without intent; those who attain knowledge do so without obstruction; those who attain destiny regard fortune and misfortune, good and evil, without thought or scheming, roaming with Heaven.

The *Brush Notes* records: Master Wenzi said, 'When the Dao has knowledge, virtue is disordered; when virtue has intent, it becomes perilous; when the heart has eyes, it is blinded. Why? Having eyes, one must have sight. Those who study the Dao often suffer from lack of insight yet do not realize that sight is the thief of virtue.' The Buddha spoke of five kinds of eyes: only the heavenly eye and the fleshly eye are in the face; the wisdom eye, the Dharma eye, and the Buddha eye are all in the heart. The heart’s eye is the completion of virtue; this heart’s eye is the ruin of virtue. Knowing how it is ruined, one knows how it is completed—there is no dual principle here. Then how can those who attain knowledge be said to have eyes? Why speak of 'likeness'? Laozi did not say, 'The great Dao seems unlike'? If it were like, it would long since have been reduced to the trivial.

There was a man who saw the King of Song bestow ten chariots upon someone, and with those ten chariots, the recipient grew arrogant and childish. Zhuangzi said: By the river lived a poor family who made their living weaving rushes. Their son dived into the depths and obtained a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him, 'Bring a stone and smash it! A pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie in the ninefold abyss beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you must have encountered its sleep. Had the black dragon been awake, what scrap of you would remain?' Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss, and the ferocity of the King of Song is not merely that of a black dragon. That you could obtain the chariots means you must have encountered his sleep. Had the King of Song been awake, you would be ground to powder.

Guo’s commentary: Those who seek wealth and honor must align with the people’s hopes. If one clings to strange doctrines, rides the celestial thoroughfare to ensnare the ruler’s heart, the enlightened lord will not accept it. Thus, if there is praise, there must be testing among the people. If it does not contradict the consensus, then promote it to meet the hopes of all—this is how the Three Dynasties practiced the straight Way.

Lü’s commentary: Those who risk danger and seek fortune, hoping for favor and fame without awakening, are like the diver who sought the pearl. This is what the perfected man deems perilous and pities. That one would use such things to grow arrogant and childish—is this not deluded?

Oral Exegesis: 'Arrogant and childish' means being haughty and treating others as children. 'Weaving rushes' means weaving reeds into mats. 'Obtaining the pearl' and 'encountering the dragon’s sleep' are metaphors for those who seek wealth and honor—all perilous paths. 'What scrap would remain?' means there would be nothing left.

Someone sent an envoy to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi replied to the messenger: Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered brocade and fed with fine hay and beans. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a lone calf, can it still be so?

Guo’s commentary: Those who delight in life fear the sacrificial altar and decline appointments; the skull, hearing of life, frowns in dismay. The sentiments of life and death differ, each fitting in its own way.

Lü’s commentary: Zhuangzi entered the realm of neither death nor life, having long regarded death as the joy of a king facing south. Thus, the sacrificial ox in the great temple is not what he fears. Yet the world risks life and harms itself for profit, so his conduct is as it is.

When Zhuangzi was about to die, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: I take Heaven and Earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars as my pearls and jades, the myriad things as my funeral gifts—is my burial not already complete? What could be added to this? The disciples said: We fear the crows and kites will eat you. Zhuangzi said: Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by ants and mole crickets. To take from one to give to the other—how partial is that! To make the impartial impartial with partiality, to make the unproven proven with proof—those who are enlightened merely act, while those who are spiritually attuned prove it. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritually attuned has long been so. Yet the foolish rely on what they see, imposing it upon others. Their merit lies externally—is this not lamentable?

Guo’s commentary: To use one household’s impartiality to balance the myriad things is not as good as allowing the myriad things to balance themselves. 'Proven' means 'to respond.' Not relying on the myriad things’ natural responses but wishing to respond with one’s own views will inevitably lead to discord. Those who cling to their views are often employed, but how can they employ things? Only by following the spirit can one attain perfect compliance, thus responding without fail. What the enlightened can reach does not extend beyond form and bones; perfect compliance has no far or near, no hidden or profound—all things attain themselves. Thus, action arises from them, and merit is stored in things. If one relies on what one sees and clings to one’s own correctness, though one may wish to influence others, one’s merit remains external."

Lü’s Commentary:
To attain the unity of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things and identify with it as one’s body—such is life, wherein all things are prepared to nurture form; such is death, wherein one offers oneself as a gift for the journey. This is no empty saying. Those who fear being devoured by crows, kites, mole crickets, or ants cannot escape the bias of giving and taking. Only by being without intent does one remain free from giving or taking, thus achieving equilibrium. Yet to seek equilibrium through deliberate action is to fail in equilibrium; to seek response through deliberate effort is to fail in response. If intent arises, there can be no absence of preference or rejection, and one loses the constancy of the mind—this is the ultimate failure of response and equilibrium.

To desire equilibrium is to disrupt equilibrium; to desire response is to obstruct response. Stillness is like water: undisturbed, it is level. The great artisan takes the level as his model—thus, to level is to achieve levelness. He takes response as his principle—thus, to respond is to achieve response. All who today claim to know the basis of giving and taking rely on clarity alone; those who do not know it are the ones who embody the spirit. Clarity merely acts as an agent, while the spirit responds—this is why clarity cannot surpass the spirit. Yet the foolish, knowing nothing of the spirit, cling to their own views in attempting to influence others, expending effort externally. How can they return to the true nature of life and destiny?

Personal Reflections in Summary:
The text begins with the cautionary tale of offering libations, warning against deviant influences that attract crowds before one is prepared, yet fail to ensure others’ security. Next, it recounts the bitter dispute between Huan and Di, whose rage led to death and transformation into autumn cypresses, evading the punishments of nature—yet the Creator preserves the innate nature of beings. To know the Dao and remain silent is like the movement of Heaven; to know and speak of it is to reveal its mechanism too shallowly.

Thus, the skill of dragon-slaying, though perfected, finds no use; cleverness in cleverness cannot match the skill of dragon-slaying. Those who lick boils to gain carriages find their rewards multiply, for abundance alone cannot honor such service—both serve as warnings to disciples and remedies for the ills of the age. Relying on steadfast pillars to uphold a state is not as effective as ceasing to provoke the punishments of excessive action. The heart must recognize caution: the worthy are employed through ninefold response, while the unworthy meet their fate through threefold destiny. Reverence and negligence divide the eight directions; the three certainties and the nine perils are not constant. A single pearl’s loss in nine disasters serves as a metaphor for the complexities of navigating the world and the calamities invited by the pursuit of fame and profit.

If one can reflect upon the formed to guard against the formless, the burdens of the human realm may be avoided. To abandon the sacrificial ox for the orphaned calf depends on one’s sincerity and dedication. The text concludes with Zhuangzi’s death, illustrating the illusory nature of form and its impermanence—all things must end. His disciples, fearing the birds and beasts, viewed him with worldly eyes, yet the perfected person forgets form and follows transformation, free from the bias of giving or taking. By embodying the spirit and manifesting clarity, the principles of equilibrium and response remain unerring—this is how one departs from the human and enters the Heavenly, ascending to the Dao. Ah!

The Thirty-Third of the World

Those who govern the world through methods and arts are many, each claiming their achievements cannot be surpassed. Yet where, truly, does the so-called *Dao*-art lie? It is said: not in "having," but in the spirit—how else could illumination descend, how else could sagacity emerge? That from which sages are born and kings are made all originates from the One, never departing from the Source. This is called the Heavenly Person. Never departing from essence is called the Spirit Person. Never departing from the real is called the Perfected Person. Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, they presage transformation—this is the sage.

Taking benevolence as grace, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, they are imbued with compassion and kindness—this is the noble person. Taking law as distinction, names as outward signs, alignment as verification, and investigation as judgment, their reckoning follows one, two, three, four, and so on. The hundred officials rank themselves accordingly, taking affairs as their constant, clothing and food as their primary concern, and the flourishing, storing, aging, weak, orphaned, and widowed as their care—all possess the means to nurture the people. The ancients were truly complete!

They matched the spirit-light, purified Heaven and Earth, nourished the myriad things, harmonized the world, and extended blessings to the hundred clans. They were clear about fundamental reckoning and bound to its branches, their measures penetrating the six directions and opening the four gates. Whether great or small, refined or coarse, their movement was without limit—yet not in their brilliance, but in their reckoning and measures. The old laws and worldly records preserved by historians still abound; those found in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music* are often elucidated by the scholars and gentry of Zou and Lu.

The *Odes* convey the will, the *Documents* convey affairs, the *Rites* convey conduct, the *Music* conveys harmony, the *Changes* convey yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* convey names and distinctions. Their reckoning spreads throughout the world, and the teachings established in the Central States give rise to the hundred schools. At times, these are praised and followed, yet the world falls into great disorder, the worthy and sagely are obscured, the Dao and virtue are not unified, and the world grasps at partial insights to esteem itself—like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each possessing its own clarity yet unable to communicate. Such is the case with the hundred schools and their many arts.

All possess their strengths and serve their uses at times, yet none is comprehensive or all-encompassing—each is but a partial scholar. They dissect the beauty of Heaven and Earth, analyze the principles of the myriad things, and examine the wholeness of the ancients, yet few can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the spiritually enlightened. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingliness grows dim and fails to flourish. The people of the world each follow their own desires, acting as they see fit. Alas! The hundred schools have gone forth and do not return; they will never reunite.

Later scholars, unfortunate in their inability to witness the purity of Heaven and Earth or the great essence of the ancients, will see the Dao and its arts torn asunder by the world.

Guo’s Annotation:
*To act according to what one possesses is true action; to act truly is to be without falsity—what more could be added? The spiritually enlightened descend only after being moved by affairs, then depart, causing each thing to return to its root and embrace the One, without adornment on the outside. This is how the sage-kings give life and bring completion. The heavenly spirit, the utmost sage, the ordinary sage, and the noble person—these four names belong to one and the same person, differing only in how they are expressed.*

*Humaneness, rightness, ritual, and music are but coarse traces of these four names, yet they are what the worthy, the gentlemen, and the noble follow. Their names and laws are examined to govern the people’s principles. Once the people’s principles are settled, the sages and worthies do not oppose the ancients—these are the four names mentioned earlier. When the root is numerically clear, the branches do not stray. There is no place where this is not so, and thus nothing is lacking. What can be made clear through reckoning and measures, though numerous, is already distant and external. The scholars and gentry of Zou and Lu can only clarify their traces—how could they grasp the essence behind them?*

*The Six Classics, once scattered, became the hundred schools’ teachings, all of which merely expound the ancients’ old traces. Even so, they cannot consistently uphold them, and the world falls into great disorder because they employ these traces without unity. The sages and worthies are obscured, and their traces are not easily understood. The Dao and virtue are not unified, and the hundred schools force interpretations. The world grasps at partial insights, each believing in their own biased views and unable to embrace the whole.*

*The sage unifies the great passions of the people and establishes systems accordingly. Thus, the people entrust their emotions to what is unified and forget their own likes and dislikes, harmonizing with the age in tranquil indifference. In times of chaos, the opposite occurs: people indulge their immediate preferences, families apply their own classical laws, states adopt different policies, and households follow distinct customs. Their strengths differ and cannot be consistently applied; they are neither comprehensive nor all-encompassing and thus insufficient for full responsibility. Each employs but a fragment, so they dissect and judge the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. The complete person is rarely encountered, and so the Way of the sage-kings grows dim. The great essence lies in each returning to the root and embracing the One—this is the purity of Heaven and Earth. Division and separation arise when the Dao and its arts degenerate, each school striving in its own direction. Some take things as their master, causing things to depart from their nature and follow external impositions, thus losing their inherent nature and destiny.*

Lü’s Annotation:
*None among the hundred schools’ teachings fail to apply their methods and arts to action, believing their ways cannot be surpassed. Yet if their arts differ, where then lies the ancient Dao and its arts? It is not absent—only that its wholeness is not attained. If its wholeness is not attained, how can the spiritually enlightened descend? When the spirit descends, it gives rise to the sage; when clarity emerges, it brings about the king. The One is the master of the spiritually enlightened—what we call the heavenly person, the spiritually realized person, the utmost person, the sage, and the noble person share the same great essence, differing only in how they are expressed.*

*To speak of the Dao, one must first clarify Heaven, for Heaven is what is revered. Thus, one who does not stray from the source is called a heavenly person. Essence enters the spirit only when it is true; if not true, it does not reach the sage. The sage fully embodies Heaven, and the utmost spirit resides within, unifying virtue and power to initiate transformations—this is the spirit descending to become the sage. When manifested in humaneness, rightness, ritual, and music, suffused with compassion and kindness, it is called the noble person—this is clarity emerging to become the king. Above the sage, one merges with Heaven; below the sage, one merges with humanity.*

*Laws serve as divisions that must not be violated; names serve as standards that must not be confused; conduct serves as verification that must not be deceived; and examination serves as judgment that must not be doubted. All these have their reckoning. Those with many reckonings hold high positions and wield great influence; those with few occupy lower ranks and govern lesser matters. The hundred officials are ordered accordingly. Above, this gives rise to the sage; below, it brings about the king. None is lacking, and thus they match the spiritually enlightened, harmonize Heaven and Earth, nurture the myriad things, and bring peace to the world. They clarify the root’s reckoning without doubt, adhere to the branches’ measures without losing the Way, and are not constrained by the Six Directions. Their movement is boundless. The great essence of the ancient Dao and its arts is like this. As for the spirit, reckoning cannot fathom it, measures cannot gauge it, and it cannot be expressed in written words.*

*What is made clear through reckoning and measures is the domain of officials, who enact their states’ laws and record their traces. As for what lies in the* Odes, Documents, Rites, *and* Music, *the scholars and gentry of Zou and Lu can largely clarify them. From the* Odes *expressing the will to the* Spring and Autumn Annals *expressing names and distinctions, all are manifestations of the ancient Dao and its arts, made clear through reckoning and measures. The former kings applied these reckonings to governance and disseminated them throughout the world, so the hundred schools, when they praised and followed them, did not stray beyond the ancient Dao and its arts.*

*When the world possessed the Dao, the sages and worthies were clear, and the Dao and virtue were unified. Scholars could witness its wholeness and were not misled by strange arts or divergent methods. In times of chaos, the world grasps at partial insights, each prizing their own biased views. Though each possesses strengths, none is comprehensive or all-encompassing—each is but a partial scholar. Heaven and Earth possess great beauty, yet they dissect it; the myriad things have complete principles, yet they analyze them; they examine the ancients’ wholeness, yet the hundred schools rarely embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the spiritually enlightened. Thus, the Way of the sage-kings grows dim, and people each follow their own desires. The Dao and its arts are torn asunder.*

Following the Root:
*Taking Heaven as the source, virtue as the root, and the Dao as the gate—this summarizes the heavenly person, the spiritually realized person, and the utmost person. Taking humaneness as kindness, rightness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony—this describes the sage. Their reckoning is one, two, three, four—each clarified step by step. They are ordered accordingly. Taking affairs as constants, each attends to their duties; taking clothing and food as priorities, they focus on agriculture and sericulture; for propagation, they raise chickens, pigs, dogs, and swine; for storage, they accumulate in granaries and treasuries; for the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed, they show concern. These are the principles of governing the people.*

*The above, from the heavenly person to the noble person, encompasses the entirety of the ancient Dao and its arts. The following laments the differences between past and present. "Praised and followed" refers to the ancient Dao and its arts, including Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Zhou, and Confucius. "The world falls into great disorder" describes the arts of later ages. "Partial insight" means seeing only one side. The people of the world mostly cling to biased views, delighting in their own preferences—like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each with its own clarity yet unable to communicate.*

The ear, eye, nose, and mouth each possess their own knowledge yet cannot communicate with one another; the hundred schools and myriad arts each have their strengths and occasional uses, but those who cling to one side are just like this. Examining the completeness of the ancients—few could embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the bearing of the divine. Observing the ancients’ wholeness, those of partial insight rarely attain the beauty of Heaven and Earth or the demeanor of the divine. To praise and follow the ancients’ universal application is to recognize such beauty.

To act as one’s own method, to make one’s own way—this is the art of self-made schools. Alas! The following laments these differences, each describing the divergences of the various schools.

They do not indulge in later ages, do not waste upon the myriad things, do not dazzle with calculations and measures, but straighten themselves with the carpenter’s line to meet the world’s urgencies. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, some resided in this: Mo Di and Qin Guli heard of its influence and delighted in it, practicing it to excess—calling their own excess "great compliance." They composed *Fei Le* ("Against Music"), decreed "moderation in use," forbade singing in life, and banned mourning garments in death. Mozi advocated universal love and mutual benefit while opposing strife; his Way did not permit anger. He was fond of learning and broad in knowledge, yet did not differ from others nor align with the former kings, instead condemning the rites and music of antiquity. The Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*, Yao had *Dazhang*, Shun had *Dashao*, Yu had *Daxia*, Tang had *Dahu*, King Wen had the music of *Biyong*, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*. In the ancient mourning rites, noble and base had their forms, high and low their distinctions: the Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, great officers three, and scholars two. Yet Mozi alone forbade singing in life and mourning garments in death, using a paulownia coffin of three inches without an outer coffin as his model, teaching others by this. If one fears not loving others through this, then practicing it oneself surely does not love the self. Though Mozi’s Way has not yet failed, to sing yet oppose singing, to weep yet oppose weeping, to rejoice yet oppose joy—is this truly compliance? In life, they toil; in death...

The Way of Mozi is meager and harsh, causing people sorrow and grief—his conduct is difficult to follow. One fears it cannot serve as the Way of the sage, for it turns the hearts of the world against it. The world cannot endure it. Though Mozi alone could bear it, what can he do against all under heaven? Separated from the world, he drifts ever farther from kingship.

Mozi extolled the Dao, saying: "In ancient times, Yu stemmed the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the way to the four barbarians and the nine provinces. He named three hundred great mountains, three thousand tributary streams, and countless smaller ones. Yu personally wielded the basket and spade, dredging the rivers of the world. His calves bore no flesh, his shins no hair; his hair was whipped by fierce winds, his body drenched by driving rain. He established the myriad states—Yu was a great sage, yet his form toiled for all under heaven." If later Mohists take wearing coarse hemp and straw sandals as their garb, laboring day and night without rest, and tormenting themselves to the utmost as their ideal, saying, "If one cannot do this, it is not the Way of Yu, and one is unworthy to be a Mohist," then consider: Xiangli Qin’s disciples, the followers of Wu Hou, the southern Mohists Ku Huo, Ji Chi, Deng Lingzi, and their like—all recite the *Mo Jing* yet diverge in their interpretations, calling one another "separate Mohists." They engage in debates over "hard and white" and "same and different," exchanging criticisms with odd and even arguments that never align. They regard the *Juzi* as a sage and all wish to serve as his representative, hoping to become his successors. To this day, their disputes remain unresolved.

Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions may have been sound, but their conduct was misguided. They would have later Mohists necessarily wear themselves out, their calves fleshless and shins hairless, advancing one another in this alone. This is the height of disorder and the nadir of governance. Yet even so, Mozi was truly one who loved the world. One might seek his like in vain, for though he withered away, he never abandoned his cause. He was a man of talent.

*(Annotations within the original text: "Great Compliance" is also written as "Great Accord," the title of the *Fei Le* and *Jie Yong* chapters of the *Mozi*. "Basket and spade" are also written as "plow and spade"; "nine" refers to gathering, for what he governed was not one, hence "mixed." Straw sandals are made of wood, hemp sandals of fiber. The *Juzi* is one who has mastered the Mohist Way, akin to a great Confucian.)*

*(Guo’s commentary: "Diligent frugality leads to exhaustion, hence no radiance. It is forced and severe. Diligent frugality leaves wealth in surplus and urgency prepared, but excessive compliance exceeds the measure of what the multitude can bear. When goods are insufficient, strife arises. Mohists urge the people to diligence and frugality to ensure surplus, thus deeming strife wrong—not in anger, but in self-denial. Having deemed themselves correct, they wish all things to conform to them, hence their broad yet undiscriminating stance. They do not align with the former kings, for the former kings indulged their many differences before unifying them, allowing all to attain without knowing how. They condemn ancient rites and music for their extravagance, claiming all things should be governed by effort and emotion as expressions of love. Yet by taking diligence and frugality as their law and overdoing it, they seek to enrich the world but instead undermine the very love they profess. The Mohist Way has not failed, but it opposes the Dao and virtue. Though Mozi alone achieved Mohism, he did not harmonize with the nature of the myriad things, hence the question: is this truly compliance? *Hu* means without luster. To say it cannot be the Way of the sage is to say the sage’s Way delights in enabling the people, allowing them to find joy in their nature. When joyful, the world faces no difficulty. The king must unite the world’s hearts and move with things, so one separated from the world is far from kingship. Mozi saw only Yu’s physical toil and not the ease of his nature. Taking self-torment as the ultimate principle, they deem self-denial the perfect method. Yet adhering to a Way out of season, each Mohist clings to his own views, leaving no room for common ground. Hence, within Mohism, they further divide. The *Juzi* is one who can debate his correctness to perfect his conduct. *Shi* means representative; they wish to continue the *Juzi*’s legacy. Their intent lies in avoiding extravagance and preparing for the world’s emergencies, but their excessive conduct is misguided. No disorder is greater than opposing things and harming nature, hence this is the height of disorder. Yet Mohism inverts this, making it the lowest form of governance. Because they truly love, sages and worthies do not oppose them. But it cannot be taught to others, for one seeks their like in vain. Their withering yet unrelenting devotion proves their true love. They are men of talent, though not of virtue.)*

Lü’s Annotation:
When the governance of the former kings reached its height in fame, culture, and the fullness of ritual and music, they did not indulge later generations, nor were they extravagant in material things, nor did they dazzle with measures and standards—this was not their constant way. Using the carpenter’s line to correct themselves was how they prepared for the world’s emergencies. The arts of the Dao in antiquity indeed included this. The Dao embodies constancy while exhausting change, but Mozi saw only the preparation for emergencies and took it as the constant norm. This is what is meant by "grasping one aspect and examining it"—a self-regard that cannot be shared with others.

From his creation of *Fei Le* (Condemnation of Music) to his indiscriminate opposition to all differences, he committed the greatest of excesses. The great compliance he sought was already lost. The former sages established moderation in rites and music and propriety in mourning and sacrifices; now, he would have the living not sing and the dead not be mourned. Unlike the former kings, he destroyed ancient rites and music, practicing such frugality and austerity that he not only failed to love others but also failed to love himself.

Mozi’s original intent was universal love and mutual benefit, yet he did not consider whether people could endure it. He imposed hardship and called it sweet, and few who adopted his austerity avoided failure—yet Mozi’s Dao had not yet collapsed. Joy and sorrow are unavoidable for people; the former sages gave them form and measure, but Mozi would have them sing when they should not sing and weep when they should not weep. Is this truly human nature?

To toil in life and be meager in death, causing people grief and sorrow—though the arts of the Dao in antiquity included this, Mozi carried it to excess. It cannot be called the Dao of the sages. Even if he could endure it himself, how could the world bear it? How far he strayed from the kingly way!

In ancient times, Yu faced the great flood and labored to such an extent—this was what is meant by preparing for the world’s emergencies. Yet Mozi took it as the constant norm, which is incorrect. The intent to labor and prepare for emergencies is right, but to carry it to excess so that the world cannot endure it is wrong. Will this not lead later scholars to compete in self-inflicted suffering?

Diligence and frugality are indeed difficult to practice, yet Mozi excelled in them. Truly, one who loves such things is rare in the world—he may be called a man of talent.

Xun’s Annotation:
"Not indulging later generations" means not opening the way for later generations to extravagance. "Not extravagant in material things" means not treating external things as luxurious. "Not dazzling with measures and standards" means not using rites, music, and regulations for ostentation. "Using the carpenter’s line to correct themselves" means adhering to strict standards to correct their own deviations. "Preparing for the world’s emergencies" means addressing urgent matters without pursuing irrelevant affairs. The arts of the Dao in antiquity indeed included this, yet Mo Di and his followers alone delighted in such teachings and carried them to excess. Thus, their use of the carpenter’s line to correct themselves was taken to the extreme.

"Their great compliance" refers to the restraint from extravagance, luxury, and ostentation, which was their utmost conformity. "Creating *Fei Le*" means that all their actions were things that could not bring joy. "Indiscriminate opposition" means not aligning with the former kings and differing from the common people while also diverging from the former kings’ Dao. Teaching people austerity is hardly a way to love them, yet he practiced austerity himself, never truly loving himself. Thus, no one could fault him, and Mo’s Dao did not collapse.

The following is Zhuangzi’s critique: To not sing when one should sing, to not weep when one should weep, to not rejoice when one should rejoice—does this accord with human nature? Austerity and simplicity indeed stray far from the kingly way.

"Far from this, they did not align with the former kings. The *tuoluo* was a vessel for storing clothes and garments. 'Nine' in 'Jiu Ru Duke Huan' (who nine times convened the feudal lords) is read as *jiu* (to gather). The interweaving and convergence of the world’s rivers form a network of channels that flow into the sea. *Jiaoqiao* refers to service. Xiangli Qin was a man from a place called Xiangli. The followers of the Five Lords were the five ranks of feudal lords—what the *Zuozhuan* calls the 'Five Lords and Nine Earls.' 'Not acting' means not violating; not violating means mutual resonance. The *Juzi* (Great Master) refers to selecting the most eminent among their faction to serve as the embodiment of the sage. All wished to take him as their master, hoping to become the lineage of Dao for later generations. Yet some believed, others did not, and to this day their doctrines remain unsettled—disorder above, order below, with chaos prevailing over harmony. Truly, they were those of the world who ardently sought governance.

Not burdened by custom, not adorned by things, not careless with others, not hostile to the multitude, they wished for the world’s peace to preserve the lives of the people. Their nurturance of self and others was sufficient and then stopped. With this, they purified their minds. Among the arts of the Dao of antiquity, there were those who embodied this. Song Jian and Yin Wen heard of their teachings and delighted in them. They fashioned the *Huashan* cap as a mark of distinction, engaging with all things by beginning with 'distinguishing constraints.' They spoke of the capacity of the mind, calling it 'the conduct of the mind,' seeking harmony and joy to harmonize the world. They proposed establishing a ruler, enduring insult without shame, rescuing the people from strife, forbidding aggression, and ending warfare to save the world from conflict. With this, they traveled throughout the world, persuading rulers above and teaching the people below. Though the world did not accept them, they persistently and loudly advocated without ceasing. Thus, it is said: 'Above and below grew weary of them, yet they forcibly imposed themselves.'

Nevertheless, they did much for others and little for themselves. They said: 'We humbly propose that five *sheng* of rice are sufficient.'"

The master feared he might not have enough to eat, yet his disciples, though hungry, never forgot the world, laboring day and night without rest. They declared: "We must surely bring life to all! How proud and lofty are those who would save the world!"

They said: "The noble person does not engage in petty scrutiny, nor does he lend himself to things that bring no benefit to the world. To make such things clear is no better than abandoning them. Externally, they forbade aggression and ended warfare; internally, they cultivated few desires and shallow passions. Whether in great or small matters, refined or coarse, their conduct was precisely sufficient to reach this point and no further."

Guo's commentary:
*This refers to opposition and defiance. To be content with sufficiency and dare not hope for excess. The Hua Mountain is level above and below, distinguishing constraints to prevent all things from encroaching upon one another. Insistently applying their Dao to harmonize and unite, they sought to establish these two as rulers of all things. To endure insult without shame was to make saving the people their urgent task. Ending strife and warfare—this was their way of harmonizing and regulating. Though the world did not accept them, they persistently and loudly advocated the principle of harmonization without ceasing. To be weary of them yet forcibly impose themselves—this was their way of enduring insult. If one does not rely on their natural transformation but forcibly comforts them, the burden of merit becomes too heavy. To insist on setting aside five *sheng* of rice—this clearly shows they did too little for themselves. 'We must surely bring life to all!'—this meant the people should also repay them."*

Those who embody arrogance and disdain display a lofty and towering demeanor, yet they do not engage in nitpicking but instead practice forbearance and forgiveness. They do not lend themselves to external things but rely solely on their own strength. What brings no benefit to the world is precisely what defines them as saviors of the age. Their conduct reaches this point and no further—they have not yet traversed the empty and boundless.

**Lü’s Commentary:**
Unburdened by worldly conventions, they seek no adornment in things but extend sincerity to others. In ugliness, they do not contend; they wish others to be at peace and seek no excess for themselves. If their hearts harbor discontent, they treat it as filth to be washed away—thus they purify the heart. The chaos of things arises from mutual encroachment and harshness; to distinguish and pardon is the way to quell strife and foster tranquility. The heart, as a thing, admits all without exception—thus it should contend with nothing. These two masters described its capacity and enacted it through harmonizing and uniting, regulating the world. This is called the conduct of the heart, desiring to establish it as the ruler, revering and honoring it. To endure insult without shame, to persistently and loudly advocate without ceasing—this is the Dao of harmonizing and regulating. The ancient arts of the Dao, though present in this, demanded too much of others and too little of themselves. Thus these two masters did not align with it, saying, "Day and night I do not rest in saving the world—surely people will not remain arrogant?" Yet if saviors of the world ignore me, I must still preserve life, unconcerned with dying of hunger. Their conduct reaches this point and no further; beyond this lies what these two masters did not know, for they had not heard the Dao.

**Xun’s Exegesis:**
"Purifying the heart" means laying bare one’s heart. The Hua Mountain’s upper and lower slopes are level—hence the cap symbolizing it is called the "Hua Mountain’s cap." To "distinguish and pardon" is to separate good from evil and forgive what does not reach. Describing the heart’s capacity speaks of its form; "commanding" it is like naming its conduct and function. *Ér* (harmonizing) means to cook thoroughly. An old text mistakenly writes *rì páng* (日傍). The heart’s function is like cooking for others to unite them in joy, making them drink and delight, thus harmonizing the world. They wished to establish this heart as the ruler. They themselves said five *sheng* of rice were enough, yet the master feared hunger, and disciples followed in starvation, walking day and night without rest, saying, "I must surely save the people’s lives!" How could saviors of the world not give their all? Their learning differed in refinement and coarseness, but their conduct reached this point and no further—no distinction of great or small, profound or shallow.

**Gong yet impartial, they formed no factions; though differing, they were without bias. Decisive and without fixed direction, they followed things without duality, unburdened by deliberation, unplanned by knowledge. Toward things, they made no distinctions but moved with them as one. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, some resided in this. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard its influence and delighted in it, taking the equality of all things as their foundation. They said: "Heaven can cover but not bear; earth can bear but not cover; the great Dao can encompass but not distinguish. Knowing all things have what they can and cannot do, thus: *gōu* (partiality) is not universal, teaching does not reach all, and the Dao leaves nothing behind."

Thus Shen Dao discarded knowledge, abandoned the self, and followed inevitability. He drifted with things, taking this as the principle of the Dao, saying: "To know is not to know—pursuing knowledge only brings harm." He mocked those who bore burdens and ridiculed the world’s esteem for worthies. Unrestrained and without conduct, he rejected the world’s great sages. Blunt and decisive, he adapted to things, relinquishing right and wrong. To avoid trouble, he did not rely on knowledge or foresight, unaware of past or future, perilous yet unconcerned. He pushed before acting, dragged his steps in moving—like the whirling of a gust, the spinning of a feather, the grinding of a millstone. Whole and without fault, in motion or stillness without error, never guilty—why? The thing without knowledge has no peril of self-assertion, no burden of using knowledge. In movement or stillness, it does not depart from principle—thus it ends life without praise. Therefore, he said: "Reach the state of the thing without knowledge, and you need not employ worthies or sages. The clod of earth does not lose the Dao, yet heroes laugh together, saying: 'Shen Dao’s Dao is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—how strange!'"

Tian Pian was likewise. He studied under Peng Meng and received his teaching without instruction. Peng Meng’s master said: "The Daoist of old reached the point of neither affirming nor denying." His influence was swift and indescribable, always contrary to others. He did not gather crowds to observe yet could not escape arbitrariness. What he called the Dao was not the Dao, and what he spoke as right unavoidably fell into wrong. Though Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao, in general, they had once heard of it.

Guo's commentary:
["Decisively without a master—each follows its own course. Things attain their inclinations, thus unified and not dual; then there is no partiality, and all is employed universally. Teaching does not reach it; only by entrusting to nature does it attain. *Lingtai* means to listen freely, to let go. Their knowledge and power were shallow, not knowing to entrust to spontaneity, thus they belittled it and drew near to harm. *Xikua* means without task—speaking of not bearing one’s task but entrusting to the multitude. If the multitude each relies on their own abilities, then there is no need for arbitrary imposition or esteeming worthies. Not being a great sage, they sought to destroy their traces so that things would not be ensnared. Though the Legalists were subtle, they still relied on hammer and anvil, thus not yet dissolved into harmony. They could not discern right from wrong, before from after, merely guarding their eyes and indulging their nature to avoid immediate calamity. *Weiran* means entrusting to nature and standing alone. *Tuiye* means to be drawn along, compelled by necessity. Calamity arises from praise; praise arises from establishing oneself. Only the sage can then discard knowledge and artifice, following Heaven’s principle. Thus, the foolish and the wise each occupy their proper place, the noble and the base each hold their fitting position. Worthies and the unworthy follow their nature, yet they speak of ‘no use for worthies and sages’—this is why they did not know the Dao. ‘The clod does not lose the Dao’—it means to discard knowledge like a lump of earth. Only by discarding knowledge and entrusting to nature does spirit and illumination thoroughly shine. This is why they were worthies and sages, yet spoke of the clod not losing the Dao. If a person is like a clod of earth, is that not death? This is why the heroes laughed. Not yet uniting with the ultimate Dao, they became strange and uncanny. ‘Received without instruction’ means attaining the Dao of self-reliance. ‘Neither affirming nor denying’ refers to equalizing the myriad things as foremost. *Wuran* is the sound of wind blowing against; ‘not gathering crowds to observe’ means not conforming to popular expectations. *Yuanduan* means without sharp edges. *Wei* means ‘right.’ The Dao is nowhere absent, yet they spoke of ‘the clod not losing the Dao’—this is why they did not know. ‘In general, they had once heard of it’ means their understanding did not reach it."]

Lü's commentary:
["Not partisan, without self-interest, thus inwardly empty and without a master, therefore uniting with things, neither looking back nor scheming, advancing together with them. The arts of the Dao in antiquity—those that were still and unmoving were what these three delighted in. Responding and thereby penetrating the causes of the world was what these three did not know. Heaven is great, Earth is great, the Dao is great, yet there are things they cannot do. Thus, knowing that the myriad things have what they can and cannot do, if one is partial, then teaching does not reach; only by equalizing with the Dao is nothing left out. Therefore, Shen Dao discarded knowledge, abandoned the self, and followed necessity. *Ling* means to purify its turbidity; *tai* means to remove its disturbance. The ancients entered the Dao through this, not taking this as the Dao. The two masters took the Dao as stopping here, for they did not know that knowledge and the self had never yet possessed things. The myriad things all arise, yet this is why they return; their flourishing is why they revert to the root. This is not enough to disturb my heart. Shen Dao’s principle of the Dao was to know as not knowing; belittling it only then drew near to harm. Only non-knowing is what preserves it. Shen Dao merely knew that knowledge was not knowing but did not know that not knowing was true knowing. *Xikua* means unsettled, unrestrained, without conduct, and not the worthies and sages of the world—this is why he discarded knowledge and abandoned the self. *Chuipai* and *yuanduan*—the next three phrases refer to *lingtai* applied to things: *chuipai* means to forge and refine, *yuanduan* means to break and sever. Flexible, they advanced together with things, thus forgetting knowledge, deliberation, before and after. *Weiran* means to stand alone by entrusting to nature. *Tuiye* means to move only after being drawn along, like a feather in the wind or a groove in a millstone—then the movement is not mine. ‘Reach the state of the thing without knowledge’—thus, without establishing the self, there is the calamity of employing knowledge. In movement and stillness, not departing from principle, thus there is no praise, no fault. Shen Dao took this as the principle of the Dao. Only ‘the clod does not lose the Dao’—knowing the theory of cutting off sageliness and discarding knowledge, yet those who cut off and discard it are precisely the sagely and wise. How then is this different from the principle of the dead? This is why the heroes laughed at it and found it strange in the world. Tian Pian studied under Peng Meng and received without instruction. If one relies on his teaching, it does not reach. It is said that the ancients reached the point of neither affirming nor denying. Their influence was *wuran*—how could it be spoken? It was also guarded. Never having had right or wrong, yet the theory of the knowing not speaking reached the point where their conduct was contrary to others, and desiring not to gather crowds to observe, they could not escape *yuanduan*. The Dao never yet possessed things, thus taking emptiness and non-destruction of the myriad things as reality. Why then oppose others and take *chuipai* and *yuanduan* as their way? What they called the Dao was not the Dao, and what they affirmed was unavoidably wrong, for they were mired in the realm of non-knowing. Though these three did not know the Dao, in general, they had once heard of it. Mo Di and Guli, Song Xing and Yin Wen not only did not know the Dao but had never even heard of it. The Dao originally emerges from the nature and destiny of the emotions, and its truth is for governing the self. Now, Mo Di and Guli’s regulated conduct departed from the world, even to the point of not loving self and others—thus losing the root and truth to an extreme. Therefore, in discussing the arts of the Dao as divided in the world, they first addressed these, then Zhuangzi and Yin Wen, for they knew the Dao. Tian Pian and Shen Dao knew and drew near to it, progressing from the coarse to the refined."]

Xun's edition:
["*Yi* means level and smooth. ‘Decisively without a master’ means encountering matters and acting decisively without first establishing an intention. ‘Following things without duality’ means pursuing matters without generating dual intentions. For example, doing one thing while also generating another intention is to have a mind. Having something to choose is not universal; using it as teaching results in incompleteness. Only by returning to the Dao is nothing lost. *Ling* means the sense of clarity; *tai* means the sense of washing. *Lingtai* applied to things means encountering matters with ease. ‘Knowing as not knowing’—though knowing, one acts as if not knowing. *Bo* and *lin* both mean slight. If one has slight knowledge, then the mind is slightly harmed. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, Hui Shi, and Deng Xi were all contemporaries of King Xuan of Qi, residing at Jixia. Their learning was rooted in the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. See the *Yin Wenzi* and *Xunzi*—*xi* means to endure shame; *kua* means to act alone. *Wu ren* means without anything to employ."]

Releasing restraint and abandoning conduct, indulgent and unrestrained, careless and unconcerned with disciplined action—striking it with a mallet or severing it with a blade, all contend with it in vain. "Wind returns, feathers whirl" suggests a spiraling motion; "grinding through a tunnel" likewise emerges in graceful turns. That which is inert and without knowledge does not lose the Dao.

Yet the heroic and eminent mocked Shen Dao’s teachings, deeming them conduct unfit for the living and principles befitting only the dead, merely strange and astonishing. Tian Pian was no different—he, too, followed Shen Dao’s way.

Peng Meng was Tian Pian’s teacher. Tian Pian studied under Peng Meng and received the teaching of "non-speech." Peng Meng’s own master had once declared: "The Daoist of antiquity reached the point where none could affirm or deny them." Their manner was so utterly still and inscrutable that none could glimpse it—how then could it be expressed in words? Thus Peng Meng, too, spoke nothing. Yet when Tian Pian would return from Peng Meng’s home after long stays, people no longer gathered to observe him. Only two or three would come intermittently, like fish breaking the surface in scattered schools. Though his words no longer startled, some still recognized him.

"Taking the root as essence, the external as coarse; regarding accumulation as insufficiency; dwelling in tranquil solitude with the spirit luminous"—such were the ancient arts of the Dao. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of this teaching and delighted in it. They established it upon the constancy of "non-being" and "being," governed it by the Great Unity, took gentleness, humility, and yielding as its outward form, and emptiness, non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance.

Guan Yin said:
*"Within oneself, nothing abides—yet forms and things manifest of themselves.
In movement, it is like water;
in stillness, like a mirror;
in response, like an echo.
Fleeting—
as if vanished;
silent—
as if purified.
All is the same."*

Those who attain harmony find it; those who lose it never precede others but always follow them. Lao Dan said: *"Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine—become the world’s valley stream. Know the white, yet guard the black—become the world’s deep gorge. All men seek to lead; he alone follows, saying: ‘Accept the world’s filth.’ All men seek fullness; he alone takes emptiness, for he has no hoard. Thus, though seemingly deficient, he abides in surplus."*

In his conduct, he moves slowly yet expends nothing, for he acts without striving. While others laugh at the clever, he alone bends to preserve wholeness, saying: *"If only I may escape blame."* He takes depth as his root and restraint as his guiding principle, declaring: *"What is rigid will break; what is sharp will dull."* Ever tolerant toward things, never carving away at others—this may be called the ultimate attainment. Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! They were the vast and true persons of antiquity.

Guo’s Commentary:
*"To regard accumulation as insufficiency is to entrust it to the world, and thus one has surplus. How can ‘non-being’ and ‘being’ establish anything? To build upon the constancy of ‘non-being’ and ‘being’ is to clarify how things establish themselves. From heaven and earth down to the myriad things, each attains its own nature without borrowing from others—is this not to govern by the Great Unity?*
*‘Within oneself, nothing abides’—when things come, one responds without hoarding, so merit departs with the thing.*
*‘Forms and things manifest of themselves’—not asserting oneself but yielding to the myriad things, so each form naturally becomes distinct.*
*‘In response, like an echo’—this is the constancy of non-emotion.*
*‘Those who attain harmony find it; those who lose it’—to speak of constant wholeness is to know nothing of attainment, for things each guard their own portion and remain silent, without masculine or white.*
*Masculine and white are not prized for victory or self-display. To prize victory and self-display is to chase knowledge beyond one’s portion and endanger one’s life. Thus, the ancients did not follow boundless knowledge but guarded what was within their portion. Only when their nature was whole could they extend to the world; only when they could extend to the world could they return to it like a valley stream. Not contending with the myriad things for supremacy, the world willingly submits without tiring—thus he places himself last.*
*Feminine, black, last, and low—these are what the world calls filth. Those who seek fullness know only ‘being’ as useful, unaware that ‘non-being’ is its function. Those who take emptiness abide in tranquility, awaiting the fullness of things. ‘No hoard, yet surplus’—he entrusts the myriad things to guard themselves, so he need not fear scarcity.*
*‘Abiding in surplus’ means standing alone in self-sufficiency. ‘Moving slowly yet expending nothing’—he acts according to what benefits the people, following the four seasons to completion, ever in accord with the Dao and its patterns, thus free from strain or waste.*
*The clever harm their spirit through striving, but the self-completing vessel arises from non-action. To act without striving is to follow the self-arising, allowing each thing to achieve its own nature. Even spiders can spin webs—every person has their own abilities, so why value the craft of Gongshu?*
*Yielding to the utmost principle preserves wholeness, so without seeking, fortune is sufficient. Following things, they cannot incur blame. The root of principle is the ultimate of the Great Beginning—it cannot be called shallow. ‘Taking restraint as the guiding principle’ is to avoid excess.*
*In utmost compliance, even metal and stone are not rigid; in opposition, even water and vapor are not soft. Compliance preserves; opposition destroys—this is the proper principle. Advancing with haste and boundlessness is sharpness; each guarding its portion naturally has surplus and does not carve away at others, preserving its nature."*

Lü’s Commentary:
*"Taking the Dao as essence makes things coarse; taking things as coarse makes ‘non-being’ essence. The Dao never begins with things, so to regard accumulation as insufficiency is to reach the extreme of emptiness, where only non-accumulation remains. Dwelling in tranquil solitude with the spirit luminous—this is the ancient arts of the Dao, where root and branch, essence and coarse, are all present.*
*Yet if the Dao is fundamentally without things, and at times there are horses, this is still not firmly established. Building upon the constancy of ‘non-being’ and ‘being,’ nothing can uproot it. To speak of ‘one’ is already two; what is called ‘one’ is not the Great Unity. In the Great Unity, even ‘one’ cannot be attained, so the myriad things return to it.*
*The Dao is formless, so it does not contend—thus gentleness, humility, and yielding are its outward form. Observing its form, the substance within can be known. Things each return to their root, and the body is naturally empty. Taking emptiness and non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance differs from those who take hammering and chopping as the Dao.*
*Guan Yin’s eleven phrases all describe the merit of ‘within oneself, nothing abides’ and ‘forms and things manifest of themselves.’ Laozi said: ‘Know the masculine, guard the feminine’—the feminine is still and does not initiate; ‘know the white, guard the black’—the black withdraws and returns to the root. Valleys and streams do not accumulate; gorges respond without hoarding—yet from them flow the sources of rivers and seas. This is what it means to build upon the constancy of ‘non-being’ and ‘being,’ to govern by the Great Unity.*
*Placing oneself last and accepting filth is to take gentleness, humility, and yielding as outward form. Abiding in emptiness without hoarding, thus not destroying things but allowing them to be used—this is why he has surplus, does not precede others but follows them, moves slowly yet expends nothing, differing from those who labor their bodies and exhaust themselves in pursuit of the Dao.*
*Allowing things to be empty of themselves without destroying them differs from inanimate objects. ‘Bending to preserve wholeness and escape blame’—this is what is called fortune. ‘Taking depth as the root’—there is no need for rigidity; ‘taking restraint as the guiding principle’—there is no need for sharpness. Utterly empty and vast, he ever tolerates things and does not carve away at others. Taking the root as essence and dwelling in tranquil solitude with the spirit luminous, what he embodies is the true Dao—this may be called the ultimate attainment. Thus he sighs: ‘Ah, the vast and true persons of antiquity!’"*

Xu’s Commentary:
*"‘Black’ means darkness. Valleys and streams are empty and receptive, so they serve as metaphors—this is what is called the ‘mysterious female.’ ‘Laughing at the clever’ is to laugh at those who strive. ‘Not carving away at others’ is not to encroach upon them."*

Vast and formless, ever-changing and constant, death and life, heaven and earth, the spirit luminous—where does it go? Fleeting, whither does it tend? The myriad things all encompassed, none can return to it. The ancient arts of the Dao were present in this. Zhuang Zhou heard of this teaching and delighted in it. With absurd and boundless words, wild and unconstrained speech, endless and unbounded phrases, he gave free rein without eccentricity, never showing partiality. Taking the world as turbid and unfit for solemn discourse, he used goblet words to ramble, weighty words as truth, and parables to broaden. Alone, he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not disdain the myriad things, nor did he dispute right and wrong to dwell among the common. Though his writings were strange and marvelous, they flowed without harm. Though his words were uneven, they were striking and worth observing. What filled him could not be exhausted. Above, he wandered with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In his grasp of the root...

Vast and expansive, profound and abstruse, grand and unbridled—his grasp of the root may be called harmoniously attuned and ascending to the utmost. Yet in his response to transformation and resolution of things, his principles remain inexhaustible, his arrival unchanging. How radiant! How obscure! That which remains unexhausted—like one who forgets the reality of emotions in boundless absurdity, in wild and unbounded speech—knows no borders.

Zhuang was upright and proper; his writings, strange and marvelous, flowed and turned in accord with things without resistance. Guo’s commentary: *"Without form, without constancy, he followed things as they were. Death and life alike—he entrusted himself to transformation. Where to go? What to seek? Without intent or inclination. Nothing to which things might return, all entrusted to their own placement. At times, he gave free rein without eccentricity, not urgently desiring to make his intent known to things. The turbid world, burdened by form and name, would deem solemn discourse mad and disbelieve it—thus he did not speak. Goblet words, weighty words, parables—all conveyed the utmost principle, perfectly aligning with the nature and destiny of the myriad things. Without disputing right and wrong, he had no right or wrong, thus letting things proceed as they would. His form mingled with things, so he dwelt among the common; returning to accord with things, he remained unharmed. Not merely responding to the affairs of the age, his unevenness was filled with inexhaustible abundance. Zhuangzi spoke with the same equanimity whether explaining himself or others. Examining his words, how vast and boundless they are—like Yu bowing to forthright speech, what fault could there be in this?"*

】Lü’s Annotation【
Without form, thus invisible; without constancy, thus unmeasurable. To regard it as death is to assume it never had life; to regard it as life is to assume it never had death. To regard it as coextant with Heaven and Earth is to assume there was never past or present; to regard it as the coming and going of spirit and light is to assume there was never self or other. Thus it is boundless, non-active, still, and unmoving—yet the myriad things are all encompassed within it, none left unrestrained. Where, then, could they return if not to the workings of the spirit?

With words of absurd vastness and boundless emptiness, untraceable and inexhaustible, he indulged freely yet not carelessly. All had their counterparts, and if not presented as oddities, even if devoid of substance or unconventional, they did no harm to their truthfulness. Solemn discourse still departs from words; goblet words illustrate the endless daily use of the Dao; weighty words and parables serve to engage the times.

People do not believe my words, so I invoke antiquity to lend them weight. When weighty words fail to illustrate, then parables arise. What Zhuangzi embodied was communion with the spirit of Heaven and Earth alone, never condescending to the myriad things—thus his words were likewise. "Condescension" here means estrangement or intimacy.

Not disputing right and wrong, he mingled with the common world. Though his writings were extraordinary and unbroken in their strangeness, they did no harm. "Unbroken" means without gaps; "strangeness" implies a fixed essence yet one unattainable by seeking—nothing the common world could value. His marvelous and uncanny words were unlike anything the common world could despise.

Only because his inner being was full and inexhaustible could he roam above with the Creator and befriend below those beyond death and life, without beginning or end—thus entering the realm of the spirit. His foundation was vast and great, taking Heaven as its宗; one might call this attunement to the highest fulfillment, never departing from the source.

Thus he responded to transformations. His principle was inexhaustible in untying the knots of things. His coming left no trace—meaning form does not wait for molting to dissolve. Vast and obscure, without end, this is the unknowable nature of the spirit.

】 Hui Shi was versatile in many arts; his writings filled five carts; his Dao was contradictory and discordant; his words...

Hui Shi’s teachings on the principles of things declared: "What is supremely great has no exterior—this is called the Great Unity. What is supremely small has no interior—this is called the Small Unity. That which has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet it extends a thousand *li*. Heaven and earth are low; mountains and marshes are level. The sun is just now at its zenith, yet it is already slanting. Things are just now born, yet they are already dying. Great sameness differs from small sameness—this is called the small difference. The myriad things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called the great difference. The south is boundless, yet it has bounds. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the center of the world lies north of Yan and south of Yue. Embracing all things with universal love, Heaven and earth are one body."

Hui Shi took this as his grand vision of the world and enlightened debaters; the debaters of the world delighted in it together. Eggs have feathers; a chicken has three feet; Ying possesses all under heaven; a dog can be a sheep; a horse lays eggs; a *ding*-insect has a tail; fire is not hot; mountains have mouths; wheels do not touch the ground; eyes do not see; fingers do not reach, yet what they reach is unbroken; a turtle is longer than a snake; a square is not square; a compass cannot draw a circle; a chisel does not fit its handle; the shadow of a flying bird never moves; the speed of an arrow has a moment of neither motion nor stillness. A dog is not a hound; a yellow horse and a black ox make three; a white dog with black fur is black; a colt has never had a mother. Take half of a one-*chi* staff each day, and it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.

Debaters used these arguments to engage with Hui Shi, and they never ceased throughout their lives. Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, among other debaters, adorned men’s minds and altered their intentions. They could overcome others in speech but could not subdue their hearts—such was the confine of debaters. Hui Shi daily employed his knowledge to contend with others, especially delighting in the world’s debaters with his strange doctrines. This was his root.

Yet Hui Shi’s eloquence led him to consider himself the most worthy, saying, "Are not Heaven and earth magnificent?" He possessed boldness but no method. In the south there was an eccentric man named Huang Liao who asked why Heaven and earth do not collapse or sink, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline to answer, nor did he ponder before responding. He discoursed on the myriad things without pause, ceaselessly, yet still considered his words too few. He added the bizarre, taking contraries as truth, seeking to prevail over others in reputation. Thus he was ill-suited to the multitude.

Weak in virtue but strong in things, his path was obstructed. Viewed from the Dao of Heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s abilities were like the labor of a single mosquito or ant. What use was he to things? Even if one were wholly devoted, one might still say he was closer to the Dao—but how much more so when he guarded against it!

Hui Shi could not find peace in this; he scattered himself among the myriad things without weariness, ultimately gaining fame for his eloquence. Alas for Hui Shi’s talent—unrestrained yet unable to follow, he exhausted echoes with sound, racing his form against shadows. How lamentable!

[Laozi says: "Much speech hastens exhaustion," and again, "Sparse speech is natural"—thus those who speak do so out of necessity. Yet Hui Shi’s eloquence led him to consider himself worthy, unaware of the vast emptiness of Heaven and earth and his own excessive self-regard. He could not abide in the feminine. It is fitting that he took Heaven and earth as magnificent, possessed boldness, yet had no method.

The sage takes wordlessness as speech, thereby embodying virtue. Now Hui Shi relied on his eloquence, taking contraries as truth and prevailing over others in reputation—thus he knew not the wordless. Enslaved by speech, unable to overcome himself, he was weak in virtue. Seeking to prevail over others in reputation, he was strong in things. His path was obstructed—was this not far from the six penetrations and four openings of the Dao?

The Dao of Heaven and earth is great because of its non-action. Hui Shi’s abilities could not escape self-regard. Viewed from the Dao of Heaven and earth, though vast and eloquent, he was but the labor of a single mosquito or ant. What use was he to things? Unity and multiplicity are both the Dao. Unity is the root; multiplicity is the branch. Though unity alone is insufficient to complete the root and branches, compared to those who forget the root and pursue the branches, one may still say it is closer to the Dao—yet how much more so when guarded against!

Hui Shi did not return to the root to find peace; he scattered himself among the myriad things without weariness, ultimately gaining fame for his eloquence, pursuing branches without return. Without sound, echoes cease; in darkness, shadows vanish; without self, nothing in the world contends with one. Though Hui Shi had talent, he did not emerge from this. Merely engaging in the trivialities of speech to compete with things—how was this different from exhausting echoes with sound, racing form against shadows? His loss of nature was profound. This is why he is deeply lamented and pitied.]

The Perils of Doubtful Singularity

Hui Shi’s sophistry could invert human understanding. At times, he debated the world on numerical absurdities—such as his claim that a chicken has three feet. At others, he disputed names—insisting a dog is not a hound. Or he contested forms—arguing a carpenter’s square is not square. Or colors—declaring a white dog black. Or hierarchy—asserting heaven is lower than earth. Or length—maintaining a millipede is longer than a snake. His arguments largely held that the myriad things possess no inherent distinctions of high or low, long or short; no true differences in form, name, square or round; no genuine separation of green, yellow, black, or white. He made equalizing all things his foremost principle, claiming the great Dao, once dispersed, gives rise to forms and names—all mere fabrications of human bias, nothing more than artificial distinctions.

Hui Shi clung to this doctrine to debate the world, ultimately gaining fame for his eloquence. Yet this was not the way of the ancients, and thus it is not called an ancient art of the Dao. One laments that, though gifted, he ended by chasing things and losing his original truth.

Following the Root

The preceding passages spoke of the arts of the Dao; here, we address the many schools—what are called the "arts of the methods." Their words do not align with principle. They proceed by conjecturing the intentions behind each thing, speaking without depth, so that nothing substantial can accumulate. Yet even what spans a thousand *li* has no depth that cannot be accumulated. Guard against this, and by accumulation, one may reach a thousand *li*. The slanting glance of the sun at its decline can be observed with a sidelong look.

Heaven and earth, mountains and marshes, the sun at its zenith or decline, the life and death of things—all are united as one. If the great is the same while the small differs, this is called "minor sameness and difference." If all is entirely the same or entirely different, this is called "great sameness and difference." Those who dwell in the north, ignorant of the south’s geography, assume it is boundless—yet it is ultimately finite. Though one may say, "I am now traveling to Yue," upon arrival, one knows Yue. It may be said that Yue has already come. The center of the world is unknown, yet the people of Yan and Yue each take their own place as the center—thus the north of Yan and the south of Yue may also be considered the center.

Embracing all things with boundless love, heaven and earth become one body with the self.

The following discusses the kinds of arguments prevalent among the debaters of that time:

Feathers grow within eggs—thus eggs have feathers. Chickens inherently have two feet, yet the act of walking is attributed to intent—hence three feet. Ying was originally a marquisate yet was called a kingdom—thus bearing the title of "possessor of all under heaven." The names "dog" and "sheep" are human designations; if one first names a dog as a sheep, people will call it a sheep. Horses are certainly born from the womb, yet since foals are born with hair, how do they differ from those hatched from eggs? Why limit this to the tails of birds and beasts? Observe the character for "hook" (丁): the character for "child" (子) clearly depicts a tail. Xunzi also said, "Hooks have whiskers; eggs have feathers." This argument is difficult to sustain—yet Deng Xi and Hui Shi mastered it.

The commentary notes: "Hooks have whiskers" refers to the tail of the character 丁. The curve of 丁 forms a hook; "whiskers" and "tail" are akin to fire and heat. In winter, fire is not hot; mountains are still. An echo in an empty valley can emerge from the mouth. The most perfectly round wheel does not tread the ground—*The Artificers’ Record* states, "When advancing, observe the wheel; it should touch only slightly." Nothing is taken from it; it is taken from the circle.

The eye, when obstructed, fails to see; the finger, when overlooked, fails to reach. Even when it reaches, it may not fully grasp. A snake is long, yet a millipede is longer. A tortoise knows good and ill fortune—thus it is longer than a snake. A carpenter’s square is the tool for making squares, yet the square’s body is not inherently square. A compass is the tool for making circles, yet the compass’s body cannot itself be a circle. A chisel is not round, yet the tenon fits into it. The shadow of a flying bird moves, yet the shadow only adheres to the form and does not separate from it—thus it has never truly moved. An arrow may be swift, yet if not loosed, it does not fly; once loosed, it cannot be stopped. Its swiftness lies in the person, not the arrow.

Dogs and hounds are one and the same. Yet if a dog has a suspended hoof, it is called a hound; without it, it is merely called a dog and cannot be called a hound. Horses are one, yet there is also the so-called "yellow"—thus two. The eye may be yellow, yet it is people who call it so.

Is it not three? The black cattle of Li are likewise so. A black dog cannot be turned white, yet a white one can be turned black—thus a white dog may be called a black colt, and an orphaned colt may be said never to have had a mother. A one-foot staff is not long; if today one uses half of it, and tomorrow half of the remainder, turning and using it thus, it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations. At the time, debaters used this to engage with Hui Shi, responding and harmonizing with him, yet throughout their lives they never reached an end. "Heaven and Earth are mighty indeed! To say that my strength is like that of Heaven and Earth—how deluded and absurd! How could man ever surpass Heaven and Earth?" Though Hui Shi possessed a heart of heroic dominance, he lacked the means to surpass others. He began with many methods but ended with none, so that even his methods and techniques were lost.

Weakness in virtue is insufficiency in virtue. Strength over things is adornment through debate. The path is a road; *yu* is winding and crooked. This speaks of the path Hui Shi followed—winding and not straight. Unable to find peace in this, he scattered among the ten thousand things without satiety. Hui Shi could not settle into unity but sought to encompass the ten thousand things, taking this as his ability.

Zhuangzi’s extreme disparagement of Hui Shi reveals his disdain for the strategists of the Warring States. At the end of the compilation, the *Dao* and its techniques are arranged: first the Way of Heaven and Man, the spiritual person, and the perfected person; next the sage, the gentleman; and in later ages, the Way and its techniques fragmented, giving rise to the divergences of the various schools. Hui Shi’s methods and techniques rank lowest of all.

Zhuangzi placed himself after Lao Dan, never daring to eclipse the Six Classics. Having read this far, could there be any remaining chapters?

】

Hong Mai: *Zhuangzi* records Hui Shi’s words: “Take half of a one-foot staff each day, and it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.” Though this is a parable, the principle it embodies is indeed complete. For even as one takes half, crushing it into motes of dust, the remaining half still exists—so it may continue without end.

*Brush Jottings*: From “Hui Shi’s Many Methods” onward, the text aligns closely with *Liezi*’s account of Gongsun Long deceiving the King of Wei, yet interpreters often impose their own conjectures. Fan Wuyin and his disciples once discussed this, saying: “The vast, the strange, the deceptive, and the uncanny—let these be united as one and left unexamined. Why? These are not the words of *Nanhua*; they are the very heterodox and discordant speech he repudiated. What need is there to explain them? Nevertheless, among all that Zhuangzi described, not only Mo Di and Qin Guli’s teachings approach the *Dao*—even Hui Shi’s words contain semblances of it. As Liu Chenweng said: ‘Only because he loved them did he criticize them without realizing it, taking illness for malice. To destroy others to preserve oneself—this is not Zhuangzi.’”

Lu Deming: Master Xiang’s commentary broadly captures the essence of Zhuangzi’s intent. Guo Xiang, in his earlier years, lamented the decadent paths of the elite, and I, too, have belatedly witnessed the vain discourse of the privileged. This is what is meant by “different ages, same customs”—what more can be said? Some ask: “Zhuangzi and Huizi shared the bond of Hao Liang, the model of the Ying craftsman. Yet why are their *Dao* discordant and their words off the mark?” Is their bond like that of the Ying craftsman, who praised the sleeping carpenter’s snore while disparaging his adze? I say: One who seeks to exhaust the divine clarity of teaching through the marketplace of doctrines—how could he not refine his words and exhaust his analogies? Zhuangzi sounded his resonant tones in the Seven Inner Chapters, arranging these writings for posterity. *Chongyan* traverses the paths of the mysterious, while *Congshi* unfolds the sequence of eloquent discourse. Though his words eschew vain debate and his teachings avoid empty chanting, his text is easy to read but his purport difficult to fathom. Those who grasp at meaning without attaining it risk the charge of overreaching. To dispel the flaws in these writings, he thus broadly condemns Huizi’s grand disputations.

Liu Gai’s General Discussion: The body of the *Dao* is vast and all-embracing, leaving nothing outside its scope. Form and number begin with the One, and from there odd and even generate one another. Beyond this point, even the most skillful reckoning cannot calculate it. The ancients followed the order of the great *Dao* and complied with the principles of spirit and clarity, thus establishing the *Dao* of inner sageliness and outer kingship. In matters of measurement and regulation, complexity abounds, yet the root and branches, the One and the myriad, though scattered, remain interconnected. Therefore, one may emerge or withdraw, move or rest, shorten or lengthen, to correct the crookedness of the world and adapt to the unevenness of change. Fu Xi did not lack methods, yet they were perfected under Yao. The Two Emperors did not lack governance, yet it was completed under the Zhou. They did not rush ahead to favor the new, nor lag behind to indulge in the old—this is what sages in high position could not fully exhaust. Yi Yin bore the burden, while Bo Yi corrected it with purity, though purity verged on narrowness. Liuxia Hui tempered it with harmony, neither defying the world to uphold integrity nor following custom to fabricate fame—this is what sages in low position could not fully perfect. The *Dao* reached Confucius and then achieved its grand synthesis, for he appeared once in a thousand or ten thousand years. Above Confucius, sages adapted to their times out of necessity. Below Confucius, the various masters established their schools, each affirming their own rightness. By Zhuangzi’s time, the sages were already distant. *Dao* and *virtue*, benevolence and righteousness were sundered by Yang and Mo; non-action and purity were lost to Tian and Peng. Thus, Song Jian, Yin Wen, and their followers, hearing the wind, gave free rein to their teachings. Zhuangzi sought to restore the *Dao* of Confucius, but it was no longer Confucius’s era. He therefore exalted the supreme *Dao* to correct the world’s baseness, revived non-action and simplicity to sever the world’s floridity, and embraced clarity, emptiness, and stillness to rescue the world’s turbidity. He deemed concise speech insufficient to remedy corruption, so he expounded at length without fixed abode. He deemed solemn words insufficient to enlighten the vulgar, so he spoke wildly without bounds. He favored exalting Lao Dan while placing Confucius below him. In discussing the learning of the hundred schools, he excluded Confucius altogether. For he believed that when the *Dao* had not yet achieved its grand synthesis, even the most expansive true person remained partial. Lao Dan’s book grasped the root of his *Dao*, thus attaining harmony and ascent. Huizi’s book grasped only its branches, inevitably remaining partial. Alas! Which of the masters’ books did not revere Confucius? Yet none understood the basis of his reverence like Zhuangzi. Scholars should seek understanding beyond his words.

**Zhuangzi Yi Appendix**
**Zhuangzi Liepi**

**Sima Biao**
Zhuangzi was a man of Song, named Zhou. He once served as the warden of Meng’s Lacquer Garden and was a contemporary of King Hui of Liang and King Xuan of Qi. His learning spanned all fields, yet its essence ultimately returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, his writings—over one hundred thousand characters in length—were largely parables. He composed the "Fisherman," "Robber Zhi," and "Opening the Box" to censure Confucius’ disciples and illuminate Laozi’s teachings. Figures like "Wei-Lei Xu" and "Kang Sangzi" were mere empty words without factual basis. Yet, his skill in composition, his mastery of rhetoric, and his vivid portrayal of affairs so incisively critiqued the Confucians and Mohists that even the most learned scholars of his time could not defend themselves. His words surged freely, following his own inclinations, and thus even kings and nobles could not esteem him.

King Wei of Chu, hearing of Zhuang Zhou’s worth, sent envoys with generous gifts to invite him, offering the position of minister. Zhuang Zhou laughed and said to the Chu envoys: "A thousand gold pieces are a weighty profit; the post of minister is a lofty position. Have you alone not seen the sacrificial ox of the suburban rites? Fed and fattened for years, adorned with embroidered robes, it is led into the great temple. At such a time, though it might wish to be a solitary piglet, how could it be possible? Go quickly, do not defile me. I would rather disport myself in the mire and filth, finding my own joy, than be fettered by a ruler. I will never take office, that my will may remain unburdened."

**Zhuang Lun**
**Ruan Ji**

On the day of *Yi Shan* in the *Ren Xu* year, at the season when the myriad things begin, in the distant night of late autumn, the Master wandered and soared, riding the wind in his travels. He went along the banks of the Red Water and came to ascend the Hidden Mound, overlooking...

Along the winding path of the axle’s curve, he turned to gaze upon the vast and boundless isle—suddenly he halted, abruptly he rested, unaware why he had journeyed before or why he now remained. Disconsolate and joyless, he turned back in sorrow. In pure white simplicity, at the quiet of midday, he sat at ease, leaning upon his armrest and plucking the zither.

Thereupon, the gentry and the inquisitive, having heard of this, gathered to deliberate, composing phrases and joining lines to address what had long perplexed them. They peered and scrutinized, adjusting their robes, grinding their teeth in anticipation. First one stepped forward, then another followed, treading close behind, advancing together. With measured steps and guarded gaze, they approached, pacing as if in flight, treading the stairs and circling to alight. Shoulder to shoulder they sat, sleeves drawn in reverence, hesitant and clustered—none dared speak first.

Then one among them, the boldest and most commanding, glared fiercely, striking his posture, and declared in a thunderous voice: “Was I not born after the age of Yao and Shun? Reared in the lineage of Wen and Wu? Did I not wander in the flourishing prosperity of Cheng and Kang? In this present age, do I not recite the teachings of the Six Classics? Have I not practiced the traces of our Confucians? My layered robes and soaring cap, my trailing skirts and paired crane emblems—have I not worn them for years? Yet never have I heard of the essentials of the supreme Dao, nor of how they differ from what we have here!”

Then the lesser men echoed the great man’s words, deferring to him, and said, “We wish to hear the supreme teaching to resolve our doubts.” The Master replied, “What then are your doubts?”

The guest said: “The Way of Heaven values life; the Way of Earth values constancy. The sage cultivates these to establish his name. Fortune and misfortune have their divisions; right and wrong have their norms. Pursuing profit and exalted position, loathing death and prizing life—thus the world is at peace and great works are accomplished. Yet Zhuang Zhou levels fortune and misfortune, unites life and death, treats Heaven and Earth as one thing, and the myriad beings as a single finger. Is this not perverse confusion, a loss of constancy, though he takes it for sincerity?”

Thereupon the Master stroked his zither, composed and leisurely, sighed deeply, lowered his head and smiled faintly, then raised his gaze and surveyed all around. Exhaling his spirit, he spoke of what he saw:

“There are those who wish to gaze upon the heights of Mount Langfeng, and so they don their finest caps and robes, mount fine steeds, and ride to the foot of Kunlun—only to perish and never return. Yet caps and robes are but common attire, and fine steeds but ordinary mounts. They are not meant for soaring above the ramparts of Zengcheng or roaming the gardens of Xuanpu.

Moreover, the light of the Torch Dragon does not illuminate a single hall; the mouth of Mount Zhong does not speak within a secluded chamber. Now I shall cast aside the towering heights of Cuiwei and cease the deceptive chatter of Du Yan. By what path may you awaken and return?

Heaven and Earth arise from the natural; the myriad things arise from Heaven and Earth. The natural is without bounds, hence it is called Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth have their bounds, hence the myriad things are born within them. When there are no bounds, who can call them different? When there are bounds, who can call them distinct?

The Earth flows with its dryness; Heaven rises with its dampness. The moon emerges in the east; the sun sets in the west, following one another in turn. When they separate, they are apart; when they unite, they are one. Rising is called yang; descending is called yin. On Earth, it is called principle; in Heaven, it is called pattern. Steaming is called rain; dispersing is called wind. Blazing is called fire; congealing is called ice. Taking form is called stone; taking image is called star. Dawn is called morning; dusk is called darkness. Flowing is called river; circling is called abyss. Level is called earth; piled is called mountain. Male and female share the same position; mountains and marshes share the same qi. Thunder and wind do not oppose each other; water and fire do not repel one another. Heaven and Earth unite their virtue; the sun and moon follow their light. As one body, the myriad things follow their constancy. Entering is called the hidden; emerging is called the manifest. The one qi waxes and wanes, transforms and does not harm.

Thus, deep yin and thunder are not separate emanations; Heaven and Earth, sun and moon are not distinct things. Therefore, it is said: ‘From the perspective of difference, even liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue. From the perspective of sameness, the myriad things are one body.’

Man is born within Heaven and Earth, embodying the form of the natural. The body is the essence of yin and yang; nature is the true disposition of the Five Phases. Emotion is the wandering soul’s mutable desire; spirit is what Heaven and Earth use to govern.

In terms of life, no thing is not long-lived; in terms of death, no thing is not short-lived. From a small perspective, nothing is not small; from a great perspective, nothing is not great. The child who dies young is long-lived; Peng Zu who lived long is short-lived. A autumn hair is great; Mount Tai is small. Thus, life and death are one strand; right and wrong are one thread.

Spoken of separately, eyebrows and eyelashes have different names; discussed together, they are but one hair of the body. The words of the Six Classics are teachings of division and distinction; Zhuang Zhou’s sayings are expressions of intent. Viewed from above, the supreme reaches the limitless; examined in detail, things have their measures.

To hold to the numbers of the decimal system, to scrutinize the names of left and right—this is a partial doctrine. To follow the natural and the nature of Heaven and Earth—this is a discourse of vastness.

Now, the offices of the ears and eyes, the duties of names and distinctions—these are fixed roles. To serve one’s body is not to sever hands and feet or tear apart limbs. Yet later generations, fond of the strange, disregard the root and each claims, ‘I am right.’ Why wait for them to harm life, injure nature, turn back as enemies, sever limbs without feeling pain, see colors without regard to what the eyes perceive, hear sounds without awaiting the mind’s thought, let the mind rush after desires without restraint by what the nature finds peaceful?

Thus, when illness and sores sprout, life is not fulfilled; when calamity and chaos arise, the myriad things are destroyed.

The perfected person is serene in life and tranquil in death. Serene in life, emotions are not confused; tranquil in death, spirit does not depart. Thus, they transform with yin and yang without change, follow the alterations of Heaven and Earth without deviation. In life, they fulfill their years; in death, they follow what is fitting. With heart and qi in harmony, ebb and flow are not diminished.

Therefore, Guangchengzi dwelled on Mount Kongtong to enter the gate of the boundless; the Yellow Emperor ascended the heights of Kunlun to leave behind the root of the dark pearl. Thus, those who conceal themselves find life easy; those who abandon the root find it hard to endure.

Feng Yi, without meeting Hai Ruo, would not have known himself as small. Yun Jiang, without questioning Hong Meng, would not have known himself as young. From this, it is clear: those who assert themselves do not shine; those who establish themselves do not stand. Those who hold to being find support; those who grasp at non-being find nothing to hold. The moon wanes after it is full; the sun sets after it reaches Xianyang. It does not linger at the summit of Yanggu or after the hanging chariot’s descent—it is about to enter.

Thus, those who seek to gain lose; those who contend for clarity are blinded. Those without desire are self-sufficient; the empty and void receive fulfillment.

The mountain is still and the valley deep—this is the Way of the natural. To attain the Way and be upright is the substance of the noble person.

Therefore, those who devise cleverness and craft harm things; those who make right and wrong clear endanger themselves. Those who adorn themselves to appear pure are deluded in life; those who fear death and honor life lose their constancy.

Thus, when the principle of the natural is not followed, Heaven and Earth are not at peace; when the sun and moon vie to follow, morning and evening lose their order; when day and night are not distinct, and all compete and rush for profit, moving recklessly and crossing paths—then father and son are not united, ruler and minister are estranged.

Therefore, to speak again to seek trust is the sincerity of the inferior; to restrain oneself for others is the benevolence of the expansive. Those who steal the pheasant’s classic are the ruined sons of families; those who cut open their bellies and slice their flesh are the rebellious ministers of states. Those who adorn themselves with bright flowers and drink the morning dew are the benighted scholars of a confused age. Those who tread frost and dew, covered in dust, are the greedy and covetous people. Those who purify themselves to blame the world, cultivate their persons to expose filth, are the slanderous sort. Those who multiply citations of right and wrong, abandon substance for ornament, are the deluded class.

Those who are not sincere in pleasing and flattering to seek trust, but don fine pearls and jade to rush into water and fire—these are the ends of Jie and Zhou.”

Those who eat beans and gather ferns, starving side by side to death—such was the extremity of Yan Yuan. Thus, when the paths of fame and profit open wide, the sincerity of loyalty and trust grows thin; when the words of right and wrong stand forth, the purity of deep feeling melts away.

Therefore, the utmost extreme of the Dao is undivided unity, all things as one body, gain and loss unheard of. Fu Xi wove barriers, and Shennong taught plowing: those who defied them died, those who followed them lived—how could they have known that greed and filth were punishments, while integrity and purity were but names? If the essentials of utmost virtue required nothing beyond the self, the great balance would be naturally pure and unchanging in its principle, clear and still, empty and vast, awaiting all things. Good and evil would not be divided, right and wrong would have no contention, and the myriad things would return to their places and find their true nature.

After the rise of the Confucians and Mohists, the debates of "hard and white" arose together, fortune and misfortune linked to things, gain and loss lodged in the heart. Disciples gathered in factions, and arguments clashed. Once, the heroes of Great Qi and the knights of the Three Jin states confronted one another, eyes wide and chests bared, distinguishing this from that. All believed that the life of a hundred years was hard to attain, while the passing of days and months was fleeting and uncertain. Thus, they adorned their carriages and horses, refined their clothing, polished their pearls and jade, decorated their curtains and screens, going forth to flatter their lords and superiors, entering to deceive their fathers and elder brothers. They forced their talents and wits, vying and contending, scheming and maneuvering. Families were ruined by clever sons, states were lost by talented ministers. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but instead brought great harm upon themselves—how excessive their conformity to worldly customs!

Therefore, the trees in the mountains, vast in their roots, remain unharmed, their myriad hollows harmonizing in an instant. The wild geese are gone, their substance lost, their patterns muddied; life and death bring no change, yet the tortoise is treasured for knowing fortune and misfortune. Thus, the perfected person purifies their substance and muddies their patterns; life and death bring no change, and they have never begun to speak of distinctions. Those who fracture words engage in discourse that harms the Dao; those who split hairs initiate the destruction of virtue. The division of qi is an illness of the body; a divided heart is the affliction of the myriad things.

Thus, those who adorn themselves and lean on their chariots’ rails, whose conduct is riddled with entanglements and whose thoughts dwell on success and failure, sit and seek adversaries; those who cross barriers and assault perilous heights are the people of the Zhao state. Those who would lift mountains to fill the sea are the people of Yan and Chu. Zhuang Zhou saw them as such, and so he expounded the wonders of the Dao and the roots of non-action, using parables to broaden his meaning and borrowing things to extend it, merely to amuse his heart in non-action and wander freely in the world. How could he have sought the gates of Xianyang or contended in debate at Jixia?

Those who are skilled in receiving others guide them and nothing more, offering no resistance. Thus, when Gong Meng Ji Zi wore embroidered robes to see Mozi, Mozi did not attack him. When Zhongshan Zi Mu’s heart was in Wei but Jianzi did not reject him, he followed the reason for their coming, employed the means of their arrival, complied with and reassured them, allowing them to settle themselves, opening and unfolding them so they might express themselves. Moreover, what is there to say of Zhuang Zhou’s book? Have you not yet heard the discourse on the Great Beginning, the subtle words of high antiquity? Simply be without harm to things, and form will arise; do nothing to destroy, and spirit will be clear. Form and spirit are within me, and the Dao and virtue are complete. Loyalty and trust do not depart, and above and below are at peace. Now, this guest’s talk aligns with the ancients in speech but diverges in intent—his heart can guard its root, but his mouth does not wait upon it.

Thus, these two or three followers, swayed by the wind and tossed by the waves, looked at one another, their pulses disordered, their order lost, stumbling and losing their way, following and gazing after him. In the end, they knew it was without substance, their qi spent, and they were ashamed and disheartened in their decline and seclusion.

Wang Anshi’s *On Zhuangzi*:

Those who discuss Zhuangzi in the world do not agree. Scholars of the Confucian tradition say: Zhuangzi’s book is devoted to slandering Confucius to validate its heterodox doctrines. It must be burned, its followers abolished, and only then will matters be settled. Its right and wrong are certainly not worth discussing. Such are the words of Confucian scholars.

Yet those who favor Zhuangzi’s Dao say: Zhuangzi’s virtue does not allow the myriad things to disturb his thoughts, and he is able to trust his Dao. He is not ignorant of benevolence and righteousness but considers them too small to practice. He is not ignorant of ritual and music but considers them too shallow to transform the world. Thus, Laozi said: “When the Dao is lost, then virtue; when virtue is lost, then benevolence; when benevolence is lost, then righteousness; when righteousness is lost, then ritual.” This shows that Zhuangzi was not unaware of the meaning of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. He considered them the branches of the Dao and thus belittled them.

The words of the Confucians are good, yet they have never sought Zhuangzi’s intent. Those who favor Zhuangzi’s words certainly know how to read his book, yet they too have never sought Zhuangzi’s intent. By the time of Zhuangzi, the transforming influence of the former kings had been exhausted. The customs of the world were steeped in deceit and cunning, and simplicity and honesty had scattered and vanished. Even the scholars and great men of the age did not know the Dao of valuing the self and demeaning things. Thus, they cast aside the threads of ritual and righteousness, seized and plundered at the junctures of profit and harm, pursued gain without shame, and sacrificed themselves without resentment. Gradually, they sank and drowned until they could not be saved.

Zhuangzi lamented this and devised his teachings to correct the world’s ills and return it to uprightness. His heart was overly concerned, for he believed that benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music were insufficient to set things right. Thus, he equalized right and wrong, unified self and other, and made profit and harm one—this was enough for his heart. This was how he corrected the world’s ills. Yet having corrected the ills with his teachings, he feared that later generations would take his words as reality and fail to see the purity of heaven and earth or the greatness of the ancients. Thus, in the final chapters, he grieved in his heart and explained himself.

Therefore, his chapters say: “The *Odes* express the will, the *Documents* express affairs, ritual expresses conduct, music expresses harmony, the *Changes* express yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* express names and divisions.” From this, we see that Zhuangzi was not ignorant of the sages. He also said: “For example, the ear, eye, nose, and mouth each have their clarity but cannot communicate with one another, just as the hundred schools and various arts each have their strengths and are useful at times.” Thus, he made clear that the complete Dao of the sages lies in that and not in this, yet he also listed his book among those of Song Jian, Shen Dao, Mo Di, Lao Dan, and others, all partial and one-sided scholars of a single corner. This was to make clear that his words were composed for a purpose, not the complete Dao in its entirety.

Thus, was Zhuangzi not concerned with the world’s ills and preserving the sages’ Dao?

The purity of Boyi and the harmony of Liuxia Hui were both deliberate corrections of the world’s ways—Zhuangzi applied his mind in the manner of these two sages. Yet Zhuangzi’s words could not but be reckoned heterodox, for his corrections overreached. When one corrects a crooked thing, one seeks to make it straight; but if the correction overreaches, it returns to crookedness. Zhuangzi himself said of Mozi: “His mind was right, but his conduct was wrong.” Yet if we extend Zhuangzi’s own mind to examine his conduct, how was he different from Mozi? Later readers of Zhuangzi who approve the intention behind his book rather than its doctrines may be called true readers. This, too, is what Zhuangzi would have wished of those who read his work in later ages.

Today’s readers wield Zhuangzi to disparage the Confucians, saying: “The Dao of Zhuangzi is vast—beyond what the Confucians can comprehend!” They do not seek his intent but prize only what differs from the Confucians. How lamentable! Zhuangzi’s critique of the world below, his disparagement of the Zhou, his rejection of Yao, Shun, and Confucius—when I examine his book, I see that his words were merely allegorical. Mencius said: “In interpreting the *Odes*, one must not be hindered by the text nor by the phrasing; one must meet the intent with one’s own intent—this is the way to grasp it.” To read the text without tracing it to its intent is why those who defend the Zhou find cause to dispute.

Zhou [i.e., Zhuangzi] said: “Above, one must act without purpose to employ the world; below, one must act with purpose to be employed by the world.” He also claimed to dwell amid benighted rulers and chaotic ministers, thus impoverished and unable to display his talents. Yet who could accept that all of Zhou’s words were unfit for the relations between ruler and minister, father and son, or that he met his age and master in such a way that he could never act? When he cited the sacrificial ox of the grand ancestral temple to decline Chu’s invitation, he was merely using shocking words to frighten the mediocrities of a declining age. With Zhou’s talents, how could he have been confused about the proper course of action or so fixated on fearing the ox? He was likely the sort of man Confucius described as “dwelling in seclusion and speaking freely.” Yet Zhou’s doctrines, in reversing the Dao, naturally offended the followers of the sages.

What the average person can attain, the sage explains in detail and practices with care. If the explanation is not detailed or the practice not careful, the world suffers. What the average person cannot attain, the sage conceals in his heart and speaks of only briefly. If what should be brief is made detailed, the world is confused. Those who must be instructed repeatedly before they understand, who must be badgered before they submit—how could they be the ones “with whom one can discuss higher things”? Alas! Zhou was eloquent but did not grasp this.

**Record of the Zhuangzi Shrine**

Su Shi

Zhuangzi was a native of Meng. He once served as the keeper of the Lacquer Garden in Meng. Though over a thousand years have passed since his death, Meng had never established a shrine in his honor. County Magistrate and Secretariat Drafter Wang Jin first built this shrine and sought an inscription for its record.

According to the *Records of the Historian*, Zhuangzi was a contemporary of King Hui of Liang and King Xuan of Qi. His learning was vast, yet its essence ultimately returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, the over one hundred thousand characters he wrote were largely parables. He composed *The Fisherman*, *Robber Zhi*, and *Opening the Box* to criticize Confucius’ disciples and illuminate Laozi’s teachings—this is what those who only superficially understand Zhuangzi know.

I, however, believe Zhuangzi was in fact aiding Confucius, though his methods were not to be taken as a model. Consider the Prince of Chu, who fled in disguise and was blocked by a gatekeeper. His servant twisted his staff and cursed, saying, “A mere gatekeeper dares not let the prince pass!” The servant’s actions were perverse, yet if one judged him for not loving the prince, he could not serve as a model for serving the prince. Likewise, Zhuangzi’s words often appear to oppose Confucius on the surface but covertly assist him. His straightforward teachings are few, and even in his criticisms of Confucius, his true intent is subtly revealed.

In his discussion of the *Dao* and its arts across the world, he grouped together Mohists like Mo Di and Qin Guli, as well as Peng Meng, Shen Dao, Tian Pian, Guan Yin, and Lao Dan, all the way to himself, treating them as one school—excluding only Confucius. This is the height of reverence! Yet I have long doubted whether *Robber Zhi* and *The Fisherman* truly criticize Confucius, for *Yielding the Throne* and *Discourse on Swords* are shallow and far from the *Dao*.

But when we examine the conclusion of his parables, we find: Yang Ziju traveled west to Qin and encountered Laozi. Laozi said, “With your haughty gaze and arrogant bearing, who would wish to dwell with you?” Yang Ziju’s expression changed. When he departed, the innkeeper’s family welcomed him, the master offering a mat and his wife a towel and comb, while the servants cleared the seats and the cook left the stove. When he returned, the innkeeper’s family vied with him for the best seat.

Discard the four chapters—*Yielding the Throne*, *Discourse on Swords*, *The Fisherman*, and *Robber Zhi*—and Zhuangzi’s work aligns with the chapter on Lie Yukou, which states: “Lie Yukou was traveling to Qi when he turned back midway, saying, ‘I am astonished! I ate at ten inns, and at five of them, they served me first.’ He then understood and laughed, saying, ‘This is indeed a single lesson.’”

Zhuangzi’s words are not yet complete when the ignorant pluck them to suit their own ends. I cannot but clarify: the division of chapters and naming of sections all stem from世俗俗 conventions, not Zhuangzi’s original intent.

**Parting Gift**

Pan You

Zhuangzi said: “Gain comes with timing, and loss follows compliance. Abiding in timing and complying with change, sorrow and joy cannot enter.”

I have always cherished these words. “Gain” refers to life itself—from one year to two, up to a hundred, from youth to maturity, from maturity to old age. The passage of years cannot be refused. Is this not gain coming with timing? “Loss” is likewise—from one year to two, up to a hundred, as dusk loses dawn and today loses yesterday, from maturity losing youth, from old age losing maturity. The departure of years cannot be detained. Is this not loss following compliance?

All things under heaven are thus: coming cannot be avoided, and going cannot be detained. Therefore, abiding in timing and complying with change, sorrow and joy cannot enter. The enlightened know that I cannot control things, nor can things control me. The two do not interfere, so one drifts freely, expands boundlessly, and follows nature.

Thus, acting without knowing why it is so, one views the affairs of the world as a speeding chariot passing over an anthill—encountering them is not gain, and departing them is not loss. How then could one distinguish gain and loss within them or entangle sorrow and joy in their convergence?

Take a person from one year to two, up to a hundred: amid these years, gain and loss, sorrow and joy intermingle in profusion, burdensome and vexing. In their moment, sorrow brings unshakable gloom, and joy brings unalterable delight. Yet when the moment passes and one reflects, one awakens—this awakening, too, is but a dream. Then the former delight and gloom appear as mere delusion. Thus, those who come after will view the present as the present views the past.

Why should today’s losses trouble one like the sting of a scorpion? South of Yan and north of Yue, where the sun and moon arise, is called the Central Kingdom. Where the sun and moon rise and set is called day and night. Within these bounds, those who bear teeth, grow hair, eat grain, and wear silk are called humans. The stirring of a single nature is called the Great Change—speaking of nature’s mutability, its instability. Some become human, some become other creatures; it depends on what nature favors. Hard and soft, moving and still, endlessly varied—these are called things. Calling to one another by sound is called naming. Multiplying things gather for advantage—this is called profit. Heads gathering in throngs—this is called affairs. Affairs pass, and one records them in the heart, now as joy, now as sorrow, now as resentment. Though their names are many, all are transformations of a single mind.

In the beginning, there was nothing; in the end, what will remain? Here, one divides self and other: the other calls me "other," and I call the other "other." The other calls itself "I," and I, too, call myself "I." If we point at one another, all are "other"; if we point at ourselves, all are "I." Yet in the end, none knows who is "other" and who is "I." Even the sage cannot determine this—yet still, one forcibly imposes order upon it.

Thus, some name them Shang and Zhou, others name them Qin and Han. They strip the skin from bamboo and silk, cut it into slips, and call it *jian* and *jian*; they bind the tips of brushes, dip them in cinnabar and ink, and let them move across the surface—this is called "writing." Gathering such matters and recording them is called "classics and records." Later generations regard them as "studying antiquity," emulating one another age after age without cease. Some attain the Dao through them, while others drown in the mind—this is called "learning." Yet from ancient times to the present, all who bustle about within it share but a single stroke.

Within that single stroke, they scheme for ten thousand generations of affairs—how is this different from one who, waking, frets over dreams, and dreaming, frets over waking? The sun, moon, and stars, the hills and mounds, rivers and marshes remain as they were. Those with teeth and hair, the hard and soft, the moving and still—all continue endlessly. As for the so-called Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Han, some fought to gain them, others fought to lose them—what remains of them now?

When I regard them now, it is as one awake regards a dream. How much better to embody the Dao, settle the nature, and take clarity and emptiness as one’s task! The affairs of the world, before they arrive, have no form. In the present moment, they do not abide. Once past, they are as though they never were.

Here now, what more do I seek in my restless striving? Yet those bound by greed and love of profit, their hearts shackled to gain and loss, are as cramped as colts beneath the yoke. How might they attain the untrammeled freedom of Liezi, whose words resounded like thunder, or Zhuang Zhou, whose speech roared like wind scorching the world’s yokes and releasing its colts—vast and unbounded, returning to the realm of no-thing, even to the point of no words?

What I have said before is thus: it is your conduct, sir. I record these words as a parting gift. You, who are so severely cramped—your heart is already sick. Might you hear these words and find your illness cured?

**Miscellaneous Sayings**

Wang Pang:
The sage has *lunyì* (discourse and deliberation) but no *biàn* (disputation). The various masters have *biàn* but no *lunyì*. Those who *lunshuō* (discuss and expound) stop at exposition; those who *yìpíng* (deliberate and evaluate) stop at evaluation. Those who *biàn* (dispute) merely argue the right and wrong of affairs—nothing more.

Beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss. Within the six directions, the sage deliberates but does not evaluate. The *Chunqiu* evaluates but does not dispute—its traces of ordering the world consist in evaluation alone. The sage has deliberation.

The sage’s deliberation is not by choice—how could it compare to the common people, who exhaust themselves in disputation to impress one another?

In Zhuangzi’s book, the question of *wangliang* (shadowy reflections) and the shadow is posed: the shadow’s being a shadow seems to depend on form, yet in truth, it does not. The ignorant take rising, sitting, bowing, and lifting to be bound to form, yet how could the shadow truly depend on form? To insist that the shadow must depend on form, and form must depend on the Creator, is to fail to fathom *duhua* (solitary transformation). One who fathoms solitary transformation knows the shadow does not depend on form, nor form on the Creator—it culminates in nothingness. Thus it is said: how could one know the *suoyiran* (reason for being so) or *buran* (not being so)?

Zhuangzi speaks of dreaming he was a butterfly to express his self-contentment; he speaks of the joy of fish to express his self-delight. The butterfly, though small, flits and soars without limit. The fish, dwelling in the depths, preserves its life. Thus he lodges his meaning of self-contentment and self-preservation in these two creatures, aligning them with the harmony of all things.

*Zhiyan* (goblet words) are words that do not adhere to one form. Words that do not adhere multiply endlessly when set in motion—hence it is said: “Daily they emerge, never one.” Yet their emergence must have a root—hence it is said: “Harmonized with the *tianni* (natural celestial boundary).” *Tianni* is the wondrous root of spontaneity. Words with such a root respond to change without end—hence it is said: “Following it, they unfold boundlessly.” Words that respond to change without end transcend the limits of past and present, yet my own words know no such limit—hence it is said: “Thus they exhaust the years.” Though Zhuangzi’s words may seem unbounded and varied, they never depart from the root of the Dao. Thus Guo Xiang called him one who “knew the root”—this is what it means to understand Zhuangzi deeply.

What all things follow is the Dao. The Dao is what things follow, yet it is not confined to them. In greatness, it never exceeds; in minuteness, it never omits. Thus the natures and capacities of the ten thousand things each have their proper measure, and this is why Zhuang Zhou’s book speaks of the *kun* and *peng*, the cicada and fledgling dove, the quail and wren, the ant and sheep, the fish and butterfly, the horse and ox, the mountains and trees. The root of the Dao lies before the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate) yet is not lofty; it lies beneath the six poles yet is not deep. Before heaven and earth existed, it was not ancient; from antiquity it has endured, older than the oldest ages yet not long-lived. The ten thousand things differ—this is called *fu* (wealth); the harmonizing of differences is called *dafu* (great wealth); possessing them is called *daye* (great enterprise)—this is the sage.

Only after form exists does name arise; only after name exists does division arise; only after division exists does *shou* (guardianship) arise. Zhuangzi said: “Once form and name are clear, division and guardianship follow.”

Zhuangzi’s meaning in saying “not breaking the *moye* sword” or “not resenting the flying tile,” and his meaning in “not raging at the empty boat,” are the same. Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons have bright patterns yet do not deliberate; the ten thousand things have accomplished principles yet do not explain. Thus Confucius wished to be wordless, saying: “What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born.” Who but one who embodies the Dao could attain this?

Following one’s nature is spontaneity; cultivating the Dao is making it so. Spontaneity is Heaven; making it so is man. Within spontaneity, there is being; beyond making it so, there is nothingness. How can man take away what he has or add to what he lacks? Thus what one has is one’s nature; what one lacks is what Zhuangzi called *chi* (excess). Virtue is what one already possesses. To add to what one already possesses is excess—hence it is said: “The conjoined toes and extra fingers arise from nature yet are excessive in virtue; the dangling growths and hanging wens arise from form yet are excessive in nature.”

The gentleman’s path has its limits of success and failure, but the sage’s Dao knows no dullness or sharpness. What people see is the “so.” The gentleman’s path has its limits, but his heart knows no difference between success and failure—hence it is said: “In failure, he delights; in success, he delights.” He takes success and failure as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain.

Zhuangzi said: “Do not let *gu* (habit) destroy *ming* (destiny).” Human ways are called *gu*; Heaven’s ways are called *ming*.

The Dao is like the year; the sage is like the seasons. Thus Zhuang Zhou wrote *Autumn Floods* to speak of *shizhi* (timeliness)—being timely is simply being of one’s time. Yet how fitting that petty scholars point to this and criticize it! No wonder he raged that one cannot speak of ice to a summer insect or of the sea to a well frog.

Zhuangzi said: “Yan Hui has forgotten benevolence and righteousness.” Yet he had not yet forgotten ritual and music. Benevolence and righteousness are forgotten first, ritual and music later—does this mean benevolence and righteousness are inferior to ritual and music? Zhuangzi first speaks of forgetting the inner, then the outer: benevolence and righteousness are inner; ritual and music are outer. Only when inner and outer are forgotten can one attain *zuowang* (sitting in forgetfulness). This is why his words differ.

The sage takes the necessary as unnecessary; the common people take the unnecessary as necessary. What does this mean? The great man’s words need not be trusted, his actions need not be decisive—he takes the necessary as unnecessary. Words must be trusted, actions must be decisive—this is taking the unnecessary as necessary. Zhuangzi’s words sometimes resemble those of sages and worthies; one cannot wholly dismiss them.

The sage does not establish intentions, yet intentions always remain; he does not possess a self, yet the self always exists. He moves only when pressed; he rises only when compelled. He does not move with intention, nor rise with a self—it is merely response. Zhuangzi said: “One who objectifies things is not objectified by things.” This aligns with Xunzi’s words: “One who is refined in the Dao objectifies things.” Stillness is the root; movement is the branch. Stillness in harmony with things is constant; movement in response to things is the sage. Stillness in separation from things, movement in conflict with things—this is the common people. The sage objectifies things; the common people are objectified by things—thus it is.

Confucius said: “The noble person studies to attain the Dao.” Zhuang Zhou said: “The Dao cannot be attained.” Confucius said: “As virtue, the *Doctrine of the Mean* is supreme.” Zhuangzi said: “Virtue cannot be reached.” Why is this? Confucius speaks of it as residing in man; Zhuang Zhou speaks of it as residing in Heaven. If it resides in Heaven, it is the Dao of spontaneity—how can it be attained? If virtue is self-attained, how can it be reached? If it resides in man, then without profound cultivation of the Dao, how can one attain the Dao? Without daily renewal of virtue, how can one attain virtue? Only one who can attain it may then not attain it; only one who can reach it may then not reach it.

Zhuang Zhou’s writings delve into the mysteries of nature and destiny, unraveling the scattered threads of Dao and virtue. They aim to dispel obscurity and replace it with clarity—this is the discourse of returning to the root and recovering destiny, the words that shatter measuring cups and break scales, from which such teachings arise. Yet though the Dao resides in the heart and converges in the mind, if one questions the Dao and receives no response, what need is there for words? For while wordlessness may suffice to exhaust the subtleties of the Dao, silence alone cannot make them manifest. Thus, one rises only when compelled, moves only when pressed, responds only when stirred—then mounts one’s discourse and carries it forward, enabling learners to grasp the meaning beyond images, and the images beyond words. This, too, is Zhuang Zhou’s intent in hoping to influence the world.

Zhuangzi spoke of the marsh pheasant confined in a cage, having lost its true nature. The utmost person of antiquity could forget their cunning mind, still their external concerns, align their heart with the great void, harmonize the Dao with yin and yang, and unite Heaven and Earth as one. For them, morning and eternity were a single storehouse; no person was strange, no thing too near or too distant. This transcends all bounds, unlike the marsh pheasant trapped in a cage.

Zhuangzi said: “The true person of antiquity made mistakes without regret; when rightness was unattainable, they did not force it.” Thus, even the sage is not without error. To err without self-reproach is to align with Heaven. If one aligns with others, there is correction without reluctance—this is why all look up to them. Yet winter’s warmth and summer’s chill are Heaven’s errors; if even Heaven errs, how much more the sage? Great fear is called dread; small fear is called anxiety. Zhuangzi said: “Great dread is boundless; small anxiety is restless.”

Zhuangzi’s writings penetrate the division of nature and destiny without being swayed by life and death, fortune and misfortune—they approach the sage. Without luminous wisdom, one cannot attain this. Even studying the words of the sages suffices to reach it; those who fail to do so and sink into Zhuangzi’s teachings create great disorder.

When the qi of night prevails, the myriad thoughts are stilled; if one cannot stabilize it, this is called “not attaining morning clarity.” To attain morning clarity is to recover the root of virtue.

There is that which surpasses the sage in stirring and animating the myriad things—this is spirit. That which shares the sorrows of the myriad things is the sage. If spirit is not sagely, it cannot act; if the sage does not act, they do not withdraw. Zhuang Zhou’s words exalt spirit and demean the sage—this is an overcorrection.

Zhuangzi said: “From its root, from its origin—the root is one.” In trees, the root lies below; the root of a tree ends at *gen* (the trigram of stillness). The root emerges from the origin, and the origin clings to the root—they depend on each other to live. Thus, the origin is destiny; the root is nature. Laozi said: “Return to the root” and “stillness”—this speaks of nature. “Stillness is called recovering destiny”—this speaks of the origin. In Zhuangzi’s writings, there are the “true person” and the “utmost person”: “true” speaks of their nature; “utmost” is the pinnacle of the human Dao.

Clarity is the dispersion of spirit; spirit is the storehouse of clarity. Thus, clarity arises from where spirit is directed. Therefore, it is said: “Clarity cannot surpass spirit.”

Laozi said: “The gate of Heaven opens and closes.” Zhuangzi said: “The gate of Heaven has no existence.” Because the myriad things emerge from it, it is called “opening and closing”; because the myriad things are stored within it, it is called “no existence.”

Zhuangzi’s words on the “primordial vastness” refer to the boundless expanse—endless, yet also without end. The myriad things flourish and take form within it—this is what is meant by “its limit unseen.”

The myriad things are complete within Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth have no intention toward them. Thus, it is said: “Great completeness is like Heaven and Earth—what need is there to seek it?” The myriad things are also complete within my body, yet I do not externally labor for things. Thus, it is said: “One who knows great completeness has no seeking.” In this way, one attains the Dao without loss. How can one abandon the self to chase things? Therefore, it is said: “No loss, no abandonment; do not let things alter the self.”

Zhuangzi said: “There are names and realities—these are the dwellings of things.” This means: in substance, it is substance; in function, it is function—this is how the myriad things arise. “Without name or reality—this is the emptiness within things.” This means: unseen, unheard, yet it must gather in emptiness. What can be spoken or conceived grows more distant; wordlessness and thoughtlessness bring the Dao closer.

Zhuang Zhou’s writings convey the subtleties of the Dao. Their words save nature and destiny before they scatter, awakening the world’s customs—how could they not be rooted in the Dao? The Dao is the sea; the sage is the hundred rivers. The Dao is the year; the sage is the seasons. Though the hundred rivers differ, what they share is the sea; though the four seasons differ, what they share is the year. Though the Daos of Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, and Zhuangzi adapt to different times, in essence, do they depart from this? To read Zhuangzi’s writings, seek their meaning and forget their words—this is the way of the good reader.

**Li Shibiao’s *Dream of the Butterfly*:**

The myriad things share a single root; right and wrong are one qi. What is Zhou? What is the butterfly? To take Zhou as not the butterfly is to fail to forget the self; to take the butterfly as not Zhou is to fail to forget things. Self and things oppose each other, giving rise to a thousand tangled forms—this is called “uneven,” but it is merely delusion. Do not know that things are inherently without things? Even the butterfly is not the self. Do not know that the self is inherently without self? Even Zhou is an illusion. How could there be division?

Flitting about in a dream as a butterfly—then the butterfly is Zhou. Startled awake as Zhou—then Zhou is without the butterfly. This is what is seen alone, yet what is equal in things.

To regard one’s body as private, to cling to the myriad things, to take waking as the opening of form and affairs as real, to take dreaming as the mingling of souls and illusions as empty—this is not knowing that a single night’s waking and dreaming are the opening and closing of one form.

A single form’s opening and closing, a single nature’s coming and going—such is the Way. To transform into a thing brings sorrow; to return to being human brings joy. Yet why should things be worthy of sorrow? Why should being human be worthy of joy? This is merely the ceaseless flux of the ten thousand transformations, without beginning or end.

To cling to one’s form, secretly cherishing it as private—this is delusion. Only with great awakening does one know the great dream; only with the true person does true knowledge arise. The dreamer does not know the awakened, so does not take the dream as delusion. The awakened does not know the dream, so does not take awakening as real. Zhou does not know the butterfly, so does not take the butterfly as non-butterfly. The butterfly does not know Zhou, so does not take Zhou as correct. The numinous source is profound and still—wherever it touches, all is known. Transformations arise in succession, yet it meets each without choosing, and the mind has never once possessed knowledge.

Thus, this chapter establishes Ziqí’s "mourning the self" to open the gateway of "equalizing things," and lodges Zhuang Zhou’s "dreaming of the butterfly" to complete the meaning of "equalizing things." Alas! The whole world is asleep, and the world is but one dream. The oak of the sacred grove warned a man in a dream; the turtle of the Yuan Lord sought escape in a dream; the laborer of the Yin family found joy in a dream; the man of Zheng who caught a deer sued over it in a dream; and Huaxu wandered the emperor’s realm in a dream. Those who attain the Dao meet each circumstance and rest in it, knowing it as illusion and not real. Why should this case alone be different?

Those who embody the Dao loosen what obstructs to open its blockages, still themselves to gather emptiness, cultivate sincerity to quicken the spirit, and settle into tranquility to return to illumination. They regard the world’s gains and losses, right and wrong, honor and disgrace, success and failure, life and death as mere dreams and illusions. Why doubt only Zhou and the butterfly?

The true person of old slept without dreaming and awoke without care. I have long pondered this and know that Zhou’s words are not mere allegory. The "Butcher" who "dissolves the ox" is one who embodies the self-emptiness of things. Treading the ten thousand transformations, he remains ever unobstructed. Those who cling to things as real respond to every path and become mired. Things are inherently without things, their substance naturally detached. The Dao is nowhere unpervading—where is there need for "dissolving," and what is this "dissolving of the ox"?

To wield the knife for nineteen years—through the cycles of yin and yang—is no short span. To dissolve thousands of oxen—responding to the world’s changes—is no small number. One might suspect the blade worn out, yet its edge is as if newly sharpened. This is because clinging to traces, each moment is already past; grasping the root, it endures unchanged through the ages. The wondrously still substance moves yet does not waver; the luminously empty function enters the dust yet is not defiled.

Consider: the body is already illusion—what knife could perform the carving? The ten thousand things are all delusion—what ox could be dissolved? With the knife, there is that by which it endures; with the ox, there is that by which things are established. Self and other merge, ability and object dissolve. Roaming freely in the ancestor of the ten thousand things, its emptiness is unobstructed.

Thus, it never strikes yet the great gaps naturally part; never guides yet the great cavities naturally release; never contends yet those of like kind naturally cohere; never acts yet the sinews and joints naturally align—how much more the great void! With this, the knife resounds *huo* yet bears no labor of response; its movement is subtle, without the mind that competes with things. Releasing the knife, it faces the ox without the burden of lingering; raising the knife, it stands without the pursuit of fleeing things. When its use is complete, it will again care for the blade and return it to non-use. This is why the knife has never been harmed.

Though the utmost Dao is nowhere present, in its wondrous function it responds without responding. In the hand, it responds to touch yet does not know the hand is there; on the shoulder, it responds to leaning yet does not know the shoulder is there; in the foot, it responds to stepping yet does not know the foot is there; at the knee, it responds to propping yet does not know the knee is there. The heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, and none knows it. The great function makes no choices, yet all is as it should be. This is why the knife’s capacity is vast, with room to spare.

Once the mind perceives the ox, there is the burden of dissolving it, and the principle of preserving life is already harmed. This is why the skilled butcher replaces his knife yearly due to cutting, and the mediocre butcher replaces his monthly due to breaking. This knife—neither ancient nor modern, time cannot grasp it; neither long nor short, number cannot confine it; neither new nor old, transformation cannot alter it; neither thick nor thin, substance cannot fix it. Its inherent hardness is not forged yet remains firm; its profound function is not tempered yet remains bright. Butcher Ding uses it as if casting earth to the ground, while the mediocre butcher sees only difficulty.

From the Dao’s obscurity, in dissolution there is no dissolution; without obstruction, dissolution is also unknown. In obstruction there is no obstruction; without dissolution, obstruction also does not arise. From Butcher Ding’s perspective, the mediocre butcher dissolves his obstructions. From the mediocre butcher’s perspective, Butcher Ding is obstructed by his dissolution. When both dissolution and obstruction are cast aside, emptiness alone remains.

Zhuang Zhou’s intent in lodging the butcher’s parable is to place the cultivation of life after the "equalizing of things" and "free and easy wandering." Why? Those who are confined by the burdens of form cannot wander freely; those who are bound by distinctions of great and small cannot equalize things. Thus, they toil amidst the dust, their blades dulled in the mire of entanglement, and their lives are seldom unharmed. Only those inwardly without self can wander freely in the realm of self-attainment; only those outwardly without things can equalize things in the domain of ultimate unity. Thus embodying the Dao, they roam among the ten thousand things—where could they be obstructed?

Therefore, Zhuang Zhou begins with the analogy of dissolving the ox, and Lord Wenhui thereby attains the cultivation of life.

Viewed from the nothingness of things, the true and constant is profoundly still, enduring unchanged through the ages. Viewed from the existence of things, the great transformation shifts in the blink of an arm’s turn. Those who grasp this see even the flowing realm as the unchanging source. Thus, floating dust may merge with the great void, and autumn hairs may bind heaven and earth. Entrusting the ten thousand transformations to the unchanging—how could one carry it away and flee? Where would one go?

Those who fail to grasp this regard their finite lives as lodged in a place of certain escape. Yet the lamp’s flame is not the same from moment to moment; the body’s form is not the same from past to present. Even if one clings to it and tries to retain it, it departs in obscurity. This is why Zhuang Zhou spoke of hiding the boat in the ravine and the mountain in the marsh—the ravine and marsh, with their empty and luminous function, serve to illustrate the Creator’s lack of intent; the boat and mountain, with their movement and stillness, serve to illustrate the existence of form. The Dao is one—this oneness is inherently without direction. The ravine and marsh, however, are directional.

The One is inherently without form; the boat and mountain possess form. The One follows movement and stillness, wandering within the directional; when the One is deluded by emptiness and luminosity and confined by form, then the One becomes paired from this point onward. There is flourishing and decay as its pair, new and old as its pair, life and death as its pair. The One, being without duality, moves alone and comes alone, without past or present. In pairing, there is coupling, thus things take shape and vie against one another, arising and perishing in succession. Therefore, to conceal fire within fire is the One; to conceal it in water extinguishes it. To conceal water within water is the One; to conceal it in earth buries it. How much more so with the boat and mountain, which already possess form, and the ravine and marsh, which already possess direction—if one grasps and conceals them, there is already intent. Yet the Creator, who has never begun to have things, can carry them away in the dead of night.

Nevertheless, only that which is not a thing can give rise to things; only that which does not transform can transform all transformations. Swift as a gallop, fleeting as a breath, the days pass in an instant without pause—transformation is thus impermanent. I have realized this: it is precisely because the Creator deludes the myriad movements into having intent that they falsely perceive existence and annihilation. When this intent exists, things exist; when this intent perishes, things perish. When one conceals them in ravine and marsh, the intent sees them as secure—unaware that not even the slightest trace has ever stood firm, and in an instant, they are lost. At midnight, the intent sees them as gone—unaware that not even the slightest trace has ever moved. Only by knowing the great constancy that sustains them can one wander where things cannot escape, and all that things cannot escape abides. This is where the myriad things are bound, where the single transformation awaits.

The ancients concealed the world within the world by this means. The world is the unity of the myriad things, and humanity is but one of those myriad things. If one truly attains the wholeness of the One, then one knows that the transformations of the ten thousand things have never had an end. In movement, there is nothing that is not the self—thus, whether heaven ages or time begins and ends, all is desired without aversion. Compared to those who, upon assuming human form, rejoice in it, how can their joy be measured? The ancients spoke of this: "All things are complete within me; turn inward and be sincere—no joy is greater." This joy, though the deluded use it all day, remains unknown to them. You dwell in it, you array it, you wander with things in the inn of creation—how could you attain Zhuang Zhou’s concealing of the world within the world and discuss it? *Sitting in forgetfulness*—the mind is not yours; who else possesses it?

These are but provisional names arising from the accumulation of conditioned habits. The body is not yours—who else possesses it? It is but an illusory arising from the harmonious union of a hundred bones. Know that the mind is no-mind and the ten thousand things are all my mind—what need is there to discard wisdom and clarity? Know that the body is no-body and the myriad forms are all my body—what need is there to cast off limbs and faculties? How much less, then, for benevolence and righteousness? How much less for rites and music? If this is so, then in movement and stillness, speech and silence, there is nothing that is not the wondrous locus. In freedom and constraint, reversal and compliance, there is nothing that is not celestial wandering. Who would recognize this as forgetting?

Otherwise, if one flees disturbance to seek quiescence, fears having to delight in nothingness—this is called forgetting—then even clods of earth and heaps of dust could be said to have forgotten. Yan Hui approached the sage yet did not fully attain it; he surpassed the multitude yet retained something. Following the spontaneous emptiness of the One transformation, he understood: the one who is without thing-ness is the sage; the one who is bound to phenomena and swept away with them is the common person. Understanding no-thing-ness, there is nowhere one does not forget; bound to thing-ness, there is no time one can forget. This is why Yan Hui practiced *sitting in forgetfulness*.

Reversing the flow of the ten thousand things’ turning realm, he dimly merged with the unchanging source of the One nature. In tranquil contemplation of the world, benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music were all seen as empty names. In the silent illumination of the numinous source, limbs, faculties, wisdom, and clarity were all recognized as illusory perceptions. Forgetting things, there are no things—empty names naturally fall away. Forgetting the self, there is no self—illusory perceptions naturally cease. Yet benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music do not name themselves; the deluded cling to them as names. Limbs and faculties, wisdom and clarity do not perceive themselves; the deluded take them as perceptions.

Know that the body arises from non-being—then limbs and faculties will naturally fall away. Yet one who insists on casting them off has not departed from the view of the body. Know that the mind arises from non-arising—then wisdom and clarity will naturally be discarded. Yet one who insists on discarding them has not departed from the view of the mind. Moreover, if even limbs and faculties are not, how can benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music exist? In the past, one cultivated virtue in the liver and diaphragm, and every thing knew; now, there is no knowing. In the past, one employed the mind between the brows and lashes, and every thing was seen; now, there is no seeing. Is this not *sitting in forgetfulness*?

Yet once it is called forgetting, Confucius could not tolerate questions, and Yan Hui could not tolerate responses. How could one know the slightest gain? How could one know the slightest loss? How could one know that the forgetting of benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music is not yet complete? How could one know that the casting off of limbs, faculties, wisdom, and clarity is the ultimate attainment?

Viewed from the wondrous: the one who falls forgets the chariot; the one who drowns forgets the water; the person forgets the Dao and its arts; the fish forgets the rivers and lakes—this, too, is forgetting. Viewed from the coarse: the one who gains forgets form; the one who profits forgets truth; the one who waves an arm forgets the chariot ruts; the one who seizes gold forgets the marketplace—this, too, is forgetting. Shall we say that one is right and the other wrong? The Dao has no right or wrong. Shall we say that one is real and the other false? The Dao has no real or false.

Yan Hui turned his back on the dust and returned to the wondrous, diminished the substantial and gathered the empty—this is what I know of his forgetting, yet it was not yet forgetting. If he had advanced further on this Way, not forgetting would also be forgetting. This is why Confucius, at sixty, transformed sixty times—what value, then, is there in forgetting? Master Huzhi.

The wondrous workings of the spirit have never revealed their marvels, nor have those who receive its marvels ever known them—this is what we call the spirit. Those shamans, however, deceive with words of spirits, proclaiming life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, long life and early demise to others. Though their verifications may seem as timely as months, days, or even hours—appearing marvelous yet not truly so—they are but semblances of the spirit. Having called them spirits, we then speak of Ji Xian, for he embodies the marvel of things that respond to stimuli.

Moreover, Ji Xian possesses responsiveness, and with responsiveness comes a heart. When one uses one’s own heart to sense another’s heart, one’s own perceptions to see another’s perceptions, then the false names of life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune arise. Once names are false, perceptions become false as well; once perceptions are false, words become false. Those in the world who cling to appearances and cannot dispel delusion further accept these falsehoods as truth, fleeing in haste. Even Liezi, upon witnessing this, became intoxicated in heart, for he had not yet hollowed out his heart. He had not yet severed learning. Thus, others could still read your fortune, Master Hu.

The essence of the Hu-vessel lies in emptiness and imperishability; its function, in profound clarity and unfathomable depth. You, however, possess the Way of emerging from the mother to engage the world, thus able to lodge the formless within the realm of forms. Ji Xian, by contrast, responds with a heart, so each time he enters, he claims to see. But when one responds without a heart, as you do, each time he arrives, he can only say you have shown him something. Without a heart, you tread beyond form; how could he read your fortune? Transcending numbers, you stand before the unnumbered; how could he know you?

Ji Xian remains shackled to form and number, never free from perception. Where perception dwells, he takes life and death as fixed, inescapable truths. Thus, at first, you showed him the pattern of earth, and he sighed at your death. Next, you showed him the expanse of heaven and earth, and he rejoiced at your life. Unaware that death originally had no death—only the extinction of the heart—nor that life originally had no life—only the arising of the heart—he saw the arising and extinction of the heart as the presence and absence of form.

The perfected one has never possessed a heart. At rest, they share virtue with yin; in motion, they flow with yang. Sharing virtue with yin, they cannot be seen. Thus, you had to show him the pattern of earth, for patterns are where things intermingle. Flowing with yang, they cannot be seen. Thus, you had to show him the expanse of heaven and earth, for earth is where things arise. When you showed him the Great Thoroughfare, he deemed it unequal—for in the pattern of earth, yin prevails over yang; in the expanse of heaven and earth, yang prevails over yin; but in the Great Thoroughfare, neither yin nor yang prevails, and heaven and earth stand in perfect balance. The myriad dharmas are one, originally without high or low. Seeing inequality, he failed to grasp this.

Yet all three are called "mechanisms," for they reveal the subtlest stirrings before they manifest. Thus, he could perceive them. When you showed him "never yet having departed from our origin," you showed him departure from all that could be shown. He cast reality upon you, but you responded with emptiness; he approached with being, but you received him with non-being. His arising heart and labored perceptions were finite, while your detachment from others and concealment of heaven were infinite. When the finite confronts the infinite, it is undone—this is why Ji Xian fled at the sight of you, vanishing upon pursuit.

Though Master Hu told Liezi, "This is seeing my mechanism of blocking virtue," and "This is nearly seeing my mechanism of goodness," and "This is seeing my mechanism of balancing qi"—all referring to "me"—when I empty myself and follow along, neither knowing who acts nor who is acted upon, even I lose myself. Who, then, is showing? Who is being read? Thus, he fled.

Master Hu’s heart is the Great Void. The essence of the Great Void is empty clarity, wondrous stillness, embracing and upholding the ten thousand things. Adorn it with splendor, and it does not linger; strike it with blades, and it is unharmed; drench it with water, and it is not soaked; scorch it with fire, and it is not burned. This is its nature.

Master Hu’s heart: confronted with death, he receives it without aversion; greeted with life, he receives it without delight. Named as unequal, he receives it without contention. In the end, Ji Xian lost himself and vanished—yet this was not because he had attained anything, but simply because of this emptiness.

Zhuang Zhou discusses the response of emperors and kings in this way: the emperor-king responds to the world by abiding in stillness, unmoving, thus able to resonate and fully communicate. Retreating to concealment, they share weal and woe with the people. But if one emerges from this origin, fretting over the world as one’s own burden, enslaved by the ten thousand things rather than mastering them, can others then read your fortune? This is why the emperors and kings of old were vast and boundless, beyond all naming.

The Dark Pearl lies north of the Red Water’s source, containing yang yet not flowing. The Kunlun peaks stand serene, unyielding—thus mirroring the self-originating nature of one’s inherent essence. Gazing southward, one encounters things and stirs; returning inward, one traverses movement yet circles back—thus mirroring the nature that reverts to its origin. Once the celestial nature unfolds, dusty realms arise in tandem, and human artifice drifts ever farther from the great Dao. Is not the Dark Pearl its remnant?

Yet nature cannot be known through human effort—who then can impose knowledge upon it? Nature cannot be grasped through intentional seeking—who then can claim to find it? To impose knowledge is not to gather emptiness; to seek it is not to silently align. Do these three masters exhaust their wisdom in what they wish to know? Do their eyes fail in what they wish to see, their mouths weary in what they wish to speak? Why is it that the Dao, though subtle, abides equally in drifting dust and clods of earth, while the utterly real dwells near, undivided from the space between one’s brows, never distant from the primal image? It flows forth from the realm of the square inch, sprawling across the expanse of daily use. Yet to pursue it is like facing a dark mountain—ever more distant; to inquire of it is like questioning the vast earth—utterly lost. This is because seeking yields no attainment.

Moreover, nature is originally without knowledge, yet what is called "knowledge" is not true knowledge. Nature is originally without sight, yet what is called "seeing" is not true seeing. Nature is originally without speech, yet what is called "speech" is not true speech. To take knowledge as nature and seek knowledge through knowledge is to become deluded by knowledge. To take sight as nature and seek sight through sight is to become obstructed by sight. To take speech as nature and seek speech through speech is to become bound by speech. What is called "image" seems to exist yet does not; what is called "net" seems absent yet is not. To discard knowledge is to awaken from delusion; to discard sight is to attain clarity; to discard speech is to loosen bonds. Only through this "image-net" can one alone attain it.

When one delves into the root of the Dao, even a sage like the Yellow Emperor, with all his aspirations, loses it, while the foolish Xiangwang, with no intent, gains it. Yet when one obscures the great Dao, whether nature is present or absent, whether one attains or loses, whether sagely or ordinary—all is reversed. In the past, the Yellow Emperor lost it yet suffered no slightest lack; now, Xiangwang gains it yet acquires no slightest gain. Through ancient and present time alike, the true and constant alone is revealed. Profoundly deluded, profoundly awakened—all become the enlightened nature. Who is to say that the three masters’ failure is not true attainment, or that Xiangwang’s success is not the right way? Thus, even the Yellow Emperor stands apart—yet at the Hao-Liang, he too...

The myriad things share commonality—do they share in the One? The One shares commonality—does it share in the Dao? The Dao’s attainment comes from nowhere. That which is born arises of itself, yet birth itself is unborn; that which takes form shapes itself, yet form itself is formless. All that spreads forth amid appearances, images, sounds, and colors—none lacks this Dao. What then should I choose among things?

The allotment of the One Nature is complete, with nothing left over; the wandering of the One Heaven is unbound, with no encumbrance. Both things and I possess it. Only those who harmonize with the knowledge of things and self may, without intending to know, know its wonder; without seeking union, unite with its principle; without striving to meet, merge with its spirit—first receiving what cannot be escaped, roaming where none precede. This is how Zhuangzi knew the fish’s joy above the Hao-Liang.

Now, to emerge and glide, to swim without the dryness of foam, without the peril of nets—leisurely in the midst of the One Water—is this what constitutes the fish’s joy? Taking this as joy, *Qi Xie* already knew it. Why wait for Zhou to know? For the fish’s joy lies in the Dao, not in the water; Zhou’s knowledge lies in joy, not in the fish. Only when the fish forgets the water is its joy whole; only when Zhou forgets the fish does his knowledge become absolute.

Supreme joy is without joy; true knowledge is without knowledge. Zhou did not intend to know, yet knew. Thus Zhuang Zhou harmonized with it beyond all things—perhaps without words. Huizi once shared with him a bond of perfect accord—perhaps without questions. Zhuangzi was not incapable of silence; Huizi was not incapable of awakening. Yet if there were no question, Zhou’s words would have no ground; if there were no words, the Dao’s wonder would have no manifestation. The aim was simply to dispel the later world’s delusion of separating self and things into two.

If things inherently possess their own thingness, then Zhou is certainly not the fish—how could he know that I know the fish’s joy? Or if I inherently possess my own selfhood, then the fish is certainly not Zhou—how could I know that I do not know the fish’s joy? Knowing and not knowing are both branches of the Dao. This is why Zhou asked to return to the root.

The root has never been unknown. Yan He once spoke of it: the eye is like the ear, the ear...

The nose is like the mouth, the mouth like the nose—none differ. What is within me is thus: seeing death as life, wealth as poverty, Zhou as the fish, others as swine, myself as others. What is within things is thus: thus, every thing arrives, roaming without place that is not wondrous—why only above the Hao River? Thus, every thing is truly joyful, without harmony that is not heavenly—why only the joy of the minnows? I know that Zhou and the fish were never divided. Yet in composing the "Autumn Floods," he began with the River Lord and North Sea If vaunting their smallness and greatness, then with the creatures Kui and Feng pitying their presence and absence—how could he know that things are one and joy is complete? Thus, Zhou entrusted the joy of the minnows to convey his intent, and the discourse on utmost joy arose therefrom.

The ancients, enlightened to utmost joy’s absence, often expressed it in their words: "What joy? What aversion?" One who falls from a cart, clinging to things as if seeing something, truly sees the cart; taking the self as real and known, truly falls. With knowledge and perception established, cart and fall divide—how could there be no harm? Yet the drunken man’s wholeness in wine dissolves knowledge and obscures perception; he knows not the cart’s fall, knows not the earth, knows not his body’s touch, knows not touch’s wound—serene, without division.

Even one who temporarily entrusts wholeness to wine can transcend life and death, forgetting fear—how much more one whose nature’s wholeness has never departed? The world is but a cart; those who ride it, inwardly vexed by knowledge and perception, outwardly pursued by illusory disturbances, will soon overturn in the realm of delusions—not merely suffering bodily harm or the intrusion of fear. Once the receptacle opens, myriad forms enter, like the sober witnessing a cart’s overturn—how could there be no harm?

Yet at the inception of form, heaven and earth were born with me; at the origin of numbers, the myriad things were one with me. What thing is the cart? What thing is the person? What thing is the fall? What thing is the wound? When mind and things oppose, heaven is sundered and the human arises; when mind and things merge, the human departs and heaven’s mechanism remains. Machinery gone, what follows is heaven’s principle; fittingly fused, what is embodied is heaven’s harmony. Moving without trace is called "heavenly roaming"; acting without bounds is called "heavenly mechanism." Nothing is sufficient to trouble it—this is "heavenly joy"; nothing is sufficient to beautify it—this is "heavenly harmony." Therewith, serving heaven requires no toil; therewith, assisting heaven requires no aid. This is called "wholeness in heaven."

Those who view gain and loss, sorrow and joy, life and death, poverty and success as the drunken man’s cart-fall—when Zhou expounded this in the "Attaining Life" chapter, he meant that the living must perish, and the perishing must live. Knowing that life is fundamentally non-life, he said: "Inwardly observe without mind, outwardly observe without body, broadly observe without things"—only then can one unify one’s nature without duality, nourish one’s qi without dissipation, harmonize one’s virtue without departure, and penetrate what things create without being ensnared. Where could one go that is not heaven?

Form whole in heaven, and forms have never existed; sound whole in heaven, and sounds have never arisen; sight whole in heaven, and colors have never appeared; taste whole in heaven, and flavors have never presented themselves—this is called "wholeness in heaven." This chapter first entrusted this to the drunken man’s cart-fall, then followed with the avenger who does not break the sword Moye, and then with the resentful man who does not blame the flying tile—why? Things are inherently non-things—what mind for existence? The self is inherently non-self—what mind for things? Things and self were never divided. Thus, the fallen are not harmed, the avenger does not break, the resentful does not blame—all is heaven’s natural emptiness.

Yet because it opposes the human, it is called "heaven"; because one’s nature is non-nature, how could there be heaven? Because it opposes division, it is called "concealment"; because heaven is non-heaven, how could there be concealment? Realizing this, one accords with the wondrous purport of "Attaining Life."

The *Daoshu* says: Those who speak of the Dao ask, "Where is the Dao?" If one says it is nowhere, does one expect it to be in being? The ancients have spoken of it: in antiquity, it is not antiquity; in the present, it is not the present; in yin, it is not yin; in yang, it is not yang; in the distant, it does not leave the eyebrows; in the near, it alone transcends images. In gathering, it flows forth into the myriad existents; in scattering, it withdraws into a single hair. Is the Dao truly in being?

If one expects it to be in non-being, the ancients have spoken of it: in heaven, it is heaven; on earth, it is earth; filling valleys, it fills valleys; filling pits, it fills pits; existing in ants, existing in tiles and pebbles—is the Dao truly in non-being? Non-being is not absent; it is called "non-being," yet true non-being is not non-existent. Being is not present; it is called "being," yet true being is not existent. That which is present in all is beyond the names of being and non-being.

The ancients, enlightened to the wondrous presence of this "all-present" in the world, dared not liken it to forms or numbers, dared not glance at it through boundaries or domains. They forcibly named that which spans antiquity and the present, self-completing in dispersal and unity, as "the ancients’ great body"—like myriad waters reflecting the moon’s embrace, myriad apertures roaring with a single wind’s impulse, myriad images arrayed by a single qi’s accumulation, myriad things entangled at a single Dao’s source.

Spiritual beings attain it and descend as emperors; kings attain it and give birth to success; heaven and humans attain it without departing from the origin; divine humans attain it without departing from essence; perfected humans attain it without departing from truth. The sage transforms thereby; the noble person practices kindness and benevolence thereby; it is the model for names and calculations, the pattern for the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music. The ancients approached it as the *Dao* and *shu*—not burdening the mind, thus it cannot be called "mind-shu"; not chiseling with wisdom, thus it cannot be called "wisdom-shu"; not a mechanism, thus it cannot be called "mechanism-shu"; not a technique, thus it cannot be called "technique-shu." This *shu* is called the Dao—its comprehensiveness is all-pervading.

Alas! The great whole shattered into the fragments of "morality," and the hundred schools of thought, following their partial visions, became mired, believing the *Dao* and *shu* resided therein. Unmoved by life, unmoved by death, Mo Di and Qin Guli heard its wind and delighted in it, becoming people who did too much for others and too little for themselves. Song Jian and Yin Wen heard its wind and delighted in it, mocking the exalted and unrestrained, lacking conduct yet condemning the great sages. Peng Heng and Shen Dao heard its wind and delighted in it, taking humility as their exterior and emptiness as their core. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard its wind and delighted in it. These several masters either became mired in the Dao through solitary burdens they could not bear, or through ceaseless clamor, or through theories of life and death, or through vast domains. Calculating their *shu* within the Dao, it is like a speck in a great marsh.

As a grain of millet in the Grand Granary, as a pebble beside Mount Tai, as a hair’s tip upon a horse’s body—from what each has seen, they differ, yet from the Dao they have attained, one cannot tell their difference. Why is this? A single stone’s insignificance and Mount Tai alike complete the form; a single grain’s fineness and the Grand Granary alike fulfill the count; a speck of dust and the great marsh share in emptiness; a single hair and the horse’s body alike are fully equipped. Though the Hundred Schools rend the Dao in myriad directions, in great substance they have never departed from it.

Alas! Without the Hundred Schools, there is no Great Completeness; without the Great Completeness, there are no Hundred Schools. Without the Hundred Schools, the Great Completeness cannot be seen; without the Great Completeness, the Hundred Schools cannot stand—their origin is one. Those who all day possess the Great Completeness yet do not know it are the common people; those who aspire to the Great Completeness yet have not reached it are the worthy; those who have exhausted the Great Completeness and effaced its traces are the sages.

This is what Yao and Shun passed on to each other; what Yu and Tang received and transmitted; what the Duke of Zhou gazed up and pondered; what Confucius immersed his heart and immersed in; what Mencius cultivated and nourished; what Yi Yin first awakened and awakened to. Zhuang Zhou’s book concludes with this chapter, profoundly embracing the root of the great Dao, vigorously sweeping away the Hundred Schools’ flaws—yet in the end, with absurd and boundless words, he ranks himself among those several masters, deeply exposing the traces of his writing to enlighten later ages and the world to come. Who would say Zhou was obscured by Heaven and became a one-sided scholar?
