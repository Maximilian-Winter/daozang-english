Category: Daoist Works
Descriptive Summary

[We, your] ministers respectfully observe: The *Explications of the Daodejing* in two fascicles was composed by Su Zhe of the Song. Master Su’s learning originally moved between the two teachings [of Daoism and Buddhism], and thus his mastery of both was particularly profound, while his elucidations of them also sufficed to fully expound his own doctrines. This work fundamentally asserts that Buddhism and Daoism share a common source, and moreover, it draws upon the *Doctrine of the Mean* to draw parallels. Su Shi, in his postscript, remarked that had this book existed in the early Han, Confucianism and Daoism would have been unified; had it existed in the Jin and Song dynasties, Buddhism and Daoism would have been nondual. Master Zhu [Xi], however, criticized it for blending Confucianism with Mohism in his *Distinctions of Miscellaneous Learning* as a caution. Yet the texts of the two teachings often covertly appropriate Confucian principles while altering their interpretations. Those who expound the classics and clarify the Way as Confucians must not fail to distinguish the finest distinctions, dissecting points of doubt and resemblance to prevent scholars from straying onto divergent paths. If one engages in the learning of the two teachings and annotates their scriptures, one speaks for the two teachings, not for Confucianism.

The book itself does not escape the tendency to blend Confucianism with Mohism; how could its annotators not each uphold what they have heard? Thus, from the Confucian perspective, Zhe’s work straddles two paths, while from the Daoist perspective, it still elucidates a single principle. Now that the *Laozi* is preserved to represent one school of thought, Zhe’s work should not be entirely discarded either.

By Su Zhe of the Song Dynasty

**Daoist Scripture**

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao. All things are of the Dao, yet what can be spoken of the Dao cannot be constant. Only that which cannot be spoken of the Dao may endure. Consider now benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—these are the Dao that can be spoken. Yet benevolence cannot become righteousness, nor can propriety become wisdom. That which can be spoken of the Dao cannot be constant. Only the unspoken may abide in benevolence as benevolence, in righteousness as righteousness, and so too with propriety and wisdom. These are all inconstant, while the Dao remains unchanging. Thus does the unspeakable endure.

**Chapter Two: "The Name That Can Be Named"**
If the Dao cannot be spoken, how much less can it be named? All names belong to that which can be spoken. Once a name is established, the distinctions of round and square, crooked and straight, cannot endure. "Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things." Thus, constantly desireless, one observes its mystery; constantly desiring, one observes its manifestations. From the nameless, form arises to become Heaven and Earth. Once Heaven and Earth are established, names begin. From the named, the myriad things proliferate. Once the myriad things flourish, names cannot be exhaustively recorded. Therefore, the nameless is the essence of the Dao, and the named is its function. The sage embodies the Dao to serve the world, entering into the realm of multiplicity while abiding in the constant void, thereby observing its mystery. Embodying the utmost emptiness while abiding in the constant presence, one observes its manifestations. Yet if one acts upon manifestations without knowing the mystery, one is coarse and lacks spirit. If one lingers in the mystery without knowing its manifestations, one is refined but unchanging.

These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names; together they are called the Profound. In terms of form, there are indeed the two—being and non-being. How can one know that non-being transforms into being, and being reverts to non-being, without ever ceasing to be one? Though their names differ, their root is the same. To know the unity of the root is to be profound. All things distant and boundless in their extremity are inevitably profound in appearance. Thus does Laozi often employ "profound" to signify the ultimate. Profound beyond the profound is the gateway to all mysteries. To speak of the profound is to reach the limit, yet the mind still clings to profundity. Profound beyond the profound is the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. It is the source from which all mysteries emerge.

**Chapter Two: "When All the World Knows"**
When all the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises. Thus, being and non-being give rise to one another; difficulty and ease complete one another; long and short shape one another; high and low incline toward one another; sound and voice harmonize with one another; before and after follow one another. The world speaks of beauty and ugliness in terms of form and name. What it calls beautiful and good—are these truly beautiful and good? It does not know that being and non-being, difficulty and ease, high and low, sound and voice, before and after, give rise to and supplant one another, none of which is constant. One may consider oneself long, yet upon encountering one longer, one becomes short. One may consider oneself ahead, yet upon being preceded by another, one falls behind. If one follows what is deemed beautiful and trusts in it, one strays far indeed.

Thus the sage engages in non-action and practices the teaching without words. When acting, the mind abides in non-action; when teaching, the intent lies in wordlessness. Thus one transcends the measures of long and short, departs from the calculations of before and after, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither good nor un-good. How then can the world comprehend it? The myriad things arise, yet one does not refuse them; they are born, yet one does not possess them; one acts, yet does not rely on them; accomplishments are achieved, yet one does not dwell in them. The myriad things act for me, yet I do not refuse them. I act for their sake, yet do not possess them, do not rely on them. When success is achieved, I do not dwell in it. This is the reward of non-action and wordlessness. The sage does not even know what is beautiful and good—how then could ugliness and un-goodness follow?

Only by not dwelling does one not depart. The sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without the sorrow of poverty and lowliness; dwells in wealth and nobility without the burdens of wealth and nobility. This is what is meant by "not dwelling." If I do not dwell, how can it depart? This is the utmost of dwelling.

**Chapter Three: "Not Exalting the Worthy"**
Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending. Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing. Not displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from being disordered. Thus the sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones. Exalting the worthy causes the people to feel shame in their inferiority and leads to contention. Prizing rare goods causes the people to suffer from lack and leads to theft. Displaying what is desirable causes the people to worry over not obtaining it and leads to disorder. Though the world knows these three as sources of trouble and wishes to abolish them, it is deluded.

The sage acts otherwise. He does not fail to employ the worthy—he simply does not exalt them. He does not discard rare goods—he simply does not prize them. He does not eliminate desire—he simply does not display it.

Thus, when the worthy are employed yet the people do not contend, when rare goods and desirable things are all displayed yet theft, calamity, and disorder do not arise—is this not to empty the heart without harming the fullness of the belly, to weaken the will without harming the strength of the bones?

Now, if one were to exalt the worthy and prize rare goods, displaying what is desirable, then both heart and belly would be filled. If one were to abolish and discard them, then both will and bones would be weakened. When heart and belly are both filled, the people contend; when will and bones are both weak, they have nothing with which to stand.

Constantly cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act. Do not display these three, and the people will have nothing to admire—calm and without desire, even the wise will have no use for their cunning. Act through non-action, and nothing will be left ungoverned. Follow the natural course of these three without exalting, prizing, or displaying—this is what is called "acting through non-action."

**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profound Emptiness**
The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Profound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
It blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles,
harmonizes their light, and merges with their dust.
Deep and still, it seems ever-present.
I do not know whose child it is—
it resembles the ancestor of the gods.

Though the Dao is ever-present, it ultimately cannot be named, yet it cannot be said to be nonexistent. Thus it is said: "This must precede even the gods." If it precedes the gods and is yet prior to them, then nothing precedes it.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**
Heaven and earth are not benevolent—
they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
The sage is not benevolent—
he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
Heaven and earth are impartial, allowing the myriad things to follow their nature.
Thus, things live and die of themselves—
death is not their cruelty, nor life their benevolence.
It is like binding straw to make dogs for sacrifice,
adorning them for the rites—
was this done out of love?
After the rites, they are discarded,
trampled by passersby—
was this done out of hatred?
It is simply as it is.
The sage’s relation to the people is the same:
if he does nothing to harm them, the people preserve their nature.
Though death and life proceed without his intervention,
his non-benevolence is itself great benevolence.

The space between heaven and earth—
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it yields.
To push it is to have bellows and pipes—
with a single motion, the qi reaches everywhere.
The ignorant think it the height of ingenuity,
yet what does the bellows itself do?
It is simply empty and inexhaustible,
thus the more it moves, the more it yields.
The beginning of the transformation of the myriad things,
the carving of all forms between heaven and earth—
is it not like this?

Much speech leads to exhaustion—
better to guard the center.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**
The valley spirit does not die—
this is called the mysterious female.
The valley is utterly empty yet has form;
the valley spirit is empty and without form.
Empty and without form, it has no life—
how could it have death?
It is called the valley spirit to speak of its power,
the mysterious female to speak of its function.
The female gives birth to the myriad things—
it is called "mysterious" because one sees it give birth
but does not see how it gives birth.

The gate of the mysterious female—
this is called the root of heaven and earth.
The gate of the mysterious female:
the myriad things emerge from it.
The root of heaven and earth:
heaven and earth arise from it.
Continuous, as if existing,
its use is never exhausted.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Are Everlasting**
Heaven is everlasting, earth enduring.
Heaven and earth, though vast, have not escaped form and number—
their longevity is thus limited.
Yet Laozi speaks of them as everlasting,
for he refers only to what humans perceive.
As for true everlastingness—
it is what is called "the beginning of heaven and earth."

Heaven and earth endure because they do not live for themselves—
thus they achieve long life.
Therefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,
sets himself aside and finds himself preserved.
Is it not because he is selfless
that he achieves his own ends?

Heaven and earth give life to things yet do not claim life for themselves,
standing beyond the myriad things—thus they endure.
The sage places himself after others yet is foremost,
sets himself apart yet benefits others,
standing beyond the crowd—thus he is first and preserved.
If heaven and earth competed with things for life,
if the sage contended with people for gain,
then heaven and earth would be but one thing among many,
the sage but one person among others—
how could they surpass them?
Though their selflessness is not a means to achieve private ends,
private ends are thereby achieved—
this is the natural course of the Dao.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Good Is Like Water**
The highest good is like water.
Water benefits the myriad things without contending,
dwelling in places the multitudes despise—
thus it is close to the Dao.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.
What continues it is good; what completes it is nature."
It also says: "Heaven uses the One to give birth to water."
The Dao moves and becomes good, just as qi moves and gives birth to water.
Thus it is said: "The highest good is like water."
Both begin from nothing and take form—
their principles are the same.
The Dao is present everywhere, benefiting all without exception—
and water is the same.
Yet once bound to form, it differs from the Dao.
Thus it is said: "close to the Dao."
Yet it can be named good—
nothing surpasses it.
Thus it is called "the highest good."

Dwelling in good earth,
the heart in good depth,
giving with good benevolence,
speaking with good sincerity,
governing with good order,
handling affairs with good ability,
acting with good timing—
avoiding the high, flowing to the low,
never opposing—this is good earth.
Empty, still, and unfathomably deep—this is good depth.
Benefiting and nourishing the myriad things,
giving without seeking repayment—this is good benevolence.
Round it turns, square it bends,
blocked it stops, unblocked it flows—this is good sincerity.
Washing away all filth, leveling high and low—this is good order.
Meeting things and giving them form without clinging to one—this is good ability.
Freezing in winter, melting in spring,
drying and flooding without losing measure—this is good timing.

The non-contending thus knows no blame.
To have virtue yet not escape human censure is due to contention.
Water, by not contending, embodies the seven virtues without blame.

**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**

Holding and filling—better to cease.
Honing to a point—cannot long endure.
Knowing that fullness must overflow yet insisting on holding fast—
not as secure as remaining unfilled.
Knowing that sharpness must break yet striving to hone it first—
one cannot rely on such honing.
Thus the sage possesses yet does not possess—
how then could there be fullness?
Following principle before acting—
how then could there be sharpness?
Without fullness, there is no need to hold.
Without sharpness, there is no need to hone.

Gold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them.
Wealth and nobility breed arrogance—self-invited calamity.
Success achieved, fame attained—withdraw the self.
This is the Dao of Heaven.
The sun at its zenith must decline,
the moon at its full must wane,
the turning of the four seasons—
those who achieve must depart.
Heaven and Earth still abide—
how much more so for man?

**Chapter Ten: Carrying Spirit and Soul**

Carrying spirit and soul, embracing the One—
can they not be separated?
What distinguishes *po* from *hun*?
*Po* belongs to the physical, *hun* to the spiritual.
The *Yi* says: "Essence and qi form things; wandering *hun* brings change."
Thus we know the nature of spirit and soul:
*Po* is physical, thus mixed and at rest;
*hun* is spiritual, thus unified and transforming.
This is called "carrying spirit and soul"—speaking of their rest.

The Dao pervades all things;
in man, it is called *xing* (nature),
and the marvel of *xing* is spirit.
Speaking of its purity before admixture—it is called "the One."
Speaking of its gathering before dispersal—it is called "the uncarved block."
All return to the Dao, each named according to its reality.

The sage’s nature is settled, spirit congealed—
unmoved by external things.
Though *po* serves as its dwelling,
wherever spirit desires to go, *po* follows without fail—
thus spirit ever carries *po*.
The common man is enslaved by things, spirit obscured and disordered—
thus spirit submits to *po*.
Eyes and ears are wearied by sounds and sights,
nose and mouth labor over scents and flavors.
Wherever *po* desires to go, spirit follows—
thus *po* ever carries spirit.

Therefore, the teaching is to embrace spirit and carry *po*,
so the two do not separate.
This is indeed the sage’s essential method of cultivating the self.
As for the ancients’ "true persons,"
with deep roots and firm stems,
long life and enduring vision—
their Dao likewise arises from this.

**Concentrating qi to attain suppleness—can one be like an infant?**
When spirit is disordered, qi scatters:
the strong become belligerent,
the weak become fearful—
unaware of themselves.
When spirit is ordered, qi does not act recklessly;
joy and anger each follow their proper measure—
this is called "concentrating qi."
The utmost emptiness of spirit,
the beginning of qi’s fullness.
Emptiness at its extreme is suppleness;
fullness at its extreme is hardness.
Pure nature without qi—
this is called "attaining suppleness."
The infant knows neither good nor evil—
thus its nature is whole.
Nature whole, qi is guarded;
qi guarded, the body is supple.
Concentrating qi to attain suppleness—
the infant is the utmost.

**Purifying the profound mirror—can one be without flaw?**
The sage, externally not carried by *po*,
internally not driven by qi—
thus purifies away all dust and grime.
Thereupon, their spirit is vast and profoundly mirrors all things,
knowing all arise from nature,
viewing purity and filth equally—
without blemish.

**Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without contrivance?**
Having cultivated the self, one extends the surplus to others.
Though governing the state and loving the people,
one meets them with a mindless heart.
If one acts with intention,
then loving the people only harms them,
governing the state only brings disorder.

**The gate of Heaven opens and closes—can one act as the female?**
The gate of Heaven is where order and chaos, rise and fall emerge.
Having taken the world upon oneself,
amidst its opening and closing, its changing encounters—
the common man values gain and fears loss,
thus rushes ahead to seek fortune.
The sage follows principle and knows Heaven’s mandate,
waiting for the call before responding.
The *Yi* says: "Preceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose;
following Heaven, one accords with the time."
This is not truly preceding or following—
rather, one’s before and after always meet Heaven’s mandate.
Otherwise, the early will be premature, the late will be delayed—
both miss the mark.
Thus, "acting as the female" means nothing more than not missing the time.

**Understanding the four directions—can one be without knowledge?**
Internally cultivating the self, externally governing the state—
facing change, there is always a Dao.
Is this not "understanding the four directions"?
"Understanding the four directions" is the mind.
Yet this mind knows nothing without ever possessing a knowing mind.
The mind is one—
if there were another that knows,
then it would be two.
From one to two—
this is the origin of delusion,
the beginning of folly.
Now, the mirror’s response to things—
once they come, it reflects them.
How could it know the one reflecting?
Originally, there is nothing—
to impose intention upon it is the source of delusion.

**Giving life and nurturing—**
giving life yet not possessing,
acting yet not relying,
growing yet not ruling—
this is called "profound virtue."
Its Dao suffices to give life and nurture the myriad things,
yet can be without possession, without reliance, without ruling.
Though possessing great virtue, things do not know it—
thus it is called "profound virtue."

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**

Thirty spokes share one hub—
where there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.
Clay is shaped into vessels—
where there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room—
where there is nothing, lies the use of the room.
Thus, having gives advantage;
nothingness gives use.

Exhausting wisdom and resources to make tools—
the use of tools always lies in nothingness.
Without having, nothingness cannot achieve its use;
without nothingness, having cannot apply its advantage.
Thus the sage constantly observes the wondrous in nothingness,
constantly observes the subtleties in having.
Knowing the two as one and indivisible—
this is the utmost.

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**

The five colors blind the eyes.
The five tones deafen the ears.
The five flavors dull the palate.
Racing and hunting madden the heart.
Rare goods impede conduct.
Thus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—
hence rejecting that and choosing this.

The sage sees colors, hears sounds, tastes flavors—
all the same as others.
As for racing and hunting, they have never not engaged in them;
as for rare goods, they have never not used them.
Yet all consider these harmful, while the sage alone deems them fortunate.
Why?
The sage is for the belly, the common man for the eyes.
The eyes covet yet cannot receive;
the belly receives yet never covets.
That which comes from without—
this is the external thing.
That which congeals within—
this is the nature’s essence.

**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**

Favor and disgrace are like alarm; value great affliction as you value the body.
The perspicacious of old were alarmed by favor as by disgrace, knowing that favor is but the precursor of disgrace.
They valued the body as they valued great affliction, knowing that the body is the root of affliction.
Thus, by relinquishing favor, disgrace could not reach them; by forgetting the body, affliction could not arise.

What is meant by "favor and disgrace are like alarm"?
Favor is inferior: gaining it is like alarm, losing it is like alarm—this is what is called "favor and disgrace are like alarm."
Yet favor and disgrace are not two things: disgrace arises from favor, though the world does not perceive this, taking favor as superior and disgrace as inferior.
If one knows that disgrace arises from favor, then favor is inherently inferior.
Thus, the perspicacious of old, upon gaining favor, were alarmed; upon losing favor, were alarmed—never complacent in favor, ever wary of disgrace.
This "like alarm" is not true alarm, but merely akin to it.

What is meant by "value great affliction as you value the body"?
The reason I have great affliction is that I have a body; if I had no body, what affliction would I have?
"Value" here means "to find difficult."
The body is the root of great affliction, yet the world’s scholars find it difficult to endure affliction but not difficult to possess a body.
Thus, the sage, recognizing their difficulty in enduring affliction, teaches them the difficulty of possessing a body.
Knowing the difficulty of possessing a body, great affliction departs.
Human nature, from birth, cannot be augmented by life nor diminished by death; its greatness can fill heaven and earth, its essence can tread water and fire, enter metal and jade—no thing can afflict it.
Yet the world constantly fears the loss of its original nature, seeing only the body as beloved.
When attachment to the body is deep, things begin to afflict it.
The changes of life and death, sickness and infirmity, attack from within; the encounters of favor and disgrace, gain and loss, assail from without—there is not a single thing that is not affliction.
Only the perspicacious, knowing that nature is indestructible while the body is insubstantial, suddenly forget the body, and all afflictions of the world vanish.
Only then can one traverse the world without encumbrance.

Thus, one who values the body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes the body for the sake of the world may be relied upon with the world.
People pursue power and profit, drown in wealth and nobility, brave hardship without regret—all to enrich their bodies.
Now, if one is endowed with the world yet takes the body as weighty, their forgetting of the body is complete.
Entrusting the world to such a one, even the vastness of the world cannot afflict them.

---

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**

Look at it and it cannot be seen—this is called *yi*.
Listen to it and it cannot be heard—this is called *xi*.
Grasp it and it cannot be held—this is called *wei*.
These three cannot be exhaustively questioned, thus they merge into one.

What can be seen is form; what enables seeing form cannot itself be seen.
What can be heard is sound; what enables hearing sound cannot itself be heard.
What can be grasped is touch; what enables grasping touch cannot itself be grasped.
Though the wise cannot question these three, they must ultimately merge and return to the one.
This "one" is nature; the three are the functions of nature.
Humans begin with nature alone, but upon engaging with things, it splits and scatters into seeing, hearing, and touching, used daily yet unrecognized.
Not returning to the root, no longer merging into one, they grow ever more distant.
If one extends this principle, it is what the Buddhists call the six senses—all are thus.
The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "Reversing the flow, wholly one, the six functions cease"—this is the meaning.

Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark.
Things with form all cling to yin and yang, thus above is bright and below is dark—inescapable.
Yet the Dao, though above, is not bright; though below, is not dark—difficult to infer through form or measure.

Endlessly it flows, nameless—returning to nothingness.
Endlessly it moves without cease. People see its ceaseless movement and assume it is something, unaware that it ultimately returns to nothing. This is called "the form of the formless, the image of the imageless"—what is termed *huhuang*. When it manifests, it takes form; when it guards, it takes image. The form of the formless, the image of the imageless—these are not nothing, yet being and nothingness cannot be named, hence it is called *huhuang*.

Meet it and you do not see its beginning; follow it and you do not see its end.
The Dao is everywhere, thus no before or after can be seen.

Hold to the ancient Dao to master today’s being.
To know the ancient beginning is called the discipline of the Dao. The ancient is the source from which things arise; the present is the current state of things, while the ancient is their origin. Grasping their source, advance and retreat, speed and slowness lie within my control.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Skill of the Ancients**
The skillful masters of old were subtle, profound, and penetrating—too deep to be known.
They exhausted the coarse and guarded the subtle, reaching the utmost subtlety. Subtlety perfected, they became all-pervading and profoundly unknowable.

Only because they could not be known were they forced to describe their bearing:
Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;
Cautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;
Reserved, as if a guest;
Yielding, like ice about to melt;
Simple, like uncarved wood;
Vast, like a valley;
Turbid, like muddy water.

Who can still the turbid to gradually clarify it?
Who can remain at rest to gradually bring forth life?
Those of the world who drown their nature in things grow turbid and never clear; those who desiccate their nature through stillness grow inert and never live. But knowing that turbidity disturbs nature, one stills it—stilled, it slowly clears. Knowing that extinguishing nature is not the Way, one moves—moved, it slowly lives. As the *Yi* says: "Still and unmoving, yet responsive, it penetrates all things under heaven." What is called "movement" here is of the same kind.

Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Fullness arises from extremity, leading to turbidity that cannot clear and stillness that cannot live—hence fullness.
Only by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.
No thing does not wear out; only by not being full does its weariness depart without needing renewal.

**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost Void**
Attain the utmost void; guard steadfast stillness.
If the void is not utterly attained, something remains; if stillness is not steadfastly guarded, movement lingers. Though mountains and hills are removed, motes of dust remain—this is not the utmost or the steadfast. To attain the void is still to dwell in being; to guard stillness is still to be bound by movement—how much more so for other things? Without the utmost or the steadfast, demanding the function of void and stillness is difficult.

All things arise together; I observe their return.
Only by attaining the utmost void and steadfast stillness can one observe the transformations of the ten thousand things without being disturbed by change, knowing that all arising must return. If I were to arise together with the ten thousand things, I would not be able to know this.

The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root.
All things arise from nature and return to nature—like blossoms and leaves growing from the root and returning to it, or waves rising from water and returning to it.

Returning to the root is called stillness.
If one cannot naturally return to nature, merely stopping movement and stilling thoughts to seek stillness is not true stillness. Only by returning to the root is there stillness.

This is called returning to life.
Life is the mystery of nature. Nature can be spoken of, but when it comes to life, it cannot be spoken.

The *Yi* says: "Exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, one reaches life." The sage’s study of the Dao must begin with exhausting principle, proceed to fulfilling nature, and culminate in returning to life. Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are how the sage engages with things, yet the function of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music must have a source. Those who act without knowing their source are common people; those who know their source and then act are noble ones. This is called exhausting principle. However, one must exert the heart to exhaust principle before attaining it—without seeking, it is not obtained. When things daily confront one, only by seeking can one respond, but this requires effort, and its achievement is slight. Apart from sages, those not obscured by things preserve their nature, which is serene, effortlessly centered, unthinking yet attaining, responsive to things as they come—this is called fulfilling nature. Yet this is still my nature, and as long as there is a distinction between self and things, it verges on delusion.

The ruler’s decree is called life; Heaven’s decree is called life.
Engaging with things through nature without knowing it is oneself is why it is entrusted to life.

This is called returning to life.
Returning to life is called constancy.
When things arise, even the vastness of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, is subject to change and impermanence. Only by returning to nature does one abide in serene constancy.

Knowing constancy is called illumination.
Not taking the return to nature as illumination is merely worldly wisdom—though one may call it illumination, it is not true illumination.

Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.
Not knowing the return to nature, one moves with things—no action is not misfortune. Though one may gain for a moment, the loss is profound.

Knowing constancy, one is capacious.
When deluded by delusion, one is self-righteous and sees others as wrong—all things become enemies. How can one be capacious? But knowing all is delusion, even enemies are met with compassion and pity—what cannot be accommodated?

Capacious, thus impartial.
Without exception, all is accommodated, and the feelings of self and others are exhausted—whom would one favor?

Impartial, thus kingly.
Without exception, all is impartial—then the world will come and submit.

Kingly, thus Heaven.
Without exception, all is embraced—what can Heaven add?

Heaven, thus Dao.
Heaven still has form; the Dao is the utmost. Yet even the Dao cannot advance beyond this.

Dao, thus enduring; the body does not perish.
**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**
The highest ruler—those below know only of his existence.
Governing the world through the Dao without ever ruling, the people do not know why things are so—they merely acknowledge his existence.

Next, they draw near and praise him.
Governing the world through benevolence and righteousness, his virtue is cherished and his achievements visible, so the people draw near and praise him. Though his name is fine, the distinction between greater and lesser begins here.

Next, they fear him; next, they scorn him.
Governing the people through policies, they cannot but fear—yet where power does not reach, they scorn him.
Thus, when trust is insufficient, there is distrust.
If I truly trust myself, governing the world through the Dao suffices.
Only when lacking self-trust does one resort to benevolence and righteousness, then weigh them with punishments and policies—thus the people begin to distrust.
How solemnly he values his words!
When his work is accomplished and affairs settled, the hundred clans all say, "We are so of ourselves."
The sage, with self-trust to spare, in his speech still values them, not lightly uttering them from his mouth—thus the people trust him.
When his work is accomplished and affairs settled, the people daily turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression, yet do not know it.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao**
When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness.
When the great Dao flourishes, benevolence and righteousness operate within it, yet the people do not know.
Only when the great Dao declines do benevolence and righteousness appear.
When wisdom and intelligence emerge, there is great falsity.
The world does not know that the Dao suffices to govern the myriad things, yet imposes wisdom and intelligence—thus the people begin to repay with falsity.
When the six relations are disharmonious, there are filial piety and compassion.
When the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers.
When the six relations are harmonious, who is not filial and compassionate?
When the state is well-ordered, who is not loyal?
Yao was not unfilial, yet only Shun is praised—for he had no blind father.
Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou were not disloyal, yet only Longfeng and Bigan are praised—for there were no Jie and Zhou.
Fish trapped in a dried-up marsh exhale moisture upon one another, moisten one another with dampness—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes.

**Chapter Nineteen: Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom**
Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.

Not that sagacity and wisdom are insufficient to grasp the Dao—had sagacity and wisdom governed the world, would there be any who did not □□ things? Yet the people of the age, unable to comprehend the root of sagacity and wisdom, perceive only their branches and take them for skill in overcoming things. Thus they gallop along the branch-streams, and the people begin to suffer harm beyond measure. Therefore, abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.

Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion. Never has there been one who practiced benevolence yet neglected their kin; never has there been one who upheld righteousness yet failed their lord. Benevolence and righteousness are the means by which filial piety and loyalty are realized. Yet when they decline, people usurp the names of benevolence and righteousness to seek profit in the world. Thus sons defy fathers, and fathers abuse sons—this is the work of the traces of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.

Abandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or bandits. Skill is for facilitating tasks; profit is for aiding things. Neither is intended for theft, yet without them, thieves and bandits cannot act. Therefore, abandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or bandits.

These three are considered cultural refinements, yet they are insufficient—thus they must be assigned to something. Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires. The world values these three as remedies for disorder, believing that cultural refinement is insufficient. Some attribute them to sagacity and wisdom, others to benevolence and righteousness, still others to skill and profit—all in an attempt to govern through refinement. Yet the world grows ever more disordered. Why not return to the root?

Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires, and the world each returns to its nature. Though these three exist, they have no use. Therefore it is said: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity. This is the ultimate of sagacity and wisdom, the perfection of benevolence and righteousness, the pinnacle of skill and profit.

Yet Confucius governed the world with benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, while Laozi abandoned and discarded them. Some deem their approaches different. The *Yi* says: "That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the instrument." Confucius, foreseeing the troubles of later ages, took deep concern. Thus he showed people the instruments while obscuring the Dao, allowing those below the middle to uphold the instruments without being misled by the Dao, thereby avoiding failure in becoming noble persons. Those above the middle, by this means, could ascend to higher understanding.

Laozi acted otherwise. His aim was to clarify the Dao. The Dao cannot be spoken; whatever can be spoken is but its semblance. The enlightened use the false to recognize the true, while the benighted cling to semblances and fall into grave error. Thus in later ages, some have seized upon Laozi’s words to bring chaos to the world, while those who study Confucius commit no great errors. Many have used Laozi’s words to attain the Dao, while those who seek it in Confucius often struggle to find an entry point. The two sages acted out of necessity. Perfection in one aspect inevitably entails neglect in another.

**Chapter Twenty: Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**

**Chapter Twenty: Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**

To abandon learning is to be without sorrow. Pursuing learning leads to daily accumulation; cultivating the Dao leads to daily reduction. Not knowing the true nature of life and destiny, one seeks to augment through learning, heaping up what one has not yet heard, accumulating without end. Yet without a unifying principle, the round harms the square, the straight harms the curved, and the mind becomes entangled, unable to bear its sorrows. This is the calamity that befalls the learner. Thus it is said: abandon learning, and there is no sorrow.

As for the sage, though he has never ceased to learn, he takes the Dao as his master. He does not learn and yet lacks nothing; he learns much and yet is not confused. Vast and unburdened, he is without sorrow—why would he need to abandon learning?

Between "aye" and "nay," how great is the distance? Between good and evil, how vast is the difference? When the learner is drowned in what he has heard and lacks a unifying principle, then "aye" becomes reverence and "nay" becomes contempt—these cannot be spoken of in the same breath. How much more so the opposition between good and evil? Only the sage knows that the myriad things all emerge from the same nature yet are completed in delusion. Like painting horses and oxen, like carving tigers and swine, none are their true forms. When all distinctions of right and wrong, same and different vanish, who can say how great the distance between them truly is? If this is so, then the myriad things grow together without harming one another, and the Dao flows in parallel without conflict—nothing is strange in this.

What people fear, one cannot but fear.

The sage equalizes self and other, unifies same and different, and his mind leaves no residue. Yet how could this mean he neglects the world’s laws, violates social roles, or disrupts principle? What people fear, I too fear; what people do, I too do. Though I stand among the ranks of ruler and minister, father and child, and move within the domains of ritual, music, punishment, and governance, the world does not perceive me as different. What keeps me from being ensnared by things is nothing but the mind.

Vast and boundless, it has no end.

People all follow what they know, rigidly confined within their narrow paths. The sage traverses both being and non-being, entering all without obstruction—vast and boundless, it cannot be exhausted.

The multitude bustles and rejoices, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending the terrace in spring. I alone remain still, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. People are each drowned in their own preferences, delighting in their pleasures as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending the terrace in spring, clamoring to follow them without knowing their error. Only the sage deeply investigates delusion and meets it with stillness, unmoved, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.

Adrift, as if with no place to return.

Riding the principle of the myriad things without self-interest, he seems to have no place to return.

The multitude all have more than enough; I alone seem lacking.

The multitude cling to what they know, each considering themselves full. The sage embraces the myriad things without being bound to one, transcending as if lacking.

Is my mind that of a fool? So muddled!

Muddled as if foolish, yet not foolish.

The common people are bright; I alone seem dim. The common people are sharp; I alone seem dull.

The world takes discrimination as wisdom. The sage knows that the delusions of the multitude are not worth distinguishing, so outwardly he seems dim, inwardly he seems dull.

Vast like the sea, drifting as if without place to rest.

Suddenly like the sea, its shores unseen, drifting without fixed abode, its resting place unknown.

The multitude all have their uses; I alone seem stubborn and coarse.

Each has their abilities, so the world can employ them all. The sage’s talents are complete and virtue perfect, as if he has nothing to offer—hence he is suspected of stubbornness and coarseness.

I alone differ from others and value drawing sustenance from the Mother.

The Dao is the Mother of the myriad things. The multitude pursue things and forget the Dao, while the sage leaves the myriad things behind and takes the Dao as his foundation. Like an infant with no mixed diet, he draws sustenance from the Mother alone.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Great Virtue**

The manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao.

The Dao is formless. When it moves and becomes virtue, it takes form. Thus virtue is the manifestation of the Dao. Extending this, the forms of all things are the Dao’s manifestation in them.

As for the Dao as a thing, it is only vague and indistinct. Indistinct, yet within it there are images; vague, yet within it there are things.

The Dao is neither being nor non-being, so it is described as vague and indistinct. Yet when it reaches its full movement, images take shape and things become manifest—nothing does not emerge from this vagueness and indistinctness.

Dark and deep, within it there is essence.

When being and non-being are not yet determined, it is vague and indistinct, invisible. At the intersection of being and non-being, its depth and subtlety become apparent. Though form has not yet taken shape, essence resides within it.

Its essence is utterly real; within it there is sincerity.

When things take form, truth and falsehood become mixed. But when essence is present, falsehood has no place. Once truth and falsehood are mixed, they divide from one into two, from two into three, branching out in confusion, no longer trustworthy. But when essence is present, it does not deceive me.

From ancient times to the present, its name has not departed, by which it surveys the origins of the multitude.

Though ancient and present differ, the Dao does not depart—hence it is named "not departing." Only because it has never departed can it survey the changes of the myriad things. *Fu* means beauty, yet even the beauty of the myriad things cannot escape change.

How do I know the nature of the origins of the multitude? By this.

The sage’s knowledge of why the myriad things are as they are comes from embodying the Dao without departing from it.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Yielding Brings Wholeness**

Yielding brings wholeness.

The sage’s every movement follows principle. Where principle lies, whether straight or curved, the essential thing is to achieve passage. Achieving passage, he does not conflict with things; not conflicting, he remains whole.

Bending brings straightness.

Straightness that does not follow principle is not true straightness. Following principle, though it may bend, is the ultimate straightness under heaven.

Hollow brings fullness.

What the multitude gather toward is low. Even if one does not wish to be full, it cannot be avoided.

Worn brings renewal.

Brightness and sharpness are not the Dao. Dullness, as if worn, is the source of daily renewal.

Little brings attainment.

The Dao is one alone. Attaining the one, there is nothing unattained.

Much brings confusion.

Much learning without a unifying principle brings confusion.

Therefore, the sage embraces the one and becomes the model for the world.

Embracing the one means returning to one’s nature. For yielding brings wholeness, bending brings straightness, hollow brings fullness, worn brings renewal, little brings attainment, and much brings confusion—all are the results of embracing the one. Thus the chapter concludes with embracing the one.

Not displaying oneself brings clarity.

The eye does not see itself, so it can see things. The mirror does not illuminate itself, so it can illuminate things. If it were to see or illuminate itself, it would be too occupied with itself to attend to other things.

Not asserting oneself brings distinction.

Not self-promoting brings achievement.

Not boasting brings merit.

Not self-aggrandizing brings longevity.

It is only because one does not contend that the world cannot contend with him.

Not displaying oneself, not asserting oneself, not self-promoting, not self-aggrandizing—all are aspects of not contending. Thus the chapter concludes with not contending.

The ancients’ saying that "the crooked is preserved whole"—was this an empty claim? Truly, wholeness is its return. The world takes straightness as right and crookedness as wrong, yet when one follows principle in the world, one cannot avoid being crooked at times. Thus the chapter concludes by restating: Was this an empty claim? Truly, wholeness is its return. What is called "wholeness" is not merely preserving the body; internally, it preserves the body, and externally, it preserves things. Both self and things are preserved, and when one returns to one’s nature, then one’s straightness is great indeed.

**Chapter 23: Few Words, Naturalness**
Few words are natural. Words that arise naturally are simple and hit the mark; if they are forced and unnatural, they become verbose and hard to believe. Thus it is said: "The Dao that can be spoken is insipid, invisible, inaudible, and inexhaustible in use"—this is what is meant by "few words."

Whirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. What causes these? Heaven and Earth. Even Heaven and Earth cannot last long—how much less can man? When yin and yang do not contend, wind and rain arrive in due time, neither too swift nor too slow, exhausting their momentum before ceasing. But when yang is excessive above and yin is suppressed below, pent-up and unable to release, this gives rise to whirlwinds and violent rains, as if unable to endure—yet their force cannot last the day. The sages of old spoke sparingly and acted plainly, all following their natural course, thus enduring without exhaustion. The world may grow weary of this, deeming it inferior to clever rhetoric that pleases the ear or strange conduct that astonishes the world, unaware that such things cannot last.

Thus, those who engage with the Dao: those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao; those who align with virtue are one with virtue; those who align with loss are one with loss. Those who are one with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them; those who are one with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them; those who are one with loss—loss delights in obtaining them. Confucius said: "If one is committed to benevolence, there is nothing to hate." If commitment to benevolence is like this, how much more so for commitment to the Dao? If one truly engages with the Dao, then what one does that accords with the Dao obtains the Dao; what accords with virtue obtains virtue. Even if one errs, though the error lies in one’s actions, one must still gain something of the Dao and virtue.

When trust is insufficient, there is distrust. Those who do not know the Dao lack firm faith in it; when they err, they doubt it, and thus grow even more distrustful. Only those who know the Dao do not let gains and losses cause them to doubt it.

**Chapter 24: The Unstable Cannot Stand**
One who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who takes long strides cannot walk far. Those who display themselves are not clear; those who assert themselves are not distinguished; those who boast have no merit; those who aggrandize themselves do not endure. No one lacks the ability to stand or walk, yet if one deems standing insufficient and adds tiptoeing, or deems walking insufficient and adds long strides, one will lose one’s ability to stand or walk. Those who display, assert, aggrandize, or boast of themselves are the same. In relation to the Dao, they are called "leftover food and parasitic growths." Just as eating to satiety is enough—excess leads to illness—just as the four limbs are complete—excess is a burden—so too do things sometimes detest such excess. Thus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.

**Chapter 25: The Thing That Is Mixed and Complete**
There is a thing mixed and complete, born before Heaven and Earth. The Dao is neither clear nor turbid, neither high nor low, neither coming nor going, neither good nor evil—it is mixed and forms a body. In humans, it is called nature. Thus it is said: "There is a thing mixed and complete." No one knows its origin; it is profoundly constant and abiding, while Heaven and Earth are born within it.

Silent and empty, it stands alone and does not change; it circulates without end and can be the mother of the world. Silent, without sound; empty, without form—it stands alone without peer and never alters. It moves through all things without exhaustion. When it stoops to nurture the myriad things, it is their mother.

I do not know its name; I style it "Dao," and by force call it "great." The Dao is originally nameless. The sage sees that all things proceed from it, so styles it "Dao"; sees that nothing surpasses it, so by force calls it "great." Yet in truth, it cannot be named. "Great" means passing; passing means far; far means returning. Seeking it from greatness, it passes and departs; seeking it from departure, it is too far to reach. Though it passes and is far, seeking it in return—one’s heart is sufficient.

Thus the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them. Humans emulate Earth; Earth emulates Heaven; Heaven emulates the Dao; the Dao emulates spontaneity. From the perspective of the Dao, even Heaven, Earth, and the king are not truly great. Yet the world is accustomed to knowing the greatness of these three and does not believe in the greatness of the Dao. Thus it is stated plainly: Humans are not as great as Earth; Earth is not as great as Heaven; Heaven is not as great as the Dao; the Dao is not as great as spontaneity. Yet if humans could return to their nature for even a day, they would fully encompass these three.

**Chapter 26: Heaviness as the Root of Lightness**
Heaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness. All things: the light cannot bear the heavy; the small cannot govern the great; the unmoving enables movement; the still controls the restless. Thus lightness takes heaviness as its root; restlessness takes stillness as its ruler. Therefore, the sage travels all day without leaving the heavy supplies. Though there are splendid sights and tranquil dwellings, he moves with transcendent ease, not departing from the heavy supplies. Though the sights are delightful, he must have a tranquil dwelling—so indispensable are heaviness and stillness.

How can the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly in the world? The lord’s person bears the world; if he treats it lightly, he is not fit to bear the world. Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler. Lightness and restlessness are never fitting. If the ruler is light, ministers know he is not dependable; if ministers are restless, the ruler knows their aims are selfish. Thus it is said: Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler.

**Chapter 27: Good Travel Leaves No Tracks**
Good travel leaves no tracks.

Riding the principle in motion, thus leaving no tracks.
Good speech bears no flaws or blame;
speaking only in due season, thus words fill the world without fault.

Good reckoning requires no counting rods—
the numbers of the ten thousand things all arrayed before one,
knowing without calculation, what need for counting?

Good closure uses no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened;
good binding uses no cord or knot yet cannot be undone.

The person of perfect virtue, in relation to the ten thousand things,
is as a mother to her child:
though she sets them free, they do not depart.
Thus, without bolts she can close;
without cords she can bind.

Therefore, the sage is ever good at saving people,
and so there are no outcasts;
ever good at saving things,
and so there is nothing discarded.

Those who rely on defenses and calculations,
set bolts to close,
hold cords to bind—
how little their strength reaches!

The sage’s way with people is not merely to tolerate them,
but to skillfully save them.
If I do not discard others,
how can others not turn to me?
This is called inheriting illumination.

Saving people from peril and hardship
is not the greatest form of rescue.
When they drift through the cycles of birth and death,
obscured by things,
and I extend my utmost clarity to them,
so that the benighted all become bright—
like lamps passed one to another,
transmitted without cease—
this is called skillfully saving people.

Thus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;
the not-good person is the resource of the good.
If one does not value one’s teacher,
does not cherish one’s resource,
though wise, one is greatly deluded.
This is called the essential mystery.

The sage’s subtlety—
even the wise cannot fully comprehend it.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Male**

Know the male, yet hold to the female—
become the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley, constant virtue never departs,
and one returns to the state of infancy.

Know the white, yet hold to the black—
become the world’s model.
As the world’s model, constant virtue never falters,
and one returns to the boundless.

Know honor, yet hold to disgrace—
become the world’s hollow.
As the world’s hollow, constant virtue is fulfilled,
and one returns to simplicity.

Male and female, first and last—these reach me.
White and black, light and dark—these reach me.
Honor and disgrace, noble and base—these reach me.
All desire to be first and hate to be last,
to be bright and hate to be dark,
to be noble and hate to be base—
such is the nature of things.

Yet the reach of first and last is not as pressing as light and dark,
nor is the reach of light and dark as deep as noble and base.
The sages of old cast off delusion to seek the recovery of their nature.
The clearer their nature, the lower their guard;
the lower their guard, the thicker their virtue;
the thicker their virtue, the greater their return.

For to know and yet not act is not as perfect as
to know and yet refrain from acting.
Know the male, yet hold to the female—
this is to know one’s nature.
When one knows nature and stills the heart of contention,
all who vie to be first in the world will turn to them,
like water flowing to a valley, none turning away.
Yet this is like an infant—able to receive but not yet to use.

Thus it is said: *Return to the state of infancy.*
Know the white, yet hold to the black—
this is to see one’s nature.
Dwelling in darkness while gazing upon light,
none in the world can escape its form.
Thus, when the many take it as their model,
though it responds to the ten thousand things,
the model never errs, its use never exhausts.
Thus it is said: *Return to the boundless.*

Know honor, yet hold to disgrace—
this is to recover one’s nature.
All delusions extinguished, abiding in disgrace without resentment,
vast as an empty valley, things come and one responds—
virtue is sufficient here, nature pure and unadulterated.
Thus it is said: *Return to simplicity.*
When simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;
the sage employs it to become a leader of officials.
Thus, great governance does not sever.

The sage, having returned to simplicity,
scatters it again to form vessels, responding to the ten thousand things.
Like a ruler dividing governance to establish officials,
this follows the natural course—
though it governs, there is no severing.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Seeking to Grasp the World**

Those who seek to grasp the world and act upon it—
I see they will not succeed.
The sage does not take the world;
the ten thousand things turn to them,
and they cannot but receive it.
In governing the world, they do not act upon it,
but remove its harms by following the ten thousand things’ natural course.
If one seeks to grasp and act upon it, it cannot be attained.

The world is a sacred vessel—
it cannot be acted upon.
Those who act upon it ruin it;
those who grasp it lose it.

All things cannot be acted upon.
Even a gathering of a hundred people,
if it does not follow their natural course but acts recklessly,
will surely meet with discord and resistance—
how much more the world?
Though small things with few people may be seized by force or cunning,
when it comes to the greatness of the world, with its divine ruler,
if one does not await its natural turning, there will be rebellion;
if one does not allow its natural governance, there will be chaos.

Thus, things may go forth or follow,
may warm or chill,
may strengthen or weaken,
may bear or destroy.
Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extremity.

Yin and yang contend, high and low incline,
great and small interact—
some go forth ahead, some follow behind,
some warm with breath, some chill with wind,
some are strengthened by increase, some weakened by decrease,
some are borne to completion, some are shattered and destroyed—
all are the natural course of things, an inescapable tendency.

Yet the foolish of the world, acting for private gain and seeking advantage,
resist and defy it—
their ruin is either overturning or breaking.
Only the sage knows it cannot be opposed,
and so follows it, eliminating excess, extravagance, and extremity,
preventing it from going too far and harming things,
so the world remains free of disaster.
This is the perfection of non-action.

Even Yao and Tang could not avoid floods and droughts,
yet they never came to ruin—
this is why.
The *Yi*’s *Tai* hexagram says:
*"The ruler, in accordance with it, regulates the Way of heaven and earth,
assists the harmony of heaven and earth,
and thereby aids the people."*
The three yang lines are within, the three yin lines without—
things have reached their utmost flourishing.
The sage fears excess will harm life,
so regulates and assists it, preventing it from going too far.
This is what is meant by eliminating excess, extravagance, and extremity.

---

**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**

One who aids a ruler with the Dao
does not use arms to strengthen the world—
such affairs swiftly return.
The sage uses arms only when unavoidable,
and even then seeks not to overpower the world.
Though they may prevail, their misfortune will surely return to them.
King Ling of Chu, King Min of Qi, the First Emperor of Qin, Emperor Wu of Han—
some perished themselves, some brought disaster to their descendants.
What people detest, what spirits abhor—
none have escaped this fate.

Where armies camp, brambles grow;
after great wars, years of famine follow.
Where arms are present, the people’s affairs are neglected—
fields go untended.
After war, killing energy prevails—
the harvest is damaged.
This is true of all warfare,
how much more so for those who use arms to overpower?

The good warrior is resolute, but does not dare to take by force.
Resolute, yet not boastful;
resolute, yet not vaunting;
resolute, yet not arrogant;
resolute, yet only when unavoidable;
resolute, yet not overbearing.
Boasting, vaunting, arrogance, and overbearing—
these four arise from not being unavoidable.

Things in their prime grow old—
this is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.
All things are thus:
only those who embody the Dao,
though complete, seem incomplete,
though full, seem empty—
never in their prime, thus never growing old,
never dying.

To use arms to overpower the world is to be in one’s prime—
can one avoid growing old? Avoid death?

---

**Chapter Thirty-One: Fine Arms**

Fine arms are instruments of ill omen—
some things detest them.
Therefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell with them.

To employ them in rescuing from peril yet not make them a constant practice—
this is called "not dwelling with them."
The noble person at rest values the left;
in employing arms, values the right.
Arms are instruments of ill omen,
not the instruments of the noble person.
Only when unavoidable are they employed;
tranquility and simplicity are supreme.
Victory is not deemed beautiful—
those who deem it beautiful delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing cannot realize their will in the world.

Auspicious affairs esteem the left;
inauspicious affairs esteem the right.
The deputy general stands on the left;
the supreme general stands on the right—
this is to say, in positions of command, they are arrayed as for mourning rites.
When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful weeping.
When victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Is Eternally Nameless**

The Dao is eternally nameless,
unhewn wood, though small—
none in the world dare make it a subject.
Were lords and kings able to guard it,
the myriad things would of themselves submit.

The nature of unhewn wood is the Dao—
the Dao is eternally nameless,
thus its nature too cannot be named.
As a thing, when spread forth, it is present everywhere;
when gathered in, it does not fill even a hair’s tip—
this is why, though small, it cannot be made a subject.
Thus, the humble commoner who guards it
finds dust, chaff, and husks sufficient to mold Yao and Shun,
while the exalted lord and king who cannot guard it
sees the myriad things refuse to submit.

Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew—
the people, without command, of themselves receive it evenly.

The ascending and descending of the harmonious qi unite as one,
sending down sweet dew—
silently it covers the myriad things, none left uneven.
The sage embodies the utmost Dao to respond to all beings,
just as the dew reaches all without exception—
this is how he makes the myriad things submit.

When names begin to be established,
once names exist, one must also know where to stop.
Knowing where to stop is how one avoids peril.
The sage scatters the unhewn to make vessels,
using vessels to establish names—
how could he indulge in names and forget the unhewn,
pursue the branch and lose the root?
He merely knows to return to nature.
Thus, he rides the myriad things without peril.

The Dao’s presence in the world
is like that of streams and valleys to rivers and seas.

Rivers and seas are where waters gather;
streams and valleys are where waters divide.
The Dao is the ancestor of the myriad things;
the myriad things are the branches of the Dao.
All are water—
thus streams and valleys return to where they gather;
all are Dao—
thus the myriad things submit to their ancestor.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others**

Knowing others is wisdom;
knowing oneself is clarity.
Discernment is wisdom;
freedom from delusion is clarity.
The mind of discernment is not yet free from distinctions,
thus it reaches only to knowing others and not oneself.
When delusions are exhausted, there are no distinctions—
thus one can know oneself and then extend to others.

Overcoming others requires force;
overcoming oneself requires strength.
Force can reach others but not oneself;
mastering oneself and returning to nature
is beyond what force can reach—
this may be called strength.

One who knows contentment is rich.
One who knows contentment finds sufficiency in whatever befalls—
thus is never not rich.
Though possessing the world,
if one clings to a heart of insufficiency,
this is to remain poor for a lifetime.

One who practices perseverance has resolve.
Not contending with things yet unceasingly strengthening oneself—
nothing can wrest away one’s resolve.

One who does not lose their place endures.
Though things change endlessly,
the heart never loses its ground—
thus endures.

One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.
The change of death and life is great,
yet one’s nature remains serene and undying—
this is how the ancients’ utmost persons neither live nor die.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Spreads**

The great Dao spreads—
how it may be left or right!

Spreading, it is without limitation, without exclusion—
thus it reaches everywhere, above and below, in all directions.
The myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse;
its work complete, it does not claim possession.

It nurtures and sustains the myriad things yet does not act as master—
it may be named as small.
The myriad things return to it yet it does not act as master—
it may be named as great.
Thus, the sage never deems himself great,
and so accomplishes his greatness.
If one is great yet harbors the mind of greatness,
one becomes small.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Holding the Great Image**

Hold the great image—
the world will come.
The Dao is neither being nor non-being,
thus it is called the great image.
Were it manifestly formed,
it would have likenesses and differences—
likenesses would attract, differences repel.
Attraction would bring them, repulsion would drive them away—
this would not suffice to make the world come.

Coming yet unharmed,
peaceful, at ease, secure.
Where there are attractions and aversions,
there are benefits and harms.
When attractions and aversions are exhausted,
then toward the myriad things there is no harm—
thus the kingly person is without disquiet, without disturbance, without peril.

Music and bait may halt passing travelers—
the Dao’s utterance is bland, without flavor,
seen yet not sufficient to behold,
heard yet not sufficient to listen to,
used yet inexhaustible.

Setting out music and bait to await comers—
are these not sufficient to halt passing travelers?
Yet when the music ends and the bait is consumed,
they will abandon them and depart.
As for holding the great image to await the world—
the world does not know to love it,
how much less could it be hated?
Though without scent, flavor, form, or sound to please,
its use is inexhaustible.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: Subtle Clarity**

To contract it, first expand it;
to weaken it, first strengthen it;
to abolish it, first exalt it;
to take it, first give it—
this is called subtle clarity.

Had one never given yet suddenly taken,
the momentum would not be fully extended,
the principle would not be sufficient—
momentum not fully extended, taking would be difficult;
principle not sufficient, things would not submit.
Yet this verges on employing cunning—
what difference is there from Guan Zhong or Sun Wu?
The sage’s path and the vulgar’s traces
may indeed appear similar.
The sage rides principle,
while the vulgar employ cunning—
riding principle is like medicine, skillfully responding to illness;
employing cunning is like merchants, skillfully seeking profit.

Softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.
The sage knows hardness and strength are not to be relied upon,
thus abides in softness and weakness.
The world’s hardness and strength vie and clash,
while I alone remain soft and weak, awaiting them.
When the great are wounded and the small perish,
I sit unmoving, awaiting their exhaustion—
this is called overcoming.
Though the sage does not intentionally do this to overcome things—
knowing the natural course of events,
he dwells in their spontaneity.

Fish cannot be removed from the depths;
the state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others.

The fish’s advantage lies not in claws or teeth to overcome things—
while it abides in the deep abyss,
even the strong and forceful cannot seize it.
Once removed from the depths to dry land,
it is but a helpless creature—what can it do?
The sage dwells in softness and weakness,
and the hard and strong cannot harm him—
not only cannot harm him,
but will in the end be controlled by him.
Is this not the state’s sharp instrument?
Fish are only controlled once removed from the depths;
the sage, abiding in softness and weakness without weariness,
thus ultimately subdues the world—
how could this be shared with the common crowd?

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**

The Dao is ever non-active, yet nothing is left undone—
not that it accomplishes all things through non-action,
but that non-action is the intent behind all it does.

Should lords and kings abide by this,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.
As transformation stirs and desires arise,
I would still them with the nameless uncarved block.

The sage transforms things through non-action;
transformation begins in non-action,
then proceeds to action,
and gradually reaches creation.
It is like the growth of an infant—
the more human artifice accumulates,
the more it flourishes.
Thus, the decline of the Three Dynasties
and the shifts in human nature
have grown ever more severe with time.
When desires arise and those above
and all under heaven follow them blindly,
the changes become too numerous to recount.
Yet if, at the very moment of their arising,
one does not move to act,
but instead stills them with the nameless uncarved block,
perhaps they may yet be halted.

The nameless uncarved block itself desires nothing;
through non-desire, it quiets the world,
and the world settles of itself.

The sage harbors no thought of embracing simplicity within,
nor leaves any trace of it without—
thus the uncarved block remains whole and its use vast.
If the desire for simplicity still lingers in the heart,
one strays far from it indeed.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: "The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue"**

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it has no virtue.
The sage follows the heart’s desires without overstepping the mark,
not by deliberate intent at virtue, yet virtue is naturally sufficient.
Those below, knowing virtue’s worth, strive to preserve it,
but this is merely self-completion—what virtue is there in that?

The highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose;
the lesser virtue acts with purpose.
To act without purpose yet still harbor purpose is still to act.
Only acting without acting and without purpose can be called true non-action.
Those below cannot accomplish without acting,
yet even in their action, purpose remains—
they are not those who act blindly without method.

The highest benevolence acts without purpose;
the highest righteousness acts with purpose.
Both benevolence and righteousness cannot escape action,
but their distinction lies in this:
benevolence excels by acting without purpose,
while righteousness achieves merit by acting with purpose.

Virtue has high and low, yet benevolence and righteousness have only high and no low—why?
Because lesser virtue lies between benevolence and righteousness,
and what is below even righteousness is not worth mentioning.

The highest ritual acts, yet none respond—
then it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.
From virtue downward to ritual,
the sage’s means of ordering the people reach their limit.
Thus, when ritual is enacted and none respond,
it resorts to force;
when force meets no response,
punishments arise and weapons are drawn—
then it is mere action without method.

Therefore:
Lose the Dao, and virtue follows;
lose virtue, and benevolence follows;
lose benevolence, and righteousness follows;
lose righteousness, and ritual follows.
Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the harbinger of chaos.
Where loyalty and trust exist without ritual,
loyalty and trust remain unseen.
When ritual is established,
the beauty of loyalty and trust shines forth externally—
between ruler and minister, father and son,
husband and wife, friends—
outwardly resplendent, yet inwardly hollow.
Thus, to follow it is order; to oppose it is chaos.
The distance between order and chaos is thinner than a hair’s breadth—
hence it is called the harbinger of chaos.

"Foreknowledge" is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly.
The sage surveys the myriad things,
their rights and wrongs, gains and losses,
all laid bare as in a mirror’s reflection—
nothing escapes its sight.
What, then, is "before" or "after"?
The common people’s vision is limited to the eye,
their hearing to the ear,
their thoughts to the heart,
their defenses to the realm of things.
They exhaust their intellect to seek understanding,
and when they chance upon some insight,
they deem themselves enlightened,
unaware that this is the very beginning of folly.

Thus, the great man dwells in thickness, not thinness;
in substance, not ornament.
Therefore, he discards that and embraces this.
The world’s petty men delight in their small gains below
and forget what is above—
they favor thinness and neglect thickness,
pluck flowers and discard fruit.
Who but the great man can discard that and embrace this?

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: "Those of Old Who Attained the One"**

Those of old who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
the spirits attained the One and became numinous;
the valleys attained the One and became full;
the myriad things attained the One and came to life;
the lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.

The One is the Dao.
All things that become things do so through the Dao.
The people of the world see things and forget the Dao.
They know only that heaven is clear,
earth is tranquil,
spirits are numinous,
valleys are full,
the myriad things come to life,
and lords and kings are the standard for all under heaven—
yet they do not know that what enables them to attain these
is simply the presence of the Dao.

Their attainment of the One is the same.
Without clarity, heaven would fear splitting;
without tranquility, earth would fear bursting;
without numinosity, spirits would fear fading;
without fullness, valleys would fear exhaustion;
without life, the myriad things would fear annihilation;
without the standard, lords and kings, though noble and high, would fear collapse.

"Attainment" speaks of the extreme.
Heaven not attaining the One does not immediately split,
earth not attaining the One does not immediately burst,
spirits not attaining the One do not immediately fade,
the myriad things not attaining the One do not immediately perish,
lords and kings not attaining the One do not immediately collapse—
yet in the extreme, this is where they must arrive.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root,
the high takes the low as its foundation.
The vastness of heaven and earth,
the nobility of lords and kings—
all arise from the attainment of the One.
Yet what, after all, is the One?
Invisible to the eye, intangible to the grasp—
it is the most subtle of heaven and earth,
what we call humble and low.

Thus, lords and kings call themselves "orphaned," "widowed," "unworthy"—
is this not taking the humble as their root?
Those who used these titles in the past
merely grasped the root and forgot the branch.

Thus, to assemble the parts of a carriage is not to make a carriage.
Do not desire it to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.
Wheels, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, yoke, hub, linchpin—
each part can be counted,
yet the carriage itself cannot be counted.
Only then do we know that "nothing" is what makes the carriage—
this is what is meant by "nothing’s use as use."

Then do heaven and earth become heaven and earth through greatness?
Do lords and kings become lords and kings through nobility?
Within greatness and nobility, the One resides—
this is what makes them heaven and earth, lords and kings,
yet none know it.

Thus, the One dwells in nobility yet is not noble,
dwells in humility yet is not humble—
not like jade, lustrous yet unable to be humble,
or stone, coarse yet unable to be noble.

**Chapter Forty: "Reversion Is the Movement of the Dao"**

Reversion is the movement of the Dao.
Returning to one’s nature is stillness,
yet in its quiescent non-action,
when stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven—
this is the origin of movement.

Weakness is the function of the Dao.
The Dao is formless and soundless—
nothing under heaven is weaker than the Dao,
yet nothing under heaven is stronger.
This is how it can function for the myriad things.

Heaven and earth and the myriad things are born of being;
being is born of non-being.

The world does not know that stillness is movement,
weakness is strength—
thus it is told of the origin of things.
For all things under heaven,
we hear of the mother controlling the child,
but never of the child controlling the mother.

**Chapter Forty-One: "When the Highest Scholars Hear of the Dao"**

When the highest scholars hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it.
When middling scholars hear of the Dao, they half-believe, half-doubt it.
When the lowest scholars hear of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.
If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.

The Dao is formless, invisible,
soundless, inaudible.
Without first knowing the falsity of the myriad things,
without the vastness of emptiness or the clarity of insight,
one cannot help but disbelieve.
Thus, the lowest scholars hear of the Dao and deem it absurd, fantastical—
and laugh at it.
The middling scholars hear of the Dao and waver,
appearing and disappearing, doubting it.
Only those who see it clearly
then practice it diligently, embracing it without slack.

Confucius said:
"To speak to him without weariness—was it not Yan Hui?"
This is what is meant by the highest scholars.

Thus, those who establish teachings have said:
To establish is to set forth what is ancient. Those who set forth teachings in antiquity held such sayings, and Laozi adopted them below—what is expounded here is the same.

The luminous Dao seems dim,
illuminating all yet not scrutinizing.
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreating,
as if halting yet not moving—none in the world can surpass its swiftness.
The level Dao seems uneven,
now smooth, now rough, yet wherever it reaches, all is made level without ever being shaved down.
Supreme virtue resembles a valley,
for supreme virtue does not assert virtue, like a valley’s emptiness.
Great whiteness seems sullied—
if whiteness remains unstained, this belongs to the fastidious, not the sage.
Vast virtue seems insufficient,
for when it is so boundless that nothing can be added, it merely stops here—this is not true vastness.
Established virtue seems negligent,
for it follows the self-so of things without imposing itself; outwardly it appears indolent, yet in truth it is established.
True substance seems mutable,
for one who embodies the sage and embraces the spirit, adapting to things without losing constancy, outwardly appears to change.
The great square has no corners,
for it preserves its vastness without carving sharp angles.
The great vessel is slow to complete,
for its greatness cannot be put to immediate use.
The great tone is soundless,
beyond what the ear can hear.
The great image has no form,
beyond what the eye can see.
The Dao is hidden, without name.
Only the Dao is good at bestowing and accomplishing.

The Dao abides nowhere yet is nowhere absent. All these twelve manifestations appear in things, yet the Dao in its wholeness remains hidden, without name. Only by dwelling where it dwells, extending its surplus to bestow upon what is lacking, do things rely on it to be brought to completion.

**Chapter Forty-Two**
The Dao gives birth to the One,
the One gives birth to the Two,
the Two give birth to the Three,
the Three give birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
with qi harmonizing them in the center.

The Dao is neither One nor Two, yet when it pairs with things, the Dao is One while things are not. Thus, the Dao is named as One, yet the Dao is not the One. One and One make Two, Two and One make Three—from this onward, the myriad things are born. Though things number in the tens of thousands and differ in form, none fail to bear yin and embrace yang, with qi harmonizing them in the center. This is because things are born from the Three, and the Three are born from the One—such is the natural principle.

What people despise are only the orphaned, the widowed, and the unworthy, yet kings and lords use these as their titles. People of the world, not knowing the origin of the myriad things, all scorn the few and small while prizing the many and great. Yet kings and lords, though exalted, call themselves orphaned, widowed, and unworthy—those of ancient understanding had already grasped this.

Thus, sometimes diminishing leads to increase, and sometimes increasing leads to diminishment. What others teach, I also teach: “The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death.” I will take this as the father of all teachings.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
The softest in the world gallops through the hardest.
That which has no substance enters where there is no gap.
Through this, I know the benefit of non-action.

Using hardness to oppose hardness—if it does not break, it shatters.
Using softness to oppose hardness—softness does not wear away, nor does hardness suffer harm.
Seek this in things, and water is the example.
Using what exists to enter what exists—resistance prevents reception.
Using what does not exist to enter what exists—what does not exist never wearies, nor is what exists ever aware.
Seek this in things, and the spirit is the example.
Thus, only the sage, through non-action, can command the many strong and move through all things.

The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain these.

**Chapter Forty-Four**
Fame or self—which is dearer?
Self or wealth—which is greater?
To put self before fame, to value self and scorn wealth—this is still not forgetting the self.
One who forgets the self does not possess the self—how much less fame or wealth?
Yet to value the self for the sake of the world, one cannot but forget the self.
Thus, let the world know that fame is not worth cherishing, that wealth is not worth amassing, and only then will they know to value the self. Knowing to value the self, only then will they know to forget the self—this is Laozi’s intent.

Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
Not gaining is taken as harmful, but once gained, the fear of loss is a harm even greater than not gaining. Only by equalizing having and lacking, gain and loss, can one be free from harm.

Excessive love must bring great expense,
hoarding much must bring heavy loss.
Know contentment, and you will not be disgraced;
know when to stop, and you will not be imperiled—
thus can you endure long.

**Chapter Forty-Five**
Great perfection seems flawed,
yet its use is never exhausted.
Great fullness seems empty,
yet its use is never depleted.
The world takes non-flawed as perfection, so perfection must have exhaustion.
It takes non-empty as fullness, so fullness must have depletion.
The sage aims for great perfection yet does not guard against its flaws,
seeks great fullness yet does not despise its emptiness—
thus perfection is never exhausted, and fullness is never depleted.

Great straightness seems bent,
great skill seems clumsy,
great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Straightness that does not bend will break;
following principle in action, though crooked, is straight.
Skill that does not seem clumsy will labor;
entrusting things to their nature, though clumsy, is skill.
Eloquence that does not seem inarticulate will be exhausted;
speaking according to principle, though inarticulate, is eloquence.

Restlessness overcomes cold,
stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and tranquility set the world right.
Perfection without flaw, fullness without emptiness, straightness without bending, skill without clumsiness, eloquence without inarticulateness—these are like restlessness that cannot be still, stillness that cannot be restless. Restlessness can overcome cold but not heat; stillness can overcome heat but not cold. Both are bound to one side and not the mean. Only in serene purity, unstained by any one thing—neither perfect nor flawed, neither full nor empty, neither straight nor bent, neither skillful nor clumsy, neither eloquent nor inarticulate—can one overcome all and serve as the world’s standard.

**Chapter Forty-Six**
When the world follows the Dao,
warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.

**Chapter Forty-Six (continued)**
When the world abides in its proper place,
there is no strife, and all governs itself—
thus warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.
When the world lacks the Dao,
warhorses breed even at the suburbs.

No crime is greater than indulging desire,
no calamity greater than discontent,
no fault greater than covetousness.
To display what is desirable to others is already a crime;
those who never find contentment court greater calamity still;
those who must obtain what they desire incur the gravest fault.
Even a common man, harboring but one of these,
brings misfortune upon himself—
how much more so when lords and kings act thus,
for it is from this that warhorses arise.

Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.
The contented man finds sufficiency wherever he dwells,
and so nothing is lacking.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
Without stepping beyond the door, one knows the world;
without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Nature as substance fills and pervades the cosmos,
without distinction of far or near, past or present.
The sages of old, though they never stepped beyond door or window,
knew all things—
simply because their nature was whole.
People of the world, deluded by things,
divide their nature between ears and eyes.
Within, they are confounded by body and mind;
without, they are obstructed by mountains and rivers.
Their sight does not extend beyond the door,
their hearing does not reach beyond the window—
yet even the smallest gap can block and sever.
Not knowing that the sage returns to nature to find sufficiency,
they seek it outside,
and so the farther they go, the less they know.

Thus, the sage knows without traveling,
names without seeing,
achieves without acting.
What nature reaches is not merely knowledge or naming—
it is the power to follow the natural course of things,
to accomplish without labor.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
In the pursuit of learning, one daily accumulates;
without knowing the Dao and yet striving to learn,
hearing and seeing grow ever more,
yet without unity, they become a burden.
Confucius said:
*“Hear much, select what is good and follow it;
see much and remember it—
this is secondary knowledge.”*

In the pursuit of the Dao, one daily diminishes.
If for a single day one knows the Dao,
one sees that the ten thousand things are but illusion.
Abandoning illusion to seek the recovery of nature—
this is called diminishing.
Confucius said to Zigong:
*“Do you think I am one who learns much and remembers it?”*
*“Yes, is it not so?”*
*“No. I unify it with a single thread.”*

Diminish and diminish again,
until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To abandon illusion in pursuit of recovering nature may be called diminishing,
yet the mind that seeks to abandon illusion still remains.
Only when one forgets even this mind,
when nature is pure and nothing is left,
can one act without failing in non-action.

To take the world, one must always act without contrivance;
those who contrive cannot take the world.
All people have the desire to take the world,
so they scheme and strive,
their minds manifesting outwardly—
and things resist them,
so in the end they cannot succeed.
The sage, acting without contrivance, has no schemes;
his mind manifests outwardly,
and things are at peace with him.
Though he does not seek to take the world,
the world comes to him.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
The sage has no fixed mind;
he takes the minds of the people as his mind.
The good, I treat as good;
the not-good, I also treat as good—
thus virtue is goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust;
the untrustworthy, I also trust—
thus virtue is trustworthiness.

Void and formless,
he takes the forms of the ten thousand things as his form.
If the void had its own form,
how could it shape the ten thousand things?
Thus, the sage has no mind of his own;
he takes the minds of the people as his mind.
Whether good or not-good, he treats all as good;
whether trustworthy or not, he treats all as trustworthy.
Good and not-good lie with them,
but my way of treating them as good never changes—
this may be called virtuous goodness.
Trust and distrust lie with them,
but my way of trusting never alters—
this may be called virtuous trustworthiness.

Otherwise, to favor the good and reject the not-good,
to trust the trustworthy and reject the untrustworthy—
how could this be called *“constantly good at saving people, and so leaving none behind”*?

The sage in the world is ever cautious,
for the world he harmonizes his mind.
The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,
and the sage treats them all as children.
The world’s good and evil, truth and falsehood,
are each convinced of their own rightness,
mutually opposing and harming one another,
uncertain of what to settle upon.
The sage, troubled by this,
is ever cautious for the world,
harmonizing his mind—
without good or evil, without truth or falsehood,
he treats all with unity.
They fix their ears and eyes to observe the sage’s judgments,
but he meets them all with the simplicity of an infant.
Toward the good, he feels no delight;
toward the evil, he feels no resentment.
Thus, the good do not grow proud,
the evil do not grow bitter—
all relax and transform,
and the world begins to settle.

**Chapter Fifty**
Emerging from life, entering death—
nature itself is neither born nor dies.
To emerge is to be born; to enter is to die.
Of those who live, thirteen parts;
of those who die, thirteen parts;
of those whose lives lead them to death’s ground, thirteen parts.

Those who use things to extract essence and nourish themselves belong to the living;
those who indulge in sound and color, scent and taste, to harm themselves belong to the dead.
These two once divided, the way of life and death is set.
Yet I know activity without rest,
speech without silence,
thought without forgetting—
all hastening toward exhaustion,
which is what is meant by *“those whose lives lead them to death’s ground.”*
The way of life and death, spoken of in tens,
three parts each—
is this not nine parts for life and death,
and one part alone for neither life nor death?
Neither life nor death—
this is what the *Yi* calls *“still and unmoving.”*
Laozi speaks of the nine but not the one,
letting people discover it for themselves,
to glimpse the wonder of thoughtless non-action.

Why is this so?
Because of the thickness of life-generating.
Where there is life, there is death—
thus those who live are also those who die.
When what people rely upon for life is thick,
the way of death is ever nine in ten.

I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life,
walking on land, do not meet rhinoceros or tiger;
entering battle, do not avoid armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn,
the tiger nowhere to place its claws,
weapons nowhere to lodge their blades.
Why is this so?
Because they have no ground for death.

The sage always dwells in neither life nor death—
how could there be ground for death where even life’s ground is absent?

**Chapter Fifty-One**
The Dao gives them life,
virtue nurtures them,
things give them form,
and circumstances complete them.
The Dao is the mother of the ten thousand things—
thus what gives life to the ten thousand things is the Dao.
As it moves and becomes virtue,
it herds and nourishes the multitude without refusal—
thus what nurtures the ten thousand things is virtue.
Yet neither Dao nor virtue can shape themselves;
only through things do they take form.
Things cannot complete themselves;
only through the interplay of near and far, hard and soft,
accumulating into circumstances,
do the changes of rise and fall, order and chaos, come to completion.

Thus, the ten thousand things all revere the Dao and honor virtue. Though form arises from things and completion from circumstances, without the Dao there is no life, and without virtue there is no nurturance—hence the reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue. The Dao is revered like father and elder brother, virtue honored like lords and kings, for the Dao has no position while virtue has a name.

The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise not by command (or: rank) but always by nature. Those who rely on rank to attain reverence and honor are not truly revered or honored. Therefore, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, raises them, rears them, completes them, ripens them, nourishes them, and shelters them—giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, raising yet not dominating. This is called profound virtue.

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
The world has a beginning,
which serves as the world’s mother.
Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.
When the Dao is still without name,
it is that by which things find their beginning.
When it comes to have a name,
it is that by which things find their life.
Thus it is called the beginning, and also the mother—
its child is the ten thousand things.
Having known (or: attained) the mother,
one proceeds to know the child.
Having given life to the child,
one returns to guard the mother—
thus to the end of life one is not imperiled.

The sage embodies the Dao to encompass all things,
like knowing the child through the mother—
clear and without anything unexamined.
Though his wisdom suffices to encompass all,
he never allows things to obscure the Dao,
and so he guards the mother to the end.
Block the openings, close the gates—
throughout life one does not toil.
Open the openings, assist the affairs—
throughout life one cannot be saved.

All under Heaven possess this Dao,
yet they constantly suffer from forgetting the Dao and following things.
The eye delights in color, the ear in sound—
opening the heart that delights in these
and using these affairs to assist it,
one sinks throughout life and cannot be saved.
The sage’s way of never toiling throughout life
lies solely in blocking and closing,
never going forth to follow them.

Seeing the small is called clarity.
The harm of delight begins small but gradually grows.
Knowing that the small will become great
and closing it—this is called clarity.

Guarding the soft is called strength.
Pursuing what delights one without reflection,
thinking oneself strong—this is not true strength.
Only one who sees delight and knows to fear it
can be called strong.

Use its light, return to its clarity—
leave no disaster to the self.
This is called practicing constancy.
The worldly open what delights them
and give themselves over to things,
going forth without return.
The sage blocks and closes,
not cutting off from things but responding with spirit,
using its light while the self does not engage.
The ear’s ability to hear, the eye’s to see,
the nose’s to smell, the mouth’s to taste,
the body’s to touch, the mind’s to think—
all are what is called light.
When light meets things, things depart but clarity remains undiminished.
Thus one responds to endless changes without exhaustion,
disaster does not reach the self,
and so one’s constant nature remains serene,
passed down unbroken.

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
If I were suddenly to have knowledge
and walk the great Dao,
only the practice of contrivance would I fear.
Those who embody the Dao have no knowledge, no action,
no contrivance—yet things transform themselves.
Now, if one suddenly has knowledge
and walks the great Dao,
there is contrivance and establishment,
which is not natural—
enough to be feared.

The great Dao is level and smooth,
yet the people prefer byways.
The great Dao is level and easy, without peril or obstruction,
but those in the world who do not know it
consider it circuitous and distant,
preferring byways to seek shortcuts.
Thus all who abandon their nature
and contrive some practice
are those who desire speed.

The courts are well-swept,
the fields overgrown with weeds,
the granaries empty.
Yet they wear embroidered robes,
carry sharp swords,
sate themselves with food and drink,
and possess surplus wealth and goods—
this is called the boast of thieves.
Is this not contrary to the Dao?

The vulgar are bright, I alone seem dim;
the vulgar are discerning, I alone seem dull.
How could one still adorn the branches and neglect the root,
making contrivance one’s affair,
boasting to teach thieves?

**Chapter Fifty-Four**
What is well established cannot be uprooted,
what is well embraced cannot be lost—
thus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.
How could there be establishment without uprooting,
embrace without loss?
Only the sage knows the truth of nature
and the falsity of things,
discarding things to cultivate the self.
His virtue is full and substantial—
truly, nothing is established, yet his establishment cannot be uprooted;
truly, nothing is grasped, yet his embrace cannot be lost.
Thus even to his descendants,
sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;
cultivate it in the family, and its virtue abounds;
cultivate it in the village, and its virtue grows long;
cultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes abundant;
cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.
Thus, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

What lies beyond Heaven and Earth
is unseen by the vulgar,
yet its principle can be inferred.
The perfection of cultivating the self—
observing the self through the self,
the family through the family,
the village through the village,
the state through the state—
all lie within what I can know.
But how do I know that the sage
observes the world through the world
as I observe the self through the self?
How could the self be observed through the self,
yet the world alone not be observed through the world?
Thus it is said: How do I know the world is thus?
By this—meaning, also, by observing it through the self.

**Chapter Fifty-Five**
One who contains profound virtue
is like a newborn child.
Laozi’s words on the Dao and virtue
often compare them to an infant—
all speak of its essence, not yet its function.
The infant is tranquil, without desire—
its essence is perfect,
yet when things come, it does not know how to respond,
so it cannot yet be called function.

Poisonous insects do not sting,
fierce beasts do not seize,
birds of prey do not strike.
The Dao has no form or body—
how could things see it,
let alone harm it?
What causes humans to have form
is their having a heart-mind.
Thus, with a heart-mind comes form,
with form comes opposition,
and with opposition comes harm.
Beings without a heart-mind
have nothing to oppose—
how could they be harmed?
The infant reaches this state
solely because it has no heart-mind.

Bones weak, sinews soft, yet its grip is firm.
Not knowing the union of male and female,
yet its organ stirs—
its essence is at its fullest.
Without grasping, it naturally grips;
without desire, it naturally stirs—
thus one knows its essence is full,
not the heart-mind.

All day it cries without its throat becoming hoarse—
its harmony is at its fullest.
The heart-mind moves, and qi is harmed;
qi harmed, crying becomes hoarse.
All day crying without hoarseness—
thus one knows its heart-mind does not move
and its qi is harmonious.

To know harmony is called constancy.
Harmony means nothing external harms the internal.
To return to one’s destiny is called constancy—
when encountering things, one knows to revert to their root.

To know harmony is called constancy—
to obtain the root and respond to the myriad things.
In truth, these are one and the same Dao,
thus both are called constancy.

To know constancy is called clarity.
To augment life is called ominous.
Life cannot be augmented;
to desire augmentation is to depart from its true nature.
Ominous indeed!

When the heart-mind commands qi, it is called force.
Qi detests reckless action,
yet when the heart-mind further commands it,
force becomes extreme.
When things reach their prime and then age,
this is called "not following the Dao."
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

Augmenting life and commanding qi
prevents them from following their natural course,
daily leading toward rigidity and aging.
Thus, one loses the nature of the infant.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Knowing Do Not Speak**
The knowing do not speak;
those who speak do not know.
Block the openings, shut the gates,
blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,
soften the glare, merge with the dust—
this is called "mysterious sameness."

The Dao is not found in speech,
yet neither is it separate from speech.
Those who know may not speak,
those who speak may not know.
Only by blocking the openings and shutting the gates
to guard against externals,
blunting sharpness, untangling knots,
softening glare, and merging with dust
to cultivate the internal—
silent and unaligned,
one merges with the Dao.

Thus, it cannot be gained through closeness
nor through distance,
cannot be gained through benefit
nor through harm,
cannot be gained through honor
nor through disgrace—
therefore, it is revered by the world.

If it could be gained through closeness,
it could also be gained through distance;
if through benefit, then through harm;
if through honor, then through disgrace.
Those who embody the Dao
equally embrace the myriad things—
who then is close or distant?
They view opposition and compliance equally—
who then benefits or harms?
Unknowing of glory or shame—
who then is honored or disgraced?
Such calculations fall short—
this is why it is revered by the world.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing the State with Integrity**
Govern the state with integrity,
use the military with strategy,
take the world through non-action.

The sages of old
were gentle with the distant and capable with the near,
without intent to use the military.
Only when unavoidable did they engage in campaigns.
Thus, governing the state was integrity,
using the military was strategy.
Yet even this is insufficient to take the world—
the world is a sacred vessel, not to be acted upon.
Those who act upon it fail;
those who grasp it lose it.
Only those who embody the Dao,
vast and unoccupied,
though they do not take the world,
the world naturally turns to them.

How do I know this is so?
By this:
The more prohibitions in the world, the poorer the people.
When rulers multiply prohibitions,
the conditions below fail to reach above,
and the people grow poor and desperate.
The more sharp tools the people possess, the more the state darkens—
sharp tools are schemes and stratagems.
When the ruler is enlightened,
they ensure the people remain without cunning or desire.
When the people abound in schemes,
their superiors grow dim and confused.

The more clever techniques and rare objects arise,
the more people abandon fundamental work
and pursue frivolous skills,
giving rise to useless novelties.
The more laws and decrees are promulgated,
the more thieves and bandits appear—
fearing human deceit,
rulers multiply laws to overcome it.
Yet when the people have nowhere to place their hands,
they daily turn to theft and banditry.

Thus, the sage says:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;
I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;
I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves;
I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.

**Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Government’s Obscurity**
When the government is obscure, the people are pure;
when the government is exacting, the people are lacking.
Disaster!—fortune leans upon it.
Fortune!—disaster lurks within.
Who knows their ultimate end?
There is no fixed standard.
The upright reverts to the strange,
the good reverts to the ominous.
The people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.

The vastness of heaven and earth
is obscured by世俗俗见,
yet they do not know it.
Fortune leans upon disaster,
disaster lurks within fortune—
like the succession of youth and age, life and death,
which never ceases.
Yet the deluded do not know this.
Only the sage,
transcending the myriad things
and grasping their beginning and end,
attains their wholeness while overlooking minor distinctions.
They appear obscure, as if without clarity,
yet the people are pure, each preserving their nature.

The世人, not knowing the Dao’s wholeness,
take their limited knowledge as supreme.
They consider themselves fortunate,
unaware of disaster lurking behind;
they consider themselves good,
unaware of ominous forces arising within.
Pursuing exactness as clarity,
they severely harm things yet fail to recognize their error—
how lamentable!

Thus, the sage is square but does not cut,
is sharp but does not wound,
is straight but not unrestrained,
is bright but does not dazzle.
Knowing that minor distinctions cannot encompass things,
though capable of squareness, sharpness, straightness, and brightness,
they do not employ these abilities,
fearing to fall into partiality and fail to return.
This is what the世俗俗 call obscurity.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**
In governing people and serving heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.
Only frugality is called "early compliance."
Early compliance is called "accumulating virtue."
Accumulating virtue, nothing is unconquerable;
nothing unconquerable—none know its limit.
None know its limit, thus one can possess the state.
Possessing the state’s mother, one can endure long.

All things:
square cuts,
sharp wounds,
straight stretches,
bright dazzles.
Only the sage is square but does not cut,
sharp but does not wound,
straight but not unrestrained,
bright but does not dazzle—
this is called frugality.
Frugality means possessing but not using.
The世俗 lament having nothing to subdue others,
but if one truly possesses and can be frugal,
though never contending with things,
things know they cannot surpass—
thus, they are subdued early.

Once subdued, one withdraws and conceals,
using it only to the end of life without testing it—
thus, virtue is deeply accumulated.
Virtue accumulated to such depth,
though the world’s rigidity cannot be overcome,
none can fathom its measure.
Only then can one possess the state.
Those世俗小人 who wield minor power
and use it lightly,
once tested and found wanting,
the world measures their depth and challenges them.
Though they wish to preserve their state, it cannot be done.
This is how I know frugality can possess the state—
possessing the state, one possesses its mother.

This is called "deepening the root and firming the stem,
the Way of long life and enduring vision."
Mencius said: "Preserve the heart-mind, nurture the nature—
this is how one serves heaven."
Governing people with frugality can possess the state—
this is it.
Serving heaven with frugality deepens the root and firms the stem—
this is it.
The sages of old preserved the constancy of their nature and life,
not depleting the internal with the external—
thus, their roots ran deep and could not be uprooted,
their stems were firm and could not be detached.
Though long life and enduring vision may follow,
governing people and serving heaven,
though differing in internal and external,
share the same principle—nothing surpasses frugality.

**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
When cooking a small fish, one must not stir;
when governing a great state, one must not disturb.
Disturbance wearies the people;
stirring spoils the fish.

Approach the world with the Dao,
and its *gui* spirits will not be numinous.
The sage practices non-action,
allowing people to rest in their natural state.
Externally, nothing disturbs them;
internally, nothing frightens them—
thus, nothing can invade.
Though the *gui* spirits have no use for their numinosity,
it is not that their *gui* spirits are not numinous,
but that their numinosity does not harm people.
It is not that their numinosity does not harm people,
but that the sage also does not harm people.
It is not that their *gui* spirits are not numinous,
but that they possess numinosity without harming people.
It is not that their numinosity does not harm people,
but that the sage has never harmed people—
thus, their *gui* spirits have no power to act.
When the two do not harm one another,
virtue and power converge and return.

**Chapter 61: The Great State as Low Current**
The great state is the lower current—
the world’s convergence with the great state
is like many waters flowing toward the low.
The world’s intercourse is the world’s female.
The female always overcomes the male with stillness,
using stillness as her lower position.
The many movements rushing toward stillness
are like springs from on high flowing downward.

Thus, when a great state lowers itself before a small state,
it wins the small state;
when a small state lowers itself before a great state,
it wins the great state.
The great state lowers itself to win people;
the small state lowers itself to be received by people.
Both obtain what they desire—
the greater should take the lower position.

**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Mystery of Myriad Things**
The Dao is the mystery of myriad things,
the treasure of the good,
the refuge of the not-good.
Fine words can win esteem;
noble conduct can elevate people.
Why discard those who are not good?

All things manifest externally are but their gateways and halls—
the Dao within them is like their inner chamber.
All things possess it, yet people do not see it.
The worthy obtain and hold it—
thus, it is called "the treasure of the good."
The foolish, though unable to hold it,
cannot be at peace without it—
thus, it is called "the refuge of the not-good."

If one truly has fine words,
they can be traded for esteem in the world;
if one practices noble conduct,
it can be added to others.
Though one was unjust in the morning,
by evening, having heard the great Dao,
delusions vanish and nature is restored—
even if one sought to point out the not-good,
it could not be found.
How then could it be discarded?

Thus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,
though one may precede with large jades and lead with teams of four horses,
it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.
In establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,
the aim is to save people with the Dao.
Though large jades are precious and fine horses excellent,
presenting them is not as beneficial as presenting this Dao.

Why was this Dao valued in ancient times?
Did it not say: "Seek and you will obtain;
have faults and you will be spared"?
Thus, it is honored by the world.

The Dao is originally within us—
the trouble is that people do not seek it.
Seek it, and you will obtain it.
The Dao bears no merit or fault—
the trouble is that people do not know it.
Know it, and no fault can stain you.

**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**
Act without acting,
undertake without undertaking,
taste without tasting.
Treat the great as small, the many as few;
repay resentment with virtue.

The sage acts without acting,
thus nothing is left undone.
Undertakes without undertaking,
thus nothing is left unaccomplished.
Tastes without tasting,
thus nothing is left untasted.
In dealing with the great, small, many, and few,
he meets them all with the Dao alone.

What people cannot forget is resentment—
yet when love and aversion are forgotten,
even repaying resentment becomes repaying virtue.

Resolve difficulties while they are easy;
accomplish the great while it is small.
The world’s difficult tasks must begin with the easy;
the world’s great tasks must begin with the small.
Thus, the sage never attempts the great
and so accomplishes greatness.
One who makes light promises will lack trust;
one who treats many things as easy will encounter many difficulties.
Thus, the sage treats even the difficult as difficult—
and so never encounters difficulty.

People all fear the great and slight the small,
dread the difficult and belittle the easy.
When they wait until things are difficult before planning,
or until they are great before acting,
matters will always fail.
The sage equalizes great and small, many and few—
nothing is not feared, nothing is not difficult,
yet how could anything fail to succeed?

**Chapter 64: What Is at Rest Is Easily Held**
What is at rest is easily held;
what has not yet shown signs is easily planned.
What is fragile is easily broken;
what is minute is easily scattered.
Act before it exists;
govern before it becomes disordered.

When it does not yet exist,
holding and planning it is sufficient.
When it is about to arise,
dissolving and scattering it will not remove it—
yet this is still better than after it has formed.
Thus, acting before it exists is best;
governing before it becomes disordered is next.

A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout;
a nine-story terrace rises from a basket of earth;
a journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath the feet.
Those who act will fail;
those who grasp will lose.
The sage acts without acting, thus does not fail;
grasps without grasping, thus does not lose.

The coming of order and disorder, fortune and misfortune
all resemble those three: accumulating the small to become great.
The sage awaits them with non-action,
guards them with non-grasping—
thus, fortune arises of itself,
misfortune vanishes of itself.
For example, plant seedlings, plow deeply, and mound the earth thickly—
by autumn, they will be lush.
For example, sit in danger as if facing a thief and watch intently—
the thief will retreat of his own accord.

People do not understand the spontaneity of things,
thinking nothing is accomplished without acting,
nothing retained without grasping—
thus, they constantly contend with misfortune for victory,
compete with fortune for growth.
This is why misfortune reaches the point of being irredeemable,
fortune reaches the point of being unfulfilled—
such is its principle.

People in their undertakings often fail when nearly complete.
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
and there will be no failed tasks.
The sage knows the harm of acting,
so does not rely on human aid to assist heaven.
From beginning to end, he follows the natural—
thus, nothing is left unaccomplished.

People’s hearts dwell on gain and loss—
even in minor matters, they do not know to let things be natural.
When they see something nearly complete and fear losing it,
there is none who does not consider it a failure.
Thus, it is said: "Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
and there will be no failed tasks."

Thus, the sage desires not to desire,
does not value rare goods;
learns not to learn,
returns to what the multitude has passed by—
to assist the self-so of the myriad things
without daring to act.

People all follow their desires and harm things,
trust their learning and injure principle.
The sage is not without desire—
he desires not to desire,
thus though he desires, he does not harm things.
He is not without learning—
he learns not to learn,
thus though he learns, he does not injure principle.
Then, inwardly and outwardly empty and bright,
vast and without acting,
he can assist the self-so of the myriad things
and await their self-completion.

**Chapter 65: Those Skilled in the Dao of Old**

Those skilled in the Dao of old
did not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.
The people are hard to govern because of their cleverness.
Thus, to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s bane.
Not to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.
To know these two is also a model.
Constantly knowing the model—
this is called "mysterious virtue."
Mysterious virtue is deep and far-reaching,
opposite to things,
yet leads to great compliance.

What I value is virtue;
what things value is cleverness.
Virtue and cleverness are fundamentally opposed,
yet what cleverness complies with is small,
while what virtue complies with is great.

**Chapter 66: The King of the Hundred Valleys**

The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
is because they excel in lowliness.
Thus, they can be kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,
he must speak as though below them.
If he wishes to lead the people,
he must place himself behind them.
Thus, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel burdened;
though he stands ahead, the people do not feel harmed.
Thus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring.
Because he does not contend,
no one in the world can contend with him.

**Chapter 67: The World Calls Me Great**

The world calls me great, yet I seem unworthy.
Precisely because I am great, I seem unworthy.
If I were worthy, I would have long since been small.

The Dao is vast, formless, nameless,
pervading the myriad things yet resembling none—
this is why it is great.
If it resembled things, it would be but one thing among them—
how could it be great?

I possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:
the first is compassion,
the second is frugality,
the third is not daring to be first in the world.

The Dao takes non-resemblance to things as its greatness,
thus when it moves as virtue,
it is obscure, dull, retreating, and unaligned with the world.
Now, the world values bravery, expansiveness, and aggressive advancement,
while what I cherish—
compassion, restraint, frugality, humility, and retreat—
are all things the world deems unworthy.

Compassion, therefore, can become courage.
The world deems decisive bravery worthy and compassionate restraint inadequate,
not knowing that decisive bravery is easily thwarted,
while compassionate restraint cannot be overcome in the end—
it must lead to courage.

Frugality, therefore, can become expansiveness.
The world deems vastness and abundance worthy and frugal restraint base,
not knowing that vastness is easily exhausted,
while frugal restraint is easily fulfilled—
it must lead to expansiveness.

Not daring to be first in the world, therefore, can become the completion of leadership.
The world deems aggressive advancement capable and not daring to be first shameful,
not knowing that aggressive advancement incurs much resentment,
while not daring to be first is willingly exalted by the world—
it must ultimately become the completion of leadership.
For when uncarved wood is dispersed and becomes vessels,
the sage employs them as officials and leaders.
From uncarved wood to vessels, there begins to be subordination and leadership.

Now, to abandon compassion and seek bravery,
to abandon frugality and seek expansiveness,
to abandon the rear and seek the front—
is death.
Bravery, expansiveness, and being first—
these three are what people universally detest.
To be detested by the multitude is to constantly approach death.

Compassion in battle brings victory;
in defense, it brings firmness.
Heaven will save such a one, protecting him with compassion.
With compassion, one protects things,
and things love him as parents.
Though they would die for him without hesitation,
he can thus engage in battle and defense.
Heaven, wishing to save this person,
opens his heart and will,
making him compassionate toward all.
Being compassionate toward all,
all things will protect him.

**Chapter 68: The Skilled Warrior**

The skilled warrior is not martial.
The warrior’s foundation should be martial,
but his conduct should be cautious.
If he conducts himself with martiality, he will die.

The skilled fighter is not angry.
The sage fights only when unavoidable.
If he fights out of anger, it is for his own sake that he kills—
heaven will bring calamity upon him.

The skilled victor over enemies does not contend.
Because I do not contend, I can overcome their contention.
If both sides contend, victory is not assured.

The skilled employer of people acts with humility.
People all have the desire to be above others,
thus none can employ one another.
If one can truly act with humility,
the world will all be at his service.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
the power of employing people’s strength,
the alignment with heaven—
the ultimate of old.

**Chapter 69: The Use of Arms**

There is a saying in the use of arms:
"I dare not act as host but act as guest.
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."
To advance is to have intent to contend;
to retreat is to have no intent to contend.
This is called "marching without marching,"
"raising arms without arms,"
"engaging the enemy without an enemy,"
"wielding weapons without weapons."
If one has no intent to contend,
though in the midst of armies, it is as if there were no arms to raise,
no enemy to engage, no weapons to wield—
how could there be fault in the use of arms?

The greatest calamity is to underestimate the enemy.
Underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasure.
Thus, when evenly matched armies meet,
the one with sorrow prevails.

**Chapter 70: My Words Are Easy to Know**

My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice,
yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.
The Dao’s greatness restores nature to sufficiency,
and the subtlety of nature is seen in rising, dwelling, eating, and drinking.
The sage points to this to show people—
is it not easy to know?
If one can embody this to respond to things—
is it not easy to practice?
Yet the world constantly suffers from daily use without knowing.
Knowing is already difficult—
how much more so practicing?

Words have their source; affairs have their lord.
It is precisely because of ignorance that they do not know me.
Words are the snare of the Dao;
affairs are the tracks of the Dao.
If the Dao could be fully expressed in words,
hearing words would suffice.
If it could be fully seen in affairs,
examining affairs would suffice.
But since words cannot exhaust it and affairs cannot reveal it,
one cannot but seek its source beyond words
and its lord beyond affairs.
For the sages of old, without thought or action,
there remained a profound, natural, unselfconscious presence—
this is beyond the reach of thought.
Thus, in the end, none know me.

Those who know me are few—thus I am noble. What the multitude can know is not worthy of esteem. Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within. Outwardly, the sage is the same as others; inwardly, he alone is different.

**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**
To know the unknown is supreme; to not know the known is a flaw. The Dao cannot be reached by thought, and thus cannot be known. Yet when one has not yet known, without knowing there is no way to enter. Once one has known and clings to knowledge, this is the flaw. Thus, to know yet not know is supreme; to not know yet know is a flaw. Only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw. Since one cannot but not know, yet cannot know, only by knowing that knowledge is a flaw can the flaw eventually fade. The sage is without flaw because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw—thus he is without flaw.

**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Authority**
When the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives. Human nature inherently possesses authority—lofty, luminous, vast, and resplendent—nothing can surpass it. This is what is called great authority. People are constantly troubled by drowning in delusions, fearing life and death, and dreading gain and loss. The authority of the myriad things rides upon them, leaving no respite for anxiety throughout their lives. Though great authority exists, they do not recognize it. If one truly knows it, life and death are equal, gain and loss are level—nothing inspires fear. Then great authority shines forth before them.

Do not constrict their dwelling; do not weary their life. Only by not wearying can one avoid weariness. The greatness of human nature can embrace heaven and earth. Those who do not know this take their four limbs and nine orifices as themselves. Clinging to them without weariness, their vision does not extend beyond sight, their hearing does not extend beyond sound—they are utterly confined. Thus the teaching says: Do not constrict their dwelling. Those who know this recognize the vastness of human nature and the narrowness of their own life. They are dismayed, desiring escape but unable, knowing the ways in which weariness and longing are shaped by things. Thus the teaching says: Do not weary their life. Only the sage is neither constricted nor wearied. He lives in common with others yet dwells in the Dao, without distinction between broad or narrow, pure or defiled. Only after not wearying of life does one know that life is without weariness.

Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself; loves himself but does not esteem himself. Therefore he discards that and embraces this. Though the sage knows himself, he does not display himself; though he loves himself, he does not esteem himself, fearing that others will develop weariness and longing. If the mind of weariness and longing is not forgotten, there is still fear. Only when fear departs does great authority arrive.

**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring**
Boldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life. These two may bring benefit or harm. Who knows the reason for heaven’s aversion? Thus even the sage finds it difficult.

Boldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life—this is the constant principle of things. Yet the daring sometimes survive, and the not daring sometimes perish. The world thus relies on chance and neglects the constant principle. Heaven’s Dao is distant—how can there be such chance? Who knows the origin of its likes and dislikes? Thus even the sage takes the constant as correct and finds boldness difficult. *Liezi* says: "To divine heavenly intent and weigh profit and harm is not as good as ceasing." This is the difficulty of knowing heaven’s Dao—thus it is repeatedly expounded.

Heaven’s Dao does not contend yet excels in victory. It does not contend with things in the moment but ensures ultimate triumph. It does not speak yet excels in response. What does heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born—nothing is sought that does not respond. It does not summon yet comes of itself. The spirit’s arrival cannot be measured—how much less can it be compelled? Who summons it?

Vast and unhurried, it excels in planning. Vast and leisurely, as if without aim, yet its calculations surpass human understanding. Heaven’s net is vast and wide, sparse yet never failing. The world observes heaven through the ears and eyes, seeing only a fragment and not the whole. Those who do good and meet misfortune, or do evil and meet fortune, inevitably doubt that heaven’s net is sparse and often fails. Only by grasping its beginning and end, exhausting its transformations, can one know its vastness and breadth—though sparse, it never fails.

**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**
If the people do not fear death, how can death be used to frighten them? When governance is oppressive and punishments severe, the people have nowhere to place their hands and feet, and thus do not fear death. Even if death is used to frighten them, it is of no use.

If the people always feared death, and those who acted strangely could be seized and killed, who would dare? When the people are at ease with governance, delight in life, and fear death, then seizing and killing those who are devious and disrupt the multitude—who would dare not submit? There is always one who presides over killing. The one who presides over killing is heaven. When the world is well-governed and devious, disruptive people act wantonly, they are heaven’s outcasts. If I kill them, it is heaven killing them, not I.

To kill in place of the one who presides over killing is to take the place of the great carpenter in hewing. Those who take the place of the great carpenter in hewing rarely avoid injuring their hands. To kill when it is not heaven’s killing is to kill in place of the one who presides over killing. Taking the place of the great carpenter leads to injured hands; killing in place of the one who presides over killing leads to harm to oneself.

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
The people’s hunger is due to their superiors consuming too many taxes—thus they are hungry. The people are difficult to govern because their superiors act with excessive effort—thus they are difficult to govern. Superiors use effort to guide the people, and the people respond with effort—thus affairs multiply and become difficult to govern.

The people disregard death because they seek excessive means to sustain life—thus they disregard death. Superiors place profit and desire before the people, and the people compete to enrich their lives—thus they seek profit even unto death without weariness. Only one who does not treat life as something to be done is more worthy than one who esteems life. The extreme of esteeming life must lead to disregarding death. Only one who does not treat life as something to be done preserves life naturally.

**Chapter 76: Human Life**
When humans are alive, they are soft and weak; when dead, they are hard and strong. All things, plants and trees, when alive are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus the hard and strong are followers of death; the soft and weak are followers of life.

When the qi of harmony is present, the body is free from the affliction of hardness and strength. When the principle of the utmost is present, affairs are free from the burden of hardness and strength. Thus when armies are strong, they do not prevail. Armies that prevail through righteousness are not truly strong. Those that are strong yet unrighteous will swiftly be defeated.

When trees are strong, they are felled. Trees that reach the size of a man’s embrace are inevitably cut down. The strong and great occupy the lower position; the soft and weak occupy the higher. This is the constant principle of things. The refined is above, the coarse below—the refined must be soft and weak, the coarse must be strong and great.

**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**

The Way of Heaven—is it not like the drawing of a bow?
When the bow is drawn, the upper string slackens while the lower string tightens.
Thus, the Way of Heaven lowers the high and raises the low.
It diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.
The Way of Heaven diminishes excess to replenish deficiency,
but the way of man is not so:
it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who can take from their excess to offer to the world?
Only one who embodies the Dao.
The one who embodies the Dao enriches the myriad things yet does not refuse.
Having acted for others, they possess even more;
having given to others, they abound all the more.
None but the one who embodies the Dao can endure this.
Thus the sage acts yet does not claim,
achieves yet does not dwell.
Do they not wish to display their worth?
To act and claim, to achieve and dwell—
this is to display worth in the world.
Displaying worth in the world is to take from excess for one’s own provision.

**Chapter 78: The Soft and Weak Under Heaven**

Under heaven, nothing is softer or weaker than water,
yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it—
nothing can replace it.
The weak overcomes the strong; the soft overcomes the hard.
Under heaven, none do not know this, yet none can practice it.
Thus the sage says:
“One who bears the disgrace of the state is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;
one who bears the misfortune of the state is called the king of all under heaven.”
Upright words seem reversed.
Upright words accord with the Dao yet contradict custom,
for custom deems bearing disgrace a humiliation
and bearing misfortune a calamity.

**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Resentment**

In harmonizing great resentment, residual resentment must remain—
how can this be deemed good?
Resentment arises from delusion, and delusion emerges from human nature.
One who understands nature does not perceive delusion—
how then could resentment arise?
Yet today, not knowing to eliminate the root,
they seek to harmonize the branches.
Thus, though outwardly harmonized, inwardly it is not forgotten.
Therefore the sage holds the left tally yet does not demand from others.
One with virtue oversees the tally;
one without virtue enforces exactions.
The tally’s division into left and right serves as trust and ends strife.
The sage shares with others this same nature.
Yet people, taking delusion as constant,
rush about in the arena of contention,
unaware that nature has never been the slightest bit deluded.
Thus the sage reveals their nature to others,
enabling them to eliminate delusion and return to nature.
When delusion is exhausted and nature restored,
none fail to attain expansive self-possession,
like the right tally matching the left—
no demand is needed, and they submit of themselves.
Then, though great resentment and grievance remain,
they will melt away like ice,
knowing their root was never truly present—
what need is there for harmonization?
Those without virtue, seeking to impose uniformity upon all,
labor in vain.
*彻* means "to expropriate."

The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—
it constantly bestows upon the good.
The Way of Heaven is impartial—
only the good person aligns with it,
for the tally is without partiality.

**Chapter 80: A Small State with Few People**

A small state with few people—
Laozi lived in the declining Zhou, when culture had triumphed over custom, and so he sought to remedy it with non-action. Thus, at the end of his book, he expressed his aspiration: to obtain a small state with few people to test his teachings, though this could not be realized.

Let there be tools for ten or a hundred men, yet unused.
When people each abide in their proper place,
even those with modest talents will not seek employment in the world.
Tools for ten or a hundred men—these are talents sufficient to lead ten or a hundred men.

Let the people value life and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages, none will ride them;
though there be armor and weapons, none will display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping.
Affairs are few, and the people simple—
though knotted cords suffice.

Let them find their food sweet, their clothing fine,
their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.
Internally content, they will desire nothing beyond.
Thus, they take what they possess as beauty,
what they dwell in as joy,
and seek no more.

Neighboring states may gaze upon one another,
the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the border,
yet the people will grow old and die without ever traveling between them.
Though the things of the world are abundant,
they will make no demands upon one another—
for each is self-sufficient.

**Chapter 81: Truthful Words Are Not Fine**

Truthful words are not fine;
fine words are not truthful.
Truth is substance alone—thus it need not be fine.
Beauty is mere appearance—thus it need not be truthful.

The good do not dispute;
the disputatious are not good.
One who takes goodness as their foundation does not seek dispute;
one who takes dispute as their foundation is not necessarily good.

The wise are not broadly learned;
the broadly learned are not wise.
One who is guided by the One has no need for broad learning.
Those who accumulate learning day by day do not necessarily grasp the Dao.

The sage does not hoard:
having acted for others, they possess more;
having given to others, they have more.
The sage embraces the One and nothing else—
they accumulate nothing beyond.
Yet when they employ their abilities for others,
when they extend what they possess to others,
people’s capacities are finite, while the One is inexhaustible.
Only then is the value of the One known.

The Way of Heaven benefits and does no harm;
the Way of the sage acts and does not contend.
Power that can benefit others can also harm them;
strength sufficient to act is sufficient to contend.
Yet though capable of harm, they never harm;
though capable of contention, they never contend.
This is how Heaven and the sage surpass others
and become the foundation of all things.

These are the broad outlines of Laozi’s book
and the essence of his Dao.
Thus, at the end of the text, he restates them.

**Postscript to the *Laozi Daodejing***

In my forty-second year, I was demoted and resided in Yunzhou.
Though Yun was a small prefecture, it abounded in ancient Chan monasteries,
where wandering monks from all directions gathered.
There was Daoquan, who dwelled on Huangbo Mountain—
a descendant of Master Nangong.

The master’s conduct was lofty, his mind penetrating; delighted to follow me in study, he often discussed the Dao with me. He said to me, “What you discuss, I have already found in the Confucian books.” Daoquan replied, “This is the Buddha-dharma.” I said, “Not so. I have humbly heard that the Dao is what Confucians lack. Why insist on falsely claiming it as theirs? Yet if it truly exists among them, the world does not know it. The separation between Confucianism and Buddhism is like that between Hu and Han—they do not understand each other. How then do you know it?”

Daoquan said, “Try to explain its outline for me.” I replied, “The grandson of Confucius, Zisi, wrote the *Zhongyong*. The *Zhongyong* says: ‘Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, it is called the Center; when they arise and all hit the mark, it is called Harmony. The Center is the great root of the world; Harmony is the universal Dao. When the Center and Harmony are fully realized, Heaven and Earth take their places, and the ten thousand things are nurtured.’ Is this not the Buddha-dharma? The difference lies only in the source of the words.”

Daoquan said, “How do you explain it?” I replied, “The Sixth Patriarch said: ‘Do not think of good, do not think of evil. At this very moment, what is your original face?’ Since the time of the Sixth Patriarch, more than half of those who have awakened have done so through these words. What is called ‘not thinking of good, not thinking of evil’ is the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise. The Center is another name for Buddha-nature, and Harmony is the general term for the Six Perfections and the ten thousand practices. Fully realizing the Center and Harmony, Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things arise within them—what else could this be but the Buddha-dharma?”

Daoquan, astonished and delighted, said, “I never knew this before. From now on, I see that Confucianism and Buddhism are one Dharma.” I smiled and said, “Not so. There are indeed not two Ways in the world, but the means of governing people differ. Between ruler and minister, father and son, if there is no ritual and law, there is chaos. Knowing ritual and law but not the Dao, one is merely a vulgar Confucian, not worthy of esteem. Dwelling in the mountains, eating wild plants, drinking from streams, yet holding the supreme Dao in the heart—one may become a teacher of humans and gods. But to govern the world, only the ancient sages, who embodied the Dao in their hearts and did not destroy the law, were fit for the task.”

Daoquan bowed and said, “This is the ultimate teaching.” At that time, I was just interpreting the *Laozi*. Each time I completed a chapter, I would show it to Daoquan, who would sigh and say, “It is all the Buddha’s teaching.” I lived in Yunzhou for five years before returning north. Not long after, Daoquan passed away. Now, more than twenty years have passed. In my interpretations of the *Laozi*, I have occasionally made revisions, and there has never been a case where it did not align with the Buddha-dharma. With no one to discuss this with, I long to see Daoquan again and show him these words. Thus, I write this at the end of the *Laozi*.

When I was previously exiled to Haikang, I encountered my elder brother Zizhan in Tengzhou, and we spent over ten days together, discussing our lifelong studies. Zizhan said of my works, “Your *Poetry Commentary*, *Spring and Autumn Annals Commentary*, and *Ancient History*—all surpass what the ancients achieved. Only your interpretation of the *Laozi* seems somewhat lacking.” When I arrived in Haikang, with nothing to occupy me, I revised many of my writings. I then copied out the *Laozi* again and sent it to Zizhan. After this, I was graciously allowed to return north. Zizhan fell ill in Piling and passed away. More than ten years have now passed, and I still do not know whether this book met with his approval.

In the first year of Zhenghe (1111), in winter, I received from my nephew Mai and others a compilation of my late father’s manuscripts. Among them was one that read: “Yesterday, Ziyou sent his new interpretation of the *Laozi*. I read it without finishing the scroll, set it down, and sighed. Had this book existed in the Warring States period, there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei. Had it existed in the early Han, Confucianism and Daoism would have been one. Had it existed between the Jin and Song dynasties, Buddhism and Daoism would not have been two. I never expected, in my old age, to see such an extraordinary work—this must have been what Zizhan had in mind.” After living in Yingchuan for ten years, I have made many revisions to these four books, for the words of a sage cannot be fully understood in a single reading. Thus, whenever I gained new insight, I dared not consider my previous explanations definitive. Today, as I grow older, I believe I have reached a sufficient understanding.

I wished to discuss this again with Zizhan, but it is no longer possible. Mentioning this brings me to tears.
