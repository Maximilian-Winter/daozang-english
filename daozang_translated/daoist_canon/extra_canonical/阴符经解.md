**Pinjing Siku Quanshu**
**Zibu (Classics Section) – Fourteen: *Yinfu Jing Jie* (Commentary on the *Yinfu Classic*)**
**Daoist Category**

**The Imperial Editors humbly note:**
The *Yinfu Jing Jie* (Commentary on the *Yinfu Classic*) in one scroll, attributed in old editions to Huangdi (the Yellow Emperor), with annotations by Taigong (Duke Zhou), Fan Li, Guiguzi, Zhang Liang, Zhuge Liang, and Li Kui—six schools in total. The *Chongwen Zongmu* (Comprehensive Catalogue of the Palace Library) records a *Yinfu Jing* preface in one scroll, unattributed to any dynasty, compiled after Taigong, with six subsequent commentators on the *Yinfu Jing*, including Huiguang’s descendants, appended. This appears to be the same work, though its transmission is now lost.

Master Chao Gongwu’s *Dushu Zhi* (Record of Books Read) cites Huang Tingjian’s remark that the *Yinfu* blends military strategy with absurd attributions to sages like Zhang Liang and Zhuge Liang. Thus, this edition’s annotations are the most ancient.

The *Sui Shu Jingji Zhi* (Sui Book of Libraries) lists *Taigong Yinfu* (Duke Zhou’s *Yinfu*) in one scroll and *Zhou Shu Yinfu* (Zhou Dynasty *Yinfu*) in nine scrolls, neither attributing it to Huangdi. Only in the Tang did Li Kui claim to have obtained this text from the Tiger’s Mouth Cave on Mount Song, inscribed by Wei Daoist Fang Qian, who transmitted it to sacred mountains but failed to elucidate its meaning. Later, on Mount Li, he encountered an old woman who taught him its secrets—yet the account is fantastical and untrustworthy. Hu Yinglin’s *Bicong* (Brush Talks) argues that the *Yinfu* Su Qin studied was this very text. Though the book itself is not spurious, its attribution to Huangdi is Li Kui’s fabrication. The *Zhan Guo Ce* (Strategies of the Warring States) explicitly records Su Qin discovering the *Taigong Yinfu*, and successive dynastic bibliographies classify the *Zhou Shu Yinfu* under military strategy while the *Huangdi Yinfu* under Daoism—sufficient evidence to distinguish the two texts. Hu Yinglin’s forced connections are baseless.

As for the claim that in the early Yonghui era of the Tang, Chu Suiliang copied a hundred volumes, the *Zhengming Shiting* (Stopping Cloud Studio Calligraphy) edition of Chu’s small-character *Yinfu Jing* indeed bears this note at its end. Yet Chu’s calligraphy appears in Mi Fu’s *Shuishi Baozhang* (Treasure of Calligraphic History) and the *Xuanhe Shupu* (Book of Calligraphy of the Xuanhe Era), neither of which records it. Later collectors also make no mention of it. By the mid-Ming, it suddenly emerged from Zheng Ming’s family in stone form—its authenticity remains uncertain. How then could it serve as proof of the text’s authenticity?

The editors retain this work despite its late composition because it contains profound insights, and many scholars have annotated it. The commentary includes references to a figure called "Yin Yu" (Emperor Yin), whose identity is unknown. The preface at the scroll’s beginning is unsigned and undated, containing phrases like *"leaking the celestial mechanism"* and *"Stupid Yu, wise Yu"*—crude Daoist jargon unworthy of serious inquiry. Only Chao Gongwu’s *Dushu Zhi* preserves Li Kui’s annotations, now missing from this edition, suggesting either scribal corruption or that this is not Li Kui’s original text.

**Yinfu Jing Kaoyi (Investigation of the *Yinfu Classic*)**
**Daoist Category**

**The Imperial Editors humbly note:**
The *Yinfu Jing Kaoyi* (Investigation of the *Yinfu Classic*) in one scroll, compiled by Song-era Zhu Xi (Master Zhu). Huang Tingjian held that the *Yinfu Jing* originated with Tang-era Li Kui, and Zhu Xi’s *Yulu* (Conversations) concurs. Yet Zhu Xi acknowledged that its profound passages could not have been authored by one unversed in the Dao. He thus collated the text, identifying the first 114 characters—*"From the time when the foolish Yu became the sage Yu"*—as the core scripture, based on the annotations of Chu Suiliang and Zhang [unclear].

The *Yulu* records Zhu Xi’s discussion with Lu Qiu Ci Meng, who praised the *Yinfu Jing*’s expression of *"the natural Dao in stillness."* Zhu Xi declared Lu’s insight surpassed even the *Six Classics*, while Yang Daofu doubted the passage existed in the original text. Yang likely consulted the *Lishan Laomu* (Old Mother of Mount Li) edition, where the final lines read *"I, with the times and things, refine my wisdom"*—leading him to question whether the passage appeared in the original *Yinfu*.

The text includes an appendix by Huang Ruijie, whose citations are extensive. The *Jian’an Fu Zhi* (Gazetteer of Jian’an Prefecture) records Ruijie (style name Guanle, native of Anfu), who passed the county-level exams and served as county magistrate of Taihe before abandoning office in the late Yuan. He compiled and annotated works like the *Taiji Tu* (Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate), *Tongshu* (Comprehensive Book), *Xixing* (Western Inscription), *Yixue Qimeng* (Awakening to the Study of the *Yijing*), *Jiali Lülü Jingyi* (Essence of Rites and Music), and *Huangji Jingshi* (Scripture of the Sovereign’s Polity), among others—including, presumably, the *Cansong Qi* (Paramount Concordance) and *Shenxing* (Divine Transformation). The gazetteer omits these due to their Daoist associations. (Recorded in the 46th year of Qianlong, October, after reverent collation and submission.)

**Pinning the Four Treasures: Commentary on the *Yin Fu Jing***

**Preface to the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing* (The Sovereign’s *Yin Fu* with Commentary)**

What is called *ming* is *xing* (性). *Xing* is capable of *ming* (命), yet its essence remains unfathomable; thus the Sage reveres it as the *Tianming* (天命)—fooling the common man while enlightening the Sage. Hence it is called the *Tianji* (天机), stretched yet never exhausted, slackened yet never stagnant. Behold the *Yin Fu*: its transformations lie in the hands; its life and death are at its command. Therefore the Sage conceals it in the heart, to refine and nurture the gathering and scattering of the cosmos beneath heaven, unseen in its traces—this is the *Tianji*.

Thus the Yellow Emperor attained it and ascended to rule the world; Tang and Wu gained it and became kings; the Five Hegemons secured it and united the feudal lords. Yet, *to be the subject and master the Way is difficult*—not to be taken lightly. The Duke of Zhou was ninety before he met his fate; it was not that he did not encounter the *Yin Fu*, but rather that he discerned his master’s nature. If a wise man were to wield it, even carving stone as sovereign or wood as ruler, he could still enjoy the world.

If the subject exhausts his virtue while the master grows fearful, possessing the *Yin Fu* is indeed difficult! Alas, without a virtuous ruler, the righteous scholar dies alone, refusing to serve. Better to scatter one’s resolve in mountain caves, nourishing life while awaiting the rise of the worthy—those who see Confucius as unlucky and Qin Yi as fortunate are mistaken. The Way lies in establishing the cosmos; how can one idle the heart and stoop to petty schemes?

A true man would scorn such folly. Alas, later generations’ heroes and sages, discerning and applying it, saw Rang Li flourish through weighty resolve while Wen Zhong perished from recklessness. Did they not fear squandering the *Tianji*? The Sage hides such truths in sacred peaks, passing them to kindred spirits, lest the unworthy seize and misuse them. The first chapter reveals the Dao of observing Heaven, seizing its patterns, and exhausting its workings.

The Duke of Zhou said: Heaven has five thieves (*Wu Ze* 五賊)—one who steals *ming* (命), one who steals *wu* (物), one who steals *shi* (時), one who steals *gong* (功), and one who steals *shen* (神).
- Stealing *ming* with one act consumes the world’s use of it for flavor.
- Stealing *wu* with one act hastens the world’s use of it for profit.
- Stealing *shi* with one act betrays the world’s trust in it for reversals.
- Stealing *gong* with one act sows resentment where the world expects gratitude.
- Stealing *shen* with one act distorts the world’s perception of it as small or great.

Yu Ji said: Of Heaven’s five thieves, none is more destructive than stealing *shen*. One takes the small to destroy the great—Heaven and Earth cannot thwart this, let alone man!

Guan Yu remarked: The Yellow Emperor seized the thief of *ming*, ascending in broad daylight. The Shang and Zhou dynasties seized the thief of *shen*, using the small to vanquish the great. Guan Zhong seized the thief of *shi*, uniting the feudal lords in nine alliances. Fan Li seized the thief of *wu*, conquering the South and becoming hegemon. Zhang Liang seized the thief of *gong*, defeating the mighty Chu.

The five thieves lie within the heart, their application extending to Heaven. The cosmos is at one’s command, and myriad transformations arise from the body. The Duke of Zhou said: The Sage calls them five thieves; the world names them five *De* (德). Man feeds on the five flavors and lives; man feeds on the five flavors and dies. Yet none abandon them without grievance—this is the nature of the heart’s craving.

Yu Ji said: Stealing *ming* can lead to eternal life. The Yellow Emperor, when a maiden’s *jing* (精) and *qi* (氣) moved him, also saw the world’s things thus. Even winter grasses, covered and left untouched, do not die—expose them, and they wither. Plants and trees, rooted in nature, endure such trials; how much more so man, the most refined of all things, whose essence is that of a maiden’s *jing* and the timing of *shi*!

Bo Changzi said: This is the accumulation of fire to burn the Five Toxins (五毒)—the Five Toxins are the Five Flavors. Exhausting the Five Flavors can lead to eternal life.

Guan Yu remarked: Man lives and dies through the Five Flavors. Each flavor has its master—harmonizing with it brings life; opposing it brings destruction. Prolonged indulgence accumulates *qi*, steeping and corrupting the five *zang* organs until they perish. Thus later generations cannot fulfill their natural lifespan—it is because of their excessive craving for life!

Therefore, the Supreme Dao is serene, nurturing *taixi* (胎息) without indulgence. The arts of immortals and transcendent beings, though numerous, center on embracing unity and guarding the middle. The techniques of maidenly cultivation, though many, focus on returning *jing* (精) and adopting *qi*. The arts of elixirs, though countless, hinge on *shen shui* (神水) and the *Huaxi* (華池). The arts of governance, though myriad, depend on purity and self-transformation. The arts of warfare, though varied, rest on *qizheng* (奇正) and strategic maneuvering. These five arts—when rolled up and hidden in the heart, when applied to the spirit, when spread across Heaven, when given to Earth—can make the cosmos rise and fall in an instant, all at man’s command.

The Yellow Emperor attained them and first established the Three Palaces (三宮), then pacified the myriad states. The Cauldron of Destiny (鼎) was completed, and he tamed the Dragon, ascending to Heaven.

Heaven’s nature is man’s nature; man’s heart is the *Tianji*. Establishing Heaven’s Dao determines man’s fate.

Yu Ji said: This is the Dao of establishing Heaven and determining man—it lies in the five thieves. When Heaven’s killing intent is unleashed, dragons and serpents rise. When man’s killing intent is unleashed, Heaven and Earth overturn.

Fan Yu said: In ancient times, Yi Yin served the Shang and released Heaven’s killing intent. The command to conquer Xia was fulfilled, and the response was swift—thus the eastern expedition against the Western Barbarians and the southern against the Northern Di. The Duke of Zhou said: Three years without tilling the fields brought great drought; ten years without digging wells caused the earth to collapse, killing tens of thousands. Violent winds and storms arose.

Yu Ji said: According to the records, when Chu’s armies slaughtered tens of thousands of Han soldiers, the sun vanished and day turned to night—Heaven and Earth seemed to overturn. The killing intent of Heaven and man converged, giving rise to myriad changes and fixed foundations.

Zhang Liang said: From this single act of trust, all trust is born—thus the foundation of myriad changes is established.

Guan Yu said: Within the heart’s desires, there is no outward expression—this is called *Qi* (启). External evils do not penetrate—this is called *Bi* (闭). *Qi* is the thief’s intent, hard to discern like darkness, unmoving like a mountain. The thief’s cunning nature makes men unguarded, allowing them to be glimpsed.

The evils of the nine orifices (九窍) lie in the three *Yao* (要)—movement and stillness can be controlled.**

The Master Taigong said: The three *Yao* (critical points) are the ears, eyes, and mouth. The ears can be pierced and sealed, the eyes can be bored through, and the mouth can be made sharp yet speechless. When raising armies and mobilizing the masses, ten thousand soldiers will not dare to speak out. Its brilliance lies in whether one can move or still these three *Yao*.

The strategist said: Two leaves covering the eyes cannot hide Mount Tai; a single bean blocking the ears cannot drown out thunder. A single peppercorn brushing the tongue cannot silence speech. If all nine orifices are filled with evil, they are insufficient to discern changes in opportunity. What matters lies in these three: spirit, heart, and will. When opportunity moves, the spirit follows it. When opportunity is about to manifest, the heart plans for it. When opportunity arises and action is taken, the will decides it.

When opportunity moves, it aligns with the Yang—even the Five Mountains cannot contain its corners, and the Four Seas cannot confine its boundaries. When opportunity is still, it aligns with the Yin—even wise men cannot manipulate its splendor, and deep wisdom cannot fathom its schemes. Heaven and Earth cannot alter its timing, let alone man.

Fire arises from wood; when it ignites, it consumes the wood. Treachery arises within the state; when it flourishes, the state perishes. Wood hides fire within it—fire begins in formlessness. The state hides treachery within it—treachery begins in no visible shape. Only the most sagely cannot cultivate self-restraint to prevent the fire of treachery from igniting. Thus, the state will have no military disasters nor calamities of misfortune.

With Ji Zi fleeing and bound in deerskin, Shangrong Yu imprisoned and Shao Shu weeping in the middle section—this is the Way of Heaven’s creation and destruction.

Zhang Liang said: Opportunity arises from the heart, like Heaven’s creation and destruction. Those who live believe they have secured their fate; those who die believe they have met their end.

Heaven and Earth, along with all things, are thieves—stealing from all things through decay and old age. All things and man’s adornments are thieves—stealing from man through arrogance and excess. Man and the highest tools of all things are thieves—stealing from all things through ruin and destruction. All this unfolds naturally, each thief fulfilling its role, the Three Powers in harmony.

Thus it is said: Eat in season, and the hundred limbs function harmoniously. Act at the right moment, and all transformations are secure.

The Master Guigu said: Do not let future rulers amass treasures and hoard gold and silk. If they can discard them, even emptying rivers and filling seas would be insufficient. Food is what sustains the hundred limbs—lose its season, and the limbs are harmed. Action is what secures all things—lose its opportunity, and all things are harmed. Thus it is said: The arrival of the right moment allows no pause, not even the blink of an eye. Act too early, and it is excessive; act too late, and it fails. Therefore, the virtuous guard the moment, while the unworthy cling to fate.

Men know the sagely’s sagacity but not the source of their sagacity.

The strategist said: All men possess the Way, yet not all value the foolishness of the sage. Once his sagacity is revealed, his foolishness is examined, and his sagacity is seen again. Thus the classics say: If one relies solely on keen insight, matters will not succeed. If one relies solely on obscurity, all actions will fail. Balance clarity and obscurity—then the masses will follow. Yi Yin was a tavern keeper, Taigong a butcher, Guan Zhong a leatherworker, and Bai Li a soup vendor. In times of decline and chaos, men deemed them unremarkable. Yet when they encountered Tang, Wen, Huan, or Mu, their Way flourished, their sagacity shone, and their deeds moved Heaven and Earth. Men then called them supremely sagely.

The sun and moon have their cycles; great and small have their limits. From these arise sagely deeds and divine brilliance.

The Master Guigu said: Future generations will ponder this and realize that Heaven and Earth are not to be prized above man.

The strategist said: In a year of 365 days, the days have their number, the months their sequence, and the intercalary months their fixed divisions—all drawing from the essence of Heaven and Earth. Even without sagely deeds or divine brilliance, this essence exists. Even without the sun and moon, this essence exists. Thus, success does not depend on Heaven and Earth, nor does failure blame Yin and Yang.

Its thievery of opportunity—none under Heaven can see or know it. The noble who grasps it secures his life; the petty man who grasps it risks his fate.

Zhuang Liang said: Was not Master Taigong more virtuous than Sun Wu, Han Fei, and Bai Qi? Yet the noble and petty differ in their application. The four worthies’ courage reached the point of death—yet they failed to serve their masters and were killed.

The strategist said: The master of the season, Ling Yi, was unseen by all under Heaven, yet his opportunity was known. The source of Ling Yi’s rise was unseen, yet the opportunity for the rise of a hegemon or king was known. The source of their rise was unseen. The noble who seizes the opportunity aligns with Heaven and follows man, thus securing his life. The petty man who seizes the opportunity indulges in warfare and reckless violence, thus risking his fate.

The *Classic of Changes* says: The noble acts when he discerns the opportunity, not waiting until the day is complete. It also says: To know the opportunity is divine. Opportunity is easy to see but hard to know—near yet distant.

**Lower Section:**

The blind excel in hearing; the deaf excel in sight. If one extreme is abandoned, its source is cut off. If tenfold armies are used, threefold reversals of day and night will suffice. If a hundredfold armies are used, ten thousandfold reversals of day and night will suffice.

Yin said: Deep contemplation exhausts the subtle.

Zhang Liang said: Future generations will ponder this—if the ears and eyes are severed from their source, their utility is lost.

The strategist said: Man’s ears and eyes are divided by the heart and perfected by the spirit. If the heart is divided, opportunity lacks spirit. If the spirit is perfected, opportunity lacks subtlety. Thus, Shimiang was blinded yet his ears sharpened; Lijiu’s ears were sealed yet his eyes brightened. If one extreme is utilized and the other abandoned, and the heart is employed to command armies, then all actions will succeed. Retreat and reflect three times—once at dawn, once at dusk—then act. If opportunity is seized and action taken, all will succeed.

Taigong said: When the eyes move, the heart responds. If what is seen is favorable, act. If not, stop. The heart is born from things and dies from things; opportunity lies in the eyes.

The strategist said: For all under Heaven, nothing is closer to opportunity than the heart and eyes. The heart can ignite opportunity; the eyes can perceive it. When Qin Shihuang made his eastern expedition, he saw the opportunity in Jianli. When Xiang Yu saw the opportunity, he told Xiang Liang: “That man can be taken and replaced.” When the Jin army reached the Huai River and the Battle of Fei, Fu Jian saw the opportunity and told Fu Rong: “They are a formidable enemy—why are there so few?” Thus, it is known: the heart’s life and death lie in things, and the eyes reveal the opportunity of success and failure.

Heaven, though without favor, gives rise to great kindness. Sudden thunder and violent winds—all creatures tremble in response.

The Master said: *"Ah, how bustling it is!"*
The Duke replied: *"Be wary and cautious to invite blessings."*

The Strategist said: *"Heaven’s heart has no favor, yet all things have hearts that return gratitude to Heaven."*

Laozi said: *"Heaven and Earth are without virtue, treating all things as grass-dogs. The Sage is without virtue, treating the people as grass-dogs. Thus, he acts without expecting return, gives life without claiming credit. Even when sudden thunder and violent winds strike, their power reaches far and near, and all creatures tremble in fear, yet they still revere Heaven. Heaven has no coercion, yet all creatures fear it. All things, though fearing, return that fear to Heaven. The Sage, when bestowing rewards, shows no favor to those who have merited them; when punishing, no coercion to those who have erred. Thus, rewards and punishments are established from above, while awe and grace flow downward.*

The utmost joy is in nature’s abundance; the utmost stillness is in nature’s restraint. The Master said: *"Here lies the essence of opportunity!"*

The Strategist said: *"Joy leads to extravagance; stillness leads to integrity. Abundance dulls the spirit; restraint clarifies it. The spirit is the fountain of wisdom. When the spirit is clear, wisdom shines. Wisdom is the repository of the heart. When wisdom is balanced, the heart is even. None can discern truth in flowing water, but all see it in still water—because it is clear and level. When the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil, one can perceive the true nature of things. The Sage does not indulge in utmost joy nor settle in utmost stillness, but dwells in the harmony of spirit and tranquility—this is called *guarding the Middle*. Thus, worldly gains cannot seduce him, music and color cannot disrupt him, eloquent speakers cannot persuade him, the wise cannot move him, nor the brave intimidate him. He foresees calamity beyond the mountain passes and anticipates disaster in the darkest depths. Heaven itself cannot thwart him—how much less the deceptive ways of war!"*

*"Heaven’s utmost selfishness is its utmost impartiality."*

Emperor said: *"Governance reaches its peak in subtlety."*
The Master said: *"Its opportunity is so refined that even if no commands are given, the world follows it without knowing why—or defying it."*

The Strategist said: *"The Way of Heaven subtly completes all things, not neglecting even the gnarled *chun* tree or the lowly *yuan* bird—great and small, long and short, each finds its place. This is its utmost selfishness. Yet it sends rain, dispatches thunder and lightning, frost and hail, balancing life and death with utmost impartiality. The Sage follows Heaven, models Earth, and nurtures the people—this is his utmost selfishness. He enforces just decrees and applies laws with precision—this is his utmost impartiality."*

Sun Wu said: *"Treat soldiers as beloved children—you can die together. Treat them as infants—you can send them into deep ravines."* To love without authority is like indulging a spoiled child. Thus, one governs with ritual and disciplines with force.

*"The principle governing creatures lies in *qi*."*

The Duke said: *"Does it mean the small dominate the great?"*
Emperor said: *"The *qi* of things is Heaven’s mechanism."*

The Strategist said: *"The *qi* of the tortoise makes it eat serpents; the *qi* of the falcon strikes hares; the *qi* of the yellow-bellied weasel devours tigers; the *qi* of flying squirrels repels monkeys; the *qi* of toads and leeches drains fish; the *qi* of wolves terrifies deer; the *qi* of cranes intimidates hawks. Sweetness and softness overcome gold; the *qi* of the *heche* chariot is inexhaustible; jade and雄黄 transform iron; there are woods that do not burn and stones that float. Even creatures and objects, when attuned to their *qi*, can let the small overcome the great. How much more so for the Sage, who harnesses *qi* and cannot fail to pacify the world and master the cosmos!"*

*"The living are the root of the dead; the dead are the root of the living. Gratitude arises from harm; harm arises from gratitude."*

The Duke said: *"Those who diminish themselves are loved; those who aggrandize themselves are slighted."*

The Strategist said: *"To seek life, one must first embrace death, then life follows. To master death, one must first experience life, then death comes. The *Lüguanzi* says: 'Without death, there is no life; without destruction, there is no completion.' Sun Wu said: 'Cast them into certain death, and they will live. Drive them to despair, and they will survive.' Wu Qi said: 'The battlefield is a place of corpses. To die is to live; to hope to live is to die.' Gratitude is the source of harm; harm is the source of gratitude. Wu Zixu took vengeance on Yue for the sake of gratitude, yet it bred harm. The Zhou overthrew the Shang through harm, yet it gave rise to gratitude. Life and death, gratitude and harm—opposite yet intertwined."*

*"The foolish see Heaven and Earth’s patterns as omens of chaos; the Sage sees the patterns of things and times as omens of order."*

The Duke said: *"Observe the timing of birds and beasts, scrutinize the changes of all things."*

The Strategist said: *"When the *jing* star appears, yellow dragons descend; phoenixes soar; sweet springs emerge; fine grains grow; the rivers overflow without spilling, the seas surge without waves; the sun and moon are eclipsed; the five stars stray from their courses; the four seasons overlap; day turns to night, night to day; mountains crumble, rivers dry; winter thunder and summer frost strike. The foolish see these as Heaven and Earth’s chaotic patterns. The Sage, with tranquil rule, spreads light to the four quarters, fulfills virtuous deeds, and harmonizes the nine clans and six offices. The three affairs proceed without mutual obstruction; the hundred grains flourish; the myriad people prosper. The ruler is depraved, ministers corrupt; laws are inconsistent, taxes oppressive, governance harsh—above and below are in disarray. Noble and humble alike indulge in wine, music, towering halls, and ornate walls. The people flee, longing for chaos, blaming the ruler above. I see these as the patterns of things and times—omens of order and chaos."*

*"Men are foolish by nature; the Sage is not. The Sage anticipates the extraordinary; I do not."*

The Strategist said: *"The hearts of the wise are profound and subtle, beyond measure. The tracks of Yu the Great were observed, yet his responses to change were boundless. His wisdom turned with opportunity, inexhaustible. How could one guess his intentions by his traces? That would be true foolishness. Thus it is said: 'Plunge into water or fire, and you court annihilation.'"*

The Master said: *"To govern men is to court their death; to lead an army is to court defeat. If there is no death, there is no not-dying. If there is no life, there is no not-living. Thus, one who understands death and life ensures the nation’s security."*

*"The Way of Nature is stillness; thus Heaven and Earth and all things are born."*

Emperor said: *"The utmost stillness knows not how things are born."*

*"The Way of Heaven and Earth is gradual; thus yin and yang prevail."*

The Master said: *"The Way of Heaven and Earth is subtle and pushes toward dominance. Yin and yang interact, and their transformations follow naturally."*

The Master said: *"Yin and yang interact,激至变化在于目—thus the Sage knows the Way of Nature cannot be defied and follows it accordingly."*

The Duke said: *"The noble see it as Nature; the wise see it as artifice; the foolish see it as transformation."*

Emperor said: *"To know the Way of Nature, all things cannot defy it. Thus, one acts in accordance with it."*

*"The utmost stillness transcends the reach of calendars and measurements."*

The Master said: *"Observe the timing of birds and beasts, scrutinize the changes of all things. Birds and beasts embody utmost stillness, beyond the grasp of calendars and measurements. Follow their mechanisms."*

*"Thus arise wondrous instruments, generating all phenomena. The Eight Trigrams, the Heavenly Stems, and Earthly Branches conceal divine mechanisms."*

The Master said: *"The six *ji* stems are Heaven’s repository—capable of concealment."*

*"The arts of yin and yang’s dominance are clearly manifested in symbols."*

Bright said: *"Wondrous instruments are the Sage’s wisdom. Heaven displays symbols; the Sage follows them. By aligning the Heavenly Stems, drawing the Eight Trigrams, consulting the *shi* and tortoise shells, and examining calendars and measurements, the divine intent and the principles of yin and yang are clearly revealed in symbols, exhaustively."*

Bright said: *"The Eight Trigrams’ symbols are extended in application; the sixty Heavenly Stems cycle in use. The divine emerges and withdraws—all is illuminated in unity."*

The Master said: *"All things and all phenomena originate from the heart. The fusion of yin and yang’s arts, the numbers of sun and moon—all are clearly manifest in the human heart. Guangchengzi said: 'The Heavenly Stems combine the nine numbers of yang. The trigrams emerge as the laws of military deployment. Military deployment moves with rhythmic order, aligning with the divine, responding to the times—this is the Way of the divine mechanism.'"*

**The Exegesis of the *Yin Fu Jing***

「昭昭乎进乎象矣
　　Bright said: *"The wondrous instrument is the sagely wisdom—Heaven displays symbols, and the sage follows them. Pushing forward the Heavenly Stems, delineating the Eight Trigrams, divining with *shi* and tortoise shells, consulting calendars and measurements—then the divine intent is revealed, and the principles of yin and yang are made manifest in symbols, exhaustively."*

　　Bright said: *"The symbols of the Eight Trigrams are extended in their application; the sixty Heavenly Stems cycle in their use. The divine emerges and withdraws—all is illuminated in unity."*

　　The Master said: *"All things and all phenomena arise from the heart. The fusion of yin and yang’s arts, the numbers of sun and moon—all are clearly manifest in the human heart. Guangchengzi declared: 'The Heavenly Stems combine the nine numbers of yang. The Trigrams manifest as the laws of military deployment. Military deployment moves with rhythmic order, aligning with the divine, responding to the times—this is the Dao of the divine mechanism.'"」
