**Preface to *The Pass-Key Text***

The Great Dao of Cultivating Truth seizes yin and yang, usurps the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, completes one’s nature and destiny, and transcends birth and death—this is the grand endeavor of ascending from the mundane to the sacred, of becoming an immortal and patriarch. It is no trifling matter of fleeting worldly illusions, like morning frost or floating bubbles, ephemeral and insubstantial.

Yet how is it that Daoists under heaven, peering through narrow tubes and measuring with gourd ladles, mistake the great for the small and the small for the great, prizing the false while neglecting the true? The Dao is not far from man, yet man, in pursuing the Dao, distances himself from it. Thus the ancients said: "Those who study the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, but those who attain it are as rare as unicorn horns." I say: "Today, those who study the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, but those who *hear* it are as rare as unicorn horns."

Why do I say this? In ancient times, many heard the Dao, but few attained it; today, many study the Dao, but few hear it. The number of those studying the Dao today is double that of ancient times, yet the number who hear it is fewer than those who attained it in the past. Thus, today, those who study the Dao are as ox hairs, while those who hear it are as unicorn horns.

Tracing the cause, it is because students are riddled with imbalances and filled with perverse qi, making it impossible to move the hearts of teachers and friends. Thus, they waste years in vain toil, their aspirations unfulfilled. Therefore, I have taken all that I received from my teachers and poured it into works such as *Elucidating the True*, *Essentials of the Assembly*, *Direct Pointers*, *Meeting the Mind*, *Original Purport*, *Compass of the Dao*, *Awakening to the Dao*, and *Dispelling Doubts*, hoping to find kindred spirits—this alone would satisfy my wish.

Yet I still fear that students, abandoning what is near to seek what is far, will neglect their own affairs while vainly coveting those of others. Thus, I have composed *The Pass-Key Text* to serve as a torch for learners. First, strive to become a healthy person free of afflictions; ascend from humility to loftiness, progress from the near to the distant. Then, perhaps, you may encounter an enlightened teacher, meet a true friend, and hear the Great Dao.

Though the sections in this book are small, the matters they address are of great consequence; though the language is unrefined, the benefits to the reader are profound. Though called a "pass-key," the work of cultivating nature and destiny begins with no other step. Do not dismiss it because of its humble style and plain words.

As for those of superior wisdom and noble insight, who naturally walk the broad path, upon meeting an enlightened teacher, they will have no difficulty attaining the truth. For them, the function of *The Pass-Key* is unnecessary.

**The Pass of Sensual Desire**

Master Lü said:
*"A maiden fair at sixteen, her body soft as curds,
Yet in her waist a sword hangs, slaying foolish men.
Though no heads roll before your eyes,
In secret she drains your marrow dry."*

Master Qiu said:
*"In true cultivation, be ever vigilant,
Sweep away lust, return to the Real."*
And again:
*"Sever the silken bonds to dry the golden sea,
Unlock the jade lock to escape the cage."*

These are the great compassion and mercy of the patriarchs, teaching people to abandon sensual desire and tread the path of life.

Sensual desire is the foremost life-threatening pass in human existence—most vile, most venomous.

How do we know it is the pass that claims life? When one beholds beauty, the soul scatters, the spirit flees, and lustful thoughts arise. The moment lust stirs, desire’s fire ignites, qi scatters, and spirit drifts. Though bodies may not yet unite, the primordial essence has already leaked in secret; nature is obscured, life is shaken. How much worse for those who indulge day and night in the realm of desire, mistaking suffering for joy and harm for pleasure? One day, the oil will dry, the lamp will gutter, the marrow will deplete, and the person will perish—even if one wished not to die, how could it be avoided?

Thus, for those who cultivate the Dao, guarding against sensual desire is the first step. Yet sensual desire is most difficult to eradicate and hardest to defend against. Since time immemorial, people have been born through the path of desire and died through the path of desire—birth after birth, death after death, mostly at the hands of the demon of lust. This demon arises in two ways: from heaven and from man.

That which arises from heaven is the deep-rooted dust of past kalpas, stirring unconsciously, arising in moments of thoughtlessness. That which arises from man is the stirring of passion at the sight of beauty, the spirit racing at the encounter of circumstance. How many heroes and stalwarts of past and present have surmounted countless perils and trials, only to be halted at the pass of the lust demon? The four elements are powerless; they cannot struggle free. Unless one is a man of iron will, a resolute warrior, one cannot cast it aside, cannot let it go.

Those who cultivate the Dao must recognize that the lust demon is the King of Hell come to claim your life. It must be eradicated with all one’s might. Even if she were as beautiful as Xi Shi or as alluring as Yang Guifei, regard her as a stinking skin-bag. See without stirring, gaze without wavering, remain unmoved and unclouded—encounter as though not encountering, see as though not seeing. Guard at every moment, reflect at every instant, allowing not even a hair’s breadth of desire to arise in the heart. Like a farmer tending his field, weed as they sprout. Uproot the deep roots entirely, lest they regrow another day.

How does one know when the root of lust is truly eradicated? When, upon encountering beauty, one does not perceive it as beautiful; when seeing a woman, one does not recognize her as a woman. If one still perceives beauty or recognizes a woman as such, even if one can forcibly restrain desire in the moment, the deep roots remain unuprooted, and over time, they may sprout anew.

Many in the world who cling to emptiness and guard stillness boast before others of having extinguished desire, yet in dreams, they leak essence, powerless to control it. They deceive themselves and others, swallowing the food of delusion. They do not realize that though they do not generate desire, desire still lurks within. How can one easily sever what harbors lustful thoughts? It is because the roots of dust remain unexhausted.

Though it is not easy to uproot, one must apply fierce effort and unyielding resolve, putting in the work of death. What cannot be eradicated must be forcibly eradicated; what cannot be cast off must be forcibly cast off. With deep and prolonged effort, there will come a time when it is truly gone. Once the root of lust is fully uprooted, the physical body becomes firm, and the Dharma-body is easily cultivated. The remaining passes will all be easily surmounted. But if the root of lust is not fully eradicated, and this pass remains uncrossed, then none of the other passes can be traversed.

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao: swiftly break through the pass of sensual desire. Fear lust as you would a tiger, guard against desire as you would a scorpion. Externally, forget emotion in the face of circumstances; internally, let no desire arise. Guard against danger, contemplate peril, preserve your spirit—then there is hope for attaining the Dao.

This is not only for those who leave the household; even those who remain in the world, fulfilling their familial duties and continuing their lineage, should practice restraint in sensual desire. By moderating lust, essence is fortified, qi is abundant, and the postnatal is replenished—sufficient to ward off illness and prolong life, and even to bear many descendants. The Yellow Emperor and King Wen had many children, all due to their restraint in desire. Whether in the household or beyond it, all must place the guarding against sensual desire as the foremost step. Otherwise, if the heart of lust is not fully extinguished, vainly seeking the Dao will be difficult indeed.

**The Pass of Attachment and Love**

*Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Though man’s life may span a hundred years,
Fate’s twists—early death, long life, poverty, or success—none can foresee.
Yesterday, he rode through the streets;
Today, his corpse lies in the coffin.
Wealth and wife, abandoned—no longer his;
Karma follows, impossible to deceive.
The great elixir, if not sought, is a missed chance;
To encounter it and not refine it is folly."*

And again:
*"To cultivate the Dao, one must be fierce and resolute,
A heart of steel, unyielding as iron.
Even with wives and children,
What difference is there from others?"*

These teachings urge people to see through worldly attachments and love, and to urgently cultivate nature and life.

In this world, all things are illusory—only nature and life are real. Yet the world clings to the illusory as real, casting aside the truth of nature and life. Entangled in love and attachment, they toil for clothing and food. A hundred worries afflict the heart, ten thousand affairs weary the body. Day and night, they rush about, scheming and plotting, harming others for personal gain, insatiable in greed. They venture into places of fire and water, into the lairs of tigers and wolves, into miasmic lands—heedless of life and death, careless of survival or ruin. They toil endlessly, making long-term plans for their children, only to find their spirit depleted, their qi and blood weakened. Grave illness befalls them, and they lie bedridden, unable to rise.

Though one may have filial sons and worthy grandsons, they cannot bear suffering in one’s stead; though one may have charming wives and beloved concubines, they cannot endure hardship in one’s place. All the affection of a lifetime avails nothing at this moment. With the last breath gone, the spirit never returns. Who then is that other, and who am I? Reflecting on this, what real benefit has all one’s lifelong affection brought? Since it brings no real benefit, one knows that affection is the greatest suffering of human life—one must see through it early. To see through it, one must first quietly examine the harms and benefits of affection. Examine it again and again, and one will find that within sweetness lies bitterness, within kindness lies harm. Truly knowing that affection is an illusory thing, and realizing that affection is but trouble, one naturally will not set foot in the mire or make one’s home in the fire pit. One will have one’s own resolve within, and will no longer be entangled by affection.

If one can truly taste the bitterness within affection, and desires to leave the world, one will achieve great liberation and be free to cultivate nature and life without restraint. Even if one remains in the world, one will be clear and bright, responding to things as they come, without harm or loss. For once one awakens to the suffering of affection, one can play one’s part in the drama, free and self-directed, untouched by the harm of affection.

Yet since father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife are all gathered in the same play, a father must play the part of a father, a son must play the part of a son, an elder brother must play the part of an elder brother, a younger brother must play the part of a younger brother, a husband must play the part of a husband, and a wife must play the part of a wife. One should know that each fulfills their proper role—this is simply what one’s own duty requires. But one must understand in one’s heart that this is but playing a part in the drama, that all are partners in this play, and that one should proceed in an orderly way to bring this play to a proper conclusion, so that all may settle their affairs. In this way, one neither harms human relationships nor obscures one’s original nature. Thus one may be "leaving home while at home," or "leaving the dust while in the dust," with much advantage and joy.

In the past, Master Pang, Great Master Fu, Immortal Ge, Perfected Xu, Heavenly Master Zhang, and the Three Mao Perfected Ones all achieved great success in the Dao while remaining at home. Those who remain in the household should be like this.

As for those who leave home, apart from serving parents, supporting life, and attending to death, all other affections must be severed at once, like cutting a rope in two, with no lingering attachment. Even the slightest attachment will ruin the great work. Not only will one be unable to cultivate the Dao, but one will also be unable to understand it. It is precisely because the two words "affection" stir up the heart. With affection stirring the heart, one cannot see through affection. If one cannot see through affection, one will be blocked at the pass of affection—how then can one advance on the path?

I urge those who are truly devoted to learning the Dao to swiftly break through the pass of affection, free from entanglements, unburdened and at ease, and devote themselves wholeheartedly to the Dao. Only then will they make progress. Otherwise, if one cannot let go of affection, constantly keeping it in mind, it will be difficult to understand the Dao, no matter how one deludes oneself.

**The Pass of Glory and Honor**

The *Daodejing* says: "Though one may offer a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao." The Most Sage said: "Wealth and honor are what people desire. If they are not obtained by proper means, one should not accept them." *Wuzhen pian* says: "If one does not seek the great Dao to escape delusion, even with great talent, how can one be a true person? A hundred years of life flash by like a spark from stone, a lifetime’s existence floats like a bubble on water. Only chasing after rank and profit, seeking glory and display, one neglects one’s appearance, which withers and dries in secret. I ask you: though one may pile up gold like Mount Tai, can impermanence be bought off to avoid its coming?"

Master Qiu said: "A peaceful heart does not speak of the three ducal ranks; a settled nature is stronger than a walled city of ten *li*." All these teach that one should value the Dao and righteousness, and not covet glory and honor.

Now, glory and honor may be of two kinds: the glory and honor of Heavenly rank, and the glory and honor of human rank. Heavenly rank consists of virtue, the Dao, benevolence, and righteousness; human rank consists of official position, salary, and fame. Those who seek human rank study diligently, enduring ten years of cold windows, working day and night, neglecting sleep and meals. They do not know how much thought they expend, how much spirit they consume, before they finally obtain an official position. Yet even when they obtain it, its size is uncertain. Some pass the provincial examination but fail the metropolitan; some pass the metropolitan but fail the palace examination; some pass the palace examination but cannot obtain an official post; some obtain a post but cannot ensure its stability or survival. Such hardship, such dissipation of spirit, such depletion of qi and blood—exchanging the real for the illusory, pursuing this empty fame—where is the glory, where is the honor?

Moreover, some fall ill with consumption before obtaining their rank, coughing up phlegm and gasping for breath, barely able to move, their very lives in danger—how lamentable and pitiable! What they call glory and honor is merely riding in a sedan chair, mounting a horse, wearing silk and satin, and eating lamb and seafood. All this merely adorns the body, fills the belly, and dazzles the eyes and ears of others. In the end, the body and mind are greatly harmed, the blessings received are few, and when the great limit arrives, glory and honor cannot be held onto. They vanish like those who never had glory or honor—what then is the value of glory and honor?

Those who cultivate Heavenly rank savor benevolence and righteousness, and relish the Dao and virtue. They put aside superficial splendor and return to simplicity, conserve their spirit and nurture their upright qi, honor their inherent nature and pursue learning in the Dao. They refuse to exchange the real for the illusory, or mistake suffering for joy. They esteem and honor themselves, are content and satisfied. Neither favor nor disgrace reaches them, neither blame nor praise can be applied. Creation cannot restrain them, yin and yang cannot alter them, good and ill fortune cannot approach them. They perfect their original celestial countenance, delighting Heaven and Earth, and earning the respect of ghosts and spirits. They don the robes of Heaven, eat the food of Heaven, and enjoy the longevity of Heaven. Their glory and honor endure forever, unlike the fleeting glory and honor of the world, which differ as much as clouds and mud.

I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of worldly, illusory glory and honor, and instead pursue the true, transcendent glory and honor of liberation. Breaking through this barrier does not mean shunning glory and honor, but rather, when encountering such circumstances, one must cultivate the steadfast practice of not coveting them. Whether clinging to glory and honor while in their midst, craving them while residing in them, failing to forget them after leaving them, recognizing them as such when seeing them, or flattering them when encountering them—all these reveal that the barrier has not been broken. Only when one truly awakens to the fact that glory and honor can disorder one’s nature, delude one’s heart, inflate one’s qi, corrupt one’s virtue, indulge one’s vices, harm one’s body, and even end one’s life—only when one sees glory and honor as great suffering, a fiery pit, a mire of filth—has the barrier truly been broken. Then one may enter the realm of glory and honor without being harmed by it.

There have been those in the past who attained the Dao even within the halls of glory and honor, such as Bao Qian, the Prince of Huainan, Dongfang Shuo, Xu Jingshan, Master Mei, Immortal Ge, the Master Who Embraces Simplicity, and the Number One Scholar Luo—all great recluses in the court who accomplished great deeds. This is because they had long since seen through and penetrated the nature of glory and honor. Thus, they could plant lotuses in raging fires or sail boats through muddy waters, using worldly methods to cultivate the Dao. Their actions, whether manifest or hidden, whether in adversity or prosperity, were unfathomable to others, for they did not covet glory and honor.

Not only those who seek liberation must see through glory and honor; even those who remain in the world, if they can do so, will naturally possess a different perspective. When in favor, they will serve their lord and love the people, devoting themselves wholeheartedly to great undertakings of governance. They will never be like those who hold empty titles and consume idle food. When out of favor, they will cultivate their own integrity, refine the Dao, and establish virtue, their conduct surpassing the common and foolish. In the past, Yi Yin assisted Tang not to seek glory and honor, but to awaken the people with the Dao. Confucius traveled among the states, and Mencius sought sustenance from the lords—not to pursue glory and honor, but to propagate the Dao and seek its realization in the world. As for the masters of the Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Zhu schools, they all refrained from coveting glory and honor, serving when they could and withdrawing when they must.

Since ancient times, the great sages and worthies have always prioritized the Dao, never fixating on glory and honor. Yet worldly, deluded students fail to see through it: some cling to glory and honor while in its midst, others yearn for it despite lacking it, still others curry favor with the powerful to seek profit, or frequent the gates of nobles to bask in reflected glory. Even as they covet glory and honor, they claim to seek the Dao. Bewildered and confused, their thoughts scattered and chaotic, they grasp at this and snatch at that. No wonder they pass their lives in futility, achieving nothing by old age.

I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of worldly glory and honor: those who possess it must forget it, and those who lack it must not envy it. Regard the illumination of the Dao as true honor, and the attainment of the Dao as true glory. Only then will your aspirations return to the real, and your future hold promise. Otherwise, if you mistake false glory and honor for the real, and let this notion take root in your heart, your spiritual apertures will be blocked, and your vain hopes of illuminating the Dao will be in vain.

**The Barrier of Wealth and Profit**
The Supreme Sage said: *"The noble person is enlightened by righteousness; the petty person is enlightened by profit."* The Ancient Ancestor said: *"Do not value rare and precious goods,"* and also: *"Do not display what may be desired, lest the heart be disturbed."* Patriarch Lü said: *"Though gold and jade pile up like mountains, the immortals will but smile coldly and pay no heed."* All these teachings warn against coveting wealth and profit, for it can ruin great matters.

Yet wealth is of two kinds: worldly wealth and Dharma wealth. Worldly wealth consists of gold, silver, pearls, and jade; Dharma wealth consists of merit, virtue, sincerity, and devotion. Those who pursue worldly wealth value gold and silver over merit and virtue. They scheme endlessly, seizing openly or stealing covertly, harming others to benefit themselves, spending lightly and hoarding heavily. They begrudge that all the wealth under heaven does not belong to them alone, that all the profit in the world is not theirs to monopolize. They seek every opportunity for gain, scouring for every possible advantage, willing to risk life and limb, deceiving themselves and others without remorse. Having ten strings of cash, they crave a hundred; having a hundred, they crave a thousand; having a thousand, they crave ten thousand. Their greed knows no bounds, and they refuse to turn back even unto death.

Yet when the great limit arrives, even if one were as rich as Shi Chong, with wealth like ten thousand mountains, one could not bribe King Yama or escape the wheel of birth and death. All that remains is the burden of sin, carried to the grave, not a single coin taken along. At that moment, what use is regret? There are even more foolish men who hoard wealth, unwilling to spend on food or clothing, unwilling to aid orphans or widows, or to relieve the distressed and rescue the imperiled. They are mere slaves to wealth, miserly ghosts. Even as their last breath hovers before their eyes, they still instruct their descendants on how to amass and preserve wealth, fretting over who owes them debts and where their money is stored. Alas! When the three inches of breath depart, all things become empty—even this body no longer belongs to them, let alone their wealth. How foolish!

Those who accumulate Dharma wealth value merit and virtue over gold and silver, regarding all things with equanimity, free from the arising of the ten thousand entanglements. They amass merit and accumulate virtuous deeds, enduring hardship for the sake of others, widely practicing kindness and convenience. They treat their nature and life as pearls and treasures, regard benevolence and righteousness as gold and jade, cherish the conservation of qi and nurturing of spirit as goods and profit, hold the preservation of sincerity and authenticity as true wealth, and consider purity and non-action as their family estate.

As for the gold, silver, and treasures of the dusty world, they are viewed no differently than stones and earth. For what one seeks is the true treasure of the primordial Dao, while all worldly illusions of treasure are not worth clinging to. If those who study the Way harbor even the slightest thought of greed for wealth or scheming for profit, it obstructs the Great Dao. Though cultivators of the Way still dwell in the dusty world and cannot entirely abandon worldly wealth, they should, upon seeing profit, consider righteousness, following what comes naturally without excessive craving. Even when encountering wealth that arises naturally, they must examine its origins—taking only what is permissible and discarding what is not. This is what it means to "take righteousness as profit": though one may outwardly accept, the heart has never truly grasped it, so what hindrance is there in taking?

In ancient times, Confucius traveled among the feudal states, and Mencius wandered among the lords, yet they never refused the gifts of food and provisions from rulers, for these came naturally, not through forced seeking. Even our Patriarch Changchun, in his early days, dared not covet even a single grain of rice or a single coin, toiling with his sinews and starving his flesh, enduring what others could not endure, bearing what others could not bear. Yet when bitterness turned to sweetness and adversity gave way to prosperity, he was honored by the emperors of the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, and though he accepted their gifts, he used them to pray for rain and relieve droughts, to avert disasters and strengthen the nation, to repair and construct temples, and to greatly propagate the teachings. Such proper use of wealth was only possible because he had first accumulated Dharma wealth and later employed worldly wealth to establish merit.

Yet foolish students of the Way in this world, unaware of the urgency of seeking Dharma wealth, regard only worldly wealth as important. They deceive the faithful from all directions for the sake of clothing and food, borrowing and incurring debts, yet perform not a single good deed nor accumulate a single virtue, leaving them to repay these in future lives. Even their rebirth as human beings is uncertain—how then could they dare aspire to immortality? There are even more wicked sorts who swindle the devout, pointing east while begging west, committing fraud without doing a single good deed. They gamble and brawl over drink, and over a few coins, they quarrel at the slightest provocation or resort to violence. Then there are the false scholars of the Dao, who speak of virtue while harboring thieving hearts, putting on airs like immortals, yet at the sight of money, their true nature is revealed—they haggle over amounts without regard for shame. Truly, as I have often said, their lives are not worth two hundred coins.

I urge those who sincerely study the Way to swiftly break through the barrier of wealth and profit, never to see gain and forget righteousness or let greed arise in the heart. Know this: no matter how much gold and jade one piles up, it cannot buy life and death. The more wealth one has, the more burdens; the more profit one seeks, the more harm it brings. Better to die upholding the Dao than to perish abandoning it, for there is still merit in that. Otherwise, if the heart’s desire for profit outweighs its devotion to the Dao, the upright cannot overcome the perverse, and the hope of attaining the Way becomes distant indeed.

As for the barrier of poverty and hardship, the Supreme Sage said: *"The noble person remains steadfast in poverty; the petty person, in poverty, falls into excess."* The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: *"Abide in poverty and lowliness, and act accordingly."* Mencius said: *"Poverty and lowliness cannot sway me."* Master Ziyang wrote:
*"The poor man’s pearl lies within his robe,
Round and bright, inherently fine.
Failing to seek it himself,
He counts instead another’s treasure."*

All these teach us to hold fast to the good Way even unto death, to endure hardship without being swayed by it. The path of cultivating the Real is contrary to worldly ways—it requires forsaking wealth and honor for poverty and humility, abandoning luxury for simplicity. One must first harden the will, toil the body, starve the flesh, and empty the self, refining and polishing to cast off the false and seek the true. Even in the face of blades, floods, fire, illness, or disaster, one must not falter—how much less should one be troubled by poverty? If one cannot endure hardship, if hunger and cold breed vexation, if difficulties stir ignorance, then the harm of hunger and thirst becomes the harm of the heart. To nurture the small is to become petty; to cling to the false and abandon the true is to distance oneself from the Dao—when will one ever reach its shore?

Little do they know that the matters of life and nature are great, while clothing and food are small. How can one cultivate life and nature if one values clothing and food above them? Those who pursue mere sustenance can only nourish the flesh; those who cultivate life and nature preserve their primordial truth. If that truth is lost, though the body may be plump and strong like a pig or an ox, outwardly human yet inwardly bestial, such a life is no different from death—how can such a one be called a cultivator of the Way?

In the past, the True Man Changchun spent seven years at Longmen and six years at Panxi, enduring constant hunger yet never wavering even unto death. The True Man Taigu sat in meditation beneath the Zhaozhou Bridge, unmoved by cold or hunger, heedless of life and death. The True Man Danyang abandoned great wealth to enter the Iron Fork, forsaking warmth and comfort for poverty and simplicity, dwelling in thatched huts and mountain caves. All these masters endured what others could not endure, suffered what others could not suffer, and from such hardship attained the Great Dao.

Yet foolish students of the Way today cannot bear hardship, cannot endure hunger and cold. At the slightest difficulty or taste of austerity, they grow vexed, curse heaven and earth, indulge in wayward thoughts, abandon their true nature, and scheme for escape. If they cannot endure such minor hardships, how could they ever pass through great dangers and perils? Thus, for students of the Way, enduring hardship is essential. Even the slightest fear or aversion becomes a towering mountain blocking the path, a demon harming the Dao, leaving one unable to take a single step forward.

I urge those who sincerely study the Way to swiftly break through the barrier of hardship, to make their hearts like iron and stone, their wills like cold ashes, living in accord with conditions—hungry thus, cold thus, even freezing or starving to death, thus. Never let the petty matters of hardship make one forget the great matter of life and nature.

Proceeding thus with wholehearted devotion, walking the path in truth and practice, taking the Dao as one’s own duty—those who have not yet heard the Dao will ultimately hear it, and those who have heard it will ultimately realize it. The patriarchs have made unseen arrangements, ensuring that no true seeker of the Dao will be ruined by cold or hunger. Otherwise, if one is clothed in abundance and lives in ease, unable to endure even minor hardships or slight privations, vainly hoping to awaken to the Dao, it will be difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of the Physical Form**
The Old Master said: "My greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what afflictions could I have?" He also said: "Put the self behind, and the self advances; set the self aside, and the self endures." The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: "One cannot see the Tathāgata through bodily form." The Carefree Master said: "Know that the Dharma-body of all buddhas is originally without form, yet it manifests as a body adorned with marks of excellence." Linji Chan Master said: "The true Buddha has no form, true nature has no substance, the true Dharma has no appearance." Zhuangzi said: "Alas! The people of the world believe that nourishing the form is sufficient to preserve life, yet nourishing the form is truly insufficient to preserve life—what then is the world worth?" An ancient immortal said: "Do not cling to this body as the Dao; beyond this body lies the true body." Since ancient times, all realized immortals and buddhas have not prized the physical form but cultivated the Dharma-body.

Yet the people of the world all take this physical form as their true treasure, cherishing and clinging to it. They seek to enrich their lives, unwilling to let go. They pursue honor and glory to adorn this body, amass wealth to sustain it, feast on meat and wine to fatten it, and dress it in fine clothes and fine food. Day and night, they scheme and calculate, expending all their energy and spirit, becoming neighbors to ghosts. Though they call this "enriching life," it is truly harming life. They do not realize that the physical form is but a temporary vessel of heaven and earth, a fleeting combination of the four elements. Once the yang qi is exhausted and yin qi prevails, the hun and po scatter, leaving nothing but a lump of foul, rotting flesh—merely fertilizer for the earth. Where then is the true? Where is the real? Since it is not real, it must be false. Those who cherish the physical form only add falsehood to falsehood.

Worldly deluded students vainly hope to cultivate truth yet do not know how to fathom it; they vainly hope to realize the Dao yet do not know how to discern it. Without fathoming truth or discerning the Dao, unaware of what the true Dao truly is, they wander in confusion, taking this physical form as real. They fear suffering for this body, dread labor for this body, recoil from hunger or cold for this body. They seek warm clothes and fine food to protect and pamper it, living in comfort and ease, sparing it all exertion. They avoid all strenuous good deeds yet tirelessly pursue matters that harm the path to life, sparing no effort or energy. Taking the false for the real, the empty for the solid, they do not realize that within and without this body, all is harmful to life—nothing benefits it. The eye delights in beautiful forms, the ear rages at harsh sounds, the nose clings to fragrant scents, the tongue craves fine flavors, the mind fixates on desires, and the body trembles at touch. The six senses without and the six consciousnesses within attack in concert, depleting the true primordial qi. The root of this lies in the physical form—without it, how could the harm of the six senses and six consciousnesses arise?

Moreover, among the myriad things under heaven, all that has form must decay. If one clings to the falsity of this physical form and does not fathom the truth of nature and life, when the great limit arrives, who am I and whose is this body? Body and self become entirely separate. I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of the physical form and not be deceived. Regard the seven apertures as holes, the four limbs as knots of wood, the flesh as pus-filled sores, and the five viscera as tumors. Cast this physical form beyond consideration and seek instead the formless form, the imageless image of the true body. Only then can one preserve the nature, illuminate the nature—for only by relinquishing the false can one attain the true; only by recognizing the false can one perceive the true. The false and the true cannot coexist, just as good and evil do not share the same path.

Otherwise, if one merely recognizes the false yet cannot cast it aside, how can one seek the true? Without seeking the true, how can one cultivate it? If one clings to the physical form without awakening, vainly hoping to awaken to the Dao, it will be difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of Arrogance**
The *Book of Changes* says: "The noble person is empty and receptive to others." It also says: "Humility brings honor and radiance; lowliness cannot be surpassed." The *Daodejing* states: "Not asserting oneself, one becomes enlightened; not being self-righteous, one becomes distinguished; not boasting, one achieves merit; not being proud, one endures." All these teach one to humble oneself and honor others, never harboring arrogance or self-satisfaction.

For those who study the Dao, the first requirement is to empty the heart and lower the qi, to humble and diminish oneself, never complacent or full. See only one’s shortcomings, not one’s strengths. Be diligent and eager to learn, never ashamed to ask those below. Respect teachers and honor friends, free from all arrogance or impatience. Only then can one move true teachers to offer guidance and good friends to encourage. Generally, true teachers and good friends do not readily reveal their edges. If one is truly resolute, not relying on talent or boasting of ability, appearing foolish and inarticulate, the discerning will notice and, unseen, take care not to abandon them. After long testing, they will lift one up. But those who are self-important and self-satisfied, though clever and learned, will be left unregarded.

In this world, deluded learners, upon barely entering the gate, immediately aspire to immortality; no sooner do they glimpse a master than they demand oral instructions. They give no thought to what the Great Dao truly is, or what cultivation truly entails—treating it with irreverence and disdain, vainly hoping to stumble upon treasures along the way. Some dabble in peripheral arts and pride themselves on possessing the Dao. Arrogant in heart and haughty in qi, they claim sagely wisdom and boast of their own prowess, parading their skills before others. Even when they encounter a discerning master, they refuse to lower their heads, missing the opportunity right before them. Others may have read a few Confucian texts, grasped a few passages, or memorized some alchemical classics, clinging to symbols and fixating on words. They deem themselves fully enlightened, speaking grandly and looking down on all, never deigning to heed the teachings of the wise. Rashly taking action, they practice recklessly—far from gaining benefit, they only invite harm. By the time grave illness befalls them, they realize their error, but no remedy remains, and regret comes too late.

There are also ignorant scholars who, relying on their own learning, recklessly speculate and criticize, offering half-truths and distortions. Should they encounter a monk or a Daoist, they immediately test them with alchemical texts. If the master does not engage, they dismiss them as lacking the Dao. Even when they meet a true teacher, they show no sincerity or respect. Assuming an air of grandeur, they sit in lofty judgment, speaking recklessly without restraint. Such people, lazy and deceitful, how can they ever catch the fragrant breeze or draw near the shore of the Dao?

Those who possess the Dao steal the secrets of yin and yang, seize the workings of creation, transcend life and death, and escape the cycle of rebirth—cherished by heaven and earth, hidden by gods and spirits. If one is not a person of great virtue and true sincerity, how could they dare to lightly impart such knowledge, or how could they be permitted to casually receive it? Moreover, the secret essence of the Great Dao does not reside in written words. The alchemical classics left by past masters serve only to clarify principles and guide later generations, expanding their understanding to seek verification from a teacher. They are not meant to be grasped as the Dao itself.

Among those who lack true learning, many merely hear the sound of the clapper without discerning right from wrong, blind leading the blind. Those with some literary understanding often stubbornly cling to their own views, refusing to humble themselves, persisting in error. In all such cases, the root of the problem lies in arrogance and self-satisfaction. Arrogance and self-satisfaction mean the absence of a true heart. Without a true heart to seek the Dao, who would truly guide them? Would they not waste their spirit and ruin their great endeavor in vain?

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of arrogance. Seek out enlightened teachers and good friends, and with utmost sincerity, humbly request their instruction. Sweep away all faults of self-opinion, self-righteousness, self-boasting, and self-importance. Even if a trace of these flaws lingers within, present yourself as a humble, yielding, and modest person. Those who have not yet heard the Dao will then be able to hear it; those who have already heard it will be able to attain it. For only through smallness can one become great; only through humility can one rise high; only through yielding can one stand upright; only through emptiness can one become full. Otherwise, with arrogance filling the chest and no one in one’s eyes, the aspiration to understand the Dao will remain unattainable.

**The Barrier of Jealousy**
The *Yi Jing* says: "The noble person discusses and practices with friends."
The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Before one has attained liberation, one should first help others attain it."
The *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* says: "If a good man or good woman receives and upholds even a four-line verse of this sutra and explains it to others, the merit of this surpasses the former."
Mencius says: "Goodness is shared with others; one abandons one’s own views to follow others and delights in learning goodness from them."

All these speak of doing good for others and avoiding jealousy or selfishness. Those who cultivate the truth cultivate both nature and life. These two—nature and life—are possessed by everyone, complete in each person. They neither increase in the sage nor diminish in the commoner. Regardless of wealth or poverty, wisdom or foolishness, high or low status, who lacks nature and life? Since everyone possesses them, the Great Dao is a shared treasure, and everyone can understand it, everyone can become a immortal or a buddha. It depends only on the determined and faithful to cultivate and realize it themselves.

However, the method of cultivation and realization requires seeking guidance from an enlightened teacher and drawing support from good friends. The enlightened teacher sets the framework, while good friends expand one’s understanding. One must sincerely seek the teacher and respect the friends, for the benefit of good friends is akin to half that of a teacher. By borrowing their knowledge to supplement one’s ignorance, and their abilities to aid one’s shortcomings, the advantages are manifold—how could one treat them lightly? Thus, the ancestral masters taught people to seek teachers and visit friends.

For example, those who study the Dao under the same teacher share the same aspirations and pursuits, gathering day and night. They should respect and care for one another, encouraging virtue and correcting faults together, supporting each other in hardship, and tending to one another in illness. Like partners seeking wealth, they pull the boat together. If the other does not understand, one explains it to them; if one does not understand, one asks the other to clarify. By mutually aiding each other, their merit doubles. Moreover, studying the Dao in the same hall makes them companions in nature and life, bound by the Dao and righteousness. They should naturally be kind and harmonious. The other’s gains are as one’s own; the other’s losses are as one’s own. Only then are they true fellow cultivators.

As the *Book of Songs* says: "When others have skill, it is as if I possess it; when others are virtuous and wise, my heart delights in them, as if the words came from my own mouth."

Yet deluded learners in the world, lacking resolve, resent their friends’ encouragement. When they make mistakes, their friends admonish them, but they erupt in ignorance. Not only do they refuse to listen, but they also harbor resentment. Unwilling to delve into the principles themselves, they remain ignorant for long. Seeing others diligently practicing, able to understand and awaken, and favored by the teacher, they secretly grow jealous.

Thus they deliberately stir up discord and ruin others’ good deeds. Instead of repenting their own incompetence, they envy others’ abilities. They never reflect on what the study of the Dao truly entails. Those who study the Dao do so to reform their faults and turn toward goodness. If one learns while still unvirtuous, it is to become virtuous; if one learns while still flawed, it is to correct those flaws. Yet now, seeing others’ goodness, they do not emulate it; though themselves faultless, they resent others and thus bring faults upon themselves. With twisted intentions, they grow worse by the day, sinking into the irredeemable depths of the dullest fools.

There are even some shameless ruffians who, upon hearing others speak of the Dao, mock them to their faces; upon seeing others cultivate, slander them in secret. If they do not believe in the Dao, why enter its gate? Having entered, they yet despise it. They don the cap and robes of the ancestral masters but defy their words and betray their deeds. Unaware of their sins, ignorant of cause and effect—how can they be called Daoists?

Long ago, Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha vowed to help all beings attain Buddhahood before himself. Lü Dongbin vowed to deliver every person in the world before ascending himself. The Seven Perfected, disciples of Wang Chongyang, after their master’s transcendence, all served Ma Yu as their teacher. Through Ma’s guidance, they each completed the great work.

Generally, learners must first cultivate a mind of great impartiality and selflessness, a compassionate heart that benefits others as well as themselves—only then can they progress. I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of jealousy, embracing universal oneness without self. Focus only on refining yourself through hardship, honoring others’ strengths while acknowledging your own shortcomings. Lower your head in service, advance with sincerity, taking each step as it comes, accumulating merit with each deed. Cultivate the heart of the sages, practice their conduct, and you will ultimately achieve their work. Otherwise, jealousy will fill your breast, and the more you study, the worse you will become. You will not even be able to be a good person—how then can you aspire to sagehood or hope to comprehend the Dao?

**The Barrier of Impatience**
The *Yi Jing* says: "The noble person restrains anger and curbs desire."
The *Yin Fu Jing* says: "Fire arises from wood; when calamity erupts, it must be subdued."
Master Zeng said: "When the heart harbors resentment, it cannot remain upright."
Mencius said: "Hold fast to your will, but do not let your qi become violent."
The *Song of Attaining the Dao* says: "Before refining the elixir, first refine your nature."

All these speak of how impatience and fiery temper harm the Dao and must be diligently removed. The true student of the Dao moves with the modesty of a maiden and nurtures qi like an infant. Softness and weakness come first, harmony is the foundation. In dealing with the world, one responds to things as they are; yielding and deferring to others are essential. Long ago, Śākyamuni endured five hundred kalpas as the Ascetic of Forbearance before attaining Buddhahood. The Most High Lord Lao, when called an ox, responded as an ox; when called a horse, responded as a horse—ultimately becoming the founder of the Dao. Master Changchun once tasted another’s excrement and thus achieved greatness. Master Sanfeng endured endless abuse from others and thus completed the great work. All this because their hearts yearned for the Dao, knowing that the matters of life and destiny are paramount. External insults, slander, and adverse circumstances were all cast aside, as if they were deaf and blind.

Yet deluded learners in the world never ask why they left the household life or what kind of person wears the Daoist cap and robes. They drift through days in a daze, loving flattery and praise, craving others’ deference while refusing to defer to anyone.

Should the slightest friction arise, their fiery temper flares. Anger surges forth, and resentment takes root. They disregard water and fire, blades and weapons, pits and wells, cliffs and rivers—fearing nothing. Some even contend with brute force, wounding one another, driving themselves to mortal peril, or forfeiting their very lives. Yet this is not all: once rage and temper erupt, the primordial spirit flees its chamber, a great fire scorches the body, vital fluids dry up, and true qi scatters. The Three Treasures are harmed, the Five Virtues dissolve into emptiness; within, one loses their authentic nature, and without, their virtue is undone. Their nature is thrown into chaos, their life force shaken—before they have gained anything from others, they have already wounded themselves. How could the harm of rage and temper be trifling?

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of rage and temper. Become one who can infuriate others to death, yet wear the guise of a mindless fool. Be as dull as the ignorant, as reticent as the speechless, as deaf as the unhearing, as mute as the voiceless. When others curse you, respond thus; when they strike you, respond thus; when they despise or slander you, respond thus. Let your heart be as cold as dead ashes, your nature as frozen as ice. Only when not a trace of heat lingers within have you truly leapt beyond the barrier of rage and temper. If even the slightest heat remains, though it may not show outwardly, its root is still planted within. When encountering adverse circumstances or unjust matters, it will inevitably erupt in full force.

The *Daodejing* says: "The highest virtue is like water. Water benefits all things and does not contend; it dwells in places others disdain. Thus it is close to the Dao." Only those who can humble themselves before others can rise above them; only those who can yield to others can become strong. Otherwise, if rage and temper are not dispelled, one knows only the self and not others, knows only strength and not weakness. Acting on impulse, following the whims of the heart—how can one hope to comprehend the Dao?

The *Yijing* states: "Restrain your jaws, and speech will be orderly." It also says: "Refine your words and establish sincerity—this is how one abides in their calling." The Supreme Sage said: "The noble person is slow in speech but quick in action." The Most High Lord Lao said: "Close your mouth, seal your gates, and you will not toil for your entire life." All these teach us to guard our words and refrain from reckless speech.

The mouth and tongue are the gates of expression and the roots of right and wrong. They concern a person’s integrity and are tied to their virtue. Here, the noble and the petty are distinguished; the upright and the perverse are set apart. Whether one invites misfortune or blessings, succeeds or fails—all is determined here. Thus, the noble person deliberates before speaking. They speak only what should be spoken, and refrain from what should not. Their words may benefit the world and the hearts of people, guide others to reform and improve, urge them to abandon evil and return to rightness, offer convenience and resolve difficulties, or conceal faults and extol virtues—never uttering reckless, frivolous, or empty words.

It is not that they remain silent, but that once words are spoken, even a team of four horses cannot retrieve them. Consequences follow immediately, so speech must not be careless. Should words be spoken imprudently, they either harm others or bring misfortune upon oneself. The harm of the mouth and tongue is as sharp as a blade, as poisonous as a venomous bird—how could it be trifling?

Yet deluded learners in the world fail to grasp the stakes. They treat careless speech as insignificant, mistake glibness for talent, and take clever debate as a mark of success. They may expose others’ shortcomings, boast of their own strengths, spin lies and deceit, engage in gossip and slander, make promises they later break, utter empty words without swift action, speak wildly and provoke disaster, or engage in lofty talk without substance. They may curse in broad daylight, flatter with cunning words, ruin affairs with their speech, or wound others with their words—all such utterances bring harm without benefit. What value is there in such speech? It would be better to remain silent.

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of the mouth and tongue. Do not open your mouth recklessly, nor let your tongue move without thought. Speak only what is proper, and let your words conform to propriety. Refine your words and establish sincerity; be cautious in speech and prudent in action. Never speak lightly, and let your words always hit the mark.

Moreover, speech is the voice of the heart, and the tongue is the sprout of the heart. If the movements of the mouth and tongue are not upright, it is clear that the field of the heart is not upright. If the field of the heart is not upright, the root is already corrupted—one’s nature is obscured, their life force shaken, their spirit secretly harmed. How can one hope to comprehend or cultivate the Dao?

The *Heart Sutra of Prajnaparamita* says: "There is no ignorance, nor extinction of ignorance." Master Chuan said: "Sweep clean the field of the mind—this is the cause of the Pure Land. Whether fortune or wisdom, first drive out greed and anger." Master Baizhang said: "If within the viscera there is nothing to gain, nothing to seek, then the dusts of the world do not arise, self and others do not stir. This is like fitting Mount Sumeru into a mustard seed, or absorbing the waters of the four great seas. Not receiving the words of joy or anger into one’s ears, unconfused and undisturbed by any circumstance, neither resentful nor delighted, scraping clean all attachments—such a person is free from affairs, surpassing all those with knowledge, understanding, diligence, or ascetic practice."

The *Song of the Knocking Hexagrams* says: "If anger is not removed and stubbornness not changed, one falls into the sea of birth and death." All these speak of anger and resentment as obstacles to the Dao, which must be fiercely eradicated.

The two words "anger" and "resentment" are like snakes and scorpions—most vile and venomous. If they take root in the heart and chest, accumulating over time, they become a poison that harms life and damages destiny, bringing calamity of the fiercest kind. Outwardly, they harm others; inwardly, they ruin oneself—yet no medicine can cure them.

The learner’s capacity must be as vast and boundless as the sky, their sincerity as deep and all-embracing as the earth, their tolerance as encompassing as the sea, to which all waters flow.

Only then may one observe the vastness of heaven, which covers all things without exception and gives life to all. The sun and moon traverse its expanse as they will; the stars and constellations revolve as they will; clouds and mist obscure as they will. Men may deceive—it remains unmoved; men may revere—it remains unmoved; men may feel gratitude—it remains unmoved; men may slander and resent—it remains unmoved. All things, whether good or evil, deviant or upright, fierce or dull, foolish or inferior, pass by unknown to it.

The earth’s profound thickness nurtures all things without exception and bears all things without exception. It bears the weight of Mount Tai and Mount Hua, endures the surging collapse of rivers and streams, tolerates the piercing pressure of trees, rocks, and grasses, accommodates the trampling of birds and beasts, and yields to the plowing and digging of the plowshare. All insults and destruction pass by without stirring its heart.

The sea’s capacity gathers all waters, flowing day and night without cease. For a thousand years, ten thousand years, it never appears full. When clear water enters, it does not appear clear; when turbid water enters, it does not appear turbid. When sweet water enters, it does not appear sweet; when bitter water enters, it does not appear bitter. Fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs roam freely as they will; dragons and serpents surge as they will. All filth, foulness, stench, and impurity—nothing is not contained.

If one who cultivates the Dao can possess the vastness of heaven, the thickness of earth, and the breadth of the sea, they become a carefree immortal, mastering the wondrous secret of preserving life. They draw near to the Dao and gain great advantage. Yet deluded learners in the world do not know that the harm of anger and resentment is the greatest. They may grow angry when circumstances are unfavorable, when plans fail, when possessions are lost, when envious of another’s ability, when temperaments clash, when clothing and food are insufficient, when offended, when nursing small grievances, when requests go unanswered, or when others do not comply with their wishes. All such afflictions of anger and resentment arise from one’s own confusion and lack of true devotion to the Dao.

A person truly devoted to the Dao would never be thus. The utmost sage blamed himself deeply and held others lightly. Yanzi, when offended, did not retaliate—his freedom from anger and resentment is why he was a sage. The world is filled with people who harbor anger and resentment, which is why they remain ordinary. The distinction between sage and ordinary lies solely in the presence or absence of these poisons.

Yet anger and resentment do not only harm when expressed outwardly; even the faintest trace of lingering resentment, hidden within, can injure one’s true nature. One must be utterly pure, inside and out, as white as snow, as bright as a mirror. In all dealings with affairs and people, one must act with a mind of no-mind. Only then can the spirit and qi remain unharmed, the temperament harmonious, and the great Dao attainable.

I urge those truly devoted to the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of anger and resentment, to become a person of no-mind. Whether matters are light or heavy, low or high, they will pass through. Let things be as they are; respond to affairs as they come. Respond without grasping, pass without lingering—how then could anger and resentment cause harm?

Otherwise, if anger and resentment arise, their dark and hidden poison will congeal within, obscuring one’s true nature. To then seek enlightenment in delusion would be difficult indeed.

The *Yi* says: *"Stopping at the back, one does not grasp the self. Walking through the courtyard, one does not see others. No blame."* It also says: *"Fellowship in the wild brings prosperity."* The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: *"No self, no person, no being, no life."* The sages said: *"Loyalty and forbearance—deviating little from the Dao. What you would not wish for yourself, do not impose on others."* Master Shangyang said: *"Quickly topple the mountain of self and others; urgently break through the emptiness of dragon and tiger."* All speak of the necessity, in cultivating the Dao, to be free of the perception of self and others.

Yet to be free of others, one must first be free of self. For if there is a self, selfishness arises. With selfishness, every word and deed, every movement and stillness, becomes for the self. Seeking only for the self, one disregards others. Disregarding others, one inevitably harms them to benefit oneself, violating heaven and reason, stopping at nothing.

Consider the beginning of life: regardless of wisdom or foolishness, nobility or lowliness, all share the same nature and life, the same form and bones—where then is the distinction between self and other? Without such distinction, I am as others, others are as I, and self and other become one. This is the mind of heaven and earth, vast and impartial; this is the Dao of the sages, embracing all people and things; this is the method of the cultivator, forgetting both self and others.

If a learner can uphold this mind, this Dao, this method, and practice accordingly, they become the embryo of a sage, the seed of an immortal or buddha, and the great Dao is within reach. Yet deluded learners in the world do not understand the principle of great impartiality, of viewing self and things as one. They cling to this body, taking it as the self. Once they recognize a self, others immediately appear. With self and others, distinctions arise. Distinctions made, they value themselves and belittle others, favoring themselves and excluding others. Day and night, they scheme to enrich themselves, devising countless ways to take from others. In every action and matter, they refuse to yield; in every transaction and profit, they seek advantage. Not only in dealings with affairs and people do they strive to prevail in all things, but even with close friends, colleagues, and peers, they draw lines between self and other. They resent not possessing others’ valued things for themselves alone, not monopolizing all good fortune in the world. Where there is profit, they thrust forward; where there is none, they shrink back.

Little do they know that when the last breath is cut off, all things become empty—even this body no longer belongs to them.

When that moment arrives, where shall I be? Where shall others be? Neither self nor other shall remain. Why then, in this world, vainly expend one’s schemes, stubbornly distinguishing self from other, and alone accumulating enmity—is this not folly? I urge those who truly seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of self and other, returning to the original face before self and other arose, and abiding in the state after death when self and other vanish. Regard all things as one body, the world as one family. When you see another’s joy, rejoice as if it were your own; when you see another’s sorrow, grieve as if it were your own. When you see another’s gain, feel it as your own gain; when you see another’s loss, feel it as your own loss. Those with wealth may relieve the needy; those without may still offer convenience. In every place, benefit others; in every matter, accumulate virtue. When adversity comes, treat it as if unaware; when humiliation is inflicted, regard it as if unknowing. When you can spare another, spare them; where retreat is fitting, retreat. Only then are these the conduct of a true seeker, the sincerity of one who yearns for the Dao. Otherwise, with the perception of self and other, the division of you and me, and the accumulation of selfish desires clogging the heart’s passage, to vainly hope for enlightenment in the Dao is difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of Cold and Heat**
The Ancestor of the Cold-Heat Barrier said: *"Cast aside the body, and the body endures."* Wen Shi said: *"In winter, clad in wind yet not cold; in summer, clad in fire yet not hot."* Lü Zu said: *"Seek life yet do not live; learn death before death comes."* All speak of forgetting the body for the Dao’s sake, undeterred by cold or heat. Those who cultivate the Dao must first see through the illusory body, placing the physical form beyond concern. If even death holds no fear, how much less cold or heat? Thus, when Shen Guang sought the Dharma at Shaolin Temple, snow piled past his knees, yet he remained unaware. At the ancient Zhaozhou Bridge, the venerable one sat in cold meditation as waters rose to submerge him, yet he knew nothing. Śākyamuni, cultivating on Snow Mountain, endured untold hardships. The Ancestor Changchun, tempering his nature at Pan Creek, suffered countless hunger and cold. Even in recent times, the Perfected One of Baishi Town, Liang, in tattered robes and unwashed face, remained upright for years without rest. Zhang the Sleeping Immortal of Xining Prefecture lay by the springs, naked and exposed, for over forty years as if it were but a day. The Immortal of Suoluo refined himself on the riverbank; the Dogskin Immortal slept on ice; Master Xianliu endured hardship beneath the yellow sands—all disregarded cold and heat, relinquished the physical body, and attained the Dharma-body.

Yet deluded seekers in the world, unaware that fragrance arises from stench and sweetness from bitterness, mistake the physical body for reality, cherishing and preserving it, seeking only ease and comfort. At the first chill, they seek warmth; at the first heat, they crave coolness. Fearing cold and heat, they sever their connection to the Dao. Do they not realize that the cultivation of one’s nature and life is the foremost matter of human existence? How can one allow the trifles of cold and heat to obstruct the great work of life and nature? Those truly devoted to life and nature must pass through the gate of life and death, the trials of great adversity, with ease and detachment. How then can cold and heat be worthy of concern? Though the Dao may not yet be attained, the physical body must not be harmed. Coarse clothing suffices to protect it—make do and move on. There is no need to dwell on cold or heat. When cold comes, endure it; when heat comes, endure it. Flow with the seasons—neither resisting nor clinging. This is not to say one must endure cold when it is unnecessary or heat when it is unwarranted. To stubbornly endure cold when it is uncalled for, or heat when it is avoidable, is mere affectation, obstinate and unyielding, inviting suffering for no purpose. What benefit does it bring?

Generally, while fear of cold and heat may seem a minor matter, it greatly hinders the Dao. Even a trace of concern for cold or heat gives rise to endless deluded thoughts. When cold comes, one schemes to avoid it; when heat comes, one schemes to escape it. Clinging to the false, one loses the true—how great the error! I urge those who truly seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of cold and heat. Adapt to the moment, find peace wherever you are. Cold is acceptable; heat is acceptable—so long as one does not freeze or die of heat. Never let cold or heat give rise to ignorance. Otherwise, with cold or heat in the heart, fear arises, and the heart is not upright; worry arises, and the heart is not upright. If the heart is not upright, to vainly hope for enlightenment in the Dao is difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of Laziness**
The *Book of Changes* says: *"If one does not persevere in virtue, disgrace may follow."* It also says: *"The Dao of heaven and earth is enduring and unceasing."* The Supreme Sage said: *"The noble person follows the Dao, but if he abandons it halfway, I cannot approve."* Emperor Chongyang said: *"Fragrance arises from stench; sweetness comes from bitterness."* All speak of the need for seekers to be fiercely courageous and diligent, never lazy or complacent.

The cultivation of life and nature is the greatest matter of human existence and the most difficult task in the world. It demands arduous effort, unwavering resolve, enduring perseverance, and a steadfast beginning and end to make progress. Such an enduring and unchanging great endeavor requires sustained and unceasing effort to succeed. Whether repairing bridges and roads to benefit others, distributing medicine or tea to relieve urgent needs, restoring temples or building monasteries to encourage goodness, aiding the elderly and pitying the poor to accumulate virtue, rescuing the imperiled and delivering the distressed, or laboring for the teachings and undertaking great worldly tasks; whether cultivating the heart and abandoning worldly affairs, or tirelessly studying day and night to clarify the true principle, or traveling east and west in search of an enlightened teacher, or facing calamities and hardships with redoubled resolve—all these demand relentless effort.

Upon witnessing a single good, act upon it at once; upon encountering a single evil, cast it away immediately. Exert yourself at all times, apply effort in every moment. Cherish every inch of time, allowing not a single moment to pass in vain. Naturally, you will ascend from lowliness to eminence, progress from shallowness to depth, stand like a crane among chickens, and ultimately earn the regard of those of lofty attainment.

Yet the world is full of muddled learners who establish not a single merit, cultivate not a single virtue, seeking only ease and shunning hardship. They flee from tasks requiring effort and retreat from opportunities to practice. They eat their fill all day, their minds idle, wandering aimlessly, empty and without substance. Even when they encounter an enlightened teacher, they vainly hope that a word or half a phrase will bring them sudden and complete awakening. Outwardly, they feign sincerity, while inwardly harboring deceit. They refuse to delve deeply into the principles of the Dao or endure the refining fires of discipline. After a few days, failing to obtain the secret, they deem themselves ill-fated and depart. Worse still are those sinful wretches who, instead of blaming their own lack of resolve, slander their teachers as stingy, nursing grudges in their hearts that last a lifetime. Such conduct reveals neither enduring aspiration nor true intent to learn the Way. Not only will they find it difficult to ascend to heaven, but they may well descend into hell.

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of laziness. Accumulate hidden virtue to the fullest of your capacity, and act with diligence. Externally, benefit others; internally, refine yourself. Morning and evening, regard your nature and life as paramount; in every thought, make body and mind your concern. Advance with effort at every step, pressing forward at every turn, unwavering until death. In the end, there will come a day of liberation, a moment of fulfillment. Otherwise, if you hesitate and falter, idling away your days in indolence, unable to endure minor hardships or accomplish great deeds, how can you ever hope to achieve the rare and exalted state of becoming an immortal or a buddha? To vainly aspire to enlightenment, to transcend the realms of humans and gods, to escape the sea of suffering—such hopes are in vain.

**The Barrier of Talent and Wisdom**
The *Yi Jing* states: "Through diligent humility, the noble person achieves completion—auspicious." The Supreme Sage said: "Even one possessing the talent and virtue of the Duke of Zhou, if arrogant and stingy, is scarcely worth observing." The Ancient Master said: "Great accomplishment appears incomplete, yet its use is inex

**The Barrier of Willfulness**

The *Dao De Jing* states: "Those who display themselves are not enlightened; those who assert themselves are not distinguished." The ancient scriptures say: "Those who cling are unable to comprehend the Dao and virtue." Mencius said: "To turn inward and be sincere—there is no greater joy; to act with steadfast forbearance—there is no closer path to benevolence." The *Book of Songs* says: "Virtuous in conduct, gracious in countenance, cautious and reverent." All these teach us to act in accordance with nature and reason, not willfully or obstinately.

After a person is born, they inherit the acquired temperament of their postnatal qi, and thus differ in wisdom and foolishness, goodness and evil, purity and turbidity, strength and weakness. Only the sage, endowed by Heaven, possesses a nature that is perfectly luminous, pure, and flawless. Those of middling or lesser capacity, however, each bear their own biases and afflictions, which are grave harms to their nature and life. Though these are indeed great harms, if one can recognize them, one may transform their temperament—turning foolishness into wisdom, evil into goodness, turbidity into clarity, and weakness into strength.

The key lies in not indulging one’s nature but instead drawing near to those of the Dao, humbly seeking their instruction. Borrow another’s insight to shatter your own delusions; borrow another’s refinement to remove your own flaws. For the stone of another mountain can polish jade. Through gradual practice, one ascends; through gradual study, one improves. Though foolish, one will surely become enlightened; though weak, one will surely become strong. What fear is there that the Dao will not be understood or cultivation not achieved?

Yet the world is full of muddled learners who do not grasp the harm of willfulness. Though they claim to study the Dao, they indulge their nature and refuse to improve. Though they wish to learn the Dao, they act willfully and disregard its principles. They may feign compliance with a teacher’s guidance while secretly defying it; they may accept a friend’s admonitions with outward agreement but inward deceit. When working with others, they presume their own wisdom; when living among others, they vie for dominance. They may flaunt their own learning to belittle others or rely on their own cleverness to mock the foolish. They refuse to yield in speech or grow vexed at the slightest provocation. They bully the weak and cannot harmonize with others; their minds are narrow and cannot accommodate anything. All these are the faults of willfulness.

Not only do such habits invite the scorn of others, but inwardly, they sow the seeds of hidden poison. Lifelong biases remain uncorrected; innate foolishness persists unabated. Convinced of their own rightness, they refuse to admit fault. With such an approach to the Dao, even if Laozi stood before them or Śākyamuni dwelled beside them, what benefit would there be?

A true person of resolve focuses their heart on the Dao. In quietude, they reflect on their own faults; in conversation, they avoid speaking ill of others. In all matters, they proceed with caution, examining each step. They adapt to others and circumstances, yielding and accommodating, free from obstinacy and self-assertion. They regard retreat as advancement and non-contention as true strength. How could they fail to attain profound mastery and self-realization?

I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of willfulness. Conduct yourself with humility; dwell in softness and weakness. Gradually shed all past obstinacies and biases, all tendencies toward self-display and self-righteousness. Learn to be a person of the Dao without willfulness—play the fool, the deaf, the mute, the dullard—always mindful of the great matter at hand. With time, you will surely gain something. Otherwise, if you persist in willfulness, rigid yet unyielding, erring yet unrepentant, though you spend a lifetime in the gate of the Dao, your hope of hearing the Dao will be in vain.

**The Barrier of Adversity**

The *Yi Jing* says: "Though in distress, one does not lose their place—this is prosperity. Is this not the noble person?" The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: "In plainness, one endures adversity; in action, one navigates adversity." Master Changchun said: "When ill, let illness teach you; when dying, let death teach you. Until the final moment, hold fast to the Dao and perish with it." All these speak of not altering one’s original resolve in the face of adversity.

The Dao encompasses heaven and earth, seizes the workings of creation, transcends life and death, and ascends from the mundane to the sacred, becoming a buddha or an immortal. Without great courage and great strength—a steadfast iron-willed person, a diamond-like being who transcends the dust—how could one bear its weight or wield its power?

What is great courage and great strength? Wealth and honor cannot corrupt it; poverty and lowliness cannot sway it; power and force cannot bend it—this is great strength. Love and attachment cannot entangle it; fame and profit cannot lure it—this is great strength. Sorrow and fear do not arise—this is great strength. Joy, anger, grief, and delight are utterly relinquished—this is great strength. Hardship and peril do not shake it—this is great courage. Illness and misfortune are accepted as natural—this is great courage. Hunger, cold, and starvation are endured to the death without change—this is great courage. Shame and humiliation are met with unawareness—this is great courage.

Thus, when the Buddha Śākyamuni encountered King Kali, he was dismembered yet felt no pain. Master Pure Yang faced the trials of Ancestor Zhengyang ten times without flaw. Master Ziqing endured scolding and was sent away without anger. Master Sanfeng wore tattered clothes and shoes without regret. Master Changzhen suffered blows without resistance. Master Changchun broke his ribs three times without concern. All these sages endured the trials of adversity, suffering endless hardships, and thus ultimately heard the great Dharma, understood the great Dao, transcended the mundane to become sacred, and accomplished their rare and exalted task.

Yet the world is full of muddled learners who do not recognize that adversity is the great medicine of cultivation and the forge and hammer of enlightenment. Instead, they fear and avoid adversity. Some, when faced with hunger and cold, devise other methods; others, when struck by illness, entertain deluded thoughts. Some, encountering danger, contemplate retreat; others, when humiliated, immediately quarrel.

Little do they know that true gold must be refined in great fire, and the lotus must grow from the mire. Without fire, the brilliance of gold cannot be revealed; without mud, the purity of the lotus cannot be seen. What harm is there in adversity? Only through adversity can one’s true stature be discerned; only through adversity can the authenticity of one’s resolve be tested.

I urge those who earnestly seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of adversity. Hold fast to the twin pillars of *xing* and *ming*—whether in life or in death, it is ever the same. All great calamities, great hardships, great perils, and great dangers should be entrusted to Heaven and met with a mind of non-attachment. In time, misfortune will naturally transform into fortune, and disaster into blessing.

Otherwise, if one fears adversity when it arises, the spirit becomes unsettled and the will wavers. Without adversity, one may yet bring it upon oneself; from small trials, great ones may arise. To then hope for enlightenment in the Dao would be most difficult.

The *Guai Zha* Barrier—
As the *Yi* says: [...]

"]—yet offerings are not made.

The *Book of Songs* says:
*The spirit’s approach—how can it be measured?
How could it be deceived?*

The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: *Enter through sincerity.*
The *Kinship of the Three* declares: *The filial son’s devotion moves the imperial pole.*
Master Shangyang says: *Though Heaven may oppose, seek it with treasures and utmost sincerity.*

All these speak of acting with a sincere heart, allowing no trace of deceit, cunning, or falsehood. Those who study the Dao must value true heart and genuine intent, humbling and lowering themselves—only then can they move a true teacher, earn the trust of good companions, and receive their benefits. For if I possess a true heart, my teacher and friends will respond with true hearts; if I hold sincere intent, they will meet me with sincerity. This mutual resonance is an unchanging principle.

Should one lack true heart and sincere intent, turning instead to deceit and falsehood—outwardly compliant but inwardly contrary, believing they can deceive the wise—know this: a true teacher’s discernment is clear and far-reaching; at a glance, they see through truth and falsehood. To deceive others is to deceive oneself; to conceal from others is to conceal from oneself. Not only does this bring no benefit, but it harms one’s progress. What use is deceit?

In this world, muddled students, muddled renunciates, and muddled Dao-seekers treat *xing* and *ming* as ordinary things, regard the study of the Dao as a common affair. Upon meeting a true teacher, they ask for the primal barrier; encountering fellow practitioners, they boast of profound mysteries. They neither understand the principle of honoring teachers nor the way of respecting friends. Some spout lies and deceptions with arrogance; others feign affection to adorn themselves. Some use clever words and pleasing expressions merely to win favor; others point east while drawing west, luring others into revealing their thoughts. Some recline while posing questions; others seek secrets over a single meal. Some sit and debate endlessly; others harbor resentment at the slightest trial. Some flee at the first hardship; others skim scriptures for general meaning, reading once and setting them aside. Some listen to a teacher’s words without savoring their depth, merely memorizing phrases. Some outwardly study the Dao while scheming for other ends; others claim to cultivate yet remain entangled in worldly attachments.

Such flaws are countless. How can they hope to receive guidance from a true teacher or support from good companions? I urge those who earnestly seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of deceit, replacing it with a heart of utmost sincerity. Proceed with steadfast honesty—never harbor the slightest cunning, for to deceive others is to deceive oneself and ruin one’s future.

The power of sincerity can move Heaven and Earth, communicate with spirits, and touch all beings. How could it fail to move teachers and friends? If it moves them, the great Dao may yet be attained. Otherwise, the slightest trace of falsehood or deceit corrupts the heart. A corrupted heart breeds grave illness within, not only preventing the pursuit of truth but obscuring it entirely. To then hope for enlightenment in the Dao would be most difficult.

**The Barrier of Speculation**

Ancient scriptures say: *Without a teacher’s guidance, even heavenly immortals have no abode.*
The *Awakening to Reality* states:
*Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a true teacher, do not guess wildly.*
And again:
*To know the oral secrets that connect to the primal,
You must discuss them carefully with immortals.*

Master Sanfeng says:
*The moon’s fullness lies in the oral secret;
The hour of zi’s arrival, in heart-transmission.*
And again:
*Bow to a wise teacher, inquire of the method—
Even then, to begin practice is already too late.*

All these declare that the Dao must be transmitted by a teacher; it cannot be known through reckless speculation or private conjecture. The great Dao is profoundly subtle—vast, it fills the cosmos; minute, it enters the tip of a hair. Boundless in its vastness, infinitesimal in its smallness. Those who cultivate it may seize the workings of creation, transcend yin and yang, complete *xing* and *ming*, become immortals or buddhas, endure as long as Heaven and Earth, and shine as brightly as the sun and moon. They precede Heaven yet do not defy it; they follow Heaven yet accord with its timing. This is no mere side path or heterodox teaching.

Yet the Dao encompasses inner and outer yin and yang, inner and outer Five Phases. It holds truth and falsehood—truth within falsehood, falsehood within truth, truth within truth, falsehood within falsehood. Cultivation involves fire times, sequences, effortful and effortless practices, orderly beginnings and endings, gathering the medicine, compounding it, forming the elixir, ingesting it, gestating the embryo, and shedding it. Its methods are manifold, its techniques varied. Without a wise teacher to distinguish each step from start to finish, how could one know them alone?

Though the perfected ones of the past and the alchemical classics employ a thousand metaphors and ten thousand descriptions—covering medicines, fire times, and all else—there are mysteries of the Dao and subtleties of practice that words cannot express, discussions cannot reach. Moreover, they use the tangible to illustrate the intangible, the visible to point to the invisible. Later generations of blind fools, borrowing the names of patriarchs, write recklessly, slander the sacred Dao, and confuse the immortal scriptures, mixing truth with falsehood.

If one relies on their own limited understanding, believing they have gained insight, and never verifies it with the wise, they will fall into the net and struggle to escape their whole life. Even with keen intelligence and discernment—able to distinguish right from wrong, truth from falsehood, and grasp some insight—they will still have beginnings without endings, seeming correctness without true certainty. How could they achieve genuine, unwavering knowledge that resolves all doubts?

Muddled students of the world do not grasp the depth of the Dao or the weight of *ming*. With the dim light of a firefly, they seek to pierce the vast net of delusion. They do not seek a true teacher but rely on themselves."

Some pore over heterodox and counterfeit texts, memorizing a few manipulative techniques, clinging to them for life with unshakable conviction, wasting their years in vain. Others encounter the authentic scriptures of the patriarchs, reciting them day and night without plumbing their meaning, taking only their surface forms. When they see talk of medicinal substances and crucibles, they suspect alchemy; when they see references to male and female, yin and yang, they guess at bedroom arts; when they see dragons and tigers, tortoises and serpents, they assume it concerns the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs; when they see descriptions of inversion and reverse circulation, they imagine ascent in the back and descent in the front; when they see mention of the precious pearl, they suppose it a tangible object; when they see the sacred embryo, they guess it the coagulation of qi and blood; when they see teachings on purity and stillness, they suspect it means preserving spirit and regulating breath; when they see talk of "having activity," they assume it means contrivance; when they see talk of "non-activity," they assume it means emptiness and quiescence. Such misguided guesses are too numerous to list. All are mere shots in the dark, ultimately leading to delusion.

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of conjecture. Cast aside the talents and tricks you have prided yourself on all your life, and seek a true teacher to illuminate the profound mysteries. Never rely on your own false cleverness to speculate and surmise, deceiving yourself. Otherwise, failing to verify with others and relying solely on yourself, you will either search fruitlessly without or contrive uselessly within, making the cultivation of the Dao all but impossible.

The *Suspended Void Pass*:
The Confucian says: *"Truly tread the path of practice."*
The Buddhist says: *"When practicing the profound prajñā-pāramitā."*
The Daoist says: *"Advance with courage and vigor."*
The sages of the Three Teachings all value genuine effort and real application, not empty or insubstantial deeds.

The path of cultivating the real is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling one’s nature, and attaining destiny. To exhaust principle is to thoroughly investigate this reality; to fulfill one’s nature is to fully realize this reality; to attain destiny is to arrive at this reality. Since exhausting, fulfilling, and attaining all pertain to this reality, it is clear that not even the slightest falsity can be mixed in. If even the slightest falsity is mixed in, the mind will not be single, and one’s practice will lack power. How then can one penetrate the treasury of principle and perceive the true treasure? How can one move a true teacher to joy and receive their guidance on the path?

Thus, the sages of old, upon hearing a single good word or witnessing a single good deed, would embrace it like the bursting of the Yangtze or the Yellow River—irresistible in its force. The Daoist gate has teachings of the Three Vehicles. Those who pursue the Supreme Vehicle are people of superior wisdom, easily awakened, resolving all doubts at once. They are born knowing and act with ease. Those who pursue the Middle Vehicle are people of average wisdom, who grasp meaning through images and understand two things upon hearing one. They learn and then know, act with advantage. Those who pursue the Lower Vehicle are people of lesser wisdom, who must study with great effort and only succeed after deep practice. They learn through struggle and act with difficulty. The teachings of the Three Vehicles are to be practiced according to one’s capacity. Yet though they are divided into three grades, all require earnest effort on solid ground. If one remains insubstantial and detached, paying no heed, not only will those of average and lesser capacity make no progress, but even the highly gifted will fall into emptiness and loss.

Of old, Bodhidharma labored beneath the long reed hut and sat in cold stillness at Shaolin; Huineng served at Huangmei and endured grinding trials at Sihui; Qiu the Patriarch spent seven years at Longmen and six at Panxi, breaking his body and fracturing his ribs, his resolve and vigor redoubled. All these sages and worthies acted with true heart and sincere intent, and thus transcended the ordinary to enter sagehood, accomplishing the great task.

Yet the muddled students of the world, having entered the Daoist gate, know not what they are about, drifting through their days in confusion. They are forever calculating their next meal, moving in and out of right and wrong, keeping company with foxes and dogs, their mouths full of idle chatter, their minds full of trivialities. Their eyes do not see the patriarchs’ teachings, their ears do not hear the good words of the enlightened. Even if they recite the scriptures, it is like galloping past flowers—they never apply their minds to search out the profound meaning. Even if they encounter an enlightened teacher and hear their instruction, it is like the autumn wind passing their ears—they never exert themselves to savor its flavor.

There is yet another class of foolish, sinful men who believe the alchemical classics contain no oral transmissions and disdain to study them. Should they chance upon an enlightened person, they seek to seize the Dao with their bare hands. Failing to obtain it, they immediately retreat.

Today they seek Wang, tomorrow they bow to Li—now studying this, now studying that, their resolve unsettled, their aspirations fleeting. When have they ever treated life and nature as the great matter? Spending their whole lives in the gate of the Dao, they end with no accomplishment—how lamentable, how pitiful!

I urge those who truly seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of vain imaginings. Settle the mind, plant the feet firmly, and daily attend to life and nature; at all times, focus intent on principle and meaning. Correct every vain and insincere behavior one by one. First exhaust the principles, then seek a teacher. Study broadly, inquire carefully, reflect cautiously, discern clearly, and practice earnestly. What fear is there that the great Dao will not be understood, that life and nature will not be fulfilled?

Otherwise, indulging in vain imaginings and reckless conduct, squandering the years, the mind unfocused, the will unsteady—how can one hope to understand the Dao? How can one hope to awaken to reality?

*Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Within the dim and indistinct, seek the image of being;
Within the deep and obscure, find the true essence.
From this mutual interpenetration of being and non-being,
How can mere wishing bring it to fruition?"*

It also says:
*"The true discourse of the classics and songs is expounded,
Yet the firing times are not set down in writing.
To know where the oral instructions connect,
One must discuss them carefully with the spirit."*

The Perfected of Great Emptiness says:
*"What others speak of, they cannot practice;
What I practice, I cannot speak of."*
All this speaks of the Dao requiring true knowledge and real practice—it cannot be attained through empty, vain imaginings.

The Dao is most revered and most noble, loftiest and greatest, deepest and most profound. One must apply effort with meticulous discernment, advancing from the shallow to the deep, from the near to the far, attaining mastery through deep cultivation. How can one hope to understand it through a few words or phrases, or achieve it in a step or two?

This supreme and vast endeavor requires a supreme and vast person to accomplish it. The Dao exists between heaven and earth—everyone has a share in it, yet no one can grasp it.

That everyone has a share means that all people are endowed with the qi of yin and yang and the Five Agents at birth; within the body, the principles of yin and yang and the Five Agents reside, making humans the chief of the ten thousand things, possessing both principle and qi. Who lacks the Dao? Who lacks life and nature? With this Dao, with this life and nature, one can fulfill the Dao and perfect life and nature, becoming a sage or worthy, an immortal or buddha. This is what is meant by "everyone has a share."

That no one can grasp it means that people are deluded by worldly affairs, confused by fame and profit, entangled by love and attachment. They mistake the false for the true, fail to rouse their resolve, cannot summon their spirit, and do not apply effort. Following their desires, they let the discriminating mind wreak havoc. Just as they resolve to advance, they retreat; just as they intend to do good, they think of doing evil. This is what is meant by "no one can grasp it."

If one is truly a person of resolve, valuing life and nature above all, discerning matters with clarity, advancing courageously, unwavering from beginning to end, with firm resolve and steadfast aspiration—exhausting principles, seeking teachers and friends, practicing with sincerity, taking each step as it comes, accomplishing each task as it is done, never slackening day or night, applying the mind at every moment, attending only to one’s own affairs without presuming upon others’, accumulating merit and virtue, humbling oneself and honoring others—then, whether one understands or achieves the Dao, one leaves it to nature, following heavenly conditions, never indulging in vain imaginings. Even if in this life one has no merit or virtue, no good fortune, and the great Dao remains obscure, one does not blame heaven or resent others, persisting until death.

Such is the resolve and aspiration one must hold—then the patriarchs will arrange matters in secret.

The muddled students of the world, who have not even settled their own affairs, drift through days in confusion, seeking only fine food and clothing. By day they wander idly; by night they sleep soundly. They perform no acts of kindness, accumulate no merit, refuse to discern principles, and will not seek an enlightened teacher. They learn only superficial phrases, affect refined postures, and make a show of cultivation. Falsely pretending to practice, they vainly hope to become immortals.

Little do they know that the study of life and nature possesses the power to seize the transformations of creation and the method to reverse the workings of heaven and earth. It must be transmitted heart-to-heart—it cannot be guessed at privately or practiced recklessly. Those who obtain the truth and cultivate accordingly can walk with heaven as their companion and earth as their counterpart. How can such knowledge be ordinary, such understanding be easy?

Since ancient times, the perfected patriarchs who achieved realization endured untold hardships before meeting a true teacher; they endured untold trials before hearing the Dao; they passed through untold dangers before achieving the Dao. How can one hope to understand or achieve it without real effort, through empty, vain imaginings?

Empty, vain imaginings—this single thought is the root of failure to understand the Dao. If the Dao cannot even be understood, how can one hope to achieve it?

I urge those who truly seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of vain imaginings. Stabilize the foundation, and whether learning or practicing the Dao, apply effort at every step, practice at every moment. Naturally, bitterness will turn to sweetness. Those who have not yet heard the Dao will hear it; those who have heard it will achieve it.

Otherwise, without real effort, words unmatched by deeds, deeds unguided by words—how difficult it is to understand the Dao through vain imaginings!

**The Barrier of Life and Death**
Zhuangzi says:
*"The true person of old did not delight in life nor detest death.
Their going forth brought no joy; their return, no resistance.
They came and went with effortless ease."*

The Supreme Sage said:
*"If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening."*

The postscript to *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"This Dao is most wondrous and subtle. The root-nature of worldly people is dull and deluded; clinging to their bodies, they detest death and delight in life, and thus they can scarcely awaken."*

All this speaks to the necessity, in learning and cultivating the Dao, of relinquishing the mind that clings to life and fears death. Since humans are born with a body, it is but a temporary aggregation of the Four Elements, an illusion arising from nothingness, a fleeting form bestowed by Heaven and Earth. Where there is birth, there must be death; where there is success, there must be failure. How can this be a truly indestructible thing? Since it is destructible, then life and death are also illusory. The ancestral masters taught people to transcend life and death, guiding them to equalize life and death until they reach the state of neither life nor death. As Zhuangzi said: *"Gather the spirit to attain long life; forget the spirit to attain no-life."* Yet even the path of long life does not represent the ultimate achievement in realizing one’s nature and destiny. Only by forgetting life and attaining no-life, neither arising nor ceasing, does one truly transcend life and death, stepping beyond the transformations of life and death.

For Heaven and Earth can govern the formed but not the formless; they can govern the qi-filled but not the qi-less; they can govern the mindful but not the mindless. Without mind, there is no qi; without qi, there is no form. Free the mind from life and death, and life and death cannot burden you—this is near to the Dao.

Yet deluded students of the Dao, vainly seeking to attain it, are all driven by the fear of death. Fear of death gives rise to the desire for life. With this desire, one fears death by starvation, by freezing, by illness, or by premature demise. One climbs a great mountain and fears wolves and tigers; one enters dense forests and fears pythons and venomous snakes; one lodges in ancient altars and fears ghosts and malevolent spirits. The mind clinging to life and fearing death lurks in the depths, causing constant alarm and unease. Though the body remains, the heart is already lost; the sprout of vital qi withers, and the

Should one possess but a shallow grasp of the gate and portal, then grow complacent and self-satisfied, believing the Dao to reside therein—eyes raised to the heavens, scorning all others, never seeking further instruction—how could one ever penetrate beginning and end, traverse freely in all directions, unobstructed and unrestrained, and reach the sacred realm?

Among the muddled students of the world, some rely on their own cleverness, recklessly speculating and conjecturing, self-assured and unwilling to seek others. Some boast of vast learning, engaging in lofty discourse, self-satisfied and unwilling to seek others. Some stumble upon minor arts of side gates, unable to discern right from wrong, self-important and unwilling to verify. Some encounter a master’s guidance, learn the threshold, and grow content, unwilling to delve deeper. Then there are those driven by worldly ambition, pedantic scholars clutching their books, puffing out their chests, fearing ridicule and refusing to humble themselves. All such types are harmed by their own fullness—how could they ever heed the profound teachings of a true master, enter the grand thoroughfare, or ascend the halls of the sages?

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao: swiftly break through the barrier of self-satisfaction. Lower your heart and humble your spirit, adopting the demeanor of one who considers themselves inferior to others. Regardless of age, wisdom, worthiness, status, or rank, show reverence to all, making no distinctions. Should you encounter someone with even the slightest strength, earnestly seek their instruction without fail. Study widely and inquire thoroughly—every person is your teacher, every place a school. How could you then fail to clarify the principles and accomplish the Dao?

Otherwise, self-satisfied and swollen with false fullness, even if a true master wished to guide you, there would be no opening for entry. To vainly hope for enlightenment would be difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of Fearing Difficulty**
The *Yi* says: "The noble person cultivates virtue, accumulating small steps to reach great heights." The Supreme Sage said: "The noble person follows the Dao, but if they abandon it halfway, I cannot rest." Qiuzu said: "Nothing in the world is difficult—only fear the one with resolve." All these speak to the necessity of unwavering determination in cultivating the Dao, without the heart of fearing difficulty.

The most difficult matters in the world are also the greatest. To accomplish the greatest matters, one must exert the greatest effort. If something is utterly easy, accomplished in a single attempt, then it must be small and not great. The study of life and destiny is a great matter—it encompasses all things, transcends humanity and heaven, escapes the five phases, and departs the three realms. It establishes its essence before heaven and earth, and manifests its function after them. To become a sage, an immortal, or a buddha—how vast is this endeavor!

Yet to undertake such a great matter, to forge an eternal and indestructible enterprise—how could it not be difficult? However, knowing its difficulty and yet not fearing it, taking life and death as a single great matter, establishing firm resolve, and never wavering until death—this is how one can clarify and practice the Dao, turning the difficult into the effortless.

But if one knows the difficulty and fears it, not regarding life and destiny as a great matter, beginning with diligence but ending in laziness, resolve and focus divided, half in doubt and half in faith, hesitating and retreating—then not only will one fail to practice the Dao, but one will also fail to understand it. The difficult will remain forever difficult.

Of old, Shen Guang severed his arm to seek the Dharma and received the mind-to-mind transmission from Bodhidharma. Wang Zhongli stood in snow three feet deep and ultimately received the guidance of Master Yichuan. Qiuzu purified his body and broke his ribs, and the spirits responded to his sincerity. When one wholeheartedly seeks the Dao, single-minded and unwavering, they can move heaven and earth, communicate with ghosts and spirits—how much more so with people?

Yet the muddled students of the world, unaware that life and destiny are the foremost great matters of human existence, hope to gain some skill and immediately become immortals; they vainly study minor vehicles, expecting not to die. Hearing that the sacred Dao is profound and requires deep inquiry, they immediately find it difficult. Hearing that the path of cultivation is long, demanding self-sacrifice and unflinching endurance of hunger and cold, they retreat. Hearing that the Dao has a beginning and end, that practice has layers and stages, that fire has its times and moments, that it is exceedingly subtle—immediately their resolve falters.

Such students of the Dao, wavering and indecisive, lacking strength in the four elements and lacking vigor in their spirit—how could they ever taste the flavor of the Dao? Would they not squander the great matter?

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao: swiftly break through the barrier of fearing difficulty. Forge a heart of iron and stone. Spare no hardship, advance with fierce determination, forgetting sleep and food. Regardless of whether you gain strength or see results, persist with ever greater effort over ever greater distance, advancing single-mindedly—you will surely attain, turning the difficult into the effortless.

Otherwise, fearing difficulty and lacking resolve, wavering between presence and absence, speaking with the mouth but not acting with the body, desiring to advance but immediately retreating—vainly hoping for enlightenment would be difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of Disrespect**
The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: "Great is the Way of the sage! Overflowing, it nurtures all things, towering to the heavens—vast and abundant indeed. The three hundred rituals and three thousand rules of conduct await the right person to be enacted." The Old Master said: "Between heaven and earth, only the Dao is supreme." The *Fu Ming* chapter says:
*There is something before heaven and earth,*
*Nameless, the root of stillness and solitude.*
*It can be the master of all phenomena,*
*Unchanging through the four seasons.*

All these speak of the Dao’s utmost greatness and supremacy—it is not for the unworthy to practice.

The Dao as Dao is boundless and immeasurable, infinitely profound. Utterly formless yet containing all forms, utterly empty yet containing all reality—without shape, it gives birth to form; without image, it gives birth to all phenomena. It encompasses heaven and earth, moves the sun and moon, governs the four seasons, and nurtures the ten thousand things. There is no place it does not exist, no thing it does not reside within.

Of old, Confucius attained it and became the sage of the Ru tradition...

Shakyamuni attained it and became the progenitor of all buddhas; Laozi attained it and became the patriarch of all immortals; the Yellow Emperor attained it and rode a dragon to ascend to heaven; Nüwa attained it and smelted stones to mend the sky; Master Jingyang attained it and lifted his entire residence to ascend in broad daylight; the Heavenly Master attained it and divided men from ghosts; the Fifth Patriarch attained it and realized the rank of celestial immortal; the Seven Perfected attained it and became neither born nor extinguished. From ancient times to the present, the sage-worthies who have attained the Dao are too numerous to count, their records clear and verifiable. Such is the supreme honor and nobility of the Dao—how could one treat it with disdain or carelessness?

If one regards it as a trivial matter and treats it with disdain or carelessness, then one is not a vessel capable of bearing the Dao but rather a turncoat who betrays it—how could such a person be spoken to of the Dao? For to disdain the Dao is to assume that learning it is easy and thus fail to delve deeply; to treat it carelessly is to assume that practicing it is inconsequential and thus fail to advance with perseverance. Without deep entry or steady progress, by what means could one cultivate and accomplish this rare and precious endeavor under heaven?

Therefore, those who study the Dao must first recognize that the Dao is the most honorable and noble of all things—it cannot be easily known or casually attained. Only then can one muster fierce determination, apply relentless effort, and persevere without slackening until the Dao is achieved.

Yet in this world, there are muddled learners who do not understand that the Dao is treasured by heaven and earth and cherished by ghosts and spirits. They treat it with disdain and carelessness, utterly lacking sincerity. Some rely on their own petty cleverness, believing they can grasp it through sudden insight; others memorize a few heterodox Chan phrases, assuming the Dao lies therein; some chase after illusions, believing they have gained true knowledge; others mistake a deer for a horse, believing they have attained genuine vision. When questioned by a wise person, they speak boastfully without shame or sincerity; when examined by fellow Dao-seekers, they argue stubbornly without restraint.

There are also those wicked-tongued demonic types who, upon hearing others speak of the Dao, immediately slander it; upon seeing others read scriptures, immediately despise them. They dismiss the classics and canons of the sages as mere superficial trappings and regard the accumulated merits and deeds of the devoted as inferior, trivial matters. When they encounter a master, they refuse to humble themselves, instead assuming the airs of a superior. Even if they momentarily lower their heads, they cannot endure the passage of time or withstand the trials of refinement.

Little do they realize that seeking a teacher in the study of the Dao is to seek someone to save one’s very life. To seek a teacher to save one’s life, one must first resemble someone who truly values life. Only then can one, if enlightened, move a true master to offer guidance or, if in obscurity, move ghosts and spirits to provide support. If one does not resemble someone who values life, one does not regard the Great Dao as noble. And if one does not revere the Great Dao, how can one ever hear of it? Is this not the height of folly?

I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of disdain and carelessness. Believe in the Dao with unwavering faith, treat your life with utmost seriousness, honor your teacher with reverence, and proceed with caution and diligence, ever vigilant, your feet firmly planted, never daring to harbor even a trace of disdain or carelessness. Ascend the mountain step by step with effort; cross the great river moment by moment with caution—what worry is there that you will not reach the shore of the Dao?

Otherwise, if one remains ignorant of the Dao’s loftiness and nobility, treating it as if it were nothing, indulging in laziness, herding sheep or gathering firewood while vainly hoping to comprehend the Dao—how difficult it will be!

In the *Doctrine of the Mean*, it is said: *"The Dao is not far from man, but those who pursue the Dao make it distant."* The Most Sage said: *"Is there anyone who, for a single day, has exerted their strength toward benevolence? I have never seen one whose strength was insufficient."* *Wuzhen pian* states: *"The great elixir is not sought but chanced upon; to encounter it and not refine it is foolishness."* An ancient scripture says: *"The Dao does not act of itself; it awaits man to act."* All these speak of the necessity of cultivating the Dao with courage and vigor, never with weakness or slackness.

Man is born endowed with the upright *qi* of heaven and earth’s yin and yang and the Five Phases, standing at the head of the ten thousand things. Regardless of whether one is noble or base, wise or foolish, firm or yielding, strong or weak, all possess the complete work of heaven and earth and thus can bear the great Dao of heaven and earth.

Thus, even the ignorant among husbands and wives may partake in understanding, and the unworthy among them may practice the Way. It lies solely in whether one has resolve or not. With resolve, the yielding may transform into the firm and strong, and through firmness and strength, one may gradually ascend to the shore of the Dao. Without resolve, even the firm and strong may become yielding and weak, and in weakness, one cannot transcend the sea of suffering.

What is called *resolve* is unyielding determination and decisive action. With such unyielding and decisive resolve, worldly affairs cannot stain you, affection cannot entangle you, selfish desires cannot arise, fame and profit cannot tempt you, wealth and nobility cannot corrupt you, poverty and lowliness cannot sway you, and hardship and adversity cannot move you. You know only the Dao and nothing else; you attend only to your nature and life, disregarding all else. All things external to the body cannot obstruct you. Thus, you may hear the Dao and cultivate the Dao.

Without unyielding and decisive resolve, worldly affairs cannot be seen through, affection cannot be cast off, and selfish desires cannot be swept away. Wealth and nobility stir the heart, poverty and lowliness shift the will, and adversity is unbearable. One dwells in illusory realms without recognizing their falsity, abides in the sea of suffering without knowing its bitterness. Even if the mind of the Dao briefly arises, without the vigor of firm resolve, it flickers and vanishes. Fearful of wolves ahead and tigers behind, anxious about hunger and cold, dreading toil and exhaustion, and doubting whether the cultivation of the Dao will succeed—such hesitation and indecision, weakness and timidity, waste the present moment, defer action, and leave one wavering. How then can one study the Dao, hear the Dao, or practice the Dao?

Among the muddled students of the world who claim to study the Dao, few resemble true cultivators. They vainly hope to hear the Dao yet do nothing to seek it. In the twelve hours of a day, when have they ever devoted a single moment to the care of body, mind, nature, and life? Instead, they discuss clothing and food, gossip about right and wrong, chase excitement, and vie for victory. Every action and movement is no different from that of ordinary people; their conduct is indistinguishable from the vulgar. When profit beckons, they worm their way forward; when effort is required, they shrink back and retreat. They seek joy amid suffering and act as if in a dream. They feign strength in trivial matters but are utterly powerless in true work. They never reflect: wearing the robes of the Dao, donning the headscarf of the Dao, consuming the offerings of the ten directions—is this not a great opportunity to attend to one’s true affairs? Yet they slacken and falter, squandering years in vain, accumulating debts without merit, and enjoying undeserved rewards. How can such a burden be lifted?

Moreover, this matter of cultivating the real does not demand great physical exertion or reckless labor. It requires only a single, enduring thought in the heart and unyielding resolve to achieve success. Śākyamuni Buddha was not descended from heaven, Laozi was not sprouted from the earth, and Confucius was not formed from the wind. They shared the same senses and flesh as others, having first fulfilled human effort before attaining sagehood. Thus, Mencius said: *"Yao and Shun were the same as other men."* For sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas are all cultivated from humanity. Everyone may become a sage or worthy, everyone may become an immortal or buddha. The only hindrance is weakness and incapacity, the refusal to establish firm resolve.

I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of timidity. Steady your staff, rouse your courageous resolve, fortify your enduring mind, and stride forward with single-minded determination. At every moment, attend to your nature and life; at every step, delve into the principles of the Dao. If you do not know, strive to know; if you do not understand, labor to understand.

If you encounter an enlightened teacher, approach them with single-minded sincerity in your study. Do not vainly crave secret oral instructions, nor hastily inquire after esoteric transmissions. Whatever they teach—whether to endure suffering, face death, or bear hunger—you must comply without hesitation. Even if subjected to blows, scoldings, or trials, accept them all with joy, harboring not the slightest resentment or hatred. Only then can you achieve success. For only by enduring what others cannot endure can you attain what others cannot attain; only by suffering what others cannot suffer can you know what others cannot know. Otherwise, if you remain weak and your yang qi unaroused, you will lack the strength to bear the great Dao. To vainly seek enlightenment under such conditions is difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of Inconstancy**
The *Yi Jing* states: *"If one does not maintain constancy in virtue, humiliation may befall them."* The Supreme Sage said: *"A person without constancy cannot even be a shaman or physician."* Zisi said: *"Without perfect virtue, the perfect Dao will not coalesce."* Mencius said: *"The noble person deepens their cultivation through the Dao, seeking to attain it through their own effort."* Yuanduzi said: *"Those who study the Complete Reality tradition may receive a teacher’s brief guidance on the path, yet remain ignorant of its step-by-step practices; they may know that spirit and qi depend on each other, yet not understand the union of lead and mercury; they may understand the union of lead and mercury, yet not grasp the merging of nature and life. They recklessly imitate the firing times, advancing and retreating without knowledge—all such efforts come to naught."* The ancient scriptures say: *"Without shared language, there is no kinship; without sufficient effort, there is no perfection."* All this speaks to the necessity of long-lasting resolve in cultivating the Dao and establishing virtue.

The practice of the true Dao is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining life. To exhaust principle is to do so until not a shred of doubt remains, until nothing is unknown—only then is there great awakening and thorough comprehension. When knowledge is true and perception is clear, principle becomes luminous. To fulfill nature is to do so until not a trace of temperament or selfish desire remains—only then can one be empty and vast. Unobscured in clarity, unconfused in darkness, nature is then fully realized. To attain life is to transcend yin and yang, leap beyond the five phases—only then can one’s efforts be wholly transformed, immovable and unshaken, free and self-directed, and life is then established.

Yet the work of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining life is not the labor of a single morning or evening. It requires the establishment of enduring resolve and the practice of enduring effort to truly illuminate principle, fulfill nature, and attain life, abiding within the transformations of creation without being constrained by them. Such an undertaking, which does not change over time, demands effort that likewise does not cease. Every perfected one of the past achieved this by establishing enduring resolve and applying enduring effort.

Consider even the minor skills of the world: one must concentrate the mind and devote the will, heed the teacher’s instruction, and practice for many years before achieving mastery and adaptability. How much more so for the great matter of nature and life—how can the inconstant hope to comprehend it?

Worldly deluded students do not know what principle is; they cling to empty appearances and trivial tasks, calling this "understanding principle." They do not know what nature is; they speculate that nature resides in the Heavenly Valley or that spirit dwells in the head, calling this "cultivating nature." They do not know what life is; they suspect it lies in the cinnabar field or the sea of qi, and that fixing intention in the lower origin is "cultivating life." Alas! To call such things principle, nature, and life, and vainly hope for liberation and immortality, is like climbing a tree to seek fish or squeezing the eyes to conjure flowers—what real benefit can there be? If one does not even know principle, nature, and life, how can one aspire to transcendence?

Even among those few students who can distinguish the deviant from the orthodox and discern right from wrong, many vainly seek quick attainment and hasten for results. Over time, they grow lax, lacking enduring resolve and steadfast commitment. They advance and retreat, start and stop, now eager to proceed, now shrinking back, wavering and uncertain. How can such people ever perceive the true essence within the inner sanctum?

I urge those who sincerely study the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of inconstancy. Establish enduring resolve, apply effort without cease, and do not waver with divided intentions or abandon the path halfway. The longer you persist, the more strength you will gain; the greater the difficulty, the more bitter the struggle—yet in the end, there will come a moment of fulfillment. Otherwise, if you begin with diligence but end in negligence, if your words and deeds do not align, and you vainly claim to have attained the Dao, success will be difficult indeed.

**The Barrier of Self-Abandonment**
The Supreme Sage said: *"To hear the Dao in the morning, one could die that evening."* Yanzi said: *"Shun was a man, and I am a man—those who strive can be like him."* Mencius said: *"One who harms themselves cannot be spoken to; one who abandons themselves cannot act."* The Old Master said: *"I am not a sage; I attained this through learning."* Shangyangzi said: *"Śākyamuni, upon hearing half a verse of the Buddha’s teaching, was willing to sacrifice his body; the Yellow Emperor, humbly following the wind and crawling on his knees, asked Guangchengzi how to govern the body so as to attain longevity."* All these exemplify self-respect and self-regard, never self-harm or self-abandonment.

Humans receive the qi of heaven, earth, and the five phases to form their bodies. With qi comes nature, and with nature comes life. Principle, qi, nature, and life all reside within the body. Regardless of wisdom or foolishness, high or low status, all share the same principle and qi, the same nature and life. There is no inherent difference between sages and ordinary people—only those who comprehend nature and life become sages, while those who do not remain ordinary. This is what Mencius meant when he said: *"That by which humans differ from birds and beasts is slight; the common people cast it aside, while the noble person preserves it."*

The Immortal Tradition states: *"Since ancient times, three thousand have ascended in flight, eight hundred have raised their households, and those who departed seated or standing are beyond count."*

All these are those who learn to know and endure to achieve—there are none who, without learning and without enduring hardship, can know or accomplish. In the world, those born with knowledge are few, while those who learn to know are many. Even those said to be born with knowledge may stumble into confusion with a single misstep. Without learning, there is no achievement; only through learning can one succeed. Thus, Śākyamuni also had to study under Dīpaṃkara; Confucius also had to study under Xiang Tuo; Laozi also had to study under the Primordial Beginning. As for the patriarchs—Yuzhong, Lü, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Shi, Xue, Chen, Bai, and others—they all transmitted the lineage in unbroken succession, passing teachings mouth to mouth. From this, it is clear that one can succeed only through learning, and without learning, one cannot succeed. How great, then, is the power of learning!

Yet the world is full of deluded learners who do not value their own nature and life, who do not cultivate their own body and mind. They dwell within the Dao yet do not recognize that they possess it; they reside in a forest of treasures yet do not know the jewels before them. They mistake the false for the real, take emptiness for substance. Some say that the length of life is fixed by fate and cannot be altered by human effort; others claim that immortals and sages are born, not made, and cannot be attained by ordinary people; still others assert that the Great Dao is too profound and mysterious for common minds to grasp. Thus, they abandon themselves, set limits for themselves, willingly remain in the sea of suffering, and sink into perdition—all in vain as human beings. Little do they realize that, as humans, bearing yin and embracing yang, they partake in the creative power of Heaven and Earth. Every person can become a sage, every person can attain the ranks of immortals and buddhas—provided they advance with utmost sincerity, humble themselves to seek instruction, proceed from the near to the far, and persevere without slackening.

Consider the foxes, apes, and deer of the mountains—mere beasts, yet by preserving spirit and nurturing qi, dwelling in stillness within their dens, they accumulate years of deep practice and gain the power to conceal their forms, transform themselves, and prolong their lives. How much more so for humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings—how could they fail to attain the Dao? To say that humans cannot achieve the Dao is to claim they are inferior to beasts!

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of self-abandonment. Stand firm in unchanging resolve, sweep away all the biases of temperament and the burdens of habit accumulated since birth. Devote yourself wholeheartedly to the pursuit of the Dao, tempering yourself through hardship and adversity. Those who do not know must strive to learn; those who cannot must strive to become able. Reform your faults, cultivate sincerity, dispel delusion, and remain steadfast to the end without wavering—only then may the Great Dao be attained. Otherwise, if you abandon yourself, fail to value your nature and life, and scorn the worth of the Dao and righteousness, drifting through days in a daze, living as if drunk or dreaming, you will pass through life in vain. Once you lose this human form, it will be ten thousand kalpas before you regain it.

The Most Sagely One said: *"A scholar who is devoted to the Dao yet ashamed of coarse clothing and poor food is not worth discussing."* Our Patriarch Qiu said: *"Every grain of rice and every coin is the blood and fat of farmers—how can one accept them without merit?"* Both teach that learners must hold the Dao in the highest regard and not seek clothing and food by improper means.

Those who cultivate the Dao do so for the sake of their nature and life. Though this body has not yet departed the dusty world, one cannot do without clothing and food, but one must not allow such concerns to obstruct the great matter of nature and life. Since ancient times, the patriarchs have taught people to act according to their station: if born into wealth and nobility, act accordingly; if born into poverty and lowliness, act accordingly. There is no need to beg for clothing and food from all directions. Because those of superior wisdom are few while those of middling and lesser capacity are many, methods of practice vary in ease and difficulty, and teachings are adapted to each person’s capacity.

Those of superior wisdom possess great stature and great power. They may dwell in the marketplace or the court, amidst wealth and nobility, yet remain unstained by it. Without relying on others, they ascend directly to the shore of the Dao. But those of middling or lesser capacity, with limited stature and strength, cannot manage everything at once. If they remain in wealth and nobility, they will be burdened by it and hindered in the great matter. Thus, they are taught to leave behind wealth and nobility, endure humiliation, beg for alms, live according to conditions, temper their minds and refine their qi through hardship, and build their practice on solid ground.

There are also those of superior wisdom who, disdaining wealth and nobility, cast off worldly attachments and willingly embrace poverty. With a single robe and a single bowl, they wander and beg to sustain themselves, practicing in secret and refining themselves in obscurity, making progress with ease. In all these cases, they do not fix their minds on clothing and food but merely borrow the support of others to temporarily nourish this body of flesh.

Yet the world is full of deluded learners who do not realize that the blood and sweat of others cannot be lightly accepted in vain. They abandon the great matter of their nature and life, making clothing and food their priority. They beg from the east and seek from the west, filling their bellies and warming their bodies, yet do no real work, wandering idly about, never reflecting on why they left the household life. Unable to repay the kindness of their parents’ nurture or the grace of the sovereign and the land, they accumulate debts to all—how will they ever settle them?

Worse still are those sinful men who don the cap of the Dao yet harbor the heart of a thief. They scheme for clothing and food, deceiving others by various means: some steal from people under the guise of borrowing; others feign wisdom to receive offerings; still others exploit temple-building to profit from the good. Today they enter a benefactor’s home to beg for money, tomorrow they seek out the virtuous to beg for rice. They swindle and cheat, gamble and drink, eat meat and indulge in excess, racking up debts to all—how will they ever repay them? As our Patriarch Qiu said: *"A pair of horns may or may not appear, but the tail is certain to remain."*

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of accumulated debts. Live according to conditions to sustain yourself, nurture your body with simplicity. For every thread and every coin, remember how difficult they are to come by.

Every sip and every bite must remind you of the hardship in their attainment. Exert yourself at all times, advance with each step, and strive without cease until you achieve the Dao and perfect your virtue. When you truly reach the state of Dao perfected and virtue complete, not only will the debts owed to all quarters dissolve, but even the karmic hindrances accumulated since time immemorial will be erased in a single stroke. Then you shall wear the celestial robes and partake of the celestial emoluments—how much more so the things of this dusty world?

Otherwise, if you only know how to accumulate debts but not how to dissolve them, only how to defer repayment but not how to settle accounts, lacking merit and conduct, your sins will pile up like mountains. To vainly hope for enlightenment in such a state is difficult indeed.

The *Daodejing* of the Lofty Barrier says: *"The rigid and strong belong to the company of the dead; the soft and weak belong to the company of the living."* Mencius says: *"One who respects others is constantly respected by others; one who loves others is constantly loved by others."* The proverb goes: *"Those who set out into the world from a young age with arrogance find it hard to move even an inch."* All these speak of the need for self-effacement and humility, and the danger of self-aggrandizement and pride.

What is meant by "lofty and great"? It is to claim sageliness for oneself and act with overbearing strength, to be rigid and competitive, to see only oneself and no others. Only those who do not exalt themselves will ultimately attain true exaltation; only those who do not aggrandize themselves will ultimately attain true greatness. Why is this so? Those who do not exalt themselves can humble themselves before others; those who do not aggrandize themselves can make themselves small before others. Able to humble and make themselves small, they appear as if they are nothing, seem as if they are empty. Though they possess talent, they do not flaunt it; though they possess wisdom, they do not employ it. They conceal their abilities and display incompetence. Though they are inherently knowledgeable, they feign ignorance. In dealing with the world, they bring joy to all; in pursuing the Dao, they please both teachers and friends.

Of old, Yu would bow upon hearing good words; Zilu would rejoice when told of his faults. Both practiced self-effacement and humility, never exalting or aggrandizing themselves. Thus they became great sages and worthies, their names enduring through the ages. However, the practice of not exalting or aggrandizing oneself must be carried out with sincerity and genuine intent to be of any avail. If one merely feigns humility and smallness outwardly while harboring arrogance inwardly, it is like hiding soldiers in ambush—inner and outer do not align, the heart is not true, and the conduct will not endure. Outwardly reverent but inwardly disrespectful, this is what is meant by *"clever words and an ingratiating countenance—rarely are they benevolent."* Not only will this fail to cure the malady of self-exaltation, but it will instead breed the disease of hidden calamity.

Thus, only when one does not exalt oneself will one eventually forget what exaltation is; only when one does not aggrandize oneself will one eventually forget what greatness is. Only then will the malady of self-exaltation be entirely transformed. The patriarchs of past dynasties and the perfected beings of former times all cultivated the Dao and established virtue on the path of self-effacement and humility, persisting without slack. Thus they accomplished great deeds and ultimately surpassed what others could not.

Yet among the muddle-headed learners of the world, some in secular life possess wealth, status, or power and refuse to humble themselves before others; some rely on talent, learning, or scholarship and refuse to humble themselves before others; some depend on their advanced age or seniority and refuse to humble themselves before others. Among those in the Dao, some memorize a few volumes of alchemical texts, consider themselves enlightened, and refuse to humble themselves before others; some practice a few methods, pride themselves on holding the Dao, and refuse to humble themselves before others; some follow their whims and desires, acting arrogantly without restraint, and refuse to humble themselves before others; some are impatient for quick results, unable to endure long-term effort, and refuse to lower themselves before others.

There is yet another class of deceitful individuals who, lacking the sincerity to receive instruction, instead pilfer the teachings of the patriarchs, piecing them together haphazardly, speaking recklessly and misleadingly. Or they rely on their own opinions, chasing after illusions, displaying their skills before the masters, boasting of their abilities and strengths. All such types exalt and aggrandize themselves, unable to humble or make themselves small, treating the great matter of life and destiny lightly.

Little do they know that the great Dao of life and destiny is the rarest thing in the world. How can it be vainly sought through self-exaltation and pride? How can it be lightly attained through such means? I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of self-exaltation. Strike out all self-satisfaction, arrogance, and overbearing ambition in one stroke. Begin from the most humble and lowly place, and learn with steadfast sincerity. Not only will you avoid misfortune and calamity in worldly affairs, but you will also reap great benefits in your pursuit of the Dao.

Otherwise, if you exalt and aggrandize yourself, refusing to humble yourself before others, who would be willing to speak of the lofty and great to you? To vainly hope for enlightenment in such a state is difficult indeed.

The *Barrier of Adornment* in the *Daodejing* says: *"Fields lie fallow, granaries are empty, yet they wear embroidered robes, carry sharp swords, gorge on food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth—this is called the boasting of thieves, not the Way."* The *Nanhua Sutra* says: *"Those who value externals are clumsy within."* Mencius says: *"When widespread fame and praise are bestowed upon one, one need not pay heed to others’ fine embroidery."* All these speak of the principle that those who cultivate the Dao must never pursue externals at the expense of the internal, or abandon the real to follow the false.

The study of life and destiny is a matter of true effort and practical application; not a shred of falsity can enter, nor the slightest pretense be of use. Even a hint of falsity or pretense will not only fail to cultivate life and destiny but will instead corrupt the mind-ground. Thus, since ancient times, those who truly cultivate the Dao have valued life and destiny above all. Clad in a single robe and carrying a single gourd, with disheveled hair and bare feet, they live according to conditions, eschewing finery and adornment. Profound wisdom appears as foolishness, great skill as clumsiness. They harmonize their light with the dust, mingling with the common crowd, so that worldly eyes fail to recognize them.

Of old, the Great Master Huineng concealed himself among hunters in Sihui; Chan Master Daoguang abandoned the monastic life and returned to lay status to accomplish the great matter; Imperial Lord Chongyang lodged in the tomb of the "living dead."

Qiu Changchun stirred up worldly toil; Master Ziqing thatched his own roof; Zhang Sanfeng wore tattered clothes and broken shoes—all for the great matter of life and destiny, setting the physical form aside, making no effort to adorn or embellish it.

Again, like Mad Immortal Zhang of Xianyang, who concealed his traces among farmers; Sleeping Immortal Zhang of Nie, who lay beside icy shallows; Elder Baishi Liang, who drew water and carried mortar to blend with the common folk; and Master Liuxian, who chopped firewood by the river to temper himself.

All these perfected beings labored openly in hardship while cultivating inwardly in secret. When did they ever adorn their bodies or refine their appearances? What they valued lay within; what they disdained lay without. They cherished the real and discarded the false.

Yet deluded learners of this world value the external and disdain the internal. They cling to the false and abandon the real, acting in every way contrary to the ancients. Some, fearing ridicule, insist on fine robes and elegant headwear; others, dreading the cold, pile on layers of clothing. Some strike poses with topknots bound in copper rings; others flaunt exotic sashes, swaggering about. Some dazzle the eyes and ears to deceive others into offering support; others sit in seclusion or seal themselves in retreats to fish for fame and praise.

Such conduct in concealment or display remains but labor within the false, never once turning the mind to the work of one’s nature and life. Clinging to the false while striving after the false, they vainly hope to attain the real—like scooping the moon from the sea’s depths or plucking flowers from a mirror, all ending in emptiness.

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of adornment. Forsake embellishment for substance; wear coarse robes and tattered garments. Be plain and unadorned, holding nature and life as paramount, virtue and the Dao as noble. Turn from error to rectitude, grounding every act in reality—only then may progress be made. Otherwise, mistaking the nonexistent for the existent, the hollow for the solid, neglecting the internal while pursuing the external, abandoning the real to follow the false, the aspiration to comprehend the Dao remains distant indeed.

The *Gate of False Knowledge*
The Most Sage said: "To know is to know; not to know is not to know—this is true knowledge."
The Venerable Ancestor said: "To know yet claim not to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw."
The Perfected of Purple Yang said:
*"Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without the firing times, all effort is in vain.
The work depends entirely on cultivation’s force—
A hair’s breadth off, the elixir will not form."*

The Master of Following the Center said: "Those who study the Dao must grasp the reality of both inner and outer medicines, master the twofold process in its entirety, and align with the great transformations of nature—only then may they receive the transmission. A hair’s breadth off, and heaven and earth remain worlds apart." All this speaks to the necessity of true knowledge and clear insight in the study of the Dao, never pretending to know what one does not, lest the great matter be led astray.

When seekers visit teachers and befriend fellow practitioners, it is precisely because they do not know and wish to attain knowledge. To seek knowledge, one must first discern: What is nature? What is life? What is yin and yang? What are the Five Phases? What is prior to heaven? What is posterior to heaven? Where does one begin? Where does one rest? What is action? What is non-action? What is refinement? What is nurturing? What is the joining of life? What is the completion of nature? From beginning to end, one must achieve thorough awakening, free of the slightest doubt, to attain true and unobstructed knowledge, ensuring flawless practice. If one knows nature but not life, knows life but not nature, understands yin and yang but not the Five Phases, grasps the posterior but not the prior, knows where to begin but not where to rest, comprehends action but not non-action, refines but does not nurture, joins life but does not complete nature—this cannot be called knowing the Dao. If one does not know the Dao, how can one practice it?

The study of nature and life proceeds thus: to know one part is to practice one part; to know ten parts is to practice ten parts. There has never been one who could practice without knowing. Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must first seek knowledge. Yet in seeking knowledge, one must first recognize what one truly knows and what one does not. Only when one has genuinely grasped a matter may it be said that one knows it. If the slightest doubt remains—if it seems so yet is not—it cannot be called knowledge. One must then seek clarification from others until the mind is illuminated and all doubts dispelled—only then may it be called knowledge. Never mistake ignorance for knowledge, lest one deceive oneself.

Worldly deluded learners do not know what nature and life are, nor what cultivation entails. They dabble in peripheral practices, tinkering with crooked paths, muddling through while claiming to know the Dao. Recklessly proceeding, they gain no benefit and only bring harm upon themselves. Worse still are those who commit grave transgressions, mistaking the nonexistent for the existent, the hollow for the full, unable to distinguish right from wrong or true from false, passing off the false as real. Though they suffer injury and recognize their errors, they still posture as enlightened beings, even teaching others their mistaken ways, leading them astray—such hidden malice is especially grievous.

Some may approach a wise teacher, hearing a few words but failing to savor their depth, mistaking the memorization of phrases for knowledge and parading them before others. Others may have read a few alchemical classics, tracing lines with their fingers, guessing at meanings without beginning or end, yet still claiming to know. Even with a wise teacher before them, they do not seek verification. All such types mistake ignorance for knowledge—this is false knowledge, not true knowledge. From ancient times to the present, countless learners have followed this path.

Alas! What is the matter of nature and life, that one should act so recklessly, deceiving oneself and others? One must know thoroughly to practice thoroughly. Exert every effort to discern, pursue with meticulous care, and still fear that knowledge may fall short and practice may not flow smoothly—thus one must seek a teacher. How much worse, then, are those who feign knowledge while knowing nothing?

I urge those who sincerely seek the Dao to swiftly break through the barrier of false knowledge, sweeping away the mind that presumes cleverness. Those who do not know must urgently seek knowledge; those who know must delve deeper. The matter of nature and life is weighty, the supreme Dao profound. One must probe its depths, advancing ever further in understanding, pressing on until all paths are exhausted and the ultimate truth is revealed. To feign wisdom and treat the matter of nature and life as a game is to ensure that the unknowing remain unknowing, and those with slight knowledge never deepen it—how then can one hope to comprehend the Dao?

The *Gate of Hidden Malice*
The *Book of Changes* says: "Gathering with others in the wild brings prosperity."
The Most Sage said: "Be exacting with oneself and lenient with others, and resentment will stay far away."
The Venerable Ancestor said: "The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible."
All this speaks to the necessity of maintaining a peaceful disposition in conduct and worldly affairs, never harboring hidden malice, which obstructs the Dao.

Those who study the Dao do so because they dislike evil and wish to cultivate goodness. Yet in cultivating goodness and abandoning evil, the highest virtue lies in doing so without contrivance—the greatest danger lies in doing so with intention.

Without the mind, there is no self; without the self, there is no other.
Without other and self, other is self, and self is other—both forgotten.
Though others may insult, one knows not;
Though others may deceive or mock, one knows not;
Though others may harm intentionally, one knows not.
To hear slander or face great calamity—
All external encounters, whether favorable or adverse,
Are met with a mind of non-attachment,
Neither harboring grudges nor nurturing resentments,
Simply abiding in non-doing.

As for shared studies under the same roof,
Good and evil, wise and foolish differ—
Each person, each nature, a hundred natures in a hundred people.
How could they all conform to my will?
Some may speak injuriously, others act deceitfully.
To hear as if not hearing, to see as if not seeing—
All should be met with passive response, without calculation or retaliation.

When a true teacher instructs, criticizes, or rebukes,
There must be faults to correct—
One should hasten to amend them and redouble vigilance.
If the teacher selects worthy material,
A true aspirant will endure rigorous cultivation to strengthen resolve.
If the material is unworthy,
Let them proceed as they will—leave them be without concern.

Thus, those who study the Dao,
Whether engaging with the world or in discipline,
Must never harbor private intentions,
Ever maintaining an impartial mind,
Only then will there be progress.

Foolish students of the world
Demand others conform to them,
Yet never seek to conform to others.
They crave flattery,
Take offense at honest speech,
And nurse grudges over trivial slights,
Forgetting great kindnesses while clinging to petty resentments.
Malice festers in the chest,
Year after year, month after month, never released.
Though outwardly they may feign politeness,
Inwardly they harbor venomous intent—
Never satisfied until vengeance is exacted.
Even when they themselves are at fault,
And teachers or friends point out their errors,
They refuse repentance.
Openly, they argue falsehoods;
In secret, they slander and foster grudges,
Their malice boundless—
Such are the wicked.
They have no thought for the Great Dao of life and death,
How could the wicked ever comprehend it?
How could malice ever attain it?

As it is said:
Anger unchecked, nature untransformed—
One falls into the endless cycle of birth and death.
How tragic!

I urge those who sincerely study the Dao:
Swiftly open the *Gate of Hidden Malice*,
Purge all lifetime resentments, toxic *qi*, and foolish thoughts.
Meet all things with equanimity,
In every matter yield to others,
Bear burdens, endure humiliation—
Forged in the crucible of fire,
Struggling free from the battlefield of contention.
All things are empty,
Not a trace retained—
Eventually, one will meet a true teacher,
Drawn from the sea of suffering.

Otherwise, if one cannot endure even a word,
Stumbling and clashing in irritation,
Venomous thoughts coiled in the chest,
Swarming with malice—
How could such a one ever hope to hear the Dao?

**The Gate of Greed for Wine**
Mencius said: *"Yu abhorred rich wine but loved virtuous speech."*
Lu Zu said: *"Wine, lust, wealth, and *qi* are four walls—
All are trapped within them.
Only those who leap beyond these walls
Attain eternal life."*

This teaches that one must not indulge in wine and ruin one’s true path.

Indeed, wine is the foremost of the four harms.
Once one is ensnared by it,
Drunkenness clouds the mind—
Lust arises from it,
Greed is born from it,
And *qi* erupts from it.
Wealth, lust, and *qi* all stem from wine,
Corrupting virtue and ruining conduct.
Even to reckless, destructive behavior—
Drowning in water and fire, unaware,
Falling into blades and war, oblivious.

How many brilliant talents, heroes, and great men
Have perished this way, losing their very lives?
Some, though of good nature, may restrain themselves—
Their indulgence does not lead to ruin,
Nor are they tainted by lust, wealth, or *qi*.
Yet even so,
Their spirits grow dull, their *qi* stifled,
Humors damp and heated, fluids depleted,
Blood and *qi* injured—
No benefit, only harm.

Thus, the Buddhist path forbids wine first,
For its harm is greatest.

Foolish students of the world,
Citing the Ancestors’ sayings—
*"Wine and meat pass through the intestines, not the heart"*
—
Yet they heed not the warning:
*"Do not let intoxication break your fast"*
And so they drink without restraint,
Lost in drunkenness day and night,
Stumbling through life in haze.
Sometimes, drunk, they speak recklessly and wound others;
Sometimes, drunk, they nurse grudges and stir strife.

Sometimes, drunk, they brandish knives and clubs;
Sometimes, drunk, they strip naked, speaking recklessly;
Sometimes, drunk, they sprawl in streets and alleys, heedless of shame;
Sometimes, drunk, they vomit and injure their *qi*, their spirits restless.

And in time, this leads to chronic illness—
Food refuses to enter, until death comes, yet still they drink without restraint.

Even those who earnestly seek the Dao,
Who might otherwise overcome their ailments,
Cannot break free from this foul taste.

Alas!
Practitioners of the True Way must uproot the karmic seeds of endless cycles,
The roots of defilement from past eons—
Wine is but a fleeting taste on the tongue,
An external intrusion, not the deep-seated roots of ages.
If one cannot abandon this minor vice for life,
How can they hope to sever the karmic bonds of rebirth?

Such folly—
Is it not exchanging small harm for great ruin,
Seeking death by their own hands?

Moreover, wine is unlike food or water—
A few days without eating may bring hunger,
But a lifetime without wine causes no true harm.
If thirst must be quenched, water suffices—
Why drink wine at all?

It is only the deep sickness of craving
That prevents them from seeking the cure.

I urge those who truly seek the Way:
Swiftly close the gate of wine-lust,
And turn that same resolve toward
Diligent study, exhaustive inquiry.
Let not the demon of indulgence disturb you.

Though wine is a minor failing,
It can ruin great endeavors.
With fierce determination, cast it aside—
The benefit will be vast.

Otherwise, boundless craving leads to drunken stupor,
A life adrift in confusion,
Trapped in the net of delusion,
Yet still they fantasize about enlightenment—
How difficult it will be!

*"Fear the Hard Path"*—
The *Analects* says:
Where one succeeds, strive for tenfold;
Where others succeed tenfold, strive for a thousand—
Thus the Way is mastered.
Though weak, one becomes strong;
Though soft, one becomes firm.

The ancient sages said:
*"One hour of sleep is one hour of death;
One day of sleep is one day of death.
But daily labor without sleep—
In a thousand days, the task is done."*

The proverb states:
*"Without enduring the utmost hardship,
One cannot rise to the highest."*

These speak of great matters—
Only through unyielding effort can they be accomplished.

The greatest deeds in the world
Demand the greatest labor,
And only through time and toil are they fulfilled.
For the greater the suffering,
The greater the achievement.

And what of the supreme matter of life and death?
Can it be attained without suffering?

The word *"suffering"* is the finest medicine for the cultivator—
Only through endurance can the body and mind be tempered,
Only through struggle can great illness be healed.

Thus, one must:
Externally accumulate merit through deeds,
Internally refine the mind—
Exert the sinews, starve the flesh,
Empty the body of excess,
Labor in every endeavor, strive in all things.
Build bridges, mend roads,
Sacrifice for others, endure insults,
Conform to local customs.
Love what others hate, cherish what others scorn,
Bear what others cannot endure, overcome what others cannot cross.

From birth, sever all habitual attachments—
This is the outer suffering.

Within, discipline the spirit, fortify the will,
Banish desire, sweep away delusion,
Eradicate all afflictions, dispel all ignorance—
With fierce resolve, cut them away.
What cannot be abandoned must be abandoned;
What cannot be removed must be removed—
Only the sincere heart of seeking the Way endures,
Never wavering.
All else must be rejected—
This is the inner suffering.

Only when inner and outer suffering align
Is it true suffering,
Only then can great illness be cured.

In the past, the Buddha refined himself on Snow Mountain,
The Sixth Patriarch labored at the Four Assemblies,
Master Qiu [of *Shifan* Stream] tempered his nature—
Even these saints, blessed by heaven,
Still had to forge their path through great suffering.
How much more so for later generations,
Ordinary seekers of mediocre caliber?
Can the Way be attained without suffering?

The foolish of this world
Know not the sweetness born of struggle,
Nor the ease of true liberation.
At the mention of hardship, they groan;
At the thought of labor, they resist.
By day, they spare their strength to indulge,
Stuffing themselves with idle feasts,
By night, they sink into thick blankets,
Sleeping deeply, endlessly.
They perform no acts of benefit,
Exert no effort in any matter.
Countless flaws remain uncorrected.

The superficial may pore over a few alchemical texts,
Or recite a few sutras, feigning mastery of the Dao;
Some wander begging, sated in food and warm in robes,
Yet call this their true calling;
Others dwell in temples or halls, burning incense in devotion,
Unburdened by hunger or cold, and deem this their path of detachment.

Such types never ponder why they abandon parents,
Why they forsake wives and children.
If monastic life is but a means to food and shelter,
How does it differ from the common folk?
Why burden the world with debt?
Is this not an unnecessary burden?

I urge those with true hearts in the Way:
Swiftly shatter the fear of suffering—
Set a resolve: *"No retreat, even unto death."*
Walk with firm ground beneath your feet,
Press forward with unyielding vigor.

Hold *xìngmìng* [性命] like a brand upon your brow,
Never letting vigilance fade.
Whatever benefits the Way, do with utmost effort;
Whatever harms it, cast aside without hesitation.

Beyond your own austerities,
Follow your teacher’s guidance as if commanded—
No slackness, day or night, in ceaseless toil,
Until true gain is realized.
Otherwise, fearing toil, hesitating in resolve,
Dragging out years in vain hopes of enlightenment—
This is futile.

Do you doubt? The *Daodejing* attests:
The superior man hears the Dao and diligently acts upon it;
The mediocre man hears it, yet wavers between grasp and loss;
The inferior man hears it and scoffs.

The *Vajrasūtra* declares:
*"Good man, good woman, if you aspire to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi,*
*Dwell thus, subdue your mind thus.*
*Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*—
*The supreme, perfect, and complete enlightenment—*
*Is the mind of unwavering faith."*

The *Yijing* says: *"Sincerity in the hunt brings fortune."*
The *Zhongyong* states: *"Sincerity is the root and fulfillment of all things;
Without sincerity, nothing endures."*
Thus, the noble man values sincerity above all.

The sages of the Three Teachings agree:
*Sincerity is the foundation of cultivation.*

But *faith* is not mere words or hollow trust—
It is the unshaken resolve of the true heart.
Faith’s essence is profound, its power vast:
It moves heaven and earth, transcends life and death,
Makes saints of mortals, gods of men—
The supreme treasure for those who seek the Way.

Let the seeker grasp this truth,
Clutch it to his chest, never letting go.
Only then is the root established—
Unshaken, unchanging, unaltered.
From this foundation,
One may hear the Dao, walk the Dao,
Realize nature, fulfill destiny.

Which ancient sage or immortal
Did not begin with faith?
Did not attain the Way through faith?

Yet true faith is not empty fantasy,
Nor idle chatter—
It is single-minded devotion,
No other intent, no wavering thought,
Ever-present, never forgotten.

Only those who regard *xìngmìng* as paramount can truly believe;
Only those who see the world as a worn-out shoe can truly believe;
Only those unshaken by wealth or poverty,
Unbent by power or threat,
Who look down upon all things, seeing emptiness in all,
Who remain steadfast unto death,
Unmoved by fortune or misfortune—
Only these can possess true faith.

If doubt lingers, even a thread,
If laziness takes root,
Then no faith exists.
Thus, genuine faith is undivided sincerity,
Progressing with each sunrise,
Advancing with each breath.

If one walks this path, daily gains are made;
If one strays, years are wasted in vain.

Yet faith must also discern right from wrong,
Discriminate truth from delusion.
Many cling to heretical paths all their lives,
Stubborn, unyielding, never turning—
Is this not faith?
But misplaced faith becomes its own ruin.

Thus, the seeker must value faith,
Yet more, must ensure its purity—
Only then is it true faith in the Way.

The foolish of this world lack steadfast conviction.
Twelve hours in a day, thoughts rise and fall like waves,
Magical influences churn their minds,
Never once fixing the Dao in their hearts.
Some, when idle, flip through scriptures,
Yet before true reflection sets in,
Their minds drift to other matters—
Demons drag them away.

Others, in moments of resolve,
Gather their strength, seek truth, and visit masters,
But when answers elude them,
Their vigor fades.
Some catch a whiff of the scent of the Way,
Yet seeing no swift results,
Doubt creeps in, halting their steps.
Others stray into false paths,
Fall ill through their own folly,
Never repenting, yet blaming the alchemical texts as false.

Such cases are endless.
Without faith in the Way, how can one know it?

I urge those with true hearts in the Way:
Swiftly shatter the doubt that blocks your path—
Fix your resolve on *xìngmìng*,
Sweep away all false desires,
And raise an unbreakable will of iron.
Press forward, regardless of progress or failure,
Until death claims you.

In darkness, unseen spirits will aid you—
Good fortune awaits those who persevere.
Otherwise, today this, tomorrow that,
Hesitating, wavering, never settled—
Chasing enlightenment in vain.

**The Masterless Path**
The *Yijing* warns: *"Plan before speaking, deliberate before acting;
Planning and deliberation bring forth transformation."*
The *Zhongyong* declares:
*"Words decided beforehand are harmonious,
Actions decided beforehand are unburdened,
Steps decided beforehand bring no guilt,
The Way decided beforehand knows no end."*

All say that for any undertaking, what is precious is having a firm resolve and settled conviction beforehand.

He who studies the Dao must first establish his own resolve. With resolve, he affirms *xìngmìng*—then his true heart reveals itself. When the true heart is revealed, worldly affairs cannot stain him, affection does not cling, fame and gain are not coveted, and all matters beyond the self do not weigh upon his mind. His focus is single and unwavering.

Hardship he can endure, suffering he does not know. With this resolve, he can fathom Principle and Principle can be fathomed; with this resolve, he can listen to instruction and instruction can be heard. Indeed, with resolve within, external things cannot confuse him.

But establishing resolve requires discerning the two paths of true and false Dao. True resolve benefits *xìngmìng*, false resolve harms it. If one cannot distinguish true from false, he falls into the wrong path, enters the false Dao, and seeks hidden mysteries while practicing bizarre rituals—all vain and harmful. In the end, he is masterless, though he claims to have resolve. Thus, one must first carefully discern and truly recognize the right path, then firmly establish resolve upon it, with one heart and one mind, acting step by step. Each step will bring benefit, each day will show progress.

This is what is meant by *"Be cautious at the beginning, and you will be complete at the end."*
The *Yijing* says: *"Without leaving your door or courtyard, there will be no blame."* Indeed, it speaks of having settled conviction beforehand.

The muddled scholars of this world, though they claim to seek *xìngmìng*, do not truly value it. They also do not know what *xìngmìng* truly entails. They regard it lightly, dismiss it easily—vague and confused, yet they insist on seizing *xìngmìng*. Without a fixed resolve, they merely follow the crowd. Today they study this, tomorrow they study that—

Morning one bows to Li, evening one bows to Wang,
filling the belly with a jumble of antique trinkets and borrowed goods.
Acting at random, until injury comes—
then no cure remains, and regret comes too late.

Some see fleeting visions and false signs,
mistaking them for efficacy,
unable to discern truth from falsehood,
thus ruining their path.
Others meet a true master
yet lack steadfast resolve,
coming and going without constancy.

The root cause? No true master over the self—
thus empty and unreal,
wasting years in vain,
living a hollow life.

I advise those who truly seek the Dao:
quickly open the *Speed-to-Effect* gate,
fix your resolve.
First exhaust its principles,
night and day applying your mind,
delving into its true meaning,
tasting its subtleties.
Unbound by time—
the longer, the stronger.
Delve, delve, delve—
until insight dawns,
until you truly know.
Then the resolve grows firm,
wisdom unfolds.
From then on, hold fast to this resolve,
never letting go.
Seek the master’s seal of verification,
refine the alchemical stages,
be guided in its application—
only then may you attain the true.

Even if you stray into error,
act inappropriately,
or doubt arises—
seek counsel from the wise,
speak without reservation,
question until clarity breaks through.
Though you may not attain the true,
you may yet avoid disaster.
Otherwise, without true resolve,
you will only falter and perish,
unable to distinguish right from wrong,
true from false,
with no fixed master.
You seek life
yet hasten death.
You vainly hope to illuminate the Dao—
how difficult!

The *Speed-to-Effect* gate:
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Investigate things thoroughly, then know the ultimate.
Know the ultimate, then sincerity of intent follows.
Sincerity of intent, then the heart becomes upright.
The heart upright, then the body is cultivated."*

The *Daodejing* says:
*"Great vessels take long to complete."*

Master Shangyangzi says:
*"Great practitioners must cast aside all lingering sorrow,
grief, toil, and attachment—
every trace of clinging desire—
until not a thread remains.
True emptiness: form like dead wood,
heart like cold ashes."*

Ancient immortals say:
*"Words unshared are no kin.
Work unrefined is not complete."*

And again:
*"The elixir is forged in an instant,
but self-transformation requires ten months."*

All speak of cultivating the Dao
through gradual, methodical effort—
only with time will results appear.
Do not rush or demand swift effects.

The study of *xìngmìng* is the path of longevity and clarity.
Longevity and clarity require
steadfast resolve and enduring practice—
only through deep years and unremitting effort
can success be achieved.
It cannot be accomplished in a day or a night.

For since beginningless time,
our sins have piled like mountains,
our karmic debts like seas.
This life carries the seeds of endless cycles,
the taint of inherited five-phase imbalances,
stained by worldly defilements—
a thousand demons, a hundred illusions,
chaotic and tangled.
They cloud the original spirit,
drain the original *qi*,
steal the original essence.
They consume the primordial treasures,
leaving only pure *yin*.
What remains is a faint trace of *yang*—
barely visible.

If one wishes to uproot the seeds of endless cycles,
transform the inherited five-phase imbalances,
and purge deep-seated habits—
it cannot be done without enduring years
and relentless effort.
For so long as a thread of *yang* remains,
death is not avoided;
so long as a thread of *yin* remains,
immortality is not attained.

Thus the ancestors established the path of return,
teaching practitioners to work from the foundation.
Step by step, exerting effort,
unceasingly striving—
gradually transforming,
until *yin* is exhausted
and *yang* is perfected.

This *yin* is the *yin* of roots, defilements, and imbalances;
this *yang* is the *yang* of original spirit, *qi*, and essence.
Consider: to remove this *yin* and restore this *yang*—
how easily can it be done?
How casually achieved?

This Dao is not only difficult to practice—
even to discern *yin* and *yang* clearly
is no simple matter.

Worldly muddled seekers,
even at the threshold,
already fantasize about incantations;
before learning the basics,
they dream of enlightenment.
Scriptures unmastered,
merits unfulfilled—
yet upon meeting a true teacher,
they recklessly hope to seize treasure with ease.

Little do they know:
a priceless wall-jewel is not easily obtained;
a mother-pearl is the hardest to find.
The subtle Dao of true cultivation
is like the wall-jewel, like the pearl—
it demands effort and patience
before results appear.
How can it be gained by chance?

And yet some gain it by chance—
but it is either a false path
or a deceptive shortcut.
False paths and shortcuts
may show quick results
but lead to certain ruin in time.
True great Dao, however,
cultivates the formless *qi* of the primal origin—
results are slow to appear,
but success is certain,
and lasting benefit is assured.

Moreover, those who hear the Dao are lesser sages,
those who realize it are greater sages.
To become a sage,
one must have ancestors of great virtue,
and in past lives, have cultivated meritorious deeds.
In this life, one must early encounter a true master
and hear the great teaching.
If ancestors lack virtue,
and one’s own past deeds are few—
how can the sage’s path be heard?
How can the sage’s station be attained?

Yet as a seeker,
you must first exhaust all human efforts,
resolutely endure hardship,
and sincerely receive instruction.
Each step taken brings its benefit,
each ten steps bring tenfold benefit.
Even if in this life and this world
the great matter remains unclear,
the roots are already planted—
hope remains for the next life.

I advise those who truly seek the Dao:
quickly open the *Speed-to-Effect* gate.
Raise an enduring, unyielding resolve—
when you hear a good word,
when you see a good deed,
take it to heart and hold it fast.

Practice the *Dan* scriptures, seek the company of a true master, and apply your efforts to the present moment. Though you may not fully complete the Dao, you will still surpass ordinary people and avoid toiling in the sea of suffering.

Otherwise, if you do not establish enduring resolve or cultivate a lasting mind, if you impatiently seek results, grow careless, or slacken in effort—though you wish to ascend to heaven, you will instead fall into the pit. To recklessly aspire to enlightenment is difficult indeed.

The *Cutting-Edge Sage* says:
*"To learn without reflection is futile; to reflect without learning is perilous."*
He also says:
*"Review the old to know the new."*

Mencius says:
*"The mind’s faculty is thinking; when you think, you attain it; when you do not think, you do not attain it."*

*Awakening to Truth* says:
*"Common speech often aligns with the Sage’s Dao—seek it carefully within."*

If you invert daily life to seek it, even the dust of the earth may become treasure.

The ancient scriptures say:
*"Recognize the One, and all matters are complete;
Master the Two, and your path is clear;
Acknowledge the Three, and no need for further seeking."*

These teachings urge scholars to scrutinize principles with precision, demanding true insight—not superficial understanding.

The study of *xingming* (nature and fate) is of utmost weight and grandeur, not like mundane worldly affairs where one can act carelessly. The slightest error, in seeking longevity, may instead hasten death—how can this be taken lightly?

Thus, to clarify *xingming*, one must first investigate its principles, then proceed with its practices.

The principles of *xingming* are neither tangible, formed things within the body, nor the heaviest, coarsest substances outside it. When spoken of thus, even the celestial beings and humans alike should be astonished and doubtful.

Their astonishment arises: if it is neither within the body nor outside it, where then can one grasp it?

From ancient times, there have been three thousand six hundred heretical paths and three hundred sixty crooked byways, each branching into further sects, each claiming its own doctrine. Errors are passed down, the blind leading the blind, and the branches and leaves multiply with time.

Strange and bizarre, their clamor fills the ears like temple bells, their illusions dazzle the eyes like swarming insects. There are things utterly unseen, unimaginable, beyond expectation; there are teachings that seem nothing like the Dao, fit only to deceive the ignorant, yet unable to deceive the wise.

As for those teachings that appear plausible yet are false—seeming like the Dao yet not the Dao, not the Dao yet seeming like the Dao—even the wise cannot escape deception, let alone the ignorant.

Once ensnared in such nets, one may never escape.

Take, for instance, the alchemical texts that speak of *yin-yang*, the *Five Phases*, *yuanjing* (primordial essence), and *yuangong* (primordial qi). Some martial strategists equate *yin-yang* with male and female, and though the ignorant believe it, the wise reject it outright. Yet when alchemical practitioners claim that the exhalation of breath is *yang* and inhalation is *yin*, both the ignorant and the wise accept it.

Some say the *Five Phases* correspond to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, and though the ignorant believe it, the wise do not. Others claim the *Five Phases* are spirit, soul, mind, intention, and will—here, both the ignorant and the wise accept it.

Some assert that *yuanshen* (primordial spirit) is the mind of contemplation, *yuangong* (primordial qi) is the breath, and *yuanjing* (primordial essence) is the essence of copulation—here, the ignorant believe it, but the wise do not. Yet others say *yuanshen* resides in the *Tiangu* (Celestial Cavern), *yuangong* in the *Qi Sea*, and *yuanjing* in the *Dantian* (Elixir Field)—here, both the ignorant and the wise accept it.

Again, in texts discussing *xingming* (nature and fate), *yuanzhu* (primordial mother), and *Huangting* (Yellow Court), some say kidney-qi is *ming* (fate) and heart-spirit is *xing* (nature), and though the ignorant believe it, the wise do not. Others claim prosperity or decline, longevity or early death constitute *ming*, while virtue or depravity, wisdom or folly define *xing*—here, both the ignorant and the wise accept it.

Some say *yuanzhu* is the throat, *Huangting* the navel—here, the ignorant believe it, but the wise do not. Others place *yuanzhu* at the *Shengmen* (Life Gate) and *Huangting* in the *head*—here, both the ignorant and the wise accept it.

As for the teachings on purity, emptiness, and refining the elixir, some claim that cultivating the inner elixir requires absolute purity and emptiness, while the outer elixir demands the gathering of medicinal substances, smelting, and maturation. They say inner cultivation refines nature, while outer ingestion prolongs life—here, both the ignorant and the wise accept it.

All these deceptive byways, appearing plausible yet false, are the most perilous in misleading people.

How many brilliant talents, heroic figures, and wise scholars throughout history have been deceived by them?

A life spent in vain, with no ultimate resolution.

Yet few grasp the **Dao** of cultivating the True One, the primordial **qi** of **Xiantian** (先天, "preheaven").

This **qi** is elusive and inscrutable—called *xi* (希, "rare"), *yi* (夷, "gentle"), or *wei* (微, "subtle").
To gaze upon it, one sees nothing;
To listen, one hears nothing;
To grasp, one finds nothing.

Yet though unseen, unheard, and untouchable,
It contains the utmost **You** (有, "existence") within the utmost **Wu** (無, "nonexistence"),
The utmost **Shi** (實, "reality") within the utmost **Xu** (虛, "emptiness").
It generates heaven and earth,
Encompasses yin and yang,
Embraces the Five Phases.
All principles are complete,
All phenomena are included.

It cannot be sought within the body,
Nor found beyond it—
It arises from the void.

Life and death rest here,
Birth and death are entrusted here,
Immortal and Buddha are realized here,
The furnace and cauldron find their place here,
Medicines are gathered here,
The fire is regulated here,
The Four Symbols are harmonized here,
The Five Phases are concentrated here,
The **Jindan** (金丹, "elixir") is perfected here,
The sacred embryo is formed here.

The reversal of yin and yang is achieved here,
The theft of creation is committed here,
Transcending the mundane to attain sainthood is realized here.

Even the **Yuanzhu** (元牝, "Primordial Feminine") path,
The **Yuanguan** (元关窍, "Primordial Orifices"),
The **Huangting** (黄庭),
And the **Tufu** (土釜, "Earthen Crucible")
All lie within this.

What is said of obtaining one and all matters are resolved—
This is it.

This heavenly secret, beyond the measure of heaven, earth, and spirits,
How can it be known by the ordinary?
How easy can it be grasped?

Only those with **great wisdom and great insight** can know it,
Only those with **great merit and great virtue** can comprehend it,
Only those with **great strength and great effort** can learn it,
Only those with **great resolve and great capacity** can advance in it.
Only through **diligent pursuit**, enduring the distant and the long,
And investing great effort—
Can one attain it.

As for cultivation, there are methods to follow,
As for alchemical work, there are fire regulations,
As for the process, there is order—
Each step varies with time.
Though self-study is required,
One must still seek guidance from a **clear-sighted master**.

As for the myriad **Danjing** (丹經, "elixir scripts"),
Most are but analogies of phenomena to the formless,
And metaphors of substance to the insubstantial.
How can those with shallow minds hope to intuit their meaning?
How can careless ones discern their truth?

The muddled scholars of the world
Apply no sincere thought,
Invest no enduring effort,
And cannot bear the passage of years and months.
At a single phrase, they demand instant enlightenment;
At mere plausibility, they claim mastery of the **Dao**.

They accept the symbols but do not probe the true intent,
They memorize the words but do not savor their depth.
No wonder they take false scriptures as true practice,
And stray into deceptive byways at every turn.
They cannot distinguish truth from falsehood,
Nor right from wrong—
Only asserting that every path holds the **Dao**,
And every scripture reveals the genuine.

They act recklessly, inviting disaster upon themselves.
All this stems from **coarse minds** failing to refine.

I urge those with **true hearts** who seek the **Dao**:
Swiftly break through the **coarse mind’s gate**,
And study with **fine attention**.
Peel away each layer of doctrine,
And upon each insight, advance.
One must separate the false from the true,
Discern right from wrong,
And grasp the essence of principle,
The core of the **Dao**.

Only then can the heart be truly clear,
And faith unshaken.
When one principle is mastered,
One sees that all things in heaven and earth follow thus—
Left and right, before and behind,
The **Dao’s qi** fills all.

This is **true knowing and true seeing**,
**great enlightenment and complete penetration**,
Free from the illusion of grasping forms while clinging to emptiness.
Otherwise, if one cannot study with **fine attention**,
But settles for **coarse understanding**,
Knowing in theory but not seeing in truth—
Still lingering in doubt and confusion,
And presuming to ascend the **Dao’s shore**—
It is difficult indeed.

The **Guansheng** (关至圣, "Passage to Sainthood") says:
*"The young are to be feared—
How knows one the future not surpassing the present?"*
At forty or fifty without progress,
This is not worth fearing.

**Ziyang Zhenren** (紫阳真人, "Master Ziyang") says:
*"Alas! The human body is hard to obtain,
Time flees swiftly—
Who can measure the brevity of cultivation?
How can one escape the retribution of karma?"*

If one does not awaken early,
Only to resign oneself to fate,
And at the brink of life’s end,
A single thought still falters—
Falling into the Three Paths of suffering,
Then even countless kalpas of effort
Shall not free one.

**Sanfeng Zhenren** (三丰真人, "Master Sanfeng") says:
*"To bow to a **clear-sighted master**,
To inquire of the method,
And to begin cultivation—
Even this is too late."*

All speak of scholars needing their youthful vigor
To study earnestly,
And not to waste time.

For the sun and moon pass quickly,
Time flies like an arrow—
A hundred years vanish in an instant.
All things in the world are false,
Except for **life and death**, which are true.

Those who treasure **life and death**
Must act when their youth is strong and their **qi** abundant—
Resolute in purpose,
Bold in pursuit,
With a single, pure thought,
Seeking **masters** and **friends**.

With **sincere resolve**, they study and advance,
Finding a **salvation method** to fulfill the cause of transcendence.
Do not wait until the **qi** decays and the spirit dims,
The limbs weaken and the bones grow frail—
Then failing to return to the **yuanzhi** (元, "origin"),
Nor recover the **ben** (本, "root"),
Awaiting the **Great Transformation**—
Would this not be a waste of a human life?

In youth, when strength is unyielding,
One can endure hunger, cold, and hardship—
The **qi** is full, the spirit is vigorous,
And effort comes easily.
The path ahead is vast,
With potential for great achievement.
Never waste time,
Nor muddle through life—
This would betray **life and death**.

Thus did the ancients value each moment,
Vigilant at dawn and dusk,
Never letting an instant pass in vain.

The muddled scholars of the world
Do not set their minds to cultivation,
But cling to worldly affairs,
Unable to transcend fame and gain,
Nor relinquish wealth and comfort.
They abandon the true for the false,
Plotting by day and scheming by night,
Lost in drunken dreams and waking illusions,
Inviting their own suffering.

Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight all possess them,
Greed, hatred, delusion, and attachment remain complete.
They waste effort on what brings no benefit,
And neglect what is truly advantageous.
They neither study the **Dao** in the scriptures of sages,
Nor learn from **clear-sighted masters** and true friends—
Only seeking abundance in food and clothing.

「Band together in groups, yet speak of trifles,
Their minds filled with fleeting thoughts,
Their bodies engaged in vain deeds,
Wasting time in futile pursuits.

When the Lord of the Underworld, **Yánwáng**, demands his due,
What shall they offer in payment?

They do not ponder that life is fleeting,
That once lost, it cannot be reclaimed.
They do not regard the great matter of life and death,
But instead involve themselves in external affairs—
Those that harm the body and imperil the **qi** and **life**.

Thus, their years of potential benefit
Are squandered in futility,
How can this not be lamentable?

I exhort those who earnestly seek the **Dao**:
Swiftly break through the barrier of wasted time.
Hold **life** and **death** always in mind—
Every movement, every word, must not be forgotten.

When meeting a **clear-sighted master** and receiving teaching,
Or encountering true friends to study with,
Even if the **Great Dao** remains unclear,
They shall not waste their years,
But ultimately become upright individuals,
Avoiding karmic transgressions.

If one truly dedicates mind and resolve,
Enduring great suffering and achieving great **virtue/power**,
With the silent support of the **divine** and the approval of true teachers,
Then the **Dao** may yet be attained.

Otherwise, if they do not value **life**,
Their resolve wavers, their years pass in vain,
And they vainly dream of **immortality**,
It is difficult indeed.

The **Retreat of Resolve**—
The *I Ching* says:
*"The great fruit is not eaten,
The noble one obtains a carriage,
The petty one strips the hut."*

The ancient **Daoist Immortals** declare:
*"At seventy or eighty,
If a breath remains,
One may yet return to the **Elixir**."*

**Zhēn Rén Sān Fēng** states:
*"Plum grafts onto willow, mulberry onto pear,
Passed down as examples for those who cultivate the **True Dao**—
The ancient method of **Daoist Immortals** for grafting,
For old age, there is medicine indeed."*

All speak of those aged not losing heart,
Not abandoning resolve midway,
But persisting in study with ever-increasing diligence,
Until death, without ceasing.

The **Dao** of **Golden Elixir**,
Returns to the origin and restores **life**,
Reverses aging and rejuvenates the body—
The method of **repeating the origin** and **restoring life**.

**Returning to youth** is not the mere alteration of form or likeness,
Nor the restoration of a youthful visage,
But rather returning to the origin and restoring **life**—
To regain **divine perfection**, **qi** and **life** complete,
With no deficiency or lack,
The **original face** one was born with.

This **original face** is not difficult to restore,
Yet people lack resolve and steadfastness.
Though old and weak,
Their **innate spiritual roots** have not yet been entirely extinguished—
Only **postnatal qi** is worn away, diminished, and injured.

If they meet a **clear-sighted master**,
Sincerely seek the method of **grafting**,
And diligently practice,
Nurturing their **yang qi** while reducing their **yin qi**,
Adding to it again and again,
Subtracting from it again and again,
Until there is nothing left to add or subtract—
The deficient shall be restored to fullness,
The absent shall return anew,
As complete as ever before, a **wholeness** without flaw.

This is **returning to the origin** and **restoring life**;
This is **reversing aging** and **returning to youth**;
This is the method of **grafting**.

When **life** is grasped,
*"My fate is in my hands, not Heaven’s."*
Then pursue loftier endeavors,
Ascend to the **Sacred Realm**—
What illness can age bring?

In ancient times,
**Gě Xiān Wēng** attained the **Dao** at sixty,
And dwelled in the **Spiritual Palace** as a **Celestial Official**.
**Lǚ Zǔ** heard the **Dao** at fifty-four,
And cultivated into a **Great Luo** **Immortal**.
**Zǐqīng** attained the **Dao** at sixty-four,
And perfected an **unbreakable true body**.
**Zhēn Rén Sān Fēng** heard the **Dao** past seventy,
And cultivated into a **Ten Extremes Great Luo True Person**.

All these **Daoist Ancestors** attained the **Dao** in old age—
Why should cultivation be constrained by youth or age?

Yet those with resolve,
Even in old age, attain the **Dao**,
While those without resolve,
Though young, never do.
Great is the **virtue/power** of resolve!

The muddled scholars of the world,
In their youth,
Did not earnestly apply themselves,
Wasting their years.
When old, their hearts grow weary,
Their resolve chilled,
They think to retreat,
To abandon their pursuits.
Some may early meet a **clear-sighted master**,
And hear the **fragrant breeze** of the **Dao**,
Yet they cannot endure hardship,
Their roots flicker between life and death.
Delaying until old age,
They abandon themselves, believing no effort remains,
And then stand still, making no progress.

All these are those who begin with diligence,
Yet end in idleness,
Harming their own path—
Who else is to blame?

Yet they know not
That one must first exhaust human efforts,
Then await **Heavenly Fate**.

Each step passed is one less to climb,
Each deed completed is one less to do.
If they firmly resolve to persist until death,
Even if they cannot ascend to the peak,
To reach the halfway mark
Is as vast a difference as between clouds and mud
As compared to those who remain below.

If they retreat due to old age,
Their **Four Great Elements** dissolve,
And they refuse to advance,
Setting their own limits—
This is called *"Yánwáng does not summon, yet one invites their own death."*

I exhort those who earnestly seek the **Dao**:
Swiftly break through the **Retreat of Resolve**.
They must, in old age, strengthen their resolve,
And sincerely attend to their affairs.
Even if great deeds fail,
Their **innate spiritual roots** have been planted—
In future lives, upon emerging,
They shall differ from others,
And surely attain the **Dao**.

If one possesses great **virtue/power** and strength,
Unafraid of **life** and **death**,
They may fulfill their **Dao** in this very world.
Otherwise, if they yield to old age,
Refuse to exert themselves,
And abandon resolve,
They may reach a point of no return,
In frantic disarray, with nowhere to turn—
Difficult indeed.

The **Barrier of Boasting**—
The **Old Ancestor** says:
*"Many words lead to exhaustion,
Better to hold to the center."*

The **Most Venerable Sage** states:
*"The noble one desires to be slow in speech,
Yet swift in action."*

The *Yùshūo Jīng* says:
*"Enter with sincerity."*

The ancient **Daoist Immortals** declare:
*"The wise do not speak,
Those who speak are not wise."*

All teach that one must be sincere in practice,
And not indulge in empty boasting.

The **Dao** of **True Cultivation**,
Is most refined and subtle,
Most detailed and profound—
One must question carefully and ponder deeply,
Investigate thoroughly and discern minutely,
With practice sustained over time,
Only then shall they see the **True**.

They must have firm resolve,
Grounded in reality,
With ever-increasing diligence,
Only then shall they attain the **True**.

It is not enough to merely appear correct,
Nor to scratch at the **Dao** like one scratching through a shoe—
To rush through their affairs carelessly;
Nor to be superficial, self-satisfied,
And build empty bridges on hollow foundations.»

If one’s understanding of the **Dao** is even slightly hazy,
And one’s practice of the **Dao** is even slightly insubstantial,
Not only will they fail to act,
But they will fail even to know.

Thus, those who study the **Dao** must strive
To attain **true knowledge and certain perception**,
**True practice and genuine realization**—
This is what is truly precious.

Foolish learners of this world,
After a few superficial practices,
Conceitedly claim to have the **Dao**,
Spouting nonsense about yellow and white,
Mixedly babbling before others;
Or after a few days of manipulation,
Seeing some effect,
They boast of attaining the **Dao**,
Putting on airs and looking down on others.

All these are mere displays of spirit—
Taking ignorance for knowledge,
Taking falsehood for truth,
Boasting of their abilities,
And falsely gaining fame.

Yet they do not realize:
The study of **nature and life** is for oneself alone,
Not for others;
It is about attending to the inner self,
Not the outer world.

Before one has heard of the **Dao**,
They must urgently seek to know it,
By carefully distinguishing and exhausting principles.
After hearing of the **Dao**,
They must urgently seek to practice it,
By quietly cultivating and refining with sincerity,
Maintaining single-mindedness,
With no other thoughts,
Their resolve undivided—
This is to concentrate the spirit.
How could there be leisure to boast before others,
To seek fame and reputation?

I urge those who truly study the **Dao**:
Swiftly close the door to boasting.
Be humble and cautious in speech and action,
Neither cling to one’s own strengths,
Nor seek empty fame.
Hold **nature and life** as paramount,
And proceed with true sincerity.

Those who have not yet heard of the **Dao** must bow their heads to learn it,
Those who have heard must bow their heads to cultivate it.
When the fruits of practice are complete,
With utmost sincerity before knowing,
Their spiritual powers vast and boundless—
They will not boast, yet others will praise them,
They will not exalt themselves, yet all will exalt them.
Only then, across centuries,
Will speakers praise them,
And listeners revere them,
Their legacy eternal.
Why seek self-praise and self-exaltation for empty fame?

Otherwise, falsely claiming what is nonexistent,
Falsely filling what is empty,
Self-satisfied and deceitful,
Deceiving both self and others,
Deluded into thinking they have attained the **Dao**—
This is difficult indeed.

**The Fantasy Mirror Gate** says:
*"Not moving a step reaches the Western Paradise,*
*Sitting still, all lands lie before your eyes.*
*Light behind the neck is still an illusion,*
*Clouds at your feet do not make you an Immortal."*

It also says:
*"A woman in green robes,*
*A gentleman in white silk.*
*Seen, they cannot be used,*
*Used, they cannot be seen."*

Sanfeng says:
*"Emptiness is form, form is emptiness,*
*Piercing through true emptiness within form.*
*Endless emptiness without form,*
*The **dharma-nature** eternally abides, never void."*

All speak of the **Great Dao** being formless and imageless,
Not clinging to illusions.

The **Dao** of **nature and life** is the **True Constant**.
The **True Constant** is not bizarre or strange,
Without form or color,
Without contrivance or strain,
Naturally so, plainly so.

Thus, the **Venerable Lord** called it **spontaneity**,
The **Sage Confucius** called it **the Mean**,
The **Buddha Śākyamuni** called it **non-abiding**.

It is only that people in the **Dao** do not understand it.
Since birth, **qi** and nature develop under the influence of later-heaven transformations,
Following the nurturing of yin and yang,
Within, delusive thoughts arise in confusion,
Without, the six senses entice them,
Inner and outer forces assail them,
And what was originally natural becomes unnatural,
What was the Mean becomes unbalanced,
What was non-abiding becomes fixed,
The true is concealed while the false manifests,
Losing its original essence.

Thus, the Ancestral Masters established methods to prolong life,
Entering the **non-action** from **action**,
Gradually cultivating until sudden enlightenment,
Returning to **spontaneity, the Mean, non-abiding,**
The **True Constant**, unchanging forever.
They never added or subtracted beyond these.

Though they speak of **overcoming Nature’s transformations**,
**Reversing life and death**,
**Defying yin and yang**,
**Twisting the vital mechanisms**,
**Refining the Golden Elixir**,
**Congealing the Sacred Embryo**,
**Having a body from outside**—
These are merely completing the **True Constant**,
How could they borrow from all manner of shaped, material, or heterogeneous things?

If it is the **True Constant**, what form does it take?
If it takes form, then it is not the **True Constant**,
Not natural, not the Mean, not non-abiding.

Foolish learners of this world,
Hearing of the **Golden Elixir**, doubt it must have the form of elixir;
Hearing of **Moonlight**, doubt it must have the form of light;
Hearing of the **Inverted Moon**, doubt it must have the form of a moon;
Hearing of **Cloudy Light**, doubt it must have the form of clouds;
Hearing of **Red Light**, doubt it must have the form of redness;
Hearing of **Embryonic Formation**, doubt it must have the form of an embryo;
Hearing of the **Primordial Pass**, doubt it must have the form of a pass;
Hearing of the **Primordial Female Gate**, doubt it must have the form of a gate.

Even more, those of false paths and external doctrines,
Practicing inner observation,
See the five **zàng-organs** and claim to have seen a form.
Or through seated meditation,
Hear celestial music and see radiance,
And claim to have produced a form.
Or through dwelling and contemplation,
Spiritually journey to immortal realms and caverns,
Seeing dragon and phoenix palaces,
And claim to have true forms.
Or fix the gaze on one point,
Until spiritual light disperses outward,
Flickering bright and dim,
And claim to have attained a form.
Or silently worship the **Celestial Sovereign**,
Until the spirit wanders unanchored,
Clouds drift in and out,
Feeling as if in empty space,
And claim their **Dao** is complete with a form.
Or reverse **qi** in circulation,
Feeling upward and downward rotation,
Joints piercing through,
And claim to have opened a pass with a form.
Or ingest **qi** and feast on clouds,
Feeling rumbling in the abdomen,
Something in the **dantian**,
And claim to have formed the elixir with a form.

Such false visions—all are mistaking illusions for reality.
Light cases bring sickness, heavy cases endanger life.
Yet they fail to grasp the **Dao** of true constancy:
Neither form nor emptiness,
Neither shape nor image—
How could there be strange and monstrous illusory visions?

When the Great **Way** is complete,
A body beyond the body arises,
Form and spirit both refined,
Uniting with the **Dao**’s true essence—
Formless yet giving rise to true form,
Shapeless yet manifesting real images.
Gathered, it becomes form;
Dispersed, it turns to **qi**.
Being is non-being,
Non-being is real being—
Being and non-being stand not apart,
One with the void—
What visions remain?

Not only are these peripheral paths’ illusions not the **Dao**,
But even those who practice the true **Way**,
With deepening cultivation over time,
May see their spirit-mind tormented by strange illusions,
Defeating their path.
Some appear as omens of fortune or calamity,
Others as ghosts or monsters,
Or as beautiful women or immortal children,
Or as tigers, leopards, wolves, or serpents—
And other strange forms.
If one clings to them even slightly,
Lead and mercury scatter—
The great work is ruined.

In essence, the true **Way** transcends illusory visions,
And illusory visions are not the true **Way**.
In summary: Do not mistake illusions for the marvelous.

I advise sincere seekers of the **Dao**—
Swiftly open the gate to illusory visions,
Sweep away all attachments to images, emptiness, or stillness.
Focus instead on the natural, true constancy,
And you will find the image without form,
The reality that is not empty—
This can perfect nature, perfect life.
Otherwise, if you take illusions as true,
Not only will peripheral paths ruin the great work,
But even the true **Way** will fail—
And achieving the **Dao** will be difficult.

**The Shame-Humiliation Gate**
The *Dao De Jing* says:
*"The ocean becomes king of the valleys
Because it excels in yielding."*

The *Vajra Sutra* says:
*"Patience is the supreme perfection."*

The Great Master taught:
*"After five hundred kalpas,
Long ages past and future,
Through the immortal’s endurance of shame,
Only now is true constancy attained."*

All speak of the **Dao**’s practitioner
Valuing the capacity to endure shame and humiliation.

The **Dao**-bearer’s heart is like a mountain—
Clouds drift in and out, winds blow, fires burn,
Snow covers the pines, yet the mountain’s essence
Stands unmoved, unshaken, through all ages.
So too the **Dao**-seeker’s resolve:
Unmoved by poverty, unaware of calamity—
Their heart remains thus.

The sea accepts turbid, sweet, or bitter waters,
Nine rivers and eight streams pour in,
And dragons and sea-monsters hide within—
Yet the sea’s true measure
Neither increases nor decreases, forever unchanged.
So too the **Dao**-seeker’s endurance:
Bearing insults, enduring filth,
Facing adversity without contention,
Dwelling in lowliness without shame—
Their capacity remains thus.

For those who cultivate life and nature,
Only by enduring what others cannot endure
Can they bear what others cannot bear.
Thus, Zhongfu wore a patched robe
Standing beside those in fox-fur,
Unashamed.
Yan Hui ate from a single gourd,
Drank from a single dipper,
In a humble lane—
While others could not bear his hardship,
He did not alter his joy.
Zengzi’s robe had no lining,
His skin swelled from hunger,
Three days without fire,
Ten years without new clothes,
His hat’s ribbon frayed,
His collar torn,
His sandals split,
Yet he sang the *Shang* hymns,
His voice ringing like metal and stone.

Zhang Sanfeng endured blows from a wicked man,
Receiving them passively without resistance;
Zhu Qing endured abuse and curses,
Accepting them joyfully without retaliation.

These sages all prioritized the great over the petty—
External hardships, unseemly treatment,
They did not count.

Yet worldly, muddle-headed students of the **Dao**
Give free rein to their nature,
Act from impulse.
In poverty, they shamefully envy the wealthy,
And at the slightest provocation, flare with anger.
A bump or collision sparks delusion;
A harsh word invites contention.
And there are those even more foolish,
Who presume to learn the **Dao** yet disrespect it.
Some ask with arrogance of rank,
Some with arrogance of virtue,
Some with arrogance of seniority,
Some with arrogance of merit,
Some with arrogance of familiarity—
They refuse sincere, humble seeking.
Or in public, they puff themselves up,
Strutting to avoid ridicule,
Fearing laughter.
Yet the truly great are never great,
The truly honored are never honored.
Such behavior—
Even if ancestors and immortals sat beside you,
What good would it do?

I advise sincere seekers of the **Dao**—
Swiftly open the gate of true shame and humiliation.
Cast aside all worldly false shame and false humiliation,
And instead embrace the true shame and true humiliation
That cannot illuminate the **Dao**,
That cannot achieve the **Dao**.
Fix your resolve,
Strive forward—
And boundless blessings will follow.
Otherwise, if you shame what should not be shamed,
If you humble what should not be humbled,
If you crave dominance and victory,
Demanding others submit while you refuse to submit,
Knowing only how to rise above others,
Not how to descend—
Such delusions make hearing the **Dao** difficult.

**The Cause-and-Effect Gate**
The *I Ching* says:
*"Families that accumulate goodness
Will have abundant blessings;
Families that accumulate evil
Will have abundant calamities."*

The *Classic of Documents* says:
*"Doing good brings a hundred blessings;
Doing evil brings a hundred calamities."*
And again:
*"Heaven’s punishments may be averted,
But self-made punishments cannot be escaped."*

The *Paramartha Sutra* says:
*"If the beginning is upright, the end will be refined;
If the foundation is crooked, it cannot stand."*

Zhengyang Wong says:
*"Plant hemp and you harvest hemp;
Plant millet and you harvest millet."*

All speak of cause and effect—
If you are careful at the start,
You will be whole at the end.

All things great and small within Heaven and Earth
are bound by cause and effect.
Goodness bears its own cause and effect,
evil bears its own cause and effect.
Those who do good shall reap good rewards,
those who do evil shall reap evil rewards.
Doing good is the cause of goodness;
receiving good is the fruit of goodness.
Doing evil is the cause of evil;
receiving evil is the fruit of evil.
Good and evil rewards follow like shadow to form,
not the slightest deviation.

Thus the virtuous are cautious in what they do unseen,
and fearful of what they do unheard.
They cultivate goodness in every thought,
lest even a single evil intention arise in their minds.
They do not step where propriety forbids,
nor act where righteousness does not demand.
Every action is good,
lest any evil deed appear in their daily lives.
Thought by thought, deed by deed—
if the cause is good, the fruit shall never be otherwise.

Observe the world:
those who kill must pay with life,
those who save are repaid with gratitude.
To act with goodness is met with goodness;
to act with evil is met with evil.
Cause and response—
naturally so, with cause and effect.

A single thought of goodness is paradise,
a single thought of evil is hell.
Paradise and hell are self-made.

Mencius said:
*"Misfortune and blessing come not from elsewhere—
they are self-sought."*

Laozi said:
*"Misfortune and blessing have no gate—
they are self-invited."*

Seeing this, how could the principle of cause and effect
not be clear and evident?

The muddled scholars of the world
do not believe in cause and effect.
They harm others for their own gain,
defy Heaven and reason,
and do whatever they please.
Some deceive the ten directions for profit,
some feign enlightenment to fool the ignorant,
some use alchemical tricks to plunder others’ wealth,
some employ forbidden elixirs to lead people astray,
some slander the virtuous with false tongues,
some sabotage good deeds with hidden schemes.

All such actions stem from disbelief in cause and effect.

Yet who knows?
The path of good or evil is the road to one’s own fate.
If you walk the path of goodness,
the Maker will guide you to goodness and blessing.
If you walk the path of evil,
the Maker will guide you to evil and suffering.

The proverb says:
*"To know your past life’s deeds,
observe your present suffering.
To know your future fate,
observe your present actions."*

This truth is not empty.
If you doubt the next life,
look at this one:
the youth who does good will reap blessings in old age,
the youth who does evil will suffer in old age—
this all can see and know.

I urge those who truly seek the Dao:
hurry to open the Gate of Cause and Effect.
Be cautious in every thought and deed,
mindful in every movement and stillness.
First, become a good person—
one who does no harm, commits no sin.
Then, attend to greater matters,
striving for advancement.
Only then may you have success.

If cause and effect are ignored,
yet one still seeks the Dao while committing sins—
knowing yet pretending ignorance—
layering guilt upon guilt,
how could one hope to hear the Dao?

**The Spell of the Magical Gate**
Wù Zhēn says:
*"The *Qìè Lùn Jīng* sings of ultimate truth,
yet does not fix the fire’s timing in words.
To grasp the secret formula’s core,
discuss it carefully with the Immortals."*

And again:
*"The symbols in the hexagrams mirror form—
when the symbol is grasped, meaning is clear.
All under Heaven’s deluded follow only the symbols,
yet chase the *guàqi* while hoping to ascend."*

Shàng Yáng Zǐ says:
*"The Great Dao has always been a strong name,
the *Yīnfú* preserves its moral teachings.
The *Shòuxìng Dān Jīng* continues the Immortal’s stages,
how could mere formulas reveal it on paper?"*

All speak of reading scriptures
without clinging to the scriptures themselves.

The scriptures and treatises,
with myriad comparisons and parables,
are meant to illuminate the path for later learners,
pointing to the Great Dao,
cleaving through heresy to show the true way.
Within them lie truths on:
authentic vs. false medicines,
right vs. wrong applications,
proper sequences in alchemy,
cultivating nature and life—
nothing is omitted.
Yet their language is subtle,
their principles profound.
They compare the formless with the formed,
the unseen with the seen.
They cannot be grasped by superficial reading,
nor understood by private conjecture.

Moreover, the study of nature and life
differs from worldly things of form and symbol,
which can be plainly spoken and written.
As for the *why* of nature and life,
the *mystery* of the Great Dao—
to speak of it is to lose it,
to debate it is to err.
Even the *Dān Jīng* and *Zǐshū*,
though they strive to describe,
fall short—
what they speak of cannot be fully spoken,
what they write cannot be fully written.
Their words and writings are but rough outlines.

The true seeker must delve deeply,
grasp the general principle,
then recognize the gate,
discern right from wrong,
and only then seek a true teacher
for further progress.

To abandon the scriptures entirely is a grave error,
but to cling to them without guidance is an even greater one.
Neither abandoning nor clinging is correct.

The muddled scholars of the world,
after reading a few volumes of alchemical texts,
see mention of lead, mercury, sulfur, and silver—
if not taken internally, they dismiss it as burning incense;
see mention of male and female—
if not applied to *guīdān*, they mistake it for gathering herbs;
see mention of dragons, tigers, tortoises, and snakes—
if not taken as liver and lungs, they assume it refers to heart and kidneys;
see mention of inverted or reversed operations—
if not understood as *hòushēng*, they take it as preliminary steps;
see mention of quietude and non-action—
if not taken as emptiness, they mistake it for visualization;
see mention of techniques and active cultivation—
if not understood as *bān yùn*, they confuse it with *niǔniē*.

See mention of *nǐwán* (muddy pellet), *Huángtíng* (Yellow Court), *Yuán Guān* (Primordial Pass), *Zhòngmiào mén* (Gate of All Marvels), *Kūnlún dǐng* (Kunlun Peak), and the like—
they suspect it refers to colored bodily orifices with fixed locations;

see mention of *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit), *yīng’ér* (Infant), *shèngtāi* (Holy Embryo), *jīndān* (Golden Elixir), and *fǎshēn* (Dharma Body)—
they suspect it refers to accumulations of *qi* and blood within the body.

Such examples abound, beyond enumeration;
each clings to their own views,
establishes their own sectarian gates,
taking falsehood for truth.
Toiling through life, they never attain success.

Not only do they gain nothing,
but they also suffer harm.
The root of this lies in
treating books as the Dao,
seeking no enlightened teacher,
ensnared by the *shūmó* (book demon),
and thus ruining the great matter.

The Sage says:
*"Learn broadly, inquire carefully."*
If one only learns broadly
without careful inquiry,
it is as the saying goes:
*"Though your wisdom surpasses that of Yan Min, without meeting a true teacher, presuming to guess is futile."*

I advise those who earnestly seek the Dao:
**Hasten to break through the book demon’s barrier.**
Do not be misled by books;
first, study the scriptures thoroughly,
discern right from wrong,
identify the correct path,
and seek an enlightened teacher
to verify truth and falsehood.
Never presume to be clever,
accepting what seems plausible but is not,
and rush to completion.

Otherwise, if one treats books as the Dao,
believing they have attained it,
and arrogantly imagines enlightenment,
it is difficult indeed.

Regarding the *Kōng Guān* (Empty Pass):
The Buddha says:
*"One who aspires to the Awakening Mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi
should not speak of the dharma in terms of extinction."*

Master Zhìzhě (Wise Sage) says:
*"All dharmas give rise to wondrous dharmas;
emptiness, though not empty, reveals its essence.
Extinction is not true extinction;
intuition awakens to the profound principle."*

The *Hánshengjīng* (Heart Sutra) states:
*"Shariputra, form is not different from emptiness;
emptiness is not different from form.
Form is emptiness itself;
emptiness is form itself."*

Master Wùzhēn (Awakening to Truth) says:
*"Though you comprehend the nature of *zhēnrú* (Suchness),
you still risk abandoning the body to enter the body.
How much better to further cultivate the Great Medicine,
transcending the *wúlòu* (leakless) realm
and becoming a True Person."*

Regarding the *Dūzǐ* (Governing Vessel):
The saying goes:
*"Those who study the Dao without receiving the true transmission
fail to grasp Master Píngshū’s warning:
*'Do not enter the mountains until you have refined the return elixir.'*
Yet they seek only to evade noise and pursue quietude,
retreat from the world and distance themselves from people,
abandon their wives and shield their children,
separate from dust and reject the mundane,
dwelling in secluded valleys and deep mountains alone,
believing this to be self-elevation—
thus, they abandon the dharmas of the world."*

Master *Sān Fēng Zǐ* (Three Peaks Sage) says:
*"Do not boast of attaining stillness and non-action as the Golden Elixir.
This speaks of the Dao’s true emptiness, not the rigid emptiness of annihilation."*

The Dao, indeed,
is the utmost void yet encompassing the utmost fullness,
the utmost emptiness yet opening to the utmost reality—
emptiness that is not empty,
non-emptiness that is empty,
employing both methods of the dharma,
unifying presence and absence,
acting without action.
Observe how heaven and earth act without action yet give rise to all things,
how the sun and moon act without action yet govern the four seasons,
how the Sage acts without action yet brings order to the world—
this is action within non-action,
not the doctrine of rigid emptiness.

If one takes rigid emptiness as the Dao,
then the Dao becomes a lifeless thing,
not the living Dao of heaven, earth, sun, moon, or Sage—
but a useless Dao of wooden carvings and clay figurines,
how can this be the true Dao?

The Dao, as the saying goes,
is a path.
A path is one where people travel;
if no one walks it, it is not a path.
Thus, the study of *xìngmìng* (nature and life)
must first seek understanding,
then exert effort through practice—
knowing is the foundation of practice,
practice is the fulfillment of knowing.
How much more so for cultivating the True:
Cultivation is practice itself;
rigid emptiness is no practice—
call it guarding emptiness, if you will,
but not cultivation.

Hence, the ancient ridicule of grinding bricks to make mirrors
and hoarding snow as provisions—
for these are hollow, unreal things.

The muddled scholars of the world
do not investigate the Dao’s origins,
nor distinguish the truth from falsehood in its principles.
Some abandon all thoughts and forget their physical form;
others retreat to empty valleys, guarding stillness,
avoiding all dust.
Some fixate on a single orifice,
nurturing *qi* and preserving *shén* (spirit).
Some gaze at the top of their heads,
unwavering in focus.
Some stare into mirrors,
hoping to glimpse the spirit’s emergence.
Some concentrate on the *Míngtáng* (Bright Hall),
imagining the *chìzhū* (red pearl).

「Such as these, all belong to the category of rigid emptiness and extinguishment—
not true cultivation of the Dao, but rather obscuration of it.
How then can one return to the original and root, perfect virtue and nature,
achieve harmony of form and spirit, and unite with the Dao’s true essence,
transcending the transformations of yin and yang?

Moreover, since birth, humans have been burdened by the *postnatal* yin and yang of the Five Phases,
and carry the *primal* karmic impurities of endless cycles of rebirth—
the dust of roots from time without beginning.
If one lacks the great method to subdue all yin,
or the skill to reverse the fundamental transformations of creation,
and merely concludes with empty, aimless non-action—
how can one transmute yin into yang,
or uproot the seeds of suffering planted across countless kalpas?

I urge those with true hearts who seek the Dao:
**Swiftly break through the fixation on rigid emptiness.**
**Hurry to find a clear teacher,**
and seek another matter—one that truly revives life and returns to its roots—
then apply earnest effort.
Do not chase winds and shadows,
hope for mirages to quench thirst,
delay your progress,
or waste years in vain.

Otherwise, with empty, aimless non-action,
grasping at nothing—
what real benefit can there be?
To vainly imagine enlightenment is difficult indeed.

The *Gold Lock* (fixation on form) is closed:
The *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa Sūtra* (Diamond Sūtra) says:
*"One cannot see the Tathāgata through the thirty-two marks."*
The *Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra* (Flower Garland Sūtra) says:
*"My present body is a false aggregation of the Four Great Elements."*
The *Awakening of Faith* (Treasure of the Awakening of Faith) states:
*"The yang essence and yin essence are not rigid—
to cultivate only one thing leads to weakness and decay."*

All labor over form and shadow is not the Dao;
consuming qi and feasting on clouds is sheer madness.
The later sequence further declares:
*"Nowadays, those who study Dao
take lead and mercury as the two essences,
point to the viscera as the Five Phases,
divide heart and kidney into kan and li,
regard liver and lungs as the Green Dragon and White Tiger,
treat spirit and qi as child and mother,
cling to bodily fluids as lead and mercury—
they do not recognize the distinction between sinking and floating,
nor separate master from guest.
How different is this from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own,
or calling another’s nature as one’s child?

The ancient immortals said:
**"Do not fixate on this body as the Dao—
beyond this body lies the true body."**
All these words speak against taking the colored form as the Dao itself.

The Dao of cultivating the true essence,
the Dao of the *primal* (before heaven),
can transmute the formless into the formed,
generate tangible phenomena from the symbol-less,
overcome creation’s transformations,
steal the essence of yin and yang,
reverse the flow of qi,
and perfect life and death—
this is not comparable to those who labor over the colored form.

The colored form is a false aggregation of the Four Great Elements;
externally, the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mouth,
internally, the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys,
along with bones, joints, and orifices—
all are false.
Which one among them is true?

When the great limit arrives,
it becomes a heap of rotting bones and foul flesh.
If one cultivates while fixated on this body—
how can one perfect virtue and nature,
or escape the cycle of life and death?

Thus, the ancient masters said:
**"My great suffering comes from having this body—
but when I have no body,
what suffering remains?"**
It is clear that the colored form is the greatest affliction of life.
Because it is the greatest affliction,
the ancient masters left the great Dao of the *Inner Elixir*,
teaching one to cultivate virtue and nature,
discarding the false to preserve the true,
and escape this great illusion.

Once the great affliction is shed,
the affliction-less remains—
the true body.
The true body is also called the *Dharma Body*,
or the *Yang Spirit*.
When this body is perfected,
one does not drown in water,
burn in fire,
or be harmed by metal or stone.
Yin and yang cannot forge it,
creation cannot bind it,
and it endures as long as heaven and earth,
shining as brightly as the sun and moon.
How can those who cultivate the colored form
ever reach such a state?

The muddled scholars of the world
do not distinguish truth from falsehood,
study Dao in confusion,
and counterfeit its practice—
like one walking in the dark,
or acting in a dream.
Some shake their bones and agitate their marrow,
others push forward while drawing back,
some dismantle the east to patch the west,
or force qi to collide with the *top gate* (baihui).
Some press the essence upward to the brain,
or practice the *Eight Brocades* (bāduànjǐn) to invigorate the bones,
or recite the *Six Healing Sounds* (liùzìjiè) to boost the qi.
Some take the space between the two kidneys as the *Primordial Pass*,
or the region before the kidneys and behind the navel as the *Yellow Court*.
Some regard the mouth and nostrils as the *Dark Mother*,
or the *Elixir Field* as the root of life,
or the *Heavenly Valley* as the domain of virtue.
Some treat heart and kidney as the *Infant* and *Maiden*,
or the liver and lungs as the *Green Dragon* and *White Tiger*.
Some inhale qi past the *navel center* to the *Elixir Field* as *Fetal Breathing*,
or force qi to strike the *Three Passes* (sān guān),
reaching the back of the brain as *Opening the Pass*.

There are even more absurd practices—
wiping eyes to swallow saliva,
ingesting purity and expelling turbidity,
massaging the navel while straining the bowels—
endless manipulations of flesh and skin,
all called *fixations on form*,
all laboring within the bag of the colored body,
poking and prodding at the false,
and vainly chasing illusions—
these are utterly divorced from the Dao of primal virtue and nature,
the Dao of heaven and earth.

When the years pass and the months are exhausted,
with nothing to show for their efforts—
is this not tragic?

I urge those with true hearts who seek the Dao:
**Swiftly break through the fixation on form.**
Apply earnest effort to the matter of virtue and nature,
and investigate their true origins.

What is virtue?
What is nature?
Where is virtue stored?
Where is nature lodged?
If one truly distinguishes virtue and nature,
and recognizes them with certainty—
then one knows they do not reside in the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, tongue, or body,
nor in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys,
nor in the three hundred and sixty bones and joints,
nor in the limbs, hundred vessels, blood, and fluids.
There exists another secret matter—
without location, without form,
without shape, without symbol.
It is neither within nor without,
but dwells in the realm of void and emptiness.

From this point onward,
one can make true progress,
and will not be misled by false paths.
Otherwise, if one does not know what virtue and nature are,
and blindly gropes through the body,
laboring over tangible, substantial things—
vainly imagining enlightenment is difficult indeed.

The *Inner Elixir* (Gold Lock) is closed:
The ancient masters said:
**"Of all evils, lust is the greatest."**
The *Awakening of Faith* states:
**"In the chamber of desire, to close the tail orifice is to kill countless beings in the *Yāma* (realm of death)."**

The ancient scriptures say:
*"If one speaks of Master Sanfeng’s [三丰] method of sexual alchemy,
It directly causes the Nine Ancestors [九祖] to sink into ruin."*

These words all refer to the practice of *guīdān* (房中) alchemy—
not only does it bring no benefit to one’s vital essence and life-force,
but it also gravely harms one’s *yīndé* (阴德, yin virtue).

What is called the *Jīndān* (金丹) is, in truth, the original foundation.
This *dān* and this foundation are inherently complete in all beings,
perfectly whole in each individual—
unaltered in the sage, undiminished in the alchemist.
Originally, vital essence and life-force are one family,
yin and yang are blended, the Five Phases share the same *qi*.
There is nothing to cultivate, nothing to verify—
yet because *xiāntiān* (先天) yang reaches its peak,
and *hòutiān* (后天) yin arises, the vital essence and life-force become divided,
yin and yang are separated, the Five Phases fall into disorder.
The full becomes deficient, the whole becomes incomplete.
Day by day, year by year, the deficient grow ever more so,
the incomplete grow ever more so—
until the original foundation is entirely lost,
buried and obscured.

Thus, the ancient masters established the *Jīndān* method of return,
so that one might once again cultivate and restore,
returning to reclaim the originally complete and whole foundation—
free from deficiency, free from lack.

The method of return is none other than returning to the unity of vital essence and life-force,
the blending of yin and yang, the harmony of the Five Phases.
The practice of return remains within the cultivation of yin and yang, the Five Phases—
hence the symbols of male and female, self and other,
baby, housewife, *Jīngōng* (金公), *Mùmǔ* (木母),
female lord, *Huángpó* (黄婆) matchmaker, and so on.
Through myriad metaphors and countless descriptions,
all seek to illuminate the union of yin and yang,
the gathering of the Five Phases.

Thus, Master Lü [吕祖] said:
*"To emulate the generation of male and female,
One must awaken the heavenly mechanism,
And act upon the mechanism of heavenly leakage."*

The Dao’s method differs not from the worldly way of male and female generation—
yet what differs is this:
The worldly father and mother generate the colored body,
While the spiritual father and holy mother generate the *fǎshēn* (法身, Dharma-body).
Between the holy and the mundane, there is order and inversion,
heaven and earth are divided by a vast gulf.
Sanfeng’s [三丰] saying—*"mundane is order, immortal is inversion"*—
refers only to those who are upside-down in between.

Yet though the practice resembles the worldly way of male and female generation,
it does not cling to the illusory forms of worldly male and female.
The *dānshū* (丹书, alchemical texts) speak of yin and yang—
these are the spiritual father and holy mother,
the true yin and true yang within one’s own body.
True yin and true yang are not the formed and substantial yin and yang of the body’s *hòutiān* (后天)—
they are formless, insubstantial yin and yang.
If the yin and yang of one’s *hòutiān* body cannot be used,
how much less so the yin and yang of external male and female?

The deluded scholars of the world fail to ponder that vital essence and life-force
are formless, shapeless, without location or substance—
misled by blind teachers’ lewd doctrines and obscene words,
they labor upon the worldly male and female’s fleshly vessels.
Some practice the *Sānfēng* (三峰) method of sexual alchemy,
others follow the *Jiǔqiān-Yīshēn* (九浅一深) technique...

The deluded scholars of the world further devise countless obscene methods:
some claim to "cross nine women as nine cauldrons, nine transformations";
others practice *cǎoshǒujīng* (采首经), pressing forward and backward in threes;
some pluck *méizǐ* (梅子, plum fruit) from the *shǒujīng* (首经) as if serving *rénshēnguǒ* (人参果, ginseng fruit);
others take fresh blood after intercourse as if swallowing *zhēnhóngqiān* (真红铅, true red lead);
some engage in spiritual union without physical contact;
others, veiled behind a screen, inhale breath through the mouth;
some invert yin and yang by having the male beneath the female;
others draw the female’s *qi* upward as if "leaning on *kūn* (坤) to nourish *qián* (乾)";
some consume breast milk as if to "supplement and restore";
others take virgins as if refining a sword.
Such practices are innumerable—
shameless in a hundred ways, filthy and unrefined, lacking virtue and shame,
behaving like beasts.
The Dao has fallen to this—
how can one bear to speak of it?

Yet there are those even more foolish, compounding sins upon sins,
these wretched heads of calamity who, under the guise of ancestral masters,
craft obscene forgeries and spread them through the ages,
luring others into vice.
Some annotate *guīdān* (闺丹, secret alchemy) onto ancient scriptures,
corrupting the sacred Dao.
Like *Péng Hǎogǔ* (彭好古) and *Zhījǐ Zǐ* (知几子),
they deceive themselves and others—
students trapped within their snare,
never to escape.
Is this not terrifying?

Alas! The Dao of *xìngmìng* (性命) is the most pure, most refined,
the most noble and exalted union of true yin and true yang *qi*,
congealing into form within the void—
this is called the *shèngtāi* (圣胎, sacred embryo),
or the "pregnancy of the male child."
Though called an embryo, it is not a formed, blood-and-*qi* substance,
but a refined, pure yang essence congealing into being.
If one takes the turbid blood and turbid *qi* of a maiden
and congeals it into an embryo,
not only is it not the sacred embryo of ascent to heaven,
but it becomes the ghost embryo of descent into hell.
One may seek to be human, yet fail—
how dare they aspire to immortality?

I exhort those who truly seek the Dao:
quickly unseal the *guīdān* (闺丹) passage,
sweep away all paths of lust and desire,
and seek instead the true yin and true yang,
merging them as one—
then naturally a spark of *língmiáo* (灵苗, spiritual seed) will arise within.
One may become an immortal, may become a Buddha,
and endure as long as heaven and earth.
Otherwise, indulging in lust and evil,
harming others and damaging virtue,
one’s innate conscience already corrupted,
vainly hoping to attain the Dao—
this is difficult indeed.

**Lúhuǒ Guān (炉火关, The Furnace-Fire Pass):**
The *Xú Zhēnrén* (徐真人) says:
*"Mixed natures of unlike kind—
how could they willingly merge and dwell together?"*

The *Chúnyú Zhēnrén* (淳于真人) says:
*"Only like natures easily harmonize—
without the true seed, no skill can succeed."*

The *Zǐyáng Zhēnrén* (紫阳真人) says:
*"Do not refine the Three Yellows or the Four Spirits—
if you seek herbs, they are not the true ones."*

*"When yin and yang find their kindred match, they naturally unite.
At eight and eight, their correspondence is perfect.
When the sun reddened at the pool’s depths, the yin perished;
when the moon turned white atop the mountain, the medicine sprouted anew.
Those who would recognize true lead and mercury—
they are not common sand or quicksilver."*

Further, it is said:
*"Do not be bound by the furnace’s laborious toil—
refining the elixir requires the crescent furnace.
There is an innate, true fire of heaven—
no need for firewood or bellows."*

The *Sānfēng Zhēnrén* (三丰真人) says:
*"The Five Metals and Eight Stones are all false;
ten thousand herbs and methods are all flawed.
The golden toad, the jade crow—
only they who recognize the true ones are the artisans."*

All speak of the Great Dao of *jīndān* (金丹, golden elixir),
not the art of furnace-fire refining.

What is called *jīndān*?
*Jīn* (金) takes its meaning from unyielding firmness and incorruptibility,
*dān* (丹) from perfect roundness and completeness—
firm, unyielding, round, and complete—
thus it is named *jīndān*,
the original *xiāntiān zhēnyī* (先天真一, primordial unity) treasure.

It is also called:
the *xiāntiān zhēnyī qì* (先天真一之气, primordial unity *qi*),
the *zǔqì* (祖气, ancestral *qi*) of life,
the *xiāntiān línggēn* (先天灵根, primordial spiritual root),
the *yuánshǐ bǎozhū* (元始宝珠, primordial treasure pearl).
In sum, it is called the *zhēnlíng zhìjīng qì* (真灵至精之气, true refined spiritual essence).

In Confucian thought, it is called *Tàijí* (太极);
in Buddhism, *Yuánjué* (圆觉);
in the Dao, *Jīndān*.
Formless, shapeless—
neither color nor emptiness.
Yet though formless, it gives rise to form;
though shapeless, it generates true form;
though not color, it produces wondrous hues;
though not emptiness, it is true emptiness.

Rooted in *xiāntiān* (先天), hidden in *hòutiān* (后天),
it is the root of *xìngmìng* (性命),
the seed of immortals and Buddhas,
the foundation of sages.
To know and cultivate it
is to transcend birth and death,
escape creation,
ascend beyond the mundane to the sacred,
achieve non-arising and non-perishing.
Yet people fail to recognize this fundamental seed—
thus they pass it by in plain sight.

If one seeks to recognize it,
it cannot be guessed or conjectured privately—
one must seek a clear master for oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction,
only then may one see the truth.
One must also have the master meticulously point out
the true and false of medicines,
the right and wrong of fire-refinement,
the sequence of the work,
and the methods of application—
only then may one make progress.

Ancient immortal scriptures expound upon the subtle and profound,
describe the marvelous in detail—
their principles and methods are without omission.
Yet through myriad transformations and conveniences,
they establish names, adapt to things, take symbols from objects,
ascribe virtues to杂物,
using formed symbols to compare the formless,
using the tangible to illustrate the intangible,
dividing and explaining to point to one principle or method at a time.
Their intent is profound and hidden,
concealing the mysteries of heaven—
difficult to speak openly,
teaching one to grasp the symbol and forget the words,
grasp the meaning and forget the symbol,
to exhaust inquiry and naturally awaken to self-understanding.

If one exhausts inquiry yet fails to comprehend,
if one delves deeply yet remains unclear—
this is the path to enlightenment.
From breadth to conciseness,
from doubt to awakening—
it is not as if the scriptures themselves are the Dao.
Truly, every word of the ancestral masters
is the immediate, wondrous application of *xìngmìng*,
the genuine, inner study of body and mind—
not abandoning the near to seek the distant,
not borrowing from the world’s dross and impurities.

The muddled scholars of the world
seek the distant when the Dao is near,
seek the difficult when the matter is easy.
They do not delve into the intent,
but fixate on the symbols;
they do not exhaust the principles,
but merely memorize the words—
guessing riddles, each offering their own interpretations.
Seeing mentions of *dàjiǎo* (大小金丹, great and small elixirs),
they immediately suspect formed, substantial things;
seeing references to *jīndǐng yùlú* (金鼎玉炉, golden cauldron and jade furnace),
they immediately suspect clay kilns and copper-iron vessels;

Seeing the sayings about lead and mercury elixirs,
they immediately suspect commonplace substances of quicksilver and black tin;
seeing mentions of *huángyá bái xuě* (黃芽白雪, yellow sprouts and white snow),
they immediately suspect refined, crystalline substances from burning and refining;
seeing references to *wén pēng wǔ liàn* (文烹武炼, civilized brewing and martial refining),
they immediately suspect ordinary fires of charcoal and kindling, blowing and puffing.

With turbid substances of metals, stones, grasses, and woods,
they forge, refine, and ingest them,
foolishly hoping to grasp the formless *xìngmìng* (性命, life-essence).

Yet they do not know:
when bamboo splits, one must mend it with bamboo;
if you embrace a chicken, you must use its egg to do so.

The world’s common things are not akin to *xìngmìng*;
how could they ever grasp *xìngmìng*?

And there are those deluded fools,
who borrow the ancestral masters’ elixir teachings,
claiming they transform the mortal body—
or who, hearing the phrase:
*"a single grain of the Dao’s elixir, and a man becomes a dragon like a snake devouring it;*
*even a chicken’s meal suffices to transmute into a phoenix or peng* (鷄餐亦乃化鶴鵬, *even a chicken’s meal suffices to transmute into a phoenix or peng*),"
immediately begin refining metals, stones, sand, and mercury—
the *sānyuán sìshén* (三黃四神, three yellows and four spirits) elixirs—
foolishly hoping to swallow them and ascend,
to change form and alter appearance.

They never consider:
that turbid flesh and turbid bones,
how could elixirs of metals and stones ever transmute them?
The folly is extreme.

Moreover, elixirs of metals and stones are inherently poisonous;
when refined by fire, the poison of the elixir and the fire combine,
their toxicity only grows greater—
ingesting them rots the intestines and damages the skin,
and none who take them fail to lose their lives.

In the past, the *Zhāng Shàngshū* (張尚書) of Jiǔjiāng (九江) trusted and ingested them,
while *Lǚ Zǔ* (吕祖) pointed out their folly but he did not awaken.
He inscribed a poem on his gate:
*"Alas for the *Shàngshū* (尚書) of Jiǔjiāng (九江),
who took the elixir and lost his sight—
his spirit and vitality withered away.*
*He did not know that the elixir of return is formless;
swallowing metals and stones—
how utterly foolish!"*

Later, he indeed lost his sight.
This shows that elixirs of metals and stones
cannot aid but only harm.
From ancient times to now, those afflicted by this illness
are countless in number.

Further, there are those greedy, malevolent wretches,
who, hearing the ancestral masters say:
*"to seek celestial treasures, one must gather worldly wealth,"*
believe that buying cauldrons and elixirs
cannot be done without money—
and thus they roam east and west,
begging for alms or seeking the rich,
deceiving the simple,
and gluttonously consuming fine meats and wines.

Some employ methods like adding silver,
or removing the blood from red copper,
or burning lead to refine mercury,
or burning mugwort to refine copper.

All these kinds are false substances;
how could they ever produce true treasures?
Even to the point of stealing true substances,
substituting false ones,
swindling others’ wealth,
and ruining their livelihoods—
their hearts are as cruel as bandits and robbers.
Their evil and poison,
how could they ever be spoken of?

In the past, the *Zhèngyáng Zǔshī* (正陽祖師) passed on the *huángbái* (黃白, yellow and white) arts to *Lǚ Zǔ* (吕祖),
which benefited people and aided living beings.
Yet *Lǚ Zǔ* feared that in three thousand years,
when the cycle of return begins again,
it might harm later generations,
and thus refused to teach them.
What was his true intention?

The deluded disciples of the furnace-fire,
not knowing that accumulating *dé* (德, virtue) instead harms it,
take the ancestral masters’ words
but abandon their true conduct—
greatly violating heaven’s conscience.
Even if their bodies endure,
how could heaven ever endure them?

I urge those with true hearts in studying the Dao:
quickly open the furnace-fire’s gateways.
Sweep away all refining, elixirs, brewing, and mugwort methods—
these unwholesome, vain pursuits—
and diligently investigate *xìngmìng* (性命, life-essence) within body and mind.
Only then will you discover the *gāngkūn lúdǐng* (乾坤炉鼎, furnace and cauldron of heaven and earth),
find the *Wū Tù yàowù* (烏兔藥物, elixirs of the tortoise and hare),
and refine true treasures with the *sānmiè zhēn huǒ* (三昧真火, genuine threefold fire).
Otherwise, treating metals and stones as snacks,
and poisonous elixirs as life’s treasures—
they bring no benefit but only harm.
To foolishly hope for enlightenment,
it is difficult indeed.

The above fifty precepts
are all critical gateways for students of the Dao,
and the great demons of the *yīnlù* (陰路, path of darkness).
They must be opened one by one
to make progress.

If even one gateway is not opened,
that single gateway will block you—
no matter how great your worldly fame,
how mighty your strength,
you will not advance an inch.

Students must recognize the truth
and believe sincerely.
Though they may not instantly open all gateways,
with gradual, earnest effort,
there will surely come a day when they are opened.

If they do not recognize the truth,
do not believe sincerely,
they will forever remain within the gateways,
unable to emerge into the *guānwài* (關外, realm beyond).
To walk the great path,
unless they fly with wings or ride the clouds,
how could they not ruin their future?

All students who casually disregard these gateways,
deeming them trifling,
who seek the distant when the Dao is near,
who seek the difficult when the matter is easy—
they do not remove their own afflictions,
yet foolishly hope to inherit others’ attainments;
they do not exhaust their own human affairs,
yet foolishly hope for others’ celestial treasures.

Who would entrust their attainments to a sickly man?
Who would bestow their celestial treasures upon a thief?

The Dao of *xìngmìng* (性命, life-essence)
is the greatest and most difficult matter in the world.
It cannot be borne or achieved
by men of great strength or great virtue.
Only those with extraordinary power and extraordinary *dé* (德, virtue) can undertake it.

If one truly opens all these gateways,
they are the men of extraordinary power and extraordinary virtue.
When they encounter a true teacher’s guidance,
the great Dao unfolds—
they directly reach the other shore,
unhindered by obstacles in all directions,
seeing results at every step.
Why fear that the Dao cannot be achieved?

**Song of Absolute Truth**
*"I recall in years past my fallen state,
when a single sincere thought led me to seek the true teacher.
In vain I wandered through Yànjīng (燕京) and Hénán (河南),
in vain I galloped through Shānyòu (山右) and Guānzhōng (關中).
My eyes saw only lions and tigers in disguise,
my ears heard only foxfire’s hollow words.
All spoke of encountering immortals with ease,
yet who knew that the true path is most difficult to find?
When adversity turned to fortune, the divine revealed:
Do not seek the great Dao in the golden city.
The old man of *Lán Gǔ* (龕谷) is no ordinary figure,
his words and utterances are profound and vast.
Leaning close, he broke open the gate of the original mother,
and at that time, I could reverse yin and yang.
The great principle and great use are natural,
not like the six false schools forcing contrivance.
At parting, he entrusted me with his teachings:
First exhaust human affairs, then deliberate further.
Because I left his presence too soon,
later matters remained unclear—
my heart darkened with confusion.
For thirteen years, I carried doubts,
until luckily, in Hànshǔ (漢上), I glimpsed the teacher’s lingering light."*

「Dig out the *Celestial Root* (天根) and *Earth Marrow* (地髓),
point to the *U-Gan* (乌肝) and *Tu-Chang* (兔肠).
He spoke carefully of the *fires of refinement* (火候)—urgent and gradual—
and laid out the *alchemical stages* (工程) with clear distinctions.

Cultivating *nature* (性) and *command* (命) requires earnest effort,
observing the *orifices* (窍) and *mysteries* (妙) at the right moment.
When the *Four Symbols* (四象) harmonize, the *elixir* (丹) is restored;
when the *Five Phases* (五行) merge, the *embryo* (胎) is formed.
With *yin exhausted* (阴尽) and *yang pure* (阳纯), the *perfect circle* (方圆) is achieved,
and the *void* (虚空) is shattered—no birth nor death remains.

In my ears, I heard this *true exposition* (真诠),
and suddenly, all was illuminated—penetrating the *mystic Dao* (妙玄).
From beginning to end, every principle was clear,
and from then on, I recognized the *Dao beyond the Dao* (天外天).

*Qī flowers* (琪花) and *Yáo grasses* (瑶草) appear before me,
but *white snow* (白雪) and *yellow buds* (黄芽) are complete within my own body.
Left and right are all *jewel treasures* (珠宝),
front and back are both *golden lotuses* (金莲).

How can one seek this *Celestial Mechanism* (天机)?
To seek it, one must *establish resolve early* (立志早).
First, abandon all worldly affairs,
then sweep away all emotional entanglements (情缘).
With a *void heart* (虚心), descend to seek the *High Clarity* (高明),
and delve deeply into the *subtle principles* (几) to explore the *essence of reason* (理脑).
When bitterness is exhausted, sweetness naturally emerges,
and when resolve is firm, the *true treasure* (真宝) will eventually be attained.

Having *awakened to the primal essence* (悟元) and *harmonized the fundamental substance* (平素),
my vow runs deep with *great impartiality* (大公).
I wish only for all to ascend to the *sacred realm* (圣域),
and always rejoice when each hears the *sound of the dharma* (法音).

The *crooked paths* (曲径) of external Dao (外道) disrupt the *true Dao* (正道),
and *mercury* (汞金) and *copper* (铜点) are mistaken for *true gold* (真金).
Many *scholars* (学者) fall into the *Màn-Tian net* (缦天网),
while *resolute individuals* (志士) often wander into the *Black Pine Forest* (黑松林).

Where can these *grievances* (冤屈) be redressed?
Too late to regret—*vain tears* (泣号) are all that remain.

The *path of reason* (理路) is not pursued to its depths,
because the *mind is suspended in emptiness* (悬虚) with no fixed operation (定操).

Who knew the *sacred Dao* (圣道) has *true transmission* (真传)?
How could one know that *creation* (造化) is not easily plundered?

If not for *great deeds* (大行) and *great merit* (大功),
the *Pénglái Isles* (蓬莱) would be mere illusions—*empty longing* (空心躁).

Laughable are the *muddled folk* (糊涂人) of this world,
who vainly dream of the *Heavenly Path* (天衢) yet sink into dust.

To lead the blind with blindness harms *yin virtue* (阴德),
and to propagate error only deepens the *mire of delusion* (迷津).

I now cannot bear the *Dao’s decline* (大道坠),
so I carefully expound the *ancestral lineage* (祖脉).

Not for *selling fame* (沽名) or *fishing for praise* (钓誉),
nor to indulge in *empty chatter* (饶舌) and *confuse the lips* (乱鼓唇).
The *direct pointers* (直指) break through metaphoric speech,
and the *Yijing* (周易) reveals the *true sequence of alchemical fires* (火候序).

Distinguishing *difficulties* (辩难) clarifies right and wrong,
and the *convergence of Dao and Virtue* (道德) establishes *rules* (规矩).
Original intent and practical application are all clearly stated,
and the *heart’s understanding* (会心) of *elixir substances* (药物) is meticulously described.

The *South-Pointing Needle* (指南) illuminates the *refined Dao* (精微),
and *doubt-breaking* (破疑) leads to the *passage of enlightenment* (通关), uniting *Dao companions* (结道侣).
The *simpler the words* (辞句愈浅), the *clearer the principles* (理愈明),
and the *more minute the steps* (节目极小), the *more precise the achievement* (功极精).

To be *humble and meticulous* (谨细自卑) is to ascend to the heights,
and to be *cautious and subtle* (慎微) from the *void* (虚) is to attain fullness (盈).

Do not abandon the near to seek the distant,
or you will surely *err in your grand pursuit* (误前程).
Better to first heal your *immediate ailments* (切身病),
than to *leap ahead* (躐等) and vainly hope for *longevity* (长生).

At this point, there is no remaining meaning—
the *precepts of practice* (修行法则) leave no room for doubt.
Every ten thousand words and every sentence is *true exposition*,
and each phrase holds profound intent (深意).

Not like *superficial discussions* (包皮外象谭) of mere appearances,
all are *secrets to attaining immortality and the Dao* (成仙了道秘).
Though few in this age comprehend these truths,
I leave them for *future worthy disciples* (后贤) to ponder carefully.

Now old and weary, I cannot endure further,
my *heart’s resolve* (愿心) is complete—no more words remain.
I *seal the mouth* (塞兑) and *close the door* (闭门), destroying all *intellectual schemes* (智虑).
I *gather essence* (敛华) and *return to reality* (就实), reflecting on the *original source* (本原).

No longer do my eyes gaze upon the *dusty world* (尘世事),
my heart forever bears the *Mixed-Element Banner* (混元幡).
Like the *foolish and dull* (如愚如讷), I lack knowledge,
yet I *single-handedly reveal* (一手掀) the *transformations of yin and yang* (阴阳造化).
