**Preface to *Xuanfu Lun* by Lu Xixing**

*Xuanfu Lun* is a work composed by this student, Lu. Having received the teachings of the nature and destiny from a sagely master, I suddenly found deep resonance within my heart. Thus, I recorded what was transmitted, compiling twenty essays totaling over seven thousand words, entitled *Xuanfu*. "Xuanfu" signifies that the profound principles herein are but superficial—far from true mastery.

As the ages grow distant from the sages, the Great Dao has been lost in transmission. Blind and reckless teachers each peddle their own interpretations, often pilfering semblances of truth to embellish their deceptions. Some, like mendicant chan monks, vie in verbal sparring; others, like monopolistic charlatans, boast of alchemical gold and silver. In the realm of human destiny, they mislead with inner alchemy; in the pursuit of elixirs, they ravage lives with minerals and metals. With learning obscured, the calamities spread endlessly—how pitiable this is!

In my early years, I, as a scholar, devoted myself to the studies of the Two Teachings (Confucianism and Daoism) for nearly twenty years, yet wandered through forests of thorns and thickets of idle chatter. Though I stumbled repeatedly, I never abandoned my original sincerity, and thus attained this fortunate encounter.

Nature is realized through self-awakening, while destiny relies on a master’s transmission. These two sayings, however, still leave room for further discussion. Why? Even those of superior roots and keen faculties must grasp the truth in an instant of instruction. Without receiving the esoteric teachings directly, one who relies solely on personal judgment is like the blind groping without a staff—where can they go? There are three reasons why the Dao remains unheard:

First, those who indulge in worldly pleasures, mistaking delusion for the norm, or who cling to emptiness while scorning practicality—these harbor a heart of disbelief.

Second, those with fleeting admiration, entangled in worldly nets, delaying liberation while making half-hearted efforts—these possess a heart of incomprehension.

Third, those who claim sagely wisdom yet reject good counsel, engaging in grand but hollow discourse, thereby discouraging others—these hold a heart of arrogance.

If any of these three afflictions exist, the sagely master will not turn their gaze, nor will true friends draw near. Habitual procrastination buries one’s life in ignorance, ending only in death—how lamentable!

Fearing this fate, I have labored day and night, never daring to abandon myself. Thus, I cast aside delusive thoughts and immersed myself in the utmost Dao. In moments of quiet cultivation, reflecting on the master’s teachings, I have ventured to record them in these essays, undeterred by taboos or prohibitions. My aim is to reveal the true essence, circulate the correct lineage, and guide people toward the Dao.

Some may say that the ancients wrote books only after attaining the Dao—does your haste to speak not betray impatience? I have heard that the highest path is to establish virtue, and the next is to establish words. When words cannot be withheld, one must speak. I am but the latter. If the Dao advances virtue, then silence may suffice. Yet if virtue remains unfulfilled, how can words be restrained?

Written on the Double Ninth Festival in the *dingmao* year of the Longqing reign (1567).

**Three Origins Discourse**
I have heard from my master thus:

“There are three Origins of the elixir, each capable of completing destiny.”

The Three Origins refer to the Celestial Origin, the Terrestrial Origin, and the Human Origin. The Celestial Origin is called the Divine Elixir. The Divine Elixir is refined with water above and fire below within the chamber of spirit, transforming the formless into form. After nine cycles are complete, it becomes white snow. Refined for three more years, it transforms into a divine talisman. Consuming it, one becomes weightless and ascends—such is the wondrous work of medicinal transformation and spiritual efficacy, a marvel of sages and immortals. Its method is expounded in the Dragon and Tiger of the Yellow Emperor and the Stone Casket of Master Jingyang.

The Terrestrial Origin is called the Numinous Elixir. The Numinous Elixir transmutes metals and minerals into supreme treasures. This elixir, composed of tangible substances like silver, lead, cinnabar, and mercury, can benefit the world but cannot lighten the body. After nine cycles are complete, its most wondrous essence is used to forge the chamber of spirit, thereby connecting upward to the Celestial Origin. It serves as the vessel and provision for cultivating the Dao, the resource for learners. From ancient times to the present, the highest sages and perfected beings have called this the sacred endeavor. Its method is exceedingly simple: one need only gather precelestial lead, subdue postcelestial mercury, recognize ascent and descent, and discern maturity and tenderness. Yet today’s blind masters, ignorant of this, repeatedly fail, achieving nothing. They do not realize that the way of the Terrestrial Origin is no different from that of the Human Origin. Only those who thoroughly understand yin and yang and deeply grasp the workings of creation may speak of it.

The Human Origin is called the Great Elixir. The Great Elixir is forged in an external crucible while the medicine is refined within, taking from Kan to fill Li, stealing the mechanism and reversing its use. All the highest immortals and sages of antiquity followed this path. Thus, among the studies of destiny-completion, none is more immediate and essential than the Human Origin.

Of the three Origins of the elixir, the Celestial Origin depends on heaven, earth, and spirits and cannot be assured; the Terrestrial Origin, when its methods are clear and both fortune and intention are aligned, is as easy to grasp as reaching for something at hand; the Human Origin, however, holds the cosmos in one’s palm, gives birth to the myriad transformations within the body, and its mechanism is unfathomable to ghosts and spirits, its calculations beyond the reach of yin and yang.

Yet is there a distinction of great and small among them? My master said: “Heaven encompasses earth, and earth bears humanity—thus the distinction of great and small is evident, and this is the hierarchy of the Three Origins.”

**On Inner and Outer Medicines**
In the study of the Human Origin, the crucible is forged externally while the medicine is refined internally, giving rise to the distinction between inner and outer medicines. Yet those who discuss outer medicine today often miss its essence, leading the blind with blindness—how lamentable!

The Dao resides within the body; inner refinement is the true path. Why then forge a crucible externally? Forging the crucible is something the sage does out of necessity. The Old Sage compared it to the use of arms, saying: “Weapons are inauspicious tools; the sage uses them only when unavoidable.”

Moreover, the three supreme medicines—spirit, qi, and essence—are all possessed by us in the precelestial state, undifferentiated and uncarved. Why would one need to refine them? Thus, the uncorrupted child is already a sacred embryo. But once the passions awaken, the undifferentiated body is broken! Once broken, what the body contains daily transforms, and all movement falls into the postcelestial. Postcelestial things belong to yin and cannot endure long; one must borrow precelestial substances of the same kind to replenish them. The precelestial of the same kind is the yang of Qian metal. Refining yin with yang, the form endures. As the *Cantong Qi* says: “To become an immortal through ingestion, seek substances of the same kind. A broken fence is mended with bamboo; a lost chicken is replaced with an egg.” This analogy is most clear.

Yet one must also know that the qi of self and other are both divided from the same Supreme Ultimate. Within them, the essence of yin and yang mutually reside in each other’s abodes, and one cannot cultivate alone. The *Book of Changes* says: “The Dao consists of one yin and one yang.” “Like sounds resonate; like qi seek each other.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “Marriage ties the qi together; in the first year, the sprout grows.” The principle of creation is this: following the natural order, it becomes human; reversing it, it becomes elixir. The divine subtlety is spontaneous and cannot be falsified.

Refining the medicine within while forging the crucible without—does this merely mend the body’s deficiencies? Far from it.

**On the Mutual Concealment of Yin and Yang**
The *Cantong Qi* says: “Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Changes* operate within them.” The *Changes* refer to Li and Kan. The poem *Wuqiong* says: “First take heaven and earth as the crucible; next gather the crow and hare to cook the medicine.” Heaven and earth are the images of yin and yang; the crow and hare are the essence of yin and yang. Li is the sun, which holds yang essence, yet the central line of Li is yin—thus yin is concealed within yang’s abode. Kan is the moon, which holds yin essence, yet the central line of Kan is yang—thus yang is concealed within yin’s abode. The *Cantong Qi* says: “Kan male is the sun; Li female is the moon.” This is what it means.

Thus, Qian and Kun are the purity of yin and yang; Kan and Li are the union of yin and yang. In humans, before the passions awaken, one embodies the pure yang of Qian and pure yin of Kun. After they awaken, the bodies of yin and yang unite, and their mutually concealed essences are put to use. The number of lesser yin is eight; men attain it, so at sixteen their essence flows. The number of lesser yang is seven; women attain it, so at fourteen their celestial water arrives. Is this not the meaning of yang possessing yin’s number and yin possessing yang’s number, revealing the principle of mutual concealment?

Some may ask: “At sixteen, a man’s essence flows—his unbroken body is ruptured, but this surely arises from some stimulus. At fourteen, a woman’s celestial water arrives—what stimulus does she receive?”

I reply: Before discussing whether there is stimulus or not, once the qi has arrived, the undifferentiated body is already ruptured. Moreover, beneath the heavy yin of earth’s configuration, a single yang suddenly returns—this is the hexagram of the eleventh month. At this time, what does the heart of Heaven and Earth reveal? Yet the Master sighed over it, was it not because the qi of creative interaction, though not yet suffused, has already set its mechanism in motion?

When it is poised between non-movement and movement, movement and non-movement, this is called the *true yi* qi of the precelestial, which serves as the root of creation and the pivot of all things, truly residing therein. Only when signs have coalesced and forms and colors become manifest does it fall into gross substance and belong to the postcelestial.

Thus, what I call “rupture” refers to the activation of the qi’s mechanism, not that it must await the suffusion of interaction to be called rupture. Furthermore, when a man’s essence first flows, it does not necessarily begin with gross substance. The qi must arrive first, then transform into water, and then further transform into essence. The qi that arrives first is the precelestial; the qi transforming into water is the water born from the *Heavenly One*. Once the precelestial body is ruptured, the postcelestial function proceeds; once the postcelestial function proceeds, the precelestial true qi becomes ever more concealed.

The marvel of creation unfolds to this point—who would say otherwise? I invite you to consult your teacher on this matter. *On the Precelestial and Postcelestial*

“Why does the postcelestial function’s activation cause the precelestial true to grow ever more concealed?”

It is said: “The precelestial true cannot be seen. Whatever is visible belongs to the postcelestial. Now, when we speak of tears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humors—all these are tangible, gross substances, all postcelestial and thus unusable. Even when essence, qi, and spirit are invoked, one fails to recognize that once the postcelestial function is activated, essence, qi, and spirit all manifest in accordance with its operation, thereby falling into the postcelestial. Why? Once the aperture is pierced, whatever is spoken or employed becomes postcelestial, while the precelestial true sinks into concealment, weak and subtle, daily withering until it can no longer govern the body. When old age, sickness, suffering, and death arrive, it is because the postcelestial function is exhausted and the precelestial no longer exists. Thus, if one wishes to preserve the body’s permanence, what recourse remains but the precelestial?”

*On Lead and Mercury*

Someone asks: “The precelestial qi is called true lead—what is the meaning of this?”

It is said: “‘True’ is spoken in contrast to the ordinary. The true is formless, while the ordinary has form. If you insist on pursuing this matter, let us speak of its root. When Qian and Kun unite, the bodies of Li and Kan are formed. Once Qian and Kun unite, the undifferentiated body is ruptured. Thus, in the postcelestial trigrams, Qian and Kun are relegated to the most exalted yet useless positions, and Li and Kan take their place. For south and north are the two poles of Heaven and Earth. In the precelestial trigrams, Qian and Kun originally resided there. Now, displaced and unused, they are replaced by Li and Kan, and the postcelestial function proceeds. Li is the sun, shining in the south; Kan is the moon, illuminating the north. Sun and moon exchange their radiance, and the myriad things are born. Though called the postcelestial function, it is in truth the precelestial body that enacts it. Thus, Kan’s true qi transforms into lead—this is the water born from the *Heavenly One*. Li’s true essence transforms into mercury—this is the fire born from *Earthly Two*. Lead and mercury, water and fire, are all named and formed substances in the human realm. To call them *true* lead and mercury is to say they are nameless and formless. Thus, we are compelled to borrow these named and formed substances as metaphors, adding the word *true* to indicate nothing more than yin essence and yang qi. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘Essence and qi become things; essence unites with qi.’ When a person first comes into being, it is entirely the operation of the precelestial. Because they interpenetrate, the male receives essence and, employing essence, transforms; the female receives qi and, employing qi, flourishes. Employing essence, one transforms and thus follows the course to become human; employing qi, one flourishes and thus reverses the course to form the elixir. That the precelestial qi is called true lead carries profound meaning. Using the precelestial’s unperturbed true lead to restrain the postcelestial’s long-accumulated true mercury, their mutual attraction and devotion become like that of husband and wife, mother and child—unwilling to part. All this occurs naturally. Those who do not understand how it comes to be, unless they thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation, how could they speak of this?”

**On Original Essence, Original Qi, and Original Spirit**

“Original qi is lead, original essence is mercury—what then is original spirit?”
It is said: “Original spirit is nature, the master of essence and qi. As it dwells in duality yet remains unfathomable, spiritually pervading yet without fixed form, it is called *shen* (spirit). Thus, when spirit abides, essence congeals; when essence congeals, qi returns; when qi returns, the elixir coalesces. All are functions of the precelestial.

What is called *original essence* is not the essence of sexual congress. Essence is stored in *Li* (☲), the true fluid within the heart. What is called *original qi* is not the breath of mouth and nose. Qi is stored in *Kan* (☵), the true qi within the void. What is called *original spirit* is not the spirit of thought and deliberation. Spirit pervades the *Wuji* (Ultimateless), the numinous reality prior to one’s birth from father and mother.

Man is a single *Taiji* (Supreme Polarity). Essence and qi are the yin and yang of the *Taiji*, while spirit is the *Wuji* of the *Taiji*—these are the *original essence*, *original qi*, and *original spirit*.

How apt is the verse of *Cuixu*:
*‘This essence is not the dregs of lustful arousal,*
*But the Jade Emperor’s saliva from his mouth.’*
The Jade Emperor is the lord of the heart; the saliva from his mouth is the numinous fluid within the heart.

*‘This qi is not the breath of inhalation and exhalation,*
*But the mist of primordial simplicity, true and undifferentiated.’*
The mist of primordial simplicity is the precelestial true *yi* qi.

*‘This spirit is not the spirit of thought and worry,*
*But one that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Sovereign.’*
The Primordial Sovereign is the *Yuanshi* (Original Beginning). This is the true of the *Wuji*, penetrating heaven and earth, pervading the cosmos, majestically and uniquely exalted, transcendent and uniquely operative.”

**On the Governance of Spirit**

“How does one know that spirit governs essence and qi?”

“Consider the postnatal aspect of the body. When the spirit is excessively startled, essence scatters and palpitations arise; when the spirit is overly lustful, qi dissipates and impotence follows. Thus, when spirit abides in essence, it is called *jing-shen* (essence-spirit); when spirit abides in qi, it is called *shen-qi* (spirit-qi). Essence and qi, when ruled by spirit, are like ministers who gain honor through their lord. Therefore, for those who cultivate the truth, nothing is more essential than nurturing the spirit. Spirit is nature; when nature is settled, spirit naturally rests; when spirit rests, essence naturally abides; when essence abides, qi naturally arises. Why is this so? When nature is settled, the heart-fire does not flare upward; when fire does not flare, water does not dry up, and thus the essence within the body abides. All the essence in the five viscera and six bowels is water. When the essence within the body abides, the essence in the kidneys may be known. The kidneys are the palace of essence; when essence flourishes in the kidneys, accumulated water generates tides, billowing upward like clouds and mist, steaming the four great elements and irrigating above and below. When I employ the primordial spirit to revolve within it, ascent and descent, advance and retreat, are as if turned in the palm—this is called the *water-fire intermingling to achieve completion*, this is called *postnatal qi attained as if in drunkenness*. Yet this speaks only of the postnatal aspect of our body.

As for the function of the prenatal, its gathering and union, its shedding of the womb and transformation of spirit, are of the primordial One and not what spirit accomplishes. Therefore, for those who cultivate the truth, nothing is more essential than refining the spirit. Refining the spirit is called *jade-fluid refinement of the self*, the means by which the Great Dao achieves both beginning and end.”

**On Golden Fluid and Jade Fluid**

“The alchemical methods speak of *golden-fluid refinement of form* and *jade-fluid refinement of the self*—what is their purport?”

“Dao is the concurrent cultivation of nature and life, the wondrous union of form and spirit. *Golden-fluid refinement of form* is the completion of life; *jade-fluid refinement of the self* is the completion of nature. What is *jade fluid*? Jade is an analogy for warmth, moistness, integrity, and purity; gold is a term for unyielding hardness and indestructibility. Refining nature means diminishing again and again, eradicating self-interest, striving to be warm, moist, integral, and pure, matching virtue with jade—then the inner refinement of the self is perfected. Once inner refinement is perfected, one may approach the furnace to gather the medicine and perform the work of a moment. When the time arrives and the mechanism stirs, one *takes from Kan to fill Li*, gathers lead to subdue mercury. The single yang line within Kan is the prenatal Qian metal—this is called *golden fluid*. Refining form with it transforms the body into pure yang, rendering the physical frame eternally firm, just as gold is unyielding and indestructible. Thus it is said: *gold refines jade*. This is the concurrent cultivation of nature and life, the wondrous union of form and spirit.

Jade refinement is the Way of non-action; gold refinement is the technique of action. From non-action to action, and after action, returning again to non-action—then the principle of nature and life is attained, and the task of sagely cultivation is complete.”

**On Nature and Life**

“What is *xing* (nature)? What is *ming* (life)?”
It is said: “*Xing* is the single source of the myriad things; *ming* is what one establishes for oneself. Without *ming*, *xing* cannot manifest; without *xing*, *ming* lacks numinosity. *Xing* governs *ming*, while *ming* carries *xing*. Those who discourse today typically divide *xing* and *ming* into separate schools, unaware that Dao and vessel interpenetrate, being and non-being mutually arise, and emptiness and fullness give birth to one another—these cannot be split into two.

Thus, *xing* is spirit, while *ming* is essence and *qi*; *xing* is *Wuji* (Non-Ultimate), while *ming* is *Taiji* (Great Ultimate). Can they be separated? Some claim that Buddhists comprehend *xing*, while Daoists comprehend *ming*. This is not a comprehensive view. The Buddha’s teaching of ‘no-self’ shatters the view of clinging and attachment; the Dao’s discourse on ‘guarding the mother’ venerates the nameless origin. If one does not know *xing*, how can one know *ming*? Once *ming* is known, can *xing* be abandoned?

Thus, to discourse on *xing* without sinking into emptiness is to have *ming* within it; to guard the mother and return to simplicity is to have *xing* within it. This is called ‘comprehending *ming* through the ground of *xing*’—it is the wondrous union of form and spirit, the true merging with the Dao.”

Someone asked: “Your discourse on *xing* and *ming* is already clear and exhaustive. May I ask: what is *xing* in a person? What is its substance? Can it be seen?”
It was said: “*Xing* cannot be seen. What enables seeing is *xing* itself. To seek what enables seeing in what cannot be seen is to distance oneself further from *xing*. Why? *Xing* as a thing can be seen without intent, but cannot be sought with intent. Of old, the Old Sage called the Great Simplicity ‘nameless,’ and the Yellow Emperor sought the Dark Pearl in the formless—these metaphors of the ancients carry profound meaning.

Let me speak of what gives rise to a person’s life! The true *Wuji*, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously conjoin and coalesce. What is called *xing* is the *Wuji*; what is called *ming* is the essence of the Two and Five. When these two wondrously conjoin, a person begins to live. Before their birth, what is called *Wuji* is a primal chaos, a vast undifferentiation—what form, what name? What sound, what thread? What scent, what voice?”

When the Two and Five have coalesced and attained the One to become numinous—what thought, what action? What concern, what scheming? This is the original substance of *xing*. Yet once the passions and perceptions arise, the original substance is chiseled away.

Master Zhang said: “Only after form does there arise the *xing* of *qi* and material disposition. Returning to goodness preserves the *xing* of Heaven and Earth.” What is called passions and perceptions is the *xing* of *qi* and material disposition; what is relinquished of the original substance is the *xing* of Heaven and Earth. Laozi said: “Return to the Unhewn, return to the infant, return to the *Wuji*—” this is the “returning to goodness.” Thus the essential task of cultivating the Dao is nothing prior to refining *xing*. When *xing* is settled and the *qi*-disposition cannot burden it, the original substance appears.

My teacher’s poem says:
*“Not deluded, *xing* abides of itself;
Abiding *xing*, *qi* returns of itself.
Returning *qi*, the elixir congeals of itself—
Within the crucible, Kan and Li are paired.”*
This is the postnatal attaining the prenatal and wondrously activating its function—what is called “comprehending *ming* depends on *xing*.”

**On the Disposition of *Xing***
*“There is only one *xing*—why then the distinction between original *xing* and material *xing*?”*
It is said: “Original *xing* is spoken of from the prenatal perspective: pure, tranquil, perfectly luminous, complete in itself. The sage does not add to it, nor does the fool diminish it. Material *xing* is spoken of from the postnatal perspective: born of the self-interest of form and *qi*, it begins to have distinctions of clarity and turbidity, thickness and thinness.

Moreover, the transformations and conjoinings of the Two and Five give rise to the ten thousand differences among beings. Their uneven admixtures originate in the moment of receiving *qi* in the womb. Why? From beginninglessness until today, we have all used passions and desires to distort the original root of *ming*. Chasing circumstances, we generate thoughts; encountering things, we produce emotions—long habituated. In the meantime, the *qi* received may be pure or impure, so the depth of cravings varies, yet all borrow the original *xing* to enact their self-interested agendas.

Material *xing* in a person cannot act on its own; what enables its action is always the borrowing of numinosity from the original *xing*—like a haughty servant or a bastard son who borrows the master’s authority to issue commands. Thus it is often compared: *Xing* is like water; falling into the *qi*-disposition, it is like water entering mud and mire. If you cut a channel and let it flow, you see only mud and mire, not the water. Can mud and mire move on their own? It is the water that moves them—but the water is mixed with mud and mire and thus unseen.

If you settle it for a long time, the clear rises to the top and the turbid sinks to the bottom. Cut a channel and let it flow—nothing but water. This is the power of settling and returning to goodness.”

**On the Chamber of the Spirit**

“Is the original *xing* distinct from the original spirit?”
“Original *xing* is the original spirit—there is no distinction. Because it is numinously penetrating and unfathomable, wondrously responsive yet without fixed form, it is called *shen* (spirit). That it is called *original* serves to distinguish it from postnatal thoughts and deliberations.”

“Does the spirit in a person also have a dwelling?”
“As I have heard from the Perfected Master of Purple Clarity, a person has three valleys, which are the hollows of the original spirit and the abode of the numinous *xing*. These hollows are like valleys, hence also called *valley spirit*. When the spirit abides, there is life; when it departs, there is death. By day it engages with things; by night it engages with dreams. The spirit cannot rest in its dwelling.

*The Spiritual Pivot of the Inner Canon* states: ‘The celestial valley holds the original spirit; guard it to preserve your authenticity.’ Within the human body, the upper is called the *Celestial Valley*—this is the *Mud Pill*; the middle is called the *Responsive Valley*—this is the *Crimson Palace*; the lower is called the *Numinous Valley*—this is the *Pass of Origin*. These three valleys are where the spirit resides, and they are called the *Three Fields*.

I have composed a discourse on them:
The *Mud Pill* is the original palace where the spirit dwells;
The *Crimson Palace* is the bright hall where governance is enacted;
The *Numinous Valley* is the secluded chamber for cultivation and refinement.

Thus, when the original spirit resides in the *Crimson Palace*, the ears hear, the eyes see, the five senses perform their functions, and the hundred limbs follow its commands. When the original spirit resides in the *Numinous Valley*, vision turns inward, hearing withdraws, spirit and *qi* guard one another, and the *hun* and *po* souls embrace unity.

Master Yang said: ‘Conceal the heart in the abyss to beautify its numinous root.’ The abyss is the deep, obscure, unfathomable place—this is the *Numinous Valley*, where the spirit is concealed.”

**Discourse on the River Chariot**

When the spirit is thus concealed, this is called "returning to the root." Returning to the root is called quiescence; quiescence is called the restoration of life. Then one sees spirit and *qi* guarding one another, embracing unity without separation. When quiescence reaches its utmost and movement arises, this is the spirit. It then rides the mechanism of *qi* and ascends to the *Mud Pill*, at which point the path of the River Chariot begins to open.

It is essential to know that the route of the River Chariot is none other than the Conception and Governor Vessels before and behind the body. When *qi* first ascends, it wells up gently and steamily, steeping between the two kidneys, vast as the rising tide, fluid as melting ice. Overflowing above the five transport points, it courses like water spilling beyond its channels. I swiftly guide the spirit to revolve and return to the *Weilü*, causing it to ascend along the *Weilü*, pass through the *Jiaji* Double Pass, rise to the *Fengfu*, and reach straight to the *Mud Pill*. When spirit and *qi* meet here, their free flow and fusion are self-evident.

After a while, it descends as fresh and sweet fluid, flowing down from the *Double Towers* to the *Crimson Palace*, entering the *Purple Court*, and returning to its concealed abode to rest. Through such circulation and infusion, over time and with mastery, *qi* fills the Three Fields, above and below interpenetrate, and it is said: *"Always let qi surge through the joints, and naturally essence will be full and the Valley Spirit preserved."* At this stage of creation, the signs of internal refinement appear. Yet without profound attainment and true realization, how could one know the savor of my words?

**Discourse on Clarifying the Spirit**

"You have spoken of the dwelling where the spirit is concealed, and I have received your instruction. May I ask about the essence of concealing the spirit?"

"It is said: Concealing the spirit is congealing the spirit. The essence of congealing the spirit lies first in clarifying the spirit; the essence of clarifying the spirit lies first in dispelling desires. The *Sutra of Purity* states: *'Dispel desires, and the heart becomes still; clarify the heart, and the spirit becomes clear.'* The *Book of Changes* says: *'The sage uses this to wash the heart and withdraw it into secrecy.'* This 'washing the heart' is precisely what is meant by clarifying the spirit. Master Zhou said: *'Without desires, there is quiescence.'* This 'without desires' is the thorough dispelling of desires.

The human spirit delights in clarity, yet the heart disturbs it; the human heart delights in stillness, yet desires pull it. Here, 'heart' has two aspects: the heart that disturbs the spirit is the deluded heart; the heart that delights in stillness is the true heart. If there is a deluded heart, it startles the spirit—how can the spirit remain clear? Once the spirit is startled, it clings to the myriad things; once it clings to the myriad things, craving arises; once craving arises, vexation follows; vexation and delusion bring sorrow and suffering to body and mind—how can the heart remain still?

Thus, the essence of clarifying the spirit lies first in dispelling desires. To dispel them: inwardly observe the heart, and the heart is no-heart—know that the three hearts cannot be grasped. Outwardly observe the form, and the form is no-form; observe things from afar, and things are no-things—know that the four marks are all forgotten. When these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen, and the person is empty. When emptiness is empty of emptiness, and that emptiness is also empty, then profound stillness abides—this is the emptiness of dharmas. Thus, the roots and dust are forever stilled, the six desires do not arise, and the heart is still. When the heart is still, the spirit becomes clear, like water without waves, vast and limpid.

Master Xu Zhenjun’s *Song of the Great Dao* says: *'To keep the spirit within the body from departing, do not leave a single thing in the numinous terrace. When things remain in the heart, the spirit is not clear, dissipating true essence and harming sinews and bones.'* The teaching of dispelling desires and clarifying the spirit awaits the sage of a hundred generations—my words will not change."

**Discourse on Nurturing the Spirit**

"Since the spirit is already clarified, what more can be added?"

"Nurture it. Nurturing means veiling the spirit’s radiance to prevent its exposure. As a thing, the spirit grows clearer the more it is clarified, and brighter the clearer it becomes. For stillness generates wisdom, and thus numinous light shines forth, illuminating all without obstruction. *Zhuangzi* says: *'In perfect quiescence, there is emanation of heavenly light.'* Yet if it is used without cease, it becomes too exposed and harms one’s original nature. *Zhuangzi* also says: *'The ancients who cultivated the Dao used wisdom to nurture tranquility.'* Wisdom arises, yet it is used to nurture tranquility—this is called using tranquility to nurture wisdom.

The *Pivot of Sitting in Forgetfulness* states: *'Wisdom unused is true wisdom, appearing foolish; this enriches both stillness and wisdom, a dual beauty without limit.'* The *Dao De Jing* says: *'Profound, it seems uncarved; turbid, it seems murky.'* And again: *'The multitude are bright; I alone seem dull. The common folk are sharp; I alone seem muddled.'* These are all essential principles of nurturing the spirit."

---

**Discourse on Congealing the Spirit**

"Since the spirit is already nurtured, why concern oneself with congealing it?"

"It is said: Congealing the spirit is the use within non-use, the study of fulfilling life. The *Cantong Qi* states: *'Manage and nurture the root and stem, congealing the spirit to form the body.'* Moreover, cultivating concentration in the *Li Palace* is the essence of meditation; seeking the mysterious in the *Water Mansion* is the aim of alchemy. Clarifying the spirit is vital, but congealing the spirit is urgent.

The *Cui Xu Yin* says: *'Long ago, I met my teacher and received the oral transmission: simply congeal the spirit and enter the qi cave.'* This 'qi cave' is none other than the root and stem within us. In my earlier *Discourse on the Spirit Chamber*, this was already made clear and exhaustive. I fear that scholars may know only how to clarify the spirit but not where to congeal it, leaving them without a destination and unable to meet the origin of returning to the root and restoring life. Or they may know how to nurture the spirit but not the method of congealing it, leaving them without a starting point and unable to fathom the subtleties of creation’s ebb and flow. Thus, I set forth what I have heard and compose this discourse."

The congealing of spirit is the essential principle of entering the profound and the foremost tenet of the alchemical tradition. By "congealing," we do not mean a stagnant immobility; rather, it is the spirit entering the qi cave and abiding with it without separation. Laozi said: *"Carrying your soul and embracing the One, can you never depart from it?"* The qi cave is that which we receive at the inception of our embryonic qi, formed from the essence and qi of our parents—it is the Supreme Ultimate inherent in each of us. Its names vary: qi sea, Pass of Origin, Spirit Valley, lower field, Heavenly Root, Stem of Life, Returning-Root Aperture, or Gate of Restored Life—yet it is one and the same place.

When we dwell in the womb, our breath and qi communicate with our mother. Once the umbilical cord is severed at birth, we establish our own furnace and cauldron, setting up a separate heaven and earth, and with every inhalation and exhalation, the qi invariably returns to its original cavity. Breath is the foundation of our life: if in a single moment the breath fails to come and go, the qi ceases and death ensues. Exhalation is the expansion of qi, the unfolding of yang; inhalation is the contraction of qi, the gathering of yin. One exhalation and one inhalation together are called a single breath. Physicians use this to assess the qi, and rightly so.

Zhuangzi said: *"The breath of the common people is at the throat, while the breath of the perfected person is at the heels."* "At the heels" means deeply entering the cavity. The common people do not fail to breathe from the heels, but their spirit is not present; though their breath moves in and out, they are unaware of it, as if it were merely at the throat. The perfected person, however, aligns the spirit with the breath, deeply entering the original cavity, continuously abiding without the slightest interruption. Thus, they concentrate the qi to attain suppleness, embrace the One without separation, and in utter emptiness and profound stillness, observe the return.

By "alignment," we do not mean chasing after the breath but rather abiding with it in a manner of neither forgetting nor forcing. When the spirit aligns with the breath, it congeals; when the spirit congeals, the qi also congeals. When the spirit aligns with the breath, it harmonizes; when the spirit harmonizes, the qi also harmonizes—this is the principle of mutual dependence. The method of congealing the spirit begins with regulating the breath. Regulating the breath means aligning with it.

*Discourse on True Breath*
Breath is of two kinds: ordinary breath and true breath. Ordinary breath is the qi that enters and exits through the mouth and nose; true breath is embryonic breath, circulating within the original cavity. This is what Master Huiweng described as *"breathing softly and gently, like a fish in a spring pond."* When ordinary breath ceases, true breath moves of its own accord. The cessation of ordinary breath does not come from forcibly suppressing it; rather, in utter emptiness and profound stillness, the heart becomes ever more refined, and the qi ever more subtle.

Those who discuss this today know only how to regulate the breath but fail to recognize the pitfall of chasing the qi with the heart. This is because the restless, competitive heart of the ordinary person has not been trained in regulation. If one suddenly attempts to align with the breath, how can the heart willingly comply? Inevitably, one becomes deliberate. With deliberation, the qi is not yet settled, and the heart is already stirred—is this not the spirit being enslaved by the qi? Therefore, I say: *"Regulating the breath means naturally aligning with it, not chasing after it."* Regulating the breath begins with regulating the heart.

Regulating the heart means gathering the thoughts to return to stillness, maintaining this whether moving, resting, sitting, or lying down, always abiding within the cavity. With long practice, the habit becomes second nature, and one naturally becomes purified and pliable, harmonizing with the breath. In harmony, there is alignment; aligned but not chasing, ordinary breath ceases of itself, and true breath moves spontaneously. The bellows are set in motion, refining essence into qi, which rises and pervades, irrigating the three palaces. This is the true bellows, the true cauldron and furnace, the true firing times.

*Discourse on the Fire Talisman*

“Is there an explanation for taking true breath as fire?”

“There is. The ancient immortals’ words abound, such as:
*‘Do not idly watch the medicine furnace for firing times—*
*Simply settle the spirit and breath, letting nature take its course.*
*Cease your toil at the elixir hearth and river chariot;*
*The crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath will flow on of themselves.’*
Yet these do not mean taking breath as fire. Fire is the fire of spirit; breath is but the bellows of that fire.

When spirit and qi guard one another, the spirit remains in non-doing, while the qi mechanism cannot but move. Thus, with each closing and opening, it circulates up and down through the meridians. What perceives this movement? The spirit. As the qi flows unimpeded, the primordial spirit alone awakens. Spirit and qi merge, tension and ease harmonizing—this is the evenness of fire’s power, and only then is the elixir completed and the medicine achieved.

I have likened the bellows to true breath, and there is reason in this. When a smith casts metal, he must first pump the bellows, and only then does the fire ignite and the metal begin to melt. If one merely blows with a gusting wind, the fire scatters, and the metal will never transform. Why? The gusting wind comes and goes unpredictably—this is the breath of ordinary men through the throat. The bellows’ wind flows ceaselessly—this is the true person’s breath through the heels. Spirit rests in breath and fuses with it, just as fire is kindled by wind; qi is transformed by spirit, just as metal is refined by fire. Such is the clarity of this analogy!”

One might ask: “The fire-tally advances and retreats, ‘morning in *tun*, evening in *meng*’—are their principles the same or different?”

I reply: “In the past, before receiving my teacher’s guidance, I privately considered the firing times difficult to discern. I once tried to measure them by the celestial revolution, align them with the hexagrams’ qi, and divide them by watches and clepsydra drops—all to no avail. Only afterward did I suddenly awaken in great clarity. Then I understood that the ten thousand volumes of elixir classics and the six hundred firing records could all be discarded at a single word. The saying that ‘true fire has no timing’ and ‘the great medicine has no fixed weight’ is indeed true—it did not deceive me.

Refining the medicine involves both inner and outer aspects, so the firing times vary in complexity. As for inner refinement, one phrase suffices: ‘Gently, subtly, as if present, yet not.’ The ‘outer medicine’ here does not refer to the outer medicine discussed earlier, but rather to the celestial and terrestrial origins. The ‘tally’ means alignment with the Dao of Heaven. In elixir methods, the cyclical stems of the moon—*geng* and *jia*—symbolize the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal material, while the solar terms of the day—*zi* and *wu*—mark the waxing and waning of the firing times. The phrase ‘morning in *tun*, evening in *meng*’ merely describes the principle of advance and retreat—nothing more. Once the meaning is grasped, the images may be forgotten.

The *Wuzhen Pian* states:
‘The inner medicine is like the outer medicine,
Inner and outer must both be penetrated.
The elixir head blends in harmonious accord,
Nurtured by twofold workings in warmth.
Within, there is the natural true fire,
The furnace ever glowing crimson.
The outer furnace’s increase and decrease demand diligent effort—
Nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed.’

The ‘true seed’ is the human origin—this is the final verdict on the fire-tally.”

“Are medicine and fire the same or different?”

It is said: “Medicine and fire may be distinguished, yet they may also unite. When separated, they differ; when conjoined, they are one. Why? Speaking of them as distinct: medicine is the primordial qi, while fire is the primordial spirit. Speaking of them as united: medicine is fire, and fire is medicine. He who knows only unity and not distinction will fail in gathering and refinement; he who knows only distinction and not unity will lack the method for nurturing and warming. Why? At the time of gathering, medicine resides without while fire abides within—fire draws in medicine, so medicine and fire may be distinguished. During the phase of nurturing, medicine, though initially without, returns within, and with medicine present, fire is set in motion—thus medicine and fire may unite.

In essence, fire is the master: if fire is too fierce, the elixir is harmed; if fire is too cool, the elixir scatters. When fire alone is mentioned without reference to medicine, it refers to the work of the ten months; when medicine alone is mentioned without reference to fire, it refers to the effort of a brief moment. As the Purple Clarity Immortal Master said: ‘Refining medicine with fire to form the elixir’—this is precisely ‘guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao,’ a statement of utmost clarity.”

**On Withdrawal and Addition**

Someone asked: “May I hear the essential meaning of ‘withdrawing lead and adding mercury’?”

It was said: “I have heard that after Master Liyang obtained the medicine and returned it to the crucible, he nurtured it with the natural true fire, continuous and unceasing as though present. Within it, the transformations of withdrawal and addition all arise naturally, allowing no trace of human artifice or force to intervene.”

For the Dao is non-action, yet spirit and qi naturally act—such is the marvel of creation. The analogy of cooking rice with grain contains profound meaning, far beyond merely illustrating its simplicity. When lead is added to mercury, it is like water poured into rice. The water must not be excessive, nor the rice too scant, just as the two and the eight must be in perfect balance. When the fire’s intensity is evenly regulated, the water gradually dries while the rice expands—thus rice is made. The gradual drying of water is what is meant by "withdrawing lead"; the expansion of rice is what is meant by "adding mercury." Withdrawal is not a reduction from within: spirit enters qi as heaven’s qi moves through earth, its hidden mechanism unseen. Addition is not an increase from without: qi enfolds spirit as earth’s qi receives heaven, gradually nurturing growth. Through this, the embryo is perfected, spirit transforms, and a body arises beyond the body. The marvel of creation reaches this point—all unfolding of itself, with no one knowing how it comes to be. If one seeks to grasp the *how* of withdrawal and addition, one falls into intentionality and loses the natural. This "natural" itself holds profound meaning. My master told me: *"Follow the natural, do not merely heed it."* How profound! These words!

"Legacy Discourse"

Someone asked: *"The various alchemical classics speak of red lead, black mercury, green dragon, white tiger, white snow, yellow sprout, Wood Elder, Metal Mother, infant maiden, and yellow matron—so many names and terms, their number beyond easy enumeration. Yet in your writings, you set all these aside and say nothing of them. Do you intend some unspoken teaching?"*

I replied: *"No. Listen quietly, and I shall try to explain. Formerly, I was a scholar of chapters and verses, my learning a mere glimpse into the mystic garden, lacking any prior insight. By chance and karmic encounter, I received the true transmission and came to know the direct and simple path. All the names and terms you mentioned, I once studied thoroughly and savored in detail. Yet grasping one meant losing another, and they only served as obstacles. Only later did I realize that the great Dao is not cumbersome—it can be summed up in a single word.*

*The Dao is nothing beyond the interplay of one yin and one yang. Yin is essence, yang is qi, and spirit governs both. Thus spirit, qi, and essence are the three grades of the supreme medicine. All the terms—dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, and the myriad other names—are based on this. The ancient immortals left such teachings not out of a desire to lightly disclose, but to obscure the gates with tangled words, multiplying paths so that earnest students might penetrate meaning through text and distill the vast into the essential. Only when innate truth has accumulated over time and suddenly becomes clear does one cast off the snares of language and directly perceive the root."*

Someone asked: *"In your *Mystic Skin*, you discuss the outer medicine extensively, yet say little of gathering, refinement, and union. How are students to proceed?"*

I replied: *"Gathering, refinement, and union are the most recondite mysteries of the Supreme, the essential heart-mind transmitted by a thousand sages. I do not refuse to point them out, but my master’s command was strict, and so as I write, I tremble with awe. Yet in what I have already discussed, the key seems already revealed—only veiled in subtle words, unnoticed. As the *Canticle* says: ‘After a thousand cycles, brilliance shines forth; after ten thousand repetitions, it may be seen.’ If earnest students can persist through a thousand cycles and ten thousand repetitions, they will refine their understanding and perceive the wondrous meaning. But without the frustration of seeking without attainment, who would know how rare it is to hear of the Dao? And without the joy of mutual delight in its unfolding, who would find savor in my words? Enough, enough—I shall now fall silent."*

**Preface**

The ancient immortals’ methods of elixir-crafting fill the alchemical canons, numbering no fewer than a thousand scrolls. To read them is to grow ever more entangled and perplexed; to grasp them is to find them utterly simple and effortless. The great essential lies in observing the Dao of Heaven and holding fast to Heaven’s movements—these two suffice to encompass all. The alternation of yin and yang, their pairing as two, is the Dao of Heaven; the revolutions of sun and moon, their radiance intermingling day and night, are Heaven’s movements. As the *Canticle* says: *“Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Changes course between them.”* The Changes here refer to *li* and *kan*. The sages, knowing this to be so, modeled their elixir methods accordingly. Thus they took Qian and Kun as the crucible and furnace, the Crow and Hare as the medicinal ingredients. The waxing and waning cycles within—these they took as the fire-phases and the tally of yin.

The *Scripture* states: *“Sun and moon have their measures, great and small their fixed spans; sagely work arises therein, and numinous clarity emerges.”* To summarize: the entire art lies in stealing the mechanism and reversing its course. This Dao, though near at hand, cannot be exhausted in words nor attained through mere study. Yet if one meets a master and receives the oral transmission, with the affinity of needle and lodestone, then understanding may dawn in an instant. The greatest hindrance is that people lack the nature of wisdom, unable to penetrate and fathom deeply, and so their seeking strays ever farther. Or else they are swayed by specious arguments or ensnared by preconceived notions, such that poison fumes the heart and ink-black delusion seeps into the bones—what can I do for such as these?

I, an empty and humble man, was fortunate to encounter a sagely teacher, who guided me for many years. Relying on a sliver of heaven’s grace that did not obstruct, I suddenly beheld the hall and chamber—realizing that such an encounter in this age is rarer than a thousand ages past. Seekers of the Dao from the four directions, deeming me teachable, have each brought their masters’ transmissions to compare and verify, but what I have heard differs widely, like tenon and mortise ill-fitted. Not that the Dao itself varies, but that each school’s gate and window are distinct. As Laozi said: *“The great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways.”*

The Dao of the Golden Elixir is supremely easy, supremely simple. Any contrivance or arrangement strays into falsity and departs from the natural. Thus what I have illustrated here traces the roots to their ultimate origins, directly pointing to the art of destiny, lifting the warp to expound the essentials—its great meaning shining forth. The aim is to remain true to my teacher’s intent, offering critical refutations to expose heterodox schools. If those who love the Dao ponder and attain insight, perhaps they may fulfill their nature and destiny, unconfused by the errors of many divergent paths!

Written in the last third of the twelfth lunar month of the *gengwu* year, by Qianxuzi at the Western Meditation Hut of Nansha.

**The Diagram of the Primordial Limitless**
Laozi said:

“There is a thing formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth.
I know not its name, and so forcefully call it the Dao.”

It also says:
“Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth.”

And further:
“The world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of all under heaven.”

This is the primordial, undifferentiated True Unity qi—the root-source from which heaven and earth, humans and all things are born. Before any impulse of movement arises, it is dark and formless, silent and scentless, called the Limitless. In humans, it corresponds to the state of utter stillness without response, absolute quiescence. The Buddhist notion of *true emptiness*, the Confucian idea of *the state before arousal*—these are none other than what Laozi describes as “constantly without desire to observe its mystery,” what the *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* calls “the sage thereby cleanses the mind and retreats to concealment in secrecy,” and what the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* terms “taking only the utmost stillness, relying on the power of stillness.” Thus, to permanently sever afflictions and fully realize accomplishment, one need not rise from seated meditation to enter nirvana. The sages of the Three Teachings share a single aim; only their methods differ, hence the distinctions among the three.

**Diagram of the Undivided Supreme Polarity**
As the *Wuzhen pian* states:
“The Dao, from emptiness, gives birth to the One qi,
And from the One qi, yin and yang emerge.”

“Supreme” denotes the state in which yin and yang are embodied yet undivided. Laozi says, “The Dao gives birth to the One.” The One is the Supreme Polarity. In us, it is called the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female is the natural union of true essence and wondrous harmony—what is termed “generating being from non-being” and “creating reality within emptiness.” It is the root of spirit and qi, the aperture of nature and destiny. Laozi says, “Ever having desire, one observes its manifestations.” The study of observing manifestations has served as the foundation for the sages and perfected ones of all ages to establish destiny, and from it the sagely work arises, the numinous emerges.

**Diagram of the Supreme Polarity Dividing into Yin and Yang**
Laozi says, “The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two.” This is the Supreme Polarity dividing into the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes separate, heaven envelops earth externally while earth resides within heaven, and the wondrous interplay of yin within yang and yang within yin is contained therein. How so? From emptiness, the One qi is born—this is the movement arising from extreme stillness, the yang within yin. The Two Modes divide, heaven enveloping earth externally while earth resides within heaven—this is the stillness contained within movement, the yin within yang. As Master Shao says, “The essence of yin and yang mutually abide in each other’s dwelling.” Thus, in the elixir method, one employs yang within yin and yin within yang, always taking stillness as the foundation. Laozi says, “Heaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness.” For one who can be still, this is called embracing the Origin and guarding the One, thereby returning to the Limitless.

**Diagram of Yin and Yang Mutually Abiding**
Once heaven and earth are separated, the sun and moon revolve, their radiance intersecting to generate transformation. The sun and moon are the essence of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. In the hexagrams, they correspond to *Li* and *Kan*. The yin within *Li* is called the Raven’s Essence; the yang within *Kan* is called the Hare’s Marrow. In the elixir method, the Raven and Hare serve as medicinal substances, hence employing yang within yin and yin within yang. This is what is meant by “the east enters the western neighbor, the west returns to the eastern abode”—merely recognizing the essence of mutual abiding, stealing its mechanism, and reversing its use.

**Diagram of Kan and Li in Conjunction**
The ancient immortals’ creation of the elixir hinged on gathering the medicine. The medicine has its weights and measures, its gathering has its seasons, and its inversion has its methods. The essentials lie in the moon’s emergence at the first *geng* day, lead’s birth after *gui*, with *zi* south and *wu* north serving as the guiding principles. There are oral instructions not committed to writing.

**Diagram of the Elixir’s Formation**
As the *Wuzhen pian* states:
“Tiger leaps, dragon soars—waves surge roughly,
At the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born.”

And further:
“Only when the medicine meets its kind does it manifest form;
The Dao lies in the subtle and formless, harmonizing with nature.”

Know that this single point is called neither lead nor mercury but the Elixir—naturally formed from the intersection of sun and moon’s radiance, the harmony of yin and yang qi. The character for “elixir” (*dan*) resembles the sun and moon. The *Xinyin jing* says: “The Elixir is within the body, neither white nor green.” For while the Green Dragon and White Tiger still belong to two families, once they return to the body, they merge into one. Hence it is said to be neither white nor green.

Someone may ask: “What is the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir?”
It is called “returned” because what was lost is regained. It is called “golden liquor” because it is formed by gathering the gold within water, uniting it with one’s own mercury.

**Diagram of the Circulating Fire of the Celestial Cycle**

Here the meaning must be grasped while the image is forgotten;
To exhaust the hexagrams is but to labor the mind in vain.

*Diagram of Returning to the Origin*

At this stage of practice, not a single phrase can be spoken,
Not a single word can be employed.

*Preface to "The Orthodox Chapter on the Accomplished Golden Elixir" by Lu Xixing*

I have surveyed the ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures, and all speak of the great medicine of longevity as necessarily formed from the primordial True One’s qi. When asked whence this qi arises, they invariably point to "that place." Yet within our own bodies, is there truly no such qi, that we must seek it elsewhere? Those who believe are few, while those who doubt are legion.

From my early years, I, Xixing, have been devoted to this Dao, yet my dull roots and foolish nature prevented me from penetrating its essence. At times, I would take up the *Cantong qi* or *Wuzhen pian*, opening their pages to read—only to find the path overgrown with brambles, the way rough and impassable. Later, I studied under the commentator Yu Yan, who pointed me toward the Dao of purity and non-action. All practices involving cultivation outside the body were dismissed as heterodox paths; the golden crucible and fire talismans were all deemed mere metallurgy. Thus, I clung to my first impressions, unshakably fixed. Alas!

Indeed, if it were truly pure and still, why would lesser scholars erupt in laughter, and why would slander arise so readily? Reading these words, I could not help but doubt.

In the dingwei year of the Jiajing era, by some karmic convergence, I chanced upon the Dharma Patriarch Lü in a thatched hall by the Northern Sea. Our stay together was long and our exchange warm; he offered me the dark elixir and consoled me with kind words. Such a meeting across three lifetimes is a rarity of a thousand years. He then urged me forward with the supreme Dao, beginning with the principle that the union of yin and yang constitutes the Way.

At the time, I foolishly raised the theories of the Three Peaks to question him, only to be rebuked. Yet he once taught me the songs of embryo formation and the essentials of chamber entry. His subtle words and profound discourses filled volumes, which I recorded and preserved. Though I pondered his teachings, I could not yet grasp them fully. Thus, twenty years passed in hesitation, nearly betraying my teacher’s kindness.

In the jiazi year, during the twelfth lunar month, I retreated to the wilderness. Gazing into a mirror, I lamented the passage of time—my temples streaked with gray—realizing my aspirations remained unfulfilled and that days were slipping away. Then, moved by a dream in which my late teacher appeared, I cast off old attachments and embraced the present. Suddenly, I awakened, recalling eight or nine out of ten of his past instructions. Cross-referencing them with the *Cantong qi*, the *Wuzhen pian*, and other scriptures, I pored over them again and again. In moments of quiet reflection, my nature and spirit became clear, as if I had gained true insight. Thus, I composed this work.

Confucius said, “Reviewing the old, one gains new understanding.” What I have reviewed is the old, yet what I now understand is new. Though these are but my own tentative interpretations, not yet refined by those of the Dao, they may at least not stray from my teacher’s intent.

Written on the waning moon of the twelfth lunar month in the jiazi year of the Jiajing era by Qianxuzi.

**Postscript**
In the Dao of the Golden Elixir, refining the self comes first.

When the self is refined, the spirit settles; when the spirit settles, qi abides; when qi abides, essence congeals. The people find peace, the state grows prosperous, and with a single battle, the world is pacified.

Long ago, my teacher instructed me: *"If one can cultivate purity for a hundred days, all may become womb immortals."* A hundred days of disciplined practice, a moment to obtain the medicine. Ten months of firing, shedding the womb to transform the spirit, altering form to become immortal—how could this not be effortless? Yet in this world, such people are rare. Why is this so?

Those with shallow roots hear the Dao but do not believe; those with scant learning verify the Dao but not truly. Blind teachers mislead, pointing east while calling it west, unable to distinguish Yue from Yan, or blue from white. When occasionally questioned with the *Cantong qi* or *Wuzhen pian*, they fail to analyze them clearly, instead claiming that old words are easily found, but oral secrets are rare—hinting at hidden methods of "opening the passes and unfolding the apertures," or the principles of "detaching from form to merge with qi." Eager students, upon hearing such words, crave swift success and hope for luck. They burn incense, swear oaths to heaven, offer gold to secure their requests. A single phrase enters their ears, lodging deep in their hearts, while the *Cantong qi* and *Wuzhen pian* are left gathering dust on high shelves.

Yet the Dao of yin and yang—of resonance between like kinds—when followed, makes one human; when reversed, makes one immortal. All occurs naturally, without artifice. Have you not read the verse in the *Wuzhen pian*: *"Cease expending cunning and deceit as effort"*? Or the *Cantong qi*: *"What is naturally so, not some deviant or false path"*? The ancient immortals left these words to guide others—when did they ever conceal secrets? Yet they never spoke of "opening the passes," "unfolding the apertures," "detaching from form," or "merging with qi." Now such claims exist—knowing this, one realizes that adding a snake’s legs devalues even a steed’s bones. The peril of the Great Dao lies in such people.

Alas! Fish eyes passed off as pearls, swallow stones as treasures. The world favors petty arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao. What can be done?

My teacher once told me: *"The *Cantong qi* and *Wuzhen pian* are the stairway to entering the Dao."* Yet their words are subtle, their meanings profound, not easily dissected. Only after twenty years of deep immersion did I begin to grasp them clearly. And even then, I did not achieve sudden enlightenment through intuition alone—it was through long study and the confirmation of my teacher’s words.

Having gained some small insight, I dare not keep it to myself. Thus, I compose this work to seek correction from those of the Dao. Yet this is but a broad outline. As for the subtle principles of inner chamber practice, the details of internal and external firing—these are already contained in those two books. How could I presume to add to them? How could I presume to add to them?

Written again by Qianxuzi. End of the first chapter.

One asked Master Qianxu: "The alchemical classics speak of the primordial unity of *qi*, which must be sought among those of the same kind. What does this mean?"

He replied: "I have heard from my teacher that the Way of the Golden Elixir necessarily relies on the union of *yin* and *yang* to take form. *Yin* and *yang*—one male, one female; one *li*, one *kan*; one lead, one mercury—these are the ingredients of the Great Elixir. The true *qi* of *kan* is called lead; the true essence of *li* is called mercury. The primordial essence is stored within me, while the primordial *qi* is drawn from the other. Why is this so? The other is *kan*—externally *yin* yet internally *yang*; in imagery, it is water and the moon, and in humanity, it is woman. I am *li*—externally *yang* yet internally *yin*; in imagery, it is fire and the sun, and in humanity, it is man. Thus, the Way of *yin* and *yang* between man and woman, when followed, gives birth to human life; when reversed, it produces the Elixir. The principle is one and the same."

The questioner said: "*Kan* is the middle son, and *li* is the middle daughter—this the *Book of Changes* has already made clear. Yet why do you now say that I am instead *li*?"

He replied: "This refers to the arrangement of the *xiantian* (precelestial) diagram."

Shaozi said: "The essence of *yin* and *yang* mutually dwell within their abodes."

Moreover, the Supreme Ultimate divides into the Two Modes, the Two Modes into the Four Images, and the Four Images into the Eight Trigrams—thus *li* pertains to *qian*, and *kan* pertains to *kun*. *Li* and *kan* are the trigrams formed by the union of *qian* and *kun*; man and woman are the physical forms produced by the union of *yin* and *yang*. Therefore, when *qian* and *kun* unite, *qian* cannot but become hollow and form *li*, while *kun* cannot but become replete and form *kan*. When man and woman unite, *yin* cannot but contain *yang*, and *yang* cannot but root itself in *yin*. Such is the distinction between *kan* and *li* as self and other.

The questioner said: "If the center of *li* is *yin*-essence and the center of *kan* is *yang*-*qi*, then within my own body, how can there be no essence and *qi* that I must instead seek from the other?"

He replied: "Indeed, this is so, but the explanation is incomplete. I once drowned in the teachings of the Old Man of Jade Chamber, and only now have I awakened. Pray listen in silence, and I shall attempt to explain.

I have heard from my master: '*Yin* and *yang*, the two fives, wondrously unite and congeal'—thus is a person born. In the beginning, the Great Simplicity remains uncarved, the undifferentiated whole of the Supreme Ultimate. Laozi said: 'One whose virtue is profoundly replete is like a newborn babe.' Unaware of the union of male and female, yet the genitals stir—such is the perfection of essence. Though it cries all day, its throat does not grow hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony. This is the purity of *yin* and *yang*. At this time, the precelestial body remains whole and complete—what need is there to seek, what purpose to replenish? If one attains and cultivates this, what more can be added to the supreme virtue of non-action?

Yet when the aperture of desire opens and *yin* and *yang* interact, the precelestial *qi* flees and scatters into *kun*. Thus, the three unbroken lines of pure *qian* break their form and become *li*. *Li* is the sun; when the sun declines, one sighs at advanced age—how can it endure for long? Therefore, the elixir method takes from *kan*. To take from *kan* is to mend the already broken *qian*, to fill its hollowed line, and to restore the body of pure *yang*. This is the teaching of the immortals' returning elixir."

He asked, "As *li*, I am what is attained only after the scattering and fleeing. Before that scattering, it was originally *kun*—why then is it called *kan*?"

He replied, "Excellent question! In the primordial state of undifferentiated wholeness, that which was originally the body of *kun* experienced the stirring of *yang* at the two-sevens' appointed time. When *yang* suddenly moves within pure *kun*, is this not *kan*? Thus, *kan* is the *yang* within *yin*—the stillness of the Supreme Ultimate reaching its extreme and giving rise to movement, arising spontaneously and naturally. This is called the precelestial. 'Heaven engenders water in the first,' and the true *yi* qi is concealed within *kan*. The mother hides the child in her womb; within water lies metal. To forge the golden elixir, one must draw from *kan*. This is the source of the medicine's river and the ladder for ascending to true realization.

Moreover, the *yang* within *yin* takes movement as its essence, so when drawing from *kan*, one must await its stirring. The *yin* within *yang* takes stillness as its essence, so after filling *li*, one must nurture it through stillness. Those who know movement and stillness and do not miss their proper times—are they not sages? Sages observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp the workings of Heaven. Thus, the waxing and waning of the moon mirror the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal ingredients, while the early and late hours of the sun correspond to the ebb and flow of the firing times. When medicine and fire are harmoniously aligned, the elixir is completed. Once the elixir is complete, one sheds the womb and undergoes spiritual transformation."

Another then asked, "All that you have discussed pertains to the postcelestial."

As for the prenatal—might there yet be something worth discussing?"

He replied, "I have sought its principles within the *Book of Changes*. The *Changes* states: ‘Essence and qi become things; the wandering soul brings transformation.’ Within *yin*, that which is *yang* is called *qi*; within *yang*, that which is *yin* is called *essence*. These two depend upon each other, and thus things are born. Observing the course of sequential generation, if essence arrives first and *qi* follows after, then *yin* envelops *yang* and a female is formed; if *qi* leads and essence follows, then *yang* envelops *yin* and a male is born. Thus, the distinction between *li* as male and *kan* as female is not determined only after form is complete, but is already predetermined at the moment of receiving *qi*.

Moreover, the Dao of the Golden Elixir is formed through the union of *yin* and *yang*. The human path follows the natural order, while the immortal path reverses the process—extracting the medicine from *kan* and refining the elixir within *li*. What doubt could remain?"

---

In the middle section, someone asked, "Our four great elements and this body are all of *yin*—yet when they move, do they not belong to *yang*?"

He replied, "*Li* is fire, the sun; though its movement belongs to *yang*, it is in truth rooted in *yin*. Thus it is said: fire is *yang* rooted in *yin*. Observe how the radiant light flashes uncontrollably—so too is the *yang* within our bodies. Hence, it is ever prone to reckless dissipation. The sage, knowing this, draws the true *yi* water from *kan* to restrain it. When passions blaze within and essence flees without, it is like fire raging below and water boiling in the cauldron. Drawing that prenatal true *yi* qi to subdue one’s reckless, wayward essence is like ladling spring water into a jar to quell the boiling in the cauldron—nothing is left unaccomplished."

"Then might the method of extracting from *kan* also be discussed?"

He said, "The celestial mechanism is most profound; without the master’s guidance, who would dare speak recklessly? Let me but open the gate—may you come to understand.

In the *Book of Changes*, thunder lies within the earth, forming the hexagram *Fu* (Return). Within the heavy *yin* of earth, *yang* suddenly stirs—this is the root of creation and the pivot of all things. Confucius, pondering the *Changes* to this point, could not help but sigh: ‘In *Fu*, do we not see the heart of Heaven and Earth?’ The *Cantong Qi* also speaks of this, saying: ‘The *Changes* governs the heart of Heaven; the hexagram *Fu* establishes the beginning.’ It further states: ‘Issue commands in accord with the seasons; do not miss the moment when the lines move.’ This is what it means.

Thus, knowing that thunder within the earth forms *Fu*, one knows that *yang* is born from *yin* and that the true *yi* qi is concealed therein. What need is there to say more?"

One might further ask: “In the growth of the elixir medicine, the alchemical classics often compare it to the ‘third day emerging from *geng*’—may I hear of this?” I reply: “*Kan* is the moon, and the moon is the Great *Yin*, which receives the sun’s light to generate brightness. On the third day emerging from *geng*, *yang* first sprouts—this is like the hexagram *Fu*. On the eighth day, the first quarter moon arrives, with two *yang* lines ascending; the eastern direction is full and abundant, and the three *yang* lines open into prosperity. The last quarter moon marks the decline of *yang*; the new moon marks its exhaustion. *Bo* (Splitting Apart) and *Fu* (Return) follow one another in endless succession, for an end is always a beginning. Thus, after three days, revival occurs. The workings of creation are just like this. The method of the elixir takes this as its model, using it to gauge the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal ingredients. My teacher instructed me, saying: ‘On the evening of the new moon, the medicine is in the crucible.’ He also said: ‘When snow gleams on the icy pool, and the plum branches bear the new moon in perfect clarity—only then may the medicine begin to grow.’ The celestial mechanism is profoundly subtle, and here it is fully revealed. In the past, I grasped the meaning of his words but could not fully comprehend them. Now, I suddenly understand, and I realize the depth of my teacher’s grace—luminous as the sun and moon held forth to grant me sight.”

One asks: “As for the maturity or tenderness of the medicinal ingredients, how are they to be used?”

“Gold elixir’s transformation is formed from the primordial True Unity’s qi. This primordial qi is light and pure, formless—yang within yang. Its inception is most subtle, its wonder unfathomable. Thus, one must swiftly gather it at the first stirrings of *gui*-born vitality, using it within the span of a single vigil. Even a slight delay allows dross to arise and shifts it into the postnatal, where yang reverts to yin. The *Wuzhen* poem says, ‘Seen yet unusable’—this speaks of overmaturity; ‘In a flash of fire and smoke, the True Person appears’—this speaks of speed. Alas! The wonder of transformation—who but a sage could know it? Who but a sage could wield it?”

In the following section, one asks: “The wonder of transformation is such that none but a sage can wield it. We are no sages—if one wishes to employ it, where lies the essential key?”

The master replies: “Did not your teacher say, ‘True earth seizes true lead; true lead governs true mercury’? What is true earth? It is the self’s earth. Those who gather the medicine yet do not refine their self’s earth will easily lose the numinous mercury, and their efforts will come to naught, bringing only hardship and humiliation. The *Classic* says, ‘Lay the foundation, refine the self’—this is what it means. The self, as a thing, is in man the will, also called the self-nature. Because it roams through the four images without fixed position, it is named ‘earth.’ The gold elixir’s entire process depends upon this. Thus, when refining the medicine to seek lead, one meets it with the self; when drawing fire into the crucible, one escorts it with the self; when simmering and bathing, one guards it with the self; when nurturing and delivering the embryo, one perfects it with the self. Rectify the heart and sincerely align the will, and the body is cultivated, the state governed, and all under heaven made peaceful. This is the pivot of elixir refinement. The *Canticle* says, ‘Turn the grain at the true axle.’ It also says, ‘The pole star abides in correctness.’”

“Ancient immortals left their teachings, earnest and repeated without end.

Moreover, parents give birth to me through passion and desire, thus the nature of temperament ever meets things and generates emotion. If refining the self proves ineffectual, the six roots remain unsettled; at the moment of entering the chamber, when great function appears before one, nature stirs and passion blazes, the maiden of mercury flees—how then can one seize the black dragon’s pearl from beneath its chin in the span of a single talisman?

The *Tradition* states: ‘To probe the tiger’s den, to pluck the tiger’s whiskers—how could one nearly escape the tiger’s jaws?’ Dangerous! Dangerous indeed! Without great wisdom, this cannot be broken; without great power, this cannot be attained.’

My master instructed me: ‘The mirror at the entrance lies within your heart. When the heart is not empty, the realm is not true.’

Alas! Is the principle of emptying the heart not the essential point of refining the self?

The *Sutra of Purity* says:
‘Look within at the heart—there is no heart;
Look without at the form—there is no form;
Look afar at things—there are no things.
When these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.
When the emptied is itself empty, even emptiness is no more.’

This is what emptying the heart means—the great liberation, the great repose of refining the self. Thus the following text continues: ‘Ever still, ever responsive.’

Ah! Ever still—this is the verification of refining the self; ever responsive—this is the function of seeking lead!

My master instructed me: ‘The medicine in the crucible on a moonlit night.’ I was commanded to respond, yet I was at a loss, unable to answer. Then I replied of my own accord: ‘Ashes on the seat of wind and flowers.’”

“Those who linger amid fleeting scenes often prize the four splendors of wind, flowers, snow, and moon. Confronted by circumstances, they give rise to emotions, endlessly occupied in response. Yet my master likens all such things to ashes upon the seat—is this not the state of forgetting the self, forgetting things, and even forgetting the act of forgetting?

The tally for gathering the medicine and the essentials of refining the self—what my master revealed to me is most profound. I once dimly grasped his words, and now I fully comprehend them.”

Upon hearing this, someone leapt up and exclaimed: “Without your words, I would never have heard the essentials of the great Dao. I beg to stop my ears to you; I shall withdraw to refine myself.”

*Seven Refutations* by Lu Xixing
*Refutation of the Critique of Non-Refutation*

After Lu received the teaching of *xingming* from his sagely master, scholars from all directions came to him to inquire into the Dao. When he sat and spoke with them, if they did not resonate, he would engage in repeated debate.

Some criticized him, saying: “The ancient sages declared: ‘Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Those who are good do not debate; those who debate are not good.’ Now, sir, as you discourse on the Dao with others, your mouth cannot rest—is this not wasteful of words and harmful to virtue?”

Lu replied: “I am at fault. Allow me to explain. In former times, Yang and Mo filled the world with their doctrines, obscuring benevolence and righteousness, and Mencius refuted them with words. Gongsun Chou asked: ‘Others all say you delight in debate—may I ask why?’ Mencius replied: ‘How could I delight in debate? I have no choice!’

Moreover, in an age when the great Dao prevails, people do not hold divergent views, and scholars do not pursue divergent teachings. Thus, the sage blends with the world in wordless harmony. Yet if the world cannot fully align with the sage’s intent, the sage grows concerned and is compelled to speak. Texts such as the *Yinfu*, *Daode*, *Cantong*, and *Wuzhen* are all the sage’s authenticated vouchers of the Dao—means to bring boundless benevolence to the world for all generations.

Yet there are blind and reckless teachers who, unable to follow the sacred scriptures or comprehend their texts, rely on their own whims to concoct teachings that bewilder the world. Their corruption of human hearts and confusion of the true Dao—what could be more disastrous? It is like a place untouched by the great light, where mountain goblins and wild foxes lure people into valleys. If one witnesses this, one must cry out and drive them away with all one’s strength, lest others fall into delusion and perish unawares. How could one conceal the truth and spare oneself from speaking?

If, however, you accuse me of self-regard, obstinacy, competitiveness, or delight in debate, then I have long since failed to clear my name before others.”

*Refutation of Falsehoods*

People of the world favor petty arts without discerning the depth of the Dao, allowing reckless and deceitful individuals to practice their unscrupulous techniques. Since the profound principles of the mysterious are difficult to fathom, and their hearts lack grounding, they are easily swayed and deceived. Let me briefly outline some of these false arts:

Some roast the fetus of a pregnant woman to practice grain avoidance; some ingest arsenic or sulfur to ward off cold; some wield lead swords to open the passes; some cultivate the “spirit turtle” to extend and retract; some shake their shoulders and spine to produce a rustling sound; some strike their skulls to produce a resonant echo; some sit motionless as stone; some drum their bellies like thunder; some hang upside-down like apes; some curl up like dragons; some spin lightly like the wind while holding their breath; some run swiftly as monkeys, leaving no one able to keep pace. Such practices are too numerous to list, yet they bear no relation to the ultimate Dao. They are merely displays of stubborn skill to embellish cunning—what Master Sima called “cleverly harboring schemes to seek worldly gain.”

Among these, the false arts of external alchemy and furnace fire are the most egregious. While silver essence can adhere to the body and be exchanged for minerals, methods of summoning and absorption abound in the world. Unaware learners mistake these for transmutation. How mistaken they are!”

Alas, how mistaken! Next are those who engage in acrobatic leaps and dodges, stealing openly before one’s eyes—calling a deer a horse while the master remains unaware, substituting a sheep for an ox without others noticing. Still worse are the blindly burning and reckless refining, squandering fire and wasting wealth, idling away days and months in vain expectation, yet never achieving success. It is not the Way that misleads people, but people who fail to examine the Way.

Alas! Without discerning the depth of the Dao, they claim to love it; without recognizing the authenticity of a teacher, they claim to have met one. Thus, madmen and charlatans boldly take the lead, while earnest seekers prostrate themselves in reverence—what greater shame could there be? For this reason, I have written this discourse. To all my fellow aspirants who cherish the Dao: take heed, take heed! Cease your deluded pursuits early, seek the true essence early—for my whip is not to be had.

**On Shattering Attachments**

Consider the nature of things: fruits and melons, or foods and wines sealed in jars—once their forms are broken or their coverings opened, all decay and cannot endure. The human body, once broken, is no different. The sages, understanding this, sought what is called the *precelestial true unity* to restore it.

Yet those who now discourse on the precelestial merely attempt to seal and secure their already broken bodies, to gather and harmonize their fragmented selves, hoping to generate the *true unity* and thereby attain the Way of longevity and enduring vision. They do not realize that once the true form is broken, the essence, qi, and spirit within the body all transform day by day, month by month, descending into the postcelestial. How can the qi of *true unity* remain whole? It is like storing spoiled fruits or wine whose seal has been opened, yet expecting them not to decay—how could this not be difficult?

This principle is perfectly clear, easily understood by all. Whether drawing from the body near at hand or things far away, few analogies are needed to make it plain.

The Way of Returning the Elixir is recorded in the alchemical classics, yet scholars fail to read them thoroughly and ponder their meaning deeply. Instead, they grasp at a word or half a phrase, passing it from mouth to ear, and claim it as true transmission and genuine attainment. To the end of their lives, they cling to delusion, practicing with a single substance without ever awakening—how pitiful this is! Moved by compassion for such disciples, I have written this discourse.

The ancient immortals said: *"Form is preserved through the Dao, life is prolonged through technique."* Nowadays, those who discourse on the Dao are many, but where are the techniques? Let them reflect on this.

**Refuting Heresies**
Those who expound on similar doctrines today offer divergent theories, all of which I shall address. The "Nine-One" method is nothing but heresy and need not be discussed. Then there are the theories of the "precelestial plum," which resemble mere echoes and shadows, or mimic form without substance. Some may sound plausible, yet they all involve tangible dregs and material substances—no different in essence from the worldly "red lead," only varying in name. To regard these as the Dao is, I fear, mistaken.

As for the doctrines of "detached-form qi exchange," "dual apertures of the navel and field," "opening the passes and forging the sword," "ascending and descending progressions," or those that invert the classics to speak of "coiled peaches," "holding jujubes to drink sweet dew," "crushing porcelain and smelting iron into wine," "collecting the impure fluids of men and women to brew with yeast," or "blending autumn stone and calling it the primordial human element"—such practices are manifold. They are all the teachings of heretical masters and crooked scholars, the blind leading the blind. Though they toil from youth to hoary age, they never achieve success, only ruining their virtue, harming their bodies, and becoming objects of ridicule in the world—how lamentable!

Moreover, the qi of the precelestial arises from emptiness and nothingness. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped. Those who grope and probe, seeking it through myriad methods, only distance themselves further from it. What then of the "floating and sinking grains and ounces"? Where are they now?

From what I have heard, truth and falsehood are as distinct as fragrant herbs and foul weeds—they cannot be stored in the same vessel. Laozi said: *"Only because of their ignorance do they fail to know me."* If there were those in the world who truly understood these words, my Dao would not be solitary.

**Refuting Doubts**
Some may object: *"The ancients said, ‘A word or half a phrase can penetrate the mysteries—what need is there for the myriad volumes of alchemical classics?’ These words suggest that verbose explanations are of little value. Yet you urge people to read the classics extensively, to thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, and deeply fathom the workings of creation. Is this not a waste of time, using knowledge and perception to obstruct the mind? If I grasp the teacher’s essential instruction, a single phrase can guide me in—why read so much?"*

I reply: *"Your words sound reasonable, but you do not know that the Dao has orthodoxy and heterodoxy, and teachers have truth and falsehood. You lack the Dharma-eye—how then will you discern them?"* To test gold, one must use a touchstone. The alchemical classics are the touchstone of contemporary masters. Without diligent study and deep reflection, merely relying on a word or half a phrase from a teacher to seek the Dao—how few will avoid falling into heretical sects and being misled by strange doctrines!

There was once a man who wished to travel to the capital. He asked for directions along the way, but each person gave different answers. Fearful, he dared not proceed. One day, in the marketplace, he found a road atlas. Clutching it, he set off, and every detail—where to lodge, where to trade, the order of passes and inns—matched perfectly. Only then did he realize the difference between written records and oral transmission—how vast, like heaven and earth!

The alchemical classics are the road atlas for entering the Dao. Today, people discard the classics and seek mere phrases from contemporary masters. Is this not like abandoning the atlas and asking passersby for directions, hoping to reach the capital without error?

Moreover, a word or half a phrase as a secret transmission depends on a true teacher. Where do you intend to find such a teacher?

**Refuting Ignorance**

Those who pursue the Dao today mostly invite alchemists to set up furnaces and fires, hoping for transmutation and elixirs to ingest—this they call "external alchemy." Yet they do not realize that such pursuits arise from deluded intentions. Once delusion takes root, deluded companions gather. Thus, cunning impostors seize every gap and flaw, swapping horses for oxen, robbing you face-to-face, yet you remain oblivious. Even if you tried to enumerate their deceits, you could not exhaust them. In my early days, before receiving a true teacher’s guidance, I nearly fell prey to such men. By heaven’s grace, I avoided ruin, and so I write this treatise to leave for later generations.

As for furnace and fire, do not claim they do not exist—they serve as verification for the golden elixir. The *Cantong Qi* states: "The work of furnace and fire has true basis. Only when one thoroughly understands yin and yang, deeply penetrates the workings of creation, can the marvelous application be seen." For furnace-fire refines qi just as it refines the self. The methods of matching, gathering, warming, and birthing the embryo are all the same. The key lies in recognizing ascent and descent, knowing maturity and tenderness—then the Dao of the elixir may nearly be grasped.

Yet those who discuss furnace-fire today know not what lead and mercury truly are, where their weights lie, or where true earth resides. They recklessly combine common cinnabar and mercury, mix in the eight minerals, boil them with various herbs. Some take lead bloom as "water gold," others extract cinnabar’s spirit as "yellow sulfur," still others strip cinnabar’s husk to make "heavenly sulfur," or take *tiangui* to embrace mercury. Some mine tin or ore, toy with the sun’s movements, and call it true lead, true mercury, true earth—claiming the world rarely knows such secrets. A thousand threads, ten thousand strands, all no more than this method. Each follows their own mind, hoards their "treasure," and cunningly sells it, while the world remains unaware. Those who heed them suffer ruinous losses beyond words.

Moreover, the Dao of the golden elixir is treasured by heaven itself. To seek it, one must have external protection and both method and resources in harmony—this is acceptable. But to peddle it to others for gifts and gratitude—what justification is there? To trust a man without detecting his deceit, to employ his methods without examining their principles—is this not folly? To repeat the same mistakes after prior missteps—is this not folly? To neglect cultivating virtue while chasing undeserved fortune—is this not folly?

Such men exhaust their wealth, leaving wives and children destitute. Even if their schemes fail, they still hope for success. Alas! Those who fall into the immortal elders’ predictions number nine out of ten. How perilous!

The Way of external elixirs depends on man for its practice, but on heaven for its completion; wisdom for its understanding, and fortune for its coagulation. The secrets lie with the master, clarity with the eye—there is not a hair’s breadth or a moment’s leeway to borrow from another. If one can cultivate virtue in seclusion, bind hearts in silent accord, so that virtue moves heaven and earth and sincerity stirs ghosts and spirits, then when approaching the furnace, one may be assured of no mishaps. Otherwise, even with correct methods and keen insight, how can one withstand demonic trials?

I have personally tested and verified this, and now dare not conceal it. I fear that those who act recklessly out of ignorance will meet with failure and grow disheartened. It is not that the Way betrays man, but that man does not understand the Way. Yet if one can know it without acting, act without employing it, or employ it without selfishness—how much better still!

**Breaking the Spell of Delusion**
The Way of the golden elixir prizes true understanding and early cultivation. Thus, the Pure Yang Master said: *"To begin swift practice is already too late."* Yet worldly people, clinging to the saying that *"one hundred and twenty years may still be reclaimed,"* in their prime and wealth remain mired in the river of love, entangled in the dusty net of the world, failing to break free. Day and night, they squander nearly all. Only when the sun sets on their path, when all is spent, do they turn to the Way as a last resort. Unaware that time waits for no one, that the hexagram’s count is fulfilled, that medicinal ingredients dwindle, and the foundation of support is gone—even if they meet a master who knows the medicine, the moment of opportunity has already slipped by. With white hair, they achieve nothing, and all that remains is a sigh of emptiness. How pitiable!

Thus, Master Purple Yang’s *Awakening to Reality* opens by likening time to a spark struck from stone and life to a floating bubble—his warning is both profound and urgent. Some ask about the *"one hundred and twenty years"* in the *Yellow Court*. I say: *"In the ancient world, people were simple and affairs few; marriages came late."*

"Consider fertile fields whose strength is not yet exhausted—even late planting still yields a harvest. But now the soil is barren and depleted, and cultivation comes too late, so the sprouts fail to flower, and the flowers bear no fruit. No wonder this is so. Moreover, people of ancient and modern times cannot be compared, for the prevailing *qi* of the age makes it so. How then can one judge the people of antiquity by the standards of today?"
