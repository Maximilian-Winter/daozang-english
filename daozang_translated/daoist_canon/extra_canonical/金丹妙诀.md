**"The Alchemical Secret of *Jindan*: *Shoushi Fan ting* (Gathering Vision, Returning Hearing)**

The Master of Ji Yang said:

*"Shoushi* means drawing the eye’s light inward from the external world into the *Xuan Guan* (Mysterious Pass), where it settles and stills, transforming into sweet dew. Swallow it down into the *Dantian* (Elixir Field), then guide it with intent into the *Qi Xue* (Qi Cavity). When the eye’s light gazes downward upon the *Qi Xue*, the spirit manifests in stillness—this is the *Kuanzi* (Self-Sovereign) Bodhisattva.

What is called *returning observation* is the inward contemplation of the ever-still true heart, the dual cultivation of essence and spirit to escape the wheel of suffering.

The scripture says: *'First, master the two eyes.'* The eyes are the repository of the spirit; one must observe inwardly, never gaze outward. I say: Do not observe near, do not observe far—constantly observe the void of non-doing, this aperture being the *Xuan Guan* (Mysterious Aperture).

The Dao Ancestor taught: *'Observe with constant desire to perceive its aperture; observe without desire to grasp its mystery.'* The mystery is the marvel within the aperture—when one perceives the aperture’s marvel, it is called *defining insight*.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained the *Cai Feng Book*, which stated:
*'If swallowing does not cease, the body grows heavy;
If thought does not cease, the spirit grows clouded;
If sounds and colors do not cease, the heart grows restless.
A restless heart dulls the spirit;
A dulled spirit fails to attain the Dao.'*
Its essence lies not in gazing at stars or bowing to constellations, nor in exhausting the body—
but in the stillness of the mind’s inch, free from all striving.
Thus, the Dao of immortality is attained.

It is said: *For every measure of emptiness in the heart, a measure of true nature is revealed; for every ten measures of emptiness, ten measures of true nature appear.* When this clarity suddenly penetrates, it is called *enlightening the heart and seeing true nature.*

Therefore, when the original spirit strays outward, swiftly return the light, drawing it back into the *Qiangzi* (Vital Chamber). Even a moment’s practice brings natural stillness to body and mind, dispersing all malevolent influences—then the radiant sun shines clear.

When thought arises, the spirit departs; when thought ceases, the spirit returns.
Thus, the Zen school values *stillness of thought*, the Confucian school values *self-mastery*, and the Daoist path values *self-refinement*.

*Fanti* (Returning Hearing) refers to returning to the marvel of the *Dantian*.
If one’s ears unconsciously follow sounds, swiftly gather the resonance, drawing it back into the *Qi Xue*, returning to the marvel of the *Dantian*.
Naturally, the Zen mechanism falls silent, and profound stillness prevails.
With time and practice, it becomes immovably serene, effortlessly harmonized and great.

Thus it is said:
*'Though the eyes see colors, I return the light and do not receive them within;
Though the ears hear sounds, I return the resonance and do not take them in;
Though the spirit responds to things, I remain still and do not let thoughts arise;
When the original yang stirs and perceives things, I awaken inwardly and do not stray—
Swiftly refine with wind and fire.'*

In moments of no-thought, when the *jing* (essence) leaks—whether through seminal emission, the male’s *waiguan* (external gate) rising, or the female’s monthly flow—this is the *Guanyuan* (Pass Gate) stirring, called *living in time*.
Seeing this without falling into delusion, one steadies the will and *qi*, gathering the subtle original spirit into the moving *qi*.
Mindful at every breath, returning to the root without pause, like silk threads unbroken.
When essence and blood transform into *qi*, guide this *qi* back into the *Qi Xue*, sealing the heart.
Purge the turbid *qi* from the *Yongquan* (Gushing Spring), then guard the original spirit at the *Qi Xue*, gently inhaling and exhaling—
the *qi* will naturally spiral upward, passing the Three Passes, ascending to the *Nihuan* (Eye Cavity), entering the *Xuanqiao* (Mysterious Bridge).
With *Xuanqiao* breathing, the *Dharma Wheel* turns.
Stillness and clarity transform into sweet dew, descending into the *Dantian Qi Xue*, returning to the root and reclaiming life.
Even a moment’s practice blends spirit and *qi* unconsciously—
body and spirit both refined, mind and body joyful.
This is the wondrous method of cultivating immortality.

The human spirit resides in the heart; the heart’s mechanism is in the eyes.
If the eyes gaze ten *li* away, the heart-spirit follows ten *li* distant.
When the eyes do not stray far, returning inward, the heart-spirit follows within.
Not only is it within—it is also still.
When the heart is greatly still, the kidney waters rise to the *Nihuan*, and the heart fire descends to the *Dantian*.
Drinking the sweet essence, the whole body feels joy.
Thus it is said:
*'At every moment, returning the light and inward reflection is easy to learn;
A heart without delusion is the Dao itself.'*

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained the *Shenzhi Diagram* and sought instruction from the *Taiyi Huangren* (Great Unity Sovereign).
He said: *'This is the Dao of the Three-One.'*
If one constantly guards the Three-One, true immortality is achieved.
What are the Three?
*Jing* (essence), *qi* (vital breath), *shen* (spirit).

Before Heaven, they were one; after Heaven, they became three.
The eyes do not gaze but gather the spirit;
the ears do not listen but preserve the essence;
the mouth does not speak but nurtures the *qi*.
When the three apertures—eyes, ears, mouth—are tightly sealed,
the methods of *preserving essence, nourishing qi, and storing spirit* are attained.

It is said: *'The outer Three Treasures do not leak; the inner Three Treasures do not dissipate.'*
Refining the three to return to one is called *Three Flowers Converging at the Crown*.
The Crown refers to the *Xuan Guan* aperture—
the root of Heaven and Earth, the source of the Three Realms,
the *Dharma Storehouse Eye*, the *Total-Holding Gate*,
the ladder to Heaven, the path to the Southern Pole,
called the *Mysterious Female*, the *Wuji* (Five-Six),
the *Knife and Chisel*, the *True One*—
none other than the convergence of metal and wood,
the meeting place of the infant and the maiden.

The scripture says: *'Only the pure and singular, steadfastly holding the center.'*

The Sage Confucius said: *'My Dao is one, threading through all things.'*

「’ *"Damo said: 'Once attained, all matters are complete.'*
Ah! Though names and forms vary greatly,
they all point to the singular *Xuan Guan* aperture!

The ancient sages declared:
*'This aperture is no ordinary orifice—
Heaven and Earth coalesce therein.
Called the *Shen Qi* Hole,
within it lies the *Kan Li* Essence.*

To grasp this aperture,
one must not rely on mere cleverness—
only the true teacher knows its way.

Thus it is said:
*'Though your wisdom surpasses Yan Min’s,
without the true teacher’s guidance, no amount of guessing will suffice.
For without the *Golden Elixir*’s oral formula,
where would you anchor the sacred embryo?’*

If a person attains this aperture,
ever keep the ears, eyes, and mouth
drawn inward—this is *Three Flowers Converging at the Crown*.

Then, refine the breath softly and continuously,
this is called *Four Phases Returning to Wuji* (Five-Six).
*Wu* (Steward) soil resides in the *Dantian*,
*Ji* (Earth) soil is entrusted to the *Xuan Guan*.
To master *Ji*,
naturally restore *Wu*—
that is, to condense the spirit into the *Dantian*,
while the true *qi* returns to the *Xuan Guan*.
This is what is meant by *Taking Kan to Fill Li*,
this is it. ’
**Condense the spirit into the *qi*.**」

The **Jìyáng Zǐ** said:

*"The human spirit, by day, scatters and strays without foundation,
by night, dreams in myriad forms.
If one does not condense and return it to stillness,
how then can the form and spirit both attain perfection?

The method lies in the instant return of light to its source,
condensing the original spirit back into the *Zǔqiào* (Ancestral Aperture) and *Xuán Guān* (Mysterious Pass).
Hold it in stillness and refine it into *Gānlù* (Sweet Dew) to swallow inward,
then send it downward to the *Qíxué* (Qi Cavern) at the *Qìlún* (Navel Wheel).
This cavern lies just before the navel, slightly behind it,
where a void circle exists—this is called the *Tàijí* (Great Polarity).
Here, the vital essence that sustains life is knotted and formed.
My mind rests here, and I observe within.
I then gather all the spirit previously condensed
and return it fully to this cavern,
like a cat seizing a mouse or a dragon nurturing a pearl.
The true *qi* naturally flows inward,
generating warmth and the rise of *Yáng* (Yang).

Since the moment we severed the umbilical cord,
the true *qi* within this cavern cannot communicate with the *Xuán Guān*.
Without the union of water and fire,
the *Rèn Dū* (Conception and Governing Vessels) are blocked—
this is the seed of death.
But once the formula is obtained,
condense the spirit and focus on the *Xuán Guān*,
holding still for long durations.
Then, the breath of life,
from the *Gānlù*, penetrates deeply into the *Qi Cavern*,
with every breath returning to the root,
soft and continuous as if preserved.
At times of stillness,
the original *qi* of the cavern ascends backward to the *Xuán Guān*,
refines into *Gānlù*, and descends again into the cavern—
parent and child reunite, like a broken mirror restored.
One ascent, one descent—water and fire now harmonized.
Gradually, it condenses and solidifies,
strengthening the foundation of the elixir.

The *Guīzhǐ* (Jade Instructions) says:
*'Nurture the original source,
protect the vital essence.'*

The **Yùchán Zǔshī** (Jade Hare Patriarch) says:
*'Once you grasp the master’s oral formula,
simply condense the spirit into the *Qi Cavern*.'*

The **Xìnglín Shī** (Apricot Grove Master) says:
*'All things have death,
yet the original spirit dies and is reborn.
By entering the spirit into the *Qi Cavern*,
the elixir’s Dao naturally manifests.'*

**Refine the breath softly and continuously:**
The **Jìyáng Zǐ** says:
As previously written, the spirit condensed and the *qi* gathered,
the vital root now full, the elixir’s foundation firm.
Yet without refining the true breath,
there is fear that the fire will grow cold and the elixir slow,
and the sacred medicine will not sprout.

The method of refining the breath is hard to speak of,
but when one attains the great equilibrium of stillness,
the true breath is naturally refined.
The ancient immortals said:
*'Refining the breath must refine the true breath,
cultivating the spirit must cultivate the non-spirit spirit.*
This true breath and that non-spirit spirit—
these two are the true *Lónghǔ* (Dragon and Tiger),
true *Yīnyáng* (Yin and Yang),
true *Shuǐhuǒ* (Water and Fire),
true *Fūfù* (Husband and Wife),
true *Tāixī* (Parental and Child Essences),
true *Xuán Pìn* (Mysterious Female),
true *Tǔoqiào* (Diaphragmatic Key).

Ah!
With the *Xuán Pìn*’s inhalation and exhalation,
and the *Tǔoqiào*’s closing and opening,
they come and go in mutual exchange.
The natural fire’s potency—
why should it rely on chaotic actions through mouth and nose?

Yet there are methods that combine both.
Thus, the ancient sages said:
*'Refine the breath by following the breath,
know the mind without using the mind.
Stable and unmoving, it produces true gold in an instant.'*

Wonderful!
Gold indeed!"

「"The *Biánmián* (Continuous Refinement) practice is to maintain uninterrupted awareness of the true breath at every moment throughout the twelve times [of the day].

"The true breath of humanity is like the sun and moon of heaven. Heaven’s sun and moon revolve without ceasing, day and night, coming and going endlessly; the true breath of humanity rises behind and descends before—how could it ever stop? And yet, how could it ever be interrupted? One must guide it from the *Xuán Guān* (Mysterious Pass) above to the *Qì Xué* (Qi Cavern) below, stabilize the *Qì Xué*, and let each breath return to its root, continuous and unbroken. Through repeated cultivation and refinement, it naturally ascends and descends without pause.

*Zhōnglí Zǔ* said: *"If one can attend to each breath in turn,
the mortal form will be transformed—pure and flowing like jade essence."*

But if one practices for a time and then rests,
or practices for a day and then rests a day,
how could this ever be the Dao of *Jīndān* (Alchemical Elixir)?

*Confucius* said: *"The Dao is something one cannot for a moment depart from."*
Is this not worth pondering?

**The Unity of Heart and Breath** — *Jìyáng Zǐ* said:
*"The heart is not a clump of flesh or the daily mind,
but the original nature, the true *Rú* (Thusness) of the heavenly heart.
The Confucianists say: 'When human desires are purified away,
the *Tīanlǐ* (Heavenly Principle) flows freely.'
This is how one can perceive the heavenly heart.
The *Journey to the West* is entirely due to *Wùkōng* (Awakened to Emptiness).
Wùkōng’s original nature perceives *Rú* (Thusness),
thus it is called 'seeing the *Rúlái* (Thusness-Comer).'
It departs and arrives according to principle.
To empty the mundane heart is to see the heavenly heart.
To see the heavenly heart is to see the Thusness-Comer.
To see the Thusness-Comer, one must grasp the moment."

*Shào Fūzǐ* said:
*"When the moon reaches the heavenly heart,
and the wind stirs the surface of the waters—*
that is the time.
The *Heart Sutra* states:
*'At this moment, it is the time of the heavenly heart,
the time of *Yángqì* (Yang Qi) arising,
the time of the *Yīyuán* (One Source) beginning anew.
When the time arrives, the spirit knows—
the heavenly heart is present,
and the Thusness-Comer is seen.
The *Dāntián* (Elixir Field) grows warm and hot,
and all things meet with spring.
Wonderful!
Wonderful!"*

"Now, the **breath** spoken of is not the gross breath taken through the mouth and nose, but the **true breath** within the **Qi Cavern**.

To perceive this breath, one must eliminate stray thoughts, attain utmost emptiness, and steadfastly guard stillness. When the mind is empty, the nature reveals itself, and the mouth and nose cease their breath. Yet the mundane breath halts while the true breath moves. In a state of **dim, boundless obscurity**, the **Qi Cavern** manifests a single aperture—**mysterious and indistinct**, called the **Aperture within the Aperture**, which is exactly the moment when, as mentioned earlier, the spirit knows.

Humans attain this utmost stillness during the night, when sleep is just awakened, and the mind is at its purest quiet. The **Elixir** is born, and the spirit knows. Those who do not recognize it pass it by in plain sight. One must concentrate the spirit into the **Qi Cavern**, returning each breath to its root. Whether forgotten or remembered, **fervently boil and refine** with utmost intensity. **Refine essence into qi**, and reverse it, returning it to the **Qi Cavern**. When the **Yang Qi** grows warm and hot, let it circulate and govern the **Lesser Heaven**—

The mind and breath are interdependent; the spirit’s illumination must never be separated, for separation leads to **dryness and imbalance**.

The ancients said:
*'When the spirit moves, the qi moves;
when the spirit dwells, the qi dwells.'*
Interdependent and inseparable, one must remain sincere and resolute. **Harvest and refine**, inhaling and exhaling. In **dynamic stillness**, advance and retreat as needed—**harmonizing and tranquil**, the **Great Stillness** manifests boundless natural wonders.

From the **Golden Elixir’s** beginning to its end, it must never stray from this method to succeed. Truly vast!

This is the profound essence of **heart-breath harmony**.

Now, in **walking, standing, sitting, or lying**, one must regulate the breath through the mouth and nose. If unregulated, one cannot perceive the **true breath**. The method lies in concentrating the spirit into the **Qi Cavern**, guarding the mind at the **Qi Cavern**, and letting the intention follow the **breath’s ascent and descent**. Inhaling, connect with the **Heavenly Root** at the **Mysterious Pass**; exhaling, connect with the **Earthly Root** at the **Qi Cavern**. This is called **internal communion with true qi**, preserving the breath—**naturally transforming and restoring the childlike countenance**.

As **Chen Zhichu** said:
*'A single great path few seek,
where the **Wind Tiger** and **Cloud Dragon** freely roam.
When seated, know the breath’s motion is key—
the **True Person’s** breath is deep and profound.'*

The *Guizhi* states:
*'Not the **Mysterious Gate’s** subtle teachings,
but the high mountain’s flowing waters lack true resonance.
If one can trace the path of its coming,
the **Red Boy** remains in **primordial chaos** of the heart.'*
If asked about the **path of its coming**, it is the single aperture of the **Qi Cavern**. Concentrate and condense it into **Elixir**; transcend the **Mysterious Pass**; **nurture and refine** it with reverence, and ascending through the **Heaven Gate** is achieved.

**Red-Belly Child** said:
*'Between the **Qi Cavern**—
ancients named it the **Gate of Life** and **Door of Death**,
also the **roots of Heaven and Earth**.
Concentrating the spirit here,
the **Primordial Qi** daily grows full,
the **Primordial Spirit** daily flourishes.
When the spirit flourishes, the qi flows freely;
when the qi flows freely, the blood harmonizes;
when the blood harmonizes, the bones strengthen;
when the bones strengthen, the marrow fills;
when the marrow fills, the abdomen swells;
when the abdomen swells, the **lower dantian** solidifies—
then, walking is light and effortless,
movement knows no fatigue,
the four limbs are healthy,
the complexion glows like peach blossoms,
and **immortality is not far away.**'*
