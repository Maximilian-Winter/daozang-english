*The Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*
*A Preface to the Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*

The Dao of cultivating reality is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling one’s nature, and attaining destiny. Thus, to fulfill one’s nature, one must first exhaust the principle of that nature; to attain one’s destiny, one must first exhaust the principle of that destiny. Only by clarifying its principle can one gain true knowledge and firm insight, avoiding delusion by the false, thereby fulfilling one’s nature and attaining one’s destiny. Otherwise, without exhausting its principle, right and wrong remain indistinguishable, the deviant and the upright unseparated. One enters side paths and crooked trails, clinging to emptiness or fixating on forms—this is not the cultivation of reality but the pursuit of the false. Such pursuit of the false distances one daily from the Dao, merely misleading one’s nature and destiny. How then can one cultivate and preserve them?

This is why the Immortal Elder Ziyang composed the *Awakening to Reality*. Its verses delve into the profound and subtle, drawing from afar and near, comparing and illustrating in myriad ways. Its original intent was for all to awaken to reality and each to cultivate the Dao. Yet alas, later generations of deluded fools, failing to receive the true transmission, cling to forms and adhere to words, making wild guesses and private conjectures. Some regard it as inner alchemy, others as external refinement; some suspect it of emptiness and stillness, others fall into fixation on forms—greatly betraying the compassionate intent of the Immortal Elder to deliver the world.

Among the annotations of earlier awakened ones, there are indeed fine interpretations. Fine though they may be, they remain explanations of symbols by symbols, comparisons by comparisons, concealing the head while revealing the tail, hiding the mother while speaking of the child. They dare not plainly reveal the truth, leaving learners bewildered and unable to awaken. These are not *awakenings* to *Awakening to Reality* but mere *retellings* of it.

Alas! The more annotations there are, the more obscure the principle becomes; the more books proliferate, the more people are confused. The true Dao declines daily, while deviant paths flourish; genuine learning is buried, while false teachings arise—strange and ever stranger. No wonder Confucians regard Daoism as heterodoxy!

I myself, having inhaled the fragrant breeze from the incense burner of the hermitage, recognize this book as the treasury of the principles of Dao cultivation and the celestial ladder to attaining reality. Its roots in nature and destiny, its fire phases and sequences—none are lacking. Yet for too long, it has been obscured by deviant interpretations, like the sun veiled by dark clouds, its radiance unmanifest.

As a humble student fortunate enough to draw near the gate, I cannot bear to withhold this true treasure from fellow seekers. Thus, I name this work *The Direct Pointer to the Awakening to Reality*. I do not presume to claim I have grasped the truth but merely offer it to rescue the true.

Written on the full moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Great Qing, the cyclical year *jiwei*, by the Plain-and-Simple Man of Dwelling Cloud Mountain, Awakened Primordial One, Liu Yiming, in his *Abode of Ease*.

*Original Preface to the Awakening to Reality*
Alas!

The human body is hard to obtain, yet the passage of time is swift; who can fathom its span or escape karmic retribution? If one does not awaken early to this truth but merely resigns to awaiting the end, a single misguided thought at the crossroads may plunge one into the three evil destinies—then, drifting through kalpas of dust, there shall be no end to suffering. At such a time, though one may repent, what use is it?

Thus, the elders of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means through the study of *xing* and *ming*, teaching people to cultivate and refine themselves to escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration, one transcends directly to the other shore. Yet if habitual defilements remain unexhausted, one still clings to existence. Daoism regards refinement and nurturance as the truth; if one grasps its pivotal essence, one ascends immediately to sagehood. But if one fails to illuminate the original nature, one remains bound to the illusory form.

Next, the *Book of Changes* contains words on exhausting principle, fulfilling *xing*, and attaining *ming*; the *Analects* speaks of "no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no self-absorption"—this, too, is Confucius’ profound attainment of the mysteries of *xing* and *ming*. Yet why are his words often brief and not expounded in detail? It is because he sought to order human relations and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music—all active virtues. Thus, he did not explicitly speak of the Dao of non-action, but concealed the arts of *ming* within the images of the *Changes* and blended the methods of *xing* into subtle words.

As for *Zhuangzi*, who explored the nature of freedom from worldly entanglements, and *Mencius*, who excelled in nurturing the vast *qi*, both approached the subtleties. Later, Wei Boyang of the Han dynasty drew upon the *Changes*’ principle of the union of yin and yang to compose the *Cantong Qi*, elucidating the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, Master Zhong of Loyalty prefaced his recorded sayings with the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the origin and end of the supreme Dao. Is this not proof that though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one?

Alas! In later generations, the followers of the Yellow and the Black robes each clung to their own traditions, mutually rejecting one another, causing the essential purport of the three teachings to be lost amid deviant paths, unable to merge and return to unity.

Moreover, people today believe that the Daoist gate emphasizes the cultivation of *ming*, yet they do not understand that the methods of cultivating *ming* branch into two paths: one easy to encounter but difficult to accomplish, the other difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. Practices such as refining the *qi* of the five sprouts, ingesting the light of the seven luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and commanding talismans, clicking teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, preserving spirit and holding breath, directing thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain and returning essence, and practicing the arts of the bedchamber—along with ingesting and refining metals, minerals, herbs, and trees—all belong to the category of the easily encountered yet difficult to accomplish.

If one diligently applies effort to the above methods, though they may fragmentarily benefit the cultivation of the body, the results remain unverifiable despite great exertion. At best, they may help avoid illness and avert misfortune. Yet once discontinued, the previous efforts gradually dissipate. Such practices merely prolong the years without ensuring success. How, then, can one hope for a single attainment to become permanent, to return to infancy and reverse aging, to transform and ascend in flight? Is this not exceedingly difficult? Truly, it is a cause for deep sorrow!

Most modern practitioners cling blindly to misconceptions, failing to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, and instead blame the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that all who attain the Dao do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir. Fearing the leakage of heavenly secrets, they instead attribute their success to various other practices. Among these, only the method of holding the breath—if one can forget scheming and still the mind—resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. If practiced diligently, it may lead to entering samadhi and projecting spirit. Yet since spirit belongs to yin and the bodily abode is hard to stabilize, one must constantly employ methods of transference. Without mastering the Dao of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse the bones and exchange yang, ascending to heaven in broad daylight?

The refinement of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, however, is difficult to encounter yet easy to accomplish. One must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, then pursue the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, unite the three *xing* in the Primordial Palace, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the jade crucible boils, and the golden furnace blazes—only then can the Mysterious Pearl take form and the Great One return to truth. All this occurs in but a moment’s effort, yet secures boundless ease and joy forever.

As for guarding against danger and contemplating peril, one must be cautious in the operations of withdrawal and addition; in nurturing correctness and maintaining fullness, one must hold to the feminine and embrace the One. Naturally, the *qi* of returning yang will arise, and the form of slaying yin will be shed. Once the nodal *qi* is complete, one sheds the womb and transforms spirit, is inscribed in the registers of immortals, and titled as a Perfected One—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.

Yet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*, point to the viscera as the five phases, divide heart and kidney into *kan* and *li*, regard liver and lung as dragon and tiger, use spirit and *qi* as mother and child, and cling to fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of sinking and floating, unable to distinguish host and guest, how is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a child of another surname one’s own? How can they know the subtleties of metal and wood overcoming one another or the mysteries of yin and yang’s mutual employment? All this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how can one expect to congeal the Returning Elixir? Is this not exceedingly difficult?

From youth, I have been fond of the Dao, delving into the scriptures of the Three Teachings, and extending my studies to law, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and fate—nothing has escaped my careful inquiry. Yet regarding the method of the Golden Elixir, though I have perused all the classics and the songs, poems, treatises, and concordances of various schools, all speak of the sun’s essence and moon’s marrow, the metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, white metal and black tin, the *li* male and *kan* female, capable of forming the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir. Yet none reveal what true lead and true mercury truly are, nor expound on the methods of fire phases, the standards of cultivation, or the aims of nurturance.

Moreover, later generations of deluded followers, indulging their whims, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancient sages, introducing myriad errors. Not only do they disorder the immortal classics, but they also mislead and confuse later learners.

I, having yet to meet a perfected one and seldom encountered oral instructions, grew restless in sleep and meals, my spirit withered and waned. Though I sought far and wide across land and sea, consulting the wise and foolish alike, none could fathom the true essence or illuminate the depths of my heart.

Later, in the year *Jiyou* of the *Xining* era, I followed Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu. Unwavering in my long-held resolve and ever more reverent in my sincerity, I at last moved a true person to impart the secrets of the Golden Elixir—its ingredients, medicines, and fire phases. His words were spare, his essentials uncluttered, such that pointing to the stream revealed the source, one phrase awakened a hundred insights, mist dispersed to reveal the sun’s brilliance, dust settled to mirror perfect clarity. Compared with the immortal classics, they matched as tally and seal.

I reflected that of those who study immortality, eight or nine in ten pursue it, yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essentials. Having encountered this authentic transmission, how could I dare conceal it in silence? I poured forth all I had received, composing eighty-one regulated verses titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them: sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains to represent the number of two eights; sixty-four jueju verses aligned with the hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*; one pentasyllabic poem to symbolize the singularity of the Great One; and twelve additional *Xijiangyue* lyrics to correspond to the twelve months of the year. Within these are fully set forth the hierarchy of vessels, the weights of medicines, the advance and retreat of fire phases, the precedence of host and guest, the presence and absence of life and death, and the auspices of fortune, regret, and remorse.

Yet after completing the collection, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and solidifying form, leaving the original awakening of true nature unexplored. Thus, I delved into Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that ancestral masters had attained enlightenment upon hearing the strike of bamboo. This moved me to compose thirty-two additional pieces—songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses—which I now append to the end of the volume. May this suffice to convey the Way of realizing the root and illuminating nature.

My hope is that like-minded readers, upon perusing these, may perceive the branch and awaken to the root, abandoning delusion to follow truth.

Written on New Year’s Day of the *Yimao* year of the *Xining* era of the Great Song, by Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, of Tiantai.

**Postscript to *Awakening to Reality***

I observe that human birth arises from deluded passions, which give rise to this body. With this body comes suffering; without it, whence would suffering arise? To escape suffering, nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao; to embody the supreme Dao, nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind. Thus, the mind is the substance of the Dao, and the Dao is the function of the mind. If one can examine the mind and observe nature, the luminous and perfect substance will manifest of itself, and the effortless function will spontaneously arise. Without need for contrived effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore. How could this occur unless the mind-mirror shines resplendently and the spirit-pearl radiates clarity, such that all phenomena instantly dissolve, not a speck of dust adheres, the mind-source remains free, and birth-and-death is decisively overcome?

Yet for those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao, the body cannot burden their nature, nor can circumstances disturb their truth. How then could blades and weapons harm them, tigers and rhinoceroses endanger them, or great fires and floods cause them concern? The enlightened one’s mind, like a mirror, reflects without grasping; responding to circumstances, they harmonize without leading. Thus, they master things without being harmed—this is the wondrous Dao of the supreme and perfect truth.

Originally, the Dao had no name; the sages forcibly named it. The Dao had no words; the sages forcibly spoke of it. Yet if names and words were silenced, later generations would have no means to recognize its substance and return to its truth. Therefore, the sages established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao. Thus, the Dao is made manifest through words, while words, through the Dao, return to oblivion.

Alas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle, yet the world’s people, dull in root-nature, cling to their bodies, loathing death and delighting in life, and thus rarely attain awakening. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments, employed the arts of cultivating life, following their desires to guide them gradually. Since the essence of cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir, and the essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond, the teachings of the *Daodejing* and *Yinfu Jing* flourished in the world—because people delight in life.

Yet their words are veiled and their principles profound. Though scholars recite their texts, none comprehend their meaning. Without encountering a perfected one to transmit oral instructions, even if one were to speculate a hundred ways, one could never achieve its work or accomplish its task. Is this not why seekers are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain are as rare as unicorn horns?

In the *Jiyou* year, I met my teacher in Chengdu and received the method of the Elixir. Thereafter, I transmitted it thrice to unworthy recipients and thrice suffered calamities, each lasting no more than twenty days. Recently, I recalled my teacher’s admonition: *"If one day someone comes to loosen your bonds and shackles, you may transmit it to them; otherwise, you must not."* Later, wishing to dissolve my name from the registers, yet fearing that people would not believe in this Way, I composed this *Awakening to Reality*, setting forth the origins and ends of the Elixir method.

Once published, seekers flocked to me in droves. Seeing their earnestness, I could not bear to refuse, and so I selected some to instruct. Yet those I instructed were none of great power or strength, capable of upholding peril or rescuing the drowning—none were magnanimous, outstanding, benevolent, or enlightened. Initially, I suffered calamities twice and remained ignorant of my errors; it was only at the third that I reflected on my past transgressions.

Thus, I know the Great Elixir’s method is most simple and easy. Even the dullest and most foolish, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to sagehood. Therefore, Heaven cherishes and guards it, forbidding its reckless transmission to the unworthy. Yet I, Boduan, disregarded my teacher’s words and repeatedly divulged Heaven’s secrets. Because of this body, I have repeatedly incurred Heaven’s reproof and suffering—so swift and divine is Heaven’s admonition. How dare I not tremble with fear and reproach myself?

From this day forward, I shall seal my lips and still my tongue. Though cauldrons and blades were placed before me, though swords were laid upon my neck, I would never again dare speak of it.

Herein, *The Waking to Reality*’s verses sing in full of the Great Elixir, the subtle essences of medicinal substances, and the firing times—nothing is left unaddressed. Should an earnest seeker, one who bears the bone of immortality from past lives, peruse these lines, their wisdom and discernment will naturally awaken, allowing them to trace the text and grasp its meaning. What need have they for Boduan’s humble oral instruction? In this, it is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s presumptuous transmission.

As for the hymns at the work’s close, which discourse on the matter of seeing one’s nature—these are none other than the supreme, wondrous, awakened Dao spoken of above. Yet the Dao of non-action takes the salvation of beings as its foremost task; though its secrets be revealed, no fault can ultimately arise. Alas, ordinary beings, bound by karma of varying depth and endowed with faculties sharp or dull, even upon hearing a single note, scatter into divergent views. Thus, the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are but the One Vehicle, yet listeners, according to their capacity, comprehend it differently, naturally forming the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.

Hereafter, should a person of keen and swift faculties encounter this work, they will recognize that Boduan has received the supreme, wondrous essence of the One Vehicle from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch, and may awaken to the myriad dharmas through a single word. If, however, residual habitual tendencies remain, they will revert to middling or inferior views—this is no fault of Boduan’s.

Written on the day *wuyin* of the mid-summer month in the first year of the *Yuanfeng* reign, the year *wuwu*, by Zhang Bairui, styled Pingshu.

*Direct Pointers of Waking to Reality*, Scroll One
Sixteen heptasyllabic regulated verses to represent the number of the two eights.
The two eights make sixteen. As the moon’s first quarter holds eight ounces of metal within water, and the last quarter holds eight ounces of water within metal, the two eights combine to form one catty. When metal and water are evenly harmonized, their radiance is neither biased nor partial, perfectly centered and upright—this is the image the Elixir method draws from the two quarters. For those who cultivate the Great Dao, the yang within yin is true yang, corresponding to the first quarter; the yin within yang is true yin, corresponding to the last quarter. When yang within yin harmonizes with yin, and yin within yang harmonizes with yang, true yin and true yang unite as one—this is called the two eights making one catty, the image of the Golden Elixir’s formation. The sixteen verses represent the two eights, signifying precisely this.

**I.**

**II.**
Who seeks not the Great Dao strays lost upon the path—
though gifted with talent, how can one be called a true man?
A hundred years of light flash like sparks from flint,
a lifetime’s fate drifts like bubbles on water.
Only chasing profit and rank, craving glory and fame,
unaware the body withers, the face sallow and dry.
Try asking: though gold be piled high as Mount Tai,
can impermanence be bought off, made never to come?

This world is but a realm of sound and form, a land of fame and gain,
where suffering is called joy, falsehood taken for truth,
where essence is drained, qi exhausted, life and nature worn away—
all ends in death.
Those who awaken and transcend are the Perfected;
those who remain ignorant, trapped within, are the deluded.

Thus the immortals and realized ones of old:
from youth, they were filial and kind within the family, fulfilling human bonds;
by forty, they practiced the Way of unmoving mind, preserving life and nature.
A hundred years of borrowed time pass in an instant,
a lifetime’s glory and shame turn in the blink of an eye.
If one does not return to the root, restore the origin, revert to the mandate,
when the great limit arrives, though gold be heaped like mountains,
one departs empty-handed.

The Immortal Elder said:
*“Try asking: though gold be piled high as Mount Tai,
can impermanence be bought off, made never to come?”*
Truly, these are the golden bell and dharma drum,
awakening all beneath the sky.

**III.**
Though man’s span may reach a hundred years,
short or long, poverty or ease—none can foresee.
Yesterday he rode through the streets on horseback,
today he lies still within the coffin’s planks.
Wife and wealth, cast aside, were never truly his;
karmic deeds follow—who can deceive the self?
If the Great Elixir is not sought, how can it be met?
To know it yet not refine it is sheer folly.

The world’s people vie for fame and gain, ceaseless day and night,
deluding themselves that life has no end, that ease may last forever.
How could they know that heaven’s span, long or short,
fortune or misfortune, gain or loss—none can be foretold?
Do not assume rare are those who live a hundred years;
even if one reaches a century, in the end, none escape the wild burial ground.
Often one sees men here one moment, gone the next,
suddenly struck dead mid-stride, mid-laughter—countless such cases.
Alas!
While eyes are open, wealth and wife seem mine, clung to without cease.
When eyes close, all things vanish, nothing carried away—
only a full load of karmic transgressions, borne back alone.

How much better to see through worldly affairs early,
hurry to seek a wise teacher, and pursue the Great Elixir!
If conditions align and the Elixir is met,
this is great fortune, a profound foundation.
Pressing forward with fierce effort to refine it,
one may step from death into life, transcending impermanence.
But if, having met it, one refuses to devote the heart to refinement,
this is self-abandonment, the height of folly—
no different from those who never saw through worldly affairs,
bound to perish in the end. What value then in mere knowledge?

**IV.**
To learn immortality, learn the immortality of heaven—
only the Golden Elixir is most true and sure.
When the two things meet, nature and feeling unite;
where the five phases are complete, dragon and tiger coil.
Originally, *wu* and *ji* served as matchmakers,
thus husband and wife dwell in constant joy.
Awaiting only the work’s completion, to ascend the northern palace,
riding the simurgh amidst ninefold radiance.

The two preceding poems teach one to see through worldly affairs,
to urgently seek the Great Elixir and escape birth and death.
The Way to escape birth and death is the Way of learning immortality.
Yet immortals have many ranks:
those who complete nature and project a yin spirit are ghost immortals;
those who complete life and preserve form in the world are earth immortals;
those who complete both nature and life, whose body beyond the body is wondrous,
whose form and spirit unite with the Dao—these are heaven immortals.

Ghost immortals, though their yin spirits move freely,
dwell in unstable abodes, still subject to casting off and entering bodies.
Earth immortals, though they preserve form in the world,
find their dharma-body hard to liberate, still burdened by illusory form’s decay.
One falls into death, the other into birth—
neither has truly escaped the cycle of birth and death.
Only heaven immortals, shedding illusory form to become dharma-body,
transcend the bounds of creation, beyond birth and death,
able to escape the cycle, their lifespan equal to heaven’s, enduring forever.

Those who would escape birth and death must learn heaven immortality.
To begin learning heaven immortality, none but the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir will suffice.
*Jin* is the unyielding, indestructible substance;
*dan* is the seamless, unimpeded image.
Unyielding and indestructible, seamless and unimpeded—
a single qi, vast and round as heaven’s unfathomable void,
encompassing all things, harmed by none.
Thus, after attaining the Dao, one is called a heaven immortal.
For their eternal indestructibility, they are also called golden immortals;
for their unfathomable concealment and manifestation, they are called spirit immortals.
Yet golden immortals and spirit immortals are all heaven immortals.
To cultivate heaven immortality, apart from the Way of the Golden Elixir, no other method exists.

This Golden Elixir is what one receives from heaven at birth—
utterly good, without evil, the luminous knowing and innate ability,
perfect and whole, the numinous root.
It is the primordial, supremely yang qi, congealed into form.
Within it, yin and yang are contained, the five phases concealed;
it has qi but no substance, unlike the postnatal, tangible, turbid things of the body.
When refined through the *yin* tally and *yang* fire, tempered to maturity,
it becomes indestructible—called the Seven-Return, Nine-Cycle Golden Liquid Great Return Elixir.

The Golden Elixir is another name for the originally complete nature—
not some golden elixir existing apart from that nature.
This Elixir is possessed by all, complete in each,
neither increased in sages nor diminished in commoners.
It is the seed of immortals and buddhas, the root of sages and worthies.
Yet without the fire of refinement, yang’s extremity must turn to yin,
perfection’s extremity must wane, falling into the postnatal.
As knowledge opens, selfish desires mingle;
as temperament arises, celestial purity darkens.
Luminous knowing and innate ability both turn unwholesome,
no longer retaining the purely untainted body.
Thus the sages of old established the Way of the Golden Elixir’s return,
enabling all to return home and recognize their ancestors,
recovering what was originally their own.

How then is this called "return"? "Return" speaks of what has gone and yet comes back; "restore" means what was lost and yet is regained. That the numinous root of original nature becomes obscured is all due to the disharmony of yin and yang, the mutual injury of the Five Phases. Should yin and yang truly unite as one, the Five Phases gather and cluster, and it remains the same unbroken, perfectly complete thing as of old.

These two things—one firm, one yielding; one strong, one compliant; one true knowing, one numinous knowing; one true feeling, one numinous nature—abide thus: true knowing resides in the mind of Dao, governing firmness and strength, issuing forth as true feeling; numinous knowing lies hidden in the human mind, governing compliance and softness, containing within it numinous nature. When true knowing and numinous knowing separate, strength is no longer rightly strong, compliance no longer rightly compliant; firmness and softness lose their measure, and true feeling and numinous nature transform into false feeling and false nature. When true knowing and numinous knowing unite, strength is as it ought to be strong, compliance as it ought to be compliant; firmness and softness follow the moment. False feeling and false nature transform back into true feeling and numinous nature.

The Immortal Elder said: "When the two things meet, feeling and nature unite—how could this not be perfectly clear?"

The Five Phases are the five qi of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In the prenatal state, these five qi are the Five Primes: original nature, original feeling, original essence, original spirit, and original qi. In the postnatal state, they become the five entities: wandering soul, ghostly po, yin essence, conscious spirit, and deluded intent. The Five Primes possess the Five Virtues: humaneness, rightness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The five entities possess the Five Dispositions: joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and desire.

When the Five Phases are complete, prenatal and postnatal merge and gather, the Five Primes governing the five entities. The Dragon is yang, master of the impulse of life, belonging to Wood of the Eastern Direction, corresponding in humans to nature. The Tiger is yin, master of the impulse of destruction, belonging to Metal of the Western Direction, corresponding in humans to feeling. When the Five Phases are disharmonious, each strays from its nature: the Five Primes transform into the five entities, the Five Virtues into the Five Thieves. Dragon in the East, Tiger in the West—nature in chaos, feeling deluded—become false nature and deluded feeling, destructive qi eclipsing life qi. When the Five Phases are complete, all return to one nature: the five entities transform back into the Five Primes, the Five Thieves into the Five Virtues. Dragon coiled, Tiger crouched—nature settled, feeling forgotten—become true feeling and true nature, and even destructive qi becomes life qi.

The Way of Elixir refinement is nothing more than harmonizing firmness and softness, ensuring strength and compliance are in balance, nature and feeling united. When nature and feeling unite, yin and yang meet, the Five Phases are complete, and it is once more the undifferentiated principle of Heaven, supremely good without evil, luminous knowing and innate ability—original things restored—and the Golden Elixir returns.

Yet after the original prenatal state scatters, nature drifts east, feeling west; firmness and softness no longer respond. Without a harmonizing agent to convey messages back and forth, they remain cut off, forever unaware of each other. This harmonizing agent is the two earths of wu and ji. Wu earth governs movement and belongs to yang; ji earth governs stillness and belongs to yin. That which is utterly still is ji earth; that which responds upon sensing is wu earth. The two earths of wu and ji correspond in the Five Virtues to true trust. True trust abides within, and nature is settled; true settledness is applied without, and feeling is harmonized. When nature is settled and feeling harmonized, nature and feeling return to their root, like husband and wife in joyful union. Humaneness, rightness, propriety, and wisdom return to one trust; nature, feeling, spirit, and essence converge in one qi. The Three Families meet, the five qi pay homage to the origin, returning to the root and restoring the origin—the Golden Elixir congeals, also called the Sacred Embryo. With further effort directed upward, one moves from effortful practice to effortless attainment.

For ten months, the embryo is nurtured, firmly sealed and secured. Excess in strong feeling is drawn out, deficiency in compliant nature is replenished. Using the natural true fire, one practices "morning Layering, evening Delving," refining away postnatal yin qi. From formlessness, form arises; from the subtle, the manifest. Qi becomes full, spirit complete—with a thunderous crack, the golden cicada sheds its husk, a body appears beyond the body. The work is accomplished, the name achieved. One ascends the Northern Palace, riding a soaring simurgh, ascending in broad daylight to become a pure yang, deathless Celestial Immortal—how joyous indeed!

Alas! The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir;
the Four Great serve as the furnace, refining it into a single mass.
Those who awaken ascend at once to sagehood;
those who remain deluded sink into endless kalpas.
Men of aspiration—can you not exert yourselves?

This method is true within the true, wondrous beyond the wondrous—
all because I alone differ from others.
I know the inversion arises from *li* and *kan*;
who recognizes the floating and sinking to fix host and guest?

The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,
the jade pool first descends silver into water.
Divine work moves fire not through the whole day—
suddenly, a single wheel of sun appears in the deep pool.

The above poem speaks of refining the Golden Elixir:
one must harmonize nature and emotion, complete the Five Phases,
only then can success be achieved.
Yet while the medicinal substances are easy to know,
the firing times are most difficult.
The firing times are the method and process of refinement.

Master Lü said:
"Those of superior virtue preserve their form through the Dao—
this is their unbroken pure yang.
Those of inferior virtue extend their lives through techniques—
this is due to *kan* and *li* already formed."
For those of inferior virtue, one must rely on methods to pursue and gather.
Method is technique.
Without method or technique, one cannot return to the root and restore nothingness;
the foundation of life remains unstable, and the great Dao is hard to achieve.
Thus the immortal elder said:
"This method is true within the true, wondrous beyond the wondrous—
all because I alone differ from others."
When a method is called true and wondrous,
it is the most true and most wondrous of methods.
When a method reaches truth,
it can steal yin and yang, seize creation,
reverse life and death, invert the mechanisms of qi.
When a method reaches wondrousness,
neither spirits nor divination can fathom it;
it precedes heaven yet heaven does not oppose it,
follows heaven yet accords with the celestial timing—
this is the way of sages and worthies,
not something any minor side-method can glimpse.

The wonder of the true method of refinement—
where does its wonder lie?
Its wonder lies in inversion.
Inversion means overturning yin and yang,
reversing the workings of creation.
*Li* is fire, outwardly masculine yet inwardly feminine.
Its inner femininity is true yin;
in humans, it is the numinous awareness hidden in the human heart.
When the human heart stirs, numinous awareness flees—
like fire flaring upward.
*Kan* is water, outwardly dark yet inwardly bright.
Its inner brightness is true yang;
in humans, it is true knowing, possessed by the heart of Dao.
When the heart of Dao is obscured, true knowing hides—
like water flowing downward.

To use inversion is to give rise to the heart of Dao
and stabilize the human heart.
When the heart of Dao arises, true knowing becomes firm and strong,
and the water of essence and oneness ascends.
When the human heart is stabilized, numinous awareness becomes gentle and compliant,
and the scorching fire of excess descends.
Water above, fire below—
thus water and fire aid each other.

Numinous awareness is nature, nature belongs to wood;
wood’s nature is soft and easily floats.
True knowing is emotion, emotion belongs to metal;
metal’s emotion is hard and easily sinks.
When numinous awareness floats and acts as host,
the true contains the false.
When true knowing sinks and remains unmanifest as guest,
the false entraps the true—
this is the ordinary course.

To fix host and guest:
take the emotion of true knowing as host,
making what sinks below float upward;
take the nature of numinous awareness as guest,
making what floats above sink downward.
Host and guest reverse—
thus metal and wood unite.

When water and fire merge, metal and wood join,
the heart of Dao is strong, the human heart compliant,
true knowing and numinous awareness unite as one,
nature and emotion harmonize—
how could the Golden Elixir not coalesce?

Yet such true and wondrous techniques,
neither form nor emptiness,
lie where others do not know—
only the self knows,
hence "I know" and "who recognizes."
When others do not recognize yet the self knows,
this is the mechanism of theft.
None in the world can see or know it.

This Dao has sequence, urgency, and pacing.
If one does not grasp the wondrous use of sequence, urgency, and pacing,
even if one recognizes the medicinal substances,
inversion is hard to apply, host and guest remain unfixed.
Thus it immediately follows:
"The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,
the jade pool first descends silver into water."

Gold is a firm and hard substance;
jade is a gentle and soft substance.
The crucible is the vessel for refining medicine;
the pool is the vessel for nurturing fire.
Golden crucible and jade pool—
they illustrate the Dao of self-cultivation,
embodying hardness and softness.

The human heart belongs to *li*,
*li* is originally the body of *qian*—
this is the golden crucible.
It possesses the fire of earth’s second hexagram as numinous awareness,
the inherently gentle and compliant center of *kun*—
this is the original good capacity.
The human heart is originally empty and open,
numinously aware and unobscured.
Yet after engaging with postnatal consciousness,
it borrows awareness to generate delusion,
sees phenomena and stirs dust,
riding the wind and stirring waves without cease—
like mercury within cinnabar, which flies when heated,
most difficult to retain.
As the *Cantong qi* says:
"The flowing pearl of great yang constantly seeks to leave the person."

The heart of Dao belongs to *kan*,
*kan* is originally the body of *kun*—
this is the jade pool.
Within it hides the water of heaven’s one as true knowing,
the inherently firm, strong, and upright center of *kan*—
this is the original good knowing.
After falling into the postnatal,
guest qi takes control, true qi retreats,
yang trapped within yin, the true obscured by the false,
sinking into the sea of desire,
good knowing dimmed—
like silver in water, nearly nonexistent.

Silver is of the same kind as gold;
silver in water is the gold hidden within water.
This gold in the prenatal is the good knowing of original nature;
in the postnatal, it is the true knowing of the heart of Dao.
Because this true knowing is utterly firm and strong,
it is likened to true lead.
Because this true knowing enables transcendence and the Dao,
it is also likened to the true seed.
Since ancient times, sages and worthies
have all gathered this single great medicine to complete nature and life.

The numinous awareness of the human heart,
though easily stirred,
if restrained by the true knowing of the heart of Dao,
returns to the true and does not flee—
as the *Cantong qi* says:
"Suddenly obtaining golden radiance, it turns and interacts."
The *Huanghe fu* states:
"Within *li* are seven kinds of cinnabar—
without the true seed, it is difficult to retain even for a moment."

The seven kinds of cinnabar are tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and humors. The instability of these seven kinds of cinnabar all stems from the instability of the numinous awareness of the human heart. Yet the instability of the human heart’s numinosity arises from the loss of the heart of Dao, which fails to stabilize it. If one wishes to retain the numinous awareness of the human heart, one must first apply this true knowing of the heart of Dao. Once the true knowing and true seed are established, there is an inner sovereign that is not deluded by杂 qi, and the numinous awareness of the human heart naturally congeals without scattering. Borrowing the heart of Dao to restrain the human heart, aligning the human heart with the heart of Dao, using true knowing to govern numinous knowing, and employing numinous knowing to nurture true knowing—hard and soft correspond, strength and compliance unite, nature and emotions harmonize. Within half a *shi* (an hour), they coalesce into a single luminous and radiant pearl. Its numinous light shines brightly, and no yin or malevolent qi can harm it. Thus it is said: *"The divine work of firing is not a full day’s labor; a single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool."*

The "divine work" refers to the subtle operation of numinous clarity and the practice of *shendu* (vigilance in solitude). "Fire" refers to the harmonious qi of true knowing and numinous knowing united in hardness and softness. "Firing" means being cautious where nothing is seen and fearful where nothing is heard—applying this true knowing and numinous knowing, uniting hardness and softness, ensuring not a trace of impurity lingers within the heart. This divine fire of the work is like casting a shadow with a pole or echoing a voice in a valley. If one resolutely applies it, without waiting a full day, one can reverse yin to return to yang, like the sun over a deep pool, where yin qi naturally retreats.

The most crucial part of the verse lies in the four characters "欲留" (*desiring to retain*) and "先下" (*first applying*). Within them lies the principle of "striking first to control others," where righteousness does not yield to guests. Grasping this principle, the inversion of yin and yang, the harmonization of the four images, becomes as easy as turning one’s palm. This is the symbolic method of *waidan* (external alchemy).

*Waidan* is another name for *huandan* (returning elixir), for it has departed and then returns, has been lost and is regained, moving from without to within—hence it is called *waidan* or *huandan*. Once returned, it becomes *neidan* (internal elixir); this is the distinction between internal and external.

---

The fifth verse:
*"Tigers leap and dragons soar—waves and winds rage rough;
At the central true position, the mysterious pearl is born.
Though fruit on the branch will ripen in time,
How can the child in the womb be different?"*

*"North and south sources reverse the trigrams’ forms;
Morning and evening firing aligns with the celestial pivot.
Know that great reclusion dwells in the marketplace—
Why seek deep mountains to guard solitary stillness?"*

This poem speaks of the matter of the returning elixir, while the previous verse speaks of the Dao of the great elixir. The Dao of the great elixir is the work of a single moment. In this moment, one’s virtue merges with Heaven and Earth, one’s clarity merges with the sun and moon, one’s order merges with the four seasons, and one’s fortune merges with spirits and gods. It is difficult to encounter yet easy to err; the slightest carelessness, and the primordial true unity of qi is gained and then lost. This primordial true unity of qi is the returning elixir. Because the returning elixir is formed from the union of hard and soft qi, it is called the true unity of qi—there is no true unity of qi beyond the returning elixir.

When the returning elixir is attained, the heart of Dao is firm and strong, the human heart is soft and compliant, true knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, round and luminous—returning to the state at the beginning of life, where good knowing and good ability are quiescent and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated, the original face of things. This thing, due to its firm nature, is called true lead; due to its robust qi, it is also called the male tiger. True lead and the male tiger are both the vast and upright qi, utterly good without evil, the innate celestial truth of good knowing and good ability.

Having regained this celestial truth, one must return it to the state before parents were born, where the five phases do not reach, to forge an enduring and indestructible celestial truth. Thus, when celestial truth is restored, one must warm and nurture it, seal and store it securely, emptying to the utmost and stilling profoundly. When yang qi is abundant and stillness reaches its peak, movement arises, and the numinous sprout appears—the time when, as Ancestor Lü said, *"The midnight hour lingers, the lead cauldron warms, and light pierces the curtains."*

At this moment, the yang light emerges from its cave like a tiger, vigorous and unstoppable. One must swiftly use the spark of empty numinous fire from true nature to meet it. This empty numinous fire is called the female dragon. *"Tigers leap and dragons soar"* symbolizes the struggle of yin and yang. *"Waves and winds rage rough"* signifies the wind rising as the tiger leaves its cave and the waves surging as the dragon leaves the pool—the contention of yin and yang. When dragon and tiger unite, nature and emotions harmonize, merging into one and entering the center. The primordial qi comes from emptiness, congealing into a single millet-like pearl—the sacred embryo takes form.

The sacred embryo is the valley spirit; the valley spirit is the numinous union of *xuan* and *pin*. Yang *xuan* is the tiger’s emotion; yin *pin* is the dragon’s nature. When nature and emotion unite, the sacred embryo forms; when the primordial *pin* is established, the valley spirit is born. At this stage, the work of action is complete, and the work of non-action manifests—no further effort is needed; one lets it be. Like fruit on the branch, it will ripen in time; like the child in the womb, it will be born in due course.

Yet even as the sacred embryo congeals, one must still guard against danger and risk—this cannot be ignored. *"North and south sources reverse the trigrams’ forms"* means the south is fire, the north is water; when the sacred embryo congeals, harmonious qi steams and permeates, water and fire return to their source, naturally refining each other. One practices the work of neither forgetting nor forcing. *"Morning and evening firing aligns with the celestial pivot"* means morning is the beginning of the day, when yang qi governs; evening is the beginning of the night, when yin qi governs.

The celestial pivot is the dynamic of yin and yang qi—when yang is due, one employs yang; when yin is due, one employs yin. The firing process advances and retreats, subtly aligning with the mechanisms of morning and evening, the ceaseless vigilance of day and night. Neither forgetting nor forcing, this day-and-night vigilance, this gentle nurturing over ten months, transforms the postnatal trigrams and sheds the prenatal dharmakāya. My life is governed by me, not by Heaven.

This Dao is cultivated among humanity and practiced amid the dust of the marketplace. Its great function and true application lie in concrete effort, not in empty, effortless extinction. Thus it is said: *One must know the great hermit dwells in the city’s bustle—why seek solitude in deep mountains?*

**Sixth Stanza**
Every person possesses the elixir of immortality,
Yet deluded seekers heedlessly cast it aside.
When sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite;
Where the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li merge.
The well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists;
The fence-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.
When the cinnabar ripens, gold fills the house—
Why search for herbs to burn as straw?

The three preceding poems elucidate the great elixir of returned cinnabar, its ingredients, and firing times in full and clear detail. Yet lest practitioners mistakenly assume the golden elixir is forged by refining common substances, this poem follows closely to correct such errors.

The golden elixir is none other than the original nature of innate knowing and innate ability, bestowed upon each person. This nature is complete in all, perfectly realized in each—unchanged in sages, undiminished in ordinary beings. It requires no external pursuit, for it is inherently one’s own. With a resolute heart, one ascends directly to the sacred realm; with nature stabilized and life congealed, it endures unbroken. This original nature of innate knowing and ability is the great elixir of immortality.

All deluded seekers, failing to investigate the true principles of sages and worthies, neglecting the root of nature and life, abandon the near to chase the distant, discard the real to grasp the false. They pass their lives in vain, achieving nothing by old age—heedlessly casting away what is most precious. How lamentable! How tragic!

Human life is endowed with the vigorous virtue of innate knowing, received from Heaven—this is Heaven itself. It is also endowed with the compliant virtue of innate ability, received from Earth—this is Earth itself. The originally empty, luminous spirit is the numinous nature, transformed from Earth’s qi—this is fire. The originally pure, unadulterated essence is true feeling, transformed from the qi of Heaven’s unity—this is water.

When one unites vigor and compliance as one, Heaven and Earth within the body merge, like sweet dew sprinkling the heart, instantly dissolving afflictions. When one preserves spirit and essence without dissipation, Kan and Li within the body unite, like the yellow sprout naturally arising, restoring primordial qi.

Sweet dew descends when the heart is clear. The yellow sprout arises when the mind is still. With heart clear and mind still, innate knowing and innate ability, the one numinous true nature, hangs suspended in empty space—serene and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated. Constantly active, constantly tranquil, unshaken by transformation, unbent by the myriad things, *my life is governed by me, not by Heaven.*

This is the Way of longevity. How could the frog in the well know of this dragon’s cave? How could the sparrow in the fence comprehend this phoenix’s nest?

Hearing talk of medicinal substances and firing times, one may suspect these to be the strange and bizarre techniques of burning and refining in the Mao school, with no limit to their eccentricities. Yet they know not that in the great elixir’s cultivation, when the day of ripening arrives, gold and jade fill the hall—life preserved, form perfected, wealth and honor incomparable. How could one cling to the dross of worldly things?

**Its seventh [poem] states:**
*Know well the source where the medicine is born—*
*Only in the southwest recognize your homeland.*
*When lead meets the arising of gui, swiftly gather;*
*Gold past the full moon is no longer fit to taste.*
*Send it to the earthen crucible, sealed fast;*
*Then join with the flowing pearl in proper match.*
*A pound of medicine requires two times eight;*
*Adjust the firing time, entrusting to yin and yang.*

This verse speaks of the elixir of longevity present in every person, yet does not specify where or when the medicine arises. Thus, this poem clarifies the precise origin of its birth, so that practitioners may work in accord with the time and carefully tend the firing.

The southwest is the direction of *kun*, where the moon’s waning reaches its extreme and revives—where yin at its utmost generates yang. In the human body, this is the moment when stillness reaches its extreme and first stirs. This stirring at stillness’s extreme is when the great medicine appears. Yet this stirring is not the movement of external guest qi or emotional desires, nor the inner stirring of the heart’s thoughts and intentions. It is the stirring of the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing, the stirring of the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. This Heavenly Heart and innate knowing, this Dao-Heart and true knowing—because they can transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, raise the dead and restore life—they are symbolized as the medicinal substance. Because at the moment of extreme stillness, when the ten thousand conditions are all stilled, the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing and the Dao-Heart’s true knowing reveal a glimmer of light at their inception, they are symbolized as the place where the medicine is born. Because the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing and the Dao-Heart’s true knowing arise from darkness as whiteness, emerge from emptiness, and stir from stillness like a river with its source, they are symbolized as the river-source where the medicine is born.

This medicine is, in the prior heaven, the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing; in the posterior heaven, it is the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. The Dao-Heart is the reflection of the Heavenly Heart; true knowing is the reflection of innate knowing. Because the Heavenly Heart, submerged in the posterior heaven, cannot always abide and only occasionally appears, it has another name: the Dao-Heart. Because innate knowing, sunk in the sea of desire, has its radiance dimmed and only intermittently remains unobscured, it has another name: true knowing. Yet after the return to the origin, the Dao-Heart is still the Heavenly Heart, and true knowing is still innate knowing. When it occasionally appears and intermittently remains unobscured, this is the homeland of the Dao-Heart’s true knowing. For in the place where it occasionally appears and intermittently remains unobscured, a spark of the prior heaven’s true unity and vital impulse resides. By relying on this spark and reversing the course of cultivation, how could one not restore the Dao-Heart’s true knowing to the Heavenly Heart’s innate knowing? Yet the restoration is not difficult—what matters is knowing the stirring at stillness’s extreme, the river-source.

Laozi said: *"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; the ten thousand things arise together, and I thereby observe their return."* The *Book of Changes* states: *"The Way of return: in seven days it comes back."* Both refer to the river-source where the Dao-Heart’s true knowing is born.

Once the river-source of the medicine’s birth is known, one must understand the moment to begin. The marvelous work of elixir refinement is simply to take the Dao-Heart’s single flavor as the mother of the elixir. Because the Dao-Heart is firm and strong, possessing the sentiment of true knowing, it is symbolized as true lead—lead containing silver, black without and white within. The Dao-Heart contains true knowing, dark without yet bright within, which is why the immortals all compare the Dao-Heart’s true knowing to true lead. They are unwilling to point it out directly, valuing and honoring it, lest it be stolen by the unworthy.

This Dao-Heart’s true knowing, buried and drowned by emotions and desires, cannot emerge on its own. Yet once the river-source is known, it can be gradually gathered and restored. The method of restoration must still be sought within emotions and desires. True knowing is born of Heaven’s one, a pure and perfectly clear yang water—*ren* water. Emotions and desires are born of Earth’s six, a turbid and utterly impure yin water—*gui* water. *Ren* water is hidden within *gui* water; without *gui* water’s arising, *ren* water does not appear, and true lead is not seen. *"When lead meets the arising of gui"* refers precisely to the joining of yin and yang qi, when *gui* has just arisen but has not yet taken effect. *Ren* water has not dispersed, true knowing has not dimmed—swiftly gather it and return it to the suspended womb crucible, and emotions and desires will have no place to act and will naturally vanish. This is what Zhang Sanfeng meant by *"plucking the fresh blossoms beyond the wall."*

*"Gold past the full moon"* refers to having obtained the return of true knowing. Relying on this single spark of true knowing’s true sentiment, it is augmented again and again, advancing toward firmness, strength, centrality, and purity—like refining white gold from lead, its color full and bright. At this stage, innate knowing and innate ability shine unobscured, responding to things with flexibility, moving or stilling at will. Walking freely, every step is the Way—like a bright moon hanging in the sky, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds, penetrating the hidden and reaching the obscure. One may then abandon the work of augmentation, leave effortful practice, and enter effortlessness.

Yet if one does not know the firing time and fails to stop at fullness, the round will inevitably wane, brightness at its extreme will turn to darkness—like the moon past fullness, where yang generates yin. True knowing is harmed, the true dims and the false arises, and what remains is the dross of the posterior heaven—how could it be fit to taste? Thus, when true knowing has returned to fullness, swiftly send it to the central earthen crucible, seal it firmly to prevent the slightest leakage, then match it with the single drop of numinous flowing pearl from one’s original nature. Borrowing yin to aid yang, using emptiness to nourish fullness, one guards against danger and considers risk. The goal is to reach the state where firmness and softness are as one, yin and yang in perfect balance.

When the dual eights reach their full count—neither more nor less—advance until the ore is exhausted and the gold is pure, without a trace of qi-quality remaining. Yet to fulfill the dual eights, one must rely entirely on regulating the firing time, discerning maturity from tenderness, knowing when to stop at sufficiency, distinguishing fortune from misfortune, and recognizing urgency from slowness. When the time calls for advancing yang, advance yang; when the time calls for moving yin, move yin. Neither great nor small is harmed, and both states are preserved whole. Naturally, the true unified qi of the prior heaven emerges from emptiness, coalescing without dispersion—thus the sacred embryo takes form.

Regulating the firing time precisely adjusts the ceaseless interplay of firmness and softness. When the medicine weighs one jin, firmness and softness both return to central equilibrium; the dual eights align, yin contains yang, yang contains yin, yin and yang merge as one, firmness and softness wholly transform. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating—once responsive and instantly penetrating, still and unmoving, it becomes an indestructible thing forever.

Alas! The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission; the hour’s arrival at midnight lies in heart-to-heart transmission. The medicine’s nature is inherently difficult to know, and the firing time is likewise not easily understood—how can the seeker not urgently seek a true teacher?

This poem encompasses the medicine, the firing time, the wondrous workings of the returning elixir and the great elixir, all contained within. It is the most crucial among the sixteen poems. The reader must carefully delve into its depths, not letting a single word slip by. If one truly comprehends even a part, upon meeting a true teacher, a single phrase may reveal the ten thousand methods.

**Poem Eight**
Cease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits,
Seeking myriad herbs is even less the truth.
Only when yin and yang find their kind do they merge,
At the balanced two-and-eight they naturally unite.

At the pond’s depths, the sun crimson—yin’s illusions vanish;
At the mountain’s peak, the moon pale—the elixir sprouts anew.
If men of this age wish to know true lead and mercury,
They are not the common cinnabar or quicksilver.

This poem speaks of true lead and true mercury, the two medicines conjoined, which alone can accomplish the golden elixir. Yet some may suspect the golden elixir to be a tangible worldly substance, forged through smelting—thus the poem immediately declares: *"Cease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; seeking myriad herbs is even less the truth."* The Three Yellows are sulfur, realgar, and orpiment; the Four Spirits are cinnabar, mercury, lead, and saltpeter. The Three Yellows, Four Spirits, and all herbs are not of our kind—how could they sustain life? How could they refine nature? Failing to sustain life and refine nature, all is in vain, not the true Way.

*The Three Categories* states: *"Of like kind, effort is easily applied; of unlike seed, no achievement is made."* Humans, endowed with heaven and earth’s yin and yang qi, possess within their bodies the qi and virtue of yin and yang. Yang is firmness; yin is softness. The virtue of firmness governs life; the virtue of softness governs nature. Thus, this firm yang and soft yin are the very source of nature and life. Of like kind: yang takes yin as its kind, and yin takes yang as its kind. When yin and yang find their kind, firmness and softness respond—like husband and wife long parted, meeting suddenly, how could they not merge?

The two-and-eight: within yin, true yang is firm and upright; within yang, true yin is gentle and balanced. When firmness and softness both return to the center, yin and yang are in perfect balance, neither leaning nor tilting—they naturally unite, intimately bound, merging into a single qi, congealing without dispersion. When yin and yang find their kind, and the two-and-eight are balanced, the postnatal returns to the prenatal: the Dao-heart is firm, the human heart is gentle, true knowing and numinous knowing merge, and the original, single spark of innate knowing and ability emerges from the void of thought.

Like the crimson sun rising from the pond’s depths—yin’s illusions vanish;
Like the pale moon hanging high on the mountain’s peak—the elixir sprouts fresh.
For when the upright qi arises, deviant qi naturally retreats; when the true returns, the false instantly dissolves. The crimson sun at the pond’s depths and the pale moon on the mountain’s peak both depict the manifestation of true yang, the return of the celestial heart. With the celestial heart restored, knowing and ability are both refined—this is the golden elixir. This golden elixir is the true yin and true yang originally possessed, conjoined in firmness and softness, the true treasure of fulfilling nature and attaining life—how could it be forged from common cinnabar or quicksilver?

**Poem Nine**
Within yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness;
Cultivating but one thing only weakens the body.

Exhausting the body with massage and stretching is not the Dao;
Ingesting qi and consuming mist is all madness.
The world vainly seeks to subdue lead and mercury—
When shall true dragon and tiger descend?

I urge you to thoroughly investigate the source of your birth,
For returning to the origin and restoring the primordial is the King of Medicines.

The preceding poem speaks of the golden elixir’s ingredients—
Not the external three yellows or four spirits, nor common herbs or vulgar things.
Thus, the cultivator must refine within the body itself.
Yet most do not know that after the prenatal true yang is lost,
All that remains in the body is the yin essence within yang.
This yin essence is not merely the essence of intercourse;
All tears, saliva, fluids, blood, and qi are yin essence.
Its nature is not firm—it exists while the body exists, vanishes when the body perishes,
Rising and falling with the illusory form.
If one cultivates only this yin essence within yang, hoping to preserve life and perfect the form,
It only weakens the body further, and success remains elusive.
Those who exhaust their bodies with shadow-stretching, ingest qi, or feast on mist,
Along with the myriad schools—
Some refine yin essence, others supplement it—
All stray from the Dao, drifting ever farther.
How could they subdue true lead and true mercury, returning to the one qi?
How could they tame true dragon and true tiger, uniting them as one?

The Way of the golden elixir is the thoroughfare of birth;
The Way of birth is the union of the two—yin and yang—into one.
In this union, the vital mechanism resides.
The Way of human birth relies on mortal father and mother to produce the illusory body;
The Way of immortal birth relies on the numinous father and sacred mother to complete the true body.
The numinous father is the firm and vigorous true knowing;
The sacred mother is the yielding and receptive numinous knowing.
Both human and immortal birth lie beyond yin and yang—
The difference lies only in the sacred and the mundane, the reverse and the forward.
If one thoroughly investigates the principle of birth—
Great awakening, great enlightenment—
Understanding how parents unite, how they join,
How conception occurs, how the fetus is nurtured,
How the fetus matures, how birth transpires,
How the child is nursed, how it learns to walk, how it grows—
Then the entire process of cultivation becomes clear and bright.
One may proceed directly, returning to the origin and restoring the primordial,
Reviving the dead, preserving life and perfecting the form,
Becoming the great King of Medicines.
For the great Way of true cultivation
Is nothing but the principle of birth—no other method exists.
Those who follow all other side paths—
Lone yin, solitary yang, clinging to emptiness or form, cultivating but one thing—
How could they know this?

**Poem Ten**
Diligently seek true lead with intent,
Lest time slip by in vain.
But capture the earthly po with cinnabar mercury,
And the celestial hun will naturally restrain watery metal.
This may be called: the Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;
It may be said: virtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere.
Once you know longevity equals heaven and earth,
No vexation shall ever arise in the heart.

The preceding poem teaches one to thoroughly investigate the source of birth,
To return to the origin and restore the primordial.
Yet to do so, one must recognize the one great medicine—true lead.
Recognizing true lead means all ten thousand affairs are complete;
All else becomes easy.
True lead is no other thing—
It is the true knowing of the heart-mind’s Dao, as mentioned before.
True knowing is also called the true seed.
Without recognizing the true seed, cultivation lacks a root,
And all efforts are in vain.
Thus it says: *Diligently seek true lead with intent*—
The phrase *with intent* contains the work of investigating things and attaining knowledge, the effort of exhausting principle.
If one wishes to cultivate the great Dao,
First thoroughly investigate real principle.
Once real principle is penetrated, the work of cultivation yields immediate results.
Without such penetration, vainly hoping for celestial treasures
Is like grasping at emptiness—wasting time in vain.

Earthly po and watery metal are yang within yin,
All images of true knowing.
Celestial hun and cinnabar mercury are yin within yang,
All images of numinous knowing.
*But capture the earthly po with cinnabar mercury*—
This means using true knowing to restrain numinous knowing.
*And the celestial hun will naturally restrain watery metal*—
This means using numinous knowing to nurture true knowing.
True knowing is firm, belonging to yang, the husband;
Numinous knowing is yielding, belonging to yin, the wife.
When the husband restrains the wife, the wife naturally submits;
When the wife submits, the husband also cherishes her.
Husband and wife in harmony, the vital mechanism endures.
As the *Cantong Qi* says:
*"The great yang’s flowing pearl ever seeks to depart;
Only when it obtains golden radiance does it turn and abide."*
True knowing and numinous knowing, two united as one,
Firmness and softness return to the center.
Transformed into good knowing and good ability,
Still and unmoving, yet responsive to all things—
The sacred embryo takes form.
At this stage, the Dao is lofty, and dragons and tigers submit;
Virtue is weighty, and ghosts and spirits revere.
Longevity equals heaven and earth,
And what vexation could ever trouble the heart?

**Poem Eleven**
Yellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find—
The discerning must rely on deep virtue and conduct.
The four images and five phases all depend on earth;
The three origins and eight trigrams how could they leave ren?
Refining the numinous essence, others cannot recognize it;
Dissolving yin demons, ghosts dare not intrude.
Wishing to leave this secret formula among humankind,
Yet not a single soul is a true confidant.

The preceding poem speaks of the Dao’s loftiness and virtue’s weight,
Where dragons, tigers, ghosts, and spirits all submit—
Thus, one with the Dao must not lack virtue,
And one with virtue must not lack the Dao.
The supreme Way is not complex;
The great medicine is not distant.
White clouds lie near at hand;
Yellow sprouts grow within the household.
If one has the will, it may be grasped effortlessly—
Thus it says: *not hard to find*.
Yet this Way transcends the mundane to enter the sacred,
Revives the dead, and is the rarest thing under heaven.
Though not hard to find, only those of great virtue and conduct can know it—
Thus it says: *the discerning must rely on deep virtue and conduct*.
If one is truly a virtuous gentleman or noble man,
It will not be hard to find.

The Four Symbols are the four qi of Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, which together with Earth form the Five Phases. The Three Origins are Heaven Origin, Earth Origin, and Human Origin. Alternatively, Upper Origin, Middle Origin, and Lower Origin also constitute the Three Origins. The Eight Trigrams are the yin and yang of the Four Symbols and Five Phases: Qian is yang Metal, Dui is yin Metal; Kan is yang Water, Gen is yin Water; Zhen is yang Wood, Xun is yin Wood; Li is yang Fire, Kun is yin Fire. Though the Eight Trigrams correspond to the yin and yang of the Four Symbols, Kun and Gen also contain the two Earths, wu and ji. Kun is yin Earth, Gen is yang Earth, and the qi of the Five Phases is also within them. In humans, the Five Phases manifest as the five origins of nature, emotion, essence, spirit, and qi, which unfold into the five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The Three Origins in humans are original essence, original qi, and original spirit, while the Eight Trigrams in humans correspond to the five origins, five virtues, and the nature of hardness and softness. In sum, the Four Symbols, Three Origins, and Eight Trigrams are all transformations of the Five Phases—there are no Four Symbols, Three Origins, or Eight Trigrams beyond the Five Phases.

When Metal in the Four Symbols and Five Phases relies on Earth, it is like benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all depending on trust to be complete. How can the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams depart from ren? This is like nature, emotion, spirit, and qi not departing from the unity of essence. The Yellow Sprout is the vital force of Earth, with trust at its core. The White Snow is the light clarity of Water, with essence reaching unity. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom return to trust, holding fast to the center, and the Yellow Sprout gradually grows. Nature, emotion, spirit, and qi return to unity, being only essence and unity. As the White Thunder soars into the void, essence and unity hold the center. Through cultivation and refinement, the longer one practices, the stronger the effort. The mind of Dao remains ever-vigilant, the human mind ever-still. True knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, and a single luminous pearl hangs in the emptiness. Constantly responsive, constantly still, form and emptiness unbound, manifesting or hidden as the time requires—before Heaven, Heaven does not oppose it; after Heaven, it accords with Heaven’s timing. If even Heaven does not oppose it, how much less so humans? How much less so ghosts and spirits? Though people may not recognize it and ghosts cannot invade, is this mere empty talk?

This Dao is utterly simple and effortless, concise and unburdened. Those who know it ascend to sagehood in an instant, without waiting three years or nine refinements. Yet in the world, there are few virtuous gentlemen, no true men—most merely grasp the axe to hew the axe-handle, still thinking it distant. As the Immortal Elder said: *"I wish to leave this secret melody among men, yet I have not met a single true confidant."* Is this not lamentable?

Yin and yang in grasses and trees stand paired as one;
Lack but a single half, and fragrance is undone.
First unfurl green leaves, yang’s primacy proclaimed,
Then bloom red blossoms, yin in quiet train unnamed.
This common Way is daily life’s unchanging course,
Yet who returns to this true source with conscious force?
I say to all who seek the Dao, take heed and hear:
Without yin-yang’s discernment, act not without fear.

The former poem spoke of virtue’s cultivation due;
This poem speaks of the Dao’s illumination true.
The *Yi* says: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.”
It also says: “Heaven and earth in misty union blend,
The myriad things in harmony transform and mend.
Male and female in essence meet,
The myriad things in life complete.”

The Way of Golden Elixir relies entirely on yang’s vigor and yin’s compliance for its operation. When yin and yang unite as one, the elixir is born and life extended; when yin and yang diverge, discord arises and life is forfeit. Observe the insensate grasses and trees: first, green leaves emerge as yang takes the lead; next, red flowers follow as yin comes in train. Yin and yang never part, and by analogy, all sentient beings in the common Way achieve nothing outside yin and yang—only that the common Way flows with them while the immortal Way reverses their course. To flow with them is to follow yin and yang; to reverse them is to invert yin and yang’s operation. Worldly people know only the Way of following; they do not know the Way of inversion. Thus they chase illusory realms, lose the true source, and when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—when yin reaches its peak, death follows.

For scholars, the first step is to recognize the two things: yin and yang. Once yin and yang are known, the true source is likewise known. The true source is the Gate of Mystery and Darkness, where yin is born, where yang is born, where following and inversion both reside. Know the constant and return to the root, and you ascend to sagehood in an instant.

Yet yin and yang are not uniform: there are prior-heaven yin and yang, posterior-heaven yin and yang; there are yin and yang of fate, yin and yang of nature; there are true yin and yang, false yin and yang; there are outer yin and yang, inner yin and yang. All these must be thoroughly investigated until clarity is achieved before daring to proceed. Without recognizing true yin and true yang, acting recklessly leads to abandoning the real for the false, squandering one’s nature and life.

Thirteen

Not knowing inversion’s turn within the mystery’s core,
How can one plant lotuses in fire’s embrace more?
Lead the White Tiger home to tend with care,
And bear a luminous pearl bright as the moon’s sphere.

Do not idly watch the furnace, tending flame and hour,
But still the spirit’s breath and let nature take its power.
When all yin is stripped away, the elixir ripens true,
Leap from the cage of mortal bounds to live ten thousand years anew.

The former poem taught recognition of yin and yang;
This poem teaches the investigation of their function’s span.
Function is the method of inverting yin and yang.
Without knowing this inversion’s art, how grasp the lotus in fire’s fang?

What is inverted? What is turned? The White Tiger, metal-aligned,
Is the pure, unyielding qi of Qian’s palace, named the mind of Dao,
Which, when invested, becomes the true knowing’s emotion.
Yet through posterior-heaven’s exchange, the human mind takes sway,
The mind of Dao grows dim, true feeling fades and false arises,
As the White Tiger leaves its home to roam and harm afar.
To invert is to return from false feeling to the true,
To pair it with true nature, as the White Tiger homeward drew.

When true feeling moves, true nature appears,
And nature and feeling in love unite.
The prior-heaven’s true unity of qi arises from the void,
Forming a precious pearl, round as the moon’s full light,
Its radiance illuminating mountains, rivers, and the earth entire,
As if held within the palm—this is the Golden Elixir’s sign.
As the *Cantong Qi* says: “When metal returns to nature’s dawn,
It is called the Returned Elixir,” and so it is drawn.

Once the Returned Elixir is formed,
Innate knowing and ability, in stillness, act not,
In motion, follow nature’s course, at ease within the Way.
Medicine is fire, fire is medicine,
The work of gathering is unneeded.
Simply still the spirit’s breath and let nature hold its sway.
Within the furnace of creation, yin and yang in harmony blend,
True fire refines away the posterior-heaven’s yin,
Transforming it to pure yang—this is the elixir’s ripening.
Swallow and ingest it, shed the mortal coil,
Leap from the mundane cage, your life span heaven’s to share,
And live forever, deathless, beyond compare.

Fourteen

Three, five, one—just three words compose the key,
Yet from ancient times to now, few truly see.

East three and south two together make five,
North one and west four complete the same.
Wu and Ji return to the generative number five,
When the three families meet, the infant is formed.
Know then that the Great One contains true qi,
After ten months the embryo is full—enter the sacred foundation.

The preceding poem holds the principle of inverting yin and yang,
This poem speaks of the work of gathering the five phases.
At the dawn of human life, the five-phase nature one possesses
Was originally a single qi in perfect unity.
Yet through engagement with the posterior-heaven,
Each phase scatters its nature:
Metal and wood cannot coexist,
Water and fire do not interact.
True earth lies buried,
False earth runs rampant.
Nature is disordered, destiny shaken,
Yang qi exhausted and yin qi pure—
How can one avoid death?
The immortal elder points to the three words "three-five-one,"
Teaching people to gather the five phases into one family,
Restoring our original innate knowing and ability,
The unblemished face of heaven’s principle.
Yet these three words—three-five-one—
Have led astray countless heroes through the ages.
Among them, those who truly understand can be counted on one’s fingers.

What is meant by "three-five"?
They are the generative numbers of the five phases in the *River Chart*:
East three is wood, south two is fire.
Fire is born of wood, so wood and fire form one family—one five.
West four is metal, north one is water.
Water is born of metal, so metal and water form one family—one five.
The center, earth, stands alone as one family—one five.
The cultivator who clearly understands the three-fives,
Reverses the course and refines them,
Harmonizing the four images and gathering the five phases,
So that nature, emotion, essence, qi, and spirit congeal.
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust share the same qi—
This is called "the three families meeting."
In Confucianism, it is named "Great Ultimate,"
Also "Heaven’s Principle," "Supreme Goodness," or "Utmost Sincerity."
In Daoism, it is called "the Infant,"
Also "prior-heaven’s singular qi," "sacred embryo," or "golden elixir."
In Buddhism, it is named "Perfect Enlightenment,"
Also "true emptiness," "Dharma-body," "śarīra," or "cintāmaṇi."
In sum, it is "heaven’s innate good nature."
When the Dao restores this original nature,
Innate knowing and ability return to their source,
Nurtured for ten months until qi is full and spirit complete.
One escapes the sea of suffering,
Gains a body beyond the body,
And enters the sacred foundation of non-birth and non-extinction.

Fifteen
Not knowing true lead, the true ancestor,
All efforts are vainly expended.
Parting from one’s wife only severs yin and yang,
Fasting merely empties the stomach and bowels.
Herbs, metals, and silver are all impure substances,
Clouds, mist, sun, and moon belong to illusion.
Even if one masters breath-work and visualization,
All differ from the work of the golden elixir.

The preceding poem speaks of gathering the five phases into one qi
To enter the sacred foundation.
Yet to gather the five phases,
One must first recognize the prior-heaven’s true singular qi.
The single yang within Kan
Is the firm, strong, and upright qi of Qian’s house,
The true knowing of the Dao-heart,
Symbolized as true lead—born of heaven’s one.
It holds the prior-heaven’s true singular qi,
The ancestral qi that gives life to all things.
Within it lies the potential to become a sage or immortal,
To become a buddha or transcendent—
It is the root of sages and worthies,
The seed of immortals and buddhas,
The true ancestor of the golden elixir.
As the saying goes, "Know the one, and all affairs are complete."
Without recognizing true lead, one lacks an ancestor,
And the elixir has no root.
All practices—abandoning one’s wife, fasting,
Refining herbs, metals, or silver,
Ingesting clouds, mist, sun, or moon,
Expelling turbid qi, or visualizing images—
Either cling to emptiness or grasp at forms,
All efforts are wasted,
And how do they relate to the golden elixir?

Sixteen
Though ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures exist,
The golden elixir has but this one root.
Rely on Kun’s position to form the body,
Plant it in Qian’s palace of mutual resonance.
Do not fault the celestial mechanism for being revealed,
For it is learners’ own ignorance that blinds them.
If one grasps the meaning of this poem,
One will immediately meet the Three Pure Ones and the Most High.

The preceding fifteen poems,
Whether speaking of the sequential or the reverse,
Whether divided or unified,
Whether pointing to the medicine or indicating the firing times,
Distinguishing true from false,
Or setting forth right and wrong in detail—
Their subtle layers, though scattered, are not yet whole.
Fearing that people might doubt the complexity of the work
And find progress difficult,
This poem summarizes the meaning of the fifteen,
Revealing the utmost simplicity and ease of the Dao.

Since ancient times, the perfected immortals,
In their scriptures and Daoist texts,
Have used a thousand metaphors and a hundred analogies,
Establishing images and crafting words
To exhaustively describe and clarify the marrow of the Dao.
Though their expressions differ,
Their principles are the same—
All illuminate the root of the golden elixir.
Yet in later ages,
The more books there are, the more people are confused.
Each clings to their own views,
Straying into side doors—
How could they know that the root of the golden elixir
Lies in "taking from Kan to fill Li,"
Relying on Kun to return to Qian in one move?
"Kun’s position forming the body" refers to the single yang within Kan;
"Qian’s palace of mutual resonance" refers to the single yin within Li.
Kan is originally Kun’s body, hence "Kun’s position";
Li is originally Qian’s body, hence "Qian’s house."
Qian is easy to know, Kun is simple in its power;
Qian is firm and strong, Kun is yielding and compliant.
Because of its firmness and strength, it is easy to know and does not resist;
Because of its yielding compliance, it is simple in its power and unforced.
This ease of knowing and simplicity of power,
In humans, is the original innate knowing and ability of our nature.
At the beginning of human life,
Strength and compliance were one,
Firmness and softness blended,
Unknowing and unperceiving,
Following the emperor’s rule—
Round and complete, radiant and bright,
Pure and bare, unadorned and free,
There was only the original innate knowing and ability of our nature,
Without a trace of impurity.

By the age of sixteen, yang reaches its peak and generates yin, entering the postnatal realm where yin-qi prevails. Principle and desire intermingle, firmness and compliance fall out of balance, hardness and softness lose their measure. Thus yang is trapped by yin, the celestial truth becomes obscured—like Qian uniting with Kun, Qian’s single yang line enters the Kun palace, and Kun’s solidity transforms into Kan. Yin usurps yang’s position, knowledge gradually awakens—like Kun uniting with Qian, Kun’s single yin line enters the Qian palace, and Qian’s emptiness transforms into Li.

When the celestial truth is obscured, the Dao-heart hides and becomes faint; when knowledge awakens, the human heart arises and becomes perilous. Faintness means near-absence, for yang cannot overcome yin; peril means responding to appearances with emotion, for yin overcomes yang. Yet though the Dao-heart is faint and the human heart perilous, the Dao-heart is not entirely extinguished, nor is the human heart entirely dominant. The Dao-heart is not entirely extinguished because at times a spark of clarity may arise within darkness—this is called true knowing, though it flickers and vanishes. The human heart is not entirely dominant because it can respond to circumstances with adaptability—this is called numinous knowing, though it merely borrows numinosity to generate delusion.

The Way of cultivating the elixir is to return yang within yin, extracting the true knowing of the Dao-heart and refining the numinous knowing of the human heart. When numinous knowing returns to truth and true knowing returns to numinosity, the Dao-heart becomes firm and strong, the human heart becomes yielding and compliant; yin and yang interact, hardness and softness respond; firmness and compliance align, true and numinous knowing remain undispersed. Thus one restores the original face of innate knowing and ability from the Qian era—this is called "extracting Kan to fill Li," or "planting in Kun to cultivate Qian." In truth, it means relying on Kun’s position to form the body and sowing in Qian’s palace of interaction—this is precisely the meaning of "extracting Kan to fill Li." Extracting Kan releases the yang trapped within, restoring Kun; filling Li transforms the yin mixed within, restoring Qian. When the bodies of Qian and Kun are complete, the Mysterious Female is established and the Valley Spirit abides; the Golden Elixir coagulates, nature and life are attained, and one is no longer bound by postnatal transformation. This is the celestial mechanism transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas.

The ancient immortals refused to speak of it plainly. The Immortal Elder, in his great compassion, revealed in sixteen poems what the ancients had left unsaid—truly "uprooting the celestial root and chiseling the cavern of principle." In the closing lines, he directly points to the root and origin of the Golden Elixir, fully disclosing the celestial mechanism. If one awakens to the marvelous meaning in these poems, one may ascend directly to the sacred realm and immediately behold the Three Pure Ones—how could this be empty words?

*Direct Pointers to Awakening the Truth*, Scroll Two: Sixty-Four Seven-Character Quatrains, Corresponding to the Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*. On the Cauldron and Furnace (Two Poems):

**I**
First take Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel,
Then gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine.
Once these two things are driven back to the Yellow Path,
How could the Golden Elixir fail to be born?

Qian is firmness, symbolizing Heaven; Kun is compliance, symbolizing Earth. In humans, they are the natures of hardness and softness. The sun contains the Crow—yang within yin—corresponding to the hexagram Li, which is yang outside and yin within; its inner yin line is true yin, in humans the numinous knowing hidden in the human heart. The moon contains the Hare—yin within yang—corresponding to the hexagram Kan, which is yin outside and yang within; its inner yang line is true yang, in humans the true knowing inherent in the Dao-heart.

"First take Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel" means using firmness and compliance as the foundation for elixir-cultivation. "Then gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine" means employing true knowing and numinous knowing as the function of elixir-cultivation. Refining true knowing until nothing is untrue restores hardness to central correctness; refining numinous knowing until nothing is obscured restores softness to central correctness. When both hardness and softness return to central correctness, the Dao-heart is firm and the human heart compliant; true knowing and numinous knowing merge into one, like driving the Crow and Hare back to the Yellow Path.

The Yellow Path is the Central Path, the sun’s course. The sun travels the Central Path, while the moon travels nine paths. The nine paths consist of four pairs—blue, red, white, and black—each extending beyond the Yellow Path, making eight paths in total. When the moon meets the sun, they interact and travel together, forming nine paths. The place where the sun and moon interact is called "the two things returning to the Yellow Path."

At the beginning of human life, there is only one true and numinous nature of innate knowing and ability, with no human heart or Dao-heart. After entering the postnatal realm, the human heart and Dao-heart become distinct, as do true knowing and numinous knowing. The human heart encompasses all perception and movement—perception is numinous knowing; the Dao-heart encompasses all situations without delusion—non-delusion is true knowing. The human heart can only possess numinous knowing, not true knowing, and its nature is soft, hence called yin. The Dao-heart possesses true knowing and can also employ numinous knowing, and its qi is hard, hence called yang.

Even sages have a human heart, and even ordinary people have a Dao-heart. Sages have a human heart because they cannot eliminate perception; ordinary people have a Dao-heart because they occasionally have moments of clarity. What distinguishes sages from ordinary people is that their true and numinous knowing remain unified, perceiving and aware, yet constantly undeluded. What distinguishes ordinary people from sages is that their true and numinous knowing are separated, perceiving and aware, yet unable to remain undeluded.

For the human heart harbors the consciousness-spirit, which borrows numinosity to generate delusion, responding to appearances with emotion and riding the winds to stir waves. Numinosity returns to falsity, and the human heart becomes perilous. When the human heart is perilous, deviant qi flourishes while upright qi weakens; the Dao-heart is not manifest, and the Dao-heart becomes faint. In cultivating the Dao, one refines the hardness of the Dao-heart’s true knowing to return it to central correctness...

To temper the human heart’s numinous knowing in its softness and return it to central correctness is to unite hardness and softness, balance vigor and compliance, be utterly refined and singular, and hold fast to the center. Here, innate knowing and innate ability merge with Heavenly Principle, and a single qi flows unimpeded. How could the Golden Elixir fail to arise? The Golden Elixir is formed by the coagulation of the two qi of hardness and softness; when true knowing and numinous knowing return to central correctness, Heaven and human merge as one, like a single precious pearl suspended in emptiness, illuminating all without exception. The Golden Elixir has form, growing from the subtle to the manifest, from raw to ripe—how could one not attain liberation?

**Second Stanza**
*Setting the furnace and establishing the crucible, emulating Qian and Kun,*
*Tempering essence to refine the po and hun.*
*Gathering and dispersing, misty and swirling, transforming without cease—*
*Who dares treat the profound and wondrous as commonplace?*

The furnace serves to circulate fire, the crucible to temper the medicine. In the Dao of the Golden Elixir, one models the furnace after Kun’s soft compliance, advancing step by step; one patterns the crucible after Qian’s firm vigor, applying fierce fire and urgent refinement. Able to be hard, able to be soft; able to be vigorous, able to be compliant—with resolve and thought unwavering, the longer the effort, the greater the strength. When the crucible and furnace are stable, unmoving and unshaken, one may then gather the medicine and circulate the fire.

The human heart’s numinous knowing is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, like the essence of the sun, its radiance shining outward. The Dao-heart’s true knowing is like the splendor of the moon, its brilliance concealed within. Numinous knowing, outwardly yang, pertains to the hun; true knowing, outwardly yin, pertains to the po. Numinous knowing and essence-hun are what is called "spiritual and yet spiritual"; true knowing and splendor-po are what is called "not spiritual and yet spiritual." "Spiritual and yet spiritual" contains falsity within; "not spiritual and yet spiritual" holds truth within falsity. To temper essence is to burn away the falsity within the human heart’s numinous knowing and refine the truth within the Dao-heart’s falsity. When false numinosity departs and true numinosity settles, the hun does not fly and is thus mastered; when true knowing appears and false knowing vanishes, the po does not scatter and is thus mastered. Once hun and po are mastered, true knowing and numinous knowing, emotion and nature, converge as one, congealing into a single qi. Misty and harmonious, gathering and dispersing, transforming without end—serene and unmoving, yet responsive and immediately penetrating—every step and movement is Heaven’s mechanism. The wondrousness herein cannot be captured in words.

**Two Poems on the Crescent-Moon Furnace**

**Third**
Do not cling to alchemical hearths and waste effort—
To refine the medicine, seek the crescent-moon furnace.
It possesses a natural, true firing time—
No need for firewood, charcoal, or fanning breath.

The crescent moon appears on the third day of each month, its sliver of light emerging in the Kun direction, its glow upturned—hence the name. In the human, within utmost stillness, a single point of yang light breaks through, resembling the crescent moon. In the hexagrams, this is Zhen, as in the saying: *"On the third day, Zhen issues forth Geng; by the winding riverbank, the moon’s splendor gleams."* This point of yang light is nothing other than the light of the Dao-heart. What is hardest to attain in the Dao of the Elixir is the Dao-heart. Once the Dao-heart appears, Heavenly Principle shines forth, the qi of firmness gradually revives, and mountains, rivers, and the great earth—all become spiritual medicine. Grasped at will, every touch is the Dao. The medicine is the fire, the fire is the medicine; it possesses a natural alchemical furnace and true fire—why labor over hearths, firewood, charcoal, or fanning breath?

**Fourth**
In the crescent-moon furnace, jade buds sprout;
In the cinnabar crucible, mercury lies level.
Only after the fire’s power is harmonized
Does the yellow sprout gradually grow.

The crescent-moon furnace is what was earlier called the Dao-heart. The jade bud: jade is a gentle substance, belonging to yin; the bud is a luminous substance, belonging to yang. The jade bud is yang within yin, an analogy for the Dao-heart’s true knowing. The cinnabar crucible is the human heart. Mercury is a fluid, unstable substance, belonging to yin—yang within yin, an analogy for the human heart’s numinous knowing. When the Dao-heart is ever-present and true knowing undimmed, the human heart’s numinous knowing naturally calms, unable to soar. Applying the work of harmonization, one uses the true fire inherent in the Dao-heart to burn away the false numinosity within the human heart, returning it to empty numinosity.

When heaven and humanity unite in emanation, true knowing and numinous knowing become as one. When knowing reaches its fullness and intention becomes sincere, this is called the "yellow sprout." The yellow sprout is the seed of true numinosity, which, nurtured by the warmth of earth, emerges like grass from the soil—first as a sprout of yellow hue, hence the name "yellow sprout." After the fire’s power harmonizes true knowing and numinous knowing, they return to central equilibrium, entering the upper crucible of the central palace. Applying the work of nurturing with true intention, after ten months when qi is full, it naturally ripens and transforms.

Speaking of true lead, four verses begin:

**Five**
Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi—this is human practice,
Yet only with the proper substance can creation arise.
If the crucible lacks the true seed,
One merely boils an empty cauldron with water and fire.

The Dao-heart’s true knowing possesses the primordial true unity of qi, symbolized as lead—the true seed for becoming a sage, worthy, buddha, or immortal. If one wishes to refine the great elixir, apart from this true seed, there is nothing else. Yet deluded fools of the world, practicing only upon their bodily forms and tangible substances—swallowing saliva and absorbing qi, believing themselves to cultivate the Dao—do not realize that what the body produces are merely postcelestial dregs. How can these give birth to the primordial, most numinous and sagely elixir? This is like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire, for the crucible holds no true seed.

**Six**
To harmonize lead and mercury and form the elixir,
Neither great nor small is harmed, and both realms remain whole.
If you ask what true lead is,
The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river.

The golden elixir is formed from the Dao-heart’s true knowing as true lead and the human heart’s numinous knowing as true mercury. To refine the golden elixir, first harmonize lead and mercury. The Dao-heart is firm, belonging to yang, and is great; the human heart is gentle, belonging to yin, and is small. Without the Dao-heart, the human heart borrows its numinosity to generate delusion and obstruct the Dao. Yet if the Dao-heart governs it, numinous clarity remains undimmed and can assist the Dao. The Dao-heart cannot be lacking, nor can the human heart be extinguished—only its false numinosity must not be misused. The ancients taught "putting the human heart to death," meaning to extinguish its false numinosity, not its true numinosity. If one fails to distinguish true from false and extinguishes all, one falls into the study of dull emptiness and annihilation. Harming the small harms the great; with yin and yang isolated, how can the vital breath of life-force give rise to the great Dao of the golden elixir? Thus it is said: neither great nor small is harmed, and both realms remain whole. When both realms are whole, the human heart’s numinous knowing and the Dao-heart’s true knowing merge as one—true knowing governs numinous knowing, and numinous knowing submits to true knowing. True and numinous knowing remain undispersed, returning to innate knowing and innate ability, wholly embodying heaven’s principle, perfectly illuminating original nature, and the golden elixir is complete.

For true knowing and numinous knowing are the totality of innate knowing and innate ability. In the primordial, they are called innate knowing and innate ability; in the acquired, they are called true knowing and numinous knowing. When the acquired returns to the primordial, true knowing is innate knowing, and numinous knowing is innate ability. True knowing and numinous knowing are originally one family, no different. Yet upon entering the acquired, a speck of heaven’s true purity in innate knowing becomes lost externally, possessed by another household. The numinous ability remaining in one’s own household becomes impure and unstable. To return to the root and restore the origin, one must seek the whereabouts of the true within false knowing and guide it back to one’s own household, so that numinous knowing remains undimmed. This true knowing is the most firm and vigorous substance, hence symbolized as true lead. True knowing possesses the primordial true unity of qi, also symbolized as gold within water and as moonlight. Gold within water and moonlight both signify yang within yin. Yet this true knowing, before being restored, still belongs to another household and is not one’s own, hence the saying: "The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river." The moon contains a golden toad, and the toad’s light is the moon’s light—an analogy for true knowing’s outer darkness and inner brightness. Shining all day upon the west and not the east clearly means its radiance lies there. The immortal’s later verse says: "The Metal Lord was originally the eastern householder’s child, sent to the western neighbor to lodge and grow." This precisely captures the meaning of "the toad’s light shines all day upon the western river." If the practitioner can truly recognize that the toad’s light shines all day upon the western river—knowing the whereabouts of true knowing—then it can shine eastward and meet with numinous knowing. Alas! Going with the flow brings death; reversing it brings life. Often, one is taught to seek yet cannot find—how easily can true knowing be known?

**Seven**
Before refining the returned elixir, do not enter the mountains,
For within and without the mountains, there is no lead.
This supreme treasure exists in every household,
Yet fools fail to recognize it fully.

Withdrawing from the world and leaving the dust to dwell in the mountains and nurture stillness are matters for after the elixir’s return. Those who do not understand enter the mountains to nurture stillness, believing this can bring longevity. Yet the way of longevity requires obtaining the single flavor of true lead to be effective. But true lead must be sought within the dusty world. If one enters the mountains to cultivate the Dao, within and without the mountains are entirely yin qi—where can one find the true lead of utmost yang? True lead is the primordial numinous root, also called the heavenly root, the true unity’s essence, the true unity’s qi, the lead of the watery realm, gold within water, white within black, the hun within the po, the black tiger, the Metal Lord, and the other household’s elixir of immortality. The ancients employed many symbols, but in essence, they all describe the single substance of the Dao-heart. This Dao-heart, when active, manifests as the wondrous existence of true knowing; when concealed, it is the true emptiness of the unified essence. It is possessed by all, perfectly complete in each—neither increased in sages nor diminished in commoners—existing in every household.

Yet though it exists in every household, it is not possessed by one’s own household—this is because what is seen cannot be used, and what is used cannot be seen. Precisely because it exists in every household yet is not one’s own, fools encounter it without recognition, passing it by even when face to face. In the late Ming, Peng Haogu, failing to grasp this principle, took the phrase "existing in every household" as a direct reference to the "female crucible," while in recent times, Zhiji Zi has annotated it with the Three Peaks’ art of bedchamber warfare. Such benighted delusions mislead later learners—no greater transgression exists!

**VIII.**
When bamboo splits, bamboo must be used to mend it;
To hatch a chick, an egg must serve the task.
All else is but vain labor, disparate kind—
How could it match true lead uniting with the sage’s mechanism?

When bamboo splits, bamboo repairs it; when hatching a chick, an egg is used—this is seeking by kind. *The Three Kinds* states: "Of like kind, effort is easily applied; of unlike kind, skill is hard to achieve." If not of its kind, it is not the true seed—all exertion is but vain labor. Thus, the great Way of the golden elixir is the sage’s affair. To learn from the sage, one must seek the sage’s seed, which is the true knowing of true lead. Cultivating the great Way with this true knowing, none will fail to unite with the sage’s mechanism. The sage’s mechanism is nothing other than the undifferentiated heavenly principle—true knowing without a single thing unknown, without a single thing untrue, able to restore the heavenly principle. Hence it is called "uniting with the sage’s mechanism." Once united with the sage’s mechanism, one is a sage—why then do learners refuse to humble their hearts?

**On the Use of Lead**
**IX.**
Empty the heart and fill the belly—both meanings run deep,
Yet emptying the heart first requires knowing the heart.
Better to refine lead and fill the belly first,
Then gather gold to fill the hall.

The Way of the golden elixir involves emptying the heart and filling the belly—two distinct endeavors. To empty the heart is to empty the human heart, the work of cultivating nature; to fill the belly is to fill the Dao-heart, the work of cultivating life. These two—emptying the heart and filling the belly—are the unfolding of nature and life, each bearing profound meaning. If one wishes to empty the heart, one must first know the heart. For the heart has two aspects: the human heart and the Dao-heart. The human heart should be empty, not full; the Dao-heart should be full, not empty. If one fails to distinguish the true and false, right and wrong of the heart, emptying it indiscriminately, one will not only fail to complete life but also fail to complete nature. If one knows the heart, there is no need to empty the human heart first—one must refine the Dao-heart of true lead to fill the belly. When the belly is full, righteousness gathers and arises, guest qi naturally dissipates, and the human heart empties of itself. The four images harmonize, the five phases converge, gold and jade fill the hall, the treasure of life is in hand—then one may empty the human heart to nourish the Dao-heart, completing the lineage of nature and returning to the realm of nothing-whatsoever.

**On Not Using Lead**
**X.**

**On Using Lead**

One must not use common lead; having used true lead, one must also discard it. This is the true esoteric principle of using lead—"using lead without using it" is no empty word.

The method of refining the elixir depends solely on gathering true lead as its essential step. Yet lead is not all the same: there is common lead, and there is true lead. Common lead is that which is mined from mountains, a turbid substance of form, without affinity to the self. True lead is stored within the garden of the household, the formless Dao-heart, of the same kind as the self. Since ancient times, those immortals who have transcended the mundane to enter sagehood have all relied on the power of this true lead, the Dao-heart—hence the saying, "One must not use common lead."

Yet though the Dao-heart is a primordial treasure, it arises from the postnatal realm. There is a time for its use, and a time when it must not be used. Before the elixir coalesces, one must rely on the true knowing of the Dao-heart to restrain the numinous knowing of the human heart. Once the human heart is settled and its numinous knowing unobscured, Dao-heart and human heart move and rest as one; true knowing and numinous knowing respond in emptiness and fullness. When the sacred embryo has formed, one must swiftly withdraw the hardness of the Dao-heart to gently nurture the fetal breath.

The purpose of employing the Dao-heart is to restrain the human heart. Once the human heart is stilled and the consciousness of the senses extinguished, innate knowing and innate capacity remain quiescent and unmoving. Yet when stirred, they respond with perfect clarity; the true spirit abides alone, luminous and undimmed. The Dao-heart is no longer needed, and one may stand where being and nonbeing are both negated, where self and other dissolve entirely into emptiness.

Lu Ziye said: "The method of using lead is like the trap and snare for catching fish and hare." Fish and hare are obtained by means of the trap and snare, but once obtained, trap and snare are of no further use. The esoteric principle of using lead lies precisely here. If one does not grasp the secret of using lead and, after the elixir has formed, still clings to the Dao-heart, one will inevitably employ the Dao-heart only to rouse the human heart again. The true spirit scatters once more, and the golden elixir, though gained, is lost again—hence the saying, "Having used true lead, one must also discard it." The secret of "using lead without using it" may be understood from this.

**On Lead and Mercury**
**XI**

In a dream I ascended to the Nine Heavens, where I met the Western Flower;
A true immortal bestowed upon me the *Finger-Pointing to the Origin*.
Its words were few and simple,
Teaching only the refinement of mercury and lead.

The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is utterly simple and easy,
Requiring no verbose instruction—
It is nothing more than refining the true knowing within the Dao-heart
And the numinous knowing within the human heart.
When the Dao-heart is firm and vigorous, returning to central equilibrium,
The Dao-heart abides constantly.
Using true knowing to govern numinous knowing,
When the human heart is yielding and compliant, returning to central equilibrium,
The human heart remains ever still.
When firmness and softness correspond, true and numinous knowing unite—
This is called the mutual embrace of lead and mercury,
The coagulation of the Golden Elixir.
Its method is most simple and easy, concise and unburdensome;
Even an ordinary person, upon attaining it, ascends at once to sagehood.
Yet most lack great virtue and great fortune,
And thus rarely obtain it.
If one possesses great virtue and great fortune,
And encounters a true immortal who reveals this simple and wondrous method,
It is like awakening from a dream—
Only then does one realize the Great Medicine lies within oneself,
Not to be sought elsewhere.
With a mere grasp and application, all desires are fulfilled.
The immortal elder’s dream of meeting the Western Flower and receiving instruction
Carries profound meaning—it is no mere allegory.
The Western Flower is the place where true gold is produced;
"Flower" signifies the radiant essence of true gold.
The Nine Heavens are the realm of pure yang, devoid of yin.
True gold is the symbolic form of true knowing.
Within darkness, the sudden appearance of the yang light of true knowing—
Seizing this true knowing and returning it to one’s own abode,
Uniting it with numinous knowing,
And refining it with fire until it reaches the state of pure yang without yin,
Is called the "Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions,"
The Great Elixir of Golden Liquor—
How could this truly be a dream?

**On the Single Qi of Emptiness and Nothingness**
**XII**

The Dao arises from emptiness and nothingness, giving birth to the single qi;
From this single qi, yin and yang emerge.
Yin and yang unite again to form the Three Bodies,
And from the Three Bodies, the myriad things unfold.
The Dao of nature and life,
The Dao of creation—
The Dao of ceaseless generation.
Tracing its source,
It originates from the single qi within emptiness and nothingness;
From this single qi, heaven and earth arise, producing yin and yang.
Yin and yang unite once more, containing within them the single qi to form the Three Bodies.
Once the Three Bodies are complete, the single qi moves—
Now yin, now yang—
And thus the myriad things are born.
Take, for example, the growth of plants:
First, a sprout emerges from the earth—
This is the single qi born from emptiness and nothingness.
Then it breaks the soil, opening into two leaves—
This is yin and yang produced from the single qi.
Next, a stem rises between the two leaves—
This is the Three Bodies formed from the union of yin and yang.
From this, branches and leaves proliferate—
This is the myriad things unfolding from the Three Bodies.
All things in heaven and earth, whether sentient or insentient,
Arise from this single qi of emptiness and nothingness,
Yet all follow the forward course of creation.
If the cultivator of the Dao understands this forward course of creation
And reverses it in practice—
Returning the myriad to the Three,
The Three to the Two,
The Two to the One,
And the One to emptiness and nothingness—
Then the state of utter silence and formlessness is attained.

**On Kan and Li**
**XIII**

**On Kan and Li**

**XIII**

The lightning of Kan roils and boils the crucible of metal and water,
Fire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.
If these two substances harmonize and unite,
The elixir ripens naturally, its fragrance suffusing the body.

The lightning of Kan is the image of fire arising within water,
Comparable to the true knowing of the Dao-mind,
Emerging in the deepest darkness—
Where it appears is precisely the living *zi* hour within this body.

"Roiling and boiling" is the image of the indistinct and unfixed.
The "crucible of metal and water" refers to the true knowing of the Dao-mind,
The genuine feeling of *jingyi*,
Possessing the dual qi of metal and water.

Kunlun lies in the West, the ancestral vein of all mountains,
The place where true metal is produced.
When the true knowing of the Dao-mind flashes forth in the deepest darkness,
Like lightning’s sudden gleam—now bright, now dim, indistinct and fleeting—
Swiftly employ the empty, numinous fire of Li to receive it,
Then true knowing and numinous knowing, nature and feeling, long for one another,
Yin and yang unite.
From this union, the primordial spiritual medicine is born.
Again, the natural true fire is set in motion,
Forging away the turbid qi of later heaven,
Smelting the ore until the metal is pure.
The golden elixir matures—
Swallowed and ingested, it transforms bone and flesh,
Revealing the pure Dharma-body.
Then fragrant winds fill the dusty world—
How could it be merely the body that is suffused with fragrance?

**On Wu and Ji**

**XIV**

If Li and Kan yet lack Wu and Ji,
Though they contain the Four Images, no elixir forms.
Only because each holds true earth,
Does the golden elixir gain its return.

Kan is water, in man it is primordial essence,
Issuing forth as wisdom;
Within water gold is concealed, in man it is true feeling,
Issuing forth as righteousness.
Li is fire, in man it is primordial spirit,
Issuing forth as propriety;
Fire is born of wood, in man it is primordial nature,
Issuing forth as benevolence.

The Dao-mind bears the image of Kan,
The human mind bears the image of Li.
Dao-mind and human mind together possess
The four natures of metal, wood, water, and fire.
Yet these four natures stand apart—
Should they wish to generate one another in a single qi,
They rely wholly on the work of Wu and Ji.

Wu is yang earth, primordial qi,
Issuing forth as trust;
Ji is yin earth, intention,
Issuing forth as desire.
Kan receives Wu, in the Dao-mind it is trust;
Li receives Ji, in the human mind it is intention.

To rectify the mind, first make intention sincere.
When intention is sincere, Ji earth settles and the human mind is still;
To practice the Way, first establish trust.
When trust is established, Wu earth appears and the Dao-mind is manifest.

If the Dao-mind lacks trust,
And the human mind is not sincere,
Though benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom exist,
Each turns away from the others.
The natures, feelings, and spirits they contain
All stand in opposition—
How then could they congeal the most numinous and sagely divine elixir?

Thus, those who cultivate the Dao
Must take sincerity of intention and establishment of trust as their foundation.
When intention is sincere and trust is established,
The Dao-mind is manifest and the human mind is rectified.
Each harmonizes with the other,
Yin and yang respond,
And the primordial qi,
Arising from emptiness and nothingness,
Coagulates into a single grain of millet-pearl.
The scattered gathers once more,
The departed returns again—
Thus it is said: *Only because each holds true earth,
Does the golden elixir gain its return.*
Great indeed is the work of Wu and Ji.

**On the Inversion of Kan and Li**

**XV**

The sun dwelling in the Li position inverts to become the woman,
The Kan matched with the Toad Palace becomes the man instead.
If one does not grasp this inversion of meaning within,
Do not presume to discourse loftily on matters with narrow insight.

The sun dwelling in the Li position (in one version, "Li dwelling in the sun’s position")—
Spirit-awareness is originally yang,
Yet outwardly bright and inwardly dark,
Ever inviting guest qi.
Like the sun dwelling in the Li position,
Outwardly yang and inwardly yin,
It inverts to become the woman.
True awareness is originally yin,
Yet outwardly dark and inwardly bright,
Possessing the upright qi.
Like Kan matched with the Toad Palace,
Outwardly yin and inwardly yang,
It becomes the man instead.
The postnatal human mind,
Borrowing spirit to generate delusion,
Buries the celestial authenticity of the Dao-mind—
Just as the woman takes charge of the household,
And the man retreats from his position.
The way of elixir refinement
Is to use the true awareness of the Dao-mind
To govern the spirit-awareness of the human mind,
And to have the spirit-awareness of the human mind
Comply with the true awareness of the Dao-mind.
The man is firm, the woman is yielding;
The man presides, the woman obeys—
In great work, there is none that does not succeed.
If one does not grasp this inversion of meaning within,
It is to fail to recognize the true awareness of the Dao-mind,
To fail to recognize the spirit-awareness of the human mind.
All is chaos and confusion,
All takes the false for the true.
Do not presume to discourse loftily with narrow insight,
Thereby deceiving both self and others.

**XVI**

Extract the solid core within Kan’s heart,
And transmute the yin within Li’s belly.
From this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,
Where concealment and soaring are all at the heart’s command.

All at the heart’s command (in one version, "all under the heart’s command"; in another, "ever at the heart’s command")—
The solid core within Kan’s heart
Is the true awareness of the Dao-mind.
The yin within Li’s belly
Is the spirit-awareness of the human mind.
Extract the true awareness of the Dao-mind from Kan’s depths,
And transmute the spirit-awareness of the human mind within Li’s palace.
In a single instant,
Yin qi dissipates and yang qi returns,
Restoring the original face of Qian’s primal origin,
Returning to me the original nature of innate knowledge and ability.
Still and unmoving, it responds and thus communicates;
Responding and thus communicating, it remains still and unmoving.
Thus it is said: from this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,
Where concealment and soaring are all at the heart’s command.
This body is not the illusory form of the physical frame,
But the true body of the Dharma-body.
The Dharma-body is the original nature.
At the beginning of human life,
A single spark of true numinous nature,
Round and luminous, unwavering,
Firm and strong, upright and balanced,
Pure and without the slightest impurity—
Like the Qian hexagram’s three yang lines,
A symbol of pure yang without yin.
Upon entering the postnatal realm,
Heavenly integrity becomes obscured,
Numinous qi becomes false—
Like Qian’s central void becoming Li,
And Kun’s central solidity becoming Kan.
The central void means the true has departed;
The central solidity means the true has sunk into Kan.
To "extract Kan and fill Li"
Is to return to celestial authenticity,
Restoring the original true numinous nature of that year,
As if sealing Li and reverting to the Qian hexagram.
Once the true numen is restored,
Mastery is in hand,
Constantly responsive, constantly pure.
Left or right, all is fitting—
Concealment and soaring,
How could they not be entirely at the heart’s command?
Later generations,
Not comprehending this principle,
Take "extracting Kan and filling Li"
To mean drawing qi from the kidneys to merge with the heart.
Others speak of ascending the kidney qi,
Then descending it to settle in the Crimson Palace.
Alas! There is something strange indeed—
Heart and kidneys were never Kan and Li.
To take Kan and Li as heart and kidneys
Is the height of folly.

**On the Five Phases:**

**XVII**

The thunder dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li homeland,
The marsh tiger’s lead is born in the Kan direction.
These two things are all because the child gives birth to the mother,
The five phases must all enter the center.

Emerges from (in one version, "emerges from within")—
Zhen is the dragon, the wood-mercury;
Dui is the tiger, the metal-lead.
Li is fire, Kan is water.
The dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li homeland—
Wood emerges from fire.
The tiger’s lead is born in the Kan direction—
Metal is born from water.
The root born from fire
Becomes everlasting, indestructible wood;
The metal born from water
Becomes everlasting, incorruptible metal.
Wood originally gives birth to fire,
Yet fire in turn gives birth to wood.
Metal originally gives birth to water,
Yet water in turn gives birth to metal—
This is called "the child giving birth to the mother."
The ancient classics say:
"The five phases do not proceed in order;
The dragon emerges from within fire.
The five phases move in inversion;
The tiger is born from within water."
This is precisely the meaning.
Human qi and temperament are easily stirred,
Like the floating nature of wood-mercury.
If refined with the fire of original spirit,
Dross is burned away,
Qi-nature is transformed and true nature appears,
Becoming an eternally unchanging nature.
Human delusive passions are profoundly heavy,
Like the sinking nature of metal-lead.
If washed clean of dust and grime with the water of essence-oneness,
Delusive passions dissipate and true passions congeal,
Becoming an eternally passionless state.
Not only this—
When temperament is transformed, there is no nature-fire;
When the consciousness of the acquired mind is extinguished, original spirit is ever-born.
When desires dissipate, there are no lustful thoughts;
Turbid essence is transformed, and original essence is without leakage.
True nature appears, true passions congeal,
Original spirit is born, original essence is secured.
Nature, passions, spirit, and essence
Return to a single qi.
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom
Return to a single trust.
This is called "the five phases complete."
When the five phases are complete,
They merge into a single center—
This is called "the five phases enter the center."
The five phases enter the center,
Neither inclined nor biased,
Yin and yang unite—
This is called "the golden elixir coagulates."
If one loses the east, neglects the west,
Abandons the south, or forgets the north,
Seeking other ingredients,
Then refining the golden elixir will be difficult.
The crucial point in the verse
Is the line: "The five phases must all enter the center."
If the five phases do not enter the center,
The five phases scatter, and the golden elixir does not coagulate.
If the five phases enter the center,
The five phases become one qi, and the golden elixir forms of itself.
How can scholars not first clarify the five phases?

**On the Two Bowstrings:**

**XVIII**

When the moon first shows half its wheel bright in the sky,
The dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar arise early.
This is the time to refine the two eights—
Within a single double-hour, the elixir is assured.

The golden elixir is the dragon’s nature and the tiger’s essence,
Formed by the union of the two bowstrings’ qi.
First take eight ounces of metal from the upper bowstring
To serve as the elixir’s mother;
Then take half a catty of wood from the lower bowstring
To coalesce the sacred embryo.

What are the two bowstrings?
From the third day of the lunar month, when the first yang arises,
To the eighth day, when yang reaches half within yin—
Its levelness like a taut string, resembling a drawn bow—
This is called the *upper bowstring*, for its yang light is above.
On the fifteenth day, the moon is full;
By the sixteenth, the first yin is conceived;
On the eighteenth, the first yin appears;
By the twenty-third, yin reaches half within yang—
Its levelness like a taut string, resembling a drawn bow—
This is called the *lower bowstring*, for its yang light is below.

The moon’s yang light, born from the west, is the tiger,
Belonging to metal, which resides in the west—
Thus the moon on the eighth day is called the tiger’s bowstring qi.
The moon’s yin body, emerging from the east, is the dragon,
Belonging to water, while wood resides in the east—
Thus the moon on the twenty-third day is called the dragon’s bowstring qi.

True knowing is of firm essence, like the tiger,
Resembling the moon’s yang light;
Spiritual knowing is of yielding nature, like the dragon,
Resembling the moon’s yin body.
When true knowing’s firm essence advances to central equilibrium,
It is like the yang light emerging at the upper bowstring—
Eight ounces of metal.
When spiritual knowing’s yielding nature retreats to central equilibrium,
It is like the yin body receding at the lower bowstring—
Eight ounces of wood.

When the moon first shows half its wheel bright in the sky,
It is precisely when true knowing’s firm essence advances to central equilibrium.
As true knowing advances to central equilibrium, yielding contains firmness,
And spiritual knowing, restrained by true knowing, can no longer soar unchecked.
Yang governs yin, and yin submits to yang—
Thus the dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar respond in unison,
Seeking one another as like attracts like.
At this moment, it is most fitting to devote effort to cultivation,
Borrowing yang to aid yin,
Guiding spiritual knowing’s yielding nature to return to central equilibrium.
When spiritual knowing returns to central equilibrium, firmness contains yielding,
And both true knowing and spiritual knowing attain central equilibrium.
The qi of the two eights’ bowstrings is now complete in measure,
Yin and yang in balance,
Firmness and yielding as one—
Within a single double-hour, the elixir is assured.

Yet if the two eights’ measure is not complete—
Whether yang is in excess and yin deficient,
Or yang deficient and yin in excess—
The elixir cannot form.
Only when yin and yang are in perfect balance,
Neither inclined nor biased—this is called *the center*—
Can the elixir be assured within a single double-hour.
How easily is this hour’s work accomplished?
Without decades of unrelenting effort,
One cannot suddenly reach this realm.

On Harmonization:

Nineteen
The male tiger roars on Huayue’s rocky peaks,
The female dragon hums in Fusang’s sea-deep lair.
The Yellow Matron herself knows how to matchmake,
Sending them as husband and wife with a single heart.

Huayue lies in the west, Fusang in the east.
The tiger embodies the metal disposition,
The dragon the wood nature.
At the dawn of life, their natures were originally united.
Metal and wood conjoined—
Yet once they enter the postnatal realm,
The false arrives and the true is obscured,
Nature and disposition split asunder,
Like the dragon in the east and the tiger in the west.

The tiger is called male for its metal disposition’s firmness,
The dragon female for its wood nature’s yielding.
Though true disposition is sundered by the false,
And true nature veiled by the false abode,
True disposition and true nature never cease longing to unite.
The male tiger roars on the mountain’s crest,
The female dragon hums in the sea’s depths—
A sign of yin and yang’s hidden communion despite obstruction.
Obstructed yet secretly communicating,
They could meet,
But lack the harmonizing agent,
And so cannot unite.

The Yellow Matron—
Also called true earth,
Also called true intent,
Also called its trust.
When true trust appears,
Intent becomes sincere and the heart upright,
The false departs and the true returns.
Disposition returns to nature,
And in an instant, nature and disposition unite,
As a matchmaker conveys messages between two households,
Sending them as husband and wife with a single heart.

Twenty
The red dragon and black tiger, each to west and east,
The four images intersect at wu-ji’s center.

From here, *Fu* and *Gou* can be set in motion—
Who would say the golden elixir cannot be achieved?

Wood can generate fire, fire and wood are one family—
Thus called the red dragon.
Metal can generate water, metal and water are one family—
Thus called the black tiger.
Metal, wood, water, and fire form the four images;
*Wu* and *ji* are earth.
Earth can harmonize the four images,
And the four images, joined with earth, become the five phases.
Yet when the five phases flow in sequence,
They are the fiery pit of the dharma-realm;
When the five phases are inverted,
They become the seven treasures of the great earth—
All depends on how one applies them.

When the feeling of the Dao-heart’s true knowing stirs,
This is called *Fu*—the method then is to advance the yang fire to forge the elixir.
When the nature of the human heart’s numinous knowing is still,
This is called *Gou*—the method then is to withdraw the yin tally to nurture warmth.
When it is time to employ yang, employ yang;
When it is time to employ yin, employ yin.
Yang is firm, yin is yielding—
Use nine, use six,
Each following its season.
True knowing and numinous knowing,
Two yet one,
Enter the center.
The five phases gather,
The golden elixir is accomplished—
Naturally, of itself.

Speaking of dragon and tiger:
Twenty-One

The White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wildly,
The Azure Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.
Seize them with both hands and force them into mortal combat—
They transform into a lump of purple-golden frost.

(In one version: *two beasts*)
The true knowing of feeling and the numinous knowing of nature,
Though originally of the primordial,
Once fallen into the later heaven,
Are intermingled with principle and desire,
Blending the real and the false.
Long separated, they cannot suddenly be tamed and brought to face one another—
Thus it is said: *The White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wildly,
The Azure Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.*

Yet the Dao of the golden elixir possesses the method of
*Borrowing the false to cultivate the real,
Using the real to transform the false.*
Follow their desires step by step,
Gradually guiding them.
Apply unrelenting effort—
What was not united must unite,
What was not harmonized must harmonize.
The longer the work, the greater the force:
Deluded feelings naturally depart,
True feelings naturally arise;
Qi and temperament naturally dissolve,
True feelings naturally manifest.
The false is forever extinguished,
The real abides eternally.
Feeling without feeling—this is true feeling;
Nature without nature—this is true nature.
True feeling and true nature,
Two yet one,
The heart dies, the spirit lives,
Unknowing, unperceiving,
Following the emperor’s rule—
They transform into a lump of purple-golden frost.

Gold is the unyielding, indestructible substance.
When gold becomes purple,
It emerges from the great furnace,
Refined to full purity.
Purple gold transformed into frost—
Form and substance both vanish,
Merged into a single qi,
Transcending yin and yang.

Speaking of refining the self, three verses:
Twenty-Two

First observe the heavens to discern the Five Thieves,
Then examine the earth to pacify the people.
Only when the people are at peace and the nation prosperous may war be waged;
Only after war’s end may the sage be revealed.

To observe the heavens is to observe one’s own celestial nature;
To discern the Five Thieves is to understand the mutual conquest of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.
To examine the earth is to examine the ground of one’s own heart-mind;
To pacify the people is to settle the spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intention, each in its proper place.

In the Dao of refining the elixir, nothing precedes the refinement of the self;
The essence of refining the self begins with observing celestial nature.
When celestial nature is unobscured, the Five Thieves cannot deceive.
Next, examine the ground of the heart-mind;
When the heart-mind is pure and still, the Five Agents are all at peace.
When the Five Agents are at peace, essence is firm and spirit whole, the ethereal soul stabilized and the corporeal soul serene.
Sincerity of intention is called national prosperity—
Thereupon, wage war against the Five Thieves and repel the host of yin.
Yin qi transforms into yang qi,
The mechanism of death shifts to the mechanism of life—
Only then may the sage be seen.

The sage is the original face of innate knowing and innate ability,
Also called the sacred embryo.
When the Five Thieves are subdued, they transform into the Five Primes,
Manifesting as the Five Powers.
Abiding in quiescence, yet responsive to all things—
Unknowing, unperceiving,
Following the emperor’s rule—
Is this not the sacred embryo?

The character for "war" in the verse carries profound meaning:
The Five Thieves dwell in the heart and act upon heaven.
Without the great dharmic power to contend with heaven, they cannot be subdued.
War is precisely the means to rouse great function, unleash great mechanism,
Advance with valor and vigor,
Growing ever stronger with time—
Never allowing retreat halfway.

An ancient immortal said:
*"A single thread of yang qi unexhausted, one does not die;
A single thread of yin qi unexhausted, one does not ascend as an immortal."*
Refinement of the self must continue until not a trace of yin qi remains,
The Five Phases merge and transform,
The ore is spent and the gold pure—
Only then is it complete.

Twenty-Three
To employ generals, first divide the left and right armies;
Let them take the lead while I remain the guest.

Advise you, when facing battle, not to underestimate the foe—
Lest you lose our priceless treasure of the house.
The Dao of refining the self cannot succeed all at once;
One must follow its desires and guide it step by step.
For the true numinous aperture has been sealed for so long,
Deep-rooted habits have settled in,
The Five Thieves wreak havoc—
Not a matter of a single morning or evening, most difficult to eradicate.

To employ generals, first divide the left and right armies,
Let them take the lead while I remain the guest—
This means: to take, one must first give.
Advise you, when facing battle, not to underestimate the foe—
Lest you lose what is yours while seeking from others.
Within, guard against danger and contemplate peril;
Without, diligently temper and refine.
Then the false may be cast off, the true preserved—
What worry then that the great Dao will not be achieved?

Twenty-Four
Fire is born of wood, its edge concealed within—
Without knowing how to drill and refine, do not force the attack.
Disaster arises from this, harming the self;
One must subdue it to seek the Metal Elder.

Since the postnatal takes charge,
The consciousness-spirit holds power.
The postnatal qi of the Five Phases within the body,
The afflictions of root and dust carried through kalpas,
And present defilements of habit—
All erupt at once.
Without great dharmic power, without great skill,
How can they all be subdued?
If one does not know the true principle of drilling and refining,
But rashly takes action,
Using mind to restrain mind,
Attacking too fiercely—
At times, sovereign fire and ministerial fire both flare,
Not only failing to subdue the thief,
But instead being overpowered by it.
Not only is there no benefit, but harm is done.
As fire is born of wood, disaster erupts and overcomes;
Wood is instead consumed by fire, wounding its own life.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
*"The flowing pearl of Great Yang ever seeks to leave man,
But once it obtains Metal’s radiance, it turns and follows it."*
Metal’s radiance is the Dao-mind.
The Dao-mind is not the mind of the heart,
But arises from the celestial true body,
Possessing the emotion of true knowing,
And the qi of upright strength—
No thing can deceive it.
When the luminous brilliance of the Dao-mind appears,
All evil retreats.
Its resolute decisiveness and firm judgment
Are as sharp as metal.
Thus, the Dao-mind is named the Metal Elder.
To drill and refine the true principle
Is to drill and refine the true principle of using metal to restrain wood.

For in the great elixir, the Metal Elder is the master.
If one abandons the Metal Elder to refine the self,
Disaster is merely courted.
Thus, Zhang Sanfeng said:
*"When refining the self, one must use true lead."*
True lead and the Metal Elder
Are both alternate names for the Dao-mind.

On the Metal Elder:
Twenty-Five

The Metal Elder is originally the son of the eastern household,
Sent to dwell in the western neighbor to be nurtured in borrowed form.
Once recognized and called home to be reared,
He is matched with the maiden of the house to forge marital bonds.
*(Alternate versions: "summoned home"; "to form marital bonds")*

The Metal Elder is none other than the true knowing of the Dao-mind spoken of before.
True knowing is true emotion.
In human life, nature and emotion are originally one family, undivided,
Spoken of as nature when referring to essence,
And as emotion when referring to function.
Emotion is nature; nature is emotion—
Same origin, different names, not two distinct things.
After entering the postnatal realm, nature and emotion shift and change,
True emotion dims while false emotion arises.
The qi of upright strength is obscured by guest qi,
No longer issuing from the self.
Like the son of the eastern household,
Now dwelling as a guest in the western neighbor.
Yet though he dwells in the western neighbor,
He is not forever beyond our sight—
We merely fail to recognize him when we see him.
If one is a person of true resolve, penetrating principle to its depths,
And recognizes the real when he sees it,
A single call brings him home,
Like an echo in an empty valley—effortless.
Further, if one can nurture him in the inner chamber,
Constantly guarding and sustaining him,
And match him with the true nature of the Maiden,
So that yin and yang become one qi,
And marital bonds are formed,
He is once more the possession of the eastern household.

The Maiden is the maiden within the house,
The nature of numinous knowing.
Nature is fundamentally yang, yet called "maiden"
Because nature governs softness, resembling wood—hence the Maiden.
Emotion is fundamentally yin, yet called "elder"
Because emotion governs firmness, resembling metal—hence the Metal Elder.
The Metal Elder, long gone abroad,
One day returns home
And meets the Maiden—
Their bond is exceptionally intimate,
And the elixir cannot but be born.
Thus the *Cantong qi* says:
*"When metal returns to its original nature,
Only then is it called the Returned Elixir."*
Metal and wood conjoined, emotion and nature united—
This is the Returned Elixir,
And there is no other Returned Elixir beyond this.

On the Maiden:
Twenty-Six

The Maiden roams with a method all her own—
Her forward path must be short, her return path long.
When she comes back, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,
And weds the Metal Elder as her old lord.

The Maiden is the numinous knowing of nature, as explained in the previous verse. Once she enters the postnatal realm, the mind of man harbors the consciousness-spirit, and the true inevitably mingles with the false. From the numinous arises delusion, and at the sight of fire she takes flight, wandering without constancy—this is what is meant by “coming and going without fixed time, no one knowing her homeland.”

To refine the Golden Elixir, one must first guide this single spark of numinous nature to roam in the directions it ought to go. Empty its numinosity without obscuring its numinosity, and the numinous will return to true numinosity. The forward path must be short: this is using nature to seek emotion. The return path must be long: this is using the numinous to nurture the true. Using nature to seek emotion is the marvel of forming the elixir in an instant—hence it is called short. Using the numinous to nurture the true is the work of ten months’ gentle cultivation—hence it is called long. Where it should be short, be short; where it should be long, be long—this is what is meant by “having a method all her own.” Follow this method in practice, and the Golden Elixir may be attained.

But first, one must dismiss cunning and destroy cleverness, turning the light around to reflect inward. Place this single spark of numinous nature in the central, correct position—this is what is meant by “coming back to enter the Yellow Dame’s abode.” The Yellow Dame’s abode is the dwelling of impartiality and centrality, neither leaning nor biased. When numinous nature is centered and correct, the heart is upright and the intent sincere; when the intent is sincere, trust in the true arises, and one no longer roams outside. Thus, using nature to seek emotion, emotion returns to nature, and nature and emotion yearn for each other, merging into a single qi—this is what is meant by “wedding the Metal Elder as her old lord.”

“Old lord” is no ordinary phrase—it carries profound meaning. In the Dao of elixir refinement, one first uses numinous nature to summon true emotion. When true emotion returns, numinous nature remains unshaken, and numinous nature itself naturally returns to the true. Then, one must use numinous nature to restrain true emotion, nurturing true emotion in a realm of pure yang without yin until the end. Like an old husband and an old wife, they grow old together, never allowing discord or a broken mirror along the way. This is precisely the meaning of “the return path must be long.” Scholars must delve deeply into this.

On Fire Times, Two Poems:

Twenty-Seven
Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the fire times, it is all in vain.
The whole depends on the power of cultivation—
A hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.

The Dao of the Returned Elixir relies solely on taking two medicinal substances, cinnabar and black lead, and forging them into a treasure to extend life and nature. Cinnabar is the single spark of empty numinous qi within *li*, that is, numinous knowing, belonging to the human heart. Black lead is the single spark of firm and upright qi within *kan*, that is, true knowing, belonging to the Dao-heart. Because the human heart’s numinous knowing is outwardly bright and inwardly dark, brightness pertains to fire, and fire is red—hence it is symbolized as cinnabar. Because the Dao-heart’s true knowing is outwardly dark and inwardly bright, darkness pertains to water, and water is black—hence it is symbolized as black lead. These are the cinnabar and lead without form or image, not the cinnabar and lead of the mundane world with form and image.

Once you recognize the cinnabar and lead of true knowing and numinous knowing, you can gather them at will without difficulty. However, gathering them requires forging them. If you know the medicine but not the method of forging it, it is no different from not knowing at all. Thus it is said: *Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire times, it is all in vain.* The Golden Elixir relies entirely on the fire times of cultivation to be accomplished. “Fire” is the power of cultivation, and “times” are the sequence of cultivation. When gathering the medicine, one must know its maturity; when forging the medicine, one must know the seasons. There are the fire times of gentle refinement, the fire times of fierce forging, the fire of initial application, the fire times of cessation and rest, the fire times of advancing yang, the fire times of retreating yin, the fire times of the Returned Elixir, the fire times of the Great Elixir, the fire times of increase and decrease, and the fire times of gentle nurturing. With so many fire times, one must achieve great awakening, knowing the beginning and the end, to succeed. If one errs by a hair’s breadth, the mistake spans a thousand miles, and forming the elixir becomes difficult.

Twenty-Eight
The契论 and scriptural songs expound the utmost truth,
Yet they do not set the fire times down in writing.
To know the oral secrets that penetrate the mysterious,
You must discuss them carefully with an immortal.

Since ancient times, the true immortals’ *契论* and scriptural songs have spoken of the medicine and fire times of cultivating the true in the most detailed and precise way, utterly genuine and without falsehood. Though they discuss them, the discussion does not reach the core; though they speak of them, the words do not exhaust the meaning. How could they not set the fire times down in writing? But the *契论* and scriptural songs are profoundly abstruse: sometimes they speak of nature, sometimes of life; sometimes of medicine, sometimes of fire; sometimes of the fire times of cultivating life, sometimes of the fire times of cultivating nature; sometimes of external fire times, sometimes of internal fire times. They do speak of fire times, but their words are scattered and disordered. Without encountering an enlightened teacher to organize the net and grasp the outline, to fold the clothes and lift the collar, one cannot understand.

Thus it is said: *they do not set the fire times down in writing.* And again: *You must discuss them carefully with an immortal.* This teaches one to study the *契论* and scriptural songs while also seeking an enlightened teacher for verification. One must not set aside the *契论* and scriptural songs to rely solely on a teacher, nor should one take the *契论* and scriptural songs as self-realization and neglect seeking a teacher. If the *契论* and scriptural songs contained no fire times, how could they be said to *expound the utmost truth*?

Generally speaking, the student must both read the *契论* and scriptural songs and seek an enlightened teacher. Reading the *契论* and scriptural songs allows one to distinguish the true from the false, the orthodox from the heterodox, and to broaden one’s understanding, so that when seeking an enlightened teacher, one can verify the principles one has discerned. Self-study and seeking a teacher are both indispensable.

On Gathering the Medicine and Fire Times:

Twenty-Nine

On the Fifteenth Night of the Eighth Month, one delights in the toad’s radiance—
this is precisely when the Metal essence is in its fullest vigor.
When the first Yang stirs, one must hasten to advance the fire without delay.

*(An alternate version reads: "When the first Yang begins to rise.")*

At the Mid-Autumn Moon, the Metal essence is at its peak,
and the Dao reaches its most steadfast, upright, and balanced state—
the original nature, perfectly luminous.
This luminous achievement depends entirely on the mind of the Dao.

Where the first Yang stirs is the moment when the single spark of true knowing—
the Yang light of the Dao-mind—just begins to move, yet has not fully awakened,
and the Celestial Root reveals its first signs.
At this critical juncture, one must swiftly apply the fire,
gathering it into the furnace of creation,
gradually refining it from subtlety to clarity.
From the first Yang, it must progress to the fullness of six Yangs,
just as the Mid-Autumn Moon shines with extraordinary brilliance,
illuminating the entire cosmos.

The phrase *"without delay"* is crucial,
for the light of true knowing in the Dao-mind is hard to attain yet easily lost.
If one hesitates even slightly, the luminous qi disperses,
and the opportunity is missed before one’s very eyes.

On Withdrawing and Adding Fire Times:
Thirty

When the first Yang stirs to form the elixir,
the lead cauldron glows warmly, illuminating the inner curtains.
At the moment of receiving qi, it is easily attained—
yet in applying withdrawal and addition, one must guard against peril.

This verse follows closely upon the previous one.
As the first Yang stirs, gather it into the cauldron:
the heart settled, qi harmonized, emptiness giving birth to clarity,
radiance gathering within, darkness yielding to light—
as though illuminating the inner curtains.

Master Cui said: *"Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against its turning inauspicious."*
For the first Yang’s return comes easily,
but its fullness is most difficult to achieve.
One must be vigilant against danger, ever mindful of risk,
applying the work of withdrawal and addition
to ensure success.

To withdraw is to reduce the excess of the human mind’s clever knowing;
to add is to augment the insufficiency of the Dao-mind’s true knowing.
Withdraw again and again, add again and again,
until there is no more to withdraw or add—
the human mind no longer arises,
the Dao-mind abides constantly,
true knowing and numinous knowing unite,
inner and outer shine with light—
only then is there no fear of midnight storms.

At this time, the Dao-mind has just returned,
Yang qi is faint, Yin qi still flourishing.
Without the work of withdrawal and addition,
even a moment’s slackness may lose what was gained.
Thus the work of withdrawal and addition is precious,
for it is itself the work of guarding against peril—
there is no guarding against peril apart from withdrawal and addition.
Peril lies within withdrawal and addition,
the two being one and the same.
The scholar must keep this firmly in view.

On Nurturing with Fire Times:
Thirty-one

The Mysterious Pearl takes form as Yang arises,
at Yang’s apex Yin recedes, its shape gradually stripped away.
By the tenth month, frost descends and the elixir ripens—
even spirits and ghosts must tremble at this time.

The Mysterious Pearl is the Pearl of Supreme Yang,
a thing of perfect clarity and unobscured luminosity,
another name for the Golden Elixir,
the original nature of innate knowing and innate ability,
that fundamental nature which, though quiescent and unmoving,
responds and penetrates when stimulated—
a likeness to the Mysterious Pearl.
This Pearl is the single point of unyielding true knowing in the Dao-mind,
formed through the accumulation of rightness,
ever generating, generating again,
until its vast qi fills all space,
its radiance full and complete—
this is the apex of Yang.
At Yang’s apex, Yin must be brought to meet it.
Yin strips away its form, nurturing Yang with Yin,
transforming the dryness of Yang’s rigidity.
This gradual stripping requires the work of ten months.
Through ten months of nurturing with fire times,
the ore is exhausted and the gold refined,
transmuted into numinous frost—
true emptiness containing wondrous being,
wondrous being concealing true emptiness,
unaware and unknowing,
accordant with the Emperor’s principle.
Like frost drifting in empty space,
beyond the semblance of being or non-being—
only then does the elixir ripen.
At this stage, the workings of creation cannot constrain it,
the myriad things cannot sway it;
its merit perfected among humans,
its name recorded in heaven—
how could spirits and ghosts not tremble?

On the firing times for embryo formation:

Between the waxing crescent’s end and waning crescent’s start,
the medicinal flavor is balanced, its qi-phase complete.
Gathered and returned, it is forged within the furnace,
refined through gentle nurturing, naturally simmered and steamed.

The waxing crescent is Yang within Yin, true knowing returning to central equilibrium;
the waning crescent is Yin within Yang, numinous knowing returning to central equilibrium.
When true knowing and numinous knowing both return to central equilibrium,
hard and soft are matched—
this matching point is called *between the waxing crescent’s end and waning crescent’s start*.
At this moment, true knowing and numinous knowing,
neither excessive nor deficient, are both fully present.
From within arises a primordial, singular sprout of numinous growth—
the medicinal flavor is balanced, Yin and Yang harmonized.
Swiftly gather and take it,
enclose it within the furnace of creation,
forge and refine it into truth,
and bind it as the sacred embryo.
At this stage, the medicine is the fire, the fire is the medicine;
through ten months of gentle nurturing,
a natural, true fire will simmer and steam it,
evolving from the subtle to the manifest,
giving formless form.

On Yin and Yang returning to the center:

The eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the West,
The youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North.
Should the Azure Maiden meet thereafter,
All at once the lock and key rest in the Yellow House.

The eldest son is *Zhen*.
The wine of the West is Metal-Water.
On the third day of the lunar month, the crescent appears in the *geng* direction,
beneath the utmost Yin, a single Yang descends and arises—
in the hexagram, this is *Zhen*, hence "the eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the West."

The youngest daughter is *Dui*.
The flower of the North is the golden blossom born within Water.
As the moon’s radiance emerges, from *Dui* to *Kun*,
Yang appears within Yin—
hence "the youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the North."
Both lines describe the image of a single Yang arising.

"Suddenly drinks" means he has never drunk before, yet now drinks unexpectedly.
"First blooms" means it has never bloomed before, yet now blooms for the first time.
"Suddenly drinks" and "first blooms" both convey the intent that the mind of the Dao and true knowing are easily lost yet difficult to find.
For the mind of the Dao has long lain buried, true knowing obscured,
until in the midst of utmost stillness, it suddenly appears—
like one who suddenly drinks wine or a flower that first blooms.
This is the turning point of return,
a rare and precious encounter that must not be missed.
One must seize the moment to gather it,
unite it with numinous knowing,
and seal it within the central chamber of the Yellow Court.
When husband and wife meet, the elixir naturally forms.

Numinous knowing is nature, Yin within Yang,
belonging to Wood—Wood’s color is azure,
hence numinous knowing is symbolized as the Azure Maiden.
When true knowing and numinous knowing meet,
of one heart and one qi,
they naturally return to the center.
Yet though they return, if one does not know how to lock and seal,
there is the risk of union followed by separation.
Having locked, one must also seal,
tightly closing the gates and doors,
so that what was not united must unite,
and what has united remains so.

This is what Zhang Sanfeng meant by:
*"The maiden from the eastern house, the lad from the western lodge,
joined as husband and wife and enter the bridal chamber;
the Yellow Dame urges them to drink the purest nectar,
and in a single day, they lift the veil and become drunk."*

The words "lock" and "seal" serve to guard against danger and forestall risk.
For when Yin and Yang first meet, their natures and dispositions are not yet pure and unified.
One must neither forget nor force,
maintaining strict vigilance—
only then can there be no leakage or loss,
and the golden elixir will congeal from emptiness.

This is a celestial mechanism, unknown without a teacher.

On bathing:

At thirty-four: the months of the Hare and the Rooster and their appointed times—when Punishment and Virtue arrive at the gate, they mirror the medicine’s image. Here the golden elixir should be bathed; if fire is still applied, ruin and peril will surely follow.

The month of the Hare at the Spring Equinox: yang qi ascends at the center of Heaven and Earth. The month of the Rooster at the Autumn Equinox: yin qi ascends at the center of Heaven and Earth. The Spring Equinox pertains to Wood, the qi of generation, and is Virtue; the Autumn Equinox pertains to Metal, the qi of killing, and is Punishment. Virtue gives life to things, Punishment brings them to completion. Without Punishment, Virtue cannot be fulfilled; without Virtue, Punishment cannot be perfected. With both Punishment and Virtue, the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth flows as a single qi, circulating without end.

The cultivator of the Dao tempers true knowing’s hardness to return to central equilibrium, like the Autumn Equinox; softens numinous knowing’s pliancy to return to central equilibrium, like the Spring Equinox. When true knowing and numinous knowing both return to central equilibrium, they resemble the Virtue of the Spring Equinox and the Punishment of the Autumn Equinox. The firmness of true knowing restrains the perverse qi of the human heart; the compliance of numinous knowing nurtures the upright qi of the Dao-heart. When hardness is fitting, be hard; when softness is fitting, be soft—without missing the proper time, then hardness and softness attain central equilibrium, like the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, each in its season. Thus it is said: the months of the Hare and the Rooster and their appointed times.

Within hardness there is softness, within softness there is hardness; when hardness and softness become as one, true and numinous knowing do not scatter, like the alternating operation of Spring’s Virtue and Autumn’s Punishment. Hence it is said: when Punishment and Virtue arrive at the gate, they mirror the medicine’s image. When the Dao reaches the central equilibrium of hardness and softness, the Dao-heart abides constantly, the human heart attains perfect stillness; true knowing becomes utterly numinous, numinous knowing becomes utterly true. When true and numinous knowing unite as one, innate knowing and innate capacity arise, and the golden elixir takes form. It may then be bathed and gently nurtured, the fire withdrawn from beneath the cauldron. Otherwise, if one does not know when to stop or be content, and continues to apply fire for refinement, hardness will be excessive, softness insufficient—hardness and softness will fail to attain central equilibrium. The medicine will wither, the elixir will be harmed; how can ruin and peril be avoided?

On civil refinement and martial tempering: thirty-five.

The sun and moon meet once every thirty days, their timely exchange a method of divine efficacy. In holding the city or waging wild battle, one knows fortune and misfortune, and the numinous cinnabar fills the crucible red.

The moon itself has no light but borrows the sun’s radiance. In a year, it meets the sun twelve times; in a month, thirty days; between the last and first days, one meeting occurs. When a person’s true knowing lies buried, pure yin without yang, it is like the moon without light—it must borrow numinous knowing to generate illumination. When numinous knowing and true knowing meet, it is like the sun and moon converging after thirty days.

The perfected emulate the image of their meeting, condensing thirty days into a single day, and that day into a single hour. In that hour, they rouse the firm qi, borrowing the human heart to generate the Dao-heart, using the Dao-heart to govern the human heart; relying on numinous knowing to produce true knowing, and using true knowing to dismiss numinous knowing. They gather the primordial qi of the undivided Hongmeng as the mother of the elixir, aligning with the divine mechanism of yin-yang transformation as the fire-timing.

This Dao involves both civil refinement and martial tempering. Holding the city is civil refinement; waging wild battle is martial tempering. When civil is called for, be civil; when martial is called for, be martial—this is fortune. When civil is needed but martial is used, or martial is needed but civil is used—this is misfortune.

Civil fire is the turning of light back to illuminate, dismissing cleverness and destroying cunning, concentrating the mind to nurture the upright qi, like holding a city. Martial fire is restraining anger and blocking desire, eliminating delusion and preserving sincerity, fiercely expelling guest qi, like waging wild battle. Knowing the proper use of civil and martial, discerning fortune and misfortune, one employs martial fire when there is action and civil fire when there is none.

Through civil fire and martial tempering, yin qi is exhausted and yang qi purified; true knowing and numinous knowing unite, transforming into innate knowing and innate capacity, the wondrous awakening of original nature. Round and luminous, bright and resplendent, pure and bare, unadorned and free—still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating. Responsive and penetrating, yet still and unmoving, utterly imbued with heavenly principle, utterly devoid of human desire. It is like the numinous cinnabar filling the crucible red.

When cinnabar reaches its numinous state, its material form is entirely transformed—neither form nor emptiness, neither being nor non-being—purely the qi of clear yang. Ingesting it dispels illness and extends years, averts calamity and avoids misfortune, restores original nature, and preserves the unobscured and luminous, the true emptiness and wondrous being. Creation cannot limit it, yin and yang cannot constrain it, and the myriad things cannot harm it—it is just like this.

Yet in the world, are there not those who know fortune and misfortune but are unwilling to devote themselves to divine efficacy?

**Two Poems on the Meaning of Hexagrams**

**Thirty-Six**
When *Pi* and *Tai* first meet, the ten thousand things fill the world;
*Tun* and *Meng* receive the mandate of generation and completion.
Within this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images—
To exhaust all lines is but to waste one’s spirit in vain.

*Qian* above, *Kun* below (䷋): Heaven’s qi descends from above, earth’s qi ascends from below—yin and yang do not meet, and this is *Pi* (Closed).
*Kun* above, *Qian* below (䷊): Earth’s qi descends from above, heaven’s qi ascends from below—yin and yang unite, and this is *Tai* (Open).
When *Pi* reaches its extreme, *Tai* arrives; as soon as yin and yang meet, the ten thousand things burst forth in fullness, filling the universe.

*Tun* (䷂): *Kan* above, *Zhen* below—thunder within water, yang born amid yin, thus dispersing yin to generate beings.
*Meng* (䷃): *Gen* above, *Kan* below—water beneath the mountain, yang trapped in yin, thus nurturing yang to complete beings.
*Pi* and *Tai* govern the passage and blockage of the ten thousand things;
*Tun* and *Meng* govern their generation and completion.
Passage and blockage, generation and completion—all arise from the interplay of yin and yang.
The coming and going of yin and yang, the passage and blockage, generation and completion of the ten thousand things—all occur naturally, without forced effort.

In the Dao of cultivating truth:
When firm and yielding have not yet united, this is *Pi*;
When firm and yielding unite, this is *Tai*.
When firmness is called for, advance with firmness to cultivate truth—this is *Tun*;
When yielding is called for, employ yielding to nurture truth—this is *Meng*.
Knowing passage and blockage, able to cultivate and nurture, firm and yielding applied in due time—transforming and shaping the sixty-four hexagrams, all lies within one’s own heart.

Generally, hexagrams present images to convey meaning; once meaning is grasped, images may be forgotten.
If one does not understand the meaning of the hexagrams but clings solely to their images, one will insist on advancing with one, two, or three yang lines to enact *Tai*, or controlling with one, two, or three yin lines to manage *Pi*.
To generate three yang lines to enact *Tai*—this approach still approximates reason.
But to generate three yin lines to manage *Pi*—is this not difficult?
Moreover, some claim that at the *zi* hour of heaven, yang qi stirs within *Kan* and moves, so one should guard the kidneys at *zi*, making this "morning *Tun*."
At the *wu* hour of heaven, yang qi is limited and halts, so one should guard the heart at *wu*, making this "evening *Meng*."
Alas! If one relies on this to interpret *Pi*, *Tai*, *Tun*, *Meng*, and the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, how can all be made to align?
To exhaust all lines in pursuit of perfect alignment—is this not a vain waste of spirit?
The ancient immortals said: *"No need to seek* zi *and* wu *at the edge of the sky—within the body, a single yang is born."* This should serve as clear proof for those who practice hexagrams and lines. Scholars must reflect deeply.

**Thirty-Seven**
Hexagrams set forth images to model forms;
Grasp the meaning, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear.
Yet the world’s deluded cling only to images,
Practicing hexagram qi in hopes of ascending in flight.

*Grasp the meaning* (one version reads *grasp the image*);
*Cling to images* (one version reads *fixate on images*).

The sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Zhouyi* merely clarify the images of yin and yang, their centeredness or lack thereof.
If one comprehends the meaning of yin and yang, centeredness or lack thereof, one can harmonize yin and yang, naturally aligning with the hexagrams.
Yet how is it that the world’s deluded disciples, failing to investigate meaning, cling instead to images, insisting on practicing *Tun* in the morning and *Meng* in the evening, beginning with *Tun* and *Meng* and ending with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, following hexagram qi in hopes of attaining the Dao and ascending in flight? This is utter folly.

Little do they know that the ancient immortals’ references to "morning *Tun*" and "evening *Meng*" were teachings to recognize that when yang is born, it is *Tun*, and when yang is trapped, it is *Meng*.
Yang’s birth is like the dawn of day; yang’s entrapment is like the dusk of night.
When yang is born, advance the yang fire to gather yang—this is "morning *Tun*."
When yang is trapped, employ the yin tally to nurture yang—this is "evening *Meng*."
As for *Jiji* and *Weiji*, they teach that when yin and yang have united, it is *Jiji*; when they have not united, it is *Weiji*.
When yin and yang unite, the golden elixir congeals, the work of yang fire is complete—*Jiji* must guard against failure, and the function of the yin tally is essential.
When yin and yang do not unite, the golden elixir does not form, the yin tally is useless—*Weiji* urgently requires fulfillment, and the work of yang fire must be undertaken.
This is the meaning hidden within the hexagrams, the intent of these four hexagrams. Extending this to the remaining sixty hexagrams, all are but transformations of a single yin and yang. Thus it is said: *Grasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear.*
If one understands the meaning of the hexagrams, the heavenly gate is in hand, the earthly axis is at heart—walking freely, every step is the Dao. There is no need to cling to hexagram images, for one naturally aligns with them.

Alas! The golden toad, the jade crow—recognize the true, and you are the master.

**On Geng and Jia: Thirty-Eight**

Heaven and Earth have their own times of fullness and emptiness; only by discerning their waxing and waning can one grasp the mechanism.
Since ancient times, Geng and Jia have been invoked to clarify the command—when the Three Corpses are slain, the Dao may be attained.

The Way of Heaven and Earth is the Way of fullness and emptiness.
When fullness reaches its extreme, emptiness follows; when emptiness reaches its extreme, fullness follows—each in its own time.
The cultivator of the Dao who can scrutinize the true principle of fullness and emptiness, and thereby subdue and dissolve yin while nurturing and augmenting yang, may be said to have grasped the mechanism of waxing and waning.
To subdue and dissolve yin is the mechanism of emptiness; to nurture and augment yang is the mechanism of fullness.
Yet in all dissolving and nurturing, one must never depart from the sincerity of true knowing or the numinosity of spiritual awareness.
The sincerity of true knowing is firm, belonging to the metal of Geng; the numinosity of spiritual awareness is yielding, belonging to the wood of Jia.
Firmness governs the external, subduing the guest qi; yielding abides within, quietly nourishing the celestial authenticity.
When firmness and yielding are both employed, inner and outer cultivation proceed in tandem—this is what it means for Geng and Jia to clarify the command.
When the command is clear, firmness and yielding are properly balanced, waxing and waning follow the season, the upright qi prevails and the perverse qi is transformed.
Inner thoughts do not leak outward, and external things do not intrude within.

Without eyes, ears, mouth, tongue, body, or intent,
Without form, sound, scent, flavor, touch, or dharma—
Pure and bare, naked and unadorned,
This is called slaying the Three Corpses to the last.
When the Three Corpses are slain, the host of yin is wholly transformed,
And the Great Dao may be hoped for.

The crux of this verse lies entirely in the line:
*"Only by carefully discerning the waxing and waning can one grasp the mechanism."*
*"Carefully discerning"* means thorough and intimate contemplation,
Penetrating even the subtlest details.
Only after deep and prolonged practice can truth be seen.
Only when truth is seen can one respond with the heart and act with the hands—
Only then can one wax and wane.
To wax and wane is to know the mechanism;
Without this ability, one cannot be said to know it.
Not knowing the mechanism means the principle has not been thoroughly examined and distinguished—
How then can the command be clarified to slay the Three Corpses?
Thus, the study of rectifying the heart and making intent sincere
Lies wholly in investigating things to extend knowledge.

**On the Two Mysteries (Yuan and Pin):**

**Thirty-Nine**
To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.
When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,
A single spark of numinous light will never depart.

The Valley Spirit is the *qi* of primordial emptiness and non-being—
What is called the "Sacred Embryo."
This *qi* is neither form nor void, yet both form and void,
Existing in the dim and obscure,
Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, intangible to grasp.
It is the boundary between the heart of Dao and the human heart,
The root of true knowing and numinous awareness,
The origin of firmness in *qing* and softness in *xing*—
Giving birth to heaven, earth, and humanity.

The Confucians call it the *"Supreme Ultimate,"* or *"Utmost Goodness,"* or *"Utmost Sincerity."*
The Buddhists call it *"Perfect Enlightenment,"* or *"Dharmakāya,"* or *"Tathāgata."*
The Daoists call it *"Golden Elixir,"* or *"Sacred Embryo,"* or *"Valley Spirit."*
In truth, it is humanity’s original good knowing and good ability,
The spirit manifesting in the empty valley.

When this Valley Spirit descends into the postnatal,
Yin and yang separate,
The false takes charge, and the true retreats—
The Valley Spirit is buried as if dead.
To refine the Golden Elixir, one must revive this Valley Spirit;
To revive the Valley Spirit, one must first harmonize yin and yang.
If yin and yang are not harmonized, the Valley Spirit will not coalesce.

*Yuan* is yang, the firm and vigorous *qing*;
*Pin* is yin, the soft and compliant *xing*.
With both firmness and softness, the Valley Spirit attains longevity,
And the root of immortality is established.
For the Valley Spirit is the balanced *qi* of the two arcs,
Formed through their union.
When the two arcs unite in the dim and obscure,
There is something within—this is called the *"Essence of True Unity."*
The Essence of True Unity is another name for the Valley Spirit.
Before refinement, it flickers in and out of existence—this is *"true essence."*
After refinement, it coalesces and does not scatter—this is the *"Valley Spirit."*

When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber,
Essence unifies at the center, and the Valley Spirit coalesces.
With the Valley Spirit coalesced, the heart of Dao abides constantly,
The human heart obeys, and true knowing and numinous awareness merge as one.
Good knowing and good ability become wholly celestial,
Still and unmoving, yet responding with perfect accord.
Responding with perfect accord while still and unmoving,
Ever responsive, ever tranquil—
A single spark of numinous light will never depart.
When the numinous light never departs, the Valley Spirit is ever undying.
When the Valley Spirit is undying,
It is what the immortal elder meant by:
*"Swallow a grain of Golden Elixir,
And you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven."*

The Valley Spirit, true essence, and numinous light
Are all the same thing,
Differentiated only by their state of completion or incompletion—
There are not three distinct entities. Scholars must understand this.

**Forty**
The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world;
People mistakenly take the mouth and nose as its locus.
Even if you practice breath control for a thousand years,
How can you seize the Golden Crow and Jade Hare?

Laozi said:
*"The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female."*
The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.
*Yuan* is the yang of *Qian*, the virtue of vigor and strength;
*Pin* is the yin of *Kun*, the virtue of compliance and softness.
Yang governs movement, yin governs stillness—
The movement and stillness of the Valley Spirit are the gate of the Mysterious Female.
This gate gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings,
Utterly empty yet containing the utterly full,
Utterly void yet containing the utterly substantial.
In the human body, it is where the Four Great do not adhere.

At the exact center of heaven and earth,
A void aperture hangs suspended,
Opening and closing in due time,
Moving and stilling naturally.
It has no fixed location, nor any form—
It is also called the *"Primal Pass."*
The Primal Pass is utterly void and utterly numinous,
Neither existence nor non-existence—
It is also called the *"Gate of All Wonders."*
All wonders: no principle is absent, no virtue is lacking.

If one takes the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,
Exhaling and inhaling impure *qi*,
How can one drive the Golden Crow and Jade Hare back to the Yellow Path,
Coalescing them into the most numinous elixir?

The Golden Crow is the image of the sun,
Yang containing yin—
In the human, it is the virtue of compliance and centeredness,
The numinous *xing* of numinous awareness.
The Jade Hare is the image of the moon,
Yin containing yang—
In the human, it is the virtue of vigor and centeredness,
The true *qing* of true knowing.

Numinous awareness and true knowing,
The centered virtue of yang and yin—
These are the *qi* of the two arcs.
The Valley Spirit is formed by their coalescence.

Without knowing the Mysterious Female, how can one know the Crow and Hare?
Without knowing the Crow and Hare,
How can the Valley Spirit be undying and attain longevity?

Alas!
What kind of gate is this?
Go with the flow, and you die;
Go against it, and you live.
Often it teaches you to seek, yet you cannot find it—
How easily can the Mysterious Female be known?

**On Nature and *Qing*:**
**Forty-One**

By different names they emerge, yet few know their common source—
These two, profoundly profound, are the pivotal mechanism.
Preserving life and perfecting form, discerning gain and loss,
The Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrous and rare.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is but one firm and one yielding,
Two ingredients of the medicine, with nothing else besides.
The firm belongs to the *qing* of true knowing,
The yielding to the subtle *xing* of numinous awareness.
One *xing*, one *qing*—though their names differ,
In truth they issue together from the primordial Void’s true Unity of *qi*.
This true Unity of *qi* is the Valley Spirit of the earlier verse,
While *xing* and *qing* are the Mysterious Female of that same poem.
The Mysterious Female, these two—profound beyond profundity—
Is the essential mechanism of the undying Valley Spirit.

For the Dao of the primordial and spontaneous:
The Valley Spirit gives rise to the Mysterious Female.
For the Dao of later return:
The Mysterious Female completes the Valley Spirit.
Without their union, the Valley Spirit cannot coalesce.
The Mysterious Female is the pivotal mechanism precisely to coalesce the Valley Spirit.

When the Mysterious Female is established, the Valley Spirit coalesces—
One may preserve life, perfect form,
And further clarify the gains of advancing yang and the losses of retreating yin.
Advance yang until nothing more can be added,
Retreat yin until nothing more can be diminished.
When yin is exhausted and yang is pure,
The Valley Spirit attains longevity,
A seamless unity of *qi*, utterly free of dregs—
Perfectly round, radiantly luminous,
Immaculately bare, resplendently unadorned.
Neither creation can constrain it,
Nor the myriad things harm it.
Like the firing times refining the Purple Gold Elixir,
It revives the dead and restores life—
Most numinous, most wondrous.

**On Effortful Practice:**
**Forty-Two**

At first, effortful practice is difficult for others to perceive;
Only when it reaches effortless action do the many begin to understand.
Yet all see effortless action as the essential marvel,
Who knows that effortful practice is the very root and foundation?

The ancient perfected ones said: *"Nature and life must be cultivated in tandem,
The work requires two distinct stages."*
For the Dao of the Golden Elixir consists of two paths:
One to cultivate life, one to cultivate nature.
The path of cultivating life is the path of effortful practice;
The path of cultivating nature is the path of effortless action.
The path of effortful practice extends life through technique;
The path of effortless action preserves form through the Dao.

The path that begins with effortful practice is the way of effortful action, forging life anew.
The study of forging life relies entirely on method and movement—
Drawing from the primordial *qi* before the separation of the Great Primal Chaos,
Wresting the pivotal mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation,
Reversing the twenty-four seasonal nodes,
And returning the seventy-two micro-seasons to their essential Dao.
Heaven and Earth cannot fathom it,
Ghosts and spirits cannot divine it,
The milfoil and tortoise cannot prognosticate it.
If even Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, milfoil and tortoise cannot know it,
How could mere humans perceive it?

In the end, effortless action employs the path of non-doing to cultivate nature.
The path of cultivating nature embraces the origin and guards the One,
All things become empty—
Like a hen brooding her egg,
Like an oyster containing its pearl.
When the work reaches its day,
Utmost sincerity grants foreknowledge,
The wisdom-mind opens wide,
Sounds enter and the heart understands,
Fortune and misfortune are known in advance,
Blessings and calamities are foreseen—
Who would not recognize this?

Yet people only see the path of effortless action as the essential marvel,
Unaware that the path of effortful practice is the root and foundation.
To know not effortful practice and only pursue effortless action—
Not only can one not cultivate life,
But one also cannot cultivate nature.
Even if there is cultivation,
It is merely the cultivation of the acquired *qi*-constitution’s nature,
How could it cultivate the nature of the primordial root?

The root-nature is the nature of Heaven’s mandate.
Originally, nature and life were one household, not two separate strands;
But upon engaging the acquired, yin and yang parted,
One became two, and nature and life diverged.
Once nature and life diverged,
Nature could no longer attend to life,
Nor could life attend to nature.
Life was seized by things and could not govern itself,
And nature, too, became disordered.
With nature in chaos and life unsteady,
Right and wrong intermingled,
Principle and desire intertwined,
The false took command,
The true retreated—
Day after day, year after year,
Yin *qi* stripped away yang to exhaustion,
And nature and life had no choice but to collapse.

Thus, the Dao of the Golden Elixir must first employ effortful practice within the acquired to return to the primordial,
Restoring one’s original life-treasure.
Once the life-treasure is in hand,
Mastery resides with the self,
Unmoved by the transformations of creation.
Then, embracing the origin and guarding the One,
One practices the path of effortless action
To consummate the true emptiness of the original nature—
Fitting indeed to transcend to the most supreme and wondrous Dao.

Alas! Why do all those stubborn adherents of emptiness and annihilation
Know only effortless action and not effortful practice?

**On the Feminine and Masculine:**
**Forty-Three**

Within the black there is white—this is the Elixir Mother;
Within the masculine lies the feminine—this is the Sacred Embryo.
The Great One in the crucible must be steadfastly guarded,
And the treasures of the Three Fields gathered as the Three Terraces.

That "within the black there is white" refers to the true knowing born of the Dao-mind,
A Way of firm strength and centered uprightness—hence called the Elixir Mother.
That "within the masculine lies the feminine" refers to the numinous knowing inherent in the human mind,
A virtue of soft compliance and centered uprightness—hence called the Sacred Embryo.
When firmness and compliance unite, when hardness and softness share the same *qi*,
The human mind is transformed into the Dao-mind,
And numinous knowing returns to true knowing—
This is called the Great One containing true *qi*.
The Great One is the spirit of merged yin-yang and unified essence,
Another name for the Golden Elixir.
When this true *qi* of the Great One enters the crucible of creation,
It is warmed and nurtured, sealed and securely stored, guarded without loss.
Thus, essence is whole, *qi* is whole, spirit is whole—
The Three Fields gather treasure like the Three Terraces supporting the pole,
And creation lies within one’s grasp.

The Three Fields—*guanyuan*, *huangting*, and *ninian*—
Are not the same as the cinnabar field, the vermilion palace, or the celestial valley,
Nor are they the coccyx, the spine’s midpoint, or the jade pillow.
They are the birthplaces of the three great medicines of primordial essence, *qi*, and spirit,
Formless and imageless, without fixed location.
Because they are the places where essence, *qi*, and spirit arise, they are called "Fields";
Because essence, *qi*, and spirit are spoken of separately, they are called the "Three Fields."
Yet in truth, the Three Fields are one field, the Three Treasures are one treasure.
Due to the three layers of practice—refining essence into *qi*, refining *qi* into spirit, refining spirit into emptiness—
They are spoken of as three.
But when refining spirit into emptiness is reached,
There is only emptiness, and essence, *qi*, and spirit also return to no trace—
How then could there be any talk of Three Fields?

**On Being and Non-Being:**
**Forty-Four**

Within the dim and indistinct, seek the image that arises;
Within the profound and obscure, find the true essence.
From this, being and non-being naturally merge,
Yet without seeing, how can one conceive of completion?

The dim and indistinct are neither form nor emptiness—an unfixed image;
The profound and obscure are utmost stillness and silence—a place unseen.
Within the dim and indistinct lies the image: numinous awareness;
Within the profound and obscure dwells true essence: true knowing.
Numinous awareness is outwardly yang yet inwardly yin—non-being within being;
True knowing is outwardly yin yet inwardly yang—being within non-being.
Those who cultivate the Dao to complete the Golden Elixir
Must seek numinous awareness within the dim and indistinct,
And find true knowing within the profound and obscure.
If one can truly grasp this with heart and spirit,
And recognize what is real, this is called "having seen."
Once seen clearly, use true knowing to govern numinous awareness,
And numinous awareness to nurture true knowing.
Then being and non-being will embrace in mutual affection,
Naturally merging and interacting—thus the Golden Elixir is instantly formed.
Otherwise, if one does not know the image within the dim and indistinct,
Or the essence within the profound and obscure,
One remains ignorant of what the ingredients of the Golden Elixir truly are.
How then can one vainly imagine its completion?

**On Ingesting the Elixir (Two Poems):**
**Forty-Five**

When the Four Symbols converge, the mysterious body is complete;
Where the Five Phases are whole, the Purple Gold shines bright.
Once the embryo is shed and the elixir enters the mouth, the body attains sagehood—
Countless dragons and spirits are utterly astonished.

The Way of the Purple Gold (or *Purple Radiance*) Elixir
Lies entirely in gathering the Five Phases and harmonizing the Four Symbols.
When the Four Symbols converge,
Nature, emotions, essence, and spirit unite, and the primordial body is established.
If one can then hold fast to the center with perfect sincerity,
And refine it with the fire of celestial truth,
This is called "completing the Five Phases."
Once the Five Phases are complete,
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all return to single-minded trust;
Nature, emotions, essence, and spirit all transform into one *qi*.
Vigorous and yielding merge without trace,
Hard and soft leave no mark.
True knowing and numinous awareness likewise shift into innate knowledge and innate ability—
Utterly good, without evil,
Fused with the Heavenly Principle,
Round and unobstructed,
Empty yet luminous,
Possessing all principles and responding to all affairs.
Like yellow gold forged into Purple Gold, its radiance shines outward.
When ingested, it transmutes all acquired yin influences,
Revealing the primordial Dharma-body,
Entering the foundation of sagehood.
"My life is mine, not heaven’s to command"—
How could dragons and spirits not be astonished?

The phrase "entering the mouth" signifies sudden awakening,
Not the literal act of ingestion.
When the primordial *qi* is refined to maturity,
It suddenly shifts from gradual to instantaneous,
From clarity to sincerity—
Like the elixir entering the mouth, all illnesses vanish,
And thus the body attains sagehood.
Scholars must grasp the meaning beyond the words,
And not cling to the text or fixate on images.
If one interprets "entering the mouth" as physical swallowing,
And ponders how to ingest the primordial *qi*—
Formless and imageless—
What is there to swallow? What is there to ingest?
Here, one may attain clear understanding.

At forty-six:
The Banquet in the Flowery Pond concludes, the moon’s radiance pure,
I mount a golden dragon to visit the Purple Tenuity.
From this time, after meeting with the host of immortals,
Let the seas turn to fields, the hills shift to valleys—my Dharma-body remains unchanging.

*Sea-fields* (one version reads *Sea-Tide Realm*)

The "Banquet in the Flowery Pond" signifies drawing the true yang from Kan to enter the crucible of creation, stabilizing the Dao-heart and filling the abdomen. The "moon’s radiance pure" means the Dao-heart abides constantly, its wisdom-light shining bright, neither concealed nor deceptive.

"Mounting a golden dragon": Qian is metal, is dragon. Drawing the Dao-heart from Kan—the true knowing of yang—fills the yin of human-heart knowing in Li, transforming mere knowing into true knowing. Li reverts to Qian, the original face fully revealed, wholly imbued with Heavenly principle, perfectly round, luminously radiant, purely yang without yin.

"Visiting the Purple Tenuity": The Purple Tenuity Emperor governs creation and binds the constellations. Cultivating the Dao to revert to the Qian-body, mastery rests within me; the celestial gate is in my grasp, the earth’s axis turns at my will. Creation cannot constrain, the myriad things cannot sway. Visiting the Purple Tenuity, I join the ranks of Heaven. The work is accomplished among men, the name inscribed above.

From this time, meeting with the host of immortals, let the seas surge and tides rise, let hills and valleys shift—my Dharma-body endures forever, indestructible.

On the inner congealing of the elixir:
At forty-seven...

To grasp the method of Golden Liquid Reversion Elixir, one must plant the seed within the homestead. No need for forced breath or exertion—naturally, the elixir ripens and the true embryo sheds its husk.

The method of Golden Liquid Reversion Elixir lies in the nearest great medicine, not afar; the practice is concise, not cumbersome. The homestead itself holds the medicinal ingredients, which may be planted at any time. No external crucible or bellows, no labored firing, is required—it ripens and transforms of itself.

The elixir is the primordial, formless, true Unity-qi, the numinous root sundered at the dawn of chaos, the ancestral qi of all life. Contained, it becomes true emptiness; manifested, it becomes wondrous being. Employed, it is the Dao-mind; nurtured, it is the Valley Spirit. Utterly non-being yet containing utter being, utterly void yet containing utter fullness, it holds the qi of the Five Phases yet lacks their substance. Concealed within the Five Phases, it does not fall into their constraints. Sage or worthy, buddha or immortal—all arise from this.

This is no other thing but our original, neither form nor emptiness, the innate goodness of constant norm. Only through entanglement with the postnatal does the consciousness-spirit take charge, burying and obscuring it. If a true teacher points it out, one realizes the homestead’s own possession, not obtained from another. Once planted, it grows from subtle to manifest, ripening naturally.

The Immortal Elder said: *"One must plant the seed within the homestead."* All heterodox paths seeking outside the body may now awaken and turn back.

**On the medicine coming from without:**
*Forty-eight*
Abandon artifice and false effort,
Recognize the deathless formula of another’s house.
In the flask, ever replenish the wine of extended life;
In the tripod, gather the nectar of returning soul.

The earlier verse spoke of planting the seed within the homestead, lest one cling to solitary cultivation. Thus, it immediately follows: *"Abandon artifice and false effort, recognize the deathless formula of another’s house."*

The "planting within the homestead" refers to the elixir’s medicinal ingredients—unchanged in the sage, undiminished in the commoner, possessed by all, perfected in each, not sought elsewhere, for the homestead holds them already.

The "deathless formula of another’s house" refers to the postnatal qi, where consciousness-spirit dominates, and yang is trapped by yin—like one’s own property now held by another. To return to the root and restore the origin, one must employ the method of pursuit and gathering, so that the departed primordial true yang may be reclaimed, and what has come remains one’s own.

What has not yet come belongs to another; what has come belongs to me. Because there is a time before and after arrival, there is a distinction between another’s house and one’s own. Thus, before its arrival, one must tread firmly, gradually gathering and refining, ever replenishing and collecting, performing the work of effort.

Though called "effort," it is truly effortless. "Effort" here means subtly harnessing yin and yang, seizing the transformations of creation—not the artifices of others, but the natural operation of things.

"Ever replenish the wine of extended life" means augmenting the true knowing of the Dao-mind to secure destiny. "Gather the nectar of returning soul" means emptying the numinous knowing of the human mind to nurture nature.

The wine of extended life is golden juice; the nectar of returning soul is wooden liquid. Replenishing the gold and gathering it, metal and wood merge, emotion and nature unite, true knowing and numinous knowing congeal, and the elixir’s origin takes form.

The four words *"ever replenish, gather"* carry profound meaning. For yin and yang have long been scattered and dispersed; without gradual replenishment and collection, metal and wood cannot merge, nature and emotion cannot harmonize. Only through constant replenishment and gathering, vigilance day and night, neither forgetting nor forcing, with time and deep practice, do metal and wood naturally merge, nature and emotion naturally harmonize. Then one may extend life, return the soul, and enter the realm of deathlessness.

**On the inner and outer elixirs:**
*Forty-nine*
A fine ghee from Snow Mountain,
Poured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of creation.
If it passes northwest beyond Kunlun,
Zhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.

Snow Mountain lies in the west, representing metal and primordial emotion. Ghee, as water, represents primordial essence. The Eastern Sun, as wood, represents primordial nature; the crucible of creation, as fire, represents primordial spirit.

Take the metal-water of primordial emotion and essence, pour it into the wood-fire of primordial nature and spirit. Refine metal-water with wood-fire, and restrain wood-fire with metal-water. Punishment perfects virtue, virtue fulfills punishment—both employed, metal and wood merge, water and fire harmonize, the Four Great unite, and the elixir returns.

This is the outer elixir’s symbolic method.

Kunlun Mountain lies in the northwest of heaven and earth, the ancestral vein of all mountains, akin to the primordial true Unity-qi, the ancestral qi of all life. The northwest belongs to Qian, the highest place on earth, where height is yang.

Zhang Qian is yang; Ma Gu is yin. When the reversion elixir has formed, transformed into the true Unity-qi, growing from subtle to manifest, yang-qi flourishes, the great medicine arises, imbued with Heavenly principle, firm and upright, central and correct. A single grain of utmost yang elixir emerges.

Using this elixir to touch the postnatal yin of the body is like a cat catching a mouse: false yin dissolves, true yin appears, yin and yang blend, forming the sacred embryo. Thus: *"If it passes northwest beyond Kunlun, Zhang Qian first meets Ma Gu."*

The three words *"first meets"* encompass layers of practice. Before the elixir reaches the extreme of yang, Zhang Qian is not permitted to meet Ma Gu. Only when nurtured to the yang extreme does Zhang Qian first meet Ma Gu.

True yin and true yang meet; the Dao-mind and human mind both transform into the good mind. True knowing and numinous knowing wholly become good knowing. A single grain of millet-pearl hangs in the void, neither form nor emptiness, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds without obstruction.

This is the inner elixir’s symbolic method.

The outer elixir is that which is lost and then regained, returning from without to within—this is the returning elixir. The inner elixir is that which, once returned, refines away the yin qi, emerging from within as true purity—this is the great elixir. When the outer elixir is complete and the inner elixir is achieved, merit is fulfilled and fame is attained. One roams freely in the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever.

On yang essence:
*Fifty—*
Not knowing yang essence or host and guest,
How can one tell which is distant, which is close?
Sealing the Weilu acupoint in bedchamber arts
Has misled countless souls in Jambudvīpa!

Yuanduzi said: "A single droplet of yang essence is concealed within the mountain of form, not in the heart or kidneys, but in the primordial gate of the One Aperture. This yang essence, being utterly yang and utterly pure, contains not a trace of yin turbidity. It is the originally firm, strong, balanced, and unadulterated essence—concealed, it is true emptiness; manifested, it is wondrous existence. This is what is called the inherent goodness of the constant norm, or the Dao-mind, incomparable to the postnatal, utterly yin and turbid essence.

Within the human body, yang essence governs creation and transformation, dispelling all perversities. The ancients named it the essence of True Unity, or the water of True Unity, or the qi of True Unity—yet in truth, these are all one and the same as the yang essence of the Dao-mind.

Yang essence, born before Heaven and Earth, is the host; yin essence, born after Heaven and Earth, is the guest. The host is intimate with me; the guest is distant. Mistaking yin essence for yang essence, practicing bedchamber arts to control women, sealing the Weilu, restraining yin essence, and vainly hoping to form the elixir—how could this ever succeed?

Though yang essence is obtained in the 'chamber,' this is not the chamber of a house, but the chamber of the entire body. As the immortal elders said: 'Every household has it, every household cultivates it'—the meaning is the same. How could it be the chamber of a house?

If the cultivator wishes to recognize yang essence, first seek the Primordial Gate. Once the Primordial Gate is known, there lies the yang essence."

On returning to the root:
*Fifty-one—*

The myriad things all return to their root,
Returning to the root and recovering life—this is everlasting.
To know the constant and return to the root is rarely grasped by men;
Reckless action invites misfortune, as often heard.

All things sprout in spring, grow in summer,
Gather in autumn, and store in winter—this is the constant Dao.
Having grown them, then gathering and storing them,
This is called returning to the root.
To return to the root is to recover life.
Recovering life means restoring the life-qi of Heaven’s mandate.
When life-qi is restored, it issues anew from the root,
Thus achieving constancy and immortality.

If one can comprehend the celestial mechanism by which the myriad things endure,
And return to the root to recover life,
Then one too may endure as an immortal.
Yet the Dao of knowing the constant and returning to the root is profound in principle,
Subtle in practice—
There is the maturity of medicinal substances, the urgency of firing times;
There are inner medicinal substances, outer medicinal substances;
Inner firing times, outer firing times;
Civil firing times, martial firing times;
Firing times for gathering medicine, for forging and refining;
Firing times for forming the elixir, for shedding the elixir;
Firing times for cultivating life, for cultivating nature.
These layers must be transmitted one by one by a true teacher
Before one may proceed.
Otherwise, failing to seek instruction from others,
Relying on one’s own cleverness and insight,
Conjecturing and guessing,
Believing oneself enlightened and rashly taking action—
Little does one realize that a hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of loss,
And reckless action invites misfortune, as principle confirms!

On the Sword of Wisdom:
*Fifty-two*

Ouye’s personally transmitted sword-forging method,
Moye’s metal and water blend softness and hardness.
Once refined, it responds to human intent—
A thousand miles to slay demons in a flash of lightning.

The sword is a guardian for the body,
A wisdom-tool for attaining Buddhahood or immortality,
The very handle for becoming a sage or worthy—
This is what is called the Returned Elixir.
There is no sword apart from the Returned Elixir.
The so-called Returned Elixir is the restoration of one’s original innate knowledge and innate capacity,
The true spirit where hardness and softness unite.
Forging the sword is forging this wisdom-tool of innate knowledge and innate capacity,
Where hardness and softness merge as one.
In terms of essence, it is the Elixir;
In terms of function, it is the Sword.
Yet in truth, the Sword and the Elixir are one and the same,
Not two separate things.

Of old, Ouye forged a sword but repeatedly failed,
Until his wife Moye leapt into the furnace,
And with one firing, it was complete.
The world calls it the Moye Treasure Sword,
Its sharpness unmatched.

In the Dao of cultivating reality,
Forging the sword comes first—
Drawing forth the qi of hardness and softness in perfect balance,
Refining it with water and fire into a treasure,
Called the Sword of Wisdom.
Worn at the side, it obeys the heart’s command,
Slaying demons a thousand miles away in a flash of lightning.

The Immortal Elder uses Ouye and Moye
To illustrate the principle of hardness and softness in harmony,
A most subtle and profound teaching.
Cultivators must understand that both hardness and softness
Must return to the mean and uprightness,
Only then can they transmute postnatal yin.
If hardness is needed but one is soft,
Or softness is needed but one is hard,
Or hardness becomes excessive and rash,
Or softness grows too weak and timid—
Failing to hit the mean and uprightness,
The sword is not successfully forged.
If the sword is not forged, one lacks an inner handle,
Every step meets obstruction,
How then can the Great Dao be fulfilled?

Yet the method of forging the sword is not easily known,
The balance of hardness and softness most difficult to grasp.
Without a true teacher’s personal transmission and oral instruction,
All is but vain conjecture.

On Harmonizing Temperament:
Fifty-Three

Striking bamboo to summon the turtle that swallows jade mushrooms,
Playing the zither to call the phoenix that drinks the elixir spoon.
Of late, golden light shines through the body entire—
Not to be spoken of to common folk is this principle.

Bamboo is a thing of hollow heart; when struck, it responds.
The zither is a thing of sound; when tuned, it harmonizes.
The turtle is a thing that nurtures qi;
The phoenix is a thing of civil brilliance.
Jade mushrooms are things of tender softness and long life,
The elixir spoon is a thing of pure essence, unadulterated.
Turtle, spoon, and *gui* all belong to yang;
Phoenix, jade, and mushrooms all belong to yin.

The Way of the Golden Elixir consists of two matters: emptying the heart and filling the abdomen—beyond these, there is no other method.
When the human heart is empty, the heart of Dao arises, and the abdomen is filled, as in striking bamboo to summon the turtle.
Once the abdomen is filled, with the hardness of the heart of Dao, one restrains the softness of the human heart, as the turtle swallowing jade mushrooms.
When true knowing manifests, numinous knowing becomes still and the heart luminous, as in playing the zither to call the phoenix.
Once the heart is luminous, with the nature of numinous knowing, one nurtures the emotions of true knowing, as the phoenix drinking the elixir spoon.

The heart of Dao is true knowing; the human heart is numinous knowing.
Emptiness and fullness respond to each other, hardness and softness become one.
Constantly responsive, constantly still,
Round and radiant, pure and bare, unadorned and free,
The body transparent through and through, inner and outer luminous—
One enters the realm of the sage in the ease of the central Way.

This is the Way of stealing yin and yang, seizing creation,
Revolving heaven and earth, twisting the pivot of qi,
Advancing before heaven so that heaven does not oppose it—
How could it be spoken of to common folk?

On Gradual and Sudden:
Fifty-Four

Medicine meets its kindred qi to form an image,
The Dao resides in the subtle and unseen, uniting with nature.
A single grain of numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—
Only then does one know my fate is not ruled by heaven.

Medicines of the same qi and kind are the true yang of true knowing and the true yin of numinous knowing.
When true yin and true yang merge and unite,
Only then can they condense from formlessness into form.
What cannot be heard is called the subtle;
What cannot be seen is called the unseen.
Unheard and unseen, the Dao returns to emptiness,
A single qi harmonious and flowing,
Without thought, without action,
Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—
All under heaven unfolds without force,
In accord with nature.

First, yin and yang condense;
Then, yin and yang merge into oneness.
A single grain of numinous elixir hangs in the void,
Illuminating mountains and rivers across the great earth.
Swallowed and ingested, its light arises within the five viscera,
Dispelling all yin influences,
Transforming the post-heaven trigrams—
Only then does one know my fate is ruled by me, not by heaven.

The first two lines proceed from effort to naturalness;
The third line emerges from naturalness to sudden awakening.
When the numinous elixir enters the belly, this is the meaning of sudden awakening.
In the state of sudden awakening through Dao cultivation,
Both being and non-being dissolve,
Heaven and earth return to emptiness.
One leaps beyond yin and yang,
No longer bound by them,
Fate governed by the self, not by heaven.
If one has not reached the river of sudden awakening,
Still moving in and out of yin and yang,
Fate remains subject to heaven—
The word "only" makes this clear.

On the Ease of Forming the Elixir:
Fifty-Five
Resplendent golden elixir forms in a single day—
The ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.
If one speaks of nine years or three,
It is all procrastination, wasting time.

The great medicine of the golden elixir
Is possessed by all, ready in every household.
If one can thoroughly investigate its true principles,
Seek out an enlightened teacher,
Recognize the two medicines of true knowing and numinous knowing,
And discern the primal aperture,
With sincere resolve, one may swiftly reach the other shore.
In a single day’s effort, the radiant yang elixir may be formed—
Why wait three years or nine?

These are the words of the ancient immortals, not falsehoods.
Yet while the elixir coalesces in an instant,
Its nurturing requires ten months.
Without the work of nurturing, the golden elixir will not stabilize,
And one may gain it only to lose it again.
The "single day" refers to the union of yin and yang,
Not the maturation of the golden elixir.
Maturation demands the work of yin tally and yang fire,
Adding and reducing, increasing and diminishing,
Until there is nothing left to add or diminish—
Only then is the radiant yang elixir complete.
If it were truly a mature elixir,
How could it mature in a single day?

The immortal elder’s earlier poem says:
*"Though you know cinnabar and black lead,
Without the firing times, it is all in vain.
It all depends on the power of cultivation—
A hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form."*

The later verse says:
*"To refine the nine transformations,
First refine the self and hold the mind."*

From this, one may understand the meaning of the golden elixir forming in a day.

Fifty-Six
The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—
Know that it depends on me, yet also on heaven.
Without cultivating virtue and accumulating hidden merit,
Demons will arise at every turn to obstruct the path.

The previous poem speaks of the elixir forming in a day, which seems easy.
But I fear students may treat the great Dao lightly,
Neglecting virtue and conduct,
Yet vainly hoping for immortality.
Thus, this poem clarifies the importance of virtue.

What heaven bestows upon humanity is virtue;
What humanity offers in return to heaven is also virtue.
With virtue, heaven rejoices,
And the cultivation of fate becomes easy, governed by the self.
Without virtue, heaven is displeased,
And the cultivation of the Dao becomes difficult, governed by heaven.

Why is this so?
Without virtue or conduct, even spirits and gods will not tolerate it.
At every turn, demonic obstructions arise,
Along with calamities, illnesses, and setbacks,
Inevitably leading to abandonment halfway.
Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must prioritize cultivating virtue.
With weighty virtue, learning the Dao becomes easy,
And cultivating the Dao becomes effortless—
For heaven rejoices, and demonic obstructions naturally dissolve.

On Stealing the Mechanism:
Fifty-Seven
The Three Powers steal from one another in due time—
Within this mechanism lie the Dao, virtue, and immortality.
When the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,
The hundred bones are ordered, and non-action is realized.

The Three Powers steal from one another:
Heaven and earth steal from the myriad things,
The myriad things steal from humanity,
And humanity steals from the myriad things.

"In due time" means:
The myriad things steal the qi of heaven and earth to flourish,
While heaven and earth, seeing the myriad things flourish,
Seize the opportunity to gather them in—
Thus, heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things.
When people see the myriad things and generate greed and delusion,
The myriad things, sensing human greed and delusion,
Seize the opportunity to drain their spirit—
Thus, the myriad things are the thieves of humanity.
The myriad things, nurtured by human cultivation, bear fruit,
And humans, seeing the myriad things bear fruit,
Seize the opportunity to make use of them—
Thus, humanity is the thief of the myriad things.

The mechanism of stealing in due time,
With its sequence of giving and taking,
Has been hidden by immortals since ancient times.
They conceal it in the timely act of stealing,
Pilfering yin and yang,
Seizing creation,
Reversing life and death,
Twisting the pivot of qi,
Dissolving guest qi,
And supporting the upright qi.

Thus, the myriad transformations are at peace,
All concerns cease,
The hundred bones are ordered,
And the Dao of non-action and naturalness is realized.

The emphasis of this poem lies in the two words "in due time."
Stealing in due time means the qi of heaven, earth, and the myriad things is obtained by me.
Missing the time means my qi is seized early by heaven, earth, and the myriad things.
"In due time" is stealing;
"Not in due time" is not stealing.
The subtlety of the word "time" is profound indeed.

On Investigating Principle:
Fifty-Eight

The *Yinfu* treasures surpass three hundred characters,
The *Daode* sacred scriptures fill five thousand.
From ancient times to now, immortals number without end—
All attain the true essence within these very texts.
The *Yinfu* and *Daode*, twin scriptures of the Dao,
Reveal heaven and earth’s transformative mechanisms,
Expose the secrets of yin-yang and life-death.
From antiquity to the present,
Superior scholars and perfected beings
Have delved into these two classics to fathom true principle,
To grasp the real essence and fulfill nature and life.
Even the Immortal Elder’s *Wuzhen* was composed
Upon the foundation of *Yinfu* and *Daode*.
If scholars can awaken to truth,
The meanings of *Yinfu* and *Daode* will become perfectly clear.

On Seeking a Teacher:
Fifty-Nine

Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a true teacher, do not force conjecture.
For the golden elixir lacks oral transmission—
Where then can you conceive the spiritual embryo?

The preceding section speaks of *Yinfu* and *Daode*
As treasured characters and sacred scriptures,
Which scholars should thoroughly investigate.
Yet I fear disciples may cling to alchemical texts,
Presuming themselves correct and refusing to seek others—
Thus this poem urges the swift search for a true teacher.
Alchemical classics and philosophical works
Contain every ingredient and firing process,
Employing myriad metaphors
To make all understand this principle,
To make each know this Way.
But the study of nature and life is subtle and profound,
Not easily discerned as true.
If one has insights or awakenings,
One must seek a teacher’s verification.
Without seeking a teacher,
Relying on one’s own brilliance,
Forcing conjecture and private interpretation—
Will this not squander one’s nature and life?
Hence it is said: *Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, / Without a true teacher, do not force conjecture.*

The Way of nature and life
Relies on gathering primordial qi as its essential task.
But primordial qi is formless and imageless,
Invisible, inaudible, untouchable—
How then to cultivate it?
How then to return it?
Alchemical classics and philosophical works
Have never failed to speak of this qi,
Never failed to speak of cultivation,
Never failed to speak of return.
Yet no matter how strenuously they describe it,
Their words fall short of its image;
No matter how forcefully they discuss it,
Their discourse fails to reach it.
Only through a true teacher’s oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction
Can one recognize the ingredients,
Understand the firing process,
And proceed directly without hindrance.
Otherwise, without seeking the teacher’s oral instructions,
Merely following the words of alchemical texts,
Slightly diverging into branches and leaves,
Presuming great enlightenment and awakening,
Then acting arbitrarily—
Whether clinging to emptiness or grasping at forms—
Where can the spiritual embryo be conceived?
Thus the true teacher’s oral instructions cannot but be urgently sought.

On Quieting the Mechanism:
Sixty

Only when the heart-ape is thoroughly stilled,
The mind’s mechanism fully quieted,
Can three thousand meritorious deeds align with heaven.
Naturally, the cauldron will refine dragon and tiger—
Why cling to home, yearn for wife and children?

Disciples fail to realize the Dao and attain the Dao
Due to the heart’s instability and their unsteady roots.
If all conditions are truly emptied,
All things viewed with detachment,
Reduced again and again to non-action,
The square inch of the heart purified—
Then inner cultivation is achieved.
Further accumulating virtue and practice,
Hardship for oneself, benefit for others,
Everywhere offering convenience,
Unmoved by wealth or honor,
Unshaken by poverty or low status,
Unbowed by power or force,
Wholly devoted, living with circumstances,
All afflictions extinguished—
Then outer cultivation is accomplished.
With inner cultivation achieved and outer cultivation complete,
Three thousand merits fulfilled,
Virtue matching heaven,
One may attain longevity equal to heaven.
As it is said: *Those of great virtue must attain their alignment.*

Within the heart’s square inch,
Not even a speck of dust can be tolerated.
The slightest dust disrupts the harmony of nature and emotion,
Dragon and tiger rage wildly,
Giving rise to all manner of dangers.
But if the mind’s mechanism is entirely eradicated,
Empty and open,
No need to seek another cauldron—
This very self is the cauldron.
Once the cauldron is established,
Every movement and stillness,
Unknowing and unperceiving,
Follows heaven’s principle.
Nature and emotion unite,
Harmonious qi steams and rises—
This itself is the refinement of dragon and tiger,
No need to ask further.
This Way—
Ingredients are ever-present,
The cauldron naturally exists.
Those who know it,
Though foolish or humble,
Through diligent practice may ascend to sagehood.
Yet worldly people fail to see through worldly affairs,
Fail to recognize true nature and life,
Clinging to wife and children,
Entangled without end,
Exhausting their minds,
Oil dried, lamp extinguished,
Marrow depleted, life lost—
Alas!

On Knowing Contentment:
Sixty-One

Before refining the Returned Elixir, hasten to refine it;
Once refined, know when to halt and be content.
If the mind clings to fullness without cease,
One cannot avoid ruin and disgrace in time.

The Returned Elixir is the return to life’s origin—
Innate knowing, innate ability,
Hard and soft united,
The true numinous essence of original nature.
Yet when humans reach yang’s extremity and yin arises,
The primordial enters the postnatal,
Innate knowing becomes false knowing,
Innate ability becomes false ability.
Hard and soft fall out of balance,
The true numinous grows dim—
As if one’s own possession were lost abroad.

To return is to reclaim what was originally one’s own,
As a lost object is found again,
As what has departed returns once more.
Yet the Dao of the Returned Elixir
Has its rhythms of advance and retreat, urgency and ease,
Its fire-tending of cultivation and contentment.
One must adapt to the moment, respond to circumstances,
Neither excessive nor deficient.

Thus, before the Elixir returns,
One advances with courage and vigor,
Gradually gathering, gradually refining,
Urgent in seeking its return.
Once the Elixir has returned,
It is again innate knowing, innate ability,
Hard and soft united,
The undimmed true numinous essence.
The work is accomplished, the medicine’s qi is full,
The task of effort is complete, the effortless task manifests—
Then swiftly withdraw the fire, halt the wheel,
Remove the fuel from beneath the cauldron.
Employ the work of gentle nurturing,
Guard against danger, contemplate peril,
Preserve this single spark of true numinosity
Within the furnace of creation.
The natural true fire
Steams and simmers of itself,
Transforming all yin,
Forging an indestructible vajra-body—
Only then is perfection attained.

Otherwise, once the Elixir has returned,
If one knows not contentment,
Clings to fullness without end,
And continues to stoke the fire,
Yang qi grows parched and desiccated,
The medicine withers and ages.
The true departs, the false arises,
What was gained is lost again—
Ruin and disgrace cannot be avoided.
Of old, Elder Pure Yang failed thrice to complete the Returned Elixir,
Elder Purple Clarity suffered midnight storms and thunder—
All due to this.

For civil refinement and martial tempering each have their time;
Yang fire and yin tally each have their wondrous use.
A hair’s breadth of error leads a thousand miles astray—
Can those who cultivate virtue not be cautious?

On the Two Heads of Life and Death:
Sixty-Two

Turn the door of death into the door of life,
Let not the gate of life be mistaken for the gate of death.
If one grasps the pivot of killing and reversal,
Only then does one know how harm gives rise to grace.

The gate of life and the door of death
Are originally one and the same—
The very portal of the Mysterious Pass.
Within this portal lies the qi of the Five Phases:
Follow their flow, and the Five Phases wound one another,
Each dwelling apart, the Five Virtues turned to Five Thieves—
The door of life becomes the door of death,
The gate of life becomes the gate of death.
Reverse their course, and the Five Phases engender one another,
Returning to a single qi, the Five Thieves transformed into Five Virtues—
The door of death becomes the door of life,
The gate of death becomes the gate of life.
The pivot of life and death lies solely in reversal.

If one grasps how to seek life within the mechanism of killing,
And wields reversal with skill,
Then harm gives rise to grace,
The door of death and the door of life may be transformed into the gate of life and the door of life—
Even in the face of death, one does not perish.

The door is reckoned by odd numbers, the gate by even;
When the door of death becomes the door of life, false yang departs and true yang arises;
When the gate of death becomes the gate of life, false yin retreats and true yin arises.
When true yin and true yang arise,
The two merge into one,
Restoring the original face of utmost goodness, free from evil.
Utmost goodness, free from evil, is the undifferentiated principle of Heaven,
Flowing ceaselessly, the vital mechanism ever abiding—
How could one not prolong life and extend years?

Sixty-Three

Disaster and fortune ever lie in mutual concealment,
Like shadow following form, echo chasing sound.
If one can reverse this pivot of life and death,
In the space between turning one’s palm, calamity becomes blessing.

The Way of resonance in the world:
When fortune departs, disaster comes; when disaster departs, fortune comes.
Disaster and fortune lie in mutual concealment,
Like shadow following form, echo chasing sound.
Those who cultivate the Dao, knowing how disaster and fortune lie in concealment,
May likewise know how life and death lie concealed within the self.
If one can reverse this pivot of life and death,
Seeking life within killing,
Then in the space between turning one’s palm, disaster becomes blessing—
No effort is wasted.

The pivot of life and death
Is the qi of the Five Phases inherent in the self.
When the qi of the Five Phases flows in sequence, virtue contains punishment, giving rise to the mechanism of killing;
When reversed, punishment contains virtue, giving rise to the mechanism of life.
Where the mechanism of life abides, the mechanism of killing perishes.
As the classic says:
*"When the Five Phases flow in sequence, the dharma-realm is a pit of fire;
When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields seven treasures."*
Between sequence and reversal, life and death hang in the balance.
The single word "reverse" holds great power—
None but those whose virtue joins with Heaven and Earth,
Whose brightness joins with sun and moon,
Can reverse it;
None but those whose order joins with the four seasons,
Whose auspices join with ghosts and spirits,
Can reverse it;
None but those who look down upon all things,
Seeing the emptiness of the myriad phenomena,
And take the Dao as their task,
Can reverse it.

Alas!
Not knowing is difficult, but acting is even more so—
How easily can the pivot of life and death be reversed?

On Blending with the World While Preserving One’s Radiance:
Sixty-Four

To cultivate the Dao while blending with the world, harmonizing one’s radiance—
Round when round, square when square.
Manifest or hidden, yielding or resisting, none can fathom;
How could others discern one’s concealment or display?

The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is luminous and upright.
To cultivate within the dust of the world,
To practice amid the bustle of the marketplace—
This is no petty path of seclusion, of fleeing the world to guard stillness.
One must blend with the world and harmonize one’s radiance,
Adapting to circumstance—round or square—
Manifest or hidden, yielding or resisting,
Concealing or revealing, empty or solid,
So that none can fathom—
Only then is it a great achievement, a profound mechanism.

Those who seek obscurity and indulge in eccentricity—
Whether sitting in meditation in the dharma hall,
Contemplating emptiness to still the mind,
Circulating qi or visualizing spirits,
Or manipulating essence and marrow,
Or tending the furnace for inner alchemy—
How dare they act in broad daylight, in places where all can see?
If they dare not act where all can see,
Their conduct is flawed, not true cultivation—
How could they fulfill their nature and destiny?

Of old, Bodhidharma saw that the divine land of the East possessed the aura of the Great Vehicle,
So he entered China to accomplish the great matter.
After Huineng received the transmission from the Fifth Patriarch,
He concealed himself among hunters in Sihui to attain fruition.
After Zixian received the transmission from Apricot Grove,
He went to the great cities and relied on the powerful to fulfill his nature and destiny.
Like these three sages, all blended with the world and harmonized their radiance,
Cultivating the Dao within the ways of the world—
Thus they became immortals and buddhas.
If one abandons the ways of the world, there is no Dao to cultivate.
Without the Dao, what can one practice to return to the root and revert to the origin,
To preserve life and perfect form?

Alas!
The celestial mechanism of blending with the world and harmonizing one’s radiance—
It may be spoken of to those who know,
But is difficult to convey to those who do not.

*Wuzhen Pian*, Direct Pointers, Scroll Three
Five-character quatrain (symbolizing the Supreme Unity containing true qi):

A maiden dons azure robes,
A gentleman wears white silk.
Seen, they cannot be used;
Used, they cannot be seen.
In the dim and indistinct, they meet;
In the distant and obscure, they transform.
In a flash, flames soar—
The true person emerges of itself.

Spiritual awareness is the yin within yang, possessing softness.
Nature governs life, pertains to wood—wood’s color is azure,
Hence, "a maiden dons azure robes."
True awareness is the yang within yin, possessing firmness.
Emotion governs restraint, pertains to metal—metal’s color is white,
Hence, "a gentleman wears white silk."

Yet nature and emotion have distinctions of precelestial and postcelestial.
The postcelestial is qi prevailing over deluded emotion,
The nature and emotion of conditioned qi—
Tangible and visible, they cannot be used.
The precelestial is the true emotion of original nature,
The nature and emotion of true emptiness—
Formless and imageless, they are what is used,
Yet cannot be seen.

Because they cannot be seen,
They reside in the dim and indistinct, the distant and obscure.
"Dim and indistinct," "distant and obscure"—
This is having qi without substance,
Invisible, inaudible, untouchable—
How could one congeal them to form the elixir?

Yet though invisible, inaudible, untouchable,
The nature of spiritual awareness and the emotion of true awareness
Sometimes meet in the dim and indistinct,
Transform in the distant and obscure.
At this moment of meeting and transformation,
Spirit and clarity withdraw in silence,
Gathered into the furnace of creation,
Refined with fire—
In an instant, precelestial qi
Emerges from the formless,
Congeals into form,
And the true person appears in the dark chamber.

This is the symbolic image of returning the elixir,
The so-called "elixir formed within an hour."
When the true person appears,
It is the union of true yin and true yang within,
A spark of life emerging—
This is the sacred embryo,
Not the ten-month gestation of a body beyond the body.

Could the appearance of a body beyond the body
Occur in an instant,
Transcending the womb and transforming the bones,
A body beyond the body?
This poem by the immortal elder symbolizes the Supreme Unity containing true qi.
If one asks about the meaning of the true person’s appearance,
I would say it is the Supreme Unity containing true qi.

*Twelve Western Rivers* (to symbolize the twelve months).
The immortal elder said:
"West is the direction of metal,
River is the body of water,
Moon is the function of the elixir."
First of the twelve.

The inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir,
When the inner is unobstructed, the outer must also be unobstructed.
The cinnabar head harmonizes as if of the same kind,
With two distinct functions in nurturing and refining.

Within resides the natural true fire,
In the furnace, blazing and ever-red.
The outer furnace’s increase and decrease demand diligent effort,
For nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed in subtlety.

The inner elixir is the numinous knowing of numinous nature,
The outer elixir is the true knowing of true essence.
As numinous knowing resides in the human heart,
When the heart takes charge, it borrows the numinous to generate delusion—hence the inner elixir.
As true knowing abides in the Dao-heart,
When the Dao-heart retreats, true knowing remains unmanifest—hence the outer elixir.
True knowing and numinous knowing are originally one family,
Emerging from the same source with different names—thus the inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir.

The inner elixir serves to cultivate nature, and one must thoroughly understand it;
The outer elixir serves to cultivate life, and one must also thoroughly understand it.
As the ancient scripture says:
"To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost flaw in practice,
To cultivate nature without cultivating life makes it difficult for the yin spirit to attain sagehood even after ten thousand kalpas."
Thus, when the inner is unobstructed, the outer must also be unobstructed.

Nature is yin, life is yang.
The great elixir of golden liquid is attained by taking the true yin and true yang—qi of the same kind from the two arcs—
And harmonizing them into one.
If one cultivates life without cultivating nature, or cultivates nature without cultivating life,
It is solitary yin or solitary yang, and the great elixir will not form—
Thus nature and life must be cultivated together.

Yet nature has its own function, and life has its own function;
Nature pertains to the Dharma-body, life to the illusory body.
The two functions of nurturing and refining differ greatly—
Thus the work must proceed in two stages.

The Dao of cultivating nature is the Dao of non-action,
Non-action emphasizes stillness, requiring no deliberate effort,
Only guarding the center and embracing the One.
Within the inner furnace, true fire naturally blazes, ever-red—
This is the use of the gentle fire for nurturing.

As for the Dao of cultivating life, it is the Dao of action;
Action emphasizes movement, requiring the outer furnace’s increase and decrease,
Diligent effort in forging and refining—
This is the use of the martial fire for decoction.

To increase is to augment the insufficiency of true knowing—
To firmly uphold what is good.
To decrease is to reduce the excess of numinous knowing—
To cast aside cleverness and destroy cunning.
When increase reaches its limit, and decrease reaches its end,
Nature stabilizes and life congeals, the true seed is attained—
Only then is it wondrous beyond compare.

These two functions of nature and life,
Once the outer elixir is accomplished,
Are gathered into the tripod to become the inner elixir.
For what has not yet arrived is outer, and what has arrived is inner—
Thus when metal returns to its original nature, it is called the returned elixir.

**Second**

This elixir is most divine and sacred,
Yet I fear your karmic endowment is too meager to bear it.
Harmonizing lead and mercury need not take a full morning—
Early signs of the mysterious pearl will soon appear.

If a determined practitioner can refine it,
Why not dwell in the marketplace or court?
The work is easy, the medicine not distant—
Yet if one reveals the secret, others may laugh.

The previous verse clarified the inner and outer elixirs;
This verse speaks of the practice of the outer elixir.
The Dao of the golden elixir is most divine and sacred,
Its cultivation yields immediate results, swiftly elevating one to sagehood—
But I fear one’s karmic endowment may be too shallow to receive it.

What is hardest to obtain in the golden elixir
Is the true lead of true knowing and the true mercury of numinous knowing.
If one recognizes true knowing and numinous knowing and harmonizes them,
Then hardness and softness balance, nature and essence become one.
Without waiting for a full morning,
The signs of innate knowing and innate ability will soon appear—
Like a dark pearl suddenly shining with light.

For the root of innate knowing and innate ability,
Buried for so long, cannot emerge on its own.
Now, with true knowing and numinous knowing united as one,
Though the root of innate knowing and innate ability may not yet be fully restored,
A spark of life already takes form in the realm of the indistinct and obscure.
With this spark of life, from subtle to manifest,
It can gradually be restored to wholeness.
The "signs" are the foretaste of wholeness.

If a determined practitioner diligently cultivates it,
There is no need to flee the world or leave the dust—
Why not dwell in the marketplace or court?
For the Dao of the golden elixir has its medicine ready at hand,
The work is simple and easy, requiring no external pursuit—
It lies within the very person.
Yet if one reveals it, others may laugh.

For laughter is the shared path of the mundane and the sage:
Heaven and humanity share the same principle—
The difference lies only in compliance or defiance.

**Third**

The White Tiger’s first classic is a supreme treasure,
The Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.
Know that the source of the highest good runs deep—
Not to be compared with ordinary medicines.

If one wishes to refine the ninefold transmutation,
First refine the self and hold the heart.
Follow the time to gather it, determining its floating or sinking,
Advance the fire with caution to avoid peril.

The previous verse spoke of harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir.
Yet to harmonize lead and mercury,
One must first recognize the great medicine of true knowing—true lead—
Before proceeding.

True knowing is true essence,
In symbolic terms, the White Tiger’s first classic,
Or the Flowery Pond’s divine water—
True essence hidden within delusive emotion.
Emotion pertains to metal, hence the White Tiger.
Though true essence is concealed within delusive emotion,
It sometimes reveals itself—
The heart of heaven and earth reappears, sprouting the seed of life—
Hence the first classic.

"First" means beginning, "classic" means the constant Dao.
The beginning of the constant Dao is the arising of something from nothing,
Yin containing yang, the mother of all things—
This is the spark of life.
This spark of life is the root of sagehood and worthiness,
The foundation of buddhahood and immortality—
Hence it is called the supreme treasure.

This spark of life is also called the Flowery Pond’s divine water.
The Flowery Pond is the single aperture of the primal pass, the gate of all wonders.
As it harbors the spark of life, it is called the Flowery Pond;
As this spark of life orders the hundred bones and cleanses the five viscera,
It is called divine water.

The spark of life, refined by fire and tempered, congeals without scattering, enduring unbroken—hence it is called true gold. The first classic, divine water, and true gold are all but one thing: the nature of supreme goodness.

Supreme goodness is perfect goodness. Perfect goodness is without evil, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs, like water with its source—deep-rooted and far-flowing, benefiting all things without exhaustion. This is the medicine that preserves life and completes form, the most authentic remedy, unlike ordinary medicines of herbs, trees, metals, or stones.

Yet this remedy lies hidden within the acquired, appearing only fleetingly, vanishing as soon as it arises, unable to remain long. If one wishes to refine it through nine cycles and make it eternally indestructible, one must first temper the self and hold the heart, dissolving the guest qi and worldly passions, gathering it at the proper time to stabilize its floating and sinking.

Awareness resides in the human heart; when the human heart stirs, awareness takes flight, tending to float. True knowing abides in the Dao-heart; when the Dao-heart is obscured, true knowing hides, tending to sink. Tempering the self and holding the heart means refining away the awareness of the human heart, causing the floating to sink. Gathering at the proper time means drawing forth the Dao-heart, causing the sinking true knowing to float.

Reversing floating and sinking, the Dao-heart governs the human heart, the human heart submits to the Dao-heart, true knowing commands awareness, and awareness nourishes true knowing. When the human heart is still and the Dao-heart abides, true knowing and awareness share the same qi, like branches of one tree—then the golden elixir may be attained.

Yet while the medicine is easy to recognize, the firing times are most difficult. The work of advancing the fire must discern whether the medicine is ripe or tender, whether the timing is urgent or leisurely, auspicious or inauspicious. If one acts recklessly, not only will there be no benefit, but harm will follow—hence it is said, "Advancing the fire, one must guard against great danger."

---

If you would have true lead retain mercury,
The lord must not part from his minister.
Wood and metal, though sundered, meet not by chance—
All depends on the matchmaker’s summoning.

Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,
Metal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness.
They devour and yet embrace each other,
Only then does the man-child conceive.

This verse speaks of gathering the medicine through the work of tempering the self. Tempering the self aims to bring the three families into union. The way of the golden elixir is simply the two words: firmness and softness.

The central firmness of firmness is true knowing, symbolized as true lead; the central softness of softness is awareness, symbolized as true mercury. Taking these two substances and uniting them forms the elixir. But if true knowing does not manifest, awareness easily scatters—thus true knowing is the substance that restrains awareness. Yet while true knowing can restrain awareness, awareness in turn nourishes true knowing—thus awareness is the minister of true knowing.

If awareness is not first stabilized, true knowing will not appear—hence it is said, "If you would have true lead retain mercury, the lord must not part from his minister." The lord refers to the union of true knowing and awareness, firmness and softness in harmony. True knowing is the sovereign; awareness is the minister. If the minister is disobedient, the sovereign cannot act.

For true knowing and awareness contend in the space of a hair’s breadth: when awareness is exhausted, true knowing appears; when true knowing abides, awareness submits. When true knowing abides, it is firm and strong; when awareness is still, it is soft and yielding. Firm strength and soft compliance—nature and feeling unite.

Thus the Dao of the elixir takes true lead and true mercury as its two medicinal ingredients. The lead of true knowing pertains to metal in its essence; the mercury of awareness pertains to wood in its nature. In the acquired, essence moves west and nature moves east. Like metal and wood, they are sundered, each in its own domain, unable to meet.

Were it not for true nature as the medium, true essence and true nature would not appear, true knowing and awareness would not unite. True sincerity is true intention, also called true earth. When true earth appears, metal and wood naturally merge; when true sincerity flows, nature and essence naturally unite—thus true sincerity is the matchmaker of true essence and true nature.

True nature is wood, governing compliance and kindness; true essence is metal, governing firmness and righteousness. When nature and essence are harmonized by sincerity within, wood’s nature loves metal’s essence and submits to righteousness, metal’s essence yearns for wood’s kindness. Nature and essence unite, firmness and softness respond, kindness and righteousness are complete, true knowing and awareness share the same qi.

They devour and yet embrace each other, nature settles and essence is forgotten. The qi of the primordial arises from emptiness, congealing into a single grain of millet—thus the sacred embryo takes form, what is called "the man-child conceives."

Who is the maiden of sixteen?

Where dwells the gentleman of nine-three?
He calls himself the liquid of wood and the essence of metal,
Yet when meeting earth, they form three lineages.
Only with Ding Gong’s forging and tempering
Do husband and wife first unite in joyous union.

The river chariot dares not pause for even a moment,
But carries them to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.

The preceding verse speaks of the three families meeting and the sacred embryo forming.
Yet without true fire’s forging and tempering, the sacred embryo cannot take shape.
Two is the number of yin fire, eight the number of yin wood—hence the maiden.
Nine is the number of yang metal, three the number of yang wood—hence the gentleman.
Wood’s liquid is fire, wood begetting fire as one lineage;
Metal’s essence is water, metal begetting water as one lineage;
Earth, dwelling at the center, forms its own lineage—thus the Five Phases divide into three lineages.
When the three lineages converge, they merge into one—this is called the Five Phases complete.

In the practice of the Dao, original nature and original spirit form the wood-fire lineage;
Original essence and original essence form the metal-water lineage;
Original qi forms the earth lineage—these are the inner three lineages.
Benevolence and ritual belong to wood-fire as one lineage,
Righteousness and wisdom belong to metal-water as another,
Trust belongs to earth as the third—these are the outer three lineages.
The cultivator governs the outer three lineages through the inner three,
And fulfills the inner three lineages through the outer three,
Ultimately uniting the three lineages into one as the culmination.

Yet these three lineages must be cultivated with courage and vigor,
With single-minded devotion and the resolve of death itself,
Before they can return to the one lineage.
Ding Gong’s forging and tempering is precisely this courageous and vigorous cultivation.
Through courageous and vigorous cultivation,
What lacks benevolence must attain benevolence,
What lacks righteousness must attain righteousness,
What lacks ritual must attain ritual,
What lacks wisdom must attain wisdom,
What lacks trust must attain trust.
Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom all return to the one trust,
While nature, essence, spirit, and essence transform into a single qi.
The three lineages harmonize, firmness and softness respond,
Nature and essence become as one—only then do husband and wife unite in joyous union.

Once husband and wife unite in joy,
The longer the union, the greater the effort,
The fire’s work unceasing,
A single qi achieves completion,
Inevitably reaching pure yang,
Silent and scentless, and only then does it cease.

Thus it is said: the river chariot dares not pause for even a moment,
But carries them to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.
The river chariot is the true qi of the north,
Not the alchemical notion of circulating kidney qi from the tailbone up the spine to the crown of the head.
Rather, it is the completion of a single qi,
With water aiding fire, fire and water simmering without interruption—
Like a waterwheel in a river,
Carrying water up and down,
Turning day and night without ceasing.
Kunlun is the ancestor of all mountains;
To carry it to the summit of Kunlun’s peak
Is the three flowers gathering at the crown,
The five qi returning to their origin,
Entering the state of true emptiness and wondrous being,
Unknowing and unperceiving,
Abiding in the realm where one follows the decree of the Emperor.

Its sixth:
Seven returns—cinnabar returns to its origin,
Nine returns—golden liquid returns to truth.

Do not count from *yin* to *shen* or from *zi* to *kun*—
Only let the Five Phases achieve their standard.
It is but a single taste of mercury,
Circulating through all the celestial stations.
When yin and yang’s numbers are complete, they naturally attain the numinous;
How could their entry and exit ever depart from the Mysterious Female?

The preceding verse speaks of the Five Phases clustering together,
Of applying fire to refine and temper—
Thus may success be achieved.
Yet refinement requires knowing the true principle of the seven returns and nine reversions.
Seven is the yang number of fire; nine, the yang number of metal.
The numinous knowing of essence is yielding, concealing within it deviant fire.
When deviant fire is consumed, true fire arises—
Like quicksilver congealing into cinnabar,
Forever becoming a substance neither flying nor scattering:
Fire has returned to its origin.
The true knowing of emotion is firm, containing within it dry metal.
When dry metal is transformed, true metal is purified—
Like impure metal refined into liquid,
Forever becoming the most limpid and luminous gold:
Metal has returned to its truth.

This is the meaning of the seven returns and nine reversions in the alchemical canon.
Yet those of heterodox schools,
Counting from *zi* to *shen* as nine reversions,
And from *yin* to *kun* as seven returns—
How could they know the meaning of seven returns and nine reversions?
Without knowing the meaning of seven returns and nine reversions,
How could they know when the Five Phases have achieved their standard?

When the Five Phases achieve their standard:
Fire returns to its origin, then from fire wood emerges, and the spirit becomes numinous.
Numinous, the knowing of essence remains undimmed.
Metal returns to truth, then from water metal is born, and essence becomes unified.
Unified, true knowing abides constantly.
The knowing of essence undimmed, true knowing constant—
True knowing is the knowing of essence; the knowing of essence is true knowing.
Metal, wood, water, fire—
The Four Images harmonize and merge,
Returning to the center.
The Five Phases become a single qi,
Neither biased nor partial,
Wholly the pattern of Heaven.
Thus the Five Phases achieve their standard.

Yet the work of achieving the Five Phases’ standard
Is entirely the great medicine of metal within water.
The mercury employed is metal within water—
Metal within water is still metal within water,
Ever the true emotion of true knowing.
True knowing contains within it the primordial true unity of qi,
The root of the Five Phases,
The origin of the Four Images.
In movement, it generates yang;
In stillness, it generates yin,
Circulating through the positions of the Four Images and Five Phases.
In the Dao of return and reversion,
When the time is yang, advance the yang fire to gather this true knowing;
When the time is yin, apply the yin tally to nurture this knowing.
When the numbers of yang fire and yin tally are complete,
The Five Phases blend and transform.
Good knowing and good ability,
Still and unmoving,
Yet responsive and instantly penetrating—
Naturally attaining the numinous.
The numinous is the unknowable of yin and yang.
When yin and yang are unknowable,
The sacred embryo congeals—
Called the Valley Spirit.
The Valley Spirit does not die;
This is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female
Is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
When the numbers of yin and yang are complete,
The Mysterious Female is established.
Once the Mysterious Female is established,
The Valley Spirit enters and exits through the gate of the Mysterious Female—
Attaining longevity without death,
The Dao of return and reversion is fulfilled.
As it is said:
“To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.”

---

Its seventh:
Within the male lies the essence of the female,
Embracing yin yet holding fast to yang’s essence.
When the two blend, the medicine is complete—
Transmuting the soul to refinement, the spirit to sanctity.

Trust in a single grain of the golden elixir:
A serpent that swallows it instantly becomes a dragon;
A chicken that feeds on it transforms into a *luan* or *peng*,
Soaring into the pure realm of true yang.

*(Alternative readings: "embracing yet holding fast," "the spirit to immortality, the soul to sanctity," "may also")*

The preceding verse speaks of seven returns and nine reversions,
Which require the numbers of yin and yang to be complete.
Yet in applying yin and applying yang,
One must recognize true yin and true yang.
Within the male lies the essence of the female:
In the hexagrams, this is the emptiness within *Li*;
In the human, it is the numinous knowing concealed within the human heart.
Embracing yin yet holding fast to yang’s essence:
In the hexagrams, this is the fullness within *Kan*;
In the human, it is the true knowing possessed by the heart of Dao.
True knowing and numinous knowing—
These two medicinal substances,
Only when blended can the elixir be formed.
The *po* is yang within yin, the spirit of true knowing;
The *hun* is yin within yang, the spirit of numinous knowing.
When the *po* is refined, yang is scant;
When the *hun* prevails, yin is excessive.
Scant yang and excessive yin—
Biased and not centered,
The golden elixir cannot form.
Only when true knowing and numinous knowing meet,
And the *hun* and *po* likewise return to the center,
Transforming into true nature and true emotion—
Yin and yang blend as one,
The pattern of Heaven shines forth,
Human desires vanish.
Good knowing and good ability,
Round and luminous,
Pure and bare,
Unadorned and free—
A single grain of the golden elixir,
Suspended in the great void,
Illuminates the three thousand great thousand worlds,
Transcending all directions, obstructions, and hindrances.

This elixir—
If a person swallows a single grain, they instantly become an immortal;
If a serpent swallows a grain, it too transforms into a dragon;
If a chicken feeds on a grain, it too becomes a *luan* or *peng*,
Soaring straight into the pure realm of true yang.
Yet the serpent swallowing and the chicken feeding
Also allegorize the method of the elixir.
The serpent pertains to fire, in the south as *Li*;
The dragon pertains to wood, in the east as *Zhen*.
The chicken is in the west, pertaining to metal as *Dui*;
The *luan* and *peng* are near water, in the north as *Kan*.
When the serpent swallows and becomes a dragon, wood emerges from fire;
When the chicken feeds and becomes a *luan* or *peng*, metal is born from water.
Wood emerging from fire, metal born from water—
Metal and wood intermingle,
Water and fire aid each other,
A single qi blends all,
Neither being nor non-being established,
Self and other return to emptiness.
Form and spirit both wondrously enter the sagely—
That which cannot be known is called the numinous.
Having shed the mortal world,
Dwelling in the realm of pure yang—
How could this be empty words?

---

Its eighth:
When Heaven and Earth first meet in *Pi* and *Tai*,
At dawn and dusk, keenly recognize *Zhun* and *Meng*.
Spokes gather at the hub as water flows east—
The wonder lies in the art of drawing and adding.

Attain the One, and all things are complete;
Do not divide north, south, east, or west.
Reduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work—
The treasure of life must not be lightly toyed with.

The Dao of the golden elixir
Is the Dao of creation and transformation.
The Dao of creation and transformation
Is the Dao of yin and yang.

Within the span of a year, in the month of *yin*, Heaven’s qi ascends while Earth’s qi descends, forming *Tai*; in the month of *shen*, Earth’s qi ascends while Heaven’s qi descends, forming *Pi*. Within the span of a day, the hour of *zi* marks the dawn’s beginning—at *zi*, yang qi stirs within as yin qi emerges outward, forming *Zhun*; the hour of *wu* marks the dusk’s beginning—at *wu*, yang qi halts without as yin qi arises within, forming *Meng*. *Pi* and *Tai* are the yearly ascent and descent of yin and yang in spring and autumn; *Zhun* and *Meng* are the daily ebb and flow of yin and yang at dawn and dusk. Observe the alternation of *Pi* and *Tai* as Heaven and Earth meet, and you will recognize the waxing and waning of *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk. For the daily rhythm of yin and yang mirrors the yearly rhythm of yin and yang. Yet whether in a year or a day, yin and yang are but a single qi, circulating in perpetual motion.

The cultivator of the Dao models the seasonal nodes of *Pi* and *Tai*, aligns with the moments of *Zhun* and *Meng* at dawn and dusk, advances the yang fire when yang arises, and moves the yin tally when yin prevails. Yang’s firmness and yin’s softness, timed without error, gather power and amass the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images. Like thirty spokes converging at the hub to form a wheel, like a thousand streams flowing together toward the sea, all becomes a single qi, and the golden elixir congeals. Though the marvel of the golden elixir’s congealment lies entirely in the art of drawing and adding: *drawing* removes false yin and false yang; *adding* replenishes true yin and true yang. When false yin departs, true yang appears; when false yang dissolves, true yin arises. True yin and true yang return to central equilibrium, merging into one. True knowing and numinous knowing unite, nature and emotion harmonize, and the original face of innate knowledge and innate ability is restored. How wondrous is the work of drawing and adding!

In cultivating the elixir, one must first discern true yin and true yang, and further recognize the primordial, undifferentiated qi of the One. This qi existed before the chaos of *Hongmeng* divided, when yin and yang had not yet separated. Contained, it is true emptiness; expressed, it is wondrous existence. Its image is gold within water; its essence is Heaven’s inherent goodness; its function is the mind of the Dao, rooted in essence and unity. The elixir method seeks only this single great medicine of the Dao-mind. Though this Dao-mind is but one flavor, it governs the qi of the Five Phases and embodies their virtues. For the Dao-mind arises from the water of the One—the beginning of all numbers—one containing five, five returning to one. Yet when it returns to the One, it can no longer be called the Dao-mind, but only the undifferentiated principle of Heaven.

Thus the Confucians call this undifferentiated principle the Supreme Ultimate; the Daoists call it the golden elixir; the Buddhists call it perfect enlightenment. The ancient scriptures’ saying, “Attain the One, and all things are complete,” refers precisely to this. Once the One is attained, the treasure of life is already in hand, and there is no need to distinguish north, south, east, or west, nor to employ the method of amassing and gathering. One need only guard the Dao-mind against the human mind, reducing and reducing again. All guest qi of the human mind must be transformed away, leaving only the soft, compliant numinous knowing—then the human mind, too, becomes the Dao-mind.

For the human mind is inhabited by the consciousness-spirit, which carries the impressions of past kalpas, the accumulated habits of this life, and the perverse qi of one’s physical constitution. If these roots of calamity are not entirely diminished, even a trace left behind may seize an opportunity to arise, causing leaks in the treasure of life and wasting all prior effort. Hence the caution: “guard the prior work,” and “the treasure of life must not be lightly toyed with.” The ancient immortals said: “If a single speck of yang qi remains, one does not die; if a single speck of yin qi remains, one does not ascend.” Thus, after obtaining the elixir, one must uproot the seeds of beginningless kalpas and the cycle of birth and death, ensuring the treasure of life belongs entirely to oneself and remains eternally unbroken.

Its ninth:
At the winter solstice, the yang returns with one yang line;
Over three decades, each line adds one yang.

At mid-month, the *Fu* hexagram returns with the morning tide at the new moon,
When the full moon wanes, the *Qian* ends and the *Gou* portends.
The sun further divides into cold and heat,
Yang revives at midnight, rising again in the middle of the night.
At noon, the *Gou* hexagram appears as one yin arrives—
In refining the elixir, one must know dusk and dawn.

The preceding verse speaks of the work of drawing out and adding,
Teaching one to emulate the creative transformations of heaven and earth at dusk and dawn.
In a year’s cycle of dusk and dawn:
At the winter solstice of the eleventh month, one yang is born,
Each thirty days adding one yang line.
Thus, in the eleventh month, the *zi* branch sees one yang born, forming *Fu* (䷗);
In the twelfth month, the *chou* branch sees two yang born, forming *Lin* (䷒);
In the first month, the *yin* branch sees three yang born, forming *Tai* (䷓);
In the second month, the *mao* branch sees four yang born, forming *Da Zhuang* (䷡);
In the third month, the *chen* branch sees five yang born, forming *Guai* (䷪);
In the fourth month, the *si* branch sees six yang born, forming *Qian* (䷀)—
These are the six yang hexagrams.
By the fifth month, the *wu* branch sees one yin born, forming *Gou* (䷫),
Each month adding one yin line for thirty days.
In the sixth month, the *wei* branch sees two yin born, forming *Dun* (䷠);
In the seventh month, the *shen* branch sees three yin born, forming *Pi* (䷋);
In the eighth month, the *you* branch sees four yin born, forming *Guan* (䷌);
In the ninth month, the *xu* branch sees five yin born, forming *Bo* (䷖);
In the tenth month, the *hai* branch sees six yin born, forming *Kun* (䷁)—
These are the six yin hexagrams.
The six yang months are dawn; the six yin months are dusk—
This is the dusk and dawn of a year.

Within a single month, between the dark and new moon,
The sun and moon conjoin, the moon receives the sun’s light,
And after three days, yang light begins to emerge from the sea,
The tides responding as *Fu*.
Every two and a half days, one yang line is added.
By the fifteenth day, the moon and sun face each other,
Its radiance full and round as *Qian*.
From the first to the fifteenth day—these are the six yang hexagrams.
When the full moon wanes and *Qian* ends,
From the sixteenth to the eighteenth day, one yin is born,
The yang light waning as *Gou* begins to portend.
Every two and a half days, one yin line is added.
By the thirtieth day, the moon’s light is entirely gone,
Leaving only its dark body as *Kun*.
From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day—these are the six yin hexagrams.
Two and a half days make one *hou*,
Twelve *hou* traverse the six yang and six yin hexagrams—
This is the dusk and dawn of a month.

Within a single day, it further divides into cold and heat.
Each day at midnight, the *zi* hour, one yang is born as *Fu*,
Each hour adding one yang line.
By the *si* hour, six yang are born as *Qian*.
At noon, one yin is born as *Gou*,
Each hour adding one yin line,
By the *hai* hour, six yin are born as *Kun*.
The twelve hours traverse the six yin and six yang hexagrams—
This is the dusk and dawn of a day.

The sage transposes the yin-yang dusk and dawn of a year into a month,
The yin-yang dusk and dawn of a month into a day,
And the yin-yang dusk and dawn of a day into a single hour.
One hour has eight *ke*,
Each *ke* fifteen *fen*,
Eight *ke* totaling one hundred twenty *fen*.
The first four *ke* (sixty *fen*) are the six yang,
The latter four *ke* (sixty *fen*) are the six yin.
Further transposing the yin-yang dusk and dawn of an hour into a single *ke*,
Dividing it into fifteen *fen*:
The first seven and a half *fen* are yang,
The latter seven and a half *fen* are yin.
Within a fleeting moment, the great medicine is gathered,
Returned to the crucible of creation,
Refined with yang fire and yin tally into the elixir—
This is what is meant by “within the unbroken hour, distinguish *zi* and *wu*;
within the hexagrams, separate *Qian* and *Kun*.”
One must only recognize the dusk and dawn of yin’s birth and yang’s birth.
Knowing dusk and dawn,
The creative transformations of a day, a month, a year
Are present within a single hour and *ke*.
Those blind fools of the world,
Some sit in *zi-wu* meditation for a day,
Some practice qi circulation at the new and full moon,
Some cultivate at the winter and summer solstices—
How could they understand the principle of dusk and dawn?

---

Its tenth:
Without discerning the Five Phases and Four Images,
How can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver?
Before ever hearing of the firing times of elixir refinement,
They rashly claim reclusive mastery.
Unwilling to reflect on their own errors,
They further teach others their mistaken path,
Leading them astray into eternal delusion—
How can such heartless deceit be endured?

The preceding verse speaks of the need to know yin-yang dusk and dawn in elixir refinement;
This verse follows closely, addressing those who do not understand yin-yang dusk and dawn.
The Dao of immortality originally aims to perfect oneself and then others,
To cultivate the Way and then virtue.
Yet those lost on the path
Do not grasp the true principles of the Five Phases and Four Images,
Nor comprehend the allegories of cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver.
Unclear about the medicine, ignorant of the firing times,
They dabble in peripheral minor arts,
Presuming themselves enlightened and claiming reclusive mastery.
Unwilling to reflect on their own errors,
They further teach others their mistaken path,
One blind man leading many blind—
Misguiding others into eternal delusion,
Never to transcend.
Such heartless deceit
Condemns them to the Avīci Hell,
With no hope of escape—
How can they ever attain the Dao?

---

Its eleventh:
Virtue cultivated beyond eight hundred,
Hidden merits accumulated to three thousand.
Equalizing self and others, friend and foe,
Only then does one fulfill the immortal’s original vow.
Tigers and rhinos cannot harm,
The inescapable fire and burning house cannot bind.
After the treasure talisman descends, one ascends to heaven,
Steadily riding the phoenix chariot and simurgh carriage.

The preceding verse speaks of peripheral paths and external teachings,
Those who obscure the Dao and only harm virtue, unable to cultivate it.
This verse speaks of cultivating the Way and then necessarily cultivating virtue.
Cultivating the Way is the work of self-perfection;
Cultivating virtue is the work of benefiting others.
The cultivation of the Way has limits,
But the cultivation of virtue is boundless.
Thus, after attaining the immortal Dao,
One must fulfill three thousand merits,
Complete eight hundred deeds,
Forget self and others,
Treat friend and foe as one—
Measuring with heaven and earth,
Encompassing the ten thousand things,
Virtue and power both perfected,
Only then is the original vow fulfilled.
At this stage,
Inner and outer are both empty,
Existence and non-existence are not established,
Form and spirit both wondrous—
Tigers and rhinos cannot harm,
Blades and weapons cannot touch,
The inescapable fire and burning house cannot bind.

When the celestial talisman descends to summon,
Steadily rides the phoenix chariot and simurgh carriage,
Ascending in broad daylight—
A true man’s work accomplished, name achieved,
How joyous indeed!

The twelfth:
The love between Cowherd and Weaver Girl stems from Daoist affinity,
Tortoise and snake naturally share kindred endowment.
Toad and crow meet at new and full moons in harmonious union,
The two qi mutually nourish and revolve.
This is but the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth—
Who grasps this true essence?
When yin and yang are blocked and estranged, faults arise;
How then can one attain the enduring constancy of heaven and earth?

*(One version reads "abyss" for "true essence.")*
The above eleven lyrics all speak of the Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar,
Which requires the union of true yin and true yang, medicines of the same kind,
To form the elixir.
Yet some may suspect this is forced fabrication—
In truth, it is not forced but the natural operation of the Way.
Thus, this lyric summarizes the preceding meaning,
Urging practitioners to thoroughly investigate the underlying principle.
For instance, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet on the seventh night,
Tortoise and snake unite by kind,
Toad and crow conjoin at dark and full moons—
All are the mutual resonance of yin and yang,
Their natural union,
The wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth’s creation.
For the Dao of Heaven and Earth is the Dao of one yin, one yang.
Yin and yang mutually sustain each other,
A single qi flowing ceaselessly—
Yin becomes yang, yang becomes yin,
Yin and yang alternate,
The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born,
Life’s vitality unending,
Thus enduring through all ages.
If a cultivator fails to grasp this true essence,
Abandons the principle of yin-yang creation,
Clings to emptiness or fixates on forms,
Forces actions unnaturally,
They will only deepen the estrangement of yin and yang.
Not only will this fail to benefit life and destiny,
But it will harm them.
How can one avoid faults and transgressions,
Yet still hope for the enduring constancy of heaven and earth,
To become an immortal beyond death?
Is this possible? No.

The Dao of heaven’s constancy and earth’s endurance
Is the Dao of true yin and true yang in union.
When true yin and true yang unite,
Vital energy flourishes within,
Congealing the sacred embryo.
From non-being to being,
From being to non-being,
Shedding the illusory body to emerge in the true body—
Only then can one attain the enduring constancy of heaven and earth.
If a cultivator seeks this enduring constancy,
Apart from true yin and true yang, there is no other method.

*Appended: "Moon Over the West River" (to symbolize the moon’s radiance)*
The elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form,
Refined, it transforms endlessly.
Further, delve into the true origin of nature,
And master the wondrous function of non-arising.
No need to await another life—
Before one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.
Ever since the Dragon Girl accomplished this work,
Who since has been able to follow in her footsteps?

This lyric and the five following quatrains,
According to the Immortal Elder’s preface,
Are not part of the main collection of *Awakening to Reality*,
But belong to the external collection.
Examining their meaning,
They expound the Dao of first cultivating life, then cultivating nature.
The three commentaries by Xue, Lu, and Chen,
Because they discuss the cultivation of life,
Include them in the main collection—here, we follow their example.

Master Yuanduzi said:
"A single spark of yang essence,
Hidden within the mountain of form,
Not in the heart or kidneys,
But in the primordial pass of the One Aperture."
This single spark of yang essence is the elixir.
Hidden within the mountain of form,
It is the supreme treasure of the physical body.
The elixir is no other thing—
It is the primordial, supremely yang spark of essence,
Also called the primordial true unity of qi,
Or the vast and upright qi.
Concealed, it is true emptiness;
Manifest, it is wondrous being.
Its substance is innate goodness,
Its function is the mind of Dao—
The supreme treasure within the human form,
Not a thing possessed by heart or kidneys,
But stored within the primordial pass.
The One Aperture of the primordial pass
Has no location, no place,
No form, no image.
This elixir, too, has no location, no place,
No form, no image.
It moves and rests freely,
Unbound by form or emptiness,
Vibrant and alive,
Like refining fire forging something solid.
Constantly responsive, constantly still,
Constantly still, constantly responsive,
Transforming endlessly,
Its wonders unfathomable.
Though even heaven and earth’s spirits cannot grasp it,
It resides within the physical form,
Able to transmute it—
This is what is called the Dharma-body.
Thus, the ancient immortals said,
"The creation of life depends on the body."
Depending on the body means depending on the Dharma-body.
When the Dharma-body is accomplished,
The sacred embryo is complete,
The foundation of life is firm.
With the work of effort completed,
The work of non-effort becomes manifest—
Then one may cultivate nature.
The true origin of nature is the wondrous function of non-arising.
Cultivating life enables longevity,
Cultivating nature enables non-arising—
Non-arising means no death.
Without arising, without ceasing,
One becomes one with the Great Void,
Form and spirit both wondrous,
Forever freed from the cycle of rebirth,
Transcending beyond heaven and earth.
No need to await another life—
Before one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.

For the Dao of non-arising is sudden awakening and perfect penetration,
All things empty,
Directly transcending to the other shore.
At the assembly on Vulture Peak,
The World-Honored One expounded the Dharma.
A seven-year-old Dragon Girl emerged from the earth,
Offered a precious pearl,
And instantly attained Buddhahood.
The Immortal Elder cites the case of the Dragon Girl offering the pearl
To illustrate the cultivation of the true emptiness of nature.
Cultivating the true emptiness of nature
Is like the Dragon Girl offering the pearl.
Awakening to true emptiness,
Without arising, without ceasing,
Is attaining the spiritual powers of the Buddha.
Yet if the principle of life remains uncultivated,
The principle of nature is difficult to complete.
Difficult to complete means that,
Though one may attain sudden awakening and perfect penetration,
And nurture the true nature,
One still moves within the postnatal realm,
Having not undergone the great fire’s refinement,
With slight leaks remaining,
And thus cannot avoid the peril of discarding one body only to enter another.
After cultivating life, one then cultivates nature.
Emerging from the great furnace’s refinement,
All impurities are transformed.
From this point, one practices the Dao of non-effort to cultivate nature,
Progressing gradually to suddenness,
Ascending directly to the most supreme, wondrous awakening—
How then could one discard one body only to enter another?
Thus it is said:
No need to await another life—
Before one’s eyes, attain the spiritual powers of the Buddha.

One knows then that in the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, one first cultivates life before cultivating nature. Five seven-character quatrains are presented, corresponding to the Five Phases of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.

**I**
Though you may comprehend the Suchness of True Thusness,
You still cannot avoid discarding one body only to enter another.
Why not further refine the Great Medicine?
Then suddenly transcend the leakless and become a true person.

The Suchness of True Thusness is the celestial truth in its natural state, utterly free from contrivance, a nature neither form nor emptiness—what is called "not knowing, not perceiving, yet accordant with the Emperor’s decree." To cultivate this nature, one must first awaken to it; having awakened to it, one must then refine it into an indestructible vajra-substance, only then can one attain liberation. If one has awakened but does not refine, life remains subject not to oneself but to heaven; when the great limit arrives, with nothing to sustain one, discarding one body to enter another cannot be avoided. After sudden awakening, one does not abandon the work of gradual cultivation: employing the yang fire and yin tally to refine the Great Medicine, transmuting the host of yin, shedding the borrowed vessel, and revealing the true body. Then one enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning, is unharmed by tigers or rhinoceroses, untouched by blades or weapons, and becomes a leakless true person. In former times, after the Sixth Patriarch received transmission from the Fifth, he concealed himself among hunters in Sihui, blending with the world while preserving his light, and thus attained the true fruit. Zixian suddenly awakened to perfect penetration, yet knew this was not the ultimate matter; only after receiving transmission from Apricot Grove did he achieve great completion—all for the sake of refining the Great Medicine. If awakening to True Thusness were itself enlightenment, then what did the Fifth Patriarch transmit to the Sixth in the dead of night after the latter had awakened to "fundamentally not a single thing"? And why did Zixian, having suddenly awakened to perfect penetration, still seek out Apricot Grove? One knows then that sudden awakening and gradual cultivation are indispensable, whether one first awakens suddenly and then cultivates gradually, or first cultivates gradually and then awakens suddenly. Nature and life must be cultivated together, and the work must proceed in two stages. This verse moves from nature to life, from suddenness to gradualness.

**II**
Entering the womb, seizing the dwelling, or relocating—
Those who abide in the old are called the Four Fruits’ followers.
If you can subdue the dragon and tame the tiger,
When will the house built of true gold ever wither?

Entering the womb means foreseeing a pregnant woman of wealth and nobility and, at the moment of her delivery, entering the womb oneself. Seizing the dwelling means that when a pregnant woman is about to give birth, a yin spirit always waits to enter the aperture; one preempts it and enters first, seizing the dwelling. Relocating means that when one’s body decays, one selects a robust living person and secretly exchanges bodies. Abiding in the old means that when a robust person dies suddenly, one borrows the warm corpse and enters the aperture, residing in the old dwelling. Entering the womb and seizing the dwelling are largely the same with minor differences; relocating and abiding in the old are also largely the same with minor differences. All four involve the adept manipulation of the yin spirit for free entry and exit. Buddhists call these the Four Fruits’ followers, also known as external paths, derived from the teachings of the Two Vehicles, not the supreme vehicle of awakening to True Thusness. Their distinction from ordinary people lies merely in their clarity of coming and going. In the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, when the eastern household is subdued, the dragon of true nature is tamed in the western household; the tiger of true emotion returns emotion to nature and nurtures emotion with nature. When nature and emotion unite, dragon and tiger meet, giving birth to the sixteen-foot Dharma-body, like a house built of true gold, enduring as long as heaven and earth, forever an unwithering substance—how could there be any matter of moving from this to that?

**III**
The method of inspecting form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit—
Arduous for beginners, yet smooth for those who follow.

Swiftly one may wander all lands in an instant—
Yet why abandon the old house only to relocate?

**Inspecting form** means suspending a mirror on the wall,
concentrating spirit within,
until over time the yin-spirit emerges outward.
**Closing breath** begins with holding one or two breaths,
then ten or a hundred,
gradually extending to never exhaling,
so that qi circulates internally of itself.
**Contemplating spirit** may involve silently paying homage to the Supreme Emperor,
or ascending a cloud-ladder to manifest the sacred,
or envisioning the spirit exiting through the fontanel,
or the spirit emerging from the Hall of Light—
such methods are myriad.
Though difficult for beginners,
the path becomes smooth with practice.
Over years and months,
the yin-spirit may indeed venture outward,
but it remains solitary yin.
When qi and blood decline,
abandoning this body for another—
what benefit does it bring to one’s nature and life?

**IV**
The Śākya teachings urge cultivation of the Land of Ultimate Bliss,
for Ultimate Bliss is the golden quarter.
Of all forms and appearances, only this is real—
the other two are not true, mere idle speculation.

Ultimate Bliss lies in the west, the west being the golden quarter;
in human terms, it is the emotion of steadfast true knowing.
This emotion is firm, pure, and unyielding,
like gold’s nature—utterly hard, enduring without decay.
Cultivating Ultimate Bliss is cultivating this true knowing,
this true gold.
When true gold is refined,
it possesses both hardness and pliability,
all dross transformed,
its body radiant with light,
becoming the supreme treasure.
Of old, Dipamkara cultivated it to manifest the jeweled pagoda,
Śākyamuni cultivated it to manifest the sixteen-foot golden body—
among all forms and appearances,
only forging this steadfast, true-knowing emotion yields true treasure.
All else is not real—mere idle speculation.

**V**
The common saying holds that ordinary speech accords with the supreme Dao—
one ought to seek within it with care.
If in daily life one inverts the search,
every mote of dust on earth becomes treasure.

The Dao is not distant from humanity,
yet humanity, in pursuing the Dao, distances itself from it.
For the Dao of nature and life is the constant Dao.
The constant Dao is the Dao of daily use—
only the common folk employ it daily without awareness.
To cultivate nature and life,
one must exhaust the principles of the constant Dao.
If one truly delves deeply into its principles,
there is no need to read a thousand scriptures or ten thousand classics—
even in the common sayings of everyday speech,
great revelations of the celestial mechanism lie hidden.
For instance, praising a good person, one says:
*"An honest person, an upright person, one with conscience,
one with Heaven’s principle, one with dignity,
one who knows contentment, who knows advance and retreat,
who considers past and future, who is open to all directions,
who stands on solid ground."*
Condemning a wicked person, one says:
*"Not a person, without conscience, without Heaven’s principle,
harming others to benefit oneself, deceiving oneself and others,
injuring Heaven and violating principle,
finding joy in suffering, passing off falsehood as truth,
forgetting this and losing that, grasping east while forgetting west,
unaware of life and death, unable to discern good from bad,
knowing only oneself and not others,
knowing only one side and not the other."*
Such phrases are spoken without intent,
yet savored with meaning.
Why not take one or two from these common sayings
and delve into them,
extracting a key insight?
If in the midst of daily conduct one inverts the search,
then every mote of dust on earth is true treasure,
everywhere the Dao,
left or right—
all is fitting.

Scholars of the world all claim the Dao cannot be spoken of, yet refuse to apply solid, grounded effort to exhaustively investigate the principles of nature and life. Nor can they humble themselves to seek guidance from teachers and friends; even if they do seek guidance, they fail to do so with earnest sincerity. Lacking any foundation of their own, they attempt to conjure treasure from empty hands. Such conduct—even if one spends a lifetime as a renunciate, wandering to the ends of the earth—what use is it?

*Wuzhen Xingzong Zhizhi*, Scroll Four
The *Xingzong* is an appendix to the *Wuzhen Pian*. After completing the *Wuzhen Pian*, the Immortal Elder, fearing that the directly awakened nature of the original source might remain insufficiently explored, composed additional songs, odes, and miscellaneous verses, appending them to the end to complete the Way of dual cultivation of nature and life.

Four Quatrains

**I**
The Tathāgata’s wondrous body pervades the Ganges’ sands,
Myriad forms, vast arrays—unobstructed, unimpeded.
When one attains the true Dharma-eye of perfect penetration,
Only then does one know the Three Realms are one’s home.

The Tathāgata neither comes from anywhere nor goes anywhere—it is the nature of true emptiness. True emptiness is not empty, and thus its body is supremely wondrous. The nature of true emptiness has no inherent form; it is because it inwardly contains wondrous existence that wondrousness becomes its body. If emptiness were not wondrous, it would be mere quiescent, inert emptiness—not the true nature of the Tathāgata. How could it pervade the Ganges’ sands? How could the myriad forms be unobstructed and unimpeded?

Because it is wondrous and not empty, its body pervades the Ganges’ sands, nowhere impassable. Because it is empty and truly so, the myriad forms, vast arrays, cannot obstruct or impede it. Because it pervades the Ganges’ sands without obstruction or impediment, it is called the Dharma-eye of perfect penetration.

Perfect means without beginning or end, without front or back, without above or below, without inside or outside—it is the Tathāgata. Penetrating means present everywhere, manifest at all times, vast enough to fill heaven and earth, minute enough to be as fine as a hair—it is the wondrous body. Only the perfect can penetrate; only through penetration is it perfect. Radiant and luminous, illuminating all circumstances, nothing can harm it. Thus, attaining the Dharma-eye is the treasury of the true Dharma-eye.

When one attains this Dharma-eye of perfect penetration, one directly sees the Tathāgata’s wondrous body. Then, it is neither form nor emptiness—form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Heaven and hell are swept away entirely. The Three Realms are one’s home; the ten directions are one’s whole body.

**II**
Look and its form cannot be seen,
Yet when called, it responds at once.

Do not say this sound is like an echo in the valley—
if there were no valley, what sound would there be?
Look and its form cannot be seen—it is emptiness;
call and it responds at once—it is being.
From emptiness arises being, like an echo answering the valley.
Yet emptiness that is not empty—this is like the Tathāgata’s wondrous body.

But the Tathāgata’s wondrous body is ever empty, ever present,
ever present, ever empty—why must one call before it responds?
That which responds to a call still harbors emptiness.
Where emptiness remains, it is still bound by emptiness.
Emptiness that does not penetrate cannot be the Tathāgata’s wondrous body.
Better to take this thing called emptiness and shatter it with a single blow.
When emptiness is no longer emptiness, whence comes sound?
Without sound, emptiness too ceases to be.
No emptiness, no sound—this is great liberation, great freedom,
living and unbounded.

They say: "One who halts at the top of a hundred-foot pole has entered,
yet this is not true entry.
Take another step from the hundred-foot pole,
and the ten directions become one’s whole body."

**III**
One thing contains hearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing—
all sense realms reveal its mechanism.
Yet this ever-luminous one thing is not truly existent—
on what do the four depend?

Hearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing—
all arise from the radiant, luminous mind-essence.
Because this one thing is ever luminous,
the four conspire in the sense realms, ceaselessly active.

If one could remove this ever-luminous one thing,
the four would have no ground and would vanish of themselves.
All deluded beings fail to recognize
the Tathāgata’s true nature as true emptiness and wondrous being.
They take this radiant, luminous mind-essence as real,
either negating this thing or clinging to it.
Yet they do not know this thing is the root of birth and death,
the seed of kalpas of saṃsāra.
If one does not uproot this thing entirely,
how can one recognize the Tathāgata’s true nature?
This is what is meant by: "The root of birth and death through countless kalpas—
fools call it the original person."

**IV**
Without moving a step, one reaches the Western Heaven—
all directions sit plainly before one’s eyes.
Light behind the neck is still illusion;
clouds beneath the feet are not yet immortality.

The Tathāgata’s true nature has no head, no tail,
no back, no front.
Meet it and you do not see its beginning;
follow it and you do not see its end.
Speak of its being, and it seems not to exist;
speak of its non-being, and it is present.

Not falling into the forms of being or non-being,
its light penetrates the obscure and reaches the luminous,
able to illumine the three thousand great thousand worlds—
this is the wondrous awakening of the natural,
not something produced by sitting meditation.

All those who engage in meditation and seated practice,
who belong to the school of the discriminating mind,
seeing some illusory scenes or false appearances—
whether dreaming of journeying to the Western Heaven,
or generating light behind the neck,
or entering profound darkness yet perceiving various objects,
or becoming lost in trance with clouds rising beneath their feet—
mistake these for the attainment of true fruition and Buddhahood,
missing the mark by far.

Those with aspiration for the Dao must first sweep away
all heterodox side paths and external teachings,
then in the realm of formlessness and colorlessness,
investigate to uncover the true, wondrous awakening.
Only then can the fundamental nature be delivered.

**Verse on the Ground of Nature**
Buddha-nature is neither same nor different;
a thousand lamps share one light.
To add to it brings no benefit;
to subtract from it causes no harm.
Taking and discarding both pass without fault;
burning and flooding cannot obstruct.
The dharmas of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—
not one can be fathomed.

The verse is called "Ground of Nature,"
for the true nature’s essence is like the earth—
unmoving, unshaken, whether called same or different.
Though circumstances and things are myriad,
respond to all with a mind of equality,
as a thousand lamps shine—
lamps may differ, but the light is one.

This nature admits no increase, no decrease,
no taking, no discarding.
Fire may burn, water may flood—
nothing can impede it,
just as the earth bears the weight of mountains,
endures the rush of waters,
and contains all things, whether harmed or whole.

The earth is thus; the nature is thus.
Seeing, hearing, knowing, perceiving—
all are fundamentally empty.
Yet this emptiness is not annihilation,
but meeting things with things,
adapting to square and round,
responding with a mind of no-mind.

**Verse on Birth and Extinction**
Seeking birth is itself without birth;
fearing extinction, what has ever temporarily ceased?
Seeing with the eyes is not like hearing with the ears;
speaking with the mouth cannot compare to speaking with the nose.

The Tathāgata’s true nature is originally without birth or extinction.
Those who forcefully seek birth and fear extinction—
when have they ever been born without perishing?
Where there is birth, there is extinction;
only where there is no birth is there no extinction.

Because its fundamental nature is without birth or extinction,
it cannot be seen with the eyes, only heard with the ears;
it cannot be spoken with the mouth, only spoken with the nose.
What is seen with the eyes and spoken with the mouth
belongs to the nature of birth and extinction.
What is heard with the ears and spoken with the nose
belongs to the nature without birth or extinction.

What is seen with the eyes and spoken with the mouth is not the nature;
only what is heard with the ears and spoken with the nose is the nature.
Seeing without seeing is true seeing;
speaking without speaking surpasses all speech.

For this nature without birth or extinction
has no head, no crown, no back, no face;
it is neither being nor non-being, neither emptiness nor form.
What is there to see? What is there to say?
If it can be seen or spoken, it is not the true empty nature.

**Verse on the Three Realms as Mind Only**
The three realms are mind alone—wondrous principle;
the myriad things are neither this nor that.
No single thing is not my mind;
no single thing is my self.

The three realms are the form realm, the desire realm, and the formless realm.
The form and desire realms are realms of mind.
The formless realm is a realm without mind.
Whether with mind or without mind—
neither is the Buddha-nature.

The verse is called "The Three Realms as Mind Only,"
neither being nor non-being,
where both being and non-being are not established,
and self and other all return to emptiness.

The mind without mind is called the true mind;
the true mind’s mind is one body with the myriad things,
without division of self and other.
"No single thing is not my mind"—
this is not clinging to emptiness.
"No single thing is my self"—
this is not clinging to form.

Not clinging to emptiness, not clinging to form—
only mind alone.
One mind is one nature;
mind is Buddha, Buddha is mind.

**Verse on Seeing the Mind in Things**
See things and you see the mind;
without things, the mind does not appear.
Within the ten directions’ openness and obstruction,
the true mind pervades all.

If you generate intellectual understanding,
you fall into inverted views.
Perceiving conditions without mind—
only then do you see the face of bodhi.

"See things and you see the mind;
without things, the mind does not appear"—
this is the mind of those with knowledge and perception.
"Within the ten directions’ openness and obstruction,
the true mind pervades all"—
this is the true mind without knowledge or perception.

The human mind arises and ceases with things’ presence and absence;
the true mind’s numinous light is ever bright.
With things, it is this; without things, it is this.
In the ten directions’ openness and obstruction,
there is nowhere it is not.
It neither arises nor ceases,
unlike the human mind with knowledge and perception.

If you interpret the true mind with knowledge and perception,
you mistake a thief for your son—
an inverted view, greatly mistaken.

For the true mind is round and luminous,
pure and bare, bright and free,
neither separate from nor attached to conditions.
If one can perceive conditions without mind,
this is the true mind, the original face of bodhi—
no need to seek the original face of bodhi elsewhere.

In short, only without the human mind
can one see the true mind.
Once the true mind is seen,
one immediately realizes bodhi
and suddenly transcends the other shore.

**Verse on Equalizing Things**
I am not different from others;
others’ minds differ of themselves.
People have close and distant relations;
I have no self and other.
Water, land, and flying beings—
all are viewed as one body.
Noble and base, high and low—
hands and feet are the same as oneself.

I am not even myself—
how could there be a you?
When self and other both vanish,
all bubbles return to water.

The verse is called "Equalizing Things."
Close and distant relations, self and other,
water, land, and flying beings,
noble and base, high and low—
all are equally manifested.

The emphasis lies in the line "I am not even myself."
The reason people cannot equalize things
is because of the existence of an "I."
If one can be without self,
how would one know there is a "you"?
When self and other are both forgotten,
the myriad things are all empty—
not equalized, yet naturally equal.

**Verse on "The Mind Itself Is Buddha"**

The Buddha is mind, the mind is Buddha—
mind and Buddha have ever been illusory things.
Only when you know there is no Buddha, no mind,
do you become the true Dharma-body Buddha.

The Dharma-body Buddha has no form,
a single sphere of radiance containing all images.
The formless form is the true form,
the imageless image is the true image.

Neither form nor emptiness, nor non-emptiness,
neither movement nor stillness, neither coming nor going.
Neither different nor same, neither being nor non-being,
neither graspable nor relinquishable, neither audible nor visible.

Within and without, perfectly luminous, everywhere unobstructed—
a single Buddha-realm lies within a grain of sand.
A single grain of sand contains the great chiliocosm,
one body and mind are identical to ten thousand.

To know this, you must master the mindless Dharma;
untainted and unobstructed is pure karma.
Good and evil, a thousand kinds—yet nothing is done—
this is precisely "Namo" and Mahākāśyapa.

This verse emphasizes the line *"To know this, you must master the mindless Dharma."*
"Mindless" does not mean dull and insensate.
If it were dull and insensate, like a wooden carving or clay statue,
how could it be said that the mind itself is Buddha?

Generally, the meaning of "mindless" is:
not clinging to form, not clinging to emptiness.
The true mind has no form, no image—
originally, it is no-thing. How could it have form?
The true mind’s light contains all images,
pervading and unobstructed. How could it be empty?

Neither form nor emptiness—
perfectly round, radiant, pure, bare, and unadorned—
this is the mind as Buddha, the Buddha as mind,
yet neither mind nor Buddha.

Thus it is said: *"The Buddha is mind, the mind is Buddha,"*
and also: *"Mind and Buddha have ever been illusory movements."*
If you recognize that the mind itself is Buddha,
yet also know it is neither mind nor Buddha,
then the mindless Dharma is attained,
and you do not fall into the teaching of quiescence.

**Verse on "Mindlessness"**

How laughable, this mind of mine—
stubborn and coarse.
Dull and drifting,
it lets things be as they are.

It does not practice cultivation,
nor does it commit offenses.
It neither benefits others,
nor seeks gain for itself.

It does not uphold precepts,
nor observe taboos.
It knows nothing of rites or music,
nor practices benevolence or righteousness.

Of all human skills,
it has mastered not a single one.
When hungry, it eats;
when thirsty, it drinks.

When tired, it sleeps;
when awake, it walks.
When hot, it wears light clothes;
when cold, it covers itself.

Without thought or worry,
what sorrow or joy could there be?
No regret, no scheming,
no thoughts, no intentions.

All the honors and humiliations of life
are but a travelers’ inn.
Like birds nesting in trees,
it may be compared.

Coming, it does not forbid;
going, it does not prevent.
It neither avoids nor seeks,
neither praises nor blames.

It does not loathe the ugly,
nor admire the beautiful.
It does not seek quiet chambers,
nor shun bustling markets.

It does not speak of others’ faults,
nor boast of its own rightness.
It does not favor the noble,
nor slight the lowly.

Loved ones and enemies,
the great and small, inner and outer—
joy and sorrow, gain and loss,
reverence and contempt, danger and ease—

the mind does not see two ways,
but remains level and even.
It does not act for blessings first,
nor initiate calamity.

It responds only when moved,
rises only when pressed.
It does not fear blades,
how could it fear tigers?

It follows things in their names,
why cling to labels?
The eye does not chase after forms,
sound does not enter the ear.

All appearances
are but delusion and falsehood.
Male and female, form and sound—
none are fixed entities.

With no mind in form or image,
untainted and unobstructed,
it is free and at ease,
nothing can burden it.

The wondrous awakening is perfectly luminous,
illuminating within and without.
It encompasses the six directions,
without near or far.

Its light is not light,
like the moon in water.
Hard to grasp, hard to relinquish—
what could compare to it?

Understanding this wondrous function,
it transcends all else.
If asked its principle,
this alone is it.

These dozens of lines,
repeated again and again,
all elucidate the two words: *mindless*.
The wonder lies in *mindlessness*—
amid dust, it transcends dust;
in the world, it transcends the world.
Free and at ease,
nothing can burden it.

Within the square inch of the human heart,
not a speck of dust can lodge.
If even a speck remains,
endless human thoughts arise.

Once human thoughts arise,
now this, now that—
the body is no longer its own,
and the self is not present.
When the self is not present,
the slave becomes master,
the master becomes slave.
How can there be freedom?

If one can be *mindless* in all things,
unmoved and unshaken,
then one is free.
Being free,
one is self-mastered,
all anxieties cease,
all entanglements vanish.

The wondrous awakening is perfectly luminous,
illuminating within and without,
encompassing the six directions,
without near or far.
Truly free—
how wondrous is the function of mindlessness!

**Verse on the *Heart Sutra***

The aggregates, truths, faculties, and dusts—
form and emptiness—
none of these dharmas can be spoken of.
When inverted views are exhausted,
the quiescent body abides in itself.

*Aggregates* refer to the five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness.
*Truths* refer to the four truths: suffering, its cessation, the path, and extinction.
*Faculties* refer to the six faculties: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.
*Dusts* refer to the six dusts: form, sound, scent, taste, touch, dharmas.
*Emptiness* is quiescence;
*form* is clinging to appearances.

The aggregates, truths, faculties, dusts, emptiness, and form—
all are dharmas produced by the mind,
all belong to inverted views.
If one can sweep them all away,
the mind’s essence becomes quiescent—
this is Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva,
this is Śāriputra, unborn and undying.

If even the slightest dharma remains among these six,
there is birth and death,
and one does not attain freedom.
Only when one reaches the place of no birth and death,
constant and free,
are the six truly purified.

---

**Verse on "No Merit, No Sin"**

All day walking, yet never walked;
all day sitting, yet never sat.
Cultivating good, yet no merit accrues;
committing evil, yet no sin is incurred.

If one has not yet awakened to the mind,
do not cling to these words and act recklessly.
After death, you must face King Yama—
how can you escape the cauldron, the pestle, the millstone?

**Verse on "No Sin, What Is Merit?"**

To name it "no sin"—what then is merit?
Sin and merit both arise from the mind.
With mind to do evil, one creates sin with mind;
with mind to practice good, one seeks merit with mind.
Good and evil, sin and merit—
all arise from the mind.
If one reaches the state of no-mind,
walking and sitting are unknown—
how then know good and evil?
How then know sin and merit?
Thus it is said: cultivating good yet no merit accrues,
committing evil yet no sin is incurred.
Like an infant, without knowledge or awareness,
laughter and anger, scolding and cursing—
all arise from no-mind.
What merit or sin could there be?

This no-mind is the absence of the human mind.
Without the human mind, the true mind naturally exists.
The true mind’s measure is equal to heaven and earth,
encompassing the ten thousand things.
It neither thinks of good nor thinks of evil,
neither creates sin nor seeks merit.
Merit and sin—
both are beyond its reckoning.

If one has not yet awakened to the true mind
and instead lets the deluded mind run wild,
committing a hundred evils,
claiming there is no sin—
after death, the retribution of cauldrons, pestles, and millstones—
how can one escape it?

---

**Verse on Perfect Penetration**

Seeing true emptiness, emptiness is not empty;
where is there no perfect penetration in radiant clarity?
Root, dust, mind, and dharmas—all are without substance.
Only in wondrous function does one know they are one with things.

The nature of true emptiness is perfectly penetrating, unimpeded.
Its brilliance shines everywhere, and nothing can deceive it.
Not empty, yet naturally empty;
empty, yet not empty—
it is merely constant response, constant stillness,
constant stillness, constant response.

---

**Following-Him Verse**

The ten thousand things lie scattered before the eyes,
let them move or be still, let them have their way.
Radiant clarity, samādhi, and wisdom—
ever untainted,
like a lotus rising from water, dry of itself.

Though this verse has four lines,
its meaning is contained in the single phrase:
"Radiant clarity, samādhi, and wisdom—ever untainted."
Radiant clarity is wondrous being;
samādhi and wisdom are true emptiness.
True emptiness naturally abides in the ten thousand things
yet is not tainted by them.
Wondrously, it naturally encounters the ten thousand things
and responds to them.
Constant response, constant stillness—
at ease wherever it goes,
like a lotus rising from water,
born in the mire yet unstained.

---

**Moon-in-the-Sky Verse**

A single bright moon hangs in the empty sky,
its pure light shines on all lands without obstruction.
Gather it—its light does not condense;
scatter it—its light does not disperse.
Push it forward—its light does not advance;
draw it back—its light does not retreat.
That which it illuminates is not distant,
this which it shines upon is not near.
The light on the surface is not external,
the light within is not internal.
Gathering and scattering, advancing and retreating,
distance and nearness, surface and interior—
though the illumination differs,
the light is the same.
Within sameness there is difference,
within difference there is sameness.
One source scatters into the ten thousand distinctions,
the ten thousand distinctions return to the one source.
Unfurled, it fills the six directions;
rolled up, it retreats into secrecy—
lively and free,
like a puppet show.

**Song of the Pearl**

A poor man wears a pearl in his robe,
bright and perfectly round from the start.
Not knowing to seek it himself,
he counts the treasures of others.

Counting others’ treasures brings no benefit—
it only makes you waste your strength in vain.
Better to recognize your own jewel,
worth gold beyond measure.

This pearl’s light is greatest,
shining throughout the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds.
It has never lacked even a fraction,
only obscured by floating clouds.

Since recognizing this cintāmaṇi,
who still clings to bubbles, illusions, or flowers?
The Buddha’s pearl is one with my pearl,
my nature returns to the Buddha-nature sea.

Pearl is not pearl, sea is not sea—
the mind’s vastness embraces the dharma-realm.
Though clamor and dust fill your eyes,
samādhi and wisdom remain radiantly clear, ever at ease.

Not emptiness, not form—
within and without, resplendent and unobstructed.
The six supernatural powers, wondrous and boundless—
self-benefit and benefiting others, how could they be exhausted?

Seeing is completion, all affairs are finished.
Beyond learning, without doing, one passes the days.
Tranquil as an unborn infant,
movement and stillness follow conditions, without fixation.

Neither cutting off delusion nor cultivating truth—
the minds of truth and delusion both belong to dust.
From the beginning, the ten thousand dharmas are without form;
within formlessness, there is the dharma-body.

The dharma-body is the natural Buddha,
neither human nor thing.
Vast, it fills the space between heaven and earth—
only subtlety and indistinctness, shadowy and vague.

Stains do not taint it, its light shines of itself.
No dharma does not arise from the mind.
If the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—
then one knows sin and merit were never substantial.

No Buddha to cultivate, no dharma to expound—
a true person’s wisdom and insight are naturally distinct.
Speaking, one roars like a lion,
not like a wild fox debating birth and death.

This song hinges on the line:
"If the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease."
Dharmas here are not the dharmas of the Buddha-dharma,
but the myriad thoughts, delusions, and false imaginings of the mind.
If the mind does not arise, the ten thousand dharmas are empty.
The nature-pearl shines constantly,
samādhi and wisdom are perfectly clear,
within and without, resplendent.
Bubbles, illusions, flowers—
what is there to cling to?
Though clamor and dust fill your eyes,
they cannot obstruct you.
Beyond learning, without doing,
like an unborn infant,
movement and stillness follow conditions,
without the illusions of truth and delusion.
The dharma-body is ever manifest,
the natural Buddha appears—
filling heaven and earth,
illuminating the great-thousand worlds.
What floating clouds could obscure it?

**Song on Chan Meditation to Dispel Delusion**

The Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water—
when the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.
In activity and rest, ever serene and clear—
not only when sitting is this so.

People today seek realization through silent sitting,
not knowing it depends entirely on seeing the nature.
If the nature is clear within seeing,
seeing naturally settles within the nature.

When concentration matures, wisdom’s function is boundless—
this is called the supernatural powers of all Buddhas.
Should one seek to fathom its essence and function,
one sees only the emptiness of the ten directions.
Within this emptiness, not a single thing exists,
nor any trace of the subtle or indistinct.
If you chase after the subtle and indistinct,
the search itself becomes a deviation.
Yet even these two words—deviation—
cannot be grasped as evidence.
The original mind is already empty;
how could gain or loss ever touch it?

Simply cast aside all dharmas,
leaving nothing behind.
Suddenly, perfect clarity appears of itself—
then you are no different from the Buddhas.
This colored body is but my fetters;
for now, blend with the world’s radiance and mingle with the dust.
In all actions, be without intention—
why quarrel over right and wrong, honor and disgrace?
This borrowed form is but a temporary abode,
while the host of this inn is Vairocana.
Vairocana neither comes nor goes—
thus one knows birth and death leave no residue.

Should someone ask what Vairocana is like,
it is simply that all forms fail to describe it.
Before your eyes, every speck of dust is active,
yet dust and activity are neither the same nor different.
Seeing this dust and activity in every particle,
each one is Śākyamuni, each one is Kāśyapa.
If they differ, the ten thousand sounds all resound;
if they are one, a single wind gathers all.
If you wish to recognize the wish-fulfilling jewel,
do not say you must attain the Dharma first.
When ill, use medicine to heal;
once healed, what need is there for medicine?
When the mind is deluded, borrow the Dharma to illuminate it;
when the mind awakens, the Dharma is no longer needed.
Like a tarnished mirror polished bright,
blemishes and grime vanish of themselves.

All dharmas are fundamentally illusory,
so one is taught to leave behind all forms.
When all forms are left behind, what remains?
This is called the supreme, ultimate truth.
If you wish to adorn the Buddha-land,
practice equal compassion and relieve suffering.
Though the bodhisattva’s original vow runs deep,
take care not to grasp at anything within appearances.
This is the perfection of both merit and wisdom,
and in the future, you will be the first to receive the prediction.
Even the slightest stain of eternalism or nihilism
cuts you off from all Buddhas.
Yet when one reflects on the delusions of ordinary beings,
all are tainted by the dust of attachment and habit.
Simply because craving and clinging run deep,
they are constantly reborn in womb, egg, transformation, or moisture.

To study the Way, you must be fierce and resolute,
your heart of non-attachment hard as iron.
Even if you have sons, daughters, wives, and concubines,
what difference is there between them and others?
Constantly guard the single sphere of radiant light,
seeing nothing desirable to contemplate.
When all dharmas are simultaneously unattached,
what need is there to speak of hell or heaven?
Then my life is in my own hands,
and in emptiness, there is no ascent or descent.
I emerge and vanish among the Buddha-lands,
yet never leave the original seat of bodhi.
Guanyin’s thirty-two transformations—
I too shall realize them within this.
Manifestations beyond conception
all arise from the nature of carefree ease.

I am a Chan practitioner without intention,
indifferent to all things.
Once a black ox,
today my whole body is white.
Sometimes I sing, sometimes I laugh—
others say I lack sense.
How would they know that beneath these coarse robes
lies a priceless treasure?
If they see me speak of emptiness,
it is as if they swallow a jujube whole.
Only the Buddha can truly know this Dharma;
how could the foolish and ignorant comprehend its signs?

Moreover, there are those who claim to practice Chan,
yet only learn to match words and seal lips.
They boast of my quick wit in question and answer,
yet fundamentally do not recognize the host.
They merely pluck branches and pick leaves,
failing to thoroughly investigate the root.
When the root is attained, branches and leaves flourish;
without the root, branches and leaves cannot endure.
They flaunt their grasp of the luminous pearl,
yet remain entangled in self and other.
With my wondrous awakening at the source of mind,
they are separated by a thousand miles.
Such people are pitiable and laughable—
they speak of years spent studying the Way,
yet their pride prevents them from asking others,
wasting their whole lives in vain.
They are dull and deluded, with heavy karmic obstructions—
if they do not awaken in this life,
how will they avoid sinking in the next?

This song of over a hundred lines
distills the meaning of these four verses:
*"The Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water—
when the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.
In activity and rest, ever serene and clear—
not only when sitting is this so."*

For the Tathāgata’s Chan-nature
is utterly pure in essence,
as clear as water,
without wind or waves,
unstained by dust or grime.
Whether active or at rest,
it is always thus—
not only when sitting is it settled.
To mistake sitting for Chan
is not true Chan,
but the Chan of lifeless, dull emptiness,
which cannot be called the Tathāgata’s Chan-nature.

True Chan
unites concentration and wisdom,
its wondrous function boundless,
mind and Dharma both forgotten,
all forms left behind.
It adorns the Buddha-land,
practices equal compassion,
blends with the world’s radiance while mingling with the dust,
dwells in the world yet transcends it,
is Chan without being Chan,
settled without being settled.
All those who seek realization through silent sitting,
or who seal their lips without recognizing the host—
such wild-fox Chan, half-awake yet still muddled,
how could they know the true Chan-nature of the wondrous awakening at the source?

*Reading the Song from the Ancestral Record of Chan Master Xuedou*

A single stream from Caoxi divides into a thousand branches,
illuminating past and present without obstruction.
Yet scholars of late do not seek the source,
mistaking hoofprints and puddles for the great ocean.

Master Xuedou, teacher of the true essence,
sounded the thunderous roar of the Dharma drum.
The lion-king emerged from its den with a mighty roar,
and the hundred beasts and thousand demons all trembled in fear.
Now in song, now in verse,
he earnestly points out the path for the deluded.
His words are bold, his meaning profound,
striking jade and ringing gold through the ages.
Alas, the deluded cling to appearances,
chasing after words and seeking names and forms.
The true suchness of the Buddha-nature is beyond words,
without high or low, without boundaries.
Neither form nor emptiness, nor a duality of the two,
the ten directions’ dust and lands are a single perfect sphere.
True concentration is never divided by speech or silence,
neither to be grasped nor abandoned.
Simply do not cling to any appearances—
this is the true principle of the Tathāgata.

To dispel delusion by opposing it with truth
only obscures truth if delusion does not cease.
Only when you know that both truth and delusion are not real
do you attain the unobstructed true mind.
Unobstructed, you are free—
a single awakening dissolves eons of transgressions.
Without effort, you realize bodhi,
and from then on, forever leave the sea of birth and death.

My teacher’s recent words flow smoothly,
left in the world as a model.

Last night, I summoned him before me,
threaded his nostrils, and hung him upon my staff.
I asked him of the foremost truth—
he replied, "All speech is but slander."

Though this song praises the *Ancestral Heroes Collection*,
it truly conveys the form of true suchness.
Among its lines, the couplet:
*"Simply do not cling to any appearances—
this is the true principle of the Tathāgata."*
encapsulates the essence of the entire work.
Not clinging is no-mind;
no-mind means neither truth nor delusion arises.
When neither truth nor delusion arises, there is no obstruction;
no obstruction brings freedom,
freedom preserves the true reality,
and one forever leaves the sea of birth and death.

The line *"Last night, I summoned him before me,
threaded his nostrils, and hung him upon my staff"*
holds deeper meaning beyond the Immortal’s words.
Scholars, ponder this:
What is summoned? What is threaded?
To "summon" is to call forth the nature of true suchness and real form.
To "thread the nostrils" is to pierce the mind beyond form and emptiness.
When this nature is awakened and this mind known,
the staff in hand upholds heaven above and earth below,
without front or back,
perfectly round, radiant,
pure, bare, unadorned—
this is the foremost truth from the West.
What more is there to say?

**Precepts, Concentration, Wisdom**
Precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the wondrous functions of the Dharma.
Though the Buddhas and ancestors have spoken of them,
those who do not comprehend cling to their words.
Here, I briefly explain to aid awakening:
When mind and environment are both forgotten, and not a single thought stirs—this is *precepts*.
When awareness is perfectly clear, inwardly and outwardly luminous—this is *concentration*.
When responding to conditions with inexhaustible marvel—this is *wisdom*.
These three depend on one another, each the substance and function of the others,
never separated even for an instant.
Like the sun, which relies on light to illuminate,
and light, which relies on illumination to shine—
without light, there is no illumination;
without illumination, there is no shining.
At their root, precepts, concentration, and wisdom arise from one nature;
light, illumination, and shining arise from one sun.
If even "one" is not truly one, how can there be three?
When three and one are both forgotten, there is only serene purity.

The Immortal’s explanation has entered the samādhi of precepts, concentration, and wisdom—
his words are concise, his meaning clear.
If practitioners can uphold them, they may directly ascend the other shore.
Yet, though the Immortal’s words are clear,
I fear students may lack broad vision or sufficient strength,
unable to advance toward awakening the primal source.
Thus, I add this annotation to guide future seekers,
leading them from shallow to deep, from low to high, that they may succeed.

Precepts mean facing circumstances without attachment, unstained by the dusts.
Concentration means utmost sincerity without falsehood, unmoved and unshaken.
Wisdom means adapting to situations without bias or partiality.
When one can uphold precepts, concentration, and wisdom,
the three work in harmony,
shifting from effort to spontaneity,
merging into a single nature,
returning to the state of unknowing, unperceiving purity.
Yet when purity is attained, even "one nature" is not held—
how then could there be the three of precepts, concentration, and wisdom?
Thus it is said: *When three and one are both forgotten, there is only serene purity.*
If, upon reaching purity, the three are still employed,
then upon true purity’s attainment, the three naturally dissolve.
To retain even three or one is not the purity of Chan.
The verse states:
*"When the mind is deluded, rely on the Dharma for illumination;
when the mind is awakened, even that is no longer needed."*
For all dharmas of the mind are to be forgotten,
and all appearances utterly relinquished—
this is the meaning of *three and one both forgotten, serene purity*.

**West River Moon (Twelve Poems)**
**I**
Do not forcefully extinguish delusive appearances,
nor need you seek the true—what is there to pursue?

The original nature and the Buddha-nature are cultivated as one—
delusion and awakening are not bound by before or after.
Awakening is instantaneous Buddhahood;
delusion is eons of sinking in the flow.
If but a single thought accords with true cultivation,
the sins and defilements as countless as the Ganges’ sands are extinguished.
The original nature is the Buddha-nature.
The Buddha-nature has neither delusive thoughts nor true suchness.
Only because worldly beings alternate between delusion and awakening
do the names of delusive thoughts and true suchness arise.
To be deluded about one’s nature is to give rise to delusive thoughts;
to awaken to one’s nature is to return to true suchness.
Awakening to true suchness is instantaneous Buddhahood;
giving rise to delusive thoughts is eons of sinking in the flow.
Delusive thoughts and true suchness exist only between delusion and awakening.
If, without awakening, one forcibly extinguishes delusive thoughts
or seeks true suchness, how can true suchness be seen?
The closing line states: *"If but a single thought accords with true cultivation,
the sins and defilements as countless as the Ganges’ sands are extinguished"*—
this can be clearly understood.

**II**
Originally there is neither arising nor ceasing—
why insist on distinguishing arising and ceasing?
Even sin and merit have no root;
how could the wondrous essence ever increase or diminish?
I possess a luminous mirror,
which has long been obscured by dust.
Today, polished to brilliance, it illumines heaven and earth—
the ten thousand images shine forth, none can hide.
The true suchness of the original Buddha-nature
is neither arising nor ceasing, neither to be increased nor diminished.
Yet through the defilements of the dusts,
there is arising and ceasing, like a luminous mirror obscured by dust.
If one morning the accumulated grime and old stains are polished away,
it remains the same perfectly bright and undiminished thing.
When it illumines heaven and earth,
the ten thousand images shine forth, none can hide—
how then could there be arising or ceasing?

**III**
My nature enters the Buddha-nature of all;
the Buddha-nature in every realm is thus.
A solitary cold reflection shines in a cold spring—
one moon appears in a thousand pools.
Small as an invisible hair-tip,
vast as the filling of the three thousand worlds.
High or low, it naturally conforms to square or round—
why speak of long or short, deep or shallow?
My nature and the Buddha-nature,
throughout the ten thousand lands and the nine continents,
the nature of all beings in every realm—
none is different.
In the sage it does not increase,
in the ordinary it does not decrease,
like a single luminous moon appearing in a thousand pools.
This nature may be small or vast,
high or low, square or round,
shallow or deep, long or short—
yet it does not fall into the traces of great or small,
high or low, square or round, long or short, deep or shallow.
Only the common people use it daily yet do not know it.

**IV**
Dharma upon dharma—originally there is no dharma;
emptiness upon emptiness—this too is not emptiness.

Silence and clamor, speech and stillness—originally the same,
why trouble to speak of dreams within dreams?
In use there is non-use,
in effortless action, action is applied.

Just as fruit ripens and naturally turns red,
ask not how to cultivate the seed.
When the Tathāgata preaches the Dharma, there is truly no Dharma;
when the Tathāgata speaks of emptiness, it is truly not emptiness.
The Dharma without Dharma—this is called the true Dharma;
the emptiness that is not emptiness—this is called true emptiness.
True Dharma, true emptiness—
silence and clamor, speech and stillness—
unknowing, unperceiving,
accord with the Emperor’s rule and that is all.
What Dharma is there to preach, what emptiness to discuss?
If one forces preaching or forced talk of emptiness,
it is like speaking of dreams within dreams—
how could one know the nature of true Dharma and true emptiness,
serene and unshaken, responsive and thus penetrating?
Responsive and thus penetrating,
serene and unshaken—
is this not "in use there is non-use, in effortless action, action is applied"?
In use there is non-use—the Dharma is fundamentally empty;
in effortless action, action is applied—within emptiness there is Dharma.
The Dharma is fundamentally empty, emptiness contains Dharma,
neither substantial nor void, neither existent nor nonexistent,
perfectly luminous and unobscured,
long since self-liberated—
like fruit ripening on the branch,
there will naturally come a day of maturity.
This itself is the cultivation of the true seed of Buddha-nature;
no need to ask how to cultivate the seed.

**V**
Good and evil—both forgotten in an instant,
prosperity and decay—no concern at all.
Darkness and brightness, concealment and revelation—let them rise and sink,
eat when hungry, drink when thirsty, as one’s portion allows.
The spirit, serene and profoundly still,
undisturbed whether sitting, lying, singing, or chanting.
A pool of autumn water, deep and clear—
though the wind stirs, do not be startled, let it be so.

The essence of the verse lies in these two lines:
"The spirit, serene and profoundly still,
undisturbed whether sitting, lying, singing, or chanting."
For when the spirit is still,
good and evil, prosperity and decay,
darkness and brightness, concealment and revelation, rising and sinking—
none enter the heart.
Living according to conditions,
sitting, lying, singing, chanting,
carefree and at ease,
thoughtless and unburdened—
like a pool of autumn water, deep and clear.
Though the wind blows, there are no waves—
what cause is there for anxiety or fear?

**VI**
Facing circumstances, no need to forcibly extinguish them;
provisional names are established as expedient means to bodhi.
Form and emptiness, brightness and darkness—originally equal,
do not divide truth and illusion into two bodies.
Awakening brings immediate clarity to the Pure Land,
no need for distant lands like India or Cao Creek.
Who says the Land of Ultimate Bliss lies to the west?
Realization itself is Amitābha’s advent.

The original nature of the Tathāgata
is perfectly round, radiant, pure, bare, and unadorned.
Neither form nor emptiness,
neither brightness nor darkness,
neither truth nor illusion.
One who awakens becomes a Buddha in an instant—
why forcibly extinguish the dust of emotions before a mirror?
Because most people do not awaken,
the buddhas and bodhisattvas provisionally establish bodhi as an expedient,
guiding beings from gradual to sudden enlightenment to realize buddhahood.
Bodhi, in the language of China, means the correct path—
turning from the crooked to the straight, gradually awakening.

**VII**
Self and others, sentient beings and lifespan—
why distinguish between high and low?
The Dharma naturally illuminates, without "I" or "they,"
thought after thought—no need to seek.
Seeing is not necessarily seeing,
hearing is not necessarily not hearing.
All functions have never known one another—
who can obstruct you in life and death?

Self and others, sentient beings and lifespan,
high and low, "I" and "they," seeing and hearing, right and wrong—
all are provisional appearances.
If one can thoroughly illuminate and see through these,
letting them go into unknowing—
in life it is thus, in death it is thus,
life is acceptable, death is acceptable,
life and death are unobstructed—
naturally one transcends life and death.

**VIII**
Practicing generosity while attached to forms,
the karmic retribution does not transcend gods and humans.
It is like shooting an arrow upward at floating clouds—
when its force is spent, it falls.
How much better to embody the true mark of non-action,
returning to the source, reverting to simplicity, restoring purity.
Forgetting circumstances, exhausting emotions, following one’s natural truth—
thus attaining the patience of the unborn Dharma.

The formless form is the true mark.
The true mark does not arise from practicing generosity while attached to forms—
it emerges from reverting to simplicity and restoring purity,
from forgetting circumstances and exhausting emotions.
Recognizing the true mark,
every movement and stillness is natural truth—
naturally one attains the patience of the unborn Dharma.
The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says:
"This person immediately attains the patience of the unborn Dharma."
The commentary explains: true thusness is called the unborn,
the Dharma is without outflows, true wisdom is called patience.

**IX**
If fish and rabbit come into your hands,
naturally you forget the trap and snare.
The raft for crossing the river, the ladder for ascending the sky—
once there, all are discarded.
Before awakening, one relies on words and speech;
after awakening, words and speech become false.
Though these four phrases belong to non-action,
they too must be transcended.

The trap is for catching fish—once the fish is caught, the trap can be forgotten;
the snare is for catching rabbits—once the rabbit is caught, the snare can be forgotten.
The raft is for crossing the river—once the river is crossed, the raft can be abandoned;
the ladder is for ascending heights—once the height is reached, the ladder can be discarded.
Words are for explaining principles—once the principle is understood, words can be forgotten.
Yet these four phrases—"forget the trap," "forget the snare," "abandon the raft," "discard the ladder"—
though they teach the awakening of true nature and belong to non-action,
one cannot simply remain in empty non-action to conclude the matter.
If one only abides in empty non-action,
how can one reach the ground of true thusness and wondrous awakening?
One must transcend even this non-action to deeply attain self-realization.

**X**
Once awakened, do not seek extinction;
follow conditions and guide the deluded multitudes.
Cut off views of permanence and annihilation, and lead them—
expediently point to the ultimate reality.
The five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,
the six perfections and myriad practices—cultivate them all equally.
A single sphere of perfect light, a precious mani jewel—
benefiting others while also aiding oneself.

The Buddha-Dharma takes awakening to one’s nature as primary;
it is not that once awakened, one does nothing.
One must apply this empty nature to concrete reality—
only then is it true Buddha-nature.
Thus it is said:
"Once awakened, do not seek extinction;
follow conditions and guide the deluded multitudes."

Guiding the deluded multitudes is precisely how one practices expedient means and establishes meritorious deeds.

The five eyes are: the heavenly eye, the wisdom eye, the Dharma eye, the Buddha eye, and the fleshly eye. The three bodies are: the pure Dharma-body, the perfect Reward-body, and the hundred-billion Transformation-bodies. The four wisdoms are: the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, the Wisdom of Equality, the Wonderful Observing Wisdom, and the Wisdom of Accomplishing What is to be Done. The six perfections are: generosity, moral discipline, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. The myriad practices encompass all expedient meritorious deeds.

The five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms, six perfections, and myriad practices—cultivated both internally and externally—refine and clarify the true suchness of one’s original nature. Like a precious mani jewel, its radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the obscure and revealing the luminous, benefiting others while also aiding oneself. How could it be merely empty?

**XI**
I see people nowadays speak of nature,
boasting swiftly in verbal exchanges.
Yet when encountering circumstances, they grow confused—
how do they differ from the foolish?
What is spoken must be practiced;
only then is it called flawless in word and deed.
Wielding the wisdom-sword to sever the mani—
this is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.

The crux lies in these two lines:
*"Wielding the wisdom-sword to sever the mani—
this is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom."*
The Tathāgata’s true wisdom is all-pervading—
this is the wisdom-sword.
Because true wisdom can dispel delusion and return to sincerity,
it is called the wisdom-sword.
Because true wisdom is perfectly luminous and never obscured,
ever-present,
it is called the mani.
"Severing the mani" does not mean cutting it off,
but rather harnessing it,
preventing its radiance from being misdirected outward.
In essence, it is the mani;
in function, it is the wisdom-sword.
The wisdom-sword, mani, and true wisdom
are all one—
not three separate things.
This true wisdom is not attained through mere words;
one must cultivate and refine it through embodied practice.
If the body does not act,
and one only engages in verbal sparring,
responding with clever retorts,
claiming to have seen one’s nature—
when encountering situations, one becomes instantly bewildered.
What good does that serve?
Thus it is said:
*"Wielding the wisdom-sword to sever the mani—
this is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom."*
Only one flawless in word and deed possesses true wisdom;
those who hastily parry with words do not.

**XII**
To realize the wondrous Dao of non-arising,
nothing more is needed than to see one’s true mind.
The true body is without form or sound—
only thus is the pure Dharma-body.
This Dao is neither non-existent nor existent,
nor is it to be sought in the middle.
Abandoning both extremes and the center—
seeing this is called the highest attainment.

Seeing the true mind *is* the wondrous Dao;
there is no need to seek it elsewhere.
The true mind is unstained and unattached,
unmoving and unshaken,
without form or sound—
it is also called the pure Dharma-body.
This mind *is* this body.
Neither existent nor non-existent,
yet both existent and non-existent—
it cannot be sought in existence,
nor grasped in non-existence,
nor taken from the neither-existence-nor-non-existence.
Since all three are negated,
what then is this thing?
Seeing this thing,
one instantly transcends non-arising—
this is called the wondrous Dao of the supreme vehicle.
The true body and true mind are originally one.
In essence, it is called the true body;
in function, the true mind.
Essence and function are inseparable,
body and mind undivided,
form and spirit both wondrous,
in perfect union with the Dao—
is this not what is meant by non-arising?

**Appendix: Reading the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***

The wondrous workings of the Great Elixir follow Qian and Kun;
Qian and Kun move, and the five phases divide.
When the five phases flow in sequence, the common Dao arises and perishes;
when the five phases move in reverse, the elixir’s body remains eternally numinous.
From the formless, a sign emerges;
the Two Modes arise from the One Root.
The Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies;
the Eight Trigrams beget one another as parent and child.
Myriad phenomena arise from change and movement;
fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are thus distinguished.
The common people use this daily yet remain unaware;
only the sage can fathom its source.
Thus, the marvelous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun,
and so its images are entrusted to this text.
When Pi and Tai alternate, yin and yang ascend or descend;
when Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn or dusk.
Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire;
Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger, po and hun.
Abiding in the center brings the supreme fortune of the Yellow Skirt;
encountering Kang leaves one without position or honor.
Having not yet been cautious of the myriad things’ ends and beginnings,
one must again observe where the two qi converge and flee.
The moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the spirit’s flourishing and decline;
the sun’s rising and setting align with the constructive and defensive qi’s warmth and cold.
The words were established to clarify the images;
once the images are grasped, the words are forgotten.
Just as images are set forth to point to meaning,
when the true meaning is realized, the images are discarded.
The enlightened find it simple and easy;
the deluded grow ever more confused and entangled.
Thus, those who cultivate the truth and read the *Cantong Qi*
must not cling to images or adhere rigidly to the text.

**Song for Master Liu of White Dragon Cave**

Jade races, gold flies—both luminaries rush;
scarcely has the flower bloomed when autumn frost arrives.
In vain they boast of Peng’s thousand-year lifespan—
it is but a lightning flash in the clouds.
A lightning flash—how fleeting!
A hundred years amount to thirty thousand days.
Within them, cold and heat alternately torment,
unnoticed, the youthful face fades in darkness.
Even with children and grandchildren before one’s eyes,
affection and attachment only deepen the entanglement.
When essence is exhausted and the body withers,
who can devise a way to briefly delay?
Briefly delay—yet no method exists;
inevitably, the body returns to flowing waters.
Look at the sages and worthies of old—
how many have managed to remain in this world?
To remain in the world, there *is* a way,
but people today lack the capacity.
They race into the mountains to seek herbs and trees,
subduing lead and refining mercury to concoct cinnabar.
Concocting cinnabar—how different the task!
One must seek the crimson blood within Kan.
Seize it, bring it to Li’s position to restrain the yin essence,
and blend them in due season.
When the season is right, employ the matchmaker:
the Metal Elder and the Mysterious Maiden unite in marriage.

The Metal Elder prefers to ride the White Tiger,
the Mysterious Maiden often mounts the Crimson Dragon’s form.
The Tiger comes to sit quietly in autumn mountains,
the Dragon stirs its body in the depths of the pool.
The two beasts meet and wage a battle,
waves surging like a boiling cauldron.
The Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their divine might,
shaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.
In an instant, the battle ends and clouds and rain disperse,
planting a mysterious pearl deep in the mud.
From this, roots and sprouts gradually grow,
nurtured in season with the embrace of true essence.
After ten months of gestation, it is swallowed into the mouth—
unaware, the mortal body already possesses spirit.
This matter is rare in the world,
not something ordinary people come to know.
If in past lives one lacks the bone of immortality,
how could one easily encounter it?
Having encountered it, one should refine it at once,
for time flies swift as an arrow.
To catch fish, one must cast a net—
do not merely stand by the river sighing in vain.
I hear you have known of the medicine for many years,
why not still your heart and refine mercury and lead?
Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind—
lament not the six paths of rebirth when heaven is blameless.

Of late, many in the world are deceitful,
all donning the robes of Daoists.
Ask them what Metal and Wood truly are—
they fall silent, mute as the afflicted.
Yet they speak of "subduing qi" and "abstaining from grain,"
claiming other paths and distant roads.
Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?
The method of the Great One containing truth is most excellent.
Do not fault my words for their wildness—
it is only that people today find it hard to discern.
Only when your heart aligns with mine
dare I pour out my thoughts to you.

*Song of the Stone Bridge*
My home lies north of the Stone Bridge,
where mountains guard and waters seal, ancient trees standing dense.
Beneath the bridge, the stream flows clear to Kunlun,
beneath the mountain, the spring’s fragrance is rich and lush.
My dwelling within the mountains is truly worthy of praise,
everywhere blooms the flower of non-withering grace.
North of the mountain, a cave hides a fierce tiger,
emerging from its den with roars that stir wind and mist.
South of the mountain, the pool’s depths conceal a flood dragon,
soaring clouds and descending rain shroud the peaks in haze.
The two beasts meet and clash in battle—
the hidden pearl of primal essence is an auspicious sign.
The scene is enviable, and I rejoice in secret,
pouring my own wine, growing pleasantly drunk.
Drunk, I pluck a tune on the stringless zither,
each note in the music teaching with care.
Alas, in my drunkenness, none understand—
dull and silent, I seem like a fool.
Gazing up, I marvel at the workings of creation:
the sun returns west as the moon rises east.
Heaven is earth, earth is heaven—
yin and yang reverse in harmony with nature.
Grasp where the Five Phases invert,
and soon you’ll ascend in rosy clouds to the grotto-heaven.
A house of gold, jade rafters,
jade maidens and golden lads attend before you.
The Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are clearly arrayed,
the myriad phenomena manifest boundless.
No day or night, only ceaseless continuity,
gathering and dispersing, adding and withdrawing—fire and timing complete.
If you ask where the Golden Elixir truly lies,
seek the teacher who points to lead within water.

Wood gives birth to fire, metal gives birth to water—
water and fire must distinguish their order.
To discern floating and sinking, know host and guest,
lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.
There is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,
knowing contentment, ever content, return to the root.
All spirits celebrate the era of great peace,
when the nation prospers and the people rejoice.
This matter is worthy of reflection—
those of the same path understand this meaning.
Later generations learning the cultivation of truth
speak only of "preserving and nourishing" and "circulating qi."
Before their eyes, it seems so easy,
yet those who attain it are wondrous beyond compare.
First, it banishes illness and extends years,
using fire to refine and transform the yang body.
Learners of the Dao, set aside your own thoughts,
do not inquire of side doors and minor methods.
They only know how to deceive others in the moment,
unaware of how their own bodies wither in secret.
I urge later students to be bold and resolute—
do not idly abandon your home to wander distant lands.
The wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body—
how could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?
Do not procrastinate, do not cling to baseness—
hasten to seek a teacher and grasp the primal decree.
If in this life you do not learn to cultivate,
who knows what womb you’ll enter in the next?
Since you have the heart, see it through to the end—
the great matter of life and death is all there is.
If the August Heaven betrays those with the heart for Dao,
it would make me a lowly ghost in the three evil destinies.
