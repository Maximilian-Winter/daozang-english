**Lectures on the *Yinfu Jing* (宋 夏元鼎 *Yinfu Jing Jiāoyì*)**
**Preface to the Summary (提要 序)**
**Volume 1–4**

The *Lectures on the Yinfu Jing* (四卷) is authored by Xia Yuan ding (夏元鼎) of the Song dynasty.

Yuan ding, styled Zongyu (宗禹) and self-styled Yunfeng Hermit (云峰散人), was a native of Yongjia (永嘉). This work elucidates the *Yinfu Jing* through the Daoist alchemical (丹法) perspective.

At its close, the text appends diagrams and commentaries on:
- The Inner and Outer Three Passes (内外三关图),
- The Sacred Functions of Sun and Moon (日月圣功图),
- The Marvelous Instruments of Ten Thousand Symbols (奇器万象图),
- The Three Teachings in Unity (三教归一图),
- The Primordial and Transformative (先天后天图),
- The Upper and Lower Magpie Bridges (上下鹊桥图),
- The Seventy-Two Stellar Phases (七十二候图),
- The Generation of the Five Phases (五行生成图).

According to the *Han Records* (《汉志》), the Daoist and Immortalist schools were distinct traditions. The *Yinfu Jing*, comprising 384 characters, was originally composed and annotated by Li Qian (李筌). Since Qian’s annotations make no mention of furnace-fire (炉火), it is clear that the text belongs to the Daoist rather than the Immortalist school. Later commentators, however, disregarded Qian’s own annotations, fabricating interpretations akin to *Ying Shu Yan Shu* (郢书燕说)—mere contrivances.

Yet, while the *Paramartha Agreement* (《参同契》) does not invoke the *Yijing*, Chen Tuan (陈抟) cited it in relation to the *Yijing*, thereby establishing his own school. Similarly, though the *Yinfu Jing* does not speak of alchemy, this work does so, thus forming another distinct tradition. These interpretations were transmitted successively and could not be discarded.

Hence, in this compilation, I have recorded the annotations of six schools on the *Yinfu Jing* to preserve its original intent, and included this work to account for its divergent branches—what is termed *"from the same, to the same"* (从同同也). Other works branching from these two traditions are omitted.

As for the two schools (二氏), only their broad outlines are retained; there is no need to exhaustively examine each.

The text opens with a preface by Lou Fang (楼昉) from the Baocheng era (宝庆二年), stating that Yuan ding, in his youth, studied with the elders of Yongjia and, though he admired the *Yinfu Jing*, did not fully grasp its meaning. Later, upon encountering a transcendent figure at the summit of Zhufong Peak (祝融峰), he seemed to receive instruction. Subsequently, upon re-reading the *Yinfu Jing*, he analyzed its chapters and sentences, and with a stroke of the brush, composed it anew—claiming that a divine force from the Yin seemed to assist him. Such is the tendency of the esoteric arts, ever prone to such mystifications.

Additionally, there is a preface by Liu Yuan gang (留元刚) from Baocheng Bingxu (宝庆丙戌), inviting Yuan ding to annotate the *Yao Jing* (药镜), along with Yuan ding’s own self-recorded account and preface, and a later preface by Wang Jiuman (王九万) from Baocheng Dinghai (宝庆丁亥). Yu Yan’s *Ruishang Futan* (席上腐谈) mentions that Yuan ding annotated the *Yinfu Jing*, the *Yao Jing*, and the *Wu Zhen* (悟真), with Zhen Xishan (真西山) providing a preface—all consistent with the other prefaces. However, the present text does not include his annotations on the *Yao Jing* or the *Wu Zhen*, nor does it retain the preface by De Xiu (德秀), likely lost in transmission. Moreover, De Xiu’s *Xishan Wenji* (西山文集) does not record the text, leaving its fate unexplained.

Ban Gu’s *Records of the Arts and Literature of the Han* catalogues military writings, listing four types of military texts: those emphasizing strategy (*quanmou*), those emphasizing terrain and formation (*xingshi*), those emphasizing *yin-yang* principles, and those emphasizing tactical techniques (*jiqiao*). Though he categorizes them separately—each school specializing in one aspect—nevertheless, their underlying currents are inseparably intertwined.

Ban Gu observed: *"Strategy* is to defend the state with rectitude and to deploy armies with the unexpected, encompassing terrain and formation, embracing *yin-yang*, and applying tactical techniques."* Thus, the four schools are in truth one.

Yet Ban Gu subsumed *xingshi*, *yin-yang*, and *jiqiao* under *quanmou*, while I would rather unite *quanmou*, *xingshi*, and *jiqiao* under *yin-yang*—for between heaven and earth, there is only *yin* and *yang*.

Strategy manifests as expansion and contraction; terrain and formation as separation and union; tactics as convergence and divergence—yet all these movements arise from the transformations of *yin-yang*. Hence it is said: *"The interplay of *yin* and *yang* is the Dao."*

Fan Li’s schemes for Wu were refined in discerning the rhythms of contraction and expansion, early and late, extending even to the barrenness of rice and crabs—yet with a single strike, he captured the kingdom. He applied the same principles to his own family, embodying the saying: *"Later generations build upon the foundations of their forebears."*

Those who follow the times like fierce beasts or rapacious birds—are they not wielding *yin-yang*? Yet strategy, terrain, and tactics operate within this framework.

Ancient masters of warfare were never those who did not grasp *yin-yang*. The *Grasping of the Marvelous* by Feng Hu, the *Eight Arrays* of Wu Hou, and Li Wei Gong’s *Lone and Empty Crow Divination* are but its outward expressions.

Yet there are deeper layers still: Zhang Liang, kneeling at the bridge of Kuai, receiving teachings from an old man—Su Shi dismissed this as mere superstition, asking how one could know that the age of Qin lacked hidden sages. I too wonder how one could know that the age of Qin lacked immortals—Zhang Liang merely encountered a rare opportunity.

The *Yin-Shu Jing* (*Yin Symbol Classic*), attributed to the Yellow Emperor, is written in archaic and obscure language, so difficult that readers struggle to parse its sentences—let alone annotate it.

Master Xia Jun Zongyu, having come from Zhe to Min, showed me a single manuscript: his own commentary. Master Xia, in his youth, studied under the great scholars of Yongjia, yet uniquely devoted himself to this text, though he did not fully comprehend it.

Later, while in Shangrao, he prayed in silence: *"Before ascending the Dragon-Tiger Register, I shall first ascend Dragon-Tiger Mountain."* That night, he dreamed of an encounter with a transcendent figure atop the Zhufeng Peak, as if receiving instruction. Upon waking, he took up the book again, and with sudden clarity, parsed its chapters and sentences, writing annotations as if guided by an unseen force. Could this be mere imitation or conjecture, like the commentaries of the world?

No—this must be an intuitive resonance, a spontaneous understanding.

Yet warfare and immortality are not easily spoken of. To speak of warfare risks descending into deceit and guile; to speak of immortality risks falling into vagueness and fabrication. Immortality is not something sought externally—clarity and resolve are inherent within. When the will and *qi* are divine, then immortality and warfare become one. To master immortality is to understand warfare; to master warfare is to understand immortality.

Zhong Mingyi spent his life in seclusion on Hua Mountain, yet his descendants became renowned generals. Yao Pingzhong, though defeated in a minor skirmish in the capital, was suspected by some of fleeing to avoid death. Yet what my school terms *immortality* is not this—it lies elsewhere.

Those who read Master Xia’s work must consider this perspective.

**Preface by Jian Lou Peng, Autumn of the Second Year of Baocheng (宝庆二年秋八月中澣楼昉序)**

**Volume One**

The Classic says: *"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the actions of Heaven, and it is complete."* The mandate of Heaven is called *xing* (性), and following *xing* is called the Dao.

The Dao is not something to be sought beyond the boundless void. Heaven’s Dao resides within us—if we exhaust its observable mysteries, then the Dao is manifest before our eyes, and the ultimate Dao is not convoluted.

To grasp Heaven’s actions, one must never stray from the twelve temporal cycles. Every word spoken, every silence held, every breath inhaled and exhaled—*yin* opens, *yang* cleaves; the sun sets in the west and rises in the east. Winds and clouds vent through the seven orifices, while *kan* and *li* converge in the primal palace. Heaven operates through this Dao to govern the ten thousand transformations, and I, too, embody this Dao in my conduct.

Cold and heat follow their cycles; the sun and moon align in their courses; the *gān* and *jian* trigrams move without cessation, and daily life unfolds endlessly.

One does not know whether I am Heaven or Heaven is I. *"My fate lies within me, not in Heaven"*—this is how it is.

To say it is complete is to say nothing more can be added.

Heaven has five *zei* (贼, "bandits" or "corrupting influences"), and those who perceive them thrive. These five *zei* are the five phases (*wuxing*).

Humans inherit the five phases from Heaven, yet within them lie five *zei* for humanity—is this not Heaven’s failure to transform? No. When the phases are inverted, the Dao of Great Perfection arises. In harmony, they perfect humanity; in reversal, they serve alchemical refinement—just as metal and wood must intermingle, water and fire must reach completion, and earth, though flourishing in all seasons, must also subdue water to fulfill its function. These are the five phases preying upon one another.

The profundity of the Dao—how can the world perceive this truth? Thus, those who see it prosper, for sincerity brings clarity, and clarity reveals it.

*"The empty chamber gives birth to whiteness"*—this is the mystery of radiance in fullness.

It speaks of observing Heaven’s Dao and seeing Heaven’s prosperity—yet the ignorant pass by it blindly. Alas.

The five *zei* reside in the heart, manifesting in Heaven. The five phases and their *zei* are subtle in principle, yet the heart, as Heaven’s sovereign, truly governs them.

This manifestation in Heaven stems from the heart’s operations—indeed, the heart is Heaven, and Heaven is the heart. If one aligns with the singular Heaven within the heart, they can appropriate the marvels of creation, moving dynamically between ascent and descent, standing beside the Emperor, so that at the moment of action, one does not know which is Heaven and which is the heart.

The universe lies within the hand—
the hand is the pivot of the Three Passes.
Those who study the Dao must know where to begin.

The *Huangting Jing* says:
*"The mouth is the heart’s Pass, where spirit and mind converge;
the foot is the life’s Pass, the gate of the natal earth;
the hand is the human’s Pass, grasping the rise and fall of fortune."*

What is gained is not through the hand alone,
yet one can press the Heavenly symbols and the four directions,
propel the Five Phases and Six Qi,
grasp the firm to nourish harmony,
flick the fingers to seize transformation,
diagnose with a glance to know the signs of Yin and Yang,
and with a decisive gaze to commune with the spirits of ghosts and gods—
all are within the hand.

The universe and the Six Directions are vast without bounds—
if one attains the profound mystery,
it is as though revealed upon the palm.
The *Shentong Xu* says:
*"The Yin Symbol of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams is in the palm—this is the Heavenly Pass."*

All transformations arise from the body.
A single human body is a microcosm of Heaven and Earth.
There are the ascents and descents of Yin and Yang,
the comings and goings of the tortoise and hare,
the tides of fortune and the passing of seasons,
the winds and rains, the clarity and the murk,
the thunderous crashes and lightning flashes,
the exhalations and inhalations of clouds,
the rivers and mountains in their flowing stillness,
the flourishing and withering of grasses and trees—
in motion and stillness, speech and silence,
opening and closing, all changes without exception mirror Heaven.
Truly, all transformations spring from here.

Yet those who have the Dao nurture transformations,
while those without it see them fade.
The living align with Heaven as their master,
while the dead dwell beside ghosts as neighbors.

How could one not cherish themselves?

Heaven’s nature is humanity.
Humanity’s heart is the mechanism.
Establishing Heaven’s Dao secures humanity’s fate.
Heaven and humanity share one heart,
mechanism and Dao move on the same path.

From the Six Desires and Seven Emotions,
some may steal humanity’s true nature—
then the fires of karma and cognition blaze,
and one no longer knows which is Heaven,
which is humanity,
which is the mechanism,
and which is the Dao.

The Sage of boundless compassion elucidates the profound truth:
*"Nature is Heaven, Heaven is humanity*—
this ultimate principle is seamless and unassailable.
If one seizes the mechanism and responds to it,
harmony naturally arises—this is the true mechanism.
Not the worldly artifice of cleverness and deceit!

It is the mechanism’s silent operation,
swift yet unhurried,
its responses as precise as matching seals.
If one clarifies this mechanism,
their heart aligns with creation—
the mechanism’s responses will never falter,
and thus Heaven’s Dao stands firm,
humanity’s fate is secured.

It is not a matter of abandoning humanity’s Dao to establish Heaven’s Dao,
nor of first establishing Heaven’s Dao and then securing humanity’s fate.
For humanity’s Dao is Heaven’s Dao,
Heaven’s Dao is the Heavenly mechanism,
the Heavenly mechanism is Heaven’s nature—
this is why one must preserve the heart,
nurture the nature,
and thereby serve Heaven.

When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism,
dragons and serpents rise upon the land.
When Earth unleashes its killing mechanism,
stars and constellations fall and are subdued.
When humanity unleashes its killing mechanism,
Heaven and Earth are overturned.
When Heaven and humanity together unleash their mechanisms,
all transformations find their foundation.
The Three Powers differ in position,
yet share the same mechanism for life and death.

Yet killing is the means to generate,
and generating is the means to kill.
Moreover, when Yin doubts Yang, conflict ensues—
its blood turns dark and yellow,
a vessel for the killing mechanism.
What of the Three Yang in harmonious union,
where all things flourish?
When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism,
it dispels the malevolent *qi* of Yin below—
then thunder crashes and lightning sweeps,
Heaven’s might is terrible,
dragons and serpents retreat in hiding,
unable to avoid it,
rising only when Yang is at its peak;
when Earth unleashes its killing mechanism,
it receives the harsh force of the field—
then the Yellow Springs surge with waves,
the Yellow River flows backward,
the Big Dipper’s ladle shifts its position,
unable to avoid rotation,
subdued only when Yin and Yang are in balanced victory.

If humanity recognizes this mechanism,
they can secretly seize creation’s marvels,
turn the heavens and invert the earth,
make Earth and Heaven exchange to achieve harmony,
and life and death settle to fulfill their function.

The True Person of the Great White sings:
*"The Five Phases in reverse—
dragons emerge from fire.
If the Five Phases do not proceed in order,
tigers rise from water.
This is the mechanism of reversal."*

Though Heaven, Earth, and humanity are ranked as the Three Powers,
life and death share the same mechanism as *qi*.
Mencius says:
*"I excel in nurturing my vast and boundless *qi*,
filling the space between Heaven and Earth—
could I abandon my own body and seek another Heaven and Earth to fill?"*

Thus, the movement of *qi* is not that Heaven has excess
while humanity lacks—
when Heaven and humanity act together,
not a hair’s breadth differs.
The mechanism operates silently yet responds perfectly,
its transformations endless.
The foundation of the elixir is fixed,
and the Great Dao flourishes.

Nature has cleverness and clumsiness,
which can be concealed.
Form and appearance are Heaven’s nature,
yet skill arises from them.
Concealment is waiting for the right moment,
yet the Heavenly mechanism lies within.
If there is such a nature, then there is such a mechanism—
not that one ends in concealment without further care.

This is why one must cherish their innate talents
and nurture their vast clarity in the proper time—
the true essence of the elixir’s secret.

Some say Yin lead governs concealment,
Yang mercury governs ascent,
and the Sage conceals Yang mercury to refine Yin lead—
thus the use of great cleverness as clumsiness.
No—

They fail to understand that the Yellow Emperor speaks specifically of cleverness and clumsiness as inherent in nature,
while concealment is waiting for the right moment.
For nature, if aligned with the Primordial Mystery,
while lead and mercury are bound to form and substance.
If this nature is luminous and the Yang spirit thrives,
cleverness and clumsiness cannot obscure it,
concealment awaits its time—
when the Heavenly mechanism responds,
Heaven’s nature is revealed.

This aligns with the Master of the Caverns’ teaching:
*"Sevenfold return to the elixir—
before this, one must first refine oneself and wait for the time."*

Understanding the principle of waiting for the time
is to understand the nature of concealment and cleverness.
The Nine Orifices’ evils lie in the Three Essentials,
which can be controlled through motion and stillness.

The human body has nine orifices—
seven above, two below—
none without impurity.
Those who study the Dao must examine these closely,
seizing the Three Essentials,
before motion and stillness can be free of evil thoughts.

What are the Three Essentials?
They are the ears, eyes, and mouth.
The *Shentong Qi* states:
*"The Three Treasures must be firmly sealed,
never to be recklessly displayed."*

The myriad colors of the world, ever-changing yet transcended by clarity,
shall not dim the mind’s brightness;
the myriad flavors of the world, ever-changing yet mastered by *Fuì*,
shall not unsettle the heart’s reception.
When one’s nature is naturally pure and luminous within,
one’s resolve and *qi* become as divine as the Dao.
Between motion and stillness,
one follows the true principle of Heaven—
though myriad evils cannot intrude.

What harm can the Nine Orifices’ evils bring to me?
This is the true *Dao* of **"See not what is unseemly, hear not what is unseemly, speak not what is unseemly"**—
how could it be otherwise?

Fire arises from wood,
and disaster must be overcome.
Deceit arises within states,
and unrest shall surely erupt when the time is right.
To know this and practice refinement—
that is called the Sage.

Wood can give rise to fire,
yet it ends in self-consumption.
A state can breed deceit,
yet it ends in summoning chaos.
This is the inevitable suffering of such forces.

Those who study the Dao must know:
to let fire arise from wood yet prevent wood from burning,
to let deceit arise within states yet prevent chaos—
just as with food and sex,
the great desires of humanity persist,
yet one must not recklessly suppress them.

If one indulges these desires,
what will they not do?
Only by the Dao can they be governed—
then fire and wood nurture each other,
not as disaster but as blessing;
deceit and evil may stir,
yet they become not evil but righteous.
Is this not the Sage’s refined Dao?

This is what is meant by **"dwelling in dust yet unsoiled, emerging from death into life."**

Yet fire and wood, in the Five Phases, are most potent,
and in the human body, wood and fire are the rise and fall.
If the true essence is not diminished,
then wood and fire burn fiercely.
To subtly respond to Heaven’s mechanisms,
the common man recklessly harms himself—
this is to slight life and indulge deceit.

The Sage refines them to attain the Dao—
this is to return to the true Way.
If the true essence decays,
then fire and wood are extinguished,
Heaven’s Way is broken,
humanity drifts far while the *guǐdào* (鬼道, way of demons) draws near.
Alas!

The *Sutra* says:
*"Heaven generates, Heaven kills—
this is the Dao’s principle.
When the *qi* resonates with the Yellow Bell (黃鍾),*
all things sprout and move—
this is Heaven’s generation;
when the *Lǜ* (律) aligns with the *Yízhé* (夷則),*
all things wither and retreat—
this is Heaven’s killing."*

Yet why does Heaven both generate and kill?
For there is a principle of generation and killing between them.
How does one know to generate life?
If one can embody this Dao within oneself—
to closely observe the workings of creation,
then spring’s birth and autumn’s death,
the exchange of yin and yang,
not confined to the year’s cycle but within the twelve hours,
one can seize Heaven’s marvelous function
and attain the Dao’s profound principle.

Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things;
all things are thieves of humanity;
humanity is the thief of all things.
If the three thefts are in harmony,
the Three Talents (三才) are at peace.
Heaven’s Way favors generation,
Earth’s Way favors growth.
Humanity is the spirit of all things,
all things serve humanity’s use—
how can they be called thieves?
If Heaven and Earth are not benevolent,
treating all things as mere fodder,
then Heaven and Earth steal from all things,
preventing their flourishing.

The Five Colors blind the eyes,
the Five Tones deaf the ears,
the Five Flavors dull the mouth—
this is how all things steal from humanity,
preventing its eternal prosperity.

The axe and adze enter forests,
fine nets descend into filthy pools,
the five grains and six livestock are cooked and devoured—
this is how humanity steals from all things,
preventing their longevity.

Yet though the three thefts secretly erode each other,
unaware yet inexorable,
life and death, flourishing and decay—
none can escape this fate.

The harm is not in Heaven, Earth, and all things,
but in humanity’s profound ignorance of it.
How does one know this?
Heaven and Earth steal from all things yet sustain them,
all things steal from humanity yet persist in their creation,
and humanity, stealing from all things,
relies on them for sustenance—
yet cannot ensure its own longevity,
thus becoming the victim of all things.
Alas!

Can the people of the world deeply grasp this truth?
If they can, they will naturally know
that their refinement must be to guard the Three Treasures,
nurture the *língzhū* (灵珠, spiritual pearl),
preserve three and guard one,
keeping *jīng* (精, essence), *qì* (气, *qi*), and *shén* (神, spirit) whole—
then the *hèchì jīndān* (赫赤金丹, radiant cinnabar elixir)
shines with abundant light,
and how can Heaven, Earth, or all things steal from me?

Yet they fail to understand this,
assuming that to live between Heaven and Earth,
one must rely on all things;
that all things benefit humanity,
one must rely on Heaven and Earth—
this is indeed natural.
Yet because they see it as natural,
they accept it without question.
The Sage laments this,
saying: *"The three thefts are in harmony—
how can they be in harmony?
This is sorrow for their mutual destruction without end.*
*The Three Talents are at peace—
how can they be at peace?
This is pity for their division yet contentment in theft."*

Deeply mournful for the world’s ignorance of the Dao,
unable to transcend the surface of creation,
emerging from death into life,
abandoning decay for flourishing,
and aligning with Heaven, Earth, and all things in their eternal cycles.

Ah! This is why the Yellow Emperor attained the *jīndān* (金丹) and ascended to Heaven,
and later worthies also ascended, following in his steps.
What harm do the three thefts bring to those who follow the Dao?

Thus it is said:
*"To eat in season,
the hundred bones (百骸) are nourished.
Human life relies on the Four Great Elements (四大) for form,
and limbs, bones, spirit, *qi*, and blood—
without food, how can they be sustained?
If one misses the season,
not only is there no benefit,
but harm shall follow.
How much more so with the Great Dao of the *jīndān* (金丹),
whose gathering and taking have their proper times—
its sweetness like honey,
its size like an orange,
eating it grants immortality,
golden sinews and jade bones—
this is how the blood transforms into marrow,
marrow into *qi*,
*qi* into spirit,
ascending to the golden gates (金阙).
How much more than simply nourishing the hundred bones?"*

To stir its mechanism (动其机),
all transformations are at peace.
Heaven and Earth’s creation is profound and unfathomable;

The mechanism operates in silent motion—
the human body shares this principle.

If one seizes the mechanism,
then all movement brings good fortune,
though myriad transformations arise,
they remain stable and free from peril.
Should one lose the mechanism,
then danger and peril are inevitable.
Where is there safety?

People know their spirit as spirit,
but do not know what makes it so.
Great indeed is the function of spirit!

Yet it has hidden and revealed aspects,
concealed and exposed—
this is where the sage and the common differ.

The world knows only to arrange and manipulate,
to speak and write without thought or effort,
yet they take it as their own spirit.
Little do they know—
their karma and perceptions are in constant flux,
responding to myriad changes,
chasing after things and losing themselves,
never a moment’s peace.

Alas! The blazing shall exhaust its oil,
the fragrant shall wither at its root—
they hasten their own depletion.
Why? Because their brilliance is too exposed.

Only the sage turns inward, seals the senses,
contains the flow, concealing all within.
Ghosts and spirits cannot fathom them.

Thus, vague and indistinct,
as if without knowledge—
yet within, there is substance.
Dim and murky,
as if without spirit—
yet within, there is essence.

This is not to deny the spirit,
but to attain the utmost spirit.

Who but those of the Way can comprehend this?

The sun and moon follow their courses,
great and small, their measures fixed.
From this, the sage’s work arises,
and the manifestation of spirit.

The sun is the Greater Yang—fire and soul,
the moon is the Lesser Yin—water and shadow.
The two symbols are manifest;
how could Yin and Yang lack their numbers?

Heaven has three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter,
each degree traversed in one day by day and night.
The moon moves twelve degrees and more in a day and night.
The sun moves slowly, completing a celestial circuit in a year;
the moon moves swiftly, completing it in a month.
Slow and swift interact,
Yin and Yang depend on each other—
thus there are great and small consummations,
their numbers fixed and unchanging.

Within a human body,
there are also sun and moon,
degrees and measures—
yet their celestial circuit is not yearly.
Compressing years into months,
months into days,
within the twelve hours,
Yin and Yang naturally rise and fall,
soul and shadow generate in turn.
To harness the sage’s work,
one must make the tortoise and hare unite,
the dragon and tiger mate—
stirred by thunder and rain,
moistened by wind,
the empty chamber births the white,
entering the realm of *wuheyou* (無何有),
mixing with the returning wind,
achieved in the briefest moment—
this is called the emergence of spirit.
Yet they do not know:
it is because of spirit that there is clarity,
because of clarity that there is spirit.

The void within the having is the deepest mystery,
the having within the void is the subtlest wonder.
Endless transformations, unfathomable depths—
illuminating all phenomena, unobstructed clarity—
this is called spirit, beyond conception.

Yet to align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
to unite with the sun and moon in luminosity—
this is the Way.

Now, people merely recite it with their mouths,
yet do not practice it in their bodies.
They dismiss immortals as absurd—
alas, what sorrow!
Their living corpses, their hollow pursuits—
they call it wealth and joy,
yet know not the emptiness of dreams and shadows,
deeply pitiful indeed.

As for those who steal the mechanism,
none in the world can see or know.
The virtuous, obtaining it, endure hardship;
the petty, obtaining it, court death.

The parable of stealing the mechanism is profound.
What is a thief? The unseen.
What is the mechanism? The uncontrollable.

To carry it away in the dead of night—
this is theft.
Who knows of it?

If the snare is set, this is the mechanism.
Who can restrain it?

Yet this thief, this mechanism—
they harmonize the Three Realms,
obtain creation’s opening and closing,
and the uninterrupted flow of *qi*.
The mechanism seals itself in response;
the common folk use it daily without knowing.

Only those who study the Dao grasp it to endure hardship—
not that they cling to poverty,
but in their floating clouds of wealth and indulgence,
they avoid excess,
delight in emptiness,
follow simplicity—
this is the meaning of enduring hardship.

The petty, obtaining it, court death—
not that they seek blades and war,
but in their lust for women and battle,
their drunkenness and music,
their gluttony and greed—
this is what is meant by courting death.

Though enduring hardship and courting death
distinguish the virtuous from the petty,
the activation of the mechanism
has no partiality toward gain or loss.
It is only that the virtuous understand the mechanism
and use it to endure hardship,
while the petty are ignorant of it
and use it to court death.

This principle is profound and mysterious—
it cannot be transmitted by oath alone,
thus it is said: none in the world can see or know.

The blind excel in hearing,
the deaf excel in sight.
Cutting off one source of sense,
one’s teacher’s efficacy is tenfold;
three cycles of day and night,
and it becomes ten thousandfold.

The blind lack sight,
the deaf lack hearing—
if clarity and wisdom are abandoned,
how can vision and hearing be refined?

It is not this.
People rely on ears and eyes for life,
yet these same ears and eyes become burdens.
Sounds and colors assail the senses,
vision and hearing are stirred within—
who knows what is master?

Only the blind, where the eyes cannot see,
focus the mind on hearing,
and powdered faces and painted lips cannot intrude.
Only the deaf, where the ears cannot hear,
focus the mind on sight,
and flute and drum cannot distract.

This is the marvel of undivided intent,
concentrated into spirit.

To cut off one source of sense
is to have the mind in single use,
softening the *qi* through concentration alone.

Three cycles of day and night—
this is the rise and fall of the Three Palaces,
endless coming and going;
tenfold, thousandfold efficacy—
this is the spirit’s clash,
making demons and external doctrines,
evil thoughts and malicious intentions,
surrender without battle.

To abandon all desires and focus on the source,
dissolving all burdens and distractions,
without thought or deliberation,
pure and sincere in essence,
no deviation in mind—
this is the realm of stillness and motionless repose.

「Thus, within the span of day and night,
the Three Palaces rise and fall in endless cycle,
as Yin and Yang ascend and descend without fail,
their rhythm unbroken, revolving without end—
this is the wondrous work of response and attunement.

Ah! If this Dao is not seen in practice,
nor tested in daily life,
then what use is there in speaking of it?

Yet even so, tenfold or thousandfold efficacy
still varies in depth—why is this?

It is because those who abandon wisdom and intelligence,
discard their limbs and senses,
wither like dried wood in form,
and grow cold like dead ashes in heart,
though they may attain stillness and enter the Dao,
suffer the flaw of the *Buddha’s* (释) empty and void (空寂) extremism,
lacking the power of transformation (运化),
and ultimately become mere shades of darkness (阴灵), tormented by lingering desires (苦爽鬼) alone.
Thus, their efficacy remains only tenfold.

But if one cuts off all sensory desires (利一源)
and yet can still endure the threefold cycle of day and night,
naturally preserving the True and embracing the One (守真抱一),
ascending and descending through the Three Palaces (升降三宫),
revolving through day and night without pause,
then all beings—human and celestial—are attuned in harmony,
responding as if by divine instinct (应若神),
beyond all comparison or reckoning.
This is the Dao of merging with Heaven and Earth’s virtue (合德),
and uniting with the Sun and Moon’s luminosity (合明),
whose efficacy is truly unmatched—
how could it be anything but a thousandfold efficacy?

In ancient times, the Duke of Lu (鲁侯) questioned the Master Kangcangzi (亢仓子) about the Dao of *ear-vision* (耳视) and *eye-hearing* (目听).
Kangcangzi replied:
*"The transmitters are mistaken (妄矣).
I can see and hear without relying on ears and eyes,
but I cannot reverse the function of ears and eyes.
It must be that the body attunes with the heart (体合于心),
the heart attunes with the *qi* (心合于气),
the *qi* attunes with the spirit (气合于神),
and the spirit attunes with the Void (神合于无).
Thus, though there be the subtle distinction of existence (有介然之有),
or the faintest sound (唯然之音),
whether distant beyond the Eight Desolations (八荒之外),
or near as the eyelashes (目睫之间),
none can evade my seeing and hearing.
If the world knew Kangcangzi’s seeing and hearing,
they would understand the Yellow Emperor’s blindness and deafness (聋瞽) in seeing and hearing."*

How profound and mysterious (玄妙)!

The heart arises from things (物),
and perishes from things (物),
its mechanism lies in the eyes (机在目).
The heart and eyes are interdependent,
life and death are thus bound together,
and things and their mechanisms respond in kind—
never ceasing, never breaking.

Human beings are the spirit (灵) of all things,
daily interacting with the myriad forms.
When a thought arises,
it follows that the heart is born from things;
when a thought is extinguished,
it follows that the heart perishes from things.
Yet the heart does not itself arise from things,
its mechanism lies in the eyes and ears (机在目耳);
the heart does not itself perish from things,
for its mechanism remains in the eyes and ears.

If at that moment one cannot distinguish black from white,
nor beauty from ugliness,
then the heart aligns with the Great Emptiness (太虚),
and how could life and death ever take hold?

It is the mechanism that lies in the eyes (机关在目),
stirred by the slightest touch.
A single glimpse of beauty
and suddenly love is born (倏然生爱);
a single sight of evil
and instantly hatred grows (悠然增恶).
Thus, to love is to give rise to desire (欲心生),
showing that the heart is born from things;
to hate is to extinguish desire (欲心死),
showing that the heart perishes from things.
Trace its origin—
is this truly the heart’s inherent nature?
It is all the mechanism that lies in the eyes.

Hence, the Sage of old had the *Inner Observation Canon* (内观之经),
the Daoist adept had the *method of veiling the eyes* (帘目之法),
the Confucian admonition: *"Do not gaze upon what is not proper"* (非礼勿视),
and the Buddhist *cleansing of the eye-root* (清净眼根).
Their intent is profound,
yet their principles are not far from truth.

Still, even the blind (瞽者) have their cravings—
does the mechanism lie solely in the eyes?
Thus it is said: *"The heart and eyes are interdependent."*

Chapter Three, the Canon states:
*"Heaven’s lack of favor is itself the greatest favor."* (天之无恩而大恩生)

「Swift thunder and fierce winds—
yet all move sluggishly.
What heart does Heaven possess?

The seasons march on,
A hundred things flourish and grow,
Yet only when frost and snow congeal,
When ice and cold are severe,
Do all things return to their roots and fulfill their fate—
This is Heaven’s lack of favor yielding the greatest favor.

Moreover, when swift thunder and fierce winds arise in spring and summer,
All things rejoice and thrive;
Every living, breathing creature
Completes its natural course in harmony.

What is called the midst of raging flames,
Is the very place where gold and treasures are forged.

The scholar who grasps this truth
Shall understand the *killing mechanism*,
The reversal of harm within benevolence,
The creation of boundless favor,
Ascending to the Mysterious Origin (玄元),
Becoming the master of both Heaven and humanity.

The utmost joy lies in innate nature,
The utmost stillness is purity itself.
Emotions may shift between sorrow and joy,
Yet nature abides in supreme joy;
Desires may stir to action,
Yet the Dao rests in supreme stillness—
This is how the transcendent and the ordinary diverge.

The scholar who seeks the Dao
Should first take joy in his innate nature,
Letting not a single trace of depletion or excess burden it,
Then sweetness and tranquility arise naturally;
Purity in cultivation
Will spontaneously align the heart with the Dao.

But those who wallow in the seven emotions and six desires,
Who find sorrow and joy inconstant,
Who provoke harm at every turn,
Who daily entangle themselves in dusty snares,
With no escape in sight—
How can their nature be said to bring joy?
How can their stillness be pure?

Heaven’s utmost partiality
Is its utmost impartiality in practice.
The Dao of Heaven is impartial,
Yet in the matter of *Inner Elixir* (金丹),
It seems to have its preferences.

Heaven’s heart may appear partial,
Yet toward the Great Dao,
It seems utterly impartial.
How so?

Humans receive their endowment from Heaven—
A single point of luminous awareness, the true nature (一点灵明真觉之性),
A threefold state of effortless spontaneity, the natural fire (三昧无为自然之火),
The primal unity of the Preheaven (先天太一),
The essence that harbors the True (含真之精).
Without distinction of great or small,
Of noble or base,
Of transcendent or ordinary,
All receive their full measure—
This is Heaven’s impartiality.

Yet those who follow the Dao
See yin and yang rise and fall without fail,
The sun and moon unite in perfect accord,
They summon thunder, call forth rain,
Stir winds and flash lightning—
Truly turning Heaven and Earth,
Taming dragons and subduing tigers,
Whereby sacred deeds arise,
Divine brilliance emerges,
With wonders beyond reckoning.

Those without the Dao fare otherwise—
Yin and yang stray from their appointed times,
The sun and moon lose their celestial cycles,
Thunder, lightning, wind, and rain act as they please.
If one’s body persists beyond the mere vessel of food and drink,
It becomes but a den of medicine and lust.

Is it not that Heaven truly favors those with the Dao
And neglects those without?

I have seen the Dao-cultivators
Live long upon this earth,
Though their bodies perish, they ascend as immortals;
The undaoed, sickly and wretched,
Decay swiftly with plants and trees.

Thus Heaven’s utmost partiality
Is the very means of its utmost impartiality.
Should one not take heed?

The principle of *transformation* (禽之制) lies in *qi*.
All things that live
Receive one breath of *qi*.
Even the most minute creature,
Soaring through the boundless void,
Though it knows the six wings that beat
And the countless feathers that support,
Without the fullness of that single *qi*,
It would falter and fail to rise.

The scholar who knows this
Shall preserve and nurture the Original *Qi* (元和),
Cultivate the divine breath,
Making it most vast and most resolute,
Filling Heaven and Earth without end.

Does not the *Classic of Poetry* say:
*"The kite flies to the heavens,
The fish leaps in the depths—
It is the *qi* that makes it so."*

Is this not near at hand in the body,
And far observed in all things?

Life is the root of death,
Death is the root of life.
Benevolence arises from harm,
Harm arises from benevolence.
To comprehend the workings of creation,
One must know the roots of life and death;
To fathom the Great Dao,
One must discern the meaning of benevolence and harm.

This principle—
Apart from the Five Phases (五行) of creation,
Apart from the *Inner Elixir* and the Great Dao,
How else might it be understood?

Now, gold is born in the *Perilous Month* (巳),
Dies in the *Child Month* (子),
The *Child Month* being the realm of water,
Yet gold can generate water.
So then, does gold truly die?

Wood is born in the *Boar Month* (亥),
Dies in the *Horse Month* (午),
The *Horse Month* being the domain of fire,
Yet wood can also generate fire.
Water and earth are born in the *Monkey Month* (申),
Die in the *Tiger Month* (卯),
The *Tiger Month* being the position of wood,
Yet water can generate wood.
Thus life is the root of death,
And death is the root of life.

Yet the roots of life and death are fixed,
While the meaning of benevolence and harm differs—
Only the transformations of gold and fire
Cannot be judged by life and death alone.

The *Dragon-Tiger Upper Canon* (《龙虎上经》) states:
*"Gold and fire are the true medicines.*
The art of *Inner Elixir* (丹术) finds its greatest clarity in gold and fire.
Moreover, fire is born in the *Tiger Month* (寅),
Dies in the *Rooster Month* (酉),
The *Rooster Month* being the realm of gold,
Its fire can only subdue gold—
How could it generate gold?

The *Rooster Month* is where gold thrives,
Yet fire is in the place of its own demise—
Unable to subdue it as harm,
Yet gold, in turn, regards its flourishing as benevolence.
But how could gold generate itself?

It must rely on what generates it—
Only earth can generate gold,
Yet fire also generates earth.
Without the *Steel* (戊) and *Earth* (己) phases,
No *Inner Elixir* could be formed.

Ah, the Five Phases
Generate and subdue one another—
Profound and subtle truths,
Few scholars grasp them.
As for the *Inner Elixir* (金丹),
They speak of it with delight,
Yet seldom delve into its Mysterious Essence.
Now I must clarify each point,
To instruct those who come after.

Moreover, the inner and outer *Inner Elixirs* (二丹)
Do not depart from the Five Phases’ transformations,
Yet they are not called *Elixir of Water, Fire, Wood, and Earth*,
But specifically *Inner Elixir of Gold* (金丹)—
Why is this?

It is because Heaven One (天一) generates water,
The *Kan* (坎) Trigram being the palace of water,
Water being the mother of all things,
The cultivator of truth must first focus his heart in the *Kan* Palace.

Yet the water of the *Kan* Palace
Cannot generate itself—
Only gold can do so.
Thus the Original *Qi* of the Primordial Beginning
Is transformed and born through gold.

The ancient song says:
*"Use lead or do not use lead,
You must act within the lead.
When the time comes to use lead,
Using lead is still a mistake."*

Lead is the mother of gold,
Gold is the mother of water,
Water is the mother of the *Inner Elixir*—
Such is their generating and completing truth.

Yet the Great Dao does not rely on generation for its use,
But on subduction for its function—
Is it not that gold can subdue wood,
Wood being reduced to exhaustion,
Wood can subdue earth,
Earth reaching emptiness at its peak?」

Earth can subdue water, water blending into emptiness;
Water can subdue fire, fire ending in extinction.
Though fire subdues gold, gold remains unbroken—
Ashes fade, flames vanish, yet gold’s essence grows firm.

*The Parametric Classic* states:
*"When gold enters fierce fire, its luster remains unquenched."*

Is it not that harm gives rise to blessing,
And blessing emerges from harm?
Thus it is called *Jinye* Elixir of Return,
Called *Changsheng* Immortality,
Called *Return to the Origin, Source Reclaimed*—
For only gold within water suffices.

Yet liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys,
Essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humors—
Though their forms differ utterly,
Their life-principles are intertwined.
Though their logic may be spoken,
Their Dao defies articulation.
For there are *zuancu* [concentrations],
*hehe* [harmonizations],
Alchemical medicines,
Fire’s precise moments,
True and mundane,
Guest and host.

The Sage transmits medicine, not fire—
Without a true master, guessing is futile.
Unless one swears oath by blood to Heaven,
Or marks the ground with sand and script,
Transmission is forbidden.
To violate brings calamity to nine ancestors,
Disaster first upon oneself.

Zhang Pingzhu’s transmission to the unworthy
Met three punishments—
How could one not take heed?

The foolish revere the Sage’s cosmic patterns,
I study temporal things to grasp profundity.
The wise may pity the foolish,
Yet I transcend the Sage’s limits—
Others await, I do not.

Though Sage, Fool, Virtuous, and Wise share the same origin,
Their hearts’ breadth determines their attainment.
For Heaven, Earth, time, and things all bear patterns—
Their laws and symbols manifest without end,
Neither within nor without.
If one gazes upward and downward,
Reflects deeply and acts with clarity—
Then through mindfulness, one becomes Sage;
Through illumination, one becomes Wise.

Yet from foolishness to wisdom,
From wisdom to Sagehood—
All stem from the heart’s expansion.
Thus the foolish may grasp Heaven and Earth’s vast patterns
Within upward gazing and downward contemplation,
And though they reach Sagehood, it is possible.

But I am constrained by temporal patterns’ limits,
Observing daily life’s mundane paths,
And thus remain merely Wise.

Sagehood and wisdom diverge—
Pure and flawed, intentions differ.
When the foolish attain Sagehood,
In Buddhism, it is called *direct transcendence*—
Liberation beyond shores, seeing nature as Buddha.
In Daoism, it is called *eternal attainment*—
Ascending to immortality from the ground.

One deluded thought remains foolish;
One awakened thought attains Sagehood.

Yet the Wise are different—
Though they strive earnestly for the Dao,
They may later drift, neglectful.
Without vigilance, they drift without bound,
Losing what they hold, discarding what they possess,
And risk sinking back into foolishness unaware.

My aspiration is Sagehood—
How could I settle for mere wisdom,
Then relapse into folly?

Thus I transcend foolishness—
Not merely to avoid foolishness and become Sage,
Nor to stop at Sagehood alone.
For the Sage’s attainment still bears measure,
Still bound by Heaven and Earth’s patterns.

I transcend form, abandon intellect,
Merge with the Dao, and rise beyond all things—
How could this be confined to measure?
This is the ultimate transformation called Sagehood,
Yet Sagehood beyond measure is called *Divine*—
The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir.

Speaking thus, we speak of Fool, Sage, Wise.
At first, one enters the Dao through Heaven, Earth, time, and things’ patterns,
Yet ultimately, one forgets these patterns to attain the Dao.

Like the Five Phases’ transformations,
Ten thousand phenomena in array—
All are the Dao’s manifestations.
Words and speech, tiles and reeds—
All are the Dao’s dwelling.

Within the thirty-six thousand teachings,
Each step practiced truly,
With accumulated effort over years,
One must never forget what one can do—
For even Confucius’ disciple Yan Hui
Did not stray from *ren* for three months,
While others reach it by days or months.

But Confucius’ grand compilation,
King Wen’s alignment with Heaven’s will—
Flowing above and below with Heaven and Earth—
How could this be bound by measure?

Those who cultivate emptiness say:
*"Even after eons, it remains void—
What need for measure?"*
Yet even if one endures the fires of kalpas,
If emptiness could destroy the Dao,
How is it different?

The Golden Elixir’s Great Dao
Origins in the *Taiji*,
Completes in the *Wuji*,
Functions in the finite,
Mysteries in the infinite—
It cannot be spoken of in mundane terms.
Discuss it carefully with the Immortals.

To sink in water, enter fire,
Is to court death’s instruments.
Water and fire bring burning and drowning,
Knives and arms bring slaughter—
Even the unwise know to avoid them.

Yet now one seeks to drown in water,
Wishes to enter fire,
Delights in death by blade—
No fear of wind or madness,
Nor is it coercion by form or circumstance—
This plight is deeply pitiable.

For wine, sex, wealth, and *qi*—
These are but other names for water, fire, blades, and arms.
All lead to self-destruction within,
Yet they fear not—
They scoff at those who merely fast and purify,
Saying even if they match Pengzu and Tianmen’s longevity,
It is but lonely suffering—
Why not take pleasure in wine and desire?

Alas, moths drawn to flames—
No defense remains,
Only long sighs.

The Dao of Nature is still—
Thus Heaven, Earth, and all things thrive.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual—
Thus yin and yang prevail.

Yin and yang, in mutual succession, transform and flow in harmony.
Therefore, the sage knows the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,
And follows it to govern.

The Supreme Sage says:
All things teeming, each returns to its root.
Returning to root is stillness—
Stillness is restoring the Mandate.

Again it is said:
Push emptiness to its utmost,
Hold steadfast to stillness—
Then all things arise together,
And I observe their return.

Yet when emptiness and stillness are absolute,
The body merges with yin—
How then do all things arise?

But yin, if not extreme, gives no birth to yang,
Stillness, if not extreme, reveals no Dao.

How much more so—the Great Dao, formless,
Giving birth to Heaven and Earth;
The Great Dao, nameless,
Nourishing all things.

If one does not conform to Nature,
Dwelling not in utter stillness,
Then Heaven, Earth, and all things
Could never generate.

Man, with one body, partakes in Heaven and Earth’s functions—
Yet does he not know what stillness is?

Only his mind-monkey and will-horse
Daily roam unrestrained in the field of desires,
Viewing the principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation—
What relevance do they hold for him?

Moreover, the Dao of Heaven and Earth
Is like gradual infiltration—
From one yang to six yangs,
From one yin to six yins,
All growing by degrees, never abruptly.

Thus yin and yang, in mutual succession,
Follow Nature’s order—
Only the sage knows this,
And within *wuwei* there is action,
Within utmost motion there is utmost stillness,
Causing all things to arise from stillness.

Who but the Daoist can comprehend this?

The Dao of utmost stillness
Even the calendar cannot measure.
Birds and beasts are its example.

The calendar’s laws,
Calculating celestial cycles,
Have seventy-two *xiàng*,
Twenty-four *qi*,
Four seasons and eight nodes,
Waning and waxing phases—
All are fixed numbers that cannot be defied.

Yet in regulating time and seasons,
In meticulous computation,
One doubts it contradicts the Dao of *wuwei* and Nature.

Only the sage, his Dao reaching utmost stillness,
His heart as boundless as the Void,
Sees yin and yang rise and fall,
Transforming naturally—
Not a trace of contrivance.
If the calendar’s artifices are excessive,
Is it not the fate of birds and beasts?

For birds and beasts are the tortoise and hare—
The tortoise and hare are the sun and moon—
The sun and moon are water and fire—
Water and fire are yin and yang—
Yin and yang are Heaven and Earth—
Heaven and Earth are the Dao of pure stillness and *wuwei*, Nature’s great Way.

The Great Dao is the study
Of penetrating principles, exhausting essence,
Extending to the Mandate of life.

Life and Mandate are the art
Of eternal existence, the elixir’s method.

There exists a wondrous instrument,
Giving birth to all phenomena.
The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems,
Divine mechanisms concealed like ghosts.
The arts of yin-yang victory
Are clearly manifested in symbols.

Ah, the Dao! How vast!
Ah, the words! How profound!

*The Yinshu Jing* are Yellow Emperor’s secret utterances on the Dao.
I dare not hesitate—
I explain their meaning,
Revealing Heaven’s hidden machinations.
To gaze upon the end and summarize the beginning,
It is like the *xuan* of *Qian* and *Kun*,
Embracing the essence of all sixty-four hexagrams.
Its probing of mysteries, reaching the profound,
Is not easily fathomed.
Ah, how splendid!

I dare to bow twice.
Through gradual influence, it is made clear—
And the Great Dao of the elixir,
Within one’s body,
Has its wondrous instrument—
Not necessarily forged by fire and furnace.

The crescent furnace of **Yǎn Yuè**, the hearth of **Tài Yī**, the tripod with neither inside nor outside—
the most refined, most sacred elixir,
which gives birth to all phenomena,
all emerging from the natural order.

Dongbin spoke of a single grain of millet containing a world,
three *shāng* of a cauldron boiling mountains and rivers—
was this not truthful speech?

Thus, when spoken of through the Eight Trigrams,
**Kàn** and **Lí** are the foundation;
when spoken of through the Circulation of Heaven,
the **Child** (水) takes precedence.

Its divine mechanism—
its wondrous, boundless applications;
its hidden essence—
its concealment and revelation beyond measure.

When yin overcomes yang,
water and fire achieve *Jìjí* (既济);
when yang overcomes yin,
sun and moon become *Hébì* (合璧).

The **Golden Crow** has the virtue of seizing the hare,
the **Wooden Dragon** the power of subduing the tiger.
The tortoise and serpent entwine their necks,
the clam and mussel hold pearls—
their symbols hang resplendent,
hardly concealable.
Is this not the meaning of *chōngshí ér yǒu guānghuī* (充实而有光辉)—
the greatness of *dà ér huà zhī* (大而化之)—
the sainthood of *shèng ér bùkě cèzhī* (圣而不可测知)?

This is the Dao—
the very concern of our Confucian tradition.
The ignorant claim the elixir as heterodox, perverse learning—
like one who sits in a well and claims the sky is small.
Is this the sky’s fault?

**Yúnfēng** says:
Who does not pass through the door?
Why not walk this Dao?

The door is a gate.
Only with a gate can one walk the true path.
If the gate is lost,
there arises reckless, wild behavior,
deviant and extravagant habits.

Thus it is said:
Within are the Three Gates—
with nature as master,
with vital qi as core—
the constant return inward,
never letting out.

Without are the Three Gates—
the mouth as hinge,
eyes and ears as locks—
the evils of the nine orifices lie in these three.

These are the daily, ordinary ways
of the *Zhōngyōng* (中庸), the Great Dao.

The Dao is like a great road—
who does not walk it?

At its beginning,
even women and children may understand it;
when it reaches its height,
even sages have things they do not know.

Thus it is said:
To be sung is to be good (*kě gē zhī wèi shàn*),
to be within oneself is to be true (*yǒu zhū jǐ zhī wèi xìn*),
to be full and radiant is to be great (*chōngshí ér yǒu guānghuī zhī wèi dà*),
to transform and change is to be sage (*dà ér huà zhī zhī wèi shèng*),
to be unfathomable is to be divine (*shèng ér bùkě cèzhī zhī wèi shén*).

This divinity—
is it not the luminous, wondrous function,
the manifest transformation, the secret essence
of the elixir’s true meaning?

**Yúnfēng** on the *Diary of the Sun and Moon’s Sacred Functions*:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth—
one yin, one yang,
the primordial *qi* paired,
and all things are born.

The suspended symbols, most manifest—
none greater than sun and moon.

The **Great Sun**, true fire,
corresponding to the southeast,
born from wood;
externally corresponding to spring and summer,
giving birth to all things.

The **Moon**, true yin-water,
corresponding to the northwest,
nourished by metal,
pruning and killing all things.

These two are the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth’s birth and death,
thus called *water and fire*,
*Kàn and Lí*,
*lead and mercury*,
*Dragon and Tiger*—
other names too numerous to count,
all names for sun and moon.

The sage observed Heaven’s Dao,
discerned its waxing and waning,
revealed its hidden depths,
and divided the sun and moon’s *qi* into the Eight Trigrams—
two for the sun’s fire,
one for the moon’s water.
Once one and two were divided,
the *guà*’s *qi* differentiated,
thus forming sixty-four variations.

The first fifteen days:
**Kūn** gives birth to **Zhèn**, which transforms into **Xuàn**,
**Xuàn** transforms into **Gàn**,
**Gàn**’s *qi* full and round,
suspended and shining in the east—
metal and water warm and gentle,
metal’s *qi* sufficient,
giving birth to true water.

The next fifteen days:
**Gàn** diminishes into **Xùn**,
**Xùn** returns to **Gèn**,
**Gèn** diminishes into **Kūn**—
**Kūn** and **Qián** unite,
sun and moon intertwine,
their essence most subtle, most refined—
beyond thought or speech.

Even spirits, ghosts, and gods,
let alone humans and beasts,
cannot hide a hair’s breadth.

Great indeed is the body of sun, moon, Heaven, and Earth!

If one can exhaust the sun and moon’s sacred functions,
then at new and full moons, observing Heaven’s symbols,
one may align with Heaven and Earth, sun and moon in their movements—
how could one not transcend the mundane, attain sainthood,
escape death and enter life?

**Yúnfēng’s Explanation of the *Wondrous Instrument, Ten Thousand Phenomena***:
As the *Yīnfǔ Jīng* says:
*"There exists a wondrous instrument,
which gives birth to all phenomena.
The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems—
divine mechanisms concealed like ghosts.
Great are the words!"*

A person’s body is itself this wondrous instrument—
all phenomena complete,
spirits and ghosts guarding it—
truly the most noble.

The **Tàishàng** says:
*"The body is hard to obtain,
the Central Land hard to be born in,
and if born, the true law is hard to encounter."*

**Píngshū** says:
*"First establish **Qián** and **Kūn** as the tripod,
then bring the crow and hare’s elixir to boil.
Why seek **Qián** and **Kūn** beyond the body,
or take the crow and hare from the sun and moon’s palace?"*

Thus it is known:
the wondrous instrument lies within the body,
all phenomena are complete in oneself—
the Two Poles, the Three Luminaries, the Four Symbols,
the Five Phases, the Eight Trigrams,
the Nine Palaces, the Ten Stems, the Eleven Celestial Exaltations,
the Twelve Branches, the Twenty-Four Seasons,
the sixty *jiǎzǐ* of the Circulation of Heaven—
all are complete in a single body.

If one can look upward and downward,
aligning with Heaven and Earth, yin and yang in their transformations,
then the mechanisms are sealed in harmony,
ghosts and gods cannot fathom,
the Three Powers stand together,
longevity and clear vision are attained—
how far could the Dao of transcendence be?

**Yúnfēng’s Explanation of *The Three Teachings Merge as One***:
The Three Teachings follow different paths but converge.
The deluded create divisions.

They say Buddhism and Daoism are empty,
unworthy of comparison with Confucianism—
this is true.

But when it comes to cultivating the true self,
nurturing nature,
and the Dao of rectifying the heart, sincerity of intent—
the distinctions are not so clear.

Only the Chan school stands apart in its strangeness.
I wished to dispel its delusions,
yet never grasped its essence.

One day, I pressed **Mèng’ān Cōng Lǎo**,
asking how the transmission of the school’s nature and lamp might be clarified—
and the discussion continued without end.

The great essence is thus: **The Dharma-body is the void**, the void is the **Dharma-body**.

Moreover, he earnestly admonished me to reflect upon this,
so I lit incense and candles,
and invoked the **Three Jewels** as witness.

In a short while, after tea was done,
suddenly he called for the novice to attend to matters,
and withdrew with me to the rear gallery.
Upon exiting, he washed his hands and removed his armor,
then straightened his square-cloth robes,
and asked me to return to my seat.
He then said, *"The old monk is rather hungry—*
let us share a bowl of soup and dumplings."

I hesitated and replied:
*"Just now, you spoke of the void and the **Dharma-body**,
the **Dharma-body** and the void—
yet now hunger and thirst cannot be avoided.
You distinguish between defiled and pure,
but how can one suspect you of failing to grasp the void?
What is this still?"*

**Mèng’ān Cōng Lǎo** was stunned,
and found no words to answer.

When we reached the **hall of the square room**,
I saw there a *Snow Cave Sayings* (**Xuědòu Yǔlù**).
At the moment, I read it.
Within it, a monk asked **Zhìwèn** the Venerable:
*"How is the **Prajñā-body**?"*
He replied: *"A clam holding the autumn moon."*

The monk asked: *"How is the **Prajñā-use**?"*
He replied: *"A rabbit bearing a fetus."*

Not only does this settle the world of stillness,
it also secures the realm of the **Dharma**.
If one can skillfully ponder and examine,
then let them stride alone in the **Lotus Land**.

The monk asked: *"How is the Buddha’s supreme matter?"*
He replied: *"A staff’s tip lifts the sun and moon."*

Again, the Ancestor asked **Nánquán** the Venerable:
*"The **Mañjuśrī-bead**—if one does not recognize it,
the **Tathāgatagarbha** is personally gathered within.
How is the **Tathāgatagarbha**?"*
**Nánquán** said: *"That which comes and goes with you is the treasure."*
The Ancestor said: *"A Han within the grass."*
**Nánquán** said: *"That which neither comes nor goes is also the treasure."*
The Ancestor said: *"Frost upon snow."*
The Ancestor said: *"How is the bead?"*
**Nánquán** said: *"To perform tricks at the hundred-foot staff’s peak—
that is no master’s hand.
Here, if one catches sight of this,
guest and host exchange places,
and one may penetrate the tiger’s den.
If not so,
even if the Ancestors awaken fully,
it is still a dragon’s head and serpent’s tail."*

Thus, I pointed out to **Mèng’ān** a glimpse to cure his affliction.
At that moment, he attained great awakening
and returned the incense at the stove to me.

Truly, the Three Teachings differ in no essence—
their original face is one and the same,
only their robes vary in hue.
Thus, I record this in detail
to proclaim to the clear-eyed gentlemen of the world.

**The Diagram of Before-Heaven and After-Heaven**
**Yúnfēng** said:
Before-Heaven is when the **Tàijí** has not yet divided,
mixed and undifferentiated—
which is **yáng**? Which is **yīn**?
Once the **Way** generates **One**,
its substance is already revealed,
its function already sprouted.
Thus, **One** is the odd number,
the **stem of the hexagram**,
the symbol of pure **yáng**.

After-Heaven is when **Hóngméng** is split,
**One** divides into **Two**,
**One** becomes the paired number,
the **body of the hexagram**,
the symbol of pure **yīn**.

Since **Qián** and **Kūn** differ,
and **yīn** and **yáng** are divided,
their transformations vary—
how then is this the **Way**?

Only the marvel of the **Golden Elixir**
returns to the root and source,
seeks the root and plucks the bud,
nurtures the **feminine** and embraces **One**,
discards **yīn** and takes **yáng**,
not seeking unity in the difference of **Qián** and **Kūn**,
nor harmony in the division of **yīn** and **yáng**.
Thus, the divided and the disparate belong to After-Heaven,
while the unified and harmonized are truly Before-Heaven.

Before-Heaven is the **Primordial Ancestor**,
the **qi**’s original face;
After-Heaven is the **stinking rot** turned into marvels,
the four **great elements** artificially combined.

The enlightened observer—
if one knows the body is illusion,
only the **Way** is true,
then to delay practice by reflecting back the light
is already too late.

**The Diagram of the Upper and Lower Magpie Bridge**
*(Also called the Curve River Crow Bridge)*
**Yúnfēng** said:
**Lǚ Dòngbīn’s** *"Qìn Yuán Chūn"* reads:
*"On Curve River, the moon’s glow is clear and pure—
a crow flies there."*

The crow is the magpie.
Curve River is the bridge.

The sun contains the **three-legged crow**,
the crow belongs to **yǒu** (the hour),
**yǒu** belongs to **metal**.
The crow is the **metallic essence** of the West,
the **yang soul** of the sun,
able to fly above Curve River—
thus, the magpie can cross the bridge to transcendence.

Yet the bridge must be divided into upper and lower—
why?
Because the **qi**-paths communicate:
one who can cross the lower bridge
must also be able to cross the upper.
Those who can cross are **transcendents**,
those who cannot are **mortals**.

The **Buddhist** practice of tethering the horse to the **chūn tree**,
or tethering the donkey to the **ruò stake**,
also conveys this meaning.
But their rigid adherence to the **good path of death**,
stubbornly facing the wall,
cannot make the crow fly or the magpie cross—
thus, they fall into the second category.

Yet their original method was not so.
Alas, later descendants strayed.

The details appear in the **Diagram of the Three Teachings as One**.

**The Diagram of the Seventy-Two Seasons**

**The Diagram of the Seventy-Two Seasons**

Yúnfēng annotates *The Secret Speeches of the Primordial Origin* thus:
*"Vague and indistinct, the spirit arises from fire;
Obscure and murky, the essence forms within water.
Fire ascends in flame, sevenfold to birth the spirit;
Water flows downward, sixfold to birth the essence.
Seven and six transformations—above and below, they interweave.
Spirit and essence circulate, the wondrous body enfolds the True.
The spirit, sevenfold transformed, generates True Fire;
The essence, sixfold refined, generates True Water.
The wondrous number of seven and six—thirty-three—
Exceeds not the water and fire of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, Heaven’s thirty-six yang seasons birth Fire,
Earth’s thirty-six yin seasons birth Water,
Combining seventy-two seasons to complete the Heavenly cycle.
*The Daoist Scripture* states:
‘Thirty-six above, thirty-six below,
The Great Mystery knows no bounds—
Wondrous, the *Great Cavern Scripture*!’
Yet why speak only of water and fire, not the Five Phases?
For water and fire are the sun and moon.
*The Yinyufu Scripture* says:
‘Sun and moon have their numbers, great and small have their limits—
From this, the Sage’s work arises, the divine radiance emerges.
If one can observe above and below, mastering the Fire’s season,
Then they align with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
Merge with sun and moon in luminosity—
Truly, they ascend to transcendence from the plain.’

**The Diagram of the Five Phases’ Generation**
Yúnfēng says:
The *Taiji* divides to birth the Two Poles—Heaven and Earth.
Once Heaven and Earth take form, they cannot escape their cycles.
Thus, Heaven-One births Water, Earth-Two births Fire,
Heaven-Three births Wood, Earth-Four births Metal,
Heaven-Five births Soil—
The Five Phases weave the transformative pattern of Heaven and Earth,
So the Five *qi* shift and cycle, cold and heat alternate,
The Heavenly degrees unfold, clear as day.
Thus, thirty-six days of *jiǎ*, thirty-six days of *yǐ*—
Wood’s *qi* and numbers are complete;
Thirty-six days of *bǐng*, thirty-six days of *dīng*—
Fire’s *qi* and numbers are complete;
Thirty-six days of *wù*, thirty-six days of *jǐ*—
Soil’s *qi* and numbers are complete;
Thirty-six days of *gēng*, thirty-six days of *xīn*—
Metal’s *qi* and numbers are complete;
Thirty-six days of *rén*, thirty-six days of *guǐ*—
Water’s *qi* and numbers are complete.
Combining five sevens—thirty-five—
We calculate three hundred fifty days, plus two and a half ten days,
Totaling three hundred sixty days—
Thus, the year’s twelve months align without discrepancy.
The remaining degrees of Heaven can be accumulated through intercalary months,
To shape the myriad transformations of the cosmos.
Yet humans, the most enlightened of all things,
Are blind to the Five Phases’ operations,
Seeing only day and night’s cycle, the four seasons’ succession,
Unaware that the Five Phases’ transformations truly govern the profound—
Ah, the wondrous!

**Yúnfēng’s Preface to the *Pharmaceutical Mirror* Annotation**
Composed by *Lǐu Yuángàng*, Left Historiographer, Palace Attendant, and Imperial Petitioner,
For *Xià Zōngyǔ*, whose bold and unconventional strategies
Served in the imperial bureaucracy, then transferred to frontier outposts,
Where fate’s oddities left him unpaired.
He wandered freely, seeking the arts of flying ascension and return,
And so, through silent transmission, presented this annotated scroll to me.

Once, Su Dongpo said of An Qigeng: *"In his age, he was known as a transcendent."*
Yet Sima Qian wrote: *"Qióu Tōng, a skilled man from Qi, knew An Qigeng,
Who used strategy to seek audience with Xiàng Yǔ.
Yǔ could not employ him, intending to bestow titles—
Both refused and fled."*
Each time I read this, I cannot help but lay down my book and sigh:
If not such men, then who are the transcendent?

Thus, the scholars of the Warring States—like Lǔ Zhònglián and Yú Qīng—
Were they not those who attained the Way?
Yú Qīng, unwilling to see Wei and Qi destroyed,
Slipped away to Zhào, then fell into poverty in Lǐang, losing his chancellor’s post,
And in despair, wrote his *Book*.
Qióu Tōng’s arguments went unheeded, so he feigned madness as a shaman,
Escaped to Hóngkè, and composed his own treatise—
Was this not mastery of the Way?
He refused office, upholding lofty principles,
Debating the harm of the Wei and Qin emperors,
Resigning from his post as governor of Liáochéng.
When offered gold to extend his life, he said:
*"What the world values in its worthies
Is their ability to resolve calamities, alleviate hardships,
Dissolve strife—without seeking personal gain.
If they do seek gain, it is the merchant’s trade, which I cannot bear."*
When offered nobility, he fled, saying:
*"I would rather be poor and scornful of the world,
Than rich and noble, bowing to others."*
Ah! Only one like Lǔ Zhònglián could be called transcendent.
An Qigeng’s recorded in histories and scattered notes—
Seeming fabulous, ungrounded.
Yet if he were like Lǔ Zhònglián, spitting a rainbow,
Or like the mighty who lift the cauldron—
Both accounts are grossly mistaken.
His lingering legacy is but a fleeting trace.
Now I understand: worldly scholars, when detached, may ride the dragon—
This is the truth.

Zōngyǔ’s annotations on the *Three Golden Books*
Surpass the mundane, solidifying beyond the *Eight Immortals’ Precepts*,
Piercing satire and political maneuver—
These are the writings of Lǔ Zhònglián and An Qigeng.
As for Yú Qīng and Qióu Tōng, mere strategists—
How can they compare with these two?

**Written on the fifth day after the Winter Solstice, Bǐngxū of the Bǎobǎo era,
By Qīngyuān, the Hermit of Yúncūn Mountain.**

**Yúnfēng’s Continuation**
*"Summer’s peaks are rich with strange formations"*—
A phrase the Jin poets treasured.
I, with my illusory nature, adopt this illusory name—
Truly, adding feet to a snake, a neck to a duck.
Perhaps some will mimic Sima Qian’s fondness for the strange,
Or steal the poet’s clever phrases,
To display themselves.
Alas, summer is one of the four seasons,
Clouds are but *qi*—
Where do the peaks arise? Where does the strangeness come from?
Emerging from the mists without intent,
Riding the dragon without trace,
Bringing rain or drought,
Stirring wind or rain—
Thousands of oddities, countless transformations,
Unfathomable, beyond measure—
None of this is my aspiration.
Is it not that Heaven-One brings clarity,
Earth-One brings tranquility,
The season is now the Vermilion Emperor,
And the Flame Sovereign holds the balance?

「Peaks of the Dao’s Record

　　A fine wind from the south,
　　The sun’s shield blazes like a steaming cauldron,
　　The Fire Sovereign’s canopy burns fiercely,
　　Gold and stone melt into congealed essence.
　　These are not mere *qi*—they are clouds,
　　These are not mere forms—they are peaks.
　　The Lord of the Celestial Caverns,
　　Gathers essence and concentrates spirit.
　　The Hall of Illumination expands grandly,
　　The Sovereign of the Purple Court sits upright and serene.
　　The radiant and illustrious *Ding Gong*,
　　Refines and tempers the golden essence.
　　Kunlun rises in vigor,
　　The Jade Well brims with clarity.
　　The Supreme One’s furnace glows warm,
　　The Crescent Furnace flickers with light.
　　The *Huan* winds blend and swirl,
　　Thunderclaps and lightning clash in resounding fury.
　　Ascending to the celestial apertures,
　　Descending to the abyssal depths.
　　The Four Beasts of Luo and Wei,
　　The Six *Ding* on either side.
　　The revolutions of the *Zhou Tian*,
　　Nine transformations, soaring aloft.
　　At this moment of clouds and peaks,
　　Why should they alone bear the name of strangeness?
　　Profound indeed is the Great Dao,
　　The virtue/power of Heaven and Earth coalesce.
　　Before the Ancestor of the Primordial *Qi*,
　　When yin and yang were yet undivided,
　　Who could be the heavy turbid?
　　Who the light and pure?
　　When *Hongmeng* carved the distinction,
　　Life gave rise to Heaven, Earth, and Man,
　　Above covering, below embracing—
　　Man is the most refined and responsive.
　　The *Yunhua* stands firm and poisonous,
　　Yet persists through endless *jie*—
　　The black flies, the white rabbits,
　　The suspended symbols, twinly bright.
　　The waxing and waning of months and days,
　　A single encounter spans three decades.
　　Sudden and unaccountable—
　　Nine summers pass, yet only these clouds display their peaks.
　　When *Geng* approaches the Three Scorching,
　　Fire must rush westward.
　　The Golden Elixir’s mysteries,
　　Fire as its divine essence.
　　Clouds ascend as fiery *qi*,
　　Peaks materialize as spiritual forms.
　　Boiling in the *Kan* furnace, refining the marrow of *Li*,
　　Plundering the essence of *Qian* and *Kun*.
　　The insidious yin vanishes,
　　Pure yang emerges.
　　Heaven and Earth complete their union,
　　Life triumphs over death.
　　The strangeness of clouds and peaks—
　　Unthinkable, beyond conception.
　　Who but the True One could unlock their secrets?
　　Perhaps some remain speechless,
　　Only startled to call it marvelous.
　　Now it is known:
　　The Confucianists err in rigidity,
　　The Buddhists in stagnation,
　　The Daoists equal the Great Void—
　　Yet within it lies the root and stem.
　　Heaven and Earth vast and boundless,
　　The Dao gives them birth;
　　All things scatter and differentiate,
　　The Dao sustains them;
　　The sun and moon traverse east and west,
　　The Dao sets them in motion;
　　These clouds become peaks,
　　The Dao truly attains them.
　　I perceive the One True and Unmoving,
　　Seizing and releasing all spirits,
　　The two *qi* revolving in harmony,
　　Generating all existence.
　　Who knows if these are clouds or peaks?
　　Thus, the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions,
　　Are but these clouds and peaks;
　　The Eight Return and Six Residence,
　　Are likewise these clouds and peaks;
　　The Primordial Pearl forming its symbol,
　　Is but these clouds and peaks;
　　And when the True Person appears,
　　It is also these clouds and peaks.
　　Profound! Mysterious!
　　How could these be mere poetic phrases to be described?

　　Recorded in the Summer of *Dou Cheng* by *Xia Yuan Ding*.
　　Autobiographical Preface of Clouds and Peaks

　　Disturbance as the root of one’s profession,
　　Serenity as the mirror of medicine—
　　This is the lawful speech of *Cui Gong*.
　　Is it not that man’s existence,
　　The Four Great Elements in borrowed unity,
　　His tears, saliva, semen, vital breath, and blood—
　　All are but yin’s insidiousness?
　　Wine, lust, fame, and gain—
　　Greed, anger, and delusion—
　　All are but chaos.
　　Only the medicine’s mirror of serenity and stillness
　　Can subdue and govern them.

　　What is meant by *medicine*?
　　It is the cinnabar, mineral essence, and wood essence
　　Obtaining gold and merging as one.

　　What is meant by *mirror*?
　　It is the luminous clarity of true awareness,
　　The radiance that reflects light and returns vision.

　　Thus the Sage teaches through the *Dao of the Spirit*,
　　And uses the sun and moon as the *I Ching*;
　　The Immortal Way takes enlightenment as its core,
　　And uses the sun and moon as elixir;
　　The Buddhist’s staff that prods the sun and moon,
　　The transmission of nature through the lamp—
　　All are but material things.

　　*Cui Gong*’s compassion and mercy extend to all,
　　His skill in allegory is unmatched.
　　Thus, *Lü Dongbin* said:
　　*"Because of observing Cui Gong’s entry into the* **Yao Jing***,*
　　*It makes one’s heart and mind turn clear."*

　　Indeed, he is the teacher of both Heaven and Man.

　　I have thrice perused the teachings of the *藏 (藏教, Zangjiao—Buddhist canon)*.
　　Of the seven copies of the *Yao Jing* I obtained,
　　Their texts all differ.
　　This scripture totals **243 characters**,
　　Its brevity matches its profundity—
　　Like the *Taoist Canon’s* hidden mysteries,
　　Like the *Spring and Autumn Annals’* rectified essence,
　　It reveals the subtle and explores the profound,
　　It delves into the abstruse and uncovers the hidden—
　　No meaning is left unexplored,
　　It is indeed the pivot of the Golden Elixir.

　　On the occasion of the *Changjie* (菖节, a Daoist festival),
　　Passing through the Eight Treasures (八宝, likely a place or sect),
　　Resting at the left study of *Peng Zhongfu*,
　　I questioned him about the furnace incense,
　　And carelessly added this footnote
　　To leave a legacy for the present age.

　　To the enlightened gentlemen of *Yuzhang*—
　　*Hu Ji Zhe* (灵源子胡季辙, "Bar Season of the Spirit Source"),
　　And *Wang Hefu* (天台元漠子王和甫, "Harmonious Master of the Primordial Mist"),
　　Both disciples of the Immortal Way—
　　I dedicate this.

　　Sequential Preface by *Xia Yuan Ding*.
　　Postscript」

Professor Wang Jiuwàn of the New Prefecture of Xinzhou’s School,
*Modifying Official Duties*:

Li Yèhóu, at seven years old, was already skilled in letters,
having read ten thousand volumes.
Yet he then donned Daoist robes,
and devoted himself to the study of the Immortal Way,
as if to make it his lifelong pursuit.

Only the careless and reckless could dismiss this, saying:
*"No need for idle words—just take the post of Chancellor for ten years."*

Later, the Marquis plotted to serve his country,
and his wisdom and strategy were not inferior to Zhang Liang.
The world speaks of those beyond the square—
must they indeed abandon the world and sever all ties?
Is this so, or not?

Those who follow the Dao merely use such detachment as a stepping-stone,
not as their final destination.

In Yongjia, Xia Yunfeng,
as a youth, rode through the examination halls with his young scholar’s whip,
visiting all the great masters.
Later, he moved among military camps,
earning rewards through merit,
and galloped across Shandong and Hebei.
He ascended the sunlit mounds to pay homage to Confucius’ grove,
thus swelling the vast and unyielding *qi* within his breast.

Seeing the world’s affairs as unworthy of his ambition,
he resigned his office and took up the Dao.
One day, he presented his annotated *Three Books*,
and sent a messenger to gaze upon them—
as if to say, *"What is there to understand beyond this?"*
How could one truly grasp it?

「I have heard that the venerable ancestor, the late **Zeng Wangfu** (曾王父), who compiled the *Nine Classics* (先训九万) and bore the posthumous title **Zi Xian** (公讳子献), once accompanied the Chancellor **Lu Yuanzhi** (吕元直) and the Minister **Huo Anguo** (霍安国) in the **Xuanhe era** (宣和间), jointly undertaking the mission of transporting grain to **Yan** (燕).

At that time, the rebellious **Pei** (降虏) captives such as **Guo Yaoshi** (郭药师), **Liu Shunren** (刘舜仁), and **Zhang Lingwei** (张令徽) harbored hidden treachery. The three envoys, bearing the same commission, submitted a memorial pleading to abandon **Yan**, defying the **great** and **obstructive** **He** (大阖) and **Tan** (谭稹), and were all dismissed from office, unable to depart. The cunning of the **Pei** captives grew bolder, and the three envoys exerted every effort to defend and protect the realm, often staying awake through the night. **Zeng Wangfu**, through this ordeal, mastered the art of **nurturing one’s vital essence and guarding one’s *qi*** (神守气之术). Later, he lived to the age of eighty-nine, dying without illness.

The day before his passing, he still called for a lamp and wrote in small script to respond to Chancellor **Li Bojiji** (李伯纪). Among his disciples, **Yan Yizhong** (颜夷仲) once privately asked him about the matter. **Zeng Wangfu** replied that people often knew how to fill their bodies with *qi* but did not know how to use their vital essence to govern it. If the essence and *qi* were not harmonized and mutually guarded, this was not a true method of **nurturing life** (养生之善者).

The method of **governing *qi* with one’s essence** (以神御气) lies in **rectifying the heart and sincerely cultivating intention** (正心诚意), and in **quiet sitting while counting breaths** (宴坐而数出入息). For breath is *qi*, and counting is the essence. *Qi* is like a horse, the essence like its driver. If one uses the essence to guide the *qi* in its ebb and flow without separation, then one may achieve **longevity** (长生).

The *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》) states:
*"The breath of the True Person (真人) fills to the heels,
while that of the common man fills only to the throat."*

If breath is not confined to the throat but instead dwells in the **elixir field and sea of *qi*** (丹田气海), one can avoid disturbing the essence with thoughts and desires, or agitating the *qi* with restless movements. Counting breath **continuously and subtly** (绵绵然数之), to the point where it becomes innumerable, progressing from shallow to deep, from coarse to refined, from presence to absence—then **harmonious *qi* permeates from crown to sole** (和气充塞于顶踵之间), and one cannot distinguish *qi* from essence, nor essence from *qi*. Its subtlety transcends all speech.

Is this not akin to the **state of seated oblivion** (坐忘)?
As for his supplementary use of **classical Daoist techniques, stretching, and massage** (经伸按摩之术), it is also harmless, provided one does not grow weary of them.

**Huanglong Master** (晦翁先生) once remarked:
*"This is the method of embryonic breath (胎息法), though it is but a remnant of the teachings in the *Shen Tong Qi* (参同契)."*

And who could surpass **Xia Yunfeng** (夏云峰) in his **alchemical and Daoist works** (金丹三书), which **transcend the ordinary** (超然自应), **manifest transformations** (显化通神), and **illuminate profound and subtle applications** (灵明妙用)?

Though **Xia Yunfeng** began his cultivation as a youth, he attained the **Dao** (得道) on **Hengshan** (衡山), and spent over a decade in the tumult of military affairs—his path differed from **Yi Hou** (邺侯) yet mirrored his in the same era. Now, under the **awakened and extraordinary** (寤寐不凡) reign of the **sage emperor** (圣天子), those who rise to **achieve great deeds** (治功) should take **Yi Hou’s resolve** (邺侯之心) as their own. Let them **settle the Central Plains** (了中原) for the state, and then seek **Zi Xian** (子房) without delay.
