**Preface to *The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* by Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty**

In my *Inner Chapters*, I have discoursed upon the affairs of divine transcendents, comprising twenty scrolls in all.

My disciple Teng Sheng inquired: “Master, you say that divine transcendents may attain deathlessness—can this be learned? Were there truly such persons among the divine transcendents of antiquity?”

I replied: “Formerly, the Qin minister Ruan Cang recorded several hundred individuals, while Liu Xiang’s collated accounts numbered seventy-one. Yet divine transcendents dwell in seclusion, their ways apart from the world’s currents. What the world has heard of them is but one in a thousand.

Thus, Ningzi entered fire yet ascended through smoke; Ma Huang was welcomed by a dragon; Fang Hui chewed mica; Chi Jiang consumed blossoms and followed the wind; Juanzi ingested water and composed scriptures; Xiaofu withstood unending flames; Wu Guang roamed the depths, nourished by dried meats and shallots; Chou Sheng reversed aging by eating pine; Qiong Shu refined his form with minerals; Qin Gao rode a carp in the waters of Dang; Gui Fu altered his complexion with tortoise brains; Nü Wan at seventy enhanced her beauty; Lingyang swallowed *wu zhi* to scale heights; Shang Qiu chewed calamus and never aged; the Rain Master tempered five hues to forge a blade; Ziguang harnessed thunder dragons on the dark road; Zhou Jin rode a white bird at Goushi; the Yellow Emperor reined flying dragons at Dinghu; Ge You rode a wooden ram on Sui Mountain; Lu Tong traversed distant ages in the Yellow Hut; Xiao Shi ascended lightly upon a phoenix; Dongfang drifted through the capital in floating robes; Duzi transformed spiritually and merged with the unseen; Zhu Zhu soared through cinnabar sands; Ruan Qiu endured for ages on Sui Ridge; Ying Shi rode a fish into the farthest reaches; Xiu Yang sank into stone on the Western Peak; Ma Dan rode the wind like lightning; the Deer Elder scaled perilous heights and summoned flowing springs; Yuan Ke shed his mortal form like a cicada among the Five Flowers.

Now, I have once more gathered the ancient transcendents found in the *Scriptures of the Transcendents*, alchemical and dietary manuals, the writings of a hundred schools, the teachings of my masters, and the discourses of venerable scholars. These I have compiled into ten scrolls, to be transmitted to those of true understanding and far-reaching vision. As for the vulgar and those whose thoughts do not extend beyond the superficial, I shall not force these teachings upon them.

Thus, one sees that Liu Xiang’s accounts are exceedingly concise, omitting many wondrous deeds. Though this *Biography* delves into the profound and extraordinary, it cannot encompass all. Yet, by preserving the essentials, I humbly submit that it surpasses Liu’s work, though much has still been left aside.”

*Compiled by Ge Hong. Scroll One.*

The Master of Vast Accomplishment

The Master of Vast Accomplishment was an ancient transcendent who dwelled in a stone chamber on Mount Kongtong. When the Yellow Emperor heard of him, he journeyed there and said, “I venture to ask the essentials of the supreme Dao.”

The Master of Vast Accomplishment replied, “You govern the world, yet clouds fly without being urged, and plants and trees fall without waiting to yellow—how can one speak to you of the supreme Dao?”

The Yellow Emperor withdrew and lived in seclusion for three months before returning to see him again. The Master of Vast Accomplishment was lying with his head to the north, so the Yellow Emperor approached on his knees, bowed twice, and asked about the Dao of nurturing life.

The Master of Vast Accomplishment sprang up and said, “Profound indeed is your question! The essence of the supreme Dao is subtle and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not disturb your essence, and you may attain long life. Be cautious within, seal off the external, for excessive knowledge brings ruin. I guard the One and abide in harmony. Thus, though I have lived for one thousand two hundred years, my form has never declined.

Those who attain my Dao ascend as emperors; those who enter my Dao descend as kings. I shall now depart from you, journeying to the land of Nothing-Whatsoever, entering the Gate of the Boundless, roaming the Wilds of the Infinite. I shall shine with the brilliance of the sun and moon, endure with the constancy of heaven and earth. All others will perish, yet I alone shall remain.”

—Such was the adept.

The adept was an immortal of ancient times, his name unknown. During the Qin dynasty, Lu Ao of Yan journeyed to the Northern Sea, passed through the Great Yin, entered the Dark Pass, and arrived at Mount Menggu, where he encountered the adept. The adept’s appearance was striking: deep-set eyes and a dark bridge of the nose, hawk-like shoulders and an elongated neck, a broad forehead tapering downward. Joyfully, he danced in the wind, now rising, now falling. Glancing at Lu Ao, he fled and hid beneath a stele. Lu Ao looked up and saw him curled like a tortoise shell, eating crabs and clams.

Lu Ao then addressed him: “I have left my kin and abandoned my companions to exhaustively observe what lies beyond the six directions. From youth I have loved to wander, and in age I have not wavered, journeying to the four limits. Having explored the obscurity of this yin realm, I now suddenly behold you here—might I perhaps become your friend?”

The adept smiled solemnly and said: “Ah! You are a man of the Central States, yet you should not have come so far. You are like the radiance of the sun and moon, borne by the arrayed stars—compared to these nameless lands, you are but a hearth in a corner. Long ago, I roamed south through the vast and boundless wilds, rested north in the land of silence, exhausted the west in the chamber of profound darkness, and pierced the east through the brilliance of the surging void. Below, there was no earth; above, no heaven. Looking, I saw nothing; listening, I heard nothing. Beyond this, there is yet a vast expanse, where a single step spans a thousand miles—even I have not yet mastered it. Now you have only just arrived here and claim to have observed all—how narrow is your vision! Nevertheless, stay here. I shall wander with the boundless one above the nine heavens; I cannot tarry long.” With that, he raised his arm, leapt into the air, and vanished into the clouds.

Lu Ao gazed upward but saw nothing more. He halted, grief-stricken as though he had suffered a loss, and said: “Compared to you, I am but a mole cricket beside a swan. Though I travel all day, I do not leave the space of a foot—yet I thought myself far-reaching. How mistaken! Alas!”

Shen Wentai

Shen Wentai was a native of Jiuyi. He obtained the Way of the Jiang multitudes’ divine cinnabar and the earth talisman for returning to youth. Having consumed it with effect, he wished to rest upon Kunlun for over two thousand years. He transmitted it to Li Wenyuan, saying: “Without the proper method of ingesting the earth talisman, practicing the Way is of no benefit.” Li Wenyuan then received its secret essentials and later also ascended to heaven. The method of boiling cinnabar-yellow earth with bamboo-root juice to expel the Three Corpses originated with these two men.

Peng Zu

Peng Zu, whose surname was Qian and given name Keng, was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. By the end of the Yin dynasty, he had reached seven hundred and sixty years of age yet showed no signs of decline. From youth, he favored tranquility and stillness, paying no heed to worldly affairs, seeking neither fame nor reputation, nor adorning his carriage or attire. His sole concern was the cultivation of life and the nurturing of the body.

The Yin king, having heard of him, appointed him as a grandee. Peng Zu often claimed illness and lived in seclusion, taking no part in government affairs. He was skilled in the arts of nourishing life through guiding and pulling, and he consumed water cinnamon, mica powder, and deer antler. Though his appearance remained youthful, his nature was grave and reserved. He never spoke of possessing the Way, nor did he perform strange or deceptive transformations or ghostly marvels. Serene and without action, he would at times wander, yet none knew his destination. Those who sought to observe him never caught sight of him.

He owned carriages and horses but did not ride them regularly. Sometimes he would go for hundreds of days, other times for tens of days, without carrying provisions. Upon returning home, his clothing and food were no different from others’. He often held his breath and turned it inward, from dawn until midday, then sat upright, wiped his eyes, massaged his body, licked his lips, swallowed his saliva, and performed dozens of qi-ingestions before rising to walk and speak as usual.

If his body ever felt fatigued or unwell, he would guide and pull, holding his breath to attack the affliction. He focused his mind on his body—his head, face, nine orifices, five viscera, four limbs, even his hair—ensuring all were present in his awareness. He sensed the qi moving within his body, rising from his nose and mouth to the tips of his ten fingers, and soon all would return to harmony.

The king personally visited to inquire after him, but Peng Zu did not instruct him. Though the king sent precious gifts and curios worth tens of thousands, Peng Zu accepted them all to relieve the poor and needy, keeping nothing for himself.

There was also a woman of the palace attendants, who had likewise attained the Dao in her youth and knew the methods of nurturing the body. Though she was two hundred and seventy years old, she appeared no older than fifteen or sixteen. The king revered her, building for her in the palace gardens a resplendent hall with purple chambers, adorned with gold and jade. He then sent the attendant in a light carriage to seek Peng Zu’s instruction.

The attendant bowed twice and asked about the methods for prolonging life and increasing longevity. Peng Zu replied: “If one wishes to ascend to the heavens and ascend to the immortal palaces above, one must use the golden elixir—this is what the Primordial Lord and Great Unity consume to ascend in broad daylight. Yet this Way is of the highest order, not something a king should pursue. The next best path is to cherish essence and nurture the spirit, to ingest the most potent medicines—this can grant long life, though it will not allow one to command ghosts and spirits or ride the void in flight. Without knowing the art of harmonizing yin and yang, even taking medicines will be of no benefit. You, attendant, are one who can nurture yin and yang—its principles can be deduced through reflection, yet you do not ponder them. Why trouble me with such questions?

I was born after my father’s death, and at three, I lost my mother. I encountered the chaos of the Dog Rong rebellion and wandered in the Western Regions for over a hundred years. Compounded by my youthful lack of support, I have buried forty-nine wives and lost fifty-four children. Having endured countless hardships, my harmonious qi has been damaged, leaving my flesh and skin dull, my nourishing and defensive qi scorched and withered. I fear I may not transcend this world. Moreover, what little I have learned is shallow and unworthy of transmission.”

Now in the Great Yuan Mountains, there resides the Master of Azure Essence, said to be a thousand years old, his complexion like that of a youth. He walks three hundred li in a day, can go a full year without eating, yet may also take nine meals in a single day—truly one to consult.”

The Attendant asked, “May I ask what manner of transcendent the Master of Azure Essence is?”

Pengzu replied, “One who has attained the Dao—yet not a transcendent. Transcendents may rise bodily into the clouds without wings and take flight; they may ride dragons and mount clouds to ascend the celestial steps; they may transform into birds or beasts and drift among the azure heavens; they may dive into rivers and seas or soar above famous mountains; some consume primordial qi, others feed on magic mushrooms; some move unseen among men, while others conceal themselves in the wilds, their faces bearing strange bones, their bodies covered in wondrous fur. They cherish seclusion and shun the vulgar, yet though they possess undying longevity, they forsake human sentiment and abandon joy. They are like the sparrow that becomes a clam, or the pheasant that turns to a giant clam—losing their true nature to dwell in a foreign vessel. This is not what my foolish heart desires.

The human Way should be to savor fine foods, wear light and elegant garments, harmonize yin and yang, hold office and rank, keep ears and eyes sharp, bones and joints strong, complexion radiant and lustrous, aging without decline, prolonging life and preserving sight, enduring long in the world. Cold and heat, wind and damp cannot harm them; ghosts, spirits, and myriad essences dare not encroach; weapons and insects cannot draw near; sorrow and joy, slander and praise do not burden them—this is what is truly precious.

Though men receive qi at birth, even without knowing the arts of the Dao, if they nurture it properly, they may live to one hundred and twenty years. Those who fall short do so because they have harmed themselves. With a little understanding of the Dao, one may reach two hundred and forty years; with further mastery, four hundred and eighty. Those who fully grasp its principles may not die—though they will not become transcendents.

The Way of nurturing longevity is simply to avoid harm. Winter warmth and summer coolness, maintaining harmony with the four seasons—this is how one adapts the body. Beautiful countenance and graceful form, tranquil pleasure without the delusions of desire—this is how one unites with the spirit. Carriages and robes, dignity and restraint, contentment without craving—this is how one unifies the will. The eight tones and five colors, to delight the eyes and ears—this is how one guides the heart. All these nurture longevity, yet those who cannot temper them bring harm upon themselves. The sages of old feared that the unworthy, once they grasped these principles, would stray and never return, so they severed the source.

Thus, the superior man sleeps apart, the middling man wears different garments. Taking a thousand doses of medicine is not as good as sleeping alone. The five colors blind the eyes; the five flavors dull the mouth. If one can regulate and moderate appropriately, balance the open and the closed, one may not extend their years but will gain their benefit. All such things are like fire and water—used excessively, they become harmful.

People do not realize when their meridians are damaged, their blood and qi depleted, their inner principles hollow, their marrow and brain unsound. The body is already ailing, so it is assailed by external influences, and illness arises from wind, cold, wine, and lust. If the foundation were full, how could one fall ill?

Excessive thought and forced memory harm a person; grief, resentment, and sorrow harm a person; excessive joy harms a person; unresolved anger harms a person; relentless desires harm a person; constant worries harm a person; improper cold and heat harm a person; lack of union between yin and yang harms a person. Many things harm a person, yet to blame only the bedchamber is truly deluded.

The union of man and woman is like the mutual generation of Heaven and Earth. It guides and nurtures the spirit and qi, ensuring one does not lose harmony. Heaven and Earth follow the Way of union, so they have no end. Men lose the Way of union, so they have a term of decay. If one can avoid the many harms and master the arts of yin and yang, this is the Way of not dying.

Heaven and Earth part by day and unite by night, exchanging three hundred and sixty times a year, yet only four times do their essence and qi harmonize—thus they give birth to the myriad things without exhaustion. If men could emulate this, they too could endure forever.

Next is the practice of ingesting qi. If one attains its Way, evil qi cannot enter—this is the foundation of cultivating the body. The remaining arts of exhalation and inhalation, guiding and stretching, and visualizing the ten thousand spirits within, including holding the shadow and guarding the form, number over one thousand seven hundred methods, along with the proper orientation of the four seasons, self-reproach and repentance, and the disciplines of rising and retiring—these are not the true Dao. They may instruct beginners and correct their minds.

Cherishing essence and nurturing the body, ingesting qi and refining the form, the ten thousand spirits guard themselves. Without this, the constructive and defensive qi wither, and the ten thousand spirits depart—no amount of thought can retain them.

Fools who pursue the Dao neglect its root and chase its branches. Told the ultimate truth, they do not believe it. Shown concise and essential texts, they call them shallow and recite them day and night. They pore over works like the *Great Clarity* and the *Northern Spirit Central Classic*, exhausting themselves to no avail—is this not lamentable?

Moreover, people suffer from many affairs, and few can abandon the world to dwell alone in mountains and caves. To teach them the Dao is ultimately futile—this is not the intent of a benevolent person. Simply knowing the Way of the bedchamber, the art of breath-holding, moderating thoughts, and regulating diet is enough to attain the Dao.

My former teacher initially composed the *Nine Capitals*, *Node Release*, *Concealment and Reclusion*, *Non-Action*, *Illumination of the Four Poles*, *Nine Chambers*, and other classics—thirteen thousand chapters in all—merely to guide those taking their first steps at the gate.”

The Attendant received all these essentials and taught them to the King. The King tested them and found them effective, wishing to keep them secret. He ordered that anyone in the kingdom who transmitted Pengzu’s Way be executed, and even sought to kill Pengzu to eradicate it.

Pengzu learned of this and departed, vanishing without a trace. Over seventy years later, he was seen by someone in the lands west of the Flowing Sands. The King, who consistently practiced Pengzu’s Way, attained a lifespan of three hundred years, his strength remaining as robust as that of a man in his fifties. Yet he later succumbed to the seductive wiles of a woman from Zheng, losing his Way and perishing. The common folk, in their talk, claim that Pengzu’s Way kills people—this misconception arose from the King’s prohibition of it. When Pengzu left Yin, he was seven hundred and eighty years old, yet his life did not end in natural death.

**Master White Stone**
Master White Stone was a disciple of the Central Yellow Elder. By the time of Pengzu, he had already lived over two thousand years. He refused to cultivate the Dao of ascending as an immortal, content merely with avoiding death and not forsaking the joys of the human world. His practices centered on the arts of sexual union, with the elixir of golden liquid as his highest attainment. Initially, he suffered from poverty and low status, unable to obtain the elixir. Thus, he raised pigs and herded sheep for over a decade, living frugally and saving diligently until he amassed ten thousand gold pieces. With this wealth, he purchased the elixir and consumed it, often boiling white stones for sustenance. He then settled on White Stone Mountain, and the people of his time called him Master White Stone. At times, he also ate dried meat and drank wine, and sometimes consumed grains. Each day, he could travel three or four hundred *li*, his complexion appearing like that of a man in his thirties. By nature, he enjoyed paying homage and preserving his spirit, as well as studying immortals’ scriptures and the *Great Simplicity Transmission*. Pengzu once asked him, “Why do you not take the elixir and ascend to Heaven?” He replied, “Is there truly greater joy in Heaven than here? The only thing I cannot abide is old age and death. Yet Heaven is filled with those of highest rank who must be served—this would be even more burdensome than the human world.” Thus, the people of his time called Master White Stone a reclusive immortal, for he was not eager to ascend to Heaven as an immortal official and sought no fame or recognition.

**Lord of Yellow Mountain**
The Lord of Yellow Mountain cultivated Pengzu’s arts and lived for several hundred years, retaining a youthful appearance. He, too, practiced earthly immortality and could not ascend in flight. After Pengzu’s departure, he compiled Pengzu’s teachings into the *Pengzu’s Classic*. Those who obtain *Pengzu’s Classic* are like the pine and cypress among trees.

**Feng Gang**
Feng Gang was a native of Yuyang.

Feng Gang often gathered the flowers of a hundred herbs, steeping them in water and sealing them with mud. Beginning in the first month and continuing until the end of the ninth, he buried them for a hundred days before decocting and forming them into pills. Those who had suddenly died would revive at once if this medicine were placed in their mouths. Feng Gang took this elixir for many years and lived for several centuries without aging. Later, he entered the Earth-Lung Mountain and departed as an immortal.

**Huang Chuping**
Huang Chuping was a native of Danxi. At the age of fifteen, he was sent to herd sheep when a Daoist, seeing his goodness and diligence, took him to a stone chamber in Golden Flower Mountain. Over forty years passed, and he no longer thought of home. His elder brother, Huang Chuqi, entered the mountains to search for Chuping but could not find him after many years. Later, in the marketplace, he encountered a Daoist skilled in divination and asked, “I had a younger brother named Chuping. I sent him to herd sheep, and he vanished. Now, over forty years have passed, and I do not know whether he lives or has died. I wish for you to divine his fate.” The Daoist said, “In Golden Flower Mountain, there is a shepherd boy named Huang Chuping. Is he not your brother?” Chuqi, astonished and overjoyed, followed the Daoist to seek him and indeed found him. The brothers wept with joy. Chuqi then asked, “Where are all the sheep?” Chuping replied, “The sheep are just east of the mountain.” Chuqi went to look but saw only countless white stones. Returning, he said to Chuping, “There are no sheep east of the mountain.” Chuping replied, “The sheep are there—you simply cannot see them.” They went together, and Chuping shouted, “Sheep, arise!” At once, the white stones transformed into sheep, numbering in the tens of thousands. Chuqi said, “How have you alone gained such divine powers? Can I learn them?” Chuping replied, “Only if you cultivate the Dao.” Chuqi then abandoned his wife and children and stayed with Chuping. Together, they ingested pine resin and *fuling* (poria) for five thousand days. They could sit or stand at will, vanish, walk in sunlight without casting a shadow, and retain the complexion of youths. Later, they returned to their hometown, but nearly all their relatives had died. They departed again, and before leaving, Chuping transmitted his methods to Nan Bo Feng, changed his surname to Chi, and took the name Chi Songzi. Chuqi changed his courtesy name to Lu Ban. Thereafter, dozens who transmitted and ingested this elixir attained immortality.

**Lü Gong**
Lü Gong, styled Wenjing, was fond of ingesting elixirs from a young age. He took one servant and one maid into the Taihang Mountains to gather herbs when suddenly three figures appeared in the valley. They asked Gong, “Do you seek long life? Why endure such hardship and peril?” Gong replied, “I truly seek long life, but I have not encountered a proper method. Thus, I gather and ingest these herbs, hoping for some small benefit.” One said, “I am surnamed Lü, styled Wenqi.” Another said, “I am surnamed Sun, styled Wenyang.” The third said, “I am surnamed Li, styled Wenshang. We are all immortals of the Great Clarity and Great Harmony Palace, here to gather herbs. We bestow completion upon new learners. Since you share our surname and your courtesy name contains half of mine, your fate is destined for long life. If you follow us to gather herbs, we will teach you the method of immortality.” Gong bowed and said, “I am fortunate to meet divine beings, but I fear my ignorance and many faults make me unworthy of instruction. If you deign to save me, it would be my rebirth.” He then followed the immortals. After two days, they transmitted a secret method to him and sent him back, saying, “Return to visit your hometown.” Gong bowed in farewell, and the immortals said, “Though you have been with us for only two days, two hundred years have passed in the human world.” When Gong returned home, he found only empty fields and no descendants. He encountered Zhao Guangfu, a descendant of his hometown several generations later, and asked where the Lü Gong family lived. The man, astonished, said, “Where do you come from, asking about such distant ancestors? I have heard from my forebears that there was a Lü Gong who took a servant and a maid into the mountains to gather herbs and never returned, presumed to have been devoured by tigers or wolves. Over two hundred years have passed—why do you ask?” He added, “Lü Gong had a descendant named Lü Xi, who lives ten *li* northeast of the city as a Daoist. Many people attend to him; you may easily find him.” Following Guangfu’s directions, Gong went to Xi’s home and knocked on the door, calling out. A servant came and asked, “Where do you come from?” Gong said, “This is my home. Long ago, I went to gather herbs with immortals. Over two hundred years have passed, and now I have returned.” Xi’s entire household was astonished and overjoyed. They rushed out barefoot, bowed, and wept, unable to contain themselves. After some time, Gong transmitted the divine method to Xi and departed. Xi was already eighty years old, but after ingesting the elixir, he grew younger by the day. At two hundred years of age, he entered the mountains and departed. His descendants, generation after generation, ingested this elixir, never aging or dying, and all attained immortality.

**Shen Jian**
Shen Jian was a native of Danyang.

Shen Jian’s family had served for generations as chief administrators, yet he alone was fond of the Dao and refused to take office. He studied the arts of Daoist practices, guiding and absorbing qi, ingesting medicinal substances, and the methods for prolonging life and reversing aging. He was also able to cure illnesses—no matter how severe, those who encountered him would recover. Over a thousand households sought his treatment. One day, as Shen Jian was about to embark on a distant journey, he left behind a servant boy, a servant girl, one donkey, and ten sheep, each with a single elixir pill. He instructed the host, saying, “Simply allow them to stay in your home; there is no need to trouble yourself with feeding them.” Then he departed. The host found this strange, saying, “He has left thirteen mouths here but not a single coin—what am I to do?” After Shen Jian’s departure, the host offered food and drink to the servants, but they vomited upon smelling it. When he gave grass to the donkey and sheep, they all avoided it and refused to eat, even attempting to bite people. The host was astonished. Over a hundred days later, the servants’ complexions and bodies grew radiant, surpassing their original state, while the donkey and sheep all became plump as if well-fed. Shen Jian returned after three years. He gave each of the servants, the donkey, and the sheep another elixir pill, and they resumed eating and drinking as before. Thereafter, Shen Jian ceased consuming grains, no longer ate, and could rise lightly into the air, flying back and forth. He continued thus for over three hundred years before vanishing without a trace, his whereabouts unknown.

**Hua Ziqī**
Hua Ziqī was a native of Huainan.

**Master of Shilu Lane**

The Master of Shilu Lane received the esoteric *Divine Treasure* formulas of the hidden immortals. The first was *Yiluo’s Flying Turtle Rite*, the second *Boyu’s True Mechanism*, and the third *The Balanced Formula*. Following their preparation and ingestion, he grew younger with each passing day, able to walk five hundred *li* in a single day and lift a thousand *jin* with his strength. Over a year, his movements transformed twelve times. Later, he ascended as an immortal.

**Yue Zichang**

Yue Zichang was a native of Qi. From youth, he was fond of the Dao. While traveling to Mount Huolin, he encountered an immortal who taught him the formula for *Red Pine’s Giant Sesame Powder*. The immortal told him, “When a serpent takes this medicine, it transforms into a dragon; when a person takes it, the old become youthful. It also enables one to ascend and descend upon the clouds, alter one’s appearance, strengthen *qi*, and refine essence—reviving the dead and nurturing life. If you practice this, you may transcend the world.” Zichang consumed the medicine and lived to one hundred eighty years, his complexion like that of a maiden. His nine wives and children all took the medicine: the aged reverted to youth, and the young ceased aging. They then entered the sea, ascended Mount Laosheng, and departed as immortals.

**Wei Shuqing**

Wei Shuqing was a native of Zhongshan. He attained immortality through ingesting mica. On the *renchen* day of the eighth month in the second year of *Yuanfeng* during the Han dynasty, Emperor Wu was idly residing in his palace hall when suddenly a man riding floating clouds and driving a white deer alighted before the hall. The emperor, startled, asked who he was. The man replied, “I am Wei Shuqing of Zhongshan.” The emperor said, “Is not Zhongshan among my subjects?” Shuqing made no reply and instantly vanished. The emperor deeply regretted this and immediately dispatched the emissary Liang Bozhi to Zhongshan to seek him out. There, they found Shuqing’s son, named Dushi, and brought him back for an audience.

The emperor questioned him, and Dushi answered, “My father was fond of the immortal’s Dao from youth. He refined his body with medicines for over eighty years, his form growing ever more youthful. One day, he left me behind, saying he would enter Mount Hua. Now, over forty years have passed, and he has never returned.” The emperor then sent Liang Bozhi and Dushi to Mount Hua to search for him.

Dushi and Liang Bozhi ascended the mountain together, but rain persisted for several days. Dushi then said, “Could my father not wish for me to accompany others?” He purified himself, ascended alone, and saw his father playing upon a stone with several companions. When Dushi arrived, he beheld his father seated beneath a dense canopy of purple clouds, upon a bed of white jade, with several immortal youths holding banners and staffs standing behind him. Dushi bowed twice in reverence. Shuqing asked, “Why have you come?”

Dushi fully recounted the emperor’s remorse at being unable to speak with his father, and thus had sent envoys with Dushi to come together. Shuqing said, “Formerly, I was dispatched by the Supreme Lord to warn the emperor of the time of calamity and the methods to rescue him from peril, that the dynastic fortune might be prolonged. Yet the emperor, obstinate and self-important, failed to recognize the true Dao, and instead sought to make me his subject. He was not worthy of instruction, so I departed. Now I must join the Central Yellow Great Unity to establish the celestial reckoning of the Nine and Five. I cannot return again.”

Dushi then asked, “Who were those with whom you were playing earlier?”
Shuqing replied, “Master Hongya, Xu You, Chao Fu, Prince Wang Zijin, and Xue Rong. The present age is on the verge of great chaos, and the world will languish. In several hundred years, earth will perish and metal will fall, and the Heavenly Lord will emerge—this will occur in the ren-chen year. I have a scripture of immortality hidden beneath the northwestern pillar of your home. Return, retrieve it, and follow its instructions to compound the medicine and ingest it. It will grant you eternal life, allowing you to ride the clouds and travel. Once you have mastered the Way, come join me here. You need no longer be a subject of Han.”

Dushi bowed in farewell and departed. Upon digging, he found a jade casket sealed with the incense of flying immortals. He retrieved it, followed its instructions, and ingested the medicine—it was five-colored mica. He also taught Liang Bozhi, and together they ascended as immortals, telling nothing of this to Emperor Wu.

Wei Boyang
Wei Boyang was a man of Wu.

Wei Boyang was born of a noble family yet by nature favored the arts of the Dao, refusing official service. He lived in seclusion to cultivate his nature, unknown to his contemporaries. Later, he entered the mountains with three disciples to compound the divine elixir. When the elixir was complete, his disciples’ resolve wavered, so he tested it, saying: “Though the elixir is now finished, we must first prove it. Let us feed it to a dog—if the dog takes flight, we may consume it; if the dog dies, we must not.”

Boyang had brought a white dog with him into the mountains. There was also a toxic elixir, its cycles incomplete and its ingredients not yet fully harmonized, which would induce a temporary death if ingested. Boyang then fed the toxic elixir to the white dog, and it died at once. He asked his disciples: “We feared the elixir might not succeed, yet now that it is done, the dog dies upon consuming it. I fear this does not accord with the will of the spirits. If we take it, we may suffer the same fate as the dog—what should we do?”

His disciples asked: “Master, will you consume it?”

Boyang replied: “I have turned my back on the world, abandoned my home, and entered these mountains. If I do not attain the Dao of immortality, I will not return. Whether I live or die, I shall take the elixir.”

He then consumed the elixir, and as soon as it entered his mouth, he died. The disciples looked at one another and said: “We compounded the elixir to attain long life, yet consuming it brings death—what are we to do?”

One disciple alone said: “Our master is no ordinary man. Though he died after taking the elixir, could this not be intentional?” He too consumed the elixir and immediately died.

The remaining two disciples conferred: “The purpose of compounding the elixir was to seek long life. Now, taking it brings death—what use is it? If we do not consume it, we may yet live for decades in the world.” They resolved not to take it and left the mountain together to purchase coffins for Boyang and their deceased fellow disciple.

After the two had departed, Boyang rose, placing the elixir he had consumed into the mouths of the dead disciple and the white dog—both revived. The disciple’s surname was Yu. Together, they ascended as immortals.

As they encountered woodcutters entering the mountain, Boyang wrote a letter to his hometown, sending his gratitude to the two disciples. The disciples then deeply regretted their decision.

Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi* (*The Kinship of the Three*), in three scrolls, on the mutual resonance of the Five Phases. Though its discourse resembles an exegesis of the *Zhouyi*, it in fact borrows the hexagrams’ imagery to expound the principles of elixir-making. Yet Confucian scholars, unaware of the affairs of immortals, have instead annotated it as a treatise on yin and yang, wholly missing its essential purport.

Shen Xi was a man of Wu Commandery. He studied the Dao in Shu but knew only how to dispel misfortune and cure illnesses, aiding the common folk, without knowledge of ingesting medicinal substances. His merit and virtue moved Heaven, and the celestial spirits took note of him.

While Xi and his wife, née Jia, were traveling by carriage to visit their daughter-in-law, Zhuo Kongning, they suddenly encountered along the road a white deer-drawn chariot, a green dragon-drawn chariot, and a white tiger-drawn chariot, each followed by dozens of riders. All were clad in crimson robes, bearing insignia and swords, their splendor filling the road. They asked Xi, “Have you seen Master Shen the Daoist?”

Startled, Xi replied, “I do not know of whom you speak.”

“Shen Xi,” they clarified.

“That is I,” he answered. “Why do you ask?”

The mounted officer said, “Xi has rendered service to the people, his heart never straying from the Dao. From youth, his conduct has been faultless, yet his lifespan is not long, and his allotted years are nearly spent. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi pity him. Today, we celestial officials have been sent to welcome him. Attendant Gentleman Bo Yan rides the white deer chariot; Transcendent Lord Sima Sheng, the green dragon chariot; and Envoy Xu Fu, the white tiger chariot.”

In an instant, three immortals appeared before him, clad in feathered robes and bearing tablets. They presented Xi with a white jade plaque inscribed in cinnabar with blue jade characters. Xi knelt to receive it but could not read the script. They declared him Attendant Gentleman of the Azure Vault, Keeper of the Registers of Life and Death for Wu and Yue. Then they bore him away to ascend to Heaven.

At the time, laborers tilling the fields all witnessed the spectacle but knew not what it was. Suddenly, a great mist arose. When it cleared, Xi and his carriage had vanished, leaving only his ox to wander into the fields and graze on the sprouts. Some who recognized the beast as Xi’s told his family and disciples. Fearing that malevolent spirits had concealed Xi in the mountain valleys, they spread out across a hundred *li* to search for him, but to no avail.

Four hundred years later, Xi unexpectedly returned to his hometown. He sought out his descendant of several generations, a man named Huai Xi. Huai Xi told him, “According to our family’s oral tradition, our ancestor was an immortal. Now, the immortal has indeed returned.”

Xi stayed for several dozen days. He recounted that when he first ascended to Heaven, he was not granted an audience with the Heavenly Worthy but saw only Lord Lao seated facing east, attended by officials on either side. Xi could not offer thanks but sat in silence. The palaces were resplendent, wreathed in clouds of five colors—mysterious yellows—beyond description. Hundreds of attendants surrounded him, many of them maidens and youths. In the courtyard stood jeweled trees, their branches luxuriant, while dragons, tigers, and apotropaic beasts frolicked among them. A resonant clamor, like the ringing of bronze or iron, filled the air, though its source was unknown. The four walls gleamed, inscribed with talismans.

Lord Lao’s form stood nearly ten feet tall, his hair unbound and robes flowing, a radiance emanating from his head. After a brief interval, jade maidens presented a golden tray and jade cup filled with an elixir, saying, “This is the divine cinnabar. Those who consume it shall not die.” Xi and his wife each received a *daogui* of the elixir, and they drank it before offering thanks. Afterward, they were given two dates, each the size of a chicken’s egg, and a strip of dried meat five inches long. Lord Lao then sent Xi away, saying, “Return to the mortal world and heal the illnesses of the people. When you wish to ascend to Heaven again, inscribe this talisman and hang it from the tip of a pole, and I shall come to welcome you.” He bestowed upon Xi a talisman and a scripture of immortal arts. In the space between breaths, Xi fell into a slumber and awoke upon the earth.

Many later obtained his methods of practice.

**Chen Shi’an**

Chen Shi’an was a man of Jingzhao. He served as a retainer to Guan Shuping and was by nature kind and benevolent. Upon seeing birds or beasts on the road, he would step aside to avoid disturbing them. He never trod upon living creatures nor took life. At thirty, Shuping, who was fond of the Dao and sought communion with spirits, encountered two immortals who had disguised themselves as scholars. They accompanied Shuping on his travels to observe him, though he did not recognize them as immortals. Over time, his ardor waned.

One day, as Shuping prepared a fine meal inside, the two immortals returned to his gate. They asked Shi’an, “Is Shuping at home?”

“He is,” Shi’an replied. He went inside to inform Shuping, who was about to go out when his wife stopped him, saying, “Those starving scholars only seek to fill their bellies. Do not feed them.” Thus, Shuping sent Shi’an out to say he was not at home.

The two men said, “You said he was here just now, and now you say he is not. Is it your master’s command that we leave?” The two grew more amiable, and Shi’an, speaking truthfully, explained the situation. They conferred, saying, “Shuping has toiled for years, and today he meets us two yet grows remiss. Had he not encountered us, his efforts would have nearly come to naught.” They then asked Shi’an, “Do you enjoy leisure and play?”

“I do not,” he answered.

“Do you long for the Dao and seek immortality?”

“I do long for the Dao, but I have no means to know it.”

“If you truly long for the Dao,” they said, “meet us tomorrow morning beneath the great tree north of the road.”

Shi’an arrived early at the appointed place, but by dusk, the two had not appeared. He rose to leave, saying, “Those scholars must have deceived me.” Just then, the two called out from beside his ear, “Shi’an, why are you so late?”

“I came at dawn,” he replied, “but I did not see you.”

The two said, “We have been sitting right beside you all along.” After repeatedly setting appointments, Shi’an always arrived early. Seeing that he was teachable, they gave him two elixir pellets and instructed, “Return home, take no more food or drink, and dwell apart.” Shi’an followed their instructions, and the two often visited him there.

Shuping found it strange, saying, “Shi’an stays in an empty room—how can there be voices? Yet when I go, I never see anyone. Why is this?” Shi’an replied, “I speak to myself.” Seeing that Shi’an ate nothing, drank only water, and rested in seclusion, Shuping suspected he was no ordinary man. Realizing his own failure to recognize worth, he sighed, “The Dao is noble, virtue is precious—they do not depend on age. Though my parents gave me life, without a teacher, I cannot attain longevity. Whoever first grasps the Dao becomes the teacher.” He then performed the rites of a disciple, bowing morning and night to serve Shi’an, sweeping and cleaning for him. When Shi’an’s Dao was perfected, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Before departing, he transmitted the essential Way to Shuping, who later also attained immortality.

**Li Baba**
Li Baba was a man of Shu, and none knew his true name. He appeared across generations, and those of his time reckoned he was already eight hundred years old, so they called him by that name. Sometimes he concealed himself in the mountains and forests, sometimes in the marketplace. Learning that Tang Gongfang of Hanzhong sought the Dao but had not met an enlightened teacher, he wished to teach him the supreme Way. First, he went to test him, posing as a hired laborer. Gongfang did not recognize him.

Li Baba worked with greater care than others, and Gongfang cherished and favored him. Later, Li Baba feigned illness, growing so weak he seemed near death. Gongfang summoned physicians, had medicines prepared, and spent tens of thousands without regret, his concern etched on his face. Then Li Baba developed foul sores covering his entire body, oozing pus and blood, their stench unbearable—no one could bear to go near. Gongfang wept for him, saying, “You have toiled for my family for years, only to fall gravely ill. I long for your recovery and spare nothing, yet you do not improve. What can be done for you?”

Li Baba said, “My sores can be cured, but they must be licked.” Gongfang had three maids lick them. Li Baba said, “The maids’ licking cannot heal me. If you lick them, I may recover.” Gongfang did so. Li Baba then said, “Your licking still cannot cure me. If your wife licks them, I will be healed.” Gongfang had his wife do so.

Li Baba said, “The sores are now healing, but I must bathe in thirty *hu* of fine wine to fully recover.” Gongfang immediately prepared thirty *hu* of wine and placed it in a large vessel. Li Baba rose and bathed in the wine, and his sores vanished entirely, his body smooth as congealed fat, without a trace of scarring. He then told Gongfang, “I am an immortal sent to test you. You have shown utmost sincerity, so I have come to instruct you. You are certainly teachable, and now I will transmit the secret of transcending the world.” He had Gongfang, his wife, and the three maids who had licked his sores bathe in the leftover wine, and they all grew youthful, their complexions radiant and beautiful.

He gave Gongfang a scroll of alchemical scriptures. Gongfang entered Mount Yuntai to compound the elixir. When the elixir was complete, he ascended as an immortal. The site where he raised his household to heaven remains in Hanzhong.

**Li A**
Li A was a man of Shu.

The people of Shu saw him through the generations, yet he never aged, remaining as before. He often begged in the markets of Chengdu, and whatever he received he would immediately use to relieve the poor. He would depart at night and return by dawn, yet none in the market knew where he lodged. If someone asked about past events, Li A would say nothing. Instead, people would observe his countenance: if his expression was joyful, all matters would be auspicious; if his demeanor was grim and sorrowful, all matters would be inauspicious; if he smiled, there would be great celebration; if he sighed softly, there would be deep sorrow. Such omens were never inaccurate.

There was a man named Gu Qiang who suspected Li A was an extraordinary being and often attended to him. He once followed Li A back to his lodging and found it to be in the mountains of Qingcheng. Later, Qiang wished to follow Li A again, but fearing tigers and wolves on the path, he carried his father’s long sword for protection. Li A saw this and grew angry, saying, “You follow me—why fear tigers?” He took Qiang’s sword and struck a stone, breaking it. Qiang secretly worried about the damaged blade. The next morning, he followed Li A again, who asked, “Are you troubled by the broken sword?” Qiang replied, “I truly fear my father’s anger.” Li A then took the sword and struck the ground with it, first with his left hand, then his right, restoring it to its original state before returning it to Qiang.

Qiang followed Li A back to Chengdu. Before they arrived, they encountered a speeding carriage on the road. Li A placed his foot beneath it, and the wheels crushed his shin, breaking it. He immediately fell dead. Qiang, startled, watched closely, and after a moment, Li A rose, pressing his hands upon his leg, which was restored as before. Qiang was eighteen when he first saw Li A, who appeared to be about fifty. By the time Qiang was over eighty, Li A remained unchanged. Later, Li A told others, “I have been summoned by name to Kunlun Mountain,” and he never returned.

**Wang Yuan**
Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, was a native of Donghai.

Wang Yuan was nominated as *Xiaolian*, appointed Gentleman Cadet, and gradually promoted to Gentleman of the Palace with the rank of *Zhongsan Dafu*. Well-versed in the Five Classics, he was especially proficient in celestial patterns, the essentials of the *He* and *Luo* diagrams, and could foresee the rise and fall of the realm, discerning the fortunes and misfortunes of the Nine Provinces as if they lay in his palm. Later, he abandoned his post and entered the mountains to cultivate the Dao. Upon achieving mastery, Emperor Huan of the Han heard of him and repeatedly summoned him, but he refused to appear. The prefectural governor was ordered to compel him into a carriage and bring him to the capital. Wang Yuan lowered his head and sealed his lips, declining to respond to the imperial edict. Instead, he inscribed over four hundred characters on the palace gate’s wooden panels, all foretelling future events. The emperor, displeased, had the writing scraped away, but though the outer layer of characters vanished, those beneath reappeared, the ink having penetrated deep into the wood.

Wang Yuan had no descendants, yet the people of his hometown transmitted his legacy through generations, revering him together. Chen Dan, a former Grand Commandant of the same commandery, built a Daoist chamber for him, paying homage morning and evening, seeking only blessings and the dispelling of misfortune, never aspiring to learn the Dao. Wang Yuan resided in Chen Dan’s home for over forty years. During this time, no one in Dan’s household fell ill, died, or suffered misfortune; even their servants and livestock thrived, their fields and silkworms yielding a hundredfold, and their official ranks steadily rising. Later, Wang Yuan told Dan, “My destined term is nearing its end, and I must depart. I can no longer stay. Tomorrow at noon, I shall leave.” When the hour arrived, Wang Yuan died. Knowing he had transformed and departed, Dan dared not place him on the ground, but wept and sighed, “Master, you abandon me—what shall I do?” He prepared a coffin and incense, dressing the body on the bed. After three days and nights, the corpse suddenly vanished, the clothing and sash untied, like a cicada’s molted husk.

Over a hundred days after Wang Yuan’s departure, Dan also died. Some said Dan had attained Wang Yuan’s Dao and transformed away; others claimed Wang Yuan, sensing Dan’s impending end, had left him behind. Later, Wang Yuan wished to travel east to Mount Guacang. Passing through Wu, he visited the home of Cai Jing at Xu Gate. Cai Jing was a commoner, yet his bones bore the marks of a transcendent. Wang Yuan, recognizing this, sought him out. He told Jing, “Your fate decrees ascension to immortality, so I intend to take you to fill a vacancy among the celestial officials. However, you lack Daoist cultivation. Now, your *qi* is scant while your flesh is abundant—you cannot ascend directly but must undergo *shijie*. This dissolution is swift, like slipping through a dog’s burrow.” After imparting essential instructions, he departed. Soon after, Jing’s body grew feverish as if aflame, and he craved water. His family drew water to drench him, but it evaporated like droplets on scorching stone. For three days, he wasted away to skin and bones. He entered his chamber, covered himself with a quilt, and vanished. When they lifted the quilt, only his skin, head, and feet remained, like a cicada’s shed husk.

Over a decade later, Jing suddenly returned home. Though he had left aged, he now appeared youthful, his hair turned black again. He told his family, “On the seventh day of the seventh month, Lord Wang will pass by. Prepare several hundred *hu* of food and drink to offer his retinue.” Then he departed. On the appointed day, his family borrowed pots and jars to prepare hundreds of *hu* of food and drink, arranging them in the courtyard. That day, Wang Yuan indeed arrived. Before reaching Jing’s home, the sounds of drums, flutes, pipes, and a procession of men and horses filled the air. As they drew near, all were astonished, unable to discern their origin. Upon reaching Jing’s home, the entire household saw Wang Yuan, wearing a *yuanyou* cap, vermilion robes, tiger-headed knee guards, a five-colored sash, and a sword. His beard was sparse, his complexion golden, and his stature average. He rode a feathered carriage drawn by five dragons, each of a different hue, with banners, flags, and a retinue preceding and following him, his majesty akin to a great general’s. Twelve jade flasks, their mouths sealed with wax and honey, accompanied him. The musicians rode qilin, descending from the heavens to alight—not traveling by road.

Once arrived, his attendants vanished, leaving only Wang Yuan seated. After a moment, he summoned Jing’s parents and siblings for an audience. He then dispatched a messenger to invite Ma Gu, though none knew what deity she was. He said, “I respectfully report that I have not lingered among mortals for a long time. Now gathered here, I wonder if the Lady might briefly come to converse?” Soon, the messenger returned, his voice heard though his form unseen. He relayed, “Ma Gu bows twice. It has been over five hundred years since we last met. Though hierarchy demands reverence, I have longed for this meeting. Your message reached me as I was about to depart, but I was first summoned to inspect Penglai. Now, I shall pause briefly before returning. Once done, I will come to pay my respects. I hope you will not leave immediately—let us meet in this interval.”

When Ma Gu arrived, the sounds of her procession preceded her, though her retinue was half the size of Wang Yuan’s. Upon her arrival, Cai Jing’s entire family saw her. She was a beautiful maiden of eighteen or nineteen, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading to her waist. Her garments bore patterns yet were not of brocade or silk; their radiance dazzled the sun, indescribable and unlike anything in the mortal world. She entered and bowed to Wang Yuan, who rose to receive her. Once seated, she summoned the kitchen attendants. Countless gold and jade cups and plates appeared, the dishes mostly flowers and fruits, their fragrance permeating the interior and exterior. She broke off a piece of dried meat—roasted pine and cypress—and said it was *lin* jerky. Ma Gu remarked, “Since I began receiving guests, I have witnessed the Eastern Sea transform into mulberry fields three times. Recently, at Penglai, the waters were shallower than before, barely half their former depth. Will it soon become dry land again?” Wang Yuan smiled and said, “The sages all say the seas will one day rise as dust.” Ma Gu wished to see Cai Jing’s mother and his sister-in-law, but when she saw Jing’s brother’s wife, who had recently given birth, she exclaimed, “Ah! Stop—do not come forward.”

She then asked for a small amount of rice, and upon receiving it, scattered it upon the ground, saying the grains would dispel the impurity. When they looked, the rice had all turned into genuine pearls. Wang Yuan smiled and said, “Sister, you are still so young at heart. I am old now and no longer take pleasure in such playful transformations.”

Wang Yuan addressed Cai Jing’s family, saying, “I wish to offer you all some wine. This wine comes from the celestial kitchens, its flavor rich and potent—unsuitable for ordinary mortals to drink undiluted, for it may corrode the intestines. Today, I shall mix it with water. Do not be alarmed.” He then blended one *sheng* of wine with one *dou* of water, stirred it, and served it to Cai Jing’s family. Each person drank about one *sheng* and became intoxicated. After some time, the wine ran out, and Wang Yuan said to his attendants, “It is not enough. Go and fetch more.” He gave a thousand coins to the old woman of Yuhang, sending word to purchase wine from her. Soon, the messenger returned with an oilskin bag containing about fifty *dou* of wine. The messenger relayed the old woman’s reply: she feared earthly wine would not befit the esteemed guests.

Ma Gu’s fingernails were unlike human nails. Cai Jing thought to himself, *If my back ever itches terribly, it would be wonderful to have such nails to scratch it.* Wang Yuan, already aware of Cai Jing’s thoughts, immediately had someone drag Cai Jing away and whip him, saying, “Ma Gu is a divine being. How could you suddenly think her nails could be used to scratch your back?” The whip struck Cai Jing’s back, though no one holding it was visible. Wang Yuan told Cai Jing, “My whip cannot be wielded lightly.”

There was a man named Chen, whose given name is lost, who had once served as a magistrate and lived near Cai Jing’s home. Hearing that divine beings were visiting Cai Jing’s household, he came to the door, kowtowed, and begged to be received. Wang Yuan then brought him forward and spoke with him. The man begged to be taken into service, comparing himself to Cai Jing. Wang Yuan said, “Rise for now and stand facing the sun.” Wang Yuan observed him from behind and said, “Ah, your heart is not upright, and your shadow is crooked. You cannot be taught the Dao of immortality. Instead, I shall appoint you to a position as an earthly overseer.” As he prepared to leave, he placed a talisman and a manual into a small box and gave it to Magistrate Chen, saying, “This will not enable you to transcend the world but will allow you to live out your full lifespan—over a hundred years. It can dispel misfortune and cure illnesses. If a patient’s life is not yet at its end, or if they are innocent of wrongdoing, bring the talisman to their home, and they will recover. If malevolent spirits or blood-consuming ghosts cause harm, carry this manual to the local earth god’s officials, and they will capture and send away the ghosts. You must also judge the severity of each case and act according to your discretion.” Magistrate Chen used this talisman to treat illnesses, and hundreds of households attested to its efficacy. He lived to be one hundred and eleven years old before passing away. After his death, his descendants continued to use the talisman, but it no longer worked.

After Wang Yuan departed, the several hundred *hu* of food and drink prepared by Cai Jing’s family, which had been laid out in the courtyard, vanished entirely, though no one was seen consuming it. Cai Jing’s parents secretly asked him, “What kind of divine being is Lord Wang? And where does he reside?”

Cai Jing replied, “He often resides on Mount Kunlun, traveling between Mount Luofu and Mount Kuocang. On each of these three mountains stand palaces, their halls identical to an imperial court. Lord Wang is perpetually occupied with the affairs of the Celestial Bureau, all matters passing through his authority. When he departs, he does not always bring his full retinue of officials, but rides a yellow *lin* unicorn, accompanied by only a few dozen attendants. With every journey, he sees the mountains and forests far below, suspended hundreds of *zhang* above the earth. Wherever he arrives, the spirits of mountains and seas come to pay homage, some numbering in the thousands.”

Several years later, Cai Jing briefly returned home, and Wang Yuan sent a letter to Magistrate Chen. The script was bold and expansive, though not refined. Before this, no one had known of Wang Yuan’s reputation, but from this point on, it became known through Magistrate Chen’s records. To this day, Cai Jing’s family has preserved Lord Wang’s handwritten letters and talisman transmissions in a small box, keeping them secret.

Boshanfu—Boshanfu was a native of Yongzhou.

Within the Hua Mountains, he cultivated his mind through meditation and ingested elixirs, returning home from time to time to visit his kin. Thus he remained unaged for over two hundred years. Whenever he entered a household, he would immediately perceive the household’s accumulated virtues, transgressions, merits, and faults across generations as if witnessing them firsthand. He could also foretell future fortunes and misfortunes, and all his words proved true. Seeing his niece advanced in years and afflicted by illness, he gave her medicine. At the time she took it, she was seventy, but gradually she grew younger, her complexion like a peach blossom.

During the Han dynasty, an envoy passing through saw a woman in the eastern part of Xihe City beating an old man. The old man’s hair was white as frost, and he knelt to receive the blows. The envoy, astonished, asked the reason. The woman replied, “This is my son. Long ago, my uncle Boshanfu taught me a divine formula, and I instructed my son to take it, but he refused. Now he has grown decrepit while I have not, so in my anger, I strike him.” The envoy asked their ages, and the woman answered, “I am two hundred and thirty years old, and my son is seventy.” Later, this woman entered the Hua Mountains and departed as an immortal.

Mozi, whose given name was Di, was a native of Song. He served as a grandee in Song, externally administering the classics and internally cultivating the Daoist arts. He authored ten chapters, which came to be known as the *Mozi*. Those who studied his teachings in later generations diverged from the Confucians. He emphasized frugality and simplicity, often criticized Confucius, and was particularly skilled in the arts of warfare and defense.

When Gongshu Ban, a general of Chu, constructed siege ladders to attack Song, Mozi heard of it and traveled to Chu on foot. His feet became so worn that he tore his robe to wrap them, arriving after seven days and nights. He met with Gongshu Ban and said, “You build siege ladders to attack Song—what crime has Song committed? Chu has surplus land but lacks people; to kill those you lack to seize what you already have cannot be called wisdom. Song is innocent, yet you attack it—this cannot be called benevolence. Knowing this and not remonstrating cannot be called loyalty. Remonstrating and failing cannot be called strength.”

Gongshu Ban replied, “I cannot speak to the king about this.”
Mozi said, “Then let me see the king.”
Gongshu Ban assented.

Mozi met the king and said, “Suppose a man were to abandon his ornate carriage, coveting his neighbor’s broken-down cart; discard his brocade robes, coveting his neighbor’s coarse hempen garment; forsake his fine meats, coveting his neighbor’s糟糠—what kind of man would this be?”
The king of Chu said, “Such a man must be mad.”
Mozi replied, “Chu possesses Yunmeng, teeming with elk and deer, and the Yangtze and Han rivers, rich with fish and turtles—making it the wealthiest in the world. Song lacks even pheasants, rabbits, or well-frogs—this is like fine meats compared to糟糠. Chu has nanmu, catalpa, pine, and oak, while Song has not even a few feet of timber—this is like brocade compared to coarse hemp. I have heard that Your Majesty’s ministers plan to attack Song—this is no different.”
The king said, “Well said.”

Now Gongshu Ban had already built cloud-ladders, declaring that Song would surely fall.” Thereupon, Mozi met with Gongshu Ban to contest the attack on Song. Mozi loosened his sash to represent the city walls and used his headscarf as defensive weapons. Gongshu Ban then deployed his siege engines, altering his tactics nine times. Yet Mozi countered each of the nine assaults. Gongshu Ban’s siege implements were exhausted, while Mozi’s defenses remained more than sufficient.

Gongshu Ban, defeated, said, “I know how to attack you, but I will not speak of it.”
Mozi replied, “I know how you would attack me, yet I will not speak of it either.”

The king of Chu asked the reason, and Mozi said, “Gongshu Ban’s intent is merely to kill me, believing that without me, Song would have no defense. Yet my disciples—Qin Guli and three hundred others—have long been wielding the defensive implements I devised, standing atop Song’s walls, awaiting the arrival of the Chu invaders. Even if you kill me, it would not sever their resolve.”

Thus, Chu desisted and no longer attacked Song.

At the age of eighty-two, Mozi sighed and said, “The affairs of the world are now settled; glory and rank cannot be long preserved. I shall relinquish worldly concerns to wander with the Red Pine Immortal.” He then took leave of his disciples and entered the mountains to refine his spirit and contemplate the supreme Dao, envisioning the realm of immortals.

Thereupon, in the stillness of night, he often heard voices reciting scriptures amid the mountains to his left and right. After Mozi had retired to rest, someone would come and drape a robe over him, and Mozi would then offer them sustenance. Suddenly, a figure arose and inquired of him, “Are you a spirit of the mountains and peaks, or a transcendent immortal who has come to cross into this world? I beseech you to tarry a while and instruct me in the teachings of the Dao.”

The divine being replied, “You possess supreme virtue and a love for the Dao, which is why I have come to await you. What is it that you seek?”

Mozi said, “I wish to attain longevity and endure as long as Heaven and Earth.”

Thereupon, the divine being bestowed upon him a plain book and the *Vermilion Essence Pill Formula*, along with the *Divine Teachings and Admonitions on the Transformations of the Five Phases*—twenty-five scrolls in all. The divine being said to Mozi, “You are already destined for immortality, and with your intelligence, you shall master these teachings without need of a teacher.”

Mozi bowed and received them. After compounding the elixir, he achieved its effects, then compiled its essentials into the *Five Phases Record* in five scrolls. Thus, he attained the state of an earthbound immortal and concealed himself to evade the turmoil of the Warring States. By the time of Emperor Wu of Han, envoys such as Yang Liao were dispatched bearing silks and jade disks to summon Mozi, but he did not emerge. His complexion remained ever that of a man of fifty or sixty, as he wandered among the Five Peaks, dwelling in no single place.

Liu Zheng was a man of Pei Commandery.

Liu Zheng was a man of prodigious talent and vast learning, whose studies encompassed all things. He deeply reflected that the honors and riches of this world are but fleeting, whereas the study of the Dao could secure longevity. Thus, he abandoned the path of advancement and sought the arts of nurturing life. Diligently pursuing rare knowledge, he traveled a thousand *li* without hesitation. If he encountered one superior to himself—even a servant or retainer—he would invariably take them as his teacher.

Later, he mastered the *Five Phases Record* of Mozi and, in addition, ingested the Vermilion Essence Elixir. At over one hundred and eighty years of age, he retained the appearance of a youth. Skilled in transformations and concealment, he could make one person appear as a hundred, a hundred as a thousand, and a thousand as ten thousand. He could also conceal an entire army, causing men to transform into a grove of trees, or into birds and beasts. When he tested his powers by taking another’s belongings and placing them among his own followers, no one noticed. Moreover, he could cultivate trees of the five fruits, causing them to bloom and bear edible fruit instantly, and conjure a traveling kitchen to serve hundreds. By blowing breath, he summoned winds that sent sand and stones flying; with a point of his finger, houses, mountains, forests, and vessels would tilt and crumble, yet with another gesture, they would return to their original state.

He could also assume the form of a beautiful woman or craft wooden figures. In a single day, he could traverse thousands of *li*. With a breath, he raised clouds from water; with a wave of his hand, he summoned mist. He could heap earth into mountains and pierce the ground to form abysses. His age and size shifted in an instant—now old, now young; now large, now small. He entered water without getting wet, walked upon its surface, and summoned fish, turtles, jiao-dragons, and tortoises from rivers and seas, causing them all to come ashore. From his mouth, he exhaled qi of five colors, spanning ten *li* in breadth and rising to touch the heavens. He could leap hundreds of *zhang* into the air, ascending and descending at will. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Sun Bo

Sun Bo was a man of Hedong. Possessing refined talent, he was skilled in composition, having written over a hundred essays and recited hundreds of thousands of words of scripture. In his later years, he studied the Dao, mastering the arts of Mozi. He could set grasses, trees, metals, and stones ablaze, their flames illuminating the land for tens of *li*. He could also ignite flames within his own body, exhale fire from his mouth, and with a mere point of his finger, cause great trees and lush grasses to wither and char—yet if he pointed again, they would return to their former state. He could also cause the soldiers of an entire army to each become a pillar of fire. Once, a man whose escaped slave was hiding among the troops sought Sun Bo’s aid, unable to capture the fugitive. Sun Bo said to the slave’s master, “I will set their camp ablaze, and the slave will surely flee. You need only watch closely and seize him.” Thereupon, Sun Bo cast a red pellet into the midst of the army. In an instant, flames rose to the heavens, and the slave indeed fled—only to be captured. Sun Bo then threw a green pellet into the fire, and the blaze immediately extinguished. The buildings and belongings that had been scorched and burning were all restored to their original state, undamaged.

Whenever Sun Bo summoned fire, whatever he burned could not be quenched by others, no matter how much water they poured upon it—only when he himself willed it to cease would the flames die. He could walk through fire and water without so much as wetting his own body, and even ensure that hundreds of his followers remained untouched as well. He could also lead people onto the water’s surface, spreading mats for them to sit, eat, drink, and make merry, while others danced upon the water without sinking or getting wet, reveling the whole day through.

Those afflicted by illness would seek Sun Bo’s healing, and without a word, he would simply point at them, declaring their recovery—and so they would be cured. He could also enter stone cliffs in the mountains or boulders upon the earth, at first leaving only his back and ears visible between the rocks, until after a long while, he vanished entirely. He could swallow dozens of swords and blades, then pass through walls as if they were riddled with holes. He could bend a mirror into a sword and a sword into a mirror, maintaining the transformation for hours—until he pointed at them, and they reverted to their original forms.

Later, he entered Mount Linlü, compounded the elixir of immortality, and ascended as a transcendent.

Ban Meng

Ban Meng’s origins are unknown. Some say she was a woman. She could fly for an entire day and sit suspended in empty space, conversing with others. She could also enter the earth, first sinking to her feet, then to her waist and chest, until only her headwrap remained visible—before vanishing entirely. With a touch of her finger, she could carve the ground into a well from which water could be drawn. She could inhale the tiles from a person’s roof, causing them to fly into her home. Once, she gathered dozens of mulberry and fruit trees from a household, piling them into a mountain-high heap. After ten days, she blew upon them, and each returned to its original place as before.

She could also hold ink in her mouth, spread paper before her, chew the ink, and with a single spray, fill the page with characters, each bearing meaning. Later, she consumed alchemical wine and elixirs, living over four hundred years while retaining a youthful appearance. Finally, she entered Mount Dazhi and departed as an immortal.

Yuzi

Yuzi, surnamed Zhang and named Zhen, was a native of Nanjun. In his youth, he studied the classics, but when King You of Zhou summoned him, he refused to go, sighing, “A person living in the world loses a day with each passing day, drifting farther from life and nearer to death. Yet they cling to wealth and honor, unaware of how to nurture their nature. When their allotted time ends and their breath ceases, they die. Even if they were kings or lords, with gold and jade piled like mountains, what use are they when reduced to ashes and dust? Only the Dao of immortals, which transcends the world, offers boundless existence.”

He became a disciple of Chang Sangzi, learning his many arts, and later devised his own school of methods, composing over a hundred volumes of Daoist texts. His teachings centered on *wu kui*, and he was deeply versed in the principles of the Five Phases, expounding their subtleties to nurture life, cure illness, and dispel misfortune. He could summon whirlwinds to uproot trees and shatter houses, conjure clouds, thunder, rain, and mist, and transform grass, thatch, tiles, and stones into the six livestock or dragons and tigers, which would immediately come to life and move. He could divide his form into hundreds or thousands of copies.

He could traverse the Yangtze and Han rivers, and with a mouthful of water, spray it to instantly form pearls and jade that never reverted.

At times, he would hold his breath without exhaling, becoming so immovable that even when lifted, pushed, or bent, he would not budge—remaining thus for tens of days before rising as before. When traveling with his disciples, he would mold pellets of clay into horses for each, instructing them to close their eyes. In an instant, they would find themselves mounted on great steeds, covering a thousand *li* in a single day.

He could exhale qi of five colors, rising several *zhang* high, and if a flying bird passed by, he would point at it, causing it to fall to the ground. Standing by a deep pool, he would present a talisman and summon fish and turtles, which would all scramble onto the shore. He could also enable his disciples to see objects a thousand *li* away with a single glance, though this power could not be sustained for long.

During his practice of *wu kui*, he would fill a vessel with water and place it between the two *kui*, then blow upon it. Immediately, a crimson radiance would rise from the water, swirling and glowing brightly. This water could cure all illnesses—those afflicted internally drank it, while external ailments were treated by bathing in it, and all were healed at once.

Later, he entered Mount Kongtong to compound the elixir. Upon its completion, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

**Tianmenzi**
Tianmenzi, surnamed Wang and named Gang, was particularly versed in the essentials of nourishing life. His scripture states:

*“Yang arises at *yin* [3–5 a.m.], the essence of pure Wood;
Yin arises at *shen* [3–5 p.m.], the essence of pure Metal.
When Wood is cast against Metal, it is invariably harmed—
thus Yin can dissolve Yang.
Women who adorn themselves with powder follow the whiteness of Metal.
Therefore, the true person and Daoist must focus their minds, refine their subtleties, and discern the waxing and waning of these forces:
I move with the Azure Dragon, while they move with the White Tiger;
they advance with the Vermilion Bird, while I retreat with the Dark Warrior—
this is the Way of immortality.
Moreover, the nature of Yin is such that it is more urgent than Yang,
yet it externally restrains itself, refusing to petition Yang—
this shows that Metal will not yield to Wood.
Yang’s nature is fierce and impetuous, its ambitions and resolve boundless,
but when it comes to socializing and feasting, its voice softens and its words humble—
this reveals Wood’s awe of Metal.”*

After practicing this Way, Tianmenzi lived to two hundred and eighty years, his complexion like that of a child. He attained immortality by ingesting *zhuli* and ascended to the Dark Realm.

**Jiulingzi**
Jiulingzi, surnamed Huang and named Hua, mastered the arts of reversing aging, embryonic breathing, internal visualization, and the Dao of the Five Phases. His scripture states:

*“This method can repel weapons, deter tigers and wolves, safeguard one’s person, protect one’s household, ensure the prosperity of descendants, harmonize inner and outer relations, so that people rejoice at your presence and long for you in absence. It is fitting for military service and advantageous for distant travel. If others plot against you, their schemes will dissolve; a thousand calamities and ten thousand misfortunes will be suppressed and never arise. It blocks the path of deceit and seals the gate of monstrosities. Those who curse you will find their curses ineffective; those who cast hexes upon you will see their sorcery fail. The worthy of the world will all come to revere you, winning the favor of spirits and the hearts of the people. Silkworms and crops will flourish, the six livestock will multiply, servants will remain loyal, illnesses will be cured, official troubles will resolve, disputes will be won, and all affairs will prosper—ushering in an age of unbroken peace.

Those who practice this Way will attain its profound wonders.”*

”Having dwelt among mortals for over five hundred years, his countenance grew ever more youthful. Later, by ingesting refined cinnabar, he ascended as an immortal and departed.

**Master of the Northern Culmen**
Master of the Northern Culmen, surnamed Yin, named Heng.
His scripture states: “The Dao of cultivating the body treasures the nurturing of spirit as its jewel. The art of nourishing nature brings death in and sends life out. Those who practice this constantly will come to match Heaven itself. Seeking life through life is true life indeed; refining iron with iron is called truth, refining man with man is called spirit.”
Later, he consumed divine elixir and became an immortal.

**Master of the Uncrossed Gorge**
Master of the Uncrossed Gorge, surnamed Li, named Xiu.
His scripture states: “The weak can restrain the strong; yin can overcome yang. Ever as if treading deep abysses or perilous heights, guiding a galloping steed or driving a chariot—this is the Dao of long life.”
He lived over four hundred years, his complexion never fading. He authored forty scrolls, titled *The Source of the Dao*, and by ingesting elixir, ascended to Heaven.

**Master of the Great Yang**
Master of the Great Yang, surnamed Li, named Ming. He was a close friend of Jade Master from the same era. After Jade Master had perfected the Dao, Master of the Great Yang became his disciple, observing all the rites of a student without the slightest negligence. Jade Master held him in particular affection. Though he had over thirty fellow disciples, none could compare to him. Yet he loved wine and was often drunk, for which he was frequently reproached. Nevertheless, he was skilled in the Dao of the Five Phases. Though his temples were streaked with white, his skin remained plump, his face radiant, and at over three hundred years, he showed no signs of aging.
Jade Master admonished him: “You ought to govern your body and nurture your nature, serving as a model for all the worthy. Yet you sink into drunken stupors, neglecting your practice and failing to compound the great elixir. Even if you lived a thousand years, you would still not escape death—how much less one of a few hundred? This is conduct unworthy even of the common and foolish, let alone one who has attained understanding.”
He replied: “I took up the study late in life, and my nature is stubborn; the dregs of the mundane world have yet to be purged. Thus, I use wine to drive them out.” Such was his arrogance.
He mastered the art of the Seven Jeweled Trees, deeply grasping the essentials of the Dao. By ingesting elixir, he attained immortality, often appearing in the world. For five hundred years, his face remained that of a young boy, though he drank heavily and his temples and beard were hoary white.

**Lady of the Great Yang**
Lady of the Great Yang, surnamed Zhu, named Yi. She expounded upon the Dao of the Five Phases, deepening and refining its subtleties to achieve wondrous and swift effects. At two hundred and eighty years, her complexion was like peach blossoms, her lips as if holding cinnabar, her skin lustrous, her brows and temples painted as if by an artist—she appeared no older than seventeen or eighteen. She served Master of the Uncrossed Gorge, who, upon completing the elixir, bestowed it upon her. She too attained immortality and ascended to Heaven.

**Lady of the Great Yin**
Lady of the Great Yin, surnamed Lu, named Quan. She was intelligent and quick-witted, surpassing others in wisdom. Fond of Jade Master’s Dao, she had grasped much of its methods but had yet to attain its profound mysteries. With no enlightened teacher at hand, she set up a wine shop by the roadside, secretly seeking the worthy. For years, she waited in vain, finding none who surpassed her.
One day, Master of the Great Yang passed by and drank at her shop. Observing her reverent manners and refined speech, he sighed deeply: “She moves with the White Tiger and Flying Serpent; I move with the Azure Dragon and Dark Warrior. In this vast world, who can recognize such things?”
Hearing this, she rejoiced greatly and sent her younger sister to ask the guest: “What is your earthly number?”
He replied: “I do not know. But south is three, north is five, east is seven, west is seven, and the center is one.”
Her sister returned and reported: “This guest is a great worthy, a man of utmost virtue and Dao. I asked one question, and he answered five!”
She then invited him into her chamber of the Dao, preparing exquisite delicacies and rare treasures to entertain him. After she had finished speaking, Master of the Great Yang said: “We serve together in the court of the Heavenly Emperor, drink together from the waters of divine radiance, ascend to the rank of Jade Master, and embody the treasures of the Five Phases. I befriend only the worthy—what is there to find strange?”
Thereupon, he transmitted to her the essentials of supplementing the Dao and the method for steaming the elixir. By compounding and ingesting it, she attained immortality. At the time of her ascension, she was already two hundred years old, yet her complexion was that of a young child.

**Lady of the Great Mystery**
Lady of the Great Mystery, surnamed Zhuan, named He. Widowed in her youth, a master of arts examined her and her mother and declared: “Neither of you will live long.”
She then practiced the Dao and studied Jade Master’s methods. Thereafter, she could enter water without getting wet. In the depths of winter, she walked upon water in a single garment, her complexion unchanged, her body warm. She could endure this for days on end. She could transport government offices, palaces, cities, and the dwellings of common folk to other places—appearing unchanged to the eye, yet when pointed at, they vanished from their original location. She could open locked doors, chests, and cabinets with a mere gesture. She could cause mountains to crumble and trees to wither at a point of her finger, and with another point, restore them to their former state.
When traveling with her disciples through the mountains at dusk, she would strike a rock with her staff, and doors would open within it. Entering, they found chambers furnished with beds, tables, curtains, and provisions of food and wine as if in a home. Though they journeyed ten thousand *li*, such lodgings were always at hand. She could make small objects suddenly grow as large as a house, and large objects shrink to the size of a hair’s tip. When wildfires raged to the heavens, she could extinguish them with a breath. She could stand unscathed in the midst of raging flames, her clothes untouched by fire. In an instant, she could transform into an old man, a child, a carriage, or a horse—nothing was beyond her power.
She practiced thirty-six arts, all of wondrous efficacy, reviving countless dead. None knew what she consumed to nourish herself, yet her complexion grew ever more youthful, her hair as black as a crow’s. Suddenly, she ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.

**Master of the Southern Culmen**
Master of the Southern Culmen, surnamed Liu, named Rong.”

She could blend powder into eggs, then spit out dozens of them; when boiled and eaten, the yolks would emerge, leaving a small residue of powder no larger than a fingertip. Taking this powder and applying it to a cup, she would recite an incantation, and it would transform into a turtle. When boiled, it was edible, its innards fully formed, while the powdered cup became the turtle’s shell. If the meat was removed, the shell would revert to a powdered cup. She could also take water, recite an incantation, and turn it into fine wine, which would intoxicate those who drank it. With a wave of her hand, she could make a great tree appear; if someone broke off a slender branch and used it to thatch a roof, it would remain for days, gradually withering and yellowing, no different from a real tree. Having ingested the Cloud-Frost Elixir, she ascended as an immortal.

**Master of Yellow Reeds**
Master of Yellow Reeds, surnamed Ge, named Qi, was highly skilled in healing. Even from a thousand *li* away, if one merely sent their name, he could treat them, and all would recover without ever needing to see the patient in person. He was adept in the arts of qi restraint: tigers, wolves, and all manner of insects could not move; flying horses could not depart; and water could be made to flow backward for a *li*. At two hundred and eighty years of age, he could lift a thousand *jun* and run as swiftly as a galloping horse. Above his head, a five-colored qi often rose over a *zhang* high. During great droughts, he could descend into the depths to summon dragons forth; once urged, they would ascend to the heavens, and rain would promptly fall—this he did time and again. One day, he mounted a dragon and departed, bidding farewell to all his kin and friends, never to return.

**Scroll Five**
**Master Horse Neigh**

Master Horse Neigh was a native of Linzi in the state of Qi. By nature gentle, his courtesy name was Junxian. In his youth, he served as a county clerk, but during a pursuit and capture, he was wounded by bandits and momentarily died. A Daoist adept saved him with divine medicine, reviving him, whereupon he abandoned his post to follow his master. Initially, he sought only to heal his wounds, but learning of the master’s Way of long life, he remained in service for many years, carrying his master’s satchel. They traveled west to Mount Nüji, north to Mount Xuanqiu, and south to the Lu River, journeying throughout the world and enduring every hardship. He received the three-scroll *Scripture of the Great Clarity Divine Elixir*, returned to the mountains to compound the medicine, and consumed it. Unwilling to ascend to heaven, he took only half a dose and became an earthbound immortal. He never stayed in one place for more than three years, always moving elsewhere, so that people often did not recognize him as an immortal. He built houses, kept servants and followers, rode in carriages and on horses, appearing no different from ordinary folk. In this way, he wandered through the Nine Provinces for over five hundred years, and many came to know him, marveling that he did not age. Later, he refined the Great Elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Yin Changsheng was a native of Xinye and a kinsman of Empress Yin of the Han. Born into wealth and nobility, he disdained rank and honor, devoting himself entirely to the arts of the Dao. Hearing that Master Horse Neigh had attained the Way of transcending the world, he sought him out, and upon meeting, served as a menial, personally bearing the toil of labor. Horse Neigh did not teach him the Way of transcendence but instead spoke with him day and night of worldly affairs and the work of farming and husbandry. For over twenty years, Changsheng never slackened. Of the twelve who served Horse Neigh at the same time, all eventually departed, but Changsheng alone remained, his reverence and courtesy growing ever more earnest. Horse Neigh then said to him, “You truly are one who can attain the Dao.” He took Changsheng into the mountains of Qingcheng, where he transmuted yellow earth into gold to demonstrate the process. Erecting an altar on all four sides, he transmitted the *Scripture of the Great Clarity Divine Elixir* to him before departing.

Changsheng returned and compounded the elixir, consuming only half a dose, and thus did not ascend to heaven. Instead, he produced tens of thousands of *jin* of gold, which he distributed to the poor and needy throughout the world, whether he knew them or not. He traveled across the land with his wife and children, and his entire household ceased to age. Later, on Mount Pingdu, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Before departing, he wrote nine scrolls, saying: “Those who attained immortality in high antiquity were many, and their cases cannot all be recounted. Since the rise of the Han, however, forty-five have attained immortality, and with me, the number becomes forty-six. Twenty of them underwent liberation by means of the corpse, while the rest ascended to heaven in broad daylight.”

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* says: “I have heard the old saying, ‘If you do not walk at night, you will not know that there are night-walkers on the road—so too, those who do not attain immortality cannot know that there are those in the mountains and forests who study the Dao and achieve immortality.’ Though Yin Jun had not yet ascended to heaven after consuming the divine elixir, like attracts like, and voices resonate with one another, so he naturally sought out and encountered immortals. Thus he came to know the number of immortals in recent times. Yet the common folk dismiss this as untrue, and because they themselves have not heard of such things, they claim they do not exist—how lamentable! The scholars of the marshes and wilds, who find fulfillment in reclusion and delight in the classics, do not flaunt their literary brilliance, nor do they seek fame. They do not pursue advancement or strive for recognition, so how could the uninitiated recognize them—let alone immortals? Why should they be in such haste to make their deeds known to those at court? Yin Jun wrote in his own account: ‘In the first year of the Yan’guang era of the Han, north of the mountains of Xinye, I received the essential secrets of the divine elixir from Master He. Having perfected the Dao and departed the world, I left this behind in the famous mountains. Whoever obtains it shall be ranked among the Perfected, moving freely between this world and the next—what business have they with the mundane? The essential Way of not dying lies in the divine elixir. Practices such as circulating qi, guiding and pulling, bending and stretching, and consuming herbs and plants can only extend life slightly. Without seeking what transcends the ordinary, one cannot become a celestial immortal. If you wish to hear the Dao, this is the essential teaching: accumulation through study leads to effortless attainment of the divine. The superior person, upon hearing this, will strive with diligence; the inferior will laugh and dismiss it as untrue. Those who understand the divine elixir shall enjoy long life and enduring vision.’

Thereupon, Yin Jun inscribed a copy of the elixir scripture on yellow silk, sealed it in a stone casket, and placed it on Mount Song. He wrote another copy on yellow bamboo slips, inscribed in lacquer, sealed it in a casket of green jade, and deposited it on Mount Taihua. A third copy he inscribed on golden slips, sealed in a silver casket, and placed on Mount Shuijing in Shu. A fourth copy he wrote on white silk, rolled into a single scroll, and entrusted to his disciples, instructing them to transmit it through the generations. He also composed three essays to leave for posterity.

The first said: ‘My ancestors aided the sagely reigns of Yao and Shun, and even into the Han, they wore the purple seals of high office. Yet I alone love the Dao and remain a commoner, holding fast to my plain and lofty aspirations, serving no kings or lords. Having attained life by valuing life, what more could I seek? I leave behind the traces of the dusty world, riding the void and soaring on the floating clouds. The azure firmament bears my wings, and all things become my foes. I enter fire unscathed, tread water unmoistened, roam the Great Ultimate without care or sorrow. I sport in the immortal realms, pitying the foolish multitude. The passing of years and life is like a flowing river—suddenly, in the blink of an eye, they become dust and earth. Chasing after death, they refuse even a moment’s rest.’

The second said: ‘My sagely master embodied the Dao with steadfastness, ascending and descending in transformation, a neighbor to Master Red Pine and Master Wang Qiao. Among my fellow students, there were twelve of us who endured cold and hardship in seeking the Dao for over twenty springs. Many among us grew lax and negligent in their resolve and conduct. Alas, my companions—your fates were decreed by heaven. Heaven does not bestow its gifts carelessly; the Dao must return to the worthy. Now your bodies lie in the dark earth—when shall you return? O you who come after, strive with diligence and refine yourselves. Do not be led astray by the common stream or ensnared by wealth and rank. Once the divine Way is perfected, you shall ascend to the Nine Heavens, your lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries—how could it be a mere hundred million years?’”

Its third verse says: “From the time my hair was long, in youth I loved the Dao and virtue. I left my home to follow my teacher, wandering east and west, south and north, entrusting myself to the Five Turbidities. Avoiding the world, I concealed myself for over twenty years. By the side of famous mountains, I suffered cold without time to don clothes, hunger without leisure to eat. I dared not think of returning, dared not rest in old age. Serving my sagely teacher, I attended his countenance with joyful expression. Though my face was grimed and my feet calloused, he took pity and recognized me, then transmitted the essential instructions. His grace was unfathomable. My wife and children gained extended years, all enjoying boundless life. Gold was already refined, wealth amassed to ten hundred million. I commanded ghosts and spirits, jade maidens attended at my side. I attained deliverance from the world through the power of divine elixir.”

Lord Yin remained in the human realm for one hundred seventy years, his complexion like that of a youth, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Master Mao
Master Mao, whose name was Ying and courtesy name Shushen, was a native of Xianyang. His great-grandfather, Meng, styled Chucheng, studied the Dao on Mount Hua. After refining the elixir, he rode a red dragon and ascended to heaven—this occurred during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. A children’s rhyme said:
*“The immortal who attains the Dao is Mao Chucheng,
Riding a dragon to ascend to Great Clarity,
Now descending to Dark Continent to sport at Red City,
Succeeded in later generations by me, Ying.
If the Emperor studies this, the twelfth month becomes Auspicious Peace.”*
The events are recorded in detail in the *Records of the Historian*.

At that time, the First Emperor of Qin was seeking the Dao of immortality and long life. Hearing the rhyme, he believed his surname matched the prophecy and that he was destined to ascend to heaven. He thus issued an edict renaming the twelfth month *Auspicious Peace* and established festivals to align with it. He worshipped at Penglai and dispatched Xu Fu with boys and girls to enter the sea in search of the immortals’ medicine.

At eighteen, Master Mao entered Mount Heng to study the Dao. After twenty years, his practice was complete, and he returned home. His parents were still alive and, seeing him, grew angry: “As a son, you are unfilial. Instead of attending to our care, you chase after delusions, wandering the four directions.” They raised a staff to strike him.

Kneeling, the Master apologized: “I have received Heaven’s mandate and am destined to attain the Dao. Matters cannot be served in both ways. Though I have been unable to provide daily care, I have ensured your longevity and the peace of our family. My Dao is now complete—I cannot be beaten or humiliated, for it would be no small matter.”

His father’s anger did not abate. He seized the staff and struck, but the staff shattered into dozens of pieces, flying like arrows loosed from a bow, piercing walls and columns, leaving both deeply embedded. His father was startled and ceased.

The Master said: “What I just explained was precisely out of concern for this. If it had struck someone, there would have been injury.”

His father asked: “You claim to have attained the Dao—can you raise the dead?”

The Master replied: “Those whose sins are heavy and evil amassed cannot be revived. But those who died unjustly or prematurely can be restored to life.”

His father then asked about the dead in their village and who among them might be revived. The Master summoned the Earth God to inquire. His father heard voices conversing in the courtyard but saw no one.

The Master asked the Earth God: “Among the dead in this village, who can be revived?”

All present heard the Earth God reply: “So-and-so can be revived.”

The Master said: “Hasten to settle the matters binding him so his affairs may be resolved. Then he may be exhumed.”

After sunset, the Earth God returned: “The matters are settled. He may now be unearthed.”

The Master then instructed the dead man’s family to dig. They opened the coffin and lifted out the corpse. The dead man opened his eyes and stirred but could not yet speak. After being carried out, three days later he could sit and speak clearly. In this way, dozens were exhumed and revived, living for ten more years before dying again.

At that time, the Master’s younger brother, named Gu and styled Jiwei, and his next younger brother, named Zhong and styled Sihe, served the Han dynasty, attaining the rank of two thousand bushels. When Gu was about to assume office, several hundred villagers, relatives, and friends gathered to see him off. During the feast celebrating his family’s honor, Master Mao was also present. He said: “Though I do not hold the rank of two thousand bushels, I shall have a divine office. On the eighteenth day of the third month, I will assume my post—will you come to see me off?”

All the guests agreed: “This gentleman has attained the Dao and will depart. We will all come to send him off.”

The Master said: “If you deign to attend, I am deeply grateful for your kindness. But come empty-handed—do not spend anything. I will provide all that is needed.”

On the appointed day, several *qing* of land before the Master’s gate were suddenly leveled, not a blade of grass remaining. Suddenly, green silk tents appeared, spread with layers of white felt, accommodating thousands. Near and far, all marveled. People whispered among themselves, and the road was thronged with guests, far outnumbering those who had come to send off his brother.

Once the guests assembled, the Master greeted them with laughter and courtesy, as in ordinary etiquette. No attendants were seen, yet golden platters and jade cups appeared before each person. Exotic delicacies and rare fruits, unnamable, were served, along with fine wine and delicacies unknown to the guests. Music of strings and bamboo shook heaven and earth. As soon as food was consumed, more appeared, and all grew drunk and sated.

The next day, the officials arrived. The civil officials, clad in vermilion robes and purple sashes, numbered in the hundreds. The military officers, with armor, banners, and weapons gleaming in the sun, numbered over a thousand.

Master Mao then bid farewell to his parents and clan. Mounting a feather-canopied carriage, he departed, his retinue displaying banners, canopies, flags, and halberds like those of an emperor. His steeds were dragons, tigers, qilin, white cranes, lions, and other strange beasts and birds, unnamable and unknown. Tens of thousands of flying birds soared above, while flowing clouds and rosy mist enveloped his procession.

After traveling over ten *li* from his home, he suddenly vanished from sight. All who witnessed it sighed in wonder.

The Master then went directly to Jiangnan and settled on Mount Juqu. The mountain had grotto chambers where immortals dwelled, and he made it his abode.

The people at the foot of the mountain built a temple to honor him and pay their respects. The Master would often speak with others from within his tent; when he came and went, he might lead men and horses or transform into a white crane. Those who sought his aid for illness would boil ten chicken eggs and place them inside the tent. In an instant, he would toss them back one by one, the eggs appearing unchanged. Upon returning home and cracking them open, if the yolks were gone, the patient would recover; if soil was found inside, they would not. This served as an omen, though the eggs had shown no sign of being opened.

The temple was frequently filled with celestial music, rare fragrances, auspicious clouds, and propitious vapors. When the Master arrived, music and an entourage would escort him as he descended from the heavens, sometimes lingering for an entire day before departing. The people far and near relied on his virtue, free from droughts, floods, plagues, or locust infestations, as well as the harm of thorny plants, poisonous trees, tigers, or wolves. Thus, the mountain came to be called Mount Mao.

Later, his two younger brothers, each seventy or eighty years old, abandoned their official posts and left their families to cross the river in search of their elder brother. The Master had them take the *Four-Fan Elixir*, which reversed their aging and restored their youth. They cultivated in a grotto below the mountain for over forty years and likewise attained transcendence.

The Supreme Lord Lao commanded the envoys of the Five Emperors to present a jade tablet inscribed in gold, bestowing the *Nine Distinctions* upon the Master and appointing him as *Grand Prime Perfected*, *Minister of the Eastern Marchmount*, and *True Lord of Life and Death*, overseeing the registers of life and death in Wu and Yue. Thereafter, he ascended to heaven or descended to govern on Mount Qian.

The Supreme Lord also sent envoys with purple silk decrees to appoint Gu as *Lord of Stable Records* and Zhong as *Lord of Life Preservation*, both ranking among the highest perfected. Thus, they were collectively known as the *Three Mao Lords*. The texts of the *Nine Distinctions* and the purple silk decrees are not fully recorded here but are detailed in separate biographies.

Every twelfth day of the twelfth month and eighteenth day of the third month, the Three Lords would each ride a white crane to gather atop the mountain’s peak.

**Celestial Master Zhang Daoling**
The Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, styled Fuhan, was a native of Feng County in Peiguo.

A former scholar of the Imperial Academy, he broadly studied the Five Classics. In his later years, he sighed, saying, "These bring no benefit to one’s years or life." Thereupon, he pursued the Dao of longevity, obtaining the *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons*. He refined the elixir on Fanyang Mountain, and upon its completion, ingested it—able to sit or stand at will, even to vanish, gradually regaining his youth.

Later, within a stone chamber on Mount Wan, he acquired esoteric writings and secret texts, along with the arts of commanding the spirits of mountains and peaks. Their practice proved efficacious. Initially, as the Celestial Master witnessed the turmoil of the Central Kingdom, with those in power often imperiled, he withdrew to cultivate the land in Yuhang. Yet as Han governance declined, exactions grew boundless, making self-preservation difficult. Though he gathered disciples to teach, the literary Dao had withered, insufficient to rescue the realm or aid the age.

At fifty, the Master retired to cultivate the Dao, and within a decade, he had attained it. Hearing that the people of Shu were simple and teachable, and that its mountains were rich in minerals, he led his disciples into Shu, dwelling in reclusion on Mount Heming. There, he encountered the Venerable Lord, and at his hermitage, prepared medicinal ingredients, refining them according to the method. After three years, the elixir was complete, though he dared not ingest it. He told his disciples, "The divine elixir is now ready. If I take it, I shall ascend as a perfected one, yet I have not rendered great service to the world. I must first eliminate harm and promote benefit for the state, aiding the common people. Only then shall I consume the elixir, ascend lightly, and serve the Three Realms, that I may do so without shame."

Soon after, the Venerable Lord dispatched the Jade Maiden of Pure Harmony to teach him the methods of exhaling the old and inhaling the new, refining the qi of purity. After a thousand days of practice, he could inwardly perceive the five viscera and outwardly gather external spirits. He then performed the *Three Steps and Nine Traces*, treading the Dipper, following the direction of the *gang* to gather essence and expel malevolence. He battled the demonic lords of the Six Heavens, seizing the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, transforming them into courts of blessing, naming them *Realms of Transformation*. He demoted their leaders to the rank of *Yin Officials*.

Previously, tens of thousands of demonic spirits in Shu had held markets in broad daylight, spreading pestilence at will, and the people had long suffered their depredations. After the great demons of the Six Heavens were subdued, the Master expelled their hordes, banishing them to the barren lands of the northwest. He swore an oath with them, declaring, "Humans rule by day, ghosts by night. Yin and yang are distinct, each with its own domain. Those who violate this shall face the laws of the *Orthodox Unity*; punishment will be swift." Thus, the netherworld and the mortal realm were sundered, and humans and ghosts followed separate paths.

Today, on Mount Qingcheng in western Shu, there remains the *Ghost Market*, along with the *Celestial Master’s Oath Stone*, the *Heaven-and-Earth Stone*, and the *Sun-and-Moon Stone*.

**Luan Ba**
Luan Ba was a native of Shu.

The prefect appointed him as his *gongcao* and treated him as a master. Requesting to test his arts, Luan Ba entered a wall and vanished, while those outside the wall cried out in fear of tigers and wolves—only to see him reemerge. Later, he was promoted to Prefect of Yuzhang. There was a temple spirit there who could speak with people. Upon arrival, Luan Ba overthrew the local altar and inquired into its origins. It turned out the spirit was an old man who had once traveled to Qi as a scholar. The former prefect had given his daughter in marriage to him, and they had a son. Luan Ba went to Qi, inscribed a talisman, and transformed the spirit into a wildcat.

Later, as a court minister, on New Year’s Day during a gathering of officials, Luan Ba took a mouthful of wine, stood, faced the southwest, and spat it out. He memorialized, “My hometown of Chengdu is ablaze, so I have come to its aid.” The emperor dispatched a swift courier to investigate and was told, “At the moment the fire broke out on New Year’s Day, rain came from the northeast and extinguished it—all the rain smelled of wine.”

Though he often appeared dull-witted, as if devoid of understanding, this was merely the outward guise of one who had attained the Way. Many scholar-officials study the Dao, yet what they call the *Eight Brocades* or the *Six-Character Qi* are but mere breathing exercises and physical postures. They do not understand that qi and blood reside within the body and must not be disturbed, that their value lies in natural circulation. How many in the world still grasp this?

Though they sit in meditation all day, their minds race outward, restless as moths drawn to a flame or flies battering against a dawn-lit window—knowing only how to pursue gain and never how to avoid harm. There are fish in the sea that use shrimp for eyes; people laugh at them, unaware of the reason. Without the sun by day, one cannot gallop; without fire by night, one cannot see. Thus, those who study the Dao must ensure that external things cannot alter their nature. Alluring beauty and plainness, I regard as the same; grand mansions and thatched huts, I see as equal.

When the mind is settled and pure, utterly free of thought, guiding the qi will open all the body’s channels. Embracing purity and nurturing the Great Mystery, one avoids falling into the snares of the world. Then one knows the workings of spirit, the origins of qi, the return of essence—what path cannot be traversed?

His writings, *A Hundred Chapters Revealing the Secrets of the Dao*, are subtle and profound, a compass for those lost on the Way.

**Scroll Six**
**The Prince of Huainan**

Prince An of Huainan was devoted to the Way of divine transcendents, and many masters of esoteric arts from across the land gathered to follow him. One day, eight elders arrived at his court. Their appearance was withered and aged, their forms bent and frail. The gatekeeper said to them, “The Prince’s passion lies in the Way of divine transcendents—ascending to immortality, prolonging life, and enduring through the ages. Only those who possess extraordinary abilities are received with courtesy. Now, your aged and feeble state is not what the Prince should see.” He refused them several times, but the eight elders persisted in seeking an audience. The gatekeeper repeated his initial response.

The eight elders said, “If the Prince refuses to see us because of our aged appearance, then returning to youth would pose no difficulty.” With that, they shook out their robes, composed their bearing, and instantly assumed the forms of youths. The gatekeeper, astonished, led them inside. The Prince rushed to greet them, sandals reversed in haste, and received them with ritual propriety, calling himself their disciple. “Noble immortals, having descended from afar, what teachings do you bring to this humble one?” he asked. When he inquired after their names, they replied, “Our names are: Cultivator of the Five Constants, Master of the Seven Virtues, Branch of a Hundred Blossoms, Longevity of a Thousand Years, Leaf of Ten Thousand Pines, Call of the Nine Marshes, Cultivator of the Three Fields, and Summit of the Single Peak. Each of us can summon wind and rain, shake the earth with thunder and lightning, overturn the heavens and startle the earth, halt the sun and arrest the flow of rivers, command ghosts and spirits, lash demons and specters, pass through water and fire, shift mountains and rivers, and perform transformations without limit.”

At that time, the Prince’s minor attendant, Wu Bei, had committed an offense and, fearing execution, grew uneasy in his heart. He went to the frontier and reported a rebellion, accusing the Prince of treason. Emperor Wu grew suspicious and dispatched the Grand Master of Ceremonies with a tally to Huainan to investigate. When the Grand Master arrived, the eight elders said to the Prince, “Wu Bei is a subject who slanders his lord—Heaven will surely punish him. You should depart now. This is also Heaven’s decree for you. If you had no such affair, day after day, how could you remain in the mortal world?” They then took a cauldron and brewed an elixir, which they had the Prince consume. Over three hundred of his close kin and attendants ascended to heaven on the same day. Even the chickens and dogs that licked the elixir’s vessel flew away with them. The eight elders and the Prince paused their horses upon a mountain rock, leaving only the traces of men and beasts before vanishing without a trace.

The Grand Master reported these events to the Emperor, who was filled with deep regret and ordered Wu Bei’s execution. Thereafter, he widely summoned masters of esoteric arts, seeking the elixir of transcendence, but never obtained it. Later, when the Queen Mother of the West descended, she bestowed upon him the *Scriptures of the Immortals* and secretly granted him divine formulas, allowing him to attain the Way of corpse liberation. Thus, the jade caskets and golden staves of Maoling, the cinnabar elixirs that circulated among men, and the *Scriptures of the Bull-Holding Way* discovered in mountain caverns were all but traces of Emperor Wu’s quest for immortality.

**Li Shaojun**
Li Shaojun, styled Yunyi, was a native of Linzi in the state of Qi. From youth, he was fond of the Way. He entered Mount Tai to gather herbs and practiced the arts of fasting, reclusion, and preserving the body. Before his training was complete, he fell ill and languished in the mountain forests. Master Anqi happened to pass by and, seeing Shaojun, found him prostrate, begging for his life. Moved by his sincerity but knowing his illness was fatal, Master Anqi gave him a spoonful of *Divine Tower Powder*. Shaojun immediately rose to his feet.

Thereafter, Shaojun sought to follow Master Anqi, serving him as a slave and attendant, becoming his disciple. Master Anqi took Shaojun east to Red City, south to Mount Luofu, north to Great Rampart, and west to Jade Gate, roaming the Five Peaks, observing rivers and mountains for several decades. One day, Master Anqi said to him, “I have been summoned by the Dark Continent and must depart today. You are not yet ready to accompany me there, so we must part for now. In six hundred years, I will welcome you here again.” He then transmitted the methods of divine elixirs, alchemical furnaces, flying snow, and the oral pledges and secrets. Moments later, a procession of several hundred, led by dragons and tigers, arrived to escort Master Anqi. He ascended to heaven in a feathered carriage.

Shaojun then returned to the world. He purified himself and sold goods in the market, trading across the Six States. At times, he served as an official; at others, he practiced medicine or taught as a master. Sometimes, he lent his warmth to the poor, changing his name and wandering without revealing his mastery of the Way. By the time of Emperor Wu of Han, hearing that the Emperor was recruiting masters of esoteric arts and revered the Daoist arts, Shaojun—though impoverished and unable to compound the great elixir—sighed deeply to his disciples: “Old age approaches, death draws near, yet my resources are insufficient. To till the land, labor with my hands, or trade for money would never suffice to prepare the elixir. Moreover, I am clumsy in such matters. I have heard the Son of Heaven is fond of the Way. I wish to see him and request to compound the elixir. If I succeed, all desires will be fulfilled—whatever he seeks, he shall obtain. If the elixir is successfully refined, he will achieve it; if not, I shall depart. I have lived in this world for over five hundred years without holding even a minor office. If I do not act now, I shall surely become food for worms and ants.”

He then presented his methods to Emperor Wu, saying, “Your servant can congeal mercury into white silver and transmute cinnabar into yellow gold. Consuming this gold grants ascent to heaven in broad daylight, endless immortality, a body adorned with crimson feathers, and wings of radiant light. Rising, one soars beyond the heavens; descending, one enters the infinitesimal. Commanding flying dragons, the eight directions are traversed in an instant; riding white swans, the nine heavens are encompassed at once. The dates of the Eastern Sea grow as large as gourds; the plums of Mount Zhong are as vast as jars. Your servant has already consumed them. Having received the oral transmissions from my late master, Master Anqi, I can now ensure the success of these yellow substances.”

Thereupon, he was summoned for an audience and received with great reverence. The Emperor bestowed countless gifts upon him and provided him with a residence. Emperor Wu believed he had surely found one who could grant him transcendence.

Lijun once attended a drinking gathering hosted by the Marquis of Wu’an, where an elderly man of over ninety sat among the guests. Lijun remarked that he had hunted and roamed with the old man’s grandfather, and the old man, recalling his childhood, confirmed that he had indeed accompanied his grandfather and recognized Lijun. The entire assembly was astonished.

Upon seeing an ancient bronze vessel in Emperor Wu’s possession, Lijun gazed at it and identified it, saying, “This was once displayed in the Cypress Chamber by Duke Huan of Qi.” The Emperor examined its inscriptions and found it to be indeed a relic of Duke Huan of Qi, thus realizing that Lijun was a man of several hundred years. Yet in appearance, he seemed no older than fifty, his complexion radiant, his skin smooth and lustrous, his brows, eyes, mouth, and teeth resembling those of a fifteen-year-old boy. When the feudal lords and kings heard of his ability to grant immortality and restore youth to the aged, they sent him unbounded gifts of gold and coin. In secret, he compounded an elixir, but before consuming it, he approached the Emperor to request the *Five Emperors and Six Jia Spirit Flight Manuals*, twelve texts in all.

In the seventh month of the fourth year of Yuanfeng, the Emperor bestowed these upon Lijun. By the ninth month of the sixth year of Yuanfeng, Lijun claimed illness and submitted a memorial, saying: “Your Majesty’s thoughts are profound and wondrous, your aspirations fixed upon long life. Thus, you have sought out Daoist arts from afar, and your sincerity has moved the spirits, summoning divine beings to descend. Yet who, if not destined by fate, could achieve such harmony? The alchemical methods are weighty in their prohibitions; one must sever all foul odors, nurture all living things with benevolence, and refrain from harming even the smallest creatures. But Your Majesty has not abandoned extravagance, nor distanced yourself from sensual pleasures; killing and warfare do not cease, and anger remains unchecked. Ghosts without rest wander a thousand miles, and blood flows in the markets and courts. Under such conditions, the great elixir of the Dao cannot be perfected. Now, my illness has aged with me, and this frailty prevents me from personally observing the transformations of Pengzu’s cinnabar. Alas, this opportunity has slipped away.

My late master, Master Anqi, once bestowed upon me a formula for golden elixirs, trustworthy and proven. If one adheres strictly to its precepts and observes its prohibitions, it may then be prepared for use. When dark cinnabar soars like a rainbow and the ninefold cyclings of the mysterious and vermilion are complete, when the six and two are split and their essence flows to seize the sun, when frost and snow are gathered and the moon’s light is swept up by the wind—then, amid swirling cinnabar clouds and seething dragon-tiger energies, lead and tin are cast in to yield perfect gold, and a single grain of the elixir, once swallowed, instantly restores vitality. Only then may one mount a divine dragon to ascend, or ride a cloud chariot to traverse the distant heavens. This formula’s efficacy will prove that your humble servant has not spoken falsely.”

He then presented the Emperor with a lesser elixir formula, claiming illness, for it was not the great elixir. That night, Emperor Wu dreamed he ascended Mount Songgao with Lijun. Midway, an emissary in embroidered robes, riding a dragon and bearing a tally, descended from the clouds, saying, “The Great One summons Lijun.” The Emperor awoke and immediately dispatched messengers to inquire after Lijun, telling his close ministers, “As in my dream, Lijun is about to leave me.”

The next day, Lijun’s illness worsened. The Emperor personally visited him and ordered his attendants to receive his formula texts, but before they could be fully transcribed, Lijun passed away. The Emperor wept, saying, “Lijun is not dead—he has merely departed in this manner.” After his body was encoffined, it suddenly vanished, his outer garments and belt left intact, as if shed like a cicada’s husk. They then interred his clothing and belongings. Over a hundred days later, travelers reported seeing Lijun in the marketplace of Pu’s Slope in Hedong, riding a blue mule. The Emperor, upon hearing this, ordered the coffin opened, but it was empty, the nails undisturbed, with only a pair of shoes remaining. The Emperor deeply regretted not having pursued Lijun more earnestly.

The following year, the Cypress Beam Terrace burned, and all the secret and wondrous texts were lost.

Earlier, Lijun had been close to the Gentleman of Discussion, Dong Zhong. Seeing that Zhong suffered from chronic illness, his body withered and his qi diminished, Lijun gave him two doses of a completed medicine along with its formula. The ingredients included *wuji* grass, earth fat, refined *gen* beast marrow, *xianyou* root, the essence of a hundred flowers, and *longxian* grass, all gathered in the first ten days of the tenth month and decocted in a bronze cauldron by a virgin boy and girl. After consuming the first dose, the body would feel light; after three doses, fallen teeth would regrow; and after five doses, one’s lifespan would no longer be imperiled. Zhong, a man of unyielding integrity and vast learning in the Five Classics, did not believe in Daoist arts and often mocked those who consumed elixirs or studied the Way. He frequently memorialized the Emperor, arguing that human life was governed by fate, aging was natural, and Daoist arts could not prolong it. Though he witnessed Lijun’s marvels, he attributed them to innate nature rather than alchemy. He received the medicine but never consumed it, nor did he inquire about its formula, merely storing it away.

Months after Lijun’s departure, Zhong’s condition worsened. The Emperor, recounting his dreams of Lijun, expressed deep regret. Zhong then recalled the medicine Lijun had given him and decided to try it. Before finishing half a dose, he could walk again, his body grew strong and light, and his ailments vanished. When the medicine was exhausted, his vigor returned to that of a thirty-year-old. Only then did he believe in the existence of an undying Dao. He resigned his office, traveled in search of Daoists, and inquired about the formula’s meaning, but none could explain it. Nevertheless, his white hair turned black, and his appearance flourished. He lived to over eighty before dying, and on his deathbed, he told his son Daosheng, “I obtained Lijun’s divine formula but did not believe in its practice, and I regret it even in the Yellow Springs. You must seek out those versed in the arts and ask for an explanation. If you take this medicine for a long time, you will surely transcend the world.”

Moved by his father’s dying words, Daosheng refused to enter official service and instead traveled the world, seeking someone who could interpret the formula. In Jiangxia, he encountered Master Boze, who said, “This is not the golden elixir of divine cinnabar and jade, but it can extend life for several hundred years.” He then fully explained the formula’s meaning and the true names of its ingredients.

Daosheng compounded the medicine and consumed it, attaining a lifespan of three hundred and seventy years. He entered Mount Jitou, and it remains unknown whether he ultimately achieved the Dao. Contemporaries such as Zhuo Yuancheng, Zhang Ziren, Wu Shier, Cai Zisheng, Wei Zhongming, and Zhang Yuanda also took the medicine—some lived three hundred years, others five hundred—all dying without illness, without hunching, their faces unwrinkled, teeth unfallen, hair unwhitened, and their vitality undiminished. This was but a common and flawed formula of Lijun, yet it enabled such results—how much more might the superior formulas achieve?

Before Lijun departed, he secretly transmitted the Six Jia Left-and-Right Spirit-Flight Arts and Twelve Methods to Dongguo Yan, and entrusted the divine cinnabar formula for flying transcendence to Kuai Zishun of his hometown. These two later cultivated the Dao and both attained immortality. Lijun also taught Zixun the Kunlun Divine Continent’s *Zhenxing* method.

Wang Zhen
Wang Zhen, styled Shujian, was a native of Shangdang. In his youth, he served as a prefectural clerk, and at seventy, he took up the pursuit of the Dao. He sought out and read various immortals’ scriptures and miscellaneous sayings, including an account of a woodsman from Jiaojian during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou. While gathering firewood, the man sang as he walked:

*"Wrap the gold kerchief,
Enter the Gate of Heaven,
Call the long essence,
Sip the dark spring,
Sound the celestial drum,
Nourish the Muddy Pellet."*

At the time, no one understood its meaning, save the Archivist Under the Pillar, who said: “This is a man from the land of the living. His words are arcane—he is an ancient fisherman. How do I know? The eyes of an eight-hundred-year-old man have square pupils; those of a thousand-year-old man have vertical lines in their irises. This woodsman is a thousand-year-old man.”

Zhen read this text but could not grasp its purport. He searched far and wide, questioning Daoist masters for years until he encountered one who explained it to him: “This is but a rudimentary technique, sufficient only to arrest aging and restore youth.” The master then revealed the oral instructions:

*"Wrap the gold kerchief"* means to constantly guide the lung *qi* into the Muddy Pellet, circulating it slowly around the body so that one’s form remains radiant.
*"Sip the dark spring"* means to rinse the mouth with saliva and swallow it, preventing aging; practicing this for seven days yields results.
*"Sound the celestial drum"* means to tap the teeth thirty-six times each morning upon rising, calming the body’s spirits. At night, constantly visualize red *qi* entering from the Gate of Heaven, suffusing the entire body inside and out. Within the brain, it transforms into fire, refining the body until it shines with the same light as the flame. This visualization is also called *Lianxing* (Refining the Form).
*The Muddy Pellet* is the brain.
*The Gate of Heaven* is the mouth. Practicing the closure of *qi* and swallowing it is called *Taixi* (Embryonic Breathing). Practicing the rinsing of the spring beneath the tongue and swallowing it is called *Taishi* (Embryonic Nourishment). Never cease these practices.

Zhen received the instructions and diligently practiced the methods of Embryonic Breathing, Embryonic Nourishment, and Refining the Form, achieving remarkable results. After over two hundred years, his flesh remained luminous and fair, his gait outpaced horses, and his strength surpassed that of several men. He sighed, “This art only ensures I will not die—how could it compare to the divine cinnabar and golden-jade formulas?” He then became a disciple of Kuai Zixun, who taught him the *Zhouhou Fang* (Remedies to Keep at One’s Side).

When Emperor Wu of Wei heard of him, he summoned Zhen for an audience. Though Zhen appeared to be around thirty, the emperor suspected deception. After verifying his origins and finding that witnesses from his youth corroborated his story, the emperor came to believe in his attainment of the Dao and held him in great esteem. Xi Mengjie studied under Zhen for over a decade, and Zhen transmitted to him the method of steaming and ingesting minor elixirs, enabling his transcendence of the world. His hometown reckoned Zhen to be four hundred years old.

One day, accompanied by three young concubines, he ascended Mount Nüji and told his disciples, “I am going to compound the elixir.” He departed and never returned.

Xi could walk three hundred *li* in a day. Mengjie could subsist on a single jujube pit without eating, and after ten years, he could hold his *qi* without breathing, his body motionless as a corpse, for up to a hundred days or half a year. Though he had a household, this method was one Xi had learned from the people of the outskirts. Mengjie was steadfast and cautious, never speaking recklessly. Emperor Wu of Wei had a thatched hut built for him and ordered all the masters of esoteric arts to follow his instructions.

During the reigns of Emperors Hui and Huai of Jin, there were those who saw Mengjie in the markets of Chang’an. Emperor Wu of Wei had also been diligent in seeking out methods of transcendence, and Daoist masters received him with open minds, yet none of those who had attained the Dao were willing to reveal their essential teachings to him.

**Chen Chang**
Chen Chang dwelled on Zhuyu Mountain for six hundred years. Every season, he would set out offerings, though he neither ate nor drank, nor engaged in any cultivation. When people fell ill, he would give them water from his offerings to drink, and they would all recover.

**Liu Gang**
Liu Gang was the magistrate of Shangyu County. Both he and his wife, Lady Fan, had attained the Daoist arts. Once, as they sat together in a grove, Gang set fire to a house, starting from the eastern side, while Lady Fan summoned rain from the west, extinguishing the flames.

**Lady Fan**
Lady Fan was the wife of Liu Gang. Gang, styled Boluan, served as magistrate of Shangyu and also possessed the Daoist arts. He could summon ghosts and spirits, command transformations, and practice esoteric cultivation in secret, unknown to others. His governance was marked by clarity and simplicity, his decrees carried out with ease, and the people enjoyed his beneficence. There were no disasters of drought, flood, or pestilence, no harm from plagues or ferocious beasts, and every year brought great abundance, earning the admiration of all near and far.

In their leisure, he and Lady Fan would test their arts against each other. Once, as they sat in the hall, Gang set fire to the guest millhouse, starting from the east. Lady Fan restrained the flames, and they were immediately extinguished. In the courtyard stood two peach trees. Each cast a spell on one, making them fight each other. After a long while, the tree Gang had enchanted was defeated and fled beyond the fence. Gang spat into a plate, and it turned into a crucian carp. Lady Fan spat into the plate, and it became an otter that devoured the fish.

Later, Gang and Lady Fan entered Siming Mountain. On the road, they encountered a tiger. Gang prostrated himself, face to the ground, not daring to look up, but Lady Fan bound the tiger with a rope and led it home, tying it to the foot of their bed. In every trial of their arts, Gang was outdone.

When they were about to ascend to heaven, there stood beside the county hall a great honey locust tree. Gang climbed several *zhang* up the tree before he could take flight, but Lady Fan simply sat upright on her bed, rising gently like a cloud, and together they ascended to heaven.

**The Holy Mother of Dongling**
The Holy Mother of Dongling was a native of Hailing in Guangling. Married to a man of the Du clan, she studied the Dao under Liu Gang and could transform her form, appearing and disappearing without trace. Her husband did not believe in the Dao and often grew angry with her. Sometimes, when the Holy Mother went to heal the sick or visit others, Du’s resentment grew even stronger, and he reported her to the authorities, accusing her of licentious sorcery and neglecting her household duties. The officials arrested her and threw her in prison, but soon after, she flew out through the prison window. The crowd saw her rise higher and higher into the clouds, leaving behind a pair of shoes beneath the window. From then on, she ascended to heaven, and people far and wide built temples in her honor, making offerings and prayers that were answered without delay.

A green bird often appeared at her altar. When people lost something, they would ask where it was, and the green bird would alight above the thief, ensuring that no one on the roads dared to take what was not theirs. As time passed, this no longer occurred.

Even now, in the seas of Hailing, no one dares to commit theft or villainy. Those who attempt great crimes are drowned in wind and waves or killed by tigers and wolves, while lesser offenders fall ill or suffer injury.

**Kong Yuan**
Kong Yuan regularly consumed pine resin, *fuling*, and pine nuts, growing ever more youthful and vigorous. He was already over one hundred and seventy years old. When others drank wine, they would ask Yuan to propose a drinking game. He would plant his staff in the ground, stand on his head, and drink wine upside down—a feat no one else could match. He once dug a cave by the water’s edge, a little over a *zhang* square, and stayed inside, abstaining from grain for a month or two before emerging. Later, he entered the Western Flowery Peak and attained the Dao.

**Wang Lie**
Wang Lie, styled Changxiu, was a native of Handan. He regularly consumed yellow essence and refined lead, living to the age of two hundred and thirty-eight while retaining a youthful appearance. He could scale mountains as swiftly as if flying. In his youth, he was a scholar, and Ji Shuye was his companion. Once, Wang entered the Taihang Mountains and heard a sound like the mountains splitting. He went to investigate and found a fissure several hundred *zhang* long, from which a blue mud oozed like marrow. He took some, shaped it, and in an instant, it hardened into stone, resembling hot wax. Its taste was like that of non-glutinous rice. The *Scripture of the Immortals* states: “Every five hundred years, the immortals open a passage, and within it lies marrow. Those who obtain and consume it will live as long as heaven and earth.”

**She Zheng**
She Zheng, styled Xuanzhen, was a native of Badong.

She Zheng could recount the affairs of the Qin king as if they were before his very eyes. He often kept his eyes closed, even while walking, and none of his disciples had ever seen them open in several decades. One disciple persistently entreated him to open them, so Zheng finally did so—with a sound like thunder and a flash like lightning, causing all his disciples to prostrate themselves upon the ground. Li Babai called him "a mere child of four hundred years."

**Jiao Xian**
Jiao Xian, styled Xiaoran, was a native of Hedong. During the late Han, when chaos engulfed Guanzhong, he lost his family and fled alone to the islets of the river. There, he ate grasses and drank water, wearing neither clothes nor shoes. Once, Zhu Nanwang of Taiyangchang saw him from afar and took him for a lost scholar, intending to send a boat to fetch him. However, Hou Wuyang of the same commandery told the county officials, "He is but a mad fool," whereupon they registered him and provided him with a daily ration of five *sheng* of grain. Though others treated him with disdain, his conduct was never wayward: he always followed the paths between fields, never straying onto crooked trails. When gleaning, he never took the largest ears of grain. When hungry, he did not eat indiscriminately; when cold, he did not dress carelessly. Whenever he went out and saw a woman, he would conceal himself until she had passed before emerging. He built himself a hut like a snail’s shell, keeping it spotlessly clean. Inside, he fashioned a wooden bed and spread grass upon it. In the coldest weather, he would kindle a fire to warm himself, groaning and muttering to himself. During the Taihe and Qinglong eras, he once carried a staff and attempted to cross the river to the south. When the waters surged, he would say, "Not yet," and so people began to suspect he was not truly mad. Many of his words proved true, and they called him a recluse. He died at the age of eighty-nine.

**Sun Deng**
Sun Deng, styled Gonghe, was a native of Jijun.

Sun Deng had no family. In the northern mountains of his commandery, he dug a pit in the earth and dwelt there. He delighted in reading the *Book of Changes* and would strum a one-stringed zither. His nature was free of resentment or anger. Once, someone threw him into the water to provoke his wrath, but upon emerging, he merely laughed heartily.

He once resided in Mount Yiyang, where a charcoal-burner encountered him and recognized him as no ordinary man. Though he spoke to Sun Deng, he received no response. When Emperor Wen heard of him, he dispatched Ruan Ji to observe him. After meeting and conversing with him, Ruan Ji likewise received no reply.

Ji Kang accompanied him for three years, inquiring about his aspirations, yet Sun Deng never answered. As Ji Kang prepared to take his leave, he asked, "Will you truly say nothing, Master?" Sun Deng then replied:

"Do you understand fire? It is born with light, yet if it does not use its light, does its purpose lie in possessing light? A person is born with talent, yet if they do not use their talent, does their purpose lie in possessing talent? Thus, using light depends on obtaining fuel to preserve its form; using talent depends on recognizing constancy to preserve one’s life. Now, you possess much talent but little discernment—how will you escape the perils of this age? Do you seek nothing?"

Ji Kang could not heed his words. Later, he composed the *Poem of Dark Indignation*, writing: *"Once I felt shame before Liu Xia; now I feel shame before Sun Deng."* In the end, none knew how Sun Deng met his end.

Eastern Guo Yan

Eastern Guo Yan, styled Gongyou, was a native of Shanyang. From youth, he was fond of the Dao. Hearing that Li Shaojun possessed the Way, he sought an audience with him, kowtowing to beg for the role of attendant—handling his toiletries and sweeping his chambers. Shaojun granted his request and, seeing Yan’s diligence and meticulous care, deemed him capable. As he was about to depart, he secretly transmitted to Yan the arts of the Five Thearchs, the Six Jia spirits, the Left and Right Numinous Flight, and the Twelve Methods of Roaming the Void and Summoning the Perfected. He instructed him, saying, “These, too, are essential ways of the Dao. Practice them in secret, and you may ascend to heaven.” Having imparted the oral instructions, he sent him away.

Yan then returned home and compounded the *Numinous Flight Powder*, which he ingested. He could write by night, and in his bedchamber, his body emitted luminous specks. Employing the arts of the Left and Right Six Jia, he could divine fortune and misfortune. Those across the realm who were about to encounter calamity—whether acquaintances or strangers—he foresaw them all. He also commanded ghosts and spirits, subdued tigers and leopards, and performed feats without limit. In his village, he remained unaged for four hundred years.

In the twenty-first year of *Jian’an* during the Han, one day, several dozen men riding tigers and leopards came to welcome him. All his neighbors witnessed this. He took leave of his kin and friends, saying, “I am bound for the Terrace of Kunlun.” Before departing, he transmitted the divine elixir formula and the secret essentials of the *Five Thearchs’ Numinous Flight* to Master Yin.

Ling Shouguang

Ling Shouguang was a native of Fufeng.

At the age of seventy, he obtained the formula for the *Vermilion Ying* pills. After compounding and ingesting them, he grew ever younger, appearing as one of twenty. By the first year of *Jian’an*, he had already lived two hundred and twenty years.

Liu Jing

Liu Jing, styled Taixuan, was a native of Nanyang and a Gentleman-in-Attendance to Emperor Wen of the Han. Later, he abandoned worldly life to study the Dao under Master Zhang of Handan. He received the formula for the *Vermilion Ying* pills, compounded and ingested them, and at one hundred thirty years of age, appeared no older than thirty. Subsequently, he became a disciple of Su Zixun, who transmitted to him the *Five Thearchs’ Numinous Flight*, the *Six Jia of the Twelve Branches*, the *Ten Isles’ True Forms of the Immortals*, and other secret essentials. Jing practiced these according to the instructions, achieving great efficacy: he could command ghosts and spirits, summon wind and rain at will, conjure traveling kitchens, and vanish or appear at will. He could also foretell fortune and misfortune, even the exact day of their occurrence. Moreover, he could perform rituals to extend a person’s lifespan by ten years, and those who reached the appointed time all met their fate as predicted—even skeptics who reached the term did so without exception.

He wandered through the renowned mountains and the Five Peaks, traveling alongside Wang Zhen until he had traversed them all. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Wei, he still visited the homes of his various disciples. Huangfu Long, hearing of his mastery of the Dao, followed and served him. Jing taught Long the *Ninefold Mica Pill* formula and two methods of sexual arts. Long compounded and practiced them, growing daily in vitality, his hair never whitening, his teeth never falling out. At over three hundred years of age, it remained uncertain whether he had attained transcendence.

In the third year of *Huangchu* during the Wei, Jing entered the depths of Mount Heng and was never seen again. Before departing, he told Huangfu Long: “The essentials of cultivating the body lie in swallowing *jade spring* each morning, which strengthens the body, enhances one’s complexion, expels the Three Worms, and fortifies the teeth. *Jade spring* is the fluid in the mouth. Rise early in the morning, rinse the mouth until it is full of fluid, then swallow it. Gently tap the teeth thirty-four times, repeating this three times—this is called *refining the essence*, and it grants longevity.

The arts of sexual union are most perilous—only the loftiest adepts can practice them. The danger is beyond comparison, like riding a galloping ox or a startled horse. Your nature is prone to excess; should you not take this as a warning?”

“As Jing warned, I fear Long will not attain transcendence.

Yan Qing
Yan Qing was a native of Kuaiji. Poor and often burning charcoal in the mountains, he suddenly encountered an immortal who said: ‘Your bones and appearance suit immortality.’ Thereupon, the immortal gave him a scroll of plain silk, instructing him to place it in a clean vessel atop a high place, and also taught Qing the method of ingesting *shinao*. Qing then placed the scroll in a clean vessel atop a high place, and soon heard attendants—ten or more—constantly at his side. Whenever he transported charcoal out, these spirits would tow his boat, while others saw only the boat moving of its own accord. Later, he ceased grain and entered Lesser Huo Mountain.

Bo He
Bo He, styled Zhongli, studied the arts of *qi*-circulation and grain cessation under Master Dong. He also journeyed to West City Mountain to study under Master Wang, who told him: ‘The essentials of the Great Dao cannot be swiftly attained. I shall briefly visit Yingzhou; you may gaze intently at the stone wall within this grotto. Over time, you will see writing appear. Read it, and you will attain the Dao.’ He thus gazed at the wall. After one year, he saw nothing; after two years, writing appeared; after three years, he clearly beheld the *Scripture of the Great Clarity*, *Divine Elixir Formulae*, *Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, and *Charts of the Five Peaks*. He recited them until they flowed from his tongue. When Master Wang returned, he said: ‘You have attained it.’ He then compounded the divine elixir, consuming half a dose to extend his years boundlessly. With the other half, he transmuted fifty *jin* of gold to relieve the poor and ailing.

Zhao Qu
Zhao Qu was a native of Shangdang.”

After years of suffering from leprosy, Zhao Qu underwent countless treatments, yet none brought cure. On the verge of death, some suggested, “He cannot be saved—cast him away while still alive.” His descendants, passing the burden one to another, eventually prepared provisions and carried him to a mountain cave. There, Qu lamented his misfortune, weeping and sighing day and night. A month later, an immortal passed by the cave, saw him, and took pity. After inquiring after his plight, Qu, recognizing the stranger as one of extraordinary power, kowtowed and pleaded for mercy. The immortal then bestowed upon him a pouch of medicine, instructing him in its use. Qu consumed it, and within a hundred days, his sores healed completely, his complexion grew radiant, and his skin became smooth as jade. When the immortal returned to check on him, Qu expressed his gratitude for the gift of renewed life and begged to learn the formula. The immortal replied, “This is merely pine resin. There is an abundance of it in these mountains. Refine and consume it, and you may attain everlasting life.” Qu then returned home, where his family, mistaking him for a ghost, was struck with terror. Thereafter, he consumed pine resin without cease, his body growing lighter, his strength increasing a hundredfold. He could scale perilous heights and traverse treacherous paths all day without fatigue. At one hundred and seventy years of age, his teeth remained firm, and his hair showed no trace of white.

One night as he lay abed, he suddenly saw a light within his chamber, as large and bright as a mirror. When he asked those around him, none could perceive it. Over time, the light expanded until the entire room was illuminated as if by daylight. Another night, he saw two maidens of radiant beauty, each two or three *cun* in height, their forms perfectly proportioned save for their diminutive size, frolicking about his mouth and nose. This continued for nearly a year, the maidens gradually growing larger until they stood beside him. He also often heard the strains of zither and lute, and would laugh joyfully to himself. After more than three hundred years among mortals, his appearance remained that of a young boy. He then entered Mount Baodu, where he must have become an earthbound immortal.

Gong Song
Gong Song possessed great literary talent and composed over two hundred scrolls of Daoist texts. By consuming mica, he attained the Way of the earthbound immortal. Later, he entered Mount Zhuyu and departed as a transcendent.

Master Rongcheng
Master Rongcheng practiced the arts of the Plain and Simple Dao, extending his life without limit.

Dong Zhongjun
Dong Zhongjun was a native of Linhuai. Through refining his form with qi, he lived for over two hundred years without aging. Once falsely accused and imprisoned, he feigned death, and soon insects emerged from his body. The jailers carried him out, only for him to vanish without a trace.

Qian Pingji
Qian Pingji was a native of Pei. He entered the mountains in the early Han and attained the Dao. By the time of Emperor Guangwu, he had not aged. Later, he employed the method of simulated death, and after over a hundred years, returned to his hometown.

Wang Zhongdu
Wang Zhongdu was a native of Hanzhong.

Emperor Yuan of Han often exposed him to scorching heat, surrounding him with over ten braziers of fire, yet he did not feel hot nor sweat. In the depths of winter, he ordered Zhongdu to wear only a single layer of clothing, yet his face showed no sign of cold, and steam rose from his body as if from a steamer. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

**Wife of Cheng Wei**
Cheng Wei, a Yellow Gate Gentleman of the Han, was fond of alchemical arts. He married the daughter of a family versed in esoteric methods. Once, when Cheng accompanied the imperial procession without proper attire, he grew deeply anxious. His wife said, “Allow me to procure two bolts of fine silk.” The silk then inexplicably appeared before them. When Cheng failed to produce gold using the *Hongbao* method from his pillow manual, his wife went to observe him. Cheng was fanning the coals to heat a crucible containing mercury. His wife said, “I wish to demonstrate something for you.” She took a small amount of powder from her pouch and cast it in. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she opened it, and it had turned to silver. Cheng was astonished and said, “The Dao resides with you, yet why did you not tell me sooner?” His wife replied, “One must await the decree of fate to obtain it.” Thereafter, Cheng ceaselessly cajoled and enticed her, selling fields and dwellings to provide fine food and clothing, yet she still refused to reveal the method. Cheng then conspired with others to beat and cane her. His wife, foreseeing this, said to Cheng, “The Dao must be transmitted to the right person. Only when one meets the destined individual should it be taught. If the recipient is unworthy—outwardly compliant but inwardly false—then even if you cut me to pieces, the Dao will not emerge.” Cheng persisted in coercing her, whereupon his wife feigned madness, stripped naked, and ran off, smearing herself with mud. She soon died.

**Ji Zixun**
Ji Da, styled Zixun, was a native of Linzi in the state of Qi and a fellow townsman of Li Shaojun.

Ji Zixun

In his youth, he served in the provincial and commandery administrations, was nominated as *Filial and Incorrupt*, and appointed Gentleman of the Palace. Later, he joined the army and was enfeoffed as Commandant of the Imperial Equipage. In his later years, he awakened to the realization that managing worldly affairs and holding office brought no benefit to one’s lifespan. Thus, he became a disciple of Shaojun, studying the art of healing and medical methods. Over time, he witnessed Shaojun’s attainment of the Dao of immortality. Thereupon, he served Shaojun with the reverence due a master. Shaojun, perceiving Zixun’s wholehearted devotion and recognizing his potential for accomplishment, gradually revealed to him the affairs of the Daoist school. He taught him the methods of *embryonic breathing*, *embryonic eating*, and *abiding in years to halt whitening*, which Zixun practiced for over two hundred years without aging in countenance.

In his hometown, he conducted himself with sincerity and deference toward others. By nature, he favored tranquility, often secluding himself to study the *Book of Changes* and occasionally composing short essays, all imbued with profound meaning. In his later years, Shaojun further transmitted to Zixun the *Great Illusionary Arts of Master Wu Changzi*. When applied in practice, these techniques invariably proved effective.

Once, he saw a neighbor carrying a child and asked to hold it, but the child slipped from his grasp and fell to the ground, dying instantly. The family, who had long revered him, dared not display grief and buried the child, saying it was fated not to grow into adulthood. After some days, unable to bear the thought, Zixun went out, retrieved the child, and returned it to the family. The family, fearing it was a ghost, begged him not to bring it back. Zixun said, “Take it, do not worry—this is truly your child.” The child recognized its mother, smiled, and reached for her. They took the child, though still uncertain. After Zixun left, the couple went to the burial site and unearthed the coffin, finding only a clay effigy of the child, about six inches long. The child then grew to maturity.

For those whose hair had turned white with age, Zixun merely sat with them in conversation, and by the next morning, their hair had turned black—without any application of medicine or treatment. The effect could last for one year and two hundred days. Yet there were also those whose hair he did not turn black, for these were the greatest transformations of divine illusion.

When the nobles of the capital heard of this, none failed to yearn for an audience with Zixun, though none could find a means to summon him. Zixun had long resided near a young student of the Imperial Academy. The nobles gathered and said to the student, “The reason you toil in your studies is to pass examinations and attain wealth and rank. If you can bring Jì Zixun to us, we will ensure your success without effort.” The student agreed and returned home to serve Zixun, sweeping and cleaning for him day and night, standing attentively at his side. After nearly two hundred days, Zixun said to the student, “You are not a cultivator of the Dao—how can you endure this?” The student replied, “Though I am but a humble villager, the way of respect between elder and younger naturally demands this.” Zixun said, “Why feign sincerity with empty words? I fully understand your intent. The nobles wish to see me, and why should I begrudge the effort of a single journey to secure your honor and position? Go and tell them I will come on such-and-such a day.” Overjoyed, the student returned to the capital and relayed this to the nobles.

On the appointed day, Zixun had not yet departed. The student’s parents, worried, went to see Zixun, who said, “I fear I may not go, but to prevent your son from breaking his word, I will set out at mealtime from my residence.” The parents said to each other, “Though Jì may not arrive on time, he will surely come. Let us settle on the day after tomorrow.” The student returned and calculated that Zixun would arrive in the capital at midday, which would require traveling over a thousand *li* in half a day. When he arrived, the student went to meet him. Zixun asked, “Who wishes to see me?” The student replied, “Many wish to see you, Master. I dare not trouble you, but if I may know your destination, they will come to you.” Zixun said, “There is no need for them to come. Having traveled over a thousand *li* to visit, would I then confer with them on such matters? Today, have each of them dismiss their guests. I will arrive at midday and choose where to go first.” The student relayed this to the nobles, who each prepared their halls.

At midday, Zixun arrived. In twenty-three places, there appeared twenty-three Zixuns, each visiting one household. The nobles were delighted, each believing Zixun had come to them first. The next day, when they gathered to compare notes, they saw that at the same time, each had hosted a Zixun, identical in attire and appearance, though their discussions varied according to the questions of their hosts. Each household prepared feasts and offered them to Zixun, who accepted the hospitality with full courtesy.

Thereupon, astonishment spread far and wide, and the nobles all wished to visit him. Zixun said to the student, “They believe I must have double pupils and eightfold radiance, which is why they seek me. But I have nothing to teach. I will not go again.” With that, he departed. As he left, the nobles’ carriages and retinues filled the road to his gate. The student said, “The one who just left, riding a blue mule on the eastern path, is he.” They all mounted their horses and pursued him, catching sight of the mule moving slowly ahead. They galloped after it but could not close the distance, always remaining about a *li* behind. After half a day’s chase, they gave up and returned.

As a fellow townsman and disciple of Shaojun, Zixun was discreet, cautious, and diligent in his pursuit of the profound mysteries of the Dao. Adapting to the needs of the time like a master craftsman, he was fully capable of discerning and synthesizing the myriad wonders.

**Scroll Eight: Ge Xuan**

Ge Xuan, styled Xiaoxian, was a native of Danyang. From birth, he was exceptionally intelligent, his nature and understanding keen and bright. He had perused all the classics, histories, philosophers, and masters without exception. At just over ten years of age, having lost both parents, he suddenly sighed and said, “There exists in the world an eternal, deathless Dao—why should I not study it?” Thereupon, he withdrew into the famous mountains, seeking out extraordinary individuals. He ingested lingzhi and atractylis, and followed the immortal Zuo Ci, receiving the *Nine Elixirs* and *Golden Liquid Scripture of Immortality*. Xuan diligently observed the precepts and rituals, and the Lord Lao and the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate descended upon Mount Tiantai, bestowing upon him thirty-six scrolls, including the *Mysterious Scripture of the Numinous Treasure*. After some time, the Most High again sent three perfected ones—Xiang Fu, who bore the *Illuminated Chart*, and two others who rode the eight-jewel jade chariot, their jeweled canopies, banners, and standards resplendent in the sky, accompanied by ten thousand attending immortals. He commanded the Scripture-Attending Immortal Gentleman Wang Sizhen to open the nine-radiance jade casket, producing thirty-six scrolls, including the *Great Cavern of Primordial Purity* and other scriptures, as well as two methods of the *Upper Clarity* retreat: the first, *Seclusion from the Multitude*, a solitary fast for quieting the qi and relinquishing the form, a retreat of profound contemplation; the second, the *Pure Altar and Solemn Assembly*, following the rites of the Great Perfected, first liberating the nine

In his youth, Zuo Ci mastered the Five Classics and was also versed in astrology and cosmology. Witnessing the Han dynasty’s imminent decline and the onset of chaos across the realm, he sighed, “In this decadent age, high office invites peril, and great wealth courts death—worldly glory is not worth coveting.” He then devoted himself to the study of Daoist arts, becoming particularly adept in the Six Jia techniques. He could command ghosts and spirits, conjuring feasts at will. Through deep meditation in the mountains of Tianzhu, he discovered the *Scripture of Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquor* within a stone chamber. With this, he could perform myriad transformations beyond count.

When Cao Cao heard of him, he summoned Zuo Ci and confined him in a chamber under guard, cutting off his grain and providing only two *sheng* of water daily. After a full year, Cao Cao had him released, yet his complexion remained unchanged. Cao Cao remarked, “I thought there was no man in the world who could live without food.” He then sought to learn the Dao from Zuo Ci, who replied, “The Dao requires purity and non-action—it is not fitting for one of your exalted station.” Enraged, Cao Cao plotted to kill him. Sensing this, Zuo Ci requested to resign his post. Cao Cao asked, “Why this sudden departure?” Zuo Ci answered, “You intend to kill me, so I seek to leave.” Cao Cao denied it, saying, “If you wish to pursue lofty aspirations, you need not stay long.” He then prepared a farewell feast.

Zuo Ci said, “As I am about to travel far, I humbly request to share a cup of wine with you.” Cao Cao agreed. It was a cold day, and the wine had not yet warmed. Zuo Ci drew his sword and stirred the wine, and in an instant, the blade dissolved entirely, as if grinding ink. Initially, Cao Cao assumed Zuo Ci would let him drink first, leaving the remainder for himself. Instead, Zuo Ci plucked a hairpin and traced the wine in the cup, dividing it cleanly into two. He drank half and offered the other half to Cao Cao. Displeased, Cao Cao did not drink immediately. Zuo Ci asked to drink it himself, and after finishing, he tossed the cup onto the roof beam. The cup hung there, swaying as if a bird dipping and rising, poised to fall yet never falling. The entire assembly fixed their gaze upon it. Then, in an instant, Zuo Ci vanished. When they searched for him, he had already returned to his dwelling.

Cao Cao grew even more determined to kill him. He ordered his men to capture Zuo Ci, who fled into a flock of sheep. The pursuers saw him enter the herd but suddenly lost sight of him, suspecting he had transformed into a sheep—yet they could not distinguish which one. The officers addressed the sheep, saying, “His Lordship wishes to see you. Return briefly; you will come to no harm.” Then, one large sheep among the flock knelt and spoke. The officers exclaimed, “This kneeling sheep is Zuo Ci!” As they moved to seize it, all the sheep, large and small, knelt as well. The pursuers could no longer tell where Zuo Ci was and abandoned the chase.

Later, someone who knew Zuo Ci’s whereabouts informed Cao Cao, who sent officers to arrest him. They captured him, though Zuo Ci could have easily concealed himself—he wished to let others witness his divine transformations. Brought into prison, the jailers prepared to interrogate him. Suddenly, there was one Zuo Ci inside the cell and another outside, leaving them unsure which was real. When Cao Cao heard this, his hatred deepened, and he ordered Zuo Ci taken to the market for execution. In an instant, seven identical Zuo Cis appeared. The officers seized six, but one escaped. Soon after, the six captives vanished as well. Then Zuo Ci was seen fleeing into the market. Cao Cao ordered the four gates closed and a search conducted. Some, unfamiliar with Zuo Ci’s appearance, asked what he looked like. They were told he had one blind eye, wore a green hemp headscarf, and a simple robe—anyone matching this description was to be seized. As a result, everyone in the market suddenly had one blind eye, a hemp headscarf, and a simple robe. Unable to distinguish him, they gave up.

Cao Cao commanded his forces everywhere to pursue and kill Zuo Ci on sight. Later, someone beheaded a man resembling him and presented the head to Cao Cao, who rejoiced—until he saw it was merely a bundle of thatch. A traveler from Jingzhou reported seeing Zuo Ci there. Liu Biao, the governor of Jingzhou, deemed him a heretic and sought to execute him. Zuo Ci, already aware of this, left as Liu Biao was reviewing his troops. He approached Liu Biao and said, “I have a modest gift I wish to offer your army.” Liu Biao replied, “You are but a solitary Daoist—my army is vast. Such a gift is not for you to bestow.” Zuo Ci insisted, and Liu Biao sent men to retrieve it. There was a single vessel of wine and a bundle of dried meat, yet more than ten men could not lift them. Zuo Ci took them himself, sliced the meat with a knife, and scattered the pieces on the ground. He then invited a hundred men to distribute the wine and meat to the soldiers. Each received three cups of wine and one slice of meat, tasting no different from ordinary fare. Over ten thousand men were fully sated, yet the vessel remained full, and the meat undiminished. Dozens of guests at the feast also became thoroughly drunk. Liu Biao was astonished and abandoned his intent to harm Zuo Ci.

After several days, Zuo Ci left Liu Biao and headed east into Wu. There lived a man named Xu Sui, also skilled in Daoist arts, who resided in Dantu. Zuo Ci passed by his gate, where six or seven guest carriages were parked. The guests lied, saying, “Master Xu is not at home.” Zuo Ci departed at once. The overnight guests saw their oxen walking along the treetops of willows—when they ascended, the oxen vanished; when they descended, the oxen reappeared. The carriage hubs were filled with brambles a foot long, impossible to cut or shake loose. Terrified, the guests rushed inside to report to Xu Sui: “An old man with one blind eye came to the gate. We deceived him, saying you were not home. After he left, the carriages and oxen became like this. What does it mean?” Xu Sui exclaimed, “Ah! This is Zuo Ci mocking me. How could you deceive him? Hurry and pursue him!” The guests scattered to search, and upon finding Zuo Ci, they surrounded him, kowtowed, and apologized. Zuo Ci’s anger dissipated, and he let them return.

Upon their return, they found the carriages and oxen restored to their original state, tethered as before, with no trace of brambles in the hubs.

Zuo Ci later met Sun Quan, the founding lord of Wu. Quan had long known of Ci’s mastery of the Dao and treated him with great reverence. Quan’s attendants, Xie Song and Zhi, aware that Cao Cao and Liu Biao both resented Ci for deluding the masses, slandered him to Quan, urging his execution. Later, when Quan went out on an excursion, he invited Ci to accompany him, instructing Ci to walk ahead of his horse—intending to stab him from behind. Ci wore wooden clogs and carried a green bamboo staff, strolling unhurriedly a hundred paces ahead. Quan whipped his horse and pursued with weapons drawn, yet could never close the distance. Realizing Ci’s mastery of the Dao, he abandoned the attempt.

Ci told Master Ge Xian, “I shall enter Mount Huo to refine the Ninefold Elixir.” Once the elixir was complete, he ascended as an immortal.

Wang Yao
Wang Yao, styled Boliao, was a native of Poyang. Though married, he had no children. He was highly skilled in healing, curing all ailments without fail. He performed no sacrifices, used no talismanic water, needles, or medicines. When treating illness, he would simply spread an eight-foot cloth upon the ground, sit upon it, and neither eat nor drink. After a short while, the patient would recover and depart. If malevolent spirits caused harm, Yao would draw a prison on the ground, summon them, and their forms—whether fox, turtle, snake, or other—would appear within. He would then slay and burn them, and the afflicted would instantly recover.

Yao possessed a bamboo box, several inches long. His disciple, surnamed Qian, had followed him for decades yet never saw him open it. One stormy night, with heavy rain and darkness, Yao instructed Qian to carry the box on a nine-jointed staff. They set out through the downpour, yet neither Yao’s nor his disciple’s robes were damp. Two torches lit their path ahead as they walked some thirty li, ascending a small mountain to enter a stone chamber. Inside, two others were already present. Yao took the box from his disciple, opened it, and removed three five-tongued bamboo flutes. He played one himself and gave the other two to the men in the chamber, who joined him in playing. After a long while, Yao took his leave. The three flutes were returned to the box, which Qian carried once more. The two men saw them off, saying to Yao, “You should have come sooner. Why linger so long among the mundane?” Yao replied, “I shall come when the time is right.”

A hundred days later, another rainstorm came. That night, Yao suddenly prepared his belongings. He had a hempen robe and a hempen cloth headwrap, which he had not worn in over fifty years, yet that night he put them on. His wife asked, “Are you leaving me?” Yao said, “Only for a time.” She asked, “Will you take Qian with you?” He replied, “I go alone.” She wept, and he shouldered the box and departed, never to return. Over thirty years later, his disciple saw Yao on Mount Mati, his complexion youthful—he had become an earthbound immortal.

Chen Yongbo
Chen Yongbo was a native of Nanyang.

Having obtained the Huainan King’s *Seven-Li Powder* formula, he tested and compounded it, then took the medicine. After twenty-one days, he suddenly vanished without a trace. Yongbo had a nephew named Zengzu, aged seventeen, who also took the powder. His father bound his feet and confined him in a sealed chamber, stationing guards to watch him day and night. Yet after twenty-eight days, he too disappeared, gone without a trace. The original formula states: *"Take it for thirty days and attain immortality."* Though the two Chen youths had not yet completed thirty days of ingestion, they vanished nonetheless. Later generations dared not take the medicine, for when immortals depart, celestial officials must come to receive them—only mortals fail to see them.

The Old Man of Mount Tai
The Old Man of Mount Tai’s name is unknown. During Emperor Wu of Han’s eastern inspection tour, he saw an old man hoeing by the roadside, a white radiance rising several feet above his head. Intrigued, the emperor summoned and questioned him. The old man appeared to be about fifty, yet his face bore the complexion of a child, his skin and body luminous, unlike that of ordinary men. The emperor asked, *"What arts of the Dao do you possess?"* The old man replied, *"When your servant was eighty-five, I was decrepit and near death, my hair white and teeth fallen. A Daoist taught me to abstain from grains, consume *shu* (Atractylodes), and drink water, while also crafting a spirit pillow. The pillow contained thirty-two ingredients: twenty-four to correspond to the twenty-four qi, and eight to align with the eight winds. After practicing this, I transformed from old to young, my black hair regrew, and my teeth, once fallen, returned. Now I can walk three hundred li in a day. Your servant is now one hundred eighty years old."*

Emperor Wu cherished the formula and bestowed upon him gold and silks. Later, the old man entered the depths of Mount Tai and departed; every ten or five years, he would return to his hometown, but after more than three hundred years, he never came back again.

**Wu Yan**
Wu Yan, styled Zidu, was a native of Beihai. Emperor Wu of Han encountered Zidu at the Wei Bridge, where a dense purple qi, over a *zhang* in height, rose above his head. The emperor summoned him and asked, *"How old are you? What arts have you attained to possess such an extraordinary qi?"* Zidu replied, *"Your servant is now one hundred thirty-eight years old, yet I have gained nothing in particular."* As he prepared to leave, the emperor summoned Dongfang Shuo to assess what Daoist arts this gentleman possessed. Shuo replied, *"This gentleman possesses yin arts."* Emperor Wu dismissed his attendants and questioned him further. Zidu answered, *"When your servant was sixty-five, I suffered from pain in the waist and spine, cold feet that could not warm themselves, a dry and bitter mouth, a parched tongue, and constant nasal discharge. Every joint and limb ached, and my feet were weak, unable to stand for long. Since obtaining this Way, seventy-three years have passed. I have thirty-six sons, my body remains robust and free from illness, my strength is as it was in my prime, and I have no cares or afflictions."* The emperor said, *"You are unkind. Possessing the Dao yet not sharing it with me—this is not the conduct of a loyal subject."* Zidu kowtowed and said, *"Your servant truly knows this Way to be authentic, yet matters of yin and yang are private affairs within the public sphere, difficult for a subject to speak of. Moreover, practicing it runs counter to human nature, and few can endure it—thus, I dared not make it known."* The emperor said, *"Do not apologize; I was merely testing you."* Thereupon, he received his method.

Zidu lived to over two hundred years of age, ingesting and refining mercury, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Later, Emperor Wu practiced his method but could not fully adhere to it; nevertheless, he attained a lifespan far surpassing that of other emperors.

**He Shanggong**

He Shanggong—his true name is unknown. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, he wove grass into a hut by the riverside, where he constantly recited the *Dao De Jing* of Laozi.

At the time, Emperor Wen favored Laozi’s Dao, and he issued an edict commanding all princes, dukes, ministers, provincial governors, and court officials to recite it. Those who could not master the *Laozi* were barred from ascending the court.

When the emperor encountered doubts in the text, none could resolve them. The attendant Censor Pei Kai reported: *"In Hexi of Shanzhou, there is a man who recites the *Laozi*."* The emperor immediately dispatched an envoy bearing his questions to inquire of him. The Master said: *"The Dao is revered, and virtue is noble—such matters cannot be questioned from afar."*

The emperor then personally journeyed to him in admiration. The Master remained in his hut and did not emerge. The emperor sent a messenger to say: *"Under the vast heavens, all is the king’s land; within the bounds of the earth, all are the king’s subjects. Among the four great powers of the realm, the king holds one. Though you possess the Dao, you are still my subject. Why do you not humble yourself? Why do you exalt yourself so? I can make my people rich or poor, noble or base."*

Moments later, the Master clapped his hands and leapt into the air, rising gently into the void until he hovered over a hundred feet above the ground. After a long while, he bowed slightly and replied: *"I ascend not to heaven, burden not men, nor dwell upon the earth—what subject am I to you? Can you, my lord, make me rich or poor, noble or base?"*

The emperor was greatly astonished, realizing he was a divine being. He alighted from his carriage, prostrated himself, and bowed in reverence, saying: *"I, unworthy as I am, have inherited the legacy of my ancestors. My talent is small, yet my burden is great, and I fear I am unequal to it. My aspiration is to serve the Dao and virtue, but my understanding is dim, and much remains obscure. I only hope that the Daoist Master will take pity and instruct me."*

He Shanggong then presented two scrolls of plain silk inscribed with the *Laozi Dao De Jing* in chapter and verse, saying to the emperor: *"Study this thoroughly, and your doubts will resolve themselves. Since I composed this text, over seventeen hundred years have passed. I have transmitted it to only three people—with you, four. Do not show it to the unworthy!"*

The emperor knelt and received the scrolls. When he finished speaking, the Master vanished. The emperor then had a terrace built on the western mountain to gaze after him, but he was seen no more. Commentators believed that though Emperor Wen was devoted to the Great Dao, his heart was not yet purely faithful. Thus, the Master displayed divine transformations to awaken him, intending to perfect his understanding. Hence, people called him He Shanggong.

**Liu Gen**

Liu Gen, styled Jun’an, was a native of Chang’an. In his youth, he mastered the Five Classics. In the second year of Emperor Cheng of Han’s *Suihe* reign, he was recommended as a filial and incorruptible scholar and appointed Gentleman of the Palace. Later, he abandoned worldly affairs and retreated into a stone chamber in the towering peaks of Mount Songgao, where cliffs soared five thousand *zhang* high. He entered from the northern face of the precipice.

Winter and summer, he wore no clothes, his body covered in hair one or two feet long. His complexion remained that of a youth of fourteen or fifteen, with deep-set eyes, a thick beard, and golden sideburns three or four inches long. When seated with others, he would sometimes suddenly transform, donning a tall hat and dark robes, yet no one noticed the change.

At the time, Lord Heng of Yingchuan claimed that his ancestor had been the same age as Gen. Wang Mang repeatedly sent envoys to summon Gen, but he refused to go. When Wang Zhen, the Temple Attendant of Lord Heng’s ancestral shrine, inquired after his well-being, Gen did not respond. Lord Heng then sent the Merit Officer Zhao Gong to the mountain to convey his respects, but Gen only expressed gratitude to Lord Heng, saying nothing more.

Later, when Lord Gao, the Prefect of Yingchuan, assumed office, a great plague struck the people, and over half the populace perished. The prefect’s entire household fell ill. Lord Gao sent Zhen to seek from Gen a method to dispel disaster and eradicate the plague. Zhen kowtowed and relayed the prefect’s request. Gen instructed him to dig a hole three feet deep at the site of the *Tai Sui* palace’s *qi*, fill it with sand, and pour wine over it.

The prefect followed his instructions, and the afflicted recovered immediately; the plague was entirely extinguished. Thereafter, the method was frequently employed with success.

Later, the prefectural clerk Shi Qi regarded Gen as a heretic and sought to execute him. He dispatched an envoy to summon Gen, but the entire commandery remonstrated, insisting it was impermissible. Qi was utterly unmoved. The officials first sent word to Gen of the prefect’s intent. When the envoy arrived, Gen said: *"What does the prefect wish of me? I shall go. If I do not, I fear you all will be punished for failing to summon me."*

Gen then proceeded to the commandery. The hall was filled with guests. Qi ordered Gen to approach and had over fifty men stand behind him with ropes, whips, and cudgels. Qi demanded in a stern voice: *"Do you possess the Dao?"*

Gen replied: *"I do."*

Qi said: *"If you possess the Dao, can you summon a ghost for me to see? If you cannot, I will execute you."*

Gen said: *"It is very easy."* He then borrowed Qi’s brush and inkstone, wrote a talisman, and struck the steps with it, producing a resonant sound like bronze. He let out a long whistle, its clarity extraordinary, audible even beyond the city walls. All who heard it were filled with awe. The assembled guests were terrified.

Moments later, the southern wall of the hall suddenly split open several *zhang* wide. Four crimson-clad officials appeared, calling for the way to be cleared. Dozens of crimson-clad soldiers wielding swords escorted a black carriage, which emerged from the broken wall and halted before the hall. Gen commanded the ghost to descend from the carriage. The crimson-clad soldiers removed the black cover, revealing an old man and an old woman bound and shackled with thick ropes.

Upon close inspection, they were Qi’s deceased parents. Qi was stunned and wept bitterly. His parents also wept, reproaching him: *"In our lifetime, your official career was not yet established, and we did not receive your support. After our death, why have you offended the revered immortals, causing us to be seized and humiliated in this way?"*

Qi prostrated himself upon the steps, kowtowing to Gen and pleading for the release of his forebears. Gen then commanded the crimson-clad soldiers to take the prisoners away. The southern wall of the hall parted once more, and as the carriage passed through, it vanished without a trace, and Gen, too, disappeared. Qi stood dazed, as if maddened. Suddenly, his wife collapsed and died, reviving only after a long while. She said, *"I saw your family’s recently seized kin. They were furious, saying, ‘Why did you offend the great immortal, bringing punishment upon us? We have long suspected you.’"*

A month later, Qi, his wife, and their children all perished.

Wang Zhen, an attendant of the Shaoshi Temple, had several times witnessed Gen’s joyful countenance. Prostrating himself, he kowtowed and begged to know how Gen first attained the Dao. Gen replied, *"Long ago, I wandered the mountains in search of enlightenment, traversing every place. Later, I entered Mount Huayin, where I saw a man riding a white deer, followed by over a thousand attendants. Jade maidens flanked him, and four youths, each fifteen or sixteen years of age, bore ceremonial banners. I bowed twice and knocked my head to the ground, entreating a single word of instruction. The divine being halted and said to me, ‘Have you heard of Han Zhong of old?’ I answered, ‘I have indeed heard of him.’ The divine being said, ‘I am he.’"*

"'I then recounted how from my youth I had cherished the Dao of long life and deathlessness, yet never encountered a true master. I had studied many esoteric texts and followed their methods, but most proved ineffective. Could it be that my fate and destiny were unsuited for transcendence? Today, by great fortune, I have met a divine being—this is the very dream I have harbored night and day, the deepest wish of my heart. I beg you to take pity and bestow upon me the essential teachings.'

The divine being was at first unwilling to instruct me, but I wept and prostrated myself, entreating again and again. Finally, he said, *'Sit. I shall tell you. You possess the bones of an immortal, which is why you have been able to see me. Yet now your marrow is not full, your blood not warm, your qi scant, your brain diminished, your sinews tense, and your flesh withered. Thus, when you take medicines or practice qi-cultivation, you fail to follow the correct method. If you truly desire long life, you must first treat your ailments for twelve years before you may ingest the supreme medicines of immortality.

The Dao of immortality has many forms: some ascend to heaven riding clouds, some wander the Five Peaks, some eat grains yet never die, and some attain immortality through corpse-liberation. The key lies in ingesting elixirs, and since elixirs vary in grade, immortals likewise have many ranks. The highest elixirs are only the Nine-Turned Cyclically Transformed Cinnabar and the Great Unity’s Golden Liquid. Those who consume them ascend to heaven instantly, without the passage of days or months. Next are mica and realgar, which enable one to ride clouds and mount dragons, command ghosts and spirits, transform the body, and attain long life. As for herbal medicines, they can only cure illnesses, replenish deficiency, prolong youth, reverse graying, cease grain-eating, and augment qi. They cannot make one deathless—at best, they may extend life for several hundred years, or at least preserve one’s allotted lifespan, though they are not truly reliable for long-term transcendence.'*

I then kowtowed and said, *'Today I receive your teaching—this is the will of Heaven!'* The divine being replied, *'If you truly desire long life, first expel the Three Corpses. Once the Three Corpses are gone, your will becomes steadfast, and desires vanish.'* He then bestowed upon me five sacred formulas, saying:

*'The Crouching Corpses always ascend to heaven on the full moon, the last day of the month, and the first day of the new moon to report a person’s transgressions. The Deities of Fate then reduce one’s allotted lifespan, shortening one’s years. The spirits within the human body desire life, but the Three Corpses desire death. When a person dies, the spirits scatter and return to formlessness, while the Three Corpses become ghosts, delighting in the offerings and sacrifices made to the deceased. Thus, their interest lies in hastening human death. When you dream of fighting with evil men, it is in truth your spirit battling the Corpses.'*

Thereafter, I followed the instructions step by step, refined and ingested the elixirs, and thus attained immortality."

Wang Zhen further recounted: *"Several times, I saw him cast talismans upon the ground, and when he made a summons, it was as if someone took them, though no one was visible. I also heard him ask questions, and someone answer, yet no form was seen. At times, I heard the sound of whips and staffs, and sometimes saw blood on the ground. The mysteries of these occurrences were unfathomable."*

"Did he teach you the methods of *guarding the One*, *conducting qi*, *preserving the spirit*, and the Master’s *Three Principles and Six Disciplines* for repenting transgressions from antiquity—could you thereby attain a name among the immortals?"

Later, Gen ascended into Mount Jitou as a transcendent and departed.

**Scroll Nine: Master Hu**

Master Hu—his true name is unknown. The present age’s *Talismans for Summoning Armies*, *Talismans for Summoning Ghosts and Spirits to Treat Illnesses in the Royal Palace*, and over twenty other scrolls all originate from Master Hu, hence they are sometimes called the *Talismans of Master Hu*.

When Fei Changfang of Runan served as a market clerk, he suddenly saw the Master arrive from afar, entering the market to sell medicine, yet no one recognized him. His medicines were sold at a fixed price, curing all ailments. He would tell the buyer, "After taking this, you will vomit such-and-such an object, and on such-and-such a day, you will recover." All unfolded as he said. Though he earned tens of thousands of coins daily, he would distribute them to the poor, hungry, and freezing in the market, keeping little for himself. He always hung an empty gourd above his seat; after sunset, he would turn his feet and leap into it, and no one knew where he went. Only Changfang, observing from an upper floor, saw this and knew he was no ordinary man.

Thereafter, Changfang daily swept the ground before the Master’s seat and provided offerings, which the Master accepted without thanks. This continued for a long time. Changfang never slackened nor dared make any request. The Master, knowing Changfang’s sincere faith, said to him, "Come again at dusk when no one is about." Changfang followed his words and went. The Master said, "When you see me leap into the gourd, follow me and leap—you will surely enter." Changfang trusted the Master’s words and tried; stretching out his foot, he found himself inside without realizing it. Once inside, he no longer saw the gourd but instead beheld multicolored towers and pavilions, layered gates, and winding corridors. He saw dozens of attendants standing beside the Master. The Master said to Changfang, "I am an immortal, holding an office in the celestial bureaucracy. For my negligence in duties, I was temporarily exiled to the human realm. You are teachable, so I allowed you to see me."

Changfang did not sit but knelt, kowtowing, and confessed, "This fleshly being is ignorant, burdened by kalpas of karma. I am fortunate to have been mistakenly shown compassion, like reviving the withered and rotting with a breath after opening a coffin. Yet I see only my own foulness, obstinacy, and unworthiness—unfit for service. If you deign to pity me, it would be the greatest fortune of a hundred lifetimes." The Master said, "This is most excellent. Tell no one."

Later, the Master visited Changfang in his upper chamber and said, "I have a little wine; let us drink together. It is downstairs." Changfang sent servants to fetch it, but they could not lift it. Even with dozens more, none could bring it up. Changfang informed the Master, who then descended himself, lifting it with a single finger and sharing it with Changfang. The vessel was no larger than a clamshell, yet the wine lasted until dawn without running out.

The Master told Changfang, "On such-and-such a day, I will depart. Will you go with me?" Changfang replied, "My desire to go cannot be expressed. I only wish my family would not notice or know. What can be done?" The Master said, "It is easy." He took a green bamboo staff and gave it to Changfang, instructing, "Take this home, feign illness, and on the appointed day, place this staff where you lie. Then come silently." Changfang followed the Master’s words. His family, seeing the bamboo, believed he had died and wept as they prepared his funeral. Changfang followed the Master away, unaware of where they went. The Master left him alone among a pack of tigers, their fangs bared and mouths agape, ready to devour him—but Changfang felt no fear. The next day, the Master placed Changfang in a stone chamber, where a boulder several *zhang* wide hung above his head by a rope of straw. Serpents gnawed at the rope, seeking to sever it, yet Changfang remained unperturbed.

The Master came to examine him and said, "You are teachable." He then ordered Changfang to eat excrement, which was extraordinarily foul, filled with worms over an inch long. Changfang’s expression betrayed his revulsion. The Master sighed, apologized, and dismissed him, saying, "You cannot attain immortality. Now I will make you a local earth deity, granting you a lifespan of several hundred years." He transmitted a scroll of talismans to Changfang, saying, "Carry this to command all ghosts and spirits. Call yourself a messenger to treat illnesses and dispel misfortune."

Changfang worried he could not return home. The Master gave him the bamboo staff, saying, "Simply ride this home." Changfang took his leave. Mounting the staff, he suddenly felt as if asleep—when he awoke, he was already home. His family thought him a ghost and recounted the earlier events. Only when they opened the coffin and found only the bamboo staff did they believe him. Changfang cast the staff he had ridden into Ge Marsh, and upon inspection, it was a green dragon.

Changfang believed he had been gone a single day, but upon reckoning, a year had passed. Thereafter, he used the talismans to subdue ghosts and cure illnesses, with none failing to recover. Whenever he sat and spoke with others, he would suddenly glare and rebuke them. When asked why, he said, "I am scolding ghosts and demons for breaking the law."

In Runan Commandery, there were often ghostly disturbances, appearing several times a year. When they came, they paraded with pomp and ceremony, like a prefect entering his office, beating drums as they circled the inner and outer precincts before departing. This was a great nuisance. Later, when Changfang visited the prefect, the ghost arrived just as he reached the prefectural gate. The prefect rushed inside, leaving Changfang alone. The ghost, sensing his presence, dared not approach and tried to leave. Changfang shouted sternly, commanding it to be seized and brought forward. The ghost dismounted, holding its tablet, prostrating in the courtyard, and kowtowing, begging to reform.

Changfang rebuked it: "You old dead ghost, heedless of warmth or chill, recklessly parading and intruding upon the official residence—do you know you deserve death?" He swiftly ordered it to resume human form, gave it a talisman, and commanded, "Take this to the Lord of Ge Marsh." The ghost kowtowed, tears streaming, and departed with the talisman.

The envoy was sent to pursue and observe it, and the ghost stood by the marsh’s edge, wrapping the talisman around its neck before dying.

The Lord of the Eastern Sea later suffered drought. When Changfang arrived at the Eastern Sea, he saw its people praying for rain and said to them, “The Lord of the Eastern Sea has committed an offense and was previously bound at Ge Marsh. Now he shall be pardoned.” He commanded that rain be made, and at once a great downpour fell.

Once, while traveling with others, Changfang saw a scholar—a youth in a yellow turban and fur robe, riding a horse without a saddle. The youth dismounted and kowtowed. Changfang said, “Return the horse at once, and your crime will be forgiven.” When asked about it, Changfang replied, “This is but a fox spirit, who stole the She Lord’s horse.”

Another time, while seated with guests, he sent someone to the market to buy pickled fish, and the person returned in an instant. On some days, he was seen in several places a thousand *li* apart.

Yin Gui
Yin Gui, styled Gongdu, was a native of Taiyuan. Well-versed in the Five Classics, he was especially profound in astronomy, the principles of *qi*, and the prophecies of the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*, mastering all their subtleties. In his later years, he embraced the Dao, regularly consuming yellow essence—three *ge* a day. Though he lived for centuries, his complexion remained youthful and fair.

He often spoke of his distant ancestor, Yin Xi, who during the reigns of King Kang and King Zhao of Zhou had dwelled in a thatched tower. There, he encountered the Old Master, who expounded the scriptures to him. Later, King Mu of Zhou renovated the tower to await men of the Dao, and Gongdu thus took residence there, claiming, “Xi has appeared to me many times, imparting the essentials of the Dao.” Through this, he gained the ability to vanish while seated or standing and perform transformations.

The ancestors of Su of Bingzhou had long served him, and for generations, their descendants beheld him, his appearance ever that of a man of fifty. He wandered among mortals, sometimes entering the mountains, reappearing after a year or half a year. He had no wife or children.

His predictions of the world’s rise and fall, order and chaos, safety and peril, fortune and misfortune were never without fulfillment.

In the twelfth month of the first year of Yongkang in the Jin dynasty, he sought lodging at a household west of Luoyang city. The host, engaged in the La festival, was unwilling to accommodate him. After some time, Gongdu revealed his name, and the host then opened the door to welcome him, setting out wine and food as before. He also gave several *hu* of grain to Gongdu’s blue mule. Yet Gongdu neither drank nor ate, nor did the mule consume the grain. The next morning, he departed, saying to the host, “You are a man who does not respond urgently in times of peril. Though you initially refused me lodging, you later showed kindness to me and my mule. Though I did not partake of what you offered, my intent was to repay your thoughtfulness. Now I bestow upon you a divine elixir. Carry it on your person, and next year, when the land is strewn with the dead from war, this medicine will preserve your life.” The following year, chaos indeed erupted in Luoyang with the rebellion of Zhao Wang Lun, and the dead numbered in the thousands. Every household with a member conscripted into the army lost them, and those who remained at home were all slain by bandits—only the one who possessed the elixir survived.

Gongdu carried dozens of lacquered bamboo tubes at his waist, each filled with medicine that could revive the dead with a single taste. During a great plague across the land, those who obtained a date-sized portion of the elixir and applied it to their door found their entire household spared from illness, and the sick recovered instantly. His disciple Huang Li lived in the mountains of Luhun, where tigers wrought havoc. Gongdu instructed him to fell large trees and fashion them into pillars, burying one a *li* from his home in each of the four directions. Gongdu then stamped them with his seal, and the tigers vanished without a trace. Later, a strange bird alighted upon Huang Li’s roof. When he informed Gongdu, the latter inscribed a talisman and placed it where the bird had cried. By evening, the bird lay dead beneath the talisman, and the omen ceased.

A man had recently suffered a great bereavement, and within the year, his family fell into destitution. Gongdu, seeing this, sighed in pity. The grieving son recounted his hardships, and Gongdu, moved, said, “Can you obtain several *jin* of lead?” The son replied, “I can.” He then procured dozens of *jin* of lead, and Gongdu took it to a small hut in the mountains. There, he melted the lead in a furnace and cast a date-sized divine elixir into the boiling metal. Stirring it, the lead transformed entirely into silver. He gave it to the man, saying, “I pity your poverty and inability to sustain your livelihood, so I give this to you. Guard this secret well.”

Another man, a scion of a scholarly family, had been entangled in official records due to unclear accounts and was ordered to repay a hundred thousand in government funds. He sold his fields, residence, carts, and oxen, but no buyers came, and he was seized and imprisoned. Gongdu spoke to a wealthy acquaintance, saying, “Lend me a hundred thousand coins for a time. I wish to rescue him, and I will repay you in full within twenty days.” The rich man gave the money to Gongdu, who passed it to the beleaguered man and instructed him, “Bring me a hundred *liang* of tin.” The man promptly purchased the tin and presented it to Gongdu. In the furnace, Gongdu melted the tin and cast a square-inch measure of divine elixir into the molten metal, transmuting it into gold. The gold was then weighed and sold, yielding a hundred thousand coins, which were returned to the lender.

Later, Gongdu ascended as an immortal to Taihe Mountain in Nanyang.

**Jie Xiang**

Jie Xiang, styled Yuanze, was a native of Kuaiji. Well-versed in the Five Classics and widely read in the works of the Hundred Schools, he was also skilled in composition. Secretly cultivating the Daoist arts, he entered Mount Tai to receive the techniques of *qi*-restraint. He could kindle fire atop reeds to boil a chicken, leaving the reeds unscorched. He could ensure that within a *li*, no cooking or steaming took place, and for three days, neither chickens crowed nor dogs barked. He could cause an entire marketplace to sit immobile, unable to rise. He could conceal his form and transform into grasses, trees, birds, or beasts.

Having heard of the *Scripture of the Nine Elixirs*, he traveled thousands of *li* in search of it. Failing to find a true master, he entered the mountains to refine his spirit, hoping to encounter immortals. Exhausted, he lay down upon a rock, and a tiger approached to lick him. Awakening, he addressed the beast: “If Heaven has sent you to attend and guard me, remain. If the mountain spirit has sent you to test me, depart swiftly.” The tiger then left.

Xiang entered the mountains and saw in a valley countless stone pebbles, purple-hued and radiant, each the size of a chicken’s egg. He took two and wandered, but the valley was too deep to cross, so he returned. In the mountains, he encountered a beautiful maiden of fifteen or sixteen, her countenance extraordinary, clad in five-colored garments—clearly an immortal. Xiang bowed and begged for the method of longevity. The maiden said, “Hasten to return what you hold to its original place, then come back. I will wait for you here.” Xiang immediately returned the stones to the valley and came back, finding the maiden in the same spot. He bowed again, and she said, “Your *qi* from consuming mutton is not yet exhausted. Abstain from grains for three years, then return. I will remain here.” Xiang returned home, fasted from grains for three years, and went back to see her. The maiden was still in the same place and imparted to him a day’s instruction in the elixir formula, saying, “Attain this, and you will become an immortal. Do not pursue anything else.”

Before Xiang could compound the elixir, his disciple Luo Yanya prepared the ingredients. Only the lower level of the bed remained, where several scholars were engaged in a debate over classical texts, their arguments unresolved. Xiang, overhearing, could not restrain himself and intervened to resolve their dispute. The scholars, recognizing Xiang as no ordinary man, secretly memorialized him to their lord. Xiang, sensing this, wished to depart, saying, “I fear official matters will constrain me.” Yanya firmly urged him to stay.

The King of Wu summoned Xiang to Wuchang, treating him with great reverence and addressing him as “Lord Jie.” He built a residence for Xiang, furnished it with imperial curtains, and bestowed gifts totaling thousands of gold. The king learned the art of concealment from Xiang and tested it by entering the rear palace and passing through palace gates unseen. He also commanded Xiang to perform transformations, and Xiang made melons, vegetables, and a hundred fruits sprout instantly. When the king and his predecessor debated which fish made the finest *kuai*, Xiang declared, “The mullet is supreme.”

The former lord said, “This fish dwells in the sea—how can it be obtained?” Xiang replied, “It can be obtained.” He had attendants fill a square pit in the palace courtyard with water. Xiang then fetched a fishing rod and bait, cast the line into the pit, and in less than the time it takes to eat a meal, he caught a mullet. The former lord marveled with delight and asked, “Is it edible?” Xiang said, “I obtained it precisely to prepare *kuai* for Your Majesty—how could it not be edible?” He then ordered the royal chefs to slice it.

The former lord asked, “The envoys from Shu have not arrived, and we lack the ginger used to make the finest *kuai*—the ginger here is not as good. How can we obtain it?” Xiang replied, “It is easily done. Send someone with five thousand coins, and I will write a talisman and place it inside a bamboo staff. Have the person close their eyes, mount the staff, and when the staff stops, buy ginger. After purchasing it, close their eyes again.” The man followed these instructions, mounted the staff, and in an instant arrived in Chengdu, unaware of where he was. When he asked, he was told it was Shu. He bought the ginger. At that time, Wu’s envoy Zhang Wen was in Shu, and his attendants happened to meet the man buying ginger. Astonished, they wrote a letter to send home. The man returned with the ginger to the kitchen, and the *kuai* was prepared.

Xiang could also read all talismanic scripts as if reading a book, without error. Some doubted this, so they took various talismans, removed their labels, and showed them to Xiang. He identified each one without fail.

There was a man who planted millet in the mountains and suffered from macaques eating it. Hearing of Xiang’s mastery of the Dao, he sought a method to repel them. Xiang instructed, “There is nothing to it. Tomorrow, go to your millet field. When you see the macaques descend, shout loudly, ‘I have already informed Lord Jie, and he has ordered you not to eat the millet.’” The man hastily dismissed this as deception. The next day, he went and saw the macaques about to descend from the trees. He tried Xiang’s words, and the macaques immediately retreated into the trees, vanishing without a trace.

Xiang repeatedly requested to leave Wu, but the former lord refused. Xiang said he would fall ill on a certain day. The former lord sent attendants to bestow a box of pears upon him. Xiang ate them and died moments later. The former lord had him buried. Though he died at midday, by dusk his body had already arrived in Jianye. The pears he was given were planted in the palace gardens. Later, an official reported this to the former lord, who opened the coffin to find only a memorial tablet and a talisman inside. Grieving for Xiang, the former lord had his residence converted into a temple and frequently visited to offer sacrifices. A white crane would often alight upon his seat, lingering for a long while before departing.

Later, Xiang’s disciples saw him on Hezhu Mountain, his complexion appearing even younger. **Scroll Ten: Dong Feng**

Dong Feng, styled Junyi, was a native of Houguan County. During the reign of the former lord of Wu, a young man served as magistrate of the county. Seeing Junyi at over thirty years of age, he did not know he possessed the Way. More than fifty years later, the magistrate retired and later took another post. Passing through Houguan, all his former subordinates went to visit their old superior. Junyi also went. His complexion was as before, entirely unchanged. The magistrate recognized him and asked, “Do you possess the Way? In the old days at the county office, you were of an age with these men. Now my hair is white, yet you remain youthful.” Junyi replied, “A mere coincidence.”

Du Bian, appointed Inspector of Jiaozhou, contracted a deadly illness and died. After three days, Junyi, who was then in the south, went to him. He placed three medicinal pellets into the dead man’s mouth and had others lift the corpse’s head, shaking it to dissolve the medicine. After the time it takes to eat a meal, Bian opened his eyes and moved his limbs. His complexion gradually returned, and by midday he could sit up. Within four days, he was able to speak. He said that when he died, it was as if in a dream. He saw dozens of black-clad men come to take him away, placing him on a dew-drenched carriage. They entered a great crimson gate and proceeded directly to a prison of inch-wide cells, each just large enough for one person. Bian was placed in a cell, and earth was packed in from outside, so he could no longer see beyond. In a daze, he heard someone say, “The Great One has sent envoys to summon Du Bian. Quickly open the cell and release him!” He heard people digging at his cell with iron tools. After a long while, they pulled him out. Outside, he saw carriages and horses with crimson canopies. Three men sat in one carriage, one holding a tally and calling Bian to board. They returned to the gate, and then he awoke.

After Bian revived, he built a tall tower in his courtyard for Junyi. Junyi did not eat cooked food, only dried meat and dates, and drank a little wine. Each day, Bian prepared three meals for him. Junyi would come to Bian’s residence to eat and drink. When descending the tower, he seemed to fly like a bird, instantly arriving at his seat without appearing to descend. Ascending was the same. This continued for a year. When Junyi sought to leave, Bian wept and entreated him to stay, but Junyi refused. Bian asked, “Where do you intend to go? I shall prepare a large boat for you.” Junyi said, “No boat is needed. A coffin will suffice.” Bian had one made. The next day at noon, Junyi died. Bian had him buried. Seven days later, a man from Rongchang arrived and saw Junyi. He thanked Duke Du and urged him to take good care of himself. Bian then opened Junyi’s coffin and found only a piece of silk—one side painted with a human figure, the other inscribed with cinnabar talismans.

Later, Junyi returned to live at the foot of Mount Lu. A young man had long suffered from leprosy and was near death. He carried himself to Junyi, kowtowed, and begged for mercy. Junyi had the man sit in a room, covering his eyes with five layers of cloth and instructing him not to move. He ordered his household to keep away. The patient said he felt something come and lick him, the pain unbearable, as if its tongue were a foot long. Its breath was as large as an ox’s. He did not know what it was, but after a long while, it left. Junyi then removed the cloth, gave the man water to drink, and sent him away, saying he would soon recover but must avoid the wind. Within ten days, the man’s body turned entirely red, his skin gone, and the pain was severe. When he bathed in water, the pain ceased. After twenty days, new skin grew, and his sores healed. His body was smooth as congealed fat.

Later, during a great drought, all the grains withered. The county magistrate, Ding Shiyan, said to his aides, “Master Dong possesses the Way. He must be able to bring rain.” He personally brought wine and dried meat to see Junyi and explained the drought. Junyi said, “Rain is easily obtained.” Looking up at his roof, he said, “A poor man’s house is open to the sky. It cannot bring rain. What to do?” The magistrate understood his meaning and said, “Master, just pray for rain. I shall have a proper roof built.” The next day, Shiyan led his officials and laborers to gather bamboo and construct a house. When the roof was finished and they were about to plaster it, the workers dug earth to make mud, intending to fetch water. Junyi said, “No need to carry water. By dusk, it will rain.” That night, a great rain fell, sufficient everywhere.

Junyi lived in the mountains, treating the sick without accepting money or goods. He instructed those cured of serious illnesses to plant five apricot trees, and those with minor ailments to plant one. After several years, he had over a hundred thousand trees, forming a dense forest. Among the mountains, all manner of creatures—birds and beasts—played beneath the apricot trees, yet no grass grew, as if the ground had been weeded. When the apricots ripened, Junyi set up a granary beneath the trees and told the people, “Those who wish to buy apricots need not announce themselves. Simply take them. Place a measure of grain in the granary, then take an equal measure of apricots.” If someone placed little grain but took many apricots, three or four tigers would chase and bite at them. The person would flee in terror, the apricots spilling, and the tigers would depart. Upon returning home, the apricots would match the amount of grain given. Others who came empty-handed to steal apricots were pursued by tigers to their homes and bitten to death. Their families, knowing they had stolen apricots, returned them, kowtowed, and apologized. The dead revived. Thereafter, those buying apricots measured them fairly in the grove, daring not to cheat.

Junyi used the grain he received to relieve the poor and provide for travelers, distributing three thousand *hu* each year, with much still remaining. The magistrate’s relative had a daughter possessed by a demonic spirit, and no one could cure her. He said to Junyi, “If you can heal my daughter, I shall offer her as your attendant.”

Junyi then commanded the demonic spirits, and a great white serpent—sixteen feet in length—appeared at the door of every afflicted person. Junyi sent someone to slay it, and the girl’s illness was immediately cured. Thereupon, the magistrate’s relative gave his daughter to Junyi in marriage. For many years, they had no children. Whenever Junyi went out, his wife could not bear to stay alone, so she begged for a girl to raise. The girl was ten years old when, one morning, Junyi rose bodily into the clouds. His wife and adopted daughter remained in the house, selling apricots to sustain themselves. If anyone dared cheat them, tigers pursued them as before. The adopted daughter grew up and took a husband to live with them. Her husband was a violent man who often stole clothing and objects from the temples. The gods of the temples spoke through a shaman, saying: “So-and-so relies on being the son-in-law of an immortal to seize our belongings. Though we are not here, we feel only shame. For the immortal’s sake, we shall not question him.” Junyi lived among the people for nearly a hundred years before ascending to heaven, his complexion still like that of a man of thirty.

Li Gen
Li Gen, styled Ziyuan, was a native of Xuchang. There was a man named Zhao Jia who, having heard from his father and grandfather that they had seen Gen in their time, followed Gen from childhood. When Jia was eighty-four, Gen remained youthful and unaged. Formerly, in Shouchun, he had stayed with a man called Wu Taizhang, who studied the Dao under him and mastered the method of making gold and silver, which succeeded instantly. Gen could transform himself and enter fire and water unscathed. With a mere gesture, he could summon a traveling kitchen to serve twenty people, providing refined delicacies and rare treasures from all directions, none of which were native to the land. One day, he suddenly told Taizhang: “Wang Ling will be defeated, and Shouchun will fall. You cannot remain here amid the chaos—leave at once.” The crowd sent men to seize Gen, intending to kill him. At that moment, Gen was about to write a letter. Suddenly hearing that over a thousand men had surrounded his house in search of him, he said to Taizhang’s father: “Quickly tell them I do not know. Let the officials search themselves. I left yesterday.” Taizhang went to the door, turned back to look, and saw that Gen had vanished, along with all his writing implements and belongings. The soldiers entered and searched every nook—granaries, food stores, clothing chests—yet found no trace of Gen. After a long while, Taizhang emerged and saw Gen still seated in his former place, composed as before. Gen said to Taizhang: “The Grand Marshal Wang will be executed with his clan. Your younger brother has leaked this, and he will die within ten days.” All came to pass as he foretold.

A disciple once offered his daughter to Gen. This girl was literate. When Gen went out, she secretly read a scroll of his writings and found his own account of his Daoist studies, stating that he had learned the Dao from a certain person during the *Yuanfeng* era of the Han, making him over seven hundred years old at the time. Taizhang also said that Gen’s pupils were square, and according to the *Classic of Immortals*, a person’s pupils become square at eight hundred years of age. Gen told his disciples: “I have not attained the great elixir or the supreme Dao, only the method of earthly immortality. My lifespan will endure as long as heaven and earth, yet I shall not be counted among the immortals of the lower realms.”

Li Yiqí
Li Yiqí was a native of Shu Commandery, known to generations of his family.

Clouded in tradition was he, a man of Emperor Wen of Han’s time, without wife or child. When travelers wished to journey afar and return swiftly, Yiqí would give them a talisman and inscribe their feet with cinnabar, enabling them to cover a thousand *li* and return before the day’s end. When others spoke of the palaces, temples, markets, and towns of the four directions, if someone present had not seen them, they would ask again. Yiqí would then take a pinch of earth and shape it into models—each prefecture and kingdom perfectly rendered, though no larger than a thumb—only for them to dissolve in an instant.

At times, he would wander without destination, returning to Shu after a year or so. Whatever alms he received, he gave to the poor. In a corner of Chengdu, he fashioned a mud cave and dwelt within, clad in a single garment through winter and summer. His hair he trimmed to a length of five *cun*, eating only a little wine, dried meat, dates, and fruit. Sometimes he would fast for a hundred days, and if he did not emerge from his cave, he took no food at all.

When Liu Xuande sought to march east to avenge Guan Yu’s grievance, he sent for Yiqí. Upon his arrival, Xuande received him with reverence and asked his counsel on the campaign. Yiqí did not answer but instead requested paper and brush. Xuande provided them, and Yiqí drew a dozen sheets of soldiers, horses, and weapons, then tore each one to pieces with his hands, exclaiming, “Alas, alas!” Next, he drew a great man, dug a pit in the earth, and buried the figure before departing at once. Xuande was displeased, yet he set out with his army—only to suffer a crushing defeat. Of his hundred thousand troops, barely a few hundred returned; weapons, armor, and supplies were utterly lost. Xuande, consumed by shame and fury, fell ill and died in the Palace of Eternal Peace. Only then did he recall the figure Yiqí had drawn and buried—an omen of his own death.

Yiqí spoke little. When questioned, he seldom replied. Yet when the people of Shu faced troubles and sought his divination, he had a fixed method: they observed his countenance. If he appeared joyful, all affairs would be auspicious; if grim, all would turn ill. More than a hundred days before Deng Ai’s arrival in Shu, Yiqí suddenly vanished. Later, he entered the Langye Mountains and never emerged again.

Wang Xing
Wang Xing was a native of Yangcheng who dwelt in a valley. An ordinary man, unlettered and without thought of cultivating the Dao, he nonetheless attained longevity. In the second year of *Yuanfeng* during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, the emperor ascended Mount Song, climbed the Chamber of Great Folly, and built a Daoist palace. He sent Dong Fengjun, Dongfang Shuo, and others to purify themselves and meditate upon the spirits. That night, a transcendent over two *zhang* tall appeared, his earlobes hanging to his shoulders. Emperor Wu bowed and questioned him, and the transcendent replied, “I am an immortal of Mount Jiuyi. I heard that on the Central Peak grows a stone-borne *Acorus* of nine joints per *cun*, which, when consumed, grants long life. Thus have I come to gather it.” With that, he vanished. Emperor Wu turned to his attendants and said, “He who seeks neither the Dao nor elixirs must be a spirit of the Central Peak, come to instruct me.” He then gathered and consumed the *Acorus*, continuing for two years. Yet Emperor Wu favored rich, heated foods, and the *Acorus* only exacerbated his discomfort, leaving him restless and unwell. He ceased its use. Many of his officials also took it, but none persisted. Only Wang Xing, hearing of the immortal’s instruction to the emperor, gathered and consumed it without pause, thereby attaining long life. In the time of Emperor Wu of Wei, he still lived. His neighbors, young and old, attested to having seen him across generations, ever appearing as a man of fifty, robust and able to walk three hundred *li* in a day. Later, he vanished without trace.

Huang Jing
Huang Jing, styled Boyan, was a native of Wuling.

In his youth, he studied the classics and served as a subordinate official in his prefecture. Later, he abandoned worldly life to study the Dao on Mount Huo, where he remained for over eighty years. He then entered the Central Peak, dedicating himself to qi-absorption and grain avoidance, practicing the arts of ingestion and exhalation. He mastered embryonic breathing and inner visualization, summoning the Six Jia Jade Maidens, swallowing the yin-yang talismans, and meditating upon the Red Star before the Grotto Chamber, expanding it until it blazed like fire throughout his body. By two hundred years of age, he had reverted to youthful vigor. The Daoist Wang Ziyang visited him several times, seeking essential teachings. Jing said to Ziyang: “I do not cultivate the Way of ingesting elixirs, but only abide by nature—thus I am but an earthbound immortal. What need is there for inquiry? I have heard of the method by which Lord Yin of Xinye ascended to heaven through divine cinnabar—this is the ultimate of the great Dao. You should follow it. Yet those who, like me, can cast aside desires and cravings are not fit to learn what I practice.”

Ziyang persisted in his entreaties, so Jing told him: “Within the Great Pass lies the Auxiliary Star—visualize and perceive it, and through repeated practice, it will take form. The Red Youth stands in the Vermilion Court of the Horse, pointing and swaying to refine the body’s form. Dispel the Three Corpses, erase the name of death, and if you can guard this steadfastly, you may attain long life. Lose it, and you will soon forfeit the true (mysterious) reality.”

Ziyang received these teachings and thereby obtained the Dao of long life.

Lu Nüsheng
Lu Nüsheng was a native of Changle. She consumed sesame and *Atractylodes*, abstained from grain for over eighty years, and remained youthful and robust, able to walk over three hundred *li* in a day and chase down roe deer. Her village passed down accounts of seeing her across more than two hundred years. Later, she entered Mount Hua. Fifty years after parting from an old acquaintance, the person entered the temple on Mount Hua and encountered Nüsheng, who was riding a white deer, followed by several dozen jade maidens.

Gan Shi
Gan Shi was a native of Taiyuan.

Skilled in the practice of qi-cultivation, he abstained from food and drink, and also consumed *Asparagus cochinchinensis*. He engaged in the arts of the bedchamber, following the methods of Rongcheng and the arcane plainness, further refining and expanding them into a single scroll. Its application yielded swift results. He treated illnesses without acupuncture, moxibustion, or medicinal decoctions. Having lived among men for over three hundred years, he then entered Mount Wangwu to ascend as an immortal.

Feng Junda
Feng Junda was a native of Longxi. He consumed *Polygonatum sibiricum* for over fifty years and later entered Mount Wushu, where he ingested refined mercury. Though he came and went among his hometown for over a hundred years, his appearance remained that of a man in his thirties. He often rode a black ox, and whenever he heard of someone afflicted by illness or near death, he would visit and administer medicine, curing them with a touch. He never revealed his surname or given name to others; the world recognized him by his black ox and thus called him the Black Ox Daoist. Over two hundred years later, he entered Mount Xuanqiu to ascend as an immortal.
