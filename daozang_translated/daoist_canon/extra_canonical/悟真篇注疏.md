# 悟真篇注疏

The Imperial *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*
*Masters Section, Volume 14*
*Annotated Commentary on the "Awakening to Reality"*
*Daoist School*
*Abstract*

We, your ministers, respectfully note: *The Annotated Commentary on the "Awakening to Reality"* comprises three scrolls, with an appended *Detailed Explication of Direct Pointers* in one scroll. The work was composed by Zhang Boduan of the Song dynasty, annotated by Weng Baoguang, and later supplemented with additional exegesis by Dai Qizong.

Boduan, also named Yongcheng and styled Pingshu, was a native of Tiantai. During the Xining reign, he traveled to Shu, where he encountered an extraordinary person who transmitted to him the secrets of the Golden Elixir’s firing times. In the Yuanfeng reign, he attained the Dao in Jinghu, leaving behind a gatha on non-arising before passing away. His disciples cremated him, and what remained resembled the śarīra of the Buddhist tradition—countless in number. Seven years later, he was seen again in Wangwu Mountain, hence the popular legend of his ascension as an immortal.

This text elucidates the essentials of the Golden Elixir, standing alongside the *Triple Concordance Canon* as a foundational work revered by Daoists. Where it states, *"To know the source of the medicinal stream, seek only in the southwest—your native land,"* it echoes the *Triple Concordance Canon*’s *"Three days emerge as the fresh dawn; the Metal of the West is the barrier."* Where it speaks of *"a medicinal weight of one catty requiring two eights,"* it aligns with the *Triple Concordance Canon*’s *"Above, the trigram ☱ (Dui) counts eight; below, the trigram ☶ (Gen) also counts eight."* Where it declares, *"The three, five, and one—these three characters—are truly rare to comprehend in ancient or modern times,"* it mirrors the *Triple Concordance Canon*’s *"The three and five unite as one; the essence of Heaven and Earth—this can be transmitted orally but not in writing."* Where it advises, *"Wood born of fire inherently conceals its edge; one must subdue it to seek the Golden Duke,"* it reflects the *Triple Concordance Canon*’s *"The maiden of the River (mercury) takes flight when touched by fire; to restrain her, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root."*

These mutual elucidations delve profoundly into the mysteries, yet few cultivators of the Dao attain true understanding. During the Qiandao reign, Weng Baoguang of Xiangchuan divided the text into three sections, composing annotations to expound its meaning. He further appended *A Detailed Explication of Direct Pointers from "Awakening to Reality."* After prolonged circulation, the work was mistakenly attributed to Xue Daoguang, obscuring Baoguang’s name. By the Zhishun reign of the Yuan dynasty, Dai Qizong of Jiqing obtained the authentic version and meticulously revised it, establishing it as Baoguang’s annotation. He then composed a commentary to accompany it. Both men possessed deep mastery of elixir arts, grounding their explanations in solid principles.

As they state: *"Borrowing the true yin and true yang as two substances, one seizes the single qi of Heaven and Earth to forge the elixir, returning it to the Cinnabar Field and Sea of Qi within. There, it governs the postnatal qi of the entire body, drawing it inward as stars gather around the North Star."* Their discourse indeed encapsulates the secrets of elixir arts. Among the many commentaries on *Awakening to Reality*, none surpass this edition in clarity and precision. Thus, we include and preserve it to represent one of Daoism’s essential teachings.

Respectfully submitted for imperial review in the seventh month of the forty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign.

**Original Preface to the *Annotations and Commentaries on Awakening to Reality***

*Awakening to Reality* divides the Dao into two schools—*xing* (nature) and *ming* (life)—instructing practitioners to advance each within its proper domain. It further distinguishes inner and outer elixirs, guiding them to progress in unison. Thus, it stands as the foundational scripture of elixir arts for the ages, a teaching to be transmitted alongside the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* for eternity. Before Ye Wenshu’s annotations, the text circulated among masters without explanatory notes, leaving its meanings obscure. After Ye’s commentary, later generations, though obscured by the Dao, failed to discern its errors.

Of the dozens of commentaries I have examined, all offer one-sided interpretations through solitary cultivation or misguidedly annotate it with peripheral arts, causing the great Way of the Golden Elixir to fade from the world. Seekers grope in darkness, finding no path to its gate, while oral transmissions from masters have nearly vanished. With no masters to follow, how can one hear the teachings? Thus, those who hear them are few—how then could there be those who practice them?

The commentary attributed to Shi Zixian merely treasures the words of the Perfected One, unaware that later generations plagiarized Weng Baoguang’s annotations, falsely attributing them to Daoguang. I have meticulously distinguished these at the end of the text.

The *Wumingzi* was also a disciple of the Perfected One. In the *gui-si* year of the Qiandao reign (1173), upon seeing the errors in Wenshu’s annotations, he feared the great Way would be further obscured. Thus, he composed *Explanations of the Meanings*, elucidating the profound principles and expounding the three vehicles’ truths, fully revealing the celestial mechanisms to clarify the master’s safeguards.

During my time in Ruiyang, I was shown several passages from Shi Zixian’s commentary on *Awakening to Reality*. Its annotations differed from other schools, and when compared with the teachings of my father and master, none aligned. I harbored deep doubts. Upon reading it repeatedly, I began to glimpse its subtleties. Later, obtaining the full text, I pored over it day and night, scrutinizing each word and sentence, engaging in prolonged reflection with my elder brother, Zhongfu, the County Magistrate. Through years of questioning, answering, debating, and verifying, I realized it harmonized with the *Cantong Qi* and the great elixir’s safeguards.

Though I had long studied the *Cantong Qi* and the mysteries of the Daoist teachings, my karmic conditions had not yet aligned, and I had no other practice. It was only through *Awakening to Reality* that I came to understand the safeguards. Yet even then, its distinctions between inner and outer elixirs, and the mysteries of the momentary alchemy, remained unclear. How much more so for others?

The immortals guarded their secrets, and no texts described them. With no master to consult and no texts to study, my heart remained fixed on this pursuit, never wavering. Heaven guided my resolve: in the summer of the *xin-wei* year of the Zhishun reign (1331), I met a master and received the oral transmission. Returning home, I shared it with my brother, who rejoiced without sleep. Later, upon seeing the *Wumingzi*’s annotations, it was as if they matched perfectly. I then knew that celestial immortality could be learned, that the primordial spirit was deathless, and that the immortals Zhong and Lü shared this same Way. With but a moment’s effort, one could ascend to the sacred realm—no wonder the heavens had sworn never to transmit it to mortals!

Alas! Since the *gui-hai* year of the Yanyou reign (1313), when I served as Professor of the Shaoxing Prefecture School, I have been fifty-two years old. Through relentless hardships, I nearly lost my life, and so I resolved to abandon fame and profit, dedicating myself wholly to the completion of *xing* and *ming*. My devotion was deep, my study diligent—I did not betray the Daoist heart. Though my master’s teachings led me through favorable circumstances, I remained untroubled by worldly burdens, my official rank rising no more than a few grades, my wealth never exceeding a hundred gold. What benefit did this fleeting life bring me? Now, knowing the truth yet failing to refine myself would be the height of folly—a single misstep in this human form, and a thousand kalpas would pass before another chance. How much rarer still to hear the Dao!

After hearing the Dao, I vowed to universally deliver all beings. Yet in the stillness of midnight, I dared not recklessly divulge celestial secrets—how then could I guide others? To tread the path without fear of heavenly retribution would violate my master’s oath. Thus, I have set it forth in writing and spoken it aloud. The world has long been deluded—who would believe? Therefore, I have compiled the refutations of heterodox schools by past patriarchs, so that practitioners may recognize their futility in attaining celestial immortality. This may prompt reflection on the true path to the Dao. Hence, I title it *Dispelling Delusions in the Study of Immortality*.

Once delusions are dispelled, how then to guide others into the mysteries of the Dao? I selected ten scriptures and Daoist classics of shared principles, using the master’s secret transmissions to elucidate the immortals’ intent, composing annotations to clarify the true path of immortal arts. Thus, I title it *The Orthodox Lineage of Immortal Study*, which is recorded in a separate collection.

Unexpectedly, my elder brother passed away before we could refine our practice together, deepening my vigilance. As my years advance, I redouble my resolve to hasten my cultivation. Finding the *Wumingzi*’s annotations occasionally unclear or its symbolic imagery incomplete, I composed commentaries for each chapter to illuminate its unexhausted subtleties, revealing the symbolic principles of the Golden Elixir and their interdependent functions.

Moreover, *Awakening to Reality* describes distinct methods for inner and outer elixirs, often using similar phrases with divergent meanings. It speaks of "establishing the furnace and tripod" yet also of "idly guarding the elixir furnace without firewood or charcoal." It claims the elixir "forms in an instant" yet also "ripens in ten months." Sometimes a single object illustrates a teaching, yet the applied methods differ; other times, multiple names serve as metaphors, yet the object remains the same. Such variations abound, easily misleading readers. Some verify one passage only to err in another, or grasp one meaning while losing another. This leads seekers to mistake partial truths for the whole, falling into heterodox paths. The more they know, the more entrenched their delusions become. They err in their own practice and mislead others, deepening the confusion—how lamentable!

Now, I have categorized the poems and lyrics, grouping them under distinct headings. Reading the main text alone reveals the general meaning, but the annotations and commentaries make it even clearer, rendering the path plainly visible. Those who obtain this book are destined for immortality; those who hear this teaching share its fate. Those who hear it and cultivate without doubt will cast aside worldly attachments, embrace unity, and empty the heart, fully realizing the truths of the three vehicles. They will not squander their lives but will transmit the immortals’ teachings, striving diligently without negligence.

As for the supreme vehicle, it must be self-realized and cannot be transmitted through words or language. Those who mistake oral teachings for the Dao fall into the emptiness of external paths, confusing it with the mysteries of immortal arts. Both the two schools and the two elixirs, when practiced in isolation, lead many into the currents of delusion. It is my hope that students of immortality will devote themselves to harmonious progress, fusing their cultivation. Only then can their celestial ranks differ, and I may repay, in some small measure, the kindness of my master, my true father, and my brother.

Respectfully inscribed in the first year of the Zhiyuan reign (1264) by Kongxuanzi Dai Qizong, courtesy name Tongfu.

On the day of Xu Zhenjun’s ascension to immortality, he declared: *"One thousand two hundred and forty years after my ascension, within the Five Mounds, eight hundred will attain immortality. In the middle of the Yu River, a great isle will emerge, spanning the river’s mouth—this will be the time."*

In the year of *jiazi* during the Chunxi reign (1174), one thousand two hundred and twenty-six years have now passed since Xu Zhenjun’s ascension. The great isle spanning the Yu River appears as if by divine decree—ah! Heaven raised Jingyang to preside over immortal affairs during the Jin dynasty, and now this portent unfolds as foretold. I know that within the Five Mounds, those who advance in this Dao are either awakened disciples or their descendants, for Heaven shall spread the true wind across the cosmos and establish the immortal realm in Yuzhang. How majestic is our Song dynasty, which produced the awakened one to govern the celestial registers and secretly assist the imperial house! Otherwise, how could he have received the title of *Zixuan* from the nine heavens?

The immortal Wuzhen, having heard the Dao atop Mount Qingcheng and refined the elixir between Jing and Hu, transmitted his teachings once to give rise to Guangyi Zi, and again to give rise to Wuming Zi. Truly, this is a land of immortals, where spiritual essence gathers and genius is nurtured within the Five Mounds, foretelling the immortal realm of Hongdu. Yet alas, many have misinterpreted Wuzhen’s single work—how can one reverse the raging tide or dam the hundred rivers to flow eastward?

Wuming Zi took up his brush to annotate it, each word like unrefined gold, each sentence like uncut jade, rendering great merit to this Dao. One day, he showed it to me, and I composed a preface outlining its general principles. The Purple Yang Elder of Wuling, Chen Daling, wrote the preface.

Kongxuan Zi says: *"Refining the elixir between Jing and Hu"*—according to Bai Yuchan’s *Xishan Fayu*, Zhang Pingshu succeeded only after encountering Ma Duyun, and Daoguang achieved the elixir only after meeting Zhang Huanwei. Thus, refining the elixir in Jinghu follows the method of Ma Chuhou. After the Perfected One attained the Dao, he again met Ma Chuhou in Hedong. Before departing, he entrusted the *Wuzhen Pian* to Chuhou, who later transmitted it in detail, as recorded in Lu Yanfu’s account.

The first transmission gave rise to Guangyi Zi. Liu Yongnian, who styled himself Shunli Guangyi Zi, published the *Cantong Qi* with chapter divisions and *Tongzhen Yi* in the *renshen* year of Shaoxing (1152). In his preface, he wrote: *"The Cantong Qi* illustrates the mechanism of the golden elixir in full. Those who fail to thoroughly explore this scripture merely follow its superficial allure, refining elixirs from metals and minerals with ordinary fire—how erroneous!"* Earlier, in the *wuwu* year of Shaoxing (1138), Yongnian had encountered a perfected one who personally transmitted oral instructions, admonishing him: *"Simply guard the Cantong Qi, for it aligns with my teachings."* Yongnian diligently followed his master’s words, and upon studying it, the principles became clear, leaving no doubt. He then gathered countless versions, meticulously collated and printed them, making them available to those of sincere interest so they might grasp the true subtleties—was this not a great merit?

When I, Qizong, first saw the printed edition, the imperial library version had not yet been released, and its text still contained errors. In reading the *Cantong Qi*, one should regard Bao Zhongqi’s collated secret library edition as authoritative, though even his version contains minor discrepancies. To clarify the *Tongzhen Yi*, one must rely on Peng Zhenyi’s annotated main text. I have therefore added annotations and comparisons to the original text.

The immortal Chen Xianweng of Ziyang, a native of Wuyi, left behind recorded sayings divided into sixty-four discourses, distinguishing the two schools of *xing* and *ming* and the two elixirs of internal and external. He also said: *"Without reading the ancient text *Longhu Shangjing*, one cannot know the subtleties of the two vapors of metal and water. Without reading the *Cantong Qi*, one cannot know the essence of the sun and moon’s one *jin*. Without reading the *Wuzhen Pian*, one cannot know the divine power of the two chapters of gold and jade. This Dao is the subtlest of the subtle, the most mysterious of the mysterious."*

One must gather the undivided *qi* of the dragon and tiger, absorb the nascent essence of the *kun* snake. Among the three hundred lines, whether civil or martial, within the sixty-four hexagrams, *Zhun* and *Meng* form the elixir in an instant and complete the Dao in nine years. It is also said: *"The Dao comes from within—where to place the furnace and tripod is external. The Dao comes from without—where true lead and true mercury reside is internal. One *jin* within, one *jin* without: purple gold transforms into purple powder, and purple powder transforms into the golden elixir."* This is the distinction between the internal and external elixirs of the prior heavens. Though these two emerge from the same source, they differ in name and function. The Dao of internal and external is thus perfected, complete, and beyond augmentation.

When the external elixir returns to the internal elixir, the internal connects with the external, and both must be in harmony. From this, we see that the Dao of Ziyang aligns with that of Wuzhen.

The Master once told me: *"The immortal of Tiantai attained the Dao and received his mandate from the Supreme Emperor as the Purple Void Perfected One, secretly aiding the imperial house. He often appeared and vanished in the world, yet none recognized him. In his youth, the immortal studied alongside Cheng Zu at the Imperial Academy. While Cheng did not pass the examinations, the immortal was born with a spiritual root. Upon reading Buddhist texts, he suddenly felt the sorrow of the bamboo’s bondage, instantly awakening to the unborn and directly transcending into the true emptiness of the pure nature-sea. In his later years, he met the Elder of Qingcheng in Chengdu and fully grasped the wondrous subtleties of the golden elixir, thoroughly understanding the mechanism of yin-yang inversion and the principle of heaven-earth’s cyclic generation. Thus, he cultivated the true and returned to life, refining his form to ascend into the formless, embracing the One with an empty heart, and perfecting both *xing* and *ming* in quiescence. Thereby, his form and spirit became wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth, transforming endlessly and universally manifesting in the dharma-realm to broadly deliver the deluded. During the Yuanfeng era, he and Liu Fengzhen’s disciples widely propagated Buddhist teachings, leaving a gatha on the unborn before entering quiescence. Fengzhen’s disciples cremated his remains and obtained hundreds of relics, some as large as fox nuts. Seven years later, Fengzhen’s disciples arrived at Wangwu Mountain and again encountered the immortal as before—this further demonstrated his wondrous unity of form and spirit, the perfection of both *xing* and *ming*."*

The immortal was endowed with a benevolent and magnanimous nature, thoroughly investigating principle and exhausting *xing* to attain *ming*. The three schools converged in him, their wondrous functions undifferentiated. Yet he did not wish to cultivate only himself, so he composed the *Wuzhen Pian* to instruct later learners. He began by enticing them with the Dao of immortality and the path of cultivation, placing the art of the golden elixir at the forefront of the work. He concluded by dispelling illusions with the true suchness of emptiness, ending the volume with Chan songs. The essentials of the golden elixir lie in the two substances of true yin and true yang in the proportions of two and eight, establishing the furnace and tripod to lure the prior-heaven’s *qi* into them, transforming it into a grain as small as a millet seed, called the *Taiyi Han Zhen*. Thus, he first arranged sixteen seven-character quatrains to represent the numbers of true yin and true yang. Next, he composed a five-character quatrain to represent the singularity of *Taiyi*—the single grain of the golden elixir. After obtaining this grain and ingesting it into the cinnabar field, one then circulates the fire in accordance with the sixty-four hexagrams. Therefore, he appended sixty-four quatrains to correspond to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*.

The workings of the celestial fire span ten months, with bathing periods included, totaling twelve months. Thus, twelve *Xijiangyue* lyrics were appended to correspond to the twelve months of the celestial cycle. When the ten months of practice are complete and the embryo is fully formed, the body transforms into pure yang *qi*. Therefore, eighty-one regulated poems were composed in total, symbolizing the pure yang number of nine nines.

Once the body has transformed into *qi*, one then embraces the primordial for nine years, refining *qi* into spirit, and uniting spirit with the Dao. Thus, both form and spirit attain perfection, ascending into the formless and merging with the true Dao, imperceptible and unfathomable. Hence, both form and spirit, nature and life, all return to the ultimate source of emptiness and quiescence. Therefore, thirty-six Chan songs and verses on nature and the Dao conclude the volume.

The above all follows the symbolic progression of the great elixir’s stages. As for the ingredients, fire phases, and oral instructions—every subtle detail is embedded within the songs and verses. Readers may naturally uncover their meaning through the text.

Later transmissions, however, have grown increasingly widespread, with textual structures and sequences differing greatly and errors multiplying. Only the family copy preserved by Lu Sicheng, grandson of the *Longtu* scholar Lu, remains authentic—this being the very text personally transmitted by the immortal elder. Sicheng himself appended a detailed preface to the volume’s end.

During my travels to Dongting, I obtained this authentic copy and corrected its errors. Only then did I grasp the immortal elder’s intent: the sequence and chapters all correspond to the symbolic methods of the golden elixir. Though the text is concise, its profound principles are fully expounded; though its allusions are subtle, its analogies are intimate and direct. Truly, it is the authentic guide for scholars and the essential compendium of all scriptures.

Yet many of today’s scholars pursue heterodox paths, misapplying their interpretations. Some conflate it with *Tian Ting Zhi Bao*, *Yu Hu Gui Dan*, *Hunyuan Tai Xi*, and other spurious doctrines, recklessly distorting the text and failing to grasp its deep roots and firm foundations. There was also Ye Wenshu, who attempted to explain it through the numbers of the *Tai Ji* and *Da Yan*, even appending diagrams to the volume’s end, calling it *Wu Zhen Pian Wai Bian*. Thus, he mistook shadows for substance and horses for trunks, not only disordering the true scripture but also leading scholars further into confusion.

The immortal elder once said:
*"None are willing to reflect on their own errors,
Instead, they teach others the wrong path,
Leading them astray for eternity in the sea of delusion.
How could one bear such deceit?"*
Is this not a description of Wenshu?

Little did he know that the single grain of golden elixir is none other than the *qi* of the *Tai Ji*. The sage employs the two substances of true yin and true yang to capture this *qi* in a single moment, transforming it into a pearl-like grain. It is produced and ingested within a single *shichen*, instantly transcending to the realm of sages. Thus, the immortal elder said:
*"Within a single *shichen*, the elixir is complete,"*
and
*"Swallowing a single grain of the numinous elixir,
Only then do I know my fate is not ruled by heaven."*
How could these be empty words?

Wenshu, failing to comprehend this principle, dismissed the notion of "a single moment." If one insists that the process cannot be completed in a single moment, then it would require three years or even nine. How could this be the utmost simplicity and ease? Why would the immortal elder speak of *"a brief moment’s effort yielding eternal, boundless joy"*?

He further misconstrued "a single grain" as "a grain per day," citing the words of *Zhen Yi Zi*—*"consume one grain per day"*—as evidence, utterly misunderstanding *Zhen Yi Zi*’s intent. If one were to follow his logic—consuming one grain per day, with each day producing a new grain—then over three or nine years, one would ingest over a thousand grains. How could the immortal elder have deceived others by speaking of only a single grain?

These two points alone suffice to show that Wenshu did not grasp the art of the golden elixir. Thus, his annotations are riddled with errors, and he failed to recognize that the numbers of the *Tai Ji* and *Da Yan* are merely symbolic allusions to the fire phases—superficially plausible but fundamentally flawed. To seek the ultimate Dao of the golden elixir through such symbols is like trying to summon rain by painting dragons or satisfy hunger by drawing cakes. Is this not futile?

Though I am not particularly wise, I have followed in the immortal elder’s footsteps and received the true transmission. How could I remain silent, watching as the red and purple obscure the vermilion, without spreading the elder’s intent, refuting errors, and rescuing future generations from confusion? Thus, undeterred by heavenly retribution, I boldly reveal the celestial mechanism and elucidate the true text, strictly adhering to the immortal elder’s secret transmission:

To refine the great medicine of the golden elixir, first clarify the primordial *qi* of the undivided chaos before heaven and earth separated—this is the foundation of the elixir. Next, distinguish true yin and true yang, the mutually resonant and sentient substances, each weighing eight taels, to establish the furnace and tripod. Using the true *qi* of this furnace and tripod, employ symbolic methods and celestial movements to lure the primordial *qi* of the prior heaven. In no more than half a *shichen*, a single grain of elixir forms within the tripod, as small as a millet seed—this is the golden elixir.

Ingest this single grain of golden elixir, and it will subdue the essence and *qi* of the entire body, like a cat seizing a mouse or a goshawk snatching a bird, leaving them no escape. Then, circulate the true *qi* of yin and yang—termed yin talismans and yang fire—to nurture the essence and *qi*, transforming them into the substance of golden liquid. Suddenly, a substance surges from the *weilü*, ascending through the *jiaji* double pass with a distinct sound, rising to the *niwan*, striking the upper palate, and descending into the mouth in droplets like sparrow eggs, fragrant and sweet—this is the golden liquid returning elixir.

Slowly swallow it into the cinnabar field, where it coalesces into the sacred embryo. After ten months, the embryo is complete, the fire sufficient, and the body sheds its form, bathing and transforming into a body of pure yang, free from hunger, thirst, cold, heat, or harm from blades, tigers, or rhinoceroses. Thus, one becomes a terrestrial immortal, retreating to a secluded place to sit in stillness for nine years, emptying the mind—this is called embracing the One. After nine years of practice, both form and spirit naturally attain perfection, nature and life unite, and one merges with the true Dao, becoming unfathomable in transformation.

This is the ninefold golden liquid great returning elixir. Though the elixir is divided into three stages, they are fundamentally one, progressing from lesser to middle, and from middle to greater—this is the sequence of refining the elixir and entering the Dao.

Therefore, I have divided the text into three volumes:
- The **upper volume** refines the golden elixir as the art of strengthening the army and securing victory,
- The **middle volume** circulates the fire talismans and golden liquid returning elixir as the method of enriching the nation and pacifying the people,
- The **lower volume** presents the ninefold great returning elixir as the Dao of the immortal embracing the One.

This is called the **Three Vehicles Great Method**, corresponding to the true meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*. It is the supreme, limitless, highest-grade celestial immortal’s foremost discipline—the most wondrous and true Dao. The five masters and ancestral teachers transmitted this method orally, and it is the sole practice.

The essence is most simple and most easy, requiring no more than a few words. Yet the sages, fearing the revelation of celestial secrets, employed myriad metaphors—such as the Qian-Kun crucible and furnace, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury—along with countless other esoteric names, all serving but to illustrate the imagery of the golden elixir. Here, I have compiled these variant names, pointing to each with utmost precision, leaving nothing, however minute, unaddressed. Yet, fearing that learners might not grasp the subtleties of their application, I have expounded in exhaustive detail, composing the *Wuzhen Zhizhi* to elucidate the three vehicles’ secret essentials. The *Three Vehicles’ Secret Essentials Treatise* and the *Three Vehicles’ Secret Essentials Poems* are appended at the end of the volume, exhausting the profound and subtle—one might say, fully exposing the true mechanism of heaven and earth, wholly unveiling the immortals’ guarded secrets.

May this be bequeathed to like-minded seekers, that they may delve deeply, perceive clearly, and directly attain the truth of *Wuzhen*, forever holding it as the orthodox Dharma-seal, unconfused by the heterodox teachings of deviant schools.

Written in the mid-autumn of the *gui-si* year of the Qiandao reign of the Great Song, by Weng Baoguang of Xiangchuan, the Nameless One, with reverence.

Master Kongxuan says: The Nameless One divided the text into three volumes, calling it the *Three Vehicles Great Method*, to correspond with the true meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*. This is fundamentally based on the *Jinhua Master’s Explanation of the Yin Fu Jing*. The *Jinhua Explanation* states: "The art of strengthening the army and securing victory is the art of refining the golden liquid to transmute the form. It is the accumulation of yang hun to dissolve yin po, using yang soldiers to battle and repel yin bandits. Through the mutual overcoming of the five phases and the mutual agitation of the eight trigrams, one returns to the root and restores life, resplendently forming the elixir. The returning elixir is refined a hundredfold, its essence lying in the divine water of the Flowery Pond. Humans, born between heaven and earth, ignorant of heaven and earth’s principles, are robbed by yin evil. Time swiftly passes, spirit and essence dissipate, leading to decay. Thus, the sages devised this imagery to lure the true yang qi, congealing it into the divine elixir, prolonging and preserving the form. When spirit and Dao unite, it is like a nation beset by bandits: one must first strengthen the army to suppress them, cherishing its treasures to enrich the nation. Only after abundance is achieved can one practice the Dao of the immortal embracing the One."

**Eulogy:**
The Flowery Pond’s divine water, jade mercury and golden lead,
Qian and Kun provide the means, sun and moon the firing and refining.
Layering and guarding, igniting the fire, advancing and retreating,
Refining with precision, drawing and adding, bathing in the ninefold cycle.
A year of Kan and Li, the head of the work,
Three thousand meritorious deeds—hold fast, never slacken, and the form shall transcend.

The method of enriching the nation and pacifying the people is the art of refining qi. The *Laozi Neijing* states: "The structure of the body mirrors that of a nation." The sage treats the body as a nation, the heart as its ruler, and essence and qi as its people. When the people are at peace, the nation is prosperous; when the people scatter, the nation is desolate. Thus, cherishing essence and treasuring qi leads to longevity. Just as a ruler loves the people as his own children, constantly devising ways to nurture them, ensuring the people’s peace and the nation’s abundance—this is the method of enriching the nation and pacifying the people.

The human form is constituted from the father’s essence and mother’s blood, transformed by primordial qi. The *Zhonghuang Master* says: "Bones and flesh take essence and blood as their root; numinous awareness takes primordial qi as its foundation. Spirit and qi are the root of life. Spirit is the child of qi; qi is the mother of spirit—this is the mother-child within the form. When mother and child are never parted, qi abides serenely within the cinnabar terrace, naturally effecting transformations."

**Eulogy:**
The Gate of Heaven ever open, the Earth’s Door must be shut,
Ever preserve the unbroken thread, never allowing the slightest lapse.
Inhaling to the root, exhaling to the stem,
The child is called spirit, the mother qi.
Like a hen brooding her eggs, like a fish in water,
The sacred embryo forms, naturally shedding the shell.

The Dao of the immortal embracing the One is the art of refining spirit. It is the Dao of original spontaneity. Those who encounter the Dao, ever able to embrace the One and guard the center, attain spirit and qi undispersed, roaming freely as true persons.

**Eulogy:**
The Dao is the root of nature, nature the source of the heart,
Heart and nature are one body, responding and transforming boundlessly.
The common folk’s daily use is also called spontaneity.
If one can awaken, forget images, forget words,
Empty the heart and fill the belly, embrace the One and ascend—
After ninefold refinement, one attains immortality.

It is also said: Practicing the art of refining spirit leads to becoming a spirit immortal—where the form sinks and the spirit transcends, attaining free roaming. Practicing the art of refining qi leads to becoming an embryonic immortal—where the refined form’s spirit and qi intermingle, harmoniously uniting to gestate the embryo and nurture the infant, like the cicada shedding its shell. Practicing the art of refining the form is the method of reversing old age and restoring youth, preserving the form and abiding in the world.

With reverence, I have set forth these words to clarify the Nameless One’s original intent in dividing the text into three volumes. In other editions, the Nameless One is styled Yuanming.

**Preface to the *Wuzhen Pian*:**
Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, time swiftly passes, and the brevity of life is unfathomable. How can one escape karmic retribution without early awakening? Yet, many willingly wait for the end. If, at the final moment, a single thought errs, one instantly falls into the three evil destinies, where eons may pass without deliverance. At such a time, though one may repent, what use is it? Thus, the elders of the Lao and Shi traditions opened the gate of expedient means through the study of nature and life, teaching people to cultivate the seed of liberation and escape birth and death. The Shi tradition takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one awakens suddenly and attains perfect penetration, one directly transcends the other shore. Yet, if habitual tendencies remain unexhausted, one still wanders in the realm of existence. The Lao tradition takes refinement and nurturance as the truth; if one grasps its pivotal essence, one immediately ascends to sagehood. If one has not awakened to original nature, one remains entangled in illusory form. Next, the *Zhouyi* contains sayings on exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and reaching life; the *Lunyu* contains teachings on "no deliberation, no certainty, no stubbornness, no self." These are Confucius’ ultimate attainments in the mysteries of nature and life. Yet, why are his words often brief and lacking in detail? It is because he wished to order human relationships and implement the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music—expedient teachings. Thus, he did not openly expound the Dao of non-action, but embedded life techniques within the imagery of the *Yijing* and interwove nature’s methods within subtle words.

Later, Zhuangzi thoroughly explored the burdens of things and the nature of carefree wandering; Mencius excelled in nurturing the vast qi—both came close to the crux. Then, during the Han, Wei Boyang drew upon the *Yijing*’s principles of yin-yang union to compose the *Cantong Qi*, elucidating the workings of the great elixir. In the Tang, the Loyal National Preceptor, in the preface to his recorded sayings, expounded the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the origin and end of the supreme Dao. Was this not because, though the teachings diverge into three paths, they ultimately converge as one? Yet, how lamentable that later generations of the yellow-robed and black-robed, each clinging to their own school, mutually denigrated one another, causing the essentials of the three traditions to become obscured. Heterodox teachings could not be harmonized and unified.

Moreover, today’s practitioners of the Dao value the cultivation of life yet do not understand that the methods of cultivating life arise from two approaches: those easy to encounter but difficult to accomplish, and those difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. Methods such as refining the five sprouts’ qi, ingesting the seven luminaries’ light, visualization, massage, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures, holding mantras, spraying water, shouting talismans, clacking teeth, gathering spirits, abandoning wives, fasting, preserving spirit, holding the breath, directing thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain, returning essence, and practicing bedroom arts—along with ingesting and refining minerals, herbs, and woods—are all easy to encounter but difficult to accomplish. The above methods, in relation to the Dao of cultivating the body, are generally fragmented. Though one may exert much effort, seeking results proves futile. Even with diligent practice day and night, one may only ward off illness and avoid misfortune. Yet, if one ceases practice even briefly, previous efforts gradually dissipate. This is to delay over years, making success nearly impossible. To hope for a single attainment, eternal attainment, returning to infancy, reversing old age, transformation, and ascension—is this not difficult indeed?

Deeply lamentable indeed—most modern practitioners cling stubbornly to delusions, failing to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, and instead reproach the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that all who attain the Dao do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir, yet fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, they veil it beneath various practices. Among these, only the method of breath-halting bears resemblance: if one can forget all scheming and quiet the mind, it aligns closely with the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles. Diligently practiced, it may lead to samadhi and spirit departure. Yet, as spirit belongs to yin and the dwelling is hard to secure, one must constantly employ shifting methods. Without mastering the Way of returning mercury and restoring lead, how can one reverse yang, renew the bones, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?

The refinement of the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir, though difficult to encounter, is easy to accomplish—provided one thoroughly comprehends yin and yang and deeply penetrates the workings of creation. Only then can one pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, guard the three natures within the Primordial Palace, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband leads and wife follows, the jade crucible simmers, and the golden furnace blazes. Thus the Mysterious Pearl takes form, the Great One returns to truth—all achieved in but a moment’s effort, ensuring boundless joy and eternal bliss. Yet one must vigilantly guard against peril, weigh risks, exercise caution in operation, withdrawal, and replenishment, nurture the upright, and maintain fullness. By embracing femininity and holding to the One, one naturally reverts to the state of infancy, sheds the yin-killing form, completes the cyclical nodes of qi, casts off the mortal husk, and undergoes spiritual transformation. Then one’s name is inscribed in the immortal registers, and the title of Perfected One is conferred—this is the moment when a great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.

Yet today’s scholars mistake lead and mercury for the two qi, designate the viscera as the five phases, divide heart and kidney into Kan and Li, take liver and lung as dragon and tiger, employ spirit and qi as mother and child, and cling to fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of floating and sinking, unable to distinguish host and guest, they are no different from mistaking another’s wealth for their own or calling a stranger’s child their kin. How can they fathom the subtle interplay of metal and wood’s mutual restraint or the profound mystery of yin and yang’s reciprocal use? With sun and moon straying from the Dao, lead and mercury placed in separate crucibles, how can they hope to congeal the Returned Elixir? Is this not difficult indeed?

From youth, I delighted in the Dao, traversing the Three Teachings’ scriptures, as well as those on penal codes, mathematics, medicine, divination, warfare, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and misfortune, death and life—all of which I studied with care and scrutinized in detail. Yet of the Golden Elixir alone, though I perused all the classics and the songs, poems, discourses, and treatises of various schools—all speaking of the sun’s essence and moon’s spirit, the metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury, cinnabar, white gold, and black tin, Kan’s male and Li’s female, capable of forming the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir—none revealed what true lead and true mercury are, nor explained the methods of firing, the degrees of refinement, the nurturing of the elixir, or its ultimate return. Later, deluded disciples arbitrarily imposed their own interpretations upon the sacred teachings of the ancients, distorting them in myriad ways, not only disordering the immortal classics but also misleading later learners.

As an ordinary man, I had yet to encounter the oral transmission, and such secrets were hard to come by. Thus, I grew restless, my spirit weary, my energy exhausted. Though I sought counsel far and wide across mountains and seas, and inquired of both the wise and foolish, none could clarify the true essence. Only after the true teaching illuminated my heart did I, in the *jisi* and *you* years of the Xining era, follow Minister Lu into Chengdu. Unwavering in my original resolve, I redoubled my devotion and was moved to receive from a Perfected One the oral instructions on the Golden Elixir’s ingredients, firing times, and methods. His words were concise, his essentials uncluttered—truly, to point to the stream is to know the source; a single utterance awakens a hundred insights, dispersing the mist like the sun’s brilliance, clearing the dust like a mirror’s clarity. Comparing this with the immortal classics, they matched as if sealed together.

I observed that of those who study immortality, eight or nine out of ten do so, yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essentials. Having encountered the true transmission, how could I dare remain silent? Thus, I poured forth all I had received, composing ninety-nine regulated verses, numbering them *Enlightenment on Reality*. Among these, sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains correspond to the number of two eights; sixty-four quatrains follow the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*; one pentasyllabic verse symbolizes the singularity of the Great One. I later appended twelve *Moon over the West River* lyrics to align with the twelve months. Within these, the hierarchy of the crucible, the weights of the ingredients, the progression and retreat of the firing, the sequence of host and guest, and the conditions of existence and nonexistence, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—all are fully encompassed.

After compiling this work, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and solidifying form, leaving the original source and true awakening of the nature unexplored. Thus, I delved into Buddhist scriptures and the *Records of the Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that ancestral masters had awakened upon hearing bamboo struck, and expressed their realizations in songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses. I composed thirty-two such pieces and appended them to the end of the volume, hoping that the Way of realizing the root and illuminating the nature might be fully expounded herein.

May those of like aspiration who peruse this work perceive the end and awaken to the root, abandon delusion and follow truth.

**Seven-Character Quatrains (Sixteen Poems to Represent the Number One Jin and Two Eights)**

Not seeking the Great Dao, one strays from the path—
Though burdened with talent, how can one be a true man?
A hundred years of light pass swift as spark from flint,
A lifetime’s fate drifts like bubbles on the stream.

Only craving rank and wealth, chasing fleeting glory,
Unseen, the body withers, parched and gaunt.
If gold were piled as high as mountains,
Could it buy escape from impermanence when death arrives?

**Annotation:** In the human world, what is most prized are wealth and nobility—both coveted by all. Thus, people exhaust their nature and life’s purpose, striving with all their might to attain them, deeming success their greatest joy. Yet what drives this pursuit is nothing more than immersion in profit, rank, sensuality, and desire. Little do they know that profit, rank, and sensual pleasures are but spears that sever life and shackles that bind the body.

Ordinary folk, ignorant of the wonders of Dao, virtue, nature, and life, gluttonously chase profit, drowning in delusion, swept away by the river of love, adrift in the sea of desire. Right and wrong, self and other wage war in their hearts; joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure ravage their frames. Thus, demonic forces hasten their breath’s end, the seasons erode their vitality, and unknowing, they spend their lives like fleeting foam upon the water, their hundred years vanishing in an instant like sparks from stone. Even if gold were heaped like bushels or jade stacked like mountains, could it, at the hour of impermanence, buy back a body to spare it from becoming a nest for ants? Alas! What sorrow! What grief!

The life-force has yet to fully depart when the true spirit has already entered another husk.

Master Vacuous Tranquility said: "In this life, unawakened, one passes beyond and exchanges husks, entering another shell, revolving endlessly without awareness. Alas! Rather than unknowingly cast into a foreign form, how much better to dwell in the Great Dao? There, merit is perfected, the body ascends beyond the azure vault, riding cloud-qi and mounting flying dragons to wander the boundless. Death and life no longer alter—thus one attains the title of Perfected Person. This is the season of fulfillment for the true great man, the day of utmost honor and brilliance.

Yet those who, entangled in trivial worldly affairs and burdened by dust-laden hearts, fall into the snares of the mundane—though they possess the heroic talent of Ban and Sima, or the illustrious renown of Su and Zhang—are but wandering souls upon the earth, shadowy wraiths of walking corpses. How could they be deemed true great men?

Thus, the Immortal Elder first composed this chapter, speaking especially to those of lofty insight and exceptional clarity, who may awaken through a single word, seek the Great Dao, escape the paths of delusion, and engage in the work of non-action—these alone are the true great men. All else is unworthy of pursuit."

Disciple Qi Zong of the Contemplative School commented: "To read the Immortal Elder’s poem and Master Wuming’s annotations without awakening is truly the height of folly. Those with eyes to see and ears to hear—how can they fail to set their hands to cultivation?"

Though human life may span a hundred years, its length or brevity, its prosperity or adversity—none can be foreknown. Yesterday, one still galloped through the streets; today, one lies as a corpse within the coffin. Wife and wealth are left behind, not truly one’s own; only the karmic deeds one has committed will accompany one, impossible to deceive. If the Great Elixir is not sought, how can one hope to encounter it? And even if encountered, to fail in its refinement is the height of folly.

The annotation states: The length or brevity of a person’s life, their prosperity or adversity, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—none are not silently determined before they come to pass. How could ordinary people fathom or foresee them? Thus, though human life is said to span a hundred years, by the time one reaches seventy, it is already rare. With this fragile, easily destroyed body, to spend each day in ceaseless toil, chasing after boundless and unpredictable affairs—is this not difficult indeed? When a single breath fails to return, one departs forever, not knowing where one goes—can this not be called a great sorrow?

At such a time, though one may have attained the highest rank, enjoyed boundless emoluments, possessed priceless treasures, or been surrounded by beauties of unmatched allure—all must be left behind, for none are truly one’s own. The only thing that accompanies one, impossible to deceive, is the karmic deeds one has accumulated in life. Thus it is said: "A thousand things will not go with you; only karma follows the body."

Master Cao’s verse says:
*Alas, how hurried and chaotic is human life,*
*Entangled daily in the fire-house of worldly dust.*
*Suddenly, when the three-inch breath in the throat is cut,*
*Body and soul, spirit and hun—all scatter and disperse.*
*No matter how your wife and children wail and call,*
*A thousand cries, ten thousand pleas—you will not turn your head.*
*Though you may have schemed and calculated all your life,*
*Lying in the barren mound, you lose your wits at last.*
Truly, these words are so.

For those who wish to escape the cycle of rebirth and avoid entanglement in the world’s snares, nothing surpasses the Golden Elixir as the numinous ladder to ascend to heaven and the swift path to transcend the mundane. Its Way is most simple and most easy; even the dullest and most foolish may practice it and swiftly ascend to sagehood. Yet the highest sages guard it closely, forbidding its careless disclosure. Those who transmit it do so only through direct oral instruction, never committing it to writing—thus it is rarely encountered. Unless one seeks it with diligence, a steadfast will, and sincere devotion to move the heavens, one may never hear even a hint of it.

In former times, Xie Ziran, finding this Way so difficult to encounter, sought a true master in the Penglai Isles. He exhausted his family’s wealth to prepare a boat, heedless of the peril of towering waves and vast tides, pressing forward without the slightest fear. Thereupon, a divine being was moved to speak to him, saying: "The Penglai Isles are separated by thirty thousand *li* of weak water, upon which not even a mustard seed may float. Where do you intend to go? On the Red City Mountain, there is Sima Ziwei—go and take him as your teacher." Xie turned his boat and sought out Red City Mountain, where he indeed encountered Ziwei, who transmitted the Way to him. After refining it for no more than a few years, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Ah! When a person’s sincerity bursts forth from within, moving and resonating without, what encounter could be impossible? If one can hold fast to the heart and uphold the will in this manner, how could one fail to obtain the Golden Elixir? The Way does not betray people; people betray the Way.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
*The Great Dao is not partial;*
*It is only transmitted to the worthy.*
If one does not exert utmost sincerity and ardent aspiration, how could one encounter it?

The secret essentials of the Golden Elixir are indeed difficult to encounter. Those who do encounter it all possess innate immortal bones and the accumulated profound merits of their ancestors. Yet even so, one must also have the financial means to gather three fellow cultivators before this work can be accomplished—this principle is understood only by those of insight. Truly, it is difficult to explain in full.

Master Yin’s *Six-Five Subtleties* says: "To learn this Way, one must have resources. Without resources, the Golden Elixir cannot be completed." Furthermore, three people are required for its refinement. Thus, when Chongxi Wangjun encountered Liu Haichan and obtained the art of the Golden Elixir, lacking the means to begin, he entered Luoyang to seek the wealthy Han Gong. Relying on his assistance, he completed the Way and departed.

If one encounters this Way yet fails to cultivate it with like-minded companions of means, one is truly the height of folly. The Immortal Elder’s poem to Master Liu says:
*I hear you have known the medicine for many years—*
*Why not gather your heart and refine mercury and lead?*
*Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind.*
*The six paths of rebirth—blame not heaven.*
This is the same meaning.

The commentary states: In the eleventh year of the Zhenyuan era, on the twelfth day of the first month, the Perfected of Guozhou, Xie Ziran, ascended in broad daylight at Golden Spring Mountain outside the western gate of the prefectural city. The entire populace witnessed it. The prefect, Li Jian, reported the matter to the throne, and a stele was erected to record it. The emperor issued an edict in praise, saying: "In this region, numinous immortals manifest their wonders, and the mystic wind flourishes ever more. The supreme Way spreads ever wider."

Han Changli’s poem says:
*In Guozhou’s Nanchong County, the poor scholar Xie Ziran,*
*A child who knew nothing, heard only of immortals.*
*Light of heart, he learned their arts on Golden Spring Mountain.*
*One morning, he sat in empty space; clouds and mist rose from the cliffs,*
*As if the music of pipes and strings came from the void.*
*In an instant, he ascended lightly, drifting like smoke in the clouds.*
*The prefect, astonished, led officials and common folk in haste,*
*But when they entered the gate, nothing remained—*
*Only his cap and shoes, like a cicada’s shed husk.*
*Of old, the affairs of immortals were true—*
*This is certain proof to transmit.*

Wang Bohou’s *Kunxue Jiwen* records: Wang Quan, styled Zizhen, was a man of Yangping in Qixia. In the Yuanfeng era, he was granted the title "Chongxi Recluse." Zhang Yunyou composed a stele inscription for his meritorious deeds, saying: "His transcendent bearing, his companionship with Chen Tunan and Master Cheng Yi—yet one never heard him compose poetry, save for a verse sent to Wang Zizhen:
*I too have the Elixir—do you believe it?*
*When the time comes, can it still aid the people?*
When Master Cheng Yi entered Mount Song, Zizhen awaited him beneath the pines, asking: "How did you know I would come?" He replied: "Last year, I already received word." For the Master had intended to go the previous year but was detained by affairs.

The *You Zhai Man Lu* also records: Wang Quan, styled Zizhen, was a man of the Dao. Fu Zhenggong once lodged with him. In the Yuanfeng era, the emperor bestowed upon him the title "Chongxi Recluse." In the third year of the Yuanfu era, he journeyed to Mount Mao to receive the Shangqing Register. Previously, the stone cavern on the central peak of Mount Mao had suddenly opened—it was the side gate of the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. Since the immortal Zuo Yuanfang had departed, it had been sealed for a thousand years. Now it opened again. For days beforehand, sweet dew descended. The Daoist Liu Hun Kang said: "This must portend something extraordinary." Soon after, the Master arrived. On the night he received the Register, celestial music was heard in the empty sky above. The mountain inscribed a stele to record the event.

---

To learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality;
Only the Golden Elixir is the truest path.
When the two things meet in due season, the nature and emotions unite;
The Five Agents are complete, where tiger and dragon coil.
The root cause lies in *wu-si* as the matchmaker;
Thus husband and wife attain joyous union.
Wait only for the work’s completion to ascend the Jade Palace,
Amidst the nine rosy clouds, riding a soaring simurgh.

A commentary states: Among immortals there are several ranks. Those spirits most numinous yet formless are *gui*-immortals. Those who dwell in the world free from all illness and vexation, enjoying long life, are human immortals. Those who soar through the sky and walk through mist, untroubled by hunger or thirst, unharmed by cold or heat, who roam the island paradises and live forever without dying, are earthly immortals. Those whose form and spirit are both wondrous, who merge with the Dao and become true, who walk beneath the sun and moon without casting a shadow, who pass through metal and stone without hindrance, whom water and fire cannot burn or drown, whose transformations are boundless—now old, now young, now hidden, now manifest, now present, now absent—who disperse to become *qi* and coalesce to take form, beyond the divination of milfoil and tortoiseshell, beyond the knowledge of gods and spirits, are celestial immortals.

Master Yin Zhen says: If one can extinguish desire, cultivate embryonic breathing, shift the spirit, shed the husk, enter samadhi, project the corpse, and rely on the Yin to transform without decay, one may become a lower-rank immortal. Those who receive the talismans of the Six Jias, the registers of Zhengyi Mengwei, Shangqing, and the Three Caverns, along with methods such as sword techniques and corpse liberation, and thereby attain the Dao, are all listed among the immortals of the Southern Palace, dwelling in the various grotto-heavens as middle-rank immortals. Those who refine the Golden Elixir and the Great Medicine, and thereby attain the Dao, ascend bodily into the heavens as the supreme, limitless celestial immortals of the highest rank.

Thus the immortal elders exhort practitioners of the true to establish resolve, be bold and untrammeled, stand apart from the crowd, and transcend the middle and lower ranks of immortals to become the supreme, limitless celestial immortals of the highest rank. Among the seventy-two grades of elixirs, the path to celestial immortality is simple and easily accomplished—only the Golden Elixir is the truest and most direct Way.

This is the creation of something from nothing. It is not the five metals, eight stones, cinnabar, mercury, black lead, white tin, yellow dan, realgar, orpiment, arsenic, powdered frost, verdigris, chalcanthite, autumn stone, plant ashes, frost, dregs, or any of the myriad substances refined through boiling and sublimation—nor even one’s own saliva, essence, *qi*, blood, or fluids—all of which are the creation of something from something. Only the *qi* of the primordial is the *qi* of the undifferentiated chaos before Heaven and Earth separated, the true One of the primordial origin, called the creation of something from nothing. The sage, through method, gathers and captures it within a single *chen*, condensing it into a grain the size of a millet seed, called the Golden Elixir, also known as true lead, yang elixir, the essence of the true One, the water of the true One, true water, the water tiger, or the *qi* of the Great One containing true essence. One who obtains a single grain and ingests it ascends immediately to the realm of the sages—this is the highest imperial examination, the great Way of celestial immortality.

Few in the world know of it. The *qi* of the true One was born before Heaven and Earth, mingling within the formless void, indistinct and elusive—seen but not visible, heard but not audible, grasped but not attainable. How then can it be condensed into a millet seed? The sage gives form to the formless through the substantial and gives shape to the shapeless through the existent. What is substantial and existent is true Yin and true Yang—both are sentient beings of the same kind. What is formless and insubstantial is the *qi* of the initial union of the two eights, which has *qi* but no substance. When these two take form, one thing is born from them. That one thing is the *qi* of the true One, coagulated into a pearl the size of a millet seed.

The scripture says: "In the beginning, the Primordial suspended a precious pearl, large as a millet seed, within the empty void"—this is its proof. Fearing the leakage of Heaven and Earth’s mechanism, the sages used true Yin and true Yang as metaphors for the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, and the *qi* of the two unions as metaphors for true lead and true mercury.

Now, the immortal elders in their poetic verses further designate the single entity of the Azure Dragon with names such as the Crimson Dragon, the Thunder Dragon, the Celestial Soul, the Qian House, the Qian Crucible, the Jade Tripod, Fusang, the Jade Pond, the lower union’s half-moon, Eastern Yang, the Eldest Son, Vermilion Mercury, the Cinnabar Tripod, the Li Sun, and the Scarlet Phoenix—yet all these are but alternate names for the Azure Dragon. Likewise, they designate the single entity of the White Tiger with names such as the Black Tiger, the Dui Tiger, the Terrestrial Soul, the Kun Position, the Kun Tripod, the Metal Tripod, the Metal Crucible, Mount Hua, the prior union’s half-moon, the Western River, the Youngest Daughter, Black Lead, the Crescent-Moon Crucible, the Kan Moon, and the Black Tortoise—yet all these are but alternate names for the White Tiger.

Moreover, they refer to the *qi* of the Dragon as true mercury, the Alchemical Maiden, the Watery Essence, the Azure Maiden, mercury within cinnabar, mercury within vermilion, essence, the Yellow Sprout, the Flowing Pearl, the Azure-Clad Maiden, the Golden Crow, the Li Maiden, the Female Dragon, true fire, the sixteen-year-old Alchemical Maiden, the Jade Fluid, and the Jade Mushroom—though in truth, these are one and the same. Similarly, they name the *qi* of the Tiger as true lead, the Metal Duke, the Metal Essence, gold within water, silver within water, nature, the Golden Flower, White Snow, the White-Clad Gentleman, the Jade Hare, the Kan Son, true water, the Nine-Three Gentleman, the Male Tiger, and the Knife-Tip—though in truth, these are one and the same.

When these two entities interact, their nature and temperament unite: these two are the Dragon and Tiger. The Azure Dragon resides in the East, where the East pertains to Wood, and Wood generates Fire; thus, the *qi* of the Dragon is Fire, termed "temperament," and belongs to the South, where it is called the Vermilion Bird. The White Tiger resides in the West, where the West pertains to Metal, and Metal generates Water; thus, the *qi* of the Tiger is Water, termed "nature," and belongs to the North, where it is called the Dark Warrior. Now, the Dragon is Wood, the Tiger is Metal, nature is Water, and temperament is Fire—these are the Four Symbols. When the Four Symbols gather at the Central Palace to form the elixir, that which unites them is Earth. These constitute the true Five Phases.

When the Dragon and Tiger unite, their nature and temperament harmonize; when the Dragon and Tiger conjoin to form the elixir, the Five Phases are complete. Thus it is said: "When the two entities interact, nature and temperament unite, and the Five Phases are complete—there the Tiger and Dragon coil." The Wood Dragon resides in the East, the Metal Tiger in the West; between these two entities lies a separation—who can cause them to pair and become husband and wife? Their pairing depends solely on the Yellow Dame. With her left hand, she seizes the Dragon; with her right, she grasps the Tiger, causing them to unite. Since Wu and Ji pertain to Earth, she is called the Yellow Dame. Though Metal and Wood are separated, the Yellow Dame enables their union and pairing—how could this not be the matchmaker who brings them together in joyous matrimony?

These two are distinct, yet the *qi* of the true One is concealed within them; these two are one, for the *qi* of the true One transforms them. When the *qi* of the true One transforms, the true person naturally emerges—this is the symbolic method of the external medicine. After ingesting this Golden Elixir, one must further undertake the ten-month work of refining form into *qi*, and then the nine-year practice of embracing the One to transform *qi* into spirit. Only then can form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth, receiving the celestial registers and ascending as a guest to Heaven. When the elixir ripens, the Way is accomplished in the human realm, and one ascends to Heaven, where amidst the nine rosy clouds, wind stirs beneath one’s arms, and one rides the phoenix and mounts the simurgh, soaring through the azure vault. Yet who among those who have not planted the spiritual root and amassed abundant hidden virtue could partake in this?

The commentary states: *The Transmission of the Dao and Collected Writings* says, "Immortals are not of one kind. Those purely Yin without Yang are *gui*; those purely Yang without Yin are immortals; those with both Yin and Yang intermingled are humans. Only humans can become *gui* or immortals. Among immortals, there are five ranks. The *gui*-immortal transcends Yin yet remains within it; their spirit-image is indistinct, their *gui*-pass lacks a surname, and across three lives, they have no name. Though they escape the cycle of rebirth, they struggle to return to Penglai; ultimately, they have no place to abide, resorting to possessing others’ bodies. This is because their spirit remains inwardly fixed, their mind undispersed, and their intent focused—thus they emit a Yin spirit, a numinous *gui* rather than a purely Yang immortal. Since their will is Yin and their spirit undispersed, they are called *gui*-immortals. The followers of Śramaṇa who cultivate to this point claim to have attained the Dao—how laughable!

The human immortal cannot fully embody the great Dao and is limited to the efficacy of a single method or art, enabling peaceful longevity. The earthly immortal grasps the principle of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent, employs the numerology of the Sun and Moon’s waxing and waning, and within the body uses years, months, and days, while within the day uses hours and moments. They recognize the Dragon and Tiger, pair Kan and Li, invert the Five Phases, circulate the *qi* of mother and child, and practice the union of husband and wife. Through repeated refinement, they form the elixir, which permanently resides in the lower field, refining their form to dwell in the world, achieving long life without death as an earthbound immortal.

The divine immortal, weary of dwelling in the dust, continues their practice without cease, refining form into image, causing the Five *Qi* to ascend to the origin, and when the three Yang gather at the crown, their work complete, they forget form, and the fetal immortal naturally transforms. With Yin exhausted and Yang pure, they gain a body beyond the body, shed their form, ascend as immortals, transcend the mundane, and enter sagehood, bidding farewell to the dust to return to the Three Mountains.

The celestial immortal, weary of dwelling on the Three Isles, transmits the Dao among humans. Above, they have merited the Dao; among humans, they have fulfilled their conduct. When their merit and conduct are complete, they receive Heaven’s decree to return to the Grotto-Heavens, ascending to the Eighty-One Yang Heavens, and further to the realm of the Three Pure Ones, the natural realm of numinous light.

There are those born of existence: they transform through tangible things to achieve this. Though they begin with form, how can they transform the tangible into the intangible? From non-existence, existence arises; from the formless, form is born. The form gives rise to the elixir, which, when ingested, can transform the tangible into the intangible, converting postnatal *qi* into prenatal *qi*. Form and spirit both attain perfection, for the formless is the *qi* of the true One, dwelling within the true Dragon and true Tiger, utterly without falsity. Those who grasp this mechanism and steal it can entice the *qi* of the true One to coagulate and generate form. Ingesting a single grain, they instantly ascend to sagehood—this is it. It is not through non-action, non-effort, sitting in meditation, or refining with ordinary fire and common medicines that one can succeed.

In essence, it is one thing, divided into two; within these two things, each contains Yin and Yang, forming the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols unite as one, with Earth at their center, constituting the true Five Phases. When the Five Phases unite as one, they return to their origin—this is the Golden Elixir. Before the entities unite, each conceals the *qi* of the true One within; when the two entities merge, they exchange the *qi* of the true One, and only then does the elixir form.

As the *Oral Transmission from Master Shangyan* states: "Regarding the two entities, each must steadfastly settle the mind and stabilize the work. When the time comes, the eyes will perceive, the heart will awaken, and the numinous light will appear as bright and pure as the moon—this is the white light born in an empty chamber."

Further refining the work requires witnessing the solar orb’s crimson radiance surge forth—only then does the white light vanish. When these two entities are fully realized, the foundation of the elixir is laid, and the Four are poised to coalesce. This method, true within the true, is yet more true, for I alone differ from others in knowing the inversion wrought by *Li* and *Kan*. Who discerns the floating and sinking, the settling of host and guest?

The golden crucible seeks to retain cinnabar within mercury; the jade pool must first receive silver from the waters. Through divine skill, fire is moved—not merely from dawn to dusk—until the abyssal pool reveals a solar orb.

**Annotation:** This Dao is most sagely, most numinous, most noble, most revered, most simple, most effortless—the profound within the profound, the marvelous within the marvelous. Rarely heard in the world, it emerges from the immortals, surpassing all in its purity. Thus did Master Chongxi say: "Of the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, none among the world’s Daoists merit approval—only Pingshu alone. He is Mount Tai, the rivers and seas; how dare the anthills and puddles compare?"

*Li* is Yang yet dwells in the south, thus paradoxically becoming the female, for it is Yang without but Yin within—this is true mercury. *Kan* is Yin yet dwells in the north, thus paradoxically becoming the male, for it is Yin without but Yang within—this is true lead. Hence the immortal’s saying: "The sun resides in *Li*’s position yet becomes the female; *Kan* pairs with the Toad Palace yet is the male." Do not obstruct this inverted intent with narrow views. This speaks of *Kan*’s male and *Li*’s female—like a father’s essence and a mother’s blood, the sun’s crow and the moon’s hare, cinnabar’s mercury and lead’s silver, Heaven’s mystery and Earth’s yellow. These all point to the initial stirring of Dragon and Tiger, the two *qi*.

Host and guest: Yang is noble, ascending to the left as host; Yin is lowly, descending to the right as guest. *Li* is fire, flaming upward, sharing Wood’s floating nature—thus Yang, thus host. *Kan* is water, moistening downward, sharing Metal’s sinking nature—thus Yin, thus guest. This is the ordinary way. Yet now, *Li* reverses to female, *Kan* to male—host becomes guest, guest becomes host. Is this not inversion? Thus it is said: "Only I know the inversion wrought by *Li* and *Kan*; who discerns the floating and sinking, the settling of host and guest?" Settling host and guest means taking the *qi* of the two stirrings within the Dao, inverting their host-guest roles, not adhering to the ordinary order—hence "settling host and guest."

The golden crucible: gold is a Yin substance, yet within the crucible lies the *qi* of fire—this is the image of Yin containing Yang, the White Tiger. The jade pool: jade is a Yang substance, yet within the pool lies the *qi* of water—this is the image of Yang containing Yin, the Green Dragon. Mercury within cinnabar is the Dragon’s stirring *qi*; silver within water is the Tiger’s stirring *qi*. The cultivator of the elixir, wishing to bind the Tiger’s *qi* to the Dragon’s, must first drive the Dragon to the Tiger. Only then do the two entities intermingle, their passions merging, their work of refinement proceeding—naturally congealing the essence of the true One.

Fire is the *qi* of the two stirrings. "Dawn" marks the beginning of the day; *Zi* is the origin of the six Yangs—hence "dawn." The sage moves the elixir fire with divine skill, and in less than half an hour, the essence of the true One is obtained—a grain like millet, appearing in the Northern Sea, its radiance piercing the curtains, like a red sun emerging from the depths of a deep pool. "Not merely from dawn to dusk" clarifies that within one *shichen*, the Golden Elixir is accomplished. This describes the external medicine’s symbolic form.

**Exegesis:** *Kan*’s male, *Li*’s female; the sun’s crow, the moon’s hare; Heaven’s mystery, Earth’s yellow. The golden crucible of Yin contains fire; the jade land of Yang holds water. Host reversed to guest, guest to host—all is taking Yang from Yin, Yin from Yang. Inverting the Five Phases, cultivating in reverse, one reaches the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the *qi* of the precelestial, undivided state. The Golden Elixir is congealed from Yang fire—not the ordinary fire of the world. The *qi* of the two stirrings is all fire. The two stirrings are their origin: *qi* without form, their source pure and unstained. In years, this is the balance of Yin and Yang at sixteen; in months, the equilibrium of Metal and Water at the crescent and gibbous phases.

Five—
The Tiger leaps, the Dragon soars, winds and waves surge rough.
At the central true position, the mystery pearl is born;
As fruit ripens on the branch, the child matures in the womb.
What difference lies between the Southern and Northern lineages?
The trigrams reverse, the fire times align with the celestial pivot.
Know that the great fish dwells in the marketplace—
Why seek seclusion in the deep mountains?

**Annotation:** This poem speaks of the inner medicine’s symbolic form. The essence of the true One, when manifest in the external, is called the Golden Elixir or true Earth. Swallowed into the belly, it becomes true lead, also named Yang Elixir—this refers to the Tiger as the Golden Elixir. The Dragon is one’s true *qi*, rising from the Sea of Qi like surging waves, moving like the wind. The central true position is the Golden Womb’s divine chamber within the Cinnabar Field, where the elixir gathers. The mystery pearl: when moving the fire, the true essence naturally circulates, ascending from the coccyx, piercing the spine, rushing to the Mud Pill Palace, then descending in droplets to the mouth—each like a sparrow’s egg, sweet and fragrant beyond compare. Called the mystery pearl, when swallowed into the Cinnabar Field, it is named the infant or the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir.

The millet-grain elixir is the *qi* of the precelestial, the essence of the true One congealed—it becomes the mother, the sovereign, the lead. Thus the *Golden Key* calls it black lead or water tiger. The true *qi* of *Si* is postcelestial, becoming the child, the minister, the mercury. Thus the *Golden Key* calls it red lead or fire dragon. The Golden Elixir comes from without; swallowed into the belly, one’s true *qi* surges upward from the lower Sea of Qi like wind and waves, converging upon the elixir—like a minister to a sovereign, a child to a mother, their mutual intent is evident. Dragon and Tiger unite in the divine chamber, the earthen crucible, receiving the fire’s nurturing to congeal the sacred embryo. As fruit must ripen and a child must be born, after ten months of work, the embryo is delivered, the spirit transformed without limit.

South and North refer to the *Zi* and *Wu* hours. Lineage origin refers to the very beginning.

At dawn and dusk begin the day and night. *Zi* is the first of the six yang, thus dawn, governed by the *Zhun* hexagram, the time for advancing fire. *Wu* is the origin of the six yin, thus dusk, governed by the *Meng* hexagram, the time for advancing water. Each day two hexagrams govern the work; by thirty days’ end, the *Jiji* and *Weiji* hexagrams conclude, then begin anew in endless cycle—hence the turning of hexagrams. The *Cantong Qi* says: “At the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* governs; at dusk, *Meng* takes its turn.” Day and night each receive one hexagram, used in sequence. When the month’s end nears, the cycle recommences—this is the way.

Each day two hexagrams preside, with the four hexagrams of *Pin* and *Mou*; in a month, sixty-four hexagrams total, comprising 384 lines, corresponding to the year’s days, including intercalary months. *Qian*’s first nine begins with *Kun*’s first six; *Qian*’s tally is thirty-six lines, totaling 216. *Kun*’s first six begins with *Qian*’s first nine; *Kun*’s tally is twenty-four lines, totaling 144. Together they sum to 360, matching the celestial cycle. The movements of sun and moon—conjunction, ascent, descent—all unfold within the hexagrams’ lines. The moon traverses swiftly, completing one celestial cycle in a month; the sun moves slowly, completing one in a year. The Celestial Pivot is the pole of the Dipper’s handle.

In one day and night, the Dipper completes one revolution; each month, it shifts one position. Thus in the first month, it aligns with *Yin*; in the second, with *Mao*—this is the way. For example, in the first month, aligned with *Yin*: if the sun has not yet passed the palace division, *Yin* is placed at *Hai*, extending to *You*, establishing *Zi*—the first month’s Dipper aligns with *Zi* at the *You* hour. If the sun has passed the palace division, *Yin* is placed at *Xu*, extending to *Yin*, establishing *Wu*—the first month’s Dipper aligns with *Wu* at the *Yin* hour.

The superior adept, the perfected one, comprehends yin and yang above and below, knows the waxing and waning of sun and moon, and the fire tally of *Zi* and *Wu*. Daily, they adjust by day and night; monthly, they respond to the seasons, subtly aligning with celestial degrees, each movement following the Dipper’s alignment—hence the union with the Celestial Pivot. The Celestial Pivot is the Dipper’s pivot. The *Yimen Song* says: “Within the twelve gates, the lunar alignment shifts; the clepsydra’s flow follows time’s turning.” This is its moment.

The marvel of the supreme Dao lies herein: the ascent and descent of *Kan* and *Li* give birth to the numinous medicine, congealing the yellow sprout. For example, in the first month, aligned with *Yin*, *Lichun* occurs at the *Xu* hour, pointing to *Gen*; *Yushui* at the *Xu* hour, pointing to *Yin*—thus it is said: “Each month, always add the *Xu* hour; at each time, behold the Breaking Army.” The great medicine of the Golden Elixir is possessed by every household, yet not bound by marketplace or court. Alas! How many recognize the dragon when they see it, or the tiger? Few indeed reverse course to cultivate it.

In a fleeting moment, a precious pearl forms, large as a millet grain. An ancient poem says:
*“Brought forth, it gleams like rosy clouds upon the palm;
Swallowed, the palaces within the belly are renewed.”*
And again:
*“The great Dao thrives in court and market—
Those in the mountains know not, nor do they care.”*

The commentary says: The Golden Elixir, formed from the primordial *qi*, is completed through the postcelestial *qi* of the human body. The surging of wind and waves describes the body’s *qi* converging with the Golden Elixir. The birth of the dark pearl describes the body’s *qi* uniting with the elixir’s defense.

The *Zi* and *Wu* of the sun follow its passage; the *Zi* and *Wu* of the Dipper follow its initial alignment. These *Zi* and *Wu* are the cardinal directions of earth. Exhaustively applied, they move in tandem with sun and Dipper—this is the true master’s oral transmission. Where the sun aligns, spirit gathers—commonly called the “lunar general.” Where the Dipper points, *qi* stirs—commonly called the “lunar alignment.” Subtly aligning with celestial degrees, using the sun’s *Zi* and *Wu* while following the Dipper’s movement, the Dipper’s *Zi* and *Wu* divide day and night. The moon responds to the seasons, adjusting for waxing and waning. *Zi* generates, *Wu* wanes; south and north refer to *Zi* and *Wu*. Dawn and dusk likewise refer to *Zi* and *Wu*. From *Zi* to *Si* is dawn; from *Wu* to *Hai* is dusk—this is the immortals’ dawn and dusk, not the world’s sunrise and sunset.

Another method: at the solar term’s exchange, add the lunar alignment to *Hai*; at the mid-term’s exchange, add to *Xu*, to determine each time’s alignment. Master Peng, having divided the *Cantong Qi* into chapters and elucidated its true meaning, later read the four lines on the five phases’ inversion and disorderly movement, revealing the mechanism of heaven and earth’s mutual use and the Dao of yin and yang’s return. Thus he composed the *Black Lead and Fire Tiger Treatise* and the *Red Lead and Fire Dragon Formula*, naming them *The Inner Image of the Returned Elixir* and *The Golden Key*. His discussions of the tiger’s essence and the dragon’s function both concern the great elixir’s transformations. Now, the Nameless One borrows these to distinguish the inner and outer elixirs, adopting the titles but not the texts. Though not the work of the True Unity Master, the principles remain coherent.

All people inherently possess the medicine of long life, yet in delusion, they cast it away. When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite, and the yellow sprout is born where *Kan* and *Li* intersect. The well frog claims no dragon’s cave; the wren on the fence knows not the phoenix’s nest. When the elixir ripens, gold naturally fills the house—why seek herbs or burn thatch?

The commentary says: Sweet dew and yellow sprout are alternate names for the Golden Elixir. Heaven and earth, *Kan* and *Li*, are images of dragon and tiger. When the *qi* of heaven and earth intermingles, sweet dew descends; when the *qi* of *Kan* and *Li* intersects, the yellow sprout is born. The union of dragon and tiger’s paths, the true unity *qi*’s congealment—this supreme treasure is possessed by every household. Yet because it is too near, it is slighted and discarded, unaware that this is the numinous ladder to ascension.

Modern scholars often cling to side doors—non-dual solitary yin, solitary yang, methods where the center generates, where encounter is easy but completion difficult—and thus err in their own bodies. They know not that this Dao is simple and easily accomplished, like the well’s frog or the fence’s sparrow—how could they know of dragon caves or phoenix nests?

The millet-grain pearl, once suspended, is the gold of heaven and earth, ready to be scooped up. Formerly, Shao Gangzhong was skilled in the arts of the yellow and white; the world called him the Little Huainan Prince. Later, he met the immortal Han Zitao, the Dharma Master, by the water, and served him as a disciple. He presented a hundred *yi* of mercury and gold as tribute, but Tao merely smiled and paid no heed. Shao then swore a blood oath, and Tao finally transmitted the teaching.

Upon completion, Tao took a handful of mercury, rinsed his mouth with it, and spat it into a water basin. The water surged and boiled, then settled into a lump of purple gold—demonstrating the inner elixir’s great medicine, possessing such divine marvels. How could one see this through years of toiling with herbs or burning thatch?

The scripture does not say: “The earth’s treasury releases its form as gold and jade dew”—this is further proof.

The commentary says: Lü Chunyang turned mud, tiles, and stones into gold; the Southern Tang’s Geng Xian’gu molded snow into silver; Chen Niuwan dried mercury instantly. The *Transmission of the Dao Collection* says: “In the mouth, mercury can be dried”—all signs of the elixir’s ripening.

The Seventh: Know that the source of the elixir’s production lies solely in the southwest—this is its native land. When lead meets *gui*, it is born and must be swiftly gathered; when gold meets the full moon, it is too distant and unfit for tasting. Return it to the earthen crucible, seal it firmly, then introduce the flowing pearl to pair with it. The medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring the balance of two eights to harmonize. The firing times rely on yin and yang.

The *Western Florescence Scripture* says: “The medicine is born in the west and gathered in *wu-si*.” Harvest it at the proper time, and the work will proceed day by day. The southwest is the *kun* earth, the place where the tiger is born. The *kun* direction is also where the moon is born—thus it is called the native land. The moon is the essence of metal and water; when the upper and lower *kan* unite, the elixir is formed. Therefore, the true source of the golden elixir’s medicinal materials indeed arises from the *kun* earth.

When lead meets *gui*, the time is *chou*; when gold meets the full moon, the month is *wei*. The moon’s fullness resides in the mouth; the secret of the hour lies in the heart’s transmission. The breath of the celestial cycle is subtle, its count as faint as the dripping of a jade clepsydra—this is the true oral transmission, passed mouth to mouth in strictest secrecy.

Lu Sicheng, in his postscript to the *Awakening to Reality*, says: “Those who transmit these poems often err, mistaking *lead* for *if* and *gold* for *like*, greatly distorting the Elder Immortal’s intent. Lead and gold are the golden elixir itself.” Lu exposed the error to correct the misreading of “fish” for “ru,” yet guarded the source, fearing its spread through written records. We who receive the master’s oral teaching know this well. If not, even within the empty void five *zhang* from the earth, the millet-grain pearl is not easily obtained.

Alas, how many pursue side paths, taking mere facets for lead and gold, gathering at the *gui* hour in the sky—truly child’s play! There are also those who speak of *kun* receiving *gui*, like Ye Wenshu, who deserve only a laugh. The golden elixir requires work to begin at the *gui* day’s *zi* hour—no delay, no passing moment—thus the urgency of gathering. Once the full moon recedes, the *wei* qi wanes, making it unfit for tasting.

On the *gui* day, the hidden time is *ren-zi*, with *tian-ren* and *di-gui* converging in the north. Thus, the *Zhu Zhen Yi Commentary* says: “At the dark of the moon, at dawn, the *kan* moon and *li* sun unite at *ren-gui*. The *kan* moon is *wu*; the *li* sun is *si*. At dusk on the third day, the *zhen* image appears as the moon emerges at *geng*; on the eighth day, the *dui* image appears as the moon manifests at *ding*; on the fifteenth, the *qian* image appears as the moon waxes at *jia-ren*; at dawn on the sixteenth, the *xun* image appears as the moon wanes at *xin*; on the twenty-third, the *gen* image appears as the moon diminishes at *bing*; on the thirtieth, the *kun* image appears as the moon vanishes at *yi*, hiding *gui*. At the dark of the moon, at dawn, the *kan* water of the moon flows to *wu*; at noon, the *li* fire of the sun reaches *si*. This is the crucial celestial mechanism—it must be transmitted orally, for it cannot be conveyed in writing. Without a true master, one merely guesses and forces interpretations.

Ingest the elixir into the *dantian*, within the earthen crucible, sealing the embryo to prevent leakage. Circulate the fire-dragon’s flowing-pearl mercury to pair with it, and the sacred embryo will form. The raven’s liver weighs eight *liang*; the hare’s marrow, half a *jin*—together they make sixteen *liang*, hence “the medicine weighs one *jin*, requiring the balance of two eights.” The fire is not truly fire but borrows the harmonized operation of yin and yang’s two qi.

The commentary says: When people gather at the time of *gui*’s birth, some take *tian-gui*, others hide the *gui* hour—how can they know the secret of *Awakening to Reality*? “The time is *chou*” means the hour has passed; “the month is *wei*” means the day has passed. Once day and hour pass, the lead’s breath fades, the gold’s fullness wanes—gathering yields nothing, tasting brings no effect. The *Book of Changes* says: “Water flows to the damp; fire seeks the dry.” Flowing and seeking are the natures of water and fire. *Wu-si* is the earth between water and fire; water flows and fire seeks, both embracing *wu-si* to generate *ren-gui*. *Ren-gui* is where the sun and moon conceal their function; *wu-si* is where they display their brilliance. *Ren-gui* encircle *zi*; *xu* and *ji* encircle *wu*. *Zi* and *wu* are the new and full moons—this is the wondrous function of the moon’s soul and spirit, the golden elixir. For details, see the “Small Celestial Cycle” in the first month. Yang is fire; yin is also fire. There is no true fire—it is the essence of heaven, earth, sun, and moon, borrowed and operated.

The Eighth: Do not refine the Three Yellows or Four Spirits; seeking among myriad herbs is even less the true path. When yin and yang attain the proper phase and unite, the two eights balance, naturally merging in the deep pool. The sun at the bottom turns red, dispelling yin’s monstrosities; the moon atop the mountain shines white, sprouting new medicinal shoots. Let people recognize true lead and mercury—they are not common cinnabar or quicksilver.

The Three Yellows and Four Spirits—gold, stone, plants, and wood—are all post-heaven, earth-born dregs. How can they transform the formed into the formless? External things cannot form the embryo; grafting flowers cannot bear fruit. The true One’s *qi* arises before heaven and earth, vast and unfathomable. When the two eights in proper phase unite, they merge in the intimate, steaming union of attraction, stirring into manifestation. “Proper phase” means the emotionless emotion, the colorless color—precisely the raven’s liver of eight *liang* and the hare’s marrow of half a *jin*. When these two eights in proper phase unite and merge, the true One’s *qi* returns to the cavity of attraction, congealing into a millet-grain pearl—this is the marvel of the Dao.

The deep pool is yin; the sun is yang.

At the bottom of the deep pool, the sun glows crimson—this is the yang within yin. The yang within yin is pure yang, devoid of yin *qi*, hence it is called "the vanquishing of yin’s monstrosities." This is the *qi* of the tiger’s essence, termed "red lead," the yang of the mountain. The moon is yin; the moon atop the mountain gleams white—this is the yin within yang. It is the *qi* of the dragon’s essence, the initial stirring of *qi*, thus called "the tender sprout of medicine," termed "black mercury." An ancient song says: "Red lead and black mercury are the great elixir’s head. To merge red into black is true cultivation"—this is what it means.

The sage, using these two substances in a single moment, refines them into a grain of yang elixir within the Northern Sea, blazing like the sun piercing through a curtain. When ingested, it instantly enters the abdomen, and the yin mercury within the self—all the yin and malevolent *qi* of the body—vanishes entirely, just as the dawn sun rises from the Eastern Sea, blazing and illuminating, dispelling all yin’s monstrosities. The yin mercury, from the lower cinnabar field to the peak of the head, newly receives the *qi* of the yang elixir, gradually congealing and sprouting tender new shoots—hence "the tender sprout of medicine." It is like the new moon at dawn, exchanging *qi* with the sun; as the sun sets, it emits a faint glow in the west, at the *geng* earth, resembling the crescent moon—its light fresh and tender, like the tender sprout of medicine. This describes the symbolic forms of the inner and outer medicines.

The *Western Florescence Scripture* says: "The yin within yang is called the *nüwa* maiden; the yang within yin is called the *gong* metal lord." These are the husband and wife within the crucible, the steps to the Purple Palace. Those who awaken to this become immortals before their very eyes; those who remain deluded are separated by ten thousand miles of drifting sand. The true lead and true mercury of the outer medicine are the initial *qi* of the dragon and tiger. The true lead and true mercury within are the golden elixir and the self’s true *qi*. Those of this age who seek to recognize true lead and mercury—only these are real; all else falls short of the supreme Dao. These two true substances can transform the formed into the formless, becoming true immortals. How can ordinary cinnabar and common mercury compare?

A commentary says: The alchemical classics transmitted in the world often extract mercury from cinnabar, calling it "true mercury," or use cinnabar as the "golden body," refining it into an elixir. This wastes wealth and time, with few successes. Even if achieved, many who consume it perish—all because they fail to recognize true lead and true mercury.

Within yang lies yin essence, its substance not firm.
Cultivating this alone only weakens the body.
Breathing exercises and guiding *qi* are not the Way;
Absorbing mist and dining on dawn are but madness.
The world blindly seeks lead and mercury—
When will they witness the dragon and tiger descend?
I urge you to exhaustively seek the source of life,
Return to the root, restore the origin—this is the King of Medicines.

A note says: The yin essence within yang is the self’s true essence. Essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit—nothing is greater for nourishing and defending the body. When the oil is exhausted, the lamp goes out; when the marrow is depleted, the person dies. This shows that essence and *qi* are the root of the body. Yet this substance belongs to yin, its nature not firm—like cinnabar containing mercury, or fire born within wood, its nature prone to flight. Day by day, it is lost through urine, sweat, tears, and saliva, difficult to capture and unwilling to be refined. Thus, the sage called it the "flowing pearl of the great yang," its nature fierce and violent. Without the true One’s yang elixir to restrain it, and the yang fire within yin to nurture it, it cannot congeal and transform. Cultivating this alone only leads to emaciation; guiding *qi* and laboring the body are not the true Way. Absorbing mist and dining on dawn are the acts of madmen. Even if one ingests the essence of the sun and moon, fills the five viscera with light, circulates the twin passes at the spine, replenishes the brain, and returns essence—even if one achieves corpse liberation, womb entry, spirit departure, or deep meditation—all these thousands of methods amount to nothing more than cultivating this single yin essence within yang. A solitary yin without yang is like a hen trying to hatch an egg alone—how can it succeed?

Master Zhongli said: Tears, saliva, fluids, essence, *qi*, blood, and humor—these seven numinous substances are all yin. If one takes these as the basis of the elixir, how can one ascend to the Jade Capital? From this, it is clear that within the body, not only is true essence yin—all five viscera and six bowels are yin, not yang. How can one take the heart and kidneys as *kan* and *li*, the liver and lungs as dragon and tiger? How can one use spirit and *qi* as mother and child, or fluids and saliva as lead and mercury? If one clings to these in cultivating the body, seeking the proof of pure yang, it is like trying to dispel cold by adding ice, or cure dampness with hot water—like making a flying phoenix dance with a snake, only increasing the disorder.

The *Unity of the Three* says:
"Make two maidens dwell together,
Their beauty most fair.
Su Qin’s persuasive words,
Zhang Yi’s matchmaking,
Unbound hair and sharp tongues,
Striving to craft fine speech,
Opening their hearts to harmony,
Becoming husband and wife—
Yet in the end, hair rots and teeth decay,
Never truly knowing one another."

This metaphor speaks of marrying a woman to a woman, refining yin with yin—how can there be a way of generation through attraction? The true dragon and true tiger are the two eights.

The true lead and true mercury are the qi of the dragon and tiger’s two essences. This Dao is most simple, not complex; most near, not distant. Yet scholars cling to perverse obstinacy, taking the medicines of side paths and heterodox ways as lead and mercury, while dismissing the true formulas of the Great Dao as false—deeply lamentable indeed. Thus Master Zhongli said:

*"Seeking immortality without knowing true lead and mercury,
One may read ten thousand volumes of alchemical classics in vain.
Failing to grasp the subtle meaning within,
One slanders true words as empty speech."*

Therefore, the Immortal Elder directly points to the source where lead and mercury arise, where the body is born, where life is established—returning to this root, reverting to this origin. By inverting the practice, the true dragon and true tiger will naturally descend; true lead and true mercury will naturally submit. Apart from the king among medicines, who could attain this?

In recent times, many take sixteen-year-old boys and girls, have them unite and emit essence to form an embryo, calling it "Primordial Embryo Elixir" or "Purple River Vehicle," regarding this as the golden elixir and great medicine. This is like grafting bamboo to the moon—how much farther from the truth could one stray? All that is born of post-heaven, possessing form and substance, is not the supreme medicine. For what lies below form is not the Dao of pre-heaven.

The *Commentary* says: The *Unity of the Three* originally used "flowing pearl of the great yang" as a metaphor for the difficulty of subduing numinous mercury. Now the Nameless One borrows it to illustrate the mercury within the human body—this interpretation also holds. The *Laozi* states: "All things bear yin and embrace yang," for all are formed through yin and yang. Humans and the myriad things are never without yang; why then is the human body regarded entirely as yin? Because it is born of post-heaven, possessing substance. Once substance exists, it is constrained by yin, yang, and the Five Phases, thus becoming yin. Therefore, it cannot transform.

The *Unity of the Three* says: "Things without yin and yang violate heaven and oppose the origin." Master Peng says: "Solitary yin or solitary yang cannot generate on their own." The marvel of external medicine is not without yin. Why then is it called pure yang? Because its qi is obtained from pre-heaven, born without substance. Born without substance, it can transform the formed into the formless, thus converting post-heaven qi into pre-heaven qi, making it pure yang—hence it is called yang.

Someone may ask: "Within yang lies yin essence; if its substance is not firm, it cannot be used. Yet now you speak of nurturing it with yang fire within yin—why?" This is the true fire within the great and small crucibles. The human body, being purely yin, has only the true fire of the primordial sea. If one obtains the yang elixir to restrain it, it will no longer flee. Then, nurturing it with yang fire within yin, the returning elixir can congeal. Thus, yin essence cannot be cultivated alone; it must be cultivated in tandem. Through breath and nurturance, following the fire of the great and small crucibles, returning it to the body, the returning elixir naturally coagulates and transforms.

In the great and small crucibles, it is called "yang fire within yin"; in the human body, it is called "yang essence within yin"; in immortal formulas, it is called "Purple River Vehicle." Not only does it replenish and heal the ailing body, but it truly transforms form and spirit.

*Ten*
Diligently seek the true lead,
Lest time slip by in vain.
Capture the earthly po with cinnabar mercury,
And the heavenly hun will naturally restrain water-metal.
This may be called the Dao’s height—dragons and tigers submit;
One may speak of virtue’s weight—spirits and gods revere.
Already knowing longevity equals heaven and earth,
Afflictions have no cause to arise in the heart.

*Annotation*: True lead is the golden elixir. The earthly po, in external medicine, is the White Tiger; in internal medicine, it is the golden elixir. The heavenly hun, in external medicine, is the Green Dragon; in internal medicine, it is one’s own body. Cinnabar mercury, externally, is the qi of the dragon’s essence; internally, it is one’s own true fluid. Water-metal, externally, is the qi of the tiger’s essence; internally, it is the golden elixir. It is also called "mercury within cinnabar" and "silver within water"—these metaphors illustrate internal and external matters.

The Immortal Elder exhorts practitioners of the true to cultivate the golden elixir to transcend life and death, not to waste their days in vain. Capture the White Tiger to subdue the dragon, and the Green Dragon will naturally restrain the tiger. The two qi intermingle to produce the golden elixir. Once the golden elixir is obtained, swallow it into the abdomen to capture one’s own true qi. One’s own true fluid, longing for the golden elixir, congeals into the sacred embryo. When the true dragon and true tiger within have descended, the dragons and tigers beyond the world will naturally submit. When the internal refinement of spirit and soul, gods and demons, attains sageliness, the gods beyond the world will naturally revere. Apart from those of lofty Dao and profound virtue, who could attain this? The body transforms into pure yang, longevity equals heaven and earth, and one roams carefree beyond the world, at ease among humans. All myriad thoughts dissolve—what afflictions could remain?

*Eleven*
Yellow sprout and white snow are not hard to find,
But the adept must rely on deep virtue and conduct.
The Four Symbols and Five Phases fully depend on earth;
The Three Origins and Eight Trigrams—how could they leave ren?
Refined into numinous substance, few recognize it;
Dissolving yin demons, gods dare not invade.
Wishing to leave secret formulas among humans,
Yet not meeting a single true kindred spirit.

*Annotation*: The qi of the dragon is called "yellow sprout"; the fluid of the tiger is called "white snow." The root of the great medicine truly lies here. The Dao is most simple; the matter is not difficult. Yet without grand merit and great conduct, one cannot encounter a true teacher to transmit the profound mysteries.

The Great Dao originates from emptiness and nothingness, giving birth to the One Qi. The One Qi generates yin and yang—called dragon and tiger. The dragon, wood, generates fire; the tiger, metal, generates water. Wood, fire, metal, and water combine to form the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols unite to form the elixir, whose foundation lies in earth. Earth has no fixed position but flourishes in the four seasons. Without earth in the four seasons, the four sequences cannot proceed, and the myriad things cannot be born. Thus, the Four Symbols and Five Phases fully depend on earth.

*Ren* is water—it is the qi of the true one, called "True One Water." Existing before heaven and earth, it transforms into the yang dragon and yin tiger. Dragon and tiger unite to form the elixir—elixir is earth. Dragon is wood; tiger is metal.

The Three Natures and Three Origins do not depart from the transformations of True One Water. The Eight Trigrams are the qi of the True One—its first transformation becomes Heaven, called *Qian*, the Father; its second transformation becomes Earth, called *Kun*, the Mother. *Qian*, with its yang qi, seeks *Kun*’s yin qi: the first seeking gives birth to the eldest son, *Zhen*; the second seeking gives birth to the middle son, *Kan*; the third seeking gives birth to the youngest son, *Gen*—this is *Qian*’s qi intermingling with *Kun*’s qi to produce the three yang. Then *Kun*, with its yin qi, seeks *Qian*’s yang qi: the first seeking gives birth to the eldest daughter, *Xun*; the second seeking gives birth to the middle daughter, *Li*; the third seeking gives birth to the youngest daughter, *Dui*—this is *Kun*’s qi intermingling with *Qian*’s qi to produce the three yin. These, too, do not depart from the transformations of True One Water. Thus, the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams—how could they depart from *ren*?

Not only the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams do not depart from the essence of the True One. Since the beginning of creation, all that has form and name arises from this and is transformed by it. The True One Master says: The essence of the True One is the Mother of Heaven and Earth, the Root of Yin and Yang, the Origin of Water and Fire, the Ancestor of Sun and Moon, the Source of the Three Powers, the Progenitor of the Five Phases. All things rely upon it to be born and completed; the thousand spirits receive it to manifest joy and sorrow. Even the vast heavens, the deep earth, the grotto-heavens, the sacred mountains, the numinous images, the divine officials, the immortals, the sages, the hosts of wind and rain, darkness and light, spring, summer, autumn, and winter—before any sign appears, none does not arise from this lead qi and undergo transformation.

For the cultivator of the elixir, obtaining True One Water completes all matters. Swallowing the millet of the True One into the five viscera and circulating the fire for ten months refines away all yin, transmuting it into pure yang—the True One Immortal. The yin demons and corpse-worms flee, finding no escape. The Immortal Elder wished to preserve this secret for the world, yet none have been found worthy of its transmission—so vast is the gulf, so far removed from human sentiment.

For those whose good roots are planted and whose numinous bones are endowed, immortality may be hoped for. The endowment of numinous bones and the planting of good roots—these are not merely "one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three," but among the countless billions of births, only those who plant myriad good roots may, upon emerging, drift lightly with the bearing of one who has transcended the dust. Alas! The walking corpses and moving cadavers, with but a single bottle and bowl, would ascend as immortals—yet those who attain immortality are not easily found.

Why not examine your own heart and ask: does it differ from the hearts of the ordinary? Or does it not differ at all?

My immortal arts, too, know no bounds. Yet one must take upon oneself the task of vast transformation and adaptability, standing alone above the age like a crane among chickens. Though others may laugh at me as impractical, I know I am no common mortal. The Red Lord and Red Pine are my friends; Penglai and Fangzhang, my home. Naturally, I have encountered extraordinary men and received the transmission of the supreme Dao, forming bonds with kindred spirits. Once the elixir of a single grain of millet is complete, the immortal elder wishes to leave this untransmitted secret in the world—yet blame not the rarity of those who meet its conditions. How might one find such a person?

The *Shu* says: "Earth" speaks of the ultimate realm of defense. "Ren" speaks of the inception of life. The true and unified water is the qi before form; the true and unified grain of millet is the qi after form. The four images each contain one true earth, and four make five; two and three make five—thus the four images are all earth. Ren is water, born of Heaven’s One. Ren stands at the head of the first yang in the *zi* hour (that is, the end of *hai* and the beginning of *zi*), the origin of generative qi and the forerunner of the five phases. Thus all begins with Ren.

The True One said: The essence of the true and unified alone accomplishes transformation. As stated in the *Golden Key*, all lead and mercury arise from this—it is the numinous water of the true and unified. The twelve [months]: In grasses and trees, yin and yang are equally matched. If either is lacking, no fragrance blooms. First the green leaves, yang, take the lead; then the red flowers, yin, follow. This is the constant Way of daily use, the true source. Yet who knows to return to it?

I say to those who study the Dao: If you do not recognize yin and yang, do not act recklessly.

The *Zhu* says: Before grasses and trees sprout, they contain the purest simplicity. When their shells split, they receive the one qi to germinate. Thus they first send forth a single shoot to symbolize the one qi, then divide into two leaves to symbolize yin and yang. Between the two leaves, a bud emerges to correspond to the Three Powers. Beyond this, they gradually branch out: flowers and leaves flourish, spring brings forth growth and the opening of green leaves, summer fosters expansion and the blooming of red flowers—all driven by yang’s urging. Autumn brings solemnity and fruition, winter brings decay and returns to the soil—all driven by yin’s urging. Yin and yang, equally matched, give rise to endless generation. If either is lacking, the myriad things do not come to be.

Thus the True One said: Solitary yin does not produce; solitary yang does not complete. Therefore, when heaven and earth intermingle in misty union, the myriad things are transformed and harmonized; when male and female unite in essence, the myriad things are generated. The common people take this as their daily constant, yet do not know the true source, the wondrous principle of the reversal and interplay of yin and yang. One who can refine this may transcend life and death. If scholars do not understand this and instead mock me, it is they who are self-deluded.

Not recognizing the reversal within the mysterious, how can one know how to plant lotuses in fire? Leading the White Tiger home to nurture it, one gives birth to a luminous pearl like the full moon. Do not merely guard the elixir furnace and defend the firing times; simply settle the spirit and rest in naturalness. When the host of yin is exhausted, the elixir matures, and one leaps free from the cage to live ten thousand years.

The *Zhu* says: By human affairs, a man cannot become pregnant, nor can lotuses be planted in fire. Yet the wondrous and mysterious Dao of immortals possesses the art of reversal. Thus it can make a man pregnant, just as it can plant lotuses in fire. Why? The sun, *li*, is male but becomes female when reversed; the moon, *kan*, is female but becomes male when reversed—this is the meaning of reversal. When the two are reversed, they can generate the elixir. Refining one’s own yin mercury to form the sacred embryo and nurturing the infant—this is a man becoming pregnant, just as planting lotuses in fire. Is this not reversal?

Thus the immortal elder, reading the *Cantong Qi*, said: "The five phases move in reverse, and the elixir body remains numinous and ever-present." Water reverses to earth, earth to wood, wood to metal, metal to fire, fire to water—this is the subtlety of reversal. The meaning of reversal is clear.

The Green Dragon and White Tiger are originally the essence of the true and unified, transformed into two things, positioned east and west. In reality, they emerge from the same source but bear different names. The essence of the true and unified belongs to mercury, and mercury is the dragon in the east—thus the essence of the true and unified resides in the east. The White Tiger is originally the child of the true and unified’s essence, lodging its body in the west, though its home is in the east. Thus the immortal elder said: "The Metal Duke is originally the son of the eastern family, sent to lodge in the western neighbor. Recognize him, call him home to nurture, and match him with the Alchemical Maiden as kin." The Metal Duke is lead; the Alchemical Maiden is mercury. Using lead to refine one’s own mercury and form the sacred embryo—this is leading the White Tiger home to nurture, matching it with the Green Dragon as husband and wife, giving birth to a luminous pearl like the full moon.

The "full moon" refers to the adept of elixir refinement first obtaining the upper *kan* at the western edge, a half-moon of eight ounces of yang metal, then obtaining the lower *li* at the eastern edge, a half-moon of half a catty of yin water. Combining these two half-moons generates the elixir, yielding a single grain of golden elixir like the full moon. This is akin to Master Daoguang’s Chan saying: "A single grain of numinous elixir weighs one catty"—for it is formed by two eight-ounce measures combining into one catty. This analogy pertains to the external medicine’s symbolic form.

After obtaining this elixir and swallowing it into one’s abdomen, the golden elixir becomes the White Tiger. One then leads this White Tiger into one’s abdomen to match it with one’s own mercury. Thereafter, one circulates the yin tally and yang fire through the sixty-four hexagrams, refining it into a single grain of golden liquid return elixir, also weighing one catty and resembling the full moon. This analogy pertains to the internal medicine’s symbolic form.

The internal elixir resembles the full moon because the firing hexagrams—each with six lines, sixty-four hexagrams totaling three hundred eighty-four lines—symbolize one catty and three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. The external elixir resembles the full moon because one catty comprises the two half-moons of the upper and lower *kan*, the number eight, hence its resemblance to the full moon.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "The upper *kan*’s number is eight; the lower *gen*’s is also eight. When the two *kan* unite their essence, the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete. Two eights correspond to one catty." The Dao of the *Yi* is perfectly balanced. Thus the True One said: The upper and lower *kan*’s one-catty measure is divided into three hundred eighty-four *zhu* to operate the fire tally and line numbers.

The immortal elder’s indication of the full moon’s meaning is to enable scholars to thoroughly understand the workings of creation, distinguishing the internal and external two eights’ numbers, which cannot be discussed indiscriminately.

The fire is not the common fire of the human realm—it is the primordial ancestral qi, the qi of yin and yang that makes no sound. Nor is there any elixir to guard; such talk is mere idle chatter. Master Qingxia said: "The crucible is no metal crucible; the furnace is no jade furnace. Fire arises from below *li*; water moves toward the center of *kan*. When the Three Essences are securely joined, the Two Substances naturally bind and solidify. The embryo is sealed, no leakage occurs, and transformation happens in an instant."

Gao Xiangxian said: "Heaven and earth intermingle; male and female unite. The Four Images and Five Phases gather like spokes to a hub. Day and night alternate through *zhun* and *meng*, following nature’s pattern. Diligently tend the fire phases—this is no mundane crucible or furnace, but the fire within the crucible of nature itself. Simply settle the spirit, regulate the breath, and let it unfold naturally. Refine with civil and martial measures, and the tally of time will not err by even a fraction. Within half a watch, the elixir is attained. Then, following this method, advance and retreat with yin tally and yang fire, applying withdrawal and addition to guard against danger and avert peril. After ten months, the work is complete: all yin is stripped away, the body transmutes into pure yang, and one leaps free from the cage of dust, attaining ten thousand years of life. This is the method of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.

Yet this is not yet the ultimate mystery. One must further embrace the One for nine years, returning the essence to spirit, to achieve the Nine-Turn Golden Liquor Great Returned Elixir. At that time, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one merges with the Dao in truth."

The Commentary states: Mercury is the Flowing Pearl of Grand Yang. When it obtains the Golden Flower, it congeals into the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir arises fundamentally from the Flowing Pearl of Grand Yang, and the Flowing Pearl of Grand Yang, in turn, arises from the Azure Dragon of the East—thus it is the son of the East. The Metal Duke is none other than the Golden Elixir, originally the son of the Eastern House. The Flowing Pearl of Grand Yang lodges its form within the Golden Flower of the West to take birth.

Zhang and Sui’s annotations to the *Triple Concordance Canon* say: A month has thirty days and three hundred sixty hours, which mirror the small crucible and furnace. A year has twelve months, and the hexagrams, qi, seasonal nodes, and fire phases of advance and retreat mirror the great crucible and furnace. Through calculation and agitation, six hundred chapters are composed—this is not the fire of the mundane world. The immortals sigh that common people do not recognize true fire, so they establish the images of hexagrams and lines. Yet the hexagrams are but the trap and snare of fire; once the function of fire is seen, the hexagrams and lines may be forgotten. Master Wu Ming’s commentary is based on this.

Fourteen, three-five-one—these three characters together: truly enlightened ones have been rare through the ages. East three and south two together make five; north one and west four together make five. Wu and Ji naturally return to the generative number five. When the three families meet, the infant is formed. Thus we know that the Great One contains true essence, and after ten months, the embryo is complete, laying the foundation for sagehood.

The commentary states: The "three-five-one" cannot be separated from dragon and tiger. The dragon pertains to wood; wood’s number is three and resides in the east. Wood can generate fire, thus the dragon’s essence pertains to fire. Fire’s number is two and resides in the south. These two things share the same source, so three and two combine to form the singular five. The tiger pertains to metal; metal’s number is four and resides in the west. Metal can generate water, thus the tiger’s lead-qi pertains to water. Water’s number is one and resides in the north. These two things share the same palace, so four and one combine to form the second five. The two fives of these two things meet in the central palace of *wu* and *ji*. The central palace pertains to earth, and earth’s generative number is five—this is the "three-five." When the three and five unite, the elixir is formed; the elixir is the one. Thus it is called "three-five-one." From ancient times to the present, those who can unite the three-five-one to form the elixir and fully comprehend the infant are truly rare. The "one" is the golden elixir; the "infant" is the elixir itself. The elixir is the one, the one is the true qi of the primordial unity, the mother-qi of heaven and earth. One’s true qi is the child-essence of heaven and earth. Drawing the mother-qi inward to the five viscera to subdue the child-essence is like a cat crouching over a mouse to prevent its escape. The qi of mother and child long for each other within the womb, coalescing into the singular infant. Thus it is said: "The Great One contains the true qi," meaning it holds the true essence of the one, just as a person carries a child for ten months before giving birth. The sacred embryo is the same: after ten months of work, it naturally becomes spiritually perfected. Thus it is said: "After ten months, the embryo is complete, laying the foundation for sagehood." Later generations take the kidneys to be the infant—how could they possess such efficacy?

The commentary further states: The numbers one, two, three, four, and five are generative numbers; they are the beginnings of form, yet remain formless. These are not the five phases of the mundane world with tangible qualities, but the qi of heaven and earth in their primordial emptiness. The numbers six, seven, eight, nine, and ten are completion numbers; they possess form and are not the formless five phases of the primordial. These are the five phases of the later heaven. Heaven-one and earth-four combine to make five, and the central five completes ten. Heaven-three and earth-two combine to make five, and the central five completes ten. The two fives pair together, also combining into the celestial number twenty-five. The golden elixir is formed from the five phases of the primordial, so only the generative numbers of the five phases are taken. To regard the kidneys as the infant or the heart as the maiden, to focus on the inner and outer landscapes, or to practice visualization of spirits and deities—these are all yin methods and thus devoid of efficacy.

Fifteen.
Not recognizing true lead as the true ancestor,
A thousand efforts are wasted in vain.
Resting wives and recklessly severing yin and yang,
The grains are merely left to empty the intestines.
Herbs, trees, gold, and silver—all are mere dregs;
Clouds, mist, sun, and moon—all are but illusions.
Even with breath-work and visualization,
None align with the work of the golden elixir.

The commentary states: The essential point of true lead lies in taking the qi of the two eights as its foundation; all else is not the supreme Dao and wastes effort. The *Breaking Delusion Song* of Yimen says:
*"Solitary yin is not the Way;
Yin and yang lose their proper place."*
Master Wang Zhenren says: "Disciples must first part from wives and concubines, for without non-action, there is nothing that cannot be done." Gao Xiangxian says:
*"Sometimes yang, solitary and roosting;
Sometimes yin, dwelling alone."*
These words all refer to the meaning of solitary yin and widowed yang, the cultivation of a single thing. Some, not understanding, cling to this saying and practice the bedchamber arts of controlling women, slandering the immortal Dao. Who shall bear the blame? They do not know that this speaks of the metaphor of yang as husband and yin as wife—it is not the husband and wife of the human world. The *Breaking Delusion Song* says:
*"Abandoning grains is not the Way;
After death, one becomes a hungry ghost."*
All the above—post-heavenly, earth-born, impure dregs—are easily encountered yet difficult to perfect. How can they be mentioned in the same breath as the great medicine of the golden elixir?

The commentary further states: Methods such as abandoning grains, breath-work, and visualization are all side doors followed by vulgar scholars. Many, seeing the phrase "not abandoning wives," mistakenly take the arts of gathering yin as the golden elixir. Why do they not thoroughly investigate the *Breaking Delusion Song* of the Great White Immortal?
*"Practicing qi is not the Way;
Saliva is not divine water.
Visualization is not the Way;
A painted cake cannot be eaten.
Gathering yin is not the Way;
Essence exhausted, life follows in death.
Cutting salt is not the Way;
Food and drink lose their savor.
Abandoning grains is not the Way;
Hunger and weakness harm the spleen and stomach.
Resting wives is not the Way;
Yin and yang lose their proper place."*
What, then, *is* the Way? The Great One contains the true qi. Qi interacts yet does not interact; its ascent and descent emulate heaven and earth. The two things pair and unite, arising from the primordial. The maiden and the infant match, completing the *jiji*. This is the true yin and yang, husband and wife sharing a single principle. Thus, there is no need to abandon them. How can solitary yang accomplish the task of transcending the world to become a golden immortal? The golden elixir is not easily attained. Noble scholars do not speak of the true and profound meaning of the Great Cavern. The five phases do not follow their usual course: the tiger is born from water, the five phases are inverted, and the dragon emerges from fire. These words are truly wondrous, for they are the power of the Great One. The rhymed verses of the Immortal Elder are ultimately based on this.

The *Breaking Delusion Song* of Yimen says:
*"The Great One contains the true qi;
The dragon is born from fire,
The tiger arises from water.
Knowing the inversion of yin and yang,
It originates from the primordial.
The five phases do not follow their course,
Yet return to be one with heaven and earth."*
The meaning of "resting wives" does not approach the clarity of the *Song of the Great One*. Since people do not understand the inversion of the five phases, how can they know that true yin and yang require no abandonment? Those who study immortality, unable to fully comprehend the titles and terms in the books of immortals, how can they thoroughly ponder the entire text and merge it into a single principle? Thus, the great Way of the golden elixir has faded with the ages, and the Dao has become obscured as human nature dims. How could it be due to the mistaken interpretation of "resting wives" and "recklessly severing yin and yang" as referring to the bedchamber arts of human couples? What a pity! When the elixir is complete and qi is full, one naturally abstains from grains—not like consuming black beans, sesame seeds, or other medicinal foods to survive famine. Some use medicinal elixirs to practice grain avoidance, spreading their methods in the world, but how can they become immortals of pure yang? There are those who rely solely on herbs and plants; even if they attain longevity, they are not of the pure yang substance.

Sixteen.
The myriad scrolls of immortal scriptures,
Their words all converge on the golden elixir—
This alone is the root and origin.
Follow the Kun position to give birth to the body,
Plant the seed in the Qian household, the palace of intercourse.
Do not blame the celestial mechanism for being fully revealed;
It is only because scholars are foolish and guarded.
If one understands the meaning within this poem,
They will immediately behold the Three Pure Ones.

The commentary states: The myriad scrolls of immortal scriptures, though vast, ultimately return to one truth—none do not take the initial qi of the dragon and tiger, the two eights, as the substance of the elixir. However, by following the principle of the Kun mother giving birth and reversing the process to cultivate it, after obtaining the elixir, the seed is planted in the Qian father’s palace of intercourse to circulate the fire. The essentials of elixir refinement do not extend beyond the two words: lead and fire. Lead and fire are the foundation of the great elixir. The Immortal Elder has revealed the celestial mechanism in its entirety. Scholars, even with hoary heads, remain confused and guarded. Why do they not draw near and seek it within themselves to illuminate the supreme Dao? When a single grain of millet is formed, it becomes the guest of heaven.

The Commentary states: Master Cui’s *Mirror for Taking Medicines* says, “Born in Kun, planted in Qian”—this is it. Born in Kun is the precelestial external medicine; planted in Qian is the postcelestial qi internal medicine. The principle of the Kun mother’s generation: the Kun position is the southwest, where the moon emerges from Geng, and metal and water give birth to the two eights’ wondrous workings—this is “born in Kun.” The Qian father’s palace of intercourse is the Central Palace, the Northern Sea, just as Qian lies in the northwest. Ingesting the elixir within, lead and mercury interact to transform and evolve—this is “planted in Qian.” Lead is the White Tiger; fire is the Green Dragon. The White Tiger’s qi is lead, which is also water. The Green Dragon’s qi is fire, yet not ordinary fire. Lead is the essence of the moon, born of water and completed in metal, possessing both substance and qi—the root of heaven and earth’s wondrous transformations. Fire is the essence of the sun, born of wood and restrained by metal, possessing qi but no substance—the origin of heaven and earth’s generation. Thus it is said: the essentials of elixir refinement, the foundation of the great elixir, do not extend beyond lead and fire.

**Five-character quatrain (to emulate the oddness of the Great One):**
The maiden dons azure robes,
The young lord wraps in white silk.
Seen, it cannot be used;
Used, it cannot be seen.
In the midst of vagueness they meet,
Within the obscure, change occurs.
In a flash, flames soar—
The true person naturally appears.

The Commentary states: The maiden is the qi and essence of the Dragon.

Within yang there is yin—thus she is called the maiden, also named Wood Maiden, born of the Azure Dragon, hence her azure robes. Within yin there is yang—thus he is called the young lord, also named Metal Lord, born of the White Tiger, hence his white silk. That which possesses substance and can be seen belongs to the turbid things of post-heavenly earthly generation; because it has substance, it can be seen but cannot be used. That which has no form to behold is the primordial qi of the Dragon and Tiger’s first dual eight; because it has qi but no substance, it cannot be seen but can be used—this is the pivotal mechanism of lead refinement.

The vague and indistinct, the obscure and subtle, are the true unified qi of the Primordial Origin, born before heaven and earth, beyond all measure. Within the vague there is something: the Dragon’s qi. Within the obscure there is essence: the Tiger’s qi. The two qi reside in the midst of vagueness and obscurity, intermingling and embracing, thus obtaining the true unified qi, which first manifests as a spirit-like transformation and becomes a grain-like pearl—this is the wonder of something arising from nothing.

The true person is the golden elixir. When the sage gathers a year’s fire timing into a single hour, and further divides that hour into six intervals, first applying the fire in the two intervals to forge and refine, the true unified qi coalesces into a single pearl, appearing in the Northern Sea, as large as a millet grain. Is this not the true person emerging naturally in a flash of fire?

This Dao is most wondrous and profound. Without encountering a true master to transmit the oral instructions and true method, who could attain this?

The Commentary states: The immortal elder composed this five-character quatrain to represent the five phases and four images forming a single millet-like pearl. Though the elixir is transformed from the true unified qi, without the Dragon and Tiger’s two qi intermingling, it could not be formed. This is because the Dragon and Tiger together with the two qi make the four images. The four images interact within the Central Palace to form the elixir—earth, the true five phases. As the Old Master said: “The five phases are the medicine; the four images cannot be lacking.” Thus, the five phases and four images combine to form the elixir, which is why the immortal elder said: “A five-character quatrain to emulate the oddness of the Great One.”

The *Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*: *Annotations and Subcommentaries on the Wuzhen Pian*, Scroll Middle

By Zhang Boduan of the Song Dynasty
Annotated by Weng Baoguang
Subcommentary by Dai Qizong of the Yuan Dynasty

Sixty-four seven-character quatrains to emulate the sixty-four hexagrams of the eight eights. First, take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel; next, employ the Crow and Hare as the medicine for refinement. Once the two substances are driven into the Yellow Path, how could the golden elixir fail to take form?

**Annotation:** The sun and moon are fundamentally the essence of Qian and Kun, hence the sage uses Qian and Kun as metaphors for the crucible and vessel, and the sun and moon as metaphors for the medicinal substances. Qian and Kun are the true Dragon and true Tiger; the medicinal substances are the crescent qi of the Dragon and Tiger. The Perfected Wei said: “The crucible is fundamentally no crucible; the medicine is fundamentally no medicine.” The sage borrows names and relies on images as metaphors. In essence, it is only through the intermingling of the true Dragon and true Tiger’s initial crescent qi, congealing the essence of the true One within the Central Palace of the Northern Sea, that the two substances are driven into the Yellow Path, and the golden elixir takes form without fail. The Yellow Path is the Central Palace, the place where the golden elixir congeals and takes shape.

**Subcommentary:** The immortal classics compare Qian and Kun to the crucible and vessel, and Kan and Li to the medicinal substances. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li as crucible, vessel, and medicinal substances are ultimately formless and nameless. They are but the true Dragon and true Tiger of Qian and Kun—this refers to the external Dragon and Tiger of the golden elixir. The *Cantong Qi* annotated by Perfected Peng states: “Kan’s wu is the essence of the moon, resembling metal born in water—the Tiger. Li’s si is the radiance of the sun, resembling wood born in fire—the Dragon.” These are the internal Dragon and Tiger of the golden elixir. Though their names and forms differ, all are metaphors. If the two substances can return to the Yellow Path, they will naturally intermingle and form the elixir. If one stubbornly insists on distinguishing which is the fixed form of the Dragon or Tiger, the only concern is failing to recognize the Yellow Path’s role as the mediator.

**II. Establishing the Crucible and Setting the Vessel**
The method of forging Qian and Kun refines the essence and brilliance, restraining the po and hun. Gathering and dispersing, the qi intermingles to transform—how dare one idly discuss such profound wonders?

**Annotation:** Accumulating all yang qi forms Heaven, which remains above without descending to moisten below; accumulating all yin qi forms Earth, which remains below without rising to scorch above—this is the non-interaction of Heaven and Earth. If they do not interact, how could they generate the myriad things?

For though Heaven is the utmost yang entity, it contains within it a single strand of yin qi—thus it can descend to Earth; though Earth is the utmost yin entity, it contains within it a single strand of yang qi—thus it can ascend to Heaven. The intermingling of these two qi gives rise to the myriad things, transforming them to purity. This is how the interaction of the two qi brings about transformation. The Dao of the golden elixir, in establishing the crucible and setting the vessel to refine essence and brilliance and restrain the hun and po, takes no model other than Heaven and Earth.

The *Mother-Child Song* says:
*"When essence meets, no medicine is needed;
When qi conjoins, no words are spoken."*
The golden elixir is formed by the union of qi and mercury—thus it is said: *"Only when medicine encounters qi and mercury does it take shape."*

It begins with nothing giving rise to something, then returns to something giving rise to nothing. Though formless, it can transform—hence its transformations are inexhaustible. This is the celestial mechanism; how dare one idly prattle and risk the transgression of careless leakage?

**Annotation:** *"It begins with nothing giving rise to something"* refers to the external medicine, which relies on the true unity of the formless qi—from no substance, substance is born. It is not a case of *"something giving rise to something,"* where a material object is used as the basis. *"Then returns to something giving rise to nothing"* refers to the internal medicine, which, once the external medicine has taken shape, is swallowed into the five viscera, where the tangible forms of the four limbs and hundred bones are transmuted into qi. *"Though formless, it can transform"* means that once the internal and external have completed their transmutation, qi is refined into spirit, and embracing the origin for nine years, one enters the formless and undergoes unfathomable transformation. If one can comprehend the supreme Dao within nothingness, then gradual transmutation becomes possible.

**III.**
Do not cling to the elixir furnace and waste effort—
To refine the medicine, seek the recumbent-moon crucible.
Within it lies the true fire of Nature;
Why need kindling or breath to fan it?

**Commentary:**
Master Ye Wenshu designates the space between the two kidneys as the "recumbent-moon crucible"—how mistaken! Others point to the two eyes, yet none reflect on their own errors, instead leading others further astray. Why such extreme misguidance? The mouth of this crucible opens upward like a recumbent moon, hence its name. It is the Northern Sea, where the primordial ancestor of the original beginning abides. Within it lies the true fire of Nature; why rely on kindling or breath to fan it?

**Exegesis:**
The jade bud grows within the recumbent-moon crucible—this is the external medicine of the yin crucible. Here, it is the internal medicine of the Northern Sea. Both are metaphors, repeatedly inverted and reversed. Without a luminous teacher, one may cling to these names and fail to grasp their coherence, making the profound Dao difficult to attain. The true fire of Nature is seized from the great and small crucibles and returned to the body to produce the golden liquid and reverted elixir, which is not the yin within the body.

**IV.**
Within the recumbent-moon crucible, the jade bud grows;
In the cinnabar tripod, mercury lies level.
Only when fire and force harmonize
Does the yellow sprout take root and gradually flourish.

**Commentary:**
The recumbent-moon crucible is the yin crucible, containing the yang of the jade bud—the *qi* of the tiger. The cinnabar tripod is the yang crucible, containing the yin *qi* of mercury—the *qi* of the dragon. The golden elixir arises solely from the harmonizing and unifying power of these two *qi*. The true sprout of the One is planted, growing within the yellow household to form the millet pearl.

**V.**
Swallowing saliva and absorbing *qi*—only when one acts with substance
Can the myriad things be born.
If the crucible lacks the true seed,
Boiling water and fire is like cooking an empty pot.

**Commentary:**
What the world calls "swallowing saliva and absorbing *qi*" refers to the postnatal, earth-born, utmost-yin substances—this is not true *qi*-absorption. True *qi*-absorption first subdues and then absorbs. As the classic states: *"Subdue the *qi* before absorbing it; to absorb *qi*, one must first subdue it. Absorbing *qi* does not lead to longevity; longevity requires subduing *qi*."* The true *qi* of the One blends into the dim and indistinct, difficult to seek and see. The sage employs methods to subdue it, thus obtaining essence within the dim and substance within the indistinct. Through transformation and refinement, the elixir is formed and ingested into the cinnabar field, where the myriad things are transmuted and born. Hence, *"only with substance can the myriad things be born."* For it possesses the true seed. Without the true seed, all efforts are labor in vain, like boiling an empty pot with water and fire—what can be achieved? The true seed is true lead.

**Exegesis:**
Directing the golden liquid into the brain, descending from the upper palate to the cinnabar field, is also swallowing saliva. Directing the true *qi* of external yin and yang is also absorbing *qi*. This is not to say that swallowing saliva and absorbing *qi* are wrong, but without the true seed, efforts are futile. Without the true seed, what is swallowed is pure yin essence, and what is absorbed is postnatal *qi*. Lacking the mother *qi* of the postnatal, the true *qi* of heaven and earth’s yin and yang will not cling to and congeal with the child *qi* of the body. *"To subdue"* is like a cat stalking a mouse—restraining and subduing it so it does not move. *"To absorb"* is like a fish swallowing water—what enters cannot be retained. Furthermore: *"To subdue"* is to subdue the *qi* of heaven and earth, congealing it into the elixir. Subduing the *qi* of heaven and earth to form the elixir and swallowing it into the cinnabar field, the postnatal yin and yang, heaven and earth, all return to nurture the golden liquid and reverted elixir, forming the sacred embryo.

**VI.**
To harmonize lead and mercury and form the elixir,
Great and small cause no harm—both realms are preserved.
If you ask what true lead is:
The toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River.

**Commentary:**
Driving the dragon causes the fiery mercury to fly; riding the tiger makes the watery lead flicker. In the midst of their intermingling, transformation occurs—a grain of millet, the *qi* of the prior heaven, is formed. What harm is there? Hence, *"great and small cause no harm—both realms are preserved."* The dragon is great, the tiger small—this is the principle of yang’s nobility and yin’s humility. The golden elixir is formed from the upper and lower crescents of gold and water, called true lead. The toad’s light is the essence of gold and water, belonging to yin. *"Shines all day"* signifies the mutual illumination of the moon and sun, symbolizing the union of yin and yang. The west is the direction of metal; the river is water. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the sage combines the *qi* of gold and water to form the essence of the golden liquid—this is the meaning. The moon’s upper crescent belongs to water, its lower crescent to metal. Thus, the immortal elder takes the west as the direction of metal and the river as the body of water. Yet the moon does not truly shine all day. When the lower crescent moon first appears at dawn on the eastern side, half of its golden light is visible in the south (bing). By noon, it sets in the west (geng). When the upper crescent moon appears at noon on the western side, half of its watery light emerges in the east (jia). By sunset, it ascends to the south (ding). The two half-moons combine to form the full, round light of gold and water, creating the appearance of all-day illumination. This metaphorically represents the union of the *qi* of dragon and tiger to generate the elixir. Hence, *"if you ask what true lead is: the toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River."*

**Exegesis:**
The upper and lower crescents of the moon illuminate the sun by day, taking the utmost purity of gold and water. On the full moon, the moon faces the sun by night, taking the utmost abundance of gold and water. *"Pure"* means having *qi* but no form; *"abundant"* means having form but no form. When pure, the two eights mutually manifest; when abundant, the two eights become one body—thus, the golden elixir is instantly formed. The upper classic states: *"The upper crescent is half a catty of gold."* Here, it says the upper crescent belongs to water. The upper classic states: *"The lower crescent is half a catty of water."* Here, it says the lower crescent belongs to gold. Thus, the upper crescent’s half-catty of gold is the white half without the moon, while the upper crescent’s water is the black half with the moon. White is metal, black is water—hence the alternating terms to reveal that the two *qi* of gold and water each weigh half a catty, forming the wonder of the two eights. The lower crescent is the same. Those who do not understand this wonder may doubt it.

**VII.**
Before refining the reverted elixir, do not retreat to the mountains—
Within those mountains, both inside and out, lead is absent.
This supreme treasure exists in every household,
Yet people of this age fail to recognize it entirely.

**Annotation:**
The dragon does not dwell in the eastern sea, nor the tiger in the western mountains—every household possesses the means to reverse and cultivate it, and the reverted elixir may be hoped for.

**VIII.**
When bamboo splits, one must use bamboo to mend it;
To hatch a chick, one must use an egg.
All else is not of the same kind—vain labor,
Like contending for true lead to match the sage’s mechanism.

**Annotation:**
When a bamboo vessel breaks, can one mend it with metal or wood? It must be mended with bamboo before the vessel is whole again. When a chick is to be hatched, can one use earth or stone to brood it? It must be hatched with an egg before the fledgling is born. Master Tao says: *"When bamboo breaks, bamboo must mend it; when wood splits, wood must repair it. A leaking roof is covered with tiles. When a person declines, the same kind must preside over their cultivation."* If one does not employ the same kind, their efforts are in vain. The *Cantong Qi* states: *"When the same kind is employed, work is easily done; without the proper seed, skill is difficult to apply."* Those who wish to refine and consume the elixir must use the same kind. For humans receive the essence *qi* of Heaven and Earth to gain life. True lead is the mother *qi* of Heaven and Earth, entrusted to things of the same kind to conceive and nurture it. Thus, true lead is the mother *qi*, and one’s true *qi* is the child *qi*—is this not the supreme wonder of the same kind? Therefore, it accords with the profound mechanism of the utmost sage and the great Dao of spontaneity.

**Commentary:**
Master Tao, named Zhi, has a separate record. His *Three Grades of Supreme Medicines* was secretly transmitted to the world. In the first year of Baoli during the reign of Emperor Jingzong of Tang, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, at Siming Mountain’s Damei Peak in Yin County, Mingzhou, Zhejiang, he ascended in broad daylight at the Immortal’s Terrace of Mei Fu. A stele inscription remains below the terrace.

**IX.**
Use lead, yet do not use common lead—
What is used is true lead.
Discard this, for it is the wondrous secret of using lead.
To use lead is not to use it—this is the truth.

**Annotation:**
Common lead is a substance born of the postcelestial world, a turbid and material thing. True lead is the *qi* of the primordial Unity that precedes Heaven and Earth. Now, man’s original yang and true essence scatter and disperse daily, never congealing to form the sacred embryo. Thus, the sage refines true lead, seizes it, and subdues it, causing it to coagulate into cinnabar. Day by day, fire is applied, and mercury is gradually added; as mercury increases, the *qi* of lead gradually dissipates. Lead is drawn out, and mercury is replenished—such is its wonder. After ten months, the fire is complete, and the sixty-four hexagrams conclude. The *qi* of lead ascends and floats away like dust motes in a sunlit window, scattering in fragments. After nine years of embracing the One, the primordial *qi* is exhausted, leaving only a single taste of dry mercury. When lead is spent and mercury desiccated, they transform into the golden liquid of the Great Return Elixir. The body, now purely yang, attains the same lifespan as Heaven. Thus it is said: "Use true lead, then discard it; to use lead is not to use it." Are these words empty?

Hearing the Dao to this point, one should pledge before Heaven, saying: "The grace of the teacher is hard to repay; I shall attain the Dao to requite it. To betray the teacher’s words is to betray Heaven and Earth."

**X.**
Empty the heart and fill the belly—both meanings run deep.
Yet to empty the heart, one must first know the heart.
Better to refine lead and fill the belly first,
Then guard the hall brimming with gold.

**Annotation:**
Mercury is essence. Guarding mercury to fill the belly brings a hall overflowing with gold and jade. The One is the Elixir. Embracing the One to empty the heart leaves not a speck of dust. When the heart is empty, the form cannot long endure—one must refine lead to restrain it. When the belly is full, the heart must not cling—one must embrace the One to empty it. To fill the belly, first refine lead to control mercury; when mercury is desiccated and form transformed, then embrace the One to empty the heart. With the heart empty and form wondrous, one merges with the Dao, becoming one with the formless.

Both principles are marvelous, though their paths differ, they converge as one. None but the utmost sage can comprehend this. The "hall brimming with gold" is the essence and *qi* of the entire body. The cultivator of truth, desiring to refine lead to fill the belly, must not disturb their essence. If essence is scant, the Return Elixir cannot be completed.

**Commentary:**
"When the heart is empty" refers to one who has completed *xing* (nature) yet cannot stabilize form—thus, they must refine lead to restrain it. "When the belly is full" refers to one who has completed *ming* (life-destiny) yet cannot empty the heart—thus, they must embrace the One to empty it. *Xing* and *ming* are cultivated in sequence; only when both are complete can they fuse, merging with the Dao in truth. How could one confuse *xing* and *ming* as one, clinging to partial views through the Chan of hearsay or the arts of side doors?

**XI.**
In a dream, I paid homage to Xihua,
And the Perfected of the Nine Heavens bestowed upon me the *Zhigao* Scroll.
Its words were few and simple,
Only teaching men to refine mercury and lead.

**Annotation:**
Gao Xiangxian said: Suddenly, my soul ascended to the Jade Capital, where the Emperor took pity on me and commanded the Perfected of Xihua to instruct me in the elixir’s secrets. The scroll’s gist reads: "Shutong followed Wei Boyang, laughing as they entered the land of nothingness. They composed the *Cantong Qi*, leaving it as the king of elixirs for ten thousand ages. Its opening says: ‘Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*; the Dao of Qian becomes male, the Dao of Kun becomes female.’ Yet people do not recognize true yin and yang, blindly seeking dragon and tiger across the world. Its words are many, but it only teaches men to clarify true dragon and true tiger, refining lead and mercury."

Shutong’s surname was Chunyu.

**Commentary:**
The *Zhigao* Scroll is written in elegant and ancient script, focusing solely on lead and mercury. The passage quoted here is from Gao Xiangxian’s song. Its marvels are distilled below, revealing the path to enlightenment, akin to the *Zhigao* Scroll and the song itself. The song says:

The Yellow Emperor sought the Dao in Kongtong’s chamber,
First obtaining the *Gang* of the Mysterious.
Yet still incomplete, he turned to Shu,
Visiting Emei to seek the Heavenly Perfected.
The August Person and True Unity—none surpass
Knocking at the gate of Wuji.
Within Wuji’s gate lies metal and water;
Metal and water are the root of the Yellow Sprout.
The Yellow Sprout, mother of all things,
With child, becomes the cauldron and furnace.
When the sun’s soul and moon’s essence intertwine,
One floats, one sinks—pearls take flight.
The pearl flies to Kunlun’s peak;
To obtain it, rely on Wangxiang.
Wangxiang gains it and returns to the Crimson Palace,
Where it steams into the flesh, reddening the skin.
Reddened skin, blackened hair—
The Northern Dipper falls, death’s register erased.
Great indeed! Ninety days to completion,
Echoing the traces left at Mount Fang.
Have you not seen Shutong follow Wei Boyang,
Laughing as they entered the land of nothingness?
They composed the *Cantong Qi*,
Leaving it as the king of elixirs for ten thousand ages.
Its opening says: "Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*;
The Dao of Qian is male, the Dao of Kun is female."
Yet people do not recognize true yin and yang,
Blindly seeking dragon and tiger across the world.
The sun is *Li*, the moon is *Kan*;
Sun and moon, yin and yang, devour each other.
When the golden crow dies, the jade hare is born—
All things arise from Heaven and Earth’s interaction,
The two *qi* in harmonious union.
Male and female unite, the four images and five phases
Rely on the hub’s convergence.
Day and night, *Zhun* and *Meng*—such is Nature’s law.
Diligently tend the fire’s timing;
Harvest at the appointed hour, gather at the destined day.
Harvest and gather—be ever discreet.
**[The above quotes the *Zhigao* Scroll to clarify mercury and lead.]**

**XII.**
The Dao arises from emptiness and nothingness,
Giving birth to the One *qi*.
From the One *qi* emerge yin and yang;
Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies.
The Three Bodies give rise to the flourishing of all things.

**Annotation:**
The Dao is fundamentally empty, yet it produces the *qi* of form. *Qi* is fundamentally substantial, yet it manifests as the formless form. Form and formlessness restrain each other, and the One arises therefrom.

Thus, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the *qi* of the center. Before form emerges, the harmonious *qi* is invisible.

Once formed, the light and pure *qi* belongs to yang, while the heavy and turbid *qi* belongs to yin. Thus, yang Heaven is the father, and yin Earth is the mother. The two *qi* intertwine, their passions uniting—this is called Heaven, Earth, and Man, together forming the Three Bodies, known as the Three Powers. From these, the Three Things are born.

Therefore, the *Yi* says: "Heaven and Earth intertwine, and the ten thousand things are transformed into purity; male and female unite in essence, and the ten thousand things are transformed into life." The utmost person delves into this nourishment to know its source, probes its spirit to know its transformations. Thus, they can return to the root and restore the source, inverting the smelting process to reverse creation, plundering the mother *qi* of Heaven and Earth to forge the Elixir, and stealing the essence of yin and yang to fuel the fire. Refining form returns it to the One *qi*; refining *qi* restores it to emptiness and nothingness. Thus, spirit merges with the Dao, attaining the wondrous formless, boundless transformations, unfathomable and profound—this is called the Perfected.

**Commentary:**
The Elixir is the mother *qi*; fire is the essence. The mother *qi* is the undifferentiated essence, while the essence is the already-differentiated mother *qi*. Fire and medicine are one.

The mother *qi* of True Unity is concealed within the yin-yang spirit-essence, invisible and unattainable. Yet by stealing the true essence of yin and yang to seek it, the *qi* of True Unity may be obtained. Shi Xinglin said: "The medicine is the primordial *qi*; the fire seeks the essence of Great Yang. To know the medicine and take the fire is to see the Elixir form within." Wang Dao further said: "Fire is the father and mother of the medicine; the medicine is the child and grandchild of the fire."

The thunder of Kan roars, refining with fire;
Golden Water meets the square flame, igniting Kunlun.
Yin and yang, these two things—
When harmonized, the Elixir ripens naturally,
Fragrance perfusing the entire body.

**Commentary:**
This chapter describes the symbolic method of the inner and outer Elixirs.
The "thunder of Kan" is the fire within water, called yin fire—the *qi* of the Black Tiger at the Mysterious Gate. Here, the Tiger refines with the fire within yin, while the Dragon responds by igniting the fire of Kunlun. When the two fires merge, the essence of True Unity naturally congeals. At once ingested, the hundred bones are ordered, and a wondrous fragrance arises.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
When golden sand enters the five viscera,
Mist scatters like wind and rain,
Steaming and permeating the four limbs.
The complexion becomes radiant,
Gray hair returns to black,
Fallen teeth regrow in their old places.
The old man regains youth,
The aged woman becomes a maiden—
Is this not the true fragrance filling the body?

After ingesting the Elixir, one further circulates the fire of the yin-yang tally.
The Tiger, with the fire within yin, smelts the Mysterious Gate,
While the Dragon, igniting fire at Kunlun, responds.
When the two things harmonize,
The golden essence naturally revolves,
Ascending from the Tail Gate with a resonant sound,
Passing through the spine’s twin passes,
Straight up to the Mud Pill,
Then descending through the Double Towers,
Its flavor sweet and fragrant beyond compare,
Naturally illuminating the entire body.

**Commentary:**
The earlier passage—"the Tiger refines with the fire within yin; the Dragon responds by igniting fire"—refers to the two fires of the inner and outer medicines. Later, "the Tiger refines with the fire within yin" speaks of the fire of the outer medicine, while "the Dragon ignites fire in response" speaks of the fire of the inner medicine. Though the inner and outer Dragon-Tiger fires share the same name, their forms differ. When the two fires merge, the true essence congeals; when the two medicines harmonize, the golden essence revolves. The congealing of true essence forms the outer Golden Elixir; the revolving of golden essence forms the inner Return Elixir. Thus, "fire ignites Kunlun" refers to the Dragon’s fire, further divided into the inner and outer yin and yang.

**Fourteen**
If Li and Kan lack Wu and Ji,
Though they contain the Four Images,
No Elixir forms.
Only because each holds the true Earth,
Does the Golden Elixir achieve return.

**Commentary:**
The *Cantong Qi* states: "Li contains *ji* as the sun’s light; Kan holds *wu* as the moon’s essence." Thus, *ji* in Li resembles the Dragon’s bowstring qi, while *wu* in Kan resembles the Tiger’s bowstring qi. Now, *wu* and *ji* are the true Earth in substance, each residing within the Dragon and Tiger’s bodies—hence the saying, "each holds the true Earth." If Dragon and Tiger lacked Earth, how could the Four Images merge? Only by guarding Earth does the Elixir form. Precisely because each contains the qi of Earth, the two Earths unite to become the *daogui*. Thus, when Dragon and Tiger interact, *wu* and *ji* merge; when *wu* and *ji* unite as one, the Four Images combine to form the Elixir. This is why the Golden Elixir achieves return. As Master Lü said: "When the two things guard each other, they become the root of the Dao; when the Five Phases are complete in their guarding, it is called the Elixir."

**Exegesis:**
Li is yang, *ji* is yin. Fire, with Earth as two, generates Heaven as seven, containing five in the center—fire is dark within yet bright without. The Li trigram is hollow within, all yang containing yin. Kan is yin, *wu* is yang. Water, with Heaven as one, generates Earth as six, containing five in the center—water is dark without yet bright within. The Kan trigram is solid within, all yin containing yang. Kan holds metal, Li holds wood, forming the Four Images. Kan flows with *wu*, Li gathers *ji*; each harbors true Earth. When the Four Images merge, *wu* and *ji*—the yin and yang Earths—guard each other to become one, and the Five Phases are complete. Returning to the root and restoring the origin, seven returns and nine reverts, and the Golden Elixir is achieved.

**Fifteen**
The sun resides in Li’s position yet becomes female;
The moon matches Kan’s palace yet turns male.
Do not dismiss the inverted meaning within—
Cease your lofty discourse on mere surface matters.

**Commentary:**
The crow in the sun belongs to yin, hence Li is female; the rabbit in the moon belongs to yang, hence Kan is male. If one does not grasp the marvel of inversion but merely engages in high talk, it is like gazing at the heavens through a tube.

**Exegesis:**
Inversion means not taking yin as yang—this is extracting yang from within yin; not taking yang as yin—this is extracting yin from within yang. Yin as yin and yang as yang is the common course of the world’s constant Dao. Extracting yang from yin and yin from yang is the reverse movement—the Heavenly mechanism of theft. The Five Phases invert, yin and yang interchange, yet the world rarely understands this. Thus it is said: "When the Five Phases reverse, the Elixir’s body is eternally numinous and enduring." And again: "All is because the child gives birth to the mother." Among all the world’s rabbits, only the moon’s rabbit is male; gazing at the moon, it conceives—hence the moon’s rabbit belongs to yang.

**Sixteen**
Take the solid center from Kan’s position,
Transform the yin within Li’s palace.
From this, the dry and vigorous body arises—
Hidden potential and soaring leaps all stem from the heart.

**Commentary:**
The Li trigram is yang without and yin within; the Kan trigram is yin without and yang within. Taking the inner yang to replace the inner yin forms the *Qian* trigram. For example, the Golden Elixir is the utmost yang’s essence, called the Yang Elixir, congealed within the Northern Sea. When taken to refine *ji*’s yin mercury, it becomes pure *Qian*, transforming into a purely yang body. Thereafter, the firing process—withdrawing and adding, advancing and retreating—is all governed by my heart’s operation. Some consider the *guidan* to be the yang within Kan, but this is a post-Heaven, Earth-born turbid substance, not the pre-Heaven, Earth-born qi. To equate heart and kidneys with Kan and Li is to stray far from Heaven and Earth.

**Exegesis:**
"Hidden potential and soaring leaps" describe the six lines of *Qian*, illustrating the firing process—withdrawing and adding, advancing and retreating—suddenly swift, like the *Cantong Qi*’s forty-seventh chapter, where the six lines of *Qian* are distributed among the six trigrams as symbols for the six stages. The *guidan* involves absorbing the wife’s *gui*, plucking the maiden’s flower, or extracting the qi of boys and girls—all post-Heaven, Earth-born turbid substances. Though human qi may be pure, it is still yin vapor; how can it refine a purely yin body into a purely yang immortal? Those who claim "using humans to supplement humans" as the same qi do not understand that Heaven and Earth’s commander is our nature, Heaven and Earth’s blockage is our body. At the moment of receiving qi at birth, was it from between the two kidneys or the birth gate? The Heavenly-Earthly numinous root, the yin-yang sagely mother, is the foundation of transformation—this is the same qi.

**Seventeen**
The Thunder Dragon’s mercury emerges from Li’s homeland;
The Marsh Tiger’s metal is born in Kan’s domain.
Both things arise because the child gives birth to the mother—
The Five Phases complete, they must enter the center.

**Commentary:**
Mercury is the Thunder Dragon, belonging to wood; wood generates fire, wood is fire’s mother, fire is wood’s child—this is the common course of the constant Dao. Yet cinnabar belongs to fire, and mercury emerges from cinnabar—this is fire returning to generate wood, hence "the child gives birth to the mother." As the *Taibai Immortal*’s song says: "The Five Phases’ inverted art—Dragon emerges from within fire." The Immortal Elder thus speaks of mercury being born in Li, not of mercury born from cinnabar, for mercury within cinnabar is called true mercury, also called fire’s mercury. Thus, he speaks of mercury without mentioning cinnabar. Lead is the Marsh Tiger, belonging to metal; metal generates water, metal is water’s mother, water is metal’s child—this is the common course of the constant Dao. Yet black lead belongs to water, and silver is born from lead—this is water returning to generate metal, hence "the child gives birth to the mother." As the *Taibai Immortal*’s song says: "The Five Phases do not follow the common course—Tiger is born within water." The Immortal Elder thus speaks of lead being born in Kan, not of silver being born, for silver within lead is called true lead, also called water’s lead. Thus, he speaks of lead without mentioning silver. The two things mutually give birth, forming the Four Images; guarding the center, they complete the Five Phases. When the Five Phases unite, the Golden Elixir congeals. Thus it is said: "The Five Phases complete, they must enter the center." The center is the Central Palace, the Supreme Ultimate. Later generations take the heart’s and kidneys’ qi and fluids as Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury—claiming the Tiger is the kidneys’ qi, and since kidneys belong to water, the Tiger is born within water; the Dragon is the heart’s fluid, and since the heart belongs to fire, the Dragon emerges from within fire. Such words are child’s play. How can one hope to refine the Great Medicine without going astray?

**Exegesis:**
Someone asked me: "Those who cultivate life all take the heart and kidneys as Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury, and the qi and fluids as water and fire, hoping for their ascent and descent, union and mating, to form the embryo. Even the *Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao*, compiled by Shi Jianwu, states: 'Within the kidneys, qi is born; within qi, the true one’s water. Within the heart, fluid is born; within fluid, the correct yang’s qi. The Inner Elixir’s medicinal materials emerge from the heart and kidneys, uniting and mating daily to obtain the millet grain, called the Golden Elixir, the Great Medicine.' Yet the preface to the *Wuzhen Pian* says: 'Dividing heart and kidneys as Kan and Li, hoping to congeal the Return Elixir—is this not far off?'"

---

The Master of No-Name, in his commentary on the poem on extracting Kan and Li, states: "To take heart and kidneys as Kan and Li is to place Heaven and Earth far apart." Yet another annotation to this poem says: "To regard the qi and fluids of heart and kidneys as Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury, is child’s play." If so, are the qi and fluids of heart and kidneys not the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir?

I respond: Zhengyang said, "Heart and kidneys are not water and fire"—then what *are* water and fire? Shi Xinglin said, "Qi is born not from the kidneys; the spirit dwells not in the heart." Daoguang said, "Cease your stubborn reliance on heart and kidneys." Chen Niniwan said, "Heart and kidneys are not originally Kan and Li." Yet the *Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao* passes down the teaching of heart and kidneys, qi and fluids, as mother and child, husband and wife, lead and mercury, Dragon and Tiger, Kan and Li—this is but a borrowed metaphor from the human body’s qi and fluids to obliquely illustrate yin and yang and clarify their wondrous function.

The benighted, failing to receive the true transmission, take this as literal speech and thus stray far from the Great Dao. Why not investigate the *Transmission of the Dao*, which states: "Substance and function do not transcend yin and yang; all transformations arise from their union." How profound are these words!

*"When the moon at heaven’s edge shows half its wheel,*
*At early dawn, Dragon’s roar and Tiger’s cry—*
*Then is the time to refine your work.*
*Within the two eights’ single hour, the Elixir is assured."*

The annotation explains: "The moon’s half-wheel is the number of one eight. The Immortal Elder points to Dragon and Tiger as the numbers of one eight each, which together form two eights. At this time, the water’s source is utterly pure, possessing qi but no substance."

Within a year, there is but one day; within a day, but one hour; within an hour, six *hou*—yet the work is accomplished in no more than two *hou*, yielding a single grain of Golden Elixir. The remaining four *hou* serve other wondrous purposes. These are all celestial secrets, not recorded on bamboo or silk, transmitted only orally and mind-to-mind. The Immortal Elder dared not commit them to writing or reveal them openly, but embedded their meaning in poems, speaking obliquely of "the Elixir assured within a single hour."

Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp this principle, misunderstood that the Medicine is completed in one hour—not that one hour alone is used. Bewildered, he lost the true pointer and indulged in private conjecture, which is truly laughable. If one claims it is *not* accomplished in one hour, then the process would drag on indefinitely—how could it remain the simplest and easiest of paths?

Profound and wondrous! This Dao is not something one may hear of in the world of men.

Carefully examining the *Fire Record of the Great Elixir*, it states: "I have observed that when the Sage begins the initial work of crafting the Lead, at the very outset of stealing the primordial qi of the Great Celestial Cycle, they seize the correct tally of thirty-six thousand, gathering it within the cauldron of Qian and Kun, guarding it in the chamber of generation and destruction. They plunder the tally of Heaven and Earth, the tally of the Sun and Moon, the tally of Dragon and Tiger, the tally of generation and completion, the tally of yin and yang, and the tally of the Five Phases—all captured within a single *hou* to refine a single grain of Golden Elixir. Its size is like a millet seed, its weight one *jin*; most numinous, most noble, most sagely, most spiritually efficacious, simplest, and easiest. It becomes the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth, the master governing the body. Truly, it may be called the thief of Heaven, the thief of Earth, the thief of yin, the thief of yang. The cosmos lies within the palm, the myriad transformations arise from the body, and one becomes a perfected immortal, a guest of the Supreme Emperor. Thus, our Immortal Elder said, 'Within a single *hou*, the Elixir is assured'—how could this be empty words? This is its proof."

The commentary states: "The half-wheel is one eight. The upper *cun*’s eight is the yang of Metal; the lower *cun*’s eight is the yin of Wood."

Within a single *hou*, the union of the two eights yields a single grain of Golden Elixir—this is the esoteric transmission of immortals, the profound mechanism of Heaven and Earth, not something mundane scholars may idly speculate upon. Those in the world who employ a single *hou* may follow virtue to unite, or follow the cycles of *wu-ji*, or follow *gui-jia*, or take the lunar establishment, or use the lunar general, or take the direction of the Celestial Dipper, or take the winter solstice, or take the rising of yang, or take the descent of *gui*, or rely on intention reaching the Central Palace, or gather the seven luminaries, or assemble the five phases, or take the five phases’ generative, flourishing, declining, and storing positions, or take *jia-geng* and *bing-ren*, or take the three days and four seasons, or use the living *zi* hour, or use one’s natal hour, or reverse generation, or use the exact center of the sun and moon, or use the sun and moon in mutual opposition, or use the sun and moon in conjunction, or use the hour of heart-kidney union, or take the interval between *hai* and *zi*, or take the earthly *qi* of the three origins, or take the upper and lower *cun*, or take the Eastern Star forming the chamber, or the lunar lodgings on duty, or the establishment of the seven origins—all claim to begin with the *hou* of union. Yet those who practice thus have never attained immortality, for they do not know that within a single *hou* the Elixir is assured. If the Elixir is formed within that single *hou*, why delay its ingestion by extending the timeline?

Nineteen:
On the peak of Mount Hua, the male tiger roars;
In the depths of Fusang Sea, the female dragon hums.
The Yellow Dame daily dissolves their matchmaking,
Sending them to become husband and wife with one heart.

A Commentary states: Mount Hua is the place in the western mountains where the moon emerges, symbolizing the tiger. The male tiger is the *cun* and *qi* of the tiger—yang within yin, hence it is called the male tiger. Fusang is the place in the east where the sun rises, symbolizing the dragon. The female dragon is the *cun* and *qi* of the dragon—yin within yang, hence it is called the female dragon. These two beings are separated, one in the east and one in the west. The matchmaker, the Yellow Dame, causes them to unite and become husband and wife, producing the *xuan* pearl and the yellow sprout.

A Subcommentary states: The *Cantong Qi* says, "The dragon exhales, the tiger inhales"—here, the tiger is the husband and the dragon the wife, their original natures clashing to form male and female. The *Wuzhen Pian* says, "The male tiger and female dragon"—here, the yin and yang of the two beings merge to form male and female. Thus, dragon and tiger alternate as male and female, and this cannot be settled in a single phrase.

Twenty:
On the western mountain, the white tiger rages uncontrollably;
In the eastern sea, the azure dragon cannot be withstood.
Seize them with both hands and make them fight to the death,
Transforming into a sheet of purple-gold frost.

A Commentary states: This speaks of external imagery, as explained in the previous *lüshi* poem. Where the five phases are complete, the tiger and dragon coil within. The purple-gold frost is the golden elixir. Master Haichan said: "With the left hand seize the azure dragon’s head, with the right drag the white tiger’s tail, and in one moment bring them into the mouth to swallow. Reflecting on this, the substance is most sweet—realizing it is merely gold within water." Those who have not heard the supreme Dao may wildly guess, interpreting the two hands as two beasts—how laughable! They stray ever farther from the truth.

Twenty-One:
The red dragon and black tiger, each in west and east,
The four images intertwine; in *wu-si*, union is restored.
From this, one can circulate the golden elixir—
How could the Dao not succeed?

A Commentary states: The east is the azure dragon, wood; wood generates fire, so the dragon’s *xian-qi* belongs to fire. Fire resides in the south and is red, hence it is called the red dragon. The west is the white tiger, metal; metal generates water, so the tiger’s *xian-qi* belongs to water. Water resides in the north and is black, hence it is called the black tiger. The red dragon is also called the "maiden of cinnabar," and the black tiger is also named "Lord Metal." These two are like mercury within cinnabar and silver within lead. When the red dragon and black tiger unite their *xian-qi*, it is the convergence of east, west, south, and north. The four images intertwine within *wu-si*, the true earth, forming a grain of true elixir. Swallowing it into the five viscera, its fragrance steams through the four limbs, entering Kunlun Mountain where the eight waters all come to pay homage. Thereafter, advance the yang fire at *fu*, retreat the yin tally at *gou*, and naturally, in circulation and refinement, every step aligns with the measure. The golden elixir and supreme Dao will be achieved in days.

A Subcommentary states: The dragon’s *cun-qi* is fire; the tiger’s *cun-qi* is water. It is also said: the metal tripod has fire, becoming the white tiger; the jade pool has water, becoming the azure dragon. This is the principle that yin and yang have no fixed position, water and fire no fixed substance—mutually employed, their wondrous transformations are endless.

Twenty-Two:
First observe the heavens to clarify the five thieves;
Next examine the earth to pacify the people.
When the people are at peace and the state is prosperous,
Then seek war—when war ceases, only then can the sage be seen.

A Commentary states: The five thieves in heaven are the five planets; on earth, the five peaks; in humans, the five constants. I say: the five directions in humans are the five viscera; in *qi*, the five natures; in things, the five notes, five phases, five colors, five metals, five grains, five fruits, and five flavors. The *Yinfu Jing* says: "Heaven has five thieves; those who see them prosper. If one can perceive this reversal and cultivate it, then the cosmos is in hand, and the myriad transformations arise from the body."

Observing the earth’s advantages lies in pacifying the people; the people are the root of the state. When the root is firm, the state is at peace, and the nation prospers. Thus, the sage takes the body as the state, cinnabar as the sovereign, fire as the minister, and essence-*qi* as the people. The cultivator of the Elixir, if able to observe the heavens and capture the Five Thieves, reversing their course to refine them, seizing *yin-yang* to return it to transformation, may then wrest the true Unity’s essence and establish one’s own *yin*-mercury as the stem. When essence is firm and *qi* secure, perpetual victory in battle is assured. Thus, in deploying fire without error, after ten months the work is complete, the embryo is shed, and the spirit is transformed into a perfected one—a transcendent. Hence it is said: only after victory in battle can the sage be seen.

Twenty-Three:
In deploying generals, one must divide left and right armies;
Let the other be host, I the guest.
I urge you: when facing battle, do not treat the enemy lightly,
Lest you lose our priceless treasure of the household.

A Commentary states: This chapter clarifies the operation of fire-timing. The "generals" are fire. The left is civil fire, the right martial fire. The sage condenses a year’s fire-timing into a single month, a month’s fire-timing into a single day. From *zi* to *si*, the six double-hours belong to *yang*, resembling the virtue of spring and summer’s generation—thus civil fire, residing on the left, is called *yang*-fire. From *wu* to *hai*, the six double-hours belong to *yin*, resembling the punishment of autumn and winter’s austerity—thus martial fire, residing on the right, is called the *yin*-tally. "Let the other be host, I the guest": the host is *yang* and male, fond of contention; the guest is *yin* and female, fond of stillness. This means guarding the female without contending, maintaining stillness without strife—this is the intent of caution against peril and vigilance against danger, the utmost reverence. The *Art of War* says: "Rest to await the weary," and "Draw the enemy without being drawn"—this is the meaning. The application of the Dao lies in fire; the application of fire lies in the person. Those who deploy fire are like guests before a host: advancing and retreating with reverence, never daring to act recklessly. The adept of fire-deployment must not be ignorant of this.

First, fix the water-clock to divide *zi* and *wu*; next, arrange *yin-yang* to establish the foundation of transformation. Transpose the sixty-four hexagrams onto the *yin*-tally, drum the twenty-four *qi* with *yang*-fire. The celestial gate is in hand, the earth’s axis turns by the heart. The seventy-two seasonal nodes’ crucial passages converge within the crucible, seizing the three thousand six hundred *zheng-qi* to gather like spokes around the embryo. Deployment is methodical, extraction and addition follow sequence. In movement, guard against peril and contemplate danger—no deviation by a hair’s breadth is permitted. Thus, externally, one connects with the tally of *yin-yang*; internally, the body of true Unity is born. If, however, the mind is deployed carelessly and the timing of the nodes is amiss, causing the Maiden to flee and the numinous embryo within the crucible to fail in formation, then the priceless treasure of the Returned Elixir is lost. When facing battle, can the cultivator of the Elixir fail to guard the female and dare to treat the enemy lightly?

An Exegesis states: From *zi* to *si*, the left is civil fire; from *wu* to *hai*, the right is martial fire. The virtue of generation is civil, the punishment of austerity is martial. The *Cantong Qi*’s "Crucible and Vessel Song" says: "Martial at head and tail, civil in the middle." Yet civil and martial are further determined by the waxing and waning of fire-timing. Master Wuming said: "The crucible and vessel are the marrow of the Elixir," hence the simultaneous mention of the "Crucible and Vessel Song" and the civil and martial fire-timing—each has its proper use. This poem clarifies the fire-timing of the inner medicine, not the outer medicine. The marvel of the outer medicine lies in a single moment; the marvel of the inner medicine lies in a day. The fire-timing of a day may seem identical, yet its application differs. From transposing the sixty-four hexagrams to the embryo’s attainment of true Unity, this follows the *Cantong Qi*’s text. The sixty-four hexagrams are not entirely the *yin*-tally, nor are the twenty-four *qi* entirely *yang*-fire—this merely cites the year’s fire-count to complete the text.

Twenty-Four:
Fire is born of wood, its essence conceals its edge—
Do not forcefully drill or recklessly attack.
Disaster arises inevitably from this;
To protect oneself, one must seek restraint and find the Metal Elder.

**Commentary:**
Fire is born of wood, and disaster arises when it overcomes [the wood]. Essence is born of the body, and when emotions stir, it inevitably dissipates. Without restraint in drilling and reckless attack, calamity will harm the self. To protect oneself, one must seek restraint and find the Metal Elder. Lü [Dongbin] said: "When fire erupts from the seven apertures, tightly seal the gates—do not let it burn through the River Chariot’s path."

**Exegesis:**
Fire is born of wood; if one drills excessively, the wood will surely be consumed, reduced to ashes by fire. This is an analogy for the body: fire represents primordial *qi*. If one conceals true *qi* to nourish the body but lightly depletes it, the body will inevitably perish. To restrain the *qi* of the "child" within the body, one must obtain the "mother" of heaven and earth—the Metal Elder—to subdue it. Only then can the root be cultivated, the sacred embryo congealed, and longevity attained, gazing upon the distant ages.

**Twenty-Five**
The Metal Elder is originally the Eastern House’s child,
Sent to dwell in the Western Neighbor’s abode.
Once recognized, call him home to nurture,
Then pair him with the Maiden to wed in affection.

**Commentary:**
This meaning has already been explained in the regulated verse, "Leading the White Tiger home to nurture." The commentary therein reveals that the great elixir of golden cinnabar encompasses all operations. Its symbolic patterns include *yang* within *yin*, and *yang* that is yet *yin*; *yin* within *yang*, and *yin* that is yet *yang*. There are also the *yin-yang* waters and fires of the inner medicine, the *yin-yang* waters and fires of the outer medicine, the three inner natures and three outer natures, the four inner images and five phases, the four outer images and five phases. Furthermore, there are the mutual applications of inner and outer *yin-yang*, their symbolic patterns reversing and repeating in ways beyond description. We disciples, having received the profound transmission in silence and heart-to-heart communion, may grasp it. Without encountering a true master, none can thoroughly comprehend it. The immortal elder composed this poem to elucidate it—having presented one corner, one should attain the rest.

**Exegesis:**
The reversals and repetitions of *yin* and *yang* have been thoroughly detailed in the symbolic patterns of the golden elixir’s methods.

**Twenty-Six**
The Maiden wanders, each with her own direction:
The forward path must be short, the return long.
When she comes back, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,
Marrying the Metal Elder as her old lord.

**Commentary:**
The Maiden is mercury. It is called "mercury fire," and her wanderings follow a direction. The forward path pertains to the outer medicine’s operation; the return pertains to the inner medicine’s operation. These two uses are why it is said, "each with her own direction." When the sage begins the work of refining the elixir, moving the mercury fire does not exceed half an hour before obtaining the essence of true Unity, refining it into a millet grain to swallow. Thus, it is said, "the forward path must be short." After ingesting the elixir, the movement of mercury fire requires ten months of effort—this is what is meant by "the return must be long." The Yellow Dame in the inner image is the golden embryo’s divine chamber. The Metal Elder is true lead; the old lord is the image of pure *yang*. True mercury, driven by the outer fire, flies into the divine chamber to unite with true lead, lovingly merging to transform into a pure *yang* body. Thus, it is said, "marrying the Metal Elder as her old lord." "Coming back" signifies drawing it into the Central Palace.

**Exegesis:**
The fire of the outer medicine is called mercury fire; the fire of the inner medicine is also called mercury fire. In the outer medicine, true lead is born when mercury fire congeals. In the inner medicine, the sacred embryo is born when one’s own mercury fire unites with the outer mercury fire and true lead. Thus, it is collectively called the Maiden, whose wanderings each have their own direction. It is originally a single taste of mercury, circulating throughout the body—mercury is mercury fire.

**Twenty-Seven**
Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the fire-timing, it is as idle as a great city.
All depends on the power of cultivation—
A hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.

**Commentary:**
The creation of the golden elixir entirely depends on Ding Gong. A hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand *li* of deviation. Thus, the sage transmits the medicine but not the fire—it must be discussed in detail with an immortal.

**Exegesis:**
Cinnabar and black lead are not material substances—they are true dragon and true fire. Recognizing them but failing to grasp the fire-timing still does not yield the elixir. The *Daoguang Ci* states: "Three of like mind, be cautious of reckless fire-advancement; the work of fire must be meticulously explained." The *Nihe Poem* says: "Without like-minded companions to correct you, you may fear the fire-timing in the furnace is amiss." Thus, cultivation greatly relies on true friends. If there is even a slight deviation, the elixir cannot form. One must encounter a true master to clarify the great Dao, for the heart-transmission of fire-timing is not recorded in texts. Profound and mysterious, it is a celestial secret—only those with predestined affinity may encounter it and swiftly cultivate it.

**Twenty-Eight**
The *Cantong Qi* and scriptural songs speak of the true,
Yet they do not commit the fire-timing to writing.
To know the oral secrets and penetrate the profound,
You must discuss them in detail with the divine.

**Commentary:**
The fire-timing spans six hundred chapters, each resembling the others, interconnected and aligned with heaven’s measure. What heaven conceals, the sage does not transmit in writing. If you encounter a true master, do not act rashly.

**Exegesis:**
The six hundred chapters of fire-timing use sixty hexagrams for one month, making sixty chapters. Ten months complete six hundred chapters, each resembling the others—day after day, they are the same. Reading the *Cantong Qi* once will make this clear.

**Twenty-Nine**
On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—
This is precisely when metal’s essence is robust.
When the first *yang* arrives at *Fu*,
It is time to advance the fire—do not delay.

**Commentary:**
The fifteenth of the eighth month is when the *qi* of metal and water is flourishing. The *zi* hour is when the first *yang* returns at *Fu*. The fire-work of both outer and inner elixirs must advance simultaneously—do not delay and miss the seasonal node.

**Exegesis:**
The fifteenth is the full moon, the mean. The fourteenth is excessive; the sixteenth is insufficient. Only the full moon attains the mean, which is harmony.

**Thirty**
When the first *yang* stirs, it is time to make the elixir—
The lead cauldron warms, illuminating the curtains.
At the inception of receiving *qi*, it is easily obtained;
In the fire’s withdrawal and addition, beware of danger.

**Commentary:**
The sage, having exhausted spirit and searched the profound, silently knows when the metal essence’s *qi* is flourishing and the first *yang* stirs. Capturing the dragon and seizing the tiger, deploying civil and martial arts, he lures the true *qi* of Great Unity into the lead cauldron’s chamber of mutual resonance. Warmly, it nurtures a millet pearl, its radiance brilliantly piercing the curtains. In less than half an hour, the elixir is obtained—truly, at the inception of receiving *qi*, it is easily gained.

After ingesting the elixir, the movement of *yin* tally and *yang* fire requires ten months of effort. It begins with *Kun*’s thunder, transforms into *Feng*’s layering, rises from dawn, and does not end until dusk. The operations of withdrawal and addition circulate without cease. At this time, one’s emotions are like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes—guarding against danger, fearing peril, and never acting recklessly. Thus, externally, one harmonizes with the *yin-yang* tally and fire; internally, one generates the substance of golden liquid. The circulation never stops: ascending from the *weilü*, reversing to the *niwan*, descending through the *chonglou*, and returning to the Central Palace’s earthen cauldron—this is the golden liquid’s return as the elixir.

The numinous efficacy defies description—how, then, in the operations of withdrawal and addition, could one fail to be vigilant against peril and mindful of danger?

**Commentary:** The *Ruyao Jing* states, "Receiving *qi* is auspicious; guarding the city is inauspicious." This is the caution required. The subsequent return to *Kun* marks the beginning and end of *yin*’s waning and *yang*’s waxing over twelve months. Thunder and wind correspond to the moon’s birth in *Zhen* and its culmination in *Kun*, the six phases of waxing and waning that define its cycle. The hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng* span the twelve hours of a day and the thirty days of a month, concluding the progression of hexagrams and lines—thus, the work of circulating fire aligns with celestial measure.

When the *mysterious pearl* takes form, it follows *yang*’s ascent: as *yang* reaches its peak, *yin* recedes, gradually stripping away the body. By the tenth month, frost descends, and the elixir ripens. At this time, even the spirits must marvel.

**Note:** The *golden liquid returning as elixir* assumes form because, from the Winter Solstice onward, a single *yang* advances, and *yang* fire pursues *yang*’s growth to generate the substance of golden liquid. By the time a single *yin* advances, the stripping away culminates in the tenth month’s frost, when the returning elixir matures, shedding its mortal coil to transform into a being of pure *yang*—how could the spirits not be astonished and submit in awe?

Before the *upper crescent* and after the *lower crescent*, the medicinal flavor is balanced, its *qi*-aspect complete—gather it and return to the furnace for refinement, where gentle nurturing and intense firing proceed.

**Note:** By the thirtieth day of the lunar month, the *yang* soul’s gold is exhausted, and the *yin* spirit’s water fills the wheel, rendering it utterly dark and lightless. This mirrors the hexagram *Kun*, hence the term "darkness." At this time, the moon conjoins the sun during the two days of darkness and new moon, moving in unison, rising and setting together. By the second day, it borrows the sun’s light to conceive, gradually separating until, at sunset on the third day, a crescent appears in the west, *geng* emerging within pure *yin*—a single *yang* light born within the spirit, a soul within the spirit, mirroring the hexagram *Zhen*. At this moment, the *yang* soul’s gold is newly sprouted, the medicinal seedling fresh.

By the eighth day, two *yang* lines appear, mirroring the hexagram *Dui*. Here, the soul within the spirit reaches half, its balance as straight as a plumb line—hence the term *upper crescent*. Before this crescent belongs to *yin*, after it to *yang*; within *yin*, half yields eight ounces of water’s gold, its flavor balanced, its *qi*-aspect complete.

By the fifteenth day, three *yang* lines are complete, mirroring the hexagram *Qian*. Now, the *yin* spirit’s water is exhausted, and the *yang* soul’s gold fills the wheel, forming a perfect circle of pure *yang* without *yin*—hence the term "full moon." As *yang* reaches its peak, *yin* is born: on the sixteenth day, a single *yin* emerges within the pure *yang* wheel, a spirit within the soul, mirroring the hexagram *Xun*. Gradually waning, by the twenty-third day, two *yin* lines appear, mirroring the hexagram *Gen*. Here, the spirit within the soul reaches half, its balance as straight as a plumb line—hence the term *lower crescent*. Before this crescent belongs to *yang*, after it to *yin*; within *yang*, half yields eight ounces of gold’s water, its flavor balanced, its *qi*-aspect complete.

Thus, the sage gathers the essence of this *gold and water of the two eights*, seizing it to return to the furnace of creation, where the true *qi* of the One is refined. Transforming it into a millet grain, it is swallowed into the five viscera, then circulated with fire, gently nurtured and intensely fired to complete the *golden liquid returning as elixir*. This entirely depends on the advance and retreat of *yin* tally and *yang* fire, the withdrawal and addition—if even a hair’s breadth errs, no elixir forms.

The immortal master, in this chapter, repeatedly exhorts those who refine themselves, and not without reason.

**Commentary:** The *two eights* take their form from the moon’s gold and water; the six phases take their form from the moon’s waxing and waning—gold is *yang*, water is *yin*. The *qi* of the two crescents is the fire of *yin* and *yang*. Five days make one phase, completing the number of the Five Agents. "Before the *upper crescent* and after" refers to the period before the *upper crescent* (yin) and after (yang), where gold and water each weigh half a catty—this is the *two eights*. "After the *lower crescent* and before" refers to the period after the *lower crescent* (yang) and before (yin), where gold and water also each weigh half a catty—this, too, is the *two eights*. The *upper* and *lower crescents* are both *two eights*. The sage, using the essence of the *gold and water of the two eights*, gathers from the *upper* and *lower crescents* to obtain the balanced flavor and complete *qi*-aspect of the *two eights*—thus the elixir coalesces.

Many mistakenly fixate on the full moon, but on the full-moon day, the moon is full in *gan-jia*, a full catty of *yang* gold—this subtlety of the *two eights* is known only to those who encounter a true master. The correct method lies in taking eight ounces of gold and water from the *upper* and *lower crescents*, the proper *two eights* for each crescent. Every crescent contains the *mysterious two eights* of gold and water.

The eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the western quarter,
The youngest daughter first blooms the flower of the northern garden.
If the Azure Maiden and the Alchemical Maiden meet thereafter,
At once the lock is sealed within the Yellow House.

Annotation:
*Zhen* is the eldest son, the Azure Dragon; wine is a yin substance, storing yin *qi*—this is called *yin fire*. *Dui* is the youngest daughter, the White Tiger; the flower is a yang substance, storing yang *qi*—this is called *yang fire*. The Azure Maiden and the Alchemical Maiden are called *mercury fire*. These are all terms used by adepts of the elixir: they drive the Dragon to approach the Tiger, and the Tiger, blooming the flower of the northern garden, comes to the Dragon. The Dragon drinks the wine of the western quarter to approach the Tiger. When Dragon and Tiger devour and intertwine, the image begins to form—then the *mercury fire* of the Azure Maiden is set in motion to meet with the three fires of Dragon and Tiger. After their mutual longing, at once it is sealed within the Yellow House of the Central Palace, producing the true unity of essence and forming the *Golden Liquor Returned Elixir*. The Yellow House is the crucible and the *mysterious barrier*.

Exegesis:
The first two lines speak of the *outer medicine*: the Azure Dragon stores yin *qi*, the White Tiger stores yang *qi*. The latter two lines speak of the *inner medicine*: the Azure Maiden is one’s own true *qi*, meeting the two *qi* of Dragon and Tiger in mutual longing, sealed within the Central Palace. Another version’s annotation takes the Azure Maiden as the *qi* of the Dragon’s crescent—this would again be outer, but since the first two lines have already spoken of the eldest son, it should not be repeated, and thus it is deleted. The Immortal Elder’s poem says, *"To bind the Alchemical Maiden in kinship,"* where *Alchemical Maiden* is the same as here. *"The Alchemical Maiden roams, each to their own direction"* further clarifies the inner and outer. Each poem points to different meanings—one must not cling to the names.

In the months of the Hare and the Rooster, when their time arrives,
Punishment and virtue descend at the gate—this is the arrival of the medicine’s image.
Here, the Golden Elixir should be bathed.
If fire is added instead, peril and ruin will surely follow.

**Annotation states:** The second month is governed by virtue, the eighth by punishment—these two months mark the season for bathing. Here, one should cease the fire; if fire is added instead, peril will surely follow, and the Returned Elixir will scatter and be lost.

**Exegesis states:** The present annotation says the second month is for virtue and the eighth for punishment, yet in the *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams, just as they intersect, the myriad things flourish. Another annotation reverses this, calling the second month punishment and the eighth virtue. For in the second month, virtue lies in generation, yet the elm’s pods fall—within virtue, punishment resides. In the eighth month, punishment lies in withering, yet wheat sprouts—within punishment, virtue resides. Thus, punishment and virtue are spoken of interchangeably.

**Thirty-Five**
Sun and moon meet once every thirty days,
Their encounter timed, the day’s method shifts.
Divine work guards the city, battles in the wild—
Know fortune and misfortune, and the numinous cinnabar fills the crucible red.

**Annotation states:** The sun and moon conjoin once each month. The sage, understanding this, adjusts the cycle—one month becomes a day, one day an hour. Guarding the city means bathing and ceasing work; battling in the wild means the dragon and tiger engage in struggle. *Divine work* refers to the measure of advancing fire. If yin and yang are disordered, sun and moon discordant, though the outer fire moves, the inner tally remains still and unresponsive. The adept, advancing or retreating water and fire, knows fortune and misfortune, revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, darkly harmonizing with celestial degrees. Naturally, the numinous embryo silently moves, and the divine crucible glows ever brighter.

**Exegesis states:** "Shifting the day by the hour" means that within each hour, there is a *zi* and *wu*, its yin and yang beginning and end all aligned with heaven, earth, sun, and moon. The handle of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper lies in the *gen* and *yin* positions. Yang fire resides in *zi*, fire in *chou* and *wei* flourishing in the northeast’s *gen* region, not far from *yin*. The moon’s essence also hides in *gen*. The lodging of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper is the position where fire is born—all aligned with celestial degrees. The *Cantong Qi* says, "It begins in the northeast, the region of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper." Revolving rightward forms the third day, the moon born in *zhen* and *geng*. Revolving leftward forms the first month, fire born in *yin*. The hexagram of the month is *Tai*.

---

**Thirty-Six**
As *Pi* and *Tai* just intersect, the myriad things flourish.
*Tun* guards against receiving the hexagram’s mandate of generation and completion.
Within this, grasp the meaning—do not seek images.
If you exhaust the lines, your spirit will be vainly taxed.

**Annotation states:** The winter and summer solstices mark the beginning of one yin and one yang. The *zi* and *wu* hours are the origin of one day and one night. The sage moves yin tally and yang fire, harmonizing with heaven and earth’s ascending and descending Dao, the sun and moon’s coming and going. Gathering the four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four qi, and seventy-two hou, they array them within the crucible to generate the true unity of the body. This principle is simple, its work not cumbersome—nothing can be said of its action. Thus, it is entrusted to hexagrams, divided within a month’s thirty days, to unfold the mysterious mechanism and clarify the fire times. The use of line images is but a net and trap.

*Tun* and *Meng* are the first of the many hexagrams, symbolizing the beginning of fire’s movement, generation, and completion, the source of creation’s endowment. Thus, *Tun* is used at dawn, *Meng* at dusk.

*Pi* and *Tai* represent yin ascending and yang descending within the four seasons. By the second month’s spring equinox, yang qi rises to the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang equally balanced—neither cold nor warm, hence the *Tai* hexagram. This is like the moon’s waxing phase. At this time, yin and yang qi naturally intersect, so the sage does not advance fire—this is called bathing.

By the eighth month’s autumn equinox, yin qi descends to the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang again equally balanced—neither warm nor cold, hence the *Pi* hexagram. This is like the moon’s waning phase. At this time, yin and yang qi naturally intersect, so the sage does not advance water—this too is called bathing. Thus, the Immortal Elder said, *"In the months of the Hare and the Rooster, when their time arrives, punishment and virtue descend at the gate—this is the arrival of the medicine’s image."* The second month is punishment, the eighth virtue.

If the cultivator of the Elixir can grasp the meaning within these four hexagrams, why cling to the many lines and weary the heart with labored thought? The Immortal Elder, in his compassion, directly points to this shortcut.

**Exegesis states:** *Pi* and *Tai* are the bathing months. A year has twelve months; ten are used to gestate the embryo, excluding the two bathing months. *Tun* and *Meng* are the sun and moon’s two hexagrams. The two hexagrams together have twelve lines, symbolizing a day’s twelve hours. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, and the four of the female and male, only sixty are used, corresponding to a month’s thirty days. This reflects the principle of heaven and earth’s 84,000 *li* of ascent and descent. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, exactly 24,000 *li* are traversed, precisely at the center of heaven and earth. Thus, the *Pi* and *Tai* hexagrams, with yin and yang evenly balanced above and below, are borrowed as metaphors.

The day’s hours at the second and eighth months are also evenly balanced. The moon’s waxing and waning phases likewise have gold and water each at half a *jin*. If discussing the monthly hexagrams, *Tai* is the first month, *Pi* the seventh—not the hexagrams of the second and eighth months. The *Cantong Qi* says, *"Great Strength at the *mao* gate, observe in mid-autumn the tally’s rest."* The second and eighth months are the *Dazhuang* and *Guan* hexagrams.

Master Peng’s annotation on *Tai* says, *"Yin and yang qi are balanced, husband and wife unite."* On *Pi*, *"Heaven and earth both rest, yin and yang do not intersect."* For when balanced, they do not intersect; when one is more or less, they do. When yang is above and yin below, they do not intersect; when yin is above and yang below, they do—this is the principle of things.

Once this principle is understood, there is no need to cling to hexagrams and lines to tax the spirit.

**Thirty-Seven**

Within the hexagrams, the method is established through forms to obtain images—words may be forgotten, yet meaning becomes self-evident. Yet the deluded of the world cling only to images, practicing *gua qi* in hopes of ascension.

The annotation states: The hexagrams are but the trap and snare of fire. The Perfected Wei Boyang, upon reading the *Yi*, awakened to the workings of the Golden Elixir, seeing its Dao as one with the *Yi*. Thus he composed the *Cantong Qi*, expounding the hexagrams of the *Great Yi* to clarify the alchemy’s safeguards, offering guidance to later generations. He likened *Qian* and *Kun* to the cauldron and vessel, the numinous embryo and spirit-chamber within our cinnabar field. He further compared *Kan* and *Li* to the medicinal substances, lead and mercury within the numinous embryo and spirit-chamber. For *Qian* and *Kun* are the parents of all hexagrams, and *Kan* and *Li* the true essence of *Qian* and *Kun*. Thus these four hexagrams reside in the central palace, just as the numinous embryo, lead, and mercury dwell within the cinnabar field. The inner regulates the outer, so these four hexagrams are not bound to the fire-manipulation sequence. The remaining hexagrams are distributed across a single month, circulating the tally-fire, beginning with *Zhun* and ending with *Jiwei*, cycling without cease like a wheel’s turning. Each day, two hexagrams govern affairs; thirty days account for sixty hexagrams. Together with *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*—the cauldron, vessel, and medicinal substances—this totals sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines, mirroring a year’s three hundred eighty-four days, including intercalary months. It further reflects the two times eight ounces of the Golden Elixir, one *jin* equaling three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. All these are metaphors and established images. The adept who grasps this may perceive the workings of fire-manipulation through these hexagrams. Once the use of fire is understood, the hexagrams and their words may be forgotten as no longer needed.

Yet today’s scholars, failing to comprehend this safeguard, cling instead to these images to practice *gua qi*, exhausting their forms and tormenting their minds in hopes of ascension—is this not folly? One catches the fish and forgets the trap, snares the hare and forgets the snare. Now they cling to the trap and snare as if they were the fish and hare, drifting ever farther from the Dao.

Master Zhongli said: "How can the Great Dao be conveyed through words? Boyang borrowed the *Yi* to compose the *Cantong Qi*. Later generations, failing to recognize the immortals’ metaphors, cling to the trap and snare and set to work—this is the proof." The commentary states: The transmitted *gua qi* diagrams divide the sixty hexagrams, each line aligned with the breath-count to model the principles of water and fire, yin and yang. Clinging to images, they practice thus—how could they know the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, which uses hexagrams as mere traps and snares? The sixty hexagrams all derive from the pure yin and yang of *Qian* and *Kun*, yet only *Kan* and *Li* obtain the central qi of *Qian* and *Kun* and are thus correct. Excluding these four hexagrams as the female and male, *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the body, *Kan* and *Li* as the function. The sixty-four hexagrams serve as tally-signs, divided into cauldron, vessel, and medicinal substances, altogether forming the fire-phases of the celestial cycle. The alchemical Dao accords with heaven and earth, the *Yi*’s images harmonize with heaven and earth—thus the *Yi* is borrowed to illuminate the Dao.

Heaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness have their appointed times. Only by discerning their waxing and waning can one know the mechanism’s origin. When *geng* and *jia* are made clear and the command is executed, the Three Worms are annihilated, and the Dao may be attained.

The annotation states: Heaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness have their appointed times. Heaven and earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*. On the winter solstice, a single yang qi stirs within the earth, ascending daily by four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu*. After five days, it forms one *hou*; three *hou* make one *qi*; two *qi* make one *jie*; two *jie* make one season—this is the spring equinox. Over ninety days, the yang qi ascends forty-two thousand *li*, precisely to the midpoint between heaven and earth. At this time, yin contains half yang, forming the *Tai* hexagram. Its qi transforms from cold to warm, the time of the myriad things’ arising—thus it is spring.

From this point onward, the yang qi ascends into the yang position, gradually rising as before until the summer solstice. Counting from the winter solstice, one hundred eighty days have passed, and it has ascended eighty-four thousand *li*, reaching heaven. At this time, yang contains yet more yang, forming the pure yang *Qian* hexagram. Its qi transforms from warm to hot—this is summer, the time of the myriad things’ flourishing, thus called "fullness."

When heat reaches its extreme, yin arises. On the summer solstice, a single yin descends from heaven, also descending daily by four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu*. Five days form one *hou*; three *hou* make one *qi*; two *qi* make one *jie*; two *jie* make one season—this is the autumn equinox. Over ninety days, the yin qi descends forty-two thousand *li*, precisely to the midpoint between heaven and earth. At this time, yang contains half yin, forming the *Pi* hexagram. Its qi transforms from hot to cool, the time of the myriad things’ fruiting—thus it is autumn.

From this point onward, the yin qi descends into the yin position, gradually descending as before until the winter solstice. Counting from the summer solstice, one hundred eighty days have passed, and it has descended eighty-four thousand *li*, reaching earth. At this time, yin contains yet more yin, forming the pure yin *Kun* hexagram. Its qi transforms from cool to cold—this is winter, the time of the myriad things’ withdrawal, thus called "emptiness."

The sage discerns the waxing and waning of heaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness, observing it through the months, which arise from the days. On the third day, *Zhen* *geng* takes form; on the eighth day, *Dui* *ding* completes form; on the fifteenth day, *Qian* *jia* reaches fullness—this is the time of heaven and earth’s fullness. On the sixteenth day, *Xun* *xin* receives governance; on the twenty-third day, *Gen* *bing* guards the tally; on the thirtieth day, *Kun* *yi* dissolves—this is the time of heaven and earth’s emptiness.

The sage, able to discern the mechanism of heaven and earth’s waxing and waning, condenses a year’s seasonal qi into a single month. The first day, the arising of the single yang, corresponds to the winter solstice. Dividing two and a half days into thirty hours accounts for thirty days, matching a month’s seasonal qi. The upper tally day, when yin contains half yang, corresponds to the spring equinox. By the fifteenth day, the four months’ seasonal qi are obtained, forming pure yang—thus it is called "fullness," the yang qi’s completion, hence "fullness." By the sixteenth day, yin arises, corresponding to the summer solstice. The lower tally day, when yang contains half yin, mirrors the autumn equinox. By the thirtieth day, the ten months’ seasonal qi are obtained, forming pure yin—the yin qi’s completion, hence "emptiness." Ending and beginning anew, it cycles without cease.

The sage manipulates the yang fire and yin tally, following precisely heaven and earth’s waxing and waning, ascending and descending, the sixty-four hexagrams’ progression from *geng* to *jia*, and the principle of the moon’s waxing and waning. Just as the sovereign issues commands to annihilate the yin demons, so too may the Dao be attained.

The commentary states: There is the fullness and emptiness of heaven and earth, and the fullness and emptiness of the sun and moon. The sage models and aligns with heaven and earth, sun and moon’s fullness and emptiness. *Geng* and *jia* are the degrees of fire-progression, thus modeled on the moon. The moon arises in *Zhen* *geng*, the beginning of the moon’s fullness, where the yin tally retreats and the yang fire advances. The moon is full in *Qian* *jia*, the beginning of the moon’s emptiness, where the yang fire retreats and the yin tally advances—this too is the principle of fullness and emptiness. Moreover, *jia* wood is the dragon, *geng* metal the tiger—this is also the image of the dragon and tiger.

To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.
Once true essence returns,
A golden house arises—
A single luminous pearl never departs.

The commentary states: That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called *shen*. *Shen* has no form; it responds and thus communicates, like an echo answering a valley—hence "Valley Spirit." *Shen* is established through *qi*, *qi* is born from essence, and essence can generate *qi*, while *qi* can generate *shen*. Thus, *qi* is the master of the body, and the body is the abode of *shen* and *qi*. Without *shen* and *qi*, the form cannot live; without form, *shen* and *qi* cannot stand. These three depend on one another to give rise to life. If one desires longevity, the root must first be established in the Mysterious Female—only then can long life be attained. All spirits are born from these two and die through them. They are truly the root of heaven and earth, the ancestor of the Five Phases, the stem of yin and yang, and the foundation of the myriad transformations. The sage relies on them to achieve the external elixir and uses them to transform the inner cinnabar. Thus, when true essence is set in motion without cease, it returns to the golden crucible of earth, transmuting into a single luminous pearl whose radiance never flees. Gradually, form is refined into *qi*, *qi* into *shen*, until both form and *shen* attain wondrous subtlety, becoming as profound as the dragon’s manifestation.

The Gate of the Mysterious Female—few in the world know it.
Do not mistakenly apply effort to mouth and nose,
For even if you practice breathwork for a thousand years,
How could you seize the Golden Crow and grasp the Hare?

The commentary states: The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. How wondrous this saying! Yet none in the world can comprehend it—without a true teacher’s guidance, who could understand? Some, like Ye Wenshu, point to the space between the two kidneys as the "Mixed Primordial Cavity," but how could they glimpse the celestial mechanism and presume to dismiss other teachings? The Mysterious Female consists of two things—how could it be reduced to a single cavity? Since the beginning of creation, without these two, how could the myriad things exist? Thus, both the inner and outer elixirs are established through them. The sage conceals this, naming it the "Crescent Moon Furnace" and the "Suspended Embryo Crucible." The Golden Crow is the golden elixir; the Hare is one’s true *qi*. The golden elixir restrains one’s mercury, like a cat catching a rat or a hawk seizing a hare, allowing no escape. If one mistakes mouth and nose for the Mysterious Female, even after a thousand years of breathwork, one will only grow frail—how could one seize the Golden Crow, grasp the Hare, and form the sacred embryo?

The sub-commentary states: *Xuan* is yang; *pin* is yin. The *Book of Changes* says, "Heaven is *xuan* and earth is yellow; the hexagram *Kun* benefits the steadfastness of the mare." Here, *xuan* is borrowed to signify yang, and *pin* to signify yin. It is called a "gate" because the myriad things are born and die through this gate, and the Mysterious Female enters and exits through it. The terms "furnace" and "crucible" are also borrowed names. Master Bao’s *Song of the Mysterious Female* says, "Between the two kidneys, a radiant barrier shines." Later generations thus point to the space between the kidneys as the "Mixed Primordial Cavity," unaware that the two kidneys are merely metaphors for the wondrous workings of the body—two things emerging from the same source yet bearing different names. If one can unite them, a single luminous millet-pearl may be obtained in an instant—this is the true Gate of the Mysterious Female. Those who do not understand the metaphor cling to the *Song of the Mysterious Female* as literal truth, mistaking the space between the kidneys for the gate, or even misidentifying mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—such are the errors of superficial understanding.

Forty-One
Different names, same origin—few know this.
These two, profoundly mysterious, are the crucial mechanism.
Preserve life, complete the form,
Understand gain and loss—
The Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrous.

The commentary states: The Most High said, "Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things." He also said, "These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names." When it is formless, the true unity of *qi* is invisible—hence it is the beginning of heaven and earth. When it takes form, the true unity of *qi* transforms into a millet-grain, appearing within the empty mystery—hence it is the mother of the myriad things. In heaven, it is *Li* as mercury; on earth, it is *Kan* as lead. Their root is the same, but their emergence differs. This sameness is called "mysterious within the mysterious." In the practice of the Dao, grasping these two mysterious mechanisms to understand gain and loss and cultivate the body allows one to preserve form and safeguard life. These two are simply the yin and yang *qi*. As for "loss," it refers to the Five Phases following their natural course—this is the ordinary path of birth and extinction. Alas! The Purple Gold Elixir of pure yang is established as the beginning of heaven and earth and emerges as the mother of the myriad things. When it is said that the Purple Gold Elixir is most wondrous, know that the immortal sages’ admiration is boundless.

The sub-commentary states: In heaven, it is *Li* as mercury—fire flames upward as *Li*, rooted in heaven, which is yang above. Wood generates fire within, producing cinnabar; the yang of heaven contains yin, and the solemn yin descends from heaven. On earth, it is *Kan* as lead—water moistens downward as *Kan*, rooted in earth, which is yin below. Water generates metal within, producing lead; the yin of earth contains yang, and the blazing yang ascends from earth. Once heaven and earth are established in their positions and the sun and moon take form, all are transformations of the two *qi*—water as yin and fire as yang. Fire flames upward, light and clear, bright without and dark within; water moistens downward, heavy and turbid, dark within and bright without. After heaven, earth, sun, and moon take form, the Five Phases each assume their forms within heaven and earth. Metal, when struck, produces fire; when smelted, it becomes water. Wood, when drilled, produces fire; when pressed, it yields water. Earth is born from fire and moistened by water. Metal and wood are not the union of fire; rather, the two *qi* of water and fire pervade metal, wood, and earth. Water and fire cannot generate themselves—humans must act upon them. As for metal, wood, and earth, they cannot act on their own but must await human use—thus, the water and fire of the Five Phases are those that retain the fullness of *qi*. Heaven and earth, the myriad things—none exist beyond the Five Phases; the Five Phases, in turn, do not depart from yin and yang; and yin and yang emerge together from the Supreme Ultimate. This is the meaning of "emerging from the same source yet bearing different names." Their root is the same—the root of the Mysterious Female emerges from the true unity of the Supreme Ultimate. Their emergence differs—the true unity of *qi* divides into the yin and yang of the Mysterious Female. This is the sameness of their root and the difference of their emergence. The two of the Mysterious Female emerge from the undifferentiated *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate. Once formed, they receive their nature in purity and reside in their proper places. By inverting the practice, the Purple Gold Elixir can be achieved.

Forty-Two
At first, one acts—people rush to notice.
Only when one reaches non-action do the many begin to understand.
They see non-action as the wonder of the Dao,
Yet do not know that action is the root.

The commentary states: Some study the Buddha’s path of cultivating nature, clinging to the notion that all action is illusory and false, and thus disparage the Daoist path of cultivating life. These are those who know one aspect but not the other—those who glimpse the gate but have not entered the hall or the inner chamber.

Forty-Three
Within the black lies white—this is the Elixir Mother;
Within the male hides female—this is the Sacred Embryo.
The Supreme One resides in the crucible—guard it well,
Treasure gathered in the Three Fields aligns with the Three Terraces.

The commentary states: Extracting silver from lead becomes the Elixir Mother;
Drawing mercury from cinnabar forms the Sacred Embryo.
These two stir and transform the *qi* of the True One,
Coalescing within the crucible of the Supreme One.
Only by refining the fire’s timing and serenely upholding the method,
Without the slightest deviation,
Do the Three Natures merge to crystallize the Elixir Treasure,
Its radiance ascending to match the Three Terraces.
The Supreme One holds the true *qi*—thus it is said:
“The Supreme One embraces the true *qi*.”

The annotation states: Extracting silver from lead and drawing mercury from cinnabar
Are but borrowed external substances to embody the principle of yin-yang mutual engagement.
Yet people, unaware, mistakenly pursue refinement and ingestion,
Or misguidedly compose commentaries—leading many astray.
In the *Golden Crucible*, the Nameless Master sought to preserve the mercury within cinnabar,
With poems on the Azure Dragon and Black Tiger, each to east and west.
All these are but analogies—like silver in lead, mercury in cinnabar.
By studying the three poems deeply,
One discerns the marvel of these two substances,
For only they can stir and transform the *qi* of the True One—
How could common lead or mercury ever suffice?

Forty-Four
Within the dim and indistinct, seek the image;
Amid the profound and obscure, find the true essence.
From being and non-being, each enters the other—
How could mere thought ever grasp their formation?

The commentary states: Within the dim and indistinct lies the image—this is the dragon’s *qi*;
Amid the profound and obscure dwells the essence—this is the tiger’s *qi*.
Both are present as *qi* yet lack form.
Vague and elusive, deep and remote—
Seen but not visible, heard but not audible—
This is the *qi* of the True One.
The *qi* of the True One is supremely numinous yet formless.
The True One Master said:
Non-being is the dragon; being is the tiger.
Non-being is the *qi* of mercury; being is the *qi* of lead.
Non-being, stirred by being, takes form;
Being, moved by non-being, gains numinosity.
Thus the millet pearl hangs in emptiness,
And purple frost gleams in the sunlight.
Those who sit rigidly in meditation, clinging to dust-laden thoughts—
How pitiful they are!

The annotation states: The *Cantong Qi* says: “Being and non-being restrain each other.”
When the upper is closed, it is called being;
When the lower is closed, it is called non-being.
Master Peng’s *Exegesis of the True* divides this into two interpretations,
But the Nameless Master here cites the principle of mutual restraint between being and non-being—
This is the crucial secret of the Great Elixir,
Contained in the meaning of the two words: lead and fire.
Now, examining this poem—
Above, it lists the dim and obscure; below, it summarizes with being and non-being.
Thus, it should follow the meaning of upper and lower closure.
Yet one must not be rigidly bound by the commentary.
Being and non-being restrain each other—
The *Jinbi Shangjing* states: “Take the two non-beings as the school, the one being as the gate.”
The enlightened sage awakens to the Dao—how could it lie in clinging to the text?
If one penetrates deeply, all applications align.

Forty-Five
When the Four Images are complete, the Mysterious Body takes form;
When the Five Agents are whole, the Purple Radiance shines.
Shedding the husk, it enters the mouth—
Divine and sacred beyond measure,
Even the dragon spirits flee in awe.

The annotation states: When dragon and tiger conjoin in union, the Four Images are complete and the Five Agents whole. When the Four Images and Five Agents unite in harmony, the true and singular body coalesces like a millet-grain pearl, its purple radiance shining. Secretly refined within, it is seized and drawn into the mouth—passing through the divine and attaining the sacred without limit. How could the dragon spirits not be struck with awe and reverence?

The commentary explains: The Four Images are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior. The Five Agents are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. The great Dao is empty and without form, yet takes the golden elixir as its profound mystery. Though the golden elixir is wondrous, it is nothing more than the gathering and harmonizing of the Five Agents and the union of the Four Images. When the Four Images unite as one, the Mysterious Body is surely formed; when the Five Agents harmonize, the elixir’s radiance naturally shines. This is neither the fire of stored intention nor the water of the kidneys, nor is it the liver as dragon and lungs as tiger. Heaven generates humanity, and humanity generates the numinous treasure—the Five Agents gather here, the Four Images assemble here. If one obtains the Mysterious Mechanism and refines the great medicine, shedding the husk and entering the mouth, one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood. How could the boundless dragon spirits not be filled with awe and reverence?

Forty-Six
After drinking from the Flowery Pond, the moon’s radiance grows clear.
Mounting a golden dragon, I visit the Purple Tenuity.
From this time forth, all immortals know me—
Whether the sea fields shift or the hills and valleys move.

**Annotation states:** The Flowery Pond is the elixir. Once the drinking is complete, the work is perfected, the embryo shed, and the spirit transformed—flesh like ice and snow, graceful as Liezi riding the qi and clouds to roam the eight extremities. Having beheld the dusty world to the full, one lets the seas turn to mulberry fields, the mulberry fields turn to seas, high ridges become valleys, and deep valleys become ridges.

**Forty-Seven**
To know the method of refining, nurturing, and returning the elixir,
One must sow the seed in one’s own garden—
No need for forced breath or straining effort,
For the fruit will ripen naturally, the numinous embryo shed.

**Annotation states:** This thing is none other than what lies within one’s own body, of the same kind. The Dao is most near, never distant from humanity—just as planting in one’s garden yields its own growth. Its nearness is evident. If the seed is not of the same kind, success is difficult; if it is, it is as easy as turning the palm. The *Cantong Qi* says: "When of the same kind, effort is easily applied; when not, skill is hard to achieve." What need is there for straining effort?

**Commentary states:** The previous verse speaks of idly tending the medicine furnace and watching the fire-timer, and also says there is a natural true fire for nurturing. Here, it states there is no need for forced breath or straining effort—all refer to the workings of the inner medicine. It further speaks of setting up the furnace and establishing the tripod, gathering and refining, with the Great One in the furnace—all refer to the workings of the outer medicine. This thing is the Yang elixir. The Yang elixir, being of the same kind as oneself, easily forms the embryo. The *Mud Pill* speaks of "one *mu* within the body as one’s garden." Without a teacher’s transmission, one may rashly guess and speculate. Fortunate is the one who receives the transmission, so that all may easily understand and together ascend to the fruit of immortality. Thus, where the annotation was not fully clear, I have further elucidated its meaning. The poems and words are each distinguished by their kind, yet within what is easily known, there are also things difficult to know, which I dare not lightly commit to bamboo and silk. For those who study immortality and possess the karmic affinity for it, this book—with its annotations and commentaries—offers a clear and unerring path. If one can fully awaken, there will come a day of attaining the great Dao. This text, a treasure of the immortal’s satchel, is guarded by numinous spirits at every turn. How could one not cherish and deeply study it?

**Forty-Eight**
Cease all artifice and forced effort—
Recognize the deathless method of the other household.
Within the alchemical vessel, steadily brew the wine of extended life;
Within the tripod, gather the nectar of returning souls.

**Annotation states:** Many who cultivate the truth cling to methods that are not of the same kind, applying artifice and effort, yet refuse to seek the other household’s deathless method of the same kind. They can gather the Yang elixir of returning souls within the tripod and steadily brew the mercury-fire of extended life within the abdomen. These two things are the supreme treasures of true cultivation. The *Cantong Qi* says: "When of the same kind, effort is easily applied; when not, skill is hard to achieve." This is the proof. The so-called "other household" refers to the white tiger’s *qi*-essence. Later students often mistake their own bodily essence for true lead. If this were so, why would the immortal sages deceive others with talk of the "other household"?

**Commentary states:** The previous verse speaks of sowing the seed in one’s own garden. Wu Mingzi explains: "Refusing to seek the other household’s deathless method of the same kind." The earlier verse refers to oneself, hence "one’s own"; this verse teaches others, hence "the other household." Yet the same kind is one. This "same kind" does not mean one person with another, but the primordial qi in its undifferentiated unity. Using primordial qi to supplement primordial qi is like using boundless qi to replenish finite qi—hence the ease of attaining immortality. The *Cantong Qi* says: "Primal essence flows and spreads, borne by qi to lodge in things." This is the same kind. If one uses human to supplement human, the body is entirely yin; using yin to supplement yin is like a hen hatching its own egg—its form is incomplete. How can it achieve the marvel of yin-yang union? How can it congeal the primordial qi into an elixir? How can it transform the purely yang body into a purely yang immortal?

**Forty-Nine**
The snow mountain’s single flavor—fine *tighu*;
Poured into the Eastern Yang’s crucible of transformation.
If it passes beyond Kunlun to the northwest,
Only Zhang Qian would have seen Ma Gu.

**Annotation:**
The snow mountain’s white color symbolizes the west and the phase of metal—this is the golden elixir. A single grain of golden elixir tastes like fine *tighu*; taking it as medicine, it enters my cinnabar field within the crucible of transformation. Kunlun Mountain lies amid the sea of waters, and thus entering Kunlun is the place where fire is ignited. Atop Kunlun’s summit is a gate called the Mysterious Gate, which is the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven lies in the northwest, in the *gan* position, hence the immortal elder’s saying: "Plant it in the *gan* household’s chamber of intercourse." Thus, if one passes beyond the northwest, Zhang Qian would see Ma Gu.

Zhang Qian is a man, symbolizing the *Qian* hexagram and yang fire, and also representing true mercury. Ma Gu is a woman, symbolizing the *Kun* hexagram and the yin tally, and also representing true lead. This speaks of passing beyond Kunlun to ignite fire and enter through the Mysterious Gate, whereupon the true mercury within the crucible first meets true lead and undergoes transformation. As true lead inwardly melts with true fire and outwardly connects with the *Kun* symbol, it transforms into the *Qian* symbol and yang fire, driving out the yin tally. The two fires advance in mutual exchange, and lead and mercury congeal—here lies the root of the Dao of immortality. Zhang Qian riding a raft across the Heavenly River to meet the Woman Star is but an allegory for the mutual encounter of yin and yang.

**Exegesis:**
The outer fire is the true qi of heaven and earth; the inner fire is the ancestral qi of the primordial sea. Only when the two fires interflow do mercury and lead congeal, and the sacred embryo may be formed.

Not knowing yin and yang, nor host and guest—
Who can tell which is distant, which near?
In the chamber, the tail gate is sealed in vain,
How many in Jambudvīpa have been slain!

**Annotation:**
Zhongli Quan said: "The four great elements of the body are all yin—what then is yang essence?" Now, yang essence is the essence of the true One, the qi of utmost yang, called the yang elixir. One’s own true qi is yin and serves as the master of the body, nourishing all its parts. When the yang elixir arrives from without to restrain one’s yin mercury, it becomes the host, while one’s own yin mercury becomes the guest. The two long for each other and congeal into golden sand, naturally neither flying nor fleeing. Then, with the addition of fire, it is refined into the golden liquid returning elixir. Thus, the yang elixir is external and called distant, while one’s own true qi is internal and called near. Reversing this near and distant to establish host and guest, the Dao is accomplished.

Those who lose their way do not grasp this principle and instead practice the bedchamber arts of controlling women, forcibly sealing their essence and qi, calling it "refining the yin elixir." Seeking to prolong life, they instead hasten death—this is like carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. The *Yinfu Jing* says: "Fire is born from wood, and calamity arises—it must be overcome." Can one not be cautious?

**Exegesis:**
When the guest becomes the host and the distant becomes near, this is the marvel of inversion. Those who seal the tail gate mistake it for the art of reversing the Yellow River’s flow—many have lost their lives thus.

**Fifty-One**

All things flourish and return to their root; returning to the root is called repose, and repose is called regaining life’s mandate—thus one abides long. To know the constant and return to the root is difficult to guard against; reckless action invites misfortune—this all have heard.

**Annotation:**
All things flourish and each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called regaining life’s mandate; regaining life’s mandate is called the constant. To know the constant is called illumination—these are the supreme words of the Most High. Before a person is born, they dwell in darkness, without knowing, merged in primordial simplicity. At birth, they receive from yin and yang, inherit from father and mother. The sage reverses this and cultivates it, seizing the qi of precelestial origin as the elixir mother, plundering the true qi of yin and yang as the foundation of transformation. Refining form to reenter formlessness, refining qi to return to primordial simplicity, refining spirit to unite with the Dao in truth—thus returning to the root and regaining life’s mandate is long abiding. Those who can know the constant Dao and return to the root are sages—hence they attain long life. Those who do not know the constant Dao, who return to the root yet act recklessly, are common people—hence they invite misfortune.

Ouye personally transmitted the sword-casting method:
Mo Ye’s metal and water matched soft and hard,
Once refined, it could discern human intent,
Slaying demons a thousand miles away in a flash of lightning.

**Annotation:**
When Ouye cast the sword, the Heavenly Emperor sent a divine maiden to attend the furnace. He tempered it with metal and water, matched it with soft and hard, and after forging the precious sword, it could slay the fierce and cut down the evil in a flash of lightning—its numinous power was so divine. The making of the returning elixir and the casting of swords are alike: taking heaven and earth as the furnace, using yin and yang as water and fire, matching the Five Phases, controlling with spirit and qi. After refinement, it can bend or straighten, soften or harden, do good or evil, be round or square. When the heart conceives a thought or the mind directs an intention, it already knows human intent and flies into action, slaying and cutting in a flash of lightning—this is the natural spirit-sword. If a cultivator of the elixir lacks this sword, it is like seeking fish and rabbits without a trap or snare. The immortal elder alludes to Ouye’s sword-casting to speak of it, yet in truth it is the intangible image of the dark pearl. The intangible image is the celestial mechanism, the secret formula.

**Exegesis:**
The forged and cast sword is used where it ought to be used; the natural sword is the spirit of the returning elixir, the transformation of returning to essence—just as Ouye’s cast sword possesses numinous power.

**Fifty-Three**
Strike bamboo to summon lead, swallow jade mushrooms;
Beat the zither to call the phoenix, drink the knife’s edge.
Lately, golden light shines through the body,
Yet one speaks not of this to ordinary people.

**Annotation:**
This speaks of the work of firing the elixir. Bamboo is hollow-hearted and without emotion; striking means two things colliding. Playing the zither signifies the harmony of husband and wife. Lead is lead; the phoenix is mercury.

The *daogui* is the vessel of the yin tally; the jade mushroom is the qi of yang fire. The dragon’s refined qi is called jade mushroom; the tiger’s refined qi is called *daogui*. This speaks of dragon and tiger striking each other to unite as husband and wife, harmonious as the sound of the zither. The phoenix is the Vermilion Bird of the South; lead is the Dark Warrior of the North. This is also the image of Kan and Li intermingling to refine the golden elixir. At that moment, gather and ingest it, returning it to the cinnabar field within the earthen crucible. There, subdue one’s own yin mercury. Then, with an empty heart, harmonize the affection of husband and wife, conjoining yin and yang to move the tally fire. Follow the hexagrams and lines, matching breath with spirit and qi. Use spirit and qi to guide water and fire; with water and fire, refine the embryo breath. The embryo breath roams and chants as Kan and Li intermingle within the central palace of the earthen crucible. Nourish lead and mercury, which day and night consume the qi of the tally fire, thereby generating the substance of golden liquid—this is the golden liquid returning elixir.

**Exegesis:**
According to the *Yi Zhen Lun*: When moving the fire, one may feel something at the coccyx surging straight up through the spine, passing the double gates with a distinct sound, ascending to the mud pill, then descending from the mud pill to strike the upper palate. Droplet by droplet, it enters the mouth, resembling sparrow’s eggs, tasting like frozen butter—fragrant, sweet, soft, and delightful. When this occurs, it is the golden liquid returning elixir. Swallow it slowly into the cinnabar field. If this happens continuously without cease, the five viscera become clear and empty. Closing the eyes to inwardly observe, the organs appear as if illuminated by candlelight. Gradually, myriad golden rays shine brilliantly, radiating from the body like a wheel of fire, clouds and mist swirling around it. Step by step, sacred signs manifest in succession, verifying the transcendence from the ordinary to the sagely—this is no mere metaphor but the true vision. The immortal elder silently bore this marvel, daring not speak of it to others, for it is not a matter seen or heard in the human realm.

**Fifty-Four**
When medicine meets qi and tally, only then does form arise;
The Dao abides in emptiness, uniting with spontaneity.
A single grain of golden elixir swallowed into the belly—
Only then do I know my words do not depend on heaven.

**Annotation:**
There is a thing formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth. The sage thus forcibly names it the Dao, forcibly names it the primordial chaos of the true unity of qi. Invisible when looked upon, inaudible when listened to, unattainable when grasped. The sage, in resonance with the tally of the two eights’ initial qi, communicates and penetrates, descending numinous power to form an image within the empty mystery. A single grain, like a millet seed, ingested into the belly instantly dries the mercury, transforming it into a body of pure yang, enduring as long as heaven and earth. Chaoyuanzi said: “Life and death exhaust the Dao, which depends on heaven and earth; nature and destiny originally belong to mercury and lead. This is not my destiny; it is in me and does not depend on heaven.”

**Fifty-Five**
The radiant red golden elixir forms in a single day—
Ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.
Those who speak of nine years or three years
Are merely delaying and prolonging the allotted time.

**Annotation:**
For the great medicine of the golden elixir, the work of the lower furnace takes no more than half an hour to immediately obtain and ingest. This speaks of “a single day” because the sage condenses a year’s qi into a month, a month’s qi into a day, and a day’s qi into an hour. Generally speaking, this is called “attaining immortality in a single day.” Thus, the immortal elder said: “Exchanging days for hours is the method of divine work.” Once the golden elixir enters the mouth, one immediately ascends to the sacred realm—such swift and clear verification! How could it be a matter of three years or nine years, protracting time and delaying the schedule? The ancient immortal Zhang Guolao wrote:
*The radiant red golden elixir forms in a single day;
The yellow sprout does not leave the cinnabar mine.
Though the work is not yet thrice completed,
Upon opening the furnace, one already sees the radiant light.*
This is the Dao.

**Fifty-Six**
The great Dao’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—
It depends on me, or it depends on heaven.
If one does not accumulate deeds and bestow yin virtue,
Then myriad demons will arise to obstruct the path.

**Annotation:**
Demonic obstructions lie in heaven; cultivation lies in me. Without bestowing yin virtue, obstacles arise at every turn.

**Exegesis:**
The previous poem said: “A single grain of golden elixir swallowed into the belly—only then do I know it depends on me, not on heaven,” greatly praising the efficacy of the golden elixir as most numinous and divine. This poem now says: “It depends on me, or it depends on heaven,” exhorting learners that upon hearing the great Dao, they should accumulate deeds and bestow virtue to seek heavenly assistance. One must not rely solely on the elixir’s numinosity, for there will surely be demonic obstructions to hinder progress.

**Fifty-Seven**
The Three Powers mutually steal and consume in their time—
This is the mechanism of immortals’ Dao and virtue.
When the myriad transformations are at peace, all concerns cease;
The hundred bones are all ordered, verifying non-action.

**Annotation:**
Heaven and earth steal from the myriad things through the four seasons, thus there is flourishing and withering, yet they cannot remain forever flourishing. The myriad things steal from humans through the five flavors, thus there is life and death, yet they cannot remain forever living. Humans steal from the myriad things through the five phases, thus there is completion and decay, yet they cannot remain forever enduring. When the three stealings are fitting, the Three Powers are at peace. Therefore, there is life and death, prosperity and decline, flourishing and fading, day and night, coming and going, birth and killing, rise and fall, things and self, right and wrong—all arising in profusion, cycling endlessly and unfathomably. This is the natural Dao. If one can blend these three stealings into one, reverse their mechanism and act, seize the right time to consume, then the hundred bones will all be ordered, and the myriad transformations will naturally be at peace. When the myriad transformations are at peace, all concerns cease, and the Dao of non-action is naturally verified.

**Fifty-Eight**
The precious characters of the *Yin Fu* exceed three hundred;
The numinous scripture of the *Dao De* stops at five thousand.
Immortals of past and present, without limit in number,
All from this pass through to reach the true transmission.

**Annotation:**
The two scriptures serve as the governing key of all classics and the pivotal hub of the various masters. Immortals and sagely beings of old have, without exception, awakened to the true transmission through these two scriptures and thereby attained the great Dao.

**Fifty-Nine**
Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a master’s transmission, do not force conjecture.
For the alchemical classics lack oral instructions—
How can you forge the spiritual embryo without guidance?

**Annotation:**
Amidst a thousand classics and ten thousand discourses, only the branches are expounded; the supreme Dao is not complex. It is solely transmitted through the mind-seal. Without encountering a true master, all efforts are in vain. This Dao cannot be forcibly deduced, even by one as wise as Yan or Min.

**Sixty**
When the restless mind-monkey is stilled and the square-inch mechanism tamed,
Three thousand merits align with heaven’s measure.
Naturally, the cauldron refines dragon and tiger—
Yet how can one bear the clinging to home, wife, and child?

**Annotation:**
This verse admonishes those of the present age who fail to turn back. The "square-inch mechanism" refers to the mind of the cultivator, which, before the elixir is refined, must be utterly lucid, unshaken by the restless mind-monkey or galloping intent-horse. As an ancient song says: *"Man’s nature is originally a monkey— / Myriad distractions arise from outward wandering. / If you can subdue and gather the six essences, / The luminous pearl will coalesce by night."*

Master Lü states: *"Before refining the returning elixir, first refine the mind."* The *Western Mountain Record* says: *"True immortals and sagely beings teach people to cultivate the Dao by cultivating the mind, / And to cultivate the mind by cultivating the Dao."* Further: *"Restrain it, and it is upright; / Release it, and it runs wild. / From clarity, the Dao arises; / From turbidity, the spirit is lost."* This is the essential barrier.

The so-called "merits" are the interplay of yin and yang. The Immortal Elder says: *"The great medicine is cultivated with ease or difficulty— / Know that it depends on me, / Not on heaven. / Without accumulated merits and deeds, / Hordes of demons will obstruct the path."*

Master Zhongli Quan says: *"Merits without conduct are like feet missing; / Conduct without merits is like the sun halting. / When merits and conduct are both complete, / The feet are prepared—who says one cannot become an immortal?"* Master Lü says: *"The road to Penglai requires three thousand merits fulfilled— / Then one strides alone into the clouds to return."* When hidden virtues are accumulated, one inevitably encounters a perfected being. Thus it is said: *"Naturally, there is a cauldron to refine dragon and tiger."*

As for "clinging to wife and child," the Immortal Elder’s intent is to caution scholars against straying from the true Dao into deviant practices. To cling to wife and child is to sink forever in the sea of suffering. The scholar must nurture aspirations beyond the mundane.

**Sixty-One**
If you have not yet refined the Returned Elixir, refine it with urgency;
Once refined, you must know when to stop and be content.
Should you cling to fullness without ceasing,
Disgrace and misfortune will one day befall you.

**Annotation says:**
A man’s *tiankui* arrives at sixteen and is exhausted by sixty-four.
When it first arrives, it is full and pure, weighing one catty.
By the time he reaches his prime, one *liang* of mercury has fled;
By thirty, four *liang* have gone;
By sixty, the bed is stripped to the frame—
At sixty-four, the number is complete, the pure *kun* transmission spent.
When crow flies and hare runs, time waits for no man.
Living mercury must borrow lead to capture;
The Returned Elixir must be refined without delay.
Once refined, embrace the One and guard sincerity.
If you do not know contentment, clinging to what is not yours,
You will suffer disgrace and misfortune.

Zhongli Quan says:
When the Elixir is ripe, do not apply further firing;
To continue firing will harm the Elixir.
It is best to preserve and guard it without loss.
Drink when thirsty, eat when hungry, sleep when weary.
If you can further clarify the mind and perceive your nature,
Facing the wall for nine years,
This Dao will grow ever more profound.

**Commentary says:**
Lü Chunyang was sixty-four when he met Zhengyang;
Ge the Immortal was sixty-four when he met Master Zheng;
Ma Ziran was sixty-four when he met Haichan—
All were then cultivating the Golden Elixir’s Way and attained immortality.
Once refined, know contentment:
After ten months of gestation, one should bathe,
And within a year, all will be complete—
No need to wait for the winter solstice to cease work.
*The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:
*"The firing times are not fixed;
The winter solstice is not at midnight.
When it is time to bathe,
Even the hours of mao and you are empty."*
Shi Xinglin says:
*"The winter solstice is not at midnight;
Bathing is not at mao and you."*
Dao Guang says:
*"After shedding the embryo and bathing,
Carry and nurture it to secure long life."*
All three immortals attained the Dao at sixty-four—
What was the Way they cultivated?
May we hear its outline?

**I reply:**
All three immortals, in their prime, aspired to the Dao, upheld precepts, and accumulated talismans.
Only at sixty-four did they receive the true transmission of the Golden Elixir,
Thus attaining the Dao swiftly.
As for worldly men, lust and desire deplete essence;
Anxious thoughts harm the spirit;
Fatigue and toil exhaust *qi*.
Once true yang is lost,
Even if they hear of the Great Dao before sixty-four,
Success will be difficult.
If one can sever desire in youth,
Seek the Dao in one’s prime,
While the body is yet unspoiled and essence undiminished,
And meet a master to receive guidance and begin swift cultivation—
If no master is met, do not dissipate your essence or weary your form.
Accumulate merit and pile up conduct,
Awaiting the encounter.
Then, perhaps, you may hope for the Dao attained by the three immortals.
Their Way is recorded in the classics—its threads may be traced.

Zhengyang showed Chunyang a few grains of Elixir, saying:
*"This is not the five metals or eight stones of the world,
But a wondrous treasure compounded from the world’s rarities.
Though it has substance, it is formless—
Like clouds, like fire, like light, like shadow,
Visible yet intangible.
When consumed, it unites with a person’s soul and consciousness,
Becoming one body—light, empty, and wondrous,
Not an Elixir of tangible form."*

Ge the Immortal’s *"Song of the Flowing Pearl"* says:
*"Flowing Pearl, Flowing Pearl,
You make me toil endlessly,
Wandering the four seas,
Traversing ten thousand books.
Anxious, I forget sleep and meals,
Visiting all my learned friends,
Burning cinnabar and mercury for thirty years,
Sighing daily.
Now at sixty, I grieve over descending the Three Paths.
Fortunately, my master transmitted the primordial *qi* of emptiness and non-being.
First stabilize the golden tripod,
Then secure the jade furnace.
Stir the *li* fire to arouse the *kan* fire.
When the jade liquid moistens the chamber,
The flowing tassels of the Grotto Palace—
The true man’s teaching—
A man of true resolve must keep this in mind.
Remember, remember!"*

Ma Ziran’s *"Song of the Golden Elixir"* says:
*"The sixty-four hexagrams all say ‘cease.’
I met Haichan as my disciple,
Who then told me a single phrase—
All my past efforts were in vain.
It turns out this alone is the Returned Elixir,
Right before my eyes, yet I did not recognize it.
In the year *gengzi*, the month *wuyin*,
I met a perfected being who imparted the oral formula—
Like jade in stone, uncarved.
When carved, it was white as snow,
Within it the Returned Elixir, two times eight *liang*,
Born in the cinnabar field.
If the yellow sprout is obtained and planted in the cinnabar field,
Lifespan will be boundless, beyond reckoning."*

This is the Dao attained by the three immortals,
In accord with the same ultimate principle as the *Wuzhen Pian*.
The Purple Mystery Zhang Zhenren lived to ninety-six.
In the fifth year of *Yuanfeng* (*renxu*), on the fifth day of the third month,
He departed through *shijie*.
From the second year of *Xining* (*jiyou*), when he met his master in Chengdu and received the Dao,
The Zhenren was already eighty-two.
His cultivation occurred after sixty-four—
His preservation and nurturing in ordinary times bore deep merit.

*The Yellow Court Classic* says:
*"At one hundred and twenty, one may still return,
But beyond this, guarding the Dao is most difficult.
Only by relying on the ninefold refined Eight Precious Elixir,
Replenishing essence and contemplating the Seven Origins,
Can this be achieved."*

**Sixty-Two**
Simply take the door of death as the door of life;
Do not cling to the gate of life as the gate of death.
If you recognize the turning point and act with insight,
You will see that harm conceals life, and kindness arises.

**Annotation says:**
Yin and yang, the five phases—
Following them brings life; reversing them brings death.
This is the common Way.
Yet who knows there is a life that is not life—
Thus long life?
A compliance that is not compliance—
Thus ultimate compliance?
If you can understand this turning point,
Then harm conceals life, and kindness arises,
And a man may conceive—
This is no lie.
The killing mechanism is the mechanism of theft.

**Commentary says:**
What gives me life is yin and yang, the five phases;
What brings me death is also yin and yang, the five phases.
Taking the door of death as the door of life
Is the ability to reverse the killing mechanism.
If you lightly employ life and follow the common Way,
What gives you life will kill you.
Ordinary people follow yin and yang, the five phases—
Thus death comes.
The perfected reverse yin and yang—
Thus they live.
The immortal steals the mechanism,
Shedding the illusory body.
People see them as dead—
This is not death.
The pure yang true body soars and transforms,
Coextensive with heaven and earth, enduring forever.
Thus, the life that is not life is long life.
Inverting the five phases, reversing creation—
This is non-compliance.
Seizing the essence of heaven and earth,
Returning it to the limitless—
This is compliance.
Thus, the compliance that is not compliance is ultimate compliance.

**Sixty-Three**
Fortune and misfortune arise mutually, each leaning on the other,
Like echoes and shadows following one another.
If you can turn this mechanism of life and death,
Disaster becomes blessing in the space between your palms.

**Annotation says:**
Yang governs life and is called fortune;
Yin governs killing and is called misfortune.
When yin wanes, yang waxes;
When yang reaches its peak, yin arises—
Mutually leaning, like echoes and shadows following.
This is the natural principle of the common Way.
If you can follow this mechanism of killing and life in cultivation,
Then disaster becomes blessing in the space between your palms,
And harm conceals life, a man conceives—
This is no lie.

---

**Sixty-Four**
In cultivation, mingle with the world and harmonize your light;
Be round when round is needed, square when square is needed.
Display or conceal as others require—
Let none discern your actions or concealments.

**Annotation says:**
"Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade within, harmonizing one’s light and merging with the dust, mending the broken fence—
No self, no others, in seclusion or in the open, in accord or in opposition,
How could ordinary folk fathom or measure this?"

**Twelve *Xijiangyue* [Moon Over the West River] (Composed According to the Twelve Months’ Rhythm)**
**[The Immortal Elder’s self-annotation: "West" is the direction of metal; "river" is the body of water; "moon" is the function of the elixir. Wumingzi’s annotation: The Immortal Elder composed this suite to the rhythm of the twelve months to reveal the Great Dao.]**

The inner elixir is akin to the outer elixir,
Inner and outer must both be open and flowing.
The cinnabar head blends and unites—
Their warmth and nurturing serve twofold functions.

Within resides the celestial true fire,
In the crucible, blazing and ever-red.
The outer furnace demands diligent effort in increase and decrease—
Nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed.

**Annotation says:**
The *Pomi Song* of Yimen states:
"The Dao arises within—set up the furnace and tripod without.
The Dao arises without—Kan and Li, lead and mercury lie within."
This clarifies the two elixirs, inner and outer.

Now, the outer elixir is the Golden Elixir,
Wrought in the crucible of the two eights,
Achieved in less than half an hour.
The inner elixir is the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir,
Wrought within one’s own belly,
Requiring ten full months to complete the transformation and transcend the womb.

Observe these two elixirs: though their methods of blending the cinnabar head and their operations may seem roughly alike,
Their workings in fire and timing differ vastly in speed.
When the cultivator begins the work, at the moment the inner elixir blends with the cinnabar head,
Even the slightest deviation will prevent the Great Elixir from forming.
Take heed! Take heed!

Though the inner elixir possesses true fire within the earthen cauldron, blazing and ever-red,
It must rely on the outer furnace’s effort in increase, decrease, withdrawal, and addition,
Lest miscalculation lead to peril.
Yet the endless transformations of inner and outer true fire truly depend on the marvel of true lead—
This substance alone can capture mercury and prevent its flight.

Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp this principle, claimed:
"The inner elixir is refined by true fire,
While the outer elixir requires mundane fire’s increase and decrease."
Such a view, like peering at the sky through a tube, merits but a laugh.
Little does he know that though the two elixirs differ, their essence is one Dao.

The so-called inner and outer elixirs:
Within a single body, one is endowed with the essence of Heaven and Earth,
Born and shaped through the molding of yin and yang.
Thus, within this body, essence, qi, and spirit are sovereign.
Spirit is born of qi, qi of essence—
These three are postcelestial, the most yin substances of Heaven and Earth.

If the cultivator clings to the body alone in practice,
The utmost they can achieve is refining these three—essence, qi, and spirit.
Yet how can these three, being of one nature, entirely postcelestial, purely yin and devoid of yang,
Transform the form into pure yang and emerge beyond Heaven and Earth?

Thus the Immortal Elder said:
"Cultivating a single substance only leads to frailty."
Master Zhongli stated:
"Tears, saliva, semen, fluids, qi, blood, and humor—these seven are all yin."
He also said:
"Cultivating a single substance is solitary yin."
Zhenyizi said:
"Solitary yin cannot generate; solitary yang cannot complete."
The *Cantong Qi* states:
"A hen hatching her chicks cannot succeed."
The sage knows that one’s true qi, being postcelestial, yin in nature, is hard to capture and easy to lose.
Thus, one gathers the precelestial One Qi—true yin and true yang, the substances of the two eights united—
Capturing them within a single hour,
Refining them into a grain of utmost yang elixir, called true lead.
This is wrought externally, hence called the outer elixir.
With this yang elixir, one restrains one’s yin mercury,
Like a cat seizing a rat.
The yang elixir is the mother qi of Heaven and Earth;
One’s mercury is the child qi of Heaven and Earth.
When mother qi subdues child qi, is this not union?

This is wrought internally, hence called the inner elixir.
Thus the Immortal Elder said:
"When the elixir meets the qi’s union, it takes form;
The Dao resides in emptiness, merging with nature."

Zhenyizi said:
"Before Heaven and Earth existed in chaos, true lead, attaining the One, was born first,
Gradually giving rise to Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the Five Phases, and the myriad things."
The *Cantong Qi* states:
"Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted."
All these attest to the precelestial One Qi.

With the precelestial yang elixir restraining one’s yin mercury, transforming it into pure yang,
And further employing the fire of yin-yang symbols, applying withdrawal and addition,
After ten months of work, the form transforms into qi, qi into spirit,
Spirit merges with the Dao, becoming formless—
Its transformations unfathomable.
Thus one emerges beyond Heaven and Earth,
Stands beyond the bounds of creation,
Grasps Heaven and Earth, molds yin and yang,
Yet is not molded by yin and yang.
This is the work of the precelestial One Qi—
Such is its marvel.

Hence it is said:
"Nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed."
How could one take the postcelestial, most yin qi-union as the inner elixir?
How could one take postcelestial, mundane cinnabar, mundane mercury, or impure, non-union substances as the outer elixir?

Scholars of the Dao, delve into the root and origin,
Lest you be misled by heterodox teachings and forever fall into the self-inflicted cycle of rebirth.

**Commentary says:**
Even the slightest deviation will prevent the Great Elixir from forming—
As the quatrain says: "A hair’s breadth off, and the elixir fails."
The "two eights" are not a furnace but a metaphor for the furnace.
The furnace is no furnace—such is the furnace.

The outer elixir is congealed into golden cinnabar through the fire of yin-yang ascent and descent; the inner elixir is likewise congealed into the golden liquid reverted cinnabar through the fire of yin-yang ascent and descent. Externally, it is nurtured through symbolic correspondence; internally, it is nurtured through symbolic correspondence. Thus it is said: though the inner elixir differs, its essence is one and the same Dao.

How well put by the Tang immortal in *Attaining the Numinous*:
"People know longevity lies in reverting essence and replenishing qi,
Yet where is cinnabar to be found outside the self?"
This is truly vulgar talk, ignorant of the true realm.
But let me ask: can essence be reverted? Can qi be replenished?
Regulating breath, manipulating the mechanism, exhaling and inhaling—
Is this truly an outward emission and inward absorption?
Where does the return of one’s nature come from, and where does it enter?
Some take exhalation and inhalation as the essence’s flower—
Yet how does this cause the coldness of a broken waist?
Some take the ebb and flow of breath as essence and qi—
Yet how does this lead to the exhaustion of skin and labor?
At the age when one should be in full vigor, one becomes a vessel of decline and decay.
Once the flower of essence is lost, the spirit and soul scatter in four directions—
What then is there to revert?
Those who guard the true qi, long practicing movement to extend their years,
Are but lower-grade earthbound immortals,
Devoid of the power to ascend the void.
Only when one externally refines the fire dragon and internally circulates the golden liquid
Does one truly ascend to the ranks of the loftiest immortals.
Judging by the words of these high immortals,
Cultivating a single element alone will never lead to transcendence.
Now the words are clear, distinguishing inner and outer elixirs,
Yet people still fail to awaken—
Alas, how profoundly distant they are from the Way!

**Second Stanza**
This elixir is most divine, most sagely—
Yet I fear your allotted share is meager and hard to digest.
Harmonizing lead and mercury, the work is not finished by dawn,
But early you shall behold the form of the mysterious pearl.
If a man of resolve can cultivate this,
Why should he not dwell in the marketplace or serve at court?
The practice is easy, the medicine not far—
Yet once revealed, people cannot help but laugh.

**Annotation says:**
Once the golden elixir enters the mouth, one instantly ascends to sagehood—
Is this not the work of the most divine and sagely?
Forged and refined in less than half an hour, the golden elixir’s form appears—
Is this not the simplest and easiest?
Found in every household, unbound by marketplace or court—
Is this not the nearest?
Only because it is most divine, most sagely, most simple, most easy, and most near
Do people, upon hearing it explained, unconsciously laugh.
Those who attain it need only fear their karmic virtue is too shallow to bear the Way—
Scholars, take heed!

**Commentary says:**
The true one’s intent is that the refinement of the golden elixir
Need not be confined to mountains or secluded places—
It can be done amidst the marketplace or the imperial court.
The practice is very easy, the medicine very near.
As long as one finds a place of purity, it can be accomplished.
Thus the poem says:
"Before refining the reverted cinnabar, do not flee to the mountains—
To dwell alone in the deep mountains is futile."
This is because worldly scholars, not understanding the root,
Strive for profit in the marketplace and fame at court,
Yet can still proceed with the work—
Just as one with ten thousand strings of cash can ride a saddle to Shu.
But one must first sever attachment to fame and profit,
Extinguish all cravings,
And enter seclusion for ten months—
Only then can one hope to attain the true.

**Third Stanza**
The White Tiger’s first classic is the supreme treasure;
The Flower Pool’s divine water is true gold.
Thus we know the source of the highest good runs deep—
It is not to be compared with ordinary medicinal substances.
If you wish to refine the nine revolutions,
First refine the self and hold the mind steady.
Follow the seasons in gathering, discerning floating and sinking,
And in advancing the fire, guard against peril.

**Annotation says:**
"First" means the beginning.
The "first classic" refers to the initial menstruation—
Not the celestial water of women.

Do not slander the sacred Dao with the three peaks and twenty-four grades—
The sacred Dao cannot be defiled,
Just as one cannot ascend to heaven by climbing steps.

The true One’s essence:
In heaven, it is called the true One’s water;
In the tiger, it is called the first menstruum’s essence.
Refined in the Flower Pool’s divine water,
This is the supreme treasure, true gold—
All inseparable from the true One’s essence,
Flowing through the myriad barriers under various names.
The *Classic* says, "The highest good is like water,"
For the true One’s water arises before heaven and earth,
Thus called the highest good.
Its source of benefit runs deep and far,
Unlike ordinary post-heaven impure substances.

Nine revolutions are nine years.
After the ten-month embryo is complete and the birth is achieved,
Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years,
Returning west with a single sandal—
There is indeed a reason for this.
Yet to refine the nine revolutions,
First circulate the fire for ten months,
Gather in accordance with the seasons,
Discern floating and sinking,
Distinguish host and guest,
Guard the feminine without asserting the masculine—
Only then can peril be avoided.
Naturally, form transforms into qi,
Qi transforms into spirit.
Embracing the origin and guarding the One,
After nine years, the work is complete:
Form and spirit are both wondrous,
Merging with the Dao in truth.
The sage forcibly names it the nine-revolution golden liquid,
The great return.

**Fourth Stanza**
If you wish to retain true lead and embrace mercury,
Within the household, do not part from the minister.
Wood and metal are separated—
How can they meet without cause?
You must employ a matchmaker to summon them.
Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,
Metal’s sentiment loves wood’s benevolence.
They swallow and devour each other,
Only then do they become intimate.
Only then does the man realize he is with child.

**Annotation says:**
This speaks of the inner image.
The "household minister" is one’s true qi.
One’s true qi congeals because of the golden elixir,
And the golden elixir’s divine efficacy arises from one’s mercury.
The two substances depend on each other,
Their natures yearning for one another,
Thus enabling transformation and spiritual communion.
Hence it is said, "If you wish to retain true lead and embrace mercury,
Within the household, do not part from the minister."
The elixir pertains to metal and is external,
While one’s mercury pertains to wood and is internal.
The two are separated,
Relying entirely on the Yellow Dame to refine and form the elixir.
Once swallowed into the abdomen,
It unites with one’s mercury—
Again, the Yellow Dame summons them.
The two having harmonized and joined,
Yin and yang align with the fire.
Wood’s nature yearns for metal,
Metal’s sentiment yearns for wood.
They swallow and devour each other,
Uniting as husband and wife,
Nurturing the infant within the abdomen.
Only then does the man realize he is with child.
This Dao is most profound and wondrous—
Without benevolence toward all things
And the accumulation of hidden merits,
How could one attain this in this lifetime?

**Fifth Stanza**
Who is the sixteen-year-old maiden of no family?
Who is the twenty-seven-year-old gentleman who calls himself so?
When wood liquid meets metal essence,
The seven directions enable the three natures.
Then, borrowing Ding Gong’s refining,
Husband and wife begin their joyful union.
The river chariot dares not pause—
It transports them straight to Kunlun’s peak.

**Annotation says:**
Sixteen is the yin number;
The "maiden" is one’s true qi.
It is also called "wood liquid."
Twenty-seven is the yang number;
The "gentleman" is one’s yang elixir.
It is also called "metal essence."
When the two merge in the cinnabar field’s earth cauldron,
They form the three sacrifices.
"Ding Gong" is fire;
"Husband and wife" are lead and mercury,
Joined in the cinnabar field’s earth cauldron.
Daily, they unite in the joyful fire of conjugal love,
Refined in the earth cauldron.
Lead and mercury receive this sign,
Generating the substance of golden liquid.
From the tailbone, it ascends straight to the peak of Mud Pill,
Descending into the mouth,
Slowly swallowed back into the cinnabar field’s earth cauldron.
Thus it circulates endlessly,
Like the river chariot’s ceaseless flow,
Transforming into the golden liquid returning elixir.
Master Zhongli said:
"From the tailbone straight up to the peak of Mud Pill,
The river chariot flows freely hundreds of times."
Master Haichan said:
"If yellow sprouts fill the brain’s blood,
Even after ten thousand years, though old, the body does not die."
This is the evidence.

**Commentary says:**
The *Cantong Qi* states:
"Three things, one household, all return to wu and si.
Take metal, wood, and fire as the three things."
It also says:
"When the three natures merge,
They share the same ancestral origin.
Take metal, wood, and fire as the three natures."
All refer to the external medicine’s symbolic method.
Here, speaking of the three positions,
Wood liquid is the internal medicine,
Metal essence is the external medicine.
When they meet earth, the three natures are complete—
This refers to the symbolic method of internal and external.
Thus, the three natures each follow their use.
Those who err take it as "three surnames,"
Which is even more absurd.
For "nature" is the nature of things,
The nature of humans,
The nature of the elixir,
The nature of the five phases—
How could it be a surname?
A verse says:
"Fire arises from Kunlun,
Yin and yang combine within and without."
Kunlun is also called:
"If you encounter Kunlun, go northwest"—
Referring solely to the inner northwest,
The palace of Qian’s trigram where yin and yang interact.
Here, Kunlun specifically denotes Mud Pill.
Thus, the repeated metaphors in the "Three Natures" and "Kunlun" chapters
Cannot be rigidly adhered to.

**Sixth Stanza**
Seven returns of cinnabar,
Nine returns of golden liquid—
Return to the origin, return to truth.
Do not count the hours of yin and yang,
But observe the five phases’ completion as the standard.
It is but a single taste of mercury,
Circulating through all the celestial stems.
When yin and yang’s numbers are complete,
It naturally communicates with the spirit,
Entering and exiting without leaving the mysterious female.

**Annotation on the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions**
The nine returns and seven reversions do not depart from the generative and completive numbers of Heaven and Earth’s five phases. Heaven’s one generates water, and Earth’s six completes it—water resides in the north, accumulating the qi of Kan’s trigram as true water. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states: "Six resides [in the north]." Earth’s two generates fire, and Heaven’s seven completes it—fire returns to the south, nurturing the qi of Li’s trigram to produce cinnabar. Hence, "seven reversions: cinnabar returns to its origin." Heaven’s three generates wood, and Earth’s eight completes it—wood resides in the east, guarding the position of Zhen to form mercury. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states: "Eight returns." Earth’s four generates metal, and Heaven’s nine completes it—metal returns to the west, governing the position of Dui to become gold. Hence, "nine returns: golden liquid returns to truth." Heaven’s five generates earth, and Earth’s ten completes it—two earths unite and dwell in the center, guarding the four images to form the elixir. Thus, the golden elixir is not produced outside the five phases, and so it is said: "Observe only the completion of the five phases as the standard." How can the hours of yin and yang—from *yin* to *shen*—be taken as the seven reversions and nine returns?

Mercury is lead. Lead is the qi of true unity. When the qi of true unity congeals, it forms essence, called the essence of true unity—this is lead essence. The qi of true unity transforms once into water in the north, twice into cinnabar in the south, thrice into mercury in the east, four times into gold in the west, and five times into earth in the center. Thus, the golden elixir is not born without Heaven and Earth, not produced without the sun and moon, not perfected without the four seasons, not accomplished without the five phases, and not completed without the total number. Therefore, circulating through all the celestial stems, when the numbers of yin and yang are complete, it naturally communicates with the spirit and transforms. Yet its wondrous workings of entry and exit never depart from the gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. The principle of the Mysterious Female has already been expounded in *The Gate of the Mysterious Female*, though few in the world understand its annotation.

**Exegesis**
The common view that from *yin* to *shen* constitutes the seven reversions, and from *zi* to *kun* the nine returns, is mistaken. Zhang Ziyang’s annotation of the *Cantong Qi* states: "Water, fire, metal, wood, and earth are the five phases. Water and fire are the sun and moon; metal and wood are the dragon and tiger. Earth corresponds to Heaven and Earth. When refined, they form the golden elixir." Thus, Heaven’s water, six, resides in the north, accumulating Kan as water; Heaven’s wood, eight, resides in the east, guarding Zhen to become cinnabar; Heaven’s fire, seven, returns to the south, belonging to Li as mercury; Heaven’s metal, nine, returns to the west, transforming Dui into gold; Heaven’s earth, five, returns to the center to form the elixir. The qi transforms once into water, twice into cinnabar, thrice into mercury, four times into gold, and five times into the elixir. From this, we know that the elixir is not born without Heaven and Earth, not perfected without the sun and moon, not completed without the four seasons, and not accomplished without the five phases. Refining the body of pure yang into the form of true gold, the meanings of "six resides," "seven reversions," "eight returns," and "nine returns" can then be discerned. This is why the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, the divine immortals, and the sages prized it. Master Wuming’s annotation clarifies the original text: "These celestial stems" refer to the positions of the seventy-two stems, which embody the meaning of the seven reversions and nine returns.

**Seventh Stanza**
Within the male lies the female’s essence,
True yin yet embraces yang’s essence.
When the two harmonize, the medicine is formed—
Transforming the soul and spirit, the sage is realized.
Trust in the golden elixir’s single grain:
A serpent’s swallow transfigures into dragon’s form,
A fowl’s feast becomes the phoenix’s flight,
Soaring into the sacred realm of true yang.

**Annotation**
The male’s inner female is the dragon’s *qi*—mercury. The yin embracing yang is the tiger’s *qi*—lead. When these two substances unite, the numinous elixir is spontaneously born. Swallowed into the abdomen, it transforms the yang soul to dissolve the yin spirit. A single grain, like a millet seed, when a chicken devours a serpent or swallows it whole, becomes a dragon or phoenix, ascending into the sacred realm of true yang. How divine is the medicine’s sanctity!

**Eighth Stanza**
As Heaven and Earth pass through closure and union,
Dawn and dusk must recognize the wheels’ convergence.
Like waters flowing to the sea, the mystery lies in withdrawal and addition.
Attain the One, and ten thousand affairs are complete—
Discern south and north, east and west,
Diminish and diminish again, guarding past merit.
The life-treasure must not be lightly handled.

**Annotation**
The method of firing the elixir begins with effort at *Zhun* and ends with rest at *Pi-Tai*. Day and night, one moves the fire talismans into the crucible, like a wheel’s spokes converging at the hub, or the hundred rivers flowing to the sea. Such is the wondrous work of withdrawal and addition.

The *Daode Jing* states: "Attain the One, and ten thousand affairs are complete." How profound is this saying! The One is the essence of true unity. The qi of true unity generates yin and yang; yin and yang generate the four images; the four images generate the five phases; the five phases generate the myriad things—all do not depart from the transformations of the qi of true unity. Thus, the essence of true unity is the mother of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of yin and yang, the root of the four images, the foundation of the five phases, and the basis of the myriad things. Attaining this One, the ten thousand affairs are complete. East, west, south, and north may all be forgotten. Diminish and diminish again, guarding past merit, to fully grasp the One’s mystery. For the One has form: it is shaped by the firing of yin and yang’s two fires. Once a single grain is swallowed into the five viscera, as before, one must cautiously apply the yin and yang fire talismans to fully return to the One’s mystery. Beware of peril and danger—do not act lightly, lest the life-treasure’s mysterious pearl be lost. Thus, it is said: "Guard past merit."

**Exegesis**
Effort begins at *Zhun-Meng*, employing the sixty-four hexagrams in a month. Rest concludes at *Pi-Tai*, with bathing at the second and eighth months—this is the inner medicine’s symbolic method. Attaining the One is the outer medicine’s symbolic method. Lü Dongbin’s song states: "The Three Mao Lords are called the One." The *Daode Jing* speaks of "diminishing": now, in the tenth month of practice, one diminishes affairs and extinguishes thoughts, guarding against danger and peril. Not a single hair’s weight of the mind should be attached, lest the life-treasure be lost, like an infant in the womb. Forgetting the self’s existence within the Heaven and Earth crucible, one can perpetually maintain clarity. Heaven and Earth are wholly subsumed, and thus the perfected person repeatedly exhorts: "Diminish and diminish again, guarding past merit."

**Ninth Stanza**
At winter solstice, the first yang returns—
Three decades add one yang line.
In the moon’s mid-reversal, the *Fu* hexagram appears;
From dawn to dusk, cease *Qian* and *Gou*’s signs.
Days alternate in cold and heat—
Yang revives at *Fu*, rising at midnight;
*Gou*’s image at noon, a single yin dawns.
In refining the medicine, know the twilight’s hour.

**Annotation**
The winter solstice gives birth to the first yang, forming the *Fu* hexagram—this is its single yang line. After thirty days, it becomes the *Lin* hexagram, adding a second yang line. After another thirty days, it becomes the *Tai* hexagram, adding a third yang line. After another thirty days, it becomes the *Dazhuang* hexagram, adding a fourth yang line. After another thirty days, it becomes the *Guai* hexagram, adding a fifth yang line. After another thirty days, it becomes the *Qian* hexagram, completing the six yang lines—this is the fullness of the yang fire’s season.

When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises—thus at the summer solstice, the first yin is born, forming the *Gou* hexagram, its single yin line. Just as before, after thirty days, a second yin line is added, forming the *Dun* hexagram; then the *Pi* hexagram; then the *Guan* hexagram; then the *Bo* hexagram; and finally the *Kun* hexagram, completing the six yin lines—this is the fullness of the yin tally’s season. When yin reaches its extreme, yang revives once more, cycling endlessly. These are the great numbers of a year’s qi’s waxing and waning.

The sage transposes this yearly cycle of qi into a single month: the new moon’s dawn is *Fu*, and the full moon is pure yang. Two and a half days correspond to thirty days—this is one month. The full moon is pure *Qian*; by the sixteenth day, *Gou*’s single yin is born. Thus it is said: “At the full moon’s end, *Gou*’s sign appears,” for yin first sprouts as a portent. This is the great number of a month’s qi, the celestial cycle.

The sage further transposes this monthly cycle into a single day, dividing it into the four seasons’ qi of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. Thus at midnight’s *zi* hour, the first yang is born as the *Fu* hexagram; after noon, the first yin is born as the *Gou* hexagram. In applying the tally fire, the ascent and descent of yin and yang—drawing out, adding, advancing, and retreating—each aligns with heaven and earth’s four seasons and the rise and fall of yin and yang, without the slightest deviation. Thus it is said: “In refining the medicine, know the twilight’s hour.” Twilight is the beginning of yin and yang—this is the great number of a day’s qi, the celestial cycle.

**Commentary:**
A great celestial cycle of one year is the ascent and descent of heaven and earth. Heaven and earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*; divided into six nodes, earth’s yin conceals yang. From the summer solstice, the zenith of heaven’s yin qi descends through six nodes to earth, where yin and yang transform and ascend and descend in one cycle—this is one year. The sage models this with the twelve hexagrams’ doubled six lines: the yang fire from *zi* to *si* grows as yin wanes. Thus the outer adheres to yang, the inner to yin, both aligning with the dominant force. Yin’s softness is internal, yang’s hardness external—not the hexagram’s inherent inner and outer. Therefore, *Fu* and *Gou* are the lesser parents, rooted in *Qian* and *Kun*, to clarify the tally fire’s waxing and waning.

A small celestial cycle of one month is the conjunction of the sun and moon’s defenses. The moon receives the sun’s light, becoming full and waning, without mention of the sun, though the sun is implicit. One month is divided into five days as one *hou*, six *hou* as one month—this too is a division of yin and yang into nodes. The moon’s waxing and waning complete one cycle in a month. The sage uses the eight precelestial hexagrams, excluding *Kan* and *Li* as the sun and moon’s bodies, their phases also divided into six *hou* with six hexagrams’ pure three lines as models. The celestial tally is invisible, revealed through the sun and moon: a yang line symbolizes the *hun*’s birth, a yin line the *po*’s birth. The *hun* is born until the full moon, completing *Qian*; the *po* is born until the dark moon, completing *Kun*. Five days make one *hou*; each *hou* advances one line. In the month’s first half, yang lines advance; in the latter half, yin lines advance, aligning with the moon’s waxing and waning. The celestial stems *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* correspond to the moon’s twilight and dawn directions, hence the six hexagrams’ received stems. The empty *ren* is *Li* within *Qian*; the empty *gui* is *Kan* within *Kun*. Yang *ren* and yin *gui* are the northern darkness’s land—hidden in use, obscure and unseen. *Kan*’s *wu* and *Li*’s *si* are the sun and moon’s bodies—*wu* and *si* face the light’s direction, where the sun and moon display benevolence, shining brightly and visibly. Together, the six empties complete the ten stems; the ten stems complete the five phases—this is the Supreme Polarity before division.

Before the new moon, at the *zi* hour, the sun is at *zi* and the moon at *gui*; after the new moon, at the *zi* hour, the moon is at *ren* and the sun at *zi*—hidden in use within *ren* and *gui*. Before the new moon, at the *wu* hour, the sun is at *wu* and the moon at *si*; *si* is received in *ding*. After the new moon, at the *wu* hour, the sun is at *wu* and the moon at *wu*; *wu* is received in *bing*—displaying benevolence in *wu* and *si*. At the new moon’s conjunction, they unite at *zi* and *wu*.

If one further divides the year’s twelve hexagrams into six *hou*, each *hou* contains two hexagrams. At the month’s beginning, it grows from *Kun*’s dark moon to *Tai*—this is the upper *ji*, *Qian* and *Kun*’s *jiji*. At the month’s waning, it declines from *Kun*’s full moon to *Pi*—this is the lower *ji*, *Qian* and *Kun*’s *weiji*. *Qian* and *Kun* come and go, aligning with yin and yang’s advance and retreat. *Pi* and *Tai* ascend and descend, aligning with yin and yang’s equal halves. Thus it is said: “The upper *ji* is half a *jin* of metal; the lower *ji* is half a *jin* of water.”

The sun rises at *jia-mao* and sets at *geng-you*; the moon’s fullness begins at *Zhen*’s *geng* and wanes at *Qian*’s *jia*. At the winter solstice’s *zi*, the day gradually lengthens; at the summer solstice’s *wu*, the day gradually shortens. The moon’s yang retreats: from the new moon’s *zi*, it advances; from the full moon’s *wu*, it retreats. At heaven and earth’s center, the suspended images’ brilliance is unmatched by the sun and moon. The sun and moon are qi—having form but no substance, they interact without obstruction. Yang embraces yin to form the sun; yin embraces yang to form the moon. Thus in a single moment’s mystery or half a year’s duration, all may be taken as models.

Metal and water are each half—this is the initial *ji*’s essence. The initial *ji*’s qi is supremely clear and unclouded—it has qi but no form. Measuring the year by the moon, one month of thirty days corresponds to a year’s three hundred sixty hours, each hour matching one day. Two and a half days—thirty hours—correspond to one month. A small deficiency lacks twelve hours; thus within fifteen days, adjustments are made—this is the month’s compensation for the day’s account.

Therefore, *Qian* and *Kun* are the great parents, employed through *Kan* and *Li* to clarify the tally fire’s advance and retreat. A day’s celestial cycle, a month’s lunar waxing and waning, and a year’s yin-yang ascent and descent—great and small celestial cycles of creation are all the same. Measuring a year by a single hour, one month is evenly divided into two qi. Thus *zi* is the eleventh month; *ren* is *Great Snow*; *zi* is winter—this is rooted in *Qian* and *Kun*, taking the day as the year.

Measuring a month by a single hour, two and a half days—two hours—make one *hou*; six hours make one qi, half a month. Measuring the day by the hour: *mao* corresponds to the eighth day’s upper *ji*; *you* to the twenty-second day’s lower *ji*; *hai* to the dark moon; *zi* to the new moon; *si* to the full moon; *wu* to the waning. This employs *Kan* and *Li*, taking the day as the month, to clarify the tally fire’s waxing and waning, advance and retreat, uniting the year, month, and day’s three celestial cycles as one. Modeling creation with sixty hexagrams, all are the same. Excluding the four *yin* and *yang* hexagrams, heaven and earth, sun and moon envelop the myriad things yet are unused. Combining the sixty-four hexagrams’ three hundred eighty-four lines yields the weight of one *jin*—the two *pian*’s tally, with the four hexagrams’ use contained within.

The Great Celestial Cycle fundamentally arises from *Qian* and *Kun*. Modeling creation with Fu Xi’s hexagram chart, the Small Celestial Cycle’s waxing and waning of *Taiyin* likewise corresponds, with *Kan* and *Li* in accord—this too constitutes the Small Celestial Cycle, employing *Kan* and *Li*. Modeling with King Wen’s hexagram chart, the Great Celestial Cycle’s rhythms of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, *Qian* and *Kun*’s flowing course, are also in harmony. Thus, the year’s *Fu* is the month’s *Zhen*; the year’s *Gou* is the month’s *Pi*. The day’s *Fu* is the hour’s *zi*; the day’s *Gou* is the hour’s *wu*. From this, it is evident that *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are never without use; the great and small parents are never absent. Fundamentally rooted in *Qian* and *Kun*, *Qian* and *Kun* become the entire body of *Kan* and *Li*; employed through *Kan* and *Li*, *Kan* and *Li* become the central *qi* of *Qian* and *Kun*. Heaven and earth are the sun and moon; the sun and moon are heaven and earth. Heaven conceals *yin* while the sun contains *yang*; earth conceals *yang* while the moon contains *yin*. The forms of heaven, earth, sun, and moon vary in size; the functions of years, months, days, and hours differ in duration. Yet when considered together, all are the unmanifest completion of the Supreme Polarity.

Once divided, from *Zhun* and *Pi* to *Ji Ji*, the sixty hexagrams are employed in pairs to correspond to a single day; the full sixty hexagrams correspond to a month, totaling six hundred *pian* to match a year. In their smallness, even within a single hour, they harmonize with the three hundred sixty. One hour comprises one *miao*; twelve *miao* make one *fen*; thirty *fen* total three hundred sixty *miao* to complete an hour. The wondrous function of this single hour is the immortal’s stolen mechanism, beyond the ken of worldly men. Thus, the greatness of a year, the smallness of a month, the fleeting *miao* of a day, the profound function of an hour—all follow heaven’s Dao, the flourishing of the myriad things, the images of heaven, earth, sun, and moon, their ascent and descent, waxing and waning—none transcend this. How vast is the *Yi*! This is its ultimate.

**[Right: Clarifying Fire Phases]**

Ten—if one cannot distinguish the Five Phases and Four Images, how can one discern cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver? Before ever hearing of the fire phases in the cultivation of the elixir, one rashly utters grand claims. None pause to reflect on their own errors; instead, they persist in teaching misguided paths, leading others astray and leaving them lost in the eternal ford. How can such deceitful hearts endure without remorse?

**Annotation:** The ten thousand scrolls of elixir classics find their wonder in the *Cantong Qi*. Within it, the chapter "Song of the Tripod and Vessel" is the very marrow of the elixir canon. Yet none among those who study this Way today can fathom it—why do they not ponder this deeply? Let them test this song against my own attainment: if it remains unclear, then my own attainment is not yet perfected. Why, then, do they remain deluded by heterodox schools and false teachings?

Today’s scholars, ignorant of the method of "expelling the old and gathering the new," instead indulge in fantasies of soaring clouds and racing mists. They exalt themselves, imitate others, and, unaware of their own regrets and losses, mislead others into drowning in the ford of delusion—incurable for a lifetime, dying without achievement. How can such deceitful hearts endure without remorse?

**Ye Shu says:** The Nameless Master took the "Song of the Tripod and Vessel" in the *Cantong Qi* as the marrow of the elixir classics, yet many overlook it and fail to investigate deeply. How, then, can they awaken to the great Dao of the true golden elixir?

From the perfected beings I have encountered, I obtained the essentials of two texts, wherein the Five Phases, Four Images, cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver are used to lure the primordial, undifferentiated qi of true yin and true yang. They do not employ heterodox methods or the conditioned things born of later heaven and earth. Their transformative principles and symbolic patterns are all the same, yet the effects of their fire phases, timings, and the inner and outer elixirs differ.

Through three lifetimes of karmic affinity, I have heard the great Dao. Though I risk celestial punishment by revealing these secrets in writing—first in the *Wuzhen Pian* annotations, then in the *Cantong Qi* commentaries, and now in the *Xuexian Zhengzong*—I do so to dispel confusion for later learners. On the one hand, I clarify the truth of the immortal’s path; on the other, I refute the errors of heterodox schools. May those who study the immortal’s arts, by my words, avoid delusion, trust the immortal’s texts, not stray into heterodoxy, not err in their own cultivation, and not mislead others.

If you encounter a true teacher whose words align with mine, with the *Cantong Qi*, and with the *Wuzhen Pian*, then act swiftly to cultivate together and achieve the great Dao. I do not seek to stand apart to impress the vulgar; I only wish to illuminate the orthodox lineage of the immortal’s path.

The Perfected One, reading the *Cantong Qi*, said: "Do not cling to images or adhere to words." This was spoken for those who have already received the true transmission from a master. Images are set forth as metaphors, words are used to convey meaning—both are but nets and traps, not to be rigidly grasped. As for those who have not met a true teacher or received the true transmission, who wander into heterodox schools and mistake them for the truth, unaware of the great Dao—how can they, in their arrogance, take the Perfected One’s words about not clinging to images as an excuse to avoid seeking profound understanding? If one knows this, one may go a lifetime without hearing the Way spoken of.

Chen Niniu said:
*"If you have not yet met a teacher, study the poems—*
*Within their lines, the secrets lie for steadfast cultivation."*
And again:
*"Without shared language, no bond is formed;*
*Without sufficient effort, no skill is rounded."*
Only when every word is thoroughly examined, when the text is mastered from beginning to end, and when my learning aligns perfectly without a single discrepancy, do I dare not cite heterodox or false teachings as evidence. With diligent effort over time, the numinous will naturally come, and the enlightened heart will spontaneously awaken.

Wei Boyang said: *"After ten thousand recitations, the numinous may be glimpsed;*
*Even if it reveals itself to others, one may still seek meaning in the text."*
Why insist on my humble oral instruction? Through persistent effort over time, my gains from the immortal’s texts have only grown. Thus, I offer this to encourage one another.

Virtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred,
hidden merits accumulated reach three thousand—
only when self and others, kin and foe are equalized
does one fulfill the original vow of the immortals.

Tigers and rhinos, blades and weapons cannot harm;
impermanence’s burning house cannot entangle.
Once the sacred talisman descends,
ascending to heaven is as steady as riding the jade carriage and phoenix palanquin.

*Annotation:* Embracing the One for nine years, merit is perfected and the Dao complete—
when self and others are both forgotten,
how could blades, weapons, tigers, or rhinos bring harm?
The celestial talisman descends, the body soars to the azure vault—
this is the day the true great man emerges from the world.
This speaks of the Golden Elixir’s return:
only when virtue and hidden merits—eight hundred and three thousand—are fully rounded
can one be safeguarded from demonic obstacles.
Cultivating according to the method, one ascends in transcendence,
mounting the jade carriage and phoenix palanquin
to become a perfected immortal, a guest of the Supreme Emperor.

The Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s karmic bond is the Dao’s foundation,
coiled like serpents, endowed by nature.
The toad and crow meet at the new moon [or: the dark of the moon],
uniting in beauty—
the two qi mutually nourish, revolving in motion.
All is the marvelous function of Heaven and Earth:
who comprehends this true essence?
When yin and yang are obstructed, fault arises—
how then can the enduring vastness of heaven and earth be attained?

*Annotation:* The Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet once a year;
the moon’s yin and the sun’s yang unite once a month.
The tortoise and snake, the coiled dragon and serpent, support one another—
all are made so by the two qi of yin and yang.
This is truly the root of the Dao,
the workings of the Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar—
each step mirrors it.
For the true One’s qi is profound and formless;
only when the initial qi of the two eights—yin and yang—conjoin
can it descend to shape the grain-like form of the elixir.

Once the elixir is ingested,
without the intertwining embrace of the firing process,
how can the transmutation into the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir be achieved?
Alas!

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The osprey calls on the river isle—
the fair maiden, the gentleman’s fine match.
The male does not dwell alone,
the female does not abide in solitude.
The dark warrior and coiled serpent support one another,
illustrating how the female and male must invariably rely on each other—
such is the principle’s dwelling.
What doubt remains?"*

Inverting the practice, the cosmos lies within the palm of your hand.
A certain master said:
*"Solitary yin cannot generate,
lone yang cannot complete.
Only by borrowing the union of female and male qi
can the Way of production and transformation arise."*

That Heaven and Earth endure long and abide in permanence
is due to the natural Dao of yin-yang intercourse.
If Heaven did not descend and Earth did not ascend,
the four seasons would not follow their order,
and the myriad things would not come to be.
Thus, the immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes this chapter,
for those who deeply grasp its meaning may unite with it in spirit.

---

Another verse, symbolizing the intercalary month:
The elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body,
refined to achieve boundless transformation.
Further, on the nature, investigate the true source—
the decisive insight into life and death’s marvelous function.
No need to await another body in a future life:
here and now, attain the Buddha’s divine powers.
Ever since the Dragon Girl accomplished this work,
who has been able to follow in her footsteps?

*Annotation:*
The Golden Elixir can transform the formed into the formless,
thus enabling infinite transmutation—
profound and unfathomable as the dragon’s manifestation.
If one can additionally recognize the mind and see the nature,
dispelling illusory delusions to expand divine powers,
then the Dao of both nature and life becomes doubly perfected,
form and spirit both wondrous.
This path grows ever more refined,
transcending the leakless to become a body of indestructible vajra—
the supreme Great Dao.

Thus, the immortal elder said:
If one realizes the true gold of the wondrously colored body,
one certifies the true gold of compassionate appearance—
majestic and dignified, a teacher of gods and humans,
demonstrating divine powers,
universally manifesting across the Dharma realms,
wielding unimpeded great compassion,
equal wisdom,
and adorned Buddha-lands,
widely proclaiming the wondrous Dharma to universally deliver sentient beings.
Yet this must be coupled with recognizing the mind and seeing the nature
to refine this Dao.

Formerly, the Dragon Girl suddenly awakened to the mind-jewel
and transcended into Buddha-nature—
this is that very Dao.
If, however, a practitioner disdains this illusory form,
unable to cultivate the Golden Elixir,
and instead seeks to directly transcend into the Tathāgata’s true emptiness,
serene and eternally quiescent—
this is the ultimate nirvana of the three times—
then such words, such bodily forms, are not to be adopted.

---

Five quatrains, symbolizing the five phases of lead, mercury, cinnabar, silver, and earth:

*"Though you comprehend the true suchness of nature,
you cannot escape discarding the body only to re-enter it.
If you understand and further refine the Great Elixir,
you instantly transcend the leakless and become a true person."*

*Annotation:*
If one suddenly awakens to the true mind
and directly transcends into the Tathāgata’s true emptiness,
the ocean of pure quiescent nature,
one is ultimately bound to this life and the next,
exiting one body and entering another.
How is this superior to cultivating the Golden Elixir,
refining form into the formless,
achieving unfathomable transformation,
and attaining the responsiveness of a thousand hands and eyes?
Thus, in the Dao of form, spirit, nature, and life,
one perfects them both,
transcends the leakless,
and possesses the majestic and dignified true gold of compassion,
a teacher of gods and humans,
certifying the supreme, utmost truth.

Before the great function manifests,
before the great Dharma is fully illuminated,
even the slightest leakage—
discarding the body to re-enter it—
persists.
If the jewel is fully bright and illuminated,
the treasure refined into the Golden Elixir,
the Dao accomplished in its ten extremities,
one is called a true person.

The deluded of the world,
with their rubbing, swallowing, and exhaling,
their minor arts of aligning oneself with others,
call it the Golden Elixir.
Yet the Golden Elixir arises naturally,
while minor arts arise from contrivance.
The Golden Elixir takes the moon as its root,
emerging from the direction of metal’s seventh branch,
guarded by the origin of water’s kan trigram.
Metal and water unite,
congealing into creation—
this is why it is called the Golden Elixir.

*Exegesis:*
Cultivating both nature and life is called the Dao of one yin and one yang.
If one only awakens to the past but cannot complete life,
one falls into the illness of partial yin or partial yang,
suffering the affliction of discarding the body to re-enter it.

**Two: Entering the Womb, Seizing the Dwelling, and Relocating the Old Abode—**
these are called the Four Fruits,
yet how can they compare to subduing the dragon and taming the tiger,
or the true gold erecting a house—when will it ever wither?

*Annotation:*
When has true gold erecting a house ever withered?
The *Scripture on Saving the Dead* says:
*"Even withered bones revive and rise to become people—
how much more so for those who swallow the pearl-like grain of the elixir?"*
Entering the womb, seizing the dwelling—
the Four Fruits are merely the ghosts of yin spirits.
The *Daoguang* says:
*"Entering the womb and seizing the dwelling are the practices of those clinging to emptiness;
subduing the dragon and taming the tiger are the wonders of the Returned Elixir."*

*Exegesis:*
Yin spirits generate consciousness,
enter the mother’s womb to be born into the world.
Seizing the dwelling: another’s consciousness has already entered the womb,
and one seizes it to be born.
Relocating: borrowing the birth-body of a transformed person
and investing one’s consciousness into it.
The old abode: preserving the nature of the yin spirit
to sustain the bodily form without entering extinction—
the Four Fruits all lack the Golden Elixir’s transmutation,
their transformations entirely those of yin spirits.

**Three: Mirroring the Form, Closing the Breath, and Contemplating the Spirit—**
a method initially arduous,
later a smooth path.
In an instant, one can roam ten thousand miles,
yet alas—
the house is broken, and one must relocate.

*Annotation:*
Mirroring the form, closing the breath, contemplating the spirit—
these are minor methods of the Hinayana, the arts of yin spirits.
Initially, they are exceedingly difficult,
but with practice, one becomes proficient and unobstructed.
In a flash, one can traverse myriad lands—
such is the marvelous clarity of their numinous spirit.
Yet alas, their form belongs to yin,
the bodily shell difficult to secure, easy to decay,
inevitably leading to entering the womb or seizing the dwelling,
like relocating.

*Exegesis:*
Mirroring the form: suspending a mirror in the chamber,
concentrating the spirit within it to depart.
Closing the breath: sealing the body’s qi
as if one were unborn, in the womb—
placing a goose feather on the nose,
if it remains unmoved for twelve breaths, it is a minor art;
for one hundred and twenty breaths, a major art.
If one can reach a thousand, ascension is near—
as in Bodhidharma’s *Treatise on Embryonic Breathing*,
the *Regulations for Inhalation and Exhalation in the Three Vehicles’ Seated Meditation*,
or exiting through dhyāna.
Contemplating the spirit: concentrating the spirit in one locus—
whether between the brows, atop the head,
the thirty-nine doors of the Great Cavern,
or the inner and outer qi of the Yellow Court—
or cultivating the sixteen contemplations to depart.
All these lack the Golden Elixir’s transmutation,
their transformations entirely those of yin spirits.

**Four: The Buddha’s Teachings Guide People to Cultivate the Pure Land—**
only because the Pure Land is the golden realm,
where forms alone are real.
The other two are not true—
why speculate in vain?

*Annotation:*
The Western Pure Land is the direction of metal,
the true land of the Buddha’s body.
The Eastern and Northern Pure Lands are illusory,
not the true Dharma-body’s abode.
Thus, the Buddha taught sentient beings to cultivate the Western Pure Land,
for it alone is the true golden realm.

A Note states: The Western Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss lies in the west—the direction of metal—where only the Golden Elixir, a single grain like a millet seed weighing one catty, is produced. The Buddha consumes it, hence his sixteen-foot golden body and wondrous physical marks, which likewise arise from the Golden Elixir’s transformation. The sixteen-foot measure follows the numerology of two eights; the west is metal. Yet none in the world comprehend this. An ancient immortal once declared:

*"I ask you, who is this Gautama?*
*Dwelling in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss,*
*where two eights yield the essence of gold—*
*from this, the sixteen-foot golden body is attained.*
*If one can empty this illusory form,*
*directly receiving the true method of the sages,*
*then in an instant, having swallowed the millet-pearl,*
*one transforms into a vajra-body in a moment."*

These words exhaust the matter; beyond this, all other discussions are mere idle speculation.

**Five:**
Common sayings often declare: To attain the supreme Dao, one ought to seek it within the subtle workings of the ordinary. By inverting the search within daily life, the dust and sand of the great earth all become treasures.

A Note states: True lead and true mercury are not apart from common speech, everyday affairs, or the intervals of daily life. Cultivating them in inversion, the dust and sand of the great earth all become treasures.

The song on the right says:
*Day after day, only within your household dwelling,*
*moment by moment, following you wherever you go—*
*yet you remain unaware.*

To read the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*:
The wondrous workings of the Great Elixir follow Qian and Kun.
Qian and Kun move—thus the Five Agents divide;
the Five Agents divide—thus the constant Dao has arising and ceasing.
When the Five Agents reverse, the elixir’s body is ever numinous, ever preserved.
The One first appears from emptiness and nonbeing;
the Two Modes arise from the One, their root unfolds.
The Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies;
the Eight Trigrams mutually serve as ancestor and descendant.
The myriad things are born through transformation—
fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are thus distinguished.
The common folk use this daily yet remain unaware;
the sage alone can fathom its source.
Thus the marvelous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun,
and so entrusts its images to this text.
When Pi and Tai intermingle, yin and yang now ascend, now descend;
when Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk.
Kan and Li are male and female;
water and fire.
Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger;
po and hun.
Abiding in the center yields the Yellow Skirt—supreme fortune;
encountering Kang brings positionless honor.
Yet if one fails to attend to the beginning and end of the myriad things,
how can the convergence of the two qi be made manifest?
The waxing and waning of the moon’s crescent respond to the waning and waxing of spirit and essence;
the sun’s rising and setting accord with the cold and warmth of construction and defense.
The root establishes words to clarify images;
once images are grasped, words are forgotten.
It is like setting up images to point to meaning—
once meaning is awakened to, images are discarded.
The enlightened find it ever simpler, ever easier;
the deluded grow ever more confused, ever more entangled.
Thus the superior adept who reads the *Cantong Qi*
does not cling to images or grasp at words.

A Note states:
Qian and Kun are father and mother.
Qian and Kun move—yin and yang qi transform into the Five Agents and give birth to the myriad things.
Thus, following yin and yang and the Five Agents in their molding, one becomes human.
The human body is half yin, half yang because yin and yang take form.
Being half yin and half yang, it is subject to arising and ceasing.
Yang governs arising, yin governs ceasing—
one arises, one ceases; one departs, one arrives.
This is the constant Dao, the natural principle of following the flow.
The sage, reversing this, applies yin and yang in inversion,
establishing Qian and Kun as the cauldron and vessel,
stealing the primordial One Qi to forge the elixir.
Refining form into formlessness, one merges with the Dao and guards the One.
The Dao arises from Non-Ultimate—how could immortality have an end?
Thus it is said: following the constant Dao brings arising and ceasing;
reversing the elixir’s body yields everlasting numinosity and preservation.
Emptiness and nonbeing are the body of the Dao.
The Dao generates the One Qi, which then transforms into yin and yang—
thus yang is Heaven, yin is Earth: these are the Two Modes.
Heaven One generates Water, dwelling in the north—this is winter;
Earth Two generates Fire, dwelling in the south—this is summer;
Heaven Three generates Wood, dwelling in the east—this is spring;
Earth Four generates Metal, dwelling in the west—this is autumn.
These form the four seasons, called the Four Images.
Heaven is Qian, dwelling in Xu and Hai;
Earth is Kun, dwelling in Wei and Shen.
Kun seeks Qian and gives birth to three sons:
the eldest is Zhen, dwelling in Mao;
the middle is Kan, dwelling in Zi;
the youngest is Gen, dwelling in Yin and Chou.
Qian seeks Kun and gives birth to three daughters:
the eldest is Xun, dwelling in Chen and Si;
the middle is Li, dwelling in Wu;
the youngest is Dui, dwelling in You.
Together they form the Eight Trigrams, called the eight directions.
Thus from Zi to Si is the yang realm;
from Wu to Hai is the yin realm.
As yin and yang revolve, the qi of the four seasons cycle through the eight directions,
mutually completing and beginning anew—
hence they are said to serve as ancestor and descendant.
In spring and summer, yang qi arises and grows—
the myriad things receive its power and flourish.
In autumn and winter, yin qi contracts and kills—
the myriad things receive its punishment and wither.
One flourishing, one withering; one fortune, one misfortune—
thus the myriad things are born through transformation,
and fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are thereby distinguished.
Tracing the origins of fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—
from the myriad images and Eight Trigrams to the four seasons and yin and yang—
nothing departs from the One Qi or strays from the Great Dao.
Thus the Dao is the One Qi;
yin and yang, the four seasons, the Five Agents, the Eight Trigrams,
the myriad images, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—
where are they not present?
Nowhere are they absent.

Wherever one looks—seeing, hearing, speaking, moving, sleeping, waking, every gesture, every contact, whether pure or clamorous, strange or cunning, whether worm-liver or rat-limb, tare or chaff, tile or pebble—there is nowhere the Dao is not. Nowhere is the Dao not, yet the Dao resides within humanity while humanity remains unaware; humanity dwells within the Dao while the Dao does not exclude it. Thus the common people use it daily yet do not know it.

From emptiness and stillness to daily use, they speak of the Dao without knowing it. The sage explores the profound, seeks the hidden, exhausts principle and fulfills nature to reach destiny. Thus they were able to compose the *Yi*, embodying the Dao’s wondrous workings, establishing Qian and Kun as the *Yi*’s gateways. Once Qian and Kun are established, the Dao of the *Yi* moves within them.

Thus Qian and Kun seek each other and form the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams follow one another and transform into the sixty-four hexagrams. Each hexagram has six lines: yang lines are odd, yin lines are even. Each single yang line, multiplied by four and nine, yields thirty-six *fang*; six yang lines together yield two hundred sixteen *fang*—these are Qian’s *fang*. Each single yin line, multiplied by four and six, yields twenty-four *fang*; six yin lines together yield one hundred forty-four *fang*—these are Kun’s *fang*. Adding the thirty-two *fang* of Qian and Kun’s two hexagrams, three hundred sixty *fang* combine to form the eleven thousand five hundred twenty *fang* of the Great Expansion of the Supreme Polarity. This encompasses the Three Powers and embraces the myriad images. Thus the ultimate of fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, the omens of life and death, fortune and disaster—none can escape beyond these numbers. Therefore it is said: the wondrous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the substance and function of creation.

Since the sages rectified the substance and function of creation to expound the *Yi*, the Perfected Wei Boyang, seeing that the Dao of the *Yi* accorded with the Golden Elixir, borrowed the hexagrams to compose the *Cantong qi*, illuminating the *fang* of the Golden Elixir. Yet this was nothing more than borrowed imagery and allegory to speak of the *Cantong qi*.

The essentials of elixir refinement do not exceed the two words *metal* and *fire*. The sages first took the two substances of true yin and true yang as the furnace and crucible, then lured the qi of the Supreme Polarity into the midst of emptiness and nothingness—beyond seeking or fathoming. If one does not use true yin and true yang to lure it, one cannot descend the numinous and form the image. Thus the *Cantong qi* establishes the two hexagrams Qian and Kun as the furnace and crucible, divides the two hexagrams Kan and Li as lead and mercury, and arranges the four hexagrams in the central palace. The remaining hexagrams are distributed within a single month to move the tally of fire. Thus Qian and Kun are dragon and tiger; Zhen and Dui are husband and wife.

The *hun* and *po* are also Kan and Li; Kan and Li are lead and mercury, water and fire, male and female, emotion and nature. If one extends this analogy, the implications are boundless. Yet when one seeks the most fitting expression, nothing surpasses the metaphor of the two substances, true yin and true yang. By conjoining these two substances with qi in the central palace—the Yellow Chamber of the Dao—one forms the elixir. Thus it is said: "Abiding in the center, the yellow skirt brings supreme fortune." This speaks of the external medicine.

Once the elixir is obtained and ingested, without true fire there is no way to nurture the sacred embryo or circulate the primordial yang’s true qi as fire. Fire has no fixed position; it flows through the six voids. Thus it is said: "When encountering *Kang*, it has no position yet is revered." This speaks of the internal medicine.

Now, Heaven’s One generates water, which in humans is called *jing*; Earth’s Two generates fire, which in humans is called *shen*. A person’s *jing* and *shen* day and night circulate and guard the body, constantly moving in accord with the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang without cease. On the day of the winter solstice, within Earth there is a single yang’s qi that ascends, forming the hexagram *Fu*. The human’s primordial qi is likewise. Thus, advancing the yang fire until the first month, when the qi of yin and yang are evenly balanced, they naturally conjoin, forming the hexagram *Tai*. The human’s primordial qi is the same. This is why ceasing fire is called "bathing." On the day of the summer solstice, within Heaven there is a single yin’s qi that descends, forming the hexagram *Gou*. Thus, advancing the yin tally until the seventh month, when the qi of yin and yang are evenly balanced, they naturally conjoin, forming the hexagram *Pi*. The human’s primordial qi is likewise. This is why halting the tally is also called "bathing." Thus it is said: when *Pi* and *Tai* alternate, yin and yang either ascend or descend.

The sages transpose this yearly cycle of qi into the span of a single month—thirty days—where two and a half days and thirty hours correspond to one month’s thirty days. From the day after the new moon, when the moon’s first faint light appears, it is the hexagram *Fu*; by the first quarter, when the moon is half-illuminated and metal and water are evenly balanced, it is *Tai*; by the sixteenth day, when the moon begins to wane, it is *Gou*; by the last quarter, when the moon is half-dark and metal and water are again evenly balanced, it is *Pi*. Thus the waxing and waning of the sun and moon correspond to the flourishing and decline of *jing* and *shen*. This speaks of the month.

Further, they transpose this monthly cycle of qi into the span of a single day—twelve hours. At the *zi* hour, one yang arises, so within the kidneys there is a single yang’s pure *jing* qi that ascends, forming *Fu*, and the yang fire is advanced. At the *wu* hour, one yin arises, so within the heart there is a single yin’s numinous *shen* qi that descends, forming *Gou*, and the yin tally is advanced. Thus it is said: *Fu* and *Gou* illuminate the return and flight of the two qi. This speaks of the day.

The sun’s rising marks day, its setting marks night. The sages move the tally and fire within one day and night, distinguishing the qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, externally aligning with Heaven’s tally and internally harmonizing with the *ying* and *wei* to diminish and augment the body’s refinement, operation, warming, and nurturing of the midnight pearl. Thus it is said: the sun’s rising and setting align with the cold and warmth of *ying* and *wei*. This speaks of the day.

*Zi* is the chief of the six yang, so at dawn the yang fire is advanced, employing the hexagram *Zhun* to govern the matter. *Wu* is the origin of the six yin, so at dusk the yin tally is advanced, employing the hexagram *Meng* to govern the matter. Thus it is said: *Zhun* and *Meng* act, so movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk.

One day and night govern two hexagrams, *Zhun* and *Meng*, the beginning of the sixty hexagrams. *Jiji* is not the end of the sixty hexagrams; the end returns to the beginning, the beginning returns to the end. Thus it is said: "In *Jiji*, be cautious of the end and beginning of the myriad things." This speaks of the hours.

All the above are Master Wei’s [methods of] employing the great Dao of the golden elixir—most simple, most easy—where no profound secrets can be expounded. Thus he borrowed the images of the *Yijing* to establish meaning and convey teachings, enabling students to observe these hexagrams and awaken to their essentials. If one attains the wondrous subtleties of the golden elixir, then the analogies of Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, dragon and tiger, *hun* and *po*, lead and mercury, water and fire can all be discarded. This speaks of the external borrowing of images.

If one attains the true mechanism of moving fire, then the hexagrams *Zhun*, *Meng*, *Jiji*, *Gou*, *Pi*, and *Tai*, along with their lines and fractions, can all be rendered useless. This speaks of the internal borrowing of images.

This is how the Immortal Elder, fearing that students reading the *Cantong qi* would fail to grasp the profound intent of the True Man and instead cling to images and adhere to words without relinquishing images and forgetting words, composed this piece to instruct like-minded seekers. His benevolence is thus. The *Song of the Elder of Qingcheng* says: "I thank the former sages for their secret formulas—true fish-traps and rabbit-snares—where at the point of attainment, not even a single word remains." From this, one can see its utmost simplicity. Without encountering a true teacher’s oral instructions, it is not easy to tread its profound mysteries—even by one chance in ten thousand.

The commentary says: From "emptiness and nothingness" to "daily use" speaks of the Dao. From "the sages" to "the transformations of creation" speaks of the *Yijing*. From "Master Wei Boyang" to "mere borrowing of images" speaks of the *Cantong qi*. From "the essentials of elixir refinement" to "supreme fortune" speaks of the external medicine. From "once the elixir is obtained" to "has no position yet is revered" speaks of the internal medicine. From "Heaven’s One generates water" to "either ascend or descend" speaks of the year. From "the sages transpose this yearly cycle" to "flourishing and decline" speaks of the month. From "further, they transpose this" to "cold and warmth" speaks of the day. From "*Zi* is the chief of yang" to "end and beginning" speaks of the hours. From "the wondrous subtleties of the golden elixir" onward, where nothing can be said, speaks of the external borrowing of images. From "the true mechanism of moving fire" to "can all be rendered useless" speaks of the internal borrowing of images.

Moreover, the number thirty-two serves as the boundary of Qian and Kun, totaling three hundred sixty. Multiplying thirty-two by two hundred sixteen yields six thousand nine hundred twelve—this is the boundary number of the thirty-two yang hexagrams. Again, multiplying thirty-two by one hundred forty-four yields four thousand six hundred eight—this is the boundary number of the thirty-two yin hexagrams. Together, the two chapters comprise eleven thousand five hundred twenty. Now, taking the seventh month as the pivot between *Pi* (否) and *Tai* (泰), one bathes at their juncture. Yet when the myriad things are full and overflowing at the intersection of *Pi* and *Tai*, one also takes the hexagrams *Pi* and *Tai* to correspond to the spring and autumn equinoxes for bathing, though the application differs. The subtleties of the *Wuzhen* texts possess their own wondrous uses. Thus, the Immortal Elder also states in the *Four Hundred Characters*:

*"As for the bathing method,
Mao and You are likewise empty."*
Master Xinglin remarks:
*"Bathing does not lie in Mao and You."*
Hence, Master Wumingzi simply takes the two hexagrams *Pi* and *Tai*, where yin and yang are evenly balanced, as the two equinoxes of spring and autumn, or as the seventh month, or as the two solstices. Without grasping their subtleties, one will be confounded.

**Song Bestowed upon Daoist Liu of White Dragon Cave**

Jade flees, gold flies—both luminaries hasten.
No sooner does one hear blossoms bloom than autumn frost descends.
Vainly boast Peng’s thousand years of age—
It is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.
A lightning flash—how all too swift!
A hundred years amount to but thirty thousand days.
Within them, cold and heat alternately torment,
Unseen, the youthful visage fades in darkness.
Though children and grandchildren fill the eye,
Affection and attachment only deepen entanglement.
When essence is exhausted and the body withers,
Who can teach you to briefly halt?
Since halting briefly admits no strategy,
Inevitably, the body returns to flowing water.
Yet look upon the sages and worthies of old—
How many have truly mastered remaining in the world?

The Master of Empty Mystery says:
Sun and moon shuttle like a loom, time flies like an arrow—
Few among men reach seventy years.
Cold and heat press upon us, children and grandchildren tug at the heart.
From old age to death, generation after generation it is ever thus—
Yet who turns back to steadfastly seek the Dao and preserve the form in the world?

I deeply sigh: human life is hard to attain, the supreme Dao hard to hear.
Though one dwells in the world, there is a method—
Only that most men lack the capacity,
And instead rush into the mountains to seek herbs and grasses,
To subdue lead and refine mercury in hopes of forging cinnabar and the Elixir of Yang.

Men of the world, seeking the Dao, know not the true path,
But fiercely love the external furnace, hunting rare herbs and grasses,
Smelting common lead and mercury, hoping to transmute them into the Elixir of Yang,
To exchange bones and become immortal treasures.
The immortal elder has a poem that says:
*"Refrain from refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits;
If you seek among the grasses, you stray further from the truth."*
This warns men of the world: do not let the external furnace and treasures mislead the heart.
When the elixir ripens, gold will naturally fill the house—
Why waste fire and squander wealth?

The forging of the Elixir of Yang is entirely distinct:
One must seek crimson blood within Kan,
Seize it and bring it to Li to refine the essence of yin.
Harmonize and blend them at the proper time—
The proper time requires a matchmaker.
The Golden Elder and the Maiden of Mystery unite in marriage:
The Golden Elder favors the White Tiger,
The Maiden of Mystery ever rides the Crimson Dragon.
The tiger comes to stillness, sitting in autumn mountains;
The dragon stirs, rising from the azure pool.
When the two beasts meet, they battle fiercely—
Waves surge like a boiling cauldron,
The Yellow Dame and Old Ding lend their might,
Shaking heaven and earth, startling gods and spirits.

The subjugation of lead and mercury, the forging of elixir to transmute crimson blood and reshape bones—
All this is but the resource of greed and delusion,
Unknowing of planting virtue, only increasing sin.
What benefit is there to the great matter of life and death?
The forging of the Golden Elixir, the transformation of mortal bones into pure Yang immortals—
This is entirely distinct.
Within Kan, seek crimson blood from the White Tiger to obtain the *qi* of the eighth string—
This is the extraction of essence from black lead.
Within Li, refine the essence of yin from the Azure Dragon to obtain the *qi* of the eighth vessel—
This is the extraction of marrow from red lead.
Kan is black, yet within it one seeks the crimson;
Li is yang, yet within it one refines the yin.
When the two substances unite, gather them on the proper day, at the proper time.
Once the timing is correct and the Yellow Dame serves as matchmaker,
The Golden Elder and White Tiger, the Maiden of Mystery and Crimson Dragon,
Naturally pair as husband and wife, their affections entwined.
The two substances unite, the Yellow Dame as go-between,
The Golden Elder lending might, seizing heaven and earth—
Heaven and earth tremble, gods and spirits submit and flee.
An ancient song says:
*"Subtly they rise and fall, the essence of heaven and earth;
Gathering yin and yang, startling gods and spirits."*
This is not the so-called gold, stone, herbs, and grasses of the world. **[Here refers to external elixirs.]**

Once the battle ends and the clouds and rain disperse,
Plant a mysterious pearl in the mud at the bottom.
From this, the root and sprout gradually grow.
Tend it in due season, embrace true essence—
After ten months, the embryo is shed, swallowed into the mouth.
Unawares, the mortal body now possesses spirit.
When the wild battle of the two beasts concludes,
The Golden Elixir is obtained at once, swallowed into the five viscera.
Plant this mysterious pearl in the earthen crucible at the muddy bottom,
Advance and retreat according to the fire talisman, refine with true fire.
From this, the Golden Liquid and Returned Elixir take root,
The sprout growing day by day, flourishing month by month.
Tend it in due season, nourishing its growth—
After ten months, the sacred embryo is perfected,
Refining form into *qi*, naturally possessing manifold spiritual *qi*.
Refining *qi* into spirit, naturally uniting with the Dao. **[Here refers to internal elixirs.]**

This matter is rare in the world, not known to ordinary men.
If one lacks immortal bones from past lives,
How easily can one encounter it?
If encountered, one should immediately refine—
For the light of life is as urgent as an arrow.
When seeking fish, one must cast a net;
Do not wait by the waterside, sighing in vain.
I hear you have known the medicine for many years—
Why not collect your heart and refine mercury and lead?
Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind.
The six paths of rebirth—do not blame heaven.
The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is rarely transmitted in the world.
If you have planted immortal bones in past lives and met a true teacher,
Begin cultivation swiftly, though it may already be too late.
The years do not wait for men—do not die in vain.
Since you already know the medicine, hasten to cultivate.
Lead and mercury are not material things of this world,
Nor are they the medicine of subduing lead and mercury to forge the Elixir of Yang.
This urges men to cultivate early.

Nearly all in the world today are deceitful—
Even those clad in plain robes claim to be Daoists.
Ask them what gold and wood are—
They fall silent, mute as if struck dumb,
Then turn to breath retention and fasting,
Pursuing other paths and long roads.
Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?
*"The method of the Great One containing truth is most excellent—*
*Do not blame my words for being wild and coarse,*
*Only that men of the time find it hard to discern."*
Only when your heart aligns with mine
Dare I pour out my thoughts to you.

Vulgar men take the practice of the Dao as their duty,
Yet know not what gold and wood are.
In vain they practice breath retention and fasting,
Minor arts of side paths—
How could they understand the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?
*"How is this the Dao?*
*The Great One containing truth—*
*The five phases move in reverse,*
*The tiger is born in water, Kan and Li inverted,*
*The dragon emerges from fire."*
This is what it means.

Some interpret this song as referring to the ten-month gestation,
The sacred embryo’s entry and exit, its wondrous transformations—
Their words are correct.
Others take a single spiritual elixir, swallowing it into the belly,
Citing the *Cantong Qi*:
*"Golden sand enters the five viscera."*
Later generations doubt this as external elixir—
Their words are not fitting.
They have not grasped the true transmission of *Wuzhen Pian*.
Its essentials state:
*"True lead is the primordial *qi* born from the kidneys;*
*Divine mercury is the true within nature, issuing from the heart.*
*The *qi* within *qi* conceals true water;*
*The true within nature harbors true fire."*
Why not deeply investigate the preface of *Wuzhen Pian*?
It says:
*"Nowadays, scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*,
Divide heart and kidneys as Kan and Li—
These are all cases of the sun and moon losing their Dao,
Lead and mercury in separate furnaces.
How can they hope to congeal the Returned Elixir? Is it not far off?"*
This is what *Wuzhen Pian* ridicules.
Yet now, some take this as the essential method—
From this, it is clear they have not grasped the true transmission of *Wuzhen Pian*.

If you meet a true teacher, you will know my words are not false.
I do not dare to denounce them, but only wish to clarify the Dao.

**Song of Stone Bridge**

My home lies north of Stone Bridge,
At the mountain pass that tames the waters,
Where ancient trees stand guard.
Beneath the bridge, the stream flows clear,
From the foot of Kunlun Mountain, a fragrant spring wells forth.
I dwell within these mountains, truly boasting their splendor—
Everywhere, unfading blossoms are planted.
To the north of the mountain, a cave shelters a fierce tiger,
Emerging from its den with a roar that stirs the wind.
To the south, a deep pool harbors a flood dragon,
Rising through clouds to send down rain, shrouding the mountains in mist.
When the two beasts meet and battle,
The dark essence and flood dragon submit—all true auspices.
The scene is wondrous fair; I secretly rejoice,
Pouring my own wine, drinking to drunkenness,
Strumming a tuneless zither.
The notes teach attentiveness—
Alas, in drunkenness, none understand.
Muddled and silent, I seem a fool.
Gazing upward, I observe the workings of creation:
The sun sets in the west, the moon rises in the east—
Heaven is earth, earth is heaven,
Yin and yang reverse and unite naturally.
Once you recognize the inversion of the five phases,
You will ascend in rosy clouds, returning to the grotto-heaven,
A golden house with rafters of white jade,
Jade maidens and golden lads attending before you.
The Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are arrayed clearly,
The myriad phenomena manifest boundlessly.
Without day or night, ceaselessly,
The fire of the celestial revolution is complete.
If you ask the true place of the Golden Elixir,
Seek the teacher who points out lead in water.
Wood gives birth to fire, metal to water—
Water and fire must distinguish front and rear.
Discern the floating and sinking, know host and guest.
Lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury—only then can they unite.
There is hardness and softness; do not be careless.
Knowing contentment, always content, return to the root.
The myriad spirits celebrate the era of Great Peace.
Then the nation prospers, the people rejoice—
This matter is excellent to ponder.
Those of the Dao who know this principle,
Later generations who study the true—
They say only of preserving and nurturing, of circulating *qi*,
That it is easy to attain before their eyes.
Those who ingest it achieve wonders beyond compare:
First, they cure illness, then extend their years.
Refining with fire, they transform the yang body.
The cultivator of the Dao ceases thought, puts aside questions of side paths,
Knowing only to deceive men in the moment,
Unawares, their own bodies wither in darkness.
I urge later learners to be resolute—
Do not abandon your home to wander elsewhere.
The wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body—
How could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?
Do not procrastinate, clinging to baseness.
Hasten to seek a teacher, pursue the mysterious method.
While alive, if you do not learn to cultivate,
Who knows what womb you may enter in the next life?
If you have the heart to see it through to the end,
The great matter of human life is only life and death.
If heaven betrays the man of Dao,
It would make me a lower spirit in the three paths.

**Postscript:**
Mediocre men take the practice of the Dao as their duty,
Yet know not what gold and wood are.
In vain they practice breath retention and fasting,
Minor arts of side paths—
How could they understand the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?
*"How is this the Dao?*
*The Great One containing truth—*
*The five phases move in reverse,*
*The tiger is born in water, Kan and Li inverted,*
*The dragon emerges from fire."*
This is what it means.
Some interpret this as the ten-month gestation,
The sacred embryo’s entry and exit, its wondrous transformations—
Their words are correct.
Yet to take a single spiritual elixir and swallow it into the belly,
Citing the *Cantong Qi*: *"Golden sand enters the five viscera,"*
And for later generations to doubt this as external elixir—
This is not fitting.
They have not grasped the true transmission.
Its essentials state:
*"True lead is the primordial *qi* born from the kidneys;*
*Divine mercury is the true within nature, issuing from the heart.*
*The *qi* within *qi* conceals true water;*
*The true within nature harbors true fire."*
Why not deeply investigate the preface of *Wuzhen Pian*?
It says:
*"Nowadays, scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*,
Divide heart and kidneys as Kan and Li—
These are all cases of the sun and moon losing their Dao,
Lead and mercury in separate furnaces.
How can they hope to congeal the Returned Elixir? Is it not far off?"*
This is what *Wuzhen Pian* ridicules.
Yet now, some take this as the essential method—
From this, it is clear they have not grasped the true transmission of *Wuzhen Pian*.
If you meet a true teacher, you will know my words are not false.
I do not dare to denounce them, but only wish to clarify the Dao.

Kongxuanzi says: This song is a comprehensive praise of the marvels of the Golden Elixir and a refutation of the errors of heterodox schools. Where it speaks of "Dragon-Tiger, lead-silver, cinnabar-mercury, floating and sinking, host and guest," it refers to the true essence of the two things, yin and yang. Where it says, "The sun sets in the west, the moon rises in the east; heaven is earth, earth is heaven," it illustrates the union of yin and yang and the inversion of the Five Phases. "Lead within water, wood engenders fire, metal engenders water" metaphorically describes the products of yin and yang. The "mysterious pearl" embodies the form of the completed Golden Elixir. "Day and night, drawing and adding" clarify the ten months of practice. "Preserving and nourishing *qi*" refutes the minor techniques of heterodox schools. Its praises of the Golden Elixir’s efficacy and exhortations to cultivate the Dao are evident in its words and require no further explanation.

*Preface to Wuzhen Pian Zhizhi Xiangshuo*
By Weng Baoguang of the Song Dynasty

Before the manifestation of the primordial chaos, there was emptiness and silence, no name to be ascribed—only forcibly called the Dao. When the Dao descended, it generated the One *Qi*, neither moving nor still, neither turbid nor clear, vast and unfathomable. The sages, speaking with effort, called it the *Hunyuan Zhenyi* (Primordial True One) *Qi*. Once this *qi* divided, it transformed into yin and yang. Yin and yang are heaven and earth, male and female. Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things are transformed and nurtured; male and female unite, and the myriad things are born. Thus, since the existence of heaven and earth, there has not been a single thing that did not attain its form through the union of yin and yang.

Those who seek to refine the elixir, if they take the images of metals, stones, grasses, and woods—naming the myriad different vessels—or even the essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humors of the body as the substance of the elixir, all these are post-celestial, turbid substances born of heaven and earth. Turbid substances have form and can be seen; how can they generate the formless and enter into the formless? Moreover, post-celestial things do not transcend the bounds of heaven and earth, and those with form inevitably decay. How can they transform and transcend beyond heaven and earth? If they do not transcend beyond heaven and earth, then those with form have never escaped the cycle of yin and yang, of life and death. Yang governs life, yin governs death; one dies, one lives, one departs, one returns—this is the natural principle. Even if one refines correctly, ingests efficaciously, and lives as long as Peng Zu or the Great Yu, when one’s allotted span is exhausted, there is no escape from death. Like an arrow shot into the sky, when its force is spent, it must fall. This is the principle that things with form inevitably decay.

Therefore, the sages gather the pre-celestial One *Qi* to refine the elixir, returning form to the One *Qi*, refining *qi* to merge with spirit, and refining spirit to unite with the Dao, thereby returning to the formless form. Thus, they transcend beyond heaven and earth, stand beyond creation, grasp yin and yang, and wield heaven and earth without being altered by the cycles of yin and yang, life and death—all through the power of the pre-celestial One *Qi*. Therefore, the elixir body becomes eternally numinous and enduring, neither arising nor ceasing. It is like moving a jar while inside it; to move the jar, one must be outside it. The True One *Qi* existed before heaven and earth, vast and unfathomable. The sages, using things of the same kind, enticed it to form the elixir—just as fire exists within the sun, and using a yang-sui (burning mirror) draws it forth to obtain the fire; or as water exists within the moon, and using a fang-zhu (moon mirror) draws it forth to obtain the water. Thus, refining things of the same kind, they established the furnace and tripod, calling them the True Dragon and True Tiger. As Master Lü’s verses say: "The natural furnace and tripod, the tiger encircling and the dragon coiling."

These things of the same kind are the emotionless emotion, the colorless color—the most numinous and noble among the myriad things, possessing the correct nature and life. If one gathers the initial *qi* of the same kind and employs it, it is called True Lead and True Mercury. The immortal elder said: "People of this age must recognize the true lead and mercury; they are not ordinary cinnabar or quicksilver, but the *qi* of the initial *qi* of lead and mercury." The "initial *qi*" refers to the upper and lower *qi*, the numbers two and eight. The dragon is called eight ounces, the tiger weighs half a catty—hence called the two and eight. This is because the water source is utterly pure, possessing *qi* but no substance. Using this *qi* to entice it, the True One *Qi* descends in numinosity and takes form. The immortal elder said: "The medicine meets the *qi* of the same kind and only then takes form; the Dao resides in emptiness and accords with nature."

To refine this Golden Elixir, first seek a propitious mountain and blessed land, then construct a few rooms for the elixir chamber. Build a three-tiered altar, erect a sword at the four sides, and hang mirrors. Then establish the Dragon and Tiger as the furnace and tripod, set up a water clock as the measure, and regulate the drawing and adding with the rules of water and fire. The operations require assistants and companions. Such matters are not easily expounded and also require worldly wealth to accomplish. Thus, Master Yin Zhenjun said: "To cultivate this Dao, one must have resources; without resources, the Golden Elixir cannot be refined." One also needs three companions—three like-minded friends of one heart and will.

On the night of the fifteenth of the eighth month, when the first yang stirs, the primary practitioner should step with the Yu step onto the altar, seize the Dragon with the left hand and the Tiger with the right, regulate the *qi*, await the proper time, align the stars, match yin and yang, and harmonize the breath with the water clock. Thus, metal and water unite, and the Dragon-Wood nurtures its essence. One sits in the tent, strategizing like a general weaving the warp and weft of the scriptures, ensuring the beginning and end are flawlessly executed, without the slightest error. Thus, the immortal elder said: "It all depends on the power of cultivation; the slightest deviation will fail to produce the elixir." Another secretly observes the water clock’s precision, meticulously adjusting the drawing and adding, preparing the fire work without missing the hexagrams or exceeding the time. If the moment is lost, the elixir will be difficult to complete. Thus, Chaoyuanzi said: "I urge you to exhaust the numbers of the celestial cycle; do not let the time slip by as the hexagrams hasten." The three work in unison, mutually confirming each other. In less than half a day, the True One *Qi* is obtained and returns to the Palace of Mutual Response, congealing into a grain as large as a millet seed, called the Golden Elixir. It resides in the North Sea, radiant and luminous, piercing through the curtains. Immediately, one wields the Moye sword to pursue it, and upon entering the mouth, one instantly ascends to the sacred position. Thus, the immortal elder said: "Swallowing a grain of the Golden Elixir, one then knows that my life is not determined by heaven." Once this grain is settled in the Cinnabar Field and Sea of *Qi*, the essence and fluids of the entire body converge and return to it, immediately forming cinnabar that does not dissipate. Then, one employs the fire to refine it into the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. This fire is the *qi* of yin and yang.

The yang numbers are odd, the yin numbers even. From *zi* to *si*, the six celestial stems belong to yang, thus called the "yang fire." From *wu* to *hai*, the six celestial stems belong to yin, thus called the "yin tally." The *qiang* of *Qian* totals two hundred and sixteen, the *fang* of *Kun* totals one hundred and forty-four. Within these two hexagrams, one seizes four thousand three hundred and twenty years of primordial *qi*, which returns to my Cinnabar Field, warming and nurturing the "child pearl" until the sacred embryo is formed.

The Old Lord said: "The odd yang arises from *zi*, the even yin emerges from *wu*. Beginning and ending within *Qian* and *Kun*, it is like the gestation of a fetus in the womb. Thus, externally, one harmonizes with the fire of yin and yang, while internally, the essence of the Golden Liquid is born. Without need for added effort, it naturally circulates, ascending from the *Weilü* with a distinct sound, piercing through the twin towers, rising in reverse to the summit of *Niwan*, then descending into the mouth—its form like a sparrow’s egg, fragrant and sweet. This is the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir."

Slowly swallowing it down to the Cinnabar Field, the sacred embryo is formed, and the infant is nurtured. Thus, the immortal elder said: "The infant is one, containing true fluids. After ten months, the embryo is complete, and one enters the foundation of the sacred. Just as the mortal embryo is born after ten months, so too is the sacred embryo. After ten months, the fire is complete, the work is done, and one sheds the embryo to transform into a body of pure yang. Cold, heat, hunger, and thirst can no longer disturb. Only then may one retreat into deep mountains and secluded valleys, or dwell in humble and remote places, facing the wall for nine years to empty the heart. With no self and no others, the mind remains as it was—this is called the immortal embracing the One."

When the true monk gathers the ox, only those who recognize the heart and see their nature can embrace the One, and thus this Dao is perfected. After nine years of work, the nature of non-action is spontaneously perfected, wisdom naturally arises, the body of pure yang is inherently wondrous, and the spirit inherently numinous. Thus, nature and life unite with the Dao, becoming true yet formless.

The formless form manifests according to circumstances: encountering wind, it becomes wind; encountering rain, it becomes rain; encountering water or fire, it becomes water or fire. It transforms unpredictably—now present, now gone—seen ahead, suddenly behind. Thus, it can divide its body into a hundred billion, responding without limit. Like the moon reflecting in ten thousand waters, it is universally present. Therefore, it responds to conditions and answers calls without fail. Yet its true body abides in the realm of utmost stillness, never acting. This is the union of spirit, form, nature, and life with the Dao, returning together to the ultimate source of emptiness and quiescence.

Thus, the sages forcibly name it the "Nine-Turn Golden Liquid Great Returned Elixir," or the "Vajra Indestructible Body," the supreme and most true wondrous Dao. The immortal elder alone perfected this Dao, attaining a body of true gold and wondrous hue, manifesting its majestic and luminous golden compassionate form universally across the Dharma realm to save and deliver sentient beings. To his disciple Liu Fengzhen, he revealed the nature Dao as unborn, entering quiescence, yet later manifested his true body in Wangwu Mountain. He demonstrated the life Dao as indestructible, achieving perfect penetration. In the fifth year of Yuanfeng, on the fifth day of the third month, at the time of his liberation by means of the corpse, he left a gatha:

*"The wondrous function of the one spirit pervades the Dharma realm,
This is not the Dao of nature and life both perfected,
Nor the true union of form and spirit both wondrous—
How could one attain this?"*

He had lived in the world for ninety-six years. In his lifetime, he broadly expounded the profound and subtle, composing verses that refined emotions and nature, his words profound and elegant. He drew in later generations, entitling his work *Awakening to Reality*. "Awakening to Reality" refers to the truth of nature and life.

Yet he reflected that later students knew only the life Dao but not how to exhaust their nature, or knew only the nature Dao but not how to nurture their life. Thus, he composed a verse on awakening to the true suchness and a hymn on the wondrous treasure of the colored body, to enlighten those of superior wisdom and great capacity, enabling them to fully comprehend the Dao of nature and life, attain ultimate perfection and penetration, and transcend the three realms. This was not something achievable by those lacking the great compassion of unimpeded wisdom and perfect illumination.

Though my understanding is dim and obscured, I have received the immortal elder’s secret transmission. Through diligent study of this work, I have revealed eight or nine parts of its true mechanism. Fearing that those of like aspiration might not recognize the source and flow of the Golden Elixir, I trace its origin and essentials, daring to offend heavenly judgment by directly pointing to the broad path of *Awakening to Reality*. If there are those with innate affinity for immortality, they may directly enter the gate of *Awakening to Reality* and seek non-action in the millet-sized pearl. If sought externally, one cannot hope to attain it.

In ancient times, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the empty void. Innumerable sacred assemblies eagerly entered through the pearl’s opening—this is the single grain of the Golden Elixir. A grain like a millet contains all phenomena, encompassing the three powers. It is boundless in its vastness, infinitesimal in its smallness. From antiquity to the present, countless perfected beings and supreme sages have realized this Dao—who has not attained the supreme great Dao through this single millet grain?

This Dao is most simple and most easy. Without the guidance of a true teacher, none can fathom its profound roots and firm foundation. Even with roots and foundation recognized, without great wealth and power, none can accomplish the work and manifest the affair. Even with work and affair manifested, without clarity of heart and insight into nature, none can attain the wondrousness of embracing the One. Once the One is embraced in wondrousness, the Dao of nature and life is perfected—nothing more can be added.

Thus, the life Dao is invariably transmitted through a teacher’s guidance, then illuminated through cultivation and practice. As for the nature Dao, it is not something that comes from without. If one relies on external perceptions, knowledge, and learning, one falls into the lesser rules and fails to penetrate the utmost clarity of hearing and seeing. Only by self-awakening and self-illumination within one’s own heart can one fully realize the nature Dao and attain what is called the "supreme first vehicle."

Alas! Within the nature Dao, there is no awakening to awaken, no illumination to illuminate—only the absence of awakening and the absence of illumination. There is no exhaustion to exhaust, no attainment to attain—only the absence of exhaustion and the absence of attainment. The "supreme first" is above nothing, the "one" is without oneness. If a student receives the teacher’s transmission, grasps the celestial mechanism, refines the spirit elixir, sheds the embryo and changes the bones, further clarifies the heart and reaches the origin, awakens to true emptiness, and directly transcends to the supreme vehicle, entering the realm of non-action, then form and spirit are both wondrous, nature and life are both perfected. Riding the phoenix and chariot, mounting the dragon and phoenix, they will surely roam together in Penglai and Langfeng.

The art of strengthening the army and securing victory—this is the method of refining the Golden Elixir.

The practice of refining the Golden Elixir always begins at the first movement of yang on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, seated in steadfastness upon the altar of the Celestial Dipper, ascending three tiers. To the left, one seizes the Dragon to examine and stabilize the crucible; to the right, one grasps the Tiger to precisely regulate the firing times. Civil and martial forces contend in battle at the Gate of Mystery; departing and returning, they fiercely struggle at the Gate of the Feminine. The breath tally and water clock must correspond to the revolutions of the celestial cycle without the slightest deviation—thus it is called the method of strengthening the army and securing victory. The "army" is the Dragon and Tiger; the "battle" is their union. Within a single two-hour period, six grains of the Golden Elixir are obtained and taken into the mouth—this is the method of securing victory. As the *Scripture of Western Splendor* states: "Strengthening the army and securing victory lies in the work of nurturing the Mystery Pearl." Therefore, the immortal elders first arranged sixteen regulated poems to clarify the respective eights of Dragon and Tiger. A single five-character quatrain signifies that within one period, a single grain of the Golden Elixir is obtained. This is why I have divided it into the upper volume, presenting it to elucidate the method of strengthening the army and securing victory—thus the work of gathering the Golden Elixir shines forth in clarity.

The method of enriching the state and pacifying the people: the practice of circulating the yin-yang tally and firing times.

The Great Dao is formless, giving rise to the primordial qi. This qi, in its chaotic state, divides into yin and yang. The purest yang qi, light and clear, ascends to cover above—this is called Heaven. The purest yin qi, heavy and turbid, descends to bear below—this is called Earth. The accumulation of pure yang qi that soars upward to Heaven becomes the immortal.

The accumulation of pure yin qi that sinks and dissolves into Earth becomes the demon. The body that receives both yin and yang qi, neither ascending nor sinking, dwelling between Heaven and Earth—capable of becoming either immortal or demon—is the human. If one cultivates and refines, stripping away all yin to transform the form into pure yang qi, one ascends as an immortal. If, unaware of cultivation, one daily depletes primordial yang until the body transforms into pure yin qi, one becomes a lower demon. The *Yijing* states: "That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward"—each follows its own numerical destiny. Thus, the sage, gazing upward and downward, knows that humans receive the essence of Heaven and Earth, making them the most numinous and noble. Therefore, they borrow the two substances of true yin and true yang to seize the primal qi of Heaven and Earth before their division, forming the elixir to return to the Cinnabar Field and Sea of Qi, thereby governing the postnatal qi of the entire body. Then, the qi of the entire body converges as if the myriad states paying homage to the sovereign or the stars encircling the North Star.

Knowing that humans first arise from the essence of their parents’ union, they thus steal the pure qi of yin and yang as the foundation for transformation, called the "yin tally and yang fire." Circulating within the sixty-four hexagrams, cycling endlessly, revolving the seventy-two seasonal nodes and twenty-four solar terms within a single day and night, they seize the four thousand three hundred and sixty grains of upright qi, converging them within the Cinnabar Field and Sea of Qi to warm and nurture the elixir pearl. The elixir, abiding in the Central Palace, remains quiescent and non-active, thus externally connecting with the yin tally and yang fire while internally generating the true unity of the numinous body. After ten months of gestation, the form transforms into pure yang qi, beyond hunger and thirst, unassailed by cold or heat—hence the method of enriching the state and pacifying the people.

The state is the body; the people are the essence and qi. The people are the root of the state; when the root is firm, the state is secure. Without a ruler, the people have no refuge; without ministers, the people have no governance. Thus, the sage takes the elixir as the ruler and fire as the minister. When elixir and fire mutually support each other, ruler and minister rejoice in harmony, and the world is at peace. When the root is firm, the people are at ease, and the state of the body is enriched. The *Xihua Jing* states: "When essence is complete and qi is sufficient, the state is enriched and the people are pacified"—this is precisely the result of ingesting the Golden Elixir.

Thus, the immortal elder continues with sixty-four quatrains, corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*, to elucidate the numerical progression of firing the lines. He further composes twelve *Xijiang Yue* lyrics, symbolizing the twelve months of firing and bathing. This is why I have divided it into the middle volume, to clarify the method of firing and the intent of enriching the state and pacifying the people. The sequence of elixir cultivation should indeed proceed thus.

**The Dao of the Immortal Embracing the One**

The Dao of the immortal embracing the One is the time when the sage’s firing practice reaches completion, and the form transforms into pure yang qi. Then, one retreats to a secluded corner, faces the wall for nine years, and embraces the One to empty the heart. When the heart is settled, the spirit transforms, uniting with the Dao—this is called "embracing the One." Thus it is said: The Dao is the root of nature; nature is the source of the heart. Heart and nature share the same substance, transforming boundlessly. The common people use it daily, calling it "natural." If one can awaken to it, forget images and words, empty the heart and fill the belly, and embrace the One to advance in practice, after nine transformations, one attains immortality—this is its principle.

The nine transformations are nine years—the number nine is the extreme of yang. The One is the potent name for the Dao. Embracing is holding that which cannot be held.

At this moment of attaining immortality, the adept dissolves the limbs, stills the senses, severs worldly dust, equalizes self and other, relinquishes fixation, certainty, grasping, and rejection—heart and realm become one, wandering freely and at ease. Thus, when cosmic serenity stabilizes, the light of Heaven emerges. After nine years of practice, the nature of non-action becomes perfectly rounded, the formless spirit attains wondrous subtlety. When the spirit is wondrous, transformations are boundless, profound and unfathomable; when nature is rounded, wisdom illuminates the ten directions, spirit pervades without obstruction. Hence, the adept may divide the body into a hundred billion, manifesting without limit—yet the essence of utmost reality abides in the realm of perfect stillness, silent and without any agent of action. Here, spirit, form, nature, and life all unite with the Dao in truth. This is called the "Way of Embracing the One."

Of old, after the immortal elder attained the Dao, he demonstrated to his disciple Liu Fengzhen the entry into quiescence through non-arising. Having entered quiescence, he then manifested his form in Wangwu Mountain—this is the very Way. Of old, after the Tathāgata entered nirvāṇa, his golden coffin arose into the sky, and the threefold fire consumed his body. Yet, when his mother’s weeping did not cease, he again manifested his golden form in the sky, speaking half a verse—this, too, is the same Way. Of old, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years and entered extinction, he carried his single sandal west, and Puhua immolated his body in towering flames. Yet the sound of his bell still shook the sky. Such exemplars are not easily encompassed. If nature and life were not both rounded, form and spirit not both wondrous, who could achieve this?

Thus, the immortal elder concluded his scroll by revealing that the Chan school’s teaching of nature and Dao truly elucidates the Way of Embracing the One. Therefore, I have divided this into a lower volume.

The Way of nature is vast, empty, and boundless—dim, obscure, beyond all form and description. Humans and non-humans are all equal, without high or low. Since beginningless time, whether in forms with names or in nameless formlessness, not a single thing fails to be perfectly complete and sufficient, for its original essence is inherently pure and complete. Thus, there has never been anything that could be described or expressed in words. Yet the Great Treasury contains fifty-four hundred and eight scrolls—all these are the sages’ compelled speech, born of humanity’s profound darkness regarding the Dao. They speak so that people may, through words, awaken to the Dao. Once the Dao is awakened, words themselves become non-existent.

Thus, the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: "If one claims the Tathāgata has expounded the Dharma, this is slander of the Buddha." Therefore, all speech is slander. Now, the immortal elder’s songs and verses on nature and Dao are also compelled speech—already superfluous. This is why I do not further interpret them, lest I draw legs on a snake.

I only wish that the ardent and enlightened may not seek externally but awaken directly within their own hearts, illumining uniquely and bearing the transmission without hesitation. Whether in clamor or silence, speech or stillness, taverns or brothels—it is thus. Whether not thus, whether in every place without distinction, harmonizing all the worlds of the ten directions with a single eye, extending a single hand, the wondrous function pervades all directions, covering heaven and earth. Wherever one moves, it is the real; whatever one does, there is nothing it cannot accomplish. Then one knows that here, the original nature is inherently complete, lacking nothing, needing no deliberation. All abilities are forgotten, all questions and responses, thoughts and concerns—even the word "nature" itself is no longer needed.

The Esoteric Essentials of the Three Vehicles: Poetry on the Golden Elixir

**Great indeed is the single millet grain—**
From the Void it descends, from the Origin it flows,
Returning to form at the first hexagram’s dawn.
Two halves of Qian and Kun draw upon creation’s power,
A single catty spun by the pivot of sun and moon.
The subtle count of stellar breaths, the faintest reckoning—
Advance the fire with divine skill, its signs precise.
When the blaze of the half-hour’s civil and martial flames subsides,
The Crimson Dragon yields the luminous night-shining pearl.

**Method of Circulating the Fire**
Once the single pearl is ingested, earth joins heaven,
Rain gathers at the Mysterious Pass, the fire blazes bright.
Sixty hexagrams cycle through dawn and dusk,
Within the ninefold city, mercury burns, lead is drawn.
In adding and withdrawing, guard against peril;
In bathing, halt the talisman to prevent smoke.
When the work is complete and the embryo shed,
After ten months of nurturing within the Void,
A Great Luo Immortal is born.

**Method of Embracing the One**
The elixir is but the trap, the Dao the fish—
Forget the trap to attain the Dao, realize emptiness.
Do not cling fast to embracing non-action.
Shatter the Void, and the One is also none.
Yet wondrous being’s numinous radiance ever blazes,
Encompassing the Dharma Realm with effortless ease.
Following conditions, responding to stimuli, ever pure—
After nine years, the vajra body becomes indestructible.

**Preface**
Now, those who roam the vast clouds and ascend to the golden palaces—
Their words remain in the sacred texts, their deeds transcend the dusty world.
Yet worldly folk cannot deeply believe.
I have observed the *Preface to the Collected Immortals*:
Since ancient times, those who soared aloft number over a hundred thousand,
Those who raised their households to ascend, over eighty families.
Liu Xiang, foremost Confucian of the Han, also composed the *Biographies of the Immortals* to bequeath to later generations.
Thus, the reality of divine transcendents is no fabrication.

Yet why do worldly folk disbelieve?
For no other reason than this:
The celestial mechanism is profoundly mysterious,
The secrets of immortals and sages are hidden.
Worldly learning is shallow, human sincerity fleeting—
No wonder their ears do not grasp it.

The *Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness* begins:
"The Great Dao is formless, yet gives birth to heaven and earth;
The Great Dao is passionless, yet moves the sun and moon,
Nurturing the myriad things, shaping all beings,
Returning at last to the primal, nameless origin."
The profound beneficence of the ancient sages toward humanity is thus.

They further expounded the principles of heaven and earth, male and female, purity and turbidity, movement and stillness,
Elaborating on the wonders of a tranquil mind and few desires,
Ever abiding in profound stillness—
All to reveal the celestial mechanism and secretly point to the Mysterious Barrier.

By the end of the text, those who can awaken may transmit the sagely Dao,
Attaining the ultimate teachings from the immortal Master Ge’s words—
Passed mouth to mouth, never recorded in writing.
Alas! Once the pure wind departed, worldly customs grew shallow,
The dust of immortality became distant, this Dao was lost.
Though heterodox doctrines abound, all return to the same distant source.
Thus, methods of gathering mercury and extracting lead were not inscribed on bamboo or silk,
The wonders of forming the embryo and nurturing the infant were deeply sealed in golden caskets and jade boxes.
Students of immortality, though white-haired from lifelong study,
Could never glimpse even a shadow of it.

In the prosperous Song dynasty, extraordinary figures emerged.
The Purple Mystery Perfected, Master Zhang,
From youth practiced grain avoidance, endowed with numinous bones,
Resolute and diligent, never faltering in hardship,
Attained the Dao from the Elder of Mount Qingcheng,
Mastering all the profound secrets of the Golden Elixir.
He expressed his encounters in songs and poems,
Naming his work the *Awakening to Reality*.
I obtained and read it, pondering deeply,
Consulting various doctrines, yet found no enlightenment.
Some dismissed it as mere furnace techniques,
Others misconstrued it as inner alchemy for sexual practices.
I sighed over the text for years,
Fortunate at last to encounter the Purple Yang Immortal Elder, Master Chen,
Who personally transmitted the *Awakening to Reality*.
The Perfected Sun Wuming elucidated its secrets, secretly imparting them.
After ablutions and purification, I recited it—
Suddenly, like mist dispersing and clouds parting,
The sun shone, the moon brightened.
The oral instructions and essentials of the heart—
Without daring to inquire further, I already knew
The mechanism of generating heaven and earth,
The Dao of moving the sun and moon,
The nurturing of the myriad things, the shaping of all beings—
All arise from true yin and true yang,
The qi of the upper and lower crucibles.
As for their application—adding and withdrawing, guarding against danger—
All became brilliantly clear before my eyes.
If one can encounter a true teacher and attain this wondrous Dao,
Nurturing the immortal embryo, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness—
Surely this life will not have been lived in vain.

Just beginning to grasp it, I leapt with joy,
Reverently following the guidance to inscribe this at the end of the scroll.
Written on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the Jiazi year of the Jiatai era of the Song,
Respectfully by Baiyunzi.

**Origins and Events of the *Awakening to Reality***

**The Origins of Perfected Zhang**
The Purple Yang Perfected was from Yingluo Street in Tiantai.
Originally named Boduan, styled Pingshu, later renamed Yongcheng.
In youth, he studied all texts, wandering like clouds and water.
In later years, he transmitted the Dao of the Primordial Origin,
Yet its subtlest aspects remained incomplete.
Diligently, he sought and inquired, traveling all directions.
During the Xining era, when Lord Lu the Academician governed Chengdu,
He followed him to Shu, serving as a military advisor in the Sichuan Pacification Office.
In the Jiyou year, he encountered an extraordinary figure
Who transmitted the secrets of fire timing—
Thus his Dao was accomplished.
The master admonished him:
"One day, if someone comes to free you from your bonds, accept them."

Later, with each transmission, he suffered calamities,
Deeply repenting and blaming himself.
He withdrew from the world, forgetting words,
Composing the *Awakening to Reality* in eighty-one chapters,
Exhaustively expounding the secrets of the two elixirs.
His discussions were profound, vehemently criticizing
Worldly scholars who clung to sectarian divisions,
Unable to unify the three teachings or fathom
The principle of different paths converging at the same source.
He vigorously corrected and supplemented the Dao,
His work circulated throughout the world.

During the Yuanfeng era, with Liu Fengzhen and his disciples,
He widely propagated Buddhist teachings,
Leaving a verse on non-arising before entering quiescence.
Liu’s disciples cremated his remains,
Obtaining hundreds of relics like chicken-head fruit,
All deep blue in color.
Seven years later, Fengzhen arrived at Mount Wangwu,
Again meeting the Immortal Elder as before—
Further demonstrating his wondrous attainment in both form and spirit,
The perfection of both nature and life.

During the Zhenghe era, he revealed his name to Huang Mianzhong, the Minister,
In Yanping.
Huang had long transmitted the Dao of Rongcheng,
Passionately devoted to furnace techniques,
Though advanced in years.
Their words did not resonate, and he departed.
Later, he sent a letter to Huang,
Narrating extraordinary events.
Huang’s grandson, Quan, saw the letter but kept it secret,
Revealing only to me its general purport:
Pingshu claimed that he and Huang were both celestial officials of the Purple Tenuity,
Numbered among the Nine August Perfected.
Due to reviewing the records of kalpa cycles,
They were banished to the human realm.
Now, only six stars of the Purple Tenuity remain visible,
Three still concealed in obscurity—
Pingshu, Mianzhong, and Master Yu.

Pingshu was the Purple Yang Perfected,
Mianzhong the Purple Origin Perfected,
Master Yu the Purple Florescence Perfected.
All those banished as officials have already returned to the Celestial Capital,
Yet Pingshu alone ascended as an immortal,
While Mianzhong remains mired in the sea of officialdom.
In each human life, he has undergone ten rebirths—
Nine have passed.
If in the next life he again succumbs to delusion and joins the dust,
He will sink into other destinies, with no hope of ascending as an immortal.
Pingshu clearly recounted their immortal pact,
Striving to deliver him,
Yet Huang ultimately failed to resonate and passed away,
Merely styling himself the Purple Origin Elder.
The Nine August are not recorded in the celestial offices—
They are but faint stars.

Beyond the nameless that may yet be named—does this lie within the twelve thousand five hundred?

**The Affairs of Monk Zixian**

Daoguang, surnamed Xue, named Shi, styled Daoyuan, was a native of Jizu Mountain in Shanfu. Originally a monk, his Dharma name was Zixian. Wandering to Chang’an, he stayed at Kaifu Temple, where he sought the elder Xiuyan. Xiuyan asked, "When the golden rooster has yet to crow, how is there no sound?" Later, he studied under the monk Ruhuan, who posed, "What is the discourse that transcends the Buddhas and Patriarchs?" Zixian replied, "A sesame cake, round and full." Upon hearing the creak of a well-sweep, he suddenly awakened. He composed a verse:

*Creak upon creak, the sound arises—*
*Not from another it is gained.*
*Suddenly, the well-sweep reveals*
*The song of no-birth in full.*
*Beware the mud-snake’s dance,*
*The pomegranate branch’s sway.*

The two elders affirmed his insight. From then on, he swiftly grasped the supreme, secret, and perfect essentials of the true Dharma, his wit sharp and his mastery of both Chan discourse and doctrine profound. Years passed thus.

One day, he realized that all the above were but affairs of this shore—that even if his eloquence flowed like a hanging river, it was still but Chan talk and Daoist discourse. Sitting motionless for kalpas on end, he could never nurture life or attain longevity. Even Bodhidharma, though enlightened, had to journey to the Eastern Land to fulfill the Way. The Sixth Patriarch, though awakened to his nature, still sought transmission at Huangmei. How could these two masters have stopped at such things?

Moreover, his refined aspiration turned to the Dao of golden elixir and the cultivation of life. There must be secret wonders therein. He devoted himself to seeking and inquiring. In the winter of the bingxu year of the Chongning era, he lodged in a Buddhist temple in Qing Town, Meixian County, where he attended a lecture. There, he encountered the Daoist Shi Tai, styled Dezhi, of Apricot Grove Post in Fufeng County, Fengxiang Prefecture. Though eighty-five years old, his hair remained black, his complexion ruddy, and his bearing extraordinary. At night, he sewed his own robes. Daoyuan observed him in secret and felt something unusual. One day, he casually recited a poem by Zhang Pingshu. Shi suddenly exclaimed, "Do you know this man?"

"My master!" He then explained the circumstances: "Master Pingshu’s former name was Boduan. Initially, in Chengdu, he lodged at Tianhui Temple, where he encountered an extraordinary person who changed his name to Yongcheng and transmitted to him the oral instructions of the elixir. Later, for leaking and recklessly transmitting them, he incurred punishment. The governor of Fengzhou, enraged, pressed charges against him, and he was sentenced to penal tattooing and exile. Passing through Bin territory, a heavy snowstorm struck, and he drank wine at a village tavern with his escorts. I happened to be in the tavern as well. After exchanging bows, I was invited to join their table. Observing their merriment, I smiled and said to the escort, 'These guests are already merry, but that guest has not yet begun drinking. Why not invite him to join you?' Thus, the escort drank heartily and asked the reason for his journey. When he explained everything, I thought to myself, 'The governor of Bin is an old friend of mine—fond of virtue and indifferent to rank. He would not mind traveling a hundred *li*.' I said to Pingshu, 'If you are willing to detour to visit him, there may be a chance to avoid this journey.' I earnestly pleaded with the escorts, and they agreed. Together, we went to Bin. I went ahead, and upon meeting the governor, Pingshu was pardoned. Grateful, he said, 'To not repay this kindness would be inhuman! You have studied the Dao all your life yet heard nothing of its attainment. Now, I shall transmit the elixir method to you. Follow it in cultivation to achieve the Dao.' I bowed in reverence, received his instructions, and vowed to uphold them.

After hearing Shi Tai’s account, Daoyuan immediately aroused sincere faith, prostrated himself, and took refuge. He requested to become his disciple and ultimately mastered the Great Elixir, receiving all its oral instructions and essentials. Shi Tai warned him, 'This is not something to be lightly shared with those of great wealth or external defenses, for it easily invites slander. Go swiftly to a bustling city and rely on those of virtue and power to carry it out.' Daoyuan then discarded his monastic robes, donned a scholar’s cap and wide-sleeved robe, and came to the capital. Veiling his light and blending with the dust, he mingled among ordinary folk, hoping to complete this endeavor. Yet, among those who study the Daoist path, upon encountering Pingshu’s poems, their interpretations diverged, and their doubts multiplied, leading to confusion and error. Many dared not even attempt cultivation until death. Alas! Was this Master Pingshu’s original intent?

Thus, I was moved to first clarify and expound its principles, unravel its mysteries, and illuminate its subtleties, making it accessible so that cultivators might avoid mistakes and attain the rank of lofty immortals, mastering the wondrous workings of the elixir. Initially, Master Pingshu, having once incurred punishment, vowed never to teach others. Later, he sighed, 'This is self-preservation, not the Way.' The *Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Statutes* states: 'To meet someone and not transmit is to lose the Heavenly Dao; to recklessly transmit to the unworthy is to leak the Heavenly Treasure. Transmitting to the right person brings merit to oneself; reckless transmission brings calamity to the seven ancestors.' I have been overly secretive, violating the Heavenly Dao. Disaster looms! Reluctantly, I composed these poems to circulate among the world’s extraordinary people, that they might read and awaken to their meaning. Yet the poems’ depths are profound and obscure, difficult to grasp. Daoyuan thus expanded their meaning into annotations, clearly revealing the true essentials and thoroughly elucidating the mysterious subtleties of the method, leaving no hidden depths. Those who obtain this text may study it in detail, resolve their doubts without inquiry, and attain self-realization—thus fulfilling Master Pingshu’s intent.

Yet, having resolved to save the world and transmit this to later generations, Daoyuan must henceforth remain silent. Those who obtain this text should guard it closely. The treasure of Heaven is protected everywhere by divine beings. If there are those of sincere aspiration, who believe in the Dao, understand the truth, and conduct themselves without flaw, then and only then may it be transmitted. It must not be shared among piles of gold and jade, nor even with one’s closest kin. For careless leakage brings misfortune upon oneself, disaster upon one’s household, and inauspiciousness to one’s descendants. Not only this—it will extend calamity to the nine mysteries and seven ancestors, subjecting them to karmic retribution and long servitude in the offices of ghosts, never to be reborn. Bear this in mind and be cautious! Do not be negligent.

Now, this elder, Yuan Zhenyi of Shangqiu, has transcribed the annotations of the *Wuzhen Pian* poems, along with the events of their transmission at the time, and compiled them in detail below. Though the language is unadorned, it is a faithful record, fully presenting the beginning and end.

Recorded on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *yiwei* year of the Zhenghe era.

---

**Annotations on the *Wuzhen Pian*: Discernment**

In the *dingmao* year of the Taiding era, in Ruiyang, I saw Xue Zixian’s annotations on the *Wuzhen Pian* and read them with regret, having not yet seen the complete edition. In the *jisi* year of the Tianli era, upon returning to Sheng, I obtained the full text and read it repeatedly for years, discerning its patterns. Later, I received several copies from distant Daoist friends, collated them, and found them identical. The annotations cited by other schools sometimes attributed passages to 'the Master' or 'Ye Wenshu'—this was one point of doubt. Recently published editions of the *Wuzhen Pian* include annotations by Xiangchuan Weng and Wumingzi, which, when compared to the annotations I obtained from Zixian, were also identical. Yet the texts were the same while the authors differed—this was another point of doubt.

In the *renxu* year of the Jiatai era, Yuan Gongfu condemned Wenshu’s annotations as chaotic and difficult to verify. Yet Gongfu’s own teachings amounted to nothing more than solitary cultivation of a single substance—why then condemn others? Was Wenshu truly at fault? Why did both Zixian and Gongfu criticize him? This was yet another point of doubt."

Having examined the dates, I found that in the *Fu Ming Pian*, Daoguang wrote in his preface that he received oral instructions from a master in the *gengzi* year of the Xuanhe era. Today, in Shangqiu, Jin Shiweng of the Yuan dynasty and Wang Zhenyi of the Zhenghe *yiwei* year recorded Xue Zixian’s deeds. Ye Wenshu’s annotations date to the thirty-first year of the Shaoxing era, *xinsi*—forty-seven years apart. In the Zhenghe *yiwei* year, Wenshu may not yet have been born or was still a child. How, then, could Zixian have been named and criticized forty-seven years prior? Moreover, all such errors and distortions were Wenshu’s own, not the work of others. This was yet another point of doubt.

Given these several doubts, I suspected the annotations were not Zixian’s, though I had not yet reached a conclusion. Yet his commentary, unlike that of other schools, truly grasped the Perfected One’s subtleties. On the third day of the fifth month in the *xinwei* year of the Zhishun era, I encountered the authentic oral instructions on the elixir’s ingredients, firing times, and true transmission—heaven’s gift. Still, I could not dispel my doubt that these were not Zixian’s annotations, and so I continued my inquiries, seeking answers far and wide.

In the autumn of the *renshen* year of the Zhishun era, an old friend from Wuling transmitted to me Xiangchuan Weng’s *Baoguang Jie*. Overjoyed, I read it for months, and my former doubts dissolved like melting ice. It became clear that the annotations commonly attributed to Zixian were in fact those of Wumingzi. How had the error—mistaking *Baoguang* for *Daoguang*—persisted so long without correction?

How do I know this? The Perfected One transmitted his teachings to Shi Xinglin, and Xinglin to Zixian—this is the third generation, known to all. The Perfected One also transmitted to Guangyizi, and Guangyizi to Wumingzi—this is likewise the third generation, though few know it. Those who sought credibility for their annotations linked Wumingzi’s commentary to the lineage, appending Zixian’s deeds to lend authority. The record states: "Yuan Wang Zhenyi"—but what Yuan surname exists? This was a fabrication to deceive the world.

Some say Zixian was a monk, also named Daoguang or Baoguang—another error, conflating two men into one due to the shared character *guang*. As for the criticism of Ye Wenshu by name: before Wenshu, no one had annotated the *Wuzhen Pian*; after Wenshu, no one had refuted his errors. Wumingzi, fearing the loss of the Perfected One’s subtleties and the misguidance of later generations, risked heavenly retribution in the *yisi* year of the Qiandao era. Following his master’s instructions, he annotated the text with meticulous clarity, lest others stray. His compassion was boundless, yet he fully revealed heaven’s mysteries.

Later generations, excerpting these commentaries without seeing the full text, further distorted the record: misreading *Weng* as a term of respect for the elderly, splitting Xiangchuan Weng and Wumingzi into two people, and erroneously attributing Wumingzi’s annotations to Zixian. Error compounded error, and even the dates and textual meanings could not be verified—how could they hope to grasp the true transmission of the immortal Dao?

Alas, the authentic lineage of the Golden Elixir’s great Dao has long been severed.

Now, as the realm is unified and those who study immortality abound, how few among them have truly heard this Dao! Is it that Zixian’s annotations have not been transmitted to later generations? Or is it that I, in my isolation, have simply not encountered them? Yet the annotations of Wumingzi are exhaustive, leaving no depths unplumbed, while the purported annotations of Zixian, as transmitted, are largely identical and lack nothing—had Zixian truly written them, how could Wumingzi fail to cite his words and instead plagiarize them entirely, seeking to replace his name and pass them off as his own? In explaining the meaning of the full moon, Wumingzi merely quotes two lines from Zixian, which clearly shows that Zixian never composed such annotations. The current misattribution of these notes to Zixian began with the annotations of one Youzuoren, who, when citing *Wu Shi Zi*, wrote *Wu Shi* instead—a corruption of *Wuming*. This further proves that Zixian never wrote such annotations.

Those who study immortality today cannot weigh the relative importance of Zixian’s renown against the obscurity of Wumingzi. Yet the authentic transmission of the immortal Dao from their masters is identical for both—they both received it from the True Man Pingshu. Where such texts exist, divine forces guard and protect them; how could one not treasure these writings and preserve them carefully, selecting the right people to transmit them? Thus, I have appended here the true origins of the True Man and the deeds of Zixian to the annotations of Wumingzi, clarifying all matters so that those who study these commentaries may easily grasp their principles, correct errors, and recognize the truth of my words. I dare not falsify the transmission of these annotations, nor dare I lightly transmit them to the unworthy.

Those who study immortality must have the karmic affinity to do so; through the text, they comprehend its meaning, and through the annotations, they grasp its guidance, avoiding heterodox paths and directly ascending to the great Dao. If heaven deems it fitting, then the great Dao of the Golden Elixir has never truly been severed. Yet another version of this text, circulating separately, bears a preface by Zixuzi dated the ninth month of the first year of the Chunxi era, placed before Chen Ziyang’s preface. This version omits the passage where Wumingzi states he "meticulously followed the immortal elder’s secret instructions," alters the subsequent text, and redistributes the *Three Vehicles’ Secret Essentials* to the beginning of each volume. It further adds annotations claiming that the essentials lie in using virgin boys and girls as yin and yang, dragon and tiger; that male and female qi constitute pre-heaven and post-heaven; that lead and mercury are true water and fire; that the initial flourishing occurs at the age of heavenly water (tiankui); that the generation of *gui* at sixteen marks the completion of the three yang; that the full moon’s light is the perfect golden crucible; that "great and small unharmed" means the two realms are whole; and that pre-heaven qi is the external medicine—truly the perverse teachings of a deviant sect, falsely annotated!

This is the heretical doctrine of Zixuzi, who dared not reveal his true name and instead preemptively dated his preface, falsely attributing it to Wumingzi without stating his own lineage, seeking to deceive the world. Some say Zixuzi is merely another name for Wumingzi, but if this were true, the names would contradict one another. Moreover, the year *guisi* of the Qiandao era was followed by *jiawu*, the first year of the Chunxi era—within a single year, the transmission of the master’s instructions would have diverged so drastically. How can this be explained? In the *jiazi* year of the Jiatai era, Baiyunzi’s preface states that Chen Ziyang first transmitted these annotations, thirty-two years after the original text. The annotations remain entirely consistent, the secret instructions clear and unambiguous, without a single erroneous or adulterated character. From *guisi* to *jiawu*, barely a month passed—had Wumingzi seen such a corrupted version before his ascension, he would surely have condemned it as heretical. How could he have attacked Ye Wenshu while upholding Zixuzi?

Furthermore, why did Zixuzi not seek the guidance of a true master to correct his errors? Had his transmission been authentic, Wumingzi would have amended it—why then would he add to Wumingzi’s unspoken instructions? This confirms the falsity of his annotations. The truth is clear.

Those among the Dao-seeking scholars fortunate enough to obtain the true essence of these annotations should discern it with clarity and treasure it well. In the *bingzi* year of the Zhiyuan era, on the Zhongyuan festival, Kongxuanzi Dai Qizong, styled Zhongtongfu, respectfully presents this postscript.

I have heard that in ancient times, there was the Perfected One Ziyang, who expounded the subtleties of the Great Dao and rescued deluded followers from drowning. On the day of his Dao’s fulfillment, he composed the *Wuzhen Pian* to transmit to the world—all his life’s experiences were distilled therein. Those who study the Dao yet do not follow the teachings of this text are like travelers bound for the rivers and seas who abandon the oars of cinnabar.

Alas, as the ages grow distant and the winds of the Dao weaken, words become tangled, and heterodox paths cling stubbornly, slandering the immortal way. The true principles are deeply obscured, and false interpretations deny the authentic teachings. Thus, the Way of immortals is dismissed as illusory, and alchemical texts as mere absurdities. The *Wuzhen* book and the heart of the Perfected One remain utterly unrecognized in the world.

Then came Wumingzi, who took up the thread of the orthodox transmission. Mindful that the annotations had become corrupted through successive errors, he composed a new commentary for this book, releasing it into the world. Its chapters are divided, its phrases explicated, its fields and furrows delineated, and its distinctions made clear—all the celestial mechanisms are fully revealed within. Through deep reflection and careful thought, one may attain understanding on one’s own.

My great-uncle, from his earliest years, revered the Dao and studied this text for many years. Heaven awakened his heart, allowing him to hear the profound secrets. Drawing from what he learned from his father and teachers, as well as his own insights, he appended annotations to Wumingzi’s commentary, providing a standard for future seekers. Thus, they may avoid falling into illusion or drifting into absurdity.

How vast is this grace!

Wherein lies his heart? From past lives, he bore an affinity, and by good fortune, he obtained this book—truly a cause for celebration. Yet how might one find companions beyond the world’s dust, to tread the famed peaks and dwell in truth, to guard the immortal’s breeze and journey afar? To establish the crucible and furnace, to inhale and exhale the Dragon and Tiger, to invert mercury and lead, gathering them in an instant, gestating them for ten months, and refining them for nine years—then, serene, to ride the flying chariot across the Weak Waters, to mount the sacred turtle, and stand in the shadow of the immortals, hearing the great Dao of the formless and silent, to rescue those drowning in delusion. Such is his aspiration: to study under the Master of Purple Yang.

Written on the Shangsi day of the Dingchou year of the Zhiyuan era by the later student Dai Shun, bowing in reverence at the Great Cavern of Vermilion Lake.

*The Symbolism of the Golden Elixir*
Wumingzi, in his commentary on the *Awakening to Reality*, compiled and assembled the symbolic correspondences of the Golden Elixir—its metaphors and names may be said to be exhaustive. Following the foundational principles, he expanded and gathered the *Can Tong Qi* and the verses and songs of various immortal scriptures. All that he borrowed—from the celestial Dao, the images of the *Book of Changes*, human affairs, principles, and things—serves as metaphors for the Golden Elixir, its yin-yang symbolism divided into seven sections and appended to the commentary on the *Awakening to Reality*. May those who study immortality find it easier to investigate, knowing the distinctions and similarities between inner and outer, the mutual reflections of their symbolism, the sequence of the Five Phases’ transformations, and the difficulty of fixing their names. By clarifying their shared root and the reality they hold in common, and by distinguishing their metaphorical names, the wisdom of the immortal masters may be unified and grasped. Through this, one may forget the snare and attain the truth; through this, one may achieve the immortal’s Way—no small aid indeed.
