**Preface to the Reprinted *Record of Awakening to the Dao: Dispelling Doubts***

For years, I have longed for this Dao, yet the distinctions between right and wrong, orthodoxy and heterodoxy, remained elusive. In the *gengwu* year (1810), I met Master Lai Zhong, who graciously guided me to the true path of return. In the *xinwei* year (1811), I paid homage to the sacred mountains of various regions. Arriving in Gansu Province, I sought out Master Wu Yuan of Qiyun Mountain, who had continued the commentaries on the *Zhouyi Chanzhen* and the alchemical classics of past masters, as well as authored works such as *Awakening to the Dao: Dispelling Doubts* and *Discerning Difficulties in Cultivation*. His profound insights were divinely inspired, shining as brightly as the sun and stars. I immediately went to pay my respects. Scholars from all directions flocked to visit him, and even those who served as his disciples were numerous. I became his student and received his books. Upon returning to my hometown, I again visited my teacher and presented him with the works of Master Wu Yuan I had obtained, seeking clarification on their meanings. My teacher examined them one by one, expressing great admiration, and said: "The commentaries of this elder are like celestial admonitions and rules—every word a model, clear and evident, concise yet comprehensive. Truly, they are the bridge to cultivating the body and establishing destiny, the standard of the Three Teachings’ origins. Among the vast corpus of Xi Yuan’s works, none surpass these in directly pointing to the essentials, clarifying right and wrong! If one delights in these and enters the Dao, how rare and precious an affair it would be!"

At that time, many fellow seekers requested these books, but there was only one copy, insufficient for widespread circulation. My teacher said: "Keeping them for oneself is not as good as sharing them with like-minded companions, thereby propagating Master Wu Yuan’s ultimate intent, guiding later generations to the orthodox tradition—this would be a great and virtuous deed!" However, at the time, my purse was empty, making it difficult to engrave all the works. Thus, I reprinted only the *Record of Awakening to the Dao: Dispelling Doubts* for circulation, for this book sweeps away all heterodox paths, distills the essentials, and in correcting errors and clarifying orthodoxy, it is like a gourd of rescue in midstream. As for the remaining works, I rely on those of noble intent to contribute funds for their publication.

Respectfully inscribed on the Winter Solstice of the *bingzi* year, the twenty-first of the Jiaqing reign (1816), by Xia Fuheng.

**Original Preface to *Awakening to the Dao: Dispelling Doubts***

I am but an unworthy man in this world. In my youth, I studied Confucianism, but before turning twenty, I suffered three grave illnesses, nearly losing my life. Through illness, I gained insight and thus turned to the Dao, though I remained in doubt, believing that such arts of prolonging life might not exist in this world. While traveling to western Qin to recuperate, I passed through Jingyang, where I encountered an old man with disheveled hair. We met as if old friends, and I spoke to him of my pressing concerns. The elder said: "The Dao of life and destiny is within everyone’s reach—it depends only on whether one has the will or not." He also bestowed upon me an excellent prescription. Upon reaching Nan’an, I followed the remedy and treated my illnesses, which were immediately dispelled.

From that moment, I resolved to pursue the path beyond the mundane as my life’s endeavor. Yet for years, I wandered between schools—paying homage to Wang in the morning and Li by dusk—without ever hearing the true principle or encountering more than a handful of genuine practitioners. Later, while traveling in Jincheng, I heard of an elder in Kang Valley who, though clad in Confucian robes and cap, bore an extraordinary demeanor beyond all conjecture. I sought him out and, upon meeting, saw that his conduct and retreat were lofty and unlike the common run. When he spoke, his words were all grounded in principle. Though I could not fathom the depth of his attainment, I knew with certainty that he was a true master. Our karmic affinity aligned, and I was admitted to the proper gate, where he first instructed me to fulfill all human duties. Obeying his command, I returned home and, in the intervals of serving my parents, quietly studied the various alchemical classics. Yet their meanings remained obscure, their teachings inconsistent, and I knew there must be secrets still concealed.

Thereupon, I journeyed north to Yanjing, south through Henan, and traversed every prefecture of Qin and Jin, meeting countless monastics and clerics, none of whom could resolve my doubts. Later, arriving in Hannan, I encountered the Immortal Elder Xianliu, who unlocked the treasure vault and drew forth its pearls and jades, pointing them out one by one. The knot of thirteen years’ doubt was shattered to dust! Only then did I realize that the great Dao requires true transmission, that life and nature must be cultivated in tandem—far removed from the byways of heterodox paths, the clinging to emptiness, or the grasping at forms.

Yet I lament that my karmic roots are shallow, my merit and practice insufficient, my strength limited. Now, at seventy-eight, I remain midway on the journey, still far from the other shore. The boundless grace of my teachers weighs heavily upon me, and I have failed them. Though the great Dao remains unaccomplished, I have shed all deeds that harm life and nature, all sins that obstruct the Way. Thus, I have compiled the misguided paths I once wandered and the insights gained under the Dharma-eye into two works, *Record of Awakening to the Dao* and *Breaking Illusions with Symbolic Speech*, combining them into a single collection titled *Awakening to the Dao and Dispelling Doubts*. May it serve as a torch to illuminate the path for seekers.

Having not yet attained the Dao myself, I wish others to attain it, offering this as slight amends for my debt to my teachers—not daring to deceive myself or others, nor to seek empty renown.

Written as a preface on the third day of the third month in the sixteenth year of the Jiaqing reign, the *xinwei* year of the Qing dynasty, by Liu Yiming, the Enlightened One of Cloud-Dwelling Mountain, in his Abode of Ease.

**Preface to *Record of Awakening to the Dao***

The Dao pervades heaven and earth, present in all things, existing everywhere. Above, it governs the sun, moon, stars, clouds, lightning, thunder, and rain; below, it animates mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and humankind—even the tiniest crawling creatures, the sentient and insentient alike—all are manifestations of the Dao’s qi in motion. The Dao lies before our eyes; it is only that people have not delved deeply enough.

At twenty, I already knew that life and nature were a great karmic affinity. For over a decade, I earnestly sought instruction, wandering between masters, but encountered only teachings clinging to form or fixating on emptiness, never glimpsing the slightest thread of truth. Later, I met my teacher, the Elder of Kang Valley, whose few words sufficed to distinguish the true from the false. Then, encountering the Immortal Elder Xianliu, who revealed the subtleties, I finally saw the essence. Having received the secret instructions of both masters, I truly awakened to the fact that all things and affairs in heaven and earth—everything the eye sees, the ear hears, the foot treads, the body experiences—are the Dao, each containing truth. Only then did I understand that the symbols and methods described in ancient alchemical classics—pre-heaven and post-heaven, active and quiescent, medicinal substances and firing times, advance and retreat, cessation and progression, the formation and shedding of the elixir, forward and reverse circulation—all draw upon the principles already present in heaven and earth, expounding and elucidating them, not fabricating or forcing interpretations.

Alas! Later generations of seekers lack true sincerity and resolve, cannot endure hardship, nor persevere through the years. Some cling to hollow theories, others begin with zeal but end in slackness, still others adhere to heterodox practices, misleading themselves and others. Some read a few lines of alchemical texts and pride themselves on possessing the Dao. All such types obstruct their own progress, ultimately falling into delusion.

Herein, I have selected eighty-one principles from the phenomena before our eyes—things all see and know—without arranging them by rank or sequence, but analyzing each matter individually. I call this *The Record of Awakening to the Dao*, appending to it *Seventy-Two Songs of Lament for the Dao*, that those who have awakened may help all awaken.

If scholars can draw lessons from afar in things and from near at hand in themselves, use the visible to fathom the invisible, and the formed to discern the formless, delving deeply and probing subtleties with unwavering resolve, then through long and steady effort, they will surely gain insight. This is my deepest hope.

Written in the summer of the gengwu year of the Jiaqing reign (1810), by the Recluse of Unfettered Abode.

**The Record of Awakening to the Dao, Volume One**

**Heaven’s Height, Earth’s Depth**
The body of Heaven is supremely high, empty and round, boundless in expanse. It covers all things without exception, embraces all without exclusion. It gives birth to the myriad beings yet claims no virtue; it bestows grace upon them yet expects no repayment. Whether people revere or deceive it, feel gratitude or resentment toward it, whether they love or despise, praise or revile, whether beings are fierce or docile, good or evil—Heaven lets all follow their nature and takes no account.

The disposition of Earth is supremely deep, dwelling low and humble. It bears all things without fail, nurtures all without end. It supports the weight of Mount Tai and Mount Song, receives the surging torrents of rivers and seas, endures the piercing of trees and grasses, and yields to the trampling of birds and beasts. It suffers all filth and humiliation yet remains unaware.

From this I have awakened to the Dao of emulating Heaven and Earth:
If one can be magnanimous and all-embracing, aiding the aged and pitying the poor, rescuing those in peril, bestowing virtue without expecting reward, harboring no grudges, regarding self and others as one—then one may become Heaven’s disciple.
If one can be yielding and humble, free from restlessness and anger, unperturbed by slander or insult, accepting hardship and calamity with equanimity, and facing all dangers and adversities without vexation or resentment—then one may become Earth’s counterpart.
To revere Heaven and emulate Earth is to unite in virtue with them and endure as long as they do.

**Sun and Moon’s Return**
The sun’s function: by day it ascends to illuminate the outer world, by night it enters the earth to illuminate within.
The moon’s function: in its first half, it waxes to shine outwardly; in its latter half, it wanes to nurture inwardly. Though the sun and moon illuminate within and without, their brightness is one.

From this I have awakened to the Dao of employing brightness:
If one can shine outwardly—guarding speech and conduct, refraining from what is improper, unjust, or contrary to the Dao, resisting the allure of wine, lust, wealth, and temper, and remaining unstained by worldly dust and mundane affairs—then one has attained the outward brightness of the sun and moon.
If one can shine inwardly—dispelling deceit and preserving sincerity, forsaking delusion to return to truth, curbing anger and restraining desire, preventing the arising of afflictions and hatred, subduing the three poisons, expelling the six thieves, sweeping away the seven emotions, purifying the eight consciousnesses, dissolving the human mind and arousing the mind of Dao, maintaining vigilance and reverence without the slightest false thought—then one has attained the inward brightness of the sun and moon.
With inward and outward brightness complete, none remains unilluminated. In radiance equal to the sun and moon, when nurtured to perfection, one becomes perfectly rounded, luminous and resplendent, nothing in the world able to deceive. With a single wondrous awareness, one attains universal penetration, sharing in the sun and moon’s work and movement.

**Thunder Roars, Wind Blows**
Thunder roars with fierce intensity, while wind blows gently into the distance. When wind and thunder contend, they merge into one—fierceness tempered by gentleness, gentleness concealing fierceness. Hard and soft depend on each other.

From this I have awakened to the Dao of harmonizing hardness and softness:
In cultivating the Dao and establishing virtue, in handling affairs and interacting with others, those who are solely hard and aggressive, overly impetuous, will soon see their vigor blunted. Those who are solely soft and hesitant, weak and indecisive, will find their undertakings difficult to accomplish, their softness of no use.
If one can be resolute yet gradual, neither hasty nor sluggish, neither impetuous nor weak, harmonizing hardness and softness to attain the mean—then all endeavors will prosper. In studying the Dao, one will surely comprehend it; in cultivating the Dao, one will surely achieve it.
Thus the sacred scripture says: *"The mean is the great root of the world; harmony is the universal Dao."* Attaining the mean and harmony, Heaven and Earth take their places, and the myriad beings are nurtured. How can the Dao of the mean and harmony be trivial?

**The Four Seasons’ Exchange**
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter: spring gives birth to beings, summer makes them grow, autumn harvests them, and winter stores them. Each has its succession, cycling endlessly, linked without interruption.

From this I have awakened to the Dao of mutual dependence between decrease and increase:
To decrease is to reduce one’s excess of hardness and impetuosity; to increase is to supplement one’s deficiency in softness and weakness. Hardness must not be excessive, nor softness insufficient. Hardness is tempered by softness, softness employed through hardness. When hardness and softness complement each other, yin and yang correspond. Then one may be great or small, high or low, advance or retreat, move forward or reverse, unbound by form, proceeding both straight and curved—thus aligning with the sequence of the four seasons and moving without obstruction.
Within this body is a Heaven and Earth; within this mind is a creation. One is no longer bound by the Heaven and Earth of the cosmos.

**The Moon Borrows the Sun’s Light**
The moon is purely yin without yang; it borrows the sun’s radiance to generate its own brightness. Its light waxes and wanes.

In observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of borrowing yang to transform yin. The human body is originally purely yin without yang; it must borrow yang from another household to become yang. What is meant by "another household"? To my household, all things are another household—Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the myriad things, the myriad affairs. What is meant by "yang of another household"? It is the primordial, formless, true unity of qi, the undying person. Since birth, this qi is inherently possessed, but upon engaging with the postnatal, it gradually scatters into Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the myriad things, and the myriad affairs, no longer belonging to me but to another household. Knowing that this qi resides in another household, one may steal it back at any time to return it to my household, turning nothing into something, loss into recovery—just as the moon borrows the sun’s light to generate brightness. This is the celestial mechanism of seizing creation and inverting yin and yang. Those deluded fools in the world who mistake women for another household are truly seeds of hell.

**Establishing the Furnace and Tripod**
In the alchemical art of refining the elixir, one must first establish the furnace and tripod. The tripod is a hard vessel, used to contain the medicine; the furnace is a soft vessel, used to regulate the fire. If the tripod is not firm, the medicine is easily lost; if the furnace is not stable, the fire scatters wildly. In observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of forging and refining body and mind. A resolute will in Daoist cultivation is the tripod; the longer and more steadfast the effort, unyielding and unshaken, is the establishment of the tripod. Constant vigilance is the furnace; gradual and unhurried practice is the stabilization of the furnace. When furnace and tripod are secure, one forges away the seeds of rebirth accumulated over kalpas, revealing the original face of the primal yang from the beginning of this life, shedding all postnatal impurities. When the ore is exhausted and the gold is pure, it is the renewal of the old. From here, one may dismantle the furnace and tripod, reset the tongs and hammer, and undertake the work of transcendence—melting true gold into essence and frost, returning to the state before parents gave birth. Thus, the alchemical classics and Daoist texts place the establishment of the furnace and tripod as the first step.

**Yang-Sui and Fang-Zhu**
The *yang-sui* is separated from the sun by countless miles yet can draw fire from within it; the *fang-zhu* is separated from the moon by countless miles yet can draw water from within it. This is because the qi of the *yang-sui* and *fang-zhu* is of the same kind as the sun and moon. In observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of summoning and gathering yin and yang. The yin and yang of the human body are originally harmonized as one qi, but upon engaging with the postnatal, yin and yang separate, each residing in its own place. Vital qi daily diminishes, while mortal qi daily increases, diminishing further and increasing further, until finally, exhaustion ensues. If one knows to turn the light inward and reflect, borrowing the false to cultivate the true, then in an instant, yin and yang will spontaneously unite without forced effort. The deluded remain separated by a thousand miles; it depends on whether one can sincerely commit.

**Dung Beetles and Lions**
The dung beetle rolls its ball, the lion gathers its sphere; over time, offspring are born within the ball, and lions emerge from the sphere. Though the ball and sphere are originally dead matter, containing nothing within, they unite in spirit without physical contact, resonating through the two qi of male and female. With undivided intent and spirit concentrated, qi coalesces, enabling formlessness to generate form, nothingness to produce something. In observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of generating something from nothing. Humans are endowed with the yin and yang qi of Heaven and Earth at birth, and thus possess these two qi within. If one can guide yang to yin, making yin comply with yang, and gather yin and yang together, then within the vast and obscure, a spark of life arises from nothingness. This can congeal the sacred embryo and give birth to the Dharma-body. When the work reaches its culmination, one shatters the void, gains a body beyond the body, walks the sun and moon without form, enters metal and stone without obstruction, and transcends beyond creation itself!

**Black Lead and Mercury**
In the art of furnace and fire, mercury flies upon encountering fire, but when black lead is added, the mercury is restrained, congealing into a solid mass that no longer scatters. In observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of using yang to restrain yin. The human heart is easily moved, coming and going without fixed time or place, stirred by circumstances and emotions, drifting like dust in the wind—just as mercury flies upon encountering fire. If the Dao-heart is constantly present, guarding against danger and reflecting on risks, then the human heart will have no opportunity to arise, just as mercury congeals upon encountering lead. With further diligent practice in augmentation and reduction—augmenting the yang qi of the Dao-heart and reducing the yin qi of the human heart, augmenting further and reducing further—when there is nothing left to augment or reduce, the human heart dies and the Dao-heart is firmly established. The true seed is in hand; one may become a sage, a worthy, an immortal, or a buddha. The great foundation of nature and life is thus established, and in undertaking the work of transcendence, there is none who does not deeply cultivate and naturally attain.

**Playing with Shadows and Mocking Images**
A child plays with its shadow, delighting in it, unaware that the shadow plays with the child, wasting spirit in vain. A madman mocks an image, believing himself capable, unaware that the image mocks him, exhausting words to no avail. In observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of avoiding misfortune and attaining blessing. The people of the world are insatiably greedy, scheming for profit and gaining it, seeking fame and attaining it, believing this suffices to nourish and glorify the body. Yet they do not realize that day and night, they labor their minds, expending essence and dissipating spirit, harming the true through the false. When the time comes that qi and blood decline, and the great limit arrives, wealth cannot buy life or death, and adversaries cannot resist impermanence. Only karmic retribution follows, and in the next life, each receives their due—how is this different from the child playing with its shadow or the madman mocking the image?

Should a person of wisdom and insight hold life and destiny in highest regard, prizing virtue and the Dao above all else, they would look down upon worldly concerns, cherishing qi and nurturing spirit, never allowing the false to harm the true. Even the transformations of yin and yang could not sway them—how much less could anything else! Plant millet, plant hemp: sow millet and millet is reaped; sow hemp and hemp is reaped. Hemp does not become millet, nor millet hemp—the seeds differ.

Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of karmic cause and effect. When a single thought in a person turns toward goodness, all their actions follow in goodness, and they are certain to receive blessing. When a single thought turns toward evil, all their actions follow in evil, and they are certain to invite misfortune. Good and evil thoughts are the causes of affairs; receiving blessing or inviting misfortune are their effects. Where there is cause, there must be effect—never has goodness been sown only to yield evil, nor evil sown only to yield goodness. The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow, fixed and unchanging, differing only in whether one sows goodness or evil. Thus the noble person, in all undertakings, plans from the very beginning, for by being vigilant at the outset, they ensure completion in the end.

Graft peach, graft apricot: when an old peach tree is grafted with a tender shoot, it bears peaches again; when an old apricot tree is grafted with a tender shoot, it bears apricots again. Though the tree is old, the qi of its root remains unbroken.

Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of rejuvenation in old age. When people grow old, it is always due to indulging passions and desires, a hundred worries disturbing the heart, ten thousand affairs wearying the body, expending essence and dissipating spirit, mistaking the false for the true, and suffering for pleasure. The last spark of vitality is gradually exhausted, nature becomes disordered, destiny unsteady, and the root ungrounded. Thus they pass from vigor to age, from age to death—not to be blamed on heaven, but truly self-inflicted.

Yet if one awakens to repentance, transforms their ways, severs the entanglements of love and attachment, and abandons wine, lust, wealth, and temper; if they regard riches and honor as floating clouds, and power and profit as bandits and foes; if they empty themselves of the ten thousand things and cling to nothing, concentrating qi like an infant, guarding simplicity like a maiden, conserving essence and nurturing spirit, casting off delusion to return to the true; if at every moment they cultivate the root, and at every step walk the right path, increasing right mindfulness and diminishing false thoughts, inwardly and outwardly sincere, wholly aligned with Heaven’s principle—then they may fulfill their nature, establish their destiny, reverse aging, and return to youth. This is the method of grafting tender shoots onto an old tree.

The ancient immortals said: *"At seventy or eighty, so long as a single breath remains, one may still refine the elixir."* This is no empty claim! The water snake transforms...

When hair falls into a watery ditch and is scorched by the summer sun, it transforms into the shape of a serpent—why is this so? Though hair is a dead thing, when it meets the dampness of water and the heat of the sun, moisture and warmth converge, coalescing into a single qi. Within the profound obscurity, a spark of vitality stirs, faint yet active, and so it metamorphoses into a serpent, writhing and swaying in the water.

Observing this, I grasped the Dao of consolidating the root and congealing destiny. The human yang qi pertains to fire, while yin qi pertains to water; when yin and yang harmonize, the qi of water and fire mutually sustain each other. Within this lies a spark of vitality, growing from the subtle to the manifest, ceaselessly generating. Thus, the declining may flourish, the weak may strengthen, the lifeless may congeal destiny, and the short-lived may prolong their years—this is the Dao of deep roots and firm foundation, of long life and enduring vision.

The crane’s embryo and the tortoise’s breath: the crane excels at preserving spirit, so its embryo remains steadfast and it lives a thousand years; the tortoise excels at nurturing qi, so it need not eat and yet lives a hundred years without dying. From this, I perceived the Dao of prolonging life and increasing longevity. If one humbles and lowers oneself, remaining soft, weak, simple, and sincere, not dissipating qi but constantly nurturing it, then qi will be abundant. If one is selfless and carefree, with few desires and little scheming, not exhausting spirit but constantly preserving it, then spirit will be whole. With qi abundant and spirit whole, the root is firm, the foundation stable—enduring without decline, prolonging life and increasing longevity is a matter of certainty. If the crane and tortoise, one preserving spirit and the other preserving qi, can yet attain long life, how much more so for those who preserve both spirit and qi—how could they not achieve longevity?

Water freezing and ice melting: water meets cold and freezes into ice; ice meets heat and melts back into water. From this, I understood the Dao of becoming sage or common. At the origin of humanity, nature is fundamentally good, with no distinction between sage and common. Yet through the accumulation of habitual qi, the difference between common and sage arises. Those who habituate themselves to goodness and do not lose their Heaven-endowed nature become sages; those who habituate themselves to ungoodness and lose their Heaven-endowed nature become common. If the ungood reform their faults and turn toward goodness, habituating themselves to goodness and restoring their Heaven-endowed nature, though common they become sages. If those originally good do not remain vigilant and cautious, drifting with the wind and dust, habituating themselves to ungoodness and deluding their Heaven-endowed nature, though sages they become common. Goodness is like water, ungoodness like ice. The sage may become common, the common may become sage—just as water may become ice, and ice may return to water. Thus, the Dao of the *Great Learning* lies in illuminating the luminous virtue and abiding in perfect goodness.

The flourishing tree and the long-flowing water: when a tree’s roots run deep, its leaves naturally flourish; when a water’s source is distant, its flow naturally endures—such is the way of those with a foundation. From this, I grasped the Dao of safeguarding the root. The original essence, original qi, and original spirit of the human body are the very source of nature and destiny. If original essence is not depleted, form remains whole; if original qi is not harmed, destiny remains firm; if original spirit is not obscured, nature remains luminous. With form whole, destiny firm, and nature luminous, the ten thousand things cannot sway one, and the workings of creation cannot constrain—nature and destiny depend on oneself, not Heaven. This is like the tree with deep roots and flourishing leaves, the water with a distant source and long flow: with the root established, the Dao arises, and vitality endures unceasingly. Yet most people do not know to safeguard the root, instead busying themselves with the branches and twigs, vainly seeking to attain the Dao—like climbing a tree to catch a fish, they are bound to fail. How foolish!

The pine’s heart and the bamboo’s joints: the pine’s heart is solid, the bamboo’s joints are firm, so they withstand winter’s cold without withering and endure snow and frost while flourishing. From this, I perceived the Dao of cultivating and establishing destiny. If one is free from shame and self-reproach, maintaining reverence and sincerity, embracing great unity without self, then the heart is solid. With a solid heart, wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot sway, power and force cannot bend—facing affairs without fear, encountering difficulties without worry. Whether fortune or misfortune, circumstances lie with others, but the forging of destiny lies with oneself. If one governs the body and controls affairs, abiding where one ought, standing firm without wavering, then the joints are firm. With firm joints, one does not tread where propriety does not permit, does not dwell where the Dao does not reside, does not act where righteousness does not allow. One may endure hardship or sweetness, rise or fall, live or die; ever responsive, ever tranquil, unmoved by external things. With a solid heart and firm joints, one may dwell in ease or peril, act or rest, adapt without hindrance, unbound by form. In all directions, through adversity and favor, nothing can obstruct.

Wood, charcoal, unfired brick: when wood’s branches are exposed for long, they rot; but when fired and tempered into charcoal, they endure a thousand years without decay. When water and earth mix to form unfired brick, rain dissolves it; but when fired and hardened into brick, it endures ten thousand years. From this, I grasped the Dao of refining the true through tempering. People fail to attain the Dao because they have not been tempered in the great furnace of creation. If one treads firmly step by step, experiences and overcomes every trial, standing unshaken at the gate of life and death—like true gold, the more it is refined the brighter it shines; like a precious mirror, the more it is polished the more luminous it becomes—when tempered and polished to a state of perfect roundness, radiant clarity, utter purity, and unadorned simplicity, where being and nonbeing alike dissolve, self and other both vanish, form and spirit unite in wonder, merging with the true Dao—then, like wood turned to charcoal or unfired brick to brick, once fired and tempered, they endure forever without harm.

When a corpse lies buried for long, if even a scrap of flesh does not decay, it becomes an evil spirit and harms people...

When hair from a corpse is exposed for long, damp heat steeps and steams it, turning it into will-o’-the-wisp that bewilders people. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of escaping great calamity. In the human body, inside and out, top and bottom, there is not a single thing that is not an evil spirit or ghostly specter. Externally, the eyes, nose, mouth, tongue, and body form cliques to summon external demons; internally, the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys drag one another into delusory thoughts. With internal and external forces joining in attack, one’s innate nature is hacked away until life itself is lost—how can such harm and bewilderment be spoken of lightly? The ancient master said: “The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body. If I had no body, where would calamity come from?” Thus, this body is one’s great calamity. If one can cast off this calamity, the one without calamity remains. The one without calamity is the true self. The Way to cast off calamity begins with recognizing the true self. Only when one recognizes the true self does one know that this body is other, and that other and self are entirely unrelated. Casting off the other by means of the self is as easy as turning a hand; it requires no effort. Yet how is it that those who cultivate the Dao often take the other as the self, regard calamity as true, cherish and cling to it, dwell beside ghosts, and refuse to let go? There are even fools who, upon this thing of great calamity, move this and that, take from below to patch above, push forward and pull back, vainly hoping to attain the Dao. Such people are all making servants into masters and mistaking thieves for sons. Not only can they not cast off calamity, but they increase it, so it is no wonder that they rush about all their lives only to end in emptiness and ruin.

When water is below and fire above, water is cold and fire is dry, and since water and fire are in different places, they cannot mutually support one another. If water is above and fire below, then the dry does not flame, and the cold can warm. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of the union and separation of yin and yang. A person’s yang qi is firm; if firmness lacks restraint, it becomes excessively dry, like fire above. Yin qi is soft; if softness lacks support, it becomes overly weak, like water below. When firmness and softness do not support one another, solitary yin does not generate, and solitary yang does not grow—vital qi is extinguished. If firmness is not dry, and softness moves firmness, it is like fire below; if softness is not weak, and firmness supports softness, it is like water above. When firmness and softness are balanced, yin and yang are harmonious, nature and vitality merge, and water and fire mutually support one another—this is what is called “the inversion of Kan and Li.” Within melons and fruits there are seeds, and within seeds there are kernels; each kernel has two lobes, and within the lobes there is a heart. This heart is a spark of vitality, and the growth of melons and fruits all originates from it—this is what is called “the heart of Heaven and Earth.” Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of the vitality of yin and yang. Only when yin and yang unite is there a kernel; with a kernel, the heart of Heaven and Earth is contained. When yin and yang do not unite, there is no kernel, and without a kernel, there is no heart of Heaven and Earth. The heart of Heaven and Earth is the root of all generation. Those who attain this heart become sages and worthies, buddhas and immortals; those who lose this heart become humans and beasts, ghosts and demons. Whether one has this heart or not depends entirely on the union or separation of yin and yang. If scholars can harmonize yin and yang, neither leaning nor inclining, and return to the central and upright, then the heart of Heaven and Earth reappears. Whatever they grasp is the Dao, and wherever they step is truth. The pivot of creation lies within their grasp.

Muddy water is inherently turbid, but when settled, it becomes clear; a tarnished mirror is inherently dull, but when polished, it becomes bright. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of clarifying the mind and perceiving one’s nature. When a person’s mind is unclear and nature unsettled, greed, anger, delusion, and desire—all are present; joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—all are complete. Added to this are the karmic roots and sensory dust accumulated over kalpas, along with habitual and external qi that bewitch the lord of the mind and block the numinous aperture. It is like muddy water and a tarnished mirror. The original true mind and true nature are entirely obscured, left to the manipulations of the Three Corpses and the ravages of the Six Thieves. Without dust, it is not stained; without things, it does not contain—yet the filth in one’s breast is beyond words. If one can suddenly awaken and turn back, wash away dust and grime, and gradually refine and polish all the biases, illnesses, external qi, delusive thoughts, and perverse actions accumulated since birth, the longer and harder one refines, the more one reaches the point where there is nothing left to refine. When the ore is exhausted, the gold is pure. The original mind and original nature naturally appear in full, and wisdom-light suddenly arises, illuminating the three thousand worlds as if in the palm of one’s hand, without the slightest obstruction. It is just like muddy water settling to clarity again, or a tarnished mirror being polished to brightness once more—yet the original nature remains undiminished.

When people move, they generate heat; when they sit still, they generate cold. Cold leads to movement, which generates heat again; heat leads to stillness, which generates cold again. Thus, cold and heat do not come from Heaven but from people. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of the subtle workings of yin, yang, and creation. The firm belongs to yang, and the soft belongs to yin. If the firm is too restless, humbling and lowering oneself naturally reduces restlessness, returning to harmony. If the soft is too weak, establishing resolve and acting with strength naturally overcomes weakness, ascending to brilliance. Being able to be firm and soft, following principle and timing, knowing advance and retreat, being able to be great and small, high and low, empty and full—one can seize creation, reverse life and death, counter the flow of qi, and emerge from death into life. It is just like movement generating heat and stillness generating cold—human effort can reverse Heaven.

A Lofty Terrace and a Great Tree
A hundred-foot terrace rises from the earth; a tree of ten spans grows from a sprout—neither comes to be in a single morning or evening, for their origins lie in gradual accumulation. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of profound attainment through self-cultivation.

The matter of one’s nature and life is the greatest affair under Heaven; preserving and fulfilling one’s nature and life is the most difficult task under Heaven. It cannot be achieved with ease, nor sought by skipping steps. One must tread firmly upon the earth, advancing step by step, experiencing each affair in turn. From lowliness one ascends to loftiness, from shallowness one enters into depth. Gradually applying effort, without reckoning years or months, and without losing heart, one will surely reach the place of fulfillment. One must never drift through days in procrastination, nor halt halfway and abandon the work, thereby bringing sorrow upon oneself. Such an enduring and unchanging endeavor requires enduring and unceasing effort to succeed. If one begins with diligence but ends in slackness, or indulges in empty fantasies, and yet seeks to preserve one’s nature and life, achieving what is rare under Heaven—this is utterly impossible. Thus the sage says: “A person without constancy cannot even become a shaman or physician,” let alone master the great matter of nature and life!

Hollows Fill and Mounds Wear Away
A low hollow, over time, naturally fills; a high mound, over time, naturally wears down. For emptiness is the omen of fullness, and height is the cause of lowliness. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of diminishing and augmenting, emptiness and fullness.

Those who are arrogant and self-important, relying on talent and ability, claiming sagacity and self-aggrandizement, are often despised by others. More often than not, they bring trouble upon themselves through their fullness, and in the end, they inevitably fall below others and lose their loftiness—just as a mound, over time, is trampled and wears away. Those who are humble and self-effacing, diminishing their cleverness and destroying their cunning, lowering their hearts and subduing their qi, are often respected and loved by others. More often than not, they benefit from their emptiness and in the end, advance above others without remaining low—just as a hollow, over time, accumulates and fills.

Thus, the noble person’s Way grows ever higher while their heart grows ever lower; their virtue daily expands while their heart daily diminishes. All arrogance vanishes, and all restlessness is transformed.

The Carp and the Old Fox
The carp can transform into a cloud-dragon; the old fox can transform into a feathered immortal—both achieve this through the perfection of their spirit and the power of their form to change. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of spiritual penetration and transformation.

Those creatures, the fish and the fox, receive the partial qi of Heaven and Earth, yet what they rely upon is but a spark of consciousness. Only humans, as the most numinous of all beings, receive the true qi of Heaven and Earth. The Five Phases are complete within them, and the Five Virtues are all present. Standing at the center of the Three Powers, they possess the full capacities of Heaven and Earth. If one can nurture the true qi of Heaven and Earth, preserve the harmonious qi of the Five Phases, remain unbiased and upright, and allow the qi to flow as a single, undifferentiated current, then one will possess the creative power of Heaven and Earth. One can transform into a sage, evolve into an immortal, with both form and spirit in perfect harmony, merging with the Dao in truth. Then, one will undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, transformations without end—how could it be merely a matter of changing form?

The Transformations of the Spirit-Dragon
The dragon’s numinosity is manifest: it can be great or small, rise or descend, conceal or reveal itself. It can pierce mountains and shatter rocks, ascend on clouds and travel with the rain—how can it do all this? By the power of its spirit. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of the unfathomable transformations of spirit.

What enables a human to be human is spirit. When spirit abides, there is life; when spirit departs, there is death. Spirit, as a thing, penetrates Heaven and pierces the depths, reaches back to antiquity and knows the present. It enters where there is no crevice too fine, and it is present where there is no place too remote. It enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning, enters metal and stone without obstruction. Vast, it fills the cosmos; minute, it enters the tip of a hair. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped. It cannot be transmitted in words, nor depicted with a brush. When skillfully employed, its transformations follow the moment. One can unite virtue with Heaven and Earth, brightness with the sun and moon, order with the four seasons, and auspice and ill-fortune with ghosts and spirits. It precedes Heaven, yet Heaven does not oppose it; it follows Heaven, yet accords with the seasons. It is like the transformations of the spirit-dragon, which cannot be discerned through form or traces.

Withered Wood and Cold Ashes
Withered wood, when burned, yields no flame; cold ashes, when stirred, give no heat. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of transforming one’s qi and disposition.

The nature one receives from one’s qi and disposition is the greatest harm. At the slightest provocation, one becomes violent and unrestrained, harming Heaven and violating principle, stepping into water and fire without knowing it, entering pits and wells without awareness, disregarding one’s nature and life, heedless of life and death—such calamities are manifold. If one can master oneself and return to propriety, turn from rigidity to softness; sweep away all caution, resentment, and vexation; remove all competitive and domineering tendencies; transform the violent and restless nature of one’s blood and qi, returning to a nature of warmth and tranquility; concentrate the qi and attain softness, empty the heart and nurture the spirit; be without self and others, without this and that; observe things from afar, and things are no longer things; observe the body up close, and the body is no longer a body; look within at the heart, and the heart is no longer a heart—without knowledge or perception, empty and vast—then, like withered wood that yields no flame when burned, or cold ashes that give no heat when stirred, one can abide within creation without being moved by creation, dwell within yin and yang without being constrained by yin and yang.

Near Vermilion, Near Coal
Things near vermilion, over time, are dyed by it and must turn red; things near coal, over time, are stained by it and must turn black. Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of the habituation to good and evil.

When one dwells with good people, one constantly hears good words and sees good deeds. Good words and good deeds, perceived through the ears and eyes, over time take root in the heart. Without intending to be good, one naturally becomes habituated to goodness.

When one dwells with evil people, one constantly hears evil words and sees evil deeds. Evil words and evil deeds, perceived through the ears and eyes, over time take root in the heart. Without intending to be evil, one naturally becomes habituated to evil.

Though it is said that good and evil people are so by nature, the greater part is formed through habituation. Thus, the noble person must choose their neighbors when dwelling and select their friends when associating.

Infantile Innocence
An infant at birth is without knowledge or perception, untouched by wine, sensuality, wealth, or temper; free from the entanglements of love and attachment; unaware of wealth or poverty, prosperity or adversity; unmoved by water, fire, blades, or weapons. Without the mark of self, without the mark of others; without the mark of sentient beings, without the mark of longevity. All things are empty, and no dust clings. With an iron face and no sentiment, purely innocent.

Observing this, I have awakened to the Way of returning to youth from old age. If one can suddenly awaken and turn back, shedding all existence; abiding in a realm of no affairs, dwelling in a sphere of no form; uprooting the dust of kalpas past, sweeping away the habitual tendencies of this life; letting go of all attachments, empty and vast, clear and pure—

Though the form may age, the nature returns to its origin; though the exterior may weaken, the interior remains truly robust—this is the return from old age to youth, this is the original face of the infant. Otherwise, with celestial innocence lost, the body strong and plump like swine or oxen, what benefit is there?

**The Bellows and Piston**
The bellows and piston are objects with openings at both ends, a tongue within each opening, hollow and straight in the center. The hollowness is their essence, the straightness their function. The openings at both ends are the gates of ingress and egress. The two tongues are the mechanisms of opening and closing. As the piston moves back and forth, gathering and releasing, empty yet unyielding, movement generates wind—opening and closing, ebb and flow, arise naturally of themselves.

Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of cultivating the essence and function of the true. If one can make emptiness within the core as essence and straightness of heart as function; free from selfishness and desire, allowing the heavenly principle to flow—then hardness and softness will balance, movement and stillness will harmonize, the crooked and straight will find their mean, and the hidden and manifest will adapt to the moment. One may then share the qi-mechanism of the empty void, partake in the same transformative workings as heaven and earth. Like the bellows and piston, hollow and straight, coming and going, breathing naturally, the qi-mechanism unceasing—how could one not attain longevity?

**The Dipper’s Handle and the Lunar Establishment**
The seven stars of the Northern Dipper: the first four are called the *Kui*, the last three the *Gang*, also known as the Dipper’s handle. Where the handle points is auspicious, where it rests is inauspicious—when it points to *yin*, the month is established in *yin*; when it points to *mao*, the month is established in *mao*. In a year, it shifts twelve times, corresponding to the twelve months, for where it points, the vital qi flourishes.

Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of reversing the qi-mechanism. A person’s firm qi is like the *Gang* star in the heavens: when firm qi operates externally, the exterior is auspicious while the interior is inauspicious; when firm qi operates internally, the interior is auspicious while the exterior is inauspicious—just as where the *Gang* star points is auspicious, yet where it rests is inauspicious. Since birth, entangled in the postnatal, one’s firm qi has been entirely expended externally—contending for victory, prizing strength, clinging to the false and abandoning the true—while internally, the Three Treasures suffer harm. Thus, auspicious qi scatters outward, inauspicious qi gathers within. Over years and days, yang is exhausted and yin becomes pure—how could one not die?

Therefore, the perfected person reverses the Dipper’s handle, revolves the *Kui* and *Gang*; employs firm qi internally, slays the Three Corpses, eliminates the Six Bandits, severs the ten thousand entanglements, sweeps away all dust. Not allowing the false to injure the true, not permitting the external to disturb the internal—auspicious qi is born daily, inauspicious qi diminishes daily; life upon life, dissolution upon dissolution. When auspicious qi becomes pure and inauspicious qi is transformed, how could one not attain longevity?

**The Madman and the Drunkard**
The madman leaps over walls yet falls unharmed; the drunkard tumbles from a carriage yet, though swift, does not die. Why is this? Because they forget their form and know nothing of it.

Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of nurturing life and preserving form. What humans rely upon to live are the Three Treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. When the Three Treasures gather, life arises; when they scatter, death follows. To gather the Three Treasures, one must first eliminate the self. Without self, the heart becomes empty; when the heart is empty, the Three Treasures neither leak nor seep, neither diminish nor deplete—only increasing, never decreasing. With increase and no decrease, growth upon growth, the internal becomes full. When the internal is full, the life-force ceaselessly flows, and longevity is attained. Those madmen and drunkards merely forget their form and yet do not die—how much more so when spirit is whole, qi is abundant, and essence is firm? There is none who cannot preserve life.

**Grasping the Essential**
To gather a net, one must grasp its headrope; to fold clothes, one must hold their collar—both begin with the essential. Observing this, I have awakened to the fundamental Dao of cultivating truth. The human heart is the master of the body, the root of becoming a sage, a worthy, a buddha, or an immortal. When the heart is still, all entanglements quiet; when the heart stirs, scattered thoughts arise. If one can make the heart empty of all things, vast and hollow—inner thoughts not leaking out, external objects not entering in—constantly responsive yet constantly still, constantly still yet constantly responsive—then, though dwelling daily amid bustling splendor, one remains as bright as a mirror, as still as water, without dust or ripples. Naturally, one is not swayed by circumstances, just as gathering a net by its headrope or folding clothes by their collar—left or right, all is fitting.

**Sifting Gold and Selecting Jade**
Gold is sifted from sand, jade is picked from stone—not to be obtained casually, but only through arduous effort and deep merit. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of gradual cultivation and deliberate action. The true treasure of the primordial is like gold and jade; the false things of the acquired are like sand and stone. The acquired false things bury the primordial true treasure, just as sand and stone bury gold and jade. Thus, to seek the primordial true, one must sweep away the acquired false. The true is the numinous root of the primordial qi; the false comprises the karmic seeds of countless kalpas, the acquired temperament of qi and disposition, the qi of the Five Phases, and the biases of accumulated habits. When the one true is buried amid ten thousand falsities, it cannot be easily obtained. Therefore, one must employ the work of gradual cultivation, sweeping away the false to reveal the true. Sweep and sweep again, sweeping until nothing remains to sweep—then the false is entirely gone, and the true naturally shines bright, manifesting before the eyes, just as sand and stone are removed to reveal gold and jade. This is the merit of bitterness yielding sweetness, fragrance emerging from stench.

**The Well-Sweep Drawing Water**
The well-sweep draws water: its bucket descends empty and ascends full, cycling endlessly to irrigate the fields. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of employing emptiness and fullness. If one can empty the heart and humble oneself before others, one will surely receive benefit, becoming full within and rising above others. The more one empties, the more one fills; the more one lowers, the more one rises. Emptiness without end, fullness without end, lowering without end, rising without end—emptiness and fullness, lowering and rising, rising and lowering. When above and below communicate, emptiness and fullness respond, and virtue overflows, there is none who does not ascend to the realm of loftiness and clarity. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"Submissive beneath the bed, employing many shamans and diviners—auspicious."* For the Dao is loftier the lower the heart.

**Plants, Flowers, and Fruit**
Plants first bloom flowers, then bear fruit, each in its proper season, thus attaining long life. If they lose their season, it is a sign of death, precisely because they defy the natural order. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of moving in accord with the times. What humans depend upon to live is spirit and qi. When affairs arise, one cannot but respond; when things come, one cannot but engage. Govern affairs by affairs, accord with things by things. Do not welcome what has not yet come, do not cling to what has passed. Spirit is not harmed, qi is not depleted—like plants blooming and fruiting in season, this is the way to life. But if one covets wealth and lust, schemes for merit and fame, plots day and night, premeditates what has not yet come, and clings to what has passed, spirit and qi are consumed—like plants blooming and fruiting out of season, this is the way to death. Therefore, the noble person cherishes spirit as a treasure: when used, it shines without dazzling; when stored, it is still and unmoving. Proceed when one can proceed, stop when one must stop—proceeding and stopping without losing their proper place, never allowing the false to injure the true.

**Wooden Puppets and Clay Idols**
Wooden puppets and clay idols are inherently dead things, yet if one worships them with sincerity, over time they respond with numinosity. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of reviving the dead and restoring life. The people of the world take the false for the true, suffering for joy, wandering daily amid dusty entanglements, entering nightly into the realm of dreams and illusions. Day in use, night in labor—all are paths to death, not life. Though the body moves, the heart is already dead; though the form remains, the spirit is long gone. Day after day, year after year, yang qi is exhausted, leaving only yin qi—how could one not die? But if one truly knows that worldly affairs are all false and awakens with sudden clarity, wholeheartedly and without duality, without thought or worry, focusing only on refining life and nature, vigilant and cautious, guarding against the subtle and blocking the gradual—with time and deep merit, the heart becomes bright, the spirit becomes numinous, inner thoughts do not arise, external things do not enter. With the true and no false, one can move heaven and earth, subdue ghosts and spirits, seize the workings of creation, surpass the myriad things, level hell, ascend to heaven, open the gate of life, close the door of death, and extend years to add longevity—this is a principle that can be decisively affirmed.

**The Lamp’s Radiance**

**The Lamp’s Radiance**

The radiance of a lamp illuminates the room, making the interior bright while the doorway remains dark; when moved outside, the doorway becomes bright while the room grows dim. Observing this, I awaken to the Dao of discerning right and wrong through illumination. A person’s wisdom and intelligence are like the light of a lamp. If its radiance is misdirected outward—striving for dominance, pursuing fame and profit, scheming day and night, lost in endless calculations, chasing illusory realms—one strays from the root, bright without but dark within, never ceasing until body and life are harmed. Yet if a true person abandons the false to return to the real, discards cleverness and shatters cunning, takes life and nature as the great matter, turns the light inward to reflect, refines the self and steadies the heart, looks down upon all things as empty, unshaken by external objects, unstained by the dust of phenomena—bright within and dark without—one may approach sagehood, become a buddha or immortal, attaining a brightness beyond brightness, ascending to the highest clarity. Thus the sutra says: *"Great wisdom appears foolish, great skill appears clumsy."*

**Fermented Wine and Rice Congee**
To brew wine, one must use ferment; without it, no wine can form. To make congee, one must use rice; without it, no congee can be made. Ferment inherently contains the essence of wine, thus it can produce wine; rice is the essence of grain, thus it can produce congee—each follows its own kind. Observing this, I awaken to the Dao of life and nature depending on their own kind. *Nature* here refers to heavenly nature, not the nature of temperament, but the nature transcending temperament; *life* refers to heavenly mandate, not the span of years, but the mandate beyond life and death. Those who cultivate the real and seek to refine life and nature must seek the seed of life and nature. Cultivating this seed, life and nature may be perfected; cultivating what is not this seed, life and nature are instead harmed. This seed is neither external things like metals, stones, grasses, or woods, nor internal things like blood, essence, qi, or fluids. All tangible, visible things are not of the same kind as our life and nature—how could they perfect them? Know that the true seed of life and nature is none other than the original, precelestial, true unity of qi. This qi cannot be seen, heard, or grasped; it cannot be sought within the body nor found outside it; it does not depart from this body, nor does it cling to it. It dwells in the realm of the indistinct and obscure, concealed within emptiness and stillness. Contained, it is true emptiness; manifested, it is wondrous being. It cannot be transmitted in words nor depicted in writing—if forced to describe it, this *〇* alone suffices. If forced to name it, Confucians call it the *Supreme Ultimate*, Buddhists call it *Perfect Enlightenment*, Daoists call it the *Golden Elixir*. Though the names are three, the thing is one—this alone is the true seed of life and nature. *Exhausting principle* means exhausting this true seed; *fulfilling nature* means fulfilling this true seed; *extending life* means extending this true seed. Knowing this true seed and cultivating it in reverse, refining nature with it, nature becomes clear; refining life with it, life becomes established. Thus the *Triple Concordance* says: *"Things of the same kind are easily worked upon; without the seed, skill is in vain."* Just as wine requires ferment and congee requires rice.

**The Resonance of Bell and Drum**
A bell rings when struck, a drum resounds when beaten—because they are solid without and hollow within, empty at the center, thus they can ring and resound. Observing this, I awaken to the Dao of true emptiness and wondrous being. *True emptiness* is like the hollowness of a bell or drum; *wondrous being* is like the sound produced when they are struck. If one abides in this true emptiness as substance and employs this wondrous being as function—constantly still, constantly responsive; constantly responsive, constantly still—motionless yet profoundly still, moved yet instantly penetrating; moved yet instantly penetrating, still yet profoundly still; empty yet not empty, not empty yet empty; spiritually penetrating, vibrantly alive—within the great furnace of creation, all is refined and transcended. When filth is removed, the mirror shines; when clouds disperse, the moon appears. The indestructible vajra body is revealed, rising beyond the transformations of yin and yang, enduring as long as the great void.

**Puppets and Kites**
Puppets can nod on stage, kites can soar in the sky—because a person controls them with strings. Observing this, I awaken to the Dao of the body’s movement and stillness governed by spirit. The body is like a puppet or kite, a dead thing; spirit is like the person; qi is like the strings. When spirit moves qi, the whole body becomes lively, able to move and be still—just as a person controls a puppet or kite with strings. Spirit moves qi, qi moves the body, enabling walking and stopping, speaking and acting. If cultivators of the real know how to govern qi with spirit and nourish spirit with qi, merging spirit and qi, within the indistinct and obscure, there is something with essence—its essence most true. Gathering and returning it, transformations are endless. Then one may control heaven and earth—how could it be merely controlling this illusory body?

**The Parrot and the Stone Monkey**
A parrot, when taught, can speak; a stone monkey, when taught, can perform tricks.

The parrot and stone monkey do not possess these abilities by nature; it is through gradual human instruction that they acquire them. Observing this, I have awakened to the true Way of seeking teachers and befriending worthy companions. Those two creatures—the parrot and the stone monkey—are mere birds and beasts. If even birds and beasts, when guided by humans, can learn human speech and human dances, how much more so for humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings? If one finds an enlightened teacher to point the way and good friends to provide aid, there is none who cannot ascend to the realm of the lofty and luminous. Truly, if one knows to bow before a wise teacher and associate with good friends, sincerely discerning their principles, borrowing their knowledge to dispel one’s own ignorance, and drawing from their insight to dispel one’s own foolishness—then even the dull-witted will become enlightened, even the weak will become strong. How could one not attain immortality? How could one not achieve Buddhahood?

Yet all those ignorant learners in the world, who rely on their own opinions, make wild guesses, and engage in private speculation, pretending to wisdom while refusing to humble themselves—such people only lead themselves astray. Though they may deceive others, they truly deceive only themselves, treating the great matter of life and destiny as child’s play. No wonder they pass their lives in vain, achieving nothing by old age—how pitiful!

**Elm Pods and Shepherd’s Purse**
In the second month, as the myriad things flourish, elm pods fall; in the eighth month, as the myriad things withdraw, shepherd’s purse sprouts. This is the image of virtue containing punishment, and punishment containing virtue. Observing this, I have awakened to the true Way of employing benevolence and righteousness together.

Benevolence is the Way of softness, rooted in compassion; righteousness is the Way of hardness, rooted in decisive action. Benevolence without righteousness leads to indiscriminate love, blurring right and wrong; righteousness without benevolence leads to harsh judgment, inevitably causing injury. Both extremes lose the Middle Way. When benevolence and righteousness proceed together, there is resoluteness within compassion, preventing the confusion of right and wrong; and there is adaptability within decisiveness, preventing rigid inflexibility. This is like the elm pods falling in the second month—virtue concealing punishment—and shepherd’s purse sprouting in the eighth month—punishment containing virtue. Thus, the Way of harmony is not lost.

**Longing for Water, Longing for Fire**
When dry, one longs for water; drinking water relieves the dryness.

When cold, one longs for fire; obtaining fire dispels the cold. Observing this, I grasp the Dao of mutual necessity between yin and yang. The Dao holds that solitary yin cannot generate, nor can solitary yang grow. When yang reaches its extreme, yin follows; when yin reaches its extreme, yang continues. Neither overindulge in yang nor incline toward yin—yin and yang in harmony, hardness and softness in balance—then the qi flows as one, the source remains unexhausted, and the life-force never ceases. Thus, one’s nature may be fulfilled and destiny established, unshaken by the myriad things, unburdened by the myriad affairs. In the dust yet beyond it, in the world yet apart from it. Otherwise, solitary yin or solitary yang, yin and yang divided, hardness and softness mismatched—life’s vitality ceases, growth halts, and daily depletion leads to peril.

**Facing South, Facing North**
Facing south, one must turn away from north, seeing only south and not north; facing north, one must turn away from south, seeing only north and not south. Observing this, I grasp the Dao of resolutely choosing goodness. If one’s heart is set on goodness, all one sees is good, all one thinks is good, all one associates with is good, all one does is good—day and night, nothing but goodness, knowing only goodness and not evil. If one’s heart is set on evil, all one sees is evil, all one thinks is evil, all one speaks is evil, all one associates with is evil, all one does is evil—day and night, nothing but evil, knowing only evil and not goodness. Seeing good and not evil, seeing evil and not good—righteousness and wickedness do not coexist, loyalty and treachery do not share the same court. Thus, the noble person sees goodness as if never enough and shuns evil as if scorched by boiling water. Guarding the Dao like a treasure, with single-minded resolve, unyielding through a hundred trials, unwavering until death—ceasing only when profound attainment is reached, never before.

**Cutting Grass, Planting Trees**
To cut grass, one must dig out the roots; if roots remain, it will regrow. To plant a tree, one must strengthen its base; if the base is weak, it will wither. Observing this, I grasp the Dao of shedding the false to cultivate the true. Human desires and habitual tendencies are all false, like grass; one’s original nature and innate goodness are true, like a tree. To shed the false, one must uproot all desires and habits completely, lest they regrow. Even the slightest residue, if left, will fester over time, growing from small to great and causing immense harm. To cultivate the true, one must constantly attend to one’s inherent celestial purity, nurturing it moment by moment—watering with spiritual essence, warming with true fire, never disturbing or shaking it, protecting it in every way. Only when the root is firm and qi abundant, spirit whole, can one remain unshaken by the myriad things, unburdened by the myriad affairs, free from future calamity. Thus, shedding the false must leave no trace of falsehood, like cutting grass and digging out all roots; cultivating the true must leave no trace of untruth, like planting a tree with a deep and sturdy base. As the ancient scripture says: *"A single thread of yin qi unexhausted, and one cannot become immortal; a single thread of yang qi unexhausted, and one cannot die."* This is no empty truth.

**Full Vessel, Half Vessel**
A full vessel overflows, and overflow brings loss; a half-filled vessel does not leak and remains ever sufficient. Observing this, I grasp the Dao of prosperity and calamity in fullness and emptiness. Those who are self-satisfied, relying on ability or talent, knowing only advance and not retreat, only strength and not weakness, thinking only of themselves and not others, with lofty hearts and arrogant qi—over time, they invite disaster, and their fullness becomes useless. Those who are humble and yielding, deferring to others, neither full nor overflowing, not boasting of merit or flaunting talent, constantly examining their faults, honoring others’ strengths, knowing contentment and restraint, advance and retreat—such people will surely attain good fortune, rising from lowliness to heights. Thus it is said: *"Humility brings benefit; fullness invites loss."* Fullness is not as noble as humility.

**Vessels and Adornments**
Every vessel has its inherent nature; to alter it without cause, adorning it with colors, inlaying it with gold and jade—though it may seem dignified, its original nature is lost. Observing this, I grasp the Dao of returning to simplicity and purity. Human nature, in its original state, is pure and flawless. After birth, roots and senses awaken, knowledge expands, and through accumulated habits and attachments, those fond of wine are deluded by wine, those fond of beauty by beauty, those fond of wealth by wealth, those fond of anger by anger, those fond of riches and honor by riches and honor, those fond of amusement by amusement. With a hundred schemes and a thousand tricks, they satisfy their hearts, deceiving openly or secretly to gratify their desires. All their actions chase after the false, finding joy in suffering, mistaking poison for medicine. Their original nature is entirely buried, even to the point of risking life and limb without care, inviting disaster without awareness. Thus, the ancient sages taught people to clarify goodness and return to the beginning, to restore simplicity and purity, to reclaim their original face. Restoring that original face—pure, bare, untainted, free from worldly entanglements—is the seed of sages and immortals, the essence of buddhas and transcendents. This is what is called the *true person*.

**Form and Qi**
All things with form must decay; all things with qi must die. Form and qi are the causes of growth and decline, life and death. Observing this, I grasp the Dao of transcending life and death. Humans receive the qi of the five phases after birth and take form, and within that form lies the qi of the five phases. This qi within the body, when activated, becomes the five thieves.

The Five Thieves are joy, anger, sorrow, delight, and desire. These Five Thieves band together, consuming and depleting one’s true primordial essence—hence, where there is life, there must be death.

The *perfected person* transforms the postnatal to restore the prenatal; abides in the midst of emptiness, concealing spirit in the realm of stillness. They do not violate the qi of the five phases, nor are they swayed by the myriad things. Without smoke or flame, they resemble withered wood or cold ashes; without color or form, they are like the vast emptiness of a valley. Heaven and earth cannot constrain them, nor can creation impose its patterns upon them. This is what is called "stealing yin and yang," "wresting the mechanism of qi," "taking life into one’s own hands, not leaving it to Heaven’s dominion."

For heaven and earth can govern the formed, but not the formless; they can govern the qi-endowed, but not the qi-less; they can govern the mindful, but not the mindless. Without mind, there is no qi; without qi, there is no form. Without mind, without qi, without form—there is only emptiness. What can heaven and earth do to emptiness? As for giving life, bringing death, causing success or failure, they can only bring life and death, success and failure to form and qi—how could they bring life and death, success and failure to emptiness?

**Echo in the Empty Valley**
Within an empty valley, when one shouts, the sound is transmitted—commonly called the *valley spirit*. Since it has sound but no form, it is named after the spirit of the valley. Observing this, I grasped the Dao of nurturing spirit through emptiness.

When a person embodies emptiness, they become the valley; within that emptiness, a single spark of numinous qi lies hidden within—this is spirit. Such a valley, though motionless and silent, responds when stirred—only the valley can give rise to spirit, and without the valley, there is no spirit. The marvel of spirit lies precisely in the valley.

Yet the people of the world, their private desires piled high, block their spiritual apertures with the thatch of defilement. How can such a one possess a valley? Without the valley, they remain lost and confused to the end, as if drunk or dreaming, their numinous qi entirely dissipated. How could they possess spirit? Having lost their spirit, though alive, they are as good as dead.

If one can sweep away all entanglements, purge accumulated stagnation, and become utterly bare—nothing remaining—then within the empty valley, in a state of vague yet vivid presence, something arises, something refined. Without striving for spirit, one attains it; a call elicits a response, utterly numinous and sagely. Released, it pervades the six directions; withdrawn, it retreats into secrecy. One may thus ascend and descend, flowing in harmony with heaven and earth.

**Scales and Measures**
To weigh an object, one must use a scale—only then is its weight precise. To measure an object, one must use a ruler—only then is its length known. Observing this, I grasped the Dao of applying medicinal substances and fire timing.

Medicinal substances are the two qi of yin and yang; fire timing is the process of cultivation. Impartiality and balance are like the scale; progression and retreat are like the ruler. Using the method of impartiality and balance, one gathers the two qi of yin and yang, ensuring their weight is just right—neither too much nor too little. A pound of sixteen parts: the medicinal substances are sufficient. Using the method of progression and retreat, one applies the fire timing, measuring duration with precision—advancing and retreating, completing the work in a single breath. The fire timing is thus achieved.

The weight of medicinal substances depends entirely on impartiality; the sequence of fire timing depends entirely on progression and retreat. To be impartial and balanced, to know when to advance and when to retreat—this ensures the authenticity of medicinal substances and the accuracy of fire timing. The great Dao is then easily attained.

Alas! Discerning urgency and slowness, distinguishing fortune and misfortune, lies in the craftsman’s judgment. Understanding progression and retreat, knowing when to stop and when to be content—how could the ignorant accomplish this? The application of medicinal substances and fire timing—how easily is it known?

**Rafts, Traps, and Nets**
To cross a river, one must use a raft; once the river is crossed, the raft may be discarded. To catch fish, one must use a trap; once the fish are caught, the trap should be put away. Observing this, I grasped the Dao of prolonging life through techniques.

Techniques are methods—the methods of cultivating reality. From the moment yang reaches its extreme and gives rise to yin, humans daily bore holes in their primordial nature. The Six Thieves run amok, the five phases clash; the Three Corpses stir within, the Seven Emotions rage without. The primordial numinous root is daily hacked away, nearly exhausted. Without the great method of subduing the dragon and taming the tiger, without the craftsman’s skill to turn the Dipper’s handle, how can perverse qi be eliminated and true qi fully restored? This is why such methods must be employed.

Yet the great Dao is naturally non-action—why resort to forced methods? The reason methods must be used is to eliminate their harms. Once all harms are removed, the method becomes unnecessary—just as a raft is used to cross a river, but once the river is crossed, the raft may be discarded; a trap is used to catch fish, but once the fish are caught, the trap should be put away. This is the principle of using and then not using methods.

It is also the principle of prolonging life through techniques: once life is prolonged, techniques are no longer needed. However, before life is prolonged, one must use techniques to seize creation, reverse the mechanism of qi, and shift the stars and constellations. Only then can life be taken into one’s own hands, not left to Heaven, and one may transcend the three realms and five phases.

**Hibernating Insects Revived**
All insects hibernate in autumn and revive in spring—life arises from hibernation. Observing this, I grasped the Dao of finding life within death.

The reason humans cannot attain longevity is that they cannot first die. To die is to die to the human heart. The obstinate heart of flesh is the commander of the Seven Emotions, Six Desires, Five Thieves, and Eight Consciousnesses. A thousand perversities and a hundred monstrosities are drawn to it; like a pack of foxes and dogs, they invade and wound the Dao-heart. When the human heart constantly arises, the Dao-heart constantly dies. When the Dao-heart dies, true qi dissipates, and life’s foundation is shaken. One who does not die in this way has never existed.

To give life to the Dao-heart, one must first die to the human heart.

When the human heart dies, all thieving factions—like snakes without heads—perish of themselves. Once annihilation is complete, the Dao-heart naturally revives, and true qi returns. This is what is meant by "after long darkness, light dawns"—death gives way to life, just as insects first hibernate and then revive.

The pearl in the oyster, the chick from the hen’s egg—when the old oyster holds the pearl, the pearl forms; when the hen broods the egg, the chick emerges. All this arises from the undissipated spirit and qi. Observing this, I grasped the Dao of nurturing the sacred embryo.

The sacred embryo is the embryo of the sage—it is the original root of our life. When the original root returns, the sacred embryo congeals, like the oyster already possessing the pearl or the hen already possessing the egg, though not yet fully formed or hatched. At this stage, no forced effort is required; one need only focus single-mindedly on the center. Do not let the water dry up; do not let the fire grow cold. Guard against danger, anticipate peril—guard it, anticipate it. From tender it grows firm; from faint it becomes manifest. Naturally, a single grain-like precious pearl will burst forth from the furnace of creation—unobstructed through heaven and earth, unrestrained in all directions, one with the emptiness of space. It is like the oyster holding the pearl without qi dissipating, or the hen brooding the egg without spirit departing. When the fire-timing is ripe, the pearl will form of itself, and the chick will emerge of itself.

The phoenix rarely appears, and so is revered as an auspicious omen; the peacock flaunts its splendor, and so is hunted by men. Observing this, I grasped the Dao of concealment and revelation, fortune and misfortune.

Those who reveal themselves—relying on talent, flaunting ability, competing for dominance, striving for victory, expending effort on the false path—often invite misfortune. Those who conceal themselves—diminishing cleverness, destroying cunning, humbling the heart, working diligently at the essential—often attain good fortune.

To invite misfortune is to employ brightness outwardly; to attain good fortune is to employ brightness inwardly. Outward use leads to mistaking the false for the real, depleting essence and dissipating spirit, straying onto the path of death. Inward use leads to casting off delusion and preserving sincerity, storing essence and nurturing life, returning to the gate of life. Whether brightness is used outwardly or inwardly determines fortune or misfortune, life or death.

Thus, the noble person severs the external to cultivate the internal, while the petty person pursues the external and loses the internal—just as the phoenix and the peacock differ in concealment and display, so too do they differ in attaining good fortune or inviting misfortune. How can one not be cautious in the use of brightness!

*Record of Awakening to the Dao, Scroll the Lower*

At midday the sun must decline, at fullness the moon must wane—this is the unchanging principle of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, growth and decay, in ceaseless cycle. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of "civil and martial fire" in the cultivation of the true.

When the original root has yet to be restored, one must summon and gather the primordial, advancing with courage and vigor to nurture its growth and return it to its source. Once the original root is fully restored—like the sun at its zenith or the moon at its fullness—yang qi is abundant. When yang is full, one must then follow with yin. At this moment, one must swiftly employ the gentle Dao to nurture and warm, dispelling the harsh and restless qi, guarding against perilous calamities. Conceal brightness and cultivate obscurity, focus the mind without distraction, seal and store tightly, using one part yin to conceal one part yang, allowing not the slightest leakage. This is like the sun at midday inevitably declining, the full moon inevitably waning—both yang fire and yin tally must be applied. The hexagrams transform, and the end returns to the beginning; yang qi is born anew, becoming the essence of unyielding strength and purity. The sacred embryo is completed, opening into a realm beyond the human—this is the primordial within the primordial. With further cultivation, one grain begets another, growing from the subtle to the manifest, reaching a state of sacredness beyond comprehension—this is called the numinous.

A sleeping person dreams, encountering realms of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, lands of wealth, nobility, fame, and profit. The dreamer takes these as real, unaware of their dream-state. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of the depth of cultivation in the true.

Since birth, wine, lust, wealth, and temper have deluded the mind, while thought, love, emotion, and desire have obscured the nature. All within and without is false, and the true is entirely lost. For the cultivator, if even the slightest impurity remains unrefined, though the great Dao is in sight, completion is not permitted—this is because the roots of misfortune have yet to be fully eradicated. How to verify this? Verify it in dreams.

If, within the dream-state, wine, lust, wealth, and temper cannot stain, and kindness, love, emotion, and desire cannot cling—remaining unmoved and unshaken, pure and bright, untouched by falsehood—only then is the true seen. If, with deeper cultivation, no dreams arise at all, only then are the roots of misfortune fully eradicated. Thus it is said: the perfected person has no dreams. For the dreamless, cultivation has reached its utmost; for those who dream, cultivation has yet to attain. If one dreams yet knows it is a dream within the dream, cultivation has advanced; if one dreams yet does not know it is a dream, cultivation is entirely absent. When cultivation reaches its peak and not a single dream arises, then creation is at hand—though asleep, one is awake; though dead, one lives. What dies is the physical form, what lives is the Dharma-body; what sleeps is the eyes, what awakens is the primordial spirit.

Merchants seeking profit must first prepare capital, then know how to apply it. Only with capital and the skill to use it can profit be gained. If one has capital but lacks the skill to use it, or has the skill but lacks capital, all efforts are in vain. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of employing both method and wealth.

The cultivator of the true accumulates virtue and establishes conduct, conserves essence and nurtures spirit, steadfast in thought, growing stronger with time, unwavering even unto death. Sincerity in action is like accumulating wealth. Seeking a teacher’s oral instructions, one knows the beginning and the end, understands advance and retreat, discerns urgency and patience, recognizes fortune and misfortune, and knows when to stop and be content—proceeding step by step. Obtaining the true medicine and maintaining the fire without dissipation is to possess the method. With both wealth and method, one employs wealth to serve the Dao and uses the method to cultivate the Dao. With method and wealth in tandem, progress is seen at every step, and ultimate attainment is achieved—just as a merchant with capital and the skill to use it gains great profit at every turn.

If one has wealth but no method, or has the method but no wealth, and rashly seeks to advance, one will ultimately fall behind. Though the great Dao is in sight, it will not permit one’s completion—just as a merchant with capital but no skill to use it, or with skill but no capital, will never gain great wealth. Thus, the true cultivator must first seek within, then seek without, ensuring both method and wealth are complete to avoid missteps on the path ahead.

The nature of the ape is wild and restless; when bound by chains, it follows human direction and cannot run amok. The nature of the horse is stubborn and unruly; when bridled and reined, it follows human control and cannot bolt or leap. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of rectifying the mind and making the will sincere.

The human mind’s obstinacy arises and recedes without pattern, its origin unknown—like the ape’s wildness, never still for a moment. Human deluded thoughts arise and vanish without constancy, shifting here and there—like the horse’s unruliness, never resting for an instant. The obstinate mind and deluded thoughts, these two allies, nourish human desire and obscure heavenly truth. Thereby, the nature and life are gradually harmed, bringing the most severe calamities and greatest harm.

The first step in cultivation is to rectify the mind and make the will sincere. When the mind is rectified, all things are empty; when the will is sincere, all thoughts cease. With all things empty and all thoughts stilled, one may cultivate the nature and the nature becomes clear; one may cultivate life and life is established.

Yet the study of rectifying the mind and making the will sincere is not easily accomplished—it requires earnest effort to succeed. Earnest effort lies in vigilance in solitude. Vigilance in solitude means being cautious in what is unseen and fearful in what is unheard, maintaining awareness and self-examination at all times, preventing the obstinate mind and deluded thoughts from stirring even in the most hidden recesses—just as binding the wild ape and reining the unruly horse, not allowing them to indulge their natures.

Since ancient times, immortals and perfected beings have likened the mind to a monkey and the will to a horse, for they truly saw that the mind and will are unruly and obstructive to the Great Dao, and thus cannot be relaxed even for a moment. If a scholar can truly restrain the obstinate mind and return it to rectitude, transform the deluded will and restore it to sincerity, then the Dao of nature and life may be more than half realized.

In the world, when man and woman unite, they bear sons and grandsons, generation after generation continuing without end. Yet if there is man without woman, or woman without man, solitary yin cannot give birth, and solitary yang cannot grow—life’s mechanism ceases. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of becoming an immortal or a buddha.

At the beginning of human life, yin and yang harmonize, and the sacred embryo is perfectly formed. But upon entering the postnatal realm, yin and yang separate, and the sacred embryo is harmed. Those of the highest virtue, with deep-rooted foundations, encountering a perfected master early, need not wait for yin and yang to separate before cultivating the Dao of non-doing, directly ascending the other shore and attaining the sacred rank. Those of middling or lesser capacity, with ample prenatal qi but postnatal qi dispersed, true yin and true yang kept apart and failing to unite, exhaust their vital mechanism—if they do not first practice the Dao of doing to harmonize yin and yang, how can the sacred embryo be re-formed? The method of harmonization is simply to return yin and yang to a single qi.

Yet true yang, having flowed outward and taken refuge in another’s dwelling, lost and unable to return, must be sought with painstaking effort, undeterred by the distance of the journey, carefully and patiently searched for. Sometimes, upon encountering it, a single call brings it back, leading it home to unite with true yin. Husband and wife reunite, their affection deepened, and naturally a spark of life arises from the void, congealing to form an embryo. Nurtured for ten months, a body is born beyond the body. With three more years of nourishing care, it gathers into form and disperses into qi, now hidden, now manifest, becoming an indestructible vajra body.

This Dao is no different from the way man and woman give birth to a child. Yet ordinary father and mother give rise to the physical body, while the numinous father and sacred mother give rise to the true body. One ordinary, one sacred—between birthing immortals and birthing humans, heaven and earth lie far apart. As Master Sanfeng said: *"Following the flow makes one mortal; reversing it makes one immortal—only a single inversion lies between."* How difficult it is to comprehend this celestial mechanism! Those blind fools in the world who practice perverse arts of inversion with men and women merely plant the seeds of hell—how could they form a sacred embryo?

Opening the door allows qi to flow; lifting the window lets light enter.

If the door is shut, inner and outer remain unconnected; if the window is closed, light and qi are barred from entry. Observing this, I have awakened to the great mechanism and great function of the Dao.

Those in the world who cultivate the Dao often stray into side paths and winding trails—some shut their eyes to contemplate emptiness, some seclude themselves in stillness, some sit in meditation to summon spirits, all self-assured in their possession of the Way. Yet they do not know that the Dao is the transforming principle of heaven and earth, yin and yang. Scattered across the six directions, it is not too much; gathered into a single qi, it is not too little. All things within the universe, sentient and insentient, all the myriad forms of existence, owe their birth and completion to it. Every thing possesses it, every person is endowed with it—only humans dwell within the Dao yet remain unaware of it, like fish in water who do not know water.

To cultivate this Dao, one must act within the creative transformations of heaven and earth, yin and yang, verifying it through the ten thousand things and ten thousand affairs, practicing it before thousands and tens of thousands. This is a living, vibrant, free and untrammeled, luminous and upright endeavor—how could it be achieved by shutting oneself indoors in silent sitting or extinguishing the mind in dull emptiness? To seek the Dao through shutting doors and sitting in stillness, extinguishing the mind in dull emptiness, is like closing doors and windows, cutting off inner and outer, leaving only a pitch-black void where no sky or sun can be seen—what Dao could be realized thus? If one claims to have attained the Dao, it must be a Dao of pitch-black darkness!

As the *Wuzhen pian* says:
*"In cultivation, mingle with the world and harmonize your light,
Round when round, square when square;
Whether manifest or hidden, yielding or resisting—none can fathom,
How then could others see your conduct and concealment?"*
And again:
*"Know that the great hermit dwells in the court and marketplace—
Why retreat to deep mountains to guard solitary stillness?"*
To mingle with the world and harmonize one’s light, to dwell in the court and marketplace—this is the true application of exerting great function, activating great mechanism, and cultivating the great Dao.

**Matchmaking and Betrothal**
In the world, when a man and woman marry, without a matchmaker they cannot meet. The matchmaker conveys messages between the two families, while the betrothal transmits the passage of the moment. Without a matchmaker, any marriage is illicit union, a clandestine coupling that cannot last. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of harmonizing nature and emotion.

Nature belongs to the inner, the eastern household, and is yin; emotion belongs to the outer, the western household, and is yang. When nature and emotion are divided, yin and yang are obstructed—like the daughter of the eastern household and the son of the western household, who never meet. If one wishes to unite emotion with nature, pairing yin with yang, without the work of the Yellow Dame, they cannot become one family.

The Yellow Dame is our true intention, also called true faith. Faith can connect self and other, faith can harmonize yin and yang—it is the first true treasure of the Dao cultivator, indispensable from beginning to end, in both action and non-action, in gathering medicine and circulating fire, in forming and releasing the elixir.

As the *Wuzhen pian* says:
*"If Kan and Li lack wu and ji,
Though they contain the four images, no elixir forms;
Only because each holds true earth,
Can the golden elixir return."*
Wu and ji are the true faith within true intention. Wu-faith is the outer Yellow Dame, like the matchmaker; ji-faith is the inner Yellow Dame, like the betrothal. These two are the true matchmakers within our body. Knowing these matchmakers and using them to harmonize nature and emotion, nature and emotion unite; to harmonize yin and yang, yin and yang meet. The two households become one, and the golden elixir subtly takes form.

**Tasting Food**
When eating, one must chew slowly and deliberately—sour, sweet, bitter, spicy—only when the flavors are discerned in the heart can one truly know their taste. Once the taste is known, what pleases the palate is swallowed, what is harsh is discarded; whether to accept or reject is left to one’s own judgment. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of investigating principles and distinguishing the real.

The study of nature and life is most subtle, most profound, most refined, most delicate. If one’s understanding is not true, one’s practice will be misguided—it will not only be of no benefit but may even cause harm. Therefore, one must first investigate principles: for every part of principle understood, one part of practice is achieved; for every ten parts of principle understood, ten parts of practice are achieved. The full realization of nature and life depends entirely on the depth of one’s investigation of principles.

The method of investigating principles proceeds from shallow to deep, from coarse to fine, peeling away one layer to enter another, peeling and entering again and again, until there is nothing left to peel and nowhere left to enter—only then can one see the root and recognize the origin, which is the ultimate achievement. It is like tasting food to discern its flavor before swallowing.

Yet even if one has some realization, if it is only seemingly correct but not truly so, one may still err. One must further seek verification from the wise, expanding one’s understanding, embracing what is correct and discarding what is not—only then can one succeed.

As the *Yijing* says: *"Investigate principles to the utmost, fully realize nature, and thereby reach life."* To investigate principles is to investigate the principles of fully realizing nature and reaching life. If one does not know what nature is or what life is, how can one fully realize nature and life? What could one possibly accomplish?

Those foolish practitioners of the Dao mistakenly believe nature resides in the heart and life in the kidneys; or that nature is in the Heavenly Valley and life in the cinnabar field; some guard the kidneys to cultivate life, some still the heart to cultivate nature; some cling to dull emptiness to cultivate nature, some practice sexual arts to replenish life; some fix their spirit at the fontanelle to nurture nature, some consume elixir pills to prolong life. These are all like gazing at plums to quench thirst or squeezing the eyes to produce flowers—ultimately, they lead to emptiness and ruin. Such people do not even know what nature and life are, yet vainly seek to realize them—how foolish!

**Climbing Mountains and Crossing Rivers**
When climbing a mountain, one must exert effort step by step—only upon reaching the summit can one rest. When crossing a river, one must proceed with caution step by step—only upon reaching the far shore can one relax.

When climbing a mountain and nearing the summit, to rest even one step short is still to remain halfway; when crossing a river and approaching the far shore, to grow careless for even one step is still to court danger. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of bodily exertion and steadfast practice.

A true teacher is hard to encounter, and the great Dao is hard to know. Yet if one is fortunate enough to meet and understand it, one must tread the path with unwavering sincerity, accomplish the great Dao, and repay the teacher’s grace—without the slightest slackening. For the study of nature and life is the foremost great matter under heaven, and also the most difficult. One must steel the heart and firm the resolve, establish an unchanging course, remain vigilant from dawn to dusk, and persevere with ever greater effort—only then may one succeed. One must not alter one’s resolve due to minor demonic obstacles, nor cease effort upon seeing slight effects; one must not be distracted by hardship in clothing and food, nor retreat in thought when strength proves insufficient. Neither should one vainly long for the accomplishment of the great Dao, nor fear the long journey ahead. With a heart dead to all else, one must fix the mind single-pointedly and press forward without cease—naturally, there will come a day of liberation. This is like climbing a mountain step by step with effort, until one reaches the summit; or crossing a river step by step with caution, until one reaches the far shore. Otherwise, if one hesitates in fear or begins with diligence only to slacken in the end, even if the great Dao lies within sight, it will not permit one’s attainment.

Reflect: since birth, both within and without the body, one is entirely enveloped in yin qi. Though a trace of yang qi remains, it lies hidden and unseen. Without a resolve that endures even unto death, and the mighty strength of a vajra-like iron man, how could one transform yin into yang, ascend the ten-thousand-foot mountain, and emerge from the boundless sea of suffering?

**Moths and Earthworms**
The moth flings itself at the lamp and perishes in the flame; the earthworm seeks warmth and dies from exposure. Both creatures love brightness yet harm their own lives. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune.

People of the world follow their desires, contend for fame and profit, indulge in wine and lust, take the false for the real, and the bitter for the sweet. Day and night they toil, morning and evening they worry, depleting their essence and exhausting their spirit. Not until their last breath do they cease—like the moth that burns itself in the lamp, or the earthworm that dies from seeking warmth. This is to rush to death without King Yama’s summons.

If one knows to cherish life, one humbles oneself and honors others in every matter, retreats and yields in every affair—like a fish swimming in the depths, or a turtle burying itself in the mud. Neither praise nor blame reaches one; neither misfortune nor fortune assails one. Without seeking life, one attains life; without courting death, one avoids death. This is the finest method of seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune. Yet fools value external things and treat life lightly, hastening their own demise.

**Silkworms and Bees**
The silkworm spins silk to protect itself, yet does not know that humans take its silk and harm its life; the bee brews honey to sustain itself, yet does not know that humans take its honey and end its life. Both creatures seek to preserve their lives, yet hasten their own deaths. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of interdependence between benefit and harm.

All fear death, and fearing death gives rise to the desire for life. With the desire for life, one must labor for clothing and food, toiling day and night on the winding path, accumulating wealth and grain to preserve life. Ordinary people believe this sustains life, yet in truth, it does not nurture life—it hastens death. How do I know this? When the desire to preserve life grows strong, the care for the body grows weak. With the body neglected, one labors day and night, secretly injuring the spirit, causing qi and blood to decline—already treading the path to death.

There are even those who know neither life nor death: though a hundred illnesses assail them, and their lives hang by a thread, they cannot bear to part with food or clothing. The older they grow, the more they covet, persisting in delusion until death. How do they differ from the silkworm that spins silk or the bee that brews honey, only to bring about their own demise?

The truly wise, however, possess another method of preserving life. They do not fix their minds on clothing and food, nor set their hearts on wealth and profit. They forsake worldly treasures to accumulate the treasure of the Dao, and lighten attachment to the physical body to nurture the true body. Nothing in the world can sway them—what harm or benefit could there be?

**Borrowing Seed**
What the farmer values above all is seed. Those with land and seed have all they need at hand, with no need to borrow from others. But for the poor and destitute—those who have land but lack seed—must seek others to resolve the matter. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of cultivating the truth by borrowing seed.

What is meant by "seed"? It is the primordial, true, unified qi. When this qi flows in accord, it gives rise to humans and all beings; when it reverses its course, it gives rise to immortals and buddhas. Thus, the alchemical classics and Daoist texts all regard this qi as the true seed of immortals and buddhas.

Originally, this true seed is complete in every person, perfectly round in each. But after engaging with the postnatal world, yin qi arises and yang qi wanes, burying the true seed until no trace remains. Though the determined may purify the mind and still all conditions, this is but an empty field—how can it relieve hunger and thirst, or save one’s nature and life? Thus, borrowing the true seed becomes unavoidable.

To borrow seed is to seek from another’s household for one’s own. The "other household" refers to others. To make another’s possession one’s own, one cannot take it empty-handed—one must approach with propriety, humble oneself, and win their favor to borrow the true seed. Once the true seed is obtained, the sprout appears with the planting, and results manifest immediately, without effort. Otherwise, if the cauldron lacks the true seed, one merely boils water and fire in vain—nothing of substance will ever come of it.

Yet people fail to recognize what the true seed is or where the "other household" lies. Many mistakenly take women as the "other household," resorting to perverse arts of extraction, or consume the first menses of plum blossoms and other filthy substances—how laughable and lamentable!

Alas! The medicine emerges from the southwest, the position of *kun*. To seek in *kun*’s domain, how could one depart from humanity? The truth is plainly revealed—only fear that when you meet it, you will fail to recognize it as real.

**Tortoise Concealed, Fish Hidden**
The tortoise hides in mud and comes to no harm; when it emerges, men seize it.
The fish lurks in the depths and preserves its form; when it surfaces, birds rend it.
Observing this, I awakened to the Dao of harming life and preserving life.

People cannot preserve life but instead rush toward death because they cannot conceal their brilliance or nurture obscurity. Relying on their own cleverness and deploying their talents and wit, they scatter the mind and disorder the nature. Thus, the upright *qi* wanes day by day while the perverse *qi* waxes, the root of life trembles—how could they not die?

Therefore, the perfected person generates no inner thoughts and admits no external things. Presence is as absence, fullness as emptiness; they appear foolish and inarticulate, their clarity unused, their light unshining. They do not let the false injure the true or the external disturb the internal. They respond only after being moved, rise only when pressed, and act only when unavoidable. Though outwardly they may engage, inwardly they remain unengaged; though the body may move, the heart never stirs. Approaching, one sees no head; following, one sees no tail. Even the workings of creation cannot restrain them—how much less can misfortune and harm assail them? They are like the tortoise buried in mud, beyond human grasp, or the fish hidden in the depths, beyond the reach of birds.

**Oil Exhausted, Charcoal Spent**
When oil is exhausted, the lamp goes out. If one replenishes it before it runs dry, the flame endures without end. When charcoal is spent, the fire dies. If one adds more before it burns away, the blaze remains unquenched.
Observing this, I awakened to the Dao of sustaining life and nurturing vitality.

Heaven and Earth possess the virtue of cherishing life. They wish all people to live long and never desire their early death. Yet people bring death upon themselves and blame it on fate—how foolish! Consider all things: in spring they sprout, in summer they grow, in autumn they bear fruit, in winter they store. When spring returns, they sprout again; when summer returns, they grow again. Those that live long without dying follow the natural sequence of the four seasons without artificial contrivance—thus they endure.

Only humans, endowed with the upright *qi* of yin and yang and the Five Phases, fail to follow nature. They indulge in excess, take suffering as pleasure, poison as medicine, pursue fleeting joys, and gratify desires, hacking away at their root. Over time, their spirit is exhausted, their true numen extinguished—like a lamp going out when oil is spent, or a fire dying when charcoal is consumed. They reach their end.

If one is a heroic being of this world, prizing life and nature, guarding the spirit as one guards gold and jade, cherishing the true numen as one cherishes rare treasures; if one does not set foot in the great fire pit or thrust oneself into the arena of strife; if one constantly attends to the root, fixes the mind on the Dao and virtue; if one is cautious within and vigilant without, concealing the spirit and storing the *qi*—this is what is meant by the noble person attending to the root, for when the root is established, the Dao arises. It is like replenishing oil before the lamp goes out, or adding charcoal before the fire dies: those without life may gain life, and those without birth may attain long life.

Can life and death truly be left to Heaven alone?

**Lotus in Mud, Chrysanthemum in Frost**
The lotus stem is hollow, so though it emerges from the mire, it remains exceptionally pure. The chrysanthemum blooms late, so though it meets autumn frost, it appears exceptionally fresh. For when the center is empty, external things cannot stain it; when the flower blooms late, its *qi* is full and it endures the cold.

Observing this, I awakened to the Dao of cultivating the internal to resist the external.

That creation can restrain me, the myriad things can shift me, misfortune and harm can injure me—it is not that creation truly restrains, the myriad things truly shift, or misfortune and harm truly injure. It is all because I, seeing circumstances, generate emotions; encountering things, generate thoughts; stirred by the wind, raise waves. I know the front but not the back, know strength but not weakness—thus I restrain myself, shift myself, injure myself.

If one can ensure that the myriad conditions do not arise and not a single thought is born, remaining ever pure and ever still, then external things cannot enter and guest *qi* cannot mingle. Like the lotus rising from water, it remains unstained by filth. If one can restrain talent and wit, appear clumsy in great skill, foolish in great wisdom, conceal actions and obscure traces, prioritize softness and weakness, then misfortune and fortune cannot reach them, slander and praise cannot touch them. Like the chrysanthemum in late autumn, it endures the frost.

Can those who cultivate the Dao not take purity, stillness, softness, and weakness as their foundation?

**Lantern in a Cage, Brazier with a Cover**
A lamp without a cage goes out when the wind blows; if caged, though the wind blows, it does not go out. A brazier without a cover becomes dirty when dust falls; if covered, though dust flies, it remains clean.

Observing this, I awakened to the Dao of protecting and sustaining the numinous essence.

My numinous awareness is like the lamp or brazier; true knowing is like the cage or cover. If numinous awareness lacks the shelter of true knowing, the consciousness-spirit seizes the numinous to generate delusion. When encountering circumstances, it shifts; the false takes charge, the true retreats, and perverse *qi* obscures upright *qi*—like a lamp going out or a brazier becoming dirty, losing its original face.

If numinous awareness is matched with true knowing, using true knowing to govern the numinous and the numinous to follow the true, then the consciousness-spirit has no means to arise, the numinous *qi* does not scatter, and the root is firm. Though one enters water, one does not drown; though one enters fire, one is not burned. How could any external guest evil harm them? It is like a lamp with a cage that does not go out, or a brazier with a cover that remains unstained by flying dust.

Objects may be round or square—those that are round move with fluidity in their form, while those that are square rest in stillness in theirs. The round cannot remain still, just as the square cannot move. Each possesses its own inherent nature.

Observing this, I have grasped the Dao of employing roundness and squareness. Roundness accords with the compass: it adapts to circumstances, rising or falling, ascending or descending, advancing or halting, without clinging to a single method. Squareness accords with the carpenter’s square: it keeps right and wrong distinct, does not tread where propriety forbids, does not act where righteousness is absent, and does not dwell where the Way is not.

With an inner governing principle, one may be both round and square, following the compass and adhering to the square. Neither falling into rigid inflexibility nor drifting with the shifting tides, one remains outwardly lively and fluid, inwardly steady and sure. Borrowing worldly methods to cultivate the Dao’s methods, relying on human affairs to fulfill Heaven’s Way—like planting lotuses in raging fire or dragging a boat through muddy waters—one adapts to visibility or concealment as the time demands, acting or withdrawing as is fitting. Even the gods of Heaven and Earth cannot fathom such depth—how much less can ordinary people!

Those worldly people who can be round but not square, or square but not round, are like inanimate objects of fixed shape—suitable for one purpose yet unfit for another. Right and wrong become muddled, the upright and the crooked indistinguishable. How can they ever attain the great Dao? Thus, the cultivator of the Way must master both square and round, for this alone is the true skill of great achievement and great application.

A pot cracked or a jar leaking may yet be mended: a cracked pot, once soldered, remains a good pot for cooking food; a leaking jar, once bound with hoops, becomes a good jar for holding water and broth. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of turning failure into success.

At the beginning of life, the Three Treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—are whole, blended and congealed. But once knowledge dawns and the six sense gates open, each gate leaks; the seeds of the seven emotions and karmic deeds assail and wound; the Three Corpses stir mischief, the Five Thieves wreak havoc. Wine, sex, wealth, and temper delude the nature; greed, anger, delusion, and attachment deplete the true. Day by day, night by night, the Three Treasures are whittled away, dissolved. The whole body becomes diseased, inner and outer ruined, the originally blended Treasure reduced to a tattered, useless thing—like a cracked pot or leaking jar.

Yet if one suddenly awakens and turns back, reversing one’s course, looking down upon all things and emptying every condition, one may rebuild the household, reforge the hammer and tongs. At the very place of life and destiny, one practices with true and solid effort, sweeping away every later-acquired thing until nothing remains. Gathering in the radiant essence, firmly holding the mind, casting off the false and preserving the true, expelling the crooked and upholding the upright—one’s merit increases day by day, one’s Dao diminishes. Increasing further and further, diminishing further and further, until there is nothing left to increase or diminish, one naturally ceases to leak essence and preserves it whole, ceases to deplete qi and preserves it whole, ceases to tax the spirit and preserves it whole. What was lost is restored, what was ruined is made whole again—once more the originally blended, undiminished Treasure. Just as a cracked pot, once soldered, remains a good pot, or a leaking jar, once bound with hoops, becomes a good jar again.

Alas! People are all cracked and leaking, yet feel no pain. Taking the false for the true, they whittle and waste day and night, only deepening the leaks. When pillars rot and walls collapse, the house scatters in all directions, leaving no place to dwell. They have no choice but to seek another abode, blindly rushing and groping through the Six Paths of rebirth.

**The Mindless Infant**
An infant is not harmed by fierce tigers or seized by hungry hawks. Why is this so? Because it is without mind. Observing this, I have awakened to the wondrous application of the mindless Dao.

People fail to attain the Dao because they have a mind. Having a mind means having a self; having a self means having others. The slightest notion of self and others leads to scheming for personal gain, heedless of harm to others—devising a hundred stratagems, donning demonic guises, desires swarming, innate goodness obscured. Even virtue cannot be accumulated—how dare one vainly aspire to the Dao?

If one is truly a seeker of the Dao, one must swiftly topple the mountain of self and others, hasten to depart from the winding goat-path. In conducting oneself and engaging the world, one views all equally, without distinction of high or low. One entrusts things to things, adapts to affairs as they arise, responds without grasping, passes without lingering. In every circumstance, one meets it with mindlessness.

Mindlessness means selflessness; selflessness means inner purity. Inner purity means unsullied whiteness, a state of pure Heavenly principle—this is called primordial virtue. Primordial virtue is formless and traceless, unseen and unheard. It alone harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth, brightness with the sun and moon, order with the four seasons, auspice and ill-fortune with ghosts and spirits. Creation cannot constrain it, the myriad things cannot harm it.

That infant, without knowledge or awareness, is unharmed by tigers or hawks simply because it is without mind. How much less can any external calamity assail one who is mindless yet embodied and efficacious, complete in both virtue and Dao?

**Laying the Foundation to Build a House**
Whether a house lasts long or not depends entirely on the foundation laid at the beginning.

A foundation firmly laid ensures a house’s stability and longevity; a foundation poorly set leads to a house’s gradual tilting and decay—this is an immutable principle. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of cultivating truth and realizing the root.

In cultivating truth, nothing precedes refining the self and mastering the mind. Refining the self banishes selfish desires; mastering the mind steels resolve and focus. With selfish desires gone and resolve firm, the root stands steady, unshaken and immovable. Then one harmonizes the four images, gathers the five phases, seizes yin and yang, and wrest control from creation. Cultivating both nature and life, one advances single-mindedly, attaining profound mastery and reaping success wherever one turns—just as a firmly laid foundation bears the weight of timber, stone, bricks, and tiles without strain. If the root is unsteady and resolve scattered, wavering between this and that, beginning with diligence but ending in slackness, acting only to lose it again, striving forward only to fall behind, all effort is wasted—like a poorly set foundation, where even an upright house will tilt with time.

**The Alchemical Chamber and Vessels**
Refining the elixir requires an alchemical chamber; storing the medicine demands vessels. Without chamber or vessels, the furnace and crucible have no place to rest, and the ingredients no place to be contained. These—chamber and vessels—are indispensable to the alchemist.

Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of borrowing the provisional to cultivate truth. The human physical form is like the alchemical chamber; the five viscera within are like the vessels. Within the physical form lies the true body; within the five viscera reside the five phases. Cultivating truth does not mean refining the physical form or the five viscera, but refining the true body and tempering the five phases—merely borrowing the provisional physical form and viscera to forge the true body and five phases.

What is true? The five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The heart corresponds to fire, its virtue being propriety; the kidneys to water, their virtue being wisdom; the lungs to metal, their virtue being righteousness; the liver to wood, its virtue being benevolence; the spleen to earth, its virtue being trust. Wood, metal, fire, water, and earth are the natures of the five phases; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust are their virtues—this is the true endowment of the primordial.

As for the heart storing spirit, manifesting as joy; the kidneys storing essence, manifesting as sorrow; the lungs storing po, manifesting as anger; the liver storing hun, manifesting as delight; and the spleen storing intent, manifesting as desire—these are the provisional endowments of the postnatal. Since birth, the primordial has been entangled with the postnatal, the postnatal with the primordial, mingled and impure. Unless the provisional postnatal is refined away, the primordial cannot be restored. Borrow the postnatal to refine the primordial, and use the primordial to transform the postnatal. When the postnatal is fully transformed, the primordial becomes pure and complete, releasing a luminous pearl that pierces heaven and earth, moving freely in all directions, every step a manifestation of the Dao. Upon completion of merit and fulfillment of practice, one shatters the void, ascends in broad daylight, and discards the useless fleshly husk—just as the alchemist, upon completing the elixir, no longer needs the chamber or vessels.

Fools, unaware of the parables within the Dao, fixate on the tangible forms of chamber and vessels, making wild guesses and reckless attempts—what the ancients called, *"If the crucible lacks the true seed, you merely boil empty space with fire and water."* The immortals of old said: *"Do not cling to this body as the Dao; know that beyond the body lies the true body."* Those in the world who toil over the fleshly husk or waste their minds on furnaces, metals, and minerals—are they not fools?

**Silkworms and Tadpoles**
Silkworms spin cocoons; tadpoles form sacs. Over time, the cocoon breaks, and a moth emerges; the sac opens, and a frog leaps out. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of the sacred embryo’s transformation.

The cultivator gathers the five phases, unites the hundred spirits, coalescing into the Supreme Ultimate, a single qi congealed—vague and indistinct, neither knowing nor perceiving. The sacred embryo takes form, like the silkworm’s cocoon or the tadpole’s sac. Spirit hibernates, qi conceals, in a state of dim obscurity, profound mystery. The subtle root of numen grows from faint to manifest, from tender to firm. When great merit is achieved, the void suddenly shatters, revealing the pure Dharma-body, leaping beyond the three realms—just as the silkworm transforms into a moth, breaking free from the cocoon to ascend, or the tadpole becomes a frog, shedding its sac to leap. A body exists beyond the body, another world entirely.

Thus, after attaining the Dao, some speak of *"feathered transformation and ascension,"* others of *"shedding the husk to become true"*—both refer to the birth of a true body within the fleshly form. This true body, everyone possesses, each has glimpsed, yet people are deluded by worldly dust and ensnared by illusions, failing to recognize it even when face-to-face. Those who do recognize it, if they cultivate diligently, transform the formless into form, the insubstantial into substance, shedding their mortal coil to become immortals with indestructible vajra-bodies.

**The Steed and the Nag**
The swift steed gallops a thousand *li* in a day; the sluggish nag takes ten days to arrive. Though their speeds differ, their success is the same. Observing this, I have awakened to the Dao of swift and gradual progress in cultivation.

People vary in innate capacity and strength. Those of dull nature seek to emulate the sharp-witted; those of lesser strength strive to match the mighty. This is like the crow or sparrow attempting to follow the roc—not only can they not keep pace, but they risk damaging their wings. How could they succeed? Thus, the supreme sage said: *"Those who know from birth are the highest. Those who know through learning come next. Those who learn through struggle come after. Yet their knowledge, in the end, is one. Some practice it with ease..."*

Those who practice it with advantage come next; those who practice it through struggle follow after. Yet their success, in the end, is one."

Though these three types of people differ in difficulty and speed, all may grasp the Dao and attain the Way—what they lack is merely resolve. Without resolve, one cannot practice, nor even comprehend. But with resolve, one studies broadly, inquires carefully, reflects cautiously, discriminates clearly, and acts sincerely. If others master something once, one masters it a hundredfold; if others master something ten times, one masters it a thousandfold. Truly following this path, even the dull become enlightened, even the weak become strong—none fail to reach the realm of profound mastery and self-realization.

Yet why is it that so many in the world who pursue the Dao cannot wholeheartedly take their nature and life as their greatest concern? Their mouths speak of virtue, but their hearts harbor the ways of thieves. They wish to seek the Dao yet cling to desires; at the slightest obstacle, they flare with anger. A single word, a single phrase—they cannot endure. The clever rely on their own abilities, memorizing a few koans or listening to a few teachings, believing themselves enlightened while looking down on others. Unwilling to seek a true teacher or consult wise friends, they waste their own futures. The dull-witted, ignorant of principle and unable to distinguish right from wrong, dabble in peripheral practices, manipulating obscure methods and calling it the Dao. Refusing to seek confirmation from the wise, they cling stubbornly to their ways, unshakable to the end.

Such people fail to consider that the matter of nature and life is the greatest concern under heaven, and cultivating nature and life is the most difficult task under heaven. How could it be easily known or lightly accomplished? Thus, those who study the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain it are as rare as unicorn horns.

If one is truly a steadfast and unyielding person, seeing all things as empty and looking down upon worldly concerns, advancing with each step, tempered like unbreakable metal, unwavering in purpose—seeking out a wise teacher, delving deeply into true principles—then regardless of whether one’s nature is sharp or dull, one will eventually reach the day of liberation. One will not have wasted one’s years in vain.

**The Red Flower and the Green Leaf**
Though the red flower is beautiful, it must rely on the green leaf for support.

The flower without leaves lacks brilliance; with leaves, the flower’s beauty is enhanced. Observing this, I have realized the principle of mutual dependence between the Dao and virtue. The Dao pertains to the cultivation of the self; virtue pertains to benefiting others. Cultivating the Dao is an internal practice; cultivating virtue is external conduct. Since ancient times, those who embrace the Dao have never failed to cultivate virtue. The Dao is like the flower; virtue is like the leaf. The flower relies on the leaf for support; the Dao is perfected through virtue. Flower and leaf are inseparable—so too are the Dao and virtue.

The sages of antiquity first cultivated the Dao, then virtue. The worthies of old first cultivated virtue, then the Dao. The sage is one of superior wisdom; the worthy, one of middling capacity. The sage, with effortless mastery, strides directly toward the shore of the Dao. For them, cultivating the Dao is easy, so they first cultivate the Dao and then virtue, using virtue to complete the Dao. The worthy, however, must act with deliberation. For them, cultivating the Dao is difficult, so they first cultivate virtue and then the Dao, using virtue to uphold the Dao.

Those who study the Dao—those of superior wisdom—are as rare as one or two in ten thousand. The mediocre and inferior are beyond counting. The mediocre and inferior have shallow roots, limited insight, heavy karmic burdens, and deep entanglement in the dust of the senses. They must first accumulate virtue. When virtue is profound, it can subdue spirits, move heaven and earth, and resonate with all beings. With such virtue, the Dao becomes easier to study; with it, the Dao becomes easier to accomplish. For the Dao is the essence of virtue, and virtue is the function of the Dao. At the utmost depth of virtue lies *yuan de* (primordial virtue), so profound and unfathomable that it nearly merges with the Dao. Thus, studying and practicing the Dao becomes effortless.

Yet today’s students accumulate no virtue, establish no conduct, and upon hearing a word or half a phrase—without discerning right from wrong or true from false—rashly set to work, vainly hoping to become immortals. Even if they were to attain the truth, from ancient times to the present, there has never been an immortal without merit or conduct. Moreover, the Great Dao is not transmitted to those lacking great loyalty and filial piety, nor is it bestowed upon those without great worthiness and virtue. A true teacher’s insight spans ten thousand miles—how could they entrust the true treasure to an unworthy person?

There is also a class of muddled fools who do not know to tread firmly upon the earth and diligently practice merit and conduct. Even when they encounter a true teacher, they do not seek instruction with reverence, but instead speak deceptive words, hoping to trick others into revealing heavenly secrets, or seize opportunities to steal them. Such gains cannot last long. After a day or two, they demand transmission, and when refused, they depart in haste, spewing complaints and slander. With such intentions, they rush east and west, wasting their straw sandals in vain, passing their lives in futility, achieving nothing in the end.

Little do they realize that the Dao does not depart from virtue, nor virtue from the Dao. How can one abandon virtue and speak only of the Dao? How can one set aside virtue and cultivate the Dao alone? Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must first accumulate virtue.

*The Lament for the Dao: Seventy-Two Stanzas*
I.

Alas! The Dao remains obscure,
Who truly sees the nature and life so pure?
In arenas of strife, they vie for rank,
On winding paths, they clamor for fame’s blank.
Entangled in love’s bonds, hard to break free,
Schemes and cunning minds—oh, how sharp they be!
Such pursuits all lead to death’s embrace,
Only the wise who repent show true grace.

II.
Alas! The Dao holds no esteem,
The foolish and common brim with doubt’s seam.
At talk of the Dao, they grow suspicious,
At sight of its practice, they turn malicious.
Neglecting life to nourish the mind,
They glut on meat and wine, their bellies lined.
Few tread the path to heaven’s gate,
While hell’s doors teem with those who tempt fate.

III.
Alas! The Dao is blocked,
Devious paths and byways, endless and crooked.
Some cling to emptiness, some to form’s guise,
Or shift west and east in their vain device.
Seventy-two schools with furnace and flame,
Three thousand six hundred arts of shame.
The blind lead the blind, the true path lost,
Barred from the cage, the seeker’s cost.

IV.
Alas! The Dao is hard to know,
Heretical paths the true Way o’erthrow.
Some point to the *xing* hidden in heaven’s vale,
Others say *ming* resides by *Guanyuan’s* trail.
Yin and yang misread as midnight and noon,
Dragon and tiger mistaken for lung and liver’s boon.
All manner of acts on the body they try,
Yet which brings them near the Dao’s shore nigh?

V.
Alas! The Dao’s gate stands wide,
All are welcome to step inside.
To turn back is to reach the other shore,
To humble the heart is the Dharma’s store.
Know the one, and life is prolonged,
Grasp the two, the sacred embryo’s formed strong.
Since ancient times, the wise embrace all,
Yet in this dusty world, few stand tall.

VI.
Alas! The Dao’s bond is frayed,
Few Daoists recognize the true self displayed.
Mistaking fish eyes for pearls bright,
Or grass seeds for immortal fruit’s light.
All forsake the common for the strange,
Seeking fortune yet reaping change.
Even meeting a wise teacher, they bow not low,
Locking their own gates long ago.

VII.
Alas! The Dao is grieved,
Why do seekers not ponder and heed?
Life’s great matter treated as child’s play,
The sages’ principles cast away.
Self-absorbed, pride swells their chest,
Seeking shortcuts, shunning the test.
Without humility, how can they find
The true yin and yang, the Way refined?

VIII.
Alas! The Dao decays,
Most seekers turn to strange ways.
Unclear of nature and life, they feign height,
Coveting offerings, drowning in debt’s plight.
Unmerited gains—how can they repay?
Creating karma, yet blind to the way.
Behold these fools, so lost in their haze,
Ruining the ancestral teachings’ blaze.

IX.
Alas! The Dao is natural,
Forced twists and turns—all futile, all shallow.

Some fix the mind and steady intent,
Some close the breath to lodge in the cinnabar field.
Some move downward then circulate upward,
Some push back then turn to the front,
Yet when years are spent and months exhausted,
All is futile—they vainly blame Heaven.

X.
Alas! The Dao endures long,
Without constancy, why wander aimless?
Scarcely entering the gate, they ask of the primal pass,
Before learning, they rush to begin.
Starting keen but ending slack, their will unsteady,
Outward compliance hides inner defiance—calamity follows.
They but scheme to deceive others, revealing celestial secrets,
While immortals in the unseen laugh to splitting their mouths.

XI.
Alas! The Dao is not strange,
Yet craving strangeness early leads the path astray.
Lead and mercury, cinnabar and silver—all are metaphors,
Hare and crow, tortoise and snake—mere analogies.
Common words and sayings align with the sagely Dao,
Daily deeds and nightly acts hold the immortal’s foundation.
The wondrous principle lies plain and complete,
Only fools fail to ponder it deeply.

XII.
Alas! The Dao is unseen,
Fools but refine the colored body.
Mouth and nose they take for the Mysterious Female’s gate,
Behind the navel they mistake for the Yellow Court.
The discriminating spirit they deem the true master,
Turbid qi they misjudge as kin.
Unknowing that the great elixir has no form,
In the vast emptiness lies the foremost good.

XIII.
Alas! The Dao awaits the person,
Without one, the heavenly treasure falls to the mortal dust.
Great matters demand emptying the myriad things,
Heavy burdens require strength of a thousand jun.
The Buddha’s dharma shone when the arm’s radiance was severed,
The Dharma-body appeared when ribs were broken—Longspring’s sign.
Since ancient times, sages and worthies emerged from suffering,
Without suffering, how can one attain perfection?

XIV.
Alas! The Dao has long been obscured,
Han and Tang immortals all withdrew in concealment.
Only because they mistook the false and missed the true,
Thus they veiled their brightness and nurtured obscurity.
Though their compassionate hearts had no place to extend,
Who could they share their celestial secrets with, holding them in vain?
If by chance a worthy one cherished life appeared,
They would meet and pour out their hearts in full.

XV.
Alas! The Dao must be transmitted.

Without a true and enlightened master, all efforts are in vain;
From patriarch to patriarch, the secret path is transmitted,
From lamp to lamp, the primordial is perpetuated.
Within the body’s upper and lower, no true substance exists,
The myriad phenomena are not the Dharma-vessel;
Yet grasp the single phrase before life’s end,
And in an instant, golden lotuses bloom amidst the flames.

XVI.
Alas! The Dao values awakening,
Without awakening, how can one take a single step?
First, one must inquire into the root of one’s nature,
Then seek the master’s instruction on the cause of life.
The prior and posterior heavens differ greatly;
The inner and outer five phases each follow their own path.
Once the celestial secret is thoroughly penetrated,
Transcending the mundane to enter sageliness rests with the individual.

XVII.
Alas! The Dao resides in softness,
In softness lies the foremost strategy.
How can one of lofty heart tread the true path?
How can one of restless nature rise above others?
The later self is but the omen of the former,
Retreat is the very source of advance;
Striving for dominance and seeking victory while hoping to attain the Dao,
Is like a blind man leaping into a deep ditch.

XVIII.
Alas! The Dao is resolute,
A single blade severs steel in two;
Affection and attachment bind hands and feet,
Greed and wrath unremoved leave will and thought debased.
To cultivate the immortal’s path, first shed the mundane,
To ascend the sacred realm, first dissolve transgressions.
How laughable are those on Thorn Ridge,
How can vines bear golden fruit?

XIX.
Alas! The Dao has no affinity,
How many wayfarers swing idly on the autumn rope;
Two phrases feign profound concealment,
Slight effort claims lofty worthiness.
Drifting in clouds and mist without grounding,
Shifting from dawn to dusk in empty suspension;
They deceive others and deceive themselves,
Who would repent and seek the true transmission?

XX.
Alas! The Dao is not trifling,
Yet fools merely circle outside its gate.
Unaware of pursuing the root of creation,
They vainly hope to obtain the secret and end life’s fate.
Only by delving deep into the cave of principle is truth seen,
Only by unlocking the Mysterious Female is understanding attained.
A single thing spans heaven and earth,
Recognize it, and one transcends beyond all things.

XXI.
Alas! The Dao is near at hand,
Knowing creation’s workings, one cannot alter them.
The young are to be revered—they must strive diligently,
The old and feeble are beyond remedy.
Hearing the Dao, one may rise above the mundane,
Practicing the Dao, one ascends the foundation of sageliness.
Yet all under heaven grow lazy in study,
Wasting years in delusion, a lifetime lost.

XXII.
Alas! The Dao values devotion,
Turning back, one need not fear old age.
Immortals left behind methods of cultivation,
The resolute must forge with true heart.
Returning to the root reveals the elixir of life,
Reflecting the light is the ointment of restoration.
If this body is not cultivated in this life,
How will one know which path to return to in the next?

XXIII.
Alas! The Dao values harmony,
Yet what is the intent of seclusion and stillness?
Following the natural course completes the great Dao,
Plum Blossom served as an official to nurture his spirit.
Within the dust yet beyond it lies the path of transcendence,
Amid the world yet apart from it enters the immortal’s nest.
From ancient times to now, how many have attained realization?
All emerged from the marketplace’s arduous refinement.

XXIV.
Alas! The Dao is not seen,
How many perceive the one that unifies all?

This one expounds on elixir recipes,
That one debates cases of ascension.
Each follows branches and leaves as they please,
Clinging to sects and working in confusion;
All abandon truth to chase falsehood,
Who in the end can reach the other shore?

XXV.
Alas! The Dao values sincerity,
Why do learners not arouse true feeling?
A prisoner redeems his crime with his family’s fortune,
A merchant pursues wealth at the risk of his life.
A true teacher is like a father who gives rebirth,
The wondrous formula is like the City of Supreme Bliss;
If one remains deceitful and disdainful,
Who will reveal the celestial mechanism to you?

XXVI.
Alas! The Dao is treasure,
Understood, it can prolong life and longevity.
Do not speak of cinnabar and black lead,
What need is there for pears and jujubes?
Utmost simplicity, utmost ease, no difficulty,
Utmost spirit, utmost divinity—truly excellent.
How laughable are foolish people seeking the primordial mystery,
Yet failing to preserve the primordial mystery already present.

XXVII.
Alas! The Dao is fundamentally without,
Formless and imageless, hard to depict.
Inaudible when listened for, invisible when looked upon,
To conceive it is already lost, to discuss it is slander.
Vast, it can encompass the six directions,
Minute, it resembles a millet seed;
In the world, how many cultivators are there?
All seek the path amid appearances.

XXVIII.

XXIX.
Alas! The Dao is profound and mysterious,
Which resolute scholar can it be revealed to?
Each one’s heart lacks sincerity,
Every person’s nature brims with arrogance.
Old habits unchanged, worldly dust unremoved,
Outwardly feigning maturity, inwardly thieves and robbers;
With such conduct and concealment, hoping to cultivate immortality—
A life spent in vain, reaping karmic retribution.

XXX.
Alas! The Dao is most revered,
Difficult to employ for private favor or enlighten the foolish.
A compassionate father cannot transmit it to his son,
How dare a loving grandfather bestow it upon his grandson!
Ten thousand taels of gold cannot purchase it,
Only wholehearted devotion may receive its grace.
If one has not transcended the common to ascend as a celestial being,
Who would lightly discuss its secret formulas?

XXXI.
Alas! The Dao is upright,
Cultivation of the Dao must rely on virtue and conduct.
Only with virtue and conduct can one attain authenticity,
Without virtue and conduct, how can one become a sage?
Great virtue moves even ghosts and spirits to aid in secret,
Deep conduct repels demons and evil forces;
How laughable are those who cling to emptiness and non-action,
Foolishly hoping to comprehend the nature of life through mere vacuity.

XXXII.
Alas! The Dao is near,
Yet people seek its wondrous resonance from afar.
Before their eyes, golden blossoms ever bloom,
Within their bodies, the true seed already exists.
Recognize it in an instant to reverse yin and yang,
Illumine it in the present to invert life and death.
This matter cannot be guessed at will—
One must swiftly seek the guidance of an enlightened master.

XXXIII.
Alas! The Dao’s path is long,
Its beginning and end, its sequence, must be pursued.
When gathering the medicine, discern the true from the false,
When refining the medicine, know the firm and the yielding.
When circulating the fire, distinguish swift from gradual,
When forming the embryo, carefully add and withdraw.
A single misstep leads a thousand miles astray,
How can scattered words and phrases bring success?

XXXIV.
Alas! The Dao must be studied,
Without study, how can one return to great awakening?
First recognize the crescent moon in the southwest,
Then fathom the inverted bowl in the northeast.
The gate that gives me life is the root of destiny,
The door that brings my death is the shedding of skin.
On the path of life and death, how many tread?
How few can grasp the workings of creation?

XXXV.
Alas! The Dao is supremely centered,
Who can traverse it without bias or deviation?
Black and white in harmony become the mother of the elixir,
Form and emptiness as one is true attainment.
Yin and yang in union conceal the breath of life,
Balanced and harmonious, they stir the gentle wind.
If one awakens to the meaning of the center,
One moves freely through all directions, master of reversal and sequence.

XXXVI.
Alas! The Dao is without deceit,
The slightest pretense leads to great error.
Wine, lust, wealth, and temper must all be abandoned,
Anger, hatred, greed, and delusion must all be transformed.
With true heart and sincere intent, exert every effort,
Feigning deafness and dumbness, endure others’ scorn.
Without knowledge or perception, the myriad conditions dissolve,
To ascend the heights, one must first descend.

XXXVII.
Alas! The Dao is utterly impartial,
How can it favor high or low, rich or poor?
Every person possesses the nature to return to the origin,
Each being contains the spirit to revert to youth.
Officials must forget power and profit,
Scholars and commoners must apply themselves to hard work.
True affairs require true people to accomplish them—
If one is not true, all endeavors are empty.

XXXVIII.

Alas! The Dao is profound and generous,
To preserve the true, one must examine carefully.
The path of immortals and mortals diverges by a hair’s breadth,
The gateway of life and death is like a button’s clasp.
A moment’s carelessness loses one’s celestial nature,
The slightest speck of dust enters the demon’s den.
If the stakes here are not understood,
A thousand schemes and ten thousand plans only invite remorse.

XXXIX.
Alas! The Dao is utterly level,
Yet learners insist on treading perilous paths.
They turn their backs on the true and constant Dao,
Seeking extinction, which is not the great dharma’s course.
Forcibly restraining qi and blood breeds sores and toxins,
Rigidly fixing the spirit plunges one into a fiery pit.
Before them lies a single path to heaven,
But without an enlightened teacher, they cannot discern it.

XL.
Alas! The Dao is priceless,
A single grain of millet-pearl enfolds creation.
Concealed, it vanishes without trace;
Unleashed, its radiance illumines day and night.
To become a sage or saint lies entirely within it,
To become a buddha or immortal requires no external aid.
How many Daoists search in vain,
Discarding the ready-made treasure before them.

XLI.
Alas! The Dao and its methods are all-encompassing,
With Dao and method, the root of life is planted.
Desireless observation of the wondrous is the foundation of the elixir,
Desirous observation of the aperture gathers the medicinal herbs.
The furnace and cauldron are secure, free from calamity,
The firing times unerring, the sacred embryo congeals.
These wondrous operations require a teacher’s instruction—
Wild guesses and private interpretations will not suffice.

XLII.
Alas! The Dao is arduous to practice,
The first step is to exhaustively investigate principle.
Where is the fruit of the nature-family concealed?
Where does the root of life ultimately alight?
The Five Phases do not reside in the viscera,
The Three Primes are all borne by empty space.
Fools fail to study principle,
Blundering forward in a haze.

XLIII.
Alas! The Dao’s flavor is fragrant,
Yet how many Daoists are willing to savor it carefully?
The Four Symbols harmonize to prolong life,
The Five Phases gather to enter the immortal realm.
The crescent moon’s numinous light is the root of the returned elixir,
The great emptiness’s true qi is the king of medicines.
This is the one subtle and wondrous dharma-vehicle—
The other two are not true; do not measure them lightly.

XLIV.
Alas! The Dao has no beginning,
A single qi circulates through the true pivot.
Let the foolish and ignorant indulge their desires,
Only the enlightened need guard it without intent.
Recognize and gather it into the jade furnace,
Refine it into a single primordial dipper.
If this celestial mechanism is not understood,
Do not boast before others with grand words.

XLV.
Alas! The Dao’s ladder is high,
Only those who ascend it are heroes.
Moment by moment, gather the life-prolonging medicine,
Hour by hour, whet the demon-slaying blade.
Postnatal dissipates, prenatal appears,
The mortal womb is shed, the sacred embryo secured.
It is only that learners fear hardship—
When the great limit arrives, they wail in vain.

XLVI.
Alas! The Dao is unfathomable,
A single Supreme Ultimate, whole and undivided.
Without back or front, without before or after,
Now hidden, now manifest, now emptiness, now form.
Invisible to the eye, inexpressible in words,
To conceive of it is to lose it; the spirit attains it naturally.
Fools seek only in images,
How can they draw near the realm of sages and worthies?

XLVII.
Alas! The Dao is wondrously primordial,
The great dharma-ship that transcends the mundane and enters the sacred.
Hearing of immortality, all yearn for it,
Learning of its toils, they dread the trials.
They wish to hoard wealth by the myriad strings,
Yet also dream of soaring on clouds to the ninth heaven.
Such types fill the world,
Yet where is one who stands above the crowd?

XLVIII.
Alas! The Dao is simple and convenient,
No need to seek it afar—it lies within one’s home.
Turn the body, and the soul-returning elixir is obtained,
Turn the head, and the true Dao’s shore is reached.
Only because learners lack sincerity,
The numinous treasure does not appear.
Alas! Those who cling to the insubstantial and unreal,
Wasting their lives in heterodox paths.

XLIX.
Alas! The Dao is impartial,
Cultivating both nature and life completes the great return.
First, with effort, the life-treasure is formed,
Finally, without effort, the nature-heaven is realized.
The four yin and yang distinguish true from false,
The two stages of practice have sequence.
Observe the aperture, observe the wondrous—only then is perfection achieved,
To have a beginning without an end is futile.

L.
Alas! The Dao has five,
Qi divides into water, fire, wood, metal, and earth.
One transforms into five, preserving the original flavor,
Five return to one, revealing the ancestral founder.
Generally, one must distinguish prenatal and postnatal,
And carefully recognize the gate of life and death.
The wondrous formula lies between sequence and reversal—
Without understanding sequence and reversal, one toils in vain.

LI.
Alas! The Dao is serene,
Serenity requires sweeping away the myriad concerns.
Moment by moment, guard against the unruly horse,
Step by step, beware the maddened ape.
Myriad conditions do not arise, returning to true awakening,
A single thought purely true completes the great return.
How laughable are the many quiet-sitters,
Their bodies and minds unsettled, vainly entering the mountains.

LII.
Alas! The Dao is at ease,
Ease requires cherishing one’s own self.
When the self is present, things cannot entangle,
When the self is absent, the nature is obscured.
If one’s self is truly always at home,
Even King Yama will retreat in awe.
If this mechanism is not understood,
All endeavors become obstacles.

LV.
Alas! The Dao is not difficult,
Difficulty arises because learners do not delve deeply.
Profound cultivation ultimately opens the nature of wisdom,
Single-minded devotion will surely shatter the web of doubt.
If one recognizes prenatal qi,
In an instant, the returned elixir can be congealed.
Knowing the end and the beginning, all is thoroughly penetrated,
Like a pole raised, the shadow appears—no barrier can obstruct.

LVI.
Alas! The Dao must be verified,
Verification through practice leaves no stumbling.
Though the nature is self-realized, it is not sufficient,
The life-root requires a teacher’s transmission to be embodied.
Innate knowledge must rely on learned knowledge to be perfected,
True material seeks the great craftsman’s confirmation.
How pitiful are those who fancy themselves clever,
Wildly guessing and presuming, straying onto crooked paths.

LV.
Alas! The Dao communicates with the divine,
One resolution settles a hundred affairs, transcending the mundane.
Recognizing the formless thing of that year,
Refining it forges an indestructible vajra-body.
Utterly sacred, utterly divine, the three poisons are extinguished,
Without calamity or disaster, spring reigns in all four seasons.
This dharma is not difficult, truly simple and easy,
Yet alas, the world lacks true people.

LVI.
Alas! The Dao has no form,
The form of the formless is its true appearance.
Still and unmoving, yet responsive when stirred,
Struck, it answers—bright within stillness.
Gathered and sent into the furnace of Great Emptiness,
Refined into a single Primordial Staff;
The true oral instruction must be transmitted beyond teaching,
Without merit or scant practice, it cannot be hoped for.

LVII.
Alas! The Dao is not complete,
Heaven and man together kindle the lotus of fire-seed.
Following the course of creation, it gives birth to beings,
Reversing the workings of yin and yang, it makes Buddhas and immortals.
Opening *Kun*, closing *Gen*, it departs the demon’s den,
Cultivating the assisting ministers to complete the great return.
This dharma is not easily obtained in the ordinary,
Once in ten thousand kalpas, it may be transmitted but once.

LVIII.
Alas! The Dao is most profound,
A hair’s breadth of error brings many encumbrances.
The weight of medicinal substances must be precise,
The firing times from beginning to end must be fully prepared.
Knowing fortune and misfortune, one preserves the true,
With increase and decrease, affairs come to fruition.
Understanding one part, practice one part,
To act recklessly is to waste effort in vain.

LIX.
Alas! The Dao has no root,
Yet though rootless, it has a gate.
The Eight Trigrams and Three Primes emerge from this,
The Five Phases and Four Families all reside within.
Awakened, one becomes immortal or Buddha,
Deluded, one loses soul and harms spirit.
*Dan Yang* points to being within non-being,
Yet scholars remain foolish and dull.

LX.
Alas! The Dao is truly strange,
Knowing it, wherever one goes, none is unprofitable.

The primordial gate reverses yin and yang,
At the root of spirit and qi, heaven and earth turn.
Beneath the Red Dragon’s neck, pluck the luminous pearl,
Within the Black Tiger’s den, seek the ritual implement;
This matter must be deliberated with immortals,
How could the mediocre and foolish dare reckless conjecture?

LXI.
Alas! The Dao is most true,
First, one must carefully recognize the original person.
Within temperament and nature, seek the fundamental nature,
Within the physical body, find the true body.
Right and wrong are separated by but a hair’s breadth,
Only in sequence do closeness and distance differ.
The deluded play only with the outer form,
Mistaking the Dipper’s handle for the North Star.

LXII.
Alas! The Dao is most subtle,
Every action and movement bears consequence.
Guard the heart and refine the self, ever vigilant against peril,
Morning firmness and evening caution, ever as if on alert.
The slightest laxity harms the true nature,
The least indulgence closes the gate of life.
Cultivating the Dao is like treading on layered ice,
A misstep brings ruin to the whole body.

LXIII.
Alas! The Dao is fundamentally empty,
Yet within emptiness resides the true master.
Its movement governs creation as the primal ancestor,
Its power sustains life as the great spiritual force.
Entering sagehood and transcending the mundane both rely on its strength,
Shifting stars and turning the Dipper require no effort.
One must personally witness the true form,
Without seeing it, how can one return to youth?

LXIV.
Alas! The Dao is without form,
Formless, it merges into the Great Ultimate.
The Three Corpses and Six Bandits cannot invade,
The Five Aggregates and Seven Emotions all extinguish.
Nurturing for ten months perfects the dharmakāya,
Nursing for three years enters the realm of sages.
This secret cannot be known casually,
Without encountering an enlightened master, none can fathom it.

LXV.
Alas! The Dao resides within the body,
Within the body, another person is concealed.
In waking and sleeping, actions and conduct, it is ever a companion,
In seeing and hearing, speaking and moving, it is most intimate.
It is not the awareness of later-born knowledge,
But the original true qi and spirit.
If one seeks it in forms and shapes,
Mistaking servant for master, one sinks into eternal perdition.

LXVI.
Alas! The Dao is most wondrous.

The common folk hear this and burst into laughter;
Reversing yin and yang to advance the mechanism of evolution,
Piercing through primordial chaos to find the Mother’s Cavern.
Drawing forth the emotionless staff, a single rod,
To scatter the hordes of demons and all the luminaries.
Whether moving forward or backward, all follows the heart’s will,
On the thousand peaks’ summits, one ever sings and whistles.

LXVII.
Alas! The Dao values diligence,
Neglecting sleep and food to seek the Patriarch;
With every thought, one must return to sincerity with reverence,
At every moment, introspection must be earnest.
Deep cultivation naturally ascends the Dao’s shore,
Utmost sincerity surely savors its fragrant essence;
If one remains idle and lacks resolve,
How can one excel and transcend the common?

LXVIII.
Alas! The Dao is not twofold,
Why then do the deluded divide it into high and low?
The Great Ultimate is originally the name of Perfect Enlightenment,
Utmost sincerity is the very image of the Golden Elixir.
Only when one recognizes that the principles of sages and worthies are the same,
Does one know that the affairs of immortals and buddhas share one register;
If one fails to understand this and seeks elsewhere,
One enters side paths and indulges in vain imaginings.

LXIX.
Alas! The Dao has many facets,
I have traversed both the crooked and the straight;
First encountering the valley shrine, the path of clarity opened,
Then meeting the immortal, the Great Return was revealed.
Only after twenty-odd years did I recognize myself,
Only after a hundred thousand trials did I board the vessel;
Had I not exerted strenuous effort with unwavering focus,
How would I dare, in confusion, to cross the great river?

LXX.
Alas! The Dao has a beginning,
Yet ultimately returns to the sages’ and worthies’ intent;
Only by refining one’s nature through fate does one reach excellence,
Only by returning from being to non-being does one find rest.
To abandon the Way halfway wastes effort,
To give up mid-journey is no proper method;
Most learners lack earnestness,
Yet with earnestness, what difficulty lies in transcending life and death?

LXXI.
Alas! The Dao has its prohibitions,
The ladder of life and nature is worth ten thousand gold;
To recklessly transmit to the unworthy invites calamity,
To lightly reveal celestial secrets brings misfortune.
Though learners seek the Dao with urgency,
The true master’s guidance carries profound meaning;
If one is not a vessel fit for the teaching, it is hard to receive,
Yet when a kindred spirit is met, the heart’s truth is freely spoken.

LXXII.
Alas! The Dao should not be spoken of,
For speaking too much may invite scorn for one’s foolishness;
*The Original Aim* and *Contemplative Awakening* fully illumine the heart-mind,
*Elucidating the True* and *Converging Meanings* are all written in blood.
Supporting the true teaching and sweeping away side paths,
Yet concealing the elixir’s essence and the oral secrets,
If no kindred spirit was met at the time,
They are left for later worthies to discern with care.
