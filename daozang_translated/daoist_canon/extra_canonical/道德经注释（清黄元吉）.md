---

The Way of the Three Teachings is but the Way of the Sage.
The Confucian says *sincerity*, the Daoist says *golden elixir*, the Buddhist says *true emptiness*—yet all speak of the same boundless *qi*, permeating heaven, earth, and all beings.

Only the Sage delves to its source, attaining its utmost, harmonizing with the boundless void of heaven and earth without distinction—thus becoming the Sage.
Capable of both firmness and yielding, adaptable to round or square, without form to imitate, without sound or stench to constrain—its divine transformations are boundless, beyond comprehension.

If all is natural and effortless, originally so, neither augmented by the Sage nor diminished by the common—even descending to birds, beasts, grasses, and trees, all share this same *qi*, this same principle.

Observe the vast ocean—water most difficult to fathom. Yet a single sea contains all its waters, and a single dipper holds but water. The *qi* of the boundless void is likewise uniform.

Though heaven, earth, sages, and beings differ in myriad ways, at their formation, they all receive this same *qi*. Beyond this, there is no vital breath, no generative principle—only varying dispositions.

Mencius said, *"The Sage and the commoner share the same nature,"* and *"The difference between humans and beasts is slight."* Truly, a precise observation.

Alas, the world’s customs decline daily, and the people grow ever more lax. Though the Dao is inherently plain and ordinary, many regard it as deceptive, strange, and bizarre. Thus, Confucianism becomes ever less Confucian, Buddhism ever less Buddhist, and Daoism ever less Daoist.

If we do not expose the root causes or pierce through the subtle mysteries, the Dao will grow ever more obscured and unmanifest, while human hearts will decay and become ever harder to govern—until, inevitably, we descend to the level of birds and beasts, and sages are no better than the ignorant masses. The Dao will then hang in peril like a fragile egg suspended between heaven and earth, with none to bear the responsibility of preserving civilization.

Fortune favors this age of peace, and the land enjoys tranquility. At this opportune moment, I encountered a Daoist friend among the sacred mountains, discussing profound truths and subtle mysteries. I listened in secret, and their words were no mere empty talk for idle ears—I gained true insight from their teachings.

The assembled revered me as a master, so day and night I lectured on the *Dao De Jing*, using it as proof for cultivating virtue and establishing moral power. Unwittingly, I wrote endlessly, page upon page. Though my flaws are glaring and unworthy of scrutiny by the wise, there are moments where my words align with the subtle intent of the *Tao Te Ching*, offering some small benefit to the world.

My friends urged me to publish this work for the benefit of future generations. Though I feel deep shame and dare not deceive myself or others, their earnestness compelled me to consent. Now, as this printing begins, I preface these annotations with a few words to explain their origin.

Winter of the tenth month, Guangxu decade
Recorded by **Gǔ Dàn**, **Yuán Jí**, and **Huáng Zhāng** in self-preface.

**Chapter One: The Gateway to All Mysteries**

The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way;
The Name that can be named is not the constant Name.
Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
Named, it is the mother of all things.
Thus, without desire, one observes its subtlety,
With desire, one perceives its openings.
These two, though born from the same source and bearing different names,
Are both rooted in the Mysterious.
The Mysterious again and again—
This is the gateway to all mysteries.

Master Zhu [Zi] said: *"The Dao/Way is like a path, which all people share."*
In truth, it is the principle that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things,
Hence it is called the Dao/Way.
Before Heaven and Earth were divided,
This Dao/Way hung suspended in the boundless void;
After Heaven and Earth were opened,
This Dao/Way was entrusted to the heavens and the earth.
What Dao/Way is this?
Before Heaven and Earth, it endured eternally;
After Heaven and Earth, it does not decay.
Born before Heaven and Earth,
Mingled within the formless,
Neither visible nor audible.
Thus, the Sage of Highest Virtue said:
*"To speak of the Dao/Way is to exhaust and obscure it—
In truth, there is nothing to speak of;
What can be spoken of are but the Dao/Way’s manifestations,
Not the constant Dao/Way itself.*
*To name the Name is to empty and void it—
In truth, there is nothing to name;
What can be named are but the Dao/Way’s dross,
Not the constant Name itself.*

If people do not know the Dao/Way,
How can they read the *Book of Poetry* and say:
*"The Heavenly carriage moves without sound or scent"*—
The Dao/Way cannot be confined by words!
And again:
*"The mandate of Heaven, serene and unceasing"*—
The Dao/Way cannot be without designation.

One must know that within the utmost void,
The utmost reality resides;
Within the utmost emptiness,
The utmost substance dwells.
The Dao/Way’s truth cannot be measured by what is spoken of.

The Sage of Highest Virtue, in compassion and mercy,
Broadly expounded the teachings for the world:
*"Before the primordial chaos had yet taken form,
It was but a boundless, undifferentiated unity—
Though called Nameless, all things under Heaven and Earth, humans and nature,
Are nurtured within it.
This is why it is called the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

When stillness endured long,
The movement of *qi* arose,
Then came the Named,
A vast and harmonious *qi* of the Great Unity,
Flowing through the cosmos,
Nourishing all life.
This is why it is called the mother of all things.

The beginning is the undivided *qi* before Heaven and Earth opened;
The mother is the transformation giving birth to all things after their division.
For the student at the outset,
There is no other method—
Only to sit upright with a single mind,
Discard all thoughts,
And observe with a veiled gaze.

Below the heart, above the kidneys,
There seems a void, a hollow space.
Spirit meets spirit, breath returns to its source,
Following its ebb and flow,
But the focus must be on the convergence of spirit and *qi* in the central palace.
In no time, spirit and *qi* merge into one.

Then, one listens to its boundless chaos,
Without stirring a single conscious thought.
After long stillness, a faint, indistinct awareness arises,
Entering the realm of the Unknowable.
At this moment,
One does not know whether spirit enters *qi* or *qi* returns to spirit—
All is indistinct, neither self nor other, neither here nor there,
Yet not dull or lifeless—
If it were dull and lifeless, it would be but a withered tree, dead ashes.
The cultivator, reaching this stage,
Should extinguish the stirring mind,
Yet preserve the observing mind.
Only then does one attain wisdom as if foolish,
And insight without application.

In the midst of ignorance and unconsciousness,
A sudden awakening stirs—
This is the foundation of the *Tai Ji*.
One must know that this awakening,
Arising naturally and not through external influence,
Is the true awareness of my original nature.

The Daoists call this the Mysterious Gateway,
Found within the space of a single breath.
When inhaling, it is yin, stillness, void;
When exhaling, it is yang, movement, presence.
Even this fleeting breath contains mystery.

If one seeks to cultivate true awakening,
At the moment of this awakening—
A genuine, unshakable, thoughtless, and pure original person emerges.
Thus it is said:
Heaven and Earth awaken, giving birth to myriad things;
Humans awaken, refining the Golden Elixir.

But this awakening is like a flash of lightning or a spark of stone fire—
Before one’s eyes, it is present;
In an instant, it vanishes—
The difference is but a hair’s breadth.

The scholar must discern it clearly in ordinary times,
Only then can they grasp it when the moment arrives.
Even the ancient Great Awakened Ones,
Did not attain otherwise than through this awakening’s accumulation.

If the cultivator begins their work
Without first mastering the stages of no-desire and desire,
Of observing subtlety and perceiving openings,
From where can they establish their foundation?

Though no-desire and desire,
Subtlety and openings,
Are but yin-stillness and yang-movement—
One *qi* divided into two,
Two *qi*s still returning to one.

When stillness endures and movement arises,
The void generates presence—
This is called *One Yang Emerges, the Child is Born*.
When movement reaches its peak and stillness returns,
Presence returns to void—
This is called *Restoring the Command, Returning to the Root*.
Both are but the yin and yang of the *Tai Ji*.

Though they bear different names,
They spring from the same source—
The Sage of Highest Virtue calls this *One Mysterious*.
The Mysterious means profound and distant.

The scholar who seeks the Mysterious Dao/Way,
Must still the mind again and again,
Achieve steadiness once more—
Within, all is boundless and free,
This is observing subtlety without desire.

This is the first Mysterious.
When the *qi* stirs,
Though one knows,
They do not produce the perception of knowing;
Though one moves,
They do not cling to the thought of movement.
With one mind,
Without dual thoughts—
This is perceiving openings with desire.
This is the second Mysterious.

As for the Mysterious again and again,
It is truly the realm of returning to the root—
What else could it be but the gateway to all mysteries?

What is regrettable is that ordinary people,
Though possessing this mystery,
Do not nurture it directly—
Thus it opens and closes in cycles,
Until it is exhausted without end.

The True Person, when the Mysterious Gateway opens,
Fixes it with a single glance,
Seizes it with a single hand,
Cultivates and nurtures it—
Never allowing it to stray for an instant,
Thus directly attaining the supreme primordial source,
And achieving the Great Awakening as a Golden Immortal.

The initial practice lies within the single Mysterious Gateway.
The Supreme Chapter first distinguishes the Nameless as Named,
And perceiving subtlety without desire, with desire.
This clearly shows the essence of cultivation—
Beyond this single Mysterious Gateway,
There is nothing else to progress toward.

Thus the opening four lines speak of the Great Dao’s root,
Which is truly formless and boundless,
Unthinkable and inexhaustible.
Only at the dawn of Heaven and Earth,
When all was indistinct and chaotic,
Without any trace or clue,
Is it akin to when a person steadies themselves in stillness.

At the moment of Heaven and Earth’s sudden manifestation,
When stillness reaches its extreme and motion begins,
Awareness dawns and clarity awakens—
This is when a person detects *qi* in movement,
The very foundation for refining the elixir.

Within this mere blink of an eye,
Without the wisdom-pearl or insight-sword,
One cannot grasp it.
Essentially, the moment thoughts arise,
The Mysterious *yin* (womb) emerges—
The very beginning of Heaven’s opening and Earth’s splitting.

Since ancient times, all divine immortals
Have been born from this moment of awakening motion.
It is also said:
Perceiving subtlety without desire,
Perceiving openings with desire—
These two, one still and one moving,
Mutually forming their roots,
Thus differing in name though arising from the same source.

All things with form and appearance
Can be pondered, measured, and divined.
But this subtle opening—
It is without yet present,
Present yet without—
Cannot be named or described by any fixed standard.

Even if the tongue flows like a suspended river,
It cannot utter a single word of it—
Thus it is called the *Dao/Way* of *Dao/Way*.

Learners also do not regard it as distant and obscure,
Nor do they exhaustively seek its concrete reality.
If one truly finds this definite place,
Where others see it as vague and elusive,
In me, it is solidly grasped.
With prolonged practice, vitality springs forth—
Every moment is the Dao itself.

**Chapter Two: Achieving Merit Yet Not Claiming It**
All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—
Then ugliness already exists;
All know goodness as goodness—
Then wickedness already arises.

Thus the presence and absence of forms generate,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Length and shortness define one another,
Height and low incline toward one another,
Sounds harmonize with one another,
Front and back follow one another.

Therefore, the Sage acts in affairs of non-doing,
Practices teachings of no-speech,
All things arise yet they do not take credit,
Give birth yet do not possess,
Act yet do not rely—
Achieving merit yet not claiming it;
Only by not claiming it,
Does it not depart.

The ancients said:
*"I urge you to exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body,
Returning to the root and returning to the source is the Elixir King."*
And again:
*"Exhaustively seek where your vital body receives its mandate,
Do not blame Heaven’s *qi* for being fully revealed."*

From this perspective, it is clear that at the very beginning of receiving one’s mandate,
The natural principles of Heaven are complete,
Without any flaw.
Those who speak of beauty and ugliness,
Goodness and deformity,
Are all harming the Dao.

What is the Great Dao’s nature?
In Confucianism, it is called *"hidden and subtle"*,
Within which lies the essence of unseen and unheard.
In Buddhism, it is called *"that"* (which is),
Within which lies the truth of neither good nor evil.
In Daoism, it is called *"Mysterious Gateway"*,
Within which lies the profound mystery of no-thought and no-contemplation.

The Great Dao’s root originates from here.
Once imagined or theorized,
It falls into the trap of duality;
Once discussed or deliberated,
It stumbles into the snare of words.
Though immortals of old praised the Dao’s marvels,
Saying it is beautiful and good,
They were all but dimly grasping its form—
Not truly seeing its essence.

For when they say it is good,
Evil already opposes it;
When they say it is beautiful,
Deformity already opposes it.
Moreover, beauty exists here,
Yet ugliness also exists here;
Goodness exists here,
Yet deformity also exists here.
This is doubtless the post-Heaven duality of *yin* and *yang*,
With their interplay of victory and defeat—
Not the pre-Heaven unity of *qi*.

Thus the Supreme Chapter says:
*"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—
Then ugliness already exists;
All know goodness as goodness—
Then wickedness already arises."*

It is known that if one does not seek the emptiness of *qi* beyond extremes,
But merely speaks of beauty as beauty and goodness as goodness,
This is abandoning the root for the branches.

The Supreme Chapter specifically instructs beginners:
At the start of seated practice,
One must cast aside all entanglements,
Hold nothing in mind—
Only then, lowering the curtain and sealing the *fu* (mouth),
Observing the elixir field in emptiness,
Concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath,
Regulating the breath and concentrating the spirit—
Thus, with prolonged effort,
Spirit and *qi* merge into one cluster,
Instantly entering the distant and obscure realm—
This is non-doing.

When emptiness reaches its utmost,
Suddenly, a single awareness stirs—
This is doing.
From this single thought arising within the rule,
Continuous yet indistinct,
Unceasing yet surging—
Spirit relies on *qi* to stand,
*Qi* relies on spirit to move,
Without knowing yet knowing,
Without awareness yet aware—
The Gateway of the Mysterious *yin* (womb) is already established.

From this point, one must diligently uphold the rule,
Concentrating the spirit beyond form.
With each inhalation and exhalation,
Each advance and retreat,
One must ensure *qi* returns to the Mysterious opening.
Breathing naturally as Heaven dictates—
This is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,
The foundation of sages, immortals, and Buddhas—
The most profound secret of our Daoist school,
Not to be carelessly revealed.

For cultivators’ practice,
Rather than seeking the boundless and unattainable,
Why not seek the *yin* and *yang* with tangible proof?

The generation of presence and absence,
Is but movement and stillness,
Stillness and movement,
Emerging from the Mysterious and entering the *yin* (womb),
Harmonizing the principles of *yin* and *yang*.

Difficulty and ease completing each other,
Is but firmness and yielding,
Yielding and firmness,
The cauldron, furnace, lute, and sword—
One simmers, one warms.

Length and shortness defining one another,
Is the inhalation and exhalation,
The advance and retreat of the *Task* (governor) and *Du* (conceptor) vessels—
The forward movement is short,
The backward movement is long.

Height and low inclining toward one another,
Is fire above yet making it descend,
Water below yet making it ascend—
The wondrous reversal of above and below,
The transformation of *kan* and *li* (water and fire).

The harmony of sounds and voices,
Is the merging of spirit and the flow of *qi*,
With the hundred channels coursing freely—
Not unlike the cry of a phoenix summoning its flock,
Or the resonance of voices in unison,
Coming without being called.

The following and preceding in succession,
Is the *Du* vessel descending at the rear,
The *Task* vessel ascending at the front—
*Kan* and *Li* (water and fire) in union,
A harmonious whole, clinging yet never parting.

These are all the return of *yin* and *yang* from the post-heaven realm
To the pre-heaven realm of *wuji* (non-extreme).

The sage understands the origin of the Dao/Way,
Vague and boundless, vast and traceable—
In their conduct, they esteem *wuwei* (non-action),
And follow the manner of *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *chuangshang* (hanging sleeves),
Whereby they are revered without boast.

In their teaching, they uphold *buyan* (non-speech) as their principle,
And illustrate the wondrous method of *guohua cunshen* (transcending transformation to preserve the spirit).

The sage acts, yet all things behold them—
What difficulty could there be?

Even in the tilling of fields and the digging of wells,
They are born to life yet forget their own practice;
In regulating the source and conserving the flow,
They diligently guide transformation yet conceal their own traces.
Though their merit fills the heavens and earth,
And their fame echoes across the land,
The sage regards it as shame—
For hollow titles are never matched with true accomplishment.

How could this be compared to the *Book of Documents* saying:
*"You alone do not boast, do not claim—*
*None under heaven can contend with you in ability,*
*None can contend with you in merit."*
Yet even this still harbors the thought of *miren zhangjing* (dispelling strife and competition)?

This is truly the realm of *shenhua* (spiritual transformation),
The *danding* (tranquil and settled) heaven,
Where one simply finds contentment in their own nature,
And never forgets the true essence of self-realization.

The ancients spoke of viewing wealth and nobility as floating clouds,
And discarding fame as worn-out footwear—
Was this not their meaning?

Though so, when the Dao is complete,
Virtue/power establishes itself,
And true attainment naturally brings renown.

The sage, though not dwelling on merit,
Is praised by the world and posterity—
Their merit shines like the sun and moon,
Their fame weighs heavy in ancient and modern times.
It is only because they do not claim,
That it is never lost.

Students must cultivate from the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,
Nurturing forth the true essence of neither beauty nor virtue/power,
Only then can their cultivation be said to have genuine roots.

What is this Dao/Way?
The *xuan guan* (mysterious aperture)!

Abandon this, and there is no life.
For those who cultivate the Dao/Way,
Abandoning this mysterious aperture,
There is no other Dao/Way.

If one takes beauty and virtue/power as the Dao/Way,
It belongs to the dust of post-heaven concerns.
The *Taoist Canon* warns of this,
Hoping people will trace the flow back to its source.
Otherwise, the praise of beauty and virtue/power
Is also for the gentlemen of the Three Dynasties—
How could one blame them too harshly?

The *I Ching* says:
*"One *yin* and one *yang*, this is called the Dao/Way."*
Thus *yang* is not the Dao/Way,
And *yin* is also not the Dao/Way—
The Dao/Way lies between *yin* and *yang*!

Moreover, the Dao/Way is principle,
While *yin* and *yang* are *qi*.
Principle without *qi* cannot manifest,
And *qi* without principle cannot move.
To speak of the Dao/Way alone is formless and elusive—
Only when observing where *yin* and *yang* emerge,
Can one truly grasp its foundation.

This chapter speaks of the true essence of neither beauty nor virtue/power,
Directly piercing the root of the Great Dao/Way,
Urging people to establish their foundation and extreme,
As the basis for cultivating the self and governing the world.

The phrases on presence and absence, ease and difficulty,
Teach people to return from the duality of *yin* and *yang*
To the true unity of *qi*.

Within this, it also teaches people
To seek the mysterious aperture from the interplay of presence and absence,
As the fundamental root of alchemical refinement.

As for guarding the middle and nurturing the elixir,
Revitalizing *yang* within the *Du* vessel,
Operating the *heche* (river car),
All are progressively unraveled.

Only the sage points directly to its source,
Thus *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *wuwei* (non-action),
Silent yet trusted—
Though there be action and creation,
In themselves, there is no trace of virtue/power.

When their work is complete and they retire,
They regard wealth and nobility as of no consequence—
Who but the sage could attain this learning?

Students who ponder and gain insight,
Not only have a basis for their practice,
But also a path to transcendence.

Other commentaries say:
*"All under heaven know why beauty and virtue/power are beautiful and virtuous—*
*Then they themselves will not be evil or unvirtuous."*
This explanation is also correct.

But the *Taoist Canon* often speaks from the source,
Without falling into the realm of the Two Vehicles.

**Chapter Three** does not show what is desirable,
Does not exalt the worthy—
So the people do not contend;
Does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,
So the people do not become thieves;
Does not show what is desirable,
So the heart does not become disordered.

Thus the sage’s governance,
Empties the heart, fills the belly,
Weakens the will, strengthens the bones,
Ever keeping the people in ignorance and without desire,
So that even the wise dare not act.

To do *wuwei* (non-action),
Is to have nothing left ungoverned.
The sage’s governance of the world,
Rather than having action,
Is to prefer non-action—
Even more, to not knowingly act while non-acting.

In transforming the people and establishing customs,
Rather than being able to influence,
It is better to be able to transform—
Even more, to let them rest in harmony with the natural state of no affairs.

Thus Yao and Shun, with *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *chuangshang* (hanging sleeves),
Brought the four quarters to reverence and moved them by their example—
What profound method of transformation is this?

It is merely:
The ruler’s own emptiness brings the people stillness,
The ruler’s own lack of partiality brings the people rectitude,
The ruler’s own lack of desire brings the people stability.

Otherwise, in their bustling and meddling,
They believe they are bringing benefit and removing harm to the people,
Yet they do not realize that their disturbance of the people is indeed great.

Thus it is said:
The people originally have no contention,
Yet the ruler contends and seizes;
The people originally have no greed,
Yet the ruler is greedy and covetous;
The people originally have no thoughts or desires,
Yet the ruler leads them with strange arts, seductive cunning,
Gay attire, and delicious food.

Could one then make the people free from contention, greed,
And all cravings and partialities?

If the ruler can cultivate their own self,
Rectify their own heart,
And remain serene and detached,
With no involvement in any affairs,
And does not exalt the worthy and able,
Then the people naturally settle and are at peace, without contention;
If the ruler does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,
Then the people value modesty and shame,
And do not become thieves.

Moreover, the fields of sound, color, wealth, and profit are varied—
If the eyes are without sight and without desire,
And the ruler and the people each find contentment in their own natural state,
Then the spirit, which is *xu ling huo po* (empty, responsive, fluid, and lively),
Naturally remains ever responsive and ever still, without disorder.

「Is this matter one that only the extraordinary can achieve? Only the Sage can close off the ears and eyes, sever all crooked and private inclinations, and embrace *One* to empty their heart. When the heart is empty, the foundation for refining the elixir is established. Thus, they gather the *Daoist* **Lingyang** (精陽, the refined yang-qi of heaven and earth) to transform the **Yinjing** (陰精, primordial yin-essence), day by day, month by month. Naturally, the yin-essence diminishes and the yang-qi flourishes, filling the belly so that the form is preserved—this is what is called "concentrating the *Dao* to solidify the body, employing techniques to prolong life," the very method of transcending birth and escaping death. Furthermore, through focused *qi* to achieve softness, one is like an infant whose strength is weak and cannot grasp objects. Though supremely soft, when moved, it becomes firm. Observing its vast and profound nature, its towering and surging essence, it truly encompasses heaven and earth with abundance. All the senses of knowledge and the inclinations of craving—where do they retreat and dissolve? The Sage cultivates themselves with this.

To govern the world, they must first be without knowledge or desire—
Not only do the foolish wander in muddled confusion,
But even the clever and learned *Rujia* (儒, Confucian scholars),
Who daily boast of their abilities and rely on their wisdom,
Fearful lest they fail to assert themselves,
At this point, having become serene and detached, their private thoughts of knowledge and cleverness
All merge into simplicity and purity.
This is the power to act yet not act—
Not because they cannot, but because they dare not.
Nevertheless, humans cannot escape the *void* while alone transcending the material world;
They must follow the *Dao* of human relations and daily practice.
Yet how can they avoid action entirely?
But if they follow nature and act without contrivance,
Even if they act, it remains as *non-action*—
Just as Heaven speaks not yet transforms all things,
And the seasons proclaim their teachings without words.
The Emperor governs without action, and the ministers administer the affairs.
The trace of action is in the *form* (迹), while the essence of non-action is in the *spirit* (神).
Thus, seated in state with hands clasped,
The whole realm rejoices in peace and harmony—
Ah, how magnificent!

The *Dao* is inherently plain and ordinary,
Not seeking to display novelty or oddity,
Nor to exalt the strange and unusual.
When a state honors the worthy and able,
It is indeed a good thing,
But if they boast and vie over this,
The truly worthy remain worthy,
Yet the unworthy will also feign virtue.
Even worse, the worthy may condemn the unworthy as unworthy,
While the unworthy condemn the worthy as unworthy—
Thus, contention arises.
Each side mutually flaunts their merits,
Taking turns to support factions,
And from this, the world becomes embroiled in affairs.
When a state manages finances,
It is also a common practice,
But if they prize rare goods and treasure distant commodities,
The people will climb mountains and cross seas,
Risking peril and danger,
Undeterred by the hardships of travel or the fear for their lives,
To gather and present them to the court.
When they fail to obtain these,
They resort to every scheme imaginable—
Even thieves and brigands will not hesitate to seize them.
As for clothing and food,
These are also daily necessities,
Yet if one insists on delicacies and rare dishes,
And seeks only fine silks and embroidered garments,
Seeing what is desirable and desiring it—
When will this extravagant trend be corrected?

Thus, the Sage values the inner over the outer,
Necessarily nurturing the *heart* (神) with emptiness,
And filling the belly to nourish the *qi* (氣),
So that the *heart* and *qi* merge into one,
Flowing harmoniously throughout the body—
Smooth and integrated, soft and joyful,
And the will becomes weak.
Moreover, when the *heart* is still as a mountain,
And the *qi* flows like a spring,
The bones grow strong.
Ever embracing *One* (抱一),
And guarding the *Middle* (守中),
Not only does one remain without desire or thought,
But even the clever and learned,
Feeling the influence, are transformed within,
Daring not to act arbitrarily.
Some say, "If one acts, it will lead to chaos and criticism;
If one does not act, it will invite ridicule for its purity."
Between action and non-action, the distinction is indeed subtle.
Yet to act in accordance with nature—
This is not reckless action;
Action and non-action are equal in essence.
Thus, Confucius praised Shun (舜), saying:
*"Is it not Shun who governs without action?"*
**Chapter Four: Harmonizing with the Common**

The *Dao* is boundless yet applied—
Sometimes it does not fill,
Profound, like the source of all things.
It dulls the sharp, resolves the tangled,
Harmonizes its brilliance,
Merges with the dust.
Deep and still, as if it existed—
I know not whose child it is,
Resembling the Emperor before all beginnings.
The Emperor (帝) is the **Tian Di** (天帝, Heavenly Sovereign).
The *beginning* (先) is the beginningless beginning.
What is the *Dao*?
The **Taihe** (太和, Great Harmony) of *One Qi* (一氣),
Filling and permeating the heavens and earth,
Its extent encompassing the universe,
Its essence permeating past and present,
Its *virtue/power* (德) reaching all nine regions and myriad lands.
From the *taihuan* (胎卵, womb and egg) to the *shihua* (湿化, damp transformation),
From the *feizhan* (飛潛, flying and burrowing) to the *dongzhi* (動植, moving and growing),
No place exists where it is not present.
How vast is the *Dao*?
Yet its substance is empty, void, and boundless—
Without form, yet overflowing.
When it manifests and takes action,
It is vast and harmonious in its embrace,
Applied here and there, yet always fitting.
The *Classic of Poetry* says:
*"Left and right, left and right—
There is nothing it does not suit;
Left and right, left and right—
There is nothing it does not possess."*
Truly like rivers converging at the sea,
Yet the sea does not appear to be full—
Is it not indeed the fundamental principle of all things?

Confucius said:
*"The virtue/power (德) of ghosts and spirits
Nourishes all things without remainder."*
And again:
*"Speak of small matters without breaking them,
Speak of great matters without exhausting them."*
Its vast and profound nature is truly inexhaustible.

The *Dao* is so difficult to describe—
How then shall later generations cultivate it?
The **Taishang** (太上, Supreme Sage) out of compassion for ordinary people,
Points to its essence, saying:
*"The reason ordinary people cannot enter the *Dao*
Is that those with cleverness and wisdom,
Relying on their own abilities,
Act arbitrarily and haphazardly,
Thus, their minds become obstructed,
And the empty, responsive essence is not seen.
Now, to cultivate the *Dao*,
One must know that cleverness and wisdom
Are all demons that obstruct the *Dao*.
From this point onward,
One must abandon cleverness and lose wisdom,
Set aside the private inclinations of the ears and eyes,
And return all to the undifferentiated chaos—
All the sharpness of boasting in ability,
Relying on wisdom,
Arrogance toward things,
And domineering over people,
Must be completely blunted and extinguished,
So that the human heart dies and the *Dao* heart is born,
Knowledge vanishes and *wisdom* (慧) shines forth.»

The sages of old said: *"Those with cleverness and wisdom are not to be feared,
But those who sink deeply into the *Dao*, purify the heart, and observe its principles—these are truly to be feared.
Is this not the truth?*

The practitioner must take as primary
Settling the spirit, refining thoughts,
Reducing desires, and clearing the heart.
Yet how can one know?
The spirit of perception, thought, and deliberation—
The turbulent, false, and impure thoughts—
Swirl and disturb in ceaseless flux:
This thought not yet stilled, another arises;
This reflection not yet extinguished, another follows.
I must exhort and encourage myself,
Grant myself patience and release—
As tangled silk, I must trace its threads and unravel it;
As overgrown vines, I must uproot them and clear the ground.
Thus, all confusion dissolves,
And the *Heavenly Sovereign* remains ever serene.

Yet this is but the practice of solitary stillness,
Still not reaching the clamor of the world.
If one can be still but not move with the world,
It remains a rootless study.
One must examine oneself in stillness,
But when entering bustling scenes,
One must be all the more vigilant and cautious!
In all things, yield precedence to others,
Place yourself behind them,
Hold others above you,
And willingly submit below them.
Thus, there will be no conflict with the world,
No strife with others.

Moreover, men delight in the like and reject the unlike—
This is the common nature of the world.
I must only follow the currents, conform to their kind,
And harmonize with them.
Though I possess a luminous and upright heart,
I will not display its sharp edges.
I must only silently recognize their ways,
Subtly uphold their form,
Favor those who align with me,
And tolerate those who do not.
Thus, the people of Lu hunted hares,
Yet Confucius also hunted hares.
In ancient times, when the *Dao* was not yet illuminated,
The sages all mixed with the vulgar thus.

Again, observe the Sixth Patriarch:
Though his *Dao*-fruit was complete after receiving the robe and bowl,
Its subtlety was not yet exhausted.
Thus, he remained in the world, dwelling in Four Assemblies Mountain,
Living among hunters, unperturbed by their ways,
And so escaped harm.
Had he not blended with the dust and followed the light,
How could he have long preserved his life?

Through such dynamic and static cultivation,
Ever adapting with skill,
The originally pure, still, and luminous essence
Naturally remains embraced—
Yet it is not a fixed attainment:
If it seems to be somewhere, to be stored,
It is not truly stored.
A single radiant light flickers beneath the golden court.
What *Dao* is this?

It arises before Heaven and Earth,
Mingles within the void.
I do not know from whence it comes,
Nor to where it goes—
Whose child is it, truly?
The *Classic* says: *"There is a thing, mixed and complete,
Born before Heaven and Earth."*
Is this not the profound mystery of the *Dao*?

What form did the *Emperor* have before?
It was nothing but the undifferentiated chaos,
The indistinct *Hun-Meng*,
A single breath of empty clarity.
When the One Principle gave rise to myriad transformations,
And all things returned to spring,
The *Dao* dispersed through Heaven, Earth, and all beings—
Yet it remains beyond measure.
The cultivator who seeks to illuminate the *Dao*-body
Must observe the moment when Heaven and Earth are on the verge of opening,
When the unopened suddenly opens,
And thus discern the source of the *Dao*—
Then the foundation for practice will not lack.

The *Most High* outlines the *Dao*-body for all to see,
And teaches those who cultivate the Great *Dao*
To first recognize the *Dao*-source.
To seek the *Dao*-source,
One must first, within one’s own heart-nature,
Eliminate deceit and preserve sincerity,
And through gradual study,
Eventually reach the realm of spiritual transformation,
Only then knowing that within one’s heart-nature
Lies the essence of the *Dao*,
Ever present, never leaving one’s embrace.

One must seek its beginnings in stillness,
Using cultivation, reflection, and preservation
To safeguard the original purity,
Not overwhelming others with arrogance,
Nor confusing the mind with excess.
This is what Zhangzi called *"liberation from private desires."*

Parting the clouds to reveal the blue sky,
Severing the vines to expose the true face—
When one moves among people,
One must not conceal one’s light while displaying it,
Nor blend with the dust while remaining in it.
Some may flaunt their cleverness and wisdom,
Others their abilities,
Or perhaps assume the guise of a recluse in mist and stone,
Displaying an air of lofty detachment.
Observing history, many have invited disaster and calamity
Through such harm to the *Dao*.

Like the Han dynasty’s imprisonment of Confucius,
Or the *Qingliu* disasters of the Jin—
Though rooted in the treachery of petty men,
It was also because they did not know the *Dao* of preserving life through wisdom.

If one blends with the world, follows the light,
And mingles with the dust like the *lingzhi* among common grasses,
Or the phoenix flying with ordinary birds—
Unheard yet fragrant, unseen yet exalted—
Thus hiding one’s talents,
Thus nurturing oneself directly,
Then the still and ever-present *Dao*
Will hover between the eyebrows,
Existing yet not existing,
Having form yet none.

As the *Zhongyong* says:
*"The carriage of Heaven moves without sound or scent."*
What else could be before the *Emperor*?

**Chapter Five: Not Knowing to Guard the Center**

Heaven and Earth are not kind;
They treat all things as sacrificial dogs.
The sage is not kind;
He treats the people as sacrificial dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet not collapsing,
Moving yet ever producing more.

Much speech leads to exhaustion;
Better to guard the center.

Between Heaven and Earth,
The ceaseless generation and transformation,
The unrestrained motion—
All depend on this original *qi*,
Sustaining all between them.
It props up Heaven above,
Supports Earth below,
And flows through all beings,
Excluding none.

When this *qi* is undifferentiated and boundless,
It governs all things in orderly harmony—this is *principle*.
When it is vast and pervasive,
Encompassing all things,
Flowing and turning freely—this is *qi*.
The unity of *principle* and *qi* is *virtue*.

Thus, the sages of old said:
*"The virtuous one, with all human desires exhausted,
Allows Heaven’s *principle* to flow freely,
Without a trace of artificiality."*

「”Further, it says: *“Generating and transforming is called *Dao/Way* (仁).”* In essence, *Dao/Way* (仁) is like the *Dao/Way* (仁) inherent in wood: its generative *principle* (理) and generative *qi* (气) are fully complete without exception.

Between Heaven and Earth, all things are born; the sages nourish all people—none of this is without the *principle* (理) and *qi* (气) permeating through it. How could it be so trifling as to be seen merely in outward actions?

Thus, the *Taoist Master* (太上) spoke to clarify the *Dao/Way* (道):
*"If Heaven and Earth lacked this vital generative *qi* (生气), relying only on the teachings of the four seasons and the alternations of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness—
merely passing through cycles of movement—
then all things would lack any foundation to draw upon.
How would *qi* be received?
How would form be established?
In their view, all things would be as light as straw dogs (刍狗),
utterly unworthy of regard,
and would only see their gradual decay.*

*"If the sages lacked this true primordial essence (真元心体), depending solely on ministers, officials, and the promulgation of decrees, laws, and regulations
to instruct the common people,
then the rural masses would have no way to observe or be moved,
and how would people be transformed?
How would households prosper?
It would be as if the sages regarded these people as lowly as straw dogs (刍狗),
completely indifferent to their well-being,
and would only see their ruin and destruction.*

*"Yet why does Heaven and Earth, though lacking conscious intent (无心),
encompass all things—wind, cloud, rain, and dew—
without a single being excluded?
And why do the sages, though silent in speech (忘言),
assist and perfect all beings,
so that none fail to thrive within the world?
This clearly shows that Heaven, Earth, and the sages
all rely on this original generative *qi* (一元真气),
permeating and nourishing beings and things—
though there may be deprivation,
there is also creation;
though there may be coercive power (刑威),
there is also virtuous transformation (德化).
This so-called ‘lack of *Dao/Way* (仁)’ is precisely the ultimate expression of Heaven, Earth, and the sages’ *Dao/Way* (仁).*

*"If people do not know the *Dao/Way* (圣),
let them observe Heaven and Earth:
The upper *qi* (上浮) solidifies as Heaven,
the lower *qi* (下凝) condenses as Earth.
Between them, it is hollow yet luminous (空洞了明),
boundless and without obstruction (浑浩流转),
as vast as the unfathomable belly of a gourd (橐), yet freely communicating (龠之相通).
When it is empty and contains nothing (虚而无物),
it naturally follows the *qi*'s rise and fall (随气机之升沉),
unbent and unyielding (不挠不屈).
When it moves and becomes sound (动而为声),
it also listens to the transformations of beings and things (听人物之变化),
ever producing more that is strange and marvelous (愈出愈奇).
Observing Heaven and Earth,
it is no different from the gourd and its hollow (橐龠).
The sages are surely no different either.*

*"The scholar who guards the center (守中) and embraces the One (抱一),
boundless and without trace (空空无迹),
vast and without end (浩浩无垠),
the deeper the concealment (藏之愈深),
the broader the manifestation (发之愈溥).
Compared to those who fill halls with words (言堂满堂) or rooms with speech (言室满室),
the difference is as vast as Heaven and Earth (相隔不啻天渊).
Those who rely on words to set teachings (以言设教)
and exhaust their teachings through words (以教有尽),
how can they compare to those who treasure their vital essence (宝吾之精),
nourish their generative *qi* (裕吾之气),
and wander spiritually beyond form (神游象外),
while their *qi* permeates the rules of the world (气注规中),
ensuring nothing is left untransformed?
Truly great is the study of guarding the center (守中之学),
the essential path for cultivating the self (修身之要道).*

*"This is the original generative *qi* (一元真气).
Cultivating the self lies here,
governing the world also lies here.
Beyond this, so-called institutions and laws (制度法则)
are like traps and snares (筌蹄) for catching fish and rabbits (取鱼兔).
Fish and rabbits must rely on traps and snares to be obtained,
yet saying that one cannot catch fish and rabbits without them is wrong,
and saying that traps and snares *are* the fish and rabbits is also wrong.*

*"The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir (金丹大道) is like capturing Yang to supplement Yin (采阳补阴):
the forward path is short,
the backward path is long;
the small return of the Jade Nectar (玉液小还),
the great return of the Golden Nectar (金液大还)—
all are methods for catching fish and rabbits (取鱼兔之筌蹄).
If one regards them as the source of the Dao (道源),
one errs by a hair’s breadth and strays a thousand miles.*

*"Only this original *qi* (元气) is without sound or scent (无声无臭),
without form or shape (无象无形),
the shared generative *qi* of Heaven, Earth, and all beings.
The scholar who cultivates and refines must seek this single essence (一件丹头),
otherwise they will only burn and refine in vain (空烧空炼).
Otherwise, refining essence (炼精),
refining *qi* (炼气),
refining spirit (炼神),
refining emptiness (炼虚)—
all belong to studies without foundation (无本之学).
Practiced from childhood,
they will still yield no results by old age (到老犹无成).*

*"The *Taoist Master* (太上) teaches people to focus on guarding the center (守中用功),
while the key lies in the gourd’s hollow (消息在橐仑).
The learner must explore this themselves!"*

*"The phrase ‘not *Dao/Way* (仁)’ in the chapter is merely rhetorical.
**Chapter Six: The Immortal *Spirit* (谷神不死)**
The immortal *Spirit* (谷神) does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Mother (玄牝).
The Mysterious Mother’s gate—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth (天地根).
Endlessly present (绵绵若存),
yet never exhausted in its use (用之不勤).*

*"The matter of cultivation and refinement (修炼一事)
arises only because humans have a body (自有身后),
while their *qi* and nature are bound to the past (气质拘于前),
and desires for things obstruct the future (物欲蔽于后)—
just as gold and jade, though pure and flawless (精金良玉),
once plunged into filth (陷于污泥),
lose their brilliance (金之精者不精),
and their excellence (玉之良者不良).
Thus, to restore their original form (复原形),
one must not rely solely on washing away impurities (淘汰之力),
but also on the work of polishing and refining (琢磨之功),
to return to their initial essence (还乎初质).*

*"The *Taoist Master* (太上) shows the starting point for practice:
“‘The immortal *Spirit* (谷神) does not die.’*
What is meant by *Spirit* (谷神)?
Mountain caves are called *gǔ* (谷), speaking of their emptiness (虚);
Variation and unrestraint are called *shén* (神), speaking of their responsiveness (灵).
Not dying (不死) means the unceasing clarity of awareness (惺惺不昧).
If one can nourish the body of emptiness and responsiveness (虚灵不昧之体)
as the foundation for the elixir (丹头),
then cultivation and refinement will be effortless.*

*"Yet this is formless and shadowless (无形无影),
ungraspable and elusive (不可捉摸).
One must seek its traces in things that have sound and color (有声有色者).
The ancients said:
“‘To make the *Spirit* (谷神) of the *gǔ* (谷) endure without dying,
one must establish the foundation in the Mysterious Mother (玄牝).’*
Why is it called ‘Mysterious’ (玄)?
Mysterious (玄) is Heaven (天).
Why is it called ‘Mother’ (牝)?
Mother (牝) is Earth (地).
When Heaven and Earth unite (合),
the Mysterious Mother emerges (玄牝出),
and from the Mysterious Mother,
the opening and closing of all things is formed (阖辟成).
Between them, one ascends and one descends (一上一下),
one goes forth and one returns (一往一来),
cycling endlessly within the hollow of emptiness (旋循于虚无窟子)—
this is the gate of the Mysterious Mother (玄牝之门).*

*"Confucius said, ‘The *Gāi* (乾) and *Kūn* (坤) are the gate of the *Yì* (易),’
is this not true?
Through this gate (此门),
the path of Yin and Yang’s coming and going (阴阳往来之路) is traversed,
the realm of Heaven and Earth’s transformations (天地造化之乡) is realized,
and the birthplace of beings and things (人物发生之地) is found.
Obtaining it means life;
losing it means death.*
*If common people follow it conventionally (顺用之),
they become the path of death (死户);
If the sages invert and reverse it (颠倒之),
they become the gate of life (生门).*」

Alchemists who seek to refine elixirs for eternal life and enduring vision must pass through this **Mysterious Mother’s Gate**—there is no other path.

What else could be the root of Heaven and Earth?

When the cultivator draws the curtain to observe and reflect, in the state of undifferentiated ignorance, the common heart dies.
Suddenly awakened and stirred, the Dao-heart is born.
This is called: stillness as **Original Spirit**, movement as **True Intention**.

Within this, when the prenatal breath stirs—do not rigidly cling to the **dantian**;
rather, in the space neither inside nor outside, observe its rising and falling, its coming and going—
effortless, lively, and unrestrained—
and thus the true prenatal breath is attained.

The ancients said, *“Exit through the Mysterious, enter through the Mother”*—
this exit is not one’s original face,
this entry is not one’s original face either.
Only in this space of exit and entry lies the subtle truth,
which is **emptiness and responsiveness**.

This is the **True Yin** and **True Yang**,
manifesting as the **True One Qi**.

Is there anything beyond this as the root of Heaven and Earth?

Know that the **Valley Spirit** is the principle of the **Supreme Ultimate**;
the **Mysterious Mother** is the **Yin-Yang qi**.

In the **pre-heaven**, principle and qi were originally one;
in the **post-heaven**, principle and qi cannot be spoken of together.

Those who cultivate the Dao must seek this subtle orifice—
they must not be hasty in their intent,
nor negligent in their awareness.
Only by relying on the empty **Mysterious Mother**,
nurturing the **Valley Spirit** of emptiness and responsiveness,
neither clinging nor rejecting,
forgetting yet not assisting,
can it be attained.

Thus it is said:
*“Continuous as if it exists,
yet used without strain.”*

The **Great Dao** is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth.
The **Great Dao** is nameless, nourishing all things.
The Sage, though having substance, appears formless;
though real, appears empty—
revealing this most hidden, most subtle essence as the **Valley Spirit**.

The **Valley Spirit** is the spirit of the empty valley—
when questioned, it responds as if answering;
when called, it echoes as if replying—
this is immortality.

In the human body, it is the unified **emptiness and responsiveness** of true clarity.
Since humans lost their innate virtue, the **Valley Spirit** has long been submerged!

Later cultivators, seeking the **Valley Spirit** to remain eternal,
the **emptiness and responsiveness** to be unobscured,
as the foundation of the Golden Elixir and the root of the Dao,
must revolve in the void without grasping—
only by observing the **subtle orifice** through **non-desire and desire**,
when the **having and non-having** align,
when the **subtle orifice** fully opens,
does the **Mysterious Mother** stand revealed.

Thus it is said:
*“This orifice is no ordinary orifice,
Heaven and Earth together form it.
Called the **Divine Qi Hole**,
within it lies the **Kān-Lǐ essence**.”*

Only when **essence, qi, and spirit** are fused as one
does it become the **orifice of having and non-having**,
the **gate of life and death**;
otherwise, it remains an ordinary orifice,
with no **True One Qi** dwelling within—
if empty, it falls into coarse vacuity;
if solid, it is bound by form—
neither is the body of **emptiness and responsiveness**.

Only this **Mysterious Mother’s Gate**—
neither empty nor solid,
both empty and solid—
holds an ineffable truth:
still, it is formless;
moving, it takes shape.
Stillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth,
movement is not the origin of beings—
only at the juncture of stillness and movement
lies the **Kān-Lǐ inversion**,
the realm where **sun and moon intersect**—
truly the **Heavenly Root and Earthly Cavern**.

When the student attains the **True Mysterious** and **True Mother**,
each ascent and descent—
the qi within this space,
condensed as **nature**,
emanating as **emotion**—
from the **extreme emptiness and profound stillness**,
the **Law-forms** arise.

Knowing this orifice,
the Dao of immortality is exhausted here.

When it says *“Continuous as if it exists”*,
it means nourishment must be sustained long,
before the prenatal breath can stir.
When it says *“Used without strain”*,
it means extraction and supplementation must be timed,
so the **sympathetic fire** is neither recklessly added nor diminished.

If one follows the **natural Dao of Heaven and Earth**,
the Golden Elixir will be obtained.

---
**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Persists**

Heaven endures, Earth persists.
The reason Heaven and Earth can endure and persist
is that they do not **self-generate**—
thus they attain eternal life.

Therefore, the Sage places his body last,
yet his body is first;
sets his body aside,
yet his body is preserved.
Is this not because he is without selfishness?
Only because he is without selfishness
can he fulfill his selfishness.

The **qi** of Heaven and Earth flows boundlessly,
enduring countless eons without exhaustion,
all because the **True One Sovereign** silently governs within—
this is why Heaven and Earth endure without limit.

Even as they give birth and nourish all things,
endlessly sustaining life,
Heaven and Earth are never depleted—
this is why the **mechanism of qi** remains unbroken through the ages.

The **Supreme Sage** said, *“Heaven endures, Earth persists”*—
is this not true?

Yet why can Heaven and Earth endure and persist?
Because they do not **self-generate**.
If they had a **self-generating** intent,
Heaven and Earth would have emotions,
and Heaven too would age.

Only by not possessing their own life,
and instead taking all beings as their life,
does the unceasing generation of all beings
become the unceasing generation of Heaven and Earth—
thus, **eternal life**.

Most people are ignorant of this principle of generation:
they do not seek life but seek death,
do not seek eternal life but seek swift death.
They drown in wealth, honor, fame, and power;
they sink in sounds, colors, goods, and profits.
They constantly calculate, endlessly scheme—
in just a few years, their essence is exhausted,
their qi weakened,
their spirit and vitality scattered—
they toil through countless hardships,
yet barely enjoy one lifetime.
Pursuing life only to court death—
how can this be lamented enough!

Thus the Sage follows Heaven and models Earth:
he does not chase after the world’s gains,
nor does he greedily seek techniques for prolonging life.
Only the **Great Dao** comes first—
he clears his mind’s field,
refines his **command root**,
and in all matters of nourishing the body,
he never has time to scheme—
as if he places his body last,
yet his body is preserved.

In the end, his **virtue** is established,
and none surpass him among his kind;
his **name** is fulfilled,
and later generations still revere his model.

The Sage does not place his body last yet preserves it first,
nor does he neglect his body yet sustains it—
how far above the world’s selfish who destroy their own lives!
Yet the Sage is not one who feigns emotion or acts out of eccentricity;
from ancient times, he has loved simplicity and clarity,
maintaining purity of heart, never floating with the vulgar,
nor relying on form to establish himself—
unbounded and impartial, like Heaven and Earth’s boundless generosity.

Mortals are deeply self-absorbed, their hearts burdened with cares,
while the Sage holds no private attachments—
his luminous essence transcends all things.
A single expanse of empty clarity, a hollow yet radiant spirit,
constantly shining yet never dimmed.

If one were to obsess over this mortal coil—
this fleshly vessel, this stinking sack—
constantly fretting day and night,
how could one ever be first yet not last,
or endure yet perish?

Only through selflessness does one align with Heaven and Earth,
harmonize with the sun and moon,
and thus fulfill one’s true purpose.

Later cultivators who seek an immortal body and unbroken spirit,
though they refine with relentless austerity,
shaking off filth and enduring prolonged tempering,
naturally attain a realm beyond the mundane—
a world apart from the world’s rise and fall—
what greater joy is there?

Heaven and Earth speak not, yet their primal *qi* circulates endlessly,
so life’s cycle renews without ceasing.
Thus Heaven and Earth endure eternally, ever fresh through the ages.

The Sage harmonizes with Heaven and Earth,
nurturing the *qi* of Great Unity,
returning to the primal undifferentiated truth.

At rest, his virtue stands firm—
in action, his conduct is royal.
What of those who speak of self-cultivation yet only seek secluded mountains,
or of rulers who exhaust themselves in schemes?
These cling to extremes, each serving their own narrow ends—
some empty and detached, others frenzied and grasping.

The Sage in adversity remains pure and unstained,
his true form as enduring as mountains and rivers;
in prosperity, he benefits all beings,
his transient body and noble rank alike light as feathers.

When his name echoes through the cosmos,
his body transcends time—
his deeds cover the world,
his presence lingers beyond his age—
is this not the power of selflessness?

The scholar who discards all attachments,
empties all forms,
and forever severs worldly roots—
if his virtue accumulates, he abides in the mortal realm;
if he ascends, he endures in the celestial expanse.
To forsake self-interest yet attain longevity—
how vast the difference from those bound by worldly calculations!

Can one truly sever external temptations?

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Virtue is Like Water**

The supreme virtue is like water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend—
it dwells where others disdain,
and thus approaches the Dao.

It rests in the lowest places,
its heart is deep,
its words are trustworthy,
its governance is effective,
its actions are skillful,
its movements are timely.

Only because it does not contend
does it incur no blame.

The Great Dao has no other mystery—
only the unification of spirit and *qi*,
returning to the boundless *Tai Ji*,
the single point of primal *qi* from which parents sprang.

If one does not attend to the Dao,
spirit and *qi* separate—
lead scatters, mercury flees—
thus water and fire become divided.

Mencius said: *"Without water and fire, people cannot live."*
This saying, shallowly interpreted, refers to daily needs;
deeply understood, it is the key to cultivation.

Sometimes fire warms water and true *yang* manifests;
sometimes water nourishes fire and sweet dew arises.
The marvels of water and fire—
truly beyond words.

Yet water and fire share the same essence;
speak of water, and fire is known.

Water’s nature is yielding—
the Dao values humility.

Thus the Sage of supreme virtue,
heart serene and *qi* balanced,
with gentle intent,
allows all things to flourish naturally—
none escape his beneficence.

Ultimately, his deeds cover the world yet he knows no merit,
his actions fill the cosmos yet he claims no credit.
Only by following Heaven and Earth’s natural order,
fulfilling all things’ true nature,
does he remain unopposed—
truly like water, benefiting all without contention.

Not only this—
all things prefer clarity to turbidity,
elevation to lowliness.
Yet water cleanses others while dwelling in filth,
elevates others while humbling itself.
Oh water, water—
how perfectly you embody the Dao!

The Sage’s nature aligns with water’s—
gentle, not rigid,
humble in self-cultivation.
What others cannot endure,
the Sage accepts as natural;
what others most abhor,
the Sage treats as ordinary.
Thus he harbors no ill will toward himself,
nor contends with others.
Only the Sage of the Dao can do this.
Hence it is said:
*"Dwelling where others disdain—
this approaches the Dao."*

The Dao’s blessings upon oneself
are received in one’s proper place—
nowhere is it not advantageous.
Even in poverty or wealth,
gain or loss,
calamity or death—
what mortals cannot bear,
the Sage regards with equanimity.

The gentleman discusses principles, not *qi*;
speaks of nature, not fate—
only reflecting inward to cultivate virtue.

Yet virtue arises from a single source,
though its paths vary—
how could it drift without foundation,
boundless yet without end?
There must be a place of ultimate goodness,
where one rests without straying,
only then can one grow silently,
nurturing true nature daily,
while worldly desires fade.

The *Yijing* says:
*"His back is firm yet he does not grasp his body,
he walks in the courtyard yet sees no one"—
this is the Sage’s dwelling in the lowest place.

When dwelling is secure,
its resources are profound.
Gazing inward at the heart—
empty, containing nothing,
deep as the depths—
oh, how profound!

The Sage examines outward encounters,
choosing worthy companions—
truly, how profound his virtue!

When it comes to words,
a thousand gold pieces cannot match a single promise,
for *"speech must be true to virtue"* (i.e., *"faithful and good"*).

In governance,
great benevolence is as nothing compared to great virtue—
*"virtue governs well"* (i.e., *"governance is true to virtue"*).

Extending this to all things—
objects, deeds, actions, or stillness—
every aspect aligns with the Dao.

Assigning tasks to others,
he only hopes they do not fail in their abilities.

Considering actions with care,
he seeks only that they occur at the proper time.

Thus does the Sage cultivate himself and govern the world.

This arises from *"resting in ultimate goodness,"*
finding his place of security,
and then all his actions are measured and harmonious.

For in every moment and place,
there is no flaw, no deficiency—
what need is there for strife?

Only when one does not contend,
does humanity respond with gratitude and reverence,
engraved upon the bones and etched in the heart—
then one attains *"loyalty without ambition"* (i.e., *"true devotion without ulterior motives"*),
and what grievance could there be?
What blame could there be?

Even if there are wicked men,
they too are transformed into goodness.

When one reaches this pinnacle,
effortless and natural,
all are at ease in the *"unaware and unknown"* (i.e., *"the boundless, primordial state"*),
nearly forgetting the *"water-like goodness"* (i.e., *"the natural, unassuming virtue"*),
soft yet resolute, beneficent without fail.

Pointing to the heart of ultimate goodness—
ever ordinary, without preference or aversion,
boundless and without obstruction,
perfectly harmonious and yielding—

Thus, in high station he is not arrogant,
in lowly place he does not falter;
toward himself he finds no fault,
toward others he bears no grudge.

Yet how does one attain this state?
It is not through the learning of the vulgar world,
nor by the hollow studies of those without foundation.

Hence, the highest Sage dwells
behind what the crowd abhors,
then reveals a place of goodness.

What is this place?
It is the *"inner depths of the heart"*—
an inch of sincerity is an inch of ground.

To find this place is to have a foundation for life and vitality;
to lose it is to be without master of spirit and *qi*.

Without mastery, there is confusion—
how could one harmonize all things,
uniting inner and outer,
acting in self and others without strife?

Yet if one says this place *exists*,
one risks falling into rigid attachment;
if one says it *does not exist*,
one stumbles into dull emptiness.

This is the *"neither existence nor nonexistence"* (i.e., *"the transcendent, ungraspable state"*),
unbound by action or stillness.

To cultivate the ultimate Dao,
one must carefully ponder its essence—
accumulate abundant *yin* merit,
nurture wide-ranging virtue,
and thus ascend toward divine harmony,
either through a teacher’s guidance,
or through sudden enlightenment,
to attain this place,
lest one stray into false paths and left-handed doctrines,
and fulfill one’s lifelong aspirations.

This place understood,
the Dao is half attained.

What follows—words of *"heart"* and *"speech"*—
illuminates that in every moment and place,
one must examine and align with ultimate goodness,
lest one dwell without first securing it.

All that is said thereafter,
nothing can surpass goodness—
this is the true essence of learning,
the foundation of practice.
If one neglects this,
holding oneself and engaging with others,
all matters will crumble.

I have briefly revealed this,
hoping those in the world with resolve
will not rely on their talents and intellect,
arrogantly guessing and presuming,
while failing to cultivate virtue and turn back the heavens;
only with a humble heart may one seek the Dao.

**Chapter Nine: Accomplishment and Withdrawal**

*"Filled and overflowing, it is not as good as stopping in time."*
*"Sharpened and kept keen, it cannot be long preserved."*
*"Gold and jade fill the halls, yet none can guard them."*
*"Rich and noble yet proud, one invites calamity upon oneself."*

When accomplishment is achieved and name secured,
one must withdraw—
the Dao of Heaven.

The ancients said:
*"To cross the river, use a raft;
having reached the shore, no need for the boat."*

Again they said:
*"Before attaining merit, one must study the Way;
when merit is attained, one must forget the Way."*

These few words are indeed the most vital for cultivating the Dao.

If one practices the Dao and fulfills its work,
having already entered the realm of profound and vast attainment,
yet still clings and boasts—
*"My learning is refined, my cultivation pure"*—
one cannot avoid the rise of arrogance and agitation,
either falling into withdrawal or contradiction.

If such is the case,
how could the Dao endure?
How could virtue exist?

Thus the **Tàishàng** says:
*"Hold and fill it to the brim—
it is better to stop before that.
Sharpen it to a point—
it cannot be long preserved."*

When the practitioner’s refinement is yet insufficient,
one must undergo countless purifications and selections,
washing out a single point of utmost purity
to serve as the foundation for longevity.

If one obtains **True Yang**,
boiling it at dawn and refining it at dusk,
the **preheaven essence** fills the body inside and out—
then the body stands firm as a thousand-foot wall,
the mind serene as autumn moon over still water.

When the **external kidney** shrinks like that of a child,
the state of **leak-proof, all-pervasive attainment** is achieved.

At this time, when essence is full within the body,
one must not further apply the **fire talisman**—
instead, one should cease all fire-working,
and in **non-knowing, non-awareness**,
become **muddle-headed and indistinct**,
completely forgetting the state of fullness as attainment.

If one persists in holding to fullness,
one risks the peril of **elixir collapse and cauldron overturn**—
better to stop early than to press on.

When **qi** is yet insufficient,
one must undergo countless firings and refinings,
stirring the **civilized and martial divine fires**,
to forge the **preheaven one-element true qi** as the basis for longevity.
When all **profane qi** is exhausted,
it transforms into a single piece of **pure yang**—
most vast, most potent—
penetrating the body’s sinews and bones,
nimble as a dragon, fierce as a tiger.
What sharper refinement could there be?

I must **concentrate qi to attain softness**,
as a babe in its **innocent, unknowing** state—
only then can one long preserve the qi,
reaching **perfection of form and spirit**, merging with the Dao and attaining **authentic truth**.

If one persists in sharpening without cease,
one risks the danger of **wildfire consuming all**—
how could such a state endure?

This is like **gold and jade filling a hall, yet none able to guard them**—
or a wealthy noble family,
indulging in extravagance, trampling morality,
proud and domineering—
like the **Luan clan’s extinction** or the **Fan family’s ruin**,
all because they failed to curb their excess,
acting lawlessly until they invited their own ruin.

Thus, observing human affairs,
the **Heavenly Way** becomes clear.

See how in spring it is warm,
yet by summer the **hot sun rules supreme**—
no longer temperate.
By autumn it grows cool,
and in winter the **cold dominates**—
no trace of the western wind remains.

When things are nurtured to completion,
their season passes—
Heaven and Earth withdraw and conceal,
preserving the **harmonious virtue of yang**.
If winter were both cold and warm,
or summer both hot and cool,
this would be **Heaven’s Way in reverse**—
seasons out of order,
completion without withdrawal—
just the **perverse qi** that brings great harm to humankind.

Thus it is said:
*"When accomplishment is achieved and name secured,
one must withdraw—
the Dao of Heaven."*

If Heaven itself is thus,
how much more so for humankind?

In history, wise ministers of great achievement—
their deeds resplendent, names renowned—
yet failing to retreat into the mountains,
like **Wenzhong of Yue** or **Han Xin of Han**,
met with disaster—
many perishing, their families ruined.

Thus, those who study the Dao,
when their essence is refined and qi is full,
must **forget the method, forget the form**,
lest they ruin their own Way.

But those who have not yet reached this state—
how could they abandon method or form?

This teaching instructs those who cultivate the Great Dao:
**drop one link, advance one link**—
never self-satisfied, lest **slothful and arrogant hearts arise**,
and disaster strike before one turns.

Even without the peril of **leakage**,
one risks **halfway abandonment**,
unable to cross to the other shore
and enter the realm of **spirit-transformation**.

The *Awakening to Truth* says:
*"Before refining the elixir, refine swiftly;
after refining, know when to stop.
If one clings to fullness without end,
one risks sudden ruin and disgrace."*

It is clear that the Dao has no end,
and achievement no limit—
what use is **pretended fullness**?

Many ancient cultivators met with death or ruin,
all because they failed to **conceal their light and nurture obscurity**,
to **blend with the vulgar and follow the dust**.

The **Alchemical Canon** states:
*"Cultivate while blending with the vulgar,
harmonize while keeping light hidden.
Round when round, square when square—
hidden or revealed, following others unrecognized,
teaching people how to see **retreat and concealment**."*

Thus, the **true adept** must hide deeply,
adjusting with the times—
only then can one **not differ, not oppose**,
**neither good nor evil**,
long preserving one’s life.

Otherwise, **virtue cultivated invites slander**,
**high Dao invites calumny**—
though this may stem from others’ malice,
it is also self-inflicted by **excessive display**.

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Hoard lazily and invite theft;
adorn oneself and invite licentiousness."*
Truly, self-inflicted.

Why should those who are self-satisfied expect otherwise?

I wish later learners:
Before advancing, follow the method with discipline;
when deeply attained, cease all fire-working—
only then may one avoid the peril of **self-immolation**.

**Chapter Ten: Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness**

*"Carrying the vital essence and embracing unity—
can one avoid separation?
Concentrating qi to attain softness—
can one resemble an infant?
Purifying and illuminating the mysterious—
can one avoid blemish?
Loving the state, governing the people—
can one act without action?
Heaven’s Gate opening and closing—
can one avoid passivity?
Bright and all-pervading—
can one avoid knowing?
Nurturing and preserving—
nurturing without possession,
acting without reliance,
nourishing without domination—
this is called **mysterious virtue**."*

This chapter begins by speaking of the **method of refining essence into qi**.
Having obtained essence and qi within the body,
one must **unify heart and virtue**,
preventing even momentary separation—
for separation scatters the **Three Treasures** of essence, qi, and spirit,
preventing their reunion at the **ultimate extreme**,
which serves as the foundation for elixir-refining.

Thus the **Tàishàng** says:
*"Carrying the vital essence and embracing unity—
can one avoid separation?"*

**Yíng** is blood.
Blood is generated by the heart, **pò** stored by the heart—
its light must illuminate the **elixir field**,
the heart unmoving,
so that the **soul** may settle into the **spirit**,
and the **moon** returns as **pure yin**.
This occurs when **heart-yang enters kidney-yin**,
the **divine fire** illuminating the **blood-water**—
though water is cold and metal frigid,
the **divine fire** boils and refines it,
and it rises spontaneously,
uncontrollably effervescent.

「The **Perfect Adept** understands this **mysterious mother** as the root of heaven and earth. Thus, within each breath—one inhalation, one exhalation—when the subtle **yang** stirs, he fixes his gaze with one eye, grasps it with one hand, and directs a drop of his own **mercury** to meet it. With left rotation and right withdrawal, he draws it back to the **middle elixir field**, congealing it so that it does not scatter. Then, he carries the **soul** and returns, embraces **unity** and dwells within it, without pause. In this way, the **true yang** flourishes, and the **true qi** moves powerfully.

From this, he operates the **River Vehicle**, igniting fire from the **empty perilous acupoint** and drawing it to the **tail end**. He strikes the **Ninefold Iron Drum**, mobilizing the **Three-Legged Golden Toad**, ascending it to the crown—all must be done with **one heart** focused, unerring and unceasing—until it reaches the **mud pellet**, where the **Muni’s treasure pearl** is obtained. If he does not then **nurture and temper** it for a moment, the **mud pellet’s yin essence** will not transform, and how could **lead and mercury** fuse harmoniously? How could it become **sweet dew divine water** to moisten the hundred **vessels** of the body?

Once the **mud pellet** is nurtured, he further guides it downward through the **lower ninefold palace** and into the **crimson palace**, which is the **retreat of yin at noon**. Yet when advancing the fire, he must take its **rigidity**, not the **virtue/power** of **pure health**—otherwise, the **true gold** cannot ascend. At the time of **yin’s retreat**, he must take its **gentleness**, not the **virtue/power** of compliance—otherwise, the **yang lead** remains scattered, unable to subdue the **mercury** into **elixir**. Hence it is said:
*"Can one focus **qi** to achieve **gentleness** like a newborn infant?"*

Its meaning instructs that after **yin’s birth**, one must maintain a **one-hearted** clarity, allowing the **vital mechanisms** to descend naturally, as they are, as they are, without adding a single intention or exerting a single force. This is the **gentleness** of the **Kūn hexagram**, the **Way** of the **Noble Person**’s cultivation. When descending to the **palace** for nurturing, returning to the **earthen cauldron**, and sealing it firmly, one must only dwell in **serenity and tranquility**, blending and calming it. In a mere instant, the **qi** breathes as if nonexistent, and the **spirit’s mechanisms** seem extinguished—this is the attainment of **gentleness**.

After nurturing for a while, the **spirit** and **qi** return to their roots, like a **fire seed** in the furnace, slowly congealing and refining. If one does not let it wander recklessly, the **true qi** will naturally flow and circulate throughout the body. With **one heart** at peace, the limbs become supple, as if the body of an infant—soft as cotton, delicate as silk—exhibiting a **gentleness** that cannot bear the weight of things. This is sufficient evidence that the **elixir** is congealing.

From this point, **lead and mercury** merge, and **water and fire** are harmonized. One must then **purify the heart** and **cleanse the mind**, cultivating the **true lead** in solitude. If the mind wanders even slightly, the **elixir** will scatter wildly—it cannot be refined, nor will the **lead** from the **water realm** belong to you. The *Scripture of Purity* states:
*"The heart without its heart, things without their things.
The void lacks nothing to void, the none lacks nothing to none—
serene and ever still,
naturally tranquil."*

And what flaw could there be?

Hence it is said:
*"Can one purify and perceive the **mysterious** without flaw?"*

Even if the **external elixir** is obtained, if the **internal illumination** is not strict, then **human desires** remain uncleansed and **heavenly principle** impure. How could one attain a single **grain of barley**—**void** yet forming the **embryo**?

When the **elixir** is present in the body, one must still **preserve essence** and **abundantly nourish qi**, to form the **sage’s womb**. Yet even so, **preserving essence** must follow **nature’s spontaneity**, and **nourishing qi** must align with **effortless ease**. This **non-preservation** surpasses preservation, and this **non-nourishment** surpasses nourishment. Otherwise, if one clings to **treasure** and **value**, harm is inevitable.

The **elixir** is the **primordial essence** of the **first heaven**, formless and without trace—why must it be made? If one seeks it through **manifestation**, one risks **stirring fire** in the **later heaven**, and the **Great Dao** of the **first heaven** will be lost. Hence it is said:
*"Can one govern the people and rule the land without action?"*
The people are likened to **essence**, the land to **qi**. The key to governing lies in **love** for the people. To establish laws and rule the land is but a minor relief for the **tyrant**—far from the **sage’s** effortless governance.

The **auspicious and harmonious** reigns, the **vital mechanisms** in contention—all lies between **action** and **non-action**. The **Way** of cultivating the body is to **stabilize essence** as the people’s security and **abundant qi** as the land’s prosperity. Refining oneself **stabilizes essence**, while **direct nourishment** fills **qi**. At its utmost, the **vast and mighty** **yang** overflows the two realms—yet even then, it is seen as an ordinary possession, a mundane practice. One does not boast of **capabilities**, nor does one flaunt **wisdom**. In **primordial unity**, one forgets to forget what is **full and complete**—**non-action** yet **great action** emerges.

When the **student** reaches this stage—**essence overflowing**, **qi abundant**—if he nurtures it long enough, the **crown will naturally split open**, and he may ride the clouds, roam the islands, far surpassing those who formerly **strictly adhered** to **circular breathing** and **focused qi to achieve gentleness**. Hence it is said:
*"Can one open and close the **heavenly gate** without **femininity**?"*
This refers to the former days of **adjusting spirit** and **nurturing the womb**—one could not avoid **femininity**. But now, with the **yang spirit** fully robust, **detached from the mundane body**, it bursts through the **heavenly gate**, ascending toward the **celestial expanse**—truly a joy!

How could **qi** be so robust? At this point, the **heart** is like a **clear mirror**, the **nature** as **still water**—**clear as the sky**, **lively as the earth**. All **perceptions and cognitions** of the **spirit of knowledge** dissolve into the **void**, transforming into the **primordial spirit**. Formerly, one knew what came before and was aware of what followed; now, **illuminated and transparent**, one is **omniscient yet unobstructed**.

Yet **ever-serene** and **ever-illuminated**, there is no **heart of serenity or illumination**; **ever-clear** and **ever-aware**, there is no **thought of clarity or perception**. It is as if all things come and are **reflected**—like a **high-suspended mirror**, nothing can hide. And all this is rooted in **non-action**, with **action** as its application.

When **yang** has not yet arisen, one **accumulates essence** and **nurtures qi** to generate it. Once **yang** has arisen, one **treasures essence** and **abundantly nourishes qi** to store it. When later, one **remains in form** and **transforms the world**, having **accumulated merit** and **amassed virtue**, even in birth, one does not boast of **nurturing**—even in action, one does not rely on **clinging to gentleness**—even in longevity, one does not depend on **forced subjugation**.»

「The **heart** of one **kalpa**—the **heart** of ten thousand **kalpas**—truly may be called the **Celestial Sovereign**, wielding the authority to govern **creation and transformation**. Hence, it is termed **"Mysterious Virtue/Power."**

Here, the nine stages of **foundation-building to obtain the elixir**, **refining the self to return the elixir**, and **shedding the mortal coil to attain the Pearl** are expounded—yet all boil down to **ultimate emptiness and profound stillness**, **embracing the Three and holding the One**, **vague and indistinct, dim and obscure** as the essence. From **self-cultivation within** to **returning the elixir**, one cannot depart from **blending the manifest with the unmanifest**, **transforming action into non-action**.

For **Primordial One-Element True Qi** dwells hidden within **void and nothingness**, beyond the realm of sight and sound. If one **extinguishes awareness** and **abandons action**, this **One-Element True Qi** remains ever-present.

Thus, the **Most High** declares:
*"Faint and indistinct, yet within it lies form;
Indistinct and faint, yet within it lies substance;
Dim and obscure, yet within it lies essence."*
This reveals that **life gives birth to Heaven and Earth**—originally **chaotic and formless**, beyond comparison. Only by **unifying the spirit-mind** and **obliterating perception** does the **Dao** reside therein.

Should one awaken to **Great Clarity and Awareness**, then **post-heavenal consciousness** arises in response to thoughts—no longer the **Primordial Original Spirit**. Thus, one must seek in **vagueness and indistinctness**, attain in **dimness and obscurity**. Let the cultivator know whence to begin.

**Chapter Eleven: Non-Action as Function**

Thirty spokes converge at a single hub—when the **hub is empty**, the **function of the cart** arises.
Clay is molded into vessels—when the **center is hollow**, the **function of the vessel** arises.
Doors and windows are carved for a room—when the **space is empty**, the **function of the room** arises.
Thus, **having** is for **utility**, while **emptiness** is for **function**.

The **Dao** originates at the **Primordial Chaos**, merging within **void and nothingness**—invisible, inaudible. How then does the cultivator proceed?

The Sage knows the **substance of the Dao** is formless, yet its **function** manifests in forms. Thus, **manifesting the unmanifest**, **embodying the empty**, they **plunder qi from the Chaos** and **withdraw the spirit from the dim**, to complete the **Great Dao of True Unity** and eternally become **immortal and transcendent**.

What is called **"substantial and manifest"**? The **True Yin and True Yang**, beings of the same kind.
What is called **"empty and unmanifest"**? The **Primordial Dao’s root**, the **Dragon-Tiger Eight-Trigrams’ initial tension qi**.

Where there is **qi without substance**, the **Dao is manifest**.
Thus it is said: *"When Yin and Yang unite, Primordial Qi appears; when Yin and Yang separate, Post-Heavenal form is complete."*
The *Classic of Change* states:
*"Above form, it is called the Dao; below form, it is called Qi."*
It is not that there is no vessel without the Dao, nor is it that there is no Dao without a vessel to bear it.

The **Most High** illustrates with the cart:
*A cart has spokes and a hub—thirty spokes symbolize the movement of sun and moon, while the hub sits centrally, pierced by all axles. The hub is hollow within, the spokes converge without—thus it turns without hindrance. Were it not for this inner void, how could one be carried? How could things be stored?*
Hence, *"When the hub is empty, the cart’s function arises."*

Again, like pottery:
*Mixing water with clay, kneading into vessels—once fired, the exterior is solid, the interior hollow. Yet in all human utility, the value lies not in the clay’s substance but in the hollow’s emptiness. As with Tao Qian transporting bricks, were there not this empty space, how could they move freely?*
Hence, *"When the center is empty, the vessel’s function arises."*

Similarly, in building a room:
*One must carve doors and windows—only then does light radiate fully. Yet upon entering, the doors and windows seem unnecessary; it is the empty space that allows one to sit comfortably, though the room itself is formed. Hence, *"When the space is empty, the room’s function arises."*

From these three examples, **emptiness** manifests as **form** for the **cart, vessel, and room**; **emptiness** manifests as **void** for **carrying, storing, and dwelling**. Yet what pertains to **manifest forms** is the **utility of extension**; what pertains to **unmanifest void** is the **function of extension**.

Thus it is said: *"Having is for utility; emptiness is for function. Having and lacking, lacking and having—each is the root of the other."*

In essence, the **Dao** originates from **void and nothingness**, yet without **Yin and Yang**, it cannot be seen. **Qi** belongs to **Yin and Yang**, yet without the **Dao**, it cannot arise. **Yin and Yang** emerge after **Heaven and Earth**, with defined shapes and locations—**they cannot be the elixir of longevity**. Only by seeking the **Dao** within **Yin and Yang**, returning through **Yin and Yang** to the **Primordial Pole**, can **before and after merge**, and the **Great Dao** be attained.

Later **elixir cultivators**, serving only **manifest qi**, fail to refine the **unmanifest elixir**. To seek transcendence while doing so—is this not like driving a cart southward while heading north?

The **Dao** has no name; it is **named Dao** by force.
The **Dao** requires no cultivation; it is **called cultivation** by force.
For the **Dao** as a thing—**ultimately empty, ultimately nothing**—only then can it be **ultimately divine, ultimately sage**.

Observe how **Heaven and Earth’s qi** is clear and void, containing nothing. Yet when suppressed for long, the **qi-machine stirs**, and **Yin and Yang** arise. Then **forms and colors** emerge, **patterned and vivid**, filling the four quarters. Who created them? Who gave them birth?

The **Dao** gives rise to **One Qi**, and **One Qi** transforms into **Yin and Yang**, from which all things are born.
Thus it is said:
*"The **Dao** from **emptiness and nothingness** generates **One Qi**,
Then from **One Qi** **Yin and Yang** arise.
**Yin and Yang** thus form the **Three Families**,
And the **Three Families** give birth to myriad transformations, flourishing evermore."*

Those who cultivate seek the **Dao’s true essence** to attain the **body of the Transcendent Sage**. They must first take **Yin and Yang** as their **instrument**, then **emptiness and nothingness** as their **root**. Only then will the **Great Dao** be attained.

Within this chapter, the **three "Wu" (無) characters**—they speak of **emptiness** where there is **emptiness**. Roughly, it means: the cultivator, from **nothingness** to **somethingness**, from **somethingness** back to **nothingness**, until **pure and void One Qi** is achieved, and only then does the **Great Dao** take form. Its meaning is surely drawn from this.

**Chapter Twelve: Rejecting the Extraneous, Taking the Essential**

The **five colors** blind the eyes;
The **five tones** deafen the ears;
The **five flavors** dull the palate;
**Hunting and galloping** drive the mind to madness;
**Rare treasures** obstruct one’s conduct.

Thus the **Sage** nourishes the **abdomen**, not the eyes—
Hence, **reject the extraneous, take the essential**.

The world’s restless pursuit—
Chasing after **sounds, colors, wealth, and gain**,
Gazing far and wide,
Delighting the eyes, pleasing the mouth—
Is this not because the **true joys within** are truly delightful?

Who knows that the **pleasures of the world** are limited,
While the **pleasures of the heart** are boundless?

Moreover, where **pleasure** is, **worry** is also.
What benefits the **body** harms the **mind**.

Take **five-colored patterns**—
Their hues are radiant, their designs dazzling.
Who does not **see them and rejoice**, **behold them and be astonished**?
Yet the moment the eyes fix upon them,
The **spirit grows dizzy**.

Human vitality—how much can there be?
To linger on sights, indulge the senses,
And call it **beauty**—
Whoever does so will find their **qi obstructed**, their **spirit wasted**, their **mind in turmoil**, and their **eyes blinded in return**.

Thus it is said: *"The **five colors blind the eyes**"*—
A truth most profound.

As for the **melodies of silk and bamboo**, the **sounds of pipes and flutes**,
Even the **Ancients** did not abandon them.
Yet the **foolish and debauched**,
Indulging in **female musicians and singing boys**,
Exhaust their **spirit** for fleeting pleasure—
Before the music ends, the **clanging still resounds**,
Yet the **inner essence of the ears** has already dissipated outward,
And the **ears grow deaf in return**.

Thus it is said: *"The **five tones deafen the ears**."*

As for the **mouth’s taste**—
Balanced **sweet and fatty**, **thick and thin**—
Even the **Sage** requires them.
But the **gluttonous**,
Greedy for the **mouth’s desires**, craving **rich flavors**,
Fill their tables with **delicacies**, their kitchens with **exotic meats**,
Spending **thousands in gold** for a single meal without hesitation.
Do they not know that what **pleases the mouth** harms the **mind**?

Moreover, the **heart contains boundless supreme flavors**—
Without **fattening meats**, yet **sweet**;
Without **rich dishes**, yet **satisfying**.
Those who merely **stuff themselves** seek only to **gratify the mouth**.

Thus it is said: *"The **five flavors dull the palate**."*

As for **hunting**—
The **Ancient Emperors** did so to **protect the people**, **eliminate harm**, and **encourage farming**.
Later generations, however, **chase beasts and birds**,
**Hunt and gallop**, making **hounds their sole pursuit**,
Burning fields, ravaging mountains,
Even slaughtering **innocent snakes, scorpions, and insects** without mercy.
Some **indulge in cruelty**, taking life as their livelihood,
Unmoved by guilt.
In the end, **Heaven’s retribution is swift**—
A moment’s recklessness brings **calamity**.

Moreover, when **galloping and hunting**, one **releases their violent nature**—
Their **body rages**, their **mind rages**.
Thus the **Highest Sage** warns: *"Hunting and galloping drive the mind to madness."*

Furthermore, **rare and strange treasures**—
The **Sage** does not **covet them with the eyes**,
Thus **refining customs** and **embellishing virtue**,
So all may live in **peace under Heaven**.
Later generations, however, **value the strange and bizarre**,
Devoting **half their lifeforce** to **acquiring wealth**,
Yet what they **covet, others covet too**—
This is how the **wind of plunder** grows ever fiercer.

The **Ancients said**:
*"An ordinary man bears no guilt,
Yet his **hidden greed** is his crime."*
Thus it is known:
**The deeper the hoarding, the greater the calamity**—
A truth not false.

Even if one **strengthens defenses** and **guards carefully**,
If **Heaven’s will** does not favor them,
**Destruction is inevitable**.

Life’s **essence and spirit** are precious—
Once **soul and body scatter**, where are the **treasures**?
Why not **prioritize the inner**, **discard the outer**?

Thus the **Highest Sage** warns:
*"Rare treasures obstruct conduct"*—
Urging the world with solemn care.

Therefore, the **high-minded Daoist**,
**Empties the mind** to **nourish the nature**,
**Fills the belly** to **establish life**,
Knowing that **Prenatal One Qi**—
When born, **flows in**; when dead, **flows out**—
Is the **unbreakable treasure of the body**.
With **one heart devoted** to this,
All external things become **like floating clouds**—
Thus **pure and enlightened**, unobstructed,
As if **receiving offerings from mortals**,
Or **ruling as Celestial Sovereign**—
Even now, their **ears and eyes** remain clear.

Ask: Do **Shun’s zither**, **Zhao’s jade**, **Qi’s lute**, or **Lu’s dwelling** still exist?
Long since **lost to obscurity**!

Thus it is known:
**Things are finite**, yet the **Dao is infinite**;
**Man is limited**, yet the **Dao is boundless**.
To seek **longevity**, one must **set aside the finite**,
Cultivate the **formless**—
Only then will they know what to **prioritize and discard**.

Alas—
Only those with **great insight and vision** can **reject the extraneous and take the essential**.

The **principle of self-cultivation** fundamentally opposes the **world’s ways**—
Know that what the **world desires**, the **Daoist abhors**.

The **world’s coveted** things are the **Daoist’s discarded**.
For **sound and color, wealth and gain**—
Though alluring and beneficial to the **physical form**,
They ultimately **profit not the heart**;
And when the **heart grows greedy**,
The **physical form itself falls into disharmony**.

Only the **cultivation of nature and life**—
Seemingly **formless and insubstantial**,
Not deemed worthy of the **body’s refinement**—
If one can **reject external temptations**,
**Fulfill their innate essence**,
**Focus wholeheartedly on inner refinement**,
**Seek nothing beyond**,
Then ultimately, **achievement and virtue are complete**,
And the **Dao of longevity** lies therein.
What treasure in the **world surpasses this**?

Yet I fear:
**Resolutions may falter**,
**Progress on the Dao may lack courage**,
**Desires and principles intertwined**,
**Heaven and man in constant conflict**,
Thus making it **difficult to attain perfection**.

I hope future scholars will first **quiet distractions and preserve sincerity**,
Then **refine lead and subdue mercury**,
And when they reach **returning to their original nature**,
**Embracing simplicity and returning to truth**,
What difficulty will there be in **joining the ranks of immortals**?

Thus, the **Sage cultivates the inner, not the outer**,
**Nourishes the belly, not the eyes**—
**Rejecting one and preserving the other**,
**Concentrating their will and focusing their spirit**,
**Standing firm in nature and establishing life**,
Is this not **far superior to worldly glory and wealth** by ten thousandfold?

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation as if Startled**

Honor and humiliation **as if startled**,
Treating great calamities **as one’s own body**.

What is meant by **"honor and humiliation as if startled"**?
Honor is **lowly**—
To **gain it** is **as if startled**,
To **lose it** is **as if startled**—
This is called **"honor and humiliation as if startled"**.

What is meant by **"treating great calamities as one’s own body"**?
My **great calamity** arises from **my having a body**—
When I **have no body**,
What **great calamity** shall I face?
Thus, **valuing the body as the world’s foundation**,
Is **as if one can entrust it to the world below**;
**Loving the body as the world’s foundation**,
Is **as if one can commit the world to it**.

Mencius said:
*"What must one guard? Guarding the body is paramount."*
The *Book of Songs* states:
*"Both bright and wise, to preserve one’s own body."*

How **heavily did the ancients weigh the body**?

This **body** sustains not only **one’s own nature and life**,
But within a **single household**,
None do not **rely on it for survival**.
Extending this further—
To **establish the heart for Heaven and Earth**,
To **grant life to all things**,
To **carry on the teachings of past sages**,
To **bring great peace to future generations**—
All is **governed by this body**.

Though this **body governs the cosmos**,
Only the **Dao masters it**.
The **Dao cannot stand alone in emptiness**,
It **must depend on a person to uphold it**.
Thus it is said:
*"If the body exists, the Dao exists; if the body perishes, the Dao perishes."*

The **great practitioner**, before the **Dao is fully realized**,
**Retreats from dust and worldly affairs**,
**Follows the paths of mountain and forest**,
**Conceals their light and nurtures obscurity**,
**Finds joy in the Dao and accepts poverty**,
**Hears no human voices**,
**Speaks not of worldly matters**,
**Treads not the red dust of the world**—
Is this merely to **avoid misfortune and preserve the body**?
It is also to **settle the body and establish life**.

When the **Perfect One** encounters **worldly honor and glory**,
Or **shame and disgrace**,
They regard them **as ordinary occurrences**,
**Not worth the slightest concern**.

Though **without cause**, arrows and banners descend upon them,
**Tributes and invitations arrive**,
**Emperors and ministers bestow extraordinary favors**,
And **humble dwellings shine with borrowed splendor**—
Those who **revel in wild delight**,
They alone **remain indifferent with increasing calm**.

Should **misfortune befall them**,
**Reputation and calamity** arriving swiftly,
**Slanderous mouths of the wicked** spreading,
**Families unjustly accused**—
They alone **do not shift blame to others**,
But **accept it upon themselves**.

The **ancient sages**, in **honor untainted by corruption**,
In **humiliation unbroken by despair**,
Had **good reason**.
All understood the **Dao of preserving the body**—
They did not **sustain the body with fame and wealth**,
But **refined their nature with benevolence and righteousness**,
Thus achieving **an immortal form unspoiled by time**,
**Reliable for all ages past and present**.

Should one **cling to the body**,
**Selfish and self-important**,
**Striving with others for name and gain**,
**Plotting for food and clothing**,
**Chasing worldly pursuits in frenzy**,
**Distracted and chaotic without rest**,
**Grappling and seizing without end**—
Then **misfortune will follow swiftly**.

Thus, the **gentleman values** **concealing their talents to await their time**,
**Settling the body to uphold virtue**.

The **Supreme Sage** sees that if people **cannot accept honor with reverence**,
**Preventing calamity in its unseen form**,
That is why there is the **lament**:
*"Honor and humiliation as if startled,
Treating great calamities as one’s own body."*

What is meant by **"honor as if startled"**?
Honor is **the glory of later attainment**,
Not the **inherent nobility of origin**—
Thus it is said: **"Honor is lowly."**

Yet **common human emotions** cling to **gain and loss**,
Thus to **gain it is as if startled**,
To **lose it is as if startled**—
This is **"honor and humiliation as if startled."**

What is meant by **"treating great calamities as one’s own body"**?
It means that **people suffer calamity because they have a body**.
If **there were no body**,
From where would **calamity arise**?

While the **Dao remains incomplete**,
One **cannot avoid retaining the body** as a **tool for cultivation**.
Once **the shell is shed and ascent is achieved**,
**Spirit exists yet qi is gone**—
What **misfortune** can befall them?

Though **they retain form and dwell in the world**,
**All attachments are extinguished**,
**One true essence is contained within**—
Even **roaming the four realms**,
They **come and go as they please**,
And what **great calamities** shall they face?

The **world’s cultivators**, who seek to **become gods of a thousand years**,
To **be the hope of a thousand people**,
To **achieve extraordinary deeds**,
To **establish eternal merit**—
Must **speak and act with utmost restraint**,
**Treating the body as precious**—
Only then can they **be entrusted with the world’s destiny**;
**Moving or resting with utmost care**,
**Never daring to be negligent**—
Only then can they **be loved by the world**,
And **rely on it for support**.

Like **Shen of the fields**, who **plowed for years in obscurity**,
Yet when **three marriage proposals came**,
He **expressed his sincerity**,
And **took responsibility for the people** as if **he were Yao or Shun**;
Or **like Rong of Nanyang**, who **lay high in seclusion**,
Yet when **invited repeatedly with gifts**,
He **stood tall as if he could divide the world into three**—
The **entrusting of a six-foot infant**,
The **committing of a hundred-li domain**—
Who but **such a person** could **fulfill this duty**?

「He who **hoards his own self** yet **stands aloof and distant**,
Does not **think to use the Dao/Way to benefit the world**,
Nor **lead all beneath the heavens to wander in the Great Dao/Way**—
The gap between them is vast indeed.

This speaks of a person whose **body inherently holds** great worth,
**Not needing external acquisition**,
Whose **virtue/power** surpasses even that of **worldly rank and honor**.
If one **strives to cultivate this** with unflagging effort—
As the ancients said, **"Toil for two or three years, and joy for ten thousand"**—
Truly, it is not false.
What **fears of favor or disgrace**, what **lamentations of affliction**,
Could ever **disturb such a person**?

When the **Dao/Way of scholars** is not yet attained,
They must **rely on this body** for **cultivation and refinement**.
If they merely **cling to clothing, food, wealth, and honor** as the **essentials for nurturing the body**,
Then **this mortal frame grows heavy**,
And the **innate, primordial True Body** will **surely suffer harm** from it.

Once the **innate, primordial True Body** is **damaged**,
Even the **later-acquired mortal frame** will **find it hard to endure long**.

This is how **ordinary people love their bodies** yet **ultimately lose them**.

Only the **Perfect Sage** understands that **all worldly affairs** are but **manifestations of illusion**,
With **birth and death**, **unable to be taken as true**.
Only **my innate, primordial True Qi** is the **source of my living body**,
**Enduring for one age**, **for a hundred ages**,
**For ten thousand years**.

If **this True Qi is not cultivated**,
How could the **mortal frame** ever **come to be**?
This is the **inner essence of a human body**—
**Preserve it, and life continues**; **lose it, and death ensues**.
**Scatter it, and it becomes matter**; **concentrate it, and it becomes an immortal**.
It must **never be separated**, not even for an instant.

The **Supreme Sage** teaches:
**"To act with utmost restraint and caution**,
**Never daring to neglect even the smallest matter**,
**Never wavering in the slightest thought**,
**Even less to vie with others in strength or victory**—
Only **serene contentment**, **natural ease**,
**Purity without dust or defilement**,
**To align oneself with one’s True Nature**."

Though **not yet emerging to benefit the people**,
The **multitudes of common folk** have **long since rejoiced in safety within his heart**.
How else could the **people survive** without such a one?
The **people’s longing and reverence** for him run **deep and sincere**.

**"To take no joy in one’s own joy**,
But **to take joy in the world’s joy**—
**To bear no sorrow in one’s own sorrow**,
But **to bear the world’s sorrow**—
What **entrustment and reliance** could be greater than this?**

**Chapter Fourteen: The Formless Form**
**Seeing it, yet unseen**—called **Yí (夷)**;
**Hearing it, yet unheard**—called **Xī (希)**;
**Seizing it, yet unattained**—called **Wēi (微)**.
These three cannot be **grasped or questioned**,
So they **merge into one**.

Its **uppermost reaches** are **not bright**,
Its **lowest depths** are **not obscure**—
**A continuous thread**, **unnamable**,
Yet **returning to nothingness**.

This is called the **Form of Formlessness**,
The **Form of the Formless**—
This is called **Huǎnghǔ (恍惚)**.
**Approach it, yet its head is unseen**;
**Follow it, yet its end is unmarked**.

**Holding to the Dao/Way of antiquity**,
To **govern the present with it**,
**Knowing the ancient origins**—
This is called **the framework of the Dao/Way**.

In general, **all affairs of the world** require **a guiding principle and thread**,
Only then can one **grasp the main points and hold the outline**,
**With order and no confusion**.
How much more so for **cultivating the Dao/Way**?

Moreover, the **source of the Great Dao/Way** is **True Unity’s Qi**;
**True Unity’s Qi** is the **root of the Great Dao/Way**.
What is **True Unity’s Qi**?
The *Book of Odes* says: **"The mandate of Heaven is vast and ceaseless, its solemnity unending."**
What is the **root and source of the Great Dao/Way**?
The *Book of Odes* says: **"The carriage of Heaven moves on without sound or scent."**
**Reason and Qi united** is the **Dao/Way**.

If a **cultivator recognizes this framework**,
And **discovers its beginnings**,
**Regulating emotions with principle**, **fixing nature with righteousness**,
**Taking the boundless, formless Qi as the foundation**—
Then the **Dao/Way of longevity** is **attained**.

If one **takes clarity and brightness, purity and lucidity** as **cultivation**,
I **fear the Dao/Way has no true essence**,
And all **effort is in vain**.

Thus the **Supreme Sage** describes the **innate, primordial Dao/Way**:
**"Seeing it, yet unseen—called Yí (夷);
Hearing it, yet unheard—called Xī (希);
Seizing it, yet unattained—called Wēi (微)."**

The **heart** communicates with the **eyes**—
The **eyes** harbor **spirit**.
The **kidneys** communicate with the **ears**—
The **ears** harbor **essence**.
The **spleen** communicates with the **four limbs**—
The **four limbs** belong to the **spleen**, the **spleen** to **Earth**,
**Earth** generates all things—
**True Qi** condenses here.
Thus **spirit and essence dwell here**.

If the **eyes see something**,
If the **ears hear something**,
If the **hands act**—
These are **later-acquired, tangible, colored, scented, and audible essence, spirit, and Qi**,
Only **able to manifest form**,
**Not able to manifest the Dao/Way**.

Only when **seeing nothing**—
Then the **innate, primordial Wood Nature** is **revealed**;
When **hearing nothing**—
Then the **innate, primordial Metal Emotion** is **revealed**;
When **seizing nothing**—
Then the **innate, primordial Earth Will** is **revealed**.

Thus it is said:
The **later-acquired Water, Fire, and Earth**—
**They give rise to form**;
The **innate, primordial Metal, Wood, and Earth**—
**They bring about immortality**.

The **Yí (夷), Xī (希), Wēi (微)**—
These are **profound, mysterious, and distant**,
**Beyond grasp or comprehension**—
There is **truly what cannot be exhausted or questioned**.

If one can **merge the Five Qi into One Qi**,
And **blend the Three Primordials into One Primordial**—
Then **True Primordial Qi** is **here**,
And **Heaven’s natural sovereignty** is **here as well**.

Thus the *Awakening to True Reality* says:
**"A maiden in green robes (Fire generates Water),
A scholar in white silk (Water generates Metal).
Seeing it, yet **unable to use it** (Later-acquired Water, Fire, Earth),
Using it, yet **unable to see it** (Innate, primordial Metal, Wood, Earth).
**Huǎnghǔ (恍惚)**—here they meet,
**Yǎomíng (杳冥)**—here **transformation occurs**.
In a flash, **Fire blazes forth**,
And the **Perfect Sage emerges**."**

If a **cultivator knows this**,
He **knows the source of the Great Dao/Way**,
And the **key to cultivating it**.

If one **does not know** that it **begins with the Void**,
But **fixates on the foul gas of this mortal corpse**,
**On impure and confused spirit**,
**On a generated, luminous mind**,
**On fabricated perception and reflection**—
I **fear that his reserves are not deep**,
And his **emergence will not be smooth or effortless**.

This is the **work of refining essence, Qi, and spirit**—
Thus it **never departs from the state of Hun Dun (混沌)**.

Once **Hun Dun (混沌)** is **achieved**,
With **time**, the **embryonic body grows**,
And the **Yang Spirit is born**—
Yet **the methods for nurturing the embryo and fostering the spirit** must **also be known**,
Which are the **principles of loving the people and governing the state without action**,
As taught in the **previous chapter**.»

「The **Yang Spirit** rises and falls, flowing naturally—
When it ascends to the heights, one does not know whence it came,
Thus it is not dazzling.
When it descends to the depths, one does not neglect its hidden source,
Thus it is not obscure.

From this, it extends endlessly and subtly,
Continuously and inextricably,
Indescribable in form,
Yet all things arise from this **Hun Dun (混沌)**—
The **Daoist** *Zhuangzi* says: *“Wash the heart and retreat to the hidden depths”*—
This is its essence!

Thus it returns to the **Void of No-Thing (无物)**.
Though No-Thing, yet the **ten thousand affairs and things of the world**,
All emerge from this **Void**.

The **Taoist Sage (太上)** speaks of the **formless Form (无状之状)**,
The **imageless Image (无象之象)**—
But what **Form** or **Image** is there indeed?
Only a fleeting glimpse in the **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**.

Truly **dim and indistinct (恍惚)**,
The **True Primordial Qi (真元)** is born.
If one **welcomes its opportunity and guides it (迎其机而导之)**,
It seems to arise from nowhere—**the beginning is unseen (前不见其首)**;
If one **follows its movement and draws it (随其气而引之)**,
It ends without trace—**the end is unseen (后不见其尾)**.

Such is the **vastness of the Dao (道之浩浩)**—
This is not the **great cycle of the mundane world (大周沙界)**,
Nor the **subtle penetration into the minutest things (毫芒)**,
But the **Dao itself (是道也)**—
What **Dao** is this?
It is the **Primordial Qi of Origin (元始一气)**,
The **true sovereign of the human body and its organs (人身官骸真宰)**.

To **obtain it** is to **live**,
To **lose it** is to **die**;
To **preserve it fully** is to **be human**,
To **neglect it** is to **be mere things**—
Its **manifestation is but a hair’s breadth apart**.

A **student of the Dao** who **attains this Primordial Qi (元始之气)**,
And **regulates and nurtures the five organs and hundred bones (调摄乎五官百骸)**,
Will have **luminous hair and skin, smooth and refined flesh**—
This is the **embodiment of ancient Dao (执古之道)**,
To **command the present (以御今之有)**.

If a **student of the Dao** can **recognize this Primordial Qi (元始一气)**—
The **origin of heaven and earth (开天辟地)**, before the **ancient times (太古)**—
And **hold it as the framework of one’s body (以为一身纲纪)**,
The **core of all affairs (万事主脑)**,
Then **one’s foundation is upright (体立)**, and **all else follows naturally (用自行)**,
**One’s root is pure (本正)**, and **the branches align (末自端)**.

If a **student of the Dao** does not **take this Primordial Qi (元始一气)** as the foundation,
And **seeks to cultivate awakened awareness (修正觉)**,
He **falls into false paths (反堕旁门)**—
This is truly **pitiable**!

To **grasp the Dao’s essence (状道之体)**,
A **student of the Dao** must **understand this body (会得此体)**.
For **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)** is the **source of innate life and death (先天性命之源)**,
Not to be compared with **postnatal essence, Qi, and spirit (后天精气神)**.

To **perceive the vital breath (命气)**,
One must **merge the innate True One (性真)** with it,
Only then will **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)** be attained.

Though this **Qi is formless and boundless (浑浑沦沦，浩浩荡荡)**,
Without **image or shape (虽无可象可形)**,
Yet all **images and shapes in the world (天下之有象有形者)**,
Emerge from this **formless and imageless (无形无象)**.
Truly the **pivotal foundation of the Dao (大道纪纲)**,
The **root of heaven, earth, and all beings (天地人物之根本)**.

The **Daoists** speak of **holding the center (守中)**,
The **Buddhist** speak of **contemplating emptiness (观空)**,
The **Confucians** speak of **cultivating solitude with caution (慎独)**—
All share the **same fundamental practice**.

To the **outer eye**, it seems **neither seen nor heard (无睹无闻)**,
Yet **within oneself**, it is **utterly clear (至虚至实，至无至有)**.
Thus **Zi Si (子思)** says:
*“Do not reveal what is hidden,
Do not display what is subtle.”*

The **scholar’s practice of solitude (君子慎独之功)** is **unceasing**.
In the **hidden, subtle, and secluded realm (隐微幽独之地)**,
Though there may be **what can be displayed or grasped (可显可据)**,
The **Dao’s root and source (大道根源)** is **only the most elusive and mysterious (希夷微妙)**—
**Indescribable yet described (无可状而状)**,
**Formless yet imaged (无可象而象)**,
**Exalted in its pristine unity (极其浑穆)**.

A **student of the Dao** must,
**Before Yang arises**, await it in **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**,
**When Yang is born**, welcome it in **dim and indistinct**,
**When Yang returns to the furnace and enters the cauldron (归炉入鼎)**,
**Preserve and nurture it in dim and indistinct**—
**Never awakening a great luminous mind (绝不起大明觉心)**),
Only then will one **constantly attain the Dao’s return (无时无处而不得大道归源)**.

Earlier, it was said that when the **Yang Spirit appears (阳神出现)**,
**Heaven and earth are illuminated (明天察地)**,
**He penetrates the mysterious and reaches the subtle (通玄达微)**,
And **upon enlightenment (及了悟之候)**,
The **radiant landscape (光明景界)** is **purely natural (纯任自然)**—
**Awareness seems as if it were not (有知若无知)**,
**Perception seems as if it were not (有觉若无觉)**—

**How much more so at the very beginning of practice?**
Can one not **kill the mundane heart (死人心)** to **generate the Daoist heart (生道心)** in **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**?

**Chapter Fifteen: Subtle and Mysterious Communication**
The **ancient masters who excelled in Daoist cultivation (古之善为士者)**,
Were **subtle and mysterious (微妙玄通)**,
**Deep beyond recognition (深不可识)**.

Because they were **beyond recognition (唯不可识)**,
They **forced a semblance of form (故强为之容)**:
**Serious (豫)**, as if **crossing a river in winter (若冬涉川)**;
**Cautious (犹)**, as if **fearing the four neighbors (若畏四邻)**;
**Solemn (俨)**, as if **a guest (若客)**;
**Dissipated (涣)**, as if **ice about to melt (若冰之将释)**;
**Unadorned (敦)**, as if **raw and simple (若朴)**;
**Vast (旷)**, as if **a valley (若谷)**;
**Turbulent (浑)**, as if **muddy waters (若浊)**.

Who can **clarify what is turbulent (浊以澄静)**?
Only **gradually (徐清)**.
Who can **establish what is tranquil (安以久动)**?
Only **gradually (徐生)**.

Those who **preserve the Dao (保此道者)** do not **seek fullness (不欲盈)**,
Thus they **remain unspoiled though worn (敝不新成)**.

The **Taoist Sage (太上)** spoke earlier of the **Dao’s essence (道体)**,
Now he speaks of **those who embody the Dao (体道之人)**.
**Man and the Dao** are **two as one (二而一)**—
The **Dao is invisible (无可见)**,
Yet **through man, it becomes visible (因人可见)**.

How can **man become immortal (人何能仙)**?
Through **the Dao (以道而仙)**.

What is the **Dao (道者何)**?
It is **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)**—
The **virtue/power (德)** of the *Zhongyong (中庸)*.

To **cultivate the Dao**, is there **any other way (岂有他哉)**?
**King Wen (文王)** was **dutiful and reverent (小心翼翼)**,
Serving the **Celestial Sovereign (上帝)** with clarity.
**Confucius (孔子)** was **modest and restrained (足缩缩)**,
As if **following a path (有循)**.

The **Dao as Dao** is **nothing more than reverence (不过一敬)**.
If **man can dwell in reverence (以敬居心)**,
With **no thought left unguarded (一念不苟)**,
And **no deed taken lightly (一事不轻)**,
Is not the **Dao itself (大道)** here?

Though the **Dao is not strange (无奇怪)**,
It **depends on those who embody it (尤赖有体道者)**—
Only then does the **Dao not hang empty in heaven and earth (不虚悬于天壤)**.

Thus the **Taoist Sage (太上)** says:
*“The ancient masters who excelled in Daoist cultivation (古之善为士者)**,
**Their actions were not dualistic (其为物不二)**,
Thus their **generation of things was beyond measure (生物不测)**.
How **subtle and mysterious (至微至妙)** is this Dao!

*“Stillness yet responsive (寂然不动，感而遂通)**—
How **profound and penetrating (至玄至通)** is this Dao!

It is **only their vastness of heart (心之浩浩)**,
And **their boundless Qi (气之洋洋)**—
Like the **depth of rivers and seas (不啻江河之深)**,
Making one **unfathomable (无从测识)**.

Thus the **Taoist Sage (太上)** says:
*“Because it is beyond recognition (夫惟不识)**,
They force a semblance of form (故强为之容)**.”*

To reveal the **inner truth** as unfathomable yet its outward form as something that can be shaped—
Its **mind ever-vigilant in solitude (心心慎独)**, in every place preserving sincerity (在在存诚),
Like **Yu’s crossing of the river**, waiting for ice to solidify before passage;
Or **like the night traveler**, awaiting still winds before proceeding—this is the utmost caution.

Its **orderly solemnity** is like a **guest of honor** arriving from afar, daring not to slacken;
Its **effortless liberation**, unburdened and unconstrained, is like **ice melting into water**, leaving no trace to follow;
Its **loyal and thick-hearted sincerity**, its **benevolent kindness toward all things**, is like **Taipu’s pristine wholeness**, untouched by carving, yet **perfectly seamless**;
Its **restful yet capacious demeanor**, its **humble self-restraint**,—what differs it from **deep mountains and hidden valleys**, empty yet boundless, vast yet all-embracing?

Such its form—its **nature is known**.
All this is **the Dao’s vastness borne in silence**, conforming to the **Heavenly Pattern** yet unrecognized.
It is as if **Shun dwelling in the deep mountains**, no different from the **wild men of the wilderness**.

Its **primordial and muddled mien**—how could the **dim-witted** ever emulate it?
Yet **muddled and turbid** are alike in name, **sage and commoner** share the same root—
The **commoner’s turbidity** is truly turbid;
The **Sage’s turbidity**, though muddled like turbidity, is in truth **utterly turbid yet utterly clear**.

Yet the Sage **does not claim sainthood**—this is how sainthood is attained;
The commoner **does not claim ordinariness**—yet remains truly ordinary.
Who can **clarify the mind’s defilements** and still them, awaiting their **prolonged stillness** until **pure light emerges**?
Who can **nurture the nature’s innate tranquility**, immersing and expanding it,
Until, through **long cultivation**, life **gradually unfolds**—
Harvesting it as **medicine**, refining it as **elixir**?
Is not the **Way of Preserving Life** found here?

This is **stillness to concentrate the spirit**, **movement to generate qi**—
It is **holding the Center**, it is **the Yang Life of the Child**.
From this **rising and descending**, gathering back into the furnace,
Gradually refining, gradually condensing—
All is **one undivided mind**, all **phenomena as empty**—
Preserving this **Yang** alone.

The more **substance**, the more **it heals**; the more **emptiness**, the more **emptiness**.
With **utterly empty mind**, without **fear of excess**,
Thus one can **return the One True Qi**, attain the **Eternal Dao**.

And what of *“The worn-out is not replaced”*?
For all **newly made things** decay swiftly—
Yet this **decays without decaying**.
Decay is its **manifest trace**; non-decay is its **spirit**.
One **True Essence** contained within, **ten thousand spirits** manifested without—
Its **subtle, mysterious, and profound penetration** is indeed as such.

This speaks of the **Dao-embodying sage’s** meticulous caution—
Though the **Dao is originally empty and void**, yet **Dao-masters** can **form without form**, **manifest without image**,
As if **inner and outer are perfectly unified**.

The seven clauses beginning with *“like”* (若) all **borrow phenomena to describe the Dao’s marvels**,
Revealing its **profound, unfathomable depths**.

*“Who can”* and the following sentences speak of those **unable to perfect virtue** yet seeking **entry into the Dao**.
Turbidity is hard to clarify—**stillness preserves the mind’s purity**;
Tranquility requires duration—**movement sharpens the spirit’s insight**.
Fullness invites loss—**thus one avoids excess**;
Novelty decays swiftly—**thus one avoids the newly made**.

I wish the **seeker** to be **empty yet capacious**, **unpolished yet genuine**,
**Primordially vast and unrestrained**, everywhere displaying **sincerity and integrity**—
Then **no heart will fail to transform into Dao-heart**, no **vulgar qi** will fail to become **True Qi**.

Do not, because the **depths are unfathomable**, hesitate and retreat!

**Chapter Sixteen: The Extremes of Emptiness and Sincere Stillness**

**Attain the utmost emptiness**, **guard the most sincere stillness**.
When **all things flourish together**, I observe their return.
For **all things, teeming and diverse**, each **returns to its root**.
Returning to the root is **stillness**; stillness is **restoring the Mandate**.
Restoring the Mandate is **constancy**; knowing constancy is **clarity**.
Ignorant of constancy, **reckless action brings ruin**.
Knowing constancy, **one is tolerant**—
Tolerance brings **impartiality**, impartiality brings **kingly virtue**,
Kingly virtue brings **Heaven**, Heaven brings **the Dao**,
The Dao brings **duration**—**lifelong without peril**.

If one seeks to **cultivate the Great Dao**, to **become a Golden Immortal**,
And **endure for countless eons without decay**,
From the **very first step**, one must not fail to grasp its **root**.

What is this **root**?
It is the **Mysterious Pass orifice**.

For **cultivating True Essence and refining the Dao** is not a single path—
How could the **Mysterious Pass’s marvels** exhaust its depths?
Heaven has **Heaven’s root**, things have **their stems**, humans have **their source**—
Never has one **without origin** achieved **great deeds** or **immortal feats**.

Observe **Heaven and Earth before their opening**—
Silent and void, without sound;
After their unfolding, **vast and boundless**.
Is this **unopened state** the **Heaven’s root**?
Vague and formless—**hardly the Heaven’s root**.
Is this **unfolded state** the **Heaven’s root**?
Ever-expanding and endless—**yet not the Heaven’s root**.
Then where is this **root**?
It lies in the **threshold of opening and not-yet-opening**.

Observe **humans and things before their birth**—
Faint and indistinct, without form;
After their nurturing, **prolific and boundless**.
Is this **unborn state** their **origin**?
Misty and shapeless—**hardly their origin**.
Is this **nurtured state** their **origin**?
Ever-changing and endless—**yet not their origin**.
Then where is this **origin**?
It too lies in the **threshold of birth and not-yet-born**.

How can one **cultivate the Great Dao** without knowing this **single orifice** and act in reckless confusion?

The **Taoist Sage** instructs those who **nurture the Dao and seek the Mysterious**:
*“Attain utmost emptiness, guard sincere stillness—I observe their return.”*
This clarifies that **cultivators must**—
**Discard superficiality**, **return to sincerity**,
**Concentrate the spirit in emptiness**, **nurture qi in stillness**—
At the **utmost emptiness**, in **sincere stillness**,
Naturally **all phenomena dissolve**, **One Truth is embraced**.

The *Classic of Change* thus says:
*"Does one see the **Heaven-Earth’s heart** at its return?"*

Master Zhao further expounds:
*"At the Winter Solstice, the half of the Child—
When the **Heavenly Root** reaches its utmost subtlety,
The first stir of **One Yang**—
The moment when all things begin to be born.
This is when **Heavenly Principle returns**, which the ancients likened to the **living Child hour**."*

It is also said:
*"When One Yang first emerges, the **dark and void** awaken in collision.*
This is the very **pivot** where all things return to their uprightness,
where **Heaven-Earth’s return** unfolds.
Here, the **Primordial Ancestor’s Original Qi** of the **Pre-Heaven** may truly be observed.

Yet its **mechanism is most subtle**, its **qi most swift**—
It is present now, gone in an instant.
Like **stone-fire and lightning**, it vanishes in a blink.

Observe the grasses and trees:
Though they flourish in **teeming forms**—
Branches and leaves, **radiant and patterned**, dazzling the eye—
None of these suffice as the **root of rebirth** or the **source of renewal**.
Only when **emergence turns to withdrawal**,
When **life transforms into death**,
When **roots gather fruit**,
Does each return to its origin—
Just as the **alchemical adept’s elixir head** does.

Returning to the root,
It is also **motion turning back to stillness**.
Once returned to stillness,
It once more **descends to bestow the noble seed**—
For things, this is **returning to their origin**;
For humans, this is **restoring the Mandate**.
It is no different matter.

Spring and autumn pass—**the old gives way to the new**;
Life and death alternate—**the blooming fades**.
Thus, the **adept’s way of restoring the Mandate**
Is but the **interplay of Heaven-Earth’s Two Qi**,
The **flow of One Qi**—
The most **even**, the most **ordinary** of **Ways**.

To know the **Constant Way** is to grasp the **Great Dao**.
From here, one’s practice advances—
Only then will it not stray.

Yet the **world’s errant paths**—
Ignorant of the **Dao’s roots**,
Unwilling to **purify the heart and clear the mind**,
To **return to origins and grasp the end**—
Some **refine the nature of perception**,
Some **cultivate the form and qi of life**,
Some **harvest seven metals and eight stones** as medicine,
Some **take young boys and girls** to forge the elixir—
With no foundation, where can the **Dao** be found?
Moreover, fixated on one extreme,
They stray into **perverse paths**—
And how many have **ruined their bodies and lost their lives**?
All this stems from **not knowing the Dao as the Constant Way**,
Thus **pursuing obscurities and performing wonders**,
**Treading dangers and inviting calamity**.

Only when one knows that **the Dao belongs to the True and Constant**—
That it is **inherent in all people**, **sufficient in all things**—
And does not **rejoice in knowing it** nor **marvel at possessing it**,
Like **water and fire to humanity**—
Freely taken and wielded at will—
**Resting in emptiness yet capacious**,
Viewing **self and other with equal breadth**,
Holding a **vastly impartial heart**—
Then one aligns with the **Sage-King**.
*"My people, my kin; all things, my companions."*
Standing with **Heaven-Earth’s extremes**,
Uniting with **all things in a single source**,
Unseparated—
Is this not **becoming One with Heaven**?

For **Heaven is the Dao**, the **Dao is Heaven**;
**Beyond Heaven, there is no Dao**; **beyond the Dao, there is no Heaven**.
Only **Heaven is supreme**; only the **Sage follows it**.
Only the **Dao is sovereign**; only **Heaven is its law**.

Thus, for humans: **birth and death**.
For the **Dao**: **eternal and unexhausted**.
Even **ascension and shell-shedding**—
There comes a time of **decay and annihilation**.
Yet though the **form perishes**, the **spirit does not perish**;
Though the **body is lost**, the **qi does not perish**.

As the *Odes* say:
*"The King Wen stands above—
Illuminating to Heaven."*
This is what is meant.

All this comes from **attaining utmost emptiness and sincere stillness**,
Then **observing the returning symbol**—
Only then can one be **fathomless**.

The scholar—**how dare they neglect the root and act recklessly, inviting misfortune?**

The **Most High** instructs on the **foundational practice**,
The **headwork of learning**.
Where one gains strength here,
There is strength everywhere.

If the scholar grasps this meaning,
They will **diligently uphold the Rule**,
**Unceasingly, like silk threads**—
From **non-being to being**, from **being to non-being**—
Even in a **single breath’s instant**, the **root of the Great Dao** is present;
In **a meal’s time**, the **Primordial Beginning** of the **Dao** is stored.
From this **single thread of subtle mechanism**,
If **gathered and refined**,
Gradually it **burgeons uncontrollably**—
All this is the **accumulation of One Yang**.

Though **mighty qi fills Heaven-Earth**,
Though the **Yang Spirit** pierces the **Big Dipper and Bull**—
What is it but the **piling of a single True Qi**?

The **student who lacks this True Qi**,
But only **refines the post-heavenal form and spirit**,
Is but **one hair of nine oxen**, **one grain of the sea**—
How dare they **compare with Heaven-Earth**?

Only by **walking this Way and becoming One with Heaven-Earth**
Does one achieve **unbreakable for billions of years**.
The **Dao-cultivator must take this seriously**—
**Seizing the moment without loss**.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Work Completed, the Body Fulfilled**

The **Most High**—
*Unknown to be known* (All other versions read *"The lowly knows what is known"*—
Yet this contradicts the **text’s intent**; it is a scribal error).

Next, they are **cherished and praised**;
Next, they are **feared**;
Next, they are **insulted**.
**Trust is insufficient**; **doubt arises**.
*"Ah, how cautious with words!"*
When the **work is complete and the matter fulfilled**,
The people all say, *"It was natural."*

(*The line "Ah, how cautious with words!" speaks of **ease and sincerity**, **solemn reverence in proclamation**.*)

---

**The Dao of the Most High in Cultivating the Body is the Dao of Governing the World—nothing more than the singular True.**

The True, when held within oneself, refines the self;
The True, when applied to all things, fulfills the world.
Though there be distinctions of inner and outer, self and others,
The True of this heart remains ever unchanging.

If one attains **至诚** without ceasing,
Then the people’s response to them shall also be unceasing.
If one attains **至诚** with interruption,
Then the world’s response to them shall also be interrupted.

For all share this heart, this heart shares this principle:
Cultivate the body, and the world naturally finds peace;
Lose the True, and the world must fall into chaos.

From the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** down to the present,
There has never been one who differed in this.

The Most High wishes people to cultivate themselves with **sincerity and trust**,
And thus governs them with **sincerity and trust**.
Without being seen, yet manifest;
Without acting, yet transforming;
Without doing, yet achieving.

To oneself, the Dao of governance is unknown;
To the people, it is felt through **ease and sincerity**,
**Solemn reverence in proclamation**,
And yet they do not perceive its transformation—
Nor know its origin.

This was the pure wind of antiquity;
I have long failed to see it again.

Thus the Most High says:
*"The Most High—unknown to be known."*
So that ruler and people alike rejoice in **光天化日** beneath the radiant heavens and earth.

If **sincerity and trust** were not deeply rooted,
How could such **divine transformation** exist?

The **restoring wind of the ancient emperors** has faded long ago,
The **Most High’s perfect governance** is unheard of today.
Thus the customs decline, the **Great Dao** grows distant,
And there are things too dire for words or witness.

If the ancient ways are not yet lost,
If the Dao still lingers,
If **天性** has not yet been obscured,
And **至诚** remains,
Then though not as profound as the **Most High’s** sincerity,
It is still the **light and splendor** of the present age.

All are ways of governance—
One without thought yet naturally transforming,
One with intent yet applying **仁**.

To cherish the people as one cherishes an infant,
To love the people as one loves family—
In such times, the **revered and long-lived** are honored,
And their words are answered as echoes.

Yet when **ease and sincerity** are not uniform,
**Virtue and transformation** cannot be equal.
Only through **cherishing and loving** them,
**Praising and rewarding** them,
Without adding **harsh words or punishments**,
Do they harbor **gratitude and fear**.

Though not reaching the Most High,
This still follows the Dao, the path—
Praiseworthy indeed,
As the saying goes: *"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there are仁 and義."*

Thus **Emperor降** became **Emperor**, and **Emperor** became **King**—
All were those who knew **virtue** and practiced the **Kingly Dao**.

Later, when the ancient customs grew distant,
The Great Dao more obscure,
**King**降 became **Conqueror**,
Using **仁 and義** as pretexts,
Each with their own heart, their own perception—
Far removed from the **single virtue** of the emperors and kings.

Thus though **rites and teachings** remain,
Though **laws and decrees** persist,
Though **institutions and prohibitions** are unchanged,
The **True** of their hearts differs greatly.

Only through **talent and brilliance** do they govern the world,
Relying on **laws and measures** to guide the people.
When their administration is fitting,
And their policies lawful,
The people fear them and dare not break laws or transgress rules—
This is the **clever ruler**, the **greatly peaceful age**.

And those below them—
Too dire to speak of.

They **trust in cunning** to drive the people,
They **indulge in deceit** to rule the masses,
With **狐狸** and **虎豹** hearts,
They enact **狐狸** and **虎豹**-like governance.

When they are **haughty and self-proclaimed**,
When they are **boastful and self-satisfied**,
There is none who does not think them wiser than the **Three Kings**,
Or more talented than the **Five Conquerors**—
Yet the people of this age,
In the end, **fearful and trembling** in their sleep,
Are truly **insulted and oppressed**.

Though the people dare not speak,
Their hearts are divided and estranged,
And thus there is no **unceasingly harmonious governance**—
Hence, disaster follows swiftly upon their heels.

Confucius said:
*"When the ruler values trust, the people will use their emotions."*
If trust is insufficient within oneself,
How can one expect trust from the people?

This is why ruler and people **deceive and trick each other**.

When **institutions, teachings, laws, and decrees** are issued,
Even the **Sage** does not abandon them—
Yet **emotion and falsity** are divided,
And **response and resonance** differ.

Only the **Emperor and King** set the example with their bodies,
**Trusting and inspiring** the people.
When laws are established, governance follows;
When words are spoken, the people believe.
Ultimately, their **light shines to the four quarters**,
Their **work is complete and their matter fulfilled**,
As **Yao** did in the **Age of Change and Prosperity**,
And **Shun** in his **self-cultivation and non-action**—
And the people all say, *"It was natural."*

Alas!
The reach of **true trust** is vast—
Compared to those who lack trust within,
The difference is as vast as heaven and earth.

**Dao and Virtue** are all-encompassing,
Refining the self here, governing the world here—
Extending to all things under heaven,
Nothing lies beyond this scope.

Thus the words *"Most High"* in this chapter
Refer to those of the highest rank,
Possessing the highest **quality**—
Hence, *"Most High."*

The **highest virtue** is **清净** and **无为**,
With the **六根** all settled.
Next, they **reverence and love**, transforming the people—
When moved, they respond.
Next, they **fear and awe**, ruling the world.
Next, they **guide the people with cunning**—
This is called **术**.

Yet the most wondrous of all is **trust**.
**Trust** belongs to **土**,
And its cultivation is **修炼始终**—
Its purest essence lies in **意土**.

Thus the Most High says:
*"Its essence is supremely true,
And within it lies trust"*—
This is the **elixir foundation**.

**Trust** is nothing else—
**至诚** alone.
If one attains **至诚** without ceasing,
Then the **elixir** is the **elixir** indeed.

Yet **trust** and **falsity** are nearly indistinguishable—
A moment’s thought leads to **sainthood**,
Neglect leads to **madness**.
The boundary between **man and beast**,
The threshold of **life and death**—
All that is contested lies in this **interval**.

I wish the **later scholars** to seek **true trust**,
For the **constant Dao** can be found therein.

Where is **trust**?
It is the **玄关** of a single aperture—
Do people truly know it?

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Abandoned**

The **Great Dao abandoned**,
There are **仁 and義**.
**智慧** arises,
There is **great deception**.
The **六亲** are not harmonious,
There are **孝 and慈**.
The state is **昏乱**,
There are **loyal ministers**.

I have observed the **Age of the Most High**—
Customs were **敦厚** and **朴实**,
People were **浑朴** and sincere,
Each **正其性**, **定其命**,
**安其俗**, **乐其业**—
Like things following **天** and moving,
Like nature acting as it will,
Without need of artifice or contrivance,
Not awaiting arrangement or command,
In accordance with **性**’s natural course—
And yet there were those who **did not know its origin**.

「Zhuangzi spoke of those bloated and labored in their exertions—
Their dull sincerity, weary toil,
Moving in accord with Heaven’s flow,
Rich with **true intent**.

This is why they fail to recognize or know,
Following the **Way**’s natural course.
What manner of transformation is this?
Naught but **浑浑沦沦**—
Unthinking, undisturbed,
Unified with the **Great Dao**.

Yet alas, the **royal winds** decline,
The **Great Dao** grows ever feebler.
Those in high station then speak of **仁 and義**,
Diligently toiling, none daring to stray.
To dwell in **義** while upholding **仁**,
Is indeed a praiseworthy deed of sages—
Not wholly to be condemned;
But compared to ancient times of flourishing **Dao**,
When hearts were **浑噩** and minds unspoiled,
Where **仁 and義** existed without need of speech—
The difference is vast.

Thus the **Most High** sighed:
*"The **Great Dao** abandoned, there are **仁 and義**."*

From this point on,
Both high and low covet **仁 and義**,
Yet those who claim them practice deceit,
Though **仁 and義** still appear,
Their actions have grown corrupt.
Is this because **仁 and義** are flawed?
Or because the **Dao** is pierced and hollowed,
And those ensnared by **仁**, enslaved by **義**, bring harm to it?

Still, they call it **仁 and義**,
Though not as pure as the **Great Dao**,
It has not yet fallen into **great deception**.

After this,
Customs grew ever more perverse,
Hearts grew ever more corrupted.
Even where **仁 and義** were taught,
Little remained—
For in the halls of court and the common folk,
Between ruler and subject,
All flaunted their **智** and paraded their **慧**,
Within their cliques,
Deceit and suspicion reigned supreme.
How could such a people hope to **harmonize the family** or **govern the state**?

Thus, sons and fathers grew estranged,
Brothers turned against one another,
Even husband and wife, friends and neighbors,
Relatives and townsfolk—
Each with their own heart,
Each with their own view,
As distant as **Hu and Yue**,
Let alone the rest!

If a son could show **孝**,
The court would single him out for praise;
If a father could show **慈**,
The village would acclaim him in unison.
Alas!
**孝** and **慈** were ever the **constant Dao** of Heaven and Earth,
The **proper path** of the family—
Why should they be so celebrated?

Yet when **三党六亲** were forgotten,
And **逆** winds grew fierce,
When **阋墙** strife was common,
Those who could show **孝** or **慈**,
Though few and far between,
Were held in great reverence,
And their deeds proclaimed to inspire the world.

How far this falls from the **Age of the Most High**,
When **孝** was natural and **慈** unspoken—
When even the **孝** and **慈** of today
Are but **反**—a forced return to harmony,
Where men now but **粉饰** and **铺张**,
Claiming **慈孝** while taking its name in vain—
How many such hypocrites could be counted?

And after the **五霸**,
When kin destroyed one another,
When lords and ministers exchanged hostages,
It is no wonder
That **昏庸** rulers arose above,
And **跋扈** ministers below—
And the state has known no peace since then.

Fortunate are those with **忠肝义胆**,
Who rise to **安邦定国**,
Though success or failure may not be foreseen,
Their **尽瘁鞠躬** loyalty is clear.
Yet their strength cannot turn back the tide of fate,
Nor their resolve preserve the whole of the world—
Like **Zhuge Liang**’s six campaigns at **Qishan**,
Or **Jiang Banyao**’s nine assaults on the **Central Plains**.

Consider the subject’s lot:
To serve a lord, they wish to be **良臣**,
Not **忠臣**.
If fortune favors the land,
They may share in **同襄补衮**’s duties—
Yet if **强梁** wars rise again,
Each must display their **济世** talents.
When the world is **昏乱**,
Heaven reveals the **忠臣**;
When **忠臣** arise,
Heaven sustains the **昏乱**.

Though **忠臣** may emerge,
Even if they could purge the **昏乱**,
And turn the land from **干戈** to **礼义**—
It would still pale in comparison
To the **Age of the Most High**,
When all was **无事** and distant from strife.
Alas!
The **忠臣** would rather **终身埋没**,
Than see their name proclaimed—
For one man’s **忠臣** title
Brings the world’s share of **昏乱** woes—
A sorrow too great to bear!

This is the **Most High**’s lament for the **Way** of the world,
His grief for the present, his thoughts for the past,
Desiring men return to **朴** and embrace **真**,
That high and low alike be **无知**—
Their **virtue** unbroken,
Their **Way** ever sufficient,
**熙熙皞皞**, all under Heaven at peace in **无事**,
Yet unaware of their own **Way**.

Even **仁**, **義**, **智**, **慧**,
**孝** sons, **忠** ministers—
All are seen as natural,
Unknown as virtues,
And to name them would be shameful—
What greater **浑朴** could there be?

Though this speaks of **治世**,
It applies no less to **修身**.
The opening line likens the **浑沦** customs,
Where **太朴** has yet to be carved,
To the **章贞** body,
Unadorned yet perfect in its **Dao**’s mystery.

If one loses their **本来之天**,
Then they must borrow from **先天阴阳** to restore it.
**阴阳** are but **仁 and義**—
As the saying goes:
*"The **Great Dao** abandoned, there are **仁 and義**."*

To discern the **真** messages within the body’s **内外**,
And to nurture with **智慧** as if plucked from emptiness—
Here, purity is lost,
And **后天**’s influences creep in,
So **伪妄** cannot be avoided.
This is the meaning of:
*"**智慧** arises, there is **great deception**."*

As for **采阴补阳**,
It is the means to **和** the **六根**’s discord,
And bring them to **大定**—
The metaphor of **孝 and慈**.

And **猛烹急炼**,
The way to **靖** the **昏乱** within oneself,
And ascend to **清明**—
The essence of **"loyal ministers"**.

Know this, and the **Dao** is near.
What deeper lesson does the **Most High** teach?
Naught but to follow one’s **浑然粹然** Heavenly nature—
And to cultivate it as such.»

Chapter Nineteen: *Few Private Affairs, Few Desires*

To discard **Dao/Way** and abandon **智**, the people’s benefit is a hundredfold;
To discard **仁** and abandon **義**, the people return to **孝** and **慈**.

To discard **巧** and abandon **利**, thieves and robbers vanish;
These three measures, though insufficient for **文**’s adornment,
Are thus established to ensure their proper application:
*"Seeing the unadorned, embracing the unadulterated,
Few private affairs, few desires,
Discarding learning, free from worry."*

Among all people and things under Heaven,
The wise and foolish, noble and humble—
None escape the fundamental principle of **理** and **氣**’s harmony.

Yet why do they remain divided and obstructed?
Why do passions clash and intentions stumble?
It is because those above lack what to inspire,
And those below lack what to transform them.

The **至聖** sovereigns of old
Followed the **Dao/Way** of nature,
Practiced the governance of **無為**,
Did not delight in deeds for the sake of achievements,
Nor weary of duties and abandon governance.

Though they possessed keen **聰明** and profound **睿智**,
They all entered the realm of **無為** governance,
The **清淨** domain of purity,
Where the people below, observing and transformed,
Naturally honored their own kin,
Nurtured their own offspring,
Stabilized their customs,
Found joy in their labors—
Without a single person failing to restore their **性**,
Without a single thing failing to fulfill its **生**,
Their benefit was indeed a hundredfold!

As for the **至仁** sovereigns,
Who naturally embrace **慈善**’s essence,
Who possess **恻隐** (*cìcè*) compassion—
They dedicate themselves entirely to benefiting others and nurturing all things.

**浩浩荡荡**, **浑浑沦沦**,
They neither speak of right and wrong,
Nor of crooked and straight,
But instead let Heaven move them,
And follow their **性** in action—
Naturally without favor or bias,
They return to the realm of **大中至正**—
The Great Centrality of Rectitude.

The people, inspired and transformed by this,
As sons naturally become **孝** to their parents,
As fathers naturally become **慈** to their children.
Even if there are those who are unfilial or unkind,
Whose habits become rampant,
They too will gradually be transformed—
How splendid and flourishing this is!

In later ages, the most **聰明** and **敏捷** sovereigns,
Though they govern the world and rule with skill,
Do not comprehend the **Dao/Way**’s foundation of **無為**,
And thus, if they follow it, it is easy;
If they oppose it, it becomes difficult.

Some delight in constant change and disturb the people,
Creating laws and regulations,
Only to bring calamity to the state,
Where the people barely survive.
Others love martial prowess and neglect governance,
Exhausting armies and waging wars,
Only to deplete the treasuries,
Where the people cannot endure—
No wonder then that the people grow impoverished,
The nation falls ill,
And the winds of **攘窃劫奪** (*rǎngqièjiéduó*)—theft and plunder—rise,
While thieves and robbers openly roam the land.
Such is the fate of those **至巧** sovereigns,
Who do not know to apply their **巧** to the **無為** of Heaven,
To the **自在** of nature—
Who seek to enrich the state through greed,
Only to weaken its strength,
And unsettle the people’s customs.

If they could achieve **至巧無巧**—
Expressing their hearts as they truly are,
Guiding the **勢** in harmony,
Upholding **義** without scheming for **利**,
Clarifying the **Dao/Way** without calculating **功**—
Then the **德** of the **君子** would be the wind,
And the **德** of the **小人** would be the grass—
Naturally flowing downward like water,
Or ascending like fire,
With an unstoppable force.

Would there still be among the people
Those who disregard **廉恥** (*liánchǐ*)—modesty and shame—
Who become thieves and robbers,
Who delight in wrongdoing?
None would.

This is the **大智若愚**—great wisdom as if foolishness—,
**大仁若忍**—great virtue as if forbearance—,
**大巧若拙**—great skill as if clumsiness—
Yet later generations view them as unfit to rule,
Unfit to govern.

However, the **聖德**’s pervasiveness,
The **仁恩**’s transformative power,
The **智巧**’s refined influence—
Though lacking in outward **文**’s adornment,
Their **實質**—substance—is indeed profound.

**理** and **欲** originally do not conspire,
Sufficiency in outward **文** breeds dissatisfaction within,
Reducing **文**’s excess enhances **實**’s abundance.

The **聖** discard **智**,
The **仁** discard **義**,
The **巧** discard **利**—
All to strengthen their **實**,
And to remove **文**’s excess.

Though the common people are **至愚**—utterly foolish—,
They always take the ruler’s actions as their guide for **去就**—departure and approach.

Thus, if one discards **華** (*huá*)—ornamentation—and upholds **實**,
It naturally unifies the **小民**’s hearts in the **本原**—origin—
And leaves them **不雕不琢**—uncarved, unpolished.

For what they see is governance of **質實無文**—substance without adornment—
And thus what they embrace
Is the **太朴不凿** (*tàipǔbùzáo*)—unpierced Great Simplicity—of truth.

In such **浑完** naturalness,
Clothing and food are each in their **常**—proper measure—
Interactions and exchanges
Follow their **分**—natural roles.

Though **氣禀** is limited,
And private desires may occasionally sprout,
They are few and sparse.

In summary,
**聖** and **仁** and **巧** are all **質**—substance—;
**智** and **義** and **利** are all **文**—adornment.

To discard **聖** and abandon **智**,
To discard **仁** and abandon **義**,
To discard **巧** and abandon **利**—
All ensure **文** is insufficient,
And **質** remains abundant,
Each with its proper application.

How could the people, nourished by **德** and quenched by **和**,
Fail to benefit endlessly,
To see **孝** and **慈** flourish daily,
And theft transformed into virtue?
This is the **隆盛** governance—
A sight I have long failed to behold.

This metaphor illustrates the **修養** path—
First, preserve the **心** and nurture the **性**;
When **心** and **性** return to nature,
Then the **後天**’s **精氣** also return to the **先天**’s **精氣**.

If one has not yet seen **性** and clarified **心**,
And merely relies on **後天**’s **氣質**—constitution—
And **知覺**—perception—of the **心** for use,
Then the **精** belongs to the **凡精**—ordinary essence—,
And the **氣** belongs to the **凡氣**—ordinary *qi*—,
How could one obtain the **真一**—true unity—of essence,
The **真一** of *qi* to forge the **丹**—elixir?

The practitioner must seek from the **本源**—original source—
A **大本領**—great fundamental principle—,
A **真頭腦**—true essence—
To serve as the master.
Then, **煉精** (*liànjīng*) refining essence,
**煉氣** (*liàngqì*) refining *qi*,
**煉神** (*liàngshén*) refining spirit—
All become manifest.

Understanding this meaning,
One not only comprehends the **《太上經》**—*Tàishàng Jīng* (Classic of the Most High)—,
But also grasps that governance and self-cultivation,
In every aspect, are a single thread—
And that the **四書五經**—Four Books and Five Classics—
Are none other than **丹經**—elixir scriptures.

Other commentaries state that those in high positions,
Discarding **聖** and **智**,
Cause the people to know only **利**—profit—,
And thus they flock to it a hundredfold;
Discarding **仁** and **義**,
The people do not know to love their kin,
And thus they turn away from **孝** and **慈**—
This is to discard what should not be discarded,
And the harm is as such.

When it comes to the contradictions of clever profit, sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness—
If one can discard and abandon them,
Then where would thieves and robbers arise?
This is what must be discarded and abandoned—
And such is its effect.

This teaching is truly **"high"** indeed.

The three levels below this state:
Governance of the people need not rely on decrees—
Only that commands must originate from what is rooted in one’s own practice.
To see the unadorned is to know constancy;
To embrace the uncarved is to preserve the spirit.
With few desires and little private gain,
This is what is meant by "having the world yet not partaking of it"—
How could one without excess and without action attain this?

**Chapter Twenty: Distinct from Others**

To abandon learning is to have no worries.
How far apart are **"yes"** and **"ah"**?
How far apart are **good** and **evil**?
What people fear, one must not fail to fear.

Ah, its boundlessness knows no end!

The masses rejoice, feasting as if at a grand sacrifice,
Ascending as if to the Spring Terrace—
Yet I alone remain tranquil, unmarked,
Like an infant yet unborn, still within the womb.
Buoyant and unrestrained,
As if having nowhere to return—
The masses all have abundance,
Yet I alone seem forsaken.

I alone possess the heart of the simple fool!
Muddled, while the vulgar are clear—
I alone am dim, while the vulgar are sharp.
Dull as the sea, unrestrained—
Like the wind, without end.

The masses all have purpose,
Yet I alone am clumsy and crude.
I alone differ from others,
Yet I cherish the Mother’s nourishment.

The Sage’s attainment is supreme—
Called **"Abandoning Learning"**—
Pure and vital, flowing and unrestrained,
Without care, without thought.

The *Odes* say:
*"The Most High watches over you—
Do not let your heart be divided."*

Thus, one acts in one’s natural station,
Unconcerned with poverty or wealth, gain or loss—
Nowhere does one not find self at ease,
And so it is said: **"No worries."**

This realm, compared to the unlearned and unskilled,
Is as distant as heaven from an abyss—
Yet the gap is not so vast.

Like an echo—
The same response—
Yet the direct **"yes"** and the flattering **"ah"** differ—
The response remains the same.
But the essence of the response—
How far apart can it truly be?

From ancient times, the division between Sage and commoner
Lies only in good and evil—
And the distinction between good and evil
Resides merely in reverence or insolence,
A contest of but a single thought—
How far apart can they be?

For the human heart is perilous,
And the **Dao**-heart is subtle—
A hair’s breadth of difference leads to a thousand-li error.
What people tremble to avoid,
How can I fail to fear what they fear?

Thus, from the very beginning,
One must gather the luminous spirit,
Returning it to the undifferentiated—
In motion or stillness,
Amidst change or constancy,
All as boundless as the primordial chaos,
Before Heaven and Earth were cleaved—
Vast and unrestrained,
As if the night had no end.

Thus, within there is a master,
And external things do not disturb.
When applied to governance and decrees,
The people naturally transform in joyous harmony.

To feed on the Sage’s virtue
Is to feast as at a grand sacrifice;
To dwell in the Sage’s domain
Is to ascend the Spring Terrace in delight.
How could this be compared to solitary cultivation in silent seclusion?

Thus, one’s merit fills the world yet knows no merit,
One’s actions fill the world yet knows no action.
The masses rejoice,
Yet I alone remain serene and undisturbed—
Faint as an unborn babe,
Still in the womb, a cluster of primordial *qi*,
Undifferentiated and whole—
Ascending and descending, flowing without end,
In harmony with Heaven and Earth,
Yet unaware of its destination.

While others act, I do not—
The masses have abundance to sustain them,
Yet I stand apart from the world, independent,
Far beyond what others can attain.

From their perspective, few would not call me foolish—
Yet when I reflect,
I only feel my heart cleansed, hidden in secrecy,
At peace with Heaven, content with my fate—
How could this be the heart of a fool?

It is merely that great wisdom appears as folly,
And great skill appears as clumsiness.

Otherwise, how could one bring such joy to labor and contentment to residence,
So swiftly transforming hearts and spirits?

This is because the **Great Polarity** remains a boundless unity—
Muddled as an unhatched egg,
No trace of yin or yang,
No knowledge at all.

The vulgar are clear in all things,
Yet I alone am dim, knowing nothing;
The vulgar are sharp in all things,
Yet I alone am confused, understanding nothing.

Am I truly muddled and unaware,
Confused and insensible?
Rather, it is to conceal one’s traces and dim one’s brilliance,
Nurturing clarity within profundity—
Day by day, month by month,
Refining the elixir through nine transformations,
Attaining the Sage’s virtue,
And becoming an immortal unchanging through the ages.

Its grandeur in transformation
Is like the obscurity of Heaven and Earth,
Encompassing all phenomena within thought.
Its subtlety and spirit
Are like flowing clouds and water without end,
Nurturing all life within.

From the outside, the masses all have purpose in the world,
Yet I alone am foolish and crude.
Within, the **Dao** is lofty and beautiful—
A Sage who transcends the crowd, stands alone,
And is unmatched by the world.
This is how I alone differ from others,
And why I am beyond what others can attain.

For the commoner is scattered in external pursuits,
Losing their original nature.
The Sage nurtures within,
Preserving their inherent essence.

The Sage differs from the commoner—
All because they return to the **Primordial** from the **Later-Heaven**.
For the **Later-Heaven** is **emotion**—child *qi*;
The **Primordial** is **nature**—mother *qi*.
Returning from emotion to nature,
It is as if the child clings to the mother,
Reluctant to part.
Thus it is said: **"Cherish the Mother’s nourishment."**

Mencius said: **"The Way of learning and inquiry is nothing else but seeking to restore one’s lost heart."**

The distinction between the Sage and the commoner lies in a single moment—
the Dao is not distant, is it?
The method is not complex, is it?
If one seeks to cultivate the Dao,
yet does not seek it in the **Primordial** and **Later-Heaven** interval where **qi** is pure and unmanifest,
where else should they exert their efforts?
Thus it is said:
**"The Mysterious Mother, the Mysterious Mother—
the true Mysterious Mother!
Not in the heart, nor in the kidneys.
Trace the origin of life and the reception of fate—
do not blame the **Heavenly Mechanism** for being fully drained!"**

What is the origin of life and the reception of fate?
Reflect upon this,
and the Dao is already half attained.

First, it is spoken of that the Sage transcends learning.
Having attained **constant joy** and **inner stillness**,
they bear no worries.
In daily life and practice,
all returns to the **Primordial Heaven** of **mixed chaos**.
Uncarved and unpolished,
unstained and unsoiled—
this is what is meant by:
**"Gazing upward, its heights are boundless,
making it impossible to measure—
truly beyond reach!"**
Yet though their cultivation reaches such extremes,
the true divide lies only in the distinction between **reverence** and **heedlessness**.

Can one fear its unfathomable depth
and still hesitate to proceed?
Yanzi said:
**"Who was Shun? Who am I?
Even those with deeds are such as this!"**
This is no falsehood.

Yet it is not the **empty foolishness** of idle learning,
nor the absence of worldly achievements.
The Sage attains **self-clarification of virtue** and **renews the people**,
enabling all living beings to **feast on virtue** and **drink harmony**,
to **play and frolic in the radiant Heaven beneath the sun and moon**.
What Dao is this?
The Dao of **utter sincerity** and **exhausting one’s inherent nature**—
the **nature of humanity** and the **nature of things**.

Ah!
To exhaust one’s nature to this extent—
what further learning is there?
It is but the **nourishment of the Mother’s qi**.

**Chapter 21: The Vessel of Confucian Virtue**

The **vessel of Confucian virtue** follows only the Dao.
The Dao, as a thing,
is **dim and indistinct**,
**indistinct and vague**.
Vague and indistinct—
yet within, there are **forms**.
Indistinct and dim—
yet within, there are **things**.
**Deep and dark**—
yet within, there is **essence**.
Its essence is most true—
yet within, there is **faith**.

From ancient times to now,
its name never fades—
it **pervades all beings**.

How do I know the state of all beings?
**By this.**
The **vessel of Confucian virtue** is the **Mysterious Pass** itself.
The ancients said:
**"The Mysterious Pass—one orifice—
unites Heaven and Earth.
Within it lies the **cavern of divine qi**,
named the **Kan-Li Essence**."**
And again:
**"The Mysterious Pass—one orifice—
the grand Dao’s gate.
Here, lead is transmuted, and cinnabar is forged."**
*The Classic of Changes_ says:
**"This law of the two orifices,
the gold-qi also follows."**
Hence, the Dao speaks of **"the Mysterious Mother’s Gate"**, the Confucian scholars of **"the Gate of Rightness and Principle"**, and the Buddhists of **"the Gate of Non-Duality"**.

In sum, all are the **vessel of Confucian virtue** that can contain:
Heaven, Earth, humanity, and all things—
all arise from within it.
It is neither **void** nor **non-void**,
nor **non-Dao**—
**void and Dao are one**.
Void and Dao are inseparable.
Without void, there is no Dao;
without Dao, there is no void.
Thus it is said:
**"It follows only the Dao."**
If one seeks the Dao,
and abandons this **void vessel**—
where else should they go?

But if one remains in mere **voidness without form**,
it is **empty foolishness**—
how then can the scholar gather **medicinal herbs** or forge **cinnabar**?
They must **hold emptiness while encompassing utter reality**,
**be void yet contain all things**—
only then does it not become a **one-sided learning**.

The practitioner, having cast aside all **ten thousand entanglements**,
nurtures stillness for a moment,
and **observes this orifice**—
vague as if without substance,
indistinct as if with form.
In the **depth of emptiness and sincerity of stillness**,
the **divine mechanism** moves—
the **formless bears form**.

This is the **radiance of the Primordial** within,
the **flux of wood and fire**’s **forms**—
the **awakening of the subtle yang** in its time.

Again, with this **divine light’s momentary movement**,
one **contains the radiance of the eyes** and gazes downward—
vague as if aware,
indistinct as if without knowledge—
within, the **yang substance** stirs—
this is the **Primordial radiance** first intersecting with the **Kan Palace**.

At that time, the **qi mechanism** is weak,
unable to be gathered—
only the **two methods** of **adjusting and gathering the Buddha’s law**,
and **refining the lurking yin-qi**,
can meet within the **qi cavern**.
**Adjusting and gathering** is one method,
**returning to the furnace for nourishment** is another.

Following the law in practice,
without pause—
**fire enters the water’s depths**,
**gold is born within the water**,
**obscure and dark**—
one knows not its limits—
this is when the **divine qi** intersects,
and the **Kan-Li Essence** is generated.

Yet when the **true essence** is born,
the body stands as if **erect against a wall**,
the mind is like **cold ashes**—
naturally, the whole body feels **softened and joyous**,
the **precise qi** of limbs and organs
all return to the **Mysterious Orifice**.
Within, there is great **faith**—
**melting like ice**, **vast like tides rising**.

This is not like before,
when it was **vague as if with awareness**,
**indistinct as if without knowledge**—
unnameable.
This **true essence** is indeed the **true One Essence**,
not the **Later-Heaven**’s **intercourse-generated essence**—
it cannot be compared.
It is also the **original essence** of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and all things—
the **common true essence** from which all arise.

Like the **yang at Winter Solstice**,
or the **child at midnight**—
the **achievement of a year in one day**,
though not limited to this,
the **qi mechanism** must all begin here.
Just as the **thousand-layered terrace** begins with **piling earth**,
or the **ten-thousand-li journey** begins with **the first step**—
this is the **root of Heaven, Earth, and humanity’s** **eternal generation**.
If the **root differs**, the **endless branches**—
what limits are there?

Hence, from ancient times to now,
all who cultivate the Dao
never depart from this **gathering of true qi**—
only then does the **symbol of generation** appear.
All things in their **initial arising**,
share this **one true essence**—
forming **symbols** and **bodies**.
How do I know all things share this essence?
**By this:**
Within the **void orifice**,
the **true qi** accumulates—
with time, the **Mysterious Pass opens**,
and the **true essence** is born.

In essence,
**vague** is the **dense radiance**,
**indistinct** is the **subtle mechanism**.
The **Primordial yin** within—
this is the **substance** of **vague and indistinct**.

「坎中真阳，是为杳冥中之精。
Within the **Kan abyss**, the **true yang**—this is the **elusive and profound essence**.

学者必知之真，而后行之至也。
One must first know the **true**,
then practice it to its utmost.

此恍兮惚是性光发越，故云“有象”；
This **vague** and **indistinct**—
its **innate luminous virtue** ascends beyond,
thus it is said to have **"symbols"**.

惚兮恍是以性光下照坎宫，而真阳发动，故云“有物”。
This **indistinct** and **vague**—
its **innate luminous virtue** descends to illuminate the **Kan Palace**,
and the **true yang** stirs into motion,
thus it is said to have **"bodies"**.

窈冥之精，乃二五之精，故云甚真。
The **elusive and profound essence**—
this is the **Five Phases’ true essence**,
thus it is called **most true**.

欲得真精，须知真信。
To obtain the **true essence**,
one must first grasp **true faith**.

真信者，阴阳迭运，不失其候之调，俟其信之初至，的当不易，即行擒伏之功得矣。
**True faith**—
when **yin** and **yang** alternate in their courses,
one does not fail to observe their proper **signs and rhythms**.
Awaiting the **true essence**’s first arrival,
seize it firmly without hesitation,
and the **capturing and subduing** practice is achieved.

凡人修炼之初，必要恍惚杳冥，而后人欲净尽，天理常存，凡息自停，真息乃见。
At the outset of cultivation,
all must pass through **vague and indistinct, elusive and profound**—
then the **human desires** are purified and exhausted,
while **Heavenly principle** remains constant.
The **ordinary breaths** cease naturally,
and the **true breath** emerges.

此何以故？
Why is this so?

盖人心太明，知觉易生。
It is because the **human heart** is too bright,
and **awareness** arises easily.

若到杳冥，知觉不起，即元性元命，打成一片。
Yet when one reaches **elusive and profound**,
**awareness** does not stir—
then **original nature** and **original life** merge as one.

此个恍惚杳冥，大为修士之要。
This **vague and indistinct, elusive and profound**—
it is the **most vital** for the cultivator.

学人当静定之时，忽然偶生知觉，此时神气凝聚丹田，浑然精然，自亦不知其所之，此性命返还于无极之天也。
When the **student** sits in **stillness and calm**,
suddenly **awareness** arises,
at which point **spirit-qi** condenses in the **Elixir Field**,
pure and undivided—
one does not even know where it goes.
This is when **nature and life** return to the **limitless Heaven**.

虽然外有是理，而丹田中必有融和气机，方为实据。
Though externally this **principle** exists,
within the **Elixir Field**, there must be **harmonized qi-machinery**,
only then is it **true foundation**.

由此一点融和，采之归炉，封固温养，自能发为真阳一气。
From this **single point of harmonization**,
gather it and return it to the **Furnace**,
seal it firmly and nurture it warmly—
it will naturally **emanate as true yang qi**.

但行功到此，大有危险。
Yet when one’s practice reaches this point,
**great danger** looms.

惟有一心内守，了照当中，方能团结为丹药，可以长生不老。
Only by **single-heartedly guarding internally**,
and **illuminatingly penetrating the center**,
can one **congeal it into elixir**, achieving **longevity and immortality**.

若生一它念，此个元气，即已杂后天而不纯矣。
If one **harbors another thought**,
this **original qi** will be **mingled with postnatal influences** and become impure.

若动一淫思，此个气机即驰于外，而真精从此泄漏矣。
If one **stirs even one lustful thought**,
this **qi-machinery** will **bolt outward**,
and the **true essence** will **leak away** from here.

古人云：泄精一事，不必夫妻交媾，即此一念之动，真精已不守舍，如走丹一般。
The ancients said:
**"Leaking essence"**—
it need not involve **husband-wife copulation**;
even the stir of **one thought**,
and the **true essence** no longer **resides in its home**,
like **fugitive cinnabar** in flight.

学人必心与气合，息与神交，常在此腔子里，久之，自有无穷趣味生来。
The **student** must **unite heart and qi**,
**intermingle breath and spirit**,
ever abiding in this **chamber**—
with time, **endless joys** will naturally arise.

然而真难事也；
Yet truly, this is **no easy matter**.

设能识透玄机，亦无难事。」
If one can **penetrate and discern the profound mechanism**,
then there is **no difficulty**.

At first, one merely employs the method of **lifting and gathering**—
this **true qi** must not **bolt downward**,
nor must it **scatter through the six orifices**.
It is all about **one-heartedly returning to the command**,
**five-bodied sincerity**.

With time, the **essence will naturally fill**—
no longer craving **color**.

I wish the **student** would **preserve the original essence**,
**not allowing even a drop to leak**.

At first, **constant practice along the familiar Dao** seems difficult;
but if one **endures again and again**,
**not permitting even a thought to stir**,
within **three months**, the **external yang will naturally withdraw**.

When the **external yang is withdrawn**,
then one perceives the **original qi** within the body **abundant**—
and thus the **immortal, ageless sage** is attained.
What is **sagehood**, if it is so distant?

**Chapter Twenty-Two: "Complete and Return"**
*"Crooked, yet whole;
Bent, yet straight;
Hollow, yet full;
Worn, yet renewed;
Few, yet gain;
Many, yet confused."*

Thus the **Sage** embraces **Oneness** as the model for the world.
Not seeing oneself, yet **clear**;
Not asserting oneself, yet **illuminated**;
Not boasting of oneself, yet **accomplished**;
Not vaunting oneself, yet **enduring**.

Only because one **does not contend**,
the world cannot contend with them.

What the ancients called **"crooked, yet whole"**—
was it empty speech?
**Truly, it is complete and returned.**

The **essence of the Great Dao** must **reach the void while containing the full**;
**reverse the full to realize the void**—
only then is it the **Dao of dual cultivation of nature and life**.

For **nature is originally void**—
void arising from the full;
**life is truly full**—
full arising from the void.

If one **fixes on emptiness**, it becomes **stubborn voidness**;
if one **fixes on the full**, it becomes **entangled in names and forms**.
Even if it does not **degenerate into absurd, unorthodox claims**,
it is still **one-sided learning**—
in the end, it cannot equal the **Great Dao**.

The **practitioner** must first **lay down all entanglements**,
**free from even a speck of dust**,
and within **absolute nothingness**,
**seek out a spark of vitality** to serve as the **elixir’s foundation**.
The ancients called this **true yang**,
or **true lead**,
or **the true One-qi**.

The **Taoist Canon** says *"crooked, yet whole"*—
meaning within the **hidden recesses of the body**,
in the **solitary knowing and solitary awareness**,
there exists a **wholly undivided, lively, and flowing mechanism**.
By **nurturing and refining** this,
one can attain **elixir completion and sagehood**.

The ancients likened it to the **slightest line of yang at Winter Solstice**,
which **generates endlessly**.
Or the **slim crescent of the new moon on the third day**,
gradually waxing to the **full moon on the fifteenth**—
all are expressions of **"crooked, yet whole."**

For **crooked is hidden**—
in the **subtle depths**, its **mechanism is subtle**,
yet its **fulfillment is vast**.
As the *Zhongyong* says: *"Crooked can possess"*—
truly so.

Within this **single crook**,
there is nothing but the **origin of principle and qi**;
within this **whole body**,
it is the **essence of the Great Ultimate**—
thus, *"crooked, yet whole."*

The **Sage** found this crook,
**diligently and cautiously**,
**cycling and embracing**, like a hen brooding,
like a dragon guarding its pearl—
**one-heartedly guarding within**, not allowing it to **leak outward**.

With time, it **swells like the tide**,
**rising and stretching upward**,
a **single current of clear, rigid qi**,
**boldly ascending** beyond sun and moon,
**encompassing** heaven and earth.

The *Kun* hexagram says:
*"Kun is supremely yielding, yet in movement, it is rigid"*—
all from the **aftermath of bending**,
**hidden in the earthen vessel**,
**accumulating until it overflows the heavens**,
**bursting forth uncontrollably**—
such is its nature.

Moreover, **bent becomes yin, becomes yielding**—
this is the same qi;
**straight becomes yang, becomes rigid**—
also this same qi.
Though it is said *"from bent to straight"*, in truth,
**it is both bent and straight**.

After **piercing the source from within the hidden crook**,
its **manifestation becomes easy**,
but **guarding it is difficult**.

Only by **resting in ease, drifting in play**,
**nurturing its subtle traces**,
**lowering oneself to serve others**,
**humbling oneself in self-regard**,
can one **avoid the nature of haste and violence**,
**not generate deluded views**,
**not stir the vulgar fire**—
only then can **golden elixir** be formed.

Thus, **spirit governs qi**,
**qi unites with spirit**,
**hidden and revealed without trace**,
**transformation beyond measure**—
**"utter sincerity without pause**,
**embodying things without omission**,
**present everywhere yet nowhere"**—
how **full** it is!

Yet one must **be humble to receive benefit**,
**hollow to become full**.
Otherwise, how could one **embrace all things**?

Much less this **subtle crook**—
all originally **our own substance**—
what is called **"worn"**—
**worn is the old**.

As the *Zhongyong* says: *"Temper the old to know the new."*
The **student** who seeks **new growth to generate new ideas**,
if not by **nurturing this old substance**,
how could they **know the new**?
This is also **"worn, yet renewed."**

Though **wornness is scarce**,
if one **nurtures it from its fewness**,
the **vast qi** can **fill heaven and earth**, **pierce the Horns of the Bull**.
If one claims the **Dao is vast, encompassing all**,
and **takes from its abundance**,
I fear **desire and principle will be mixed**,
**good and evil indistinguishable**—
sometimes **holding to the middle**,
sometimes **gathering herbs**,
sometimes **advancing fire, withdrawing talismans**,
**fixating on forms, grasping names**—
the more, the better—
yet it remains **rootless learning**,
**unable to return to stillness**,
ultimately a **tangled knot**.

No wonder one **spends a lifetime in doubt, yet never awakens**.

The **Sage** cultivates **Oneness** for themselves,
and applies it to the world,
as a **model for all**.
If one does not know that the **Dao of the crook** is truly the **unifying Dao**,
and **occasionally strays**—
**once strayed, there is no model**,
**no model, no attainment**—
what reliance is there on the **Dao**?

The **Dao is originally the unified principle of heaven and humanity**,
**all things and self**—
a **common substance**.
Yet today’s scholars **each cling to their own views**,
claiming none surpass them—
this **arrogant pride** alone
already **obscures the luminous clarity**,
while they fail to **measure the ancient against the present**,
**take the superior as their standard**.

The *Zhongyong* says:
*"The Dao of the **Noble** shines **dimly yet clearly**;
the Dao of the **petty** shines **brightly yet perishes."*

「Indeed, the **Dao of the sincere cultivator** is something to be held with **solemn reverence**. Even if one approaches the **transformation into the divine** (*shénhuà*),
it is merely what one ought to do and what one ought to fulfill—
why must one **boast to the world** and **exaggerate one’s merits**?
If one **praises oneself**,
not only will one be **despised by others**,
but the **merits themselves will be false and not true**.

The ancients, having attained their **merits**, withdrew humbly—
they **never claimed credit** for their deeds,
**truly covering the world with their virtue** and becoming **teachers for all ages**.
As for **self-cultivation and self-forging** (*zìxiū zìliàn*),
it is like **clothing that brings warmth** or **food that satiates hunger**—
all are **self-acquired joys**,
and yet, they are **what others also possess and find sufficient**.
Why must one **swagger with arrogance** and **pretend to be great**,
**boasting of one’s strengths**?
Though it is said that **wisdom grows daily** and **cleverness expands each day**,
this is merely **what all humans share**—
I have simply **attained it first**;
where is the **true length** of it?

If one **boasts of one’s strengths**,
then one’s **strengths will become weaknesses**.
Even the most **foolish of men**—
who would willingly **lag behind**?
Where do **disputes** not begin from here?
The **Noble** has **no place for contention**,
so the world cannot **contend with their power**.
The ancients spoke of **"crook/turning brings completeness"** (*qǔ zé quán*)—
truly, this is not **empty talk**,
but refers to **one who fully receives and fully returns** the **Dao**?
This is the **unifying Dao** (*Zhōngyōng*), or next, the **Dao of the crook/turning** (*qǔ*), which can **sincerely embody the Dao**.
The **crook/turning** is the **hidden crook** (*yǐnqǔ*), the **Dao** calls it **"mysterious orifice"** (*Xuánqiào*),
the **Buddha** names it **"that"** (*nàge*),
and the **Confucian** refers to it as **"the origin and traces"** (*duānní*).
Yet it is **not empty nor without substance**—
a **single point** from which **all things and beings** arise.

When **heaven and earth opened** (*kāipì*) and **figures began to emerge** (*wùrén shǐshēng*),
all originated from this **one point**,
and its **movement and stillness** are visible at all times.
When it **stays still and begins to manifest**,
it does not arise from **external stimulation**.
Suddenly **awakened**,
this **awakening itself is the crook/turning** (*qǔ*).
When it **moves and displays its form**,
it arises from **spontaneous resonance** (*gǎnfú*).
Suddenly **stirred**,
this **stirring itself is the crook/turning**.

Essentially, it is when one is **in ignorance and unawareness**,
and the **qi-mechanism** (*qìjī*) moves **spontaneously**—
**moving and suddenly awakening**—
this is **true movement and true awakening**.
But its **mechanism is extremely subtle**,
its **timing swiftest**—
a **mere shift in thought** or **change in breath**,
and it already belongs to **postnatal cultivation** (*hòutiān*),
**unable to serve as the root of life** for all things and beings,
**nor as the foundation for refining the elixir** (*liàn dān*).
Humans receive **qi** and form **bodies** (*chéngxíng*),
become **people and things** (*wùrén*),
all from this **single thought** (*yī niàn*) that **branches into myriad forms** (*fēn tāi*).
The **right and wrong paths of cultivation** (*xiédào*),
the **true and false nature of the Dao**—
which does not originate from this **single thought**?

The *Zhōushū* says:
*"**Erroneous thoughts lead to madness** (*wàng niàn zuò kuáng*),
**overcoming thoughts leads to sainthood** (*kè niàn zuò shèng*)."*
The **difference between sainthood and madness** lies in **a single thought**—
so swift, so decisive!
This is what **"crook/turning"** (*qǔ*) truly means.
The ancients likened it to **a flash of lightning or a spark of stone fire** (*diàn guāng shíhuǒ*),
or **a steed galloping a thousand li without leaving dust** (*qiān lǐ jì zú*).
At this moment, one must have **a bright pearl of wisdom** (*zhìzhū lǎngzhào*),
only then can one **recognize it clearly**.

Having **grasped this origin and trace** (*duānní*),
one must still **nurture and expand** it—
as **Mencius** said:
*"Fire just begins to burn*,
*the spring just begins to flow*—
**vast and blazing** (*hào hào yán yán*),
**naturally filling heaven and earth** (*tiān dì*)."*
Yet the **way of nurturing and expansion**—
is there truly another?
If one **does not bend and humble oneself** (*wǎng qū zìchí*),
then one’s **true qi cannot stretch** (*zhèngqì bù néng chángshēn*).
If one **does not lower and abase oneself** (*bēi wā zìxià*),
then one’s **heavenly virtue cannot be complete** (*tiāndé bù néng chángyuán*).
Only by **guarding the original substance within oneself and all things** (*shǒu wú shēn*),
**not engaging nor separating** (*bù cān bù èr*),
**warming the old** (*wēn qí gù*),
**embracing the one** (*bào yī qí*),
**not seeking novelty in new ends** (*bù qiú zhī yú xīn yīng zhī duān*),
**nor indulging in the proliferation of names and forms** (*bù chǐ zhī yú míng xiàng zhī fán*),
can one **avoid becoming more confused with each day of learning**,
and instead **find joy in the ceaseless renewal** (*rìxīn yòu xīn*).

The **ancient sages** knew that the **crook/turning** (*qǔ*) is the **stage for attaining immortality and sainthood** (*chéngxiān zhèngshèng*),
so they **embraced the divine and relied on qi** (*shén bào qì*),
**qi followed the divine and divine-qi merged as one without separation** (*qì yī shén, shén qì hé yī bù lí*),
as the **essence of self-cultivation** (*zìxiū zhī yào*),
and as the **model for all under heaven** (*tiānxià zhī shì*).
If one **only sees oneself and insists on one’s own views** (*zì jiàn zì shì*),
then one **obscures the luminous clarity** (*mèi qí míng ér bù zhāng*),
let alone **praises oneself and claims credit** (*zì fǎ ér bù zhēn*),
**boasts of strengths and ignores weaknesses** (*zì jīn ér duǎn ér bù cháng*).
**Wisdom arising from emotions** (*zhì qǐ qíng shēng*)
often **becomes the Dao’s greatest harm**.
Only by **not seeing oneself nor insisting on one’s own views**,
**not praising oneself nor boasting of strengths**,
can one’s **mind be level and qi harmonious** (*xīn píng qì hé*),
**naturally avoiding evil in others** (*bìmǐ wū è*),
**and corruption in oneself** (*cǐlǐ wú cuì*),
so who could **contend with them**?

The **Dao’s subtle and silent influence** (*qián yí mòqì*) is such—
unless one **embraces the one** (*bào yī*) and **fully receives and fully returns** the **Dao** (*quán shòu quán guī*),
how can one **return to the primal origin** (*fǎn qí tàishǐ zhī chū*)?

**Chapter 23: Rare Words, Naturalness**
Rare words, naturalness.
Thus, **gusts of wind do not last all morning**,
**sudden rains do not last all day**.
Who is responsible for this?
**Heaven and earth**.
Even **heaven and earth cannot endure long**,
let alone **humans**?
Therefore, those who **pursue the Dao**:
—**those who align with the Dao** (*tóng yú dào zhě*) are **in harmony with the Dao** (*dào yě lè dé zhī*),
—**those who align with virtue** (*tóng yú dé zhě*) are **in harmony with virtue** (*dé yě lè dé zhī*),
—**those who align with loss** (*tóng yú shī zhě*) are **in harmony with loss** (*shī yě lè dé zhī*).
**Truly, there is no joy in being unaligned** (*xìn bùzú yān, yǒu bùxìn yān*).
The **Dao originally has no sound nor breath** (*wú shēng wú xī*),
so it is called **"rare words"** (*xī yán*).
The **Dao originally has no action nor doing** (*wú wéi wú zuò*),
so it is called **"naturalness"** (*zìrán*).

What **things can endure** and **affairs can last**?
None but those that **follow heaven’s movement** (*shùn tiān ér dòng*),
**act in accordance with their nature** (*shuài xìng yǐ xíng*),
and **listen to the qi-mechanism’s spontaneous operation** (*yī tīng qìjī zhī zìyùn*).
If one **forces and contrives** (*jiǎo niǔ zào zuò*),
**unable to follow the qi-mechanism** (*bù néng shùn qí jī*),
and **cannot conform to the revolutions of heaven and earth** (*hé yīn qián kūn zhī yùn zhuǎn*),
the **rising and setting of the sun and moon** (*rìyuè zhī shēng héng*),
then one’s **efforts will be like fleeting winds over boiling water** (*piāo táng zhī fēng*),
**violent rains** (*kuáng bào zhī yǔ*),
**uprooting great trees** (*bó dà mù*),
**flooding flat plains** (*yǒng píng chuān*),
**coming swiftly and departing swiftly**—
their **force could not possibly last all day or all morning**!

Yet who is responsible for this?
Ask **heaven and earth**, and they **do not know**.
**Heaven and earth** are the **masters of all things** (*wànwù zhī zhǔzǎi*),
yet even they **cannot endure long** if they **do not follow their natural ways** (*bù shùn qí cháng*).
How much more so for **humans**, who are **like a single grain in the great granary** (*tài cāng yī sù*)?
Who could **endure long** by **not following the Dao of constancy**?

Thus, the **Greatest Sage** (*Tàishàng*) spoke of the **source of the Dao**,
**taking non-action as its core** (*wúwéi wéi zōng*),
and **naturalness as its application** (*zìrán wéi yòng*).
If one **does not pursue this**,
but instead **boasts of shortcuts** (*qiā kuài jìng*),
**seeks out divine wonders** (*lìng xù shénqí*),
one is **misguided**!
Look at those who **pursue the Dao**—
though they may be **far apart in the four directions** (*dōng xī nán běi zhī yáo*),
and their **teachings differ** (*shēngjiào gè yì*),
yet if they **have a resolve for the Dao** (*yǒu zhì yú dào*),
and **do not stray into false paths** (*bù rù xiétú*),
they **all converge seamlessly without gap**.

To walk the Dao and gain insight in one’s heart is called **virtue** (*dé*).
Once one knows how to cultivate the Dao,
**virtue** naturally arises within.
All who clearly manifest their **virtue**,
free from distraction and strife,
find themselves in silent accord as one.

Thus it is said:
*"Those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao,
those who align with **virtue** are one with **virtue**—
what wonder is there in this?"*

At the outset of practice,
cultivation follows **Dao** and **virtue**,
tracks and norms are observed,
effortless and unburdened, free from entanglement.
When one reaches the stage of profound self-realization,
settled in ease and depth,
resources flow effortlessly in all directions—
what was once gained now seems lost,
as pure effort fuses into oneness,
like crafting a wheel behind closed doors,
only to find it fit perfectly upon emergence—
all is unified.

Thus it is said:
*"Those who lose are one with loss."*

These three stages reflect differing levels of attainment,
each progressing along distinct paths.
Yet with prolonged effort and endurance through hardship,
even suffering transforms into serene ease,
abundant with delight—
spontaneously, one’s true nature unfolds.
When suffering is exhausted, what joy knows bounds!
Thus it is said:
*"Those who align with the Dao find the Dao delights in them;
those who align with **virtue** find **virtue** delights in them;
those who align with loss find loss delights in them."*

For the essence of **non-action** is what all may cultivate,
and the art of **naturalness** is what all may employ.
Even sages of ten thousand *li* or gods of ten thousand years—
though time and place may shift—
naturally converge as if seals fitting together,
all returning to the same path.

If one claims **naturalness** is not thus,
then bias clouds the mind,
and divergent methods arise within.
Some cling rigidly to the concrete, stubbornly fixed,
others cling to emptiness, practicing solitary stillness.
Such cases are countless—
all stem from failing to trust the principle of **non-action**,
the Dao of **naturalness**,
and instead clinging to their own views as truth.

No wonder those who begin young in the Dao
find no fruition in their later years—
their resolve outstrips their learning,
and they spend their lives never grasping the true meaning,
straying into false paths.
How tragic!
How lamentable!

This speaks of the **Dao of non-action and naturalness**—
the same that governs heaven and earth, sun and moon,
the unseen and the spirits of the dead.
All follow this principle:
non-action and naturalness,
letting birth unfold as it will,
serving their purpose and acting as they must.

Yet ordinary people, once born,
exhaust their wit and cunning day and night—
how much of their innate nature remains intact?
Only those of lofty **Dao** follow nature’s constant way.

Though their early efforts may require striving,
once perfected, they return to the realm of non-action and naturalness—
effortless, as if attained without thought,
achieved without strain,
moving naturally along the **Way**.

Thus, when sages observe the Great **Dao**,
its principle of non-action and naturalness
shines clearly before all eyes,
unspoken yet universally understood.
But for later generations viewing the Great **Dao**,
its attainment seems reserved only for sages and immortals—
common folk dare not speak of it.

*The Zhongyong* says:
*"Strive in learning, struggle in effort—
success brings unity."*
Is this mere deceit?
No.

The origin lies in a heart that initially lacks faith,
entering through the path of **non-Dao**,
and as time progresses, it grows ever more distant and estranged—
thus, the **Way** of non-action and naturalness
cannot be fully shared,
and distinctions arise, dividing as if into separate households.
Those who study must understand this,
lest they be misled by peripheral **Dao** and false paths.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
*Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand,*
*those who stride cannot walk;*
*those who seek self-visibility remain blind,*
*those who insist on self-righteousness fail to shine;*
*those who boast of their own merits gain no true achievement,*
*those who vaunt their own virtues do not endure.*
In regard to the **Way**,
they are but gluttonous excess and burdensome exertion.
Since others may detest this,
those who truly follow the **Way** do not dwell upon it.

Earlier, it was said that the **Way** is rare in its naturalness—
not like the world’s coarse and dull masses,
who mistake recklessness for non-action,
and abandon for naturalness.
Yet, its essence is the Great **Dao** of perfect balance,
conforming to Heaven’s principle and human nature,
following the sages’ **virtue** and the sovereign’s **Way**,
preserving and reflecting inward,
returning to the root and restoring the origin—
thus, aligning above with Heaven’s decree,
it achieves non-action yet nothing remains undone,
and naturalness without deviation.
The *Yijing* says:
*"Exhaust the principles, fulfill innate nature,
and reach the realm of fate."*
Is this not the ideal?

Excess is a disease,
and insufficiency is also a disease.
The *Shujing* states:
*"Without bias or faction,
the sovereign’s **Way** flows vast and unrestricted."*
This is exactly so.

Even in human posture,
there exists an unchanging norm.
*Standing on tiptoe* means two feet propped up—
as the *Shijing* says:
*"I stand on tiptoe, gazing at you,"*
using this posture to observe others allows one to survey the horizon,
but if one seeks to stand long,
how can it be sustained?
*Striding* means two feet stretched wide—
to mount a horse, one may rest upon the saddle,
but if one wishes to walk,
how can it be done?
The enlightened do not insist on self-righteousness;
self-righteousness blinds them.
Those who shine do not seek self-visibility;
self-visibility obscures their brilliance.
Those who boast of their own merits often achieve nothing,
while those with true merit cannot be concealed—
why boast at all?
Those who vaunt their own virtues often lack endurance,
while those with genuine virtue command natural reverence—
why pride oneself?

If one does not believe in the **Way** of non-action and naturalness,
and does not know the principle of *"without doing yet done,"*
*"without striving yet achieved,"*
where all action is entrusted to Heaven,
how free and boundless it is!
To move is to move without resistance,
to halt is to halt without strain—
movement and stillness blend in effortless spontaneity,
how tranquil and serene!

If one fails to grasp the **Way** of emptiness without trace,
it is akin to greatness yet unable to contain—
or if one adds a single intention,
or forces a single perception,
like a glutton’s overindulgence,
or a traveler’s excessive labor—
not only is it unbeneficial,
but it also brings harm.
Those who study must follow the **virtue/power** of Heaven without obstruction,
conform to the natural principles of things,
and not merely interject human contrivance—
even the things themselves should be allowed their natural ease.
Adjust their diet and rest,
for even slight imbalance beyond proper measure—
whether overfeeding or excessive asceticism—
like a dog’s overindulgence causing injury,
or an ox’s overwork leading to exhaustion—
this only breeds internal unrest and self-detestation.
Hence it is said:
*"Others may detest this."*

Those who twist and strain,
seeking to stand or walk,
to shine or be renowned,
whose merits stir the world
and virtues surpass the crowd—
how utterly difficult it is!
The virtuous **Way**-follower despises such folly
and deems it unworthy of their own practice.

This rare naturalness is but one thing: **cleanness**.
What is **clean**?
When no thought arises.
What is **pure**?
When not a speck of dust adheres.
The heart must be like a mirror untainted by dust,
like still water unrippled by waves—
a boundless, luminous spirit,
and this is **cleanness and purity**.

Yet if the world’s ordinary men and vulgar folk,
dim-witted and oblivious,
spend their days doing nothing,
it is not **cleanness and purity**.
True **cleanness** holds light,
true **purity** reveals form—
like a clear pool reflecting the moon,
a single radiance of brilliance—
only then does one attain the reality of **cleanness and purity**.
If even a trace of self-visibility or self-righteousness remains,
it becomes an obstruction.
Thus, those who study the **Way** must cultivate a heart vast and unrestrained,
letting no matter or thing disturb their mind,
or occupy their inner sanctum.
Through prolonged nurturing,
a single luminous spark illuminates all—
as if the sun and moon hung in the sky,
penetrating every corner without fail.
Only fear that a moment’s clarity
follows another moment’s unrestrained indulgence—
then clarity will not remain constant.

Mencius’ strength lay in **nurturing qi**,
for when **qi** is undisturbed, the spirit naturally illuminates,
and when the spirit is luminous, the heart finds peace—
thus he did not say *"nurture the heart"* but *"nurture qi,"*
truly understanding that a unified will moves **qi**,
and unified **qi** moves the will.
If one does not seek to **nurture qi**,
but merely claims to *"nurture the heart,"*
how many will fail to find true heart’s repose their entire lives?

If the heart is truly **cleanness and purity**,
the true **Yang** naturally arises.
All ascension and descent, movement and stillness,
must follow their natural course.
To force tiptoeing into standing,
or striding into walking—
gluttonous excess and burdensome exertion—
all are improper.
Even things detest such imbalance,
and how much more so humans?
Thus, the virtuous **Way**-follower
refuses to indulge in it.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
**The Way Follows Naturalness**
There exists a formless fusion,
born before Heaven and Earth,
silent and boundless,
self-sufficient yet unchanging,
endlessly circulating yet never exhausted—
it may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.

I do not know its name,
so I call it **Way**,
and forcefully name it **Great**.
**Great** means to pass,
to pass means to go far,
to go far means to return.
Thus, the **Way** is **Great**,
Heaven is **Great**,
Earth is **Great**,
and the sovereign is also **Great**.
Within the realm, there are four **Great**s,
and the sovereign stands as one among them.

The sovereign follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the **Way**,
and the **Way** follows naturalness.
What is the **Way**?
In the time before **Hongmeng** had yet divided,
before Heaven and Earth showed signs,
before beings took form—
a hazy, indistinct **qi**,
a boundless, formless unity.

Boundless and limitless,
Measureless and boundless,
Seems there exists a thing,
From **Hongmeng** (*混沌*) born,
Swirling and taking form,
Before Heaven and Earth arose—
This is what is called **Wuji** (*无极*).

Silent and void yet bearing life’s potential,
Vast and empty yet containing motion’s intent—
This is what is called **Taiji** (*太极*).

All things possess two,
Yet **Taiji** alone has none.
From one movement, Heaven and Earth split,
Yin and Yang divide,
The Four Symbols and Five Phases unfold,
Encompassing all within.

Humans multiply,
Sun and Moon wax full—
Does not life’s abundance drain **Taiji**?
Yet unknown is this **Hongmeng** thing,
Unseen, unheard,
Yet in all things present,
In all times abiding,
Alone yet undivided,
Whole within chaos—
Yet ever generating, ever transforming,
From **Hongmeng** to this day,
Unchanging in its constancy,
Within its independence, one **qi** flows,
Permeating the **Dharmadhatu** (*法界*), opening and closing as it wills,
Endlessly revolving.

To speak of ordinary things,
It seems this **Way** would be exhausted!
Who knows it circulates through the Three Realms (*三界*),
Fills all beings,
Heaven relies on it to remain clear,
Earth on it to stay serene,
The grains on it to flourish,
Humans on it to live—
All follow its natural course.

Within it, what is born is born of itself,
What is formed is formed of itself,
Yet **Taiji** remains whole and complete,
Unchanged by the process.

Though myriad transformations arise without end,
None escape its signs and names,
Thus it may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.

Heaven is most sublime,
And from its sublimity it may be named;
Earth is most vast,
And from its vastness it may be named.
Yet this **Wuji**—the **Wuji** of **Wuji**—
Not divine yet the divine,
Without sound or scent,
Without form or image,
Yet in quiet repose it never ceases.

I do not know its true name,
So I call it **Way** and **Great**.
**Great** then encompasses all,
**Passing** (*逝*) reaches everywhere,
**Far** (*远*) attains the unattainable.
Know that exhaustion brings return,
For the **Way**’s **Greatness**,
It is not merely one among the Four **Great**s!

Those seeking the **Way**’s ultimate truth
Must not merely speak of naturalness,
But focus mind and regulate breath—
Concentrate the mind, and it does not scatter,
Then humanity’s **heart** is upright, as Heaven and Earth’s **heart**;
Adjust the breath, and it does not stray,
Then humanity’s **qi** flows, as Heaven and Earth’s **qi** does too.
To harmonize with **Qiankun** (*乾坤*), to govern Heaven and Earth—
What greater labor is there?
It lies within one mind, one body,
A breath’s length away.

*The Doctrine of the Mean* says:
"Attain **Zhonghe** (*中和*), and Heaven and Earth stand firm,
All beings flourish."
Is this not its meaning?

If one preserves the mind at all times,
Nurtures **qi** in every moment,
Except when eating to dispel hunger
Or sleeping to dispel weariness—
Then in all things, ever-aware,
No thought wandering, no breath faltering,
Only then does one avoid illness.

Otherwise, the slightest negligence brings decay,
External evils seize and disturb.
When **right qi** is lost,
**Evil qi** easily invades—
This is inevitable.

The ancients said:
"If one does not stir a thought,
Does not harbor a desire,
Heaven and Earth cannot peer into one’s secrets,
Ghosts and spirits cannot fathom one’s subtleties—
Truly not false!"

Some say to establish a foundation (*筑基*)
Is the path to longevity.
But for those who practice the **Way**,
No foundation need be built—
So long as mind and **qi** remain ever bound as one,
No scattering allowed,
Then ghosts and spirits cannot chase the soul or seize the spirit,
One’s life is in one’s own hands, not Heaven’s.

The Master says:
*"I do not fear the blame of indiscretion—*
If later scholars fail to uphold this practice as I have taught,
Then they have no means to stand before me.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Heavy as the Root of Light, Stillness as the Lord of Agitation**
Heavy is the root of light,
Stillness is the sovereign of agitation.
Thus, the Sage moves through the day without straying from the weight of his burden.
Though he enjoys splendor and spectacle,
His spirit remains detached, as in repose.

Alas! How can a ruler of ten thousand chariots
Cast his own body as light upon the world?
Lightness brings loss of **right qi**,
Agitation brings loss of spirit.
The Dao of cultivation concerns but two things—**qi** and spirit;
Refining and nourishing them
Is to return to the pristine Heaven of **Primordial Oneness**.

In **Preheaven** (*先天*), **qi** is undifferentiated, blending into formlessness,
Thick and heavy, ever at rest;
Spirit dwells in the intangible, void yet luminous, beyond description.
Once **Postheaven** (*后天*) is reached,
The heavy **qi** becomes light and disperses,
The still spirit grows agitated and restless.
**Qi** no longer matches the **Preheaven** vitality,
Ever damp and murky, lacking purity;
Spirit no longer mirrors the **Preheaven** clarity,
Severed from its root, shining alone.
Thus, life cannot stand firm,
And nature becomes difficult to refine.

Scholars who seek longevity
Must know that **qi** must return to its root.
How does it return?
The light and scattered **qi** must be restored
To the domain of solidity and depth,
Steadfast as a mountain, condensed as one mass—
Then **qi** returns to life,
And its vastness fills the Heaven.
The restless and wild spirit must be brought back
To the realm of purity and transparency,
Ever lucid, ever at ease—
Then spirit returns to nature,
And the whole becomes boundless and formless.
Thus, when spirit returns to its original nature,
And **qi** returns to its original life,
It is as though Heaven and Earth had not yet emerged,
Boundless and without end.
The more solid and concentrated it is,
The swifter its motion;
The more void and unmarked it is,
The more limitless its use.

From this, the heavier **qi** becomes the lighter—
The so-called **"Grand Qi"** (*浩然之气*), most vast and most firm,
Filling and permeating Heaven and Earth.
This is the spirit that can be still yet also move—
The *Yijing* says: *"Wondrous in all things, it is the spirit."
Indeed, as Confucius’ disciple Zisi said: *"Perfect sincerity is like the spirit."*

Thus, the Sage in the **Way**
Moves through the day without straying from his burden,
For fear that lightness will drain **qi**,
And hinder the flow of his practice.
Such steadfastness does not slow his progress?
Alas! Though there be the beauty of sound and color,
The allure of wealth and gain,
These are the adornments of the common crowd,
Not the concern of the **Way**-bearing noble.
When faced with the present moment,
The noble one remains as detached as in solitude,
Transcending the world’s attractions—
None know he exists.

Yet how can one of such exalted station,
Of supreme honor and worth,
With a body capable of becoming an immortal or Buddha,
Fail to cherish himself,
But instead take worldly glory and human pleasures as his bond?
Is this not to make his body light,
And to regard himself as too small?

Lightness means losing **right qi**—
**Right qi** is the **qi** of the subject—
To lose **right qi** is to lose form and substance.
Agitation means losing spirit—
Spirit is the **sovereign**—
To lose spirit is to lose sovereignty.
When both spirit and **qi** are lost,
How can the body endure?
This is truly to not know
That the human form is rare,
That China’s soil is hard to birth,
Yet to cast oneself as light—
Is this not a cause for deep lament?

Some cling to worldly splendor,
Envy the path of officialdom,
Saying that profit for oneself is abundant,
And that enriching one’s family is flourishing—
Yet they do not see
That the field of wealth and power
Is also the field of blade and strife!
From ancient times, elephants burned by their tusks,
Jade stones ruined by their embrace,
Their harm can be counted in full.
How can people see only the small,
And not heed the great?

Ah! The pain is bitter indeed!

「Water is light and floats—
This is the **postnatal qi** of the Dao,
Belonging to **external medicine**;

Gold is heavy and sinks—
This is the **prenatal essence** of the Way,
Called **true lead**—
Also called **gold elixir**, also called **the White Tiger’s first crescent breath**,
Its names are manifold—
This is **internal medicine**.

The prenatal gold generates water,
As the **natural order** of **sequential cultivation**,
And births humanity through it—
Thus it is said: *"Heavy as the root of light."*

After birth, humanity is purely
The reckless, turbulent, and light-floating **postnatal qi** at work—
Hence water-qi is light and floats,
Giving rise to manifold passions and desires,
The **essence of life** is lost,
And thus aging and decline come easily.

The **worthy** has the **method of inverse cultivation**—
None other than water returning to generate gold,
Light returning to heavy,
To restore the **original unity of Heaven’s breath**.

Thus, throughout the day,
They move without abandoning the **burden of refinement**—
Only to stand firm and upright,
Stable and uniquely established,
Thick and heavy without wavering,
Nurturing **vast qi** to fill the cosmos.

This is the **Dao of inverse cultivation for immortals**,
Where alchemy is practiced.

In sum: from **form** to **formlessness**,
This is but one matter of the **elixir’s Dao**.

Fire is dry and active—
This is the **postnatal spirit** of the Way,
Belonging to **external medicine**;

Wood is still and congealed—
This is the **prenatal original nature** of the Way,
Called **true mercury**, **true essence**,
Also called **the breath of the Azure Dragon**,
**True Unity’s breath**—
Its names are also many—
All are **internal medicine**.

The prenatal wood generates fire,
As the **natural order** of **sequential cultivation**,
And births humanity through it—
Thus it is said: *"Stillness is the sovereign of agitation."*

After the body takes form,
Purely the **spirit of erratic reasoning and delusion** rules—
Hence fire’s nature is wild and unrestrained,
With manifold deceits and transformations,
Its true essence is bound and obscured,
And thus weakness and collapse come easily.

The **worthy** has the **method of inverted application**—
None other than fire returning to generate wood,
Agitation returning to stillness,
To restore the **original unity of the spirit**.

Though there may be splendor and ease,
And dwelling in lofty detachment—
It is but all phenomena emptied,
One true essence held close—
Nurturing the **awakened True Golden Immortal**,
Summoning the **heavenly realms**—
This is the **elixir’s Dao of inverse refinement**,
Whereby immortality is attained.

In essence: from **awareness** to **formlessness**,
This is another branch of **cultivation**.

This is the refinement of **external medicine** to **internal medicine**,
From **postnatal** back to **prenatal**.

Let me further elucidate:
The **Dao of birth** follows the **natural order**,
The **Dao of immortality** inverts and overcomes it—
For without overcoming, there is no birth,
Nor without overcoming can one attain attainment.
Thus the **River Diagram** and **Luo Scripture** employ both **generation** and **overcoming**.

The **Confucian** and **Buddhist** methods of cultivation differ from mine—
They generally follow the **natural order**,
Conforming to the **degree of spontaneity**;

My **Dao** alone inverts and refines,
Requiring **diligent effort** in its practice.
If one fails to overcome,
There is no way to birth or attain.

But to cultivate in accordance with the **natural order** is easy,
While to invert and refine is difficult.
Without a **true master**,
Unclear of the **correct method**,
And recklessly gathering or refining—
Few escape harm.

Once the **true master** is obtained,
And the **correct method** is clear—
If one does not **seize the opportunity for immortality**,
Nor **cultivate the merit of virtue**,
Then **Heaven’s spirit** will not aid,
And **demonic illusions** will entangle—
There will surely be those who nearly attain but fail,
Whose **elixir collapses**, **cauldron tips over**,
And whose **life and essence are both lost**—
This is truly something to be cautious about.

How does one **invert and overcome**?
First, one follows the **natural order**,
Imitating the **method of husband and wife**,
With **fire entering the domain of water**—
This is **spirit entering qi**,
The **common folk’s father and mother** uniting to produce **medicine**.

When fire steams and water boils,
Gold is born from the depths of water—
At this moment, the **mystic orifice opens**,
And **true faith** arrives—
This is the **true yang** birthing,
And the **medicine-child** is produced—
This is **external medicine**.

Once the **golden-qi** is born,
**True lead** is sufficient—
I, with **fire urging water to ascend**,
**Wood bearing gold aloft**,
Urge it gently, guide it carefully,
Lifting it to the **Heavenly Cauldron**,
To pair **true lead** with **true mercury**,
To use **true fire** and **true intent** to draw it,
Lowering it into the **elixir field**,
Entering the **Earth’s womb**—
Refining the **medicine** with the **cauldron and furnace**,
This is **returning to Kan as male**,
And **restoring Li as female**.

Inverting male and female,
Selecting them as **host and guest**,
Drawing them back into the **furnace**,
Refining them for a **morning’s watch**,
Then awaiting the **true yang fire’s movement**,
To form the **great medicinal fire**—
This is the **birth of internal medicine**,
Also called **the great medicine’s production**.

This is the **sage-father and holy-mother** uniting to nurture.

Moreover, the **small medicine’s** birth,
Its movement lies outside the **kidney passage**,
Its **qi** is weak—
Thus it is called **small medicine, external medicine**;

This one’s movement lies within the **qi’s root**,
When born, there are **heavenly response stars**,
**Earthly response tides**,
And the **six senses tremble**—
Thus it is called **internal medicine, great medicine**,
Also called **gold elixir**.

Again, with this **gold elixir**,
One **stirs the River Vehicle**,
**Stirs the gentle winds**,
Applies the **Earth’s fire**,
And refines the **true essence of the Li Palace**.

When **true qi** merges with **true essence**,
It is the **prenatal yang qi** subduing the **postnatal yin essence**,
And the **yin essence** also merges with **true qi**,
Transforming into the **holy fetus**.

For **true qi** is born from **true essence**,
As **child-qi**—
When **qi** returns to **essence**,
It is likened to **child entering the mother’s womb**.

It is said: *"The child clings to the mother and comes,
The mother clings to the child and remains—
Child and mother embrace,
Spirit and qi depend on each other."*

It is the **internal true fire**,
The **external application of yin-symbol yang-fire**—
When **internal and external** refining occurs,
The **holy fetus** is formed—
As in the saying: *"When lead is nearly exhausted, mercury also dries,
Transformed into one piece of purple gold frost."*

The **great Dao of gold elixir** differs from the **Dao of birth**—
Only in this inversion of **nature’s transformations**,
And overturning of **Heaven and Earth**.

All those with **merit and virtue**,
With **opportunity and Dao**—
Upon encountering my **explanation**,
May all apply the **function**,
Without fear of **heterodox calamities**.

Yet the **Heavenly mechanism** is fully revealed here—
If there are those who **assist in virtue**,
And receive **Heaven’s illumination**,
Understanding this **meaning**—
They must not **lightly disclose** it,
Lest they incur **guilt and blame.»**

「Then the scripture speaks of *"the sovereign of ten thousand chariots"*—
This is the **original spirit** within the human body.

All people’s hearts desire
A single body’s peace and security,
A hundred years of vigor and strength—
Yet how can they know to **induce transformations**,
To **arouse emotions** and **generate life**,
While **lightly expending** their bodies in the world?

This **qi** is **hollow and floating**, thus **losing qi**;
This **spirit** is **agitated and restless**, thus **losing spirit**—
If the body’s survival is already scarce,
How much more so the **Dao of gold elixir**?

This **explanation** has already laid out
The **principles** of **foundation-building**, **self-refinement**, **forming the elixir**, **returning the elixir**, **jade nectar**, and the **small and great cosmic cycles**—
Detailed and clarified.
Those who follow the **Way of life**,
Who are **scholars and officials**,
Should cherish and never forget it—
Thus knowing its truth and practicing it to perfection.

Through this, **achievement and Dao** are attained,
And one becomes forever a **celestial immortal**,
Free from the **sufferings of the mortal world**—
Is this not most fortunate?
All should strive accordingly!

**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: Constantly Do Good to Save Others**
**Good deeds** leave no **traces** to be followed,
**Good words** bear no **flaws** to be censured,
**Good instruction** requires no **plans or strategies**,
**Good concealment** has no **locks or keys** yet cannot be opened,
**Good binding** has no **ropes or knots** yet cannot be undone.

Thus the **sage** constantly does good to save others,
And so **never abandons anyone**;
Constantly does good to save all things,
And so **never discards anything**.

This is called **"inheriting clarity."**

Therefore, the **good person** is the **teacher** of the **not-good**,
And the **not-good** is the **resource** of the **good**.
If one does not **honor their teacher**,
And does not **cherish their resource**,
Even great wisdom may lead to **great confusion**.

This is called **"the essential subtlety."**

The **sage’s heart** seeks only within themselves,
Not in others.

In their **application to affairs and things**,
They act without **non-action**—
Whatever arises, they respond accordingly,
With no **deficiency within**,
And no **harm done to others without**.

As the *Yijing* says:
*"When the time is to stop, one stops;
When the time is to act, one acts—
In **motion and stillness**, one does not lose the **proper timing**,
Their **Dao** is **radiant and clear**."*
Is this not such a person?

In their **conduct**, when the time is right to act,
They simply act—
No **trace** of their origin before,
No **path** of their destination behind—
How could **traces** possibly remain?

Their **conduct’s goodness** is such.

In their **words**, when the time is right to speak,
They simply speak—
No **humiliation** seen within themselves,
No **shame** left for others—
How could **flaws** possibly persist?

Their **words’ goodness** is such.

As for **matters requiring calculation**,
And **affairs needing strategy**—
Measured by **reason**,
Judged by **sentiment**,
Following **reason** to apply,
Conforming to **sentiment** to halt—
When much is fitting, much is done;
When little is fitting, little is done—
Why bother with **planning and scheming**?
This **responsive action without deliberation**,
Where **self and others dissolve**—
Is this not the **good calculation**?

Further, there are **matters requiring closure and binding**—
For others, if not **closed**, there is **chaos**;
If not **bound**, there is **dispersion**—
Yet the **sage** cuts off all **external connections**,
And **no internal thoughts** arise—
**Perfect and complete**, is this not the **good concealment**?

Though there are no **ropes or knots** to constrain,
No **locks or keys** to guard—
Yet there is no **gap** for others to exploit,
As if **sealed tightly and unassailable**,
Their **impenetrability** is such.
Is this not the **sincere unity of Heavenly principle**,
With **no vulnerabilities** to be seized?

This **number** of ways—
They follow **natural Heaven**, untainted by human **artifice**,
And so their effects are such.

Essentially, **internal cultivation** and **external emulation**,
**Self-correction** without **other demands**—
This is how one **establishes themselves and others**,
With **no one left behind**;
This is how one **perfects themselves and things**,
With **no talent wasted**.

Their **benevolence in saving and benefiting others**—
How could it be otherwise?

This is all from **self-illuminating virtue**,
And **extending it** to **govern people and things**—
Is this not **reiterating their clarity**?

Yet the **good person** initially does not **know themselves**—
The **good person** **forgets** **self and others**,
Thus the **not-good** are **moved** and **revere them as teacher**.
The **good person** is also not **self-satisfied**—
Seeing the **not-good**, the **good person** takes them as **resource**,
Following what is **good** and correcting what is **not**—
Thus the **good person** **advances in goodness**,
Until they reach the **domain of supreme transformation and divine change**.

If **common folk** **rely on their own abilities**,
**Boast of their own skills**—
Seeing the **good**, they **ignore** them as if nothing,
Not knowing to **revere them as models**;
Seeing the **not-good**, they **discard** them as if they were trash,
Even **despising** them and deeming them unworthy—
Not knowing *"to see the virtuous and strive to equal them,
To see the unvirtuous and reflect inward"*—
Though **good and evil** differ,
Their **teachers and resources** for **self** remain the same.

Such as this—
Not **honoring their teacher**,
Not **cherishing their resource**—
Are they not the **foolish and self-indulgent**,
The **lowly and self-absorbed**?
Are they not truly the **bewildered**?

**Goodness** is **learned from teachers**,
**Evil** is **warned against**—
Whatever arises is **beneficial to oneself**,
No person lacks **benefit to the body**.

This is truly the **essential method of self-cultivation**,
The **wonderful Dao of bodily governance**—
All should **strive** accordingly!

This **understanding of the sage’s words** is **universally applicable**.
The **principles of affairs and things**,
Are the **Dao of life and death**—
**Substance and function** are inherently **unified**,
**Root and branch** originally **inseparable**.

As said, **good conduct** leaves no **traces**—
Extended to the **flow of spiritual qi**,
The **River Vehicle** moving **on its own**—
This is also so.

If there are **traces or signs**,
It belongs to **forced manipulation and deliberate meditation**—
Not the **free movement of the River Vehicle**,
Nor the **natural alignment with Heaven’s Dao**.

It says *"good words bear no flaws"*—
Meaning **no laws can be spoken**, this is called **Dharma transmission**,
Or *"the intent of the Ancestral Teachers from the West."*

Confucius said:
*"How does Heaven speak?
The **four seasons** move in their course,
The **ten thousand things** come to life."*

If there are **flaws to be censured**,
It means there are **words visible**—
Not the **sage’s silent comprehension and spiritual resonance**.

The **Buddhist School** says:
*"The **Dao** is originally **without words**,
Yet people have **spoken it into ruin**."*
This is its meaning.

It says *"good calculation requires no scheming"*—
The **numbers of the cosmic cycle**,
Are merely **symbolic names** for **three hundred transformations**,
In truth, there are no **hexagrams or strategies** to calculate;
If there are, they are not **natural fire and timing**.

It says *"good concealment has no locks"*—
This is the **original chaos** unbroken,
The **original spirit** **silent and motionless**,
The **original qi** **obscure and still**,
Returning to the **beginning of the Primordial Origin**,
To **bind the fetus** and thus become **sage**.

「If there is **closing**, there must be **opening**—
This is not the **Dao** of **internal cultivation**.

It says *"good binding requires no cord or constraint"*—
The **spirit** clings to the **qi** and congeals,
The **life** depends on the **nature** and abides.
When **spirit and qi** embrace,
They return to the **Primordial Pole (Tai Ji)**,
Binding into a **rice-grain-sized pearl**—
The **body of the Yang Spirit**.

If there is **artificial binding**, it is forced together,
Not the **natural coalescence** of the **qi**,
And thus cannot **restore life and return to the true self**—
Yet its **effects** are as described.

The **essence of cultivation and nourishment** lies simply in:
*"Seeing the good, one shifts toward it;
Encountering faults, one corrects them."*
Taking **patterns from the good and the bad**,
And **reflecting inwardly** as the **method**.

If one **boasts of talent** and **relies on wisdom**,
**Disdains the Dao** and **tramples others**,
Holds no **reverence for the teacher**,
Nor **cherishes the resources**,
Even with **talent and wisdom**,
One remains a **foolish and ignorant man**,
And will **never attain the Dao**.

Here lies the **subtle essence of cultivation**—
The **sage and the common man** share the **same path**.

**Chapter Twenty-Eighth: Constant Virtue Never Departs**

*"Know its **masculine** aspect, hold to its **feminine** aspect,
To become the **valley of the world**;
To become the **valley of the world**,
**Constant virtue** never departs,
And returns to the **infant state**.

*Know its **white**, hold to its **black**,
To become the **model of the world**;
To become the **model of the world**,
**Constant virtue** remains unerring,
And returns to the **Primordial Non-Polarity (Wu Ji)**.

*Know its **prosperity**, hold to its **humiliation**,
To become the **abyss of the world**;
To become the **abyss of the world**,
**Constant virtue** is then complete,
And returns to **primordial simplicity (Pu)**."*

**Pu** disperses to form **vessels**;
The **sage** employs them as **officials and leaders**.
Thus, the **great method** is never severed.

In the **Dao of cultivation and refinement**,
**Qi** originates from the **Yang**.
Operating the **River Wheel (He Che)**, proceeding by **Child-Midnight (Zi-Wu)**.
When the **lead-qi** is fully extracted,
And the **mercury-essence** is sufficient,
This is when **lead and mercury merge into one qi**—
Now, **merging the masculine** to **refine the elixir**,
But **suppressing the feminine** to **nourish the elixir** is even more crucial.

Hence it says: *"Know its **masculine**, hold to its **feminine**."*

The **masculine** is **Yang**;
The **feminine** is **Yin**.
When **Yin and Yang** harmonize,
And **masculine and feminine** resonate,
The **metal is hidden within the water**;
Then **water again generates metal**—
When the **metal-qi** is abundant,
The **tidal signals** arrive.
Its **momentum** is like a **valley and ravine**,
Flowing from above to below,
Just as the **valley and ravine** accumulate and overflow.

The **practitioner** knows that **Yang does not generate from Yang alone**,
But from **Yin**—
Thus, one does not **hold to the masculine** but **holds to the feminine**.

Over time, **subtle Yang gradually emerges**,
And the **Yin dross** is fully transformed,
Returning to the **constant virtue of restoring the root and life**,
Which **cannot be momentarily separated**.

From here, **Yin and Yang** intermingle,
Binding into the **immortal fetus**,
And thus **daily tempering and nourishing** to form the **infant**—
This is inevitable.
The *Wù Zhēn* says: *"Nurturing the feminine within the masculine to bind the sacred fetus"*—
This is it.

Once **lead and mercury** have merged,
And become **one unified essence**,
This **intermingling essence** is then **nourished in the Kūn Palace** (Kun Gong) for **refinement**,
And **true lead** is born.

This is called *"knowing its **white** and holding to its **black**"*.
The **white** is the **essence**;
The **black** is the **water**.

Before the **essence** is produced,
The **Kūn body** is inherently **void**—
When it **interacts with the Kān (Heavenly Water)**,
The **Kūn void** becomes **Kān (Abyssal Water)**.
Thus, **metal is born within the water**,
And relies on the **Kūn Mother** to **nourish and complete** it,
Hence it is called **mother-qi**.
The *Wù Zhēn* says: *"Extracting the white from the black as the elixir-mother"*—
This is it.

Once **true lead** is obtained,
One **activates a droplet of one’s own mercury** to greet it.
With **left hand lifting and right hand drawing**,
One **quietly awaits the White Tiger’s head** (Bai Hu Shou Jing).
If one **truly hears the thunderous rumblings from below**,
There is the **state of the elixir-heart piercing the day**,
And the **vast-qi towering above the heavens**—
I **still hold to my void and still abode**,
**Not the slightest agitation**,
This is the **time of refining essence into qi**.

Afterward, **operating the wheel**,
Ascending the **three vehicles (sānrú)**,
From the **double gates (shuāngguān)** of the **sacral spine**,
Up to the **mud pellet (nìwán)**,
Following the **four cardinal processes (Zi-Wu-Mao-You)**,
And **harmonizing the sequence of the four seasons**—
This is the **model of the world**.

All **birth, growth, contraction, and concealment** of **humans and things**,
Also **do not differ in the slightest** from the **heavenly transformations**.

From this, **ascending and descending**,
Sending it back to the **earthly cauldron** (tǔfǔ),
Transforming **manifest forms** into **non-manifest forms**,
And returning to the **Primordial Non-Polarity (Wu Ji)** of the **Heaven**.
This is the **moment of the Great Heavenly Cycle**—
The **jade-fluid elixir** is here.

At this time,
The **golden elixir** returns to the **mysterious orifice** (Xuànqiào),
And **merges with the true-one qi of the Azure Dragon** (Qīnglóng Zhēnyī),
Refining into the **non-dual Primordial Spirit**—
This is the **time of refining qi into spirit**.

In the **next layer of cultivation**—
The **Dao of refining spirit back to void**—
Only **mysterious and chaotic**,
**Nourishing the void and stillness**;
**Turbulent and profound**,
**Perfectly uniting principle and qi**;
**Transforming perception into wisdom**,
**Merging sagehood with foolishness.**»

「A single day and night,
Speak not lightly, think not otherwise—
Like a dullard husband, utterly without perception.
Even if insults come again and again,
Stand as if unaware, as if ignorant—
Just as Shun dwelt in the deep mountains,
No different from a wild man of the hills.
This is the **honor of the perfected human**,
The **humiliation of the perfected sage**.

Without this, one cannot **nourish the void** and **align with the Dao**.
Thus it is said:
*"Speak, and the spirit-qi scatters;
The mind in turmoil, the fire of cultivation grows cold.
He who knows the **Law of Return**—
His golden treasure weighs like mountains."*

If one speaks recklessly, if one harbors a single thought,
It is like fleeing the elixir.
The **Dao grows higher, the path grows more perilous**.
At this stage of elixir refinement, it is the most dangerous ground—
Hence, ancient sages, after attaining fruition,
Feigned deafness and madness, acted as fools and lunatics—
All for the sake of **nourishing the void** and **aligning with the Dao**.
Why else would they endure such suffering?

Thus, the mind must hold nothing—
This is the **valley of the world**.
As the **valley of the world**, it must be colder than ice,
Clearer than water,
And only then will the **eternal mysterious virtue** be fully realized.

Yet **true emptiness is not emptiness, subtle being is not being**.
First, from **non-being to being**,
Then from **being back to non-being**,
Finally, where **being and non-being stand not at all**.
This is the **Dao of returning to the Primordial Simplicity** from the **Great Polarization (Tai Ji)**,
The **Way of restoring the origin and returning to the root**.

Though it **converges into one**, it **disperses into ten thousand**.
Thus, **endless generation**, **endless transformation**—
Where is not the **vessel** present?
Where is not the **Primordial Simplicity** dispersed?
This is the **saying of the Primordial Simplicity dispersing into vessels**.

The sage employs this—
Not valuing the vessel but dispersing the Primordial Simplicity—
For **emptiness and stillness** are the **master of the body**,
The **total holder of all transformations**,
Like the sole authority in the world of men.
It is also said, *"The great measure does not cut"*—
For the **Dao in its wholeness** encompasses all without omission,
Fulfills all without excess—
Sufficient for governance.
If one were to **cut into it**, it would be artificial contrivance,
Not the original **nature of Heaven**.
The sage does not cut—
Only returns to the **Primordial Chaos of Heaven**.

Do the students understand?
When viewed alongside the **chapter on Confucius’ virtue**, one sees
The essence of **refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit** is all here.

Still, its subtleties must be further explained:
*"In days past, the master’s oral instruction:
Only **concentrate the spirit** and enter the **qi-cavity**."*

If one does not **return the light and illuminate the elixir field (Dan Tian)**,
The **golden water** will surely become turbid.
Once one knows to **concentrate the spirit in the Kūn Palace (the lower elixir field)**,
Yet sometimes **halts and does not persist**,
The **water and fire** will scatter—
Where then will the **true-one qi of the Primordial Heaven** arise?

Though **concentrating the spirit** is essential,
**Regulating the breath** must not be neglected.
If one knows to **concentrate the spirit in the qi-cavity**
But does not know to **adjust the inhalation and exhalation**,
Descending into the **Yin-latch orifice (Yin Kēi)**,
Though the spirit may dwell, the breath will not flow freely—
Without **fanning the wind and stirring the fire**,
The **common breath** will stagnate while the **true breath** emerges,
The **common mind** will die while the **true mind** is born.

Moreover, the **true fire** depends entirely on the **true breath**—
Without the **true breath** to fan it,
Not only will the **water and fire** remain unclean,
But the **golden embryo** will fail to refine.

Once the **spirit is concentrated** and the **breath is regulated**,
One knows where to **return**—
At the moment when the **spirit is harmonized** and the **qi is unobstructed**,
As if **Heaven has not yet opened**,
Dark and indistinct—
Only then can all **wandering thoughts and turbid qi** be gathered and purified,
Like the **eclipse of the sun and moon**, revealing a new vitality.
Thus, **thread by thread, weave by weave**,
At the moment of **no awareness**,
Suddenly there is **awareness**—
This is the **foundation of the Great Polarization (Tai Ji)**,
The **manifestation of the Mysterious Pass (Xuàn Guān)**,
The **first stir of the Primordial Yang**.
At this moment, if one can **grasp it firmly, hold it steadily**,
This is the **technique of seizing mist and catching clouds**.

The **Dan Jing** says, *"When the time arrives, the spirit knows,"*
And again, *"The true child is alive"*—
This is precisely what is meant.

At this moment, one must **seize it immediately**—
If even a moment is delayed,
The **post-heaven awareness** will arise again,
And it will no longer be fit for the **golden elixir**.

This **critical juncture** must be grasped
When all **affiliations are abandoned** and **not a single thought arises**—
Only then can the **true intention** find it,
And the **true pure medicine** be obtained.

It must be **stillness upon stillness,沉沉沉沉 (sinking deeper and deeper)**—
At the moment of **no awareness, no perception**,
One seeks **awareness and perception**—
Only then may it be attained.

If it is said, *"Not a single thought arises,"*
Then why seek with the **intention**?
Is it not that **intentionally seeking** falls into **post-heaven awareness and spirit**?

Yet the **true intention** is like **hidden fire**—
Though unseen, the fire is present.
It is merely **triggered by the mechanism**, and the spirit follows naturally—
Such is the **spontaneous response**.

If one says the **true intention is indeed intentional**,
It falls into **rigidity**.
If one says the **true intention is truly without intention**,
It falls into **empty vacuity**.

Between **intention and no intention**, the student must **understand it naturally**.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Motionless and still,
Yet responsive and penetrating."*
Only then is it **true knowing, true awareness**—
All done by the **true intention**.

Though the **true intention** arises from the **true heart**,
The heart must be **empty, luminous, and responsive**—
Neither increased by **having** nor decreased by **lacking**.
With this **true heart**, there is **true intention**.
With this **true intention**, there is **true breath**.

One must possess **enlightened illumination**,
Never missing the **opportune moment**—
Then each refinement will bring its own **growth and benefit**.

At this stage, if one **constantly seizes the moment**,
The **true yang** will naturally arise—
Still, one must **refine oneself and await the time**,
Not daring to harbor even a **trace of seeking movement**,
Lest the **post-heaven awareness and spirit** intrude—
Then the **Primordial Heaven’s utmost yang essence**,
The **true-one qi**,
Will, through **long-term cultivation and accumulation**,
Naturally produce the **great medicine**—
Capable of **returning youth and reversing aging.**»

「One must fear only **not** being willing to **accumulate merit and practice diligence**—
To **establish external cultivation** would be vain.
**Uphold propriety and rectify customs**—
To **cultivate inner virtue** is the only foundation for reception.

The common saying goes:
*"One fears not the single act, but the accumulation;
One fears not the sudden, but the forced combination."*
Truly, these words are profound.

Students who wish to grasp the **Dao/Way’s purpose** must not merely listen to the claim that **"nature alone suffices."**

**Chapter Twenty-Ninth: Removing Excess and Extremity**
*"If one seeks to take the world and act to do so,
I see it as a matter of necessity, not choice.*
*The world is a **divine instrument**—
It cannot be **willed** nor **grasped**.
To **will** it is to **undermine** it;
To **grasp** it is to **lose** it.
Thus, things either **act** or **follow**, **draw in** or **expel**, **strengthen** or **weaken**.
Therefore, the **Sage** removes the **excessive**, the **luxurious**, the **extreme**—
The **Dao/Way** is inherently **soundless and odorless**, pure and serene by nature.
Those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** must also **not know and not perceive**,
Purely yielding to **nature**—
This is the **mind-seal** of all ancestors, from the **Primordial Beginning** to this day,
Unalterable and beyond deviation.

Yet, how unlike the **heterodox sects and false schools** of the world!
They mock our **Dao/Way**, calling it **solitary cultivation of emptiness and refinement**,
Ultimately leading to **barren voidness and uselessness**—
How could I not ponder this?
*"If one seeks to take the world and enforce **artificial governance**,
I see it as a matter of necessity, not choice—
The more one enforces, the more one is driven to necessity."*
Indeed, though the world be vast,
Its **divine framework** is what precedes it.
The **Primordial Dao/Way** is the **silent natural**—
The world is the **divine instrument’s** boundary;
The **divine instrument** is the **world’s sovereign**—
The world may be **willed**, but the **divine instrument** may not.

If one **wills** it,
At first, there will be **chaos and many affairs**,
And in the end, **moral collapse and transgression**,
While **Heaven’s virtue** is utterly abandoned—
This is precisely how **willing** leads to **undermining**.

Consider: **Artificial governance** brings ruin,
But **non-action** achieves success—
**Grasping** disrupts the **constant**,
Yet **non-grasping** attains the **Dao/Way**—
How much more so, since the **Dao/Way** originates from **Heaven**,
And **Heaven’s Dao/Way** is **non-action**,
While **spontaneous transformation** arises within it—
How could it be otherwise?

Observe the time of birth:
The **Primordial Yang** (*乾元*) initiates creation—
Sometimes **yang** departs and **action** precedes;
Sometimes **yin** arrives and **following** comes after.
**Motion** and **stillness** mutually root each other,
With **inevitability** in their nature.

As for **qi**—
When it **expands**, it naturally **contracts**;
When it **draws in**, it naturally **expels**—
**吸** then **呴** arises effortlessly;
**呼** then **吹** unfolds serenely.
Thus, **vital breath** flows freely,
And **life-force** endures eternally.

Yet, **endowments and receptions** differ—
**Strength** and **softness** are not the same—
Some receive **abundant qi** and possess **vigorous essence**,
Others receive **sparse qi** and have **weakened essence**—
All these are **post-heaven disparities**.

Since things are born with their own distinctions,
Sometimes they **ascend**, their **qi-machinery** flourishing upward,
Sometimes they **descend**, their **qi-machinery** naturally collapsing downward—
All these are the **natural workings of Heaven’s Dao/Way**,
Not something **human effort** can force.

Though at the **initial stage** there may be traces of **coercion**,
Yet one must follow its **momentum** and **timing**—
**Act** when it can be done,
**Cease** when it must be stopped—
**Coercion** within **yielding to nature**,
Which remains **unfailing** over the long term.

This is also what the **Sage** knows when **harvesting medicine and refining elixir**—
In all things, **remove the already excessive**,
**Remove the too luxurious**,
**Remove the too extreme**—
Always returning to **moderation**,
Always maintaining **harmony**.

Though it may be said **"artificial governance" exists**,
It is also the same as **"non-action"**;
Though it may be said **"action occurs"**, it is also the same as **"non-action"**.

Thus, **having and not-having mutually generate**,
Only then can one speak of the **Great Dao/Way**.

This is the **Great Dao/Way of non-action**—
**Non-action** refers to the **study of nurturing the Primordial** (*先天养性*);
Yet it is also **action**—
**Action** refers to the **craft of refining the post-heaven** (*后天炼命*).

One must know that **action and non-action**,
Though their **cultivation methods** differ,
The **sovereign principle** within them must never be **disturbed**—
If **disturbed**, it is **not moderation**.
Whether **action** or **non-action**,
Both are **not** the **Dao/Way**.

Only when the **sovereign principle** remains **unshaken and undisturbed**,
Knowing **timing and discerning momentum**,
Advancing when **opportunity** presents,
Retreating when **difficulty** arises—
Then **non-action** is achieved,
And **action** is also attained.

What is the **sovereign principle**?
It is the **divine instrument of the world**.

If humans can **grasp its origin**,
And **return** to the **undifferentiated and unfathomable**,
**Empty and luminous** without **obscurity**—
At first, **action** is **action**,
And at the end, **non-action** is **non-action**.

Otherwise, if one **universally claims** that **"non-action is natural"**, then why did **Confucius** bother to speak of **Dao/Way**?
Why did he speak of **necessity’s diligent practice**?
Why did he speak of **choosing virtue and firmly holding it**?

Knowing the **method of self-cultivation**,
Its **foundation** lies in **nurturing life and essence**—
The **cultivation of life and essence** requires **rest and effort**,
Not **forcibly distinguishing** between them—
All depends on **human discernment** of its **virtue/power**.

As in **governing the state**:
**Peace** is maintained through **ritual and music**,
**Chaos** is suppressed through **arms and warfare**—
**Responding to seasons** and **acting in accordance with Heaven**,
Then **success** will surely come—
**Left and right** will **flow like a source**,
And in all things, **fitness** will be found.

This is the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken to the **wise**,
But is **difficult** for the **rigid and dull-witted** to grasp.

**Chapter Thirtieth: The Fruit of Virtue**
*"Aiding a ruler with the **Dao/Way**,
One does not **coerce the world with arms**—
Such **endeavors** tend to **return in kind**:
Where the **teacher** abides, **briers and thorns** grow—
After great **military campaigns**, **harsh years** must follow.
Thus, the **fruit of virtue** is **simplicity** alone—
One **dares not** use it for **coercion**.
**Simple** yet **not arrogant**,
**Simple** yet **not boastful**,
**Simple** yet **not forced**,
**Simple** yet **not coercive**—
When things **flourish**, they **age**—
This is called **not the Dao/Way**,
And **not the Dao/Way** will **soon perish**.

In the **highest antiquity**,
Each ruled their own **state**,
Each **remembered their people**—
**Harmonious and bright** (*熙熙皞皞*),
They **shared** in **Heaven’s peaceful order** without **affairs**;
**Self and others** were **forgotten in unity**,
**Boundaries dissolved**—
How could there be **warfare** then?

When **shared labor** led to **disorder** and **conquests** began,
**Chiyou** (*蚩尤*) **transgressed** and **arms** were **raised**.
Then, **civilized governance** had **jade and silk**,
**Martial governance** had **weapons and armor**—
**Order** was maintained through **ritual and music**,
**Chaos** was suppressed through **dry weapons and blades**—
Thus, **courts** must **balance civil and martial** **virtue/power** together.»

The **virtuous** sovereign of the **Dao/Way**, enlightened and in high station,
Assisted the flourishing court, aiding in **harmonious governance**,
Serving the sovereign with **Dao/Way** alone, never enforcing strength upon the world.

Why is this so?
For he who slays another’s father and brother,
Another will slay his father and brother in return.
Human hearts yearn to return to **harmony**,
**Heaven’s order** favors restoration.
Grievances and vengeance know no end.

Moreover, where armies pass,
The people suffer harm;
Where troops march,
Even chickens and dogs are left desolate.
Thus, slaughter and death multiply—
Corpses fill great rivers, blood stains long walls,
From noble to common, all become dry bones.
The number of those who die exceeds those who live.
Wells grow desolate, fields lie fallow, and brambles take root.

Furthermore, the **killing qi** severely injures **Great Harmony** (*太和*),
The **perverse and rebellious winds** provoke **Heaven’s wrath**.
Thus, **yin-yang** fails to harmonize,
Rain and sun lose their proper time—
Droughts and floods come in succession, calamities follow,
Famine and hardship press upon the people,
Life is not worth a morning or an evening.
The ancients said: *"After a great army, there will surely be a year of famine,"*
A fate that must come to pass.

Yet when hunger and cold press hard,
Banditry grows daily;
When years are barren and calamitous,
Rebellious crowds rise—
Sometimes, war cannot be avoided.
The ancients said: *"Warfare values swiftness, not hesitation,"*
Thus, those skilled in war act decisively.
A **ren-yi** army arrives like timely rain,
Relieving those in dire straits with welcome offerings.
As when **King Wu** in a single campaign pacified the realm,
His purpose was merely to uphold **Dao/Way** and destroy the tyrant’s leader—
How dare he indulge in slaughter for a moment’s gain,
Or seize strength for personal glory!
If victory comes, do not boast—
Boasting breeds a love of war;
Do not self-praise—
Self-praise harbors martial arrogance.
Even if he subdues tyrants with ease,
Elevates the people to prosperity,
This is but the duty of a general to stabilize the state,
To save the world and rescue the endangered—
What cause is there for pride?

For the proud love to kill.
Even if boldness leads to chaos,
Plunging the people into fire and water,
Yet if the heart harbors threefold deceit,
Though no killing occurs, the seed of slaughter lies within—
This is not the **Dao/Way**.

Know this: war is a last resort for the sage,
Even if no soldiers are lost, no generals fallen,
No civilians harmed, no creatures slain,
It is still not the path of lasting peace.
How much less so for those unworthy of the sage’s approval?
Thus, if war must be waged, let it be without excess.

The *Odes* say:
*"Exhort the ruler not to seek the path of feudal lords,
For every general’s triumph rests on ten thousand bones."*

Reflect on this: war is perilous, battle is a dire omen,
Not the **Dao/Way** of nurturing life.

What of prolonged hostilities, where guest and host clash,
Dragging on endlessly, exhausting troops and treasury,
Alienating subjects and inciting grievance?
If it can be stopped but is not, how can it benefit the state?

Or when armies face entrenched defenses,
Years pass in supply lines,
A single moment of negligence—
The enemy seizes the pass,
Cuts off provisions—
Soldiers flee at the first rumor,
Troops scatter at the first sign,
Once mighty forces now reduced to ashes—
What wonder is there in this?
For *"when things reach their peak, they grow old,"*
Such is the inevitable course.

War is used to punish the **Dao/Way**-less with **Dao/Way**.
Yet if one delights in war and strife,
Claiming to pacify the people only to harm them,
To suppress rebellion only to breed it—
This is the ultimate **non-Dao/Way**.

To punish the **Dao/Way**-less while acting without **Dao/Way**—
How is this better than cultivating fields to repel bandits,
Resting arms and fostering goodwill among neighbors?
Early prevention is far superior.

As when **Shun** subdued the **Three Miao**—
The Miao people resisted stubbornly,
Yet Shun did not rely on arms but on **virtue/power**,
Dancing the *Ganyu* at the hall’s steps,
And in seventy days, the Miao submitted in harmony.
This was **威** without coercion, **武** without force—
Far surpassing mere coercion and arms.
Do those in high station know this?

This speaks of the **Dao/Way** of **fire-refinement**,
Of **symbolic talismans**, **gathering**, and **alchemical transformation**—
All deliberate action.
Compared to waging war and defeating the enemy,
This is a far graver matter, not to be taken lightly.

As when **Zengzi** tempered himself in battle,
Or **Zisi** warned of strict discipline in war—
Only thus can one transform **qi** and **spirit**,
Restoring the original, pristine state.
Like the unbroken purity of youth,
Unbroken, unharmed,
One may act in accordance with the times,
Follow the **Dao/Way** without partiality,
Free from peril or danger,
Ascending to the realm of **spiritual transformation**.

But for those already broken or aged,
When **post-heaven** lead and mercury are exhausted,
Where does life depend?
Then must one resort to **enchanting the tortoise** or **summoning the phoenix**—
Striking the bamboo flute, plucking the zither—
Only then may **immortal herbs** and **elixir plants** be gathered,
**Swords of jade** and **alchemical medicines** refined,
Transforming the mortal body into nothingness,
Nurturing the **sacred embryo** at the **spiritual pass**.

Yet the **fire-alchemy** requires the utmost secrecy—
Without a true master’s oral transmission,
One cannot penetrate its deepest mysteries.
Even if the **heavenly secrets** are obtained,
If inner **virtue/power** and outer cultivation are lacking,
Still, the **spirits and **Heaven** will not favor them.

Only with a **empty heart** seeking the **Dao/Way**,
Accumulating **virtue/power** and refining **function**,
In all things without guilt,
In all places embracing **ren**,
With **humility** and **gentleness**,
With **patience** and **yielding**—
**Spirit** abides in **qi**,
**Qi** clings to **spirit**,
Unbroken, ever-flowing,
Rooted in the deepest **primordial foundation**.

Never to be forgotten in haste,
Never to be abandoned in distraction—
At times remembered with urgency,
Never to cease.

Thus it is said: *"Those who aid the sovereign with the Dao/Way do not rely on arms to subdue the world."* Even if one attains perfect refinement, yet after the fire-alchemical tempering, when all coarse *qi* has been purged and true *qi* has yet to accumulate, the result will be indeterminate—neither fully present nor fully absent, subtle and difficult to discern. Moreover, there are those who, without cultivation, scatter their *qi*, and the more they refine, the more their *qi* disperses—all due to the mind’s restless fluctuations, like creeping vines that resist eradication. Hence it is said: *"Where the master treads, brambles spring up."* How much more so when the divine fire is applied, for yin *qi* resists retention, and long-standing ailments or childhood infirmities are driven forth—some exiting through sweat, turbid urine, or waste, while others manifest as external sores or toxins, varying in form. The cultivator must not mistake these for illness; only a tranquil mind can transmute *qi*.

Thus, the Dao of self-cultivation must transform the common body into a jade-like one, the turbid form into a golden one. Never be alarmed—for alarm stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire and gravely injures the primordial *qi*. Hence it is said: *"After a great campaign, there will surely be years of calamity."* Those skilled in warfare value decisiveness; those skilled in fire-alchemy value swiftness and subtlety. Hence it is said: *"Decisive and complete."* When the cultivator reaches the stage of pure *yang* transformation, they must not rely on their attainment, supposing themselves unfettered by hunger or thirst, able to move like the wind, requiring no stove in winter or fan in summer, displaying marvelous feats beyond ordinary men, and thus deeming themselves strong. To boast of such strength is to again agitate the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire; if not met with external censure, the internal elixir will surely falter. Worse still, if one harbors a self-aggrandizing spirit—even if they complete ten months of gestation and three years of nurturing, fulfilling every task with precision, yet still pride themselves and boast, arrogantly overbearing others—they are far from the vessel of the Dao. Even if successful in their endeavors, they will surely meet ruin in their debts. The peril of collapse is beyond reckoning!

What then of those who, relying on their strength, fail to cultivate humility and sincerity? Though they may practice virtue and concentrate on the Dao, they remain like rigid trees—strong yet lifeless—while the supple and fragile retain vitality. Day by day, year by year, as time passes, their vital essence wanes. How could they long enjoy the joys of mortal life? Hence it is said: *"When things are at their peak, decay begins."* By this reasoning, those who exalt themselves only bring themselves low; those who boast invite peril. How un-Dao!

Better to discard the rigid heart, maintaining simplicity and steadiness, adhering to principle while letting go of contrivance, yielding to Heaven’s arrangement—thus achieving strength without force, the Dao without effort. Here lies the peril of the initial fire-alchemical stages; let the scholar beware.

**Chapter Thirty-One: Tranquility and Simplicity as Supreme**

Warfare is an inauspicious instrument; men detest it, and thus those who follow the Dao avoid it. The noble man, at home, values the left; in war, the right. Warfare is an inauspicious instrument, not the tool of the noble. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility and simplicity are paramount. To triumph yet take no pleasure in it—those who do are but lovers of killing. He who delights in killing cannot prevail under Heaven.

Thus, auspicious matters are honored on the left; inauspicious on the right. Hence the left general is stationed left, the right general right, and funeral rites are observed. Many lives lost are mourned with tears; victory is treated with funeral solemnity. The sage governs Heaven and Earth with virtue and morality as supreme, law and teaching secondary. Only when forced to raise armies, wield arms, and send eldest sons to war—where younger sons bear the dead—does the *Yijing* warn: *"This is ominous, this is perilous."*

How much worse for those who revel in the tiger’s gaze, the eagle’s fierceness, who display arms on the battlefield and wield might in the barracks, who see conquest as gain and warfare as skill! Such warfare is not merely chaotic—it is the finest of arms. For the finest arms are inauspicious instruments. The ancients called halting the blade *wu* (martial virtue); these men call exhausting warfare skill—hardly the tool of the sage.

The noble’s true instruments are the Dao, virtue, and the love of life while abhorring death. To speak of arms is to speak of slaughter. When the sounds of killing resound and the land trembles, even chickens and dogs are unsettled—what then of the horror inflicted? Even earthworms cling to life, ants fear death; the most insignificant creatures recoil. How much more so for men? Thus, those who follow the Dao avoid such places.

All things value *yang* over *yin*—the left is *yang*, the breath of life; the right is *yin*, the seed of slaughter. Hence the noble, in ordinary times, honors the left. Only in war does he abandon the left for the right, revealing how little he esteems arms.

Even if one eliminates tyrants, punishes the wicked, and raises righteous banners in orderly ranks, warfare remains an inauspicious instrument, one the sage avoids. In times of peace, a state needs no martial preparations. When borders cry out in alarm and rebellions flare, and only then must arms be raised, the discipline must be strict, rewards and punishments unyielding. Where the army passes, the people offer wine and grain; where the soldiers march, the fields remain undisturbed. Thus does one conquer the rigid with flexibility, the fierce with virtue—evident in such conduct.

Let there be no display of martial might, no boasting of strategy. Only tranquility and non-action, ease and naturalness, suffice.

Though stationed amid the tumult of war, yet maintaining the orderly and tranquil demeanor of disciplined ranks.
With this approach, what fortress cannot be taken?
With this approach, what enemy cannot be crushed?
Its victory is inevitable.

Yet even so, such victory is but the common fate of arms—how dare one carve triumphs upon bronze and stone, or record exploits upon banners and scrolls, and thus claim eternal renown for posterity?
If such renown is sought, then one must endure the suffering of countless lives to achieve a single man’s glory.
To lack the virtue of nurturing life while harboring the intent to take it—how can this be justified?

He who delights in killing is cruel of heart, his laws harsh and unyielding.
He cannot embrace breadth to contain others, ever petty and self-righteous.
Such a man cannot prevail in the world.
If he were to prevail, the common folk would be utterly destroyed.

In ancient times, auspicious matters were observed on the left, inauspicious on the right.
Yet the *piān jiāngjūn* (偏将军), a subordinate commander, is placed on the left—
while the *shàng jiāngjūn* (上将军), the supreme commander, is stationed on the right.
For the supreme commander wields the authority of slaughter, while subordinate generals must obey his orders and cannot flaunt their martial might—
this is but the military equivalent of funeral rites.

How much more refined than opposing armies with national decrees,
commanding soldiers to sing dirges as if escorting the dead!
How meticulous and reverent!

And what of the saying, *"When many are slain, weep with sorrow"*?
It is clear that warfare wounds the natural compassion for life,
and arises only from dire necessity.
Thus, those who mourn ancient battlefields see corpses filling the moats,
blood swelling the ravines—
the heavens and earth seem to weep,
the grasses and trees to sigh,
and what of mortal men?
Even if war is won, the chieftains submit,
the people find peace—
yet reflecting inwardly,
one sees beneath the heavens countless children
scattered by blade and arrow,
half exiled, half dead—
and the heart is filled with grief!
How dare one return in triumph,
singing praises of valor,
and boast of one’s prowess?

To ponder this and yet show no remorse,
but instead wear a mournful countenance,
treating it as a funeral rite—
this is the way.

Mencius said:
*"If I excel in arraying troops and waging war, this is a great sin.
Only when the sovereign loves virtue does the world have no rival."*
And again:
*"One does not subdue the world through the advantage of arms."*

This proves that the martial and mighty do not kill,
and the virtuous are unconquerable—
truly the ideal for an age of peace,
while warfare is not the constant path of the sage,
nor the ambition of the king.

This is like using fire at the furnace—
an act of necessity for the weak and infirm,
to revive decay and mend what is broken.
How dare one boast of cleverness or novelty,
and claim such deeds as merit?

Those who follow false paths—
retreat and advance with talismans,
gather herbs and refine elixirs,
all contrived methods of action—
mistakenly believe them the Dao of immortals.
They err greatly.

Yet for the vigorous and young,
no need for such alchemical labor—
one may attain the elixir naturally.
But for the aged and debilitated,
whose vital essence and desires have long been corrupted,
without fierce refining and urgent transformation,
the essence remains unrefined,
desires unchecked.
With a polluted body,
how can one practice the Way of effortless spontaneity?

It is like welcoming honored guests in a filthy house—
impossible.
One must first purge the defilements within,
until form and perception dissolve,
the dust of attachment is uprooted,
and the original true nature manifests freely.

Even if one strives in cultivation,
one must remain at ease and unconstrained,
lest artificial fire harm the innate.
Thus, the highest sage values tranquility above all,
and victory without vanity.

Otherwise, there is only the artificial without the natural,
mere common *qi* without true *qi*.
A single flame of passion—
how long can it endure?
Thus it is said:
*"To glorify such things is to delight in killing."*

To delight in killing is to harbor slaughter in one’s heart—
how can such a man govern the world
and receive its blessings?
His failure to prevail is certain.

Thus, those who cultivate must,
though they act,
nurture a heart of compassion and pity,
a mind of humility and gentleness—
only then does the artificial contain the natural.

The ancients adjusted their methods without rigid formulas,
measured their medicines without precise weights,
acting in harmony with Heaven,
following their true nature.
Though they acted,
they did no harm.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Knowing When to Stop Brings No Peril**

The Dao is ever nameless.
Though crude simplicity is small,
the world dares not submit to it.
If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would come of their own accord.

Heaven and Earth unite,
and sweet dew descends—
no one commands it,
yet all is evenly nourished.

When names first arose,
and names were established,
then one must know when to stop—
knowing when to stop brings no peril.

Compare the Dao in the world
to rivers and valleys flowing into the sea.
The Dao is originally boundless and formless,
yet all phenomena arise within it—
present in all beings,
inherent in all things.
Before humans existed,
this was their origin.
After humans emerged,
this remains their root.
Though subtle and hidden,
it cannot for an instant be separated—
for if it were, all things would shatter.

Thus it is said:
*"The Dao is ever nameless."*

For those who seek the Way,
names must be given.
A grain of millet, three inches of yang spirit—
dwelling in the mysterious palace,
pervading the Dharma realm—
just as the Original Simplicity is whole.
Though small in form,
its function is vast.
All things in the world rely on it as sovereign—
who would dare to be its subject?

Even as lords and kings hold the power of life and death,
and rule over the people,
who would dare not obey their commands?

The person who attains this Original Simplicity,
with unwavering reverence,
holds fast and never loses it—
though lands and realms may differ,
none would fail to cross seas and scale mountains to come,
let alone those nearby.

Thus it is seen:
All under the heavens submit in homage,
all due to the power of this Original Simplicity to preserve.

Yet once humans are born,
their **qi** and nature constrain them,
desires cloud them—
few retain the Dao in its entirety.

If one seeks to embrace Original Simplicity and remain whole and pure,
only by imitating the heavens and earth can this be done.

The **qi** of heaven descends,
the **qi** of earth ascends—
just as in humans, the **Kan** and **Li** energies intermingle,
water and fire in harmony.

When heaven and earth unite,
sweet dew descends like pearls,
naturally falling into the **Zhong Gong**—
this is the **Yin-Yang** balancing,
the **sun and moon** sharing the same palace—
who commands it?
Who directs it?

All arises from the Dao as sovereign.
Yet what name does the Dao truly have?

Some say *"True Lead"* (真鉛),
others say *"Golden Elixir"* (金丹).
The ancients coined these names
only for the sake of later cultivators.

Once cultivators know its name,
they must then seek its reality.

「From the very moment the **Yin-Yang** energies intermingle,
a single point settles within the **Yellow Court** (黃庭).
Then one must cease its movement and remain steadfast,
settle its dwelling and remain unshaken—
thus the **Great Dao** endures perpetually.

Having known where to halt,
there is an inherent master that does not change,
so why would it suffer the humiliation of birth and death?

Thus, it is seen that the Dao disperses outward,
vast and boundless, unfathomable and indistinct.
When gathered inward,
it becomes indistinct and chaotic,
retiring and concealing itself in profound mystery.

If scholars do not grasp the **root principle** (統宗),
they lack a foundation to return to,
and thus scatter without measure.
Even establishing oneself proves impossible,
how then could one reach others?

Hence it is said:
*"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the ocean."*

Only by attaining the **root principle** does one achieve greatness.

Zi Si (子思) spoke of the **Way** of the **Junzi** (君子) as costly yet hidden—
this is the **one source** giving rise to myriad transformations,
where myriad transformations return to the **one source** of the **Way**.

In this chapter, the **sweet dew** (甘露) is the **True Lead** (**Kan**) and **True Mercury** (**Li**) merging before descending.
**"Knowing the halt"** (知止) is the **divine qi** gathering in the **Yellow Court** (中宫).

The **Taoist Canon** (太上) speaks of **perfect unity** (俱浑),
but I shall elaborate further:
Those who wish to cultivate **life and death** (性命),
must first clarify **True Lead** and **True Mercury**.

The ancients said:
*"Mercury is the inherent substance of my family,
Lead is the elixir of immortality from another."*

If one speaks only of **heart-nature** (心性),
there is no way to grasp it,
so the ancient **true immortals** (真仙) and **true ones** (真人) borrowed the name **Mercury**.

This **Mercury** is not the other—
it is the **heart’s essence**, the **soul’s elixir**—
borne from **nasal mucus, saliva, seminal fluid, vital essences, blood, and fluids**,
from the **postnatal turbid residues** (後天阴滓物),
illuminated by **divine fire** (神火) descending for a long time,
refined into the most **sublime essence**.

This **sublime essence** is the **host of original nature** (元性所寄).
For **original nature** is inherently pure and clear,
untainted by the slightest dust,
equal to the **Great Void**.

It is not the **postnatal essence** (後天之精) of the physical body,
nor the **vital breath** (氣) produced by **civilized and martial fires** (文武火),
nor the **divine light** (神光) that illuminates it—
otherwise, the **sublime essence** would not refine,
and the **sublime nature** would lack its foundation.

Thus, those who forge the **elixir** (丹),
must first **refine essence into breath** (炼精化气),
as said:
*"This essence is not the common man’s essence,
but the **Jade Emperor’s** (玉皇) saliva from within his mouth."*

The **Jade Emperor** is likened to the **heart**,
and this **sublime essence** is the **saliva**.

Once **essence is refined into Mercury** (精生汞化),
the **sublime essence** descends into the **Kan palace** (坎宫),
and the **True Yang** (真陽) ascends as well,
uniting within the **Yellow Court’s** (黃庭) **inner cauldron** (內釜).
I condense my **divine qi** (神气) here,
and over time, **True Lead** emerges, flourishing and manifesting—
this is what is called **"obtaining the medicine"** (得藥).

Yet the **sublime essence** is **True Water** (真水),
and the **True Yang** is **True Qi** (真氣),
**True Qi** being **True Lead** (鉛).

**Mercury** is **essence**,
**Lead** is **common**—
both are **postnatal substances** (後天) with form and appearance,
capable only of **nurturing vitality** (順而生男育女),
not of **eternal life’s** great medicine.

Only when **Mercury** descends and **Lead** ascends,
uniting in the **Yellow Court**,
condensing **divine qi** and regulating **breath**,
does one feel, in an instant,
a **boiling, surging** sensation—
like mist and smoke,
like tides and waves—
then does it become **True Lead**,
worthy as the foundation for **elixir forging** (炼丹之本),
as said:
*"Kan and Li unite to obtain the medicine."*

Then, **Yang fire** (陽火) and **Yin elixir** (陰符) are stirred,
ascending from the **tail vein** (尾闾) to the **muddy pellet** (泥丸).
The **muddy pellet**, long storing **Yin essence** (陰精),
combines with this **True Lead qi** (真鉛之氣),
forming a single entity—
this is what is called:
*"**Qian and Kun** unite to forge the **elixir** (結丹)."*

When **Yang qi** ascends to the **muddy pellet**,
what manifestation does it show?
A **refreshing clarity** in the head and eyes,
unlike the usual **dullness and dizziness**,
as if the wind disperses clouds and the sky clears—
a distinct transformation,
this is **True Mercury**.

The **Mercury** of before was still **common Mercury**,
unfit to nourish the **embryo of immortality** (仙胎).

When **Lead** and **Mercury** meet in the **muddy pellet**,
the **postnatal essence** and **postnatal qi** (凡精凡氣)
merge and transform,
no longer seen as **Lead** or **Mercury**,
but as a **pure, cool, and tranquil** taste—
refined into **sweet dew divine water** (甘露神水),
fragrant and sweet to the palate,
unlike the usual **coarse essence and turbid qi**,
this is what the ancients called:
*"**Amrita** (醍醐) anointing the **crown"** (灌顶).*

Swallowed from the **upper palate** (上腭),
it enters the **Yellow Court** to be **nurtured in warmth** (溫養),
and is then **sealed and secured** (封固).

This **True Essence**, once born,
softens the entire body like silk,
neither sleep nor wakefulness is desired;
while the usual **agitated body and mind** (動蕩之身心)
now rest in **perfect stillness** (浑然湛然),
unmoved and unshaken—
naturally attaining **stillness** (安所止) and **halt** (得所止),
what peril could there be?

This realm requires **Great Stillness and Great Clarity** (大静大定).
If one **harvests** (采取) with **single-minded focus** (一意凝注),
not scattering in the slightest,
the ancients called this:
*"**Non-harvesting harvesting** (不采之采) surpasses harvesting."*

Cultivators advance one step and see one step’s effects.
If there is no **true foundation** (真实处),
the practice remains incomplete.

When **heavenly mechanisms** (天机) are fully revealed,
one may **attain verification** (取证) by oneself.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others is Wisdom**
Wisdom in knowing others is wisdom,
self-awareness is clarity.

Overcoming others requires strength,
self-mastery is power.

Contentment brings wealth,
unyielding resolve brings purpose.

Losing nothing ensures longevity,
dying yet not perishing is true life.

The **Way** of cultivating oneself
lies only in **life and death** (性命).
If one seeks to **fulfill nature and establish fate** (尽性立命),
one must first **preserve the heart and nurture nature** (存心养性),
**safeguard life and maintain form** (保命全形).

I **cultivate** and **forge** it,
**accumulate** and **pile** it—
then **original nature** (本性) endures and **heavenly fate** (天命) is mine.

Yet to **fulfill the heart** (尽心),
one must first **know nature** (知性),
to perceive **the foundation of human life** (人生之本),
purely **heavenly principle** (天理),
unmixed with **human desires** (人欲)—
this is called **insightful wisdom** (睿智).

From this, **restraining desire and preserving principle** (遏欲存理),
constantly **self-examining** (省察),
ever **vigilant** (防闲),
ensuring **private desires are utterly purified** (私欲尽净),
**heavenly principle flows freely** (天理流行),
**piercing the original face** (洞见本来面目),
**lucid and unobstructed** (惺惺不昧),
**ever-clear** (了了常明)—
this is **perfect clarity and wondrous awakening** (圆明妙觉).

This is not **external speculation**,
but **one’s own true knowing**—
no other can comprehend it.

Hence it is said:
*"Knowing others is wisdom,
self-awareness is clarity."*

To **establish the vital mandate** (立命),
one must first **refine oneself** (炼己).
Refining oneself has two aspects:
One is **material desires** (物欲)—
if **material desires are not eliminated** (物欲不除),
**heavenly purity will not manifest** (天真难现).
To abandon these and seek **elixir and alchemical immortality** (药结丹) instead
is like a fine grain of millet mixed with weeds and tares—
without first uprooting the weeds (芟荑),
the good and the bad will inevitably grow together (苗莠并植).
Only by first **conquering human desires** (胜人欲),
constantly **maintaining and preserving** (常操常存),
can one achieve **steadfastness in practice** (有定守),
though not necessarily **steadfastness in power** (有定力).
Hence it is said:
*"To conquer others is to have power."*

The second is **constitutional qi** (气质)—
if **constitutional qi is not transformed** (气质不化),
how can the body **become firm** (身何由固)?
Thus, one **peels away the flesh to preserve the fluids** (剥肤存液),
**peels away the fluids to preserve the spirit** (剥液存神),
**peels away the spirit to return to the void** (剥神还虚),
layer by layer, stripping away until
one can **align with the Dao in truth** (与道合真).
If not **qi is robust and spirit is vigorous** (精固气壮),
how could one **vanquish all pathogenic forces** (战胜群阴),
**sweep away the six external evils** (扫除六贼),
so that **one’s inner and outer self becomes luminous as jade** (一身内外，精莹如玉),
**transmutes the mortal form** (变化凡躯),
and **refines into an immortal body** (炼成仙体)?
Hence it is said:
*"To conquer oneself is to grow strong."*

When refining oneself is thus complete (炼己了矣),
the vital mandate is **established** (命已立矣).
Does the **work end here** (功不于此尽乎)?
Does the **Dao reach fulfillment here** (道不于此成乎)?
Though it may seem so,
**igniting the furnace has its time** (起火有时),
**extinguishing the furnace has its moment** (止火有候).
If one does not **practice extinguishing the furnace** (止火之功) when the time is right (火足之时),
the **essence will move with the stirring of qi** (精必随气之动而动),
thus one knows that **stopping to nourish the elixir** (止养丹)
is like a poor man **accumulating wealth until he becomes rich** (积财而富),
**ever-awakened with abundance** (常觉有余).

Having known how to **extinguish the furnace** (止火),
one must also **advance the furnace to nourish the elixir** (进火以养丹),
**retreat the furnace to warm the elixir** (退火以温丹).
Only those with **resolute determination** (有志之士)
can **persistently and meticulously** (绵绵密密)
**inhale and exhale without interruption** (不二之息).
The *Classic of Changes* (《易》) says:
*"Heaven moves with vigor,
the virtuous person **strengthens himself without ceasing** (自强不息)."*

The **resolute determination** spoken of is indeed the resolve of the **willful** (有志之士).
After this **nourishment and tempering** (温养),
merely **calm the mind and rest** (安神息),
letting nature take its course (一任天然),
without ever losing one’s grounding (无一时一刻之失所).
As **Master Zisi’s son** said:
*"The utmost sincerity knows no cessation;
without cessation, it endures."* (至诚无息，不息则久)
This is the very meaning.

As for the **transformation of the mortal form** (凡身脱化) and the **ascension of the true spirit** (真灵飞升),
it is much like the death of an ordinary man.
But the death of an ordinary man means the **dispersion of the spirit** (神散);
while the death of the **sage** (圣人) means the spirit remains whole (神完).
Though the form dies, the spirit lives on—
how could it not share in the longevity of Heaven and Earth? (与天地同寿耶)
This speaks of **mastering human nature and conquering desires** (知人道、胜人欲),
still rooted in the pursuit of **exhausting principle and perfecting nature** (穷理尽性).

Only when **nature is revealed and the mind illuminated** (性见心明),
when one **penetrates the original source** (洞彻本原),
when **spirit is strong and qi robust** (神强气壮),
and when **all yin impurities are purged** (煅尽阴滓),
can one **fulfill nature and establish fate** (了性立命).
For **nature and fate are not two separate paths** (性命不分二途),
but return to the **primordial chaos before differentiation** (混沌未开之天),
where **yin-spirit is extinguished and yang-spirit perfected** (阴神尽灭，阳神完成).

Even in the stages of **refining essence into qi** (炼精化气)
and **refining qi into spirit** (炼气化神),
there remains the **practice of extinguishing the furnace to nourish the elixir** (止火养丹).
*The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) says:
*"If one clings to fullness without restraint,
one risks sudden ruin and humiliation."* (若也持盈未已心，不免一朝遭殆辱)
This is precisely the warning.

**Refining essence into qi** marks the **beginning of gestation** (入胎之始);
**refining qi into spirit** marks the **completion of gestation** (成胎之终).
If one does not **know how to extinguish the furnace** (不知止火),
then **qi will not enter the womb** (气不入于胎).
Though essence is refined into qi,
it may yet **revert to essence through the movement of qi** (因气之动而复化为精).
Moreover, if one does not **know how to extinguish the furnace**,
then **spirit will not congeal in emptiness** (神不凝于虚空).
Though qi is refined into spirit,
it may yet **revert to qi through the movement of spirit** (因神之动而复化为气).
Thus it is said:
*"He who knows sufficiency is always sufficient,
and thus never meets disgrace."* (知足常足，终身不辱)
The words of the **Supreme Sage** (太上) are no deception.

When **spirit attains Great Stillness** (神归大定),
**qi follows into Great Stillness** (气亦因之大定).
A hundred years pass like a single day.
A wandering thought risks **losing the elixir** (走丹).
Such a burden is long and arduous—
only the **resolute and willful** (强行有志者)
can **steadfastly remain grounded** (常止其所),
enduring without decay over time (历久而不敝).

When the **threefold alchemical fire is perfected** (三昧火化),
one **ascends to the celestial heights** (立上凌霄),
living even in death—
their spirit suffices to share in the longevity of Heaven and Earth. (精神足与天地同寿)
The **beginning and end of the Golden Elixir** (金丹始终) are fulfilled here.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Sage Never Claims Greatness**

The **Dao** flows vast and boundless (大道汜兮),
yet cannot be confined to left or right.
All things rely on it for life,
yet it does not demand recognition for its deeds.
It accomplishes without claiming ownership.
It **clothes all things yet does not rule them** (衣被万物而不为主).
**Constantly without desire** (常无欲),
it may be called **small**.
All things return to it,
yet it does not rule them—
thus it may be called **great** (可名于大).
Therefore, the **sage never claims greatness** (终不自为大),
and thus **achieves true greatness** (能成其大).

The **Dao** is profound and boundless,
its expanse without end.
As the *Odes* say:
*"Left, left—what the lord approves;
Right, right—what the gentleman possesses."* (左之左之，君之宜之；右之右之，君子有之)
From this, one sees how the **Dao adapts to the times** (随时取用),
fulfilling all without fail,
nourishing all without measure.
What **Dao** is this?
It is the **origin of all things’ generation** (万物生生之本).

The **Dao** dwells in Heaven and Earth,
and all things draw from it for life,
yet it does not shun their chaos.
Because the **Dao lacks nothing** (道无不足),
all things thrive without obstruction (其生无不畅).
Though the **path of fulfillment** (生之遂之之道) is sufficient,
and things rely on it to complete themselves,
it is as if they **generate and fulfill themselves** (若物之自生自遂),
while the **Dao does not appear to act** (道不见为有).
What then is its accomplishment?
Though unnamed, it **permeates Heaven and Earth** (天地之大),
spanning the **four seas** (四海之遥),
covering all without exclusion (无人不被其涵濡),
encompassing all without remainder (无物不荷其帡幪).
Let things **generate and nurture themselves** (自生自育),
while the **Dao seems unaware of birth or nurturing**.
It **universally protects all** (普护一切),
**embracing all existence** (包涵万有).
Truly, it **"clothes all things yet does not claim life"** (衣被万物而不以为生).

When the **Dao’s work is complete** (道之功成),
its vastness is beyond naming (浩浩乎无可名也).
**Constantly without desire** (常无欲),
it is **always pure and clear** (常清常净)—
the **true and eternal Dao** (真常之道).
When viewed as **small** (就其小而名之),
even the **humblest blade of grass or tree** (一草一木之微)
is not excluded.
It **encompasses all existence** (弥纶万有),
leaving no gap unfilled (无隙可寻),
**undivided and complete** (浑然一团),
transmuting even the finest dust (纤尘悉化).
This is the meaning of **"nothing can break it"** (小莫能破之义).
Thus it is said:
*"Constantly without desire, it may be called small."* (常无欲可名于小)

When viewed as **great** (就其大而名之),
it **spreads across Heaven and Earth** (铺天匝地),
**nurturing all life** (统育群生);
it **endures from antiquity to the present** (亘古及今),
**embracing all things** (包含万夤),
yet **nothing is excluded, no one left out** (无一物之不归，无一夫之或外).
This is the meaning of **"nothing can contain it"** (大莫能载之旨).
Thus it is said:
*"All things return to it, yet it does not rule them—
thus it may be called great."* (万物归焉而不为主，可名于大)

How **profound and hidden** is the **sage’s Dao** (何其费而隐哉)!
The **sage aligns with the True Dao** (与道合真).
At rest, they **guard the Center and embrace Oneness** (守中抱一),
merging with the **serene Heaven** (浑同于穆之天).
In action, they **follow things and respond to conditions** (因物随缘),
embodying the **symbol of timely conduct** (俨寓时行之象).
Only Heaven is great;
only the **sage follows its example** (惟圣则之).
The **sage’s greatness is as Heaven’s** (圣实与天同其大).
Yet the **sage never claims greatness** (然圣终不以为大).
Only by **not claiming greatness** can one **achieve true greatness** (能成其大)—
this is what makes the **great sage** (大圣人) so.

This speaks of the **Dao’s vastness** (道之浩浩),
**generating all things with abundance** (生万物而有余),
**clothing all things with sufficiency** (被万物而至足).
Whether small or great,
it **encompasses all within**.
The **sage achieves greatness** (能成其大)
through **rooted cultivation** (修造有本).

Now, let us **delineate the initial practice**:
When **sitting in meditation** (打坐之时),
first **concentrate the spirit** (凝神),
then **regulate the breath** (调息).
Once the **spirit is concentrated** (神已凝了)—
there is no need for **overwhelming righteous qi** (浩然正气),
nor for **utter grandeur and rigidity** (至大至刚),
filling Heaven and Earth.
Only that the **mind is free of agitation** (心无烦恼),
the **intent is unburdened** (意无牵挂),
feeling the **heart like an empty vessel** (心如空器),
utterly devoid of attachment (一点不有).
The **mind melts like ice** (意若冰融),
with **not a single thought arising** (片念不生).
The **body stands erect** (此身耸立),
as if a **mountain steadfast and unmoving** (恍如山岳镇静，不动不摇)—
thus the **spirit-light descends** (神光下照),
illuminating the **qi-caverns** (于气穴之中),
**silently observing** (默视)
as the **yin-ascending qi** (吾阴蹻之气)
and the **palace-of-the-cinnabar-field qi** (绛宫之气)
**converge within the alchemical cauldron** (两相会于丹鼎之中).

「I then use the gentle, warm **spirit-fire** (温温神火) to carefully refine and cook,
with the subtle, yielding **wind** (巽风) softly blowing and exhaling—
naturally, the **essence melts** (精融) and the **qi transforms** (气化).

How do I know this is **refining essence into qi** (炼精化气)?
Before, I did not draw in **external qi** (外来之气),
but relied solely on my **inner heart-spirit** (吾心内之神),
the two harmonizing as one, blending into a unified whole.
Then, the **yin-ascending qi** (坎离) and the **kidney essence** (阴精)
were each scattered, utterly independent,
and even my breathing was not in accord.

When I begin to **retrieve external qi** (收回外气)
to regulate my **internal kidney essence** (制内里阴精),
upon its arrival, the **yin-ascending qi** (阴精) naturally transforms.
The **qi of the heart and kidneys** (上下心肾之气)
then merges into one, naturally settling the **palace-of-the-cinnabar-field** (绛宫) in tranquility,
and the **kidney storehouse** (肾府) in ease.

The **external breath** (外之呼吸)
and the **internal true breath** (内之真息)
merge as one **qi** (合为一气),
like a husband and wife in perfect union—
gathered yet never dispersing.
Day fills, month overflows,
and the **true yang** (真阳) begins to manifest its forms.

This is the clear sign of **transforming qi** (化气).

Once **qi is transformed** (既已化气),
I proceed to **ascend upward** (向上之事).
What is **ascending upward** (向上之事)?
At this time, when **breathing unites** (呼吸合)
and **spirit and qi exchange** (神气交),
it condenses in the **alchemical field** (丹田),
swirling and rising, like a living dragon swimming—
endless transformations occur in a single day.

I merely **concentrate the spirit within** (凝神于中),
**direct the breath outward** (注息于外),
and **listen to its natural course** (听其天然).
Naturally, it reaches **ultimate stillness** (静极)
and then **spontaneous motion** (动),
then **ultimate motion** (动极)
and then **spontaneous stillness** (静)—
this is **refining qi into spirit** (炼气化神).

When **stillness is firmly established** (静定久久),
my **qi becomes more regulated** (我气益调),
and the **swirling essence** (宛转流行于丹田者)
now refined to perfection, feels **both present and absent** (似有似无),
**both moving and still** (若动若静).
The **essence is imperceptible** (精看不觉),
but the **subtle convergence is known** (细会始知).

At this juncture, I must **extinguish all awareness** (务将知觉之心),
**dissolve all thoughts** (百想无存),
**dispel all illusions** (万虚全消).
The **spirit and qi of the alchemical field** (丹田交会之神气)
are then left to **self-stir and self-regulate** (自鼓自调),
**self-warm and self-fortify** (自温自煅).
I merely **maintain emptiness and stillness** (致虚守寂),
**entirely yielding to nature** (纯任自然).
The **spirit enters the qi** (神入气中) yet is unaware,
the **qi surrounds the spirit** (气周神外) yet is unnoticed.

After such a **refinement** (烹炼),
a **fragrant breeze** (香风) naturally arises,
rising to **penetrate the hundred meridians** (上冲百脉),
pervading the body in **scented transformation** (遍体熏蒸).
This is called **spirit giving birth to qi** (神生气).

Again, I sense that **spirit and wisdom grow daily** (精神日长, 智慧日开).
Within the **single mind** (一心),
only a **single breath** (一息) arises from the **alchemical field** (规中),
pure and subtle, refined like jade.

This is called **qi giving birth to spirit** (气生神).

Thus, **spirit and qi nourish and generate each other** (神气交养, 两两相生).
At this stage, it is most fitting to **release all grasping and return to emptiness** (撒手成空),
**neither clinging nor detaching** (不粘不脱),
**as if the spirit exists yet the mind does not** (若有心, 若无意).
This is the **practical essence of refining spirit back to emptiness** (炼神还虚之实际).

These **three practices** (此三件功夫),
though requiring time, can be **attained simultaneously** (一时可行可到).
The **student must follow the Dao** (遵道而行),
not merely reaching **coarse convergence of spirit and qi** (神气粗交)
before abandoning the seat—
nor **leaving upon achieving great union** (神气大交),
when the two are indistinct, **before attaining the realm of effortless, pure, and free stillness** (虚无清净自在之境).

One must **persist in this cultivation** (照此行持),
beginning with **refining essence** (炼精),
until over time the **qi grows strong** (气长) and the **spirit flourishes** (神旺),
transforming into **pure, natural ease** (清净自然).
Then, applying the **refining furnace techniques** (归炉工法),
one aligns with the **Heavenly cycle of filling and emptying** (天地盈虚消息),
and the **four seasons’ qi manifestations** (一年春夏秋冬气象).
Only then is the **great cycle fully complete** (始完全一周).

By **diligently cultivating thus** (工夫照此修持),
my **qi becomes ever more refined** (我气益调),
my **spirit ever more still** (我神益静).
Within, there are **endless transformations** (无穷变化)
and **inexhaustible vitality** (不尽生机).
Through **unceasing, day-and-night practice** (日夜行工),
**continuous and meticulous** (绵绵密密),
**stillness and insight merge** (寂照同归),
and **true qi** (真气) naturally arises,
**ascending to the brain’s marrow** (上朝泥丸),
**descending to the cinnabar storehouse** (下流丹府),
**penetrating the hundred meridians** (透百脉) and **piercing the flesh** (贯肌肤),
**bursting forth with an unstoppable force** (勃然有不可遏之状)—
this is the **path of the River Vehicle** (河车之路),
**naturally open** (自然而通).

I merely **follow its course** (顺其所通)
and **slightly guide it** (略微引起足矣).
Unlike **errant external methods** (旁门左道),
which **forcefully manipulate** (以自家私意空空去运)
or **rigidly control** (死死去行),
I do not **artificially stir or halt** (为之起止)
but **observe its own spontaneous motion and stillness** (观他自动自静).

Over time, the **cinnabar is perfected** (丹成) and the **Dao is established** (道立),
**walking through mists and flying through emptiness** (走雾飞空),
**becoming a companion of Heaven** (与天为徒).
The **sage’s attainment of greatness** (圣人之成其大)
is truly not a **light or easy matter** (轻易也已).

**Chapter Thirty-Fifth: To Go Without Harm**

Hold the **Great Symbol** (大象),
and the world will **turn toward it** (天下往).
To go **without harm** (往而无害),
is to **rest in ease and tranquility** (安平泰).
**Delights and baits** (乐与饵)
cause the **passing traveler to stop** (过客止).
The **Dao’s outward expression** (道之出口)
is **plain and without taste** (淡乎其无味).
To **look upon it, it cannot be seen** (视之不可见),
to **listen to it, it cannot be heard** (听之不可闻),
to **use it, it cannot be exhausted** (用之不可既).

What is the **Great Symbol** (大象)?
It is the **Dao that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and things** (生天生地生人生物之大道).
Because it **encompasses all** (无所不包),
it is called the **Great Symbol**.

What **Symbol** (象) is there to hold?
It is **the Boundless** (无极).
Yet **without a symbol is the symbol** (无象为象),
and what **holding** (执) is there to grasp?
**Without grasping is grasping** (亦无执为执).
Thus, one does not **contradict the Dao** (斯于道不悖).

If one can **always maintain and preserve** (常操常存),
**never forgetting nor abandoning** (勿忘勿助),
then the **Great Symbol is held** (大象执焉),
and the **Great Dao is present** (大道在焉).

In ancient times, **Confucius told Yan Yuan**:
*"One day’s effort in self-restraint and returning to ritual*
*brings the world to the **Dao of Ren** (归仁)."*
Thus, it is known that **where the Great Dao leads, the world follows** (大道所归, 天下所归).
Whether **returning to humanity** (归人) or **returning to the Dao** (归道),
all is **heartfelt sincerity** (心悦诚服).
How could there be **harm** (何害) in this?

I know that **one qi permeates and transforms all things** (一气相贯通).
All **things transform in silence** (万物皆默化).
**Merging and releasing**, **above and below rest in harmony** (上下相安)
within the **Great Cycle of Heaven** (泰运之天).
This is the **direct return to nature’s essence** (直自然之依归),
not something **felt in an instant** (非一时所感激).
If one merely **adorns the ears and eyes for a moment** (徒饰片时之耳目),
it **will not fail to flow continuously** (未始不源源而来).
But if one **listens to refined music** (世之雅乐) or **enjoys fragrant baits** (香饵),
it is enough to **make a passing traveler pause** (令过客停骖),
**dallying without departing** (流连不去).
Yet such pleasures can **only be temporary** (可暂而不可常).

The **Dao is without taste** (道无味),
not like **rich, fatty, sweet, or crisp** (肥浓甘脆)
that **makes one chew endlessly** (令人咀嚼不已),
**satiating without limit** (餍饫无穷).
Yet **what truly satisfies the palate and delights the heart** (人之爽口悦心者)
**is never wearying** (自不厌焉).

This is the **ultimate taste within the Dao’s plainness** (无味中之至味),
**not to be compared with the world’s overbearing flavors** (非世味之浓所可拟).»

「Though the Dao has no fixed place or form, it is difficult to conceive and even harder to grasp. Hence it is said: *"It cannot be seen, yet cannot be exhausted; it cannot be heard, yet cannot be drained."* Such is its nature—**encompassing heaven and earth without excess**, **conforming to all things without omission**. This is why the Dao is called great.

**A scholar must know where to aspire!**

This speaks of how a person must first **align with the harmonious exchange of heaven and earth** (天地交泰) before they can **fuse and disperse** (融融泄泄) in such a way—**not merely like refined music that lingers in the heart or fragrant baits that tempt the senses**, but rather to evoke **sighs of admiration without end**.

Yet such a realm is not easily attained. If one is in the throes of **private desires raging** (私欲甚炽) and **vital qi fading** (血氣將衰), and does not first **proceed from the realm of intense motion** (极动之处) to **gradually reach the state of stillness** (静地), then **the mundane heart will not perish** (人心不死), **the Dao-heart will not arise** (道心不生), **the ordinary breath will not cease** (凡息不停), and **the true breath will not manifest** (真息不見).

Only when **stillness follows extreme motion** (动极而静之际), must one **avoid letting true intention** (真意) dominate. This intention is **yin in nature**, belonging to **the category of *ji* earth** (己土).

Soon, one will feel **dimly vague and indistinct** (恍恍惚惚), as **yin and yang intermingle** (阴阳交媾). Then, one enters **the boundless realm of profound obscurity** (杳冥之境)—**like a dream yet not a dream**, **like waking yet not fully awake**.

Within this settled stillness, **suddenly a thread of warm qi arises** (一缕热气), **mingling and flowing continuously** (混混续续). As **the qi flows freely and the spirit harmonizes** (气畅神融), the two **converge within the Yellow Palace** (黄房之间)—**on the verge of distinction yet indistinct**, **indistinct yet suddenly distinct**. This is the **manifestation of true *yan* lead** (真铅现象).

Then, **the heart’s blossoms surge forth** (心花怒发), **warm qi fuses** (暖气融融), **the primordial spirit leaps** (元神跃跃)—**not through external provocation**, but **naturally arising**. Thus, **the signs of the Mysterious Pass** (玄关兆象) and **the foundation of the Great Ultimate** (太极开基) are realized.

At this moment, one must **employ a single point of true heart** (一点真心), **issuing true intention** (发真意) to **contain and gather** (收摄之). This intention is **yang in nature**, belonging to **the category of *wu* earth** (戊土).

In essence, it is **one intention**, merely **dividing the foundation of motion and stillness** (动静之基) into **the earths of *wu* and *ji*** (戊己之土).

For when **the Mysterious Gate** (玄牝) remains unopened and **chaos prevails** (混沌之中), **true intention** (真意) as the master is **the intention of boundless wonder** (无欲观妙)—**called *yin* earth**. But when **the Mysterious Gate opens and true essence manifests** (玄牝开而真机现), **one observes desire through its aperture** (有欲以观其窍)—**called *yang* earth**.

**One is the nameless origin of heaven and earth;**
**the other is the named mother of all things.**
**Generating heaven, earth, humans, and beings,**
**all arise from this single point of true intention** (真意), **flowing through them like a thread**.

**A cultivator who can master and govern this true intention** (真意主宰运行) will **not be swayed by sensation into thought**, nor **driven by motion into distraction**. As it is said:
*"The Celestial Pass is under my control;*
*the Earthly Axis is in my heart.*
**The cosmos resides within the body;**
**all transformations spring from the mind**—
**all these are the operations of this moment’s luminous awareness** (灵觉), **to be mastered and sustained**."

Hence it is said:
*"If one lingers too early in the breath,*
**the true essence does not yet appear** (真机未现), **and gathering it is futile** (采之无益);
*if one lingers too late,*
**mundane thoughts have already arisen** (凡念已起), **and gathering it will be mixed with impurities** (夹杂), **unfit as medicine for refining one’s essence** (不堪为我炼功大药).
**This requires great wisdom and great strength**—
only then can one **recognize it clearly and hold it firmly** (认得清、把得定) in this single breath, **as the foundation for attaining immortality and sainthood** (成仙证圣之本).

Though this **Mysterious Pass** (玄关) begins with **soft and delicate qi** (柔脆之气), **one feels only a faint warmth rising from the lower *dan*** (下元), yet over time it **surges through the body** (踊跃周身), **as if unstoppable**. A student must **discern it clearly at its subtlest stage**, **sustaining it with true intention** (以我真意主持) **without the slightest dispersion**. With time, the **qi-essence grows mighty** (气机大有力量), **allowing it to rise naturally, unchecked and unrestrained** (兀兀腾腾). One must **follow its course without added intention or interference** (不加一意，不参一见)—**then it is obtained**.

When the **qi-essence is robust and flourishing** (气机壮旺), **a single moment of stillness triggers the Celestial Essence’s motion** (天机发动), **rapid as lightning**. Even in **the midst of all clamor**, it cannot be restrained.

**One must have a heart of luminous awareness** (灵觉之心) to **master it**—**then there will be no flaw**.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The State’s Sharpest Tools**
*"When one is about to close them, they must first be fully extended;*
*when one is about to weaken them, they must first be fully fortified;*
*when one is about to discard them, they must first be fully employed;*
*when one is about to seize them, they must first be fully granted."*
This is called **the subtle art of *wei* clarity** (微明).

**Softness overcomes hardness;**
**weakness overcomes strength.**
**A fish cannot survive outside the depths.**
**The state’s sharpest tools must not be displayed to the people.**
**Heaven has its ebb and flow, wax and wane;**
**humans have their lifespans, fortunes, and paths of fulfillment.**
This too is the **ordinary course of qi and fate** (气数之常).

Yet this **applies only to the common masses** (凡夫), **not to the sages** (圣人). For **the sages possess the power to reverse heaven and earth** (挽回天地之能) and **the virtue to invert the *qian* and *kun*** (扭转乾坤之德)—**nothing more than inverting yin and yang** (颠倒阴阳) and **counteracting the workings of *dao* creation** (逆施造化).

For instance, **when autumn arrives**, **all things withdraw**, yet **one struggles to close and weaken** (欲歙弱而难整). The sages **then extend the vital breath of heaven and earth** (张天地之气运) and **strengthen the functional capacity of the vital qi** (强血气之功能).

**When winter comes**, **all things decay**, yet **one seeks to wither and seize** (欲槁夺而难生). The sages **then revive the cosmic essence** (气象之重兴) and **grant the years and months as their own** (岁月之我与者).

This is **both the subtlest and the clearest** (至微而至明), **both the most ordinary and the most extraordinary** (实常而实异)—**a truth only the sages can fathom**.

**To transform danger into safety,**
**to reverse chaos into order,**
**requires not mere mortal courage but divine transformation** (神化).

Yet **the essence of their return-and-restoration technique** (返还之术) is simply **softness** (柔) and **weakness** (弱).
**Only because they are soft do they overcome hardness;**
**only because they are weak do they overcome strength.**

What is their method?
*"If humans lack precision, they perish;*
**if fish lack water, they die.**
**Once a fish is removed from the depths,**
**the waters dry and life’s essence fades** (水涸而生机息矣).

**Humans and fish share the same dependency on water.**
But it is not **the water of heaven’s dew** (天露之水),
nor is it **the water of the Dao’s profound depths** (造道渊深),
**the primordial water of unity** (一元之水).

**It flows ceaselessly** (汩汩乎来), **frequently nourishing** (频相灌溉).
**Zhuangzi once said:**
*"They moisten each other with dew;*
**they breathe on each other with vapor—*
**yet better still is to forget each other in the rivers and lakes."*
This is his meaning.

**Later generations of heterodox schools** (旁门) **mistake tangible, material essence** (有形有质之精) for **the foundation of cultivation and longevity** (修炼长生之本), **utterly failing to grasp the Dao as a substance**—**vigorous, upright, and pure**, **its essence arising from profound obscurity, boundless void, and spontaneous naturalness** (恍惚杳冥、虚无自然而生者).»

The secrets of alchemical fire and the essence of culinary mastery are not imparted to the unworthy—only to the **sage-teacher** (聖師) does one reveal them, only to the **utterly sincere** (至誠) does one approach them, and only to those who have **deeds and virtue**, who **seek the Way with humility** (虚心访道), and who **sincerely pursue a master** (竭誠求師) can the **chance of Daoist attainment** (仙緣) be forged.

For the **heavenly mechanisms** (天機) are profound and hidden, the **weight of heaven and earth** (天地至重) is supreme, and the **ghosts and spirits** (鬼神) hold them in reverence. To recklessly transmit these to the unworthy invites **calamity upon the Nine Ancestors** (殃遺九祖). It is like the **state’s most vital implements** (國家利用之密器)—they cannot be casually revealed to others.

Thus, the **noble person** (君子) keeps them **meticulously concealed** (缜密而不出), and the **seeker** (學者)—does he grasp this truth?

This speaks of those who cultivate the Dao: they truly hold **the cosmos in their grasp** (宇宙在手), and **all transformations arise from their mind** (萬化生心). Yet still, they need only **observe the Dao of Heaven** (天之道) and **grasp its operation** (执天之行), following it to take and opposing it to act—this suffices.

It is not a matter of **harboring vital force within lethal force** (寓生機於殺機之中), but rather what is called **the supreme yin, resplendent** (至陰赫赫), and **the supreme yang, austere** (至陽肃肃). The resplendent arises from Heaven, the austere from Earth. To take the supreme yang from the supreme yin—this is the **seizing of opportunity** (資機).

If a person can **plunder yang from the black mountain’s cavern** (黑山窟), or **extract treasure from the demon’s lair** (鬼窩里), then they are **stealing vital force from lethal force**. Yet all this is done within the **void of heaven and earth**, or **plucked from the stillness of the human body**—this is the **true essence** (真精), not the **common essence of the world** (世之凡精).

If one can **plunder it without losing the moment**, and **apply it with a single effort**, then there will be **progress in proportion to the work**. I urge the seeker to **yield with softness** (以柔), to **weaken with humility** (以弱), to **establish virtue and deeds** (立德立功), so as to **earn the favor of the divine and heavenly** (神天之佑), and thus receive the **transmitted incantations of the immortals** (仙人傳授口訣).

Otherwise, even the greatest matters—those that **stir heaven and earth and move ghosts and spirits**—though even the immortals **rarely transmit them**. For the **heavenly mechanisms are most secret** (天機至密), the **heavenly laws are most strict** (天律最嚴), and they **cannot be defied**.

Zhuangzi said:
*"If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would offer it to their lords.
If the Dao could be advanced to others, then all would advance it to their kin.
If the Dao could be given to others, then all would give it to their siblings.
If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their descendants."*
Yet none of these are possible—why? Because **without inner virtue, the Dao cannot stand**, and **without inner mastery, the Dao cannot move**.

When we combine the words of the sages, we see that **the state’s most vital implements cannot be lightly shown to others**.

Later generations of cultivators must not treat the **Great Dao as a public matter**, imparting it indiscriminately to all, lest they **invite heavenly retribution** (天譴) and **regret it forever**. This is the meaning of **"public yet not public, not public yet public"** (有公而不公，不公而公)—a subtlety beyond the grasp of the unenlightened. Let them take heed.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao Ever Does Without Doing**

The Dao ever does without doing, yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could **guard this**, all things would **transform of themselves**.
When transformation is about to arise, I shall **restrain it with the nameless Primordial** (無名之朴).
The nameless Primordial—**it too will not desire**.
Through **non-desire, stillness** (不欲以靜), the world will **settle of itself**.

Though the Dao is naturally without doing, yet to **fixate on non-doing** becomes the **doctrine of stubborn emptiness** (顽空之學). One must **root oneself in non-doing** (無為植其本) while **beginning action** (有為端其用)—**non-doing within doing**, **doing yet still non-doing**. Thus the **essence stands firm** (體立) and the **Dao moves** (道行), the **Dao is complete** (道全) and **virtue is fulfilled** (德備).

This is the **"ever-responsive yet ever-still"** (常應常靜), the **"ever-quiet yet ever-alert"** (常寂常惺). When released, it **fills all six directions**; when withdrawn, it **hides in the central void**. Even in this **boundless, formless moment** (沖漠無蹤), there is the **probity of seated illumination, leaving nothing unobserved** (坐照無遺之概).

Though it is called **non-doing**, yet **doing is contained within it**; though it is called **doing**, yet **non-doing encompasses it**. Thus the **Great Dao is within me**, the **Great Root ever endures**.

Even the most exalted lords and kings—if they lack this Dao as their foundation, then **all things are severed and difficult to transform**. Only by **holding fast to this Dao** can **all under heaven—people and things—harmonize in their natures**, **resonate in their breath**, and **transform silently and imperceptibly**, until **great peace takes form**.

Yet in times of prolonged tranquility, the **ancient Dao is hard to uphold**. This is the **inevitable course of human inclination** (情所必至) and the **fixed principle of things** (理有固然)—there is no cause for wonder.

When **creation and destruction recur frequently**, and **luxury arises**, then **human hearts grow more treacherous**, and **calamities multiply**. This too is the **fate of heaven and earth**, from which **no one can escape**.

Only the **sage possesses the methods of enduring prosperity** (保泰持盈之法) and the **strategies of lasting governance** (久安長治之謀). In the age when **culture first emerges**, they **refine the nameless, undifferentiated Primordial** (浑然無名之太朴)—**without doing, without action, without thought, without deliberation**—and **apply it to themselves and to others**, **guiding those before and leading those behind**, **purely in accordance with Heaven**, unmixed with human contrivance. Thus they **stabilize the court within** and **pacify the world without**.

The **first line of the *Hexagram of Array*** (屯之初九) says: *"The sun lingers, beneficially residing in the upright"*—this is the **first stabilization of the unenlightened age**.

Just as **stone contains jade and the mountain gleams**, and **water cradles pearls and the river enchants**, even the **primordial and undifferentiated** (凡朴) has such power—how much more so the **nameless Primordial**? To **unify all people and things under its governance**?

If it is not **restored to its original, undivided state** (不歸浑穆), then it is **impossible to make the extremes converge** (會極歸極) or **ensure all attain the ease of the mat and cushion** (咸登衽席之安).

Only by **not knowing yet knowing**, by **following the pattern of the Emperor** (順帝之則), by **forgetting morality and the Dao**, by **not recognizing the unity of Heaven and humanity**—only thus does one **truly attain it**.

Thus it is said:
*"The nameless Primordial—it too will not desire.
Through non-desire, stillness—then the world **sets itself aright** (天下自正)."*
This is the **tranquil and undemanding governance** (恬淡無為), the **natural order without contrivance** (郅治無為), where **the ruler does not know what he transforms**, and **the people do not know what they respond to**. The ruler and the people **both rest in the Dao of non-doing**, and there is **an unknowing yet natural harmony**.

Thus **Shun governed without doing**, and so **he alone was revered through the ages**.

For those who rule over the people, can they not take **non-doing as their foundation**?

This discourse on **governing the age** holds **non-doing as its root**. The **principles of self-cultivation** are no different.

Lords and kings are like **the human body**—**most exalted and noble**. The common saying is:
*"A human body is rare in a kalpa, yet once obtained, it is already a marvel."*

Yet, have you not heard of the **Dharma/True Teaching**—is it not far more splendid?

If one does not cultivate now, **one’s vital essence and spirit will dwindle**, and **life and body will falter**.

In the blink of an eye, **one’s qi is extinguished**, and **one knows not whether one becomes a ghost or a gnome** (為蜮), a beast or a bird.

Through the **six paths of cyclic existence** (輪回六道), one turns and turns again without cease—when will one ever break free?

Now, with the **Dharma’s feast** (法筳) spread wide and the **Great Way** (大道) opened vast,
should one not hasten to practice and preserve it,
lest the years slip by in vain?

All things, like the **human body’s five senses and hundred limbs** (五官百體),
with **vital essence and blood-qi** (血氣),
can uphold this **constant Dao of non-doing** (無為常道),
then **all anxieties naturally subside** (諸虑自息),
and **the body’s framework is in perfect order** (百骸俱理).
The **skin becomes supple and the hair lustrous** (肌肤润泽，毛发晶莹),
not unlike **golden form and jade-like substance** (金相玉質).

If lords and kings can uphold it,
all things will **transform in harmony** (自化).
This is like **the inner light of a single mind** (一心内照),
then **changes resonate with mystic responsiveness** (通灵).

Yet **the fire of cultivation is not yet refined** (火候未纯),
and **one’s qi and essence still linger** (氣質尚在).
At this juncture, **spirit is greatly purified** (精神大整),
and **wisdom arises frequently** (智慧频生).
Some delight in **discourse on past and future** (過去未來),
to **showcase their talents** (以逞其才);
others take pleasure in **speaking of worldly achievements** (建功立業),
to **boast before others** (以夸於世).

All these actions spring from **impure virtue/power** (道德未纯).

The elixir of jade nectar now perfected,
once more the furnace and cauldron are set in order,
the primordial *Bu* of the Nameless is reclaimed,
poured into the Eight Trigrams Furnace.
Within, the divine fire of heaven burns naturally;
without, the common hearth is adjusted in measure.
After prolonged alchemical transformation,
even the Nameless *Bu* is utterly forgotten.

When one is **without knowing, without desiring**,
serene and unadorned,
the mortal form undergoes transformation,
returning naturally to the **primordial One-Qi of Before-Heaven**—
thus the Dao of the Transcendent is fulfilled.

As it is said:
*"By stillness without desire, the world will naturally align itself."*

This is the **single thread** that unifies the **Way of the Sovereign’s governance and self-cultivation**—
the thirty-eighth chapter:
*"The Virtue/Power of the Highest is not virtue/power."*

The virtue/power of the Highest is not virtue/power,
and thus it has virtue/power.
The virtue/power of the Lowest does not lose virtue/power,
and thus it has no virtue/power.

The Highest acts without doing yet accomplishes nothing;
the Lowest acts and yet accomplishes something.

The Highest in benevolence acts yet accomplishes nothing;
the Highest in righteousness acts and yet accomplishes something.

The Highest in ritual acts yet none respond,
so it raises its arm and forces compliance.

Thus, when the Way is lost, virtue/power arises;
when virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, ritual arises.

Ritual is but the **thinnest veneer of sincerity and trust**,
yet it is the **beginning of chaos**.

Prescience is the **flower of the Way**,
yet it is the **origin of folly**.

Thus, the **true person** abides in substance, not in form;
dwells in reality, not in ornament.
Hence, one discards the latter to take the former.

In the **ancient age**, the winds were vast and untrammelled,
each following its natural course;
the waters deep and boundless,
each resting in its own nature.
Above and below acted without contrivance,
rulers and people shared in joy.
Sincerity and thickness became the custom,
and disputes did not arise.

How profound and complete was the Way in those times!
It was because they abided in the **non-action of heaven**,
following nature’s spontaneous course.

In those days, the old were cherished as old,
the young as young,
the wise as wise,
the kind as kind.
They tilled the land with ease, took joy in their labor,
fed on virtue and drank in harmony,
knowing nothing of the names *virtue/power* or *Dao*,
nor hearing of *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*.

Yet they preserved their **primordial purity and integrity**,
allowed their *qi* to move naturally,
and harmonized with the flow of heaven and earth—
as if untaught yet transformed,
achieving without action,
united with virtue/power and the Dao,
without conflict with *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*.

When *virtue/power* and *Dao* are spoken together,
*Dao* is the **substance**, *virtue/power* the **function**.
When *virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* are discussed as a whole,
then *virtue/power* and *Dao* are again the **substance**,
while *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* are the **functions**.

Later sages, though establishing these for the transformation of the people,
named *virtue/power* and divided them into *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*—
yet within *virtue/power* are *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*,
and within *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* is *virtue/power*.
There is no separation, no lack.

But in later ages, *virtue/power* was divided.
Further still, *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* became fixated on one-sidedness.
This arose from the **shift of cosmic *qi*** and the **deceit of human hearts**.

The Transcendent One wished to return people to their roots,
restore them to their origin,
and thus sighed:
*"The person of Highest virtue/power acts without doing,
following their nature without knowing of virtue/power—
thus their virtue/power endures.
The person of Lowest virtue/power, knowing virtue/power’s excellence,
loves its name and delights in its practice,
fearing to lose it and thus their reputation.
These two minds—one divided, one consumed—
shatter the singular sincerity of the Highest,
where no duality remains, no thought lingers.
From having virtue/power, they return to being without it."*

Moreover, when the Highest acts without doing,
the people of the world align in one Way, one custom,
all abiding in a world of non-action.
When the Lowest acts with doing,
amid the rise of flourishing customs and varied governance,
they take joy in the constant of action.

Is it not so?
Those who forget contrivance **still the world’s machinations**,
while those who delight in affairs **stir the world’s strife**?

Yet when times are exhausted, they return;
when things are exhausted, they transform;
when people are exhausted, they revert.

In this age of many affairs,
when customs grow corrupt and hearts deceive,
the natural purity is long lost.
There must be a ruler who loves benevolence,
governing with virtue/power, purifying the source, rectifying the root,
turning chaos into order, peril into safety.

Though forced to act,
yet even in action, they adapt to the times,
following principle in their conduct—
action remains non-action,
thus the world is governed with ease.

Then there are those who love righteousness,
in times of disorder seeking to restore peace,
taking pride in sweeping away the old,
yet unable to return to stillness.
Though they may briefly pacify the world,
renewing people and things,
yet those above and below emulate them,
and the strife and contention among the people cannot cease.

As for the ruler of Highest Ritual,
the hearts of people grow ever more corrupt.
They practice the etiquette of reciprocity,
discussing the ways of giving and receiving—
some generous in giving yet stingy in return,
others kind in granting favors yet vengeful in response—
and cannot rest in tranquility.
Morning brings changes, customs shift,
yet they cannot harmonize near and far, great and small.
The slightest discord provokes raised arms and conflict,
and war erupts anew.
They cannot dwell together in peace.

Thus it is said:
*"When the Way is lost, virtue/power arises;
when virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, ritual arises."*

Down to this day,
as people grow more corrupt and affairs more complex,
sincerity and trust have reached their ruin,
and ritual alone is invoked to maintain order.
Yet such ornamentation, lacking inner sincerity,
only multiplies daily disputes and disputes over right and wrong.
Those who rely on ritual to bind the hearts of people
have not considered that outward compliance does not stem from the heart—
it must end in disaster and estrangement,
seeking safety only to invite danger.

Thus it is said:
*"Ritual is the thinnest layer of sincerity and trust,
yet it is the origin of chaos."*

*"As for wisdom, it is not some extraordinary strategy or foresightful scrutiny—it arises from sincerity and clarity, achieved without deliberation, without study, and without effort. It is as naturally luminous as a mirror; how could it compare to deceit or baseless trust?

Yet the superficial trappings of the Way are not the Way itself. Moreover, excessive scrutiny under the guise of clarity will inevitably lead to emptiness, deceit, and falsehood without one’s awareness. In oneself, one may pridefully claim exceptional insight, but this is merely the beginning of folly.

Thus, a true man of virtue possesses steadfast discernment and resolve. He knows that sincerity and depth are the essence of ritual, so he embraces substance over superficiality; he recognizes that empty ornamentation is not true wisdom, so he seeks the real over the illusory. When discernment in selection is proper, the Great Way is not difficult to restore.

This explains why, as morality decays, benevolence and righteousness emerge; when benevolence and righteousness decay, ritual and wisdom take their place—ever descending, a natural consequence of human nature and custom, nothing to marvel at.

As for cultivation, when swallowing saliva and breathing *qi* appeared, the Way shifted; when herbal alchemy and elixir refining emerged, the Way shifted again. Down to today, myriad false paths abound—beyond reckoning! Who still understands that the *xuanguan* (玄关)—that single orifice—is the essence of cultivation?

I now reveal it to people: To perceive this *xuanguan*, one must wait after great toil and great rest before its nature becomes clear. It is also said: *'When thoughts arise, that is the ailment; not clinging is the remedy.'* And again: *'Lay down the butcher’s cleaver, and you become a Buddha in this instant.'* Ultimately, it is about ceasing the tumult of worldly desires and杂念 (*zaonian*), awakening from the chaos—this is the *xuanguan*, the 'bank' one returns to.

It is also said: *'The other shore is not distant; the return of light and reflection is the shore itself.'* Yet fear arises: before the *xuanguan* opens, one may forcefully seek it; after it opens, one may obsessively guard it. Such fixations only stir confusion—like the sky, originally cloudless, yet when the clouds disperse, the vast, wondrous expanse appears. But if, after the clouds vanish, one reintroduces smoke and dust, the once-clear sky becomes constricted, murky, and unrecognizable.

The Buddha said: *'Dwell thus, subdue the mind thus.'* Such profound truths cannot be articulated in words—words only distort them. Nor can they be grasped through thought—thought only errs.

At the moment before the *xuanguan* opens, I simply follow its natural illumination. Once it opens, I rest in its effortless clarity. If thoughts scatter, I withdraw them—that is all. If the mind grows dim, I steady it—that is all. How simple and direct!

Yet people complicate matters by layering bed upon bed, seeking motion in motion, stillness in stillness—only to fall into contrivance. The *xuanguan* lies plain before them, yet they obscure it with later-day intellect.

I reveal a key principle: Let the thoughts churn endlessly, unresolved. The moment you awaken to their nature, they vanish instantly—that *is* the *xuanguan*. Thus, cultivation depends on this awakened awareness, like the unobstructed sun in an endless sky, ever luminous. The slightest shadow plunges one into the darkness of hellish defilement. If you dispel the clouds, the blue sky and white sun stand revealed.

But if worldly thoughts arise, you remain trapped in the ordinary. This is not the foundation of the immortals.

In truth, the Daoists have no secret beyond *mingxin jianxing* (明心见性)—enlightening the mind, realizing true nature—this is the essence of cultivation.

If asked what the elixir is, it is the primordial *qi* of the *dantian* (丹田), the unborn essence. Yet this essence, when united with the innate divine spirit (*yuanshen*), becomes the preheaven *taiji* and *wujji* (太极、无极), the primordial command before parents were born.

If one establishes one’s nature as one’s fate and fulfills one’s fate through nature, then eternal life is attained.

But those who seek the *xuanguan* of the watery realm, desiring to forge the golden elixir, must first harness the preheaven breath (*shenxi*). Without it, they cannot refine, temper, or nurture—preheaven nature and preheaven fate cannot unite, and the five and six energies cannot coalesce into the golden elixir.

Even so, once preheaven nature and fate are attained, without true *taixi* (胎息), it is like a man and woman unable to wed—no union, no offspring. Thus the *Danjing* says: *'True intent is the matchmaker.'* Now it is said: *'True breath is the matchmaker'*—does this not contradict the ancient texts?

The unenlightened mistake *zhanyi* (真意) as the divine essence of elixir refinement and union; *zhanyi* (真息) as the means. Yet both are merely the convergence of spirit and *qi*.

Without true breath, true *qi* cannot ascend and descend, unite, or nurture the formation of the primordial pearl. With true breath but no true intent to command, guide, and seal it, the breath cannot flow freely, advancing and retreating as it will.

Thus, true intent is the key to elixir refinement.

Yet true intent, without the original divine spirit, originates from where? Only when the *xuanguan* first opens does one recognize this true intent. Then, one must hold it fast, as Yanzi (颜子) revered his principles with unwavering devotion—thus it is attained.

Moreover, the divine spirit’s manifestation *is* true intent, *is* a single good deed, *is* the way of attaining all things through one.

If students recognize this clearly, the foundation of the Great Elixir is established.

Chiuzu (邱祖) once said: *'If the breath is even a hair’s breadth undetermined, the fate is not your own.'* I tell students: To seek longevity, first subdue the breath."

「Yet subduing the *qi* has two meanings: one is to suppress and store this *qi* within the inner palace (中宫), remaining still and unmoved; the second is to regulate and govern it strictly, for longevity lies precisely in this mastery of *qi*.

Beyond this, there is no other Dao. Those who practice must adhere to this principle, lest they betray my earnest intentions.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Taking Humility as the Foundation**

In antiquity, those who attained *One* (得一者):
The heavens gained *One* and became clear,
The earth gained *One* and became tranquil,
The divine spirit gained *One* and became luminous,
The *gu* (谷, grains) gained *One* and became abundant,
All things gained *One* and thus came to life,
And lords and kings gained *One* to establish their virtuous rule over the world—
This was the singular purpose of *One*.

The heavens without clarity would fear fragmentation,
The earth without tranquility would fear upheaval,
The divine spirit without luminosity would fear extinction,
All things without life would fear annihilation,
And lords and kings without virtue would fear downfall—
Their lofty status would tremble.

Thus, the noble rely on humility as their foundation,
The exalted rely on lowliness as their base.
Hence, lords and kings call themselves *gu* (孤, lone), *gua* (寡, few), and *bu gu* (不谷, unworthy)—
This is their adherence to humility as the foundation, is it not?

Therefore, the multitude of chariots lacks chariots,
And they do not desire to gleam like jade or stand firm like stone.

The Great Dao is none other than *One*.
What is this *One*? (一者何)」

The primordial *hóngmèng* before differentiation—this original *yuánqì*, vast and formless, the boundless *wújí*—gave birth to the *tàijí*, the ultimate principle that generates all things.

In essence, *yuánqì* is formless, thus called *wújí*. All things arise from *wújí* and take shape, truly the root of the world, thus called *tàijí*. This is the Dao.

The sage, unable to name it, yet naming it, thus says *One*.
Without *One*, there are no things; without things, there is no *One*.
To possess it is to live; to lose it is to perish.
From the beginning of *yuánshǐ* onward, those who obtain *One* and manifest form and likeness—endless, unceasing, generating without end—whether vast as the *zhōusha* sands or fine as dust, none can escape it.

As the *Zhōngyōng* says:
*"To see it, you cannot see it;
To hear it, you cannot hear it;
To embody it, you cannot abandon it."*
What else could this be?

Thus, in summary:
The heavens’ clarity comes from obtaining *One*;
The earth’s tranquility comes from obtaining *One*;
The spirit’s luminosity comes from obtaining *One*;
The valley’s resonance comes from obtaining *One*;
All things’ vitality comes from obtaining *One*;
The sovereign’s rectification of self and the world comes from nothing but obtaining *One* to uphold it.

Though great and small differ in form,
Noble and base diverge in path,
Exterior and interior vary in refinement,
Dark and bright divide in kind,
Ghosts and humans span the unseen—
How could anything transcend this *One* as its embrace?

Even the heavens, most exalted, would fear collapse without *One*;
The earth, most vast, would fear upheaval without *One*;
The spirit, most subtle, would lose its luminosity without *One*;
The valley’s echo, full of *qi*, would falter without *One*;
All things, bearing form, would perish without *One*;
The sovereign, most high and noble, without *One* to uphold the world, would face peril in lofty rank and ruin in exalted name—
How could *One* be disregarded?

If one can disperse from *One* to the myriad things—vast, boundless, unfathomably deep—
Then heaven, earth, spirit, valleys, all things, and sovereigns
All rely on this *One* as their sovereign,
Coiling through the heavens, weaving the earth, without gaps or exhaustion, filling all without end…
Thus, its extremity is such:
Nothing is higher than the Dao,
Nothing is nobler than *One*.

Yet, from non-being to being—what is there to exalt?
From subtlety to manifestation—what is there to prize?
Even if nobility surpasses the capital,
It arises from *qi* emerging from the obscure to the manifest,
Thus it is said: *"The noble relies on humility as its foundation."*
Even if height reaches the boundless,
It arises from *qi* ascending from low to high,
Thus it is said: *"The exalted relies on lowliness as its base."*

As for those in the world—
Though their rank is high like a marquis,
Though their honor is noble like a king,
They know the Dao arises from low to high,
From humble to noble,
Thus they call themselves *"gu"* (lone), *"guǎ"* (few), *"bùgǔ"* (unworthy)—
Is this not relying on humility as the foundation?

If one does not reside in humility,
But places oneself too high,
Then the mind lacks mastery, the Dao cannot stand,
The heart becomes scattered, the spirit cannot coalesce.
To harmonize all things in great centrality and rectitude,
Returning to the Dao—
Few indeed can achieve this.

Even those who drive many chariots cannot govern both center and periphery,
Yet those who drive but one chariot still hold sway within—
Thus, having chariots is like having none;
Greed for many is not as good as embracing *One*.

Like jade, if it gleams and multiplies,
Excess breeds devaluation;
Like stone, if it layers and piles,
Excess breeds peril—
These are what the *Tàishàng* does not desire.

Better to embrace *One* in humility and lowliness,
Only then to ascend to heights beyond reach,
To nobility beyond speech—
This is the path of cultivating the Dao to true perfection,
Where there is only *One*, no second.

Confucius said: *"My Dao is one and penetrates all."*
Mencius said: *"The Dao is but one."*
Yet—what is this *One*?

The ancients spoke of the *hónghóng-mèngmèng* state,
Where there is no thought, no dross—
A single, empty yet luminous, still yet alert essence.
This essence, when vast, contains the *dharma-realm*;
When narrow, not even a speck of dust can stand.
When manifest, it reaches the eight *yí* and eight *huāng* without obstruction;
When hidden, it scrutinizes even the finest dust.
This is the *extreme of wújí*,
The *non-divine divine*,
True beyond naming, beyond imagination.
The Dao of nature and life—this is all.

The *Tàishàng* likens the sovereign to the human heart:
If the heart can constantly hold and preserve *One*,
Without forgetting or aiding it,
Moment by moment reflecting inward,
Ever internally illuminating,
Then it will not lose *One*.
*One* is also *du* (solitary).

Solitary as the realm of *dujue* (solitary awakening),
With awe and vigilance,
This is the originally most high and noble—
Perhaps it can be long preserved.
Yet this is the study of cultivating nature,
Thus *shèn dān dú* (one mind in solitude) suffices.

But cultivating life involves action and effort—
If not beginning from the lowly,
From the humble and impure,
How could the medicine be obtained?
Much less the *jīndān* (elixir)?

The lower refers to the lower *dāntián*;
The humble refers to the filthy lower realm.
The scholar, seeking *yīng lái fù* (the return of *yang*),
With *qi* surging upward,
Must ascend from below to the apex—
How else could one obtain the pure and strong *qi*
As the treasure of eternal life?

If not from the lower *dāntián*, the turbid realm,
With divine fire descending to refine,
How could one forge the supreme *yang qi* as medicine?
The ancients said: *"Seeking yang within yin, stealing treasure from the ghost’s lair"*—
Truly not false!

Above all, one must have a single heart, no dual thoughts—
This is the way of guarding *One*.

When arriving at naturalness,
Forgetting self and others,
Then *One* is obtained.

When the cultivator reaches this state,
All things and matters under heaven
Are handled with ease and appropriateness—
*"Obtaining One, all matters are complete."*
Is this not true?

「If one clings to form and image,
Chasing after them in frenzy,
And is ensnared by the seven emotions and six desires,
By one’s body, family, and spouse—
Reluctant to cease, ever entangled,
Then one is far removed from the Dao.

Do not claim that external things are too manifold to speak of the Dao;
Even matters like nurturing the mind and cultivating the nature,
Refining the Dao and concocting elixirs,
Advancing fire and withdrawing talismans,
Gathering and sealing [the essence]—
All these categories are but empty constructs of their forms,
Established as guidelines for later scholars.

If the cultivator’s heart retains even a thread of impurity,
It becomes an obstacle to the Dao.
Hence the *Tàishàng* says: *"Make ten chariots vanish without chariots"*—
Not wishing to be polished like jade,
Or rigid like stone,
But fluid and natural.

For the Dao is but one Dao;
Why should the scholar seek anything else?

**Chapter 40: The Emergence of Existence from Non-Existence**
The reversal is the Dao’s movement,
The yielding is the Dao’s application.
All things under heaven arise from existence,
Existence from non-existence.
The great Dao is inherent in all—
Whole and complete in each,
So why seek further?

Yet one knows not that since the birth of humanity,
*Qi* is constrained by form,
The mind is veiled by matter,
And desires are stirred by knowledge—
Thus the Dao is drowned and lost in myriad ways.

Unless one expels all external disturbances within,
And disperses all outer agitations without,
Concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath,
Severing thoughts and forgetting artifice,
How could the primordial *yang qi* arise,
And the Dao’s *qi* return?

Hence it is said: *"The reversal is the Dao’s movement."*
This is the foundation of elixir refinement.

When the medicine is returned to the furnace,
And the elixir begins to form,
Mercury and lead merge as one—
Day and night, one must observe internally,
And the golden elixir shall manifest.

From this point onward, with proper gathering,
Continuous and unbroken,
Clear and ever-present,
Using humility to descend,
And gentleness to refine—
This is the marvel of returning the elixir.

Yet it is not only in returning the elixir that this applies;
From the initial practice to the completion of the elixir,
One must always focus the mind inwardly,
And concentrate *qi* to achieve softness.

For the elixir is refined from the *Tàihé*’s singular *qi*;
The cultivator must treat it with humility and harmony.
If even a trace of roughness arises,
The mundane fire will stir,
And harm the Dao.

Hence it is said: *"The yielding is the Dao’s application."*
All matters under heaven,
Though beginning with tangible forms and rules,
Did not originate from existence itself.
The sage, when the great Dao is fulfilled,
Though capable of infinite transformations and completeness,
Must first gather and refine from the utmost emptiness and non-existence,
Then the grand application flows,
And boundless *qi* permeates the two extremes [of *yin* and *yang*].

If one does not refine from non-existence,
How could one achieve such boundless suffusion?
Hence it is said: *"Existence arises from non-existence."*

The scholar’s essential cultivation:
At first, from non-existence to existence,
Refining subtle *yang* from stillness;
Then, from existence to non-existence,
Returning to tranquility from the flourishing within;
And finally, again from non-existence to existence—
A blurred chaos, self and others forgotten—
Over time, refining the three-inch *yang* spirit,
And the six-foot golden body.

Thus, existence and non-existence cycle eternally,
Iterating without end.
The scholar must adhere to this principle,
Or risk deviation.

This speaks of the great Dao of the golden elixir;
It is not something external,
But the true *qi* flowing through the body.
In stillness, it is deep as the abyss;
In motion, it surges like the tide.
Only those who cultivate with purity,
Focus inwardly with clarity,
Can reflect and verify it themselves—
Beyond what words can exhaust.

If one understands that the motive of movement is the source of life’s origin,
Then the elixir of eternal youth—
Could it be anything else?

Moreover, what is shared by all humanity,
Unchanged, without deficiency—
Only when the body moves does the essence not flourish,
When the mind moves does the *qi* not settle.
Thus arise birth, aging, sickness, and death,
Endless cycles of suffering,
Unceasing rounds of rebirth.
To escape all this,
One must first attain stillness in cultivation—
Only then can one grasp the motive of movement,
And restore the original *qi* of life’s beginning.

But this motive of movement is subtle in force,
Tender in *qi*—
A moment’s carelessness,
And the *guǐ* water [of impurity] arises,
Transforming the primordial flow into the coarse, post-heaven form,
Unusable for the Dao.

Hence it is said: *"See it, yet cannot use; use it, yet cannot see."*
From this single movement onward,
If gathering is not lost to time,
Then eternal life has its foundation,
And the great elixir its root.

If one clings to existence and strives forcefully,
Or holds fast to what one favors and guards rigidly,
Though one may obtain the medicine at times,
And await the elixir’s completion,
It cannot compare to the harmonious surge of *qi*—
And because of later improper gathering,
Or flawed refinement,
The singular *Tàihé qi* is injured by hasty, vulgar fire,
The Dao’s supreme *yang* vitality must endure humiliation and softness,
Only then can the elixir’s path be cultivated.

Hence the *Tàishàng* teaches:
*"Dull its sharpness, resolve its chaos,
Harmonize its brilliance, align it with dust."*

Yet though the Dao moves through *qi*,
It remains non-existence giving rise to existence;
If existence is not nurtured with yielding,
It cannot return to the empty non-existence of Heaven,
And how then could the Dao be fulfilled?

One may know that the return of the primordial *yang*
Is the Dao’s motive,
Yet fail to understand that all forms must return to formlessness—
For form is the Dao’s trace,
Formlessness its truth.

Understanding this,
One’s cultivation and refinement will not lack a foundation.

**Chapter 41: Great Vessels Take Time to Form**」

The superior scholar hears the Dao and diligently practices it;
The middle scholar hears the Dao, as if storing and forgetting it;
The inferior scholar hears the Dao and laughs greatly—
One who does not laugh is unworthy of the Dao.

Thus the *Jiàn yán* says:
*"Clarify the Dao as if in darkness,
Advance the Dao as if in retreat,
Smooth the Dao as if in roughness,
Virtue’s greatness as if in a valley,
Supreme brightness as if in disgrace,
Boundless virtue as if in scarcity,
Established virtue as if in theft,
Sincerity as if in deception—
The great square has no corners,
The great vessel takes time to form,
The great sound is rare in tone,
The great form is shapeless."*

The Dao is hidden, nameless;
Only the Dao, when given and fulfilled, is good.
Before Heaven and Earth came into being,
There was a boundless, formless void—
A vast, hazy *qi* of primordial harmony,
Fermenting for ages,
Until the *qi* transformed and filled the cosmos,
And suddenly, with one awakening, the *Tàijí* opened its foundation.

When it moved, it became *yang*—
Light and clear *qi*, ascending to form Heaven;
When it stilled, it became *yin*—
Heavy and turbid *qi*, descending to form Earth.
Heaven and Earth unfolded,
And beings thrived and multiplied.
Among all the myriad folk,
How few can emulate Heaven and Earth’s functions?

Only the Sage, awakening from the chaos,
Refines the Great Elixir.
With this, one governs the body,
And with this, one cultivates the world.
Though I dare not seal my lips in silence,
Nor teach indiscriminately to all,
Yet in accordance with *yuan* and *yì*,
And adapting to things and beings,
This aligns with Heaven and Earth’s boundless, selfless measure.

At times, I meet the superior scholar—
Hearing my Dao, they joyfully pursue it,
Diligently practice without doubt,
Such a person I have long sought to see.

At times, I meet the middle scholar—
My words pass their lips,
Enter their hearts,
Yet this is commonplace,
Nothing extraordinary,
Though I may love and cherish them,
They quickly lose interest.
Alas, the world’s tastes are thick,
While the Dao’s are thin,
Sagely intent is shallow,
While worldly intent is deep—
Some drift, some settle,
As if storing and forgetting,
And they cannot escape this fate.

As for the inferior scholar,
Their habits deepen daily,
Their *qi* and nature grow perverse—
Hearing my Dao,
They doubt it as heretical speech that misleads the world,
Or accuse it of gathering crowds for profit.
How could they know
That the cultivation of the gentleman begins with the union of *yin* and *yang*?
That the Sage’s Dao is none other than *yin* and *yang*?
That harmony yields life,
While obstruction brings transcendence?
Though their methods differ,
Their principle is one—
Yet the vulgar claim that immortality and sainthood are mere illusions.
How could such cultivation
Ever ascend to the Nine Heavens?
Or else, how could one
Align with Heaven and Earth’s vastness,
And the myriad beings’ flourishing,
Yet remain so constrained in nature?
Why are there so few immortals and sages today?

Thus I laugh at their boastful words,
Their false and eccentric practices.
Alas, this Dao can only be spoken of to those who truly understand—
It is difficult to explain to the shallow and unlearned!
The mayfly does not know of dusk and dawn,
The cicada does not know of spring and autumn,
The well-frog does not know of rivers and seas—
How strange that they should laugh?

One who does not laugh is unworthy of seeing
The Dao’s utmost evenness and constancy,
Its utmost divinity and strangeness—
For divinity and strangeness lie within the ordinary.

Moreover, the Dao has no fixed form or sound,
Yet those of the world who cling to rigid virtue,
Guarding themselves like a cornered beast,
Cannot flow freely and naturally.
I, however, am boundless without bounds,
A unified whole,
Never confined by edges—
How could there be any hesitation?

The Great Elixir’s path is slow to manifest,
Yet its truth is swift to fulfill.

All things that are easily attained are not beautiful to behold,
And those rushed to completion are not great vessels.
I can follow step by step, ascending without expecting swift results,
Not reckoning shallow gains—
Dwelling long in the Dao, it shall surely be accomplished—
Why should I regret myself?

In essence, the Dao is rare in speech, naturally effortless,
Its form vague and elusive.
If I can attain ultimate emptiness and profound stillness,
Then without sound, the Great Sound emerges,
Without form, the Great Form takes shape!

Applied to the four seas, it remains ever true,
Transmitted through ten thousand generations, it knows no end—
How could it merely be revered in one age,
And fail to shine brightly across all ages?

The *Odes* say:
*"In that place, there is no evil,
In this place, there is no decay."*
The Dao’s establishment and practice
Truly possess such divine and wondrous qualities.

Who is it that acts for the Dao?
Who is it that receives from the Dao?
It is also said:
*"To practice the Dao is to lend it and see it fulfilled."*
This speaks of those who embrace the Dao in the world—
Their use is never insufficient,
They nourish all things without depletion,
They encompass the dusty realm with abundance,
And yet bring about the Great Transformation—
Truly, they are the highest of scholars.

The Supreme Sage speaks of those in the world
Who do not conceal their light or cultivate obscurity,
Who establish virtue and refine themselves—
Yet when they gain even a little,
They boast and exalt themselves.

The Five Aggregates are not yet emptied,
The Six Dusts remain impure—
Like a house roofed with thatch,
Fire depends on something to burn.

If one only cultivates oneself without seeking others,
And merges indistinctly into the realm of *wuheyou* [non-existence],
The boundless wilderness—
Even if external harm comes,
It is like lighting a fire in empty space—
It shall surely extinguish itself.

Such cultivation of the self is true cultivation.
Only thus can people dwell in peaceful harmony with the Dao’s natural order,
Otherwise, without attaining the Dao,
They invite blame instead.

Confucius said:
*"To have while seeming to have not,
To be full while seeming empty,
To be boundless while seeming constrained."*
It is no wonder they are despised by others.

Those who cultivate the Dao in this way
Can avoid the anxieties of external concerns
And escape the troubles of external harm.

**Chapter 42: Loss as Gain**
The Dao gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to all things.

All things carry yin upon their backs and embrace yang,
Their harmonizing *qi* is the essence of balance.
What people detest—
The solitary, the orphaned, the bereaved—
The king and duke consider them worthy of honor.

Thus, some things are benefited by loss,
Others are harmed by gain.
What people revere, I also teach:
*"The arrogant and violent shall not meet a natural end."*
I shall take this as my lesson.

The Daoist path, from beginning to end,
Holds emptiness and nothingness as its essence.
The Primordial Heavenly Sovereign,
Called *Xuwu Ziran* [Emptiness-Naturalness],
Is the very meaning of this.

From emptiness comes reality—
This is called true reality.
From nothingness comes existence—
This is called true existence.

If one does not embrace emptiness and nothingness,
Not only are the Seven Emotions and Six Desires
Stifled, blocking the true spirit’s essence,
Leaving no capacity to respond to all things and transform the yang spirit—
Even in observing emptiness and enlightenment,
If one clings with even a trace of forced restraint,
It is but the mind controlling the mind,
Directly obscuring the original face beyond recognition.

In summary: emptiness and nothingness are the Dao’s substance,
Harmonious balance is the Dao’s function.
If people can attain this, the Dao is nearly realized.

The Supreme Sage says, *"The Dao gives birth to One"*—
What does the Dao possess?
Only emptiness.

Yet within ultimate emptiness,
A breath of *qi* stirs—
And thus heaven and earth are born.
Hence it is said:
*"There was a primal chaos, born before heaven and earth."*

Before the Boundless,
It was indistinct and formless—
Only this emptiness.
When it moves, it becomes yang;
When it stirs, it becomes yin—
Thus, *"The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate,
Which gives rise to the Two Principles."*

This is what is meant by:
*"The Dao gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two."*

In the human body,
Within the subtle and obscure,
A single awakening splits—
Heaven and earth open and close,
*Qi* flows in cycles—
Stillness and condensation form yin and essence;
Motion and circulation form yang and *qi*.

If there is no true intention to govern them,
Then yin and yang scatter chaotically,
And there is no way to generate life and attain the Dao.
Thus, between yin and yang,
The Primordial Spirit and true intention are vital to their balance—
This is what is meant by:
*"Two gives birth to Three."*

From this,
One yin and one yang,
One motion and one stillness,
*Qi* flows and transforms,
Its mastery remains unchanged—
And thus all things generate endlessly—
This is what is meant by:
*"Three gives birth to all things."*

Some say:
*"Heaven One generates water—metal generates water;
Earth Two generates fire—wood generates fire;
Heaven Three generates wood—water generates wood;
Earth Four generates metal—earth generates metal."*
Using the Five Phases’ generation to explain
The Supreme Sage’s meaning of *"One, Two, Three, all things"*
Is overly strained—
Better to say the Dao is the Boundless,
One is the Supreme Ultimate,
Two is yin and yang,
Heaven One and Earth Two combine to form Three—
This is the clearest explanation.

*"All things carry yin upon their backs and embrace yang,
Their harmonizing *qi* is the essence of balance,"*
Illustrating that the Dao is the Primordial Emptiness-Naturalness *qi*,
Transforming into yin and yang—
All things’ generation comes from yin and yang.

*"Suong"* (harmonizing) means central—
If yin and yang lack this central harmony,
The center has no master, and the master is unsettled.
Even things struggle to be born—
How much more so for cultivating the Dao?

The *Yijing* says:
*"Heaven and earth blend their threads,
All things refine their essence."*
Thus, the three—*jing* (essence), *qi* (breath), *shen* (spirit)—
Must be complete,
So that yin and yang merge with the Supreme Ultimate and cannot be separated.

If yin and yang exist separately
And the Supreme Ultimate vanishes,
Then the creative power is lost,
And the vital force of all things is extinguished.

In general, cultivating the Dao and refining the elixir
Cannot do without true yin and true yang,
But without the Primordial Harmonious *qi*,
The elixir cannot form,
And the Dao cannot be fulfilled—
For the Dao is originally structured by this Harmonious *qi*.

Generating humans, generating immortals—
It is but one principle,
The difference lies only in obedience or defiance.

The Dao is but this Primordial *qi* as substance,
With yin and yang as its functions—
Thus, the Way of Alchemy is attained.

Observe the kings and nobles, high in station,
Noble in rank,
Yet they call themselves *"gū"* (孤, lone),
*"guǎ"* (寡, few),
*"bùgù"* (不榖, unfulfilled).
What is their intent?

For the lofty are prone to peril,
The full are prone to loss—
Like lightning beneath the sun,
Swift thunder follows.

Only he who does not rely upon his height,
Who does not boast of his nobility,
But instead dwells in humility and gentleness—
Such may long preserve his wealth and honor,
And his kin shall not fall into ruin.

Thus, *"gū"*, *"guǎ"*, *"bùgù"*—
What common folk abhor,
Are the very titles by which kings and nobles refer to themselves.

Then, if the Dao is the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth,
How can those who cultivate it ignore the meaning of humility and gentleness?

*The Shū* says:
*"Fullness invites loss,
Humility invites gain."*

This is without exception.

Gain does not begin with gain,
It must first undergo loss before gain;
Loss does not begin with loss,
It must first undergo gain before loss.

Thus, wealth and poverty,
Indigence and prosperity,
Gain and loss—
When extremes bend, they rise;
When heights rise, they must bend—
This is the Dao’s cyclical flow,
Nature’s immutable course.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot escape it,
How much less can mortals?

Alas, the human Way is such—
What difference is there from the Great Way?

Seekers of the Dao desire a single yang to revive and renew,
Yet first must silence all attachments,
Purely nurturing the Harmonious *qi*,
And severing all restless and grasping thoughts.

If one diminishes again and again,
To the point of nonexistence,
Then within the gathered darkness of all yin,
True yang shall arise,
And the benefit to one’s self shall be great.

But if one boasts of his talent,
Exalts his wisdom,
Then pride shall not be far behind—
None have escaped the error of the discerning spirit,
Or the flames of false fire consuming the body.

To seek gain and instead suffer loss—
This is the general rule of all things under Heaven,
Not merely in the cultivation of the Dao.

As for all worldly affairs,
They are but illusions,
Not worth fixation—
Yet mortals still cling to them as if they were the teachings of the next generation.

Know well: the Great Dao of Alchemy
Is for the present moment,
Yet its consequences last through all ages—
How can it not be taken as law?

The *Tàishàng* (太上) says:
*"What mortals teach, I also teach—*
*Gentleness alone."*

If one does not employ gentleness but instead relies on rigidity,
He shall be like the tyrants of the world,
Who ravage and plunder,
Yet none escape the law’s net
And meet a good end.

Thus, the proud and fierce meet death,
While gentleness and weakness are the path to life—
This is the very essence of Daoist cultivation.

My teaching of others
Emphasizes gentleness and weakness first—
Seekers of the Dao must not neglect this!

*The Wùzhēn* (悟真) says:
*"From emptiness the Dao gives birth to one *qi*,
From one *qi* it produces yin and yang.
Yin and yang thus form the three substances,
And the three substances generate all things in flourishing—*
This is the meaning of:
*'One generates two, two generates three, three generates all things.'*

At the outset of seated meditation,
One must first extinguish all emotional ties,
Sweep away all delusions,
Reach perfect emptiness and stillness,
No different from the dull and the foolish—
Neither fully asleep nor fully awake,
Neither fully asleep nor fully awake.

This is the undifferentiated *qi* of *Hóngmēng* (鸿蒙),
The very image of the Dao.
Suddenly, a spark of awareness stirs,
And the void is pierced by clarity.

After this stirring,
I perceive all phenomena as void,
A single spirit alone in motion—
Embracing the Primordial, guarding the One—
Some call it *true intention*,
Some call it *right mindfulness*,
Some call it *the Buddha’s perfect and equal enlightenment*.

At this moment, there is but one mind,
No duality of thought.

When observing the yang’s emergence and the formation of elixir,
If it thrives and flourishes like the blending of threads,
Then apply the two stages of forward practice:
The first stage is *taking and returning to the palace*,
The second stage is *returning to the furnace and sealing firmly*—
This is the stirring as yang, yang governing ascent;
The stillness as yin, yin governing descent.

Again, examine the strength of the *qi*’s movement:
If it is now fully robust,
Begin the *river vehicle’s* circulation,
The four stages of taking and refining—
Cooking and consuming the elixir,
Drying the self’s mercury.

This is the taking of yang to pair with yin,
Both arising from the One.

As for each inhalation and exhalation,
Each opening and closing—
None are without the One *qi* dividing into two *qi*.
Yet the heart’s essence and kidney’s *qi*,
The heart’s yin and kidney’s yang—
All depend upon the true intention
For their taking, refining, union, and harmonization.

This is the yin and yang two *qi*,
Combined with the true intention as three substances—
All unfolding naturally,
Without contrivance or manipulation.

The key lies in humility and yielding,
The slightest trace of self-exaltation or rigidity—
Small, it may topple the elixir;
Great, it may destroy life itself.

Thus it is said:
*"The rigid and fierce shall not meet their death,
I shall take them as my teachers."*

Learners must know:
Before attaining the elixir,
Rely upon the heart of emptiness and stillness;
After attaining the elixir,
Nurture it with the intention of gentleness and harmony—
Beware of excessive thought and worry,
Of self-aggrandizement and rigidity.

This is the supreme key within the supreme key—
Learners, take heed!

Otherwise, with a heart brimming with delusion,
Where shall the Dao reside?

Such refining is blind refining—
A single piece of rigidity,
Though attained, it shall be lost;
Such cultivation is blind cultivation—
Without elixir or Dao,
Yet rushing to take and refine,
To circulate and transform—
Not only is it wasted effort,
But it shall surely harm the emotions and deplete the essence.

The damage to body and mind is not slight,
Yet they still refuse to blame themselves,
Instead blaming the Great Dao as false,
The Alchemical Elixir as untrustworthy—
Such are they who truly do not know the Dao as the Way!

Only in perfect emptiness and perfect gentleness,
By preserving the heart in stillness,
And nourishing the *qi* in harmony—
Shall the Dao never fail to manifest.

This is to say:
Daoist cultivation, healing disease, prolonging life,
Ascending to immortality, becoming a sage—
It depends upon nothing other than the three treasures: essence, *qi*, and spirit.

Yet essence is not the essence of copulation,
But the Primordial Beginning’s true suchness,
The radiant singular spirit—
As earlier said:
*"Dim and vague, yet within it lies an image."*

From emptiness comes generation—emptiness is the Dao.
*"The Dao gives birth to One"* means emptiness generates essence; essence is nature itself.

Qi is not the breath of inhalation and exhalation, but rather *"the primordial essence of the First Heaven, a single qi diffused"*—as earlier said:
*"Dim and vague, yet within it lies a substance."*

From One comes generation—One is essence.
*"One gives birth to Two"* means essence generates qi; qi is life itself.

Spirit is not the spirit of thought and deliberation, but rather the luminous radiance alone, ever-awake and unobstructed—
as earlier said:
*"Fathomless and dark, yet within it lies essence,
That essence is most true, within it lies trust."*

From Two comes transformation—Two is qi.
*"Two generates Three"* means qi transforms into spirit—
spirit is the true intent of the Primordial Spirit.

All are transformations of the Great Harmony’s singular qi.
Only by nurturing with gentleness and softness shall one attain it.

If one clings to impatience and a hasty heart,
or generates a violent and tyrannical qi,
these are of a different kind—far from the Dao.
Preserving the body is already difficult; how much more to aspire to immortality!
Thus there is the warning against forceful coercion.

The Most High teaches patience and compassion,
and so speaks thus.

Confucius arranged the *Yijing*, thrice emphasizing the *Qian* hexagram,
and through figures like the tilted *Yi* vessel,
he demonstrated his teachings with earnestness—
was this not the same intent?

**Chapter 43: The Benefit of Non-Action**
The utmost softness in the world overcomes the utmost hardness.
There is nothing that enters the unbroken—
thus I know the benefit of non-action.

The teaching of the unsaid, the benefit of non-action—
few in the world attain it.

What is the Dao?
It is the primordial *qi* of Hongmeng.

Before Heaven and Earth opened, this *qi* existed in the void;
after Heaven and Earth split, this *qi* dwelled in Heaven and Earth.
This *qi* existed before Heaven and Earth yet never perished,
and endures after Heaven and Earth yet never ceases.

When Heaven and Earth obtained this *qi*, they became the Dao.
The Dao is Heaven and Earth—
speaking of Heaven and Earth, the Dao is within them.

Only Heaven and Earth could embrace this *qi*,
thus they move endlessly without obstruction.
The *qi* that endures ten thousand years without decay,
the *qi* that flows ceaselessly, nourishing all beings—
this is the same *qi*, interconnected.

The Sage follows Heaven and Earth:
what is sincere within becomes manifest without—
though inner and outer differ, the *qi* is the same;
what is fully realized in oneself becomes accomplished in others—
though self and others differ, the *qi* is one.

What is its nature?
It is emptiness alone.

One thing is connected, and all things are connected;
emptiness is never unclear—
one thing is illuminated, and all things are illuminated.

Confucius said:
*"To govern is like the North Star in its place,
while all stars naturally revolve around it."*

Mencius said:
*"The gentleman transforms through cultivation of spirit,
aligning above and below with the flow of Heaven and Earth."*

This is truly beyond thought or time—
the *qi* naturally permeates, silently and steadily.

Thus it is said:
*"The world’s vastness comes from me, its peace from me.
The multitude of beings comes from me, their nurturing from me.
The distance of past and future comes from me, their connection from me."*

The Sage’s Dao is vast—
truly beyond comparison.

Consider this:
The universe has no end, yet the Dao encompasses it—
how great is it!
Gold and jade are the most rigid, yet the Dao penetrates them—
is it not firm?

Yet it is said in the *Odes*:
*"The mandate of Heaven, solemn and unceasing."*
And again:
*"Heaven’s bearing, without sound or scent."*
This is the utmost softness.

Still, without this *qi*, Heaven and Earth would be inert and useless;
without this *qi*, beings would be dull and lifeless.
With it, they live; without it, they perish.

Thus *"the utmost softness overcomes the utmost hardness"*
—because without *qi*, there would be no things.

Whether vast as the Three Thousand Worlds,
or minute as dust or hair,
all are contained within it.

Not only is it the utmost softness,
but also the utmost nothingness—
is this not what Confucius called:
*"Visible yet unseen, heard yet unheard,
grasped yet intangible?"*

How could there be separation?
Yet when things reach extreme softness, they become useless.
Only the Dao’s utmost softness
can sustain the world’s utmost hardness.

When things reach utter nothingness, what purpose do they serve?
Only the Dao’s utter nothingness
can govern the world’s myriad existences.

This is nothing more than the undivided *qi*,
flowing without obstruction.

Thus the Most High says:
*"I know the great benefit of non-action."*

Moreover, Heaven and Earth act without action yet transform,
the Sage governs without action yet brings order—
how could there be a single being or thing not under its influence?
Is this not because of the *qi*’s all-encompassing and vast reach?

Within the human body, the vast *qi* circulates naturally,
without need for manipulation,
spontaneously irrigating the entire body,
filling every hair—
its benefits are indeed profound.

As for teaching,
the ancients relied on personal example, not words.
The teaching of teaching is not as true
as twice the teaching of non-teaching.

Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons proceed;
the Sage speaks not, yet the world transforms.
To observe the Sage’s natural ease, his loose robes and composed demeanor—
is this not the same path of non-action leading to natural perfection and self-governance?

Thus it is said:
*"The teaching of the unsaid, the benefit of non-action—
few in the world attain it."*

Alas, how lamentable!

This describes the Dao’s natural non-action,
encompassing Heaven and Earth,
nurturing all beings,
rooted in the Great Harmony’s singular *qi*,
flowing through the cosmos,
penetrating Heaven and humanity—
whether vast or minute, hidden or apparent,
all are complete within it.

Thus the utmost softness nurtures the utmost hardness,
the utmost nothingness contains the utmost existence.

Hence, one connection leads to a hundred connections,
one movement sets all in motion—
like an echo in an empty valley,
each sound responds in harmony.

The divine mystery of the Dao—
none can surpass it!
Who but the Sage could truly align with this?

If one is but a novice,
yet possesses true faith and great resolve,
following the Way and keeping to its path,
progressing from shallow to deep,
from low to high,
starting with exertion yet eventually attaining natural ease,
then alone can one penetrate its essence.

One must endure with patience again and again,
bear with forbearance again and again—
through the twelve times of day,
never letting aversion arise,
never abandoning one’s resolve.
Only when deep understanding is gained,
dwelling in tranquility and nurturing life,
finding abundance on all sides,
does one suddenly grasp the intent of the Supreme Dao,
truly without a shred of falsehood.

As for refining the primordial foundation,
the ancients said:
*"When essence is born, there is the time to prepare the medicine;
when the medicine is produced, there is the time to gather it."*

The primordial *qi* of the Dao gives rise to essence,
essence gives rise to *qi*—
this is the principle by which Heaven and Earth generate life,
in accordance with the Way.
If one follows it naturally,
though able to bear sons and daughters,
essence will be consumed, *qi* will scatter,
and life will be exhausted, ending in death.

The Supreme Dao pities mortal beings,
wandering through birth and death,
endlessly cycling through rebirth,
and thus reveals the method of reverse cultivation:
returning to the root, restoring youth to age,
transforming weakness into strength,
so that one may attain immortality and verify sainthood,
forever free from generation and annihilation.

Initially, it teaches one to cultivate emptiness and foster stillness,
beginning from the state of no knowledge, no awareness,
and seeking the realm of knowledge and awareness.
The *Yijing* speaks:
*"Silent and unmoving, yet responsive and thus in harmony—*
this is it."

The essence of post-heavenly cultivation has form,
while the essence of pre-heavenly cultivation leaves no trace—
in that vague, indistinct state,
there is yet something within.
This is called *the opening of the Mysterious Pass*,
*the foundation of the Great Ultimate*—
from here, one must focus the spirit upon emptiness,
unify the *qi* with the void,
illuminate the mind internally,
and observe the breath of each inhalation and exhalation,
its opening and closing,
its ascent and descent,
its gathering and returning to the central palace,
its bathing and nourishment.

In time, at the moment of profound obscurity,
suddenly a thought arises from the rule,
a *qi* emerges from the void—
this is essence giving rise to *qi*.

This *qi* is not of material form—
if it were of material form,
then it would have beginnings and endings,
fixed quantities.
How could it encompass Heaven and Earth,
enter the finest hairs,
penetrate without trace,
shatter without resistance?

This *qi* is the very source of life for all beings—
obtaining it brings life,
losing it brings death.
Though it is the utmost softness,
it can govern even the Sage;
though it is the utmost nothingness,
it can rule all things.
The ancients likened it to medicine,
for it can cure old age and disease,
nurture the immortal embryo.
Thus it is called *"the Elixir of Longevity"* and *"the Nectar of Rebirth,"*
and also *"the True Person’s Root of Immortality"—*
truly the world’s greatest treasure.

The ancients said:
*"A thousand taels of gold cannot buy a single strand of this."*

If mortals can obtain this *qi*,
then eternal life is within reach.

Yet the method of gathering it
must also conform to the central and the proper,
only then will there be no calamity.
If one has the medicine but fails to blend it well,
to brew and refine it properly,
to take it at the right moment,
to nourish it by the correct method,
and if the fire’s strength—whether fierce or gentle—
the medicine’s balance—whether aged or fresh—
and the dosage—whether heavy or light—
are all mismanaged,
then like the inversion of yin and yang,
or the disruption of cold and heat,
it will occur out of season,
bringing forth natural disasters,
and causing all things to perish.

Students who master the Supreme Dao’s preceding chapters,
putting forth effort with precision,
will never err.

I reveal the function here to this single principle—
truly worth more than ten thousand gold.
If one perceives this principle clearly,
then there is mastery everywhere,
the medicine of eternal life can be obtained,
and the realm of the immortals is without difficulty.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The More You Hoard, the More You Lose**

Which is closer to you—name or body?
Which is more abundant—body or wealth?
Which brings greater suffering—gain or loss?

Thus it is said:
*"The more you cherish, the greater the expense;
the more you hoard, the greater the loss."*

Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
knowing restraint brings no peril—
this is how one endures long.

Those who love name and wealth
all believe that name can exalt their body,
and wealth can enrich their body—
if the body lacks name, it will be obscured and unnoticed;
if the body lacks wealth, it will be destitute and unbearable.

Thus, the greedy for name
forsake their body without hesitation;
the covetous of wealth
lose their body without regret.
The *Guozi* says:
*"The avaricious man sells himself for riches,
the valiant man sells himself for name."*

Human nature is such,
and this lament has been the same from ancient to modern times.

Yet consider: which is closer—name or body?
Name is external,
body is internal.
People seek name for the sake of their body—
why then, through name, do they lose their body?
Is it that name is truly close,
while the body is truly distant?

Which is more abundant—body or wealth?
The body is precious,
wealth is base.
All seek wealth for the sake of their body—
why then, through wealth, do they lose their body?
Is it that the body is truly less,
while wealth is truly more?

Think deeply on this!

If one has name but loses their nature,
or has body but lacks name,
which has gained, which has lost?

To abandon the body while wealth remains empty,
or to lose wealth while life is preserved—
which endures, which perishes?

From this perspective,
it is better to gain the body and lose name and wealth
than to gain name and wealth while losing the body.

Moreover, those who love name and wealth
damage their spirit and life,
and their excessive love brings great expense;
those who hoard deeply
employ deceitful schemes,
injure their body and mind—
their hoarding thus brings great loss.

To be held in high regard is to be feared by the state,
to accumulate wealth is to be censured by Nature.
From ancient times onward,
how many have been mighty yet met with misfortune,
rich yet faced execution!

All because they failed to restrain themselves,
did not retreat and conceal,
were insatiable in their greed,
thus inviting hatred from the people
and retribution from Heaven.

Only those who know contentment and restraint
walk the middle path,
remaining stable to the end.
Free from disgrace and peril,
they neither falter nor topple,
and thus long preserve their body,
extending even to their descendants.

When **Fan Li** thus escaped the calamity of **Goujian**,
and **Zhang Liang** attained the leisure of **Chisong’s** wanderings—
truly, they were men who grasped the subtle Dao!

Later seekers shall take heed of this sage teaching.
Here, **contentment and restraint** are likened to **stopping the fire to nurture the elixir**,
with **reputation** as **light** and **wealth** as **medicine**.

Those who covet illusory splendor are often ensnared by demons,
those who labor to transport riches rarely escape misfortune and blame.

Before the medicine returns to the furnace,
one must **stir the fire** to refine it;
once the medicine enters the cauldron,
one must **halt the fire** to preserve it.

If the fire burns **excessively** and one fails to stop it,
not only will the elixir be ruined and the cauldron overturned,
but one will invite sickness and disaster—
even death by flames, and great peril.

And yet, the **Great Dao** is empty and boundless,
with no place for grand distinctions among men.
Some indulge in fine wine and delicacies,
in beauty and adornment,
in gold and jade, pearls and gems,
in pavilions and palaces.

Others face **heavenly demons**, **earthly demons**,
**ghostly demons**, and **spiritual demons**,
all manner of trials that test the **Way**—
some boast of becoming **immortals**,
others claim to be **true persons**,
proudly asserting they have ascended to the **Celestial Hall of Precious Treasures**—
yet in a single distracted thought,
their **spirit and life** are shattered,
and many who pursue the **Great Dao** fail to achieve it.

Again, some revere the **manifestation of the Spirit**,
and **San Shi** become their scourge—
they believe there is a body beyond the body,
and in an instant, their **golden elixir**, their greatest treasure,
is stolen and destroyed.

Such cases, and countless others,
all stem from **unrestrained fire**—
the elixir **reverts** when the fire is not halted,
the **refinement** fails when the **nurturing** is neglected—
thus, their **intentions scatter** while their **spirit perishes**,
their **external pursuits disrupt** their **inner essence**.

For those who cultivate the **Way**,
illusions of **reputation**, **form**, **light**, and **appearance**—
all must be **dismissed with a single stroke**,
held with no attachment whatsoever.
If one thus **knows restraint** and **contentment**,
constantly **nurturing the numinous elixir**,
then one attains **the utmost excellence**,
and **never falters or declines**.

**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Fulfilled as if Deficient**
The great fulfilled appears as if deficient,
yet its efficacy is **unexhausted**.
The great abundant seems as if void,
yet its efficacy is **unending**.
The great upright bends like a bow,
the great skilled feigns clumsiness,
the great eloquent speaks softly.

**Calmness** overcomes **coldness**,
**stillness** surpasses **heat**,
and **serene clarity** is the **true norm** for the world.

The **Dao** is naturally empty and boundless,
moving with the **Heavenly order**,
following **nature’s inclination**,
harmonizing with **Heaven and Earth’s** transformation,
rising and setting with the **sun and moon**—
having nothing yet encompassing all,
doing nothing yet accomplishing all.

When the **Great Dao** is not yet complete or full,
there are still **traces of action**,
some **form and image** may be glimpsed,
and one feels **self-satisfied and content**,
overwhelmed with delight—
until, upon its **great completion**,
it seems as if **deficiencies multiply**,
the **greatly fulfilled** appearing as if **unfulfilled**.

In the **great abundance’s** wake,
it seems **vast and formless**,
the **greatly full** appearing as if **unfull**.

Is this not **the more one studies, the worse one fares**,
or **the more one excels, the more one is censured**?
No.

The **Dao** is the innate perfection of all beings,
pure and empty, still and unmarked—
when **form and spirit** are both wondrously refined,
and one’s **self** merges with **True Reality**,
then **self and Dao** are one—
what **fulfillment** or **abundance** remains?

If **fulfillment** and **abundance** persist,
they are still **dual with the Dao**,
not yet reaching the **domain of divine transformation**.

Thus, those who cultivate the **Way**
**grow in having yet become without**,
**increase yet decrease**,
never perceiving **fulfillment** or **abundance**.

Hence, the **greatly fulfilled** appears as if **deficient**,
and the **greatly abundant** as if **void**.

Therefore, all phenomena are **emptied**,
while **True Reality** stands alone.

**Taking things as conditions**,
**responding to time naturally**—
truly, it **penetrates Heaven and Earth**,
**spans ancient and modern**,
and **applies universally**.

How could its efficacy ever be **exhausted**?
How could its efficacy ever **cease**?

When the mind is empty as the sea,
the spirit still as a mountain,
yet one feels utterly useless—
then suddenly the vast *qi* stretches forth,
most rigid, most great—
how could it be so straight?
Yet in return, one feels the unbearable strain of constraint.

Its marvels are boundless—
how could they be so skillful?
Yet one only feels the stupidity of ignorance.

Words are plain, yet their meaning profound;
speech is concise, yet its logic subtle.
Speaking only when necessary,
uttering only when the time is right—
how could eloquence be so vast?
Yet one only feels stammering,
as if unable to speak at all.

Because of this—
this bending, this clumsiness, this stammering—
the heart aligns with emptiness,
the will aligns with humility,
virtue aligns with breadth,
and deeds grow ever more exalted.

This is truly the Dao’s return to voidness,
learning’s return to spontaneity.
In harmony with Heaven and Earth’s turning,
unaware of the sun and moon’s passage—
thus its greatness endures.

If one follows the *Taiji*’s principle,
aligns with the constant of yin and yang,
and endures prolonged cultivation—
when lead and fire are fully charged,
withstanding nine colds without faltering;
when the elixir is refined and settled,
forgotten after three cycles—
is this not what the *Taishang* meant by:
*"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat"*?

When clarity and purity reside within,
void yet luminous, unencumbered—
returning to the boundless heaven,
embracing the harmonious symbol—
what agitation, what cold, what stillness, what heat remains?

The scholar, possessing a serene and tranquil mind,
transforming the seasons of cold and heat,
concentrates the body’s true *qi*—
thus the true Dao of the world stands firm.
What fear is there of errant paths emerging?

This is the ultimate plainness, the ultimate commonality,
the ultimate emptiness, the ultimate nothingness.
Before one attains the realm of voidness and commonality,
one only perceives fullness, not deficiency;
only perceives advantage, not disadvantage.
Thus the *Taishang* said:
*"The less one has, the more one gains.
The more one has, the more confused one becomes."*
The proverb states:
*"A great bell makes no sound,
a full jar makes no echo."*
Truly not false.

The great virtue is non-virtue—
thus it has virtue.
Great action is non-action—
thus it has action.
Not empty words.

The Dao originates as voidness, one *qi*.
Because of its attainment,
it is without attainment;
because of its lack of attainment,
it is true attainment.
Thus, the higher the Dao,
the lower the heart;
the greater the virtue,
the more humble the will—
this aligns perfectly with the Dao.

If one has any excess,
one boasts arrogantly, swells with pride,
despises others, domineers—
its lack of Dao and virtue is then evident.

Thus the *Taishang* said:
*"In learning, one gains daily;
in the Dao, one loses daily—
lose again, lose again,
until reaching nothingness"—
only then is attainment achieved.

The scholar must not view cultivating the Dao or refining the elixir
like the crafts of a hundred artisans,
deeming progress as personal gain.
If cultivation centers on voidness as its essence,
and reaches the stage of forgetting—
this is progress.
When forgetting is forgotten,
one has entered the realm of transformation.

For the Dao-seeker,
retreat is advancement,
weakness is strength.
Empty becomes full,
nothing becomes something,
reverse becomes upright,
subtraction becomes addition.
Thus, the scholar’s progress or stagnation
depends solely on whether the heart forgets or not.

**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**

When the world has the Dao,
warhorses are driven out to manure fields.
When the world lacks the Dao,
warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No crime is greater than desire,
no calamity greater than discontent.
No fault is greater than greed.

Thus, contentment is true contentment.
When the world has the Dao,
rulers and people alike are at ease.
Conquest is unnecessary,
so horses are released to the forests,
fields are plowed and tilled,
merely to fertilize the land.

When the world lacks the Dao,
chaos has already taken root.
Some act out of necessity,
bandits rise in succession,
weapons clash without cease—
how could warhorses not be bred
to meet the state’s demands?

Thus, the horses’ retreat is because of the Dao,
their proliferation is because of its absence,
and their fate is tied to the world’s great affairs.

Alas!
How could we have rulers who rule,
ministers who minister,
fathers who father,
sons who son,
upholding benevolence, discussing righteousness,
reviving poetry, explaining ritual—
a time when the capital embodies the Dao?

Yet prolonged peace and indulgence
breed desires and greed.
Having this, lacking that,
exotic arts and licentious crafts
are arrayed before them.
Fine clothes and delicious food are insufficient—
they then covet palatial chambers.
A thousand-li domain is still too narrow—
they then lust after ten-thousand-li fiefs.

Alas!
Within, they indulge in moral decay;
without, they indulge in bestiality.
Adding to this, they prioritize profit and swift results,
exhaust resources through warfare,
demand excessively, crave endlessly—
internal and external chaos ensues.
What awaits but ruin?

All this stems from a single desire’s origin.
When desire arises, greed follows;
when greed arises, the unobtained is sought;
when obtained, fear of loss takes hold.

If this continues,
moral order will not collapse,
calamities will not arise,
the state will not fall,
the world will not perish—
this will never occur.

Thus it is said:
*"No crime is greater than desire."*
If desire did not exist,
how could greed arise?
If greed does not arise,
then the winds of superficial harmony, superficial completeness, superficial beauty
would not be difficult to restore.

And it is said:
*"No calamity is greater than discontent."*
If one’s desire does not arise,
this will is always satisfied,
this heart always at ease—
neither seeking from the world
nor harming others.
When success comes, one accepts it;
when failure comes, one accepts it—
where would calamity originate?

Again it is said:
*"No fault is greater than greed."*
If one knows contentment,
one naturally guards one’s portion,
accepts one’s fate,
follows the seasons,
listens to Heaven—
without flattery, without arrogance,
without contention, without seizure—
walking the straightforward path,
long basking in the great harmony—
what fault remains?

When much more, the true heart shines within, the true nature solidifies within.
Cultivate oneself in stillness,
ever finding joy within.
Act in one’s natural station,
without conforming to the external.

Thus, those who naturally hold the world
always preserve their world;
those who hold a state
always preserve their state;
those who hold life
always preserve their life.

What they fear is that once desire arises,
it cannot be pruned away,
ultimately leading to extreme extravagance and insatiable craving—
and no remedy exists.

Is there a Dao to seek the world and obtain it?
From ancient times, gain and loss hinge on a single thought.
A thought once turned astray
becomes a great calamity.
This is how reckless desire brings about boundless ruin.

Life and death depend on the slenderest thread.
If that thread is preserved,
great plans will surely unfold.
This is how mastering the thought
creates boundless blessings.

Thus, one knows that desire, though initially slight,
grows vast in the end—
how can one not be cautious?

Hence it is said:
*"Know contentment, know contentment is always contentment."*
Those who do not know contentment
seek more and lose more,
and in losing, seek even more.
Thus they exhaust their strength and weary their spirit,
toiling endlessly—
what benefit is there?

Do they not know that prosperity and adversity,
gain and loss,
are governed by Heaven,
not by human effort?

Why toil ceaselessly and grow ever more incompetent,
when rest and ease would be the wiser choice?

If one knows contentment,
they follow nature effortlessly,
act without striving—
what need for worry or concern?
Without schemes or grasping,
where could they go without thriving?

Let people take heed!

This likens the world to the human body and the horse to the alchemical use of fire to refine elixirs. If a person is in accord with the Dao, their vital essence is full and their qi abundant—why then refine elixirs? To follow and preserve this naturally is sufficient.

If one lacks the Dao, however, their essence wanes and their qi scatters, forcing them to rely on the primal spirit and true breath to cultivate body and mind. Yet at the outset of practice, they must first nourish the external fields, hence the saying: *"Warhorses are born in the wilderness."* Only when yang vitality arises and medicinal herbs flourish may they proceed with the alchemical methods of advancing fire and withdrawing talismans, the tactics of field battles and fortress defense—until all impurities are purged and pure radiance emerges, as when the world is at peace and the state at ease, and the horses are returned to Hua Mountain, hence the saying: *"Drive the horses back to manure."* Yet the chaos of the world and the peril to one’s self all stem from a single thought of desire. If unchecked, it festers unseen, until essence and marrow are exhausted, and life itself cannot be preserved—how tragic is this?

When desire arises in mortals, they must seek its fulfillment to find satisfaction. Even if all wishes are granted, the abyss of desire is unfathomable, greed insatiable—coveting the next hill after gaining one, endlessly turning without rest. Those who possess the world lose it, and those who possess life—how could they not lose both?

The *Odes* say:
*"Without schemes or grasping, where could they go without thriving?"*
Only those who know contentment may dwell in tranquility, ever abiding in the Dao’s realm. No need for meritous deeds to mend deficiencies—only follow nature, and merge with Heaven.

The *Tao Te Ching* warns: *"No fault is greater than the desire for desire"*—these words teach one to cut off encroaching desires at their root, to guard against subtle transgressions, and to discipline the craft of covetousness, just as Confucius spoke of *"caution in solitude"* and the Buddha taught *"right awareness."* All are one in the Dao.

Have scholars ever glimpsed this truth?

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
*"What is not wrought is perfected."*

The Way lies unseen within the home—
yet one may know the world.
No need to peer through windows—
yet one may perceive the Dao.

The farther one roams,
the less one knows.
Thus the Sage acts without striving yet knows,
sees without gazing yet names,
does without doing yet achieves.

The virtuous one possesses all things within,
yet refines the self without stepping beyond the courtyard.
Yet the shifts of the world’s order,
the changes of human hearts,
and the principles of preserving life while averting ruin,
of reversing chaos into harmony—
all are clearly understood within the mind’s breadth.

Is this mere craft or calculation?
Truly, all things share the same source—
to exhaust the logic of one’s self
is to grasp the logic of all under Heaven.
Thus, without leaving home, one knows the world.

Ancients shaped creation through the mind—
no need to conceal light behind windows—
yet the silent Emperor’s mandate,
the unceasing decree of Heaven,
and the mysteries of growth, decline, and transformation,
of yin and yang’s creative work—
all are fully illuminated within the heart.

Is this mere conjecture?
It is because Heaven and humanity are one continuum—
to cultivate one’s own life
is to align with the Emperor’s decree.
Thus, without gazing through windows, one sees the Dao.

If one wanders abroad, inquiring into the world’s affairs,
or consorts with wise friends, probing the subtleties of Heaven’s will—
one may gain some knowledge.
But if one seeks it not within but without,
not in the self but in externals,
even what is learned will be less than what lies near.

The Way is plain before one’s very door—
why abandon the near for the distant?

Mencius said:
*"Speaking near yet pointing far is good speech,
and guarding brevity while applying broadly is the good Way."*
By this reasoning, learning grows ever nearer yet farther,
ever more concise yet expansive.
How can the near and the concise be neglected?

Thus the Sage embraces unity to encompass the three,
observes emptiness to cultivate stillness,
never stepping beyond the door or hut,
never treading the dusty markets,
dwelling among trees and stones,
roaming with deer and swine,
moving not a step,
consorting with no one—
seemingly lonely and secluded.
Yet when the spirit is steadied, wisdom arises—
though not walking, one surpasses those who do;
though lacking knowledge, one surpasses those who know.

Common folk take what they see as their aim,
but the Sage does not seek what is seen—
thus, all day long, in the unseen and unheard,
one rests from thought and discards artifice;
in what is unseen and unmanifest,
one guards against deceit and covetousness.

With only inner knowing,
and no outward perception—
seemingly obscure and void—
yet the boundless gives rise to life.
Though unseen, it is ever more manifest;
though unnamed, it is ever more established.

As for the myriad beings of the world,
the mysteries of hidden spirits and ghosts—
all are wrought by this Way of non-action.

With order and essentials,
beginning and ending are fulfilled.
What is feared is being ensnared by perception,
fixated on names and forms,
boasting of achievements,
and clinging to opinions—
thus the mind is scattered, unable to unite in virtue,
the heart is mixed, not like the Great Void.
Hence the Way fails to manifest, and virtue does not transform.

No wonder one exhausts a lifetime’s spirit
yet gains nothing.

If applied to governing the world,
one cannot follow principle to perfection—
without action, yet all under Heaven aligns of its own accord.
If applied to cultivating the self,
one cannot refine the void and merge with the Way—
without action, yet the self attains true perfection.
What use is mere external seeking?

Thus the virtuous one must be cautious in solitude,
for the essence of humanity and the origin of Heaven’s decree
are known without seeking.

This speaks of the Way’s foundation in non-action,
and its key in caution in solitude—
thus, without action, there is no failure to act;
without knowing, there is no failure to know.

Yet this is not the lifeless non-action of withered wood and ash.
Earlier, I spoke of *"all phenomena emptied, one spirit alone illuminated"*—
this is the true meaning.
Again, *"one awareness moves, one yang arises"*—
this is the primal qi.

Gathering herbs or refining elixirs
is but the cultivation of these two—nature and life.
Without true meaning, where would nature depend?
Without true qi, how could life be refined?
To gather true meaning with true qi,
when the two merge into one,
it returns to the origin of the Great Polarity—
this is called the Elixir.

Thus, within non-action, there must also be action;
within non-knowing, there must also be knowing and awareness—
only then does one not fall into emptiness or cling to form.
When practice deepens, emptiness becomes form,
and form becomes emptiness.
In time, both are forgotten,
and all things merge in harmony—
thus one attains perfect alignment with the Dao.

If one does not know the Way of humanity,
one may still perceive the Way of Heaven.
Confucius said:
*"Heaven speaks not—
the four seasons proceed, and all things are born."*
This is the essence of non-action.

Non-action is Heaven’s nature,
action is Heaven’s decree;
non-knowing is the original spirit,
awareness is the original qi.
Between Heaven and Earth,
without the two, there is no transformation;
without the one, there is no mystery.
Mysterious yet not mysterious,
not mysterious yet mysterious—
thus one attains the marvel of unity within duality,
of mystery within transformation.

This cannot be fully expressed in words.
It lies with you, the cultivator—
nurture the void and the still,
constantly guard the empty and the luminous,
and thus nature and life will endure,
while the Great Way may be fulfilled.

Do not confuse non-action with action,
nor cling to one side—
though it be the true path,
divergent roads will open.
Consider this well.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
To practice the Way is to daily diminish,
to study is to daily increase.
To practice the Way is to daily diminish—
diminish again and again,
until one reaches non-action.
In non-action, there is no failure to act.

Thus, those who take the world
must act with non-interference.
When interference arises,
it is insufficient to take the world.

Scholars memorize words and chapters,
and artisans seek teachers and friends,
gathering much knowledge and hearing much—
only then do talent and wisdom emerge,
and skill and cleverness arise.

The wider one’s knowledge and the more one acts,
only then can one wield the brush to compose with ease,
or swing the axe to shape with mastery.
Thus it is said: *"To study the Way is to daily increase."*

But to practice the Dao is the opposite.
If one engages in extensive reading and broad familiarity with ancient texts,
yet fails to turn inward and reflect,
to guard the heart with singular focus—
then though one gathers knowledge and multiplies insights,
the mind will scatter and the spirit will falter.
Though learning grows, the Dao recedes,
until at last one is lost in the boundless *Tai Ji*,
drowned without trace.

Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must strip away like peeling a banana leaf,
draw out like unraveling silk—
the more one strips, the less remains;
the more one draws, the more empty it becomes,
until one reaches the realm of *wu-wu* (non-nonbeing).
Only then has one attained it.

When cultivation reaches this stage,
naturally one’s mysteries are unfathomable,
one’s transformations boundless:
When gathered, there is presence;
when dispersed, there is absence.
Desire one thing, and it is one;
desire ten thousand, and it is ten thousand.
The sun, moon, and stars revolve at my command;
the winds, clouds, thunder, and rain obey my designs.

What is its grandeur?
Yet scholars, grasping one principle while discarding another,
like eating sugarcane—
eating it all, then casting it aside,
still return to nothingness.
Thus it is said: *"To practice the Dao is to daily diminish,
diminish again and again,
until one reaches non-action."*
In non-action, there is no failure to act.

Observe those who seek to take the world—
they must not hesitate to raise armies and mobilize troops,
to brandish weapons and clash steel.
How can there be *wu-shì* (non-affairs)?
Yet within the chaos of affairs,
one must return to *wu-shì*,
only then can one unite heart and virtue,
and devise strategies in seclusion.
Then the mind will not scatter,
and wise counsel will emerge.

Thus, commanders issue strict orders:
ears hear nothing external,
eyes see nothing external,
the heart wanders not to external schemes—
only then can one adapt to circumstances,
and take the world as easily as turning the palm.
Otherwise, in endless agitation,
the more affairs, the more disordered the mind;
the more disordered the mind, the more dimmed the spirit.
Before the enemy even arrives, one cannot remain composed,
and at the first clash of arms, the ranks dissolve in chaos.
To hope for victory in such a battle—
how difficult is it not to be?

What of when the eastern barbarians are not yet pacified,
and the western nomads rise anew—
one crisis not yet resolved, another erupts—
if one does not master stillness to govern movement,
or ease to await exhaustion,
few escape defeat and ruin.
In antiquity, those who fled in defeat,
whose cities fell in ruin,
all succumbed to the perils of *you-shì* (affairs).

Thus, military strategy employs tactics of deception and ambush.
When the enemy sees banners filling the horizon,
trees trembling like soldiers,
even facing a great foe, they are struck with dread,
and few dare not flee at first sight of the wind’s warning.

Only by treating affairs as if they were nonexistent,
abandoning all entanglements,
and focusing the heart inward—
like Zhuge Liang amid a million troops,
his hair unbound, fan in hand, effortlessly composed—
could he secure the survival of Shu,
and prolong the Han dynasty in its hour of peril.
But if one’s heart is entangled in affairs,
then the mind is already disordered,
the spirit masterless—
like Xu Shu, who could no longer offer counsel
when his mother returned to Cao Cao,
and thus failed to aid the First Emperor in restoring the realm.
How could such a one ever take the world?

This speaks to those who cultivate the Dao:
if they see only increase, not diminution,
then their mind grows dim and the Dao fails to coalesce.
Thus it is said: *"Virtue is singular;
two or three, and it grows dim."*
Only by refining and forgetting in turn,
forgetting and refining in turn,
does one not become an obstacle to the Dao.
If memory clings without release,
chattering endlessly—
this is indeed the Dao’s greatest concern.
Thus, one must gradually dissolve and extinguish
until there is nothing left at all.
Only then is nature fully realized.

Then, from nonbeing arises being,
and one can move unseen among spirits,
transformations beyond measure.
The scriptures say that *"the world"* symbolizes the Dao,
*"taking the world"* symbolizes cultivating the Dao,
*"affairs and non-affairs"* symbolize *you-wu* (action and non-action).
If one can remain pure and non-acting,
one is purely *xiantiān* (primordial) *qi*—
how difficult is it then to attain the Dao?
This is the essence of taking the world.

But if one clings to forced action,
it is all *hou-tian* (later-heaven) contrivance,
and one falls into a side path.
This is the opposite of taking the world.

Some may ask: *"How can alchemy and elixirs be non-action?"*
Know this: one follows the ascent as it ascends,
not forcing it to rise;
one follows the descent as it descends,
not forcing it to fall.
Even if gathering is endless,
and refining methods are manifold—
it is all pure spontaneity,
without a trace of contrivance.
Though there is action, it remains *wu-wéi* (non-action).

Those who merely swallow saliva and breathe *qi*
can never obtain the elixir or attain the Dao.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
**The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**

The sage has no fixed heart,
but takes the hearts of the people as his own.
To the virtuous, I am virtuous;
to the wicked, I am also virtuous—
thus virtue is complete.
To the trustworthy, I trust them;
to the untrustworthy, I also trust them—
thus virtue is sincere.

The sage dwells in the world,
blending his heart with the people’s.
All eyes and ears are fixed upon him,
yet the sage treats them like children.

The sage’s heart is empty, hollow, clear, and luminous—
nothing is excluded from its perception,
yet nothing is obscured within it—
like a still mirror reflecting the moon,
its radiance shooting in all directions.
It responds to each thing as it is,
without preconceived intent—
how vast is its clarity!
It encompasses the great without exclusion,
embraces the small without omission—
beauty and ugliness, good and evil,
none escape its grasp—
how boundless is its capacity!

Yet what is this heart?
It neither forces nor resists nature—
thus it is said: *"The sage has no fixed heart."*
Meaning the sage does not anticipate before arrival,
nor clings when it has passed—
only now is present, without attachment.
It is nothing but adapting to circumstances,
responding to each moment,
taking the hearts of the people as his own.

And what is the people’s heart?
Only to love the good and hate the evil.

Thus the sage treats the people’s goodness with encouragement and praise,
and the people’s unvirtuousness without failing to guide and lead them toward the good.
Both goodness and unvirtuousness, the sage encompasses with boundless virtue/power.
The good are moved with joy and devotion, ever more striving to be virtuous;
the unvirtuous awaken with resolve, transforming their ways to follow the good.
This is **"virtue/power of goodness"**—
when the ruler cherishes goodness, none dare fail to comply.
The workings of response and transformation are such,
and none can escape their natural unfolding.

The sage also treats the people’s faithfulness with reverence and elevation,
and the people’s disbelief without failing to love and admire them.
Both faith and doubt, the sage unites with sincere, undivided embrace.
The faithful find peace and clarity, deepening their trust;
the doubters rise with vigor, abandoning disbelief to embrace faith.
This is **"virtue/power of sincerity"**—
when the ruler cherishes sincerity, none dare act without genuine feeling.
The principle of giving and receiving is so profound,
that none can doubt its divine effect.
The people’s virtue returns to its natural simplicity—
why should there be any hesitation?

Since all share the same heart,
and all hearts follow the same principle,
the sage views all hearts with one mind,
and aligns all principles with one truth.
Though the world be vast, he contains it with sincerity;
though the people be numerous, he unites them with righteousness.
Even among the wise and deceitful, the loyal and false,
all are treated with equal fairness—
greatly impartial, without self.
With open sincerity and public fairness,
he places his heart in theirs,
blending all under heaven into one principle—
the people daily advance in goodness without knowing it.
The marvel of his transformative influence
is far beyond the later ages’ exhortations to filial piety and loyalty,
or teachings of propriety and righteousness.

Thus it is said: *"He blends the hearts of all under heaven with simplicity."*
He sees all under heaven as one family,
unites the realm as one person—
his benevolence and compassion embrace all,
as one with the people in this way.
Thus the people submit to his virtue/power and cherish his benevolence,
loving him as their parents,
revering him as gods,
looking up to him like teachers and guardians.
Whatever they hear or see,
they always measure it against the sage’s words and bearing—
none know anything beyond this.
Hence it is said: *"The people fix their ears and eyes upon the sage."*

The people’s expectation of the sage is such—
yet what other way does the sage have?
Only to govern the multitude with gentleness,
to lead the people with compassion—
like parents to their children:
whether wise or foolish, clever or dull,
his love is the same;
he lifts them up and protects them,
guiding them with sincerity.
If the world has any who cannot be transformed,
such do not exist.
This is the governance of *wuwei*—
how distant it is from those who rely on words and laws!

In the scriptures, **"the sage"** is a metaphor for the heart,
**"all under heaven"** for the body.
The sage’s cultivation of the self
is nothing but nurturing the fundamental spirit and fundamental qi.
Yet since humans have fundamental spirit, they also have ordinary spirit;
since they have fundamental qi, they also have ordinary qi.
At the outset of practice,
how could one not summon other thoughts,
or fail to stir ordinary breath?
Only those who understand the Dao and cultivate it for long
will see the fundamental spirit arise.
If I treat it with an even mind,
even if other thoughts remain unbanished,
I still treat it with an even mind.
If the fundamental spirit has any who cannot see it,
such do not exist.
Once the fundamental spirit is born,
cultivation of the Dao has a foundation—
one must then quietly guard the elixir field,
and regulate and nourish the fundamental qi.
If, at this time, the fundamental qi moves on its own,
I must treat it with harmonious qi—
even if ordinary qi has not yet ceased,
I must still treat it with harmonious qi.
If the fundamental qi has any who cannot make it arise,
such do not exist.

One must know:
the fundamental spirit is obscured by ordinary spirit,
like a bright mirror long sealed by dust—
if not quickly polished and washed,
how could it suddenly become clear?
The fundamental qi is drowned by ordinary qi,
like white silk stained by oil—
if not well cleansed and rinsed,
how could it return to its original state?

At this point, if one generates a single restless thought,
or stirs a single harmful intention,
it is as if seeking the fundamental spirit as one’s true self,
while the ordinary spirit only grows stronger.
To seek to see one’s true nature—
is this not difficult?
To seek to restore one’s fundamental qi—
is this not a great challenge?

Only the sage’s governance of all under heaven
does not distinguish between goodness and evil, sincerity or falsehood—
he treats all with a heart of benevolence and loyal simplicity:
the good he treats as good,
the unvirtuous he also treats as good;
the faithful he treats as faithful,
the unbelieving he also treats as faithful.
A sphere of pristine simplicity,
blended in his embrace.
This is emptiness—
this is the Dao.
Emptiness naturally gives rise to spirit,
the Dao naturally gives rise to qi.
There is nothing that does not come naturally in response.

Otherwise,
if the heart is not emptied,
there is no Dao from the start—
and if one seeks to conquer the spirit’s obscurity,
or make the Dao’s qi endure,
how could this be attained?

The cultivation of the self and governance of the world
share the same Dao,
and the principles are one without division—
to know how to govern the world is to know how to cultivate the self,
to understand external causes is to understand internal principles.
Thus, to illustrate this principle,
its teaching to the learner is most profound and intimate.

The student must diligently guard the true constant,
and skillfully nourish the emptiness—
then the fundamental spirit and fundamental qi
will naturally return to their original state.
If one generates even a single extraneous thought,
or stirs a single extraneous breath,
one may fear that without cultivation, the Dao cannot be attained,
and the more one cultivates, the further the Dao recedes.
Let the student be cautious and warned!

**Chapter Fifty: The Profound Nurturing of Generation**
Birth and death.
Those who cultivate birth alone number thirteen;
those who cultivate death alone number thirteen;
those who cultivate life—
moving toward death—also number thirteen.
Why is this so?
Because of the profound nurturing of *generation*.

「For those who skillfully govern life,
walking upon land they meet no rhinoceros or tiger,
entering battle they are not struck by armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to lodge its horn,
the tiger finds no opportunity to strike with its claws,
and weapons find no opening for their blades.
Why is this so?
Because they dwell in the realm of no death.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth in generating beings,
though countless transformations and changes occur,
without end or limit,
yet their Way does not exceed
the interplay of yin and yang—
swelling and waning, advance and retreat,
preservation and annihilation.
Between these lies nothing beyond
the flow of *Taiji*'s principle and qi.
Life and death are but day and night.
Day and night cycle endlessly,
their motion ceaseless,
just as life and death cycle,
endlessly alternating without cessation.
Yet within this bending and extending,
this coming and going,
the fundamental nature remains
a duality of opposing forces,
with no deviation.

Speaking of those who traverse birth and death,
ten out of thirteen meet yang-qi and live,
and ten out of thirteen encounter yin-qi and die.
Those who do not conform to Heaven and Earth’s constant yin-yang,
who gain yang and live yet remain like others—
after birth, their knowledge unfolds and desires arise,
senses are stirred by material cravings and actions multiply,
thus they exhaust their vital essence and deplete their spirit,
shortening their lifespan and forfeiting their fate—
these are the ones who move toward death’s domain,
also ten out of thirteen.
Thus the number of those who live
does not surpass those who die;
the power of yin
exceeds that of yang.

The principle and qi of *generation* and *transformation*,
do they not fear exhaustion?
Yet the origin of *Taiji* is
soundless and odorless—
when it moves, yang is born;
when it stirs, yin emerges.
It manifests as the Five Phases,
scatters as myriad things,
exhausting all oddities and variations,
beyond speech or name,
yet never lacking.
Thus, when one follows its course,
life flows endlessly;
when one opposes it,
all returns to the root.

When life is extinguished, death takes its place;
when death is still, life stirs anew—
this is the Way of *generation* and *transformation*,
the virtue of utmost sincerity in the numinous,
embedded within it,
from the beginning of all things to this day,
unchanged.

If not so,
all things would have life but no death,
and the teeming multitude would fill the cosmos,
leaving no room for Heaven and Earth,
nor the means to nurture life.
This is why the waxing and waning,
the swelling and emptying,
serve to uphold the principle of life.

If one knows the profound nurturing of Heaven and Earth’s *generation*,
it lies in this waxing and waning, swelling and emptying.
Thus, one observes the Way of Heaven,
follows Heaven’s course—
within the killing mechanism, they seek the life-giving,
and from death’s grasp, they draw vital qi.
They embody the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter,
and contain the functions of growth, flourishing, gathering, and storing.

By guarding in harmony yet acting in opposition,
Heaven and Earth nurture and transform all beings,
and thus maintain their eternal, unobstructed state;
the human body returns to its origin,
to become a sage of extraordinary virtue,
eternal and unchanging—
all this arises from the same source.
This is not the task of the feeble!

Only those who excel in governing life
employ the inverted methods of yin and yang,
the counteracting ways of *generation* and *transformation*—
descending to ascend,
advancing to retreat;
stilling to observe the natural,
moving to await yang’s emergence;
urgently driving the celestial stem,
leisurely guarding the alchemical furnace;
returning to *Taiji*,
restoring to utmost sincerity;
exiting with entering, nonexiting with exiting—
enduring from ancient times to the present;
aligned with sun and moon,
united with Heaven and Earth…
Thus, even when confronting great trials,
they find no obstacle impassable.
Even fierce as rhinoceros or tiger,
they dissolve into kindred harmony;
even sharp as armor or blades,
they vanish as if never existed.

Why then fear the rhinoceros’s horn,
the tiger’s claws,
or the weapons’ strike,
and calculate life and death,
existence and annihilation,
in a single moment?
Why is this so?
Because they dwell in the realm of no death.»

「Moreover, the Sage refines their nature and establishes their fate over years.
When gathered, they take form;
when dispersed, they become *qi*.
The sun and moon revolve at my command,
the winds and thunders obey their summoning.

Though rhinoceros and tiger rage fiercely,
and weapons may seem formidable,
how can they reach what has no form?
For only the formless can master the formed—
never the formed compel the formless!

Alas, all things with form have life and death,
but the Sage, formless, transcends them.
They govern the source of life and death—
all things see them as life and death,
yet what calamity or harm can they inflict?
This is the tenfold *Dao* of Heaven and Earth’s completeness,
the threefold interplay of *yin* and *yang*.

Humans draw upon the *yang* of *Buqian* (乾) for birth,
and meet the *yin* of *Bunkun* (坤) to die.
This is the fundamental principle of *Taiji*—
the interplay of *yin* and *yang*,
flexing and extending,
cycling endlessly in cause and effect.

Without *yin*, *yang* cannot manifest;
without death, life has no meaning.
Thus, retreat and repose are but ways
to nurture the profound *virtue/power* of life’s continuity.

Yet in their abandon to passion and desire,
where reason perishes and humanity is lost,
their death differs from others.
For those who follow *yin* and *yang* in life and death
are truly embraced by *Taiji*’s boundless essence,
their *true qi* flowing in harmony with the two principles.

But those who defy Nature’s *yin-yang* cycle
have lost their original *yuan qi* (元气),
and are overwhelmed by excessive *yin* and malevolent forces.

Hence, they are said to be *“ten with three”* (十有三).
The ten represents completeness—*Dao* encompassing Heaven and Earth;
the three comes from Heaven’s *One* (天一) generating Water,
Earth’s *Two* (地二) generating Fire,
and the union of Heaven’s *One* and Earth’s *Two* forming Water and Fire’s threefold harmony.

Moreover, Heaven’s *One* generates Water,
and Metal also generates Water;
Earth’s *Two* generates Fire,
and Wood also generates Fire—
thus the four symbols are complete.

The Earth has no fixed position,
wandering through the four symbols,
and in its purest, most refined essence—
the *Dao*’s ultimate substance—
it governs *yin-yang qi*,
drives the mechanisms of creation,
and in Heaven and Earth becomes *Wujiji* (无极).

Yet *Taiji*’s principle in the human body:
stillness brings forth the *yuan shen* (元神) of soundless purity,
unity without duality;
movement manifests *liang zhi liang neng* (良知良能) in timely action—
*true intent*.
Together, they form the Five Phases.

This is the shared *virtue/power* of life’s continuity
for Heaven, Earth, and all beings—
present in all things,
or returning to the boundless *Taixu* (太虚),
unchanged by life and death’s rise and fall.

Thus, those who skillfully cultivate life
enter their chambers in quietude,
observing the *One yang*’s return and renewal,
and drawing it upward, downward,
or back to the alchemical furnace for nourishment.
With ninefold transformations complete,
the fire’s essence is fully refined.

This is the *Dao*’s height—
where dragons and tigers submit,
and the *virtue/power* is so profound
that even ghosts and spirits yield.
What harm then from rhinoceros, tiger, or blade?

Consider the ancients:
dwelling in secluded mountains,
with rhinoceros and tigers in throngs,
and wolves as companions,
yet willingly tamed,
content in their own boundless freedom—
many such examples exist.

Or single-riding warriors
who command the loyalty of warlords,
who abandon armor and weapons,
revered as divine,
loved as kin—
such devotion arises from *Dao*’s profound *virtue/power*.

And when filial piety moves Heaven,
or bandits surrender in sincerity;
when chastity and righteousness stand firm,
and deceitful hearts are stilled—
all these stem from the *virtue/power* of utmost sincerity.

Observe again:
the rhinoceros cannot strike with its horn,
the tiger cannot grasp with its claws,
the weapons cannot find purchase—
truly, this is no falsehood.

Essentially, the *One yuan*’s *li qi* (理气)
is not the *yin-yang* of creation.
I can remain serene and bright,
formless yet luminous—
what then of life and death?

Those who know life and death
are bound by its traces,
but I can erase those traces,
returning to the undivided *ming* (命),
the *Taihe* (太和) of Heaven.
Though traces of life and death may appear,
the principle endures unobstructed—
why then rejoice in life,
or dread death?

The ancient Sages chose *yi* (义) over life,
sacrificed their bodies for *ren* (仁).
They saw knives and saws as commonplace,
and boiling cauldrons as trifles—
why was this so?
Because they found *Dao* within,
and knew no fear without.

Hence it is said: *“the realm of no death.”*

And the sevenfold completion of Water,
united with the tenfold, makes thirteen.

**Chapter 51: Reverence for the Dao and Esteem for Virtue/Power**
The *Dao* gives birth,
*virtue/power* sustains it;
things take form,
and forces complete them.
Thus, all things reverence the *Dao* and esteem *virtue/power*.

The *Dao*’s reverence,
the *virtue/power*’s nobility—
none command them, yet they endure naturally.
The *Dao* gives birth,
*virtue/power* sustains it,
nurtures and matures it,
refines and perfects it,
covers and protects it.
It births without possession,
acts without reliance,
nourishes without domination—
this is *xuan de* (玄德), the profound *virtue/power*.

The *Dao* has no name,
and without a name, it is *Wujiji* (无极).
This is the pure *qi* of emptiness—
the foundation of life’s continuity
for Heaven, Earth, and all beings.
For it is neither presence nor absence,
neither vast nor minute—
it encompasses and covers all things without distinction,
hence called *“Great Virtue/Power”* (大德).

The *Dao* is the shared *Taiji* of all things;
the *virtue/power* is each thing’s individual *Taiji*.
Thus, all things draw upon life’s source,
rooted in *Taixu*’s principle,
and the *One yuan*’s *qi* spreads boundlessly.

No matter their size or subtlety,
all rely on the *Dao* for life,
and entrust their essence to fate’s decree.
Within them, *yin-yang* harmonize,
and the sun and moon revolve—
like grasses and trees:
resting in day and night,
nourished by dew and rain,
and thus their roots are cultivated.

This is the *Dao* giving birth,
and *virtue/power* sustaining them.
All things, receiving this nurturing,
emit a fragrant influence—
first as *qi*, then as form.
By this, they grow unseen yet steadily,
day by day, month by month,
until humans become fully human,
and things attain their own perfection without flaw.

Thus, all things reverence the *Dao* and esteem *virtue/power*.
For the *Dao* is the principle of life’s creation—
without it, life cannot be sustained.

*Virtue/power* is the origin of nurturing all things—
without it, there is no way to store and cultivate.
How exalted is the *Dao*, how noble is *virtue/power*?
Yet both are granted from Heaven,
and take things as their occasion.
No need for forced action—
naturally aligned with the *Dao*.
Without contrivance, *virtue/power* is spontaneously fulfilled.
No one commands it, no one ordains it,
yet ever thus—
nothing coerced, all returns to nature.

What *Dao* is this?
The grand central path of Heaven and Earth,
the essential key for sages to attain immortality and enlightenment.
If one seeks to cultivate the Golden Immortal,
how else but through the *Dao*?

Thus, one concentrates the spirit in emptiness,
unites the *qi* in boundlessness.
At the threshold of void and stillness,
a single *yuan*’s true *qi* emerges—
this is the birth of the *Dao*.

Once the *Dao* arises,
one then nourishes it in stillness,
draws from it in motion.
Hold fast to the One,
and all phenomena dissolve into emptiness.
Ever maintain, never forget, never assist—
then *virtue/power* has its foundation.

Follow the *Dao* in its unfolding,
and the *Dao* will grow daily.
Nurture *virtue/power* in its essence,
and *virtue/power* will flourish daily.
To grow and nurture—
like things thriving in abundance,
until autumn arrives and ripeness is assured.

When the *Dao* is thus complete and ripe,
its cultivation and preservation—
what differs from humanity?
It is but returning to the unformed origin,
restoring the undivided truth.

Ultimately, what is this "generation"?
Its generation is the self-moving *qi* of void.
Why claim it as mine to possess?

Even when the signs of *yang*’s birth appear—
internally circulating the Heavenly Canopy,
externally pushing the Dipper’s handle—
it seems like action,
yet purely entrusted to nature,
without the slightest contrivance—
not acting, yet not relying on action.

Thus, as *virtue/power* advances daily and the *Dao* lengthens,
the transformations of *wen* and *wu* unfold,
and the bath of sealing solidifies—
all governed by the original spirit.
This is having a master yet no master,
no ruler yet a ruler present.

Such cultivation—
how deep and distant the *Dao* becomes!
Thus it is called *"Xuan De"* [Mysterious Virtue].

**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**
The world has its origin,
which becomes the mother of the world.
Having obtained its mother,
one knows its child;
having known its child,
one returns to guard its mother—
thus, no danger in life’s end.
Close the *xuè* [mouth], seal the gate,
and labor ceases for life’s span.
Open and return to clarity—
no harm befalls the body—
this is called *"clinging to constancy."*

The essence of the Golden Elixir—
what else is it?
Only the primordial *yuan*’s true *qi*,
which the ancients likened to true lead,
to golden blossoms,
to white snow,
to the *White Tiger*’s first crescent *qi*—
all metaphors for the same:
when *Kàn* [Heaven] and *Kūn* [Earth] unite,
*Kàn* loses a *yang* and descends into *Kūn*’s palace,
while *Kūn* receives this *yang*’s true golden nature,
thus solidifying into *Kǎn* [water].
Hence, the elixir is called "golden"—
it falls from *Kàn*’s domain,
known in the body as *yang* essence.
Though dwelling in the water palace,
it is the primordial *qi*,
the mother for elixir cultivation.

The adept, standing before the furnace,
must press the *yang* lead from the water palace
to serve as the elixir’s mother.
Thus it is said:
*"All the body’s blood is pure yin,
The body’s yang essence, none recognize."*
This essence—
neither within nor without,
not entering the six senses’ gates,
not among the six dusts—
hidden in the form’s mountain,
seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard,
yet ever generating—
the true seed, the great root of the body.

If the *yin* essence lacks this primordial *yang* lead as its mother,
the *yin* essence scatters easily,
with no way to congeal into the elixir.

The *qi* thus is the same as that of all sentient beings—
boiled and refined in the cauldron and furnace;
then the primordial *Dao*’s *yang* essence and the ultimate *yin* essence,
emerge from the void’s extreme stillness and profound obscurity—
this is the elixir’s mother, also the mother *qi*.

With *yang* fire pressing it,
it ascends in flight to the *níhuáng* (泥丸),
mingling with long-accumulated *yin* karma and dissolving,
descending to the upper palate,
transforming into sweet dew—
this is the *yin* essence, also called *ziqi* (子气).

From this point, it descends to the *Chónglóu* (重楼),
pouring into the divine chamber,
to be ingested and swallowed,
nurturing the gentle divine fire,
adjusting and nourishing this primordial *Dao*’s *yang* essence and ultimate *yin* essence.
Thus, the *Tàishàng* (太上) says:
*"Once the mother is obtained, the child is known;
Once the child is known, return to guard the mother."*
At first, the mother clings to the child and comes,
then the child clings to the mother and dwells,
and finally, the child and mother unite in harmony and mutually nurture,
as *yin* and *yang* reverse and merge in oneness—
though the body perishes, no harm befalls.

From this moment, firmly adhere to the central rule:
one soul internally contained,
ensuring that internal thoughts do not stray outward,
external thoughts do not intrude inward,
keeping silent and sealing the six gates,
softly and subtly, unchanging and unceasing,
neither helping nor forgetting,
acting or not acting as if diligent or not.
Thus throughout life, the *Jīnxiān* (金仙) attainment is realized.

Otherwise, if one seeks external gains,
one has already lost the internal treasure.
As it is said:
*"When the mouth opens, the divine *qi* scatters;
When the mind is disordered, the fire’s power wanes."*
Heeding the external while neglecting the internal—
the life’s essence is already spent,
where then is the life’s root?
Thus, it is unsalvageable throughout one’s life.

If a person can close the *duì* (兑) and seal the gates,
preserving the essence and abundance of *qi*,
merging the mother *qi* and child *qi* into the elixir,
the ancients said:
*"The Primordial Emperor of the *Yuánshǐ* (元始) suspended a single millet-seed pearl in the void,
seemingly present yet not present,
seemingly empty yet not empty—
only those who silently recognize and merge their hearts can perceive it.
None are smaller than this elixir;
those who can see it are truly wise."*

When the *yang* essence arises,
the entire body softens like silk—
this is the utmost gentleness.
If one can guard this gentlest *qi*,
without mingling a single thought,
without adding a single perception,
over time, it will naturally give rise to vast, surging *qi*,
piercing the heavens and passing through the sun.
Thus, *"Guarding softness is called strength."*

However, at the outset,
the divine light descends to illuminate the *qìhǎi* (气海),
then the fire steams and the water boils,
the golden essence radiantly manifests,
like tides, like flames,
like mist, like smoke—
then I must withdraw my sight and return my hearing,
protecting its brilliance,
guiding it back to the earthen cauldron,
restoring it to my primordial *yīqì* (一气).
If small, it repels illness and prolongs life;
if great, it achieves immortality and sainthood—
what harm can the body suffer then?
Otherwise, old age, sickness, and death,
come swiftly—
how can one not grieve?
All this is self-made;
the heavens do not predestine such limits.

If a person does not cherish the *Dao*,
do they not at least cherish their body?
Do not abandon your body to calamity—
regret will come too late.

This is the *Dao* of True Constancy,
only the Sage can follow its constancy,
without defying its way.
Thus, day by day, month by month,
they reach the divine and boundless,
the ever-changing and unfathomable.
The saying goes:
*"Steadfastness is the foundation for sainthood;
a vacant heart is the vessel for the *Dao*."
How can one neglect this?*

This refers to the true *yang* essence,
which originates from the moment one receives *qi* and forms the body.
Life arises from *qi*;
how can *qi* be trifled with?
Consider before birth—
was there not already this *qi*?
After death—
this *qi* is not necessarily extinguished.
The primordial *yīqì* (一气) hangs suspended in the great void,
wherever there is form, *qi* is within it,
wherever there is no form, *qi* returns to the great void.
All things within heaven and earth,
with tangible manifestations,
have birth and death to speak of,
but this *qi* neither generates nor perishes,
neither defiles nor purifies,
neither increases nor decreases—
empty yet not empty,
not empty yet empty,
most divine and most wondrous—
thus it is the initial *qi* for all things under heaven to sustain life ceaselessly.
If a practitioner of the *Dao* knows this initial *qi*,
then the way of longevity can be attained,
and the station of the Immortals can be realized.

The Immortals have no other marvel,
merely clinging to the *yang* essence and nurturing the *yin* essence,
refining them endlessly—
then the *yin* essence transforms into *yang* essence,
and the *yang* essence returns to *yang* spirit,
as it is said:
*"This body is not the body of a mortal,
but the body of an Immortal from the *Dàluó* (大罗) Heaven."*

If one were to cultivate only one aspect,
how could one attain the marvel of both form and spirit,
united with the True *Dao*,
reaching the utmost extremes of transformation,
and achieving the most saintly and enlightened state?
Thus, when the fire’s time arrives,
the golden elixir manifests,
naturally forgetting speech,
forgetting taste,
forgetting smell,
seeing yet not seeing,
hearing yet not hearing—
as it is said:
*"The elixir field holds treasure,
naturally forgetting all emotions when confronted with phenomena."*

This is the principle of valuing the internal over the external,
guarding the internal while forgetting the external—
an immutable law.
Yet before obtaining the elixir,
one must still close the *duì* (兑) and seal the gates,
to accumulate essence and *qi*.
Know that the small elixir is the mark of wisdom,
and guarding the *Tàihé* (太和) brings natural strength.

Entering *qi* with the spirit,
storing the spirit within *qi*—
suddenly, a single millet-seed pearl,
its light illuminating the *dharma* realm—
this is the golden elixir’s radiance,
the moment when the Great *Dao* is about to manifest.
At first, the spirit descends to await the *qi*,
then the *qi* arises,
and again the spirit presses it upward,
drives it back to its source—
thus the elixir of longevity is obtained,
and what harm can the body suffer?

This is achieved by constant vigilance,
unceasingly flowing forth.

**Chapter 53: Walking the Great *Dao***

*"Though I have some knowledge,*
*walking the Great *Dao*,
*only reverence is my fear."*

The Great *Dao* is most level,
yet people prefer narrow paths.
The morning is most clear,
yet the fields grow overgrown,
the granaries empty;

「Wearing fine silks and adorned with sharp blades,
disdaining sustenance yet hoarding wealth—
this is called the *thief of the Dao’s staff*.
How far from the *Dao*!

The *Dao* of the gentleman begins with husband and wife;
the *Dao* of the sage does not stray beyond yin and yang.
If one can move in accordance with Heaven,
and act naturally in alignment with one’s nature—
to cultivate oneself is *ren* (benevolence),
to harmonize with things is *zhi* (wisdom).
Uniting inner and outer to achieve singular accord,
thus all things find their place and all actions are fitting.
What need is there for contrivance or artifice?
Yet the *Dao* is fundamentally level and plain,
without hidden strangeness or monstrous deviation.
In the latter ages, men loathe moderation,
preferring the bizarre and novel,
and so they stray to crooked paths,
unaware of their true course.

Take the court: its laws and institutions
are indeed the means to transform the people,
yet those in ignorance fail to recognize them,
and instead seek only to overturn them.
They delight in new arrivals and despise old ministers,
favor constant upheaval and change the state’s governance.
Ancestral precedents are discarded,
as though a man’s vital *qi* were wounded and lost.
Morning policies are abandoned,
the countryside lacks proper models.
Thus, the people neglect farming for ease,
fields and lands grow overgrown,
grasses and herbs are left untended,
and the sources of wealth are exhausted.
Daily waste increases,
granaries are depleted,
legumes and grains vanish,
and stored wealth is spent.
Is this not like the depletion of a man’s *jing* (essence) and *qi*,
consumed and worn away until none remains?

They do not seek inner substance,
only outward display.
Thus, garments must gleam with utmost splendor,
blades and swords must vie in sharpness and brilliance,
feasts must overflow with rare delicacies,
and treasures must be piled high—
unmindful of the scarcity of their roots,
only competing in the flourishing of their branches.
Yet to desire endless taking,
unexhausted use,
and seamless execution—
is this not sheer folly?

All this stems from neglecting the natural *Dao* of Heaven,
and abandoning the unadorned *Dao* of daily practice.
It is as though a thief steals goods,
hiding his head while exposing his tail—
like a staff standing upright,
its shadow seen but its form concealed.
This is a metaphor for those who practice the *Dao*
but confuse falsehood for truth.

The Great *Dao*—how lofty it is!
This fleeting comprehension is but sudden knowledge,
unplanned, unforced—
no need for contrivance or artificiality.»

「Vast and boundless, the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth at their first opening—
this is the original *ancestral qi* of the Preheaven.

It is like Mencius’ sudden perception when seeing a child fall into a well,
that moment of shock and compassionate distress.
My *Dao* speaks of knowledge arising from utter ignorance—
this is true *liángzhī* (良知, innate true-knowing).

The stirrings of such true-knowing are not difficult to recognize,
but to act upon them and sustain them eternally—
this is no simple task.

When it moves, it is right before one’s eyes,
yet in an instant, the lure of external things arises,
desires well up, emotions take shape—
unaware, it slips into the private knowledge of Postheaven.

This is why it must be tempered and applied,
and why it is so formidable.

Only when the eyes hold the *smart pearl* (智珠),
and the chest wields the *wisdom blade* (慧剑),
can one pierce through demons,
sever the threads of desire—
from refining elixirs to attaining the *still point* (还丹),
all are true-knowing unfolding into true abilities,
a straightforward path with no oddity—
this is why the Great *Dao* is so level and easy.

Alas, the Great *Dao* is plain and ordinary,
yet those who rush forward in haste to seek results
often fail to follow the broad and straight way,
straying into narrow, twisted paths,
mistaking themselves for those who have attained the *Dao*,
yet never awakening in their entire lives—
how lamentable this is!

*"Zhōu yù"* (朝喻) is the body;
the body wishes to be refined, not destroyed,
so one must suppress evil and preserve sincerity—
only then can human desires begin to be purified,
and Heavenly principle fully realized.

With time, the luminous light shines forth,
how could the field of the heart ever be overgrown?
With spirit unified, how could the storehouse ever be empty?
Without embroidered adornment, one’s honor is self-fulfilled;
without ointments or grains, one’s hunger is satisfied—
why cling to outward embellishments,
or weary of food and drink?

The *wisdom blade* is sharp indeed—
external weapons are of no use.
The Three Treasures fully attained—
internal wealth is inexhaustible.

If one attains this,
they truly steal Heaven and Earth’s luminous *yáng* (灵阳) *qi* to make the elixir.

Yet today’s practitioners,
not following *Zhōngyōng* (中庸, the Middle Way),
daily incline toward perverse paths—
a body encrusted with dust,
its filth too vast to cleanse.
Moreover, they recklessly provoke misfortune,
losing the primordial *yáng* (元阳) *qi*.

Thus, distractions come thick and fast,
leaving no trace of an empty, transcendent spirit.
When desolation reaches its peak,
are not the orifices fully sealed?
When strength is exhausted and spirit weary,
what sign of fullness remains?
Poverty is cause for sighing—
has not the vital *qi* been fully drained?

They boast of outward brilliance,
yet their adornments are but superficial.
They praise the blade’s edge,
yet their belts are mere symbols of status—
this is already the end!

Yet they persist: disdaining food to indulge in rare delicacies,
coveting wealth to seek abundance—
why not ponder how practitioners cleverly manipulate techniques,
stealing back primordial *qi*,
seeking what lies within rather than without?
The *Yì* (《易》, *Book of Changes*) says:
*“The one who composes the *Yì* knows the art of thievery.”*
This is exactly what it means.

If one abandons this to seek other paths,
how fragmented can it be—
dare one call it the Great *Dao*?

Others comment that the phrase *“Jièrán”* (介然)
and the following sentences speak of a fleeting moment
when a single thread of light appears—
how could this not be knowledge?
Yet when tested in actual practice,
one often falters in execution,
so it is called formidable.
This reveals the difficulty of understanding the Great *Dao*.

The next section discusses scholars
who fail to grasp the fundamental source,
merely priding themselves on outward refinement,
who do not seek true traces
but only chase empty fame—
like standing a staff and seeing its shadow,
grasping its likeness but not its truth,
so they are called *thieves of the staff* (盗竿).

This critique is also apt.
From ancient times, all who practiced the *Dao*,
their skin supple and radiant,
their hair lustrous and bright—
these effects, though common to all,
cannot yet be taken as definitive proof.

What of refining the *jīng* (精, essence) and *qì* (气, *qi*)?
When the *yáng* (阳) light touches,
how could the *yīn* (阴) gloom endure?
Like frost and snow melting in the sun.

Thus, even chronic ailments and old diseases
transform into festering sores and pus,
discharged through the large and small intestines—
not only novices suffer this,
even at the stage of the *Great Elixir* (大丹) attainment,
changes still occur.
The Three Corpses and Six Bandits (三尸六贼),
bleeding and oozing pus,
their stench unbearable—
only those whose mind is settled and intent
can truly trust in the principles,
and deeply verify the scriptures.

One must know that suppressing desire and preserving sincerity,
removing turbidity and retaining clarity,
each layer reveals *yīn* *qi* dispelled
and *yáng* *qi* subtly growing—
practitioners of the *Dao* must not overlook these inner transformations.

Do not fixate on a radiant body,
or swift, light steps—
these are not reliable signs.
Nor trust in levitating through clouds,
appearing and vanishing like ghosts and spirits,
instantaneous transformations of *yáng* *qi*,
or traversing ten thousand miles in a moment—
these too are not to be taken as the *Dao*.

For marvels and oddities,
heterodox and perverse teachings,
must lead one astray,
creating deviant forms.
What a pity that one’s entire life’s energy
is wasted in left-handed paths and false gates!
To seek transcendence yet fall into the Three Paths and Six Realms (三途六道),
is this not deeply regrettable?

The essence of this chapter from the *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Venerable)
teaches that only by recognizing true-knowing
can one avoid error.

Yet today’s practitioners of the *Dao*,
only seek delicate complexions,
and robust physiques—
they do not realize that external labor
wears the mind,
while the inner fields lie fallow,
the treasure-houses empty.
Many are harmed by Heaven’s *qi* before they even begin.

Postheavenly treasures, though present,
are of what use?
Truly, when the Three Treasures unite,
the outer form naturally glows.
Those who chase external effects,
boasting of food and clothing—
why not seek within,
and first enrich the inner wealth?
When the inner wealth is abundant,
the outer wealth will follow naturally.
Is this not unlike thieves,
who steal not Heaven and Earth’s luminous *yáng* *qi*,
but only the fame of sages’ cultivation?

**Chapter 54: Cultivating the Body**
Those who build well do not topple,
those who embrace well do not fall away—
their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.
Cultivating the body,
its *virtue* (德) is complete;
Cultivating the family,
its *virtue* is abundant;
Cultivating the village,
its *virtue* grows long;
Cultivating the state,
its *virtue* becomes plentiful.」

「Cultivating the Dao in the world,
its *virtue* becomes universal.
Thus, one observes the body through the body,
the family through the family,
the village through the village,
the state through the state,
the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Heaven and Earth, in giving birth to humanity,
endow them with *qi* to establish their fate,
and with *principle* (理) to complete their nature.
*Principle* and *qi* originally are one,
nature and fate are never separate.
All arise from the pure, empty *qi*,
swirling through Heaven and Earth,
filling and emptying in ebb and flow,
purely natural, as creation unfolds,
across countless ages.
Though humanity may differ in refinement,
and the Creator’s gifts may vary in measure,
this *qi* is the same,
this *principle* is the same—
never altered, never changed.

The Sage stands at the center, erect and unshaken,
independent yet not leaning,
upright yet not faltering.
Though prosperity and adversity, gain and loss,
joy and sorrow, life and death
differ in myriad ways,
this *principle* and this *qi*
flow within a single body,
filling the two great realms—
never diminished, not even slightly.
Is this not what is meant by *“those who build well do not topple”*?
Otherwise, though solid and substantial—
even towering Tai Mountain, lofty and vast,
still faces ruin and collapse.
For what is shaped, though firm, cannot endure.
Only the formless *principle* and *qi*,
unchanging with things, unmoved by numbers,
enduring through all ages, ever new.

This Dao established within oneself,
transforming and harmonizing all people,
naturally brings deep benevolence and abundant grace,
penetrating to the marrow and flesh,
so the people love and revere them,
clinging in devotion without separation—
not even for a breath’s parting.
Though bound like glue and lacquer, it may be firm;
though mingled like water and milk, it may be harmonious—
yet gathering and scattering are transient,
change and transformation swift,
and in a moment, discord appears.
But benevolent heart and benevolent reputation—
those touched by its grace love without forgetting,
those who hear its wind cherish without abandoning.
How different from children depending on their parents,
or limbs obeying the heart—
no separation, no estrangement.
Is this not *“those who embrace well do not fall away”*?

From this, the virtuous cherish their own and their kin,
the petty delight in their own pleasures and seek their own gains—
yet all govern under the same banner,
revering the rest of the effortless.
Though the Sage may not always remain,
their *virtue* and grace, deeply rooted in the heart,
endure through all ages without ceasing.
The *Odes* say:
*“Generation after generation, descendants,
do not let it fade away.”*
Is this not what is meant?

Once, Confucius praised Shun’s great filial piety:
*“The ancestral temple enjoys him,
his descendants preserve him.”*
This shows that *virtue* is boundless,
and descendants’ sacrifices
are never interrupted through the ages,
renewed at every ancestral feast.
It is said:
*“He who has *virtue* for ten generations
shall have descendants to preserve it for ten generations.
He who has *virtue* for a hundred generations
shall have descendants to preserve it for a hundred generations.”*
And for those whose *virtue* endures eternally—
though billions of years pass,
their descendants, generation upon generation,
grow ever more numerous and flourishing.
Such is the unchanging truth.

All this comes from the Dao of effortless naturalness,
cultivated within oneself yet never lost,
extended to others yet never forgotten—
thus Heaven’s body thrives eternally,
and the world enjoys boundless blessings.

When a person cultivates this Dao in their body,
their form and spirit both attain perfection,
merging with the True Dao.
Dao is body, body is Dao—
the two are one, without division.
What then is *virtue* but truth?

Moreover, when the Dao is cultivated in a village,
the village unites as one body;
when the Dao is cultivated in a state,
the state regards itself as one person.
How much greater then is its *virtue*’s length and abundance?

If one can remain still and govern without action,
serene and desireless,
naturally the winds of the four directions will stir,
the world will turn toward benevolence,
the people will cherish its *virtue* without end—
how universal is its *virtue*!
This is not achieved by coercion or enticement with gain.
It stems from the innate goodness within,
cultivating the true heart in freedom—
like a wandering child longing for home,
or an old man rejoicing in reunion.
Joy comes unbidden yet arrives naturally.

Though people differ in form, their hearts are not unlike,
their fates the same, their natures aligned.
Thus, manifesting *virtue* renews the people,
and calming them begins with self-cultivation—
no difference exists.

Moreover, a village is the accumulation of a family,
a state the expansion of a village.
The world, vast and populous,
is nothing but the gradual extension of one family,
one village, one state.
To know the Dao of one person is to know the Dao of family, state, and Heaven as one.
To cultivate oneself is to cultivate family, state, and world.
Seeking within, one must extend outward—
thus, silently transforming, effortlessly changing customs,
the people naturally rejoice together in harmony.
Therefore it is said:
*“Only when *virtue* transforms does humanity arise,
and only when humanity arises do customs form.”*
Its Dao originates in the body,
its *virtue* extends to the family,
and its transformation spreads like grass bending before the wind—
reaching no distance it does not encompass,
spreading through village and state to the world.

Ah! How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*“Great is the Primordial of Heaven!
Firm and strong, moderate and correct,
pure and complete, precise and unceasing!”*
This is the Dao as preheavenal *Yin* gold,
most firm, most vigorous,
erect between Heaven and Earth,
flowing through all things within,
embracing all without remainder,
its sincerity never exhausted.
Its power ever extends yet never bends,
straight yet unyielding—
supporting Heaven, sustaining Earth,
reaching the Han, piercing the sky,
the state never even slightly toppled.
Yet it is the utmost of the boundless,
the most divine of the unmanifest,
thus standing unshaken to this day.»

The human being, if able to establish their foundation in the boundless (*wújí*), erect their primordial spirit (*yuánshén*), then as the ancients said: *"harvest the great medicine from the stillness within"* and *"conduct the fire-alchemy within the realm of non-action."* Dwelling at the center and establishing the pole, the vast *qi* arises—*qi* dependent upon spirit, spirit and *qi* mutually resonating, knotted as one cluster, thus returning to the root and restoring the command—*Dao* abides forever.

Now, the birth of humanity: spirit and *qi* unite; in death, spirit and *qi* separate. If one harmonizes nature and life, blending spirit and *qi*, then they embrace the Primordial and preserve the One. My life is determined by me, not by Heaven—what escape is there? Thus, spirit depends upon spirit, *qi* upon *qi*, a single pulse transmitted, a single truth permeating—one can then undergo myriad transformations, vanishing as ghosts and emerging as gods, manifesting countless, boundless forms, enjoying countless, boundless years. How could it be otherwise than: *"a child begets a grandson, who again begets a child, child upon child, grandson upon grandson—roots deep and leaves flourishing, source distant and flow enduring, with unbroken ancestral rites across ten thousand generations?"*

Yet it is no more than using primordial *qi* as medicine and primordial spirit as the alchemical fire. For primordial *qi* is no-*qi*, primordial spirit is no-spirit. Refining *qi* with spirit to attain the *Dao* is like refining medicine with fire to forge the elixir. Common elixirs may succeed or fail, but the divine elixir knows no end nor beginning—thus it is said: *"The Great Elixir Dao endures ten thousand years without erosion."* It is nothing but cultivating one’s own virtue and perfecting one’s own body, not relying on later acquisitions or external sources—thus its virtue is true.

Though Heaven and Earth give birth to humanity, clean and turbid differing, the wise and unwise varied, yet when the august and sacred descend—from the family to the world—each possesses an inherent constancy. Thus, a single heart can permeate myriad households, a single virtue can inspire myriad people. Cultivating the self to harmonize the family leaves virtue in abundance; cultivating the self to transform the village extends virtue’s reach. As for governing the state and pacifying the world, it is nothing but *"sitting in ease while the world transforms"*—there is no external cultivation of the self that can universally attain such success. This is the constant *Dao* of the age.

Conversely, if one cultivates the self, how could it differ? Discussing the state and the world, it is fundamentally a matter of progressing from near to far, layer by layer. When the three—refined essence (*jīng*), *qi*, and spirit—are all present, it is not a step-by-step process. Speaking of initial practice: *"refining essence,"* yet *qi* and spirit are also involved. The second step: *"refining qi,"* yet spirit and essence are also present. The third step: *"refining spirit,"* yet essence and *qi* are also there. Returning to emptiness and merging with the *Dao*, the *Dao* merging with nature—from beginning to end, they never depart. To depart is to lose the *Dao*.

The body is like essence, but essence is not the essence of mutual resonance—it is the primordial essence received from the void’s five elements at birth. Cultivating the body is refining essence into *qi*. The practitioner, at the outset, obtains this essence to live and grow with it. Cultivating with essence is no different from cultivating the body itself—how true is this! Speaking of *qi*, essence is closer to the body, while *qi* is slightly more distant. *"Cultivating the family, its virtue is abundant"*—for gathering external true yang *qi* to refine internal true yin essence is like harmonizing the self to govern the family. What surplus does one not possess from what is inherently one’s own?

The village, when viewed from the body, is even more distant, yet closer than the family—just as spirit is. Spirit, like fire, belongs to *qi* in its heat and to spirit in its light—thus, two yet one. Cultivating the village is refining spirit back to emptiness. Hence it is said: *"Its virtue is enduring,"* for longevity and vast duration. As for the state, compared to the village it is nearer, yet more distant than the body—its breadth and width cannot be seen at a glance. The state is like the void; cultivating the state is refining the void to merge with the *Dao*. When refining reaches the void, it becomes one with pure emptiness, illuminating the great thousand—how much more so the world! Thus it is said: *"Its virtue is universal."*

As for observing the body through the body, the family through the family, the village through the village, the state through the state, and the world through the world—it is nothing but using one’s own self and family as the model for the world’s self and family, taking the highest as an analogy. The intent is profound, the meaning subtle. The Great *Dao* has no other path—refined to its utmost, reaching the natural void. Exhausted!

Those who study the Great *Dao* have no other way than *"reducing again and again, until non-action is natural."* Non-action yet nothing remains undone—exhausted!

Yet internal elixirs and external elixirs, internal *dan* and external *dan*—filling the *kàn* with *lì*, extracting lead and adding mercury—various metaphors and names, ultimately no more than cultivating the essence, *qi*, and spirit inherent in the body, received from Heaven and Earth at birth. Since they come with life, they are inherently possessed, yet they become enmeshed in the fleshly shell—thus they are called *"yin essence, yin qi, yin spirit."* Since they come with life, they are called *"internal medicine."*

When the practitioner begins their work, they must first close the senses and concentrate within, regulating their breath, merging the three primals into one cauldron, and refining the three primals within that single cauldron—named *"refining essence,"* yet in truth, spirit and *qi* all return to one orifice. Only when spirit is harmonized and *qi* flows freely, blending into one, does the *qi*-mechanism activate, steaming and floating—this is called *"qi-transformation,"* or *"gold born from water’s depths,"* or *"the common parents unite to produce the medicine."* This is the way of the world’s men and women, requiring the method of procreation. If one does not know the reverse cultivation, the essence will instantly transform into tangible, post-heavenly *qi*, leaking through the kidney passage. Hence: *"Consolidate the *qi*, preserve the essence—this is the decisive path to longevity."*

If one seeks longevity, the transformation of essence into *qi* is the wondrous elixir of life.

「When conflicts arise, one must urgently summon the *Tian Gang* (天罡) to subdue within, thrust the *Dou Bing* (斗柄) outward, advance and retreat the *He Che* (河车), and draw back the *Zhong Gong* (中宫) to forge anew. This is the refining of the inner elixir, where essence, *qi*, and spirit merge into one—how could it be merely *qi-transformation*?

The interplay of inner and outer, of *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (离), begins with the body’s inherent capacities, converging in the *Huang Fang* (黄房), nurturing for a moment, and thus *qi* is born—this is the infusion of spirit into *qi*, whereby the essence within the body refines the *Ling Yang* (灵阳, "heavenly earthly *qi*") drawn from the cosmos, achieving *essence-refining into *qi-transformation***.

Next, this *qi* is drawn and ascended, guided and descended, returning to the *Tu Fu* (土釜, "earthly cauldron") for repeated steaming and refining—this is the method of *"leads smelting mercury"* (铅制汞), where the *yang qi* submits to the *yin essence*. The essence is originally what the body inherently possesses, hence it is called *"Li ji yin jing"* (离己阴精, "separate from oneself *yin essence*"*). The *qi*, born from essence-transformation, is thus termed *"Kan wu yang qi"* (坎戊阳气, "Kan’s *wu* phase *yang qi*"*).

Not all *qi* belongs to the heart, nor is it generated within the kidneys. From *Yong Quan* (涌泉) to *Qi Hai* (气海) all belong to *yang*—*yang* is *Kan*. From *Ni Wan* (泥丸) to *Xuan Guan* (玄关) all belong to *yin*—*yin* is *Li*. Thus, the *qi* of water and fire is *Kan* and *Li*, not the heart and kidneys themselves, which is now clear.

Again, when *Kan* contains *qi*, it is called *Di Po* (地魄)—this is the *Bai Hu* (白虎, "White Tiger") of external elixir, and the *Jin Dan* (金丹, "Golden Elixir") of the inner. This elixir arises from extracting *lead* (铅) and adding *mercury* (汞), merging into one—both belong to the *Shui Fu* (水府, "Water Palace") *Xuan Zhu* (玄珠, "Mysterious Pearl").

The distinction between inner and outer is but layer upon layer, not truly separate. When the *Li Gong* (离宫, "Abode of *Li*") contains essence, it is called *Tian Hun* (天魂, "Heavenly Soul")—this is the *Qing Long* (青龙, "Green Dragon") of external elixir, but the true essence of oneself in the inner. *"Jin born from water"* (水中金生) is the *qi* transforming within essence—this is the *Bai Hu* (白虎) *initial crescent qi* (初弦之气) of external elixir, and the *silver within lead* (铅中之银) of the inner.

It is also said: *"Jin Dan* (金丹) is the supreme elixir of longevity." Only when this *Qian Yuan* (乾元, "Primordial *Qian*") *qi* sinks into the human body, and is not smelted by the *Shen Huo* (神火, "spiritual fire"), will it remain submerged and inert. And even when it moves and inclines, this is like the oil in a lamp—without oil, the lamp extinguishes; without *qi*, the person perishes. Life arises from this, hence it is the supreme elixir of longevity.

For it originally falls into *Kan* (坎) from *Qian* (乾), yet now returns from *Kan* to *Qian*—this is the origin of the *Jin Dan* doctrine.

If one seeks longevity, apart from this *Shui Xiang* (水乡, "Water Domain") *lead* (铅) essence, there is no other path. Though this *Jin Dan* is said to be inherent in all, without the *Shen Huo* (神火) to temper and refine it, there is no way to produce it.

Once the true *gold* (真金) is born, one must again subdue the *Bai Hu* (白虎) and tame the *Long* (龙), causing the *Qing Long* (青龙) to submit to the *Hu* (虎). The *Long* (龙) and *Hu* (虎) *qi* reconverge in the *Huang Fang* (黄房), their *qi* devouring and consuming each other to form *Jin Dan*.

When the *qi* returns to the *Tu Fu* (土釜) and meets with true essence, it is nurtured by the *Shen Huo* (神火) to form the *Sheng Tai* (圣胎, "Sacred Embryo"). Once the embryo is formed, internally one employs the natural spiritual fire, softly permeating the *Shen Fang* (神房, "Spiritual Chamber"), while externally adding the drawn and tempered mundane fire, flowing throughout the body. This is the daily practice of *"packaging one’s own mercury to consolidate true essence"* (运己汞包固真精); over time, the embryo dissolves and one transcends.

Ascending to the *Ni Wan* (泥丸), refining all voids, one strives to return to the original, natural state. It is neither the three treasures of essence, *qi*, and spirit being distinct, nor the inner and outer elixirs being separate. If one does not sit until the meditation cushion is worn through, nor grind until the knees are calloused, enduring self-suffering and self-refinement—how could one ever penetrate the profound truth?

I now briefly record the general principles, merely pointing the way for later students. The Dao is inherently ordinary, nothing extraordinary—yet the more one refines, the more ordinary it becomes.

Other transformations are unfathomable; in the eyes of the world, they seem unattainable heights, mysteries beyond comprehension. Yet, as the *Taoist Canon of the Supreme Dao* (太上道德一经) reveals, even the Three Pure Ones (三清) and the Supreme Venerable (太上) are but ordinary mortals transformed.

For the mortal clings to life and death as joys and sorrows, while the sage views them as day and night. Life and death are like waking and sleeping—one must follow them naturally, without disturbance. Those who say longevity and immortality are the delight of the sage are mistaken.

The mortal takes pride in longevity, but the sage finds joy in *Xu Li* (须理, "following the natural order"). Even if one sacrifices life for virtue (*Sha Sheng Cheng Ren* 杀生成仁) or discards life for righteousness (*She Sheng Qu Yi* 舍生取义), it is something the sage has always willingly embraced. Otherwise, who would not fear the horrors of the guillotine and the saw?

From ancient times, noble and virtuous souls have often regarded the cauldron and the furnace as joyous realms, and death as a peaceful path—because they have seen the truth clearly and believed in the fate of life. Their life and death are but the operation of this heart. To live in unease is worse than to die swiftly, just as to cling to pain while awake is worse than to rest in eternal slumber.

So long as spirit remains and principle is complete, what is life to be honored, or death to be shamed? One who listens to the operations of *Zao Hua* (造化, "Creation and Transformation") will never cling to life in the mortal world.

If one loves life and fears death, they are but vulgar and common folk, not the study of sages who follow the natural order in all things. Otherwise, why did Confucius die at seventy, and Yanzi at thirty? They acted according to Heaven’s will, daring not to defy it.

This is something no ordinary mortal could ever comprehend.»

「I secretly hope that scholars seek only what is within, without concern for what is without, and view adversity, ease, life, and death all with equal indifference.

What breadth, what tranquility this heart possesses! The saying goes: *“Recognize the Dao, and let fate unfold as Heaven arranges it.”*

Thus attaining ease in life and serenity in death, forever becoming a transcendent sage beyond the world—is this not superior to those who cling to life and fear death, now and then rejoicing within, now and then burdened with sorrow, their hearts never finding peace?

Moreover, those of lofty Dao, whom Heaven wishes to retain as models to guide the common folk—I do not reject them, nor do I pursue them; I simply listen to Heaven’s will. How could my heart ever be troubled by such matters?

For life and death are both the Dao. To live fully in the Dao and die fully in the Dao—what need then for love or aversion?

All who harbor attachments within their hearts will see their spirit disrupted and their nature lost, unworthy of being called sages.

**Chapter 55: The Depth of Virtue/Power**

The depth of virtue/power is like that of a newborn babe.
Poisonous insects do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not seize,
predatory birds do not snatch.

Though bones are frail and sinews soft, their grasp is firm;
before knowing the union of male and female, yet already formed—this is the utmost refinement of essence.
To cry all day yet never hoarse—this is the utmost harmony.

To know harmony is to know constancy;
to know constancy is to know clarity.
To nurture life is auspicious.
The heart directing *qi* is strength.

When things flourish, they age and decay—this is called un-Dao;
the un-Dao perishes swiftly.

The *Yijing* says: *“Heaven and Earth blend like the finest silk, and all things are transformed into purity. The union of male and female *qi* brings forth all things.”*
From the beginning of creation, they are not far from Heaven—
their *qi* is tender and supple.
If one follows its momentum and guides it,
welcomes its opportunity and nourishes it,
one may yet reach the realm of pristine refinement,
the ultimate harmony of Heaven.

Mencius said: *“The noble sage does not lose the heart of a newborn babe.”*
For when a babe first emits its cry upon the earth,
though it possesses its own world of *Yin-Yang*,
and initiates its own Creation and Transformation,
still it is pure and unadulterated—
a single mass of Heaven’s true nature in its embrace.
Without knowledge, without thought,
static yet harmonious, moving yet in accord with Heaven.

The ancient sages and transcendent ones contained vast light and boundless virtue/power,
comparable in depth to that of a newborn babe.

In the moment of their parents’ embrace,
when nurtured and cared for,
their feet cannot walk,
their hands cannot act.

Though poisonous insects are present,
they cannot sting them;
though ferocious beasts are near,
they cannot seize them.」

「Though fierce raptors may be present,
they have no way to strike—
for when in motion, they do not know where to go,
and when they walk, they do not know where to tread.
Thus, they fear no poisonous insects,
and the insects cannot sting them;
they fear no ferocious beasts,
and the beasts cannot seize them.

Yet when they lie dangerously on a bed,
or rest peacefully in a couch,
though raptors may lurk nearby,
the raptors cannot help but strike them.
Once youthful vigor arrives,
and movement becomes effortless,
though there may be joy in wandering,
they cannot attain the tranquility of a secluded chamber,
and few can escape the calamities of malevolent forces.

Consider the newborn babe,
yet unaware of the union of *Yin* and *Yang* in copulation,
its vitality ever flourishing.
It is evident that the original *qi* is pure and unbounded,
with life’s essence daily unfolding.

If one can focus their *qi* and cultivate softness akin to an infant’s first breath,
then they possess the essence that can be refined.
Observe how the babe’s cries,
endless and unceasing,
though they wail all day,
never harm the throat or larynx—
this is not artificial but natural,
a spontaneous utterance, unrestrained yet effortless.
All is *Heaven’s mechanism* in motion,
*Heaven’s resonance* in sound,
without manipulation, without contrivance—
harmony in its utmost.

Understanding this *original harmony* within,
one aligns with the *eternal Dao*,
requiring no artificial effort to correct or force,
but preserving its true nature,
settling into its fixed essence.

The *Odes* say:
*“Both wise and sagely,
to safeguard their very being,”*
—could this be its meaning?

If not for the cultivation of *harmonious soft qi*,
nourishing the body and mind,
how could one be born and grow ever more vital?
How could one’s *Heavenly body* be sustained without decay,
and this be the greatest of human blessings?

Once strength and vigor arise,
*Heaven’s heart* is disturbed by *human heart*,
and the depletion of spirit becomes frequent.
Now, if we take *original harmony* as the Dao,
ultimate stillness enables ultimate motion,
and supreme softness overcomes supreme hardness.

Thus, one must make the *qi* serve the mind,
ensuring this *qi* returns to the state of the newborn babe,
and not let the *qi* disturb the mind,
lest the mind stray from *original harmony*.
Only then can one achieve harmony without dissipation—
strong indeed, and far from artificial.
This is not unique to the newborn babe.

Observe all things:
their beginning is soft and tender,
their end, hard and strong.
Softness and tenderness are signs of life’s vitality,
hardness and strength, portents of death’s approach.

Thus, when things grow strong, they age,
not as when things remain young, they thrive.
Life’s Dao endures,
while death’s Dao perishes.
Hence it is said:
*“Aging is not the Dao—
the Dao is not to age at all.”*
Why not? Because aging is merely the decay of vitality.
Yet if measured by years,
even at eighty or ninety,
one may still cultivate the Dao of eternal life,
for so long as a breath remains,
this *original harmony’s qi* suffices within the body,
unfailing and complete.

For when the *qi* is first cultivated in softness,
it is like all things bending branches and sprouting buds.
Nurture and foster it here,
and it shall grow daily, monthly,
until it returns to the root of life,
yielding the fruit of longevity.

But when the time of *San-Yang* (late twilight) arrives,
things have aged and are nearing decline—
their essence is no longer fit to refine into medicine.
Yet aging is not merely old age in years,
but the decay of the medicine’s vitality.
If judged by age alone,
even at eighty or nine years,
one may still attain the Dao of unending life,
for so long as a breath remains,
this *original harmony’s qi* suffices within the body,
unfailing and complete.

This is the method of cultivating the self,
taking the newborn babe as its model.

Zhuangzi said:
*“A babe moves without knowing what to do,
walks without knowing where to go,
its body like a withered tree,
its mind as cold as dead ashes—
misfortune does not come,
fortune does not arrive.”*
If misfortune and fortune alike do not manifest,
how could there be human or natural calamities?
The lines *“poisonous insects”* and following convey this very meaning.

Later, it speaks of gathering herbs and refining elixirs,
requiring the *newly sprouted water* of *Heaven’s One* (the first drop of dew).
This water is the very source of human vitality.
Like a wheel of crimson sun,
rising at midnight’s beginning,
its light clear and bright,
illuminating the vast sea;
or like a crescent autumn moon,
emerging in the *Geng-Zhen* direction—
this is when the cultivator’s *mystic pass* opens,
their senses lost in boundless void,
and such a state is attained.

For when the *qi* is first cultivated in softness,
it is like all things bending branches and sprouting buds.
At this stage, nurture and foster it,
and it shall grow daily, monthly,
until it returns to the root of life,
yielding the fruit of hardy vitality.

If one waits until the *San-Yang* phase,
then vitality has aged and is declining—
its essence is no longer fit to refine into medicine.
Yet aging is not merely old age in years,
but the decay of the medicine’s vitality.
If judged by age alone,
even at eighty or ninety,
one may still cultivate the Dao of eternal life,
for so long as a breath remains,
this *original harmony’s qi* suffices within the body,
unfailing and complete.»

The true adept alone can pierce the *watery heaven* within—
when the two currents of inner and outer *qi* merge,
how many would otherwise pass by unknowing.

The scholar who seeks the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir
must empty the heart to seek the Way,
accumulate virtue to turn back the heavens—
only then will the true master manifest in response,
and the *White Tiger’s Classic* be found.
Otherwise, even if one enters the Dao in youth,
they shall grow old without attainment.

Worse still, those who follow false teachers,
straying onto false paths—
many a lifetime’s vital essence wasted in the realm of beasts.
Let the scholar take heed!

**Chapter 56: The Most Noble of the World**
The wise do not speak; those who speak do not know.
Close the mouth, shut the door,
dull the sharpness, resolve the tangled,
harmonize the light, blend with the dust—
this is called *Mysterious Unity*.

Thus, one cannot be too close nor too distant,
cannot be too beneficial nor too harmful,
cannot be too noble nor too base.
Therefore, one is the most noble of the world.

Common men, when they hear a good word or see a good deed,
immediately chatter and boast to stir others—
pleasing for a moment, yet never turning inward to self-examination.
Confucius said, *“Hearsay and gossip are the abandonment of virtue,”*
and truly, he spoke no falsehood.

But the true knower of the Great Dao,
when he has even a scrap of understanding,
is too busy morning and evening with reverent caution—
how could he have leisure to speak?
Even if he reviews the old and gains new insights,
and finds a moment of intuitive understanding,
it is his own and self-attained—
like one sated with food and drink,
drunk and full, knowing its flavor,
yet unable to convey it to others.

Those who love to speak of it
must surely lack something within themselves.
And since virtue is one’s own virtue,
and cultivation one’s own cultivation—
if one truly knows, the more one conceals it,
the more one fears that a single word spoken lightly
might cause even a breath to stray,
and thus the loss of the Way in one’s heart.
This is why the wise do not speak.

If one does speak, it is because they lack virtue within themselves,
truly knowing nothing of the Dao.
If they did know, why would they so casually reveal it?
Thus, those who speak prove themselves even more ignorant.

Moreover, what is unspeakable is the essence,
and what is spoken of is but dross.
The wise do not fail to speak—
they simply cannot speak.
Those who speak do not fail to know—
they only grasp the surface.

As the saying goes, *“When you’ve grasped it, close your mouth.”*
Indeed, knowing the Dao is no easy feat—
why waste one’s *qi* in speech,
or tarnish one’s spirit with idle chatter,
boasting of talent and ability to stand out?
Such actions only invite contempt from the vulgar.

Thus, the noble Daoist seals the mouth, shuts the door,
nurturing *qi* within;
dulls the sharpness, resolves confusion,
stabilizing the spirit;
harmonizes the light, blends with the dust,
adapting to the times, rising and falling with the world,
as if foolish, as if drunk,
as if slow of speech, as if mad—
when the multitude is confused, I too am confused,
neither flaunting nor opposing,
neither clashing with myself nor defying the world.

Should even a thread of pretense or ambition arise,
one cannot help but speak grandly to satisfy a moment’s pride.
Such actions seek either fame or gain.
Has one not heard the *Taoist Canon*’s warning to Confucius?
*“Those who can be fed with wine and meat,
I will whip and beat.
Those who can be honored with rank and wealth,
I will insult and humiliate.”*

Only by secluding oneself to cultivate in silence,
embracing the *original unity*, guarding the *One*,
keeping the spirit silent and the *qi* obscure,
remaining tranquil and desireless,
acting without action, doing without doing—
one cannot be too close nor too distant,
too beneficial nor too harmful,
too noble nor too base.
This is to seek within oneself, not without,
not seeking from others,
fulfilling one’s nature and returning to one’s life—
thus, one is the most noble of the world.

Within the Three Realms, only the Dao is supreme.
I cultivate my Dao, and thus my Dao is noble—
nothing in the world surpasses this.
The *Taoist Canon* says: *“Few understand me, thus I am noble.”*
Do scholars understand this as well?

The man of the Way must not speak lightly,
for few in the world truly know.
If one indulges in idle talk,
not only does it harm oneself internally,
but it also invites external harm to others.
The *I Ching* says: *“If secrets are not kept, disaster follows.”*
Many a cultivator has, through careless disclosure,
invited calamity and misfortune.

Thus, the sage keeps secrets and does not speak.
Even if one finds a worthy listener,
one must proceed with utmost caution and testing—
only after repeated trials,
swearing by heaven and earth,
ascending the platform to teach,
does one dare speak without exaggeration or excess.
This shows the ancient masters’ practice of concealing brilliance
and revering the Dao and heaven.

Those who speak lightly know nothing.
If one truly knows, one is too busy with self-cultivation and verification
to have leisure for idle talk.
Those who speak recklessly
are those who, even in nobility, invite their own degradation.

With my Dao and my nobility,
I can endure from one age to ten thousand ages—
who in the world can surpass this?
Let the scholar cultivate what lies within,
moment by moment, observing inwardly,
lest the wind of idle speculation arise.

**Chapter 57: Governing the World with Rectitude**
Govern the world with rectitude,
employ strategy in warfare,
and take the world without conflict.
How do I know this to be true?
Because of this:

The world is filled with taboos and prohibitions,
yet the people grow ever poorer;

「The people abound in greed and flattery,
and the state grows ever more corrupt;
The people abound in cunning and artifice,
and strange things multiply;
Laws and decrees become ever more explicit,
and thieves and bandits flourish.

Thus the sage says:
*"I act without interference, yet the people transform themselves.
I love tranquility, yet the people align with rectitude.
I take no action, yet the people grow rich.
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*

Confucius said:
*"My Dao is but one thread that runs through all things."*
This means that through the Dao,
all affairs and things of the world
are not without its penetration and manifestation.
As the saying goes:
*"One root scatters into myriad branches,
yet myriad branches all return to one root."*
To govern oneself and the world—
this is the greatest principle.
The Dao of governing the world
does not surpass
the four occupations—*scholar, farmer, artisan, merchant*—
each finding their place in life,
and filial piety and fraternal respect—
each following their inherent moral nature.
These are the daily, constant practices,
the great precepts of the world,
the eternal laws of ages past and present—
indeed, the common Dao,
also the Dao of rectitude.
What every person ought to fulfill
is what every person inherently possesses as virtue.

For those who lead the people,
they must practice frugality in person,
exhaust their filial kindness and benevolence for the world,
and act with solemn dignity and measured presence.
They must guide with gentleness,
restrain with stillness,
avoid frivolous matters to strengthen their resolve,
and let all things fall into order without effort—
one act of rectitude suffices to bring harmony,
and naturally the winds will follow,
the grass will bow.
Swift as the influence of the stars,
this is the way.

Mencius said:
*"Rectify the ruler, and the kingdom will be steadied."*
And again:
*"The world’s existence has long endured."*
Order and chaos follow in cycles,
as they have since ancient times—
no deviation has ever escaped this truth.
Though in times of order, *rites and music* are employed,
and in times of chaos, *arms and warfare* are used,
when two armies face each other in battle,
and great enemies clash,
the fate of the state—its safety or peril—
and the lives of the people—birth or death—
rest upon a single commander.
How could this not be of utmost importance?

Though the arts of *strategy and calculation*,
and the cunning of *clever schemes and tactical shifts*,
are not what the *noble* esteem,
yet to fulfill the mandate of heaven in punishing rebels,
and to uphold great justice in consoling the people,
does not bar the use of *unexpected victories and decisive tactics*.

Thus the *art of war* has:
*concealed raids and covert assaults*,
*exploiting fatigue and exhaustion*,
*separating alliances and counter-espionage*,
*feigning weakness to deceive*,
*strategies as elusive as gods and spirits*—
these marvelous schemes.
To employ the *Dao of the Unexpected* in warfare,
is to never lose a battle,
never fail in an assault,
to spare the lives of the people,
to not drain their wealth,
and for all to long enjoy the blessings of peace—
is this not the very essence of *taking the world without conflict*?

Yet to unite the mountains and rivers under one rule,
and to gather the heavens and earth under one person—
how could this not involve myriad affairs?
But if one lets the myriad things rush in,
while maintaining a composed and tranquil heart,
naturally one will harmonize with the heavens,
and the heavenly will favor them;
below, the people will revere them,
and all will follow in devotion—
thus the world can be taken without effort.

Hence it is said:
*"The Tang and Yu* [1] *offered three cups of wine in humble deference,
while the Shang and Wu* [2] *conquered with a single move of the chessboard."*
The world was not seen as strange or wondrous,
nor was its conquest taken lightly—
thus the heart was free of burdens,
and its capacity matched that of the heavens and earth.
Hence, when they presided over China
and soothed the four barbarians,
it came naturally and without premeditation.
This is the Dao of governing the world.

How do I know this to be true?
Because the Dao of governing the world
does not go beyond governing oneself—
the body is like a state.
Sight, hearing, speech, and action
must all conform to *rites*;
thoughts, intentions, and wisdom
must be steadied by *emotion/feeling*.
Inner reflections do not stray outward,
external distractions do not intrude inward—
when nature is settled,
the body attains rectitude.
With prolonged cultivation of stillness,
the natural faculties of the heart spontaneously arise.

To apply the *ordinary Dao of life*
as the *elixir method of reversal*,
approaching the furnace with fire—
this is fraught with danger.
The highest method is likened to warfare:
one must act in accordance with the times,
seize opportunities as they arise,
harvest at the proper season,
refine with precision in place,
camp in the field at the right moment,
and defend the city with the proper strategy—
not failing to await the right time and favorable conditions,
and to deploy with unexpected schemes.

As for:
*the fire extinguished by sufficient medicine*,
*the elixir perfected to warm the furnace*,
*elevating the spirit of the sun* [3] *to the void realm*,
*nurturing the immortal embryo in the unbroken chamber*—
one must still cultivate in the *spiritual chamber*,
attending to nothing with complete detachment,
and only then can the elixir be refined,
the immortality achieved.
This is the Dao of governing oneself,
and it mirrors the method of governing the world.
Thus I know the Dao of governing the world
through this very Dao of governing oneself.

He who takes the world
must do so through *non-action*,
yet he who holds the world
must not rely on *excessive action*.
Otherwise, if he enacts too many regulations,
issues too many decrees,
makes the people tremble at every step,
they will inevitably resort to deceit and fraud,
and affairs will fall into disarray.
The world abounds in prohibitions,
yet the people grow ever poorer.

Gold, jade, pearls, and jewels,
carriages, horses, fine garments—
the useful tools of the people multiply.
But when greed arises,
and desires cannot be satisfied,
how could the spirit not grow dim,
and the *qi* not grow turbid?

Honesty and simplicity are forgotten,
while deceit and cunning are esteemed.
When those with skill appear,
people love and admire them,
and all vie to imitate their ways—
thus strange and bizarre things
are all drawn to the fore.

Ah! In the flourishing times of the *Three Dynasties*,
the rulers were all *divine and sage*,
and the people were all pure and virtuous.
Laws were established yet not enforced,
precepts were set yet not applied—
thus they were called *flourishing ages*.

Now, however,
the legal nets are stretched high and thick,
like a fine mesh;
the *five grades of punishment* are severe,
and offenders are not spared;
the *three codes of law* are strict,
and violators are executed.
Yet why do crimes multiply as laws grow stricter,
and thieves increase as decrees become more numerous?
It is because *virtue/power* is insufficient to win the hearts of the people,
and the laws are not enough to awe their resolve.
From ancient times, the people’s unrest has always stemmed from
these very *punishments and coercive measures*—
this is evident since the Qin and Han.

The ancient sages said:
*"Heaven is honored through non-action,
while man is burdened by it."*
If I uphold solemnity and simplicity,
do not overwhelm the people with excessive regulations,
nor confuse the state with constant changes,
but instead maintain composure at the highest echelons,
and dwell in tranquil seclusion within the deepest palaces—
then the people will daily improve in virtue,
yet remain unaware of the effort.»

[1] *Tang and Yu*: Refers to the legendary sage-kings *Emperor Shun (Yu)* and *Emperor Yao (Tang)* of the Xia Dynasty, known for their humility and virtuous rule.
[2] *Shang and Wu*: Refers to *King Tang of Shang* and *King Wu of Zhou*, who overthrew the tyrannical *Xia Dynasty* and *Shang Dynasty* respectively through military conquest.
[3] *Spirit of the sun*: Refers to the *yang* spirit or *sun essence* (日精) in Daoist alchemy, symbolizing the refined, luminous energy cultivated within.

「Yet with a serene and tranquil mind, one preserves profound silence and self-cultivation—
solely attending to sincerity in intent and rectifying the heart—
yet who would know that rectifying oneself rectifies the court,
rectifying officials rectifies the people,
all arising from this stillness and composure?

When the people are thus rectified,
each reveres their kin and honors their elders,
none transgress their proper station,
and households endure in harmony.
Then they till the fields for sustenance,
dig wells for drink,
rise with the sun and rest with the night,
their granaries overflowing,
their lives free of want—
and the people grow rich without knowing how.

For this arises when the ruler follows nature,
acts without contrivance,
and lets things unfold of their own accord.

How much more so when one maintains stillness,
guards emptiness,
remains undisturbed and does without action,
settling into the true *hun-hun wū-wū* [1],
that the people, moved and transformed by it,
will not fail to cultivate loyalty and filial piety,
and adopt a plain, unadorned way of life.

The *Shū* says:
*“One man of perfect virtue,
and the myriad states stand upright.”*
Its mechanism lies hidden in subtlety,
its effects manifest as vast as heaven and earth.

I wish those who govern to take rectifying the sovereign’s heart as their priority,
and those who cultivate themselves to first nourish the *Tiān Jūn* [2].

This principle is already clear—
no need for further elaboration.

I envision the moment of seated meditation:
At first, the *yang* qi sinks to the depths of the sea,
like the waning of winter’s end,
all around in silent stillness.
With the divine light descending,
it is as though at the winter solstice, *yang* begins to stir—
yet the void remains soundless,
the walls stark and desolate,
unchanged as before.

From here, the vital forces gradually revolve,
unaware, the Three *Yangs* unfold,
and all things return to spring—
flowers crimson, leaves verdant,
waters bright, mountains clear—
the peak of *yang* is already manifest.

Heaven’s way is thus—
how much more so the human body?

Only when the head tilts slightly downward,
the gaze softly lowered,
does *yin* reach its extreme and *yang* emerge anew.

This stage differs from the earlier practice—
no longer clinging to a fixed intent,
counting breaths with deliberate effort.
One must abandon external fire,
halt the internal forge,
letting nature take its course without interference—
lest one fall back into old habits unknowingly.

This is the art of preserving the aware mind
to nurture the *wuwei* nature.

When enlightenment lingers long,
and righteousness and benevolence mature—
what need remains for preservation or cultivation?
Only the natural order suffices.

Otherwise, at the outset, without exertion,
the mind may rage like a wild beast or untamed steed,
and taming it may prove difficult at first.

Yet when the beast and steed return of their own accord,
as Mencius said of releasing the pig into the marshes,
one must not pursue and bind it—
lest the lively and free become constrained and uneasy.

What then is the method?
The *Yì* says:
*“Heaven and Earth in their weaving,
transform all things into purity.”* [3]»

---
[1] *Hun-hun wū-wū* (浑浑噩噩): A Daoist term describing the primordial, undifferentiated state of natural spontaneity, often linked to the *Zhōu Yì* (周易) concept of *Zhēn* (真, "the Real").
[2] *Tiān Jūn* (天君): The "Celestial Sovereign" or "Heavenly Ruler," a Daoist alchemical term referring to the refined spiritual essence governing the body.
[3] *Yì* (易): The *Yì Jīng* (易经, *Classic of Changes*), here invoking the transformative power of heaven and earth.

This *embroidering-and-fuling* qi, within the human body, is like the inner fire stopping and the outer form remaining still—undisturbed, allowing the breath to flow naturally. For those whose practice is refined, at such times, one need not consciously direct the mind; if one has not yet reached this stage, the mind of awareness must not be forgotten. If forgotten, one risks slipping into unconsciousness, where thoughts arise and vanish in endless cycles, causing the original, pure nature to be submerged beneath the waves of birth and death.

The ancient Buddhas said:
*“To know the source of arising is to know the source of cessation.”*
Thus, through such cultivation, over time one perceives the beginning of arising and cessation, and again, over time, the beginning of non-thought—then it is attained.

As for the teachings of the *Huángtíng* [Yellow Court], they lie in neither existence nor non-existence, neither within nor without; yet they are also within the colored body, yet not within the colored body. Where, then, is this wondrous secret?

It is what the ancients called *“concentrating the spirit in the void, merging the qi in the boundless.”*
To concentrate the spirit in the void and merge the qi in the boundless is like dwelling in the *dantian*, yet not fixating the gaze inward to stare, nor forcing the spirit-qi to cluster within. Only by concentrating the spirit at the *qìhài* [navel region], not far from the flesh and skin—this is the meaning of *“neither within nor without.”*

With intent focused here, one feels the breath at the nostrils cease, while the *dantian*’s qi rolls and churns at the juncture of inner and outer, knotting into a mass. One then sees the *embroidering-and-fuling*, the *hun-hun wū-wū*—the boundless, lively, and unrestrained movement, as it ebbs and flows, truly merging with Heaven’s primordial qi in seamless unity. Life’s essence, life’s qi, and life’s spirit all arise here, not far from Heaven.

This is the meaning of *“merging the qi in the boundless.”*
The ancients called it *“primordial qi,”* *“fetal breathing,”* *“the True Person’s breath reaching the heels.”*—what else could it be?

This *primordial qi* is the undifferentiated, formless, nameless, and boundless *hun-hun wū-wū*—a single, pure breath. As for *fetal breathing*, when a person first receives breath in the womb, the body is nourished there before the mouth and nostrils open—how else could breath be taken? Only this *qìhài*’s qi, connecting with the mother’s navel-wheel, allows growth to unfold. When the child emerges with a cry, this qi then circulates through the nostrils, each establishing its own *qián-kūn* [heaven-earth]. My demonstration shows the *qìhài*’s qi interfacing with the external Heavenly breath—neither within nor without, *embroidering-and-fuling* in fusion, blending into one—this is returning to the initial moment of receiving breath, reconnecting with the mother’s qi. This is *fetal breathing*.

As for *“the True Person’s breath reaching the heels,”* it means the True Person’s breath is stored deeply and extended subtly—unseen, unheard, untouchable, profound and sealed, like breath reaching the soles of the feet. Though the breath of the nostrils can be used, it must follow its natural course; one must not rely solely on it for inhalation and exhalation. If one uses only this breath without concentrating the spirit at the *qìhài*—one inch and three *fēn* below the navel—failing to find this void within, to draw Heaven’s breath into the boundless, the clear and turbid will remain intermixed, and the elixir cannot be forged.

The ancients said:
*“Heaven’s single true breath gives birth to man—
this breath is neither mouth nor nostril,
nor the knowing, moving soul.”*
They also said:
*“The Mysterious Female’s gate few know—
do not wastefully act through mouth and nostrils.
Though you practice inhalation and exhalation for a thousand years,
how will you grasp the Golden Rooster and the Hare?”*
From these words alone, it is clear: *“Exit through the Mysterious, enter through the Female”*—this lies between the *dantian* and the flesh, one inch and three *fēn* below the navel, where the vapors condense into a unified whole.

Those who study the Dao—whether during tea or meals, in speech or social exchange—should subtly focus a little intent on this void within, naturally merging the qi in the boundless. One will then perceive the true qi stirring, in a wonder beyond naming. Yet in this breath-work, awareness does not enter inward, and the *kǎn* [water] naturally clarifies.

This is the unspoken secret of generations of immortals and sages. I now reveal it plainly—later scholars must not dismiss it as mere words.

**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Calamity and Fortune Intertwined**

When governance is *mèn-mèn* [dim and indistinct],
the people are *chún-chún* [pure and sincere].
When governance is *chá-chá* [sharp and scrutinizing],
the people are *quē-quē* [deficient and weary].

Calamity and fortune lean upon each other;
fortune and calamity lie hidden within.
Who knows their ultimate end?
Perhaps there is no fixed principle.

What is upright becomes strange;
what is good becomes ominous.
The people’s confusion has long endured.

Thus the sage is square yet does not cut,
sharp yet does not pierce,
straight yet does not overreach,
bright yet does not dazzle.

Heaven and Earth act without intent yet transform and nourish;
the sovereign rules without action yet achieves harmony.
This is the Dao of *wuwei*—
the great principle and law by which the sage opened Heaven and Earth,
harmonized the world, and ordered all things.

The ruler governs the myriad people,
regulating all beneath Heaven—
nothing surpasses this.
If one resorts to *youwei* [action],
governance is not true governance,
rule is not true rule.
Though literature may flourish and achievements gleam,
one cannot achieve the *xīxī yùyù* [harmonious and radiant] age of shared joy and prosperity.

Thus the *Tàishàng* [Supreme Sage] said:
*“Governance is rectification”—*
rectifying others through one’s own rectitude.

From ancient times, those who ruled the people
established human norms and ordered Heaven’s patterns,
acting as if knowing yet not knowing,
acting as if acting yet not acting—
letting Heaven’s natural impulses move freely.
They never forced clever schemes,
invented measures, or promulgated laws.
Yet through a single virtue, they resonated in harmony,
transmitting meaning beyond words.

Thus its governance is dim and unassuming,
as though simple and unknowing.
Yet the people’s trust and sincerity
remain pure and unchanging,
retaining the ancient virtue of old.
The ruler governs through non-action,
the people transform through non-action—
ruler and ruled alike rest in the tranquil Heaven,
oh, how splendid this peace!

If the ruler instead strives with vigor,
exhausting effort to govern,
rooting out wickedness while elevating the worthy,
recording even minor virtues and punishing grave offenses,
with rewards and punishments as clear as ice and mirror,
and oversight as stern as divine judgment—
then governance becomes meticulous,
no one escapes its scrutiny—
yet is this not also worthy of weight?

But when the ruler demands excessive precision,
the people respond with cunning schemes,
boasting their petty cleverness.
The ruler acts, the people imitate—
how difficult it is to govern the people’s hearts!

If the source is not purified above,
the root cannot be rectified below.
Non-action is the pristine truth of the primal Heaven,
action is the contrived artifice of later cultivation.
The effects of dimness and meticulousness are thus pure and mixed.

This is clear: one principle alone—
to split it is error.

Before Heaven’s *Tàijí* divided,
before purity was split,
there was no name for yin and yang,
no distinction of good and evil.
The *Yì* says:
*“Simple, thus easily known;
frugal, thus easily followed.”*
This is why such governance can endure.

But when the primal *Tàipú* is incomplete,
when yin and yang span beginning to end,
when misfortune and fortune alternate—
misfortune within fortune, fortune within misfortune—
this is how calamity and blessing cycle endlessly.

Thus action is not necessarily unvirtuous,
but when things reach their limit, they reverse.
The interplay of yin and yang is inherent.
Who can know the ultimate end and preserve true governance?

Moreover, when rectitude returns, it becomes eccentric;
when virtue reverses, it becomes ominous.
Non-action’s governance is pure as Heaven.
Action’s governance is mixed with human contrivance.
Mixed with human contrivance—
rectitude contains eccentricity, virtue contains ominousness.
Its mechanisms arise from subtle beginnings,
its responses unfold through influence,
its momentum is relentless.

No wonder deceit and guile become habitual,
ingrained until none awaken.
This has been so for ages.

Thus the Sage governs the world,
rooting governance in the Way of non-action,
rectifying himself to transform others.
The square is square without knowing its squareness—
perhaps it masters adaptability without rigid rules?
The austere is austere without knowing its austerity—
perhaps it blends with the common, its light unbroken?
At times, uprightness is not blind compliance,
nor is it unchecked indulgence.
Upholding principle in action, never daring excess—
its rigid yet revered norms are truly awe-inspiring.

As for transforming all beings,
its benevolence extends to the four quarters,
like stars and clouds in radiant display,
yet it hides itself, never flaunting its brilliance.
How does it vanish its traces and silence its voice?

This is non-action as essence,
naturalness as function—
governing through desire, applying principle.
When the winds of the four directions stir,
who could fail to join in harmonious transformation,
to wander together in the ancient Heaven?

Is this not so?

The Dao is called the Great Dao,
the elixir is called the Golden Elixir—
both are nameless, formless.

In Heaven, it is the clear and empty *qi*;
in man, it is the void and natural.
From beginning to end of cultivation,
nothing transcends this.

If one knows the boundless and indistinct
is the root of the Great Dao,
the origin of the Golden Elixir—
and from the utmost stillness and sincerity,
nurtures the undifferentiated, the unknowing,
the thoughtless and desireless true essence—
then one’s nature, emotions, vital essence, and spirit
are all things of the primal *Tàihé* *qi*.
With this to cultivate the Dao, the Dao is complete;
with this to refine the elixir, the elixir is perfected—
what strange danger or peril remains?

But if one ignores non-action as foundation,
fixating only on action as achievement,
then knowledge never ceases,
disturbance only multiplies—
how could one avoid falling into the later, shaped, and chaotic?

The Supreme Sage likens governance to the Dao,
compares the people to the body.
Cultivating the Dao through primal non-action
forges an unbreakable golden body;
cultivating the Dao through later awareness
how could it avoid duality of spirit?
Even if refined well,
it is but a preserved corpse—
how could it transcend yin and yang,
escape birth and death,
and become an immortal for all ages?

Worse still, if one falls into action,
the *Tàijí* divides and yin and yang arise,
yin and yang separate and good and evil emerge—
then calamity and blessing alternate.

Who knows that the ultimate attainment of cultivation,
though it may require some action,
must arise from action within non-action,
from function within non-function,
only then avoiding extremes?

Mencius said: *“Act, yet do not force.”*
This is the essence of cultivation.

The human heart—
when one aspect moves, another stirs;
when one aspect is yin, another is yang.
Evil and rectitude, good and bad—
they cycle and interweave without end.
Thus rectitude contains eccentricity,
virtue contains ominousness.
Only in undivided oblivion,
where no distinction of rectitude and eccentricity exists,
can good and evil vanish.
Otherwise, rectitude returns as eccentricity,
virtue reverses as ominousness.

Zhuangzi said:
*“Heaven honors non-action as supreme,
man burdens himself with action.”*
Thus, when action arises,
it must return to non-action
to avoid the disaster of overturning the elixir.

Alas, the common folk—
speak of the elixir, and they cling to the *dāntián*;
fixate on the River Vehicle’s path,
confined within the body—
their failure to awaken to non-action’s essence
has endured for ages.

Only the sage understands the Dao of cultivation.
Though there are fire and timing, medicines and elixirs,
dragon-tiger pairings, male-female unions,
cauldrons, furnaces, zithers, and swords—
all these names and forms are but the traps and snares for fish and rabbits:
use them to catch the fish and rabbits,
but once the fish and rabbits are in hand,
forget the traps and snares.
If one clings to names and forms,
they are not the Dao.

Thus, square when square,
honest when honest,
straight when straight,
bright when bright—
yet all must return to non-action,
to doing nothing while doing,
to merging into the boundless void.

Let the student take the Dao of natural non-action as essence.
Only when essence is established may action follow.
Even with action, it remains non-action.

Do you know?
Do you believe?

**Chapter 59: Eternal Life and Longevity**
To govern humanity and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
Only frugality is early cultivation.
Early cultivation is called accumulating virtue.
Accumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquered.
Nothing unconquered means its limits are unknown;
unknown limits mean one can possess a realm.
Possessing a realm’s foundation means eternal life and longevity.

The way to govern humanity is the way to serve Heaven—
Heaven and humanity are fundamentally one *qi*.
Thus, governing humanity is the means to serve Heaven,
and serving Heaven does not go beyond governing humanity.
Do not say Heaven’s Dao is distant—
it dwells within humanity’s nearest path.
If you do not know Heaven’s Dao,
first observe human nature.
To exhaust human affairs is to fulfill Heaven’s Dao.
Though high and low may seem distant,
if the people are settled, Heaven’s will is unified.

Its essence lies in prioritizing agriculture and roots,
teaching the people to till and sow first.
For the people are the foundation of the state,
and food is the people’s Heaven.
When frugality is practiced,
clothing and food are abundant,
and families are secure.
As Mencius said:
*“Cultivate the five grains,
and when the grains ripen, the people thrive.”*
Again he said:
*“When the sage governs the world,
making grain and fire as accessible as water,
how could the people fail to be benevolent?”*
Thus, those in power must urgently practice frugality,
so the people may take joy in their work,
live in peace,
and nurture life while honoring death.

Before they even see or hear,
their hearts are already served,
and they willingly turn toward it,
as if feasting on the finest sacrifices.
This is virtue cultivated without speech,
elevated without proclamation.

Even with three years of labor and one of rest,
or nine years of labor and three of rest,
with abundant millet and sorghum,
brewing wine and *li* for offerings,
bestowing upon ancestors and conducting rites—
virtue accumulates layer upon layer.
Who else but this could achieve it?

Thus, the enlightened Heaven is reopened,
and boundless blessings are bestowed.
Naturally, the weak are protected,
the ignorant guided,
the chaotic subdued,
and the reckless preserved—
nothing they confront is unconquered.
Their advance is unstoppable,
no foe dares to resist.
Not only neighboring states bow in awe,
but distant lands also send envoys with offerings.
Eastward and westward, northward and southward,
their influence spreads without end—
who can fathom its limits?

Without limits, the Imperial Dao flourishes,
the realm is unshakable,
and the state is secured.
As the *Han Shu* says:
*“The Yellow River like a belt,
Tai Mountain like a whetstone.
The state endures in eternal peace,
love extending to descendants.”*
This is unerring truth.

When a person governs a state,
they have the means to obtain it—
and what is that means?
The *mother-qi* of the state.
Without mother-qi, how could one obtain the state?
This is the fundamental truth all should urgently discuss.
Before possessing a state, one must seek the mother;
having possessed it, one must cherish the mother.
A state’s mother is like a tree’s root,
water’s source—
enduring and unceasing.

This is the way of governing the world,
parallel to governing the self.
Those who cultivate the Dao
can embrace unity, still the breath, and harmonize the spirit,
first seeking the *mercury child* to find the *lead mother*,
then nurturing the *lead mother* with the *mercury child*,
until lead and mercury merge,
returning to the original,
reverting to the Primordial.
This is the way of deep roots and firm foundations—
eternal life and longevity.

Thus, the ordinary becomes sage,
and humanity becomes Heaven.

The way to govern the self is no different from governing the world.
This is exhausting human affairs to fulfill Heaven’s Dao—
*“Heaven and humanity are one *qi*,
mutually responsive and unified.
Yang descends from the void,
embracing me as master.”*
Its Dao is not beyond emptiness,
its function akin to tilling and sowing.

First, nourish, preserve, and inspect.
Then, use nature to govern emotions.
When water and fire blend,
kan and li unite,
pre-Heaven *qi* moves,
circulating the Microcosmic Orbit—
*“When Heaven and Earth’s union ceases,
a single point descends to the Yellow Court.”*

This draws the *kan*’s overflow into *li*’s void,
securing the foundation of life—
the work of human and immortal is complete.

This is like the frugal ruler clearing land and planting,
pruning and weeding before sowing the five grains.
Then, taking the *li*’s yin essence,
lowering it into the *kan*’s gate,
merging the *kan*’s yang *qi* with the *li*’s yin essence,
forming a family within the *dāntián* as medicine—
*“Where others lack, I possess;
where others are empty, I am full.”*

Until true lead emerges within,
using yang lead to subdue yin mercury—
its flighty nature no longer flees;
then using yin lead to nourish yang lead—
its sinking nature no longer sinks.
As the *Awakening to Reality* says:
*“The golden cauldron seeks to retain the cinnabar mercury,
the jade pool first descends the water-silver.”*

When lead and gold float and rise,
like dust in sunlight scattering,
the residual yang outside *kan* is exhausted,
returned to *li*’s palace.
Then the private mercury and recognition within *li*
are both dissolved,
restoring the pure yang elixir—
capable of ascending to the Han,
soaring through the heavens,
forming the divine embryo,
completing the immortal child.

「Although, its practice is not easily attained! At first, one must cultivate the will to nourish the *qi*—
like a farmer tilling the fields,
with no lack of toil and hardship.
Yet in the end, the spirit is tranquil and the *qi* is steady.

Within, the single principle is undivided and complete;
without, one adapts to the times and remains centered.
This is not done by chance once,
but aligns with the Great Dao/Way.

Through its refining nature and cultivating life,
one has long prepared to serve as a guest to the later-born—
thus severing all entanglements,
leaving not a thread behind,
fulfilling the human path to merge with the Heavenly *virtue/power*.

Like a state’s foundation,
one preserves sincere integrity and profound benevolence,
deep compassion and abundant *virtue/power*,
which enter the people’s hearts,
penetrating to the marrow and permeating the flesh—
the accumulation of such *virtue/power*,
its weight and depth,
know no bounds.

From this point onward,
nothing remains unremoved within oneself,
nothing unmastered by oneself—
Heaven’s embrace grows serene and settled,
walking the Five Phases with ease and composure.

Whether facing change or constancy,
one naturally follows one’s inherent station,
finding fulfillment in every place—
*"No matter where one goes, one finds oneself at ease."*

If this is so,
then using it to refine nature exhausts nature,
using it to cultivate life establishes life.

In the boundless void where no traces remain,
all phenomena stand complete and manifest—
truly, there is one whose depths are unknown.

The *Tàishàng* says:
*"Look inward to the heart—
the heart has no heart.
Look outward to the body—
the body has no body.
Look far to all things—
things have no things.
The emptiness of emptiness—
emptiness is not emptiness.
The nothingness of nothingness—
nothingness is not nothingness."*
Those who can awaken to this
may transmit the sacred Dao/Way.

This is the *"body transcends itself yet remains"*—
the body is like a state.
Just as a sovereign rules without action,
and thus stands upright before the people
to possess the state and the world,
so too with the *yin* essence within oneself,
long mingled with the father’s essence and mother’s blood—
without the *yang* *qi* of the Primordial Heaven,
it cannot generate or grow of its own accord.

Indeed, the *yin* essence of later birth
originally stems from the Primordial Heaven’s *yang*—
yet the *yin* essence is hard to stabilize,
and emotions/desires are easily unsettled.
Without the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s external, refined *yang*,
one cannot forge it into the elixir,
nor achieve enduring life and deathlessness.

Thus it is said:
*"The mother of a lasting state,
can endure forever."*
Only the Sage,
with true *yin* and true *yang*,
merges the two *qi* into one,
refining a single grain of millet—
called the *golden elixir*,
*true lead*,
or the *White Tiger’s First Scripture*—
its essence is none other than the Primordial Heaven’s single *qi*.

Through ceaseless refining within the colored body—
endless melting and washing,
gradually extracting and condensing,
sometimes simmering, sometimes refining—
the *golden elixir* is formed,
its radiance clear and distinct—
those who *"steal the *qi* of Heaven and Earth to use as elixir mother"* are such.

This is the path of deep roots and firm foundations,
of enduring life and prolonged vision.

When the refined *yang* of Heaven and Earth
is merged with one’s true *qi*,
forming the sacred embryo,
the ancient immortals spoke of:
*"The Primordial Heaven’s single *yang* first moves,
stirring a single drop of one’s own mercury to greet it."*

Thus, inner contact and outer stimulation yield form,
outer contact and inner resonance yield spirit—
like a magnet drawing iron,
naturally aligning and joining.

The mercury child seeks the water palace
to find the lead mother;
once the mother is obtained,
it then relies on the child.

Child and mother in harmony,
clustered in the central palace,
the Great Elixir is formed,
and the Sage-Immortal is realized.

The beginning and end of elixir refining,
the Great Dao/Way has already fully revealed.
Scholars must carefully ponder and discern—
though the traces and symbols may seem alike,
their subtleties differ greatly.

Yet without the right time,
one cannot know;
without a true teacher’s guidance,
one cannot understand.

This requires the convergence of
Heaven’s *yuan* (缘),
Earth’s *yuan* (缘),
and human *yuan* (缘)—
only when the three *yuan* align
can one enter the chamber and begin the work.

Later scholars must first
accumulate sincerity and cultivate *virtue/power*,
empty themselves to seek a teacher—
thus may the three *yuan* converge and entry be made.
Do not rejoice at mere attainment
and lose the resolve to ascend.

Instead, take a vow of unwavering devotion,
press forward with single-minded effort—
progress may be slow,
but persistence is key.

At the very start,
there is no crack to enter,
no opening to seize—
it is like chewing on wax pills,
tasteless and insipid.

Zhūzǐ says:
*"To study, one must be resolute and tireless,
enduring hardship with patience."*

Long toil, and eventually,
the bitter turns sweet,
the stifled yields to joy—
the Dao advances, and the heart finds its gain.

At this juncture,
when *principle* and *desire* ride together,
and Heaven and man wage war,
it is most difficult to act.

Its advance and retreat,
lie at this critical pass.
If this pass is breached,
then the beauty of the ancestral temple,
the abundance of officials,
and the endless enjoyment of rewards—
as Confucius said—
shall be attained.

Never falter or grow weak,
for if one’s own spirit dwindles,
the gate of entry will forever remain closed.

Most importantly,
empty the heart,
enlarge the will,
stir the spirit,
and cultivate *virtue/power* and achievement,
refine nature and establish life.

Know that this is
the greatest of all matters between Heaven and Earth—
without immense strength,
it cannot be accomplished.

In days past, there was a couplet:
*"Brace iron shoulders to bear the Dao’s duty,
free stiff hands to craft the words."*

Ah!
Even in the world,
a single talent or skill—
the modest pursuit of scholarly fame—
requires toil and endurance,
using all one’s true spirit
to achieve great deeds,
before Heaven’s silent blessing can be earned—
how much more so for the Dao,
the greatest of all matters!

Thus the Buddha said:
*"I descended to this realm for the sake of the great *dharma* and great *yuan* (因缘),
and so do I now."*

Scholars, upon meeting a true teacher,
must with true heart and sincere intent
embody my words—
only then may they be counted
among the great men of this world.

**Chapter Sixty: Two Do Not Harm Each Other**
Ruling a great state is like cooking fresh delicacies.
Applying the Dao/Way to the world,
its *ghosts* are not numinous.
Not because its *ghosts* are not numinous,
but because its spirit does not harm others.
Not because its spirit does not harm others,
but because the Sage also does not harm others.

Thus, when two do not harm each other,
*virtue/power* naturally returns and merges.

The Dao/Way,
is the shared principle of all under Heaven.
Using this principle to cultivate oneself,
is the same as using it to govern the world.»

「I too am thus. If scholars, having met a true teacher,
must with true heart and sincere intent
embody my words—
only then may they be counted
among the great men of this world.

**Chapter Sixty: Two Do Not Harm Each Other**

To wish to establish oneself while establishing others,
to wish to attain while attaining for others—
without waiting for a shift in thought,
without delay in time,
how easy and simple it is!

Thus the *Tàishàng* (太上) says:
“Ruling a great state is like cooking fresh delicacies.”

When a state is vast,
its affairs must be complex,
its people numerous.
If one does not grasp the Dao/Way,
then it will inevitably become chaotic and convoluted—
like trying to unravel disordered silk,
the more one attempts to govern,
the more tangled it grows.

Only by applying the Dao/Way,
the shared principle of all under Heaven,
to cultivate one’s own person
and guide the multitude—
its logic flowing through all,
its *qi* permeating universally—
does one find the path most convenient.

Otherwise, if one merely relies on
laws and decrees,
prohibitions and schemes,
tactics and calculations,
and summons the world under such rules—
then in daylight, resentment festers among the people,
and their hearts grow deceitful and multifarious;
in darkness, the *ghosts* (鬼) are provoked,
and calamities—disasters and plagues—
pile up without end.

For the people are the masters of *ghosts* and *spirits* (神).
When rulers exact harsh levies,
indulge in tyranny,
and spread their venomous influence,
leaving the people without refuge—
then *ghosts* and *spirits*,
too, find no attachment,
and must rise in rebellion,
bringing ruin and sickness.
Thus did the *stone spirit* (石言) appear in *Jìn* (晉),
the *comet* (彗) in *Qí* (齐),
the *serpent battle* (蛇斗) in *Zhèng* (郑),
*Bó Yǒu* (伯有) become a scourge,
*Shēn Shēng* (申生) descend as a *ling* (灵) spirit,
the *Two Young Men* (二竖) fell into grave illness from dreams,
*Yǒu Shēn* (有莘) descended and *Guó* (虢) perished—
all these were acts of *ghosts* and *spirits*,
yet they arose because the ruler lacked the Dao/Way.

For those who govern the people,
if they truly cultivate the Dao/Way in themselves,
and transform the people with the Dao/Way—
though the *ghosts* (鬼) are *yīn* (阴) *qi*,
when they find their proper refuge,
even the most stubborn *ghosts* (鬼) will willingly follow.
The people will have no grievances,
and the *ghosts* will bring no calamities.
Mountains and rivers will not crumble,
and crops will not be plagued by monstrous anomalies.
In harmony and brightness,
one may sit and bask in the blessings of peace.

The *Shū* (书) says:
*“Our ancient sovereigns,
when they diligently cultivated their virtue/power,
there were no celestial calamities,
and the mountain rivers, ghosts and spirits,
all remained tranquil.”*

This is not because the *ghosts* are not numinous!
For *jīnglì wāngliáng* (魑魅魍魉),
as well as mountain spirits and water monsters,
all depend on some foundation,
and have their fixed offerings.
When left to their natural course,
they meddle in nothing.
Though they have spirit,
they have no means to act—
even if they act,
how could they ever prevail?

Thus, *yīn* and *yáng* (阴阳),
people and *ghosts*,
all frolic together
beneath the radiant Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth—
how could there be any harm to people?

Nor is it because the *spirits* do not harm others.
It is because the Sage,
with the Dao/Way in hand,
lacks the scheming wisdom of the petty,
nor the ostentatious benevolence of the self-aggrandizing.
They guard their own person with reverence,
cherish the natural bonds of humanity,
hold fast to respect,
act with simplicity,
avoiding all unnecessary entanglements—
not a single particle
ever harms another.

It lies in the harmony of *yīn* and *yáng*,
whereby people and things flourish,
and in the grandeur of rites and sacrifices,
whereby *ghosts* and *spirits* find peace.
In the realm of the unseen,
the two do not encroach upon each other.
Thus the world naturally submits
to the Sage’s virtue/power and returns to it.

Ah! The Dao/Way of *non-action* (無為),
both near and far—
taken from the self,
extended to all things—
is the way to rule the world,
and also the way to refine
the *Great Elixir of Return* (大還之丹).

In a world of great peace,
when governance reaches its highest principle,
and the realm is flourishing—
the ruler acts without action,
and the world transforms without coercion.
All *ghostly* mischief and *spiritual* malevolence
vanish without trace,
not because they are destroyed,
but because they are naturally dissolved
by the Dao/Way of *non-action*,
and their schemes collapse
without any means to act.
Droughts, floods, plagues, and epidemics
find no foothold.

In the human body,
the *ghost* is the *yīn* (阴) aspect—
still, silent, and unaware.
The *spirit* is the *yáng* (阳) aspect—
dynamic, active, and purposeful.

The great practitioner,
with a mind that encompasses all things yet remains without mind,
and emotions that respond to all yet are without emotion—
*yīn* within *yáng*,
*yáng* within *yīn*—
stillness without stillness,
movement without movement.
Movement and stillness
interact in their functions;
*yīn* and *yáng*
mutually sustain each other.

It is not that awareness is utterly absent
or that action is entirely non-existent.
Rather, within *non-awareness* (無覺),
there is true awareness;
within *non-action* (無為),
there is true action.

When it says *“its ghosts are not numinous”*,
it does not mean they are dull and lifeless.
For the awareness within *non-awareness*
is the true and equal awakening;
the action within *non-action*
is but the natural unfolding
of Heaven’s will.
How could it compare
to the false pretenses of those with awareness,
or the rigid adherence of those with action,
which only harm the original elixir?

When it says *“its spirit does not harm others”*,
it is not that the *spirit* does not harm others,
but that the Dao/Way of *non-action*
nurtures the innate purity of human life,
the ceaseless vitality of *yīn* and *yáng*,
the unending sincerity,
and the complete embodiment of all things.

Though there be creation and destruction,
in truth there is no loss or gain;
though there be fullness and emptiness,
in essence there is no increase or decrease.»

「This is what is meant by *unperturbed and unalarmed*—
free from worry and care.
How could it harm others?

It is not that the Sage does not harm others,
but rather that with the *vital impulse* of life’s essence,
they restore the original purity of existence;
that with the *harmonious trance* of 三昧 (*sāṃdhi/samādhi*),
they cultivate the *free-flowing elixir* of self-mastery.
Once the *Divine Fire* refines,
the spirits wail and demons shriek,
the malevolent forces retreat in terror—
the True Person emerges.
This is called *“mutual non-injury”*—
who could say it is unfit?

Both Heaven and Earth
reverence their virtue.
Ah! The interplay of *dark* and *bright* (*yīn* and *míng*),
not the *virtue/power* of spirits alone,
how could it reach such heights?

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Should Descend**
The great realm descends to the lesser—
the *pivot of the world*, the *receptive mother* of the world.
The *receptive mother* ever takes the *vigorous* (*yáng*) through stillness,
and stillness as its descent.
Thus, the great realm descends to the small realm,
and the small realm is taken by the great;
either descending to take,
or descending while taken.
The great realm seeks only to *enfold* others,
the small realm seeks only to *submit* to others.
When both attain their desires,
the great is rightly suited to descend.

The *Tàishàng* speaks of *cultivating the Dao/Way and refining the elixir*—
all must be guided by *gentleness*,
and anchored in *stillness*.
Though it may be said that *gentleness* is useless weakness,
and *seclusion* hard to achieve,
yet at the outset of *meditative sitting*,
movement must arise from stillness,
and *rigidity* from *gentleness*—
only then is the true Dao/Way revealed.

The analogy *“the great realm descends”* speaks of water,
which has both ascent and descent—
the water above must flow downward
before it finds its end.
If the great realm humbles itself,
without a trace of arrogance or pretense,
it will be revered by all under Heaven—
just as the lowlands gather streams from every direction,
so too its influence is inevitable.

Thus it is called *“the pivot of the world.”*
When the world’s realms converge,
it is because they can descend.
Descending, their *qi* is most *gentle*—
not the utmost *rigidity*.
What is more *vigorous* than the *vigorous* (*yáng*)?
What is more *gentle* than the *receptive* (*yīn*)?
The *vigorous* is *yáng*, the *rigid*;
the *receptive* is *yīn*, the *gentle*.
It is fitting that the *vigorous* (*yáng*) should overcome the *gentle* (*yīn*).
Yet why does the *receptive* often prevail over the *vigorous*?
It is because the *receptive* possesses *stillness*.

The ancients said, *“Stillness governs movement”—*
their words hold no flaw,
just as descent follows ascent—
its force is inevitable.

Much less so for the great realm,
which lowers itself to *nurture* the lesser,
and *virtues* itself to *uplift* others—
could there ever be a realm
that does not come to *revere* or *submit*?

The great realm is the model of *high virtue*,
while *stillness* is the foundation of descent.
From ancient times to now,
the great realm descends to the small realm—
like *Tāng* humbling *Gě Bó*,
ultimately gaining *Gě’s* land,
soothing and possessing it—
or the small realm submits to the great—
like *Gōujī* humbling the *King of Wú*,
eventually gaining *Wú’s* dominion,
encompassing and holding it—
sometimes the great realm does not assert its greatness
but adopts the small realm’s posture,
thus taking the small realm as easily as turning a palm—
sometimes the small realm rests content in its smallness
and serves the great realm,
thus taking the great realm as effortlessly as picking up a blade of grass.

Discussing the mighty realms,
they truly serve as the standard for all nations,
yet in *soothing and guiding* them there is method,
and in *encompassing with kindness* there is strategy.
They do not seek to *annex* all under Heaven,
to unify the mountains and rivers—
rather, they seek to *enfold* the small realms,
making the world one family.
Only those with *great virtue* surpassing others
can achieve such *tranquil inclusiveness*.

It is fitting that the world should converge in *Rén* (*benevolence/heart*),
and all directions submit to *Mìng* (*command/ordain*).
The petty, insignificant realms—
all equal in their *feudal apportionments*,
as *vassal ministers* offering frequent tributes,
rushing forward in fear of falling behind—
they do not desire to *elevate themselves* and *take humiliation*,
nor to *preserve the ancestral temples* and *extend their longevity*—
only to *submit to others* and *ensure their own survival*,
to prolong the *lasting breaths* of the people.
Yet even this requires *great wisdom* surpassing others,
to *restrain themselves* and *descend*—
only then can they be *loved and revered* by the people,
and *Mìng* (*command/ordain*) come to them.

Moreover, humans must have *aspirations* and *desires*—
now the great realm desires to *enfold* others,
the small realm desires to *submit*—
both attain their desires,
one through *Rén* (*benevolence/heart*), one through *wisdom*,
yet neither falls into the *private* pursuits of human desire—
this proves that great and small realms alike
follow their *natural course*,
rest in their *allotted roles*,
and none dare *transgress* their duties.

Though the small realm descends by nature,
its principle is fixed—
the great realm should *especially* descend,
only then does the *single person* stand erect,
and the world find its *reliance*.

The governance of the age is thus—
how much more so in governing one’s body?
*“The great realm”* is an analogy for *original spirit*—
*“descending”* refers to *spirit-light* descending to illuminate the *elixir field*,
while *yīn* essence also descends into the *elixir field*.
When the *Divine Fire* refines,
the essence transforms into *qi*—
this is the *elixir field*, the *original pass*.

The human body’s *total support* (*zǒngchí*),
the *convergence* of the *Five Qi*,
the *condensation* of the *Three Flowers*—
all refine into the *elixir embryo*,
emerge as *spirit* and enter *sainthood*—
none of it occurs without this *single elixir field*.

Thus it is called *“the pivot of the world”*—
like all rivers converging at the sea,
this is where the *elixir* is refined.
Yet the *method of alchemy* values *gentle, yielding essence* as primary,
so it takes its metaphor from the *receptive mother* of the world.

The *receptive mother* is *gentle* and *harmonious*—
this is the *Tàishàng*’s *Dao/Way*,
also called *“concentrating *qi* to achieve *gentleness*”*.
Such *utter gentleness* and *harmony* allow the *original essence*
to dissolve and transform,
giving rise to *qi* and then to *spirit*.

And the *original essence* within,
when *stillness* is held to *nurture* the *kidney-qi*,
until the *Divine Fire* refines,
the essence turns into *qi*—
then the *reverse cultivation* technique is applied,
the *inverted function* performed,
raising and ascending it,
consuming and ingesting it,
returning it to the *earthen cauldron* to *lead govern mercury*,
thus *using the vigorous to govern the receptive*—
this is the work after the *River Vehicle*.

Yet in the *beginning of meditation*,
the *heart* is *external yáng* and *internal yīn*,
while the *kidneys* are *external yīn* and *internal yáng*».

「When considering the post-natal body and its form,
the *external yáng* of the *heart* is the *sacrificial altar* (社),
while the *external yīn* of the *kidneys* is the *receptive* (牝).

Now, when *li* (離) is *empty* (虚) it becomes *yīn*,
and when *kān* (坎) is *full* (满) it becomes *yáng*—
this is what *The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) says:
*“Though others are hosts, I am the guest”*;
it is also said:
*“Yáng is the male body, even in women;
yīn is the female body, even in men.”*
This is the *inversion of Heaven and Earth*,
where *li* reverses to become *male* (牡),
and *kān* reverses to become *receptive* (牝).

The method of cultivation demands
that the *heart*’s rigid *qi* be transformed into *gentleness*,
and its restless nature be made *still*;
while the *kidneys*’ *gentle qi* becomes *rigid*,
and its *stillness* turns *active*.

Thus, the *gentle and harmonious* nature of *li*
nurtures the *vigorous and male* essence of *kān*—
this is the saying:
*“Fire nourishes wood’s essence within,
water forges adamantine gold.”*

One must *use the heart to direct the qi*
and *use nature to restrain emotions*.
When emotions do not move recklessly,
it is through *silent stillness* and *gentleness*,
through *humility and forbearance*—
this refines the *heart-nature* (心性).

Therefore, the *sweet nectar* (美液) of the *Upper Field* (上田)
flows into the *Primordial Sea* (元海);
the *essence-liquid* (液) then transforms into *qi*
and enters the *Elixir Field* (丹田).
*“The Great State submits to the Small State”* (大国下小国)
refers to the descent from the *Upper Field* to the *Lower Field* (下田).

*“Taking the Small State”* (取小国)
means extracting the *kidney-yang* (金水) *qi* of the *Elixir Field*,
operating the *River Vehicle* (河车) in reverse,
and ascending it to the *Heavenly Valley* (天谷).

*“The Small State submits to the Great State”* (小国下大国)
refers again to ascending from the *Lower Field* (下田) to *Kūnlún* (昆仑),
then descending into the *Yellow Court* (黄庭).

To *“take the Great State”* (取大国)
is to merge the *golden essence* (金液) of *Kūnlún*
and direct it into the *Yellow Court*.

I use the *sweet nectar* (甘液) of the *Upper Field*
to flow into the *Lower Elixir Field* (下丹田) and generate *qi*,
so when one extracts the *qi* of the *Elixir Field*,
it is the *Great State* descending to take it.
Or, when the *Elixir Field*’s *qi* ascends in reverse to the *Heavenly Valley* (天谷) to generate *essence-liquid*,
then swallowing the *Heavenly Valley*’s *qi*
is the *Small State* descending to take it.

This is the *golden essence* and *kidney-yang* ascending,
*lead-qi* merging with marrow,
*essence* condensing and *qi* harmonizing—
in a moment’s breath, transforming into *sweet dew* (甘露) *divine water* (神水),
flowing to the *upper palate* (上腭),
dropping and returning to its source—
the moment when *essence-liquid* transforms into *qi*.

When the *qi-mechanism* (气机) is fully robust,
once more the *River Vehicle* is operated,
directing it upward to *Kūnlún*,
swallowing the *marrow-essence* (髓精) of the *Brain Sea* (脑海),
and descending it into the *Yellow Court*—
this is the moment when *qi* transforms into *essence-liquid*.

Yet the *Great State*’s *“descending flow”* (下流)
is through *gentleness* and *stillness*,
restful and capacious—
truly possessing *virtue* beyond that of ordinary people,
this is the *spirit* transforming *qi* while *qi* refines *essence*,
filling the *Elixir Field* with abundance.

Thus, there is one who seeks to *accumulate the virtue of others* (畜人之德),
and the *Small State* also has *inner clarity* (内朗) *wisdom* (之智),
knowing its own *power* cannot rival the *Great*—
willingly submitting in homage and obedience,
truly possessing *magnanimity* beyond that of ordinary people.
This is when *essence* generates *qi*, *qi* generates *spirit*,
and all returns in dependence to the *Yellow Court*.

Thus, there is also the *Dao* of *entering to serve others*.
Both seek the same goal without external attachment,
so the *elixir* completes its *nine transformations* (九转),
the *Way* ascends to the *Nine Heavens* (九天),
and one abides eternally with *Heaven and Earth* in shared longevity.

How does their *virtue* intermingle and return?
The supreme secret of refining the body
lies nowhere beyond this—
those who attain it should treasure it,
and not reveal it lightly.

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Most Precious for All Under Heaven**
The *Dao* is the *mystery* of all things,
a treasure for the *virtuous* and a safeguard for the unvirtuous.
*Beautiful speech* can be traded,
*noble conduct* can elevate one’s standing.
Since people are unvirtuous,
why should they be abandoned?

Thus, the *sacrificial altar* (社) and the *three ministers* (三公) are established for the *Son of Heaven*,
though there are *arching walls* to precede the *four steeds* (先驷马),
nothing compares to sitting and advancing this *Dao*.

Why did the ancients hold this *Dao* as most precious?
Is it not to *seek and obtain* it,
to *avoid blame* through its practice?

Thus, it is the most precious for all under Heaven.
The *Great Dao* arises before *Heaven and Earth*,
mingles within *emptiness and non-being*,
faint and obscure—
unseen, unheard, untouched—
yet truly the foundation upon which all things depend for their existence.

*Master Zǐsī* (子思子) said:
*“The *Way* of the *virtuous* is costly yet hidden.”*
Without *Dao*, there is no thing;
without thing, there is no *Dao*.
From the *Great Cycle* (大周) to the *sand boundary* (沙界),
down to the finest *dust-mote* (微尘),
it cannot be sought through *traces or symbols*,
nor exhausted through *words or speech*.
Truly, it contains the *ultimate* without and the *ultimate* with,
the *ultimate* emptiness and the *ultimate* reality—
vast and boundless, profound and unfathomable.
No mystery surpasses this.

The *virtuous* know this *Dao* is the most vital for the human body,
so they cherish and conceal it,
cultivate and treasure it,
never willing to part with it even for a moment.
The unvirtuous also know there is a *Dao*—
practicing it preserves the body and brings *blessings* (福),
while abandoning it shortens life and invites *calamity* (祸).
No better strategy exists for safeguarding the body.

Moreover, when this *Dao* of *Middle Way* (中庸) is expressed in *speech*,
it becomes *beautiful speech*—
like precious goods sold in the marketplace,
all know to love and admire it,
and wish to touch and possess it.
When this *Dao* of *ordinary* (寻常) *Way* is seen in *conduct*,
it becomes *noble conduct*—
like the *status* of a *great lord* or *eminent official*,
all respect and honor it,
and seek to elevate and exalt it.
If it cannot be expressed in *speech*,
then trading in it only invites *humiliation*;
if it cannot be demonstrated in *conduct*,
then offering it only invites *slander*.

The *Classic of Poetry* (《诗》) says:
*“Heaven nurtures the common people,
endowing them with things and principles.
The people’s inherent nature,
loves this *virtue* of *goodness* (懿德).”*
This shows that though *virtue* and *vice* differ,
the heart’s love for *virtue* remains the same.

When I see one who is *virtuous*,
I revere them.
If I see one who is unvirtuous,
why should I despise them?
It is merely the *qi* and *nature* (气质) of their disposition
or the *desires* (物欲) yet unrefined,
that cause them to stray from the *Dao*.
Yet their origin is ultimately no different.

If one can *transform* and *guide* them,
even the most wicked person
may turn toward *virtue*.
Great indeed is the *Dao*’s power—
*Heaven and Earth* abandon no thing,
the *sage* abandons no person.

If one abandons a person,
it is self-abandonment—
how could the *Dao* permit such a thing?

*Heaven* creates the people and establishes their *rulers*,
making them *teachers* as well,
so that they may govern all under Heaven
and place the *three ministers* in order—
this is to *harmonize and guide* the *people*,
to *transform and lead* the *multitudes*.

To *rectify* one’s own body
is to *rectify* the court;
to *rectify* the court
is to *rectify* all under Heaven.»

「Let all nations and regions be in harmony,
and winds shall stir from all directions—
the *Son of Heaven* shall long preserve his reverence,
the *three ministers* shall long enjoy their honors,
and only then shall the task be complete.

If one cannot uphold the *Dao* as *Heaven’s Way*,
to renew and sustain the *people*,
how could one forever preserve *Heaven’s Mandate*,
and enjoy boundless blessings?

Even with the *nobility* of arched walls and treasures arrayed before,
and the *wealth* of four-horse chariots racing behind,
one cannot rest in ease for a moment.

How much better to approach the *Dao* daily and nightly,
ever vigilant, never forgetting,
and thus naturally advance along the *Way*!

The *Chu Book* says:
*"The treasure of Chu is none other than virtue—*
*virtue alone is its treasure."*

The *Shang Book* says:
*"Treasure only the worthy,*
*and the people shall be near and at peace."*

This is the *Dao*—
the most prized by ancient emperors, kings, ministers, and officials alike.

Why did the ancients hold this *Dao* in such esteem?
Because the *Dao* is the inherent *Way* of all people;
seek it, and you shall find it—
its pursuit is swift and effortless.

If one upholds this *Dao*,
they become a true *hero* among mortals;
if one defies this *Dao*,
they become a great *offender* against *Heaven and Earth*.

Is it merely a matter of having faults
and yet failing to avoid the path of depravity?

*Master Zisi* said:
*"The *Dao* must never be abandoned for an instant."*

Let people strive earnestly!
For the *Dao* is a great matter in life—
whether *Son of Heaven*, *three ministers*, or all others,
one must cherish and guard it diligently.

Though one may possess arched walls and four-horse chariots,
it is better to sit and cultivate the *Dao*—
do not claim old age or depleted *qi* as excuses,
for self-deception is no defense.

Know this: even if one borrows *post-heaven* essence, *qi*, and spirit
to forge *golden elixir* and *jade elixir*,
and attain *transcendence* or *sainthood*,
this is but a trifling matter.

The ancients said:
*"The *Dao* is the Great Harmony,"*
and also:
*"The *Dao* is the Void of Non-being."*

Thus, it is clear that those who study the *Dao*
yet fail to grasp the principle of *Void* and *Non-being*,
even if they refine essence and subdue *qi*,
or meditate in *non-duality*,
shall remain no different from the common folk.

Therefore, in cultivating the *Dao* and forging the elixir,
one must take the *Original Spirit* as the master,
the *Original Qi* as the assistant to the spirit,
and *True Breathing* as the means to refine the elixir.

Without the *Original Spirit*,
there is no foundation for the elixir;
without the *Original Qi*,
there is no aid for the elixir.

This is like a womb containing an infant—
without the union of the father’s essence and the mother’s blood,
it remains empty and without substance.

Having obtained the *Original Spirit* and *Original Qi*,
without *True Breathing* to govern them,
the spirit and *qi* cannot coalesce in unity,
merge into one,
and return to the pristine origin of *Great Simplicity*.

I further impart this truth:
When mortals cultivate and refine,
having gained the *Original Spirit* and *Original Qi*,
and mastered *True Breathing*,
they must gather the five into clusters of four,
and merge the three into one—
yet without *True Intent* as their guiding commander,
the *qi* and spirit shall scatter and disperse,
and the elixir shall never form of its own accord.

But whence does *True Intent* arise?
It must emerge from the state of *Void* and *stillness*,
of *ignorance* and *unawareness*—
when suddenly, the *qi*-mechanism is touched,
and awareness begins,
this is the *True Intent*,
not the same as the ordinary mind or intent.

Thus the ancients said:
*"Sainthood is not attained by others—*
*only by those who cultivate this true nature."*

Yet without drawing *qi* from *water* and *essence*,
as resources and assistance,
even the innate true nature shall hang suspended and empty,
and risk falling into the *coarse void*.

Having known the birth of the *golden elixir*,
without *True Breathing* to regulate and nurture it,
how could one gather and refine it into the elixir?

Thus, *True Breathing* is the essential tool for forging the elixir,
and *True Intent* is the sovereign ruler of *True Breathing*.

Those who study the *Dao* yet fail to unite spirit and *qi*,
how could they attain *stillness*?

If one attains the return of spirit and *qi*,
they must ferment and nurture deeply—
only then shall the *golden elixir* be fully realized.

Do not stir the *Bright Awareness* of the ordinary mind,
lest the *golden elixir* and *wood elixir* be separated,
and the *Kan* and *Li* fail to interact.

Through this, I illuminate the mysteries of the *Dao*—
later scholars who gain insight from it
must treasure and guard it carefully!

**Chapter Sixty-Three: The Great as Non-action, the Non-action as Action**

The great is *non-action*,
the *non-action* is action,
the *non-action* is flavorless.

The great and the small,
the many and the few,
repay resentment with *virtue*.

Plan for difficulty in its ease,
and achieve the great in its smallness.

The most difficult matters under *Heaven*
must be done in their simplicity;
the greatest matters under *Heaven*
must be done in their minutiae.

Therefore, the *sage* never strives for the great,
and thus achieves it.

Light promises must be few,
for many shall be untrustworthy;
many undertakings must be few,
for many shall bring difficulty.

Thus the *sage* fears difficulty,
and thus encounters none.

The *Dao* is inherently *Middle Way*—
all may study it, all may attain it.
Yet because of *things* obscuring and *qi* constraining,
without forceful pruning and removal,
how could one perceive the original face?

Like washing clothes: though long stained by dust and filth,
one cannot clean them in a single step—
they must be slowly scrubbed,
gently plucked,
until the old rags are made new again.

If one uses too much force,
not only shall the filth not be removed,
but the clothes may be torn.

Thus, those who seek to penetrate the original truth
must not rush recklessly forward—
at first, they must exert themselves,
but avoid hasty, unmeasured force;
in time, they shall follow the *Middle Way*,
and naturally see the original face.

When their work reaches the stage of refining *Void* into the *Dao*,
they achieve *non-action*;
when they respond to *Nature* without contrivance,
they achieve *actionless action*.
Plain and unremarkable,
what flavor could there be?

Having no flavor,
what satiety could there be?

As for the great returning to the small,
the many yielding to the few,
until the point of retribution—
this is not done through resentment,
but through *virtue*,
all of which are the most wondrous transformations,
the most complete responses to conditions.

Yet in applying this,
there is no partiality—
*virtue* is evenly bestowed;
in repaying resentment with *virtue*,
there is no discordant sentiment—
for *virtue* is the common good of all people,
and repaying with *virtue* is the natural expression of purity.»

「To treat things by returning them to their nature,
and to govern people by aligning with their own *Dao*,
is to respond with greatness and smallness, abundance and scarcity—
all movements follow the natural order of Heaven,
each action is the *Dao*,
everywhere without distinction,
yet never conflicting with oneself,
nor ever clashing with others.

Ah, this is the *Dao* most difficult yet most simple,
most vast yet most minute.

Yet how many practitioners in the world
seek quick results and immediate gains,
often embracing what is difficult,
and favoring what is grand,
without knowing that difficulty arises from simplicity,
and grandeur stems from the minute.

Thus, all great undertakings in the world
must begin with the small.

Since the *Dao* is the root of all things,
how could one not proceed from ease to difficulty,
from minute to vast?

Otherwise, those who advance too swiftly
shall retreat just as quickly—
how then could they hope to reach the realm of divine transformation?

Therefore, the ancient sages knew
that the *Dao* has stages to traverse,
and learning has steps to ascend,
yet they did not ponder grand schemes,
only striving for the immediate essence.
They refined what was coarse,
nurtured the fundamental source,
like water permeating plants—
naturally changing day by day,
transforming month by month,
not seen to grow yet ever growing.

Thus, from the subtle beginnings,
from the crude to the refined,
they moved from *action* and *doing*
to *non-action* and *actionless action*,
ever more plain yet ever more profound,
ever closer yet ever more distant,
until they attained the realm of supreme beauty.

The sage never seeks the grand,
and thus achieves the grand.

Nowadays, scholars at their outset
aspire to become immortals,
the more ambitious their hearts,
the more difficult their tasks—
and so many falter halfway through.

Only through steadfast endurance,
with unwavering resolve,
can the difficult become easy,
the minute remain minute,
and the grand be made small.

I urge scholars to embrace difficulty in simplicity,
to attain grandeur through the minute,
to proceed with measured caution and maturity,
and thus avoid recklessness and superficiality.

Otherwise, not only will they fail to grasp the *Dao*’s profundity,
but they must cultivate sincerity and depth of heart to ever succeed—
for those who treat oaths lightly shall lack trust,
and their regrets shall only deepen;
those who rush to inner cultivation,
favoring ease, shall often face great difficulty,
and retreat shall follow swiftly.

Such is the inevitable course of things.

Thus, the sage’s initial cultivation,
though rooted in ease and the minute,
is marked by ceaseless diligence,
unceasing caution—
for the heart’s work is never truly finished.

Only by first confronting difficulty,
then guiding it like a boat on flowing water,
doing without *doing*,
does one arrive at “no difficulty at all.”

These three lines on *“non-action”*
are the essence of pure, natural effort.
What follows—embracing difficulty in simplicity—
is the intention of seeking profound refinement through gradual approach.

As for the *Dan* method,
when speaking of *lead* and *mercury*,
what are they truly?

Let me clarify:
These substances are none other than the two poles of *yin* and *yang*.
When *mercury* is paired with *lead*,
it is as if *yin* is joined with *yang*—
after their union, primordial *qi* emerges,
then this *qi* is merged with *yin qi* in the central palace,
and thus the *elixir* is formed.

In the *Post-Heaven* realm,
*Li* is the pure *yang* of *Qian* (☰),
*Kan* is the pure *yin* of *Kun* (☷).
With the movement of *qi*,
the *Qian*’s central line enters *Kun*,
and the *Kun*’s central line enters *Qian*’s cavity—
*Qian* then becomes *Void* as *Li*,
and *Kun* becomes *full* as *Kan*.

Thus, though *Qian* is *yang* and contains *yin*,
and *Kun* is *yin* yet holds *yang*,
they are no longer the pristine *yin-yang* of the *Taiji*’s undifferentiated unity.
Yet they remain fundamentally true.

In time, the *spirit* generates *jing*,
and the *qi* transforms into *blood*—
from here, the nature of *qi* and *blood*,
and the destiny of *life-force* (*qi-shù*), emerge.

For those with thinking, perceiving minds,
and bodies of *qi*, *blood*, and form,
they are unlike the original *Qian* and *Kun*.

The adept uses method to draw forth
the *Li*’s single point of *self-mercury* (for *mercury* is the fluid of the heart,
though fluid belongs to *yin*,
it arises from *Li*’s fire and carries its nature),
and sends it down into the *Kan* palace,
to warm the *Kan* palace’s single point of *yin blood* (for *blood* is the water of *Kan*,
though water belongs to *yang*,
it is born from *Kan*’s water and is truly a cold substance)—
as the ancients said:
*“Fire enters the water domain,”*
*“Spirit enters the realm of qi.”*

Just as ice hardens when it meets fire,
or as embers heat a pot,
the *yang qi* naturally warms,
giving rise to a pulsating *yin qi* current.

Although, when fire enters water,
it is like adding embers to a pot’s base,
steaming heat ascends vigorously—
this is the birth of true *lead*.

Through the adept’s *spirit*,
the *yang qi* rises upward to the *nirvana marrow* (for governance alone),
as if baking wine in a heated pot—
the rising vapor is drawn by fire into the celestial vessel,
then condenses as dew dripping into the jar (this is what our teaching calls *“true mercury,”*
and also *“the busy messenger from the Northern Sea’s first tide,
nourishing the ancient tree’s roots in the Eastern Mountain”*—
for it is merely *qi* transformed into fluid).

Then, returning to the furnace for warmth and cultivation,
the fluid again becomes *qi*,
cycling endlessly—
ascending and descending,
until the body’s *qi* and *blood* are exhausted,
the *yin qi* stripped away,
and the mortal form is transmuted into a *golden body*,
the turbid essence into a *Qian* essence,
reverting to the original *Taiji*’s *Void*—
the *Dharma-body* of neither birth nor death.

Jia Yuanxu once said:
*“When speaking of *Kan* and *Li*,
the *lead* and *mercury* within the body,
are both ordinary *lead*—
only when *Kan* and *Li* unite,
do true *yin* and true *yang* converge,
and a single point of true *yang* emerge,
does one attain the primordial true *lead* seed.

Yet without a master’s oral instructions,
even if one forcibly restrains it,
one can only solidify the *color-body* (*sèshēn*),
and when the lower *dantian* is filled and strengthened,
it shall inevitably leak and collapse.

Scholars who attain this *yang* generation
have only completed half the work—
how could they hope to form the embryo and achieve sainthood?

Only by drawing this *yang qi* upward,
merging it with the body’s *yin jing*,
and further combining it with the *spirit marrow* (*shénsuí*)
and *essence fluid* (*língyè*) of the *nirvana marrow* and *vermilion palace*—
this is truly *“the Eastern Neighbor’s daughter (wood-mercury),
and the Western Neighbor’s son (gold-lead),
uniting as husband and wife in the chamber.”*」

The Yellow Crone urges one to drink *gāotú* wine,
and daily to intoxicate oneself with incense and vapor—
this is the union of *Heaven* and *Earth* to forge the elixir,
while previously, only the *Kan-Li* union produced the medicine.

With this true *lead* and true *mercury* united,
one may then refine the *returned elixir*.
*Lead* is the *gold* born from water,
*mercury* is the *wood* born from fire.
Previously, these were but common *lead* and common *mercury*,
but now they are the true *lead* and true *mercury*.

If practitioners follow this method,
cultivating the *spirit* (*shén*) without forcing the *qi*,
they shall not go astray.

**Chapter 64: Non-Doing, Non-Clinging**
The unformed is easy to grasp,
the unmanifest is easy to plan,
the fragile is easy to shatter,
the subtle is easy to disperse.
Act before it arises,
regulate before disorder begins.

A tree thick enough to embrace,
grows from a tiny sprout;
a nine-tiered tower,
begins with a single clod;
a thousand-*li* journey,
starts beneath one’s feet.

The doer brings defeat,
the clinger loses his way.
Thus, the Sage does not act,
so he never fails;
does not cling,
so he never loses.

The people’s undertakings
often falter just as completion nears.
Heed the end as the beginning,
and there shall be no failure.

Therefore, the Sage
wishes yet does not wish,
values not the treasures that are hard to obtain;
learns yet does not learn,
but corrects the errors of others.
He aids the natural unfolding of all things,
yet dares not interfere.

The *Dao* of refining one’s self
begins with restraining desire.
The key to restraining desire:
to regulate it before it arises is easy,
to regulate it as it arises is harder;
to regulate it as it arises is still easier,
but to regulate it once formed is hardest.

Therefore, the *Supreme Dao* says:
*“The unformed is easy to grasp,
the unmanifest is easy to plan.”*
When one dwells in quiet solitude,
the mind is not enslaved by affairs,
affairs do not disturb the mind—
still and unmoving, settled in its place,
one’s grasp of self and preservation of nature
is most effortless.

Moreover, in silence and obscurity,
without knowledge or perception,
no trace or sign to seek,
to then devise plans and ponder—
to dispel idle thoughts and restore sincerity—
its course is supremely smooth,
its opportunity most favorable.

Since the common *qi* is soft and fragile,
and the common mind subtle and fleeting,
before desires become entangled and relentless,
before they twist and turn without end,
to now break these impure thoughts,
to scatter these lustful hearts,
and restore the natural *Way* of Heaven,
the sincere and unerring—
how difficult would it be to sever these karmic ties,
and instantly reveal one’s original nature of *Nirvana*?

This is not another act of doing—
it is merely *“acting before it arises.”*

The ancient sage sought to prevent calamities before their sprouts,
and discerned the opportunities at their nascent stirrings—
thus all smoke and clouds were swept away,
and thorns and brambles never took root.

Again, when the world is at great peace,
and a rogue or petty tyrant seizes the moment to cause strife,
it is no hardship for a lone horseman to emerge,
and instantly witness their surrender—
to govern before chaos arises,
how effortless the method must be!

This work of refining oneself is still easily achieved.
But to perfect the nine transformations,
time cannot be measured in mere years and months.

How many are the common, aimless folk
who fail to grasp the Dao as the grand Way of Heaven and Earth,
and humanity as the true Sage of the cosmos!
Some encounter a dharma assembly by chance
and attain fulfillment in a single lifetime;
others lack the right conditions,
and require countless lifetimes before success.
Some repeatedly cultivate, meet fortunate circumstances,
yet their virtue remains incomplete—
their nature flawed, their disposition perverse—
they nearly attain but then fail,
and fail so utterly that they never succeed.

How profound the mysteries of the Great Dao!
Few truly comprehend its ways.

Let us observe how things come to fruition:
A tree of embrace,
when first born, is but a slender sprout—
through the gentle nurture of yin and yang,
changing daily and monthly,
it grows into a mighty tree.
A nine-tiered tower,
when first raised,
is merely a pile of earth—
through human labor, gathering and refining,
ever new and ever flourishing,
it suddenly becomes a lofty tower.
Or consider the unification of mountains and rivers,
the thousand-li journey to traverse a realm—
can one expect to reach their destination
by merely lifting a foot or counting steps?
No—it begins with one step at a time,
from near to far,
until at last they arrive.

Though called the "Great Dao",
it truly encompasses the vast capacity of Heaven and Earth,
the nurturing power to birth and sustain all things—
how could it not be achieved through laborious layers,
through winding, gradual progress?

Only those who deeply enter the Dao
do not seek swift results,
do not measure gains by proximity.
Though gold and jade may be polished,
their resolve remains unshaken;
though seasons may change,
their diligence knows no variation.
Thus, from small to great,
from low to high,
from near to distant—
like the embrace of a mighty tree,
the rise of a nine-tiered tower,
a thousand-li journey—
they suddenly reveal wonders beyond compare.

Yet, the Dao is the natural Way,
and its practice demands natural effort.
Mencius spoke of *"gathering virtue and generating vital breath"*—
his power lay in *"non-action"* and *"non-forgetting."*
At first, he harmonized with the movement of Heaven and Earth,
and the renewing of creation;
later, he aligned with the ceaseless passage of sun and moon,
yet his radiance remained ever the same.
If one acts *with* intent to act,
then the actor is undone;
if one grasps *with* intent to grasp,
then the grasper is lost.

Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon,
endlessly turning through ages—
do they not achieve transformation without contrivance?

If Heaven and Earth were to act *with* intent to move,
if the sun and moon were to grasp *with* intent to shift,
how could they endure eternally without wear?

The saying goes:
*"If Heaven had emotions, Heaven too would age,
But since the sun has no will, it ever shines bright."*
Is this not the truth?

Thus, the ancient sages
refined the supreme Dao,
marvelously following nature’s course.
They acted without acting—
no failure in their deeds;
they grasped without grasping—
no loss in their virtue.

Yet today’s seekers of the Dao
mistake *non-action* for action,
sometimes practicing, sometimes abandoning—
they do not know when to move or when to rest,
when to align with the natural flow.
Their dynamic and stillness often falter,
far from the ancient path.
Some nearly succeed but then collapse,
and once fallen, never rise again.

The *Book of Documents* says:
*"Be cautious in its end,
for its beginning is all."*
Thus it endures through countless ages without replacement.

As for rare treasures,
all men hold them dear—
the sage blends with the world,
his light undimmed,
yet he seeks the Dao, not wealth.
At first, he does not know
such preciousness exists in human affairs,
so he does not value it—
his detachment is thus clear.

In matters of sight, hearing, speech, and movement,
in daily actions and common affairs—
those who abandon restraint and stray beyond bounds
need not be spoken of.
Even among those who seek the Dao,
some cling to emptiness, some to substance,
some grasp when they should not, some hold back when they should—
all are errors.

Now I alone follow the ancient path,
embrace the old Way,
and express my own views—
not to claim my words are lofty,
but to weigh the Dao’s measure.

I think the Dao is *my* Dao,
learning is *my* learning—
I attain what I attain by myself,
so why speak of learning at all?

Moreover, men often err in excess,
while I alone act without contrivance.
With my Dao of *non-action*,
I mend the errors of others—
this is to rectify myself and thereby rectify others.
And with my Dao of *non-action*,
I aid all things that fall short—
this is to order my own conduct and lead all things—
how dare I act otherwise?

The sage’s body is the Dao’s dwelling,
the people’s and all things’ reliance—
how could I for a moment cease to be?

At the outset, when I spoke of *"its effortless grasp and preservation"*,
those words referred to the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass—
silent and unmoving,
yet responsive and thus harmonious.

Even in the moments of not seeing, not hearing,
this realm holds the true essence—
neither good nor evil.
The Buddha called it *"that"*;
the Confucian sage called it *"the luminous harmony"*—
all speak of the same thing.

---

Like the morning sun upon lotus,
the dawn wind through willows—
tender red and fresh green,
radiant with loveliness.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Heaven and Earth in their primal union,
All things refined in their transformation.
Male and female merge in essence,
All things born from this union."*

It speaks only of the initial *qi* in its gentleness,
still close to Heaven’s origin.

Zhu Xi’s verse declares:
*"A half-acre pond mirrors the sky—
Heaven’s light and clouds drift by."*

This reveals the Dao-heart and human-heart,
distinct yet clear in an instant.

Here, one steadies the will and nurtures the *qi*,
establishes teachings to sever entanglements,
and thus ascends to the other shore.

*The Rites* proclaim:
*"Man is born in stillness—
This is Heaven’s nature."*

When stirred by things, he moves—
This is the nature of desire.

Like Heaven and Earth at the first return of the cycle,
all things revive in spring.

Though things interact and stir desires,
these are still matters of Heaven’s nature,
rooted in emptiness and stillness,
natural and unforced.

Only slight restraint is needed—
no great schemes required—
to curb desire and preserve sincerity,
to quiet evil and return to right.

Like tender shoots and fragile roots,
human desire is easily severed,
while Heaven’s principle may be restored.

The ancients called this the Mysterious Pass’s aperture,
or the Gate of Life and Door of Death.

When the human heart withdraws and hides,
and the Heavenly heart shines forth,
it is because, in the time before disturbance,
one acts and governs.

Yet once the first *yang* stirs,
its mechanism is subtle,
its momentum swift.

By the second and third *yang*,
the spirit condenses, *qi* gathers,
true essence moves on its own—
vast as tides, fluid as melting ice.

All arise from the subtle to the manifest,
from small to great,
from near to far.

To the alchemical stages—
advancing fire, advancing talismans,
the River Vehicle’s transport,
rebirth of the male elixir,
reunion of the female mercury—
boiling, refining, gradually congealing,
spirit complete, *qi* robust,
the pill perfected—
even the six senses tremble,
the six powers fully manifest—
all begin with the Mysterious Pass’s first movement.

At this initial stir,
the water’s source is purest.
As the ancients said:
*"The White Tiger’s first passage—priceless treasure,
The Pool of Flowers—true gold in sacred water."*

If one awakens at this moment and acts,
holding firm, one may then daily circulate one’s own mercury,
enclosing the yin essence—
like the first crescent moon at the third day,
growing to half at the upper arc,
full at the fifteenth.

Thus the sage knows all things under Heaven,
from low to high, near to far,
follow their natural Dao.

To act without acting,
to grasp without grasping—
as Heaven speaks not yet all things move,
how unlike the people’s ruinous deeds,
their failures called success!

This is all from a single piece of pristine clarity,
undivided and whole.

Unknowing what to desire,
one forgets even the thought of desire.
Thus it is said: *"Desire not to desire."*

As for the value of millet and pearls,
there is no striving—
from non-being to being,
yet being remains non-being.
The Daoist’s inherent possession,
needing no external seeking.

Even if one studies,
it is still as if studying nothing.
Thus it is said: *"Study not to study."*

As one’s own purity transforms the world’s杂,
the world’s杂 returns to one’s own purity—
guiding and aiding all things,
rooted in nature alone.
How unlike those who flaunt their private cleverness!

---

**Chapter 65: The Skillful Daoist**

The ancients skilled in the Dao
did not enlighten the people—
they sought to make them simple.

The people’s difficulty in governance
lies in their excess of cleverness.

Thus, ruling with cleverness
is a state’s ruin;
ruling without cleverness
brings the state’s blessing.

Knowing these two principles
is called the Mysterious Virtue.

The Mysterious Virtue is profound,
far-reaching, contrary to things—
only then does one attain Great Harmony.

Under Heaven, all affairs rely on cleverness,
yet the Dao does not rely on cleverness—
it relies on simplicity.
Simplicity is near to the Dao.

The Master’s lineage, passed down,
was grasped by the simpleminded Zengzi.

Thus the ancient sages
governed under Heaven with the Dao.
They did not merely show the people the Dao—
they transformed them into the Dao,
mysterious and indistinct,
all returning to the pure stillness of Heaven—
while the plowman and well-digger
rise with the sun and rest with the moon,
forgetting imperial might in their labor,
following Heaven without knowing it.

Ah! How pure their simplicity!

「From the later generations onward,
scholars and officials no longer valued *qu* (愚) but prized cleverness,
thus giving rise to ever-more intricate schemes,
corrupting the hearts of men,
deepening their avarice and vulgarity daily,
and rendering customs ever more deceitful.

The ruin of these people’s moral standards and rites,
their lawbreaking and transgression of regulations,
their disregard for death—
such cases are countless and difficult to enumerate.

All stem from those who extol talent and favor acute intelligence,
striving to gain falsehood,
while even the simple among the people indulge in guile.
The people’s innate purity has been pierced through,
deceit and cunning abound,
yet in their ceaseless bustle,
one deceives while another fears,
and those in authority find governance beyond their capacity.

Thus it is said:
*"To rule a nation with cleverness is to make it a thief;
to rule without cleverness is to bring it fortune."*

Why is this so?
Because when the people acquire knowledge,
their primordial simplicity is already shattered.
If they remain in ignorance, unaware,
then their original purity endures intact.

These two paths—cleverness and simplicity—diverge,
and their benefits and harms are starkly contrasted.
Rather than value cleverness and invite harm,
why not embrace simplicity and reap its gains?

Understanding these two principles
is not only true for governing the world—
it applies equally to cultivating oneself,
serving as a model to follow.

To grasp this model
is to approach the Dao.

Great cultivators,
even when they see and hear nothing,
return to the state of no thought, no care—
the divine essence of pure stillness.
This cannot be achieved
by merely closing ears and eyes,
or by suppressing acute intelligence,
but only through attaining true equanimity.

If even a single thread of calculation or scheming arises,
the original purity is lost,
and the harmony of simplicity is ruined.

Knowing that cleverness harms oneself,
while simplicity benefits the body,
one should not flaunt their cleverness,
but delight in preserving their simplicity—
this is what is called the *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).

All that can be named is not the *Mysterious Virtue*;
only that which cannot be named,
profound and boundless,
far-reaching and unfathomable,
can be called the *Mysterious Virtue*.

Though it shares with flying and creeping things,
and with the sluggish and dull,
the quality of having no desires, no knowledge,
yet these creatures cannot grasp the threads of their origins,
living in perpetual darkness and confusion.

Man alone,
from coarse to refined,
from origin to conclusion,
may reach the unity of the Three Primordials (三元),
returning the Great Ultimate (太极) to its original state (归真),
and still attain divine transformation—
how could this not be contrary to things?

In governing a nation, cleverness is not valued,
but in cultivating the Dao, simplicity is all the more precious.
For cleverness is indeed the thief of a nation,
while simplicity is the seed of the Dao.

Can simplicity truly be the seed of the Dao?
Consider the state of *Hun Dun* (混沌),
where there is no thought, no care,
no knowledge—
is this not what is called simplicity?

Suddenly, one awakens—
this is the unborn, unending essence of *I* (我).
None should claim to retain this awakening,
to cultivate the supreme and perfect enlightenment (無上正等正覺),
for only then can one escape the cycle of rebirth,
avoid the forging of yin and yang (陰陽鼓鑄),
and not be ensnared by ghosts and spirits (鬼神拘執).

Even within the *Hun Dun* state,
when one suddenly awakens—
if I guard this true essence without letting it disperse,
this single awakening has already reached *Prajñāpāramitā* (般若波羅蜜).

If one steadfastly upholds and constantly guards it,
the seeds of rebirth will be severed here.

If another thought or perception arises,
it is the post-natal *desire-knowledge* (後天識欲之神) mingling within,
as the saying goes:
*"Countless movements bring forth the root of birth and death,
The foolish call it the original man."* (無量動來生死本，痴人唤作本来人)

In essence,
the divine essence is singular,
but desire makes it dual.

Dual thoughts and triple minds
are the defiled roots and dust—
the cause of birth and death.

Only with one heart,
no dual thoughts,
having right awareness (正念),
and no deluded mind (妄心),
is the Dao found.

If one can dissolve even this single heart and right awareness,
it is the Great Ultimate returning to the Non-Ultimate (太極還於無極),
and the formation of the *Jin Xian* (金仙) lies within this refining of the void (炼虚).

What is *refining of the void* (炼虚)?
It is like the state of *Hun Dun*,
confused and befuddled,
as if in simplicity or drunkenness,
having no knowledge, no awareness—
this is the void.

When seated meditation reaches the stage of no person, no self,
no place, no sky,
this too is refining of the void.

It is also said:
The essentials of learning the Dao
begin with forgetting the self,
proceed to forgetting others,
and end with forgetting the Dao itself—
until one reaches the extreme of forgetting-forgetting,
this is the ultimate attainment.

If one can take this single moment as their master,
and use true awakening as their means,
the Dao is not far.

Yet though the method of refining the void is thus,
its practice must begin with refining the nature (炼性).
The ancients named refining the nature *casting the mirror* (鑄鏡).

If the mind is not refined,
one remains dim and unaware,
even if the truth is right before their eyes—
how much more so for those who possess the Six Perfections (六通)?

If the heart is still clouded by private desires,
it has not yet reached the void.

As in the state after true awakening,
one must not allow even a thread or speck of desire to remain in the chest—
then the *Ling Tai* (靈台) mirror’s treasure
will always shine brightly,
though not necessarily in full attainment,
but in a radiant gleam.

Even within the *Hun Dun* state,
when one suddenly knows—
knowing nothing else—
suddenly awakens—
awakening to nothing more—
this single moment reveals boundless clarity,
illuminating all four directions without obstruction.

However,
a student filled with private desires
cannot suddenly become pure and transparent,
like jade or gold.
How could this be achieved
by a mere moment of emptiness?

One must first forge the *female* and *male blades* (雌雄二劍),
to eliminate both the visible and invisible demons (魔).

If these blades are not sharp,
the demons of desire (欲魔),
form (色魔),
heaven (天魔),
and man (人魔)
cannot be swept away and thoroughly purified,
revealing the true face of the Primordial (乾元).

For human desires and heavenly principles (天理)
have long been entangled;
though one seeks to stand alone in the stream,
the forces opposing them are too great.

Thus, though they know the truth,
they still tread upon it—
for those who lead them into human desires are many,
while those who guide them toward heavenly principles are few.

Now I tell the students:
To perfect the pure *Dharma-body* (法身),
one must first have a pure *divine essence* (神);
To obtain a pure *divine essence*,
one must cultivate boundless *qi* (氣).

What is called *casting the blades* (鑄劍) has no other means—
it is by nurturing the *qi* of the early morning (平旦之氣),
direct and unharmful,
until it becomes vast and robust,
great and firm.»

Once the divine sword is forged and its edge sharp,
it can cleave demons and sever evil.
At that time—
no longer will lewd sounds or ravishing beauty
disturb the mind upon sight,
nor will even shared slumber with a fair woman
rouse awareness;
no longer will malevolent spirits or ominous omens
shake the spirit,
nor will the collapse of Tai Mountain before one’s eyes
inspire fear.

This forging of the divine sword
depends on a will as resolute as the gods—
yet alas, the practice is not deep-rooted,
sometimes pursued, sometimes abandoned,
unwilling to stand firm in the present moment.

If one can sever with a single stroke,
and extinguish private desires the instant they arise,
never allowing them to regenerate—
this is the path to breaking the wheel of birth and death.

The Daoist student has no other secret—
only fear of failing to recognize
the mirror-like divine sword.

If recognized,
the mirror’s light shines universally in this instant,
admitting no evil or delusion,
the wisdom-sword hangs suspended—
desire-demons are instantly severed.
From this moment, with a single thought held firm,
the divine chamber may be perfected,
and the immortal elixir refined.

This mirror-like wisdom-sword
is the essential task of the cultivator.

If the sword’s edge is dull,
how can it sever demonic forces?
Thus, the more one restrains the heart,
the more it grows disordered.

If the precious mirror lacks luminosity,
how can one distinguish principle from desire?
Thus, the more one strives to suppress,
the more they multiply.

Mencius spoke of nurturing *qi* but not of nurturing the heart—
truly, when *qi* is abundant, the heart naturally settles.
Those who merely force the heart,
without knowing that righteousness generates *qi*,
are far from the Dao.

Li Erqu said:
*"The human heart is naturally joyous,
yet private desires bind it.
When desire first stirs,
the true mind becomes aware.
Once aware, it vanishes—
the heart returns to its original joy."*

The humble old man said:
*"Luminous and silent, pervading the sands of the river,
the vulgar and the sage share the same home.
When not a thought arises, the whole body manifests;
the six senses stir—clouds obscure the view.
Severing vexation only deepens affliction,
seeking true suchness is itself delusion.
Worldly affairs follow their course without obstruction,
nirvana and birth-death are but empty flowers."*

Let those who study mind and nature
meditate deeply on these words.

**Chapter 66: On the King of All Valleys**

The reason the rivers and seas can be the sovereign of all valleys
is that they excel in humility,
and thus become the sovereign of all valleys.

Therefore, the Sage who wishes to surpass others
must first speak in a way that places himself below them;
who wishes to lead others
must first position himself behind them.

Thus, the Sage, though in the highest place,
does not inspire awe,
and though he moves forward,
he does not harm others.
Hence, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.

Because he does not contend,
none can contend with him.

All desire others to submit to them,
yet some, though not submitting, are submitted to,
while others, though eager to submit, are ever more resisted—
this is because they exalt themselves,
unwilling to lower their hearts or humble their *qi*.

Observe how rivers and seas become the gathering place of all valleys—
it is because they receive them from below,
and thus become their sovereign.
If rivers and seas were to place themselves above the valleys,
though the valleys might still flow toward them,
where would be their capacity to contain them?

Thus, the Sage perceives this early:
to surpass others, he must speak from a lower place,
as Yao consulted the Four Mountains,
and Shun inquired of the Four Gates—
all teachings, commands, and matters
were sought from ministers and neighbors,
never exalting his own wisdom.
This is why the more he humbles himself,
the more others elevate him.

To lead others, he must place himself behind them,
as Yu, Gao, and Yi did—
though they were enlightened first,
they always yielded precedence to others,
placing themselves last.
This is why the more he retreats,
the more others advance.

Because he positions himself below and behind,
even as emperor, he lacks the terror of authority,
and thus is not feared.
Though he governs the divine and human,
he lacks the harshness of domination,
and thus does not harm others.
Therefore, all under heaven willingly follow him as their leader,
with no resentment.

The *Odes* say:
*"There is no blame in him,
nor in me any fault.
May we thus, night and day,
perpetuate our good name."*

What else is this but this?
Because he does not contend for superiority or precedence,
others naturally place him above and before him.
They submit to his teachings, revere his spirit,
and endlessly receive his grace and virtue—
how could they then dare to contend for superiority or precedence,
and rival the Sage in competition?

This is the analogy for elixir cultivation:
first, the divine fire descends into the elixir field,
then the fire steams and the water boils,
and from the depths of the water, gold is born—
only then does the elixir of longevity begin to manifest.

Humans receive the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth to live,
originally complete and whole.
Yet after birth, *qi* and constitution constrain them,
and desires obscure them,
so that the original *qi* of Heaven
is scattered and dissipated throughout the body’s stale *qi*,
unable to gather in one place for long.

Now, to converge the Five Phases,
harmonize the Four Symbols,
unite them in the central palace,
and return them to the mysterious orifice—
one must first release all entanglements,
allow no private thoughts to arise,
close the eyes and seal the mouth,
so that the eyes see through the nose,
the nose faces the navel,
and the heart-fire descends into the elixir field—
in but a moment, the mysterious pass opens,
one *yang* revives,
and the *qi* of the whole body
naturally gathers in the elixir field,
fusing and flowing freely,
a joy beyond words.

Yet at the outset of observation,
if the fire is not intense, the gold will not emerge from the ore;
if the fire is too fierce, it will scorch the essence and blood,
stifling the vital spark.
Only when it is neither clinging nor detached,
neither present nor absent,
does the *qi* of the elixir field leap with restless energy.

This is like the rivers and seas receiving all valleys—
thus the valleys gather toward them.
The Sage receives all under heaven—
thus all hearts turn to him.

In a single body,
the heart is the most noble and exalted,
while all other limbs are small and lowly.

---

The **Taoist Sage** thus likens the heart to the vastness of the rivers and seas,
and all other limbs to the smallness of the valleys and the lowliness of the common folk—
this is the **elixir field** of the body.

Those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** must likewise take the lowly as their foundation,
the humble as their root,
yet not place themselves above the noble and exalted,
so that they may descend to the common and ordinary—
then their attainment will be effortless.

For the ordinary man,
the spirit (*shen*) is the master,
while *qi* follows its movements, rising and falling,
thus giving birth to sons and daughters,
and life and death.

The **Perfect Sage** (*Zhiren*) takes *qi* as the master,
while the spirit listens and moves at its command.
As the *Wuzhen* says: *"Though others act as master, I am the guest."*

The great adept,
when *qi* moves,
inverts the workings of **Nature** (*Zao*) and **Transformation** (*Hua*),
upsets the **Heaven-Earth** (*Qiankun*) polarity,
and simply follows its ascending and descending flow—
returning to the furnace to seal and refine,
then awaiting the **True Essence** (*Zhenxin*) to manifest,
cycling and revolving in harmony,
never relying on the spirit for guidance.

Yet when one observes the **True Qi** (*Zhenqi*) surging and blending,
inverting and reversing its course,
and completes the ninefold transformation,
the **elixir** (*dantian*) matures and the **Pearl** (*zhuzhu*) awakens—
is this not a lofty state,
exalted above all,
the object of reverence for ten thousand men,
the spectacle of all under heaven?

Only when one abides in the lowly and follows behind in this manner,
does the spirit of **lively detachment** (*huodantian*) arise—
a heart of humility and modesty,
thus avoiding the calamities of **tilting the elixir field** (*qīdān dǎodìng*),
**mercury fleeing** (*gǒngzǒu*),
and **lead scattering** (*qiānfēi*).

Hence, when one remains in the lowly without striving,
all under heaven cannot contend with him.

**Chapter Sixty-Seventh**
I possess the **Three Treasures** (*Sān Bǎo*),
and all under heaven call me great—
yet this seems unworthy.

For only the truly great can appear unworthy;
if one seems worthy,
it is long since one has been small.

I possess the **Three Treasures**,
and cling to them in safeguarding:
the first is **compassion** (*cí*),
the second is **frugality** (*jiǎn*),
the third is **not daring to lead all under heaven** (*bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān*).

For **compassion** brings forth **courage** (*yǒng*);
**frugality** brings forth **breadth** (*guǎng*);
and **not daring to lead all under heaven**,
thus one can fulfill one’s role and endure.

Now, if one abandons **compassion** for **courage**,
**frugality** for **breadth**,
and **not daring to lead** for **leading ahead**,
then one is already dead.

For **compassion**—
when wielded in battle, it wins;
when used in defense, it holds firm.
When **Heaven** intends to save a man,
it shields him with **compassion**.

The **Dao/Way** is fundamentally **Limitless** (*Wújí*), yet it is also the **Great Ultimate** (*Tàijí*).
Neither great nor small,
neither great nor small—
it is both great and small at once.

There are indeed words that no thought or speculation can exhaust.
If one insists on calling it "great,"
then it is *"the boundless and mighty **Harmonious Qi** (*Hàorán qì*),*
*filling the space between Heaven and Earth."*

If one seeks to describe it as "small,"
then it is *"the nameless **embryo** (*pǔ*),*
*most subtle and minute,*
*hidden in the boundless expanse."*

In man,
its possession means life,
its loss means death.

All arise from the **Limitless** yet take form,
from the **invisible** yet manifest.
Truly, the small is its origin,
while the great is its unfolding.

It is better to speak of the small to reveal the **Dao/Way**,
than to speak of the great to explain it.

Thus the **Taoist Sage** says:
*"All under heaven call me great."*

For **"I"** is the **Dao/Way** itself.
The **Dao/Way** has no fixed form or body;
yet when called "great,"
it seems to have a form and body that can be likened—
this does not truly resemble the **Dao/Way**.

If one wishes to embody **Heaven’s Dao/Way**,
and resemble the Sage’s form,
from the opening of **Heaven** to the present day,
those who have established **Heaven’s polarity** (*Lìjí*) and expounded the **Dao/Way** and its teachings—
for ages now,
they have all relied on the **Limitless** as the **Ultimate**,
the **unmanifest** as the **manifest**,
the most subtle and minute as the **Dao/Way**.

Yet how can one practice the **Dao/Way** when it is **soundless and odorless** (*wúshēng wúchòu*),
flickering and indistinct?
How can the student begin?

The **Taoist Sage** says:
*"I possess the **Three Treasures**,
and cling to them in safeguarding."*

If one holds them steadfastly without loss,
treasures them as precious,
never forgetting them in each thought,
then one may return to the origin
and restore the **Primordial Sovereign** (*Wéihuáng*)’s descent.

What are the **Three Treasures**?
The first is **compassion** (*cí*), which is **benevolence** (*rén*) itself.
**Benevolence** and **compassion**, gentle and pervasive,
are the **elemental principle** (*yuán*) of **Heaven**.
The gentleman embodies **benevolence**,
and this suffices to nurture all men.

Moreover, it encompasses the **Four Beginnings** (*Sì Duān*),
and includes all **virtues** (*shàn*).
**Benevolence** is within it—
then the **Dao/Way** is within it.
Filling and exhausting it,
it can embrace **Heaven and Earth**,
and permeate **ancient and modern**.

This is the **foundation of the Golden Elixir** (*Jīndān zhī běn*),
and the adept must cherish and remember it.

Yet its **Dao/Way** extends to the utmost greatness,
while its **root** (*míng*) ascends from the utmost subtlety.
If one does not know to **forget all thoughts** (*wànniàn jū wàng*),
and **illuminate the inner essence** (*yīlíng nèizhào*),
but instead merely pursues breadth and becomes dissipated,
seeks vastness and wanders aimlessly,
then one will gain nothing of **benevolence**,
and nothing of the **Dao/Way**.

Only when one **inverts and seeks within oneself** (*fǎnqiú*),
and **steadfastly guards the heart** (*dǔshǒu zhū xīn*),
does one establish oneself while also establishing others,
and reach fulfillment while also fulfilling others.
Guarding the narrow yet applying the broad—
this is what the ancients called **"obtaining one, all things are accomplished"** (*dé yī wànshì bì*),
is it not the essence of **frugality** (*jiǎn*)?

For **frugality** is the means to seek **benevolence**,
and the key to cultivating the **Dao/Way**.
The student, having known **compassion**,
must further nourish it with **frugality**,
then alone may he align with the **Dao/Way**.

Yet if one exalts himself in pride,
and magnifies his own greatness,
without the measure of humility and modesty,
then within he knows only himself,
and without he scorns all others.
He boasts of his cleverness,
and arrogantly proclaims his wisdom,
truly believing he is the first to awaken and harmonize—
often he regards all under heaven as incapable of surpassing him.

In the end,
his nature is not **serene and tranquil** (*tiánjìng*),
his *qi* is not **harmonious and peaceful** (*héping*),
and yet he hopes to complete the **Nine Turns of the Elixir** (*jiǔ zhuǎn dānchéng*),
and reach the **Nine Heavens of the Dao/Way** (*jiǔ tiān dǎojí*)—
this is indeed difficult.

The ancients said:
*"The essential key to refining the elixir*
*is to take **awakened awareness** (*língjué*) as the **Dao/Way’s body**,*
*and **harmonious blending** (*chōnghé*) as the **Dao/Way’s function**—*
*then, in all things and places,*
*one must not dare to lead all under heaven."*

Moreover, **compassion** (*cí*) is the **innate capacity** (*liángnéng*) of man’s heart.
Exhausting one’s own heart to establish the **fate** (*mìng*) of all things,
what a vast **vow** (*shìyuàn*) this is!
Nurturing the **sincere and upright** (*cùnzhōng*) nature within,
to seek the **peace** (*ān*) of all things,
what a mighty **precision** (*jīnglì*) and **strength** (*liàng*) this is!

Thus the man who guards **compassion** is the same as the man who nourishes **courage**.
**Zengzi** told **Zixiang**:
*"When reflecting upon oneself without shrinking,*
*even if one is clad in coarse garments and broadcloth,*
*I would not fear."*

「If one reflects upon oneself and shrinks back,
even if there are a thousand people,
I would still go forward.

*Is it not the man who casts aside all private thoughts of self-interest,*
*who can possess such great courage?*

**Courage** (*yǒng*) must be rooted in restraint (*yuē*) before it can be expressed broadly (*bó*).
If one does not restrain, how can one be broad?

Only when one can **prudently** (*shèn*) govern one’s actions,
**sparingly** (*shěng*) consider one’s thoughts,
**dedicate** (*zhì*) a single mind to the **rectifying field** (*fāngcùn*),
**gather** (*shōu*) all the **hundreds of limbs** (*bǎitiǎn*) to the **elixir field** (*dāntián*),
**unceasingly** (*miánmiánmìmì*) and **unflaggingly** (*bù'èrbùxī*), **continuously** (*jìjì*) and **purely** (*chúnchún*),
**without slackness** (*wúdài*) or **neglect** (*wúhuāng*),
then **naturally** (*zìrán*) one’s **self-cultivation** (*xiūshēn*) will be complete,
and **all under heaven** (*tiānxià*) will find **peace** (*píng*).

*How else could one achieve such breadth if not through frugality?*

As for **not daring to lead all under heaven** (*bùgǎnwéitiānxiàxiān*),
it is the **proper humility** (*qiānzūn*) and **radiant virtue** (*guāng*) of **steadfastness** (*ānzhēn*).
**Gentleness** (*róushùn*) and **yielding** (*róushùn*) to all under heaven,
while none under heaven dare to contend with him—
this is to **align with** (*shùnchéng*) the **Dao/Way’s unfolding** (*tiāndào*),
and the **Dao/Way** will **silently** (*mò*) grant its completion (*chéng*).

*Without the **virtue/power** (*dé*) of **harmonious blending** (*chōnghé*),*
*how could one dare not to lead all under heaven,*
*and still achieve a **great instrument’s** (*dàqì*) late fulfillment (*wǎnchéng*) like this?*

Thus, **compassion** (*cí*), **frugality** (*jiǎn*), and **yielding** (*hòu*)
are all the **foundations** (*běnshǐ*) of seeking the **Dao/Way**.
**Courage** (*yǒng*), **breadth** (*guǎng*), and **leading** (*xiān*)
are all the **ultimate expressions** (*mòxiào*) of following the **Dao/Way**.

Yet today’s scholars are otherwise:
**Discarding compassion** (*shěcí*) yet **pursuing courage** (*qǐyǒng*), they will **nurture a cruel heart** (*shēngrényīnxīn*);
**Discarding frugality** (*shějiǎn*) yet **seeking breadth** (*qǐguǎng*), they will **harbor greedy desires** (*xīn huái tānniàn*);
**Discarding yielding** (*shěhòu*) yet **striving to lead** (*qǐxiān*), they will **engage in rivalry** (*bǔyǒuchéng*—*contesting competition*).

*All are paths that lead to death.*
Even if they **chance to survive** (*xìngcún*),
they are but **living corpses** (*xíngshī*), **wandering flesh** (*zǒuròu*),
**mingling indiscriminately** (*làncè*) among the masses (*rénqún*),
*what difference is there between them and the dead?*

In summary, **compassion** is the **natural principle** (*shēnglǐ*) of man,
a **shared essence** (*xìng suǒ tóngrán*) within all.
Only when one **guards it with restraint** (*shǒuzhīyǐyuē*) and **expresses it in harmony** (*chūzhīyǐhé*),
will **compassionate benevolence** (*cíhuì*) and **tender concern** (*cèdá*) flow forth from **true sincerity** (*zìchū zhēnchéng*),
and **none under heaven** (*tiānxià*) will fail to **bow in submission** (*xīnzhé*) and **yield** (*qūshì*).

*When benevolence suffices to benefit others,*
*a **compassionate man** (*rénzhě*) is **unmatched** (*wúdí*),
*how could there ever be defeat in battle,*
*or failure in defense,*
*bringing shame upon all under heaven?*

The *Book of Documents* (*Shū*) says:
*"Only the **Heavenly** (*wéitiān*) **obscures** (*yīn*) and **nourishes** (*bì*) the people below,
**harmonizing** (*xiángxié*) their dwelling in **cooperation** (*xiángxié*)."*
*Granting them life and fulfillment* (*yǐshēngyǐsuì*),
they **endure** (*yǒngxiǎng*) the **eternal peace** (*wúshì*) of **Heaven** (*tiān*),
*this is what is called the **Heaven’s intent to save** (*tiān jiāng jiùzhī*) them.*

The *Book of Odes* (*Shījīng*) says:
*"The **Heaven’s command** (*wéitiānzhīmìng*) is **profoundly harmonious** (*yúmù*) and **unceasing** (*bùyǐ*)."*
*It reveals the **clear and boundless qi** (*qīngkōngyīqì*),*
**flowing and unending** (*liúxíngbùxī*), **nurturing and limitless** (*fāyùwújiāng*),
*and it is said that **compassion alone** (*cíwèizhī*) suffices to **guard** (*wèi*) it.*

The **Dao/Way** is called the **Great Dao/Way** (*Dàdào*),
*its essence is **boundless** (*wújí*) yet the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*).*
Yet if one does not **trace its origin from the boundless** (*cóngwújízhīshǐ*),
**searching** (*zhǐ*) for a **foothold** (*jīnyá*) in the **chaotic indistinctness** (*húnhúndùn*),
how could one **fathom** (*cè*) the **root of the Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijízhīgēn*)?
How could one **measure** (*mì*) its **beginning and end** (*qǐzhǐ*)?

Scholars must first **clarify the Dao’s source** (*Dàoyuán*).
In the **unseen and unheard** (*bùshòubùwén*),
they must **seek out** (*zhǐ*) the **most subtle and profound essence** (*zhìyǐnzhìwēizhītǐ*),
*this is what is called the **void yet responsive** (*xūérlíng*).*

Yet its **subtlety is already extreme** (*guǎnqíxiàyǐshèn*),
*like a single grain of millet* (*shǔzhūyīlì*)—
*and there is something that can be **imagined** (*xiàng*).*

In totality, it is **form without form** (*wúxíngzhīxíng*),
**state without state** (*wúzhuàngzhīzhuàng*).
**Approach it and one does not see its head** (*yíngzhībùjiànqíshǒu*),
**follow it and one does not see its tail** (*suízhībùjiànqíhòu*).
*This is the **warm and luminous compassion** (*ǎirán yīpiàn cíhuì*) within man’s heart.*

Even the **most stubborn and base** (*suǒwéizhuānzuì*) of men,
*does not **extinguish** (*mǐn*) the **compassion** (*cízhīxìng*) within them.*
Confucius said:
*"If I seek **virtue/power** (*rén*), then **virtue/power** (*rén*) will **immediately** (*sī*) come to me."*

The cultivation of the elixir—what else is it?
It is nothing but nurturing this compassion.

What is compassion?
When the King of Qi sees a cow trembling and cannot bear it,
When a villager sees a weak child fall into a well and feels distress—
These are the stirrings of the heart of virtue,
The return of the Heavenly heart.

Reflecting on this, such impulses and thoughts arise without ceasing—
Only fear that people fail to perceive them.

The scholar, from the spontaneous movement of true nature,
Expands and acts, thereby establishing a foundation for elixir cultivation.
Yet one must not seek breadth at the cost of neglect,
But rather adhere to restraint and subtlety.

With single-minded devotion, wholehearted sincerity—
The ancients said:
*"The heart must dwell within the chest,
Lest thoughts stray through the gate of totality."*

Thus, the more restrained, the broader;
The more subtle, the more manifest.
The more precise the restraint,
The wider the unfolding.

How can the scholar not take frugality as the root?
Though frugality is a virtue of the mind,
It is indeed a fine method to avoid excess through restraint.
Yet if not tempered with humility and gentleness,
One risks the violent nature igniting and harming the elixir.
Thus, restraint must be paired with utmost harmony—
In all things, humility and self-effacement,
Never presuming to lead—
This is the way of emptying oneself for others.

When the heart of virtue endures,
The Dao-qi endures as well.

If one values courage over compassion,
Seeks abundance over frugality,
And places oneself before others,
Then the heart is merely ordinary.
How could one expect to hold the Three Treasures without loss?

Moreover, when a person possesses compassion,
It is most effective in winning others’ favor—
In battle, victory is assured;
In defense, the city stands firm.
This is like tending the furnace with fire,
Burning away the Three Vermin;
Or guarding the city with ritual purity,
Thus preserving the embryo-spirit and original essence.

This gentle and harmonious heart
Is the key to elixir cultivation and Dao-nurturing.

Heaven, in creating man,
Endows him with life and, without fail, with compassion.
If one can constantly reflect and return to virtue,
The elixir of eternal life is already within reach.

**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**
A true warrior does not rely on brute force,
A skilled fighter does not rage,
One who triumphs over enemies does not contend,
And one who wields people places himself beneath them.

This is called the virtue of non-contention,
This is called harnessing others’ strength,
This is called aligning with Heaven—
The ultimate of the ancients.

*"Shì"* (士) means teacher of the people.
A teacher of the people wields armies,
Originally valuing martial prowess.
The *Yijing* says:
*"Firm yet yielding, advancing boldly yet following order,
Mighty yet without slaughter."*
This is wielding force without force—
The mark of a true teacher of the people.

When facing a great enemy, armies clash,
Two forces stand arrayed—
One cannot avoid deploying troops,
Brandishing weapons, charging like rivers,
Their roar shaking the heavens.

Yet in truth, with few soldiers,
A sudden onslaught by a mighty foe—
It is no difficulty to play music and drive back the invaders,
Or compose melodies to lift the siege.
This is the way of achieving might without anger.

When the troops return in triumph, proclaiming victory,
While others boast of their deeds,
He alone humbly withdraws—
Such a general can stand without shame.

Even if honors are heaped upon him,
He remains modest, his face flushed—
This is how one who conquers without contention behaves.

The *Shujing* says:
*"You alone do not contend,
And none in the world will contend with your ability."*
Is this not what is meant?

Such men arise from promoting the old while establishing the new,
Gathering wisdom and broadening benefits,
Not relying on their own talents,
But skillfully using others’ talents as their own;
Not boasting of their own wisdom,
But skillfully using others’ wisdom as their own.

This is the way of humbling oneself to elevate others—
If not for heeding wise counsel,
Consulting the good path,
Maintaining an open heart like a valley,
And practicing humble reverence—
How could one achieve such mastery of war and victory,
Turning the world as easily as flipping one’s palm?

This is the virtue of non-contention,
By which one serves the people.
This is harnessing others’ strength,
By which one commands the world.
This is aligning with the people below,
And harmonizing with Heaven above—
By which one serves the people’s hearts.
This is harnessing others’ strength,
By which one commands the world.
This is aligning with the people below,
And harmonizing with Heaven above—
Standing with Heaven and Earth,
And establishing the ultimate of all ages.

Alas! Without the saint’s utmost sincerity and fulfillment of nature,
How could one, amid the chaos of war,
Conceal the winds of peace and courtesy,
Wield force without force,
Act in anger without anger,
Contend without contention—
As described here?

Moreover, ruling with broad tolerance,
Planning with deference to others,
Placing the worthy in office,
And the capable in their posts—
Then all under Heaven’s scholars
Will offer loyalty and sincerity,
Eager to perform deeds and fulfill commands,
As if Heaven’s seasons flow without speech,
And all things present their offerings—
This is how one aligns with Heaven and Earth,
And establishes the ultimate.

The *Shijing* says:
*"Reflect on the virtuous Hou Ji,
Who aligned with Heaven—
None but you could achieve this ultimate."*
Without such a man, to whom shall we turn?

This speaks of refining the medicine with fire—
Though there are fierce methods of rapid distillation,
Yet one must act according to the time,
Follow the natural course,
Wield force without force—
Thus avoiding the peril of overturning the elixir or toppling the cauldron.

Even when the vital breath moves,
And true yang arises—
Most vast, most strong,
Filling the two great vessels—
What differs from a warrior’s fierce, overwhelming rage,
Sweeping all before him?

Moreover, when gathering and refining the fire,
It is only because the浩然 (*hàorán*) breath expands—
Not for the sake of strength itself.
Thus, after purification,
Ordinary bones become jade bones,
And the mortal body transforms into a golden body.

It is said: *"Taking the Golden Elixir in the palm,
Or seizing the world as one picks up a feather."*
Only when the spirit is both concentrated and effortless,
And breathing is both regulated and unrestrained,
Does one purely follow Heaven,
Without human interference.

Even when Heaven and man contend,
And reason and desire clash—
One must still uphold reason to restrain desire,
And exhaust human effort to merge with Heaven.

When cultivation reaches its utmost refinement—
Principles profound, benevolence mature—
No trace remains of selfish ambition,
No striving for merit or prowess—
Thus the benevolent stand unmatched beneath Heaven.

Such is the way of humility and yielding,
Of emptiness and submission to others,
Of attuning to the ebb and flow of *qi*,
And letting it guide one’s transformation.

Therefore, the elixir’s completion
Has its unseen yet manifest,
Its motionless yet ever-changing,
Its effortless yet inevitable fulfillment.
What differs from a master’s skill in wielding others?

In cultivating the human *Dao*,
If one remains ever at peace,
Ever yielding and compliant,
Desire needing no suppression to suppress itself,
Reason needing no invocation to arise naturally—
This is called the *virtue* of non-contention.

With a heart of non-contention,
Following principle in action,
Adapting to circumstances in movement—
It is as though using others’ strength
To achieve one’s own success,
Yet encompassing Heaven and Earth’s transformations
Without overreaching.

Confucius said:
*"What does Heaven speak?
The four seasons proceed therein,
All things take life therein."*

The Sage merges with the *Dao* in truth,
Standing firm as the very threads of Heaven and Earth,
And establishing the ultimate measure for all ages.

**Chapter 69: The Victorious Through Compassion**
In warfare, it is said:
*"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends,
Nor advance an inch only to retreat a foot."*
This is called:
Moving without movement,
Pushing without arms,
Conquering without force,
Seizing without weapons.

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
Underestimating the enemy risks losing what is most precious.

Thus, when armies clash,
The compassionate prevail.

Ancient strategists spoke of battle tactics:
*"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends."*
The aggressor is like a sovereign—
A sovereign’s decrees command absolute authority;
The defender is like a minister—
A minister obeys the sovereign’s will,
As in *"Let the other be the host, I the guest."*

Thus, if I am the aggressor,
It means my post-Heavenly human-heart takes command,
While my pre-Heavenly *Dao*-heart retreats in submission.
How dare I let the post-Heavenly human-heart dominate,
And treat it as the guest while relying on it utterly?

*"I dare not advance an inch only to retreat a foot"*—
This means:
When victorious, even an inch gained must be firmly held;
When defeated, not even a single step may be conceded.
If one advances with an inch’s gain
Yet retreats by a foot’s measure,
It is to gain little and lose much,
Difficult to succeed and easy to fail.

In warfare, this is the mark of an incompetent general;
In cultivating the *Dao*, this is the fate of one who achieves nothing.
How dare I?

Only by yielding to the other as host,
And submitting myself as guest,
Does the enemy have no advantage to exploit,
And I no vulnerability to attack—
Thus, controlling others without being controlled,
Avoiding humiliation entirely.

Advance where opportunity allows,
Retreat where difficulty arises.
In advancing, one must rouse the spirit of boundless momentum;
In retreating, one must not present an assailable posture.
Such caution, such vigilance—
Always yielding precedence to others,
While placing oneself last.

Thus, in marching armies,
It appears as though others can move while I seem unable;
Yet when I press forward with resolve,
Stretching forth my arms,
It seems as though others have arms while I have none.
When facing the enemy in battle,
With armies locked in struggle,
It seems as though others can resist while I cannot.

Though drums thunder and flags billow,
The enemy wields weapons—
How could I alone be weaponless?

Thus, advancing without recklessness,
Retreating without haste—
Truly knowing that the fate of the state,
The rise or fall of the nation,
Hangs upon this single battle—
How could the enemy be treated lightly?

Observe the ancients who treated the enemy with caution—
They often succeeded;
Those who underestimated the enemy—
They invariably failed.
As seen in Guan Zi’s campaign against the Yanrong,
Or Zi Yu’s battle at Chengpu.

Moreover, the prosperity or decline of the court
Depends on the success or failure of its generals.
If one does not approach matters with utmost prudence,
Boasting of talent or relying on cunning,
And claiming none can surpass them—
Like Meng Ming’s reckless advance,
Or Gao Gu’s overconfident charge—
There has never been one who did not bring ruin to the state,
Destruction to the family,
And extinction to the ancestral line.

The Sage’s greatest treasure is *trust*—
Underestimating the enemy betrays the sovereign’s faith.

When two armies confront,
Two forces clash—
Yet one remains weak and yielding,
Most compassionate, most benevolent.
Always fearing that the *qi* of slaughter
Disrupts the harmony of Heaven and Earth;
Never rejoicing in the might of arms
To expand territory through conquest.

Warfare on the battlefield
Is but a last resort.
Though no weeping follows the army’s retreat,
The heart of compassion and pity,
The anguish and urgency of grief,
Already permeate the encamped troops,
And the three armies are nourished by it,
While the common people respond with gratitude.

Thus, the virtuous either do not war,
Or, if they do, they prevail.
Is this not because the heart of compassion
Extends to others,
And enters their very souls?

This illustrates the birth of true *yang*,
The flourishing of *qi*—
Only then may the fire be refined and the work proceed.

If one does not quietly await the *yin* essence’s movement,
And leisurely regulates the ascent and descent,
The advance and retreat,
The cyclical circulation of spirit—
There will be none who do not suffer from errant fire,
And face great humiliation.

At the four critical junctures,
One must await the *kan* *qi*’s spontaneous motion,
Lest *li* presume to dominate.
Thus it is said:
*"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends."*

In the *Dao* of cultivation,
Advancing brings stability,
Retreating brings disaster.
Like Heaven’s ceaseless motion,
Like water’s unending flow—
Only then does one ascend daily without halt.
If one proceeds intermittently,
Now pushing, now neglecting—
One step forward, ten steps back—
Gaining little, losing much—
Success will never be attained in a lifetime.

This arises from ignorance of the *Dao* of returning to the root,
Of restoring one’s true nature—
A path of daily practice,
Not to be seized by clever schemes,
Nor achieved through contrived actions.

「Indeed, those who cultivate the *Dao* of the elixir in reverse—
Forcing the *Dao* against its natural flow—
Study as though they do not study,
And labor though their efforts yield no fruit,
Yet follow the *Dao*’s unfolding,
Proceeding with ease and without hindrance,
Taking nothing in hand—
It is like the Great Yu taming the waters,
Acting where there is no need to act.

Should one instead advance fire and invoke talismans,
Lightly rushing forward or retreating,
It is like a soldier who scorns his enemy—
None have escaped fire rising to harm the elixir,
Or the furnace crumbling while the cauldron fails,
Thus causing lead and mercury to scatter in ruin.

Ah! To trust nature purely,
And to hold oneself in reverent caution—
This alone ensures the radiant brilliance of success.

But if one recklessly fancies cleverness,
The treasure of longevity will be slain by this very *post-heaven* thief of the corpse,
And its harm will be without end—
How then can one hope for an elixir that is both great and enduring?

Only with boundless compassion,
And profound sorrow for all things,
Does one then manifest in peace,
And act with gentle compliance—
Thus does nature yield in all directions,
And every battle is won without struggle.

Students of the *Dao* must be cautious:
Do not let the *post-heaven* mind of knowledge dominate,
While the *pre-heaven* primordial *qi* retreats in submission—
Then perhaps will there be no deviation.

**Chapter Seventy: The Humble Clothes the Precious Jade**

My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
None can practice them.

Words have a *root* (*宗*),
Affairs have a *master* (*君*).
It is only because of ignorance,
That none recognize me.

Few know me—
Thus I am held in esteem.

Therefore, the Sage wears coarse raiment,
Yet harbors the most precious jade.

The Great *Dao* is the inherent goodness of human nature,
A matter of daily practice,
Ever near and close—
One cannot separate from it for even a moment.

To separate is to lose the *Dao*,
To lose the *Dao* is to lose humanity—
Then what words are there?

Even if my teachings were piled in millions,
Filling chests and boxes beyond count,
Yet all are intimately tied to human nature,
Close to daily practice—
None are difficult to know or practice.

So why is it that none under Heaven can know or practice them?
Is it because my words are not easy to know or practice?

No—it is because words have a *root*,
And affairs have a *master*—
The *root* being the innate knowledge one does not need to study,
The *master* being the innate ability one does not need to learn.

If one knows the *root* of words,
Then one draws near from within oneself,
And all words become virtuous speech.

If one knows the *master* of affairs,
Then one silently observes their hidden essence,
And all actions become virtuous deeds.

The *Dao* is like a great road—
How could it be difficult to know or practice?

To reflect inwardly and be sincere—
No greater joy is there.

If one does not know that words have a *root*,
Or that affairs have a *master*,
And instead seeks them in distant and lofty places,
Or in broad and remote lands—
Then one indulges in trifles and loses one’s resolve,
Pursues the vast and strays from the essential,
Makes one’s form a burden,
And one’s nature a chain of *qi*—
Thus does the original virtue of Heaven’s *Dao* grow dim?

Even so,
Their knowing me adds nothing to me,
Their ignorance harms me not at all.
For my being is my own—
It does not depend on others’ knowing or ignorance.

Few know me—
Thus my value remains unchanged to me.

Therefore, the Sage dons the most humble rags,
Yet within holds the most noble jade—
He obscures his presence in the mountains and forests,
Hides himself in rocky caves—
Only to align with the principles of nature and life,
To harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s *Dao*,
And to cultivate what lies within himself.
Whether others recognize or deny him,
He cares not in the least.

This is why the wise grow ever wiser,
And the foolish grow ever more foolish.

The words of the Supreme Sage (*太上*) are *Dao* in every line,
And every character speaks to the self.

To speak of *Dao* is to speak of humanity,
To speak of humanity is to speak of the *Dao*—
Nothing could be easier than this.

So why are there those who find it difficult to know or practice?

It is because the ignorant seek the *Dao* afar,
Yet it lies near—
They seek what is easy as difficult,
And what is simple as complex.

They do not attend to the true and constant *Dao*,
But instead chase after dross and remnants—
Like the study of rhetoric, memorization, legal codes, or divination—
The more they learn, the more their minds stray,
The more affairs they handle, the more their nature deteriorates.
No wonder the words of the Supreme Sage
Are understood by all in their time,
Yet only the Supreme Sage understands them in later ages.

It is because they fail to grasp
That words have a *root*,
And affairs have a *master*.

This *root* and *master*—
They are the “**middle**” (*中*) of humanity itself.

When Yao and Shun passed on the *Dao*,
It was nothing but “**Hold fast to this middle**” (*允执厥中*).

Later, the teachings of Confucius on “**purity and unity**” (*纯一*),
Of the *Zhongyong* on “**solitary vigilance**” (*慎独*),
And of the *Kō* School on “**innate knowledge**” (*良知*),
Are all but variations of the human “**middle**.”

This single character “**middle**” (*中*)
Encompasses much.

Within humanity, it is twofold:
One guards the *middle* of form—
Zhu Xi says: “**Guard the middle to regulate the outside.**”
To guard the *middle* is to turn light inward,
To focus attention on what is central.
At the point one inch below the navel,
Neither clinging nor rejecting—this is it.

One guards the *middle* of the formless—
The *Zhongyong* says: *“Before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise, this is the **middle**.”*
Luó Cóngyàn taught Lǐ Yánpíng:
“Observe the *middle* in stillness,
And the phenomena of joy, anger, sorrow, or delight—
In this unarisen state,
Neither heard nor seen,
With reverent caution and fear—
Then nature settles and the mind clears,
And one sees the original face.
Then human desires grow pure,
And Heaven’s principle shines bright.
From ancient times, sages, immortals, Buddhas,
All took this as the first step of practice.
But one must first guard the *middle* with strenuous effort,
And finally attain the *middle* in pure nature.”

The three sages have different names,
Yet all take the “**middle**” (*中*) as their *root*,
As their *master*.

Even as I teach,
Concentrating the mind and harmonizing the breath—
Then one turns inward to observe the original orifice,
The mind devoid of its own mind,
The *qi* devoid of its own *qi*—
Only then does one achieve peace of mind and harmony of breath.
Peace of mind brings concentration,
Harmony of breath brings regulation.
The essence lies only in the two words: *peace of mind*.

When the mind does not stir—
This is *peace*.
To hold fast to the *middle*—
This is *peace*.
*Peace* is within this *middle*.」

The heart abides here—this is the **mysterious orifice** (*玄關*) of the **elixir scriptures** (*丹經*).
When **Dao/Way** (*神*) and **qi** (*氣*) become interdependent,
The essence of the **mysterious orifice** is established,
This is the *root* of the **Great Dao** (*大道*), the *origin* of the **golden elixir** (*金丹*).

As in **refining fire** (*進火*) and **withdrawing talismans** (*退符*),
**Transporting and refining** (*搬運*) the **river vehicle** (*河車*),
All **actions** (*有為*) and **endeavors** (*有作*)
Ultimately value **modesty** (*謙*), **gentleness** (*和*), **softness** (*柔*), and **docility** (*順*).
**Compose** (*以整*) and **rest** (*以暇*), neither **aiding** nor **forgetting**.
**Essential matters** (*有要*) return to the **non-dual** (*無*),
Yet the **non-dual** (*無*) again gives rise to **duality** (*有*).
When **duality** and **non-duality** cease to stand,
Only then does one align with the **natural Dao** (*天然道體*).

This is the attainment of **oneness** (*一*)—
All matters complete—
The **Way** of my teaching: **"One penetrates all"** (*一以貫之*).

If scholars understand this,
They may solve the **Laozi’s** (*太上*) **lightness** (*輕*),
And avoid being misled by **heterodox paths** (*旁門左道*).

If one does not know the **root** (*有宗*) of speech,
The **master** (*有君*) of practice,
One may not be permitted to enter the hall—
Yet be lost in other pursuits.

When one knows this and acts accordingly,
Naturally there will be attainment within,
No longing for the external.
Like the **sage** (*聖人*) **wearing coarse robes yet harboring jade** (*被褐怀玉*),
Yet **radiant and unrestrained** (*融融泄泄*) without end.

**Chapter Seventy-One: The Superiority of Knowing the Unknown**
*"Knowing the unknown"* (*知不知*), superior;

「Not knowing what one knows is an affliction.
Only by recognizing this affliction—
Does one truly escape it.

The sage is free from affliction,
For he recognizes his affliction—
Thus, he is free from it.

His wisdom shines like a dustless mirror,
Still waters without ripples—
All things reflected, none evading its light.

This divine clarity is innate,
Naturally knowing through phenomena,
As the heart perceives them.
Not conjecturing to claim insight,
Nor guessing to feign knowledge.

His knowing arises from the self-luminous nature,
Not from preordained foresight,
Yet he discerns what others cannot.

This is the wisdom of the supreme sage—
Beyond the reach of common men.

Ordinary minds cannot penetrate truth,
Nor illuminate phenomena.
They speculate on others’ sincerity,
Anticipate the rise and fall of affairs—
If by chance they guess correctly,
Men praise their mirror-like clarity,
And they boast of their divine discernment.

Such contrived knowledge is not divine illumination,
But forcing ignorance into knowledge:
Though they claim understanding,
Their weary minds and labored thoughts
Are already deeply afflicted—
Self-made cleverness,
Self-draining vital essence.

Only by recognizing forced knowledge as affliction,
Does one cure what ails them.
Thus, they investigate truth to fulfill their nature,
Cultivate their essence to await Heaven’s timing.
Wise yet unassuming,
Intelligent yet appearing foolish,
Their minds become empty as water,
Their nature clear as ice,
A single luminous spirit,
Piercing through the Three Thousand Worlds—
Why endure the toil of scheming,
The labor of artifice, as burdens?

Thus, they are free from affliction.

The sage’s insight penetrates all affairs,
His wisdom encompasses all things.
He possesses innate enlightenment,
Lacks no conjectural guesswork.

Common men are afflicted,
But the sage is not—
For he afflicts his ignorance,
Afflicts his obscurity,
And thus, with wholehearted devotion,
He gathers all within the Mysterious Pass.
With time, his luminous spirit blazes forth,
Illuminating without remainder—
Ever present, ever advantageous,
Nowhere hindered.

Because he afflicts his affliction,
He is free from affliction.

This is the knowing of enlightened wisdom—
The highest attainment.
Yet contrived knowledge is a grave peril.
Only by recognizing forced knowing as affliction,
Does one escape affliction entirely.

The sage’s freedom from peril lies in
Treating this peril as peril—
Thus, he knows no peril.

The essence is now clear—
No further elaboration is needed.»

Now let me unfold the subtleties of the Dao more fully:

In general, when seated in meditation, one must first depart from the mundane to cultivate *zhì* (定), striking a single resonant note before self-examining and self-verifying. If indeed there is nothing at all—empty and void—then the mind is clarified and nature is seen.

Thus I have often said: At the outset of seated stillness, this mind hangs suspended in the boundless void. Only when body and mind are settled, and intention and *qi* harmonized, may one gradually gather and reflect inward upon the original palace.

When nothing remains within the chest, and one awakens to this luminous awareness, then the ten directions and three realms are all encompassed within this awakening perception.

Yet the nature of awakening neither arises nor perishes—it is simply clear and self-illuminating, as it ever was.

If one seeks the Mysterious through this, the source becomes utterly pure, and may serve as the foundation for my elixir’s formation.

In an instant, the innate light naturally manifests.

How does one recognize this? Within that former state of vague and indistinct perception—when suddenly awakening and moving, this marks the essential beginning of Dao cultivation.

Yet to govern emotions with nature—if one does not first uncover the true essence of nature itself, and instead plunges blindly into the watery depths seeking the Mysterious, how can one govern emotions when nature is already lost?

For there exists a primal, vibrant vitality of the spirit.

Know that *Lí* (離) does not belong to the mind: when one concentrates auditory resonance, contains visual radiance, restrains the senses of scent, taste, and touch—these are all the workings of divine fire, hence it is called *Lí*.

*Kǎn* (坎) is not *qi*: wherever vital essence resides, that is *Kǎn*.

Even if divine essence enters the blood, and fire heats the waters, this does not necessarily stir *qi*—one must lift from left and right, gathering the waves from the abyssal depths, guiding them upward to the elixir field. Through prolonged refinement, when the fire is sufficient, suddenly the celestial mechanism activates, and the body leaps in ecstasy, from fingertips to every limb, trembling ceaselessly.

The body stands rigid as a wall, the mind cold as ashes. When the elixir field’s *qi* grows warm, this is the balanced state—neither too hot nor too cool—of the fire’s union.

If this phenomenon does not appear, the fire is still too weak and must not be applied. If one persists in this state without igniting the fire, the *qi* will already have dissipated by the time one attempts it—this is the peril of aged, useless medicine. Students must discern this carefully.

Yet when the subtle yang first stirs, it may not yet produce such vigorous *qi*. As long as the mind is tranquil and intention at ease, and breathing harmonized, one may still practice the *Zi-Wu* (子午) River Vehicle.

For the body’s formed and substantial blood, unrefined by fire, remains murky and stagnant—a mass of lifeless sludge. Only when divine fire illuminates does a single point of true *qi* emerge within the blood.

This is as the Buddha said: *"In this defiled and impure age, I cultivated and attained the fruit of the Dao."*

The ancients also spoke of *"taking treasure from the ghost’s nest, seeking lead beneath the black mountain"*—all referring to the same process: within the turbid essence and decayed blood, divine fire refines this single point of true *qi*.

Once *qi* moves, yang arises. One must then know the laws of *Zi* advancing yang and *Wu* retreating yin, along with the methods of *Mǎo-Yǒu* (卯酉) bathing, to extract this true yang and circulate it freely. Internally, it dispels the hidden yin of the viscera; externally, it attracts the celestial true yang’s vital *qi*.

With prolonged practice, even the substance of *qi* transforms.

This River Vehicle method holds boundless profundity.

The ancients said, *"When the *qi* is clear, the Zi-Wu River is drawn and added"*—drawing refers to extracting lead from the watery depths, adding refers to supplementing mercury from the *Lí* palace.

Mercury is the luminous fluid of the mind—the later heaven within the earlier heaven. From the colored body’s turbid essence and decayed blood, divine fire refines it into sweet dew—this is lead, the *qi* within the blood.

This *qi* is what the ancients called *"gold within the water"*—it belongs to the later heaven within the earlier heaven, sufficient only to stabilize the mundane, not to generate the Dharma body.

This is the medicine produced by the union of *Kǎn* and *Lí*, yet it is still not the true elixir.

One must govern emotions with nature, return nature to nature, and when nature and emotions harmonize, refine them together in the *Kūn* (坤) furnace. Suddenly, true yang erupts—this is the union of *Qián* (乾) and *Kūn*, and only then does one forge the divine elixir into a true immortal.

In summary, there is no other method of cultivation—only the ceaseless turning of the River Vehicle.

At the lower pass, the River must be forced;
At the middle pass, the River Vehicle arises from both human and celestial;
At the upper pass, the River Vehicle flows purely of its own accord, never failing in its timing.

As for the methods of *Mǎo-Yǒu* bathing, these are only for beginners lest their minds grow restless and the fire flare unchecked. When one reaches mastery, no methods are needed.

It all depends on the student’s divine illumination.

Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear the **Way**’s **威**

The people do not fear the **威**—the **威** has reached its peak.

Do not confine their dwelling, do not weary of their birth.

For it is only through not wearying that one does not weary.

Thus, the sage knows himself but does not display himself, loves himself but does not exalt himself.

Hence, one discards that and embraces this.

The **威** spoken of is the grand framework of **纲常名教** (social norms and moral teachings), the most difficult transgression of **天理** (Heavenly Principle).

Let them know to be cautious in solitude, even in bed and shadow,
To fear the **威** of Heaven in its hidden subtleties—
Then naturally, Heaven’s blessings will be pure and abundant,
And their longevity will know no bounds.

The *Shijing* (Book of Odes) says:
*"Fear the **威** of Heaven,
And it will preserve you in due time."*

If the **威** of Heaven looms near like a foot’s length,
Yet one does not remain vigilant and clear each morning,
It will lead to the collapse of propriety and the extinction of rites—
Then Heaven’s **天良** (natural conscience) will vanish,
Heaven’s **天罚** (retribution) will not be spared,
And disasters will not be avoided,
Life will not be preserved.

Thus, the people do not fear the **威**—the **威** has reached its peak.

If such is the case,
It is because they do not know that **知仁** (knowing virtue) is their secure abode,
Yet they abandon this abode and do not dwell within it;
That **义** (righteousness) is the source of **生气** (life force),
Yet they forsake this life force and bring ruin upon themselves.

Alas! Those people are unfortunate,
Born not into the age of **太古** (Primordial Antiquity),
Where **德威** (virtue and awe) are feared,
And **德明** (virtue and clarity) are held in reverence—
Thus they act with external transgressions and ignorance,
Heaven’s signs are neglected,
And drought, flood, pestilence, and famine arise—
Disasters of all kinds flourish.

Only the ruler above should guide them with the vast dwelling of **天下** (the world),
And let them wander in the realm of **太和** (Great Harmony),
Not confining them in narrowness,
Yet daily treading upon the brink of peril and annihilation;
Should draw them with **浩然** (boundless) **正气** (right qi),
And let them nourish it in the **清虚** (pure and empty) **天** (Heaven),
Not wearying of their birth,
Yet risking to fall into ruin and cessation.

It is only through cherishing the principle of their own life,
And preserving Heaven’s **天良** (natural conscience),
Without the slightest weariness or exhaustion,
That one attains the *Shijing*’s words:
*"Revere Heaven’s wrath,
And do not dare trifle with it;
Revere Heaven’s decrees,
And do not dare neglect them."*

Heaven observes their **德** (virtue),
And grants them brilliance and prosperity,
Longevity and preservation—
Indeed, there exists one who shares in Heaven and Earth’s eternal duration.
Thus, it is through not wearying that this is achieved.

Who but the sage could accomplish this?

The ancient emperors cultivated humility and non-action,
Illuminated great **德** (virtue/power),
Daily refining and monthly perfecting,
Purifying their hearts and clearing their thoughts,
Penetrating the marvels of **造化** (creation and transformation),
Piercing the clarity of **本来之天** (the original Heaven),
Only knowing themselves in truth.

As for **德业文章** (virtuous deeds and literary attainments),
The external marks they bear—
The sage never uses them to display or reveal himself to others.

Moreover, they revered the **乾** (Qian) at dawn and the **坤** (Kun) at dusk,
Heavily upheld the **Dao/Way** and guarded their bodies,
Never for a breath departing from **仁** (benevolence),
And the world could not add anything to them.

How did they love themselves?—
As for fame, rank, reputation, and glory—
The things others hold in high regard,
The sage never considered them worthy of exaltation.

Though the sage’s own self-knowledge and self-love
Are the same as what all people know and love—
It is only that common people, knowing it, must make it manifest,
Loving it, must hold it in high esteem;
The sage knows himself but does not display himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Their caution in solitude is profound,
Yet they do not indulge in ostentation before the world;
They uphold self-nourishment,
Yet they do not dare to boast of it.

How could they be compared with common people?

It is said that by discarding desire and embracing principle,
By fulfilling humanity’s potential in harmony with Heaven,
One ascends to transcend the mortal and attain sainthood,
To sever resemblance and depart from the crowd,
And become an immortal enduring millions of years—
All this arises from knowing the vast dwelling’s security,
Cherishing the eternal life’s joy,
Focusing solely on this and not on that,
And the people naturally move toward goodness, unaware of their own doing.

Abandon this, how could such goodness be achieved?

These words mean:
Do not confine their dwelling—then their dwelling will be grand.
Do not weary of their birth—then their birth will be long.

However, in the cultivation process,
The **元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) must be understood.

When a person first receives **气** (qi),
At the moment of union between father and mother,
A single **黍珠** (millet-sized pearl) is formed—
At this time, it is **絪絪缊缊** (unformed and indistinct),
A mere cluster of **太和** (Great Harmony) **气** (qi),
With no trace of knowledge.

Yet, it is the most divine and wondrous essence,
Exhausting all transformations and producing endless worldly affairs—
All from this single **含灵** (life-containing) **气** (qi) **神** (spirit),
From **无知无识** (no knowledge, no perception) to **有知有识** (knowledge and perception),
From **无作无为** (no action, no doing) to **有作有为** (action and doing),
None of which are not initiated here.

At this stage, **天人一理** (Heaven and humanity are one principle),
**物我同源** (things and self share the same origin),
**体用兼赅** (substance and function are inseparable),
And **显微无间** (manifest and subtle are continuous)—
Thus, it is called the **元神** (Original Spirit).

This is what Heaven bestows.

When the blood and flesh take form,
Ten months within the womb,
A cry at birth—
The infant emerges, and the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) begins to manifest.

The **元神** (Original Spirit) is the **元气** (Primordial Qi) of **先天** (pre-heaven),
Shared by Heaven, Earth, and all beings,
Hidden within the **太虚** (Great Void).
Once it enters the human body,
It is concealed in the **虚无窟子** (void-like cavity) within the person.
This is Heaven’s gift.

Those who cultivate seek not to grasp at emptiness or color in their pursuit.
Only through **无所知** (no knowledge) and **无所有** (no possession),
Sweeping away all dust and turbidity,
Does the inner essence reveal itself,
And the divine mystery arise.

As for the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit),
It is the **精灵** (refined essence) **鬼** (spirit) of the human body,
The seed of endless **轮回** (reincarnations).
It requires the five senses and the complete formation of the ten thousand limbs,
Only when the person is about to be born and descend to earth,
Does the refined essence’s **魂魄** (soul and vital force) find attachment.

The ancients called this the **后天识神** (post-heaven Perceptive Spirit),
Because it arises from the formed **魄** (vital force).

This is the fundamental distinction between **元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit).

Yet after birth,
The two spirits—**元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit)—
Merge into one.

Sometimes the **元神** (Original Spirit) is active,
And the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) recedes in silence—
Though the **后天** (post-heaven) **意气** (intentions and emotions) may stir,
They all arise from **仁义礼智** (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom),
And manifest as **喜怒哀乐** (joy, anger, sorrow, delight).
The **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) also transforms into the **元神** (Original Spirit).

Sometimes the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) is active,
And the **元神** (Original Spirit) is concealed—
Though traces of **仁义礼智** (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom) appear,
They all become **私恩、私爱、私憎、私嫌** (private favors, private affections, private hatreds, private suspicions).
The **元神** (Original Spirit) also transforms into the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit).

The **Perceptive Spirit** alone governs the body and senses—
Once it takes charge, how could there be purity and rectitude
To undertake deeds worthy of Heaven and Earth,
Or confront the spirits of the numinous?

Only in the boundless void, when the Spirit stirs at a single impulse,
Does Heavenly Principle remain untainted—
No trace of post-heaven perception mingles within.
If one steadies the footing here and proceeds with unwavering resolve,
Then one is purely Heavenly Principle,
With not a thread of human desire’s private schemes.

Thus I teach: when in ignorance and unawareness,
Seek the single aperture of the **Mystic Pass**—
For then one is one with Heaven and Earth,
And harmonized with the boundless void.

If one seizes this and presses forward,
Then the generative flow of Heaven and Earth
Need not be borrowed—it arises from within.
The transformations of the void
Need not be borrowed—its mysteries unfold from within.
This awakening is truly the root of Heaven, Earth, and Man.

If cultivators do not begin here,
Where else shall they ascend to sagehood and transcendence?

In sum:
What emerges without thought or deliberation—**Original Spirit**.
What arises with schemes, judgments, and from the colored form—**Perceptive Spirit**.
The **Original Spirit** is formless; the **Perceptive Spirit** leaves traces.
One originates from the void; one emerges from the colored body—
These two are utterly dissimilar.

Once it is clear that the **Original Spirit** arises from the void,
And the **Perceptive Spirit** from the colored form,
Then I return to the root and clear the source,
Striving to seal the inner and outer **Three Treasures**,
Not permitting a single perception or thought
To emerge from form, image, deliberation, or awareness.

If one cultivates thus, if one nurtures thus,
Over time, even the soul of the corpse will transmute into pure **Original Spirit**,
And the eighty-four thousand hairs will become protective **Spiritual Warriors**.
This is what is meant by
*"Transforming Perception into Originality,
Converting Yin into Yang."*

This lies in anchoring oneself in the void,
Not allowing the colored body to dictate perception.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Three: Unsummoned, It Comes**

*"Bold in daring brings death;
Bold in restraint brings life."*
These two—sometimes advantageous, sometimes harmful.
What Heaven abhors, who can fathom its reason?
Thus even the Sage finds it difficult.

The **Dao of Heaven** conquers without striving,
Responds without speaking,
Arrives without being summoned—
Open and yet masterfully plotting.
*"The Heavenly Net is vast, wide yet not missing a thread."*
The *Odes* say:
*"The Mandate of Heaven—
Ah, its solemnity never ceases!"*
He who steals Heaven and Earth’s **qi** to forge the Elixir
Steals from the solemn, unceasing Mandate of Heaven.

This Mandate, in Heaven, is the pure and void **qi**;
In Man, it is the **Great Harmony** of **Heavenly Principle**.
Only by direct cultivation from dawn’s first light,
Until the **Overflowing Virtue** fills the two extremes,
Does one return to the root and restore the Mandate—
Ascending and descending, flowing with Heaven and Earth alike.

How does one cultivate?
First, in **killing false thoughts**—
False thoughts must be firm,
Unyielding to external things,
So that **Right Qi** may always expand.
Second, in **nurturing true thoughts**—
True thoughts must be yielding,
For yielding can delight all hearts,
So that **Overflowing Virtue** may always congeal.

These two—
The relentless, daring force of *"killing"* is the **mechanism of death**.
The hesitant, weak submission of *"not daring"* is the **vitality of life**.
*"Bold in daring brings death"*—this is the foundation of retreat as advance,
Of defeat as the root of victory.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"At high noon, the sun declines;
When the moon is full, it wanes."*
Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness move with the times—
Sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful,
Often contrary to the world’s expectations.
Thus what Man rejoices in, Heaven may abhor.

Moreover, what does Heaven truly abhor?
The **Heavenly One’s** heart cherishes life,
Yet sometimes employs death;
The **Supreme Deity’s** intent upholds virtue,
Yet sometimes enforces punishment.
This is life within death, death within life—
Its meaning profound, beyond mortal comprehension.
What Heaven abhors, who can know its reason?

Thus the Sage, cultivating the **Dao**,
Knows that fortune is the foundation of calamity,
That yielding is the substance of firmness,
And balances extremes while holding to the mean.
Abandoning self-interest, they guard the **Right Way**,
Not contending with the vulgar over gain or loss,
But discerning only their own compliance or defiance.

As for bestowing calamity or blessing,
Granting good fortune or misfortune—
Even the Sage finds it difficult to divine,
Let alone those beneath.

The **Dao of the Sage** is the **Dao of Heaven**.
The Sage acts purely in accordance with Nature,
While advancement, retreat, ascent, and descent
Flow within the body’s transformations.
Heaven’s **Dao** acts without action, in accordance with Nature,
While generation, growth, withdrawal, and storage
Ever circulate beyond the void—
Thus it does not contend with all things for dominance,
Yet life and death hover ever near,
And none can defy its reach—
This is conquering without striving.

It does not speak of principle to the common folk,
Yet its blessings and calamities extend everywhere—
No place escapes its reach—
This is responding without speaking.

Though its timing may vary—
Swift or slow, heavy or light—
There is an unseen balance,
A power beyond mortal design.
Thus it is said:
*"Unsummoned, it comes;
Open, yet masterfully plotting."*

No matter how brilliant one’s talent,
Or how cunning one’s schemes,
If the heart is exposed, all pretense is futile.
*"The Heavenly Net is vast, wide yet not missing a thread."*
This is no falsehood.

To suppress desire requires decisiveness—
Without decisiveness, the heart runs wild,
And human desires cling tenaciously—
Thus *"bold in daring brings death"*—
This is the killing of the human heart.

To preserve Principle requires yielding—
Without yielding, vulgar **qi** becomes violent,
And **Original Qi** falters—
Thus *"bold in restraint brings life"*—
This is the vitality of the **Original Spirit**.

Yet the **mechanism of death** and the **vitality of life** mutually aid each other.
The human heart is easy to kill;
The **Dao-heart** is easy to nurture—
Yet within lies the **Dao of Heaven**.

The **Heavenly Dao** bestows both punishment and virtue, life and death in common use.
Though some may grasp this, few comprehend how life’s potential lies within death’s grasp,
Or vitality’s hidden within the **mechanism of death**—
The world struggles to perceive such subtleties.

Who truly knows what Heaven abhors?
The Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Understanding that what Heaven abhors must be what it loves—
For *"without abhorrence, there can be no true love."*
This cyclic interplay of wondrous function,
Even the Sage finds difficult to fathom.

Yet the Sage’s **Dao** is but Heaven’s **Dao**.
Heaven does not dispute right and wrong with the common folk,
But nurtures all things—
None escape its warmth and favor,
Nor stray against its will.

Heaven does not speak of **sensing and responding**,
Yet yin and yang alternate in motion—
None fail to harmonize in silent accord,
Nor stray against its will.

Truly, **Heaven and humanity share the same Dao**—
Motionless yet responsive,
Transformative in its divine mystery!
All things spring from the same source,
Boundless and impartial—
When things come, it responds;
How could actions be more precise?

The **Perfect One** with **unthinking, unworried sincerity**,
Silently wields **divine function** at the crossroads of life and death,
Stealthily seizes **Heaven’s mechanism** within the **Palace of Creation**,
Descending into the **Watery Realm**,
Shaping the **Golden Land**,
Following the **Hidden and the Strange**,
Severing sight and sound—
Death becomes life, life becomes death;
At first, none know how they intermingle and respond,
Like mother and child, husband and wife—
They come without summons, unite without scheme.

Is this not the swiftness of **sensing and responding**,
And the divine mystery?

Even calamities and blessings are bestowed or taken away,
Fortune and misfortune are fixed or corrupt—
*"The Heavenly Net is vast, wide yet not missing a thread,"*
Truly, none can escape or evade it.
For **emptiness and space are the Dao**,
And **Dao is Heaven**—
One cannot evade emptiness,
Nor escape the **Heavenly Net**.

If humanity does not defy the **Dao**, it does not defy Heaven—
Then how could Heaven cease to nourish them?

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**
If the people do not fear death,
How can one frighten them with death?

If I made the people always fear death as something extraordinary,
I could seize and kill them—
Who would dare?

There are always those who execute punishment and kill.
To substitute for those who execute punishment and kill,
Is like substituting for the **Great Carpenter** to hew—
To substitute for the **Great Carpenter** to hew,
Few would not harm their own hands.

In ancient times, those who governed the world
Must have followed what easily moved the people’s emotions,
And preemptively guarded against it.
They did not follow the ruler’s joys or sorrows,
But only observed the people’s likes and dislikes,
Guiding them along their natural inclinations—
Thus their teachings succeeded without severity,
And their governance thrived without excessive measures.

If the people abandoned moral norms and violated propriety,
Daring to transgress the established order,
Yet held no fear of death,
Then even with the **Five Punishments** displayed on the **Torture Stakes**,
And proclaimed on auspicious days,
It would be in vain to establish them—
Of no use to the state or the people—
Would this not be a waste of effort?

Only by leveraging the people’s love of life and fear of death,
And daring to act deceitfully or maliciously,
Would I then follow and kill them—
This is what is meant by *"strike one to warn a hundred,"*
And *"inflict few punishments yet inspire great sincerity."*

Thus the people, from father to son, from elder to younger brother,
Would not dare to act as stepping stones to chaos—
They would fear self-destruction and embrace death.

Yet though the killing is done by those above,
The reason for killing depends on the person.
Only the **most virtuous** kill the **most unvirtuous**,
And the people themselves kill the unvirtuous without mercy,
Finding death sweet.

Mencius said: *"Only Heaven’s officers can be killed"*—
For **Heaven’s officers** are those who may kill others.

If one is not a **Heaven’s officer**,
Yet kills with violent retribution,
This is to govern chaos with chaos—
Not only does the people’s chaos worsen,
But to substitute for those who execute punishment and kill,
Is like a mere craftsman wielding the axe to shape the wind,
Or swinging the blade to carve wheels—
Could such a one master the divine artistry and achieve perfection?

Observing craftsmen and scholars of past and present,
If they cannot equal the **Great Carpenter**,
Yet substitute to hew,
Who has not harmed their own hands?

Alas, the people are unfortunate—
Not born in an age of **Dao**,
Thus bandits and thieves, deceitful and treacherous,
Have no restraint.
And even more unfortunate,
They do not encounter those who execute punishment—
Then where would they find guidance?
If the thin become even thinner,
And the thick also thin,
Is this not deeply lamentable?

「Thus, using the fear of death to illustrate the caution of solitude—
A person’s diligence in solitude is profound,
Then the distinction between Heaven and man becomes clear,
And the separation of desires and principles is manifest.
Though desires are few and faults not yet committed,
And one strives to avoid transgressions yet cannot—
In this, one is ever vigilant and earnest,
Dreading the slightest lapse,
Striving to suppress falsehood and deceit,
It is not difficult to purify desires and refine principles,
And instantly reveal the **original face of nature**.

If, in places unseen and unheard,
One lacks daily cultivation of moral restraint and self-nurturing,
Yet at moments when desires surge and emotions overwhelm,
One attempts to uproot evil and sudden sees **True Nature**,
Then it is certain that evil will not be uprooted but will multiply,
And the more one strives to cleanse the heart, the more it will be disturbed.

The **Supreme Sage** said:
*“If the people do not fear death, how can one frighten them with death?”*
Reason and circumstance are thus interdependent—
Only by guarding against temptation in seclusion,
Having known the wrongness of desires,
Can one restrain them in the moment,
And thus return to the **natural order of the mind**.

When one thought is swept away,
And one thought is purified,
Evil will not sprout anew from that moment.
This is why the people commonly fear death,
Yet those who act strangely—
If I seize them and execute them,
Who would dare to rebel or disrespect,
Or violate the **proper order of relationships**?

Indeed, the **Dao/Way** drives out the lack of **Dao/Way**,
Just as a ruler soothes and governs all subjects,
Commanding the common folk,
Using supreme mercy to kill those without mercy,
And great righteousness to punish the unrighteous—
Naturally, none who submit will remain secure,
Near ones will be pleased while distant ones will come,
And none will turn their weapons against their rulers,
Or strike back in rebellion,
To become enemies or cause harm.

Scholars who wish to discard falsehood and preserve sincerity,
To return to their roots and restore their origin,
Must suppress evil **gradually**,
And maintain constancy **steadfastly**,
So that when one opening is illuminated,
All openings will be **vital and responsive**,
And the **original spirit** will be at peace,
Obedient to its natural commands.
As it is said:
*“If a person can remain ever pure and clear,
Then all of Heaven and Earth will naturally return to them”*;
And again:
*“If a person can correct their spirit in one moment,
Then all evils will not dare to intrude.”*

This is akin to how those who execute punishment
Can kill without resentment,
And the condemned will meet their fate with acceptance—
The same **natural Dao/Way**,
A rare and wondrous effect.

**Chapter Seventy-Five: The Virtuous Excel in Not Valuing Life**
The people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation,
Thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in governance stems from their rulers’ meddling,
Thus they are difficult to govern.
The people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ obsession with prolonging life,
Thus they treat death lightly.

Only those who do not make life their pursuit
Are truly virtuous in excelling beyond valuing life.
From ancient times, the people are the foundation of the state,
And food is the **Heavenly necessity** for the people.
A state without people is a state without support—
Who will uphold it?
The people without food cannot survive—
How will they live?
Thus, for those who rule over others,
There must be those who open fields and cultivate land,
Deepening the **roots of abundance** before the people have need;
And those who establish rites and regulate changes,
Controlling the **flow of excess** after the people have eaten;
As well as those who reduce labor to fill shortages,
And curtail waste to aid insufficiency—
Then the people will naturally be well-fed and content,
Without the **cries of the starving** in the ninth month,
Or the **lamentations of famine**.

Even if droughts persist and famines recur,
Yet if the granaries are filled,
There will be no fear of calamity.

But in this world, rulers are often arrogant and licentious,
Their extravagance growing daily:
Some indulge in rare delicacies and curiosities for amusement,
Others build jade towers and palaces to gratify their desires—
Often the granaries are emptied,
Yet expenditures never decrease.
Even basic provisions are lacking,
And they impose additional levies:
First, they add taxes and increase tolls,
Yet still the people fear their **oppressive burdens**;
Next, they plunder and extort without restraint,
Ignoring even **Heaven’s command**.

Their love for music and beauty is paramount,
Their luxury and excess ever escalating.
They drain the **vital essence** of all the people,
To satiate their own **licentiousness**.
Even when the state’s treasury is exhausted,
Their demands for tribute never slacken.

Heaven and Earth produce wealth,
Only in these limited amounts.
If such **harsh extortion** continues without end,
And the people are taken without measure—
Even if there are frequent **abundant harvests**,
And years of **prosperity and blessing**,
How can one expect the people to not hunger?

In the age of **Zhuāng Lóng**,
Clothing was worn and food was eaten,
Houses were dwelt in and fields were tilled,
Each cherishing their own kin,
Each nurturing their own elders.
The **noble ones** had no need to inquire about rites and propriety,
Yet naturally dwelled in **Ren** and followed **Yì**;
The **common folk** had no fondness for loyalty and sincerity,
Yet naturally found joy in their work and peace in their homes.
Indeed, the rulers governed through **non-action**,
And the people transformed themselves through **non-action**.
Customs were not artificially made pure, yet they were pure,
And the **folkways** did not seek antiquity, yet they were ancient.
How harmonious and flourishing was that era!

But afterward, as **laws and regulations** multiplied,
And the **folkways** grew ever more **deviant and subtle**,
As **statutes and decrees** were frequently proclaimed,
And **bandits and thieves** became ever more rampant—
Not only under tyrannical rulers,
But even among **wise and enlightened kings**,
Who strove with vigor to govern,
Exerted their utmost in statecraft,
And whose policies grew ever more complex—
The more elaborate the laws, the more deceit arose,
The stricter the decrees, the more cunning flourished.
Is this not because **qi and techniques** cannot be reversed,
Or **Heaven’s will** cannot be altered?
Or because they **fail to grasp the roots and foundational principles**,
Yet seek only superficial results?

Not only does this fail to benefit the people’s livelihood,
But it **burdens the Way of the world**.

The people’s hearts are naturally at ease,
Yet rulers disturb them with **policies and commands**.
The people’s emotions are naturally without excess,
Yet rulers disrupt them with **rules and systems**.
Every additional **edict** from the court
Multiplies **deceit** among the common folk,
And every new **regulation**
Encourages **clever evasion** among them.

No wonder the **Way of the world** becomes ever more **perverse**,
And the people’s **moral inclinations** grow ever more **erratic**,
Making governance ever more difficult!

Only when the ruler sits **upright and still**,
And extends their **virtuous influence** without action,
Will the people below **naturally settle into order and obedience**.
The ruler and the people will be at peace in **Heaven’s non-action**—
Is this not joy indeed?

Moreover, those who **overvalue life** within
Will labor their hearts ever more,
And exhaust their **vital essence** ever further—
Their **spirit and qi** will dissipate,
And their **life and fate** will perish,
The more they cling to life, the faster they die.

Thus, the more one **obsesses over life**,
The more lightly one treats death.
Only those who do not **honor life**,
Nor **prioritize its preservation**,
Who dress and eat according to **natural circumstances**,
And whose expenditures **do not contend with the world’s resources**,
Will find their hearts at ease and their bodies secure,
Their **original nature** restored and their **fate prolonged**,
And **endless blessings** forever enjoyed.»

Nurture the **Great Harmony** within,
And invite **Heaven’s favor** upon yourself—
How much more virtuous than those who prize **artificial action**?
The **spirit** is the ruler, the **vital essence** the people.
Follow the **constant Dao** in its natural course,
With **spirit** as sovereign, and **vital essence** obeying its command.
Thus, when the **spirit** wanders, the **vital essence** leaks away.
The depletion of **vital essence** stems from the **spirit’s** flight—
Like the people’s hunger arising from excessive taxation by the ruler.
Though their forms differ, their principles are one.

The **heart** is the sovereign of the body;
When the **Heavenly Sovereign** is at ease,
All limbs follow its decree.
But if the **Heavenly Sovereign** is disturbed,
Then the **vital essence and qi** of the whole body are drained—
How much more so when the fields are laid waste!

Thus, **Immortal Adepts** possess the art of **returning to the origin**,
Taking **qi** as sovereign, while the **spirit** obeys its command—
Just as a ruler follows the people’s desires and yields to their sentiments,
So that **qi** is abundant, the **spirit** complete,
And the people at peace, the nation prosperous.
This is the way of **serving above by nourishing below**,
Of **abundance above** supplementing **deficiency below**—
To govern the world as one’s own affair,
Rather than making oneself the world’s burden.

Though the **Alchemical Dao** speaks of **action**,
It must first arise from **non-action**,
Then return to **non-action** once more—
Only then does one grasp the **original Heavenly spirit and qi**,
And ascend to **sainthood**, transcending the mundane.
If one clings entirely to **action**,
The **spirit** grows restless, and the **qi** weakens—
Inevitably, the more one refines, the more the **qi** scatters,
The more one labors, the more the **qi** disperses.
Only by guiding its momentum and acting in accordance with the times,
In governing oneself and the people alike,
Should one hold such a view.

If one fears wealth will fail and life will perish,
Then one exhausts **vital essence** and **spirit** in vain,
Hoping to preserve **postnatal life**,
Day and night in torment, restless in sleep—
Many a **spirit and qi** is thus consumed.
Yet **life and fate** are Heaven’s decree, not man’s to seek.
A ruler who fears for those who cling to life
Only hastens them toward death’s embrace.
Only by not valuing the **limited postnatal life**,
And instead preserving the **boundless prenatal fate**,
Can one safeguard **original nature** and **fate**,
And thus honor the body truly.

**Chapter LXXVI: The Soft and Weak Take Preeminence**
When a man is whole, he is soft and weak;
When he dies, he becomes rigid and strong.
Grasses and trees, when alive, are tender and pliable;
When dead, they wither and decay.
Thus, the rigid and strong are companions of death,
While the soft and weak are companions of life.
Hence, the strong in arms do not conquer,
And the rigid in wood bends and breaks.
The strong and great must yield to the lowly,
While the soft and weak ascend above.

When man receives the **Yang Harmony qi**, he lives;
When he encounters the **Yin Cold qi**, he dies.
When the **Yang Harmony qi** gathers,
The four limbs grow supple, the body soft as silk,
And life’s vitality flows unceasing.
But when the **Yin Cold qi** congeals,
The flesh grows dry and parched, the skin withers and falls away—
And the **qi of death** approaches.

Observe the pot and steamer:
When steaming, the **Yang qi** rises in mist,
And all things dissolve and transform.
But in freezing cold, they harden and stiffen.
Observe the earth in spring and summer:
When **Yang qi** thrives, all things flourish and grow—
None fail to bloom and thrive.
But in autumn and winter, when **Yin qi** prevails,
All things wither and fall—
None escape decay.

Man and all things share a single source;
There is no division between them.
Thus, in all things under Heaven,
The rigid and strong are companions of death,
While the soft and weak are companions of life.

Take warfare as an example:
Often the strong are defeated, the weak victorious—
As when **Ziyou**’s overbearing strength led to ruin,
And **Bibi**’s yielding tactics triumphed at **Rand**.
Why is this?
Because the strong grow exhausted in their vigor,
While the weak harbor the seeds of revival—
Thus, they cannot prevail.

Observe the trees:
Though wood is strong, when **Yin qi** dominates and **Yang qi** wanes,
It is bound and broken—
No longer capable of growth.
The strong and great exhaust their **life qi**,
And invite the **qi of death**—
Truly the lowest of all things.
The soft and weak, however, see **Yin qi** dissipate and **Yang qi** flourish—
The highest of all things.

How can man not embrace weakness and reject strength,
Nor submit to lowliness while aspiring to preeminence?

The **Dao of Cultivation** most reveres the **Mysterious Pass**—
The **original qi** of Heaven, Earth, and all things.
This **qi** is both supremely soft and hard,
Supremely weak and strong,
Yet neither soft nor hard, neither weak nor strong can be seen.
In the dim and hazy void,
Suddenly, **Yin** contains **Yang**, and **killing** gives birth to **life**—
Seemingly present, yet absent;
Seemingly real, yet empty.
This is the **silent, odorless**,
The **Heavenly mechanism** of **original beginning**.
If man can **steal this primordial void-qi**,
Then the **original life-giving source** is obtained,
And **ascension to Heavenly Immortality** is no longer difficult.

Even if one steals the **original qi of the Mysterious Pass**
As the **precious elixir**,
Yet when gathering herbs in the **two critical seasons**,
One must still focus the **qi** to achieve softness—
Like an infant, whose bones are soft, body weak, yet grip is firm—
Only then can the **original qi** be secured as the **elixir’s foundation**.

In the **four seasons of alchemical fire-refining**,
One must know the body’s softness, like silk, most exquisite—
This is the **original prenatal vitality**, bursting with life,
The **harmonious and lively** symbol.
With this **Yang qi**, one can forge the **Immortal Elixir**.

Then, at the **retreat-and-seal stage**,
When returning to the **furnace** for final refinement,
One must still be **soft and dense**,
**Clear and lucid**, without slackness or neglect—
Like one drunk or mad, the **spirit** lazy in thought,
The tongue lazy in speech—
As the saying goes:
*"Under Heaven, spring clouds are as lazy as I,
Who knows I am even lazier than spring?"*

Only such **softness and weakness** preserve the **original Yang qi**,
Enduring without decay.
In summary, ten months in the womb,
Three years at the breast,
Nine years in seclusion—
All are the **original soft and weak qi**,
Which, when perfected, yields the **elixir** and **Immortal attainment**.

The **Cultivator** must seek this **soft and tender qi**,
Lest he burn and refine in vain,
Wasting **spirit and vital essence**.

**Chapter LXXVII: Act Without Relying**

The **Dao** of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?
The high, it presses down; the low, it lifts up.
The excessive, it diminishes; the insufficient, it supplements.
The **Dao** of Heaven diminishes the excessive to supplement the insufficient,
But the **Dao** of humankind does otherwise—it diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive.
Who can serve the excessive to benefit the world?
Only the one who holds the **Dao**.

Thus, the Sage acts but does not rely,
Accomplishes but does not dwell—
Does this not mean he does not desire to be seen as virtuous?
The **Dao** of Heaven flows and unfolds,
Nurturing all things,
With naught but **yin** and **yang**,
Coming and going, alternating in motion,
Great, central, and most upright,
Without favor or bias.

Hence, **yin** at its peak gives rise to **yang**,
And **yang** at its peak gives rise to **yin**.
When **yin** is excessive and **yang** declines,
It suppresses **yin** and aids **yang**;
When **yang** is excessive and **yin** declines,
It suppresses **yang** and aids **yin**.
Ebb and flow, full and empty,
Move in harmony with time,
Thus all things are born and transformed,
Achieving effortless spontaneity,
A Heaven enduring ten thousand years without decay.
How different is this from the archer’s art?
Grasp the bow with steady resolve,
The inner will upright, the outer form aligned,
Ensure the front and back arms,
Balanced and smooth—
The high, it presses down; the low, it lifts up.
The excessive, it diminishes; the insufficient, it supplements.
Then, in accord with the hand, it releases,
Following the mark and striking true,
Without fear of missing.

Yet it does not compare to the **Dao** of Heaven—
Taking the people’s **fat and marrow**,
Filling its own **sacks of greed**,
Often diminishing the insufficient to serve the excessive.
Who can take the **excess of the sovereign**,
And serve the **insufficient of the world**?
Only the **Dao**-holding Sage,
Who follows the **Dao** of Heaven and aligns with human nature,
Diminishes what is excessive, supplements what is insufficient,
So that the common people do not sigh in resentment.
Though acting for oneself,
It is still in accordance with the **Dao** of Heaven—
Never boasting of what is done;
Though achievements come from sincerity,
It is but the utmost sincerity fulfilling one’s nature—
Never claiming credit for them.

Such a Sage,
Nearly in harmony with Heaven’s effortless transformation,
Not bound by natural course,
Not desiring to show traces of action.
The **power** of nurturing things,
Brilliant and evident to all,
Is it not because the virtuous do not wish to be seen as virtuous?
This is why Heaven has no limits,
And only the Sage unites Heaven and Earth.

At the beginning of life,
One is purely **yin** or purely **yang**,
Most balanced and upright,
Without victory or defeat, without disparity.
Thus, the sun advances by day, the moon by night,
With tender bones and weak body yet flourishing.
But once life emerges,
Fire dwells above, water below,
Water and fire not mingling—
Hence, **yin** is always excessive,
And **yang** always insufficient.
As **yang** water is scorched by **yin** fire,
Human desires grow ever more,
Vulgar **qi** ever more fervent,
While Heaven’s **true heart** is daily obscured,
And **true qi** gradually fades,
The **mechanism of life** left without trace.

If the excessive **yin** fire were to descend,
Supplementing the insufficient **yang** water;
And once the **yang** water’s insufficiency is mended,
Still restraining the excessive **yin** fire—
Like the archer’s art,
Diminishing the excessive, supplementing the insufficient,
Then **yin** and **yang** are balanced.
This is all through water’s and fire’s own movement,
**Yin** and **yang**’s own interplay,
And Heaven itself does not know who does this.

The **Dao** of humankind is burdened by action,
The **Dao** of Heaven is honored by non-action.
What else is cultivation but this?
To restore the **post-heaven yin and yang** to the **pre-heaven yin and yang**,
Flowing without ceasing,
Achieving effortless spontaneity.

**Chapter LXXVIII: Receive the Filth of the Realm**
Under Heaven, none are as soft and weak as water,
Yet none can overcome the firm and strong as water does.
There is nothing to replace it.

Thus, the soft overcomes the strong,
The weak overcomes the rigid—
All know this, yet few can practice it.
Hence, the Sage says:
*"To receive the filth of the realm,
Is to be its lord of soil and grain.
To bear the realm’s misfortunes,
Is to be its king under Heaven."*

Words that seem reversed.
In the **Supreme Chapter**, it was said that the soft and weak are the followers of life,
The firm and strong are the followers of death—
Thus, the soft and weak occupy the high,
The firm and strong occupy the low,
And it can be known that the utmost softness is the utmost rigidity,
The utmost weakness is the utmost strength.

Daily, nightly, in all things,
The soft and weak are beneficial to all yet do not contend,
Ever in the humble low yet do not weary.
Though but a drop’s worth,
People may scorn it.
Though but a ladle’s measure,
People may slight it.
Yet when it accumulates into the deep,
Gathers into the sea,
Then vast and boundless,
It can bear boats yet also overturn them;
It can nurture things yet also destroy them.
Not only does it overcome all under Heaven,
Even those skilled at attacking the firm and strong—
No firmness remains unbroken,
No strength remains unconquered—
Yet none can stand against it.

Thus, it is known:
The utmost softness under Heaven,
Can govern the utmost rigidity under Heaven;
The utmost weakness under Heaven,
Can repel the utmost strength under Heaven.
Water, water!
How soft and weak it is,
Yet how strong and firm it becomes!

Moreover, under Heaven, there is no task easier than attacking water,
Yet the firm and strong are ultimately unable to prevail.
Why do people not embrace softness while also embracing rigidity,
Not adopt weakness while also adopting strength—
Everywhere it is seen?
Do they not know that softness overcomes rigidity,
That weakness overcomes strength?

It is because Heaven’s **true heart** moves,
Yet none know it,
And once moved,
It is instantly stained by desires,
Deflected by customs—
Thus, they bristle in arrogance,
Unwilling to rest in softness and weakness.
Hence, as cleverness grows,
**Virtue and principle** are lost;
As preferences become fixed,
**True nature** is extinguished.
So that **Dao-heart** departs,
Human desires arise;
**Guest-qi** flourishes,
**True-qi** diminishes.
Life’s **mechanism** gone,
Life’s **mechanism** extinguished—
To make life flourish without end is difficult indeed.

The Sage says, *"To receive the filth of the realm,
Is to be its lord of soil and grain,"*
As **Emperor Tang** of **Shang** spoke:
*"If my person has guilt,
It does not affect the myriad lands;
If the myriad lands have guilt,
The guilt lies upon my person."*

Stepping back is stepping forward—
Thus receiving the Mandate of Heaven from the boundless.

*"To bear the realm’s misfortunes,
Is to become the sovereign of all under Heaven."*
As King Wu declared:
*"I received this victory—
Not because my father, King Wen, had guilt,
But because I, his unworthy son, lacked virtue."*

What follows is what precedes—
Thus bearing Heaven’s blessings without fail.

How could it compare to later ages’
Sleeping on wood, tasting gall,
Enduring filth and accepting defilement?
Such efforts are mere speculation!

This is the eternal, unchanging principle,
The eternal, ungrounded scripture—
The true words for all under Heaven.
Yet the Sage seeks only within himself,
Never demanding such of others.

Water is the metaphor:
When one *yang* first stirs, true essence begins to form.
Its mechanism is most frail,
Its force most yielding.
Yet gradually it gathers, condenses,
Day by day, month by month,
Until it becomes the vast *qi*,
Most great, most strong—
Filling the two poles,
Encompassing all things,
And nothing is firm it cannot penetrate,
Nothing strong it cannot shatter.

*The Awakening to Reality* says:
*"The White Tiger’s Head Scripture is supreme treasure,
The Hua Pool Divine Water Scripture is true scripture.
The highest goodness is like water—
Its source profound, unlike common medicines."*

Though *qi* is soft and weak,
Like water:
Yet in its softness lies inherent strength,
In its weakness lies ultimate power—
It bears the weight of heaven and earth,
Holds up the sun and moon,
Summons wind and rain,
Drives thunder and lightning.
This is the firmest strength under Heaven.

Though called "vast *qi*,"
Its essence is true essence.
It must be nourished with the utmost softness and weakness,
And with *wuwei* as action,
With non-doing as doing—
Only then may one attain it.

When it says,
*"To bear the realm’s filth,
Is to become the lord of soil and grain;
To bear the realm’s misfortunes,
Is to become the sovereign of all under Heaven,"*
It means:
The ancients turned inward to blame themselves,
Saying, *"Truly, I am without virtue—
What guilt could the people have?"*

The scholar who seeks virtue in others—
Why not first cultivate within oneself?

**Chapter Seventy-Nine**
*Constantly do good to others,*
*And great grudges will have lingering grudges—*
How can this be called good?

Thus the Sage holds the left contract,
Yet does not blame others.
Therefore, the virtuous govern contracts,
The unvirtuous govern disputes.

Heaven’s Way has no favorites—
It always sides with the good.
The Way of cultivating oneself:
Only goodness is the treasure.
The Way of doing good:
Self-governance comes first.

For the Way lies within, not without;
Cultivation is in oneself, not in others.
Only by observing inwardly at all times,
Reflecting inwardly at all moments,
Correcting faults when they arise,
And striving harder in goodness—
May one truly manifest goodness in body and mind,
And forever be the perfect child of Heaven and Earth,
The complete Sage,
Without any deficiency.

It is clear that doing good
Only requires self-examination,
Not others’ compliance.
If one blames others but not oneself,
Observes outward but not inward,
Even if one resolves a momentary anger,
And though grudges may be dispersed,
They will not become enemies—
Yet without inward self-reproach,
Without restraining anger and desire,
Though one may resolve it outwardly,
One cannot release it in the hidden depths.
How can one then be pure and unstained,
Free and joyful,
And return to the original, naturally good nature of Heaven and Earth?

Thus, reconciling great grudges will leave lingering grudges—
How can this be called good?

Only the Sage, in conduct and interaction,
Prioritizes self-cultivation,
And does not weigh others’ praise or blame, likes or dislikes.
Like a contract split in two, each party holding one half,
Forever as evidence—
Clear that there is no deceit from me,
No deceit from you.

The Sage holds virtue as he holds the left contract—
Only cultivating within, never blaming others.
This is why he aligns with Heaven and Earth in greatness.

This is called *"the virtuous govern contracts."*
The unvirtuous, however,
Value the external over the internal,
And take scrutiny as clarity,
While weighing others’ grievances and grudges—
This is *"the unvirtuous govern disputes."*

Those who *"govern disputes"*:
Take examining others as their task,
Never reflecting on themselves,
Yet the people do not follow.
How can they compare to those who govern contracts,
Who weigh their own faults heavily,
And others’ lightly—
Yet all trust them in sincerity!

It is clear:
Those who blame others lighten their own burden—
Their goodness cannot be complete.
Those who blame themselves lighten others’ burden—
Their goodness is restored.

When people turn to goodness,
Heaven’s heart favors them—
For countless eons, without fail.

*The Book of Documents* says:
*"Heaven has no favorites—
It aids only virtue."*
Is this not the same as *"The Supreme Way has no favorites—
It always sides with the good"*?

The Sage’s learning:
Only lies in purifying the heart,
Retreating and hiding in secrecy.
For outward goodness or evil,
Praise or blame, compliance or defiance—
All are disregarded.

Thus, filtering thoughts, deepening reflection,
Concentrating spirit, silent illumination—
Until the mind is clear, nature revealed,
Desires purified, principles refined—
Above, aligning with Heaven in virtue,
Enduring through all ages without erosion.

Its practice begins with guarding the center,
Its completion lies in fetal breathing.
Do you understand this inwardly?

The ancients spoke of fetal breathing—
Not to be taken as external breath or *qi*.
When breath is suspended,
The true *yin* and true *yang* in the *dantian*,
The original spirit and original *qi*,
Merge as one, blending into a single *qi*—
Misty and vast, thriving and vigorous,
Opening and closing, appearing and vanishing.
Visible yet unseen, heard yet unheard—
Imagined yet leaving traces,
Faint yet taking form—
This is perhaps the original breath of life.

The heart attains it and has substance,
Nature attains it and has use.
Without this *qi*, life cannot exist.
To become a high-grade immortal,
One cannot do without this *qi* as master.

The ancients said:
*"The beginning of life—
Because of principle, there is *qi*;
Because of *qi*, there is form.
This is the natural order of Heaven and Earth in giving birth to man."*

The practitioner of reverse cultivation indeed slowly stirs the *yang* fire and *yin* talisman from the myriad forms and colors, drawing them back into the Five Bright Palaces. With the primordial *Taiyi* ancestral *qi* and the natural divine fire, one refines them—thus transforming the form into a single *qi*. Further refining this *qi* allows it to condense into spirit.

If one steadfastly guards the void, nurturing the numinous *yang*, without returning to the origin of the *Wuji*, one may then manifest form when emerging and leave no trace when retreating. What difference is there between this and ordinary humanity?

In essence, this prenatal breath is the return to the moment when one’s parents’ mingled *qi* and blood first coalesced. If one cultivates this prenatal breath, day and night with the true intent of making the nonexistent into the existent, the formless into the formed, and the thoughtless into the thoughtful, preserving and gathering it, it will then form a spiritual embryo as the original spirit.

When the ten months have passed and the form is complete, it sheds its shell and ascends through the crown, piercing the heavens, soaring among the *Luanhe* and *Xinghan*, riding the *luan* and *he* cranes, traversing the celestial realms, and ascending to the Jade Capital—all in the blink of an eye.

Yet this prenatal breath, though refined from the mortal’s colored form, is not the ordinary essence, *qi*, or spirit congealed. Though the alchemist cannot do without the postnatal, formed, and colored essence and *qi* as their foundation, they do not rely on them entirely. For postnatal essence and *qi* are all material and substantial, bound by fate—subject to birth and death, the wheel of rebirth inevitable. Moreover, coarse essence and coarse *qi* are all dull and sluggish things—how could they be numinous?

Ultimately, one borrows the crude matter within the mortal’s colored form, refining it through countless forging and purifying processes, extracting that spotless, pure, and supremely numinous essence, *qi*, and spirit to become the true *Yi* breath, returning it to oneself to form the immortal embryo and spiritual elixir. The saying of "extracting lead and adding mercury" is but this.

All else that clings to form and color is not the true Dao.

As the ancients said:
*"The embryo forms from the latent breath,
The breath rests within the embryo."*

Thus, to forge the spiritual elixir and achieve an ageless body, one cannot do without nurturing the prenatal breath. To gather the prenatal breath in the void within the *dantian*, one must first form the embryo—otherwise, it will not return.

If one remains purely still and active in harmony, with not a trace of mundane *qi* mingling or the mundane spirit straying outward, then the spirit will not scatter, and the *qi* will not dissipate—it will not disperse like a child from its mother or a husband from his wife. Do you understand?

**Chapter 80: The Small State with Few People**

A small state with few people—
Let there be ten or a hundred households’ worth of tools, yet unused.
Let the people hold death in reverence and not wander far.
Though they have boats and carriages, they do not ride them.
Though they have armor and weapons, they do not display them.
Let the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.
Let their food be sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyous.
Neighboring states are visible, the sounds of chickens and dogs heard—
Yet the people, from birth to death, do not visit one another.

A small state with few people, remote and sparse—
To become a flourishing, grand realm,
And cultivate the refined customs of antiquity,
Seems indeed difficult.

Yet if one reduces wasteful expenditures,
Trims superfluous formalities,
And lets the tools of ten or a hundred households lie unused,
Then waste diminishes while goods increase—
The wealth of the state can thus be achieved.

Moreover, if one does not indulge desires lightly nor court death through private schemes,
If one does not flee to distant lands or dwell in foreign realms,
But clings only to parents and cherishes siblings,
Holding death in reverence and not wandering far—
Then an era of tranquility, harmony, and kinship can be attained.

Thus, *"Charming is our sovereign, cherishing this land,"*
Though they have boats and carriages,
They do not venture far to strange lands,
Leaving their ancestral homeland.

When the court’s benevolence penetrates deeply,
Soaking into the marrow and flesh,
With affection like that of parents and siblings,
Then even rebellious and stubborn folk
Transform into the virtuous.
Though they have armor and weapons,
They have no need to display them.

Thus, with the ruler serene above and the people joyous below,
The people at ease and the state prosperous—
If one restores the governance of knotted cords,
Enjoys the harmony of the *Taihe*,
Honors kin and elders,
Dwells in proper abodes and tends proper fields,
Finds delight in food and clothing,
And takes joy in settled customs,
With sincerity fostering tradition—
What fear is there that the state is small or the people few,
That it cannot achieve grandeur and abundance,
Or that benevolence cannot prevail?

When the people love their ruler as parents,
And the ruler views them as children,
With loyal hearts and deep affection—
Even a moment’s separation is unbearable.

Though neighboring states are near,
Visible at a glance and their chickens and dogs heard within earshot,
The people, from youth to old age, from birth to death,
Do not once visit one another.

This is because the people, moved by gratitude and transformed by virtue,
Are deeply bound to their ruler.
Thus, they rest in the governance of *Wuwei*,
Enjoy the Dao’s celestial harmony,
And do not dare to stray even a step.

In this way, how could the state fear being small,
Or the people fear being few?

Necessarily, their influence spreads to the four quarters,
Their reputation carried far—
And the world submits to virtue,
All nations aligning in unity.

This is the method for those aged and weakened by declining essence.

When a person grows old,
Their essence and *qi* scatter,
Lead and mercury diminish—
To cultivate the Great Elixir’s Dao seems indeed difficult.

Yet the matter of the Golden Elixir
Is not of postnatal essence and *qi*,
But of the primordial lead and mercury.
If one attains the supreme unity’s method,
Extracting and taking it,
Ingesting and consuming it—
Whether old or young,
One may obtain the medicine in an instant,
Achieving success in a thousand years or three months.

The only misfortune is failing to hear of the primordial *Yi* breath,
And instead relying solely on the postnatal, formed essence—
Not only will the aged achieve nothing,
But even the young and vigorous
Will ultimately gain nothing.

The very first step must be endured with effort—
keeping the hands from straying,
the feet from moving lightly,
the eyes from gazing outward,
the ears from listening to extraneous sounds,
the mouth from speaking,
the mind from idle thoughts—
from dawn till dusk,
cleansing the mind of anxieties,
nurturing the inner while restraining the outer,
retiring into seclusion,
so that not a single thread entangles,
nor the slightest burden lingers.
With time, sincerity and clarity arise naturally—
the gaze turns inward, concentrated;
the tongue’s essence is held within;
the mind remains pure and preserved;
the limbs relax effortlessly,
and every movement aligns with the Dao.

This is the meaning of *"a hundred-bushel vessel unused"*—
then, when used, it lacks nothing.
*"The people"* are likened to the body.

As one grows old,
who does not fear death with utmost dread,
or cherish life with profound longing?
Yet to fear death without seeking life
is merely futile dread.

Only through careful solitude,
constant inward observation,
and ceaseless self-reflection—
never straying from the mind’s core—
will one, over time, attain harmony within.
Then even the heavens and earth may be ordered,
and all things nurtured.
How much more so for what lies within oneself,
yet remains unordered and uncultivated?

This is the way of establishing the Mysterious Transformation,
nurturing the Spirit of the Valley:
enduring like a thread unbroken,
using it without strain;
ever-present like the waking mind,
guarding it without failure;
still yet ever luminous,
luminous yet ever still—
*(that is, ever responsive yet ever tranquil,
without force or artifice).*

This is what is meant by
*"moving yet unrestrained, still yet perfectly nourished."*

It does not involve the alchemical furnace’s revolutions,
nor the celestial stem-and-branch’s shifts.
Nor does it require
suppressing chaos with martial might—
though warfare may befit the field,
defense suits the city,
and ritual purity is paramount—
taking analogy from the alchemist’s fire,
the strategist’s victory over foes.

This is the method of pure cultivation,
not the craft of yin-yang supplementation.
Not only can the aged, through practice,
obtain the elixir and return to youth,
but even the young,
if they adhere to this discipline,
may persist unceasingly, without division or pause,
harmonizing with the serene and reverent Heaven.

Yet hasty progress yields no swift results,
and impatience begets no great attainment.
Only through slow, leisurely cultivation—
like water’s gradual seepage,
fire’s steady permeation—
will virtue mature and benevolence ripen,
and the Dao be fulfilled.

Thus:
*"Though there be chariots and armor,
there is no use for them;
Though there be arms and troops,
there is no place to deploy them."*

The movements of advance and retreat, ascent and descent—
the methods of morning *tūn* and evening *méng*—
the Supreme Sage has already spoken of them:
*"War is the last resort; it will surely bring years of calamity."*

This shows that the alchemical practice of refining at the furnace,
gathering elixir through fire,
is a method established for those whose post-natal *qi*
is bound and obstructed by material entanglements—
if one does not follow this path,
then common *qi* cannot transform,
and true gold cannot be restored.

If one can make stillness and nourishment their practice,
without resorting to the arts of boiling and frying,
merely abiding within the void and the tranquil,
then unknowingly and unawares,
without action or thought,
one naturally becomes whole and undivided,
pure and upright,
silently harmonizing with Heaven,
not awaiting words or deliberation,
yet flowing seamlessly with Heaven and Earth.

This is the method of *"making the people return to using knotted cords while governing them."*
No reliance on script or spoken exposition,
yet *"the Sage above does not need calculations or plans."*
*"Let them enjoy their food and adorn their clothing,"*
meaning their essence permeates within,
their *qi* circulates without.
Sweetness within and beauty without—
there is that which cannot be named or spoken of.

*"Let them dwell in peace, delight in their customs,"*
then their hearts are settled in virtue and benevolence,
and wherever they go,
all is fitting.

When cultivation reaches this stage,
clarity is ever-present,
suchness is effortless,
one can meet all things with no mind—
how could they be stained by external objects?
Even when there are sights and sounds,
they are as if unseen and unheard,
never stirred by color or sound.

Thus it is said:
*"Neighboring lands may gaze upon each other,
yet they do not visit or communicate."*

This is the supreme and highest attainment,
the lowest and lowest is nonexistent—
the profoundest of profundities,
the most wondrous of wonders.
Ah!

When cultivation reaches this stage, one finds great harmony with the Dao.

Speaking of Daoist practice, there have been two ancient methods: those who cultivate through purity, and those who cultivate through yin-yang supplementation.

Cultivation through purity means refining the void and unity—no need to refine essence or *qi*. Yet this is not for the ordinary practitioner; only those of the highest root and capacity can speak of it. If one’s innate nature is truly extraordinary, proceeding from this step onward follows the natural Way of Heaven and Earth, unlike the teachings of my master today, which still involve contrivance.

Within the human body, there exist the mechanisms of yin-yang (坎 *kǎn* and 离 *lí*), the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth (乾 *qián* and 坤 *kūn*), the movements of sun and moon, water and fire, ascent and descent, advance and retreat—just as the heavens move in their courses, all naturally, without need of artificial manipulation. One need only rectify the original spirit, letting it act without thought or deliberation, without striving or planning. Then, the pure and empty *qi* flows boundlessly, naturally inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling like the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth, the coming and going of sun and moon, the ascent of water and descent of fire, the ebb and flow of yin and yang—advancing and retreating thusly.

Though there are stages of fire and heat, they amount to nothing more than calming the mind, reducing desires, and maintaining inner stillness, allowing true *qi* to circulate without ceasing. Though there are movements of ascent and descent, they are merely the constant rising of true water and the constant descending of true fire. Even in the practice of Daoist bathing, it is only a matter of restraining anger, suppressing desires, purifying thoughts, and washing the heart, so that the Great Harmony may be embraced.

Though there are elixirs and pills, they are but this: taking spirit as father and *qi* as mother, the two entwined into one, merging without separation, giving birth to that primordial point of true soul—what is called the true essence of the Palace of Separation (離宮), or the true mercury of the human body. By refining one’s spirit-*qi* into this true mercury, a fetus is formed, and later, a sun-body emerges—organs, bones, blood vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, hair, flesh, and all awareness, none of which differ from the human form. Divided, it can manifest as myriad bodies; united, it returns to one *qi*. All stems from the union of spirit-father and *qi*-mother, their fusion producing this true mercury’s essence, which becomes the sun-body.

Yet this true mercury requires the condition of birth. The heart governs the *qi* of the five viscera; when the central *qi* ascends, the *qi* of the five viscera ascends with it; when the central *qi* descends, the *qi* of the five viscera descends with it. Its motion arises from the movement of true mercury; its stillness arises from its repose. In short, motion and stillness, ascent and descent—all belong to the natural Way, and one must only follow its natural operation.

Yet few ancient immortals began their practice from this step. What is meant by yin-yang supplementation?

First, one must recognize the foundation of the Supreme Ultimate (太極), the emergence of primordial yang, and then invest this point of true yang-*qi* into the dantian, just as parents unite—precision and blood merging into one within the womb. This is the primordial true seed, planted in the Palace of Mutual Sensation (交感宮), where lead and mercury are daily refined, gradually growing until, one day, it emerges from the shell, and the immortal of the naked embryo is born. Without this true seed, one’s practice is empty. Though there may be gains, they will only preserve the physical form and cannot produce the transcendent body.

Do you understand? With this point of true yang-*qi* planted in the womb, one may then apply the illumination of spirit-light, and over time, the true yang will stir. It is permissible to draw the water of *kǎn* upward and guide the fire of *lí* downward, refining all the turbid yin-dregs and corpse-*qi* of the physical body, extracting only the pure *qi*, blending it with the soul-yang, and forming it into an elixir to nourish the spirit—thus achieving flight and transformation. Yet even this is the natural Way.

Ordinary people, having fallen into the post-heavenly realm, have depleted their spirit and *qi*, and their years have aged them. Like travelers far from home, they must return from afar, and thus must exert effort.

Since spirit and *qi* are divided and not yet unified, during seated practice, one must use a portion of intention and *qi* to gather them both into the dantian, ensuring not a single thread escapes outward, not a breath leaves or enters. One need only follow the rhythm of inhalation and exhalation—from one to ten, from ten to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand, to ten thousand—without constraint. Then, having tightly sealed the great gate, one stores the spirit at the dantian’s bolt, practicing thus for a while, before halting external breath and allowing true breath to move. One then nourishes it again, and soon the true yang-*qi* surges forth like a gale or billowing clouds. Quickly, one opens the pass and guides it upward.

In its ascent, one relies on spirit, not *qi*—only concentrating the spirit at the tailbone’s end is sufficient. When the true *qi* rushes forth, one nourishes it for a moment before descending. In summary, when true yang first stirs, one must exert some effort before ascent or descent becomes possible. For the vulgar body’s turbid *qi* is too heavy, and it must be vigorously agitated to dispel its filth, revealing the pure and clear spirit-*qi* that will serve as the foundation for the elixir. Hence the ancients said: At first, one gathers the medicine, but without fierce, martial fire and urgent refining, true gold cannot be extracted from the ore—this is why martial fire is called "wild battle."

Once ascent and descent are complete, when the dantian is full and the heart and spirit are at ease, one may then employ the method of refining the void, following the *qi*’s natural movements to complete the work.

「This is indeed a strenuous effort, yet it is the natural way of things. One must follow this path in practice.

**Chapter Eighty-One: Acting Without Striving**
*"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true."*
*"The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous."*
*"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise."*
*"The sage does not hoard.*

When one acts for others, the more one gives, the more one possesses.
When one gives to others, the more one shares, the more one’s virtue grows.
The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;
The Dao of the sage acts without striving.

This chapter concludes the entire text, showing that all sayings of the *Dàodé Jīng* are sincere and without deceit. One must not dismiss this scripture as unpolished in language and shelve it without discussion or reflection.

Know that the Dao has no name—it is only called *Dao* by force.
The Dao has no words—all words are obstructions.
Yet, to teach and transform beings, one must establish provisional names,
as a bridge for later learners.

Once words are spoken, they must come from the heart,
and their expression must be measured and true.
This is indeed a profound and genuine discourse,
harmonizing with the ancient yet never erroneous,
conforming to the present yet universally applicable.
Without embellishment or falsehood,
it requires no ornate rhetoric—what need for excessive complexity?
Simple transmission and direct pointing reveal the very nature of *xìngtiān* [性天, inherent nature of Heaven].

True words need not be beautiful.
If one speaks of ornate literature and elegant prose,
that is the speech of scholars and literati,
who adorn themselves with superficial brilliance to please the world—
such words are not to be trusted.

If their words are true yet virtuous, and they do not seek to deceive through contrivance,
what need for argumentation?
Those who argue are like the deaf and blind,
pretending to hear and see to fit in with others,
covering their ears while stealing the bell—
such behavior is not virtuous.

Virtue lies within oneself; wisdom lies within one’s heart—
why must it be excessive?
Confucius said, *"My Way is one, and it runs through all things."*
Mencius said, *"The Way is one and only one."*
What need for vast learning?

Those who seek vastness are like those who do not grasp the essence of the Dao,
whose words lack proper foundation.
They wander through the teachings of a hundred schools,
mastering only the recitation of phrases and literary flourishes—
this is not the sage’s learning, which is profound and guided by the utmost harmony and rectitude.

In truth, the Dao is such that nothing exists outside of it.
It can be taken without restriction,
used without exhaustion.

The sage is empty yet not empty,
has yet not has.
Like a clear mirror suspended high,
reflecting all without storing any—
how can there be accumulation?

If there were accumulation,
then the mirror would bear the stains of dust,
the water would be tainted by sand—
this is not the empty, luminous essence of the sage,
which is vast and impartial.

Only when the sage’s nature is thus empty and luminous,
does he respond to circumstances and follow the *yuan* [缘, conditions],
though the myriad people may be in chaos,
virtue cannot be universally applied—
yet even one person wronged will be held as a burden of guilt,
and his heart will always ache.

If the entire realm remains untouched by benevolence,
his heart will bear constant pain.
In giving to others, what need for excessive restraint?
Thus it is said:
When one acts for others, his own merit increases;
When one gives to others, his own virtue grows.

It is like the light of a mirror—
when objects come, they are reflected;
when objects depart, the reflection ceases—
there is no premeditation in between.

The sage’s heart is thus:
The sage’s heart is Heaven’s heart;
The sage’s Dao is Heaven’s Dao.

Heaven acts through silent transformation,
though there may be waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness—
all belong to the mechanism of nurturing life,
benefiting without harming.

The sage creates through effortless spontaneity,
though there may be loss and gain, granting and taking—
all belong to the response of benevolence,
also acting without striving.

If Heaven and Earth were to benefit or harm,
then Heaven and Earth would also be partial and not impartial—
how could they endure for ten thousand years unchanged?

If the sage were to act with striving or contention,
then the sage would also hoard without dispersing—
how could his utmost sincerity persist without end?

Alas!
Heaven and Earth are vast;
The sage is vast.
Though there are true words,
they arise from the heart’s intent—
no borrowing, no pretense.

Based on self and verified by the common people,
it is the innate virtue of Heaven,
the shared essence of human hearts.

To act for others is to act for oneself;
To give to others is to give to oneself.
This is the unity of self and other,
the oneness of Heaven and humanity—
here lies the sage’s harmony with Heaven, revealed in his breadth.

This commentary concludes.
The teacher then calls his disciples and tells them:
*"The Great Dao today is as precarious as a pile of eggs.
It depends on you, those who study the Dao,
to uphold Heaven and Earth,
and rectify the balance of *qiánkūn* [乾坤, the cosmos].

Even if you speak of wicked and rebellious men,
there may be conflict with arms—
yet Heaven has its arrangements,
and it will never leave you with unforeseen calamity.

Only fear that you may hold virtue too narrowly,
trust the Dao too lightly,
waver in resolve—
sometimes acting, sometimes abandoning it—
thus severing your connection with Heaven.

Unable to align above with Heaven,
even if Heaven has tenfold benevolence,
desiring to nurture you in a realm of rest and tranquility,
how can you receive Heaven’s grace if you cannot embrace it?

You have now seen the Dao clearly,
grasped its essence with strength—
your own foundation is firm.
Only in each word and action,
breath by breath, must you remain in harmony with Heaven—
then Heaven will cherish you,
protect you, and never forsake you.

For the Dao is Heaven, and to honor the Dao is to honor Heaven;
To love the Dao is to love Heaven.

Such silent accord and profound trust
will naturally lead to auspicious blessings.
Heaven’s Dao is originally one with humanity’s Dao—
examine the ancients and the moderns:
There have been none who defied the Dao and escaped Heaven’s disdain,
nor any who followed the Dao and failed to receive Heaven’s favor.
You may now awaken to this truth.

In summary, each must follow what is right,
exhaust what is sincere—
as for external judgments of right and wrong, misfortune and blessing,
all are governed by Heaven’s will.
You must not fret over taking another’s place—
leave such concerns to Heaven."*

The essence of the Great Dao lies solely in the two aspects of **shen** (神) and **qi** (氣)—
yet there is a distinction between **pre-Heaven** (先天) and **post-Heaven** (後天).
Cultivators must never fail to grasp this.

The ancient scriptures state:
Pre-Heaven **yuan shen** (元神), the body;
Post-Heaven **shi shen** (識神), the function.
Without pre-Heaven **yuan shen**, the Great Dao has no master;
Without post-Heaven **shi shen**, the Great Dao has no use.

You must diligently refine your practice—
when in the **hunhun dun dun** (混混沌沌, profound chaos),
the state of **wuzhi wujue** (無知無覺, no awareness),
nurture the pre-Heaven **yuan shen** to rule as sovereign.
Then, with a sudden start and awakening,
the post-Heaven **shi shen** emerges.

This **shi shen** is not the fleeting, wandering thoughts of your ordinary mind,
but the **zhengdeng zhengjue** (正等正覺, true and pure awakened spirit),
which, when activated, brings forth knowledge—
thus it is called **shi shen**.

Yet once this **shi shen** arises,
it may swirl with chaotic, deluded thoughts,
endless distractions and desires—
and you shall fall into private streams and sensual cravings,
unable to forge the Elixir.

Only when the mind is **yīxīn liǎozhào** (一心了照, singularly illuminated)
and steadfastly resolves to nothing else—
when the will is unscattered,
and the spirit is condensed—
then breath may be regulated,
and the Elixir will form.

Hence it is said:
*"The mind fixed solely on the silken thread,
no sight of white reeds or red banks beyond.*
Even though called **shi shen**,
its essence is the pre-Heaven **yuan shen**."

Thus the ancients proclaimed:
*"Heaven’s heart is the master, the **yuan shen** the function.
Skillfully employ the thief’s trick,
and return to the workings of Creation."*
What need then to fear failing to ascend to the sacred?

You must also understand this, surely.
When Heaven’s heart stirs,
constantly stabilize and contain it—
no wandering thought,
no breath of impurity—
so that Heaven’s heart remains,
and the Dao-heart is ever condensed.
Even with **shi shen**, it is as though without.

For those who seek **true cultivation** (修真),
at the very outset,
the precious task is to subdue the **mang zhì** (妄識, deluded perceptions)
of the two eyes, ears, mouth, body, and mind.
Then gather the spirit at the **Dan xióng** (丹扃, Elixir Gate),
regulate the breath at the **Dan tián** (丹田, Elixir Field),
and ensure that all ordinary breaths are extinguished—
only then does the **yuan qì** (元氣, Original Qi) begin to return in submission.

Once the **yuan qì** has gathered,
**yīnyīn huópó** (氤氳活泼, vibrant and lively),
**wǎnzhuǎn yōuyáng** (宛转悠扬, gently undulating),
like a living dragon in motion,
fully invigorated—
this **yuan qì**’s vigor
can drive the **Hé chē** (河车, River Vehicle).

Yet if the **qi jī** (氣機, Qi mechanism) is too violently stirred,
and the **Hé chē**’s work of **huà jīng wéi qì** (化精為氣, transforming essence into Qi)
and **huà qì wéi shén** (化氣為神, transforming Qi into spirit)
is not properly condensed at the **Dan dǐng** (丹鼎, Elixir Cauldron),
then the unrefined **yīn jīng** (陰精, yin essence) cannot be fixed,
and will not long remain in the post-Heaven **Dan dǐng**.
At the slightest provocation of ordinary fire,
it will stir the **yín gēn** (淫根, lustful roots),
and spawn **yín shì** (淫事, lustful deeds)—
and all will be lost.

Even if you forcefully suppress it,
not letting it move—
yet the post-Heaven **qì jīng** (精氣, essence and Qi)
are all of pure **yīn** (陰),
unrefined, and without constraint,
they must leak—
even if constrained, they must leak.

With this method alone,
you can **duó tiān dì guǐ shén zhī quán** (奪天地鬼神之權, seize the authority of Heaven, Earth, and spirits),
and participate in the **zào huà yīn yáng zhī fǎ** (造化陰陽之法, principles of Creation’s yin and yang),
to **zì zhǔ zì duó** (自主自奪, command and restrain yourself):
*"My life is mine alone—
not Heaven’s to control."*
Truly, you become an **immortal of eternal youth** (長生不老之仙),
the very **Yánluó lǎozi** (閻羅老子, Lord Yama) himself
has no power over you.

Thus the method must not be revealed to the unworthy,
lest Heaven’s spirits lose their authority over **shàn è bào yìng** (善惡報應, reward and retribution).

You, who know the Dao,
must surely grasp its meaning.
Tightly seal your lips and tongue,
do not recklessly spill Heaven’s secrets,
its hidden keys.

Once the **yuan qì** has gathered in the **Dan tián**,
and you practice the **Hé chē** method,
you must further rely on post-Heaven ordinary **qì** (氣) as **yáng huǒ yīn fú** (陽火陰符, yang fire and yin talisman),
urging and prompting it—
making it rise and fall, come and go without end,
stirring and refining it,
so that it transforms the ordinary into the true,
its changes unfathomable.

Though the **yuan qì** of the Elixir is rooted in pre-Heaven **yuan qì**,
post-Heaven ordinary **qì** is still indispensable for its function.

As for the Elixir itself,
its success depends entirely on the **huǒ hòu** (火候, fire timing).
The ancients, standing before the furnace,
were supremely cautious—
lest even a slight deviation in breath
disturb the **zào huà yīn yáng** (造化陰陽, workings of Creation’s yin and yang).

Thus it is said:
*"Advancing fire and employing talismans
is like cooking rice—
too gentle, and it remains raw;
too hasty, and it burns.
Hence the value of **chāngchāng** (惺惺, alertness) ever present,
and **miánmián** (綿綿, gradual continuity) without cease."*

From these two phrases,
you may discern the subtleties of fire use.

When the **ground thunder rumbles** (地下雷鳴),
and the fire presses the **jin** (金, metal),
at that moment, if not for **wǔ huǒ** (武火, martial fire),
how could the **jin qì** (金氣, metal Qi) ascend?

Yet martial fire must be wielded skillfully—
let its flames surge ten thousand feet,
its radiance shoot in all directions,
but I shall douse it with a single drop of cool water,
spread across the ten directions—
this is the **qi zhàng ér xīn xiǎng** (氣壯而心享之道, power of Qi and the joy of the heart),
the **qīngjìng tiándàn** (清净恬淡為本之妙術, wondrous art of purity and tranquility).

Hence it is said:
*"Dragon and tiger meet on the battlefield—
in a flash, their fate is sealed.
I urge you: when evil arises, act with virtue,
For strength gained through contention brings only harm."*

Indeed, the power is to be feared,
the moment is perilous—
yet the heart must never falter in its vigilance before the furnace.

Once you grasp this meaning,
you will never again face the threat of collapse.

Still, the **Hé chē** method must be practiced as such.
If applied indiscriminately to **shǒu zhōng** (守中, Central Retention),
before the **qi jī** is fully open,
and the heart-spirit is at peace—
if you simply follow the **zìrán** (自然, natural) method—
how can the spirit and Qi merge into one,
or any **yào wù** (藥物, medicinal substance) be gathered?

This must be done
when the **Xuān guān** (玄關, Mysterious Gate) first appears—
**shèn qì** (腎氣, kidney Qi) ascending,
**xīn yè** (心液, heart fluid) descending—
using the **shù qì** (數息, breath-counting) martial fire,
no thought allowed to stray,
no breath to rush.

Thus, with slow and steady urging,
stimulating the **tǔolì jīguān** (橐龠機關, bellows mechanism),
only then do ordinary breaths cease,
and **true breaths** (真息) emerge,
the human heart die,
and the Dao-heart live.

Else, let alone speak of *zìrán* (naturalness),
there will be no *zìrán* at all.

Hence it is said:
Even the *shēng zhī* (生知, innate-knowing sage)
must still descend to *xià kùn zhī* (下困知, acquired knowledge through hardship),
and only through diligent practice can mastery be attained.

The ancients spoke:
*"The Western Mountain’s White Tiger rages unchecked,
The Eastern Sea’s Green Dragon cannot be withstood.
With both hands seized, they battle to the death—
Forged into a single mass of purple gold frost."*

Again it is said:
*"To subdue the Dragon, one’s will must be as vast as heaven,
To tame the Tiger, one’s spirit must be fierce as smoke.
Even the dullest fool who grasps this truth—
Shall surely become a transcendent sage upon the earth."*

This *wǔhuǒ* (武火, martial fire) method
may be applied when the Dragon and Tiger do not yet meet,
when Water and Fire have not yet harmonized—
but if practicing the *hé chē* (河车, River Vehicle),
when already the Dragon roars and the Tiger howls,
when yin and yang respond in perfect accord,
to still employ this method here
would only risk driving the true *qi* into chaos and dispersion.
Mencius warned:
*"Like chasing a released pig—*
*once it has entered the thicket,*
*to then call it back is a grave mistake."*

I shall now reveal the complete technique—
you must strive with all your might to cultivate it,
to fulfill the hopes of your teacher.

**Do not recklessly disclose this—**
lest you invite calamity upon yourself.
