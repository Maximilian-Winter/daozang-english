# 庄子

In the first chapter of the first scroll of *Zhuangzi* (*The Scripture of Southern Florescence*), "Free and Easy Wandering":

In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, and its name is Kun. The size of the Kun—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, and its name is Peng. The back of the Peng—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. When it rouses itself and takes flight, its wings are like clouds draped across the sky. This bird, when the seas surge, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.

*Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. Its words say: "When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, the waters churn for three thousand *li*. It mounts the whirlwind and ascends ninety thousand *li*, borne on the winds of a six-month exhalation." The wild galloping of vapors, the drifting of dust motes—these are living things blown about by each other’s breath.

Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it because it stretches so far that nothing marks its end? When the Peng looks down, it sees only the same.

Moreover, if water does not accumulate to sufficient depth, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor, and a mustard seed becomes a boat; set a cup there, and it sticks fast—too shallow the water, too great the vessel. If wind does not accumulate to sufficient depth, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath it, and only then can it ride the gale. With the azure sky at its back and nothing to obstruct its path, only then does it set its course for the south.

The cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: "We burst forth and fly, darting to the elm or sandalwood, and when we cannot reach, we simply alight upon the ground—what need have we to ascend ninety thousand *li* and journey south?"

One who travels to the near wilds brings three meals and returns with belly still full. One who travels a hundred *li* must pound grain for the night’s provisions.

One who travels a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. What do these two creatures know? Lesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge; short years do not reach long years. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not dawn nor dusk; the cicada knows not spring nor autumn—these are short years. South of Chu lies the *Mingling* tree, for which five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the great *Chun* tree, for which eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn—these are long years. Yet Pengzu alone is famed for his longevity; for common folk to compare themselves to him—is this not lamentable?

This is what Tang asked Ji about. In the dark northern sea of the barren lands, there is a heavenly pool. There is a fish there, several thousand *li* in breadth, whose length none knows—its name is Kun. There is a bird there, its name Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It wheels upon the whirlwind, rising ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds, bearing the azure sky on its back, then sets its course south, bound for the southern darkness.

The marsh pipit laughs at it, saying: "Where does it think it’s going? I leap and soar, rising no more than a few fathoms before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the perfection of flight! Where does it think it’s going?" This is the distinction between small and great.

Thus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct is matched in one village, whose virtue pleases one lord, or whose merit is proven in one state—such men regard themselves as the marsh pipit does. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. When the whole world praises him, he is not spurred on; when the whole world blames him, he is not disheartened. He has settled the division between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace—this is all. In his dealings with the world, he is not eager. Even so, he has yet to plant his roots.

Liezi rides the wind and travels, lightly and well, returning after fifteen days. In his pursuit of fortune, he is not eager. Though he avoids walking, he still depends on something. But if one were to ride the constancy of Heaven and Earth, harness the transformations of the six qi, and wander through the boundless—what would he depend on? Thus it is said: the Perfect Man has no self, the Spirit Man has no merit, the Sage has no name.

Yao offered the world to Xu You, saying: "When the sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to be seen? When the rain has fallen, yet one still waters the fields—is this not labor in vain? You stand, and the world is ordered; yet I still occupy the throne—I see myself as lacking. Take the world."

Xu You replied: "You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. Yet I would still replace you—would I do so for a name? A name is but the guest of reality; would I be a guest?"

The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than fills its belly. Go home, my lord—I have no use for the world!

Though the cook neglects his kitchen, the invocator at the altar would not leap over the wine vessels and sacrificial stands to take his place.

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: "I heard words from Jie Yu that were vast but without measure, sweeping onward without return. I was startled and terrified by them—they were as boundless as the Milky Way, wildly divergent, far from human sensibilities."

Lian Shu said: "What did he say?"

Jian Wu replied: "On distant Mount Gushe, a spirit-man dwells. His skin is like ice and snow, his grace like a maiden’s. He eats no five grains, but drinks the wind and sips the dew. He rides the clouds and qi, drives dragons, and wanders beyond the four seas. His spirit is so concentrated that he keeps things free from blight and ensures the harvest ripens. Yet I deem this madness and do not believe it."

Lian Shu said: "Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the sight of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that can be deaf and blind? The understanding, too, may suffer the same."

Such words of his are but the prattling of a child. That man, that power of his—it would sweep across the ten thousand things, uniting them as one, while the world yearns for order. Who would wear themselves out taking the world as their task!

That man—nothing harms him. Though the great floods rise to the heavens, he does not drown; though great drought melts metal and stone, scorches earth and mountains, he does not burn. From his dust and chaff, one could mold a Yao or Shun—who would trouble themselves with mere things!

The men of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, yet the people of Yue cut their hair short and tattoo their bodies, having no use for them. Yao governed the people of the world and brought order to the lands within the seas. Yet when he went to see the Four Masters on distant Mount Gushe, north of the Fen River, he was so profoundly moved that he forgot his rule over the world.

Hui Zi said to Zhuangzi: "The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to bear fruit of five *shi*. When I used it to hold water, its strength was not enough to support itself. When I split it to make a ladle, its size was so vast it could hold nothing. It was not that it was not resoundingly large—I deemed it useless and smashed it."

Zhuangzi said: "You are indeed clumsy in putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an ointment that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family had made their living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of this and offered to buy the formula for a hundred gold pieces. The family gathered and deliberated: 'For generations, we have washed silk floss and earned no more than a few gold pieces. Now, in a single morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred gold pieces—let us give it to him.'

The traveler obtained it and used it to persuade the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu sent him to lead the troops. In the winter, they fought a naval battle with Yue, and he utterly defeated the Yue forces, winning a fiefdom as his reward. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same, yet one man gained a fiefdom, while another could not escape washing silk floss—such is the difference in how it was used.

Now you have a gourd of five *shi*—why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes, instead of fretting that it is too large to hold anything? Truly, your mind is still as tangled as a clump of weeds!"

Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi: "I have a great tree, which people call the *chu*. Its massive trunk is gnarled and does not meet the carpenter’s line, its slender branches are twisted and do not conform to compass or square. Planted by the roadside, no craftsman even glances at it. Now, your words are grand but of no use—just as the multitude discards them."

Zhuangzi replied: "Have you alone never seen the wildcat or weasel? Crouching low to lie in wait, it pounces on its prey; leaping east and west, it spares neither high nor low. Yet it falls into the trap or snare and dies. Now consider the yak: its size is like a cloud hanging in the sky. This creature is great indeed, yet it cannot catch a mouse. You have a great tree and fret that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothing-Whatever, the vast and boundless wilds? Wander idly by its side, roam freely beneath its shade. Never felled by axe, unharmed by any thing, without use—where is the hardship in that?"

South Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest, gazed upward, and sighed, his response so absent it seemed he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood attending before him and asked: "What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes? Yet the one who now leans against the armrest—is he not the same who once leaned before?"

Ziqi replied: "Yan, is it not well that you ask? Today I have lost my self—do you understand? You have heard the human *lai*, but not the earthly *lai*; you have heard the earthly *lai*, but not the heavenly *lai*!"

Ziyou said: "I venture to ask the method."

Ziqi said: "The great clod exhales its *qi*, and this is called wind. It does nothing of itself, but when it arises, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone not heard its long, sighing sound? The towering forests and jagged cliffs, the great trees with hollows a hundred spans around—some like noses, some like mouths, some like ears, some like beams, some like rings, some like mortars, some like pools, some like pits; they hiss, they shriek, they bellow, they gasp, they cry, they wail, they moan, they gnash. The first sings *yu*, and the rest sing in chorus. A gentle breeze brings a small harmony; a whirlwind brings a great harmony. When the wind subsides, all hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen them tremble and quiver?"

Ziyou said: "The earthly *lai* is simply the sound of the myriad hollows; the human *lai* is but the sound of bamboo flutes. I venture to ask about the heavenly *lai*."

Ziqi said: "When the wind blows, the myriad sounds differ, yet each ceases of itself. Who is it that stirs them to fury?"

The great knowledge is broad and unhurried, the petty knowledge is narrow and fussy; the grand words blaze forth, the small words chatter on. In sleep, their spirits intertwine; in waking, their forms unfold. They engage in contention, daily battling with their hearts. Some are entangled, some are trapped, some are secretive. Small fears leave them trembling, great fears leave them dazed. Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow’s trigger—this is what it means to judge right and wrong; their persistence is like a sworn oath—this is what it means to cling to victory. Their decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decay; their immersion in such ways cannot be reversed. Their stifling is like a sealed casket, speaking of their utter stagnation. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, anxiety and sighs, fickleness and dread, caprice and indulgence, frivolity and affectation—pleasure arises from emptiness, steam gives rise to mushrooms. Day and night they alternate before us, yet none know where they sprout. Enough, enough! Morning and evening we attain this—is this not the very source from which life arises? Without that, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to grasp. This is close indeed, yet one knows not what moves it. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. It can act and be trusted, yet its form is unseen—it has essence but no form. The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera all exist in completeness, but with whom should I feel kinship? Do you delight in all of them? Or do they have their favorites?

Are all these but servants and handmaids? Are servants and handmaids insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and subject? Or is there a true lord that abides? Whether one seeks and attains its truth or fails to do so, it neither adds to nor detracts from its reality. Once receiving this completed form, one does not perish until its end. Engaging with things, they grind and wear against one another—one’s conduct races to its end like a galloping steed, yet none can halt it. Is this not lamentable? A lifetime spent toiling without seeing success, wearily exhausted yet unaware of one’s destination—how can this not be sorrowful? People call it "not dying," but what benefit is there? The body transforms, and the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow? Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone in my confusion, or are there others who are not?

Those who follow their settled minds as teachers—who is without a teacher? Why must one know the succession of ages to have a mind that grasps itself? Even fools possess this! When the mind is formed and there is right and wrong, it is like arriving in Yue today yet having reached it yesterday. Thus, one takes what does not exist to be existent. Taking what does not exist to be existent, even the divine Yu would be at a loss—what can I alone do?

Words are not the wind’s breath; speakers have their say. Yet what they say remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? If one deems it distinct from the chirping of fledglings, is there still distinction? Or is there none? Where does the Dao hide that it has truth and falsehood? Where does speech hide that it has right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it ceases to exist? Where does speech abide that it cannot be affirmed? The Dao is obscured by petty achievements; speech is obscured by florid ornamentation. Hence, there are the Confucians’ and Mohists’ disputes over right and wrong, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. To affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm, nothing surpasses clarity.

Nothing exists that is not "that"; nothing exists that is not "this." From "that," one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: "That emerges from this, and this likewise depends on that." This is the theory of simultaneous arising. Yet even as things arise, they die; as they die, they arise. Even as they are affirmed, they are denied; as they are denied, they are affirmed. Affirming this and denying that, denying this and affirming that—therefore, the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates all by the light of Heaven. This, too, is "that," and "that," too, is "this." "That" has its right and wrong, and "this" has its right and wrong. Is there truly a "that" and a "this"? Or is there truly neither "that" nor "this"? Where "that" and "this" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the circle, it responds endlessly. "This" is endless, and "not-this" is likewise endless. Thus, it is said: nothing surpasses clarity.

To use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and Earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.

What can be affirmed is affirmed; what cannot be affirmed cannot be affirmed. The Dao is realized through action; things are so called by convention. Why are they so? They are so because they are so. Why are they not so? They are not so because they are not so. Things inherently have what they affirm and what they accept. Nothing is not so; nothing is unacceptable. Therefore, whether one takes a stalk or a pillar, a leper or Xi Shi, the grotesque, the strange, the deceptive, and the bizarre—the Dao unites them all as one. In their division, they are completed; in their completion, they are destroyed. All things are neither completed nor destroyed, but return to unity.

Only the enlightened know this unity and, for this reason, do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary. The ordinary is function; function is passage; passage is attainment. Attaining this, one is nearly there. Following this, though unaware of how it is so, is called the Dao. To exhaust one’s spirit and intelligence in unifying things yet remain unaware of their sameness is called "Morning Three." What is "Morning Three"? It is said: "The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, 'Three in the morning and four at dusk.' The monkeys were all enraged. He then said, 'Then four in the morning and three at dusk.' The monkeys were all pleased." Names and realities were diminished, yet joy and anger were employed—this, too, follows from this. Therefore, the sage harmonizes right and wrong and rests in the evenness of Heaven. This is called walking two paths.

The knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost. Where did it reach?

There are those who hold that things have never yet begun to exist—this is the utmost, the exhaustion of all, beyond which nothing can be added! Next are those who hold that things exist, yet boundaries have never yet arisen. Next are those who hold that boundaries exist, yet right and wrong have never yet appeared. When right and wrong become manifest, the Dao suffers loss. The Dao suffers loss, and attachment takes form. Is there truly gain and loss? Or is there truly neither gain nor loss? If there is gain and loss, then Master Zhao’s zither-playing exists; if there is neither gain nor loss, then Master Zhao’s zither-playing does not exist. Master Zhao’s zither-playing, Kuang’s wielding of the staff, and Master Hui’s leaning against the catalpa tree—these three men’s knowledge nearly reached perfection, each in their own excellence, and so their deeds are recorded at life’s end. Yet because they were fond of something, they differed from others; because they were fond of it, they sought to make it clear. But what they sought to clarify was not what could be clarified, and so they ended in the obscurity of "hard and white." And Master Zhao’s son ended with the threads of his father’s art, yet accomplished nothing his whole life. If this can be called accomplishment, then even I have accomplished something. If this cannot be called accomplishment, then neither things nor I have accomplished anything. Thus, the dazzling confusion of slippery doubt is what the sage despises. Instead of employing such things, one lodges them in the ordinary—this is called "illuminating through non-illumination."

Now, let me say something here: is it of the same kind as this, or not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, all things are of the same kind, and so there is no difference from that. Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. There is a beginning; there is a time before that beginning; there is a time before the time before that beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is a time before non-being; there is a time before the time before non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—truly is. Now I have already spoken, yet I do not know whether what I have spoken truly speaks of something or truly speaks of nothing.

In all the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; no one lives longer than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu died prematurely. Heaven and Earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there still be speech? Since I have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. From this point onward, even the most skillful reckoner cannot reach the end—how much less can ordinary people! Therefore, from non-being to being, we reach three—how much more if we proceed from being to being! Do not proceed; abide in this!

The Dao has never had boundaries; words have never had constancy. Yet because of this, distinctions arise. Let me speak of these distinctions: there is left, there is right; there are ranks, there are duties; there are divisions, there are debates; there is competition, there is contention—these are called the eight virtues. Beyond the six directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records the intentions of the former kings, and the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, where there is division, there is also non-division; where there is debate, there is also non-debate.

One asks: "Why is this?" It is because the sage embraces it, while the multitude debate it to display to one another. Thus it is said: debate exists because there are things unseen. The great Dao is not named; great debate does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage does not harm. When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao; when words are debated, they do not reach; when benevolence is constant, it does not succeed; when integrity is pure, it is not trusted; when courage is harmful, it does not succeed. These five are round yet nearly square! Therefore, to know where knowledge stops is perfection. Who knows the debate of no words, the Dao of no speaking? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse. Pour into it and it is never full; draw from it and it never runs dry, yet one does not know its source—this is called the Preserved Light.

Thus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: "I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao. When I face south, I feel uneasy. What is the reason for this?"

Shun replied: "Those three rulers remain among the brambles and weeds. Why should you feel uneasy? In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, illuminating all things—how much more so the virtue that surpasses the sun!"

Nie Que asked Wang Ni: "Do you know what all things agree upon as right?"
Wang Ni said: "How would I know?"
"Do you know what you do not know?"
"How would I know?"
"Then do things have no knowledge?"
"How would I know?"

Though this be so, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing? Now, let me ask you this: When people sleep in dampness, their waists ache and they become half-paralyzed—is that true of loaches? When they dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—is that true of monkeys? Of these three, which knows the proper place to dwell? People eat the flesh of grass-fed and grain-fed animals; deer eat grass; centipedes delight in snakes; owls and crows relish mice. Of these four, which knows the proper taste? Monkeys pair with monkeys, deer mate with deer, loaches consort with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji were considered beautiful by men; but when fish saw them, they dove deep; when birds saw them, they flew high; when deer saw them, they bolted away. Of these four, which knows the true beauty of the world? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong—all are tangled and confused. How could I distinguish them?"

Nie Que said: "If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfect Man also not know benefit and harm?"
Wang Ni replied: "The Perfect Man is divine! Though great marshes burn, he is not hot; though rivers freeze, he is not cold; though thunder splits mountains and whirlwinds shake the sea, he is not startled. One like this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Death and life do not alter him—how much less the beginnings of benefit and harm!"

Ququezi asked Changwuzi: "I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not seek, does not follow the Dao; speaks as though silent, is silent as though speaking, and roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered this reckless talk, but I see it as the practice of the wondrous Dao. What do you think?"
Changwuzi said: "Even the Yellow Emperor would be dazzled by these words—how could Confucius suffice! Moreover, you are too hasty in your calculations, seeing an egg and demanding a rooster at dawn, seeing a slingshot and craving roast owl. Let me speak to you recklessly, and you may listen recklessly.

Why cling to sun and moon, embracing the cosmos? Let your lips meet, set aside confusion, and honor one another as servants. The multitude toil endlessly; the sage appears foolish and dull, blending the myriad ages into a single purity. All things are thus, mutually enfolding one another. How do I know that delight in life is not delusion? How do I know that aversion to death is not like a lost youth who does not know his way home?

Li Ji was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her collar was soaked; but once she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their former longing for life? Those who dream of drinking wake to weep; those who dream of weeping wake to hunt. While dreaming, they do not know it is a dream; within the dream, they may even interpret it. Only after waking do they know it was a dream. And only after the great awakening will they know that this was all a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, busily distinguishing—lord and shepherd, how rigid! You and I are both dreams; when I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called ‘uncanny reversal.’ Even after ten thousand ages, if a great sage appears who understands their meaning, it will be as though you met him morning and evening.

Suppose you and I debate: if you defeat me, and I do not defeat you, are you truly right and I truly wrong? If I defeat you, and you do not defeat me, am I truly right and you truly wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Are both of us right or both wrong? You and I cannot know. Then people are inherently shrouded in darkness—whom shall we ask to judge? Shall we ask one who agrees with you? Since he already agrees with you, how can he judge? Shall we ask one who agrees with me? Since he already agrees with me, how can he judge? Shall we ask one who differs from both of us? Since he differs from both, how can he judge? Shall we ask one who agrees with both of us? Since he agrees with both, how can he judge? Then you, I, and others cannot know—must we wait for another?"

"What does it mean to harmonize with the heavenly equality?"
"It means: ‘Is it so? Is it not so? If it is truly so, then its difference from ‘not so’ requires no debate; if it is truly so, then its difference from ‘not so’ requires no debate.’ The mutual dependence of changing sounds is like their independence. Harmonize with the heavenly equality, follow the flowing transformations, and thus live out your years. Forget years, forget righteousness, be stirred by the boundless, and thus dwell in the boundless."

The Shadowy Doubt asked the Shadow: "Earlier you were walking, now you are still; earlier you were sitting, now you are standing. Why are you so without constancy?"
The Shadow said: "Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How do I know why it is so? How do I know why it is not so?"

Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a fluttering butterfly, content with himself and doing as he pleased. He did not know he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, solidly and unmistakably Zhou. But he did not know whether he was Zhou who had dreamed he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhou. Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be some distinction. This is called the transformation of things.

**Chapter 3: The Secret of Caring for Life**

My life has a limit, but knowledge has none. To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous. And to pursue knowledge thus is even more perilous! In doing good, avoid seeking fame; in doing evil, avoid incurring punishment. Follow the central course as your guiding principle—this way you may preserve your body, fulfill your life, nurture your kin, and live out your years.

Cook Ding was carving an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, his shoulder leaned, his foot pressed, his knee braced—with a *hua* and a *xiang*, the blade sang, slicing *huo* through the flesh, never missing the rhythm, harmonizing with the "Mulberry Grove" dance, attaining the "Jingshou" melody.

Lord Wenhui exclaimed, "Ah! Excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?"

Cook Ding laid down his knife and replied, "What your servant loves is the Dao, which goes beyond mere skill. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I meet it with my spirit rather than my eyes; my senses halt, but my spirit moves. Following the natural grain, I cleave the great seams, guide the blade through the great cavities, all according to its inherent structure. My knife has never touched the ligaments or tendons, much less the great bones! A good cook changes his knife every year—it is worn from cutting. An ordinary cook changes his knife every month—it is broken from hacking. But my knife has been in use for nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, and its edge is still as if freshly whetted. For between the joints there are gaps, and the blade has no thickness. When what has no thickness enters where there is a gap, how vast the space for the blade to move! That is why after nineteen years, my knife’s edge is still as if freshly whetted. Nevertheless, whenever I come to a complex joint, I see the difficulty, I grow cautious, my gaze fixes, my movements slow. The blade moves ever so slightly, and *pffft*—the flesh falls apart like earth crumbling to the ground. Then I stand, knife in hand, look all around, savor the moment with satisfaction, wipe the blade clean, and put it away."

Lord Wenhui said, "Excellent! From Cook Ding’s words, I have learned how to care for life."

Gongwen Xuan saw the Right Master and was startled, saying, "What sort of man is this?"

"Whence comes this distinction? Is it from Heaven, or from man?"
"It is from Heaven, not from man. Heaven’s life creates this uniqueness, while man’s form has companions. By this we know it is from Heaven, not from man."

A marsh pheasant takes ten steps for one peck, a hundred steps for one drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit may be regal, it would not be well.

When Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to mourn him. After three cries, he left.
His disciples said, "Was he not your teacher’s friend?"
"Yes."
"Then is it proper to mourn him in this way?"
"Yes. At first, I thought he was a man, but now I see he was not. When I entered to mourn just now, the elders wailed for him as if for their own children, the young wailed for him as if for their own mothers. In their gathering, there must have been those who spoke without seeking to speak, who wailed without seeking to wail. This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling back on feeling, forgetting what one has received—what the ancients called ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.’ When he came, it was the Master’s time; when he departed, the Master followed. Abiding in timeliness and dwelling in compliance, sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this ‘the Great Release of the Lord.’"

A finger may be exhausted as firewood, but the fire is transmitted—who knows when it will end?

**Book Two, Chapter Four: "Among the World of Men"**
Yan Hui saw Confucius and asked to go forth.

Yan Hui said, "Where are you going?"
He replied, "I intend to go to Wei."
Confucius asked, "What will you do there?"
Yan Hui said, "I have heard that the Lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and does not recognize his faults. He treats the lives of his people as if they were nothing—so many die that the state measures them like marsh reeds, and the people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, ‘Leave a well-governed state; go to a disordered one. The physician’s gate is crowded with the sick.’ Reflecting on what I have heard, I hope that perhaps his state may yet be cured."

Confucius said, "Alas! You will likely go only to be punished! The Dao does not tolerate mixture—once mixed, it becomes excessive, and excess brings disorder. Disorder brings worry, and worry cannot be remedied. The perfected of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. When what is established within is settled, how could one have leisure to meddle in the conduct of violent men?

"Do you also know where virtue is swept away and from where knowledge arises? Virtue is swept away by fame, and knowledge arises from contention. Fame is the means by which men wound one another; knowledge is the tool of contention. Both are inauspicious instruments—not the way to act fully.

"Moreover, though one’s virtue be deep and trust unshaken, if one has not yet penetrated the qi of others, and though one’s fame be uncontentious, if one has not yet reached their hearts—yet to force upon them the language of benevolence and righteousness, the carpenter’s line of moral judgment, before violent men, is to make others resent what they see as one’s own beauty. This is called ‘bringing calamity upon others.’ And those who bring calamity upon others will surely have calamity returned upon them. You will likely become a calamity to others!

"If you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, what use is it to seek to be different? If you do not even issue commands, the lords and princes will surely exploit your presence to vie for advantage. Your eyes will be dazzled, your complexion smoothed, your mouth will scheme, your demeanor will take shape, and your heart will be molded by it. This is like quenching fire with fire, or flooding water with water—it is called ‘increasing the excess.’ If you follow this course without end, you will surely perish before violent men, for your earnest words will be met with distrust.

"Moreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were men who cultivated themselves and humbled themselves to soothe the people, yet they opposed their superiors. Their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. They were lovers of fame.

"Again, in ancient times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xuao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became wastelands of the dead, and they themselves were executed. Their warfare did not cease, and their pursuit of substance knew no end. These were all men who sought fame and substance—have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you!

"Nevertheless, if you must have some way, come and tell me your plan."

Yan Hui said, "If I am upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded, will that suffice?"
Confucius said, "Alas! How could that suffice?"

"Now, those who take yang as their fullness, their brilliance dazzling and colors shifting, are never opposed by ordinary men. They follow the inclinations of others to seek harmony with their hearts. Yet this is called a virtue that forms day by day—how much less can great virtue be achieved! They cling rigidly without transformation, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unexamined—how could this ever suffice!"

"Then let me be inwardly straight yet outwardly yielding, achieving while aligning with those above. To be inwardly straight is to follow Heaven as one’s companion. Those who follow Heaven know that the Son of Heaven and they themselves are all children of Heaven. Do they seek others’ approval when they speak, or fear others’ disapproval? Such a one is called a childlike man—this is what it means to follow Heaven as one’s companion. To be outwardly yielding is to follow men as one’s companions. Kneeling, bowing, and curving the body are the rites of a minister. If all men do this, how dare I not do the same? To do what others do is to be free from their blame—this is what it means to follow men as one’s companions. To achieve while aligning with those above is to follow the ancients as one’s companions. Though their words may instruct, their essence is borrowed—what the ancients possessed, I do not. Such a one, though straight, is not reproached—this is what it means to follow the ancients as one’s companion. Would this suffice?"

Confucius said, "Alas! How could this suffice!"

Excessive governance, with laws that do not deceive, may be firm yet blameless. Yet this is but the least of it—how could it reach transformation? It is still to follow one’s own mind."

Yan Hui said, "I have no further way forward. I venture to ask for your method."
Confucius said, "Fast, and I will tell you. To act while possessing—is this easy? Those who find it easy are not fit for the vastness of Heaven."

Yan Hui said, "My family is poor, and for months I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Is this fasting?"
Confucius said, "This is the fasting for sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind."
Yan Hui said, "I venture to ask about the fasting of the mind."
Confucius said, "Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but with the mind; do not listen with the mind but with qi. Listening stops at the ears, the mind stops at signs. Qi is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."

Yan Hui said, "Before I received your instruction, I was truly myself. Having received it, I have never been myself—can this be called emptiness?"
The Master said, "It is complete! Now I tell you: If you can enter its enclosure without being moved by its name, respond when it comes, cease when it does not—without gate, without harm, dwelling in one abode and lodging in the unattainable—you are nearly there. To leave no trace is easy; to walk without touching the ground is hard. To be employed by men is easy to falsify; to be employed by Heaven is hard to falsify. I have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Look into that empty chamber: the empty room generates brightness, and auspiciousness comes to rest. If it does not rest, this is called sitting but galloping. If you follow the ears and eyes to communicate within while shutting out the mind’s knowledge, even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more men! This is the transformation of the ten thousand things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jiqu. How much more those who are scattered!"

Lord Zigao of Ye was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi. He asked Confucius, saying, "The king’s charge to me is most weighty. Qi treats envoys with great respect but little urgency. Even a common man cannot be moved—how much less a feudal lord! I am deeply anxious. You once told me: ‘In all matters, whether small or great, few do not follow the Way to achieve success. If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human calamity; if it succeeds, there will surely be the calamity of imbalance between yin and yang. Only those of virtue can achieve success or failure without calamity.’ I eat coarse food and do not seek refinement, and my cook has no desire to purify himself. Yet now, having received my charge in the morning, by evening I drink ice—am I not inwardly burning? Before I have even reached the truth of the matter, I already suffer the calamity of yin and yang. If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human calamity—this is a double burden. As a minister, I am not equal to the task. I venture to ask for your instruction!"

Confucius said, "Under Heaven there are two great precepts: one is fate, the other is duty. A child’s love for parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is no place in Heaven and Earth where it does not apply. These are called the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, one finds peace without choosing the place—this is the perfection of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds peace without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own mind, sorrow and joy do not alter what lies before it; knowing the inevitable and finding peace in it as fate—this is the perfection of virtue. As a minister and child, one is fundamentally constrained by what cannot be avoided. Proceeding with the truth of affairs and forgetting oneself, how could one not delight in life and dread death? Your conduct is sufficient! Let me repeat what I have heard: In close dealings, trust must be mutual; in distant dealings, words must convey loyalty. Words must sometimes be transmitted. To transmit words that bring double joy or double anger is the most difficult task under Heaven. Double joy must overflow with excessive praise; double anger must overflow with excessive blame. All excess is delusion; delusion makes trust unreliable, and unreliable transmission brings misfortune. Thus the adage says: ‘Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit excess words—then you are nearly whole.’

Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with openness but often end in secrecy; when it grows great, it produces many strange tricks. Those who drink with ritual begin in order but often end in chaos; when it grows great, it produces many strange pleasures. All affairs are like this: they begin in good faith but often end in pettiness. Their beginnings are simple, but their endings must be vast. Words are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily endangered. Thus anger arises without cause, and clever words lead to biased speech. When beasts die, they do not choose their cries; their breath is labored, and their hearts grow fierce. When scrutiny becomes extreme, there must be unworthy responses, though one does not know why. If one does not know why, who knows how it will end! Thus the adage says: ‘Do not urge completion when changing orders. Excess leads to transgression.’ Urging completion when changing orders endangers affairs. Beauty achieved over time, evil done before it can be corrected—can one not be cautious!

To ride things with the mind, entrusting oneself to the unavoidable to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there for action in return? It is best to deliver the charge—this is the difficult part."

Yan He, about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei, asked Qu Boyu, saying: "There is a man here whose virtue is heaven-sent in its destructiveness. If I deal with him without method, it will endanger our state; if I deal with him by method, it will endanger myself. His knowledge is just sufficient to perceive others' faults, yet he does not know why they are at fault. In such a case, what am I to do?"

Qu Boyu replied: "Excellent question! Be on guard, be cautious—first rectify yourself! In form, draw near; in heart, harmonize. Yet even these two have their perils. In drawing near, do not enter too deeply; in harmonizing, do not reveal too much. If in form you draw near and enter too deeply, you will stumble, be destroyed, be overthrown. If in heart you harmonize and reveal too much, you will become a voice, a reputation, a portent, a calamity.

If he acts like an infant, then act like an infant with him; if he acts without boundaries, then act without boundaries with him; if he acts without limits, then act without limits with him. In penetrating this, you will enter into flawlessness.

Do you not know of the mantis? It brandished its arms to block the chariot wheel, unaware that it was unequal to the task—such was the beauty of its talent! Be on guard, be cautious! To accumulate merit and beauty and then offend him—this is perilously close!

Do you not know of those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, for fear of provoking their killing rage; they dare not feed them whole creatures, for fear of provoking their rending rage. They time their hunger and satiety, understanding the heart of their anger. Tigers are of a different kind from humans, yet they fawn upon those who feed them—this is because of compliance. Thus, those they kill are those who act in opposition.

Now, those who love horses use baskets to collect their droppings and clamshells to collect their urine. Yet if a mosquito or horsefly lands upon them and they are slapped at the wrong moment, the horse may break its bit, smash its head, or shatter its chest. The intention was to care, yet the love led to loss. Can one not be cautious?"

A master carpenter named Shi traveled to Qi and arrived at Quyuan, where he saw a sacred oak tree of the earth shrine. Its vastness could shade thousands of oxen; measuring its girth required a hundred spans. Its height towered to the clouds before branches appeared, and a dozen or more of its side limbs could serve as boats. Spectators gathered like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter paid no heed and walked on without pause. His disciple, having feasted his eyes upon it, caught up to Master Shi and said, "Since I took up the axe and followed you, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you not even glance at it, but walk on without stopping?"

The master replied, "Enough! Say no more! It is but a worthless tree. If used for a boat, it would sink; for a coffin or outer casket, it would rot swiftly; for vessels, it would quickly break; for doors or gates, it would ooze sap; for pillars, it would be eaten by worms. It is a tree of no use. Precisely because of this, it has attained such longevity."

Upon returning home, the sacred oak appeared to him in a dream, saying, "With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the so-called 'useful' trees? Those hawthorns, pears, oranges, and pomelos—all the fruit-bearing kinds—once their fruits ripen, they are stripped and humiliated. Their great branches are broken, their small branches plundered. This is how their abilities bring suffering to their lives. Thus, they do not fulfill their natural span but perish midway, struck down by the common world. All things are like this. As for me, I have sought to be of no use for a long time; nearly did I die before I attained it—now it is my great use. Had I been useful, could I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how can one thing judge another? And you, a nearly dead worthless man, what do you know of a worthless tree?"

Master Shi awoke and pondered his dream. His disciple asked, "If it seeks to be of no use, why then does it serve as a shrine?"

"Hush!" he replied. "Speak no more!"

That tree merely lodges there—taking the scorn of those who do not know it as its refuge. Had it not become a shrine, it would long since have been felled! Moreover, what it preserves differs from the common, yet to explain it by righteousness—how far removed is that!"

Master Nanbo Ziqi wandered to the hills of Shang, where he saw an extraordinary tree. A thousand chariots could shelter beneath its shade, its branches thick enough to conceal the sun. Ziqi said, "What tree is this? It must possess rare timber!" Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and useless for beams or rafters; looking down at its great roots, he saw they were split and rotten, unfit for coffins or outer caskets. Licking its leaves, his mouth blistered and burned; inhaling its scent, he fell into a frenzy, waking only after three days.

Ziqi said, "This is truly a worthless tree—yet it has grown so vast! Alas, the spirit-like person—such is their worthlessness!"

In Song there was a region called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those with trunks the span of two hands were felled by those seeking pegs for monkey perches; those three or four spans around were felled by those seeking timber for lofty names; those seven or eight spans around were felled by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking planks for their halls. Thus they did not fulfill their natural span but perished midway under the axe—this is the calamity of being useful.

Therefore, an ox with a white forehead, a pig with an upturned snout, or a person with hemorrhoids cannot cross the river—all known by shamans and diviners as inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person deems most auspicious.

There was one named Zhili Shu, whose chin nestled into his navel, shoulders rose above his crown, the meeting of his spine pointed heavenward, his five organs sat atop, and his thighs flanked his ribs. Mending needles and washing clothes, he earned enough to feed himself; winnowing grain and sifting chaff, he could feed ten. When the ruler conscripted warriors, Zhili Shu rolled up his sleeves and wandered among them; when great labor was imposed, he, being chronically infirm, was exempt from service; when grain was given to the ailing, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. Though his form was broken, it still sufficed to nourish his body and fulfill his natural span—how much more so for one whose virtue is thus "broken"!

Confucius traveled to Chu, and Jie Yu, the madman of Chu, wandered near his gate, singing:
*"Phoenix! Phoenix!
How the virtue has declined!
The age to come cannot be awaited,
The past cannot be pursued.
When the world follows the Dao,
The sage achieves;
When the world loses the Dao,
The sage survives.
In this present time,
One barely escapes punishment.
Blessing is lighter than a feather,
Yet none know how to bear it;
Calamity is heavier than the earth,
Yet none know how to avoid it.
Enough! Enough!
Approach others with virtue!
Perilous! Perilous!
Marking the ground to follow!
Thorns! Thorns!
Do not harm my path!
My path winds crookedly—
Do not harm my feet!"*

Mountain trees bring ruin upon themselves; fat fuels its own burning. Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is slashed. All know the use of the useful, but none know the use of the useless.

**Chapter Five: Signs of Full Virtue (Part Two, Below)**

In Lu there was a man named Wang Tai who had lost his feet; those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Chang Ji asked Confucius, "Wang Tai is a man without feet, yet his followers divide Lu equally with you. He stands without teaching, sits without discoursing. Those who go to him empty return full."

"Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is this?"

Confucius replied, "This Master is a sage. I merely follow behind him. If even I would take him as my teacher, how much more should those beneath me! Why limit this to the state of Lu? I would lead all under Heaven to follow him."

Chang Ji said, "He is a man without feet, yet he surpasses his teacher—how far he surpasses the common man! If this is so, how does he employ his mind?"

Confucius said, "Though life and death are great matters, they do not alter him. Though heaven and earth should collapse, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without reliance and does not shift with things; he commands the transformations of things yet holds fast to his root."

Chang Ji asked, "What does this mean?"

Confucius replied, "Viewed from what makes them different, liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what makes them the same, all things are one. One who is thus does not know what the ears and eyes deem fitting but roams the mind in the harmony of virtue. He sees what is one in things and not what is lost; he regards the loss of his feet as no more than discarded dirt."

Chang Ji said, "He cultivates himself through his understanding, attains his heart through his heart. Why do things gather to him above all others?"

Confucius replied, "Men do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many. Rooted in earth, only the pine and cypress stand upright, green through winter and summer. Rooted in Heaven, only Yao and Shun stand upright, foremost among the myriad things. Fortunate is he who can rectify life, thereby rectifying the lives of others. The proof of preserving the beginning lies in fearlessness—one brave man can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and bind themselves to it are yet like this, how much more one who governs Heaven and Earth, stores the myriad things, treats the six limbs as mere lodging, takes the ears and eyes as mere images, unifies all he knows, and whose heart never dies! He will choose his day to ascend on high, and men will follow him. How would he deign to make things his concern?"

Apintu Jia, a man without feet, studied under the same master as Zichan of Zheng, Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Apintu Jia, "When I leave, you stay; when you leave first, I stay." The next day, they again sat together in the same hall on the same mat. Zichan said to Apintu, "When I leave first, you stay; when you leave first, I stay. Now I am about to leave—can you stay, or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you defy him. Do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?"

Apintu Jia replied, "In the master’s gate, is there truly one in power such as this? Are you pleased to be called one who defers to power and puts himself last? I have heard it said: ‘When the mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, it is not bright. To dwell long with the worthy is to be without fault.’ Now what you value most is the master, yet you still speak like this—is this not a fault?"

Zichan said, "You are already like this, yet you still contend with Yao in goodness. By your own virtue, are you not sufficient to reflect upon yourself?"

Apintu Jia said, "Those who justify their faults and claim they should not have lost their feet are many; those who do not justify their faults and yet should not have kept their feet are few. To know there is nothing to be done and yet accept it as fate—only one with virtue can do this. In Yi’s drawn bow, the center is the target; yet those who do not hit it is a matter of fate. People with whole feet laugh at me for not having whole feet, and I would bristle with anger. But when I come to the master’s place, I return calm and composed. Do I not know that the master washes me with goodness? Or is it that I awaken myself? I have wandered with you for nineteen years, yet you have never known that I lack feet. Now you wander with me within the realm of form and spirit, yet you seek me outside of form—is this not a fault?"

Zichan, startled, changed his expression and said, "You need not say more!"

In Lu there was a man without feet, Shushan Wuzhi, who came to see Confucius on his heels. Confucius said, "You were not careful, and already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?"

Wuzhi said, "I simply did not know my duty and lightly used my body, which is why I lost my feet. Now I come because I still possess what is more honorable than feet, and so I strive to preserve it whole. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven—how could I have known you would be like this?"

Confucius said, "I am indeed shallow! Why do you not come in? Let me share with you what I have heard." Wuzhi left.

Confucius said to his disciples, "Take heed! Wuzhi, a man without feet, still strives to learn to make up for the faults of his past conduct—how much more should a man of whole virtue do so!"

Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, "Is Confucius not yet a perfected man? Why does he persistently treat learning as a guest? He seeks to be known for strange and marvelous fame, unaware that to the perfected man, this is but his own shackles."

Lao Dan said, "Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuum, and thereby free him from his shackles? Would that be possible?"

Wuzhi said, "It is Heaven’s punishment—how can it be freed?"

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, saying, "In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who dwell with him grow so attached they cannot bear to leave. Women who see him beg their parents, saying, 'Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be this gentleman’s concubine'—a dozen or more, and still they come. He never takes the lead in anything, only ever harmonizing with others. He holds no lordly rank to deliver men from death, nor hoards wealth to fill men’s bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startles all beneath heaven, yet he harmonizes without leading, and his wisdom never extends beyond his four bounds. Yet men and women alike gather before him—he must possess something beyond other men. I summoned him to observe him, and indeed, his ugliness startled all beneath heaven. When he dwelt with me, before a month had passed, I took note of his character; before a year had elapsed, I trusted him. The state had no chief minister, so I offered him the governance. He responded with reluctance, as if declining; I felt ashamed, yet in the end I entrusted him with the state. In no time at all, he left me and departed. I grieved as though I had suffered a loss, as though no one remained to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man is he?"

Confucius said, "Once, when I was sent on a mission to Chu, I happened to see some piglets nursing from their dead mother. After a little while, they glanced about in alarm and all abandoned her to flee. They did not see themselves in her, nor did they find her like them. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but what animated her form. When men die in battle, their burials are not furnished with ritual trappings; when a man’s feet are severed, no one cherishes his shoes—neither has its root."

The attendants of the Son of Heaven do not pare their nails or pierce their ears; those who take a wife remain outside the palace and are no longer employed. Even one whose form is whole may thus suffice for such service—how much more so the man of complete virtue!

Now, this Ai Taituo spoke not yet won trust, yet was trusted; had no merit, yet was beloved. He made men offer him a state, only fearing he would not accept. He must be one whose talents are whole and whose virtue does not manifest in form."

Duke Ai said, "What is meant by *talents whole*?"

Confucius replied, "Life and death, survival and ruin, success and failure, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the workings of fate, the course of destiny. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginning. Thus, they must not be allowed to disturb harmony or enter the treasury of the mind. Let them bring harmony and joy, flowing freely without losing their openness. Let day and night pass without gap, so that one’s springtime spirit pervades all things. This is what it means to have *talents whole*."

"What is meant by *virtue not manifest in form*?"

"Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It may serve as a model, for inwardly it preserves equilibrium without agitation. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. When virtue does not manifest in form, things cannot depart from it."

On another day, Duke Ai told Min Zi what he had heard: "At first, I thought that by facing south as ruler of the world, upholding the people’s guiding principles and grieving over their deaths, I had attained the utmost understanding. Now, hearing of the *perfect man*, I fear I lack his reality—have taken my person lightly and risked losing my state. Between Confucius and me, there is no lord and minister, only a friendship of virtue."

Yin Qi, Zhili, and Wu Chun persuaded Duke Ling of Wei, and the duke delighted in them.

When he looked at whole men, their necks seemed so slender.

The hunchbacked man with a huge goiter charmed Duke Huan of Qi, and the duke delighted in him; when he looked at whole men, their necks seemed so slender.

Thus virtue may excel while form is forgotten. When men forget what should be forgotten and forget even what should not be forgotten, this is called true forgetting.

Therefore, the sage wanders freely—yet knowledge becomes a snare, covenants turn to glue, virtue becomes a bond, and craft becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme; why employ knowledge? He does not carve; why employ glue? He suffers no loss; why employ virtue? He does not trade; why engage in commerce? These four are the nourishment of Heaven. What Heaven nourishes is the sustenance of Heaven. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why employ man?

One may possess the form of a man yet lack the passions of a man. Possessing the form of a man, one mingles with men; lacking the passions of a man, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How tiny and insignificant—this way of being human! How vast and great—alone to complete one’s Heaven!

Hui Zi said to Zhuangzi: "Can man truly be without passion?"
Zhuangzi said: "Yes."
Hui Zi said: "If a man is without passion, how can he be called a man?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—how can he not be called a man?"
Hui Zi said: "If he is called a man, how can he be without passion?"
Zhuangzi said: "This is not what I mean by passion. What I call being without passion is that one does not allow likes and dislikes to enter and harm the self, but constantly follows the natural without adding to life."
Hui Zi said: "If one does not add to life, how can one preserve one’s body?"
Zhuangzi said: "The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—do not allow likes and dislikes to enter and injure the body. Now you externalize your spirit, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree, rest on a withered catalpa, and doze. Heaven chose your form, yet you chatter about 'hard and white'!"

Book Three, Part One: Chapter Six – The Great and Venerable Teacher

To know what Heaven does and to know what man does—this is perfection! To know what Heaven does is to be born of Heaven; to know what man does is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, so that one completes one’s Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.

Yet there is a danger. Knowledge must await something before it is fitting, but what it awaits is never certain. How do I know that what I call Heaven is not man? How do I know that what I call man is not Heaven? Only when there is a true person is there true knowledge.

What is a true person? The true persons of old did not oppose the few, did not take pride in success, did not scheme. When they erred, they did not regret; when they hit the mark, they did not feel self-satisfied. When they climbed high, they did not tremble; when they entered water, they were not drenched; when they entered fire, they did not feel the heat. Their knowledge could ascend to the Dao in this way.

The true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry; they ate without relishing flavor, and their breath was deep. Their breath came from their heels, while the breath of ordinary people came from their throats. Those who are bent and submissive choke on their words as if retching. The deeper their desires, the shallower their Heavenly mechanism.

The true persons of old did not delight in life, did not detest death. They did not rejoice at coming forth, nor resist at going in. Swiftly they came, swiftly they went—no more. They did not seek the beginning, nor pursue the end. They received and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is what is called not using the mind to harm the Dao, not using man to assist Heaven. This is what is called a true person.

Such a one’s mind is forgotten, their countenance is still, their forehead is broad. They are chill like autumn, warm like spring; their joy and anger come in due season, fitting the things of the world, yet none knows their limit.

Thus, when the sage uses arms, they may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. Their beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet they do not do it out of love for others. To be all-pervading is not sageliness; to have partiality is not benevolence; to follow the seasons is not worthiness; to be unable to comprehend advantage and harm is not a gentleman; to act for fame is not a scholar; to lose oneself yet not be true is not to serve others.

Those like Hu Buxie, Wu Guang, Bo Yi, Shu Qi, Jizi, Xu Yu, and Shentu Di—these are servants of others’ service, followers of others’ following, yet do not follow their own following.

The true persons of old were upright yet not rigid, sufficient yet not complacent. They were angular yet not unyielding, open yet not ostentatious. They were cheerful as if pleased, solemn as if compelled. Their demeanor was expansive, their virtue restraining. They were stern as if worldly, lofty as if beyond control. They were connected as if fond of seclusion, absent-minded as if forgetful of their words.

They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, knowledge as their timing, and virtue as their guide. Taking punishment as their body, they were lenient in execution. Taking ritual as their wings, they moved through the world. Taking knowledge as their timing, they acted only when compelled by circumstances. Taking virtue as their guide, they spoke of reaching the hills with those who had feet, yet others truly thought them diligent in conduct.

Thus, their likes were one, their dislikes were one. Their oneness was one, their non-oneness was one. Their oneness followed Heaven as a companion; their non-oneness followed man as a companion. That Heaven and man do not overcome each other—this is what is called a true person.

Life and death are fate; they have the constancy of night and day—this is Heaven. What man cannot partake in is the nature of things. They take Heaven as their father and love it as their own body—how much more that which transcends it! Men take having a ruler as better than themselves and die for it—how much more that which is true!

When the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on dry land. They moisten each other with breath, wet each other with foam—better to forget each other in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.

The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to make my life good is to make my death good.

Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh—one may call it secure. Yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry it away, and the unaware do not know. Hiding the great is fitting, yet there is still escape. But if one hides the world within the world, there is no escape—this is the great constancy of things.

Only those who receive the human form rejoice in it. Yet those who have the human form are among the myriad transformations that have no beginning—how boundless their joy! Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and abides in all.

To be good at early death, good at old age, good at beginning, good at ending—people emulate this. How much more that on which the myriad things depend and which the one transformation awaits!

The Dao has essence and trustworthiness, yet is without action or form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is rooted in itself, existed before Heaven and Earth, and has endured since antiquity. It gives spirit to ghosts and gods, gives birth to Heaven and Earth. It is before the Supreme Ultimate yet not high; it is below the Six Directions yet not deep. It was born before Heaven and Earth yet is not long-lasting; it is older than antiquity yet not aged.

Xiwei obtained it and lifted Heaven and Earth. Fuxi obtained it and embraced the Mother of Qi. The Northern Dipper obtained it and has never erred since antiquity. The sun and moon obtained it and have never ceased since antiquity. Kanpi obtained it and embraced Kunlun. Feng Yi obtained it and roamed the great rivers. Jianwu obtained it and dwelled on the great mountains. The Yellow Emperor obtained it and ascended to the cloudy heavens. Zhuanxu obtained it and dwelled in the Dark Palace. Yuqiang obtained it and stood at the North Pole.

The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat upon Shaoguang, her beginning unknown, her end unknown. Peng Zu obtained it and lived from the time of Youyu down to the Five Hegemons. Fu Yue obtained it and served as minister to King Wu, ruling all under Heaven, riding the Eastern Ridge and mounting the Tail of the Winnowing Basket to take his place among the ranks of stars.

Nanbo Zikui asked Nü Yu, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this?” She replied, “I have heard the Dao.” Nanbo Zikui said, “Can the Dao be learned?” She said, “How could it be! You are not the right person. Now, Bolang Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. I still kept to it and taught him. For three days, I was able to put the world outside myself. Having put the world outside, I kept to it for seven days, and then was able to put things outside myself. Having put things outside, I kept to it for nine days, and then was able to put life outside myself. Having put life outside, I was then able to attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, I was then able to perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, I was then able to transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, I was then able to enter the realm of neither death nor life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing off, welcomes nothing in; nothing is destroyed, nothing is not completed. Its name is *yingning*. *Yingning* is that which is completed through engagement.”

Nanbo Zikui said, “You alone have heard of this!” She said, “I heard it from the disciple of Fu Mo; the disciple of Fu Mo heard it from the grandson of Luo Song; the grandson of Luo Song heard it from Zhan Ming; Zhan Ming heard it from Nie Xu; Nie Xu heard it from Xu Yi; Xu Yi heard it from Yu Ou; Yu Ou heard it from Xuan Ming; Xuan Ming heard it from Can Liao; Can Liao heard it as doubt.”

Zisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke among themselves, saying, “Who can take nonbeing as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone, and who knows that life, death, existence, and nonexistence are one body—we would befriend such a one.” The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in accord, and so became friends.

Soon after, Ziyu fell ill, and Zisi went to inquire after him. Ziyu said, “How wondrous is the Creator! It would make me like this—all crooked!”

His spine was bent like a bow, his back hunched into a hump, with five vital channels rising from it. His chin sank into his navel, his shoulders towered above his crown, and his neck’s growth pointed heavenward.

Though the yin and yang had fallen into disorder, his heart remained at ease, untroubled. He paced lightly to peer into a well and said, “Alas! The Creator would make me so twisted and bound!”

Zisi asked, “Do you resent it?”

“No, why should I? If by degrees my left arm were transformed into a rooster, I would use it to crow the hours of the night. If my right arm were turned into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt for roasted owl. If my tailbone became a wheel and my spirit a horse, I would ride it—why ever change mounts? Moreover, to gain is timely; to lose is to follow the flow. At peace with the time and in accord with the flow, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called ‘suspended release,’ yet those who cannot release themselves are bound by things. Besides, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven—what should I resent?”

Soon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zisi went to see him and cried, “Away! Begone! Do not disturb the transformation!” Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to Zilai: “How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you a rat’s liver? A bug’s leg?”

Zilai said, “A child follows the commands of its parents, whether east, south, west, or north. The yin and yang are no less to a person than parents. If they press me toward death and I refuse, I would be stubborn—what fault is theirs? The Great Clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me in death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well. Now, if a great smith were casting metal and the metal leapt up, saying, ‘I must become a *Mo Ye* sword!’ the smith would surely deem it ill-omened metal. If one who has taken human form were to cry, ‘A human! A human!’ the Creator would surely deem it an ill-omened person. Now, if we take Heaven and Earth as a great furnace and the Creator as the great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable?” With that, he fell into a deep sleep and suddenly awoke.

Zisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang became friends, saying to one another, “Who can join together without joining, act without acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists, stirring the boundless, forgetting life and never reaching an end?” The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in accord, and so became friends.

After some time, Zisang Hu died, and before he was buried, Confucius heard of it and sent Zigong to assist with the rites. One wove ropes, another strummed the zither, and together they sang in harmony: “Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu! You have returned to your true nature, while we still remain as humans!”

Zigong hurried forward and said, “May I ask if it is proper to sing before the corpse?”

The two looked at each other and smiled. “What does he know of the meaning of ritual?”

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius, saying, “What sort of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, disregard their physical forms, sing before the corpse without changing countenance—there is no name for them. What sort of men are they?”

Confucius said, “They wander beyond the realm of ordinary ways, while I wander within it. The inner and outer do not meet, and for me to send you to offer condolences was shallow indeed! They are about to become companions of the Creator, wandering in the single qi of Heaven and Earth. To them, life is an excrescence, a hanging tumor; death is the bursting of an abscess. How could such as they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from different things, they entrust themselves to the same body, forgetting their livers and gallbladders, neglecting their ears and eyes. They cycle through beginnings and ends, unaware of their origins or limits, wandering in a vast blur beyond the dust and grime, at ease in the work of non-action. How could they be muddled by worldly customs to perform for the eyes and ears of the crowd?”

Zigong said, “Then what Dao do you follow?”

Confucius said, “I am one whom Heaven has punished. Nevertheless, I share it with you.”

Zigong said, “May I ask what that means?”

Confucius said, “Fish are made for water, just as humans are made for the Dao. Those made for water thrive by digging ponds to sustain themselves; those made for the Dao find peace without effort. Thus it is said: ‘Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; humans forget one another in the arts of the Dao.’”

Zigong said, “May I ask about the *qi*-person?”

Confucius said, “The *qi*-person is one who is odd among humans but equal to Heaven. Thus it is said: ‘Heaven’s petty person is humanity’s noble one; humanity’s child is Heaven’s petty person.’”

Yan Hui asked Confucius, “When Mengsun Cai’s mother died, he wept without tears, his heart was not grieved, and he did not mourn. Yet for these three, he was praised throughout Lu for his mastery of mourning—could it be that one can gain such a reputation without substance? I find it strange.”

Confucius said, “Mengsun has advanced in understanding. He has simplified what cannot be simplified, yet he has already achieved some simplification. Mengsun does not know why he lives or why he dies, does not know what to pursue first or last. If he is transformed into something else, he awaits the transformation he does not know! Moreover, as he is about to transform, how could he not transform? As he is about to cease transforming, how could he know he has already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened! Though his form may be startled, his heart remains unharmed; though his dwelling changes, his essence does not die.”

Mengsun alone has awakened—when others weep, he weeps as well, for this is simply his nature.

Moreover, we merely accompany one another in this; how could you know what I mean by "I"? You dream of being a bird and soaring through the heavens, dream of being a fish and diving into the depths. Who can tell whether the speaker now is awake or still dreaming? One reaches joy before laughter comes, offers laughter before arranging it—resting in arrangement, one departs into transformation, entering the vastness of the singular sky.

Yi’erzi went to see Xu You. Xu You asked, “What did Yao provide you?” Yi’erzi replied, “Yao told me: ‘You must personally embody benevolence and righteousness, and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’” Xu You said, “Then why have you come here? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness, and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the path of carefree drifting, uninhibited roaming, and ceaseless transformation?” Yi’erzi said, “Even so, I wish to wander within the fence.” Xu You said, “Not so. The blind cannot appreciate the beauty of brows and eyes, the blind musician cannot perceive the patterns of blue and yellow embroidery.”

Yi’erzi said, “Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom—all within the span of smelting and forging. How do we know the Creator will not cease my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride completion and follow you, Master?” Xu You said, “Alas! It cannot be known. Let me tell you the general principle: My teacher! My teacher!”

"To bestow upon ten thousand yet claim no righteousness, to benefit all generations yet claim no benevolence, to endure since high antiquity yet claim no seniority, to encompass heaven and earth and carve all forms yet claim no skill—this is the realm in which I wander."

Yan Hui said, "I have made progress."
Confucius said, "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied, "I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness."
Confucius said, "Good, but not yet sufficient."

Another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, "I have made further progress."
Confucius asked, "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied, "I have forgotten ritual and music."
Confucius said, "Good, but still not sufficient."

On yet another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, "I have advanced!"
Confucius asked, "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied, "I sit in forgetfulness."
Confucius started and said, "What is sitting in forgetfulness?"
Yan Hui answered, "To cast off the body, discard wisdom and clarity, depart from form and abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called sitting in forgetfulness."
Confucius said, "To be without preferences is to be in accord; to transform without fixity is to be free. You are indeed worthy! I shall follow after you."

Yan Yu and Zi Sang were friends. After ten days of continuous rain, Yan Yu said, "Zi Sang must be in dire straits!" He wrapped up some rice and went to bring him food. At Zi Sang’s door, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping, and the strumming of a zither: *"Father! Mother! Heaven! Man!"* Yet his voice could not sustain the strain, and he hurriedly recited verses instead.

Yan Yu entered and asked, "Why do you sing and recite like this?"

Zi Sang replied, "I pondered who brought me to this extremity, but I could not find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without favoritism. Would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one responsible, but I could not find them! Yet here I am at this extremity—it must be fate!"

*Book Three, Part Two, Chapter Seven: "Fit for Emperors"*

Nie Que asked Wang Ni four questions, and four times Wang Ni replied that he did not know. Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.

Pu Yi said, "So now you understand? The Lord of Yu falls short of the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed his benevolence to entice men; he gained men’s allegiance, yet he had not yet transcended the realm of the unenlightened. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease, awoke in carefree openness; at times he took himself for a horse, at times for an ox. His knowledge was true and sincere, his nature unspoiled, and he had never yet entered the realm of the unenlightened."

Jian Wu visited the madman Jie Yu.

Jie Yu the Madman asked, "What did Zhongshi of Noon-tide tell you?"
Jian Wu replied, "He instructed me on how to rule as a sovereign: issue decrees from one’s own authority, establish standards of propriety and measures of righteousness—who among the people would dare not heed and be transformed?"

Jie Yu said, "This is mere *virtue*—in governing the world, it is like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a mosquito bear a mountain. Does the sage’s governance concern externals? He simply rectifies himself and then acts, ensuring his affairs are firmly grounded in his capacity. Birds fly high to evade the harm of snares and arrows; the field mouse burrows deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the peril of fumigation and excavation—yet how could these two creatures be called ignorant?"

Tian Gen wandered to Yin-yang and arrived at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered an unnamed man and asked, "I beg to inquire how to govern the world."
The man said, "Away with you! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such an untimely question? I am about to become human with the Creator of Things. When weary, I will ride the nebulous bird to soar beyond the six directions and wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the boundless wilds. Why would you trouble my mind with governing the world?"

Tian Gen asked again.
The unnamed man said, "Let your mind wander in simplicity, harmonize your *qi* in stillness, follow things as they are without imposing private bias—and the world will be governed."

Yang Ziju visited Lao Dan and said, "Suppose there were a man here, swift and strong, penetrating and clear-sighted, tireless in studying the Dao. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"
Lao Dan said, "In the eyes of the sage, such a man is like a petty clerk bound by skills, exhausting his body and startling his mind. Moreover, the patterned hides of tigers and leopards attract hunters; the agility of apes and the cunning of foxes and dogs bring them to be leashed. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"

Yang Ziju, startled, said, "May I ask how an enlightened king governs?"
Lao Dan said, "The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet are not claimed as his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. He achieves without being named, allowing things to rejoice in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothing."

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew of people’s death and life, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, predicting them by the year, month, ten-day period, or day as if by spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in haste. Liezi saw him and was enchanted in his heart. Returning home, he told Master Hu, saying, "At first I took your Dao as the ultimate, but now there is something even more ultimate!"

Master Hu said, "I have shown you only its outward form, not yet its true substance. How could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they produce eggs? You take the Dao and contend with the world, and so you are inevitably believed. That is why others can see through you. Try bringing him here, and let me show myself to him."

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. After leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi, "Alas! Your master is dead! He will not live! It will not be counted in days! I saw something strange—like damp ashes."

Liezi entered and wept, his tears soaking his lapels, as he told Master Hu. Master Hu said, "Earlier I showed him the pattern of earth: sprouting yet neither stirring nor upright. This is nearly seeing my closed virtue-mechanism. Bring him again."

The next day, he again brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. After leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi, "Fortunate that your master met me! He is recovering! He is fully alive! I see his closed power-mechanism!"

Liezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, "Earlier I showed him the realm of heaven and earth: names and realities did not enter, yet the mechanism arose from the heels. This is nearly seeing my mechanism of excellence. Bring him again."

The next day, he brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. After leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi, "Your master is unsettled; I cannot divine for him. Try to settle him, and I will divine again."

Liezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, "Earlier I showed him the state of supreme harmony where nothing prevails. This is nearly seeing my balanced qi-mechanism. The whirlpool formed by the turning of the *ni* fish, the whirlpool formed by still water, the whirlpool formed by flowing water—there are nine names for whirlpools, and I showed him three. Bring him again."

The next day, he again brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. Before he could stand firmly, Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Master Hu said, "Pursue him!" Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Hu, "He has vanished! He is gone! I could not reach him."

Master Hu said, "Earlier I showed him what had never yet been my origin. I met him with emptiness and compliance, so that he knew not who or what I was. Thus he took me for drifting grass, for flowing waves—hence his flight."

After this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn and returned home. For three years he did not go out. He cooked for his wife, fed the pigs as if feeding people, and took no part in affairs. Carving and polishing returned to simplicity; he stood alone like an unworked clod. Entangled yet sealed off, he ended thus. He became no one’s representative for fame, no repository of schemes, no bearer of tasks, no master of knowledge. His body exhausted the boundless, and he wandered without trace. What he received from heaven, he did not regard as gain—it was emptiness alone!

The heart-mind of the perfected person is like a mirror: it does not send forth nor welcome, responds yet does not store, and so can overcome things without harm.

The emperor of the Southern Sea was Shu, the emperor of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the emperor of the Central Realm was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying, "All people have seven openings for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one lacks them. Let us bore them for him." Each day they bored one opening, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.

Joined toes and extra fingers—do they arise from nature? Yet they exceed in virtue. Hanging tumors and dangling warts—do they arise from form? Yet they exceed in nature. Those who square themselves with benevolence and righteousness and apply them—do they array them among the five viscera? Yet this is not the uprightness of the Dao and virtue.

Thus, joined toes are but connected useless flesh; extra fingers are but branches of useless digits. Those who multiply methods and join branches to the passions of the five viscera indulge in perverse conduct through benevolence and righteousness, and multiply their cleverness and brightness. Thus, those joined in brightness disorder the five colors, indulge in ornate patterns, and dazzle with blue and yellow, embroidered and figured robes—is this not Li Zhu? Those excessive in hearing disorder the five notes, indulge in the six pitch-pipes, and resound with bells, stones, strings, and bamboo, with *huangzhong* and *dalü*—is this not Shi Kuang? Those who branch into benevolence pluck at virtue and block nature to gather fame, causing the world to drum and blow in service of unattainable laws—is this not Zeng and Shi? Those joined in disputation pile tiles and knot cords, weave phrases, and roam their minds among the hard and white, the same and different—are not their half-step praises empty words? Are these not Yang and Mo? Thus, all these are ways of excessive joining and branching—none are the utmost uprightness of the world.

That which is truly upright does not lose the genuine condition of its nature and life. Therefore, what is conjoined is not called joined, and what is branched is not called extended; what is long is not called excessive, and what is short is not called insufficient. Thus, though the teal’s legs are short, to lengthen them brings sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, to cut them brings grief. Therefore, what is long by nature is not to be cut, and what is short by nature is not to be lengthened—there is nothing to remove sorrow.

Do benevolence and righteousness truly not accord with human nature? Why then are those benevolent people so full of worries? Moreover, joined toes, when split, weep; extra fingers, when bitten, wail. These two—one exceeds in number, the other falls short—yet their sorrow is the same. The benevolent of this age gaze in distress at the world’s calamities; the unbenevolent sever the passions of nature and glut themselves on wealth and nobility. Thus, do benevolence and righteousness truly not accord with human nature?

Since the time below the Three Dynasties, why has the world been so clamorous? Those who wait for hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to be upright shave away their nature; those who bind fast with glue and lacquer encroach upon their virtue. Bending and folding with rites and music, cooing and soothing with benevolence and righteousness to comfort the world’s heart—this is its constant state. The world has its constant state: what is constant is that the curved does not rely on hooks, the straight does not rely on cords, the round does not rely on compasses, the square does not rely on squares, attachment does not rely on glue and lacquer, and restraint does not rely on ropes. Thus, the world is enticed and all things live, yet do not know how they live; all obtain, yet do not know how they obtain. Therefore, from ancient times to now, there is no duality—it cannot be diminished.

Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling like glue and lacquer, ropes and cords, roaming between the Dao and virtue? They confuse the world! Minor delusions alter direction; great delusions alter nature. How do we know this? When the House of Yu summoned benevolence and righteousness to vex the world, none failed to rush to serve benevolence and righteousness. Was this not using benevolence and righteousness to alter their nature?

Let us attempt to discuss this: since the time below the Three Dynasties, none have not used things to alter their nature! Petty men sacrifice themselves for profit; scholars sacrifice themselves for fame; great officers sacrifice themselves for their houses; sages sacrifice themselves for the world. Thus, though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations bear different names, in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one.

Zang and Gu together herded sheep, and both lost them. Asked what Zang was doing, he held a bamboo slip and read books; asked what Gu was doing, he played at dice and gambled. Though their undertakings differed, in losing their sheep they were the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang; Robber Zhi died for profit upon Dongling. Though their deaths differed, in injuring their lives and harming their natures they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is entirely given to sacrifice.

Those who sacrifice themselves for benevolence and righteousness are commonly called gentlemen; those who sacrifice themselves for wealth and property are commonly called petty men. Though their sacrifices are one, there are gentlemen and petty men among them. But in injuring their lives and harming their natures, Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi—how then can one distinguish gentlemen and petty men among them?

Those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness, though as accomplished as Zeng and Shi, are not what I call good; those who bind their nature to the five flavors, though as accomplished as Yu Er, are not what I call good; those who bind their nature to the five notes, though as accomplished as Shi Kuang, are not what I call keen; those who bind their nature to the five colors, though as accomplished as Li Zhu, are not what I call bright.

What I call good is not what is meant by benevolence and righteousness—it is being good in one’s virtue alone. What I call good is not what is meant by benevolence and righteousness—it is following the genuine condition of one’s nature and life. What I call keen is not hearing others—it is hearing oneself. What I call bright is not seeing others—it is seeing oneself.

Those who do not see themselves but see others, who do not obtain for themselves but obtain for others, obtain others’ obtainments yet do not obtain their own obtainments, suit others’ suits yet do not suit their own suits. Those who suit others’ suits yet do not suit their own suits—though it be Zhi or Boyi—are equally perverse and deviant. I am ashamed before the Dao and virtue, and thus above I dare not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below I dare not engage in perverse and deviant acts.

**Chapter Nine: "Horse’s Hooves"**

A horse’s hooves can tread frost and snow; its hair can ward off wind and cold.

Gnawing grass and drinking water, lifting its hooves to gallop—this is the nature of the horse. Though there be halls of righteousness and chambers of state, they are of no use to it. Yet when Bo Le came and said, “I am skilled in managing horses,” he burned them, scraped them, carved them, and branded them. He bound them with halters and fetters, penned them in blackened stalls—of these horses, twelve or thirteen in every ten died. He starved them, parched them, drove them at a gallop, urged them to speed, aligned them, and made them uniform. Before them lay the peril of bit and ornament, behind them the threat of whip and goad—of these horses, more than half perished!

The potter says, “I am skilled in managing clay. The round fit the compass, the square the carpenter’s square.” The craftsman says, “I am skilled in managing wood. The curved fit the hook, the straight the marking-line.” But is it the nature of clay and wood to desire to fit compass, square, hook, and line? Yet generation after generation they praise them, saying, “Bo Le is skilled in managing horses, the potter and craftsman are skilled in managing clay and wood.” This is also the error of those who govern the world.

I suppose those who are truly skilled in governing the world would not act thus. The people have their constant nature: they weave to clothe themselves, till to feed themselves—this is called shared virtue. They are one and without faction, and this is called “Heaven’s release.” Thus in the age of utmost virtue, their movements were unhurried, their gazes unwavering. In that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. The myriad things thrived in flocks, linked to their native places. Beasts formed herds, grasses and trees flourished. Thus birds and beasts could be led by tether and wandered with, the nests of magpies and crows could be scaled and peered into. In the age of utmost virtue, people dwelt together with birds and beasts, their kind mingled with the myriad things. How would they know of gentlemen and petty men? Alike in knowledge, their virtue did not depart; alike in desirelessness, this was called “plain simplicity.” In plain simplicity, the people’s nature was preserved.

Yet when the sage came, he limped and strained for benevolence, stamped and struggled for righteousness—and the world began to doubt. He spread extravagance as music, plucked and pranced as ritual—and the world began to divide. Thus if plain simplicity is not shattered, who would make sacrificial vessels? If white jade is not broken, who would carve scepters and tablets? If virtue is not abandoned, why take up benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feelings are not estranged, why employ ritual and music? If the five colors are not confused, who would fashion patterned embroidery? If the five notes are not disordered, who would tune them to the six pitches? Shattering simplicity to make vessels is the fault of the craftsman; destroying the Dao and virtue to establish benevolence is the error of the sage.

The horse, when at rest, eats grass and drinks water; when pleased, it nuzzles necks together; when angered, it turns its back and kicks. The horse’s knowledge extends only so far! Yet when you impose a crossbar and yoke, align it with moon-shaped blinkers, the horse learns to glare, gnash, resist the bit, and steal the reins. Thus the horse’s knowledge, able to reach the point of theft, is Bo Le’s crime.

In the time of He Xu, the people dwelt without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go. They chewed their food in joy, drummed their bellies in play. The people were capable of this! Yet when the sage came, bending and twisting ritual and music to correct the world’s form, dangling benevolence and righteousness to soothe the world’s heart, the people began to stretch and strain for knowledge, to contend and rush toward profit—it could not be stopped. This, too, is the sage’s error.

To guard against thieves who pry open chests, rifle through bags, and break into coffers, one must bind them with cords, fasten them with ropes, and secure them with bolts and locks—this is what the common world knows. Yet when the great thief comes, he shoulders the coffer, hoists the chest, and carries off the bag, fearing only that the cords, ropes, bolts, and locks are not strong enough. Thus what was once called wisdom is but the accumulation for the great thief.

Let us examine this: is there any so-called wisdom in the common world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there any so-called sage who does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so? In ancient times, the state of Qi had villages so close that the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs could be heard from one to the next. The land where nets and traps were set, where plows and hoes struck the earth, spanned over two thousand *li*. Within its four borders, all that was established—ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, the governance of cities, districts, hamlets, and lanes—was it not all modeled after the sages? Yet Tian Chengzi killed the ruler of Qi in a single day and stole the state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also took the sages’ wisdom and laws. Thus Tian Chengzi bore the name of thief and bandit yet lived in the security of Yao and Shun; small states dared not condemn him, and great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held Qi. Was this not stealing the state while also seizing the sages’ wisdom and laws to guard his thieving self?

Let us examine further: is there any so-called supreme wisdom in the common world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there any so-called supreme sage who does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so? In ancient times, Long Feng was disemboweled, Bi Gan was carved open, Chang Hong’s corpse was exposed, and Wu Zixu was torn apart. Thus even the worthiness of these four could not spare them from execution. The followers of Robber Zhi asked him, “Does theft also have a Dao?” Zhi replied, “Where is there anything that does not have a Dao? To guess the treasures hidden in a room is sagacity; to enter first is courage; to withdraw last is righteousness; to know what can and cannot be done is wisdom; to divide spoils equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief.” From this we see: the good man cannot stand without the Dao of the sage, and Robber Zhi cannot act without the Dao of the sage. Since the good are few and the ungood many in the world, the sage benefits the world little but harms it much. Thus it is said: when the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when the wine of Lu was weak, Handan was besieged; when sages arise, great thieves also rise. Strike down the sages, release the thieves and bandits, and the world will begin to be ordered.

When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, deep pools fill. When sages die, great thieves will not arise, and the world will be at peace without incident. As long as sages do not die, great thieves will not cease. To exalt sages in governing the world is to heap profit upon Robber Zhi. Fashion measuring cups to gauge volume, and he will steal the cups along with what they measure; fashion scales to weigh, and he will steal the scales along with what they weigh; fashion tallies and seals to authenticate, and he will steal the tallies and seals along with what they verify; fashion benevolence and righteousness to correct, and he will steal benevolence and righteousness along with what they rectify. How do we know this is so? He who steals a hook is executed; he who steals a state becomes a feudal lord. At the gates of feudal lords, benevolence and righteousness abide. Is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and wisdom? Thus those who chase after great thieves, who exalt feudal lords, who covet the profits of benevolence, righteousness, measuring cups, scales, tallies, and seals—even with the rewards of high rank they cannot be encouraged, nor with the threat of the executioner’s axe can they be restrained. This heaping of profit upon Robber Zhi, making him unstoppable, is the fault of the sages.

Thus it is said: “Fish must not leave the deep; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.” The sage is the state’s sharpest tool, not what should be displayed to the world. Therefore, cut off sagacity and cast aside wisdom, and great thieves will cease; smash jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; smash measuring cups and snap scales, and the people will not contend; annihilate the sages’ laws of the world, and the people will at last be fit for discussion. Uproot the six pitch-pipes, melt the *yu* and *se*, deafen the ears of Music Master Kuang, and the world will begin to preserve its hearing; obliterate patterns and scatter the five colors, blind the eyes of Li Zhu, and the world will begin to preserve its sight; destroy hooks and discard compasses and squares, cripple the fingers of Master Chui, and the world will begin to possess its skill. Thus it is said: “Great skill appears clumsy.” Eradicate the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will begin to achieve mysterious unity.

Those who preserve their sight will not be dazzled by the world; those who preserve their hearing will not be burdened by the world; those who preserve their wisdom will not be deluded by the world; those who preserve their virtue will not be perverse in the world. Zeng, Yang, Mo, Music Master Kuang, Master Chui, and Li Zhu all externally established their virtue to dazzle and confuse the world—useless under the law.

Do you alone not know of the age of utmost virtue? In the times of Rong Cheng, Da Ting, Bo Huang, Zhong Yang, Li Lu, Li Xu, Xuan Yuan, He Xu, Zun Lu, Zhu Rong, Fu Xi, and Shen Nong, the people knotted cords for use. They savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and dwelt content in their homes. Neighboring states were within sight, the sounds of cocks and dogs carried between them, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling. In such an age, there was utmost governance. Now, however, the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “In such-and-such a place there is a worthy,” and they carry provisions to rush there, abandoning their parents at home and neglecting their lords’ affairs abroad. Their footprints crisscross the borders of feudal lords, and their cart tracks weave a thousand *li*.

This is the fault of those above who delight in knowledge. If those above truly favor knowledge while lacking the Dao, then the world will fall into great chaos. How do we know this is so? When the cunning of bows, crossbows, snares, and traps multiplies, birds are thrown into chaos above; when the craft of hooks, baits, nets, weirs, and fish traps proliferates, fish are thrown into chaos in the water; when the devices of snares, fences, nets, and traps abound, beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes. When the shifts of cunning deceit, gradual poison, tangled sophistry, the "hard and white" debate, and the distinctions of "dirt and sameness" multiply, customs are thrown into chaos by disputation.

Thus, the world time and again falls into great disorder, and the blame lies in the love of knowledge. The world knows only to seek what it does not know yet fails to seek what it already knows; it knows only to condemn what it does not deem good yet fails to condemn what it already deems good. Hence the great chaos. Above, it confounds the brightness of sun and moon; below, it scatters the essence of mountains and rivers; in between, it disrupts the operations of the four seasons. Even the timid insects and delicate creatures—none retain their nature. How severe is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge upon the world! This has been the case since the Three Dynasties and after: abandoning the subtle mechanisms of the myriad things, they delight instead in the toiling flattery of the obsequious. Forsaking the tranquil and effortless, they take pleasure in the clamorous clamor of disputation—clamor that has already thrown the world into chaos!

**Chapter 11: "In Yu" (Letting Be and Granting Freedom)**
I have heard of letting the world be and granting it freedom; I have never heard of governing the world. To let it be is to fear that the world will corrupt its nature; to grant it freedom is to fear that the world will alter its virtue. If the world neither corrupts its nature nor alters its virtue, why would one seek to possess it?

In the past, when Yao governed the world, he made the world joyful, each delighting in their nature—yet this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made the world weary, each suffering in their nature—yet this was not contentment. Neither the absence of tranquility nor the absence of contentment is virtue. There has never been a case where what is not virtue could endure.

Does one become greatly joyful? It leans toward yang. Does one become greatly angry? It leans toward yin. When yin and yang are both excessive, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is lost, and it harms the human form. It causes people’s joy and anger to lose their proper place, their dwellings to lack constancy, their thoughts to find no ease, and their ways to become entangled mid-course. Thereupon, the world begins to grow haughty, perverse, and defiant, and only then do the deeds of Robber Zhi, Zeng, and Shi arise.

Thus, if one were to reward all the good in the world, it would not suffice; if one were to punish all the evil in the world, it would not be enough. Therefore, the vastness of the world is insufficient for rewards and punishments. Yet since the Three Dynasties and after, they have clamored endlessly over rewards and punishments—when would they have leisure to settle into the true essence of their natures and lives?

Moreover, do they delight in beauty? This is an indulgence in form. Do they delight in keen hearing? This is an indulgence in sound. Do they delight in benevolence? This disrupts virtue. Do they delight in righteousness? This perverts principle. Do they delight in ritual? This is mutual artifice. Do they delight in music? This is mutual indulgence. Do they delight in sagacity? This is mutual fault-finding. Do they delight in knowledge? This is mutual nitpicking.

If the world seeks to preserve the true essence of its nature and life, these eight may exist or vanish—it matters not. But if the world does not preserve the true essence of its nature and life, these eight begin to carve and hack at it, throwing the world into chaos. And yet the world exalts and cherishes them—how deluded the world has become! Is it merely a matter of recognizing their errors and abandoning them? They warn with words, kneel to present them, and drum and sing to accompany them with dance. What am I to make of this?

Thus, when the noble person is compelled to oversee the world, there is nothing better than non-action. Only through non-action can the true essence of nature and life be preserved. Therefore, one who values their own person over governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their own person over governing the world may be charged with the world.

Thus, if the noble person can refrain from unsettling their five viscera and from flaunting their keen hearing and sight; if they dwell like a corpse yet manifest like a dragon, thunder like thunder, move like a spirit with heaven following, and act with ease and non-action—then the myriad things will be steamed and piled up of their own accord. What leisure would I have to govern the world?

Cui Qu asked Lao Dan, “If one does not govern the world, how can the hearts of the people be settled?” Lao Dan replied, “Be careful not to agitate the human heart. The heart presses downward yet strives upward; above and below, it is imprisoned and slain. Soft and yielding, it overcomes the hard and strong; sharp and incisive, it carves and polishes. Its heat is scorching fire; its cold, congealed ice. In the space between a glance and a breath, it twice traverses beyond the four seas. At rest, it is deep and still; in motion, it soars to heaven. Proud and unbridled, nothing can be bound—is this not the human heart alone?

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Yao and Shun then wore away the flesh of their thighs and the hair of their shins to nourish the forms of the world; they exhausted their five viscera for benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and qi to model laws and standards. Yet they still could not prevail. Thus, Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei, and banished Gong Gong to Youdu—this was their failure to overcome the world. When this spread to the Three Kings, the world was greatly alarmed. Below, there were Jie and Robber Zhi, Zeng and Shi, while the Confucians and Mohists all arose. Thereupon, joy and anger suspected one another, the foolish and the wise deceived one another, the good and the bad condemned one another, the truthful and the deceitful mocked one another—and virtue declined. Great power diverged, and the nature and life of the people scattered and dissolved. The world loved knowledge, and the common people were utterly exhausted.

Thereupon, axes and saws were fashioned, the plumb line was used to kill, and hammers and chisels were employed to decide. The world was thrown into great disorder, and the blame lay in agitating the human heart. Thus, the worthy hid away beneath the cliffs of great mountains, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with anxiety in their ancestral halls.

In the present age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another, those in cangues and stocks jostle one another, and those subjected to corporal punishment are within sight of one another—yet the Confucians and Mohists still stretch on tiptoe and wave their arms amidst the fetters and shackles. Alas, how extreme it has become!

How extreme is their shamelessness in feeling no shame! I know not whether sagely wisdom is not but the crossbeam and pegs of a cangue, whether benevolence and righteousness are not but the shackles and chisel-holes of fetters—how then can one know that Zeng and Shi are not the first arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi! Thus it is said: Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.

After the Yellow Emperor had reigned as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his decrees circulated throughout the world. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelt on Mount Kongtong, he went to see him, saying: “I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the utmost Dao? I wish to draw forth the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the common people. Moreover, I wish to govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition. How may this be done?”

Guangchengzi replied: “What you wish to ask concerns the substance of things; what you wish to govern concerns the remnants of things. Since you began to rule the world, clouds have rained without gathering, plants and trees have withered before yellowing, and the light of the sun has grown ever more dim. With the heart of a flattering sycophant—how could one such as you be fit to speak of the utmost Dao?”

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white couch-grass, and dwelt in seclusion for three months. Then he went again to seek Guangchengzi. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south; the Yellow Emperor approached from the lower side of the wind, crawling on his knees. He bowed, touching his head to the ground, and asked: “I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: how may one cultivate the body so as to attain longevity?”

Guangchengzi sprang up and said: “Excellent, your question! Come, and I shall tell you of the utmost Dao.”

The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and obscure;
Its ultimate reaches are dim and silent.
See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—
Then the body will right itself.
Be still, be pure; do not weary your form,
Do not agitate your essence, and you may attain long life.
Let the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing,
The heart know nothing—then your spirit will guard you,
And your form will endure.
Guard your inner, be cautious of your outer;
Excessive knowledge brings ruin.
For you, I have ascended to the great brightness,
To the source of utmost yang;
For you, I have entered the gate of profound obscurity,
To the source of utmost yin.
Heaven and earth have their offices,
Yin and yang have their treasuries.
Guard your body with care, and things will naturally flourish.
I preserve this and dwell in harmony.
Thus have I cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years,
Yet my form has never decayed.”

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and said:
“Guangchengzi is truly heaven!”

Guangchengzi said: “Come! I shall tell you:
Those things are boundless, yet men deem them finite;
Those things are unfathomable, yet men deem them limited.
One who attains my Dao may become a sovereign above or a king below;
One who loses the Dao may see light above yet become earth below.
Now all the myriad beings are born from earth and return to earth.
Therefore, I shall leave you and enter the gate of the boundless,
To wander the wilds of the limitless.
I share the radiance of the sun and moon,
I endure with heaven and earth.
Approach me, and all is clear!
Withdraw from me, and all is dark!
Men may all perish, yet I alone endure!”

Cloud General was traveling east when he passed the branch of the whirlwind tree and happened upon Hong Meng. Hong Meng was just then slapping his sides, leaping and frolicking in play. Cloud General saw him, halted in surprise, and stood in astonishment, saying: “Old sir, who are you? What are you doing here?”

Hong Meng, still slapping his sides and leaping without pause, replied: “Wandering!”

Cloud General said: “I wish to ask you something.”

Hong Meng looked up at Cloud General and said: “Ah!”

Cloud General said: “Heaven is not harmonious, earth’s qi is pent up, the six qi are unbalanced, the four seasons are out of order. Now I wish to blend the essence of the six qi to nurture the multitude of beings. How may this be done?”

Hong Meng, still slapping his sides and leaping, shook his head and said: “I do not know! I do not know!”

Cloud General could not press his question. Three years later, he was wandering again when he passed through the wilds of Song and once more happened upon Hong Meng. Cloud General rejoiced greatly, hastened forward, and said: “Has heaven forgotten me? Has heaven forgotten me?” He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and wished to hear Hong Meng’s teaching.

Hong Meng said: “Drifting without aim, knowing not what is sought;
Rampant without direction, knowing not where to go;
Restless and distracted, observing what is not false.”

“What do I know!” said Cloud General. “I, too, thought myself reckless, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot be free of them—now they are the ones who have gone astray! I wish to hear a single word.”

Hong Meng said: “To disorder heaven’s warp, to go against the nature of things—even the dark and boundless heavens cannot be brought to completion. To scatter the herds of beasts so that birds cry all night; calamity reaches the grasses and trees, disaster befalls even the still insects. Alas! This is the fault of those who govern men.”

Cloud General said: “Then what am I to do?”

Hong Meng said: “Alas! How poisonous! Off you go, lightly, lightly, back to where you belong.”

Cloud General said: “I have encountered great difficulty from heaven. I wish to hear a single word.”

Hong Meng said: “Alas! Nurture the heart-mind. You need only abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Let your form dissolve, your hearing and sight fade, and forget both human relations and things. Merge utterly with the primal vastness. Unbind the heart-mind, release the spirit, and be empty, without soul. The ten thousand things, drifting like clouds, each return to their root, each return to their root yet know it not. In utter chaos and undifferentiation, you will never depart from it all your life. If you claim to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask its name, do not seek its nature—things will then arise of themselves.”

Cloud General said: “Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me and shown me silence. Through cultivating myself, I have now attained it.” He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, then rose and took his leave.

The common run of men all delight in others being like themselves and detest others differing from themselves. Those who wish others to be like themselves and do not wish them to differ do so with the intent of standing out from the crowd. Yet how can one who takes standing out from the crowd as their aim ever truly stand out? Resting content with the crowd, what they hear cannot surpass the skills of the many.

Those who would rule others’ states grasp at the advantages of the Three Kings yet fail to grasp their troubles. This is to gamble with others’ states. How many such gambles end without the ruin of those states? In preserving others’ states, they succeed not one in ten thousand times; in ruining them, one failure brings ten thousand losses. How lamentable that those who hold land do not understand!

Land is a great thing. Those who possess great things cannot be possessed by things; only by not being things can one master things. To understand that the master of things is not a thing—how could this apply merely to governing the world’s people? Moving in and out of the Six Directions, roaming the Nine Provinces, coming and going alone—this is called “possessing alone.” Those who possess this are called “most noble.”

The teaching of the great person is like the form to its shadow, the sound to its echo. Questioned, they respond, exhausting what lies in their heart-mind, acting for the world. They dwell where there is no echo, move where there is no direction. They lead you to the bustling hub of return, wandering without end; entering and exiting without sides, with the sun having no beginning. In discussing the body, they merge with the Great Sameness, the Great Sameness without self. Without self, how could there be possession? Those who see possession are the gentlemen of old; those who see non-possession are the heavens and earth.

That which is lowly yet cannot be shunned is things; that which is humble yet cannot be disregarded is the people; that which is hidden yet cannot be left undone is affairs; that which is coarse yet cannot be left unpresented is law; that which is distant yet cannot be left unoccupied is rightness; that which is close yet cannot be left unexpanded is benevolence; that which is measured yet cannot be accumulated is ritual; that which is centered yet cannot be left unexalted is virtue; that which is one yet cannot be left unchanged is the Dao; that which cannot be left undone is heaven.

Thus the sage observes heaven yet does not assist, completes virtue yet is not burdened, emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme, meets benevolence yet does not rely, is sparing in action yet does not accumulate, responds to ritual yet does not conceal, engages with affairs yet does not refuse, aligns with law yet is not disordered, depends on the people yet does not belittle, and attends to things yet does not abandon them. Things are never worth acting for, yet cannot be left unacted for. Those who do not understand heaven are not pure in virtue; those who do not penetrate the Dao have no ground to stand on; those who do not understand the Dao—how lamentable!

What is the Dao? There is the Dao of heaven and the Dao of man. That which is honored through non-action is the Dao; that which is burdened through action is the human Dao. The ruler follows the Dao of heaven; the minister follows the Dao of man. The distance between the Dao of heaven and the Dao of man is vast—it cannot go unexamined.

Though heaven and earth are great, their transformations are uniform; though the ten thousand things are many, their governance is one; though the masses of people are numerous, their lord is the ruler. The ruler’s virtue is perfected by heaven. Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action, and that was all—they embodied the virtue of heaven.

Viewing words through the Dao, the world’s rulers are rectified; viewing distinctions, the righteousness of ruler and minister is clarified; viewing abilities through the Dao, the world’s offices are well-ordered; viewing broadly through the Dao, the responses of the ten thousand things are complete. Thus that which penetrates all is virtue; that which moves through the ten thousand things is the Dao; that which governs people above is affairs; that which involves skill is technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by rightness, rightness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by heaven.

Thus it is said: The ancients who nurtured the world had no desires, and the world was sufficient; the ten thousand things transformed, profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled. The *Record* says: “Penetrate the One, and the ten thousand affairs are complete; without intention, one attains it, and even ghosts and spirits submit.”

The Master said: “The Dao—it covers and bears the ten thousand things, vast and boundless! The noble person cannot but hollow out their heart-mind for it. Acting through action is called heaven; speaking through non-action is called virtue; loving people and benefiting things is called benevolence; uniting differences in sameness is called greatness; acting without extreme distinctions is called breadth; possessing the ten thousand differences is called wealth.

Thus holding to virtue is called the guiding principle; completing virtue is called establishment; following the Dao is called fulfillment; not allowing things to thwart one’s will is called wholeness. If you understand these ten, then your mind’s greatness will be profound, and you will flow with the ten thousand things like a surging flood. If so, you will hide gold in the mountains and pearls in the depths, not prizing goods or wealth, not drawing near to nobility or riches; not delighting in long life, not grieving over early death; not exalting success, not ashamed of poverty.”

One does not confine the world’s benefits to one’s private share, nor regard ruling all under Heaven as one’s own exalted position. Exaltation is clarity. The ten thousand things are a single treasury; death and life share the same form.

The Master said: “The Dao—how abysmal its dwelling, how limpid its purity! Without metal or stone, there would be no sound. Thus metal has voice, yet without striking, it does not ring. Who can determine the ten thousand things?

The person of royal virtue moves plainly yet feels shame at entanglement in affairs, establishes the root and origin yet understands their pervasiveness—such virtue is vast. When the heart issues forth, things gather to it. Thus form does not arise without the Dao, and life is not illuminated without virtue. To preserve form and exhaust life, to establish virtue and clarify illumination—is this not the person of royal virtue?

Vast and boundless! Suddenly emerging, suddenly stirring, and the ten thousand things follow—this is the person of royal virtue. Seeing into darkness, listening to silence: within the deepest obscurity, alone one perceives the dawn; within utter silence, alone one hears harmony. Thus the deeper the depth, the more it engenders things; the more divine the divinity, the more it refines essence. Therefore, in its encounter with the ten thousand things, it meets their needs with utmost nothingness, gallops with the seasons to grasp their lodging, embracing the small and great, the short and long, the near and far.”

The Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Waters, ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun and gazed south. Upon returning, he lost his Dark Pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Then he sent Image-Net, and Image-Net found it. The Yellow Emperor said: “Strange indeed! Could only Image-Net obtain it?”

Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi. Yao asked Xu You: “Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him.” Xu You said: “Perilous indeed is the state of the world! Nie Que’s nature—keen of hearing, clear of sight, quick-witted and sharp, his nature surpasses others, yet he still takes man as his measure of Heaven. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgression yet does not know whence transgression arises. Could he be matched with Heaven? He rides upon man yet lacks Heaven. He is about to take the body as root yet differentiate forms, about to exalt knowledge and race like fire, about to be driven by threads, about to be ensnared by things, about to look in all four directions and have things respond, about to respond to every fitting occasion, about to transform with things yet never begin with constancy. How could he be fit to match Heaven?

Nevertheless, he has kin, has ancestors; he may serve as father to the multitude, yet cannot serve as the father of fathers. Governance is the harbinger of chaos, the calamity of facing north, the bane of facing south.” Yao observed the Hua region.

The Hua border guard exclaimed, "Ah, sage! Permit me to invoke blessings upon you: may the sage enjoy longevity." Yao replied, "I decline." "May the sage grow wealthy." Yao replied, "I decline." "May the sage have many sons." Yao said, "I decline." The border guard asked, "Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all men desire. Why do you alone not desire them?" Yao answered, "Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; longevity brings many humiliations. These three are not the means to nurture virtue, so I decline."

The border guard said, "At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven generates the myriad people and must assign them their duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear is there? If you are wealthy and distribute it among others, what affairs remain? The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling, moving like a bird without leaving a trace. When the world follows the Dao, all things flourish together; when the world loses the Dao, he cultivates virtue and retreats to leisure. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs to become an immortal, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. The three calamities never reach him, and his person remains free from harm—what humiliation is there?"

The border guard departed, and Yao followed, saying, "May I ask a question?" The man replied, "Withdraw! This is not your concern."

When Yao governed the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was enfeoffed as a lord. Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, but Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to till the soil. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the fields. Yu hastened to stand downwind and posed his question, saying, "In the past, when Yao governed the world, you served as a lord. Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to me, yet you resigned your lordship to plow. May I ask the reason?"

Bo Cheng Zi Gao replied, "In the past, when Yao governed the world, he did not reward yet the people were encouraged; he did not punish yet the people stood in awe. Now you reward and punish, and the people grow ever less humane. Virtue declines from this, punishments arise from this, and the disorders of later generations begin from this! Why do you linger here? Do not interfere with my work!"

He plowed on, absorbed and unheeding.

In the Great Beginning there was Nonbeing—nonbeing that had no name. The One arose from this, existing yet still formless. When things received this to come into being, it was called their *virtue*; when forms took on distinction yet remained seamless and unbroken, it was called their *fate*; when the ceaseless flux gave rise to things, and things attained their patterns of growth, it was called their *form*; when form and spirit were preserved together, each with its proper measure, it was called their *nature*. Cultivating this nature, one returns to *virtue*; when *virtue* reaches its fullness, one merges with the Beginning. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. Then the beaks join in song; when the beaks join in song, they harmonize with Heaven and Earth. This harmony is profound and subtle, like stupidity or confusion—this is called *mysterious virtue*, merging with the Great Compliance.

Confucius asked Lao Dan, “There is a man who governs the Way as if he were contradicting himself—what is permissible he deems impermissible, what is so he deems not so. A debater once said, ‘Separate hardness and whiteness as if they were suspended in space.’ Can such a one be called a sage?”

Lao Dan replied, “This is the sort of petty clerk whose skills ensnare him, whose body is wearied and whose mind is startled. Such a one grasps at fixed thoughts like a monkey caught in a trap—his agility comes from the mountains and forests. Qiu, let me tell you what you cannot hear and what you cannot speak. Of those with heads and feet but no heart or ears, there are many; of those with form and those without form or shape who all endure, there are none. Their movement is rest; their death is life; their decay is renewal—yet these are not their true source. There is a governance that lies with man: forget things, forget Heaven, and it is called forgetting oneself. The one who forgets himself is said to enter into Heaven.”

Jiang Lümian went to see Ji Che and said, “The Lord of Lu told me, ‘I beg to receive your instruction.’ I could not refuse his command and have already told him what I know—whether it is right or not, I do not know. Let me try to present it to you. I said to the Lord of Lu, ‘You must practice reverence and frugality, uproot partiality and favoritism, and promote those who are publicly loyal—then what people will not be harmonious?’”

Ji Che burst into hearty laughter and said, “If these are your words, then for the virtue of emperors and kings, it is like a mantis raising its arms to block an oncoming chariot—how could it bear the task! Moreover, if it were so, then such a one would place himself in peril, and his observation tower would attract many who come to tread in his footsteps.”

Jiang Lümian started in alarm and said, “I am utterly lost in what you have said! Nevertheless, I beg you to speak of its guiding principles.”

Ji Che said, “When the great sage governs the world, he sways and stirs the hearts of the people, shaping them into teachings and transforming their customs. He eradicates their predatory inclinations and advances their solitary aspirations. He acts thus of his own accord, yet the people remain unaware of how it comes to be. Is this not far removed from the way Yao and Shun instructed the people, treating them as younger kin in a boundless expanse? They sought to align with virtue, and their hearts dwelt in stillness.”

Zigong traveled south to Chu and, on his return to Jin, passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man preparing his garden beds. The man dug a tunnel to enter the well, drew water in a jar, and labored intensely with little result. Zigong said, “There is a device that can irrigate a hundred beds in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not wish to use it?” The gardener looked up and asked, “How does it work?” Zigong replied, “Carve wood into a mechanism—heavy at the front, light at the back—drawing water as if pulling, swift as boiling water. It is called a *gao* (well-sweep).” The gardener flushed with anger, laughed, and said, “I have heard from my teacher that those who possess machines will have mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs will harbor a mechanical heart. A mechanical heart dwelling in the breast disrupts the purity of whiteness; when purity is incomplete, the spirit is unsettled. One whose spirit is unsettled cannot be borne by the Dao. I am not ignorant of such things—I am ashamed to do them.” Zigong, abashed, bowed his head in response.

After a moment, the gardener asked, “What are you doing here?” Zigong replied, “I am a disciple of Confucius.” The gardener said, “Are you not one of those who amass learning to rival the sages, strut about to overshadow the masses, and pluck a single string to sing mournful songs, all to peddle your reputation throughout the world? You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast off your bodily form, and only then might you approach the Way! If you cannot even govern yourself, how can you presume to govern the world? Be on your way and do not hinder my work.” Zigong’s countenance fell, and he walked away ill at ease. Only after thirty *li* did he recover.

His disciples asked, “Who was that man just now? Why did you lose composure before him and remain unsettled for the rest of the day?” Zigong replied, “At first, I thought there was only one true person in the world—I did not know there was another like him. I have heard from the Master that in affairs, one seeks what is feasible; in achievements, one seeks completion. To expend little effort and achieve much is the Way of the sage. Yet this is not so. One who holds to the Dao attains wholeness in virtue; wholeness in virtue brings wholeness in form; wholeness in form brings wholeness in spirit. Wholeness in spirit is the Way of the sage. Such a one entrusts life to the people, moving alongside them without knowing where they go, vast and complete! Those who pursue profit, skill, and cunning must forget the heart of such a person. For one like him, nothing but his own will moves him, and nothing but his own heart compels him to act. Even if the world were offered to him, if it accorded with his principles, he would remain aloof; if the world rejected him, if it contradicted his principles, he would remain unmoved. The world’s praise or blame adds nothing to him—this is what it means to be a person of complete virtue! I am but a wanderer tossed by the winds and waves.”

Returning to Lu, Zigong reported this to Confucius. Confucius said, “That man was but a dabbler in the arts of the Hun clan. He grasps one aspect but ignores the rest; he cultivates his inner self but neglects the outer.”

Those who attain clarity and return to simplicity, who practice non-action and embrace the spirit, wandering amidst the world’s customs—would you truly be so astonished? As for the arts of the Hun Dun clan, how could you or I presume to comprehend them?

Zhun Mang was traveling east toward the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuan Feng asked, “Where are you going?” Zhun Mang replied, “To the Great Abyss.” “What will you do there?” “The Great Abyss is such a thing—pour into it and it never fills, draw from it and it never empties. I will wander there.” Yuan Feng said, “Do you have no concern for the people of the cross-eyed world? I wish to hear of sagely governance.” Zhun Mang said, “Sagely? The sage appoints officials without error, promotes the capable without oversight, fully perceives the circumstances and acts accordingly. His words arise from himself, yet the world is transformed. With a wave of his hand, the people of the four directions all come—this is what sagely governance means.”

“I wish to hear of the virtuous person.” “The virtuous person dwells without thought or worry, harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. When all within the four seas share in benefit, this is called joy; when all are provided for, this is called peace. He is forlorn as an infant who has lost its mother, bewildered as a traveler who has lost his way. Wealth and resources are abundant, yet he does not know their source; food and drink suffice, yet he does not know their origin—this is the bearing of the virtuous person.”

“I wish to hear of the spirit person.” “The supreme spirit person rides the light, and with the vanishing of form, this is called illuminating the vast. He fulfills his mandate and exhausts his nature; heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve. The ten thousand things return to their true nature—this is called primordial obscurity.”

Men Wu Gui and Chi Zhang Manji observed the armies of King Wu. Chi Zhang Manji said, “He does not measure up to the Yu clan—hence this calamity!” Wu Gui said, “Was the world well-governed and then the Yu clan governed it? Or was it in chaos and then they brought order?” Chi Zhang Manji replied, “A well-governed world is the wish—why calculate the Yu clan’s role! The Yu clan’s remedies are like treating sores: shaving the head to apply medicine, seeking help only when ill. A filial son administers medicine to his compassionate father, his face scorched with worry—this the sage finds shameful.

In an age of utmost virtue, worthies are not exalted, abilities are not employed. Superiors are like branches, the people like wild deer. They are upright yet do not consider it righteousness, they love one another yet do not consider it benevolence, they are sincere yet do not consider it loyalty, they are trustworthy yet do not consider it faithfulness. They move and work together without thought of reward. Thus their actions leave no traces, their affairs no records.”

A filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial conduct. If he agrees with his parents’ words and approves their good deeds, the world calls him an unworthy son. If he agrees with his lord’s words and approves his good deeds, the world calls him an unworthy minister. Yet how can one be certain this is necessarily so? When the world calls something right and one agrees, or calls something good and one approves, they do not call him a flatterer! Does custom then revere parents and honor lords more strictly?

When one calls another ‘enlightened,’ they bristle with anger; when one calls another a flatterer, they flush with indignation. Yet they spend their lives calling others ‘enlightened,’ spend their lives being called so, gathering crowds with polished words and parables—from beginning to end, root and branch, they never reflect. They drape themselves in robes, adorn themselves with colors, alter their expressions to ingratiate themselves with the world, yet do not call themselves flatterers. Associating with such people, debating right and wrong, yet not considering themselves common—this is the height of folly.

To know one’s folly is great folly; to know one’s confusion is not to be free of confusion. The greatly confused never awaken; the greatly foolish remain foolish all their lives. If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for the confused are few. If two are confused, the effort is laborious and the goal unattained, for the confused prevail. Now, with the whole world confused, though I seek a response, how can it be obtained? Is this not lamentable?

Grand music does not enter the ears of the village; Yang Zhu and Mo Di are met with scornful laughter. Thus lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the common; ultimate words are unspoken, for vulgar words prevail. With two clanging bells, the path is lost—how much more so with the whole world confused! Though I seek a response, how can it be obtained? To know it is possible and yet force it is yet another confusion! Better to let go and not press. If one does not press, who shares the worry?

A man from Li, awakened at midnight to the birth of his child, hastily lit a torch to examine it, anxious only that it might resemble himself. A hundred-year-old tree, carved into a sacrificial vessel, painted with green and yellow patterns—its offcuts lie discarded in the ditch. Compared to the sacrificial vessel, the offcuts in the ditch differ in beauty and ugliness, yet in losing their nature they are the same. Robber Zhi and the sages Zeng and Shi differ in conduct, yet in losing their nature they are equal.

Now, the ways of losing one’s nature are five: first, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them blind; second, the five sounds confuse the ears, making them deaf; third, the five odors choke the nose, congesting the forehead; fourth, the five flavors dull the mouth, making it numb and tasteless; fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature. These five are all harms to life. Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di leap and prance, believing they have attained something—this is not what I call attainment.

If what is confined can be called attainment, then the owl in its cage has also attained. Moreover, chasing after sounds and colors to clutter the inner self, donning caps of skin and crane feathers, tucking tablets into sashes and straightening long robes to constrain the outer—this is not the Way.”

The inner self, clogged with entanglements, and the outer, bound by cords and snares—yet one glories in the snares, believing oneself to have attained. If so, then prisoners with arms pinioned and fingers dislocated, or tigers and leopards trapped in sacks and cages, could also be said to have attained!

**Chapter 13: The Dao of Heaven**

The Dao of Heaven moves without accumulation, and so the myriad things are completed. The Dao of the Emperor moves without accumulation, and so the world submits. The Dao of the Sage moves with accumulation, and so all within the seas obeys.

One who is enlightened by Heaven and attuned to the Sage, whose six senses and four limbs are aligned with the virtue of emperors and kings—such a one, in self-cultivation, is serene, with nothing unsettled.

The Sage’s stillness is not because stillness is good, and thus still; rather, with nothing in the myriad things to disturb the heart, stillness follows. When water is still, it clearly reflects beard and brows, and its level serves as a standard—even master craftsmen take it as their model. If still water is so luminous, how much more so the spirit! How still, then, is the Sage’s heart! It is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking-glass of the myriad things.

For emptiness, stillness, tranquility, serenity, and non-action are the leveling of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of the Dao and its virtue. Thus do emperors, kings, and sages rest in them. Resting in them is emptiness; emptiness is fullness; fullness is order. Emptiness is stillness; stillness is movement; movement is attainment. Stillness is non-action; if there is action, then those who take up affairs bear responsibility. In non-action, there is ease. Ease means that cares and troubles cannot abide, and life is long.

Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, serenity, and non-action are the nurturing of the myriad things. Illuminating this and facing south, Yao became a ruler; illuminating this and facing north, Shun became a minister. Practicing this in high position, one becomes an emperor, king, or Son of Heaven; practicing this in low position, one follows the Dao of the obscure sage and plain king. Retiring to leisurely wander by rivers and seas, recluses of mountains and forests submit to it; advancing to serve the age, one’s achievements are great, one’s name illustrious, and the world is unified.

Still, one is a sage; in motion, a king. In non-action, one is revered; in simplicity, none in the world can rival one’s beauty.

One who clearly understands the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root and great origin, one who harmonizes with Heaven. It is the means by which the world is balanced and harmonized with others. Harmonizing with others is called human joy; harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.

Zhuangzi said: “My master! My master! You pulverize the myriad things yet are not cruel, your blessings extend to ten thousand generations yet you are not benevolent, you are older than high antiquity yet not long-lived, you cover and bear Heaven and Earth, carve and adorn the multitude yet are not skillful.” This is called Heavenly joy.

Thus it is said: “One who knows Heavenly joy moves with the Heavenly course in life and transforms with things in death. In stillness, one is one with the Yin; in motion, one is one with the Yang.” Therefore, one who knows Heavenly joy has no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no encumbrance from things, and no reproach from spirits.

Thus it is said: “In movement, one is Heaven; in stillness, Earth. With a single heart settled, one rules the world. Spirits do not haunt, the soul is not wearied, and with a single heart settled, the myriad things submit.” This means applying emptiness and stillness to penetrate Heaven and Earth and communicate with the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the Sage’s heart, by which the world is nurtured.

The virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and its virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, one employs others and has abundance; in action, one is employed by the world and is insufficient. Thus did the ancients value non-action.

The ruler practices non-action, and the subjects also practice non-action, sharing the same virtue. When subjects share the same virtue as the ruler, they do not serve as ministers. When subjects act, and the ruler also acts, the ruler shares the same path as the subjects. When the ruler shares the path, he does not govern. The ruler must practice non-action and employ the world; the subjects must act and be employed by the world. This is the unchanging Dao.

Thus the kings of old, though their knowledge embraced Heaven and Earth, did not scheme for themselves; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not speak for themselves; though their abilities exhausted all within the seas, they did not act for themselves. Heaven transforms the myriad things, Earth nurtures them without growing, and emperors and kings achieve success through non-action.

Thus it is said: “None is more divine than Heaven, none richer than Earth, none greater than emperors and kings.” Thus it is said: “The virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth.” This is the Dao of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the human multitude.

The root lies above, the branches below; the essential lies with the ruler, the details with the ministers. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is a branch of virtue; rewards and punishments, advantages and harms, the application of punishments—these are branches of governance. Ritual, laws, measures, and regulations, the comparison and verification of forms and names—these are branches of order. The sounds of bells and drums, the postures of feathered banners—these are branches of music. Weeping and wailing, mourning garments, the gradations of severity—these are branches of mourning. These five branches require the operation of spirit and the guidance of the heart’s art before they can be followed.

Branches were known to the ancients, but they were not what came first. The ruler leads, and the minister follows; the father leads, and the son follows; the elder brother leads, and the younger follows; the elder leads, and the younger follows; the man leads, and the woman follows. This precedence of honor and rank is the course of Heaven and Earth, and thus the Sage takes it as a model.

Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—this is the position of the divine and bright. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad transformations arise, each with its form; flourishing and decline, growth and decay—these are the currents of change. Though Heaven and Earth are most divine, they have a sequence of honor and precedence—how much more so the human Dao!

In ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in courts, rank is honored; in villages and districts, age is honored; in affairs, worthiness is honored—this is the sequence of the great Dao. To speak of the Dao without its sequence is not the Dao; to speak of the Dao and not follow the Dao—how can one grasp the Dao!

Thus, those of ancient times who illuminated the great Dao first illuminated Heaven, and only then did they order it with virtue and power. Once virtue and power were illuminated, benevolence and righteousness followed. Once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, the division of duties followed. Once the division of duties was illuminated, forms and names followed. Once forms and names were illuminated, the assignment of tasks followed. Once the assignment of tasks was illuminated, the examination of origins followed. Once the examination of origins was illuminated, right and wrong followed. Once right and wrong were illuminated, rewards and punishments followed. Once rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise found their proper places, the noble and the base assumed their positions, the benevolent and the worthless revealed their natures, and each was assigned according to ability, following their names.

By this, one serves superiors; by this, one nurtures inferiors; by this, one governs things; by this, one cultivates the self. Scheming and calculation are set aside, and one must return to Heaven. This is called Great Peace, the ultimate of governance.

Thus, the ancient texts say: *"There are forms, there are names."* Forms and names existed among the ancients, but they were not primary. Those who spoke of the great Dao in ancient times could discuss forms and names only after five transformations, and rewards and punishments only after nine transformations. To rush to speak of names without knowing their root, or to rush to speak of rewards and punishments without knowing their beginning—this is to speak against the Dao, to expound contrary to the Way. Such a person may be governed, but how can they govern others? To rush to speak of forms, names, rewards, and punishments is to possess the tools of governance but not the Dao of governance. Such a one may be employed by the world, but cannot truly employ the world. This is called a disputatious scholar, a man of partial understanding.

Rites, laws, measures, and detailed comparisons of forms and names existed among the ancients. These are what inferiors use to serve superiors, not what superiors use to nurture inferiors.

Formerly, Shun asked Yao: *"How does the Son of Heaven employ his mind?"* Yao said: *"I do not disdain the helpless, nor abandon the destitute. I grieve for the dead, cherish the young, and pity women—this is how I employ my mind."* Shun said: *"It is fine, but not yet great."* Yao asked: *"Then what should I do?"* Shun said: *"Embody Heavenly virtue and emerge in tranquility. Sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed—like the constancy of day and night, like clouds moving and rain falling."* Yao said: *"How entangled and troubled I am! You are in harmony with Heaven; I am merely in harmony with men."*

Heaven and Earth were what the ancients revered most, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised together. Thus, how did the ancients rule all under Heaven? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.

Confucius traveled west to deposit his books in the Zhou archives. Zilu advised: *"I have heard that the Zhou’s Keeper of Archives has an elder named Lao Dan, who has retired and lives at home. If you wish to deposit your books, perhaps you should visit him."* Confucius said: *"Very well."* He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him. Lao Dan interrupted: *"This is too verbose. I would hear the essentials."* Confucius said: *"The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness."* Lao Dan asked: *"Are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?"* Confucius said: *"Indeed. Without benevolence, a lord cannot succeed; without righteousness, he cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of man—what more is needed?"* Lao Dan said: *"Tell me, what are benevolence and righteousness?"* Confucius said: *"To delight in the center of things, to love universally without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness."* Lao Dan said: *"Alas, these are but later words! Universal love—is this not impractical? Without partiality—this is still partiality. If you wish to ensure that the world does not lose its shepherd, then know that Heaven and Earth already have their constancy, sun and moon already have their brightness, stars and constellations already have their order, beasts already have their herds, and trees already stand firm. You should follow virtue and act, wander freely and proceed—this is perfection. Why must you clamor about benevolence and righteousness like one beating a drum to seek a lost child? Alas, you confuse human nature!"*

Shi Chengqi came to see Laozi and said: *"I have heard that you are a sage. I did not hesitate to travel a great distance to see you, enduring a hundred blisters without rest. Now I observe you, and you are no sage! You leave surplus vegetables in the rat’s nest while abandoning your younger sister—this is not benevolence! Before you, raw and cooked foods are not exhausted, yet you hoard without limit."* Laozi remained silent and did not respond.

The next day, Shi Chengqi came again and said: *"Yesterday, I reproached you, but today my heart is at peace. Why is this?"* Laozi said: *"Those who are skillful, wise, spirit-like, and sagely—I consider myself free of such labels. Formerly, you called me an ox, and I accepted the name; you called me a horse, and I accepted the name. If one truly possesses the reality, yet refuses the name given by others, one invites misfortune. I wear my constant garb, and in this garb, I find my constancy."*

Shi Chengqi stepped aside to avoid his shadow, then advanced and asked: *"How ought one cultivate the self?"* Laozi said: *"Your countenance is haughty, your gaze piercing, your forehead protruding, your mouth gaping, your demeanor fierce—like a tethered horse held in check. Movement is restraint; action is mechanism. You scrutinize with cunning and perceive only excess. All this betrays a lack of trustworthiness. At the borders, there are those called thieves."*

Laozi continued: *"The Dao—it does not end in the great, nor does it abandon the small, so all things are complete within it. Vast and boundless, nothing does it not embrace; deep and unfathomable, it cannot be measured. Forms, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the outermost branches of spirit—who but the perfected person can stabilize them? The perfected person possesses the world, yet how great is this! It is not enough to burden them. The world brandishes power, yet they do not join in its sway. They discern the unborrowed and do not shift with profit, attaining the truth of things and preserving their essence. Thus, they place heaven and earth outside themselves, leave the myriad things behind, and are never constrained. They penetrate the Dao, unite with virtue, harmonize with benevolence and righteousness, and submit to ritual and music—such is the settled mind of the perfected person!"*

What the world values as the Dao is but writing. Writing is no more than speech, and speech has its value. What is valued in speech is meaning, yet meaning follows what cannot be transmitted. What meaning follows cannot be conveyed in words, yet the world prizes words and transmits texts. Though the world values them, they are still not worthy of value—for what they value is not true value. What can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas! The world takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the essence of things. Yet if forms, colors, names, and sounds are truly insufficient to grasp that essence, then the knowing do not speak, and the speaking do not know—how could the world recognize this?

Duke Huan was reading in the hall when Wheelwright Bian, carving a wheel below, set down his mallet and chisel and ascended. The duke asked: *"May I ask what words you are reading?"* The duke replied: *"The words of sages."* Bian said: *"Are the sages still alive?"*

The duke said: *"They are long dead."*
Bian said: *"Then what Your Grace reads are but the dregs and husks of the ancients!"*

Duke Huan said: *"How dare a wheelwright pass judgment on what I read! If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you die!"*
Wheelwright Bian replied: *"Your servant observes this from his own craft. When carving a wheel, if the stroke is too slow, it is smooth but lacks firmness; if too swift, it is labored and fails to penetrate. Neither too slow nor too swift—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart, yet the mouth cannot express it. There is a rhythm that resides in the space between. I cannot make my son understand it, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, though I am seventy and grow old carving wheels, the ancients and what they could not transmit have perished with them. Then what Your Grace reads are but the dregs and husks of the ancients!"*

**Chapter Fourteen: "Heaven’s Revolution" (from *Book Five, Part Two*)**

Does Heaven revolve? Does Earth revolve? Do the sun and moon contend for their places? Who directs this? Who binds it in order? Who propels and enacts it? Is there some mechanism that compels it, unable to cease? Or does it turn of itself, unable to halt? Do clouds make rain? Or does rain make clouds? Who sends forth this abundance? Who, dwelling in idleness, indulges in pleasure and thus urges it on? Winds rise from the north, now west, now east, drifting aloft in restless motion. Who exhales and inhales them? Who, dwelling in idleness, stirs and scatters them? I venture to ask: what is the reason for all this?

Wu Xian said: *"Come! Let me tell you."*

"Heaven possesses the Five Constants in their ultimate measure; when emperors and kings align with them, there is order, and when they oppose them, there is misfortune. The affairs of the Nine Cauldrons, when governance is perfected and virtue complete, serve as a mirror to illuminate the lands below, and the world bears them aloft—this is called the Supreme August."

The Grand Steward Dang of Shang asked Zhuangzi about *ren* (benevolence).
Zhuangzi said: "Tigers and wolves possess *ren*."
Dang asked: "What do you mean?"
Zhuangzi replied: "Father and son cherish one another—how is this not *ren*?"
Dang said: "May I ask about perfect *ren*?"
Zhuangzi said: "Perfect *ren* has no partiality."
The Grand Steward said: "I have heard that without partiality there is no love, and without love there is no filial piety. Do you mean that perfect *ren* is unfilial?"
Zhuangzi said: "Not so. Perfect *ren* is lofty indeed—filial piety is hardly sufficient to describe it. This is not a matter of surpassing filial piety, but of falling short of it. Consider one traveling south to Ying: though facing Mount Ming, they do not see it—why? Because it lies too far away. Thus it is said: Reverent filial piety is easy; loving filial piety is difficult. Loving filial piety is easy; forgetting is difficult. Forgetting one’s kin is easy; making one’s kin forget oneself is difficult. Making one’s kin forget oneself is easy; forgetting the world entirely is difficult. Forgetting the world entirely is easy; making the world forget oneself is difficult. The virtue of Yao and Shun was cast aside and not clung to; their beneficence spread across the age, yet the world took no notice—how could this be merely a sigh over *ren* and filial piety? Filial devotion, fraternal respect, *ren*, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exertions that enslave one’s virtue, and are not worth exalting. Thus it is said: The most noble renders state rank obsolete; the most wealthy renders state wealth obsolete; the most aspiring renders fame obsolete. Only the Dao remains unchanging."

Beimen Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor, saying: "When Your Majesty performed the *Xianchi* music in the wilds of Dongting, at first I heard it and was afraid; hearing it again, I was bewildered; hearing it to the end, I was lost—adrift and silent, no longer myself."

The Emperor said: "You were indeed so! I performed it with man, harmonized it with Heaven, conducted it with ritual propriety, and established it with the Great Purity. The four seasons arise in succession, and the myriad things follow their birth; now flourishing, now declining, the patterns of civil and martial order unfold; now clear, now turbid, yin and yang blend in harmony, their radiance flowing in sound. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder; its end has no tail, its beginning no head; now dying, now living, now collapsing, now rising. What is constant knows no end, yet one cannot await its singular moment—this is why you were afraid.

I then performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illumined it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard, transforming in unity, not bound to old constancy. Valleys fill valleys, pits fill pits; it seals crevices and guards the spirit, taking things as its measure. Its tones are expansive, its name lofty and bright. Thus do ghosts and spirits guard its depths, while sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. I halt it at the bounded, yet let it flow into the boundless. You wish to ponder it but cannot know it, to gaze upon it but cannot see it, to pursue it but cannot catch it—suddenly standing on the Way of the four voids, leaning on a withered catalpa and chanting. Your eyes fail before what you wish to see, your strength is exhausted before what you wish to pursue. I too can no longer reach it! Emptiness and stillness—only then does it come, winding and yielding. You, yielding, thus grow idle.

I then performed it with sounds of no idleness, attuned it to the mandate of nature. Thus it chases after thickets, forests rejoice yet have no form; it spreads and scatters without trailing, dark and dim yet soundless. Moving without direction, dwelling in profound obscurity—some call it life, some call it substance, some call it glory. Flowing, dispersing, shifting, it does not adhere to constant sound. The world doubts it, seeking verification from the sage. The sage penetrates to the truth of things and fulfills the mandate. The heavenly mechanism is not displayed, yet the five officials are all complete. This is called the music of Heaven, which delights the heart without words."

Thus did the Lord of Yan extol it, saying:
*"Hearing it, one does not hear its sound;
Seeing it, one does not see its form.
It fills Heaven and Earth,
Envelops the six directions."*
One wishes to listen but finds no point of contact—this is why you were bewildered.

Music begins with fear; fear gives rise to reverence. I then followed it with idleness; idleness gives rise to escape. Finally, it ends in confusion; confusion gives rise to foolishness. Foolishness gives rise to the Dao, and the Dao can be borne and journeyed with together."

Confucius journeyed west to Wei, and Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, saying: "What do you make of our Master’s conduct?"

Shi Jin replied: "Alas! Your Master is doomed to failure!"

Yan Yuan said: "Why?"

Shi Jin said: "Before the straw dogs are set out for the sacrifice, they are stored in fine baskets, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the invocator fasts and purifies himself to present them. But once they have been set out, passersby trample their heads and spines, and gatherers take them to burn as fuel. If one were to gather them again, place them in fine baskets, wrap them in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath them, one would not dream—yet surely suffer frequent nightmares.

Now your Master has taken the straw dogs of the former kings, already set out, and gathers his disciples to wander and rest beneath them. Thus he was driven to fell a tree in Song, erase his tracks in Wei, and in Shang and Zhou—was this not his dream? Besieged between Chen and Cai, seven days without cooked food, life and death as neighbors—was this not his nightmare?

In water, nothing surpasses the use of a boat; on land, nothing surpasses the use of a cart. To take a boat, fit for water, and seek to push it on land is to spend a lifetime moving no more than a few paces. Are not past and present as different as water and land? Zhou and Lu as different as cart and boat? To insist on practicing Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious yet fruitless, and one’s person will surely suffer harm. He does not understand the transmission without fixed method, responding to things without exhaustion.

Have you alone not seen the well-sweep? Pulled, it bows; released, it rises. What pulls it is not pulling *it*—thus it bows and rises without offending anyone.

The rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for their sameness but for their efficacy in governance. Thus the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are like the crabapple, pear, orange, and pomelo—their flavors differ, yet all are palatable. Thus rites, righteousness, laws, and standards are things that change with the times.

If you take a monkey and dress it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it will bite, tear, and rend them, casting them off entirely before it is satisfied. To observe the differences between past and present is like seeing the difference between a monkey and the Duke of Zhou.

When Xishi was afflicted with heart pain and knit her brows in her village, the ugly women of her village saw it and thought it beautiful. Returning home, they too clutched their hearts and knit their brows. The rich men of the village, seeing this, barred their doors and refused to come out; others, seeing it, took their wives and children and fled. They knew that knitting the brows was beautiful but did not know *why* it was beautiful.

Alas! Your Master is doomed to failure!"

At fifty-one, Confucius had still not heard the Dao, so he journeyed south to Pei to see Lao Dan.

Lao Dan said: "Have you come? I am a worthy man of the north—have you attained the Dao?"

Confucius said: "Not yet."

Lao Dan said: "How have you sought it?"

"I sought it in measures and calculations, but after five years I had not attained it."

Lao Dan said: "How else have you sought it?"

"I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I had still not attained it."

Lao Dan said: "Just so. If the Dao could be offered, there is no one who would not offer it to their lord; if it could be presented, there is no one who would not present it to their parents; if it could be told, there is no one who would not tell it to their brothers; if it could be given, there is no one who would not give it to their children and grandchildren. Yet it cannot—there is no other reason: within, there is no master to hold it, and without, no standard to guide it.

That which issues from within is not received from without—the sage does not go forth. That which enters from without finds no master within—the sage does not conceal it. Fame is a public vessel; one cannot take too much of it. Benevolence and righteousness are the temporary lodgings of the former kings—one may stay a single night but cannot dwell there long. To encounter them and demand much is to invite reproach.

The perfected people of old followed the Dao in benevolence, lodged in righteousness as a temporary abode, and roamed the wilds of carefree wandering. They ate from the fields of simplicity, stood in the gardens of non-transaction. Carefree wandering is non-action; simplicity is ease of nourishment; non-transaction is no expenditure. The ancients called this ‘the wandering of gathering authenticity.’

Those who take wealth as right can yield it; those who take prominence as right cannot yield fame."

Those who cling to power cannot share authority with others—grasping it, they tremble; relinquishing it, they grieve, yet remain utterly blind, fixated on what never ceases. These are the people Heaven condemns.

Resentment and favor, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of governance. Only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said: "To govern is to rectify." If one’s heart does not accept this, the gate will not open.

Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: "When chaff gets in the eye, heaven and earth and the four directions seem to shift places; when a mosquito bites the skin, one cannot sleep all night. Benevolence and righteousness are just as grating—they agitate my heart, and no disorder is greater. You, sir, would have the world not lose its simplicity. Let me move like the wind and stand by virtue’s sum! Why must you strain so, like one carrying a great drum in search of a lost child?

The egret does not bathe daily yet remains white; the crow is black without dye. The simplicity of black and white is not worth debating; the spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. When the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on dry land, moistening one another with spittle—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes."

Confucius left Lao Dan and did not speak for three days.

The disciple asked, "Master, when you met Lao Dan, what counsel did you receive?"

Confucius said, "Only now have I truly seen the dragon! The dragon coalesces into form, disperses into pattern, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gapes open, yet I cannot speak—what counsel could I offer Lao Dan?"

Zigong said, "Then are there indeed men who dwell like corpses yet manifest as dragons, rumble like thunder yet remain as silent as the abyss, and move like heaven and earth? Might I witness such a one?"

Thereupon, he announced Confucius’s name to Lao Dan. Lao Dan was just then reclining in his hall when he responded faintly, "My years have advanced and departed—what would you caution me about?"

Zigong said, "The governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors differed, yet their reputations were equally exalted. Why, then, do you alone deem them not sages?"

Lao Dan said, "Young man, come closer! Why do you say they differed?"

Zigong replied, "Yao abdicated to Shun, Shun to Yu. Yu relied on force, while Tang used arms. King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose him, and King Wu opposed Zhou without consenting to him—hence, they differed."

Lao Dan said, "Young man, come closer, and I will tell you of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors’ governance of the world. In the Yellow Emperor’s rule, the people’s hearts were unified; when their parents died, they did not weep, and none condemned them. Under Yao’s rule, he made the people’s hearts affectionate; when they killed their parents, none condemned them. Under Shun’s rule, he made the people’s hearts competitive; pregnant women bore children at ten months, and infants spoke at five months. Before they reached maturity, people began to die young. Under Yu’s rule, he made the people’s hearts mutable; men had their own minds, and weapons had their own order. Killing thieves was not considered killing—each acted for himself, and the world was thus. Therefore, the world was greatly alarmed, and the Confucians and Mohists arose. Their beginnings had some order, yet now, what can be said of women? I tell you, the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was called ‘order,’ yet no disorder was greater. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of the sun and moon above, disrupted the essence of rivers below, and threw the seasons’ operations into chaos. Their knowledge was as cruel as the sting of scorpions and centipedes, as the fangs of venomous beasts. None could preserve their nature and destiny in tranquility, yet they still called themselves sages—is this not shameful? Truly, they knew no shame!"

Zigong stood uneasily, shifting his feet. Confucius said to Lao Dan, "I have studied the Six Classics—*The Odes*, *The Documents*, *The Rites*, *The Music*, *The Changes*, and *The Spring and Autumn*—for a long time and have thoroughly grasped their principles. I have advised seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the traces of the Zhou and Shao, yet not one ruler has adopted them. How difficult it is to persuade others! Is the Dao so hard to illuminate?"

Lao Dan said, "Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler who governs! The Six Classics are but the worn traces of the former kings—how could they be the true source of those traces? What you speak of are merely traces. Traces are what the foot leaves behind—how could the foot itself be the trace? The white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils unmoving, yet the wind transforms them. Insects, the male chirping upwind, the female responding downwind, are transformed. Each species has its own male and female, and thus the wind transforms them. Nature cannot be altered, destiny cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, nothing is impossible; if one loses it, nothing is possible."

Confucius did not go out for three months, then saw Laozi again and said, "I have attained it! The crows and magpies rear their young, fish scatter foam, wasps transform the slender-waisted, and when a younger brother is born, the elder weeps. For so long, I have not been one with transformation as a human! If one is not one with transformation as a human, how can one transform others?" Laozi said, "Good! You have grasped it, Qiu!"

**Chapter Fifteen: "Cultivating the Mind"**

Those who cultivate the mind and esteem conduct, distancing themselves from the world and differing from common customs, who engage in lofty discourse and resentful slander, do so merely to be aloof. These are the scholars of mountain valleys, not the people of the world—what those who wither and plunge into the abyss delight in.

Those who speak of benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust, reverence and frugality, deference and yielding, do so to cultivate themselves. These are the scholars of a peaceful age, the teachers and instructors, what those who wander and dwell in learning delight in.

Those who speak of great achievements, establishing great names, honoring ruler and minister, rectifying superior and inferior, do so merely to govern. These are the scholars of the court, the men who honor their lord and strengthen their state, what those who seek merit and annex territory delight in.

Those who approach marshes, dwell in leisure and openness, fish and idle, do so merely to be without action. These are the scholars of rivers and seas, those who avoid the world, what the leisurely delight in.

Those who blow and exhale, expel the old and draw in the new, imitate the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching, do so merely to prolong life. These are the practitioners of Daoist arts, those who nurture the body, what those who venerate longevity delight in.

But those who are lofty without cultivating the mind, cultivated without benevolence and righteousness, governed without merit and fame, at leisure without rivers and seas, long-lived without Daoist arts—nothing is not forgotten, yet nothing is not possessed. Serene and boundless, all beauties follow. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.

Thus it is said: That which is tranquil, still, silent, and empty, without action—this is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the essence of the Dao and virtue.

Thus it is said: When the sage rests in ease, he is level and yielding. Being level and yielding, he is tranquil and indifferent. Being level, yielding, tranquil, and indifferent, worries and misfortunes cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole and his spirit is not diminished.

Thus it is said: The sage’s life follows the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares the virtue of yin; in motion, he moves with the wave of yang. He does not precede fortune, nor initiate calamity. He responds only after being moved, acts only under compulsion, and rises only when there is no alternative. Abandoning knowledge and contrivance, he follows the principle of Heaven.

Thus he suffers no heavenly disasters, no encumbrances from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. His life is like floating; his death is like resting. He does not scheme or plan. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not bound by expectation. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he has no worries. His spirit is pure and unadulterated; his soul does not weary. Empty, tranquil, and indifferent, he accords with the virtue of Heaven.

Thus it is said: Sorrow and joy are the perversions of virtue; delight and anger are the transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes are the loss of virtue. Thus, a heart without sorrow or joy is the perfection of virtue; unity without change is the perfection of stillness; nothing to oppose is the perfection of emptiness; no interaction with things is the perfection of indifference; nothing to resist is the perfection of purity.

Thus it is said: If the body labors without rest, it becomes exhausted; if essence is used without ceasing, it becomes fatigued; fatigue leads to depletion.

The nature of water is such that if it is not mixed, it is clear; if it is not disturbed, it is level. If it is pent up and does not flow, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of the virtue of Heaven.

Thus it is said: Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, indifferent and without action, moving in accordance with the movement of Heaven—this is the way to nurture the spirit.

Those who possess the swords of Gan and Yue keep them in a box and do not dare to use them—they treasure them to the utmost. When the spirit flows in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit, above touching Heaven, below coiling upon the Earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things without taking form—its name is "Uniting with the Lord." The Dao of purity and simplicity guards the spirit. Guard it and do not lose it, and you become one with the spirit. The essence of unity penetrates, harmonizing with the heavenly order.

A rustic saying goes: "The common people value profit; the incorruptible value fame; the worthy esteem will; the sage treasures essence." Thus, "simplicity" means having nothing mixed with it; "purity" means not diminishing one’s spirit. One who embodies purity and simplicity is called a "true person."

**Chapter Sixteen: "Mending the Nature"**

To mend one’s nature in accordance with custom, learning to seek to return to one’s original state; to be confused by desires in accordance with custom, thinking to seek to attain clarity—this is called being obscured and deluded.

The ancients who cultivated the Dao used tranquility to nurture knowledge. To be born and not use knowledge is called using knowledge to nurture tranquility. Knowledge and tranquility mutually nurture each other, and harmony emerges from one’s nature.

Virtue is harmony; the Dao is principle. Virtue admits of no exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao leaves nothing unprincipled—this is righteousness. Righteousness being clear, things become intimate—this is loyalty. Being centered, pure, and returning to reality—this is joy. Trust in conduct, accommodating in form, and following pattern—this is ritual. When ritual and music are universally practiced, the world falls into chaos.

If one rectifies oneself and obscures one’s virtue, virtue will not be overbearing. If it is overbearing, things will surely lose their nature.

In ancient times, people dwelled in the midst of vagueness, attaining indifference with their age. At that time, yin and yang were harmonious and still, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept to their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, and the multitude of living beings did not die prematurely. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called the perfection of unity. At that time, nothing was done, yet all was constantly natural.

When virtue declined, Suiren and Fuxi began to "make Heaven," thus following yet not unified. When virtue further declined, Shennong and the Yellow Emperor began to "make the world below," thus being at peace yet not following. When virtue declined still further, Yao and Shun began to "make the world," initiating the flow of governance and transformation, diluting purity and scattering simplicity, departing from the Dao to pursue goodness, risking virtue to act—then they abandoned nature and followed the heart.

When hearts and minds gained knowledge yet proved insufficient to stabilize the world, then came refinement, and with it, expansive learning. Refinement eroded substance, and breadth drowned the heart—then the people first fell into confusion and disorder, unable to return to their nature and restore their origin.

From this we see: the world lost the Dao, and the Dao was lost to the world—they perished together. How could the people of the Dao arise in such a world? How could the world arise in the Dao? If the Dao cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Dao, then even if a sage dwells in the mountains and forests, their virtue remains hidden. Hidden, yet not by their own concealment.

The ancients spoke of recluses not as those who crouched unseen, nor as those who withheld their words, nor as those who hoarded their wisdom without expression—it was the great error of the times that compelled them. Had the times aligned with their destiny and flourished throughout the world, they would have returned to unity without effort. But when the times did not align, they deeply rooted themselves in tranquility and awaited their moment—this was the way of preserving the self.

The ancients who preserved themselves did not adorn their wisdom with eloquence, nor exhaust the world with their knowledge, nor deplete their virtue with their intellect. Serene in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do?

The Dao does not thrive in petty deeds, nor does virtue in shallow understanding. Small understanding harms virtue, and petty deeds harm the Dao. Thus it is said: rectify the self and nothing more. To delight in wholeness is called "attaining one’s will."

The ancients spoke of "attaining one’s will" not in terms of carriages and caps of office, but as having nothing to add to their joy. Today’s notion of "attaining one’s will" refers to carriages and caps. Yet when these adornments rest upon the body, they are not of one’s nature or destiny—they are transient things, borrowed. Borrowed, their coming cannot be barred, nor their going halted.

Therefore, one does not indulge the will for carriages and caps, nor conform to custom in poverty and hardship. Their joy remains the same in both, and so they are without sorrow. But if, when the borrowed departs, one is no longer joyful, then even in joy, there is always desolation. Thus it is said: those who lose themselves to things and forfeit their nature to custom are called "the inverted people."

**Book Six, Part Two – Chapter Seventeen: "Autumn Floods"**

When autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River.

When the autumn floods swell the Jing River to its fullest, the banks and islets on either side become so vast that one cannot distinguish ox from horse. At this, the River Lord rejoiced exultantly, believing all the world’s beauty to be his alone. Following the current eastward, he reached the Northern Sea. Turning to face the east, he saw the water stretching endlessly. Then the River Lord turned his gaze, looked toward Ruo of the Northern Sea, and sighed:

“There is a rustic saying: ‘Having heard the Dao a hundred times, one thinks none can compare to oneself.’ That describes me. Moreover, I once heard men belittle Confucius’s learning and dismiss Boyi’s righteousness, and I did not believe them. Now that I have witnessed the boundlessness of your waters, had I not come to your gate, I would have remained in peril—forever ridiculed by those of great understanding.”

Ruo of the Northern Sea replied:
“The well frog cannot speak of the sea, for it is confined by its hollow. The summer insect cannot speak of ice, for it is bound by its season. The narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, for he is shackled by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your riverbanks and beheld the great sea, you recognize your own limitations—now you may be spoken with of great things.

Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers flow into it, yet it never fills, no matter when they cease. The Tail Conduit drains it, yet it never empties, no matter when it stops. Unchanged by autumn, unaware of flood or drought, it surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River beyond all measure. Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive my qi from the yang. I stand between heaven and earth like a pebble or twig in a great mountain. Since I perceive my own smallness, why should I boast?

Consider the Four Seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a tiny crevice in a vast marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? We number things by the myriad, yet humanity is but one among them. People fill the Nine Provinces, where grain grows and boats and carriages travel, yet each person is but one among them. Compared to the myriad, is this not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?

The Five Emperors’ legacies, the Three Kings’ struggles, the benevolent men’s worries, the devoted scholars’ labors—all amount to this! Boyi rejected it for fame, Confucius discoursed on it as erudition. Their self-satisfaction—was it not like your earlier pride in your waters?”

The River Lord said, “Then may I regard heaven and earth as great and the tip of a hair as small?”

Ruo of the Northern Sea replied, “No. Things have limits, but time knows no end; their allotments are not constant, and beginnings and ends have no fixed cause. Thus the great sage observes both near and far, so that the small is not deemed insignificant, nor the great excessive—knowing the limits of things. He verifies past and present, so that the distant does not weary him, nor the immediate make him strain—knowing time’s endlessness. He examines fullness and emptiness, so that gain does not elate him, nor loss grieve him—knowing allotments’ inconstancy. He perceives the level path, so that life does not delight him, nor death bring misfortune—knowing beginnings and ends have no fixed cause.

What he knows is less than what he does not know; the time of his life is less than the time before his birth. Seeking to exhaust the realm of the infinitely great with his infinitesimal self, he becomes lost and cannot attain it. From this perspective, how can the tip of a hair suffice to define the finest limit, or heaven and earth to exhaust the realm of the infinitely great?”

The River Lord said, “Those in the world all say: ‘The most refined has no form; the greatest cannot be encompassed.’ Is this true?”

Ruo of the Northern Sea replied, “From the perspective of the small, the great cannot be fully seen; from the perspective of the great, the small cannot be clearly discerned. The refined is the subtlest of the small; the vast is the fullness of the great—thus their difference is fitting. This is the nature of things.

The refined and the coarse are terms for what has form; the formless cannot be measured by numbers; the unencompassable cannot be exhausted by calculation. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect. What words cannot discuss, what intention cannot grasp—these do not depend on refinement or coarseness.

Thus the actions of the great man do not harm others, nor does he overvalue benevolence and kindness. He does not act for profit, nor despise servants. He does not contend for wealth, nor overvalue yielding. He does not rely on others in his affairs, nor overvalue self-reliance, nor despise the greedy. His conduct differs from the common, yet he does not overvalue eccentricity. He follows the crowd, yet does not despise flatterers. The world’s ranks are insufficient to encourage him; punishment and shame are insufficient to shame him. He knows right and wrong cannot be divided, nor fine and great be defined.

It is said: ‘The Daoist does not strive, the perfectly virtuous does not attain, the great man has no self.’ This is the utmost in moderation.”

The River Spirit said: "Beyond things, within things—where do we draw the line between noble and base? Where do we distinguish great and small?"

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied: "Viewed through the Dao, things have their nobility and baseness. Viewed through things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base. Viewed through custom, nobility and baseness lie beyond one’s control. Viewed through differentiation, if you take what is great in something and call it great, then nothing in the world is not great; if you take what is small in something and call it small, then nothing in the world is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, and a tip of hair is a mountain, one perceives the relativity of measure.

Viewed through function, if you take what something possesses and call it possession, then nothing in the world lacks possession; if you take what something lacks and call it lack, then nothing in the world possesses anything. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot exist without each other, one grasps the division of function.

Viewed through inclination, if you take what something affirms and affirm it, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if you take what something denies and deny it, then nothing in the world is not denied. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed their own ways and denied the other’s, one perceives the nature of inclination.

In ancient times, Yao and Shun yielded the throne and became emperors, while Zhi and Kuai yielded it and met their ruin. Tang and Wu fought for it and became kings, while the Duke of Bai fought for it and perished. From this, we see that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, nobility and baseness—all have their time, and cannot be taken as constant.

A battering ram can breach a city wall but cannot plug a rat hole—this speaks of differing implements. The swift steeds Qi Ji and Hua Liu can gallop a thousand li in a day, yet the rat is no match for the weasel—this speaks of differing skills. The owl snatches fleas at night and discerns the tip of a hair, yet with eyes wide open it cannot see a mountain—this speaks of differing natures.

Thus it is said: Should one take ‘this’ as the standard and reject all ‘not-this,’ or take order as the standard and reject all disorder? This is to fail to understand the principles of heaven and earth and the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as the standard and rejecting earth, or taking yin as the standard and rejecting yang—clearly, this cannot be put into practice! Yet to persist in such talk without ceasing is either folly or deception.

The abdications of emperors and kings differ; the successions of the Three Dynasties differ. Those who act against their times and go against custom are called usurpers; those who act in accord with their times and follow custom are called righteous men. Be silent, River Spirit! How could you know the gate of nobility and baseness, the house of greatness?"

The River Spirit said: "Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I decide what to accept or reject, what to pursue or abandon?"

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied: "Viewed through the Dao, what is noble? What is base? These are but reversals and extensions. Do not constrain your will, for it will greatly hinder the Dao. What is few? What is many? These are but shifts and exchanges. Do not act with singularity, for it will clash with the Dao.

Be solemn as a state with its ruler, impartial in virtue; be reverent as a sacrifice with its altar, impartial in blessing; be boundless as the four directions without limit, without demarcation. Embracing the myriad things, who bears the burden of their support? This is called having no fixed direction.

The myriad things are equal—who is short, who is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life, yet do not rely on their achievements. Emptiness and fullness alternate, not fixed in form. Years cannot be held back, time cannot be stopped. Exhaustion and fulfillment, end and beginning—these are the great principles, the patterns of the myriad things.

The birth of things is like a gallop, like a race. No movement without change, no moment without shift. What should be done? What should not be done? All things will transform themselves."

The River Spirit said: "Then is the Dao to be prized?"

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied: "One who knows the Dao must grasp its principles; one who grasps its principles must understand its adaptability; one who understands its adaptability does not let things cause harm. The one of utmost virtue—fire cannot burn them, water cannot drown them, cold and heat cannot harm them, birds and beasts cannot injure them. Not that they belittle these things, but they speak of safety and danger, tranquility amid fortune and misfortune, caution in approach and retreat—nothing can harm them.

Thus it is said: Heaven is within, man is without; virtue lies in heaven. Know the movement of heaven, root yourself in heaven, rest in attainment. Hesitate and bend or stretch, return to the essential and speak of the ultimate."

The River Spirit asked: "What is heaven? What is man?"

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied: "The four legs of oxen and horses—this is heaven. Bridling a horse’s head, piercing an ox’s nose—this is man. Thus it is said: Do not let man obliterate heaven, do not let purpose obliterate fate, do not let gain be sacrificed for fame. Guard this carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to one’s true nature."

Kui pitied the centipede, the centipede pitied the snake, the snake pitied the wind, the wind pitied the eye, the eye pitied the mind. Kui said to the centipede: "I hop along on one leg—there is nothing I can do about it. Now you command ten thousand legs—how do you manage?"

The centipede replied: "Not so. Have you never seen one who spits?"

The droplets fall in sizes great as pearls or fine as mist, scattering in numbers beyond count. Now I move by my heavenly mechanism, yet know not how it comes to be."

The snake said: "I walk with many feet, yet cannot match your footlessness—why is this?"

The snake replied: "When the heavenly mechanism stirs, how can one resist? What need have I for feet!"

The snake asked the wind: "I move by flexing my spine and ribs, and thus have some semblance of form. Yet you rise in a great rush from the north, rush into the southern sea, and seem as if you have no form at all—why is this?"

The wind said: "Indeed, I rise in a great rush from the northern sea and enter the southern sea. Yet if one points a finger at me, they overcome me; if one treads upon me, they overcome me. Nevertheless, to break great trees and topple mighty halls—only I can do this. To turn many small defeats into a great victory—only the sage can achieve this."

Confucius traveled in Kuang, where men of Song encircled him several layers deep, yet he continued strumming his zither and singing without pause. Zilu entered to see him and asked: "How can the Master bear this?" Confucius said: "Come, let me tell you. I have long concealed myself from adversity, yet cannot escape it—such is fate. I have long sought passage, yet cannot attain it—such is timing. In the age of Yao and Shun, there were no destitute men in the world, not because of their wisdom’s gain; in the age of Jie and Zhou, there were no unobstructed men in the world, not because of their wisdom’s loss: the circumstances simply aligned thus. He who travels by water without avoiding dragons and jiao is the courage of the fisherman; he who travels by land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers is the courage of the hunter; he who faces crossed blades before him and regards death as life is the courage of the stalwart warrior; he who knows adversity is governed by fate, knows passage comes with timing, and faces great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage. Rest easy, You! My fate is constrained by something greater!"

Before long, the armored commander advanced and said: "We mistook you for Yang Hu and surrounded you; now that we see it is not him, we beg leave to withdraw."

Gongsun Long questioned Wei Mou, saying: "In my youth, I studied the Dao of the former kings; in maturity, I clarified the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness; affirmed the negative and the positive, the permissible and the impermissible. I confounded the wisdom of the hundred schools, exhausted the eloquence of all disputants—thus I took myself to have attained ultimate comprehension. Now, having heard the words of Zhuangzi, I find them strange indeed. Do I fall short in my reasoning? Or do I simply lack his depth of understanding? Now I stand speechless; I venture to ask for your guidance."

Prince Mou sighed deeply, looked up to the heavens, and laughed: "Have you alone not heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea: 'How joyful I am! I leap and prance upon the well’s railing, rest in the chinks of its broken walls. When I plunge into the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I tread in the mud, it covers my feet and submerges my ankles. I turn to the crabs and tadpoles—none can compare to me! Moreover, to command the water of a single ravine and to lord over the pleasures of this well—what more could one desire? Why not come in and see for yourself?'

Before the turtle of the Eastern Sea could set its left foot inside, its right knee was already stuck. Hesitating, it withdrew and said: 'A distance of a thousand *li* cannot encompass its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* cannot fathom its depth. In the time of Yu, nine floods in ten years did not increase its waters; in the time of Tang, seven droughts in eight years did not diminish its shores. Unchanged by the passage of moments or ages, unmoved by the increase or decrease of waters—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea!'

Hearing this, the frog in the shallow well was startled, bewildered, and lost in self-doubt. Now, if one does not even know the bounds of right and wrong yet still wishes to examine the words of Zhuangzi, it is like making a mosquito bear a mountain or a centipede race a thoroughbred—they will surely fail. And if one does not comprehend the ultimate subtleties of his discourse yet seeks only momentary advantage, is this not the frog in the shallow well?

Moreover, he strides upon the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Vastness, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, submerged in the unfathomable; unbound by east or west, beginning in profound darkness, returning to the Great Thoroughfare. Yet you seek to measure him with narrow scrutiny, to probe him with disputation—is this not like using a tube to view the heavens or a bodkin to point at the earth? Is it not too small a way?

Go now! Have you alone not heard of the young men of Shouling who went to Handan to learn its gait? Before mastering the state’s skill, they lost their own way of walking and could only crawl home on all fours. If you do not leave now, you will forget your own roots and lose your own calling."

Gongsun Long’s mouth gaped open and would not close; his tongue rose and would not descend. He fled in haste.

Zhuangzi was fishing in the Pu River when the King of Chu sent two great ministers to approach him first, saying: "I wish to trouble you with the affairs of my realm!"

Zhuangzi, rod in hand, did not turn, and said: "I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise, dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in silk and stored in a casket upon the ancestral altar. Would this tortoise prefer to be honored for its bones, or to live and drag its tail through the mud?"

The two ministers replied: "It would prefer to live and drag its tail through the mud."

Zhuangzi said: "Go then! I too shall drag my tail through the mud."

When Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone said to Huizi: "Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as minister." Thereupon, Huizi searched the state for three days and three nights.

Zhuangzi went to see him and said: "In the south there is a bird called the *yuanchu*—do you know it? The *yuanchu* flies from the Southern Sea to the Northern Sea, resting only on the *wutong* tree, eating only the fruit of the *melia*, drinking only from springs of sweet wine. A kite, clutching a rotten rat, saw the *yuanchu* pass by and looked up, crying, '*Ha!*' Now, do you wish to threaten me with your state of Liang?"

Zhuangzi and Huizi strolled upon the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said: "The minnows glide forth at ease—this is the joy of fish."

Huizi said: "You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?"

Zhuangzi replied: "You are not me—how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?"

Huizi said: "I am not you, so of course I do not know you; but you are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete!"

Zhuangzi said: "Let us return to the beginning. When you asked, *'How do you know the joy of fish?'*—you already knew that I knew it when you asked me. I knew it from here, upon the Hao."

**Chapter Eighteen: Supreme Joy**
Is there in the world a supreme joy, or is there not? Are there ways to preserve life, or are there not? What should one do? What rely upon? What avoid? Where dwell? What pursue? What delight in? What despise?

What the world honors are wealth, nobility, long life, and virtue; what it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and sweet sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice; what it suffers from are the body’s lack of ease, the absence of rich flavors, the want of fine garments, the deprivation of beautiful sights, and the loss of sweet sounds. Those who cannot obtain these things are filled with great sorrow and fear—how foolish they are in their concern for the body!

The wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing riches they cannot fully use—how alienated they are from the body! The noble pass their days and nights in ceaseless thought, weighing right and wrong—how estranged they are from the body! Human life is born with care. The long-lived grow dull, enduring long sorrow without dying—what bitter suffering! How distant they are from the body! The resolute strive for fame in the world, yet it is not enough to preserve their lives. Is their goodness truly good? Or is it not good? If it is good, it is not enough to preserve life; if it is not good, it is enough to preserve others. Thus it is said: *"When loyal admonitions go unheeded, withdraw and do not contend."* Yet Wu Zixu contended and brought ruin upon his body; had he not contended, his name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there not?

As for the pursuits and pleasures of the common world, I do not know whether they are truly joy or not. I observe how the masses rush together in their pursuits, driven as if they cannot help themselves, all calling it joy—yet I find no joy in it, nor do I find it not joy. Is there truly joy, or is there not? I take non-action as true joy, yet it is what the world deems the greatest suffering. Thus it is said: *"Supreme joy is without joy; supreme praise is without praise."* The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong.

Supreme joy preserves life—only non-action comes close to it. Let me try to speak of it: Heaven is non-active and so becomes clear; Earth is non-active and so becomes tranquil. When the two non-actions combine, the myriad things are transformed and born. Vague and indistinct, without whence they emerge! Indistinct and vague, without form they take! The myriad things flourish, all growing from non-action. Thus it is said: *"Heaven and Earth do nothing, yet there is nothing they do not do."* Who among men can attain non-action?

When Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi went to offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting with legs spread, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said: "To live with someone, raise a child together, and upon her death not weep would be enough—yet you drum on a basin and sing! Is this not excessive?"

Zhuangzi said: "Not so. When she first died, how could I alone not feel grief? But I examined her beginning and found she was originally without life; not only without life, but originally without form; not only without form, but originally without *qi*. Amidst the vague and indistinct, there was transformation into *qi*, *qi* transformed into form, form transformed into life. Now she has transformed again into death. This is like the passing of spring and autumn, summer and winter, in the turning of the four seasons. She now lies at peace in the great chamber, and I follow wailing after her—would this not show I do not understand fate? Thus I stopped."

Zhilishu and Huajieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo, the wasteland of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once rested. Suddenly, a wen grew on Huajieshu’s elbow, and he was dismayed by it. Zhilishu said: "Do you dislike it?"

Huajieshu replied: "No, why should I dislike it? Life is a temporary borrowing. What borrows and gives rise to life is but dust and grime. Death and life are like day and night. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has reached me—why should I dislike it?"

When Zhuangzi went to Chu, he saw an empty skull, bleached and still shaped. He tapped it with his horse whip and questioned it, saying: "Did you, sir, covet and lose the Dao, and so come to this? Or did you suffer the fall of a state, execution by axe, and so come to this? Or did you commit some shameful deed, bringing disgrace to your parents and wife, and so come to this? Or did you suffer from cold and hunger, and so come to this? Or did your years run out, and so come to this?"

Having spoken, he took the skull as a pillow and lay down. In the middle of the night, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said: "Your words resemble those of a sophist. All you speak of are the burdens of the living—death has none of these. Would you like to hear the truth of death?"

Zhuangzi said: "Yes."

The skull said: "In death, there is no ruler above, no subject below; nor are there the affairs of the four seasons. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it."

Zhuangzi did not believe it and said: "If I had the Controller of Fate restore your form, give you bones, flesh, and skin, return you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and friends, would you desire this?"

The skull frowned deeply and said: "How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south and return to the toils of the human world?"

When Yan Yuan journeyed east to Qi, Confucius wore a troubled expression. Zigong stepped down from his mat and asked: "This disciple ventures to ask—Yan Yuan’s journey to Qi has brought you this troubled look. Is that so?"

Confucius said: "Excellent is your question! Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I hold in great esteem: *'A small sack cannot hold a large object; a short rope cannot draw from the deep.'* Such is the way of things—each destiny has its completion, each form its proper place, and these cannot be altered. I fear that Yan Yuan, in speaking to the Marquis of Qi of the Dao of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor, will further cite the words of Suiren and Shennong. The Marquis will then turn inward to seek within himself—and if he finds it, he will not; if he does not, he will be confounded. A man confounded is as good as dead.

"And have you alone not heard? Once, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu received it with ceremony and offered it wine in the ancestral temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared the grandest sacrificial feast. Yet the bird only gazed in distress and sorrow, dared not eat a single morsel, dared not drink a single cup, and died after three days. This was nourishing the bird with what nourishes oneself, not with what nourishes the bird. To nourish a bird as a bird should be nourished, one ought to let it roost in deep forests, wander open plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on minnows and loaches, follow its flock in flight and rest, and live at ease. Why should it hear the clamor of human words? When the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* is played across the wilds of Dongting, birds hear it and fly away, beasts hear it and flee, fish hear it and dive deep, while men, upon hearing it, gather to listen. Fish live in water and thrive, but men would drown. They must differ in kind, for their likes and dislikes are not the same. Thus the sages of old did not presume to impose their abilities, nor did they force uniformity in affairs. Names were kept to their realities, meanings were set to their proper uses—this is what is called 'orderly coherence and enduring good fortune.'"

Liezi was traveling and took a meal by the roadside when he saw a century-old skull. Pulling aside the brambles, he pointed to it and said: "Only you and I know that you have never died, and never lived. Do you truly grieve? Do I truly rejoice?"

Is there a single source from which all things arise? Obtain water, and they become algae; at the border of earth and water, they become the raiment of frogs and toads. Growing on mounds, they become plantain; plantain that finds damp shade becomes crow’s-foot. The root of crow’s-foot becomes a grub, its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies in time transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off shell, their name *qūduó*. After a thousand days, *qūduó* becomes a bird called *gānyúgǔ*. The froth of *gānyúgǔ* becomes *sīmí*, and *sīmí* becomes *shíxī*. From *shíxī* comes *yílù*, from *jiǔyóu* comes *huángkuàng*, and from rotten silkworms comes *màoruì*. *Yángxī* joins with the unopened bamboo shoot to produce *qīngníng*, *qīngníng* gives rise to the leopard, the leopard to the horse, the horse to man—and man in turn returns into the source. All things emerge from the source, all things return to the source.

Those who comprehend the essence of life do not strive after what is of no use to life. Those who comprehend the essence of fate do not strive after knowledge that can do nothing in the face of the inevitable. Some first attend to things, yet though things are abundant, the body is not nourished; some possess life yet first lose their form, while others retain their form yet lose their life. What comes cannot be refused, what departs cannot be stopped. How lamentable! The people of the world believe that nourishing the body is sufficient to preserve life, yet if nourishing the body is truly insufficient to preserve life, what is it good for? Though it may not be sufficient, one cannot but do it—such effort is inescapable. To escape the labor of maintaining form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Free from encumbrances, one attains perfect equilibrium; in perfect equilibrium, one exchanges life with the Dao, and in such exchange lies nearness to the Way.

Why cling to affairs? Why forsake life? Abandoning form requires no toil, and forsaking life preserves one’s essence. When form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: in union, they generate; in dispersion, they give rise to beginnings. When form and essence remain unharmed, this is called "the power to transform." Refining essence ever further, one returns to assist Heaven.

Master Liezi asked Guan Yin: "The perfected person walks through water without obstruction, treads fire without heat, and moves above the myriad things without fear. How does one attain this?" Guan Yin replied: "This is the preservation of pure *qi*, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness. Sit, and I will tell you: all that has appearance, form, and color belongs to the realm of things—how can things be far apart from one another? Why strive to be first? It is but form. Thus, things arise from the formless and rest where there is no place. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths—how can things confine them? They dwell within the measure of no excess, conceal themselves in the beginningless order, and wander where things end and begin. They unify their nature, nurture their *qi*, harmonize their virtue, and thereby commune with the source of all things. Such a one preserves Heaven intact, their spirit without flaw—how could things intrude?

Consider the drunkard who falls from a cart: though the fall is swift, he does not die. His joints are the same as others’, and he suffers the same harm, yet his spirit remains whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling; life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast. Thus, he encounters things yet remains unharmed. If one can be so whole in wine, how much more so in Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, and thus nothing can harm them.

The avenger does not blame the blade; even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a flying tile. Thus, the world is in balance. Therefore, there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of slaughter—this arises from the Way. Do not open the Heavenly in man, but open the Heavenly of Heaven. Opening the Heavenly of Heaven gives rise to virtue; opening the Heavenly in man gives rise to harm. Do not weary of Heaven, neglect man, and the people will draw near to their true nature."

Confucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchback catching cicadas as easily as if he were plucking them. Confucius said, "You are skillful—is this the Way?"

The hunchback replied, "I have my method. After five or six months of stacking two pellets without them falling, I lose only a fraction; with three pellets, I lose one in ten; with five, it is as effortless as plucking. I hold my body still as a withered stump, and my arm steady as a dry branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, I am aware only of the cicada’s wings. I do not turn or sway, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?"

Confucius turned to his disciples and said, "When the mind is undivided, it congeals in spirit. Such is the way of the hunchbacked elder!"

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, "I once crossed the deep rapids of Shang, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him, ‘Is this a matter of practice?’ He said, ‘Yes. Those skilled in swimming can do it. But as for the diver, he has never seen a boat yet handles it with ease.’ I questioned him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?"

Confucius said, "Those skilled in swimming can do it because they forget the water. As for the diver who handles the boat with ease without ever having seen one—he sees the depths as if they were a hill, and the capsizing of a boat as if it were his cart rolling backward. Though a thousand dangers lie before him, they cannot enter his mind—where could he find no leisure? One who stakes tiles gambles with skill; one who stakes hooks grows cautious; one who stakes gold grows flustered. The skill is the same, but when one values the external, the inner becomes clumsy. For all who value the external, the inner is inept."

Field Opening called upon Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said, "I have heard that Zhu Shen pursues learning. You have kept company with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?"

Field Opening replied, "I merely wield broom and dustpan to attend in the courtyard—what could I have learned from the Master!"

The Duke said, "Field Opening, do not decline. I wish to hear it."

Opening said, "I heard the Master say: *'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd herding sheep—he watches those lagging behind and whips them.'*"

The Duke asked, "What does this mean?"

Field Opening said, "In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who dwelled in the cliffs and drank from streams, sharing no profit with the people. Though he lived to seventy, his complexion remained like a child’s. Unluckily, he met a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him. There was also Zhang Yi, who frequented every high gate and low curtain, running wherever he went. At forty, he died of internal heat. Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger devoured his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, yet illness assailed his inner. These two did not whip those lagging behind."

Confucius said, "Do not hide in seclusion, do not expose yourself to excess, but stand firm in the center. If these three are attained, one reaches the highest name. Those who fear the road—if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers will warn one another, and none will dare venture out without a great retinue. Are they not wise? Yet what they truly should fear lies in the bedding and at the dining table, and they do not guard against it—this is their error!"

The invocator, clad in dark ceremonial robes, approached the pen and addressed the pig: "Why do you hate death? I will fatten you for three months, purify you for ten days, fast for a day, spread white couch grass, and place your shoulders and haunches upon the carved sacrificial platter—would you prefer this?"

Planning for the pig, he said, "Better to eat chaff and dregs in the pen."

Planning for himself, he said, "If alive, one may enjoy the honor of carriages and caps; if dead, one may lie upon the painted bier amid the gathered mourners—this is acceptable."

For the pig, he rejects it; for himself, he accepts it. How does he differ from the pig?

Duke Huan was hunting in the marshes, with Guan Zhong driving the chariot, when he saw a ghost. The Duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked, "Zhongfu, what did you see?"

Guan Zhong replied, "Your servant saw nothing."

The Duke returned, fell ill with vexation, and did not leave his chamber for days. A Qi scholar named Huangzi Gao’ao said, "The Duke has harmed himself—how could a ghost harm him? When pent-up *qi* scatters and does not return, it causes deficiency; when it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger; when it descends but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness; when it neither rises nor descends but lodges in the center of the body, at the heart, it causes illness."

Duke Huan asked, "Then are there ghosts?"

He replied, "There are. In the depths dwell *Li*."

The hearth has *Ji*. In the inner chambers’ troubled soil, *Leiting* dwells; beneath the northeast lies *Bei’e* and *Xielong*; beneath the northwest, *Yiyang* resides. In waters lurks *Wangxiang*; in mounds, *Shen*; in mountains, *Kui*; in the wilds, *Panghuang*; in marshes, *Weiyi*.

The Duke asked, "Pray tell, what is the form of *Weiyi*?"

Huangzi replied, "*Weiyi* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes with a vermilion cap. As a creature, it abhors the sound of thunderous chariots—when it hears them, it clasps its head and stands erect. He who sees it is on the verge of hegemony."

Duke Huan laughed heartily and said, "This was what *I* saw!" Thereupon, he straightened his robes and cap, sat with Huangzi, and before the day was out, his illness had vanished without his notice.

Ji Shengzi reared fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked, "Are the cocks ready?"

"Not yet," he replied. "They are still hollow and arrogant, relying on their pride."

After another ten days, the king asked again. He said, "Not yet. They still respond to shadows and reflections."

After another ten days, the king asked again. He said, "Not yet. Their gaze is still fierce, and their *qi* remains exuberant."

After another ten days, the king asked once more. He said, "Nearly so. Though others may crow, they show no change. From afar, they resemble wooden cocks—their virtue is complete. No other cock dares challenge them; they turn and flee."

Confucius observed the Lüliang Falls, where the water plunged from a height of thirty *ren*, its froth surging forty *li*, a place where turtles, alligators, fish, and soft-shelled turtles could not swim. Yet a man swam there, appearing distressed and on the verge of drowning. Confucius sent his disciples to follow the current and rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he strolled beneath the embankment.

Confucius approached and questioned him, saying, "I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are a man. May I ask: is there a Dao to treading water?"

The man replied, "No, I have no Dao. I began with what is innate, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny. I enter the water in harmony with its flow, emerge in unison with its rush, following the water’s Way without imposing my own will. This is how I tread it."

Confucius asked, "What do you mean by beginning with what is innate, growing with your nature, and fulfilling your destiny?"

The man said, "I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—that is my innate endowment. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—that is my nature. I do not know why I am as I am, yet I am so—that is my destiny."

Zi Qing carved wood into a *ju*, and when it was completed, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and questioned him, saying, "What technique do you employ?"

Zi Qing replied, "I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Nevertheless, there is one thing. When I am about to make a *ju*, I never dare to squander my *qi*; I must first align my mind. After three days of alignment, I no longer dare to harbor thoughts of rewards, ranks, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dare to entertain praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forget that I possess limbs or a body. At that moment, there is no court or state. My skill becomes concentrated, and external concerns dissolve. Only then do I enter the mountain forests to observe the natural essence of things. When the form is fully realized within me, the *ju* appears of its own accord, and only then do I set my hands to it. If not, I desist. Thus, I unite Heaven with Heaven—this, perhaps, is why the vessel seems divine!"

Dongye Ji was presented to Duke Zhuang as a charioteer. His advances and retreats aligned with the plumb line, and his left and right turns followed the compass. The duke declared that even the finest embroidery could not surpass his precision. He ordered Ji to drive a hundred circuits and return. Yan He encountered him and entered to say, "Ji’s horses are about to fail." The duke remained silent and did not respond. Soon after, the horses indeed faltered and returned.

The duke asked, "How did you know this?"
He replied, "His horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—this is why I said they would fail."

When Gongchui turned his hand, his work surpassed compass and square. His fingers transformed with things, without deliberation in his mind, so his spirit-terrace stood unified and unshackled.

Feet forgotten—this is comfort.
Waist forgotten—this is the comfort of a belt.
Knowledge forgetting right and wrong—this is the comfort of the mind.
No inner change, no outer compliance—this is the comfort of events converging.
From the outset, one who is never not at ease—this is the comfort of forgetting comfort.

There was a man named Sun Xiu who came to the door and addressed Master Bian Qingzi, saying, "Though I live in the village, none call me unrefined; though I face peril, none call me cowardly. Yet my fields and lands do not meet with the year’s favor, my service to my lord does not meet with the age’s favor. I am shunned by my village, driven from my district—what offense have I committed against Heaven? Why has fate treated me thus?"

Master Bian said, "Have you alone not heard of the perfected person’s way of conduct? They forget their liver and gall, leave behind their ears and eyes, wander in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam freely in the work of no-occupation—this is called acting without reliance, creating without domination. Now you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose others’ filth, shining as brightly as if you carried the sun and moon in your stride. You have preserved your bodily form intact, your nine orifices complete, and have not halfway perished from deafness, blindness, lameness, or deformity to be counted among the ranks of men—this is already fortune enough. Why then do you have leisure to resent Heaven? Begone!"

Sunzi departed, and Master Bian entered.

After a while, Master Bian looked up to the heavens and sighed. His disciples asked, "Master, why do you sigh?"

Master Bian replied, "Just now, when Sunzi came, I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person. I fear he was startled and thus became confused."

The disciples said, "Not so. If Sunzi’s words were right, then your words were wrong—wrongness cannot confuse rightness. If your words were right, then his words were wrong—he was already confused when he came. What fault is there in this?"

Master Bian said, "Not so. Once, when I stayed at the outskirts of Lu, the Lord of Lu was delighted and prepared a grand feast to entertain me, performing the *Nine Shao* to please me. A bird, upon hearing this, grew anxious, sorrowful, and dizzy, refusing to eat. This is what it means to nourish a bird with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, float upon rivers and lakes, and feed on fish and insects—then it would be at ease on level ground. Now, Sunzi is a man of limited understanding and shallow knowledge. When I spoke to him of the perfected person’s virtue, it was like loading a mouse onto a chariot drawn by horses, or sounding bells and drums for it—how could he not be startled?"

As Zhuangzi walked through the mountains, he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. When asked why, he replied, "It is of no use." Zhuangzi said, "This tree, by being of no use, has lived out its natural span."

Emerging from the mountains, Zhuangzi lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, delighted, ordered his servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, "One can caw, the other cannot— which should we kill?" The master said, "Kill the one that cannot caw."

The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi, "Yesterday, the tree in the mountains lived out its natural span by being of no use; today, the master’s goose died for being of no use. Where will you, Master, take your stand?"

Zhuangzi laughed and said, "I will take my stand between usefulness and uselessness. Yet even between usefulness and uselessness, one is still not free from entanglement—for it is but a semblance, not the truth. Those who ride the Dao and float with virtue are not so. Without praise or blame, now a dragon, now a serpent, they transform with the times, never clinging to one form. Rising and falling, they take harmony as their measure, drifting upon the source of all things. They master things without being mastered by things—how then could they be entangled? This is the method of the divine Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.

As for the nature of the myriad things and the traditions of human relationships, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to destruction; sharpness invites blunting, honor invites slander, action incurs loss, worth invites schemes, and worthlessness invites deceit. How can one be certain of anything? Alas! Remember this, disciples: only in the realm of Dao and virtue can one find refuge."

Shi Nanyu Ailiao visited the Lord of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Shi Nanyu asked, "Why does my lord appear so troubled?"

The Lord of Lu replied, "I study the Way of the former kings and cultivate the legacy of my predecessors. I revere the spirits, honor the worthy, and practice these virtues without ceasing—yet I cannot escape misfortune. This is why I am troubled."

Shi Nanyu said, "My lord’s method of avoiding misfortune is too shallow! The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in rocky caves, and remain still. They move by night and rest by day, ever vigilant. Though hungry and thirsty, they still venture to rivers and lakes in search of food, ever composed. Yet they cannot escape the snares and traps—what fault is theirs? Their very hides bring them disaster."

"Is not the state of Lu your very hide? I wish for you to flay your form and shed your skin, to cleanse your heart and cast off desire, then wander where no man dwells. In the southern lands of Yue, there is a city called the Land of Established Virtue. Its people are simple and unadorned, with few selfish desires. They know how to act but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where duty leads, nor where ritual guides. Wild and unconstrained, they tread the great Dao. Their lives are joyful, and their deaths may be buried. I wish for you to abandon your state and forsake custom, to walk alongside the Dao as your companion."

The Lord said, "That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what am I to do?"

Shi Nanyu replied, "Be without arrogance in your form, without lingering in your dwelling, and this will serve as your carriage."

The Lord said, "That Way is secluded and remote, with no people—with whom shall I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?"

Shi Nanyu said, "Lessen your expenditures, reduce your desires, and though you have no grain, you will yet have enough. Cross the rivers and float upon the sea; though you see its shores from afar, the farther you go, the less you will know its end. Those who see you off will all turn back from the shore. From there, you will be far indeed! Thus, he who possesses others is burdened, and he who is possessed by others is troubled. Therefore, Yao was not one who possessed others, nor was he possessed by others. I wish to rid you of your burdens, remove your troubles, and wander alone with the Dao in the land of nothingness. When a double-hulled boat crosses the river, and an empty boat drifts into it, even a hot-tempered man would not grow angry. But if there were a person aboard, he would call out to them."

Once called and unheard, twice called and unheard—then at the third call, surely harsh words follow. Before, there was no anger; now, there is. Before, it was empty; now, it is full. If one can empty oneself and wander through the world, who could harm them?

When Beigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells, he built an altar outside the outer gate of the capital. In three months, the upper and lower chimes were complete. Zi Qingji saw this and asked, "What method did you employ?"

She replied, "In the space between intention and action, I dared not impose anything. I have heard: *'Carved and polished, it returns to simplicity.'* In their ignorance, they were careless and hesitant; gathered in confusion, they sent off the old and welcomed the new. Those who came were not forbidden; those who left were not stopped. I followed their strength, adapted to their crookedness, and let them exhaust themselves. Thus, though taxes were levied morning and night, not a hair was harmed—how much less those on the great thoroughfares!"

Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food.

Taigong Ren went to offer his condolences and asked, "Were you nearly dead?"

"Yes," Confucius replied.

"Do you detest death?"

"Yes."

Taigong Ren said, "I once spoke of the Way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it is slow and sluggish, appearing incapable. It flies only when supported by others and perches only when pressed. It dares not advance first nor lag behind; it dares not eat before others but must take the leftovers. Thus, it is never expelled from the flock, and outsiders never harm it—so it avoids disaster. The sweetest well is the first to run dry. You, perhaps, adorn your wisdom to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose others’ flaws, and stride forth as if bearing the sun and moon—how could you escape harm? Long ago, I heard the Perfect One say: *'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who achieve merit fall; those who achieve fame suffer loss.'* Who discards merit and fame to return to the common fold? The Dao flows unseen; dwelling in attainment yet leaving no trace; pure and constant, one seems mad. Erase your tracks, abandon influence, and do not seek merit or fame. Thus, you bear no blame from others, and they bear none from you. The Utmost Person remains unknown—why do you delight in fame?"

Confucius said, "Excellent!" He parted from his acquaintances, left his disciples, and fled to the great marshes. He wore coarse furs and ate acorns and chestnuts. Among beasts, he did not disrupt their herds; among birds, he did not disturb their flocks. Birds and beasts did not shun him—how much less would people?

Confucius asked Zisang Hu, "I was twice exiled from Lu, had a tree felled over me in Song, was forced to erase my tracks in Wei, was destitute in Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I have endured these many hardships, yet my close associates grow more distant and my followers more scattered. Why is this?"

Zisang Hu replied, "Have you not heard of the man who fled the state of Jia? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a baby on his back and flee. Someone asked, *'For its value? The baby’s worth is little. For its burden? The baby’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a baby?' Lin Hui said, 'That was bound by profit; this is bound by Heaven.’* Those bound by profit abandon each other in hardship and disaster; those bound by Heaven gather together in hardship and disaster. The difference between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water; the friendship of the petty is as sweet as wine. The noble grow closer in blandness; the petty grow estranged in sweetness. Those who unite without cause will part without cause."

Confucius said, "I respectfully receive your instruction!" He returned home leisurely, abandoned his studies, and discarded his books. His disciples no longer bowed before him, yet their affection deepened. Another day, Zisang Hu said, "When Shun was about to die, he sincerely warned Yu: *'Beware! In form, follow along; in feeling, be natural. Following along avoids separation; being natural avoids exhaustion. Without separation or exhaustion, one does not seek adornment to match form; without seeking adornment to match form, one fundamentally does not depend on things.'*"

Zhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his shoes with plain straps, and passed by the King of Wei. The king said, "Why is the Master so weary?" Zhuangzi replied, "It is poverty, not weariness. A scholar possesses the Dao and virtue yet cannot put them into practice—*that* is weariness. Worn clothes and threadbare shoes are poverty, not weariness. This is what is called not encountering the right time. Has Your Majesty never seen the leaping monkeys? When they find themselves among nanmu, catalpa, and camphor trees, they grasp the vines and swing through the branches, reigning as kings among them—even Yi or Peng Meng could not take their eyes off them. Yet when they find themselves among thorny brambles, zhe trees, and bitter orange thickets, they tread cautiously, glancing sideways, trembling and quaking. This is not because their sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened and lost their suppleness, but because their circumstances are unfavorable, and they cannot fully display their abilities. Now, living among benighted rulers and chaotic ministers, how can one avoid weariness? This is like the warning of Bi Gan’s heart being carved out!"

Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning on a withered tree with his left hand and striking its dry branches with his right, he sang the air of the *Biao* clan. There was the structure of the melody but not its precise measures, the sound but not its proper modes. Yet the sound and the human voice together plowed deeply into the hearts of those who heard. Yan Hui stood with hands folded, turning his gaze to observe. Fearing that Yan Hui might overreach in emulating him and thus court greatness, or cherish himself and thus invite sorrow, Confucius said, "Hui, to bear the harm of Heaven is easy; to bear the benefit of man is hard. There is no beginning that is not an end—this is the way of man and Heaven. Who, then, is the one singing now?"

Yan Hui said, "May I ask why bearing the harm of Heaven is easy?" Confucius replied, "Hunger, thirst, cold, and heat—being trapped and unable to move—these are the workings of Heaven and Earth, the ebb and flow of things. To speak of going along with them is to say one moves with them. As a minister, one does not dare to turn away. If even the Way of the minister is like this, how much more so the way one awaits Heaven?"

"‘What does it mean that bearing the benefit of man is hard?’"

Confucius replied, "At first, one is employed in all four directions, and ranks and emoluments arrive without end. What things deem profitable is not one’s own—my fate lies beyond me. The noble man does not steal, the worthy does not pilfer; if I were to take these, what would I be? Thus it is said: no bird is wiser than the swallow. Where its eyes ought not to alight, it glances swiftly, and though the fruit falls, it abandons it and flees. Fearing men, it yet nests among them. The altars of soil and grain endure—this alone!

"‘What does it mean that there is no beginning that is not an end?’"

The Master said, "Transforming the myriad things yet not knowing who succeeds whom—how can one know its end? How can one know its beginning? One simply aligns oneself and awaits it.

"‘What does it mean that man and Heaven are one?’"

Confucius replied, "There is man—this is Heaven; there is Heaven—this, too, is Heaven. Man cannot possess it—such is his nature. The sage, at ease, embodies the passing and comes to rest."

Zhuang Zhou roamed the thickets of Diao Ling when he saw a strange magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes measured a full inch, and it brushed his forehead before alighting in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said, "What bird is this! Its wings are vast yet it does not fly, its eyes are large yet it does not see." Hitching up his robes, he strode forward, bow in hand, and waited.

He saw a cicada, basking in the fine shade and forgetting its own body. A mantis, seizing the opportunity, struck at it, seeing only its gain and forgetting its form. The strange magpie, in turn, seized upon this, seeing only its advantage and forgetting its true nature. Zhuang Zhou started and said, "Ah! Things indeed entangle one another—two kinds summoning each other’s doom." He cast aside his bow and turned to flee, but the warden of the grove pursued him.

Zhuang Zhou returned home and for three days remained withdrawn. Lin Ju followed and asked him, "Master, why have you been so unsettled these past days?" Zhuang Zhou replied, "I guarded my form yet forgot my body; I gazed upon muddied waters and became lost in the clear abyss. Moreover, I have heard the Master say, ‘When entering their customs, follow their customs.’ Today, I wandered in Diao Ling and forgot myself; the strange magpie struck my forehead, and I wandered in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature. The warden of the grove took me for a thief—this is why I have withdrawn."

Yangzi traveled to Song and lodged at an inn.

At the inn, the innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yangzi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s young servant replied, “The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty; the plain one is plain in her own eyes, but I do not see her plainness.”

Yangzi said, “Disciples, take note: act with worthiness yet abandon the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be beloved?”

*Chapter 21, "Tian Zifang," Book Seven (Part Two)*

Tian Zifang sat in attendance upon Marquis Wen of Wei and repeatedly praised Xi Gong. The Marquis said, “Is Xi Gong your teacher?”

Zifang replied, “No, he is merely a villager from Wuze. He speaks of the Dao with such apt frequency that Wuze praises him.”

The Marquis said, “Then have you no teacher?”

Zifang said, “I do.”

The Marquis asked, “Who is your teacher?”

Zifang said, “Dongguo Shunzi.”

The Marquis said, “Then why have you never spoken of him?”

Zifang said, “His way of being is true. His appearance is human, yet his mind is empty as heaven; he follows things while preserving his authenticity, pure yet accommodating all. When things are absent, he responds with proper bearing to awaken them, dissolving the intentions of others. How could Wuze be worthy to speak of him?”

Zifang departed, and the Marquis was left in a state of wonder, remaining silent for the rest of the day. He stood before his ministers and said, “How distant indeed is the gentleman of perfect virtue! I once believed that the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness were the ultimate. But now, hearing of Zifang’s teacher, my form feels unraveled and unwilling to move, my mouth clamped shut and unwilling to speak. What I have learned is nothing but clods of earth! Truly, Wei has become a burden to me!”

Wenbo Xuezi traveled to Qi and lodged in Lu.

A man of Lu requested an audience with him, but Wenbo Xuezi said, “It cannot be. I have heard that the gentlemen of this state are enlightened in ritual and propriety yet coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet him.”

When he arrived in Qi and returned to lodge in Lu, the same man again requested an audience. Wenbo Xuezi said, “Before, he sought to see me, and now he seeks to see me again—he must have some way to stir me.” He went out to meet the guest, then returned inside. The next day, he met the guest again, then returned and sighed. His servant asked, “Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why is that?”

He replied, “I had already warned you: ‘The people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and propriety yet coarse in understanding the human heart.’ The one who came to see me before withdrew, forming his compass and setting his square, moving with the ease of a dragon or a tiger. His admonitions to me were like those of a son, his guidance like that of a father—this is why I sighed.”

Confucius met him but did not speak. Zilu said, “You have long wished to see Wenbo Xuezi. Now that you have met him, why do you not speak?”

Confucius replied, “In the presence of such a man, the Way is present the moment one’s gaze falls upon him—how could words even find room?”

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, “When you walk, I walk; when you hasten, I hasten; when you run, I run; when you race ahead, leaving dust in your wake, I can only stare blankly behind. Why is this?”

Confucius said, “Hui, what do you mean?”

Yan Yuan replied, “When you walk, I walk; when you speak, I speak; when you hasten, I hasten; when you debate, I debate; when you run, I run; when you discourse on the Way, I discourse on the Way. Yet when you race ahead, leaving all behind, I can only stare blankly—because you do not speak yet command trust, do not align yourself yet encompass all, bear no vessel yet the people surge before you. And this is simply how it is.”

Confucius said, “Alas! How could one fail to examine this? There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart—yet the death of the body is only secondary to it.”

The sun reaches its zenith and sinks into the westernmost edge—all things align themselves accordingly. Those with eyes and feet depend on it to achieve their ends. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they too enter rest. All things are thus: some wait for it to die, some wait for it to live. I, having received my completed form, do not transform but await its end. I emulate things, moving through day and night without pause, yet know not where it all concludes. My form takes shape as if by steaming, yet even knowing fate cannot constrain what lies before me. I, Qiu, daily dwindle thus. To grasp you for but an instant and then lose you—is this not sorrow? You cling to what I cling to. That has already vanished, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like searching for a horse in an empty market. I have so thoroughly forgotten you, and you have so thoroughly forgotten me. Yet why should you fret? Though you may resemble the old me, there remains something I have not forgotten."

Confucius visited Lao Dan, who had just bathed and was letting his hair loose to dry, motionless as if not quite human. Confucius withdrew and waited. When he was granted an audience, he said, "Am I deluded? Or is this truly so? Just now, Master, your form stood like withered wood, as if you had left all things and humanity behind, standing alone."

Lao Dan replied, "I let my heart wander in the beginning of things."

Confucius asked, "What do you mean?"

Lao Dan said, "The heart is confounded and cannot know; the mouth gapes and cannot speak. Let me try to discuss it with you. The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang blazes and surges. The solemn stillness emerges from heaven; the blazing surge arises from earth. The two intermingle, harmonize, and things are born. Some serve as their guiding principle, yet none see its form. They wax and wane, fill and empty, darken and brighten, daily transform and monthly change—all have their functions, yet none see their workings. Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Beginning and end revolve without end, yet none know their source. If not this, then what else could be their origin?"

Confucius said, "May I ask about wandering in this?"

Lao Dan replied, "To attain this is the utmost beauty and joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfected Person."

Confucius said, "I wish to hear of it."

Lao Dan said, "Beasts that eat grass do not fret over changing marshes; creatures that live in water do not fret over changing streams. They undergo small changes yet do not lose their great constancy. Joy and sorrow do not enter their breasts. The world is where the myriad things are one. To attain this oneness and be at one with it—then your four limbs and hundred bones will be but dust and grime, and life and death, beginning and end will be like day and night, unable to disturb you. How much less could gain and loss, fortune and misfortune affect you! Those who discard things are like those who discard mud and mire, knowing the body is more precious than a mere servant. The precious lies within me and does not lose itself to change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have never had an end—what could trouble the heart? Those who have mastered the Way understand this."

Confucius said, "Master, your virtue matches heaven and earth, yet you still borrow the finest words to cultivate it. Of the ancients, who could escape this?"

Lao Dan said, "Not so. Water, when it ripples, does nothing yet naturally displays its talent. Humans, in their virtue, do not cultivate it, yet things cannot depart from it. Like heaven’s natural height, earth’s natural depth, the sun and moon’s natural brightness—what cultivation is needed?"

Confucius left and told Yan Hui, "In the Way, I am like a vinegar fly! Were it not for the Master’s lifting of my covering, I would not have known the great completeness of heaven and earth."

Zhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu.

Duke Ai said, "Lu has many Confucian scholars, yet few follow your teachings."

Zhuangzi said, "Lu has *Ru* scholars."

Duke Ai said, "The entire state of Lu wears the Ru garb—how can you say there are few?"

Zhuangzi said, "I have heard that Ru scholars who wear the round cap understand the seasons; those who wear square-toed shoes understand the earth’s forms; those who wear loose jade pendants decide matters as they arise. A noble person who possesses the Way may not wear its garb; one who wears its garb may not know the Way. If Your Grace truly doubts this, proclaim throughout the state: ‘Those who lack this Way yet wear its garb shall be put to death!’"

Thereupon, Duke Ai issued the decree for five days, and no one in Lu dared wear the Ru garb. Only one man, clad in Ru attire, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs, testing him with a thousand turns and ten thousand shifts, yet he was never at a loss.

Zhuangzi said, "With the whole of Lu, there is but one Ru scholar—can this be called many?"

Baili Xi cared nothing for rank or salary, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. One who is unmoved by life or death can thus move others.

The Lord of Song Yuan was about to have paintings made. All the scribes arrived, bowed in reception, and stood ready, licking their brushes and mixing ink, with half still to come. One scribe arrived late, sauntering without haste. He received the bow but did not stand; instead, he went to his quarters. The Duke sent someone to observe him, and there he was, stripped to the waist, legs sprawled. The Duke said, "He will do—this is a true painter."

King Wen was inspecting Zang when he saw an old man fishing, yet his fishing was no fishing. He did not hold his rod as one who fishes, but fished as a matter of course. The King wished to raise him and entrust him with governance, but feared his great ministers and elders would not accept it. He wished to leave him be, yet could not bear the thought of the people being without heaven’s protection.

Then he addressed his ministers, saying: "Formerly, I dreamed of a worthy man—dark-complexioned and bearded—riding a dappled horse with one crimson hoof, who cried out: *'Entrust your governance to this elder, and perhaps the people may yet find relief!'*"

The ministers started in alarm and said: "It was our late lord, the former king."

King Wen said: "Then let us divine."

The ministers replied: "The command of the former king leaves no room for doubt—what need is there for divination?"

Thereupon they welcomed the elder from Zang and entrusted him with governance. No statutes were established; no decrees were issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and found: the knights had abandoned their ranks and scattered like herds; officials of high rank failed to cultivate virtue; and grain measures dared not cross the four borders. When knights abandon their ranks and scatter, it is because they esteem unity; when high officials fail to cultivate virtue, it is because they share a common purpose; when grain measures dare not enter the four borders, it is because the feudal lords harbor no divided loyalties.

King Wen then made him Grand Preceptor. Facing north, he asked: "Can governance extend to all under heaven?"

The elder remained silent and gave no answer, then vaguely declined, issuing orders by morning and fleeing by night, never to be heard of again.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "Was King Wen still lacking? Why then did he rely on a dream?"

Confucius said: "Hush! Say no more! King Wen had already perfected it—why criticize further? He merely followed the moment's necessity."

Lie Yukou drew his bow for Bohun Wuren, pulling it to full draw. He placed a cup of water on his elbow and loosed the arrow—each shaft followed the last, each arrow found its mark. In that moment, he was like a wooden figure.

Bohun Wuren said: "This is the archery of shooting, not the archery of non-shooting. Suppose I were to climb a high mountain with you, tread upon perilous stones, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you shoot then?"

Thereupon, Bohun Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod upon the perilous stones, and stood at the brink of the abyss. Turning his back to the void, with two parts of his feet dangling over the edge, he beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself upon the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

Bohun Wuren said: "The perfected person gazes into the azure sky, descends into the yellow springs, roams to the eight limits, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with the intent of a startled eye—how can you hope to hit the mark?"

Jian Wu asked Sunshu Ao: "You have thrice served as Prime Minister without pride, and thrice been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted, but now I see your countenance radiant—how do you cultivate your heart-mind?"

Sunshu Ao said: "How do I surpass others? I know that what comes may be refused, but what departs cannot be halted. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and so I show no sorrow. How do I surpass others? I do not know whether it lies with them or with me. If it lies with them, it is nothing to me; if it lies with me, it is nothing to them. I am ever in hesitation, ever looking about—how could I have leisure to consider the nobility or baseness of others?"

Confucius heard of this and said: "The true persons of old could not be swayed by the wise, nor seduced by the beautiful, nor coerced by others, nor befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor. Life and death are great matters, yet they wrought no change in themselves—how much less would rank and emolument! Such persons traverse the great mountains without obstruction, enter the deepest springs without getting wet, dwell in lowly and mean places without weariness. They fill all between heaven and earth, and though they give to others, they themselves remain replete."

The King of Chu sat with the Lord of Fan. After a while, the King’s attendants announced three times: "Fan is no more."

The Lord of Fan said: "That Fan is no more does not mean I am no more. If Fan’s demise cannot destroy my existence, then Chu’s existence cannot preserve its own. From this perspective, Fan never began, nor has Chu ever existed."

*Chapter 22: "Knowledge Wanders North"*

Knowledge wandered north to the Dark Waters, ascended the Hill of Hidden Hands, and there encountered Non-Action Speaking.

Knowledge said to Non-Action Speaking: "I wish to ask you: what thoughts, what reflections lead to the Dao? What dwelling, what conduct brings repose in the Dao? What following, what path attains the Dao?"

Three times Knowledge asked, yet Non-Action Speaking did not answer. Not that he refused to answer—he did not know how to answer.

Knowledge, unable to obtain an answer, returned south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Tower, and there beheld Mad Qu. Knowledge repeated his questions to Mad Qu.

Mad Qu said: "Alas! I know the answer and will tell you." But midway through speaking, he forgot what he wished to say.

Knowledge, still unable to obtain an answer, returned to the Celestial Palace and questioned the Yellow Emperor.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Only without thought, without reflection does one begin to know the Dao. Only without dwelling, without conduct does one begin to find repose in the Dao. Only without following, without path does one begin to attain the Dao."

Knowledge asked the Yellow Emperor: "You and I know this, but they do not—who is correct?"

The Yellow Emperor said: "Non-Action Speaking is right; Mad Qu approximates it. You and I never come close. The knowing do not speak; the speaking do not know. Thus the sage practices the teaching without words. The Dao cannot be conveyed; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence may be practiced, righteousness may be diminished, ritual is mutual pretense. Therefore it is said: 'Lose the Dao and virtue follows; lose virtue and benevolence follows; lose benevolence and righteousness follows; lose righteousness and ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of chaos.'

Thus it is said: 'Those who practice the Dao diminish daily, diminishing further and further until they reach non-action. With non-action, there is nothing that is not done.' Now that you have become a thing, to return to the root is not easy! How simple it is for the great person!

Life is the migration of death; death is the beginning of life—who knows their regulator? Human life is the gathering of qi. When it gathers, there is life; when it scatters, there is death. If life and death are but migrations, what cause have I for sorrow? Thus all things are one. What we deem wondrous is divine and marvelous; what we deem foul is rank and rotten. Yet the rank and rotten transform into the divine and marvelous, and the divine and marvelous transform into the rank and rotten. Therefore it is said: 'The world is but a single qi.' Thus the sage values oneness."

Empty of self, Know addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: "I questioned Non-Action, and Non-Action did not respond to me—was it not I to whom he did not respond? Or did he truly not know how to respond? I questioned Mad Qu, and Mad Qu wished to tell me but did not tell me—was it that he did not tell me? Or did he wish to tell me but forgot? Now I ask you, and you know—why then are you not near?"

The Yellow Emperor replied: "He is truly so because he does not know; this one is so because he has forgotten. You and I will never be near because we know."

Mad Qu heard this and took the Yellow Emperor to be one who understood words.

Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons follow bright patterns yet do not discuss them; the myriad things attain their principles yet do not explain them. The sage mirrors the beauty of Earth and penetrates the principles of the myriad things. Thus the perfected person practices non-action, the great sage does not act—this is called observing the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

Now that numinous clarity and utmost essence—though the hundred transformations, though things die and live, square and round—none know their root. Yet all things have existed since antiquity, self-so. The Six Directions form the vast, yet they do not depart; the tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it awaits completion to become a body. The world knows not one thing that does not rise and sink, yet all endure without permanence. Yin and yang, the four seasons revolve, each keeping to its order. As if absent yet present, effortlessly formless yet spirit-like, the myriad things are nurtured without awareness. This is called the root-source—by it one may observe Heaven!

Nie Que asked the Way of Clothed-in-Skins. Clothed-in-Skins said: "Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, still your measurements, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your beauty, the Dao will become your dwelling. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf’s, seeking nothing of the old."

Before the words were finished, Nie Que fell into slumber. Clothed-in-Skins rejoiced greatly, singing as he departed:

"Form like withered bones,
Heart like dead ashes,
True in their actual knowing,
Not clinging to the old.
Vague and obscure,
Without mind—who can scheme with them?
What manner of person is this!"

Shun asked his minister: "Can the Dao be possessed and held?"
The minister replied: "Your body is not your own possession—how could you possess the Dao?"

Shun said: "If my body is not my own, then whose is it?"
The minister replied: "It is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form. Life is not your possession—it is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted gift. Nature and destiny are not your possession—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted compliance. Children and descendants are not your possession—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted shedding. Thus, in walking, you know not where you go; in dwelling, you know not what you hold; in eating, you know not the taste. It is the vigorous yang qi of Heaven and Earth—how could it be possessed and held?"

Confucius asked Lao Dan: "Today I have leisure, and venture to inquire about the supreme Dao."
Lao Dan said: "Purify your rituals, dredge your channels, cleanse your spirit, and shatter your knowledge! The Dao—how profound and indescribable it is! I shall tell you its broad outlines."

The luminous arises from the obscure, order emerges from formlessness, spirit is born of the Dao, and physical form originates from essence—while the myriad things beget one another through form. Those with nine orifices are born from the womb; those with eight, from eggs. Their coming leaves no trace, their going no boundary; no gate, no chamber—yet they radiate boundlessly in all four directions. Those who wander thus possess supple limbs, penetrating insight, keen ears, and sharp eyes. Their minds do not toil, yet their responses know no limit. Heaven cannot but be high, Earth cannot but be vast; sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—such is the Dao!

Moreover, vast knowledge does not necessarily bring understanding, nor does eloquence guarantee wisdom. The sage has already settled this! That which, when augmented, does not increase, and when diminished, does not decrease—this is what the sage preserves. Profound as the sea, towering in its endless return to the beginning, it measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion. Thus the Dao of the noble person—does it lie outside these things? The myriad things all turn to it for sustenance, yet it is never depleted. Such is the Dao!

Within the Central Kingdom there is one who is neither yin nor yang, dwelling between Heaven and Earth, merely human for a time before returning to the Source. Viewed from its origin, life is but a fleeting coagulation of things. Though lifespans vary, how great is the difference? A mere instant—why debate the right and wrong of Yao and Jie? Fruits and melons have their patterns, human relations their complexities, yet these are but ways to order things. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes through them without clinging. To harmonize and respond is virtue; to coincide and respond is the Dao. From this arise emperors and kings.

Born between Heaven and Earth, one passes like a white colt through a gap—gone in an instant. Suddenly, vigorously, all things emerge; softly, smoothly, all things return. Transformed into life, then transformed into death. Living things mourn it, humankind grieves it. Yet Heaven’s quiver is unstrung, its celestial robe cast off. Twisting and turning, the soul departs, and the body follows. Thus the great return!

Not to be shaped by form, nor to shape the formless—this is what all people know, yet not what the realized strive for. This is the common discourse of the multitude. Those who have arrived do not debate; those who debate have not arrived. To perceive clearly yet find nothing to grasp, to speak without falling silent—this is not the great attainment. The Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is not as good as deafness: this is called the supreme attainment.

Dongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: "Where does the so-called Dao reside?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is nowhere absent."
Dongguo Zi said: "You must specify."
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the ants."
Dongguo Zi said: "Why so lowly?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the weeds."
Dongguo Zi said: "Why even lower?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the tiles."
Dongguo Zi said: "Why more extreme still?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in excrement and urine."
Dongguo Zi fell silent.

Zhuangzi said: "Your question fundamentally misses the mark. When Zheng and Huo asked the market inspector about the weight of a pig, the answer grew more precise with each lower part. You must not insist on a fixed locus—the Dao eludes nothing. The supreme Dao is like this, and so too is grand discourse. The three terms—pervasiveness, universality, and totality—differ in name but share the same reality; their intent is one. Let us wander together in the Palace of Nothingness, merging our discussions without end! Let us practice non-action together—serene and still, vast and clear, at ease and idle! My will is already empty; I go nowhere without knowing my destination, depart and return without knowing where I stop. I have come and gone without knowing my end, roaming in boundless expanse. Great knowledge enters here, yet knows no limit.

That which shapes things is not separate from things, yet things have boundaries—these are the boundaries of what shapes them. The boundary of the unbounded is the boundary of what is not a boundary. We speak of fullness and emptiness, decline and decay, yet what is full and empty is not fullness and emptiness; what declines and decays is not decline and decay. What has root and branch is not root and branch; what accumulates and disperses is not accumulation and dispersal."

Nü Ke studied with Shen Nong under Old Dragon Ji. One day, Shen Nong was resting with his head on a table, the door closed, napping in broad daylight. Nü Ke pushed open the door and entered, saying: "Old Dragon is dead!"
Shen Nong, still leaning on the table, grasped his staff and rose. Then, letting it clatter to the ground, he laughed and said: "Heaven knew my stubbornness and sloth, so it cast me aside and let him die. Alas, Master! You have died without ever unleashing your wild words!"

Yan Gangdiao heard this and said: "The embodiment is what all gentlemen under Heaven are bound to. Now, in the Dao, one has not even attained a ten-thousandth part of the tip of an autumn hair, yet still knows to conceal one’s wild words—how much more so, then, for one who embodies the Dao! It is seen yet has no form; heard yet makes no sound. Those who discourse on it call it the obscure and impenetrable, yet what they discourse on is not the Dao."

Thereupon Tai Qing asked Wu Qiong: "Do you know the Dao?"
Wu Qiong said: "I do not know."
Then he asked Wu Wei, who said: "I know the Dao."
Tai Qing asked: "In your knowing the Dao, is there a method?"
Wu Wei said: "There is."
Tai Qing asked: "What is this method like?"
Wu Wei said: "I know the Dao can be esteemed, can be debased, can be gathered, can be dispersed—this is the method by which I know the Dao."

Tai Qing took these words and asked Wu Shi: "If this is so, then between Wu Qiong’s not-knowing and Wu Wei’s knowing, which is right and which is wrong?"
Wu Shi said: "Not-knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external."

Thereupon Tai Qing sighed deeply and said: "Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?"
Wu Shi said: "The Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Do you know that the formless cannot be formed? The Dao cannot be named."

Wu said: "One who is asked about the Dao and responds does not know the Dao. Even one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao admits no questions; questions admit no answers. To question what admits no questions is to question the inscrutable. To answer what admits no answers is to lack inwardness. Confronting the inscrutable with what lacks inwardness—such a one outwardly does not observe the cosmos, inwardly does not know the Great Beginning. Thus he does not pass beyond Kunlun, nor roam in the Great Void."

Guang Yao asked Wu You: "Do you exist, Master? Or do you not exist?"
Guang Yao could not frame his question, and gazed intently at Wu You’s form—vast and empty. He looked at him all day yet saw nothing; listened yet heard nothing; grasped yet could not seize him.

Guang Yao said: "This is perfection! Who could attain this? I can attain being and non-being, yet I have not attained non-being of non-being. How could one reach this from non-existence?"

The master smith of Great Horse, though eighty years old, never missed by a hair’s breadth. Great Horse said: "Is it skill, or is there a Dao to it?"

The smith replied: "I have my discipline. At twenty, I took delight in forging hooks, and to all else I was blind—nothing but hooks did I scrutinize. What I employed was the unutilized, thereby prolonging its use. How much more so for that which is never not used! What thing does not draw upon it?"

Ran Qiu asked Confucius: "Can one know what preceded heaven and earth?"
Confucius said: "One can. The past is like the present."
Ran Qiu, failing to grasp the answer, withdrew.

The next day, he returned and said: "Yesterday I asked, 'Can one know what preceded heaven and earth?' You replied, 'One can. The past is like the present.' Yesterday I saw clearly, but today I am benighted. May I ask what this means?"
Confucius said: "Yesterday’s clarity came from the spirit first receiving it. Today’s benightedness comes from seeking it with what is not spirit! There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end. Before you existed, could you have had descendants?"

Ran Qiu did not respond.
Confucius said: "Enough! No further answer is needed. Do not use life to give birth to death, nor use death to give birth to life. Do life and death depend on one another? All share a single body. Was there something that existed before heaven and earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Things do not emerge before that which gives rise to them—yet there are things. Since there are things, there is no end. The sage’s love for others never ends, for he draws from this principle."

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "I once heard you say, 'Do not send off, do not welcome.' I venture to wander in this."
Confucius said: "The people of old transformed outwardly but remained unchanging within. The people of today transform inwardly but remain unchanging without. Those who transform with things are one with the unchanging. How can one be at ease with change or non-change? How can one be at ease with aligning with them? One must align with them without excess.

In the gardens of the Shiwei clan, the parks of the Yellow Emperor, the halls of Lord Yu, the chambers of Tang and Wu—gentlemen, like the masters of the Ru and Mo schools, still used right and wrong to vie with one another. How much more so the people of today! The sage dwells among things without harming them. One who does not harm things cannot be harmed by them. Only one who harms nothing can send off and welcome others.

Mountains and forests! Marshes and wilds! They make me joyful and glad! But before the joy is complete, sorrow follows. When sorrow and joy come, I cannot resist them; when they depart, I cannot stop them. Alas! People of the world merely take things as transient lodgings.

They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. Those without knowledge or ability are what people cannot avoid. To strive for what people cannot—is this not also lamentable?

Ultimate words discard words; ultimate action discards action. To equalize what knowledge knows is shallow indeed!"

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Gengsang Chu**

Among the disciples of Lao Dan was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially grasped the Master’s Dao. He went north to dwell in the mountains of Weilei. Those among his retainers who were scheming and calculating he sent away; those among his concubines who were ostentatiously kind he kept at a distance. Only the dull and the clumsy remained with him, and the restless and the harried served him.

After three years, Weilei flourished. The people of Weilei said to one another: “When Master Gengsang first arrived, we found him strange and unsettling. Now, when we reckon our days, we find them lacking, but when we reckon our years, we find them abundant. He must be a sage! Why do you not join together to offer him sacrifices as to an ancestral spirit, to honor him as you would the gods of soil and grain?”

When Gengsang Chu heard this, he turned southward, his countenance troubled. His disciples were perplexed. Gengsang Chu said: “Why are you puzzled by me? When the spring qi stirs, the hundred grasses sprout; when autumn arrives in due season, the ten thousand treasures ripen. Are spring and autumn themselves responsible for this? The Dao of Heaven has simply run its course. I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse in a walled chamber, while the common people run wild, not knowing where to turn. Now these petty folk of Weilei secretly wish to place me among the worthy, offering me sacrificial vessels. Am I truly the sort of person to be measured thus? This is why I cannot let go of the words of Lao Dan.”

His disciples said: “This is not so.”

In a mere ditch of ordinary breadth, the great fish has no room to turn its body, while the newt and loach rule there; on a hillock of but seven feet, the mighty beast cannot conceal its frame, while the wretched fox is deemed auspicious. Moreover, to honor the worthy and empower the capable, to put goodness and profit first—this has been so since the days of Yao and Shun, let alone the folk of Weilei! Master, you should heed this!”

Gengsang Chu replied: “Come here, my disciples! The beast that fills a carriage, once armored and parted from the mountains, cannot escape the snares and nets; the fish that swallows a boat, once stranded on dry land, is tormented by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not scorn the heights, nor do fish and turtles scorn the depths. For one who preserves his bodily life, to conceal himself is nothing less than to shun all that is shallow and near!

As for those two sages, what are they worth extolling? Their sophistry is like recklessly hacking at walls to plant mugwort and wormwood. Combing their hair to a fine sheen, counting grains of rice to cook—how can such petty fussing ever save the age? Where worth is exalted, the people contend; where cunning is employed, the people steal. These few things are not enough to enrich the people.

The people’s zeal for profit is extreme: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers; in broad daylight they rob, at midday they bore through walls. I tell you: the root of great disorder must have arisen in the age of Yao and Shun, and its branches will endure for a thousand generations. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.”

Nanrong Chu straightened himself and sat upright, saying: “As for one like me, Chu, my years are already advanced—how then may I entrust myself to this learning and attain these words?”

The Master said: “Preserve your form whole, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts and cares flutter restlessly. If you do these three things for three years, then you may attain these words.”

Nanrong Chu said: “The eye and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves. The ear and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves. The heart and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The form and the form are surely distinct, yet why do things come between them? I seek to unite them but cannot attain it. Now you tell me, Chu: ‘Preserve your form whole, embrace your life, let not your thoughts and cares flutter.’ I strain to hear the Dao, yet it only reaches my ears!”

Gengsangzi said: “My words are exhausted. The running bee cannot transform the hollyhock caterpillar; the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg—yet the common hen can! The hen and the hen: their virtue is not different. That some can and some cannot is simply that their capacities are inherently great or small. Now my capacity is small—it is just enough to transform you. Why do you not go south to see Laozi?”

Nanrong Chu gathered provisions and, after seven days and seven nights, arrived at Laozi’s abode. Laozi said: “Have you come from the region of Chu?” Nanrong Chu replied: “Yes.” Laozi said: “Why have you brought so many people with you?” Nanrong Chu looked around in alarm. Laozi said: “Do you not understand what I meant?” Nanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then raised it and sighed: “Now I have forgotten my answer to your question.”

Laozi said: “What do you mean?” Nanrong Chu said: “If I do not know, people call me foolish. If I know, I am filled with sorrow. Without ren, I harm others; with ren, I bring sorrow upon myself. Without yi, I injure others; with yi, I bring sorrow upon myself. How can I escape this? These words are what trouble me, Chu. I wish to ask you through the example of Chu.”

Laozi said: “Just now, I saw it in the space between your brows and lashes—I had already grasped you. Now you speak again and confirm it. You are like one who has lost his parents, raising a pole to search the sea. You are a lost man—how bewildered! You wish to return to your true nature but have no way in. How pitiful!”

Nanrong Chu asked to enter and rest in a dwelling. He summoned what he loved and cast aside what he hated. For ten days he brooded, then saw Laozi again. Laozi said: “You have cleansed yourself—how deeply troubled you still are! Yet within, there still lingers something foul. Those bound by external constraints cannot be grasped by force; they must be inwardly restrained. Those bound by internal constraints cannot be seized by deception; they must be outwardly restrained. Those bound by both internal and external constraints—even the power of the Dao and virtue cannot uphold them, let alone those who wander beyond the Dao!”

Nanrong Chu said: “When a villager is ill, another villager asks after him. If the sick one can describe his illness, then though he speaks of it, his illness is as if it were not an illness. As for my hearing of the great Dao, it is like taking medicine that only worsens the sickness. I wish only to hear the classic of preserving life.”

Laozi said: “The classic of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you set aside what others seek and seek it within yourself? Can you be free and unconstrained? Can you be open and unassuming? Can you be like a child? A child wails all day yet its throat does not grow hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony. It clutches all day yet its hand does not cramp—such is the sharing of its power. It gazes all day yet its eyes do not blink—its focus is not on externals. It walks without knowing where it goes, dwells without knowing what it does, moves with things in perfect accord, riding their waves. This is the classic of preserving life.”

Nanrong Chu said: “Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?” Laozi said: “It is not.”

What is called the thawing of ice—can you do this? The perfected person shares sustenance with the earth and rejoices with heaven, untouched by the gains and harms of others, not given to marveling, scheming, or contriving. They come and go with effortless grace, open and unassuming. This is the classic of preserving life.”

Nanrong Chu said: “Then is this perfection itself?”
Laozi said: “It is not. I have already told you: ‘Can you be like a child?’ A child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like a withered branch, its heart like dead ashes. In this state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how could there be calamity?”

When the mind is settled in great peace, it radiates the light of heaven. One who radiates this light is seen as human. Those who cultivate themselves now possess constancy. Constancy is what others abandon and heaven aids. What people abandon is called the people of heaven; what heaven aids is called the son of heaven.

The learner studies what cannot be learned; the doer acts in what cannot be acted; the debater argues what cannot be argued. To know when to stop at what cannot be known—this is the utmost. If there is any who does not conform to this, the balance of heaven will undo them.

Prepare things to sustain the form, conceal the unforeseen to nurture the mind, and honor the center to reach the other. If, despite this, myriad evils still arrive, they are from heaven, not from man—they cannot disturb completion or enter the sacred chamber. The sacred chamber has its support, yet one does not know what supports it, nor can it be grasped.

When sincerity stirs within and manifests, each manifestation may be amiss. Once karma takes hold, it does not release, and with each turn, one strays further. To do evil in the light is for people to condemn; to do evil in the dark is for ghosts to condemn. Only one who is clear about people and clear about ghosts can walk alone.

Within the contract, act without name; beyond the contract, aspire to costly expectations. Acting without name is the way of the common; aspiring to costly expectations is the way of the merchant. People see their striving and deem it grand. Yet one who exhausts things is entered by things; one who contends with things cannot even contain themselves—how could they contain others? One who cannot contain others has no kinship; one with no kinship is forsaken by all.

No weapon is sharper than the will; even the finest blade is inferior. No foe is greater than yin and yang—there is no escape from them between heaven and earth. It is not yin and yang that harm, but the heart that employs them.

The Dao flows—its division is its completion, its completion is its undoing. What is despised in division is that it leads to preparation; what is despised in preparation is that it implies possession. To depart and not return is to become a ghost; to depart and gain is to gain death. To vanish yet retain substance is one aspect of ghosts. By using the formed to model the formless, one may attain certainty!

To emerge without origin, to enter without aperture—possessing substance yet no place, having length yet no root or tip. That which emerges without aperture possesses substance. Possessing substance yet no place is space; having length yet no root or tip is time.

There is existence, there is death; there is existence, there is entry. To enter and exit without revealing form is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is non-being—all things emerge from non-being. Being does not take being as being; it must emerge from non-being, and non-being itself is not a non-being. The sage conceals himself herein.

The ancients—how far their knowledge reached! Where did it reach? Some held that there had never yet been anything—this is the utmost, the limit, beyond which nothing can be added. Next were those who acknowledged things, seeing life as loss and death as return—thus they made distinctions. Then came those who said that at first there was nothing, then suddenly there was life, and life swiftly turned to death. They took non-being as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail. Whoever knows the unity of existence, non-existence, death, and life—I befriend them. Though these three differ, they belong to the same clan.

The Zhaos and Jings were illustrious and honored; the Jia clan was illustrious and enfeoffed—yet they were not one. There is life, yet it is said to shift. I have spoken of this shifting, but it is not what I meant. Still, it cannot be known.

The sacrificial meats of the winter sacrifice can be scattered, yet they cannot be scattered. The observer of a chamber circles the ancestral temple, then proceeds to the private quarters—this is called "shifting the this." Let me try to speak of this shifting. Taking life as the root, knowledge as the teacher, one rides upon right and wrong. If there is indeed substance, one uses oneself as the measure, making others conform to one’s standards and even dying to uphold them. Such a one takes utility as wisdom, non-utility as folly, thoroughness as fame, and failure as disgrace. This shifting is the way of people today—like the cicada and the fledgling bird, they are the same in their sameness.

To tread on a market-goer’s foot, one apologizes with haughty words; to a brother, with gentle ones; to a parent, one says nothing at all. Thus it is said: The utmost ritual has no "no"; the utmost righteousness does not treat things as things; the utmost knowledge does not scheme; the utmost benevolence has no kinship; the utmost trust dispenses with metal.

Dispel the turbulence of the will, untangle the knots of the heart, cast off the burdens of virtue, and clear the blockages of the Dao. Wealth, honor, prominence, prestige, fame, and profit—these six are the turbulence of the will. Appearance, movement, complexion, pattern, qi, and intent—these six are the knots of the heart. Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—these six are the burdens of virtue. Withdrawal, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability—these six are the blockages. When these four sets of six no longer churn in the breast, one is upright; upright, one is still; still, one is clear; clear, one is empty; empty, one does nothing yet nothing is left undone.

The Dao is the reverence of virtue; life is the vessel of virtue; nature is the essence of life.

The movement of nature is called *wei*; the artificiality of *wei* is called loss.

Knowledge is contact; wisdom is planning. What the wise do not know is like a sidelong glance.

Movement from inevitability is called virtue; movement without self is governance. Names oppose each other, yet realities align.

Yi excelled at hitting the smallest mark but was clumsy at preventing others from praising him. The sage excels at Heaven but is clumsy with people. Only the whole person can excel at Heaven while being adept with people.

Though creatures may act as creatures, they act as Heaven. Does the whole person despise Heaven? Do they despise the Heaven in people? How much more, then, the Heaven in oneself and others!

When a sparrow comes to Yi, Yi must catch it—this is fate. If one takes the world as a cage, no sparrow can escape. Thus, Tang caged Yi Yin with human means, and Duke Mu of Qin caged Bai Li Xi with five sheepskins. Therefore, nothing can be caged except by means of what it loves.

The cripple draws boundaries, indifferent to external praise or blame. The convict climbs high without fear, having forgotten life and death. One who recovers from stumbling without resentment has forgotten others; forgetting others, one thereby becomes Heaven.

Thus, one who is revered yet feels no joy, or insulted yet feels no anger—only one in harmony with Heaven’s accord is so. Anger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action.

To still the mind, calm the qi; to be spirit-like, follow the heart. In action, to be fitting is to act from inevitability. The way of the sage lies in the category of inevitability.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Xu Wu Gui** *(from Book Eight, "Middle")*

Xu Wu Gui, through Nü Shang, was received by Marquis Wu of Wei. The marquis greeted him, saying, "Master, you must be weary—exhausted by the toils of mountain and forest, and thus willing to meet with me."

Xu Wu Gui replied, "It is I who weary you, my lord—what weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the natural emotions of your nature will sicken. If you suppress your desires and cast off likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I weary you, my lord—what weariness have you for me?"

The marquis, startled, made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wu Gui continued, "Let me tell you, my lord—I read the signs in dogs. The inferior kind stops when its belly is full—this is the virtue of the wildcat..."

The superior kind acts as though it has lost its singular purpose. I read the signs in dogs, yet this is not to be compared with how I read the signs in horses. When I read the signs in horses: the straight aligns with the marking-line, the curved fits the hook, the square meets the carpenter’s square, the round matches the compass—these are the horses of the state, yet they do not compare to the horses of the world. The horses of the world possess a perfected nature: as though grieving, as though lost, as though they have forgotten their singular purpose. Such are they who transcend the dust, leaving no trace of their passing."

Marquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed. When Xu Wu Gui departed, Nü Shang asked, "Master, how did you alone delight our lord? When I seek to please him, I expound horizontally with the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, or I expound vertically with the *Golden Tablets* and *Six Strategies*. Those who serve him with great merit are beyond counting, yet our lord has never once parted his lips in response. How is it that you have delighted him so?"

Xu Wu Gui replied, "I simply told him of how I read the signs in dogs and horses."

Nü Shang said, "Is that all?"

Xu Wu Gui continued, "Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? When they leave their state for a few days, they rejoice at seeing those they know. When they leave for a month, they rejoice at seeing those they once saw in their state. After a year, they rejoice even at seeing those who merely resemble people. Is it not true that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper the longing grows? Those who flee into the emptiness, who wander the paths of foxes and weasels among the brambles and thorns, stumbling through the void—when they hear the sound of human footsteps, they rejoice. How much more so for the voices and sighs of brothers and kin at their side! How long has it been since the words of a true person have sighed at our lord’s side?"

Xu Wu Gui was received by Marquis Wu, who said, "Sir, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating acorns and chestnuts, weary of scallions and leeks, yet you deign to visit this lonely one. Are you now aged? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or does this lonely one possess some blessing of state and altars?"

Xu Wu Gui replied, "Wu Gui was born in poverty and has never dared to partake of your lordship’s wine and meat. I have come to offer you labor."

The Marquis said, "What labor? How would you labor this lonely one?"

Xu Wu Gui answered, "To labor your spirit and form."

Marquis Wu said, "What do you mean?"

Xu Wu Gui replied, "The nurturance of Heaven and Earth is one—ascending high does not make one tall, nor descending low make one short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, afflict the people of your state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. The spirit does not act for itself. The spirit loves harmony and detests perversity. Perversity is sickness, and thus it labors you. Why do you alone suffer from this sickness?"

Marquis Wu said, "I have longed for you, sir! I wish to cherish the people and practice righteousness by laying down arms. Is this possible?"

Xu Wu Gui said, "It is not. To cherish the people is to harm them; to practice righteousness and lay down arms is to plant the root of warfare. If you proceed thus, you will scarcely succeed. All perfected beauty is a baleful instrument. Though you act with righteousness, you will verge on falsity! Form inevitably begets form; completion inevitably invites attack; change inevitably provokes external strife. You must not array your finest cranes between the towering watchtowers. Do not stable your swiftest steeds in the palace of carved eaves. Do not harbor treachery in success! Do not seek to overcome others with skill, nor with strategy, nor with war. Those who slay others, who seize others’ lands to nourish their own desires and spirits—how can one know which side is good in such strife? And what is the good of victory? If you must persist, then cultivate sincerity within your breast to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not disturb them. The people are already freed from death—why then would you lay down arms?

When the Yellow Emperor sought to meet the Great Hidden One on Mount Juci, Fang Ming drove his chariot, Chang Yu rode at his side, Zhang Ruo and Xi Peng led the horses, and Kun Gu Ji followed in the rear carriage. When they reached the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all lost their way and had nowhere to ask directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and asked him the way. 'Do you know Mount Juci?' they said. 'I do,' he replied. 'Do you know where the Great Hidden One dwells?'"

The boy said, "I do." The Yellow Emperor said, "How extraordinary, this little boy! Not only do you know Mount Juci, but you also know where the Great Hidden One dwells. I beg to ask you about governing the world." The boy replied, "Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do? When I was young, I wandered freely within the six directions. Then I fell ill with dizziness, and an elder taught me, saying, 'Ride the chariot of the sun and wander the wilds of Xiangcheng.' Now that my illness has slightly improved, I am about to wander again beyond the six directions. Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do?"

The Yellow Emperor said, "Governing Heaven may indeed not be your concern, yet still, I beg to ask about governing the world." The boy declined. The Yellow Emperor asked again. The boy said, "What makes governing the world different from herding horses? Simply remove what harms them—that is all." The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and called him "Heavenly Master" before withdrawing.

Scholars who lack the changes of thought find no joy; debaters who lack the order of discourse find no joy; inspectors who lack the task of reproach—all are confined by things. Those who summon the age serve the court; those of middling ability hold office with honor. The strong boast of overcoming difficulties; the brave rush to meet calamity; soldiers delight in war; the withered cling to fame; legalists expand governance; ritualists refine their demeanor; the noble of benevolence and righteousness seek connections.

Farmers without the task of clearing wild land do not thrive; merchants without the bustle of the marketplace do not thrive. Commoners with daily work are diligent; those skilled in tools and machines are robust. Those who hoard no wealth worry the greedy; those who lack prominence grieve the boastful. Followers of power and things delight in change. When the times call for use, they cannot be without action—all these align with the seasons, not with the constancy of transformation. They exhaust their nature and form, sinking into the ten thousand things, never to return.

Zhuangzi said, "If an archer hits the mark without aiming beforehand, is he a good shot? If so, then everyone in the world is Yi—is that acceptable?" Huizi said nothing. Zhuangzi continued, "The world has no shared truth, and each affirms what they affirm. If so, then everyone in the world is Yao—is that acceptable?" Huizi said nothing.

Zhuangzi said, "Then among the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists—five in all with you—who is truly right? Or is it like Lu Ju? His disciple said, 'I have grasped the Master’s Way! I can boil a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer!' Lu Ju replied, 'This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way.' Thereupon, he tuned two zithers, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When the *gong* note was struck, the *jiao* note resonated; when the *jue* note was struck, the *jiao* note responded—their tones harmonized. But if one string were adjusted so that it no longer fit the five notes, and all twenty-five strings were struck, the sounds would not differ, yet the ruler of tones would already be present. Is it like this?"

Huizi said, "Now the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all debate, clashing with words and overpowering with voices, yet none admit they are wrong—how is this?" Zhuangzi said, "A man of Qi sent his son to Song to serve as a gatekeeper, but did not provide him with proper provisions. When he sought a bronze bell, he bound it; when he sought Tang’s son, he never left the domain—such are the remnants of folly! A man sent as a gatekeeper to lodge in another’s home, who in the dead of night fights with the boatman when no one is around, has not yet left the shore yet stirs up resentment."

Zhuangzi was attending a funeral and passed by Huizi’s grave. Turning to his followers, he said, "A man of Ying had a speck of plaster on the tip of his nose no thicker than a fly’s wing. He called a craftsman to remove it. The craftsman swung his axe with the force of the wind, listening as he struck, removing all the plaster without harming the nose. The man of Ying stood unmoved. When the Lord of Song Yuan heard of this, he summoned the craftsman and said, 'Try doing it for me.' The craftsman replied, 'Your servant once could do this, but the material for my skill has long been dead.' Since Huizi’s death, I have had no material for my skill, no one to speak with."

Guan Zhong fell ill, and Duke Huan asked him, "Your illness is grave. If I may ask, when it reaches its worst, to whom should I entrust the state?" Guan Zhong said, "Whom does the Duke wish to appoint?" The Duke said, "Bao Shuya." Guan Zhong replied, "He is not suitable. He is a man of purity and integrity, a good scholar. Those who are not like him, he does not associate with. Moreover, once he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. If you appoint him to govern, above he will probe the ruler, and below he will oppose the people. It will not be long before he offends you."

The Duke said, "Then who is suitable?" Guan Zhong replied, "If you must choose, then Xi Peng is suitable. His character is such that he forgets those above and distances himself from those below. He feels ashamed that he is not like the Yellow Emperor and pities those who are not like himself. To share virtue with others is called sageliness; to share wealth with others is called worthiness. To rule others with worthiness never wins their hearts; to humble oneself with worthiness never fails to win them. In governing the state, he does not hear what he should not; in managing his household, he does not see what he should not. If you must choose, then Xi Peng is suitable."

The King of Wu floated upon the river and ascended the Mountain of the Macaques. The macaques, seeing him, in alarm abandoned their perches and fled, vanishing into the dense thickets. One, however, slithered and scratched, displaying its cunning before the king. The king shot at it, but the macaque nimbly caught the swift arrow. The king then ordered his attendants to hasten and shoot it, and the macaque was seized and killed. The king turned to his minister Yan Buyi and said, "This macaque, priding itself on its skill and relying on its agility, dared to mock me—thus it met its doom. Take heed! Alas, never let your demeanor make others proud."

Yan Buyi returned home and took Dong Wu as his teacher. He uprooted his arrogance, abandoned pleasure, and declined honors. After three years, the people of the state praised him.

Nanbo Ziqi leaned upon his armrest and sat, gazing upward and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said, "Master, you are the most extraordinary of beings—can your form be made like withered bones, and can your heart truly be made like dead ashes?"

He replied, "Once I dwelled in a mountain cave. At that time, when the fields and crops caught a single glimpse of me, the multitudes of Qi all thrice congratulated one another."

I must first possess it, and thus they know it; I must first offer it for sale, and thus they sell it. If I do not possess it, how can they know it? If I do not sell it, how can they peddle it? Alas! I grieve for those who lose themselves, and I grieve yet more for those who grieve for them. And I grieve still further for those who grieve over the grief of others—ever receding into the distance!

When Confucius traveled to Chu, the king of Chu offered him wine. Sunshu Ao stood holding the goblet, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and made a libation, saying, "How ancient are these words!" Then he said, "I, Qiu, have heard of the speech that is without words, yet have never spoken it—until now. Shinan Yiliao juggles balls, a puzzle hard to unravel; Sunshu Ao sleeps sweetly, holding a feather fan, while the people of Ying lay down their weapons. I wish I had a beak three feet long!"

That is called the Dao that is not the Dao, the eloquence that is without words. Thus virtue gathers in the unity of the Dao, and speech rests where knowledge cannot reach—this is perfection. What the Dao unifies, virtue shares; what knowledge cannot know, eloquence cannot express. Names like "Confucian" or "Mohist" bring only misfortune.

Thus the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—this is the utmost in greatness. A person embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know their name. Therefore, in life they bear no rank, in death no posthumous title; they accumulate no wealth, nor do they seek fame—this is called the Great Person. A dog is not good because it barks well, nor is a person worthy because they speak well—how much less so for the great! To be great is not enough to be called great, how much less so for virtue! Yet greatness is complete—none surpasses heaven and earth. But what do they seek? And yet they are complete!

Those who know completeness seek nothing, lose nothing, discard nothing, and do not exchange themselves for things. Turning inward, they are inexhaustible; following the ancient, they do not wear away—this is the way of the Great Person!

Ziqi had eight sons. He lined them up before him and summoned Jiufang Yin, saying, "Examine my sons for me and tell me which is most auspicious." Jiufang Yin replied, "Kun is auspicious." Ziqi started in surprise and joy, asking, "In what way?" He replied, "Kun will share the ruler’s table for the rest of his life." Ziqi’s face fell, and tears streamed down as he said, "What has my son done to reach such an extreme?" Jiufang Yin said, "One who shares the ruler’s table bestows blessings upon three clans—how much more so upon parents! Now that you have heard this and weep, you reject good fortune. Your son is auspicious, but you are not."

Ziqi said, "Yin, how could you understand? Is Kun truly auspicious? His fate is bound to meat and wine, entering only through nose and mouth—how can one know its origin? I have never herded sheep, yet a ewe was born in the inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet a quail hatched in the rafters. If this is not strange, then what is? What I share with my sons is wandering in the realm of heaven and earth. With them, I roam in joy beneath the sky and feast upon the earth. I do not involve them in affairs, nor in schemes, nor in strangeness. With them, I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth, not entangling them with things. With them, I drift and flow, not binding them to the concerns of the world. Yet now, this has brought worldly recompense!

Whenever there are strange omens, there must be strange conduct—how perilous! This is not the fault of my sons or me, but of heaven! That is why I weep."

Before long, Kun was sent to Yan. Bandits seized him on the road. Selling him whole would be difficult, but maiming him would make it easy. So they cut off his feet and sold him in Qi, where he ended up in the employ of Duke Qu, eating meat for the rest of his life.

Nie Que met Xu You and asked, "Where are you going?" He replied, "I am fleeing Yao." "What do you mean?" Xu You said, "Yao is so earnestly benevolent—yet I fear he will become a laughingstock to the world. Later generations may even turn to cannibalism! The people are not hard to gather: love them, benefit them, and they come; praise them, and they are encouraged. But impose what they hate, and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, yet those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity—it is but a vessel for the greedy and predatory. Thus, when one person’s judgment controls the world’s benefits, it is like a single glance. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world, but he does not know they also harm it—only those outside worthiness understand this."

There are those who are *nuan shu*, those who are *ru xu*, and those who are *juan lou*.

The *nuan shu* learn the words of a single master, then glow with self-satisfaction, believing themselves complete—yet they do not know that nothing has truly begun. Thus they are called *nuan shu*.

The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: sparse bristles become their vast palace and park. The curves of hooves and knees, the spaces between teats and thighs—these they take as safe dwellings and advantageous places. They do not know that the butcher, with a single wave of his arm, spreads straw and wields fire, and they will be roasted along with the pig. They advance and retreat within their domain—this is what is called *ru xu*.

The *juan lou* is like Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton—because mutton is rank. Shun had rank conduct, and the people delighted in him. Thus, when he moved to Chengdu, by the time he reached the ruins of Deng, a hundred thousand households had gathered. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from the barren land, saying, "I hope to receive his blessings." Shun was raised from the barren land, and though his years grew long and his hearing and sight waned, he could not retire. This is what is called *juan lou*.

The divine person detests the crowd’s arrival, for when the crowd arrives, they do not harmonize; when they do not harmonize, no benefit comes of it.

Thus, one who is neither overly intimate nor overly distant, who embraces virtue and warms harmony to align with all under heaven—this is called the *True Person*. To ants, wisdom is discarded; to fish, calculation is fitting; to sheep, intent is abandoned.

With the eye, one sees the eye; with the ear, one hears the ear; with the heart, one returns to the heart. Such a one is level as a plumb line, and in change, follows the natural course. The *True Person* of old! With heaven, they await humanity; they do not force humanity into heaven. The *True Person* of old! In gaining it, they live; in losing it, they die. In gaining it, they die; in losing it, they live.

Medicines—such as aconite, platycodon, chicken pox, and pig’s rot—are the tools of emperors. How can they all be enumerated! Goujian, with a thousand shields and spears, took refuge at Kuaiji. Only Wen Zhong could know how ruin would become survival, yet even he did not know why his own person would suffer sorrow.

Thus it is said: The owl’s eye has its proper place; the crane’s leg has its proper length—severing them brings sorrow. Thus it is said: When wind passes over a river, it diminishes it; when the sun passes over a river, it diminishes it. If only wind and sun were to guard the river together, the river would deem them no disturbance at all, for it relies on its source and flows onward.

Thus, water’s adherence to earth is precise; its adherence to humanity, and things’ adherence to things, are likewise precise. The eye’s reliance on clarity is perilous; the ear’s reliance on acuity is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of desire is perilous. All faculties, when bound to their storehouses, become perilous, and once peril is formed, it cannot be swiftly remedied. Disaster’s growth is dense and clustered; its reversal depends on merit; its fruition awaits time.

That people regard this as their treasure—is it not lamentable! Thus, the ruin of states and the slaughter of people never cease, for they do not inquire into the cause. The foot’s tread upon the earth is firm, yet it relies on what it does not tread to walk broadly. Humanity’s knowledge is scant, yet it relies on what it does not know to comprehend heaven.

To know the Great Oneness, the Great Yin, the Great Vision, the Great Equality, the Great Square, the Great Faith, the Great Constancy—this is perfection! The Great Oneness unites them; the Great Yin dissolves them; the Great Vision sees them; the Great Equality follows them; the Great Square embodies them; the Great Faith verifies them; the Great Constancy upholds them.

There is the Heavenly Cycle, the Illuminating Obscurity, the Pivot of Beginning, the That-and-This. In dissolving them, one seems not to dissolve; in knowing them, one seems not to know. Only by not knowing does one come to know. In questioning them, one cannot set limits, yet cannot be without limits. Though tangled and slippery, they hold truth. Past and present alternate, yet cannot be diminished—can this not be called great clarification?

Why not simply inquire into this, and what confusion remains? To be confused by what is not confusing, and return to what is not confusing—this is the highest non-confusion.

Zeyang traveled to Chu, and Yi Jie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not summon him. Yi Jie returned home. Pengyang met Wang Guo and said, "Why did the Master not recommend me to the king?" Wang Guo replied, "I am not as good as Gong Yuxiu."

Pengyang asked, "What does Gong Yuxiu do?" Wang Guo said, "In winter, he spears turtles in the river; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. If someone passes by and asks, he says, ‘This is my dwelling.’ Yi Jie could not match him—how much less could I! I am not even Yi Jie’s equal.

"Yi Jie’s character is virtuous and wise, yet he does not presume. His interactions with the spirit-like are steadfast, firmly rooted in the realm of wealth and honor. If not for mutual aid in virtue, they would only erode one another. The frozen borrow clothes from spring; the overheated turn back to winter’s cold wind.

"His demeanor is dignified and stern. In matters of punishment, he pardons none, like a tiger. If not for a cunning man’s rectification of virtue, who could sway him? Thus, when the sage is in poverty, he makes his family forget their want; when he is in prominence, he makes kings and lords forget their ranks and transform into humility.

"Toward things, he delights in them; toward people, he rejoices in their communion while preserving himself. Thus, sometimes without speaking, he harmonizes others; standing beside them, he transforms them, as naturally as the proper relationship between father and son. Such is his way of returning. Dwelling in stillness, he observes the scope of his influence. His effect on the human heart is so distant.

"Thus, it is said, ‘Await Gong Yuxiu.’"

The sage’s comprehension is thorough and all-encompassing, yet he does not know it as such—it is his nature. He responds to fate and acts, taking heaven as his teacher, while others follow and name him. Anxious in knowledge, his actions seldom endure. When they cease, what then?

One born beautiful is given a mirror by others; if not told, they do not know their beauty surpasses others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their joy is endless, and others’ fondness for them is likewise endless—it is their nature.

The sage’s love for people is such that others name it for him; if told, they do not know his love for people. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, his love is endless, and people’s contentment in it is likewise endless—it is his nature.

An old state, an old capital—gazing upon them brings delight. Even if nine-tenths were overgrown with hills, grass, and trees, one would still delight in them. How much more so when seeing and hearing what is familiar, like a ten-fathom banner amidst the crowd!

Ran Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring and followed completion, moving with things without end or beginning, without nearness or time. One who daily transforms with things is one with them. Why ever abandon this?

To take heaven as one’s teacher and yet fail to do so, to be enslaved with things—how can one make this one’s task? The sage has never begun, never begun with humanity, never begun with beginning, never begun with things. They move with the world without ceasing, their actions complete yet not excessive. How could they be otherwise?"

Tang obtained his steward, Gatekeeper Yin Deng Heng, to serve as his tutor, following the teacher without constraint—thus attaining the freedom of following completion. He oversaw names: when names exceeded the law, he discerned both sides.

Confucius, in exhausting his thoughts, served as his tutor. The House of Rong Cheng said: *"Remove days, and there are no years; no inner, no outer."*

When Wei Ying made a pact with Marquis Tian Mou, the latter betrayed it. Enraged, Wei Ying intended to send an assassin. Xishou Gongsun Yan, hearing of this, felt shame and said: *"You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would avenge yourself like a common man. Allow me to lead two hundred thousand armored troops to attack him, seize his people, his cattle and horses, and make his lord’s heart burn within until his back erupts in sores. Then I will take his state. When Ji flees, I will strike his back and break his spine."*

The Master, hearing this, felt shame and said: *"To build a city wall seventy feet high, only to tear it down once completed—this is the toil of convict laborers. Now war has raged for seven years; this is the foundation of your kingship. Yan is a disturber of order; do not heed him."*

Hua Zi, hearing this, found it disgraceful and said: *"He who speaks well of attacking Qi is a disturber; he who speaks well of not attacking is also a disturber. To say, ‘Whether to attack or not—both are disturbers’—is yet another disturber."*

The lord asked: *"Then what should be done?"*
He replied: *"Seek only the Dao!"*

Upon hearing this, the lord went to see Dai Jinren. Dai Jinren said: *"There is a creature called the snail—do you know it?"*
*"Yes,"* the lord replied.
*"On the left horn of the snail is a state called Chus; on the right horn, a state called Mans. They constantly fight over land, with tens of thousands falling in battle, pursuing the routed for fifteen days before returning."*
The lord exclaimed: *"Alas! Is this an empty tale?"*

Dai Jinren said: *"Allow me to make this real for you. When Your Lordship’s thoughts roam the four directions and above and below, do they reach a limit?"*
The lord replied: *"They do not."*
*"If you know to let your mind wander in the boundless, yet return to the states that lie within reach—do they not seem as if they exist, as if they do not?"*
The lord said: *"So it is."*
*"Among the states within reach lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies Your Lordship. Is there any difference between you and the Mans?"*
The lord said: *"There is no difference."*
The guest departed, and the lord sat in a daze as if something had been lost.

After the guest left, Master Hui came to see him. The lord said: *"That guest is a great man—even a sage cannot compare to him."*
Master Hui said: *"When one blows into a large bamboo pipe, there is a deep sound; when one blows into the hilt of a sword, there is but a faint whistle. Yao and Shun are those whom men praise. Yet to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint whistle."*

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the thatched hut of Ant Mound. His neighbor had a household of husband, wife, servants, and concubines who had climbed onto the roof. Zilu said: *"What is this bustling crowd doing?"*
Zhongni said: *"They are the servants of a sage. They bury themselves in the wilds, conceal themselves in the margins. Their voices fade, their wills are boundless, their mouths may speak, but their hearts never utter a word. They go against the world and disdain to follow it. These are the ones who sink into obscurity—is this not Shi Kuang of the southern market?"*
Zilu asked to go and summon them. Confucius said: *"Enough! He knows that I am aware of him, that I am traveling to Chu, and that I would surely have the King of Chu summon him. He would take me for a flatterer. If he feels shame even to hear the words of a flatterer, how much more to meet him in person! And how could he remain here?"*
Zilu went to look, but the house was empty.

The warden of Changwu asked Zilao: *"In governing, do not be reckless; in ordering the people, do not be careless. In the past, when I planted grain, if I plowed recklessly, the harvest repaid me in kind; if I weeded carelessly, the harvest repaid me in kind. The next year, I changed my ways, deepened the plowing, and carefully covered the seeds—the grain grew lush and abundant, and I had my fill for the whole year."*
When Zhuangzi heard of this, he said: *"Nowadays, those who cultivate their bodies and order their minds often resemble what the warden describes. They flee from their Heaven, depart from their nature, diminish their emotions, and lose their spirit, all to follow the crowd. Thus, those who recklessly harm their nature: the sprouts of desire and aversion become their nature. Like reeds and rushes, they first support our form, then soon strangle us. They burst forth in sores and ulcers, erupting without choice, festering as boils, scabs, and abscesses—internal heat and oozing fat are the result."*

Boju studied under Lao Dan and said, "I request to wander the world."
Lao Dan replied, "Enough! The world is everywhere the same."
Boju asked again, and Lao Dan said, "Where will you begin?"
He replied, "I will begin in Qi."

Arriving in Qi, he saw a man who had been executed. He pushed forward, straightened the body, removed his court robes to cover it, wailed to Heaven, and wept, saying: "You! You! The world suffers great calamity—why must you alone be the first to meet it? They say, *'Do not steal! Do not kill!'* Yet once honor and disgrace are established, one sees what brings suffering; once wealth and property are amassed, one sees what sparks strife. Now, to establish what brings people suffering, to amass what sparks their strife, to exhaust their bodies without respite—how could one hope to avoid reaching this point?

In ancient times, those who ruled over others took success as belonging to the people and failure as their own; they took uprightness as belonging to the people and crookedness as their own. Thus, if even one person lost their proper form, they would withdraw and blame themselves. Now, it is not so: they conceal their deeds, feigning ignorance of the people’s folly; they impose great difficulties yet punish those who dare not comply; they heap heavy burdens yet penalize those who cannot bear them; they lengthen the path yet execute those who do not reach the end. When the people’s strength is exhausted, they resort to deception to sustain it. With falsehoods multiplying daily, how can scholars and commoners not also resort to falsehood?

When strength is insufficient, one resorts to pretense; when wisdom is insufficient, one resorts to deceit; when wealth is insufficient, one resorts to... Who can be held accountable for the deeds of theft and banditry?"

Qū Bóyù reached sixty years of age and transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he deemed right at the time, only to end by rejecting it as wrong. How could one know that what is deemed right today is not the wrong of fifty-nine years past? All things have life, yet none know their root; all emerge, yet none see their gate. People all honor the knowledge of what they know, yet none know to rely on the knowledge of what they do not know before attaining true knowledge—can this not be called great delusion? Enough! Enough! There is no escape from this. Is this what is meant by "so it is" and "is it so"?

Confucius asked the Grand Historian Dàtāo, Bó Chángqiān, and Xī Wéi: "Duke Líng of Wèi indulged in wine and revelry, neglecting the governance of his state; he hunted and shot without responding to the affairs of the feudal lords. How then was he called Líng?" Dàtāo said: "It was because of this." Bó Chángqiān said: "Duke Líng had three wives, with whom he bathed promiscuously. Yet when Historian Qiū presented himself in attendance, bearing the ceremonial silk, Duke Líng supported him with reverence. Though his arrogance was so extreme, his respect for the worthy was so solemn—this is why he was called Líng." Xī Wéi said: "When Duke Líng died, divination for burial at the ancestral tomb was auspicious, and divination for burial at Shāqiū was also auspicious. Digging several fathoms deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing it and examining it, they saw an inscription that read: *'Not relying on his son, Duke Líng seized and buried it here.'* Duke Líng’s numinousness had long been so! What could those two understand of it?"

Little Knowledge asked Great Master Tiáo: "What is meant by 'village words'?" Great Master Tiáo said: "A village combines ten surnames to form its customs, unites differences into sameness, and disperses sameness into differences. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse and cannot obtain the horse, yet the horse stands before you, it is because you call the hundred parts a horse. Thus, hills accumulate the lowly to become high; rivers combine waters to become great; the great man unites all to become impartial. What enters from without has a master but is not grasped; what issues from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct qi, yet Heaven does not bestow favor, and so the year is completed; offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not show partiality, and so the state is well-governed; the civil and martial virtues of the great man are not bestowed, and so his power is complete; the myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not show partiality, and so it is nameless. Nameless, it is non-action; through non-action, there is nothing it does not do. Time has endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow ceaselessly, sometimes thwarting what should be fitting, sometimes following different paths; what is corrected may still err. Compared to a great marsh, all materials find their measure; observed in a great mountain, trees and stones share the same ground. This is what is meant by 'village words.'" Little Knowledge said: "Then can this be called the Dao?" Great Master Tiáo said: "No. The number of things is not limited to ten thousand, yet we call them 'the ten thousand things' because we name and refer to them by their multitude. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yin and yang are the greatest of qi; the Dao is their impartiality. To name and refer to it by its greatness is permissible, but to claim you have grasped it—how could you compare to it? If you argue thus, it would be like comparing dogs and horses—far from sufficient."

Little Knowledge said: "Within the four seas, within the six directions, where do the myriad things arise?" Great Master Tiáo said: "Yin and yang illuminate and cover each other, govern and regulate each other; the four seasons succeed one another, give birth to and destroy each other. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches arise from this; the union of male and female becomes customary through this. Safety and danger alternate; fortune and misfortune give birth to each other; urgency and leisure rub against each other; gathering and scattering complete each other. These are the names and realities that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted. Following the order of succession, the mutual employment of bridging movements, exhaustion returns to beginning, end returns to start—this is what things inherently possess. What words can exhaust, what knowledge can reach, is merely the limits of things. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow its decay, do not trace its origin—this is where discussion stops."

Little Knowledge said: "Jì Zhēn’s 'non-action' and Jiēzǐ’s 'or causation'—which of these two doctrines accords with reality, which pervades principle?" Great Master Tiáo said: "The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs are what people know; yet even the greatest wisdom cannot describe in words their spontaneous transformations, nor anticipate in thought what they will do. Analyzing this, the essence reaches the unparalleled, the greatness reaches the unbounded."

"‘Or causation’ and ‘non-action’—both avoid entanglement with things yet are ultimately deemed erroneous. ‘Or causation’ is substantive, ‘non-action’ is vacuous. Having name and reality is where things reside; lacking name and reality lies in the void of things. What can be spoken or conceived only grows more so with words. The unborn cannot be shunned, death cannot be prevented. Life and death are not distant, yet their principle cannot be perceived. ‘Or causation’ and ‘non-action’—these are but borrowed terms for doubt.

I observe their root: its going is without end. I seek their end: its coming is without cease. Without end, without cease—words fail here, yet this is the same principle as things. ‘Or causation’ and ‘non-action’ are the root of this. They accompany things from beginning to end.

The Dao cannot be possessed, possession cannot be devoid of it. The Dao as a name is but a borrowed means to proceed. ‘Or causation’ and ‘non-action’ are but one corner of things—how could they suffice for the great square?

If words were sufficient, then speaking all day would exhaust the Dao. If words were insufficient, then speaking all day would only speak of things. The ultimate of Dao and things cannot be borne by speech or silence. Neither speech nor silence—discussion reaches its limit here."

External things cannot be relied upon—thus Longfeng was executed, Bigan was slain, Jizi feigned madness, Elai met his death, and Jie and Zhou perished. A ruler does not desire his ministers’ loyalty, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust; thus Wu Yun was cast into the river, Chang Hong died in Shu, and his blood, stored for three years, turned to jade-green. A parent does not desire a child’s filial piety, yet filial piety does not necessarily bring love; thus Xiaoji grieved and Zeng Shen mourned.

When wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal is held to fire, it melts. When yin and yang clash in their courses, heaven and earth are thrown into great turmoil—then thunder and lightning arise, fire appears in water, and even the great locust tree is consumed. There is such sorrow when one is trapped between two perils with no escape.

The mantis cannot complete its strike, the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, comfort and distress intermingle, profit and harm grind against each other, and the fire of life burns fiercely. The multitude scorches harmony, and the moon is no match for fire—thus the Way is exhausted and collapses.

Zhuang Zhou was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The marquis said, “Very well. When I receive the tax silver from my fief, I will lend you a hundred gold pieces—will that do?” Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and said, “Yesterday, as I came, I heard a voice calling from the middle of the road. I looked and saw a crucian carp in the rut of a cart wheel. I asked it, ‘Crucian carp! What are you doing here?’ It replied, ‘I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Could you spare a dipper or two of water to keep me alive?’ I said, ‘Very well. I am about to travel south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue, and I will divert the waters of the Western River to bring you home—will that do?’ The crucian carp flushed with anger and said, ‘I have lost my usual element, I have nowhere to go. I could be kept alive with a dipper or two of water. Yet you speak like this—you might as well have looked for me sooner in a dried-fish shop!’”

Lord Ren made a great hook with a thick black line, baited it with fifty steers, crouched on Mount Kuaiji, and cast his rod into the Eastern Sea. He fished day after day for a year without catching anything. Then a great fish took the bait, dragged the hook down, and plunged into the depths, thrashing its fins and churning white waves like mountains. The sea trembled, its roar matching the gods, and its dreadful power spread for a thousand miles. Lord Ren caught the fish, butchered it, and dried it. From the east of the Yellow River to the north of Cangwu, there was no one who did not feast on it.

Yet later, the petty and clever talkers all marveled and spread the tale. Those who raise a flimsy rod, rush to irrigation ditches, and watch for minnows and crucian carp—how could they ever catch a great fish? Those who embellish trivial words to seek high office—how far are they from great understanding? Thus, those who have never heard of the customs of the Ren clan are far indeed from being able to navigate the world.

Confucians use the *Odes* and *Rites* to rob graves. A great Confucian intoned, “The east is stirring—how goes the affair?” A lesser Confucian replied, “The skirt and jacket are not yet removed, but there is a pearl in the mouth.” The *Odes* indeed say: *“The green-green wheat grows on the hillside. If one does not give in life, why hold a pearl in death?”* They seized the hair, pressed the chin, and with a metal mallet, struck the jaw to pry open the cheeks—all without harming the pearl in the mouth!

A disciple of Lao Laizi was gathering firewood when he encountered Confucius. He returned and reported, “There is someone over there—tall above, hastening below, with ears set back, gazing as if surveying the four seas. I do not know whose son he is.” Lao Laizi said, “That is Qiu. Summon him.” Confucius arrived, and Lao Laizi said, “Qiu, rid yourself of your bodily pride and your cultivated knowledge—then you may become a gentleman.” Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression troubled. He asked, “May I advance in my work?” Lao Laizi said, “To be unable to bear the harm of one age and yet rush headlong into the calamities of ten thousand ages—is this not stubborn and narrow? Or is it that your plans fall short? Kindness that takes delight in recklessness is a lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus, drawing one another by reputation, binding one another with... Better to forget both Yao’s praise and Jie’s blame, and close off the very source of praise. To turn back is not to be free of harm; to act is not to be free of error. The sage hesitates to initiate affairs, yet each one succeeds. Why then do you persist in bearing your pride to the end?”

*(End of Scroll 9, Part 26: External Things)*

Duke Yuan of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate. The man said, “I come from the abyss of Zailu. I was sent by the Clear River as an emissary to the River Lord, but the fisherman Yu Ju caught me.” The Duke awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said, “This is a spirit turtle.” The Duke asked, “Is there a fisherman named Yu Ju?” His attendants replied, “There is.” The Duke said, “Summon Yu Ju to court.”

The next day, Yu Ju appeared. The Duke asked, “What did you catch?” Yu Ju answered, “I cast my net and caught a white turtle, five feet in circumference.” The Duke said, “Present your turtle.” When the turtle arrived, the Duke wavered—once wanting to kill it, once wanting to spare it. His mind unsettled, he consulted the oracle, which said, “Killing the turtle for divination will bring good fortune.” So they carved the turtle open, and in seventy-two drillings, not a single prediction failed.

Confucius said, “The spirit turtle could appear in the Duke’s dream yet could not escape Yu Ju’s net. It could foresee seventy-two divinations without error yet could not avoid the calamity of having its entrails carved out. Thus, even knowledge has its limitations, and even the divine has its shortcomings. Though one may possess supreme wisdom, ten thousand schemes are needed. Fish do not fear nets but fear pelicans. Discard petty knowledge, and great knowledge becomes clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness arises of itself. An infant, born without a teacher of stone, learns to speak by dwelling among those who can.”

Huizi said to Zhuangzi, “Your words are useless.” Zhuangzi replied, “Only when one understands uselessness can we speak of use. The heavens are neither narrow nor small, yet what man uses is no more than the space his feet occupy. If one were to dig beneath his feet to the Yellow Springs, would there still be use?” Huizi said, “No.” Zhuangzi said, “Then the usefulness of the useless is also clear.”

Zhuangzi said, “If a man has the ability to wander freely, can he choose not to? If a man lacks the ability, can he wander at all? To drift and flee, to cut off all ties—alas, is this not beyond the capacity of even the wisest and most virtuous? To fall and not turn back, to rush like fire and not look back—though they may be ruler and minister for a time, their relationship is transient, shifting without mutual contempt. Thus it is said: the perfected person does not linger in his actions. Those who exalt the past and belittle the present follow the current of scholars. Yet if we observe the present age through the lens of the age of the Divine Farmer, who can avoid being swept along? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without bias, following others without losing himself. Their teaching and learning do not impose upon one another.

Eyes that penetrate see clearly; ears that penetrate hear keenly; noses that penetrate smell acutely; mouths that penetrate taste sweetness; minds that penetrate know; knowledge that penetrates becomes virtue. The Dao does not wish to be obstructed—obstruction leads to choking, and if choking persists, it becomes stumbling, from which a multitude of harms arise. Beings with knowledge rely on breath; if it does not flow smoothly, it is not heaven’s fault. Heaven pierces them day and night without ceasing, yet man clogs his own apertures.

The womb has its layered chambers; the mind has its heavenly wanderings. If the room is never empty, mother and daughter-in-law will quarrel; if the mind has no heavenly wandering, the six senses will jostle one another. The great forests and mountains are good for man, yet even the spiritually endowed cannot fully master them.

Virtue overflows into fame, fame overflows into violence, schemes stagnate in cunning, knowledge emerges from strife, barriers arise from clinging to office, and affairs are settled by what suits the crowd. When spring rains fall in season, grasses and trees flourish, and the hoe and plow begin their work. Yet more than half of the plants grow upside down, unaware of their own inversion.

Stillness and silence can heal illness; rubbing the corners of the eyes can rejuvenate the old; tranquility can halt haste. Yet even so, those who toil never inquire of those at leisure. The sage’s way of startling the world is something the spiritually realized never inquire about; the worthy’s way of startling the age is something the sage never inquires about; the noble’s way of startling the state is something the worthy never inquire about; the petty man’s way of conforming to the times is something the noble never inquires about.

In Yanmen, there was a man whose parent died. Because he mourned so well, he was appointed an official tutor. Half of his fellow villagers followed his example and mourned themselves to death. Yao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You fled; Tang offered it to Wu Guang, but Wu Guang grew angry; Ji Ta heard of this and led his disciples to crouch by the Kuang River, awaiting condolences. Three years later, Shentu Di drowned himself in the Yellow River.

The fish trap exists for the sake of catching fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The rabbit snare exists for the sake of catching rabbits; once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for the sake of meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?”

Nineteen in ten of words are parables; seventeen in ten are reiterations; goblet words emerge daily, harmonized by the Heavenly Equilibrium.

Nineteen in ten of words are parables, relying on external voices to expound. A loving father does not act as matchmaker for his son. If a father praises his own son, it is not as credible as if a non-father did so. This is no fault of his own—it is the fault of others. When others align with oneself, one responds; when they do not align, one resists. What aligns with oneself is deemed right; what differs is deemed wrong.

Seventeen in ten are reiterations, used to affirm one’s own words. These are the words of elders, those whose years precede ours. Yet if they lack the warp and weft of fundamental principles to guide those who follow, they are in error. A person who cannot surpass others lacks the human Way; one who lacks the human Way is called a withered remnant.

Goblet words emerge daily, harmonized by the Heavenly Equilibrium, flowing and unfolding to exhaust the years. Without words, all is equal; equality with words is not equality, and words with equality are not equality. Thus it is said: "Nothing." Words without words—throughout a lifetime, one speaks, yet never truly speaks; throughout a lifetime, one does not speak, yet never truly ceases to speak. There is that by which something is permissible, and that by which it is not; there is that by which something is so, and that by which it is not so.

Whence comes "so"? It is so in being so. Whence comes "not so"? It is not so in being not so. Whence comes "permissible"? It is permissible in being permissible. Whence comes "impermissible"? It is impermissible in being impermissible. Things inherently have that by which they are so; things inherently have that by which they are permissible. Yet there is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not permissible.

Without goblet words emerging daily, harmonized by the Heavenly Equilibrium, who could endure for long? All things are seeds, succeeding one another through differing forms, beginning and end like a ring, attaining their proper order—this is called the Heavenly Equilibrium. The Heavenly Equilibrium is the Heavenly Equilibrium.

Zhuangzi said to Huizi: "Confucius lived sixty years, and in sixty years he transformed. What he initially affirmed, he ultimately negated. Who knows whether what he called 'right' at sixty was not the 'wrong' of fifty-nine?" Huizi replied: "Confucius diligently applied his will and employed his knowledge." Zhuangzi said: "Confucius has renounced such things; he never spoke of them. Confucius said: 'One receives one’s endowment from the great root and restores the numinous to life. To sing in accord with the pitch-pipes, to speak in accord with the laws—profit and righteousness arrayed before one, yet likes and dislikes, right and wrong merely subdue men’s mouths. To make men submit with their hearts and not dare to resist, to establish the settled order of all under Heaven—ah! Alas! I shall never attain his level!'"

Master Zeng took office twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: "When I first served while my parents were alive, a stipend of three *fu* brought joy to my heart; later, when I served after their passing, three thousand *zhong* could not reach them, and my heart grieved." A disciple asked Confucius: "Can one say that Shen here is free of blame?" Confucius replied: "He is already blameworthy! How could one free of blame feel such sorrow? To him, three *fu* or three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows, mosquitoes, or gadflies pass before him."

Yan Chengzi You said to Dongguo Ziqi: "Since I heard your words, in one year I became rustic; in two, I followed; in three, I penetrated; in four, I became one with things; in five, they came to me; in six, spirits entered; in seven, Heaven was accomplished; in eight, I knew neither death nor life; in nine, I attained the great mystery. Life is active; death is loss. You hold that death has its source, while life—yang as it is—has none. Is this truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go? Heaven has its celestial reckoning, earth has its human foundations—where should I seek them? If none knows its end, how can one say there is no fate? If none knows its beginning, how can one say there is fate? When there is resonance, how can one say there are no spirits? When there is no resonance, how can one say there are spirits?"

The shadowy wraiths asked the shadow: "Earlier you bowed your head, now you raise it; earlier your hair was bound, now it is loose; earlier you sat, now you stand; earlier you walked, now you halt—why?" The shadow replied: "Such trifling matters—why ask at all? I act, yet know not why. I am like the cicada’s molted husk, the snake’s sloughed skin—resembling them yet not them. Fire and sunlight are my gathering; darkness and night are my succession. Do I depend on these? How much more so those who depend on what depends! When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it; when it is strong and yang, I am strong and yang with it. What question is there in strong yang?"

Yang Ziju journeyed south to Pei, while Lao Dan traveled west to Qin. They met on the outskirts of Liang, where Laozi sighed to the sky mid-journey: "At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot." Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he presented water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: "Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you a question, but you were too occupied to pause—so I dared not. Now, may I inquire the reason?" Laozi said: "Your haughty gaze, your overbearing mien—who would dwell with you? The purest white seems tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient." Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: "I humbly receive your instruction."

When he had first arrived, the innkeeper had welcomed him with deference, the master of the house had laid out his mat, the wife had held his towel, the guests had yielded their seats, and those tending the stove had stepped aside. Upon his return, the innkeeper contended with him for his seat.

Chapter Twenty-Eight: Yielding the Throne

Yao offered the empire to Xu You, who declined. He then offered it to Zizhou Zhipu, who said: "If you deem me fit, it would be acceptable. Yet I happen to suffer from a deep melancholy, and am just now treating it—I have no leisure to govern the empire." The empire is the weightiest of burdens, yet he would not let it harm his life—how much less other things! Only one who takes no account of the empire can be entrusted with it.

Shun offered the empire to Zizhou Bo, who said: "I happen to suffer from a deep melancholy, and am just now treating it—I have no leisure for the empire." Thus the empire is a great vessel, yet one does not exchange life for it. This is how those who possess the Way differ from the common.

Shun offered the empire to Shan Juan, who said: "I stand amid the cosmos: in winter I wear furs, in summer I wear hemp; in spring I plow and sow, and my strength suffices for labor; in autumn I reap and gather, and my body suffices for rest and sustenance."

With the sun’s rising, I rise to work; with the sun’s setting, I rest—roaming free between heaven and earth, my heart content. Why should I take the empire for myself? Alas, how little you understand me!

Thus he refused it. Then he departed and entered the deep mountains, where he dwelled.

Shun offered the empire to his friend, the farmer of Stone Gate. The farmer of Stone Gate said: “How toilsome is the lord’s conduct! He exhausts his strength in service.” He deemed Shun’s virtue not yet perfected. Thereupon, he shouldered his goods, his wife carried their belongings on her head, and they led their child into the sea, never to return.

King Tai of Danfu dwelled in Bin. The Di tribes attacked him. He offered them furs and silks, but they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, but they refused; he offered them pearls and jades, but they refused. What the Di sought was land. King Tai of Danfu said: “To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—I cannot bear it. Go, all of you, and dwell as you will! What difference is there between serving me and serving the Di? Moreover, I have heard that one must not harm what nourishes for the sake of nourishment.” Thereupon, he took up his staff and departed. The people followed him in a continuous stream, and he established a state beneath Mount Qi.

King Tai of Danfu was one who honored life. Those who honor life, though noble and wealthy, do not let nourishment harm the body; though poor and lowly, do not let profit burden the form. Nowadays, those who occupy high office all fear losing it. Seeing profit, they lightly cast aside their lives—how deluded they are!

The people of Yue murdered their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, distressed by this, fled into the cinnabar caves. When Yue was left without a ruler, they sought Prince Sou, following him to the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people of Yue smoked him out with mugwort. They bore him away in the royal carriage. Prince Sou grasped the reins and mounted the chariot, gazing up to heaven and crying: “Lordship! Lordship! Can you not spare me this?” Prince Sou did not hate being lord; he hated the calamity of being lord. Such was Prince Sou—one who would not let the state harm his life. This was precisely what the people of Yue desired in a lord.

Han and Wei contended over encroached land. Master Hua Zi visited Marquis Zhao of Han, who wore a troubled expression. Master Hua Zi said: “Suppose the world inscribed a pledge before you, saying: ‘If you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be lost; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be lost. Yet whoever seizes it will gain the world.’ Would you seize it?” Marquis Zhao said: “I would not.” Master Hua Zi said: “Excellent! From this we see that your two arms are weightier than the world, and your body is weightier than your two arms. Han’s standing in the world is far lighter than this, and what you now contend over is even lighter still. Yet you grieve and harm your life over what you cannot obtain!” Marquis Zhao said: “Well said! Many have instructed me, but never have I heard this.” Master Hua Zi had made him understand the weight of things.

The Lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Way, and sent an envoy bearing gifts to precede him. Yan He dwelled in a humble lane, wearing coarse hempen clothes and herding oxen himself. When the Lord of Lu’s envoy arrived, Yan He received him in person. The envoy said: “Is this Yan He’s home?” Yan He replied: “This is He’s home.” The envoy presented the gifts, but Yan He said: “I fear a misunderstanding may bring blame upon the envoy—it would be better to verify.” The envoy returned to confirm, then came back to seek him, but Yan He could no longer be found.

Thus, one like Yan He truly despised wealth and honor. Therefore it is said: The true essence of the Way is for governing the self; its remnants may be used for the state; its dregs for governing the world. From this we see that the achievements of kings are but the leavings of sages, not what perfects the self or nourishes life. Yet today’s worldly gentlemen often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue things—how lamentable!

Whenever sages act, they must examine their motives and their aims. Suppose there were a man here who, to shoot a bird a thousand yards away, used the Pearl of Marquis Sui—all would surely laugh at him. Why? Because what he valued was heavy, and what he sought was light. Life—is it not far weightier than the Pearl of Marquis Sui?

Master Lie was poor, and his countenance bore the hue of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Zi Yang of Zheng, saying: “Lie Yukou is a scholar of the Way, yet he dwells in this state in poverty. Does my lord not love scholars?” Zi Yang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send him grain. When Master Lie saw the envoy, he bowed twice and declined. The envoy departed, and Master Lie entered his home. His wife, striking her breast, said: “I have heard that the wife of one who possesses the Way lives in ease and joy. Yet you bear the hue of hunger. The lord sent you food, but you refused it—is this not fate?” Master Lie laughed and said to her: “The lord does not know me. He sent me grain on another’s word, and if he were to punish me, it would also be on another’s word. This is why I did not accept.” Later, the people indeed rebelled and killed Zi Yang.

King Zhao of Chu lost his state, and the butcher Yue followed him in exile. When King Zhao returned to his state, he wished to reward those who had followed him, including the butcher Yue. Yue said: “When the great king lost his state, I lost my butchery; when the great king returned, I returned to my butchery. My rank and emolument are restored—what reward is there?” The king said: “Insist!” The butcher Yue said: “When the great king lost his state, it was not my fault, so I dared not accept punishment; when the great king returned, it was not my merit, so I dared not claim reward.” The king said: “Let me see him.”

The butcher Yue said: “According to the laws of Chu, only those with great merit may be granted an audience. Now, my wisdom was not sufficient to preserve the state, nor was my courage sufficient to die resisting the enemy. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled from danger and did not follow the great king by design. If the great king now wishes to set aside the law and violate precedent to receive me, this is not what I wish to be heard throughout the world.” The king said to Marshal Zi Qi: “Though the butcher Yue’s station is lowly, his principles are lofty. Zi Qi, offer him a position with the three standards of rank.” The butcher Yue said: “The position with three standards—I know it is nobler than my butcher’s stall; the salary of ten thousand bushels—I know it is richer than my butcher’s profit. Yet how could I covet rank and emolument and thereby cause my lord to gain a reputation for reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.” Thus he declined.

Yuan Xian lived in Lu in a walled hut with a roof of thatch; the gate was made of tangled brambles, incomplete; the door pivot was of mulberry wood; two earthen jars served as windows, sealed with reeds. Above, the roof leaked; below, the floor was damp. Yet he sat upright and played the zither. Zigong arrived in a grand carriage, his inner robe dark blue and his outer robe white, the axle of his high chariot too wide to pass through the lane. He went to see Yuan Xian. Yuan Xian, wearing a hat of woven rushes and shoes with untied laces, leaned on a staff of bramble and answered the door. Zigong said: “Alas! Master, what afflicts you?” Yuan Xian replied: “I have heard that to be poor without complaint is not poverty, but to study without putting it into practice is affliction. Now I am poor, not afflicted.” Zigong retreated, his face flushed with shame. Yuan Xian said: “To act for the sake of fame, to befriend for the sake of cliques, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to conceal one’s virtue with benevolence and righteousness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.”

Zengzi lived in Wei, his padded robe unlined, his complexion swollen and sallow, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not light a fire, for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he put on his cap, the ties snapped; when he grasped his lapel, his elbows showed; when he pulled on his shoes, the heels split. Yet he dragged his hem and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth, resonant as metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject, nor could the feudal lords make him a friend. Thus, those who cultivate the will forget the body; those who cultivate the body forget profit; those who attain the Dao forget the mind.

Confucius said to Yan Hui: “Hui, come! Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not enter official service?” Yan Hui replied: “I do not wish to serve. Outside the outer wall, I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge; within the outer wall, I have ten *mu* of fields, enough to provide silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough to amuse myself; what I have learned of the Master’s Dao is enough to bring me joy.”

"Hui does not wish to serve in office." Confucius’s expression turned solemn, and he said: "Excellent, Hui’s resolve! I have heard it said: ‘Those who know contentment are not burdened by profit; those who are secure in self-possession do not fear loss; those who cultivate inner refinement feel no shame in low station.’ I have recited these words for a long time, but only now, through Hui, do I truly see them—this is my own gain."

Prince Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi: "Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart remains beneath the palace gates—what is to be done?" Zhanzi replied: "Value life. Value life, and profit becomes light." Prince Mou said: "Though I understand this, I cannot overcome myself." Zhanzi said: "If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your inclination—what harm is there to the spirit? But if you cannot overcome yourself yet force yourself not to follow, this is called double injury. Those who suffer double injury have no place among the long-lived."

Prince Mou, a prince of ten thousand chariots, found it harder to retreat into mountain caves than a commoner—though he had not yet attained the Dao, his intent was commendable.

Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food, subsisting on a thin soup of wild greens without grain. His complexion was gaunt, yet he still plucked the zither and sang in his chamber. While picking vegetables, Zilu and Zigong said to each other: "Our Master was twice driven from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Cai. Those who would kill him incur no guilt; those who would trample him face no prohibition. Yet he still strums the zither and sings, never ceasing his music—can a noble person be so shameless?"

Yan Hui had no reply. He went inside and told Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and sighed deeply, saying: "You and Ci are petty men. Come here, and I will speak to you." Zilu and Zigong entered.

Zilu said: "In such circumstances, one may truly be called destitute!"
Confucius replied: "What words are these! The noble person who is at one with the Dao is called 'at one'; the one who is cut off from the Dao is called 'destitute.' Now I, Qiu, embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness yet encounter the calamities of a disordered age—how can I be called destitute? Inwardly examining myself, I am not cut off from the Dao; facing adversity, I do not lose my virtue. When the cold arrives and frost and snow descend, only then do I know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Cai—are they not my good fortune?"

Confucius then struck the zither with a clear sound and resumed his singing. Zilu, grasping his robe, danced with vigor. Zigong said: "I did not know the height of heaven or the depth of earth."

The ancients who attained the Dao found joy in adversity and joy in success—their joy was not in adversity or success. When virtue and power reside within, then adversity and success become as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain.

Thus, Xu You delighted in Yingyang, and Gong Bo found contentment on Gongshou. Shun offered the world to his friend Beiren Wuze, who said: "How strange is this ruler’s conduct! Dwelling in the furrows of the fields, yet wandering at Yao’s gate! Not content with this alone, he now seeks to defile me with his shameful conduct—I am ashamed to see him." Thereupon he cast himself into the Clear and Cold Abyss.

When Tang was about to attack Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said: "This is not my affair." Tang asked: "Who then is suitable?" Bian Sui replied: "I do not know." Tang then consulted Mao Guang, who said: "This is not my affair." Tang asked: "Who then is suitable?" Mao Guang replied: "I know." Tang said: "What of Yi Yin?" Mao Guang answered: "He is strong and enduring, patient of disgrace—I know nothing else of him." Thereupon Tang conspired with Yi Yin to attack Jie, defeated him, and offered the throne to Bian Sui. Bian Sui declined, saying: "When the ruler plotted against Jie, he consulted me—he must have thought me a villain. Now that he has defeated Jie and offers me the throne, he must think me greedy. I was born in a disordered age, and this man without the Dao twice seeks to defile me with his conduct—I cannot bear to hear of it again!" He then cast himself into the Zhou River and died.

Tang then offered the throne to Mao Guang, saying: "The wise plan, the martial execute, the benevolent rule—this is the ancient Way. Why do you not ascend?" Mao Guang declined, saying: "To depose a ruler is not righteous; to rule the people is not benevolent; others face danger while I enjoy the benefits—this is not integrity. I have heard it said: 'One who does not act righteously does not accept its emoluments; in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its soil.' How much less should I accept such honor! I cannot bear to see this any longer."

He then strapped a stone to his back and drowned himself in the Lu River.

In the rise of the Zhou, there were two scholars dwelling in Guzhu, named Boyi and Shuqi. The two conferred, saying: "We have heard that in the west there is a man who seems to follow the Dao—let us go and observe him." Arriving at Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them. He made a covenant with them, saying: "I will grant you wealth two ranks higher and appoint you to an official post of the first order." They slaughtered an animal and buried it as an oath. The two looked at each other and laughed, saying: "Alas, how strange! This is not what we call the Dao. In the days when Shennong ruled the world, sacrifices were made with utmost reverence, yet no blessings were sought. In his dealings with others, loyalty and trust governed all, with no demands made. He delighted in governance and took joy in bringing order. He did not build himself up by others’ ruin, exalt himself by others’ lowliness, or profit from the times. Now the Zhou, seeing the disorder of the Yin, hastily seizes power. They scheme above and bribe below, rely on arms to maintain authority, and slaughter animals to swear oaths as a pledge of trust. They go about persuading the masses and resort to killing and warfare to seize advantage. This is but replacing one chaos with another. We have heard that the scholars of old, when encountering an age of order, did not shirk their duty, and when facing an age of disorder, did not cling to mere survival. Today the world is benighted, the virtue of the Zhou has declined—if we were to align ourselves with the Zhou, it would only sully our conduct. Better to avoid them and keep our ways pure." They then went north to Mount Shouyang and starved to death there.

As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and rank, if they could have done without, they would never have relied upon them. Their lofty integrity and unyielding conduct brought them joy in their own resolve, and they would not serve the world. Such was the integrity of these two scholars.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Robber Zhi (Part Nine, Lower Scroll)**

Confucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji’s younger brother was named Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi led a band of nine thousand followers, rampaging across the world and violently oppressing the feudal lords. They broke into homes, drove off people’s cattle and horses, and seized their wives and daughters. Greed made them forget their kin; they paid no heed to parents or brothers and did not sacrifice to their ancestors. Wherever they passed, great states fortified their cities, small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the common people suffered bitterly.

Confucius said to Liuxia Ji: "A father must be able to instruct his son, and an elder brother must be able to teach his younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or a brother cannot teach his brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now you, sir, are a man of talent in this age, yet your brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge to the world, and you cannot correct him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Let me go and persuade him on your behalf."

Liuxia Ji replied: "You say that a father must be able to instruct his son, and an elder brother must be able to teach his brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, even with your eloquence, what can you do? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind is like a gushing spring, his thoughts like a whirlwind. His strength is enough to resist enemies, and his eloquence is enough to gloss over wrongs. He is pleased when things go his way and enraged when they do not. He is quick to insult others with words. You must not go."

Confucius did not listen. Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong rode on the right as they went to see Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was just then resting his troops on the sunny side of a great mountain, eating a meal of minced human liver. Confucius stepped down from the carriage and approached, saying to the herald: "I am Kong Qiu. Hearing of the general’s lofty integrity, I respectfully bow twice to the herald." The herald went in to announce him.

When Robber Zhi heard this, he flew into a great rage. His eyes blazed like stars, and his hair stood on end beneath his cap. He said: "Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kong Qiu from Lu? Tell him this: 'You fabricate words and invent phrases, falsely invoking the names of the former kings. You wear a cap of twigs and a belt of dead oxhide, spouting a torrent of twisted arguments. You do not plow yet eat, do not weave yet wear fine clothes. You flap your lips and wag your tongue, creating false distinctions to delude the rulers of the world, leading the scholars astray so they do not return to their roots. You preach false filial piety and brotherly duty, all to angle for enfeoffment and wealth. Your crimes are grave and weighty—flee at once! If not, I will add your liver to my midday meal.'"

Confucius again sent word, saying: "I, Qiu, have found favor with the Ji family and wish only to gaze upon your tent-flap." The attendant relayed this message. Robber Zhi said: "Bring him forward!" Confucius hastened in, stepped back from his mat, and bowed twice to Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi flew into a great rage, stretching out his legs, pressing his sword, glaring fiercely, and roaring like a nursing tiger: "Qiu, come forward! If your words align with my will, you shall live; if they oppose my heart, you shall die."

Confucius said: "I, Qiu, have heard that under Heaven there are three virtues: to be born and grow tall, surpassingly beautiful and peerless, so that young and old, noble and base all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue; to comprehend the bounds of Heaven and Earth and to discern all things—this is the middle virtue; to be brave, fierce, resolute, and daring, gathering multitudes and leading troops—this is the lowest virtue. Any man possessing even one of these virtues is worthy to face the world and call himself solitary. Now, General, you combine all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiate light, your lips are like gleaming cinnabar, your teeth like aligned cowries, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell, yet you are called Robber Zhi. I, Qiu, secretly feel shame on your behalf for not claiming what is rightfully yours.

If you are inclined to heed your servant, I shall go south to Wu and Yue, making them submit to Lu; east to Song and Wei; west to Jin and Chu, and have them build for you a great city of several hundred *li*, establish a metropolis of hundreds of thousands of households, and honor you as a feudal lord. Together with the world, you may begin anew, disband your troops, rest your soldiers, gather and nurture your brothers, and jointly sacrifice to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, the very wish of all under Heaven."

Robber Zhi flew into a rage, shouting: "Come forward, Qiu! Those who can be swayed by profit or admonished by words are but fools and the common rabble. My great beauty—men see it and delight in it—is the legacy of my parents' virtue. Even if you do not praise me, do I not know myself? Moreover, I have seen how those who flatter to one's face also slander behind one's back. Now you tell me of great cities and teeming multitudes—this is to lure me with profit and treat me as a herdsman tends his flock. Can such a thing endure?

Of all great cities, none surpasses the world itself. Yao and Shun possessed the world, yet their descendants had not even a place to drive a nail. Tang and Wu became Son of Heaven, yet their lineages perished—was this not because the profit was too great?

I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and men few, so people dwelt in nests to avoid them. By day they gathered acorns, by night they roosted in trees, and so they were called 'the people of the Nest Builder.' Later, people learned to make clothing, piling firewood in summer and warming themselves in winter, and so they were called 'the people who knew how to live.' In the age of Shen Nong, they lay at ease and rose without care. People knew their mothers but not their fathers, living among deer, plowing for food, weaving for clothing, without any thought of harming one another. Such was the height of perfect virtue.

Yet the Yellow Emperor could not preserve this virtue. He fought Chi You on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and appointed ministers; Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu killed Zhou. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many bullied the few. Since the time of Tang and Wu, all have been disturbers of the world.

Now you propagate the Way of Wen and Wu, wielding the world's eloquence to instruct later generations. You dress in fine robes with narrow sashes, speak with affected words and false deeds, to delude the rulers of the world and seek wealth and honor. There is no greater thief than you! Why does the world not call you 'Robber Qiu' instead of calling me 'Robber Zhi'?

You sweet-talked Zilu into following you, making him remove his warrior's cap, set aside his long sword, and receive your teachings. The world says, 'Confucius can stop violence and forbid wrongdoing.' Yet in the end, Zilu tried to kill the lord of Wei and failed, his body pickled and displayed above the eastern gate of Wei—this was the result of your inadequate teaching.

Do you still call yourself a man of talent and a sage? You were twice exiled from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and found no refuge under heaven. You taught Zilu to meet such a fate, unable to secure even your own safety, let alone that of others. Is your Way truly worthy of esteem?

Of all those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor, yet even he could not preserve his virtue, fighting at Zhuolu until blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unfilial, Shun was undutiful, Yu was crippled, Tang exiled his lord, Wu killed Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six, whom the world reveres—when examined closely, all were deluded by profit, violently distorting their true nature. How shameful!

The world calls Boyi and Shuqi worthy men. They renounced the lordship of Guzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their bones left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the world and died embracing a tree. Shentu Di remonstrated in vain, carried a stone into the river, and was eaten by fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was utterly loyal, cutting flesh from his thigh to feed Duke Wen, yet later the duke betrayed him. Enraged, Zitui left and burned to death in a tree. Weisheng arranged to meet a woman beneath a bridge; when she did not come and the waters rose, he held fast to the pillar and drowned. These six men—no different from dismembered dogs, drowned pigs, or beggars with gourd ladles—all pursued fame and scorned death, heedless of preserving life. Are they not fools?

The world calls Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu loyal ministers. Wu Zixu was drowned in the river, Bigan had his heart cut out—these two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end, they were mocked by all under heaven. From the highest perspective, even they are not worthy of esteem.

As for what you tell me: if you speak of ghostly matters, I cannot know them; if you speak of human affairs, it is nothing beyond what I have already heard. Let me tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see beauty, the ears to hear sound, the mouth to taste flavors, and the will to be fulfilled. The longest-lived reach a hundred years, the average eighty, the shortest sixty. Subtract illness, emaciation, death, mourning, and sorrow, and in a month, one may open one’s mouth to laugh only four or five days at most.

Heaven and earth are without end, but human life has its time. Clutching the tools of existence and entrusting oneself to the boundless, one passes in a flash, no different from a fine steed galloping past a crack in the wall. Those who cannot fulfill their aspirations and nurture their lives are not masters of the Dao.

All your words are what I reject. Begone at once! Do not speak again! Your Way is frantic and grasping, a craft of emptiness and deceit—it cannot preserve the true. What is there to discuss?"

Confucius bowed twice, hurried away, exited the gate, mounted his carriage, and three times lost hold of the reins. His eyes were dazed and sightless, his complexion ashen, and he leaned against the crossbar, unable to catch his breath. Returning to the east gate of Lu, he encountered Liuxia Ji.

Liuxia Ji said: "You have been absent for days. Your carriage and horses show signs of travel—did you by chance go to see Zhi?"

Confucius looked up to the sky and sighed: "Indeed."

Liuxia Ji said: "Did Zhi perhaps offend you as before?"

Confucius said: "Indeed. What I call needlessly cauterizing oneself without illness. Racing to measure the tiger’s head, braiding its whiskers—how nearly did I escape its jaws!"

Zizhang asked Mang Goude: "Why not act? Without action, there is no trust; without trust, no appointment; without appointment, no— Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, righteousness is truly at stake. If one abandons fame and gain, returning to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct cannot but be daily practiced!"

Mang Goude said: "The shameless grow rich; the deceitful gain prominence. The greatest of fame and profit lie in shamelessness and deceit. Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, trust is truly at stake. If one abandons fame and gain, returning to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct embraces their Heavenly nature!"

Confucius said: "In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven, wealthy with all under heaven. Now, if one were to say to Zang Ju, ‘Your conduct is like Jie’s or Zhou’s,’ he would flush with shame and harbor resentment—such is the base man’s contempt. Yet when Confucius and Mo Di, impoverished commoners, are held up to a prime minister, saying, ‘Your conduct is like Confucius’ or Mo Di’s,’ he would alter his expression and protest his inadequacy—such is the scholar’s true nobility. Thus, to hold the power of the Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer nobility; to be a destitute commoner does not necessarily mean baseness. The distinction between noble and base lies in the beauty or ugliness of one’s conduct."

Mang Goude said: "Petty thieves are imprisoned, while great thieves become lords; at the gates of lords, benevolence and righteousness reside. Formerly, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts."

"To condemn in speech yet subordinate in action—this is to have the true nature of words and deeds warring within one’s breast. Is this not perverse? Thus the *Book* says: ‘Who is vile? Who is noble? The successful become the head, the unsuccessful the tail.’"

Zizhang said: "If you do not act accordingly, kinship and affection will lack order, noble and base will lack righteousness, elder and younger will lack sequence. How then can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?"

Mang Goude replied: "Yao executed his eldest son, Shun exiled his younger brother—was there order in kinship and affection? Tang banished Jie, King Wu killed Zhou—was there righteousness in noble and base? Wang Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—was there sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians’ hypocritical words, Mozi’s universal love—how do they distinguish the Five Constants and Six Positions? You correct for the sake of fame, I correct for the sake of profit. The reality of fame and profit neither accords with principle nor reflects the Dao.

Daily you dispute with Wu Yue, saying: ‘The petty man dies for wealth, the gentleman dies for fame—their means of altering their essence and changing their nature differ, yet in abandoning what they do to die for what they do not, they are the same.’ Thus it is said: Do not act as the petty man, and return to Heaven. Do not act as the gentleman, and follow Heaven’s principle. Whether crooked or straight, observe and reach the celestial extreme. Face the four directions, ebb and flow with the times. Whether thus or so, grasp the revolving mechanism. Form your intent alone, and wander with the Dao. Do not act with contrivance, do not establish righteousness through achievement—you will lose what you seek. Do not rush toward wealth, do not sacrifice for success—you will abandon Heaven.

Bi Gan had his heart carved out, Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged out—such were the calamities of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned holding to his word—such were the disasters of trust. Zili was executed, Shenzi did not defend himself—such were the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—such were the failures of righteousness. These are what the ancients transmitted and later ages recount, teaching that the scholar must align his words with his deeds, or else bear the misfortune and suffer the calamity."

Wu Zu asked Zhihe: "There has never been a man who did not pursue fame and seek profit. The wealthy attract followers; followers subordinate themselves, thus honoring them. To see those who subordinate and honor them is the Way to longevity, bodily ease, and joyful contentment. Now you alone have no such intent—is your knowledge insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you reject correctness as delusion?"

Zhihe replied: "Nowadays, those who consider themselves contemporaries and fellow villagers regard those who transcend custom and surpass the world as men without proper standards. They alone lack a guiding principle, yet claim to survey the ages and distinguish right from wrong, conforming to the俗 while abandoning what is most weighty and discarding what is most honorable, all for the sake of their own conduct. How distant they are from the Way of longevity, bodily ease, and joyful contentment!

The pain of illness, the peace of serenity—these are not reflected in the body. The fear of alarm, the joy of delight—these are not reflected in the heart. Knowing what to do yet not knowing why—this is why one may be honored as the Son of Heaven, possess all under Heaven, yet still not escape misfortune."

Wu Zu said: "Wealth is universally advantageous. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power, surpassing what even the perfected cannot attain, the worthy cannot reach. It harnesses others’ courage and strength to make itself mighty, wields others’ wisdom and schemes to make itself discerning, and adopts others’ virtue to make itself excellent. Without ruling a state, it commands reverence like a lord or father.

Moreover, the allure of sounds, colors, flavors, and power—these delight the heart without need of learning, comfort the body without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, approach and avoidance—these do not wait for a teacher, for they are human nature. Though all under Heaven may condemn me, who can renounce them?"

Zhihe replied: "The actions of the wise move with the people, not transgressing their measure. Thus, having enough, they do not contend; having no purpose, they do not seek. Lacking enough, they contend in all directions yet do not consider themselves greedy. Having a purpose, they decline it, abandoning all under Heaven yet do not consider themselves incorrupt. The reality of incorruptibility and greed is not imposed from without—it is a reflection of one’s inner measure.

Though one may hold the power of the Son of Heaven, one does not use nobility to lord over others. Though one may possess all under Heaven, one does not use wealth to toy with others. Calculating the harm, considering the consequences, one deems it injurious to one’s nature and thus does not accept it—not to seek fame and reputation.

Yao and Shun ruled as emperors and were revered, bringing benevolence to all under Heaven, yet did not let beauty harm their lives. Shanjuan and Xu You were offered the throne yet declined—not out of empty words of refusal, but to avoid letting affairs harm themselves. Pursuing benefit and declining harm, all under Heaven calls them worthy—yet they did not do so to seek fame and reputation."

Wu Zu said: "To insist on fame, to torment the body and reject sweetness, to restrain nourishment to preserve life—is this not to suffer long illness and endless hardship without dying?"

Zhihe replied: "Equilibrium is fortune; excess is harm—nothing is exempt, and wealth is the most extreme case. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the taste of fine meats and sweet wines, stirring his mind and causing him to neglect his affairs—this is chaos. Indulging in arrogance, he is like one carrying a heavy burden uphill—this is suffering. Coveting wealth, he takes comfort in it; coveting power, he exhausts himself. At rest, he is drowned in dissipation; in movement, he is swollen with arrogance—this is illness. Pursuing desire and seeking profit, he is stuffed like a blocked ear, unaware of danger, pressing forward without cease—this is disgrace. Wealth accumulates yet goes unused; he clings to it without release, his heart filled with sorrow and resentment, endlessly seeking more—this is anxiety. Within, he fears the threats of extortion and demands; without, he dreads the harm of bandits and thieves. His towers are high, his gates barred—he dares not walk alone outside—this is fear."

These six are the greatest harms under heaven, yet all are abandoned and left unexamined. When their calamities arrive, one exhausts one’s nature and depletes one’s wealth, yet even a single day of carefree ease cannot be regained.

Thus, when one gazes upon their names, they are unseen; when one seeks them, they are unattainable. To strain the mind and break the body in contention for these—is this not delusion?

**Chapter 30: Discourse on Swords (Volume 10, Part 1)**

In former times, King Wen of Zhao was fond of swords. Over three thousand swordsmen thronged his gates as retainers, clashing day and night before him. Each year, a hundred perished or were wounded, yet his passion knew no satiation. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against him.

Crown Prince Kui grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: “Whoever can persuade the king to cease his obsession with swordsmen shall receive a thousand gold pieces.” His attendants replied, “Zhuangzi is the one for this.” The prince then sent envoys bearing a thousand gold to present to Zhuangzi.

Zhuangzi declined the gift but accompanied the envoys to see the prince. He asked, “What instruction does the prince have for me, that he bestows a thousand gold?” The prince said, “I have heard that you, Master, are enlightened and sagely. I humbly offer this gold to honor your attendants. If you refuse it, how dare I speak further?”

Zhuangzi replied, “I have heard that the prince wishes to employ me to end the king’s fondness for swords. If I persuade the king but oppose his will, or fail to please the prince, I would face execution. What use would gold be to me then? But if I succeed in persuading the king and satisfy the prince, what in Zhao could I not obtain?”

The prince said, “Indeed. My father the king sees only swordsmen.” Zhuangzi said, “Very well. I am skilled in the sword.” The prince said, “Yet the swordsmen the king favors all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, slouching caps, tassels of coarse silk, short-backed robes, glaring eyes, and harsh speech. The king delights in them. If you, Master, appear before him in Confucian garb, the matter will surely fail.”

Zhuangzi said, “Permit me to prepare a swordsman’s attire.” After three days, he had his sword attire ready and was presented to the prince. The prince then brought him before the king, who stood with bared blade awaiting him.

Zhuangzi entered the palace gates without haste and did not bow to the king. The king asked, “What instruction do you bring, that the prince precedes you?” Zhuangzi replied, “I have heard of your fondness for swords, so I have come to present myself as a swordsman.”

The king asked, “What can your sword do to restrain others?” Zhuangzi said, “My sword cuts down one man every ten paces, leaving no trace in its path.” The king was greatly pleased and exclaimed, “Then you are invincible under heaven!”

Zhuangzi said, “The way of the sword is to present emptiness, open the advantage, strike after the opponent moves, and arrive before him. I wish to demonstrate this.” The king said, “Rest now, Master. Return to your lodging and await my summons. I shall arrange a contest and invite you.”

The king then assembled swordsmen for seven days. Over sixty were killed or wounded, and five or six were selected. These were ordered to present their swords at the palace steps, whereupon the king summoned Zhuangzi.

The king said, “Today, let the swordsmen test their skill in earnest.” Zhuangzi replied, “I have long awaited this.” The king asked, “What length of weapon do you prefer, Master?” Zhuangzi said, “Any I am given will suffice. Yet I possess three swords, to be wielded as the king wishes. Permit me to describe them before demonstrating.”

The king said, “I wish to hear of them.” Zhuangzi said, “There is the sword of the Son of Heaven, the sword of the feudal lords, and the sword of the commoner.”

The king asked, “What is the sword of the Son of Heaven like?” Zhuangzi replied, “The sword of the Son of Heaven has its blade forged from Yanxi and Shicheng, its edge from Mount Tai of Qi, its spine from Jin and Wei, its guard from Zhou and Song, and its grip from Liang. It is bound by the Four Barbarians, wrapped in the Four Seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Chang.”

This sword is governed by the Five Phases, judged by punishment and virtue; opened by yin and yang, held by spring and summer, and wielded by autumn and winter. When this sword is drawn, none stand before it; when raised, none surpass it; when pressed downward, none lie beneath it; when swung, none stand beside it. Above, it parts the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. Once this sword is employed, the feudal lords are brought to order, and all under heaven submit. This is the sword of the Son of Heaven.”

King Wen, overwhelmed, lost himself in thought and said, “What is the sword of the feudal lords like?”

Zhuangzi replied, “The sword of the feudal lords has its blade forged from the wise and brave, its edge from the pure and resolute, its spine from the worthy and good, its guard from the loyal and sagely, and its grip from the heroic and outstanding. This sword, when drawn, likewise has none before it; when raised, none above it; when pressed downward, none beneath it; when swung, none beside it. Above, it models the round heavens, following the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth, following the Four Seasons. Within, it harmonizes the people’s will, bringing peace to the four directions. Once this sword is employed, it strikes like thunder, and within the four borders, none fail to submit and heed its command. This is the sword of the feudal lords.”

The king asked, “What is the sword of the commoner like?”

Zhuangzi said, “The sword of the commoner is wielded by those with unkempt hair and bristling sideburns, wearing drooping caps with loose, tangled cords, short-backed robes, glaring fiercely as they argue, clashing before one another. Above, they sever necks and throats; below, they pierce livers. This sword of the commoner differs not from fighting cocks—once their lives are spent, they serve no purpose in the affairs of state. Now, Your Majesty, possessing the position of the Son of Heaven, yet delighting in the sword of the commoner—I privately deem this unworthy of you.”

The king then led Zhuangzi by the hand and ascended the hall. The royal chef presented the meal, and the king circled it thrice. Zhuangzi said, “May Your Majesty sit composed and calm your qi. The matter of the swords has been presented in full!”

Thereupon, King Wen did not leave the palace for three months, and the swordsmen all died by their own hands where they stood.

Confucius wandered in the forest of black curtains and rested upon the Apricot Terrace. His disciples read aloud, while Confucius plucked the zither and sang. The melody was not yet half-finished when an old fisherman came ashore, his beard and brows snowy white, hair unbound, sleeves swaying as he walked up from the marsh. He stopped at the edge of the land, left hand resting on his knee, right hand supporting his chin, listening. When the song ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, who both stepped forward.

The stranger pointed at Confucius and asked, “Who is that man?”

Zilu replied, “A gentleman of Lu.”

The stranger asked of his lineage, and Zilu answered, “The Kong clan.”

“And what does the Kong clan govern?”

Zilu did not respond, but Zigong said, “The Kong clan cultivates loyalty and trust in their nature, practices benevolence and righteousness in their conduct, refines ritual and music, and orders human relationships. Above, they are loyal to the rulers of the age; below, they transform the common people, all to benefit the world. This is what the Kong clan governs.”

The stranger asked again, “Is he a lord with lands?”

Zigong said, “No.”

“Is he an advisor to kings and marquises?”

Zigong said, “No.”

The old man laughed and turned away, saying as he walked, “Benevolent, indeed, he is—but I fear he will not escape harm to himself. With toil of mind and strain of body, he endangers his true nature. Alas!”

“How far removed he is from the Dao!”

Zilu returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, “Could he be a sage?” He then descended to seek him. Reaching the riverbank, he saw the old man leaning on his staff and drawing his boat. The old man turned, saw Confucius, and stood facing him.

Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and stepped forward. The old man asked, “What do you seek?”

Confucius replied, “Earlier, Master left with words unfinished. I, Qiu, unworthy as I am, did not grasp their meaning. I waited humbly in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or the fall of your spittle, that I might at last receive your guidance.”

The old man exclaimed, “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “I, Qiu, have cultivated learning to this day, now sixty-nine years old, yet have never heard such profound instruction. How dare I not remain open in heart?”

The old man said, “Like attracts like, and sound answers sound—this is the principle of Heaven. I shall now set forth what I possess and expound upon what concerns you. What concerns you is human affairs. When the Son of Heaven, feudal lords, ministers, and commoners—these four ranks—each rectify themselves, governance attains its beauty. But when these four abandon their stations, no disorder is greater.

When officials fulfill their duties, and each person attends to their affairs, none overstep their bounds. Thus, when fields lie fallow and homes stand exposed, when clothing and food are insufficient, when taxes and levies are unmet, when wives and concubines are discordant, when elders and juniors lack order—these are the concerns of the common people.

When one’s abilities fall short of their office, when official duties go unmanaged, when conduct is not pure and bright, when subordinates grow idle and neglectful, when meritorious deeds go unrecognized, when ranks and emoluments are not secured—these are the worries of ministers.

When the court lacks loyal ministers, when the state is benighted and disordered, when skills are unrefined, when tribute and duties are unfulfilled, when spring and autumn audiences fall behind schedule, when one does not submit to the Son of Heaven—these are the concerns of feudal lords.

When yin and yang are not in harmony, when cold and heat arrive untimely, harming the myriad things; when feudal lords act with violence and disorder, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; when ritual and music lack moderation, when resources are exhausted, when human relationships are not ordered, when clans engage in licentiousness and disorder—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s officials.

Now, you possess neither the authority of a lord or official above, nor the office of a minister with its duties below, yet you presume to adorn ritual and music, select and order human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not overreaching in affairs?

Moreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot be overlooked.

To meddle in affairs not one’s own is called *zong* (presumption).
To advance without regard is called *ning* (obsequiousness).
To speak ingratiatingly to curry favor is called *chan* (flattery).
To speak without discerning right or wrong is called *yu* (sycophancy).
To delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *chan* (slander).
To sever friendships and estrange kin is called *zei* (treachery).
To praise the wicked and deceive the good is called *te* (depravity).
To lack discernment of good and bad, to accommodate both sides, and to seize what one desires is called *xian* (perfidy).

These eight flaws externally confuse others and internally harm oneself. The noble person does not befriend such, and the enlightened ruler does not employ them.

The four perils are these:
To delight in managing great affairs, altering and changing constants, and clinging to fame and merit is called *tao* (overreaching).
To monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, encroach upon others, and act self-righteously is called *tan* (greed).
To see one’s faults yet not change, and to hear remonstrance yet grow more obstinate, is called *hen* (obduracy).
To approve only what aligns with oneself and to reject what differs, even if good, is called *jin* (arrogance).

These are the four perils. Only when one has shed the eight flaws and is free of the four perils can one begin to be taught.”

Confucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying, “I, Qiu, was twice driven from Lu, had my traces erased in Wei, was felled like a tree in Song, and was besieged between Chen and Cai. I do not know what faults I committed to incur these four slanders.”

The old man’s expression turned sorrowful as he said, “How difficult it is for you to awaken! When a man flees from his shadow and shuns his footprints, the more he lifts his feet, the more footprints he leaves; the faster he runs, the more his shadow clings. Believing himself still too slow, he exhausts his strength and dies. Yet he does not know that by resting in the shade, his shadow will vanish, and by stillness, his footprints will cease. How foolish!

You scrutinize the space between benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundaries of sameness and difference, observe the changes of movement and stillness, measure the degrees of giving and receiving, order the passions of likes and dislikes, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you nearly escape none of this. Be diligent in cultivation, guard your true nature carefully, and return things to others, and you will have no encumbrances. Now, you do not cultivate yourself but seek from others—is this not misplaced?”

Confucius sighed deeply and said, “May I ask what is meant by *zhen* (the real)?”

The old man replied, “*Zhen* is the utmost of essence and sincerity. Without essence and sincerity, one cannot move others. Forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though stern, is not awe-inspiring; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is silent yet mournful; true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring; true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When the real resides within, the spirit moves without—this is why the real is prized.

In its application to human principles:
With parents, it is kindness and filial piety;
with rulers, it is loyalty and integrity;
in drinking, it is joy;
in mourning, it is sorrow.

Loyalty and integrity take merit as their essence;
drinking takes joy as its essence;
mourning takes sorrow as its essence;
serving parents takes comfort as its essence.

When merit is achieved, no trace of it remains;
when serving parents brings comfort, no means are sought;
when drinking brings joy, no particular vessels are chosen;
when mourning brings sorrow, no inquiry into ritual is made.

Ritual is what the common customs devise;
the real is what one receives from Heaven, naturally and unalterably.

Thus, the sage models Heaven and prizes the real, not constrained by custom. The foolish do this not. Unable to model Heaven and anxious about others, they do not know the value of the real. They drift along, swayed by custom, and thus are unworthy. Alas! You have long been immersed in human artifice and only now hear of the great Dao!”

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “Today I, Qiu, have met you as if by Heaven’s favor.”

The master did not disdain to liken himself to a servant and personally instruct him. I venture to ask where you dwell, that I may follow and receive your teaching to complete my study of the great Dao.”

The master said, “I have heard that one may accompany those who are fit to journey with, but as for the subtle Dao, those unfit to journey with cannot comprehend it. Be cautious not to share it with them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on! I leave you now, I leave you now!” With that, he poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds.

Yan Yuan turned the chariot around, while Zilu handed the reins. Confucius did not look back, waiting until the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the oar vanished before daring to board. Zilu stepped beside the chariot and asked, “I have long served you, yet never have I seen you meet another with such reverence. Even the lords of ten thousand chariots or the rulers of a thousand, when they meet you, do not fail to observe proper courtesy, yet you still maintain a dignified bearing. Now this old fisherman, leaning on his oar and standing upright, and you bowed at the waist like a chime stone, responding with words and bows—was this not excessive? Your disciples all find it strange. How could this fisherman deserve such treatment?”

Confucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed, saying, “How deeply entrenched your difficulty in transformation is! Though you have been steeped in ritual and propriety for some time, your rustic and coarse heart remains unchanged to this day. Come closer, let me tell you: to fail to show respect when meeting an elder is impropriety; to fail to honor the worthy is a lack of benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. Without perfecting humility, one cannot attain the real, and thus one’s person suffers lasting harm. Alas! There is no greater misfortune for a person than a lack of benevolence, and you alone cling to it. Moreover, the Dao is the path by which all things proceed. Those who lose it die; those who attain it live. Acting against it brings failure; following it brings success. Therefore, wherever the Dao resides, the sage honors it. This old fisherman may be said to possess it—how could I dare not show respect?”

When Liezi of Lie Yukou journeyed to Qi, he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Maoren. Bohun Maoren asked, “Why have you returned?”

Liezi said, “I was alarmed.”

“By what?”

“I dined at ten inns, and at five of them, the broth was served before the rice.”

Bohun Maoren said, “If that is so, why were you alarmed?”

Liezi replied, “Though my inner sincerity was not yet dissolved, my outward demeanor shone with self-importance, thereby unsettling others’ hearts and causing them to treat the honored and the aged lightly, stirring up the very troubles they seek to avoid. Now, the broth-sellers merely trade in food and drink, with no great profit to spare. Their influence is slight, their power light, yet even so, they acted thus—how much more so the lords of ten thousand chariots? Their bodies are wearied by the state, their knowledge exhausted by affairs. They would entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. That is why I was alarmed.”

Bohun Maoren said, “Excellent observation!”

"Now abide thus, and others will come to preserve you!"

Before long, Liezi returned to find the space outside the door filled with shoes. Bohun Maoren stood facing north, his staff planted firmly beneath his chin. After a time, he spoke not a word and departed. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed out barefoot, shoes in hand, and caught up at the gate:

"Master, since you have come, will you not dispense your remedy?"

Bohun Maoren replied, "It is done. I had already told you: others will come to preserve you—and indeed, they have preserved you! You may make others preserve you, yet you cannot make them cease preserving you—why then do you seek to stir their admiration with such extraordinary displays? If you must provoke a response, let it arise from your root nature, not from empty gestures. Those who wander with you offer no true counsel. Their petty words are all poison to men. None awaken, none perceive—how can they discern one another? The cunning toil, the wise fret, the capable seek nothing. Sated, they roam at ease, drifting like untethered boats—empty, they wander freely!"

Zheng’s Huan sighed and groaned upon the lands of Qiu.

"Within three years, Huan of Zheng became a Confucian. As a river moistens nine *li* and its blessings extend to three clans, his younger brother became a Mohist. The Confucians and Mohists debated, and their father sided with Mo Di. After ten years, Huan took his own life. In a dream, his father addressed him: 'It was I who made your son a Mohist—why did you never examine his true nature? Had he already become the fruit of the autumn cypress?'

The Creator’s retribution upon men does not punish the man himself but the Heaven within him—thus it was for Huan. When a man deems himself possessed of something that sets him apart from others, thereby dishonoring his kin, even those who draw water from the same well will come to blows. Thus it is said: all in this age are Huan. From this, those with virtue do so without awareness—how much more so those who embody the Dao!

In ancient times, this was called 'the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.' The sage finds peace in what is inherently peaceful and does not seek peace in what is inherently restless; the multitude seeks peace in what is inherently restless and finds no peace in what is inherently peaceful."

Zhuangzi said: "To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is difficult. To know and not speak—this is the way to Heaven. To know and speak—this is the way of man. The ancients followed Heaven and not man."

Zhu Pingman studied dragon-slaying under Zhi Liyi, exhausting a thousand gold from his family. After three years, his skill was perfected—yet there was no use for his craft.

The sage takes what must not be as what must not be, and so has no weapons. The multitude takes what must not be as what must be, and so has many weapons. Yielding to weapons, their actions become demands. Where weapons go, ruin follows.

The petty man’s knowledge clings to bribes and trivial documents, wasting his spirit on the shallow and narrow, yet seeks to encompass the Dao and all things, to embody the Great Unity and the formless. Such a one is lost amid the cosmos, his form burdened, unaware of the Great Beginning.

The perfected person returns his spirit to the beginningless, merging with the realm of Nothing Whatever. Like water flowing without form, it disperses into the Great Purity.

Alas! You take your knowledge to be as fine as a hair’s tip, yet do not know the Great Peace!

There was a man of Song named Cao Shang, sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his journey, he obtained several carriages. The King of Qin was pleased with him and added a hundred more carriages. Returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: “To dwell in a cramped alley, impoverished and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is what I was poor at. But to awaken a ruler of ten thousand chariots and follow with a hundred carriages—this is what I excel at.”

Zhuangzi replied: “When the King of Qin was ill, he summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one carriage; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five carriages. The baser the treatment, the more carriages they received. Did you, perhaps, treat his ailments? Why else would you have received so many carriages?”

"Be gone!" Duke Ai of Lu asked Yan He, saying: "I take Zhongni as the pillar of the state—will the nation then recover?" Yan He replied: "Kong Qiu is perilous indeed! He adorns himself with feathers and paints, engages in florid speech, takes the branch for the root, and suppresses his nature to gaze upon the people. He knows not what is untrustworthy, yet receives it in his heart as steward. How could such a one be fit to govern the people? Is he fit for you? Or fit for me? To err thus is permissible! Now, to cause the people to depart from true learning and embrace falsity—this is no way to govern them. To consider posterity thus is unwise. Cease this course, for governance will be difficult!"

What is bestowed upon others yet not forgotten is not the Heavenly distribution. Merchants are held in contempt; even when ranked among them by office, the spiritually attuned hold them in contempt. External punishments are meted out by metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the truly capable escape both inner and outer punishments.

Confucius said: "The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk. But man conceals his nature beneath a thick façade. Thus, some appear sincere yet are insatiable; some seem long-suffering yet are unworthy; some are compliant yet perverse; some are resolute yet lax; some are gentle yet fierce. Those who rush to righteousness do so as if parched; those who flee it do so as if scorched. Therefore, the noble man sends them far to observe their loyalty, keeps them near to observe their reverence, burdens them to observe their ability, questions them suddenly to observe their knowledge, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their composure, and mingles them with others to observe their demeanor. When these nine tests are complete, the unworthy are revealed."

Zheng Kaofu, upon his first appointment, bent low; upon his second, stooped; upon his third, bowed deeply, creeping along the wall—who would dare transgress! Yet there are those who, upon their first appointment, strut like Lü Ju; upon their second, dance atop their carriage; upon their third, address elders by name. Who could align with Tang or Xu? No calamity is greater than virtue with intent, and intent with eyelashes. Once intent has eyelashes, it turns inward; turning inward, it fails.

There are five inauspicious virtues, with "central virtue" foremost. What is central virtue? It is one who, while esteeming himself, reviles what he does not possess. There are eight extremes of poverty and three certainties of success; the body has six repositories. Beauty, whiskers, height, stature, strength, comeliness, courage, and boldness—those who surpass others in all eight rely on these. Following customs, reclining, or cowering in fear when inferior to others—these three lead to success. Wisdom and intelligence that reach outward breed resentment; bold action invites many grudges; benevolence and righteousness bring many demands. Those who penetrate to the truth of success are puppets; those who penetrate to knowledge are diminished. Those who grasp the great mandate follow; those who grasp the small mandate encounter it.

A man who had an audience with the King of Song was granted ten carriages. With these ten carriages, he arrogantly boasted to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: "By the river there was a poor family who wove rushes to eat. Their son dived into the depths and obtained a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him: 'Bring a stone to pound it! A pearl of a thousand gold pieces must lie in the ninefold abyss beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you must have encountered its sleep. Had the black dragon awakened, what trace of you would remain?' Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss; the ferocity of the King of Song is not merely that of a black dragon. That you could obtain these carriages means you must have encountered his sleep. Had the King of Song awakened, you would be reduced to mincemeat."

Someone sought to engage Zhuangzi’s services, and Zhuangzi replied to the envoy: "Have you seen the sacrificial ox? Clothed in embroidered brocade, fed on fine hay and grain—yet when it is led into the great temple, would it still wish to be a lonely calf?"

As Zhuangzi neared death, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: "I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffin, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars as my pearls and beads, and the ten thousand things as my funeral gifts. Are not my burial furnishings complete? What could be added to them?" His disciples said: "We fear the crows and kites will devour you." Zhuangzi replied: "Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by ants and mole crickets. To snatch from one to give to the other—how partial is that!"

To level with what is not level is to make leveling unlevel; to verify with what is not verifiable is to make verification unverifiable. The enlightened are but servants of it; the spiritually attuned are its witnesses. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritually attuned has long been so—yet fools rely on what they see to impose upon others. Their achievements are external; is this not lamentable?

**Chapter Thirty-Three: "The World"**

Those in the world who cultivate methods of governance are many, each believing their own way cannot be surpassed. What, then, was the Dao/Way of the ancients? It was said: "Nowhere is it not present." It was asked: "How does the spirit descend? How does clarity emerge?" It was answered: "The sage has a source of arising; the king has a source of accomplishment—both are one."

Not departing from the origin is called the Heavenly Person; not departing from the essence is called the Spirit Person; not departing from the real is called the Perfected Person. Taking heaven as the origin, virtue/power as the root, and the Dao/Way as the gate, foretelling change and transformation—this is called the sage. Taking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, exuding gentle compassion—this is called the gentleman. Taking law as distinction, names as markers, evidence as proof, and investigation as decision, counting one, two, three, four as their measure, officials rank one another by this, taking affairs as the norm, clothing and food as the priority, multiplying and storing, caring for the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed—this is the governance of the people.

The ancients were complete! They matched the spirit luminaries, harmonized with heaven and earth, nurtured the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, and extended their blessings to the hundred clans. Illuminating the root and the numbers, connecting to the branches and the measures, penetrating the six directions and opening the four gates, whether small or great, refined or coarse, their movement was nowhere absent.

What is clear and lies in numbers and measures—old laws and transmitted histories still preserve much of it. What lies in the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*—scholars of Zou and Lu, and the gentry, can often clarify it. The *Songs* convey the will; the *Documents* convey affairs; the *Rites* convey conduct; the *Music* conveys harmony; the *Changes* convey yin and yang; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* convey names and duties. These methods spread throughout the world and within the central states, and the hundred schools of thought occasionally praise and expound them.

When the world was in great disorder, the worthy and sagely were obscured, and the Dao/Way and virtue/power were not unified. People in the world each grasped one insight and took pride in it. Like the ears and eyes, each has its clarity but cannot communicate with the other. Like the hundred schools and their arts, each has its strengths and occasional uses. Yet they are not comprehensive or all-encompassing—they are partial scholars.

Judging the beauty of heaven and earth, analyzing the principles of the ten thousand things, examining the wholeness of the ancients—few can fully grasp the beauty of heaven and earth or match the bearing of the spirit. Thus, the Dao/Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship has grown dim and unmanifest, pent-up and unexpressed. People in the world each follow their desires to create their own methods. How lamentable! The hundred schools have gone forth and not returned—they will surely not converge.

Later scholars, unfortunately, do not see the purity of heaven and earth or the great form of the ancients. The Dao/Way is about to be torn apart by the world. Not extravagant toward later generations, not wasteful toward the ten thousand things, not dazzled by numbers and measures, using the inked cord to correct themselves and prepare for the world’s emergencies—there are those in whom the Dao/Way resides.

Mo Di and Qin Guli heard of this wind and delighted in it. They overdid it greatly, yet considered it the greatest compliance. They composed *Against Music* and called it *Moderation in Use*. They did not sing in life and wore no mourning in death. Mozi advocated universal love and mutual benefit while opposing strife; his Dao/Way did not involve anger. He was also fond of learning and broad in knowledge, yet did not align with the former kings, instead condemning the rites and music of antiquity.

The Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*; Yao had *Great Chapter*; Shun had *Great Shao*; Yu had *Great Xia*; Tang had *Great Hu*; King Wen had the music of the *Biyong*; King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*. In the mourning rites of antiquity, the noble and base had their proper forms, the high and low their ranks. The Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins; the feudal lords, five; the great officers, three; and the scholars, two. Yet Mozi alone advocated no singing in life and no mourning in death, using a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin as the model. Teaching others this, he did not seem to love them; practicing it himself, he certainly did not love himself. Though Mozi’s Dao/Way has not yet failed, singing yet not singing, weeping yet not weeping, joy yet not joy—is this truly fitting? His life was toilsome, his death meager, his Dao/Way harsh. He made people anxious, made people sorrowful—his conduct was difficult to follow. I fear he will not be taken as a sage but will instead turn the world’s heart away. The world cannot endure it. Though Mozi alone could bear it, what can he do about the world? Separated from the world, he is far from the kingly way!

Mozi proclaimed: "In ancient times, Yu controlled the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers to connect the four barbarians and the nine provinces. The great rivers numbered three hundred, the tributaries three thousand, and the smaller streams were innumerable. Yu personally wielded the spade and basket to dredge the world’s rivers..."

His calves bore no flesh, his shins no hair—soaked by torrential rains, combed by fierce winds, he settled the myriad states. Yu was a great sage, yet his body toiled for the world to such an extent.

Thus later Mohists, many clad in coarse wool and hemp, bound their feet in sandals, laboring day and night without rest, taking self-affliction as the utmost virtue. They declared: "Without this, one does not follow Yu’s Dao/Way and is unworthy to be called a Mohist." The disciples of Xiangli Qin, the followers of Wu Hou, and the southern Mohists such as Huo, Yi Chi, and Deng Lingzi—all recited the *Mo Jing*, yet their interpretations diverged, each calling the others "deviant Mohists." They disparaged one another with debates on "hard and white" and "same and different," responded with arguments of "odd and even" and "non-correspondence," and revered the *juzi* as a sage. All wished to be his embodiment, hoping to succeed him, yet to this day the matter remains unresolved. Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intent was sound, but their conduct was misguided. They would compel later Mohists to advance only by emulating Yu’s self-mortification—calves without flesh, shins without hair. This is the height of disorder, the nadir of governance.

Nevertheless, Mozi was truly the world’s finest. One could seek his like in vain; though withered and gaunt, he never abandoned his cause. What a man of talent! Unburdened by convention, unadorned by externals, uncompromising with others, unhostile to the multitude, he longed for the world’s peace to preserve the people’s lives. His own sustenance sufficed once fulfilled, and with this he purified his heart.

Among the ancient arts of the Dao/Way, some resided in this. Song Xing and Yin Wen, hearing of his spirit, delighted in it. They crafted flower-shaped caps to mark themselves, engaging with all things by first dispelling prejudice. They spoke of the heart’s capacity, calling it "the heart’s conduct," seeking harmony through gentleness and inwardness. They wished to establish this as their guiding principle. Unashamed by insult, they rescued people from strife, forbade aggression, and halted warfare to save the world from conflict. With this, they traversed the world, persuading rulers above and instructing the people below. Though the world did not accept them, they persisted stubbornly, refusing to desist. Thus it is said: they were wearying to both high and low, yet forced themselves upon them.

Yet their conduct was excessive, their self-restraint too meager. They declared: "Five pints of rice suffice. Though the master may not be full, the disciples, though hungry, do not forget the world." Day and night they labored without rest, saying: "We must surely save lives! How proud we are among those who rescue the world!" They held: "The noble person is not overly scrupulous, nor lends himself to things. What benefits not the world is better left unclarified."

They took the prohibition of warfare as their external concern and the moderation of desires as their internal one. In matters great and small, refined and coarse, their conduct extended only so far. Impartial yet not partisan, yielding yet without bias, resolute yet without fixed views, they followed things without duality, unburdened by deliberation, unguided by cunning. Things were not chosen; they moved with them as one. Among the ancient arts of the Dao/Way, some resided in this.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao, hearing of this spirit, delighted in it. They took the equalization of the myriad things as their starting point, saying: "Heaven can cover but not bear them; earth can bear but not cover them; the great Dao/Way can encompass but not distinguish them." Knowing all things have what they can and cannot do, they declared: "Selection is not universal; teaching does not reach all; only the Dao/Way leaves nothing out."

Thus Shen Dao abandoned knowledge and self, following only what could not be avoided. He flowed with things, taking this as the principle of the Dao/Way. He said: "To know yet appear not to know is to verge on harming knowledge." Unconstrained and unburdened, he mocked the world’s esteem for worthies; unshackled and unprincipled, he rejected the world’s great sages. Leveling and severing, he turned with things, discarding right and wrong to merely avoid harm. Unbound by knowledge or foresight, without precedence or delay, he stood alone. Pushed, he moved; pulled, he went—like a whirling gale, a spinning feather, a grinding stone’s groove. Whole yet without fault, in motion or still without error, he never incurred blame. Why? Things without knowledge have no peril of self-assertion; their use imposes no burden, their movement and stillness never depart from principle, so they live without praise. Thus it is said: "Attain the state of unknowing things; do not employ worthies or sages. An uncarved block does not lose the Dao/Way."

The heroic mocked them, saying: "Shen Dao’s Dao/Way is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—how strange!" Tian Pian was the same, studying under Peng Meng and receiving his unorthodox teaching. Peng Meng’s master said: "The ancient Daoists reached the point of neither affirming nor denying. Their spirit was vast and indistinct—how could one speak of it?" They constantly opposed others, avoiding observation yet not escaping judgment. What they called the Dao/Way was not the Dao/Way, and their so-called rightness was not free from error. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not understand the Dao/Way. Nevertheless, they roughly grasped something of it.

Taking the root as refined, things as coarse, accumulation as insufficiency, they dwelled in serene solitude with the spiritually luminous. Among the ancient arts of the Dao/Way, some resided in this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan, hearing of this spirit, delighted in it. They built upon the constant of "non-being and being," centered it on the Great One, took gentleness, weakness, and humility as their outward expression, and emptiness that does not destroy the myriad things as their substance.

Guan Yin said: "Abide in nothing, and things will manifest themselves." His movement was like water, his stillness like a mirror, his response like an echo. Vague as if vanished, silent as if pure. Those who harmonized with him were at peace; those who grasped him lost. He never preceded others but always followed.

Lao Dan said: "Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and be a ravine to the world. Know the white, yet guard the disgraced, and be a valley to the world."

All men seek to be first, yet he alone takes the last place, saying: "I bear the world’s filth." All men seek fullness, yet he alone remains empty, holding nothing in store—thus he has abundance, towering and inexhaustible. In his conduct, he moves slowly without waste, does nothing yet mocks cleverness. All men seek fortune, yet he alone bends to preserve wholeness, saying: "Let me but escape blame." He takes depth as his root, restraint as his guiding principle, and declares: "What is hard will shatter; what is sharp will dull." Ever tolerant toward things, never carving away at others—this may be called perfection. Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! They were the vast and true men of old!

Vague and formless, changing without constancy—are they dead or alive? Do they stand with heaven and earth, journey with the gods? Dim and obscure, where do they go? Where do they turn? All things are gathered in, yet none can claim them as their home. Such was the Dao/Way of the ancients.

Zhuang Zhou heard of this spirit and delighted in it. With absurd and wandering words, wild and boundless speech, endless and unbounded phrases, he gave free rein to his whims, never showing partiality. He took the world as too sunk in turbidity for solemn discourse, so he used careless words to ramble, weighty words as truth, and parables to broaden meaning. Alone he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, never condescending to things, never entangled in right and wrong, living among the common world. Though his writings were strange and wondrous, they flowed without harm. Though his words were uneven, their strangeness was worth beholding. His fullness could not be exhausted: above, he wandered with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond death and without end. In his grasp of the root, he was vast and open, deep and unconstrained; in his reverence for the source, he was richly attuned and lofty. Yet in responding to change and dissolving things, his principles never ran dry, his coming never ceased. Dim and obscure—who can fathom him?

Hui Shi was a man of many methods. His writings filled five carts, yet his Dao/Way was contradictory and his words often missed the mark. In his "Survey of Things," he said: "What is utterly great has no outside—call it the Great One. What is utterly small has no inside—call it the Small One. What has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet it spans a thousand miles. Heaven is as low as earth; mountains are level with marshes. The sun is both at its zenith and setting; things are born and die at once. Great sameness differs from small sameness—this is called 'small sameness and difference.' All things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called 'great sameness and difference.' The south is both boundless and bounded. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the world’s center—it lies north of Yan and south of Yue. Embrace all things, for heaven and earth are one."

Hui Shi took this as his great insight, surveying the world to enlighten debaters. The debaters of the world rejoiced in it. Eggs have feathers; a chicken has three feet; the world can be possessed; a dog can become a sheep; a frog has a tail; fire is not hot; a mountain has a mouth; a wheel does not touch the ground; eyes do not see; a finger does not reach, yet reaching never ceases; a tortoise is longer than a snake; a square is not made with a ruler, nor a circle with a compass; a chisel does not fit its handle; a flying bird’s shadow never moves; an arrow’s flight is both motionless and moving; a white dog is black; a lone colt never had a mother; take half of a one-foot stick each day, and it will never be exhausted after ten thousand generations.

Such were the exchanges with which Hui Shi matched wits, never at a loss. Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, with their band of debaters, adorned men’s minds and altered their intentions. They could win in argument but not convince the heart—such is the trap of debaters. Hui Shi daily used his knowledge to contend with others, creating monstrosities in debate. This was his foundation. Yet in his verbal sparring, he deemed himself the worthiest, saying: "Is not heaven and earth grand? Yet Hui Shi stands mighty, though without method."

In the south there was an eccentric named Huang Liao who asked why heaven and earth do not collapse or sink, and the causes of wind, rain, and thunder. Hui Shi did not decline to answer, nor did he ponder before responding. He discoursed on all things without pause, yet still felt his words were few and added more strangeness. He took contrariness as truth and sought fame in victory—thus he never fit in with others. Weak in virtue yet strong in things, his path was narrow. Viewed by the Dao/Way of heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s efforts were like the labor of a single mosquito or gnat—what use were they to things? To be content with one thing would have been better; to value the Dao/Way would have been near perfection. Yet Hui Shi could not find peace in this. He scattered himself among the ten thousand things without surfeit, ending as a master of debate.

Alas! Hui Shi’s talent was vast but unfulfilled. Chasing the ten thousand things without return—he was like one who exhausts sound to make an echo, or races with his shadow. How sad!
