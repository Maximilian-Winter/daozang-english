*Comprehensive True Meaning of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*
*Daoist Category*
*Abstract*

We, your ministers, respectfully note: *The Comprehensive True Meaning of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* in three juan was compiled by Peng Xiao of Later Shu. Xiao, styled Xiuchuan, was a native of Yongkang who styled himself Zhenyi Zi. He served Meng Chang as Chaosanlang, holding the position of Yuanwailang in the Ministry of Rites, and was granted the Purple Gold Fish Bag. Details of his life remain obscure. Yang Shen’s preface to the ancient edition of the *Cantong Qi* identifies Xiao as a Daoist. Considering that during the reign of Wang Jian, Du Guangting was once appointed to office as a Daoist, it is plausible that Xiao was also a Daoist, though the source of this information is unknown.

The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* by Ge Hong states that Wei Boyang authored the *Cantong Qi*, a work in three juan on the mutual generation of the Five Phases, which ostensibly expounds the *Zhouyi* but in fact employs hexagram imagery to discuss the principles of elixir-making. Confucian scholars, unfamiliar with the art of divine elixirs, often annotate it in terms of yin-yang theory, thereby missing its true essence.

Upon examination, the text frequently employs the method of "receiving the celestial stems" (nayin) to expound the essentials of kan (☵) and li (☲), water and fire, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, using yin-yang, the Five Phases, and the timing of dusk and dawn as indicators for advancement, retreat, and practice. Later works on alchemical furnace techniques all regard this book as their progenitor. The *Sui Shu: Bibliographic Treatise* does not record it, while the *Old Tang Shu: Bibliographic Treatise* first lists the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* in two juan and *Zhouyi Wuxiang Qi* in one juan, erroneously classifying them under the Five Phases category, which deviates from their original purpose.

Xiao’s preface states that Boyang first presented the text to Xu, an Attendant Officer in Qingzhou, who then concealed his name and annotated it. During the reign of Emperor Huan of the Han, it was transmitted to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery, thereby circulating in the world. However, those who transmitted its secrets were rare—perhaps this account is plausible. The *Tongzhi: Bibliographic Treatise* by Zheng Qiao later established a separate category for the *Cantong Qi*, listing nineteen annotated editions totaling thirty-one juan. Today, most of these are lost, with only Xiao’s edition surviving. It is divided into ninety chapters to correspond with the yang number nine, while the "Song of the Cauldron and Vessel," with its fragmented verses difficult to divide into chapters, is preserved separately at the end to correspond with the water number one. Additionally, Xiao composed the "Illuminating Mirror Diagrams and Secrets," appended to the end of the lower juan.

Xiao’s own prefaces, both preceding and following the text, elucidate its meaning in great detail. Among all annotated editions of the *Cantong Qi*, this is the earliest. During the Jiajing reign of the Ming, Yang Shen claimed that an ancient text of the *Cantong Qi* was unearthed from a stone casket in the south, purported to be Boyang’s original version, and asserted that Xiao’s edition had confused the text and commentary. Those fond of novelty often believed this claim. However, Zhu Xi’s *Investigation of Discrepancies in the Cantong Qi* follows the chapter sequence of Xiao’s edition. The *Cantong Qi* text included in the *Yongle Encyclopedia* also entirely adopts Xiao’s version, incorporating the annotations of Yu Yan and others beneath it. This demonstrates that Xiao’s edition, transmitted from the late Tang period, has a clear lineage of transmission. The version propagated by Yang Shen likely belongs to the same category as Feng Fang’s *Ancient Great Learning*—utterly absurd and unworthy of credence. Therefore, in compiling the annotated editions of the *Cantong Qi*, we still place this edition at the forefront.

Respectfully submitted for imperial review in the ninth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.

**Preface to the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi Tongzhen Yi***

According to the hagiographies of the Perfected Immortal Wei Boyang of *Shenxian Zhuan*, Wei Boyang was a native of Shangyu in Guiji. Born into a family of hereditary officials, he alone declined office, cultivating the True and dwelling in reclusion, nurturing his will in emptiness and nonbeing. His literary talents were vast, his writings profound, and he was well-versed in apocrypha and divination. Serene and unadorned, he adhered solely to the Dao, regarding courtly robes and carriages as mere husks. It is unknown from which master he received transmission, but he obtained the ancient text *Longhu Jing* and fully grasped its profound principles. Thereupon, he condensed the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters. Feeling that its subtleties were not yet exhausted, he further wrote the *Busa Yituo* to supplement omissions. Expounding the arcane mysteries of the *Dan Jing*, his descriptions often employed allegory, borrowing events to conceal and reveal, using variant texts to subtly instruct. The Attendant Officer of Qingzhou, Xu, then concealed his name and annotated it.

By the reign of Emperor Huan of the Later Han, Boyang once more transmitted it to his fellow townsman Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it circulated in the world. In composing the *Cantong Qi*, Boyang declared that the cultivation of the elixir shares the same path as the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth. Thus, he borrowed the imagery of the *Yijing* to discuss it, invariably employing the metaphors of ruler and minister to distinguish inner and outer. He narrated the hexagrams *Kan* and *Li*, directly pointing to the eternal lead, arranging *Qian* and *Kun* to establish the measure of the crucible. He illuminated the father and mother, linking them to beginning and end, uniting them as husband and wife to constrain their intercourse. He compared them to male and female, manifesting their generative power, analyzing them into yin and yang, and demonstrating their cyclical reversal through the dark and new moons. He coordinated them with the ascent and descent of the Dipper’s handle, aligning them with the cycles of the stars, dividing them by dawn and dusk, and harmonizing them with the clepsydra’s marks.

Thus, he took *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible, yin and yang as its embankments, water and fire as the mechanism of transformation, the Five Agents as auxiliaries, true lead as the progenitor of the medicine, and the Mysterious Essence as the foundation of the elixir. *Kan* and *Li* became husband and wife, Heaven and Earth father and mother. The eight trigrams were deployed, the four seasons driven, the 384 lines of the hexagrams divided, and the fire phases circulated. The five planets and twenty-eight constellations were arrayed within the crucible, whereupon the Water Tiger lay concealed, its form lodged in *geng* and *xin*, turning toward the west; the Fire Dragon lay hidden, its body following *jia* and *yi*, revolving toward the east.

The *Yijing* states: "The sage, perceiving the intricacies of the world, models them after their forms and images, symbolizing their proper affairs." Boyang thus drew upon these images. Who but one of the utmost penetration could partake in this? He cleaved open the primordial chaos, split asunder the vast primeval mist, directly pointing to the numinous root of Heaven and Earth, designating it as the progenitor of the medicine. He clearly beheld the sagely mother of yin and yang, employing her as the foundation of the elixir. He revealed the origin of the One Qi’s transformations, disclosing the fundamental workings of the Great Foundry’s generation. Who but one of the utmost attainment could partake in this?

At times, he fixed the clepsydra’s marks, divided the solar terms, gathered yin and yang, and hastened the spirits and demons. He compressed the 3,600 breaths of the true qi, revolved the seventy-two seasonal nodes, and activated the sixty-four hexagrams’ tally of yin. The Celestial Pivot was in his grasp, the twenty-four solar terms’ fire of yang drummed at his command. The axis of Earth obeyed his heart. Heaven and Earth could not conceal the mechanism of creation; yin and yang could not hide the root of nurturance. Thus, the numinous transformations knew no bounds, and the generation of the pure and perfect was achieved. Who but one of the utmost clarity could partake in this?

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Within the primordial crucible of chaos, black and white align.
The Dragon Horse descends its essence; the Doe and Buck conjoin their qi.
Like frost on horse’s teeth, like jade in a dog’s maw,
Quicksilver dwells with the Maiden, cinnabar with the Infant—
Their forms distinct, the medicine’s essence finely revealed,
The elixir’s shape fully perfected, its latent workings manifest,
The signs of the unmanifest made plain."*

Who but one of the utmost sincerity could partake in this?

At times, he borrowed the imagery of the lines, embedding comparisons within events, yet dared not divulge the celestial mechanism, nor conceal the arcane principles. Thus, he unfolded his exposition without cease, elaborating repeatedly, unable to desist, and so completed the scroll. His aim was to expound the essential Dao, to guide posterity, and to spare the embodied beings of the world from becoming mere yin demons. Who but one of the utmost benevolence could partake in this?

Moreover, there are those who attain the Three Lights’ pervasive virtue, roam the Eight Extremes, ingest golden sand to transform their forms, and consume fiery mercury to refine their essence and spirit. Thus, their bodies become purely yang, their spirits dwell in the true abode, the Three Corpses are cast off, the Three Realms transcended, and they ascend to the Upper Clarity as Perfected Immortals. Who but one of the utmost refinement could partake in this?

Xiao’s division of the *Cantong Qi* into chapters and meanings was based on the principle of borrowing and metaphor. The text lacks consistent structure, its words diffuse yet its Dao correct, its affairs manifest yet its language obscure. Later generations debated it, each adopting their own perspective: some divided characters for discussion, others combined sentences for annotation. Thus, divergent streams arose, and beauty and ugliness proliferated. Those who sought to study it found it difficult to attain clarity. Since the debates over beginning and end differed, and choices led to undetermined right and wrong, I have now divided it into chapters and fixed its sentences, ensuring that the principles cohere and the meanings align with the text. I hope this will aid those in the alchemical tradition.

The four chapters are thus organized into two fascicles, comprising ninety chapters. Yin and yang are divided into nine sections, titled *Fenzhang Tongzhiyi*. The main text is written in red, while subsidiary meanings are in black, making them clearly visible.

The upper fascicle contains forty chapters, the middle fascicle thirty-eight, and the lower fascicle twelve. Within it is the *Song of the Crucible*, whose words and principles are interlinked, its phrases fragmented, making chapter division impossible; thus, it is preserved intact to correspond to the number of Water One, symbolizing the completeness of the elixir’s yin-yang numerology.

Furthermore, following the *Cantong Qi*, I have composed the *Mingjing Tujue* and appended it to the end of the lower fascicle, intending to further open the gateway to the *Cantong Qi*.

Xiao, having received transmission from his master for many years, devoted himself to it without concealment. This is called "completing the true meaning of the arcane text," and I humbly hope it may, in some small measure, be passed on to posterity.

*Preface by Peng Xiao, the True One of Flying Crane Mountain in Changli*
*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*
*Zhouyi Cantong Qi Tongzhen Yi, Fascicle One*
*Composed by Peng Xiao of Later Shu*

**Chapter One: Qian and Kun as the Gate of the Yijing**
*Qian* and *Kun* are the gate of the *Yijing*, the parents of all hexagrams. *Kan* and *Li* form their encompassing frame, turning the hub and aligning the axle. Before the Great Simplicity, the Great Void, and the Great Beginning, though they contained the utmost subtlety of emptiness, no signs had yet emerged. At the juncture of the Great Commencement, the Great Prime, and the Great Ultimate, there was the Primal Unity—chaos. Within it resided the essence of the True One, the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things. Once the One Qi took form, the Two Modes divided, and then there were *Qian* and *Kun*, yin and yang, the Three Powers and Five Agents, the myriad things and their manifold names.

Thus, pairing *Qian* and *Kun* as the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth, and moving yin and yang as the bellows-key of creation, *Qian* and *Kun* are established, and yin and yang course within them. Master Wei observed that refining the Golden Elixir of Returning Cinnabar shares the same path as creation, and so he borrowed the images of the *Yijing* to expound it. Without exception, all begin by gathering the primal qi of Heaven and Earth’s chaos and True Unity as their foundation, and take the essence of *Qian* and *Kun*’s subtle movements as their model. Following the numbers of *Kan*, *Li*, *Pi*, and *Tai*, they establish the dynamics of punishment and virtue, and seize the mechanism of yin-yang transformation to complete winter and summer. Yin arises after noon, and yang stirs at midnight; when movement begins, it starts with the yang nine, and when still, it follows the yin six—this is the great safeguard of elixir refinement.

Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the crucible and vessel, *Kan* and *Li* as their encompassing frame, water and fire as husband and wife, yin and yang as dragon and tiger, the Five Agents as the weft containing true essence, and the Three Powers as the warp gathering pure vitality. Cold comes and heat departs, circulating through the three hundred eighty-four lines; the hare rises and the crow sinks, ascending and descending over three hundred eighty-four days—all these transformations begin with the bodies of the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*.

Hence it is said: *Qian* and *Kun* are the gate of the *Yijing*, the parents of all hexagrams.

**Chapter Two: The Four Hexagrams of Yin and Yang as the Bellows-Key**
The four hexagrams of yin and yang serve as the bellows-key, covering and enveloping the Dao of yin and yang—like a craftsman wielding the marking line, holding the reins and bit, aligning the compass and square, and following the tracks to regulate the exterior by the center. Their numbers are recorded in the pitch-pipes and calendars, with monthly nodes of five and six, warp and weft serving the sun, combining to form sixty. Hard and soft have outer and inner aspects.

In refining the Golden Elixir of Returning Cinnabar, within the crucible lies the Golden Mother and the Flowery Pond, also called the Golden Womb and Spirit Chamber. Here, the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* serve as the crucible, medicine, and bellows-key—the pivot and bolt. "Covering and enveloping" means wrapping and enclosing. Thus, there are the yin crucible and yang furnace, the hard fire and soft tally, all following the sixty-four hexagrams in endless cycles, mutually employed. Within this, they move through the twenty-four solar terms, dividing the seventy-two pentads, compressing a year’s twelve months of qi into one month, and a month’s qi into a day and night’s twelve hours. They fix the water clock, divide the two watches, separate midnight and noon, align yin and yang, harmonize the dark and new moons, unite dragon and tiger, and accord with Heaven and Earth’s great numbers, matching the transformations of yin and yang. If control is not errant and movement not lost, then externally, the tally of yin and yang aligns, and internally, the bodies of dragon and tiger are born. Thus it is said: A skilled craftsman relies on the marking line without error; a capable charioteer holds the reins and bit without wavering, conforming to the compass, square, and tracks.

This metaphorically describes the adept’s regulation of fire times. The "five and six" of monthly nodes refer to thirty days; each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, totaling sixty. The four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are the parents of the medicine, the pivot and bolt of the crucible and vessel—though not part of the day-and-night count, the *Cantong qi* broadly encompasses them, combining to form sixty-four hexagrams. "Warp and weft serving the sun" means the hexagrams and lines serve as the warp of daily use, while the weft refers to the numbers of pitch-pipes and calendars. "Hard and soft have outer and inner aspects" means yang hardness and yin softness, with water and fire, metal and wood mutually serving as outer and inner.

**Chapter Three: At the New Moon, *Zhun* Takes Charge of Affairs**
At the new moon, *Zhun* takes charge of affairs; by dusk, *Meng* is to be guarded. Each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, used in sequence. All movements of yin and yang’s ascent and descent, the fire numbers, follow the hexagrams and lines. Each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, with affairs beginning with the two hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng*—*Zhun* at dawn, *Meng* at dusk—from which the sequence proceeds.

**Chapter Four: Before Reaching the Dark and Bright**
Before reaching the dark and bright, the end returns to the beginning. The celestial stems and branches serve as the measure; movement and stillness have early and late. "Before reaching" refers to the two hexagrams *Jiji* and *Weiji*; "dark and bright" refers to the dark and new moons, the alternation of yin and yang’s brightness and obscurity. "Celestial stems and branches as the measure; movement and stillness have early and late" means yang pertains to movement and yin to stillness. Within the twelve hours, early and late divide yin and yang’s ascent and descent, the fire numbers circulating endlessly, mutually employed.

**Chapter Five: Spring and Summer Rely on the Inner Body**
Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; autumn and winter attend to the outer use, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. The yang fire advances the tally from *zi* to *si*, where pure yang governs, and the inner yin seeks the outer yang. The yin tally retreats the fire from *wu* to *hai*, where pure yin governs, and the outer yang attaches to the inner yin. This is the principle of the inner and outer bodies, the pattern of flourishing and decline, beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*—all determined by the images of the lines.

**Chapter Six: Rewards and Punishments Correspond to Spring and Autumn**
Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dawn and dusk follow cold and heat. The line statements possess benevolence and righteousness, issuing joy and anger in accord with the seasons. Thus, they align with the four seasons and Five Agents, attaining their principle.

The qi of spring’s arising is called reward; the qi of autumn’s withering is called punishment. From *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* is spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* are summer—these are the yang fire times. *Wu*, *wei*, and *shen* are autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* are winter—these are the yin tally times. Within the twelve hours, they move the fire tally, corresponding to these four seasons, Five Agents, dawn and dusk, cold and heat, benevolence and righteousness, joy and anger. The line images do not err by even a hair’s breadth, hence it is said: "Within the crucible, the four seasons are unharmed; within the images, cold and heat are as one—thus the elixir is surely achieved."

An ancient song says:
*The sage seizes the intent of creation,*
*Grasping sun and moon, placing them in the furnace.*
*Gently stirring, the essence of Heaven and Earth rises,*
*Gathering yin and yang, the spirit-souls of sun and moon flee.*
*Whoever recognizes this is a true immortal—*
*Refine it, ingest it, and after a thousand days,*
*The body, free of yin, cannot die.*

Thus, in refining the Golden Elixir of Returning Cinnabar, if one does not model Heaven and Earth’s creation, following nature’s principles, there is no other way.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Establish Their Positions**
Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of *Qian* and *Kun*; "establishing positions" means arranging the positions of yin and yang’s pairing. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*. *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed abode—neither above nor below, neither constant nor hidden. Transforming within, they envelop the myriad things, serving as the warp and weft of the Dao.

"Heaven and Earth establish their positions" means the crucible of *Jiji* models *Qian* and *Kun*. "The *Yi* moves within them" means the tally of yin and yang, *Kan* and *Li*, and the fire circulate within. The crucible models *Qian* and *Kun*, and within it, the Golden Mother is placed to complete the Three Powers of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. "*Kan* and *Li*’s two functions have no fixed line positions" means externally, water and fire are applied, their movements and stillness unfixed, thus circulating through the six voids, coming and going, above and below without constant position. Sometimes hidden, sometimes manifest, sometimes used, sometimes latent, they become the source of transformation and the mother of generation and completion. Hence it is said: They serve as the warp and weft of the Dao.

**Chapter Eight: From Non-Being to Being**

**Chapter Eight: Governing Being with Non-Being**

The utility of vessels lies in their emptiness, thus advancing the waxing and waning of *Kan* and *Li* until they vanish. Non-being is the dragon; being is the tiger. Non-being is the yang *qi* of mercury; being is the yin essence of lead. Lead and mercury reside within the empty vessel yet cannot spontaneously generate transformation. Through the ascent and descent of *Kan* and *Li*, propelling the four seasons, generation and completion become manifest. This is the use of an empty vessel to govern being with non-being. The ancient text *Longhu Jing* states: "Being and non-being restrain each other. When the Vermilion Bird flames into emptiness, yin arises and yang retreats; when yang stirs, yin recedes. With each waxing and waning, *Kan* and *Li* vanish and reappear in accord with the seasons."

**Chapter Nine: Words Are Not Idly Spoken**

Words are not idly spoken; discourse does not arise in vain. Verification, evidence, and efficacy are examined; the numinous is inferred; the structure of characters is traced to their principles as proof. *Kan*’s *wu* is the essence of the moon; *Li*’s *si* is the radiance of the sun. Sun and moon form the *Yi*, with hardness and softness in balance. Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy their quadrant, all receiving the power of the central *wu* and *ji*.

The sage does not idly fabricate empty words to delude later generations. Thus, he cites the verification of sun and moon, infers the efficacy of the numinous, distinguishes hardness and softness, points to metal and water as metaphors for dragon and tiger, models the movement of yin and yang to gather essence, completes the work with the five soils, and achieves fruition in the four seasons. Thereby, green, red, white, and black circulate, all receiving the power of *wu* and *ji*. *Kan*’s *wu* moon-essence is the moon’s yin; *wu* is yang—thus yin contains yang, symbolizing metal born within water: the tiger. *Li*’s *si* sunlight is the sun’s yang; *si* is yin—thus yang contains yin, symbolizing mercury born within fire: the dragon. Therefore, in refining the elixir, one gathers the essence of sun and moon, unites the numinous *qi* of yin and yang, and when the cycle of stellar revolutions is complete, the work of yin and yang concludes, returning all merit to talent and virtue, and the spirit and essence are perfected. "Inferring the structure of characters" refers to the *Yi* character, which images the sun and moon.

**Chapter Ten: The *Yi* Is an Image**

The *Yi* is an image. No image is more luminously manifest than the sun and moon. Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives; converging like spokes at a hub, they revolve. Emerging and entering, rolling and unrolling, the *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines, each line extracting a tally. The tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams. From darkness to dawn, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth mate their essence; sun and moon mutually sustain. The male yang scatters its mystery; the female yin transforms into the Yellow Womb. Chaos intermingles, the root of authority is planted, the foundation is laid, and nurturing begins. The calyx congeals, spirit solidifies into form, and all creatures, even the wriggling and crawling, arise from this.

The *Yi* is an image, formed by the union of sun and moon. The Golden Elixir of Return likewise arises from the union of the sun and moon’s yin and yang essence and *qi*. Thus, the essence and *qi* of yin and yang emerge and enter, roll and unroll, circulating day and night in an endless cycle. Following the sixty-four hexagrams and their three hundred eighty-four lines, extracting tallies from each line, fire advances and retreats. When yin arrives, yang departs; when yang hides, yin acts. The *qi* of east and west intermingle; the sentiments of husband and wife harmonize. At this moment, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally; heaven and earth mate their essence; sun and moon unite their souls and spirits. The chaos is the spirit-chamber, imaging the egg, its two halves merging like chaos. Within chaos, the yang dragon and yin tiger bear and respond to each other’s *qi*, planting the root, nurturing the calyx, until spirit congeals into form, ultimately becoming a refined entity. Thus, within the crucible-chamber is a heaven and earth unto itself. All wriggling and crawling creatures arise from this. The male yang belongs to heaven and is mysterious; the female yin belongs to earth and is yellow. This is the mutual employment of the old yang and old yin, the father *Qian* and mother *Kun*, at the extreme of the fire tally’s reckoning. Thus, within a single crucible, the transformations are manifest, each clearly imaging heaven and earth’s movement, giving rise to the myriad entities. If the fire-timing is lost, the withdrawal and addition are excessive, cold and heat do not correspond, or advance and retreat are misaligned, then by what seasonal nodes will heaven and earth generate entities? By what yin and yang will they produce dragon and tiger?

**Chapter Eleven: Thus Confucius**

Thus Confucius praised the vast chaos, the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* pervading emptiness. Investigating antiquity, at the primal emperor’s time, the *Guan Ju* established the beginning. At the first marriage, *qi* intertwined, and the first year sprouted growth.

Confucius praised the *Yi*’s Dao, dividing *Qian* and *Kun* as the head of the myriad things, establishing *Xian* and *Heng* as the ancestors of husband and wife. Splitting the vast chaos, chiseling the chaos, he revealed the numinous form and communicated heaven and earth’s sentiments. Thus, the Dao of the five relationships—ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, male and female—was attained, and the mechanism of yin and yang’s great transformation was exhausted. *Qian* and *Kun* illuminated their pervading emptiness. Thus, Master Wei used the *Yi* as a metaphor to establish the crucible, moving the celestial mechanism to mate the forms of dragon and tiger and unite the bodies of husband and wife. Initially, there was no form or substance, as if within vast chaos. After the fire was kindled and the tally moved, the male and female essences intertwined. Thus, the mutual longing of the *Guan Ju*, the seeking of marriage, began at the fire’s inception, corresponding to the first year’s sprouting production. Day by day, month by month, the bodies of dragon and tiger were completed.

**Chapter Twelve: The Sage Does Not Arise in Vain**

The sage does not arise in vain. Observing earth, he manifests the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, flexes and extends, responding to the seasons. Thus, the *Yi* unites the heart of heaven.

The sage Fuxi, gazing above and below, determined the *Yi*’s images and numbers, knowing the sentiments of the myriad things. He bequeathed this to later generations so that the unenlightened might understand the apertures of heaven and earth, steal the essence of yin and yang, recognize the root of transformation, and discern the forms of tally and response. Generation and conquest, advance and retreat, flexing and extending—all are within grasp. Thus, it is said: The *Yi* unites the heart of heaven. Therefore, he established images, gathered the utmost essence, prepared the crucible and furnace, moved the fire tally, followed the clepsydra, practiced the hexagrams and lines, fixed the hours, and divided the seasonal nodes to exhaust the great reckoning of heaven and earth.

**Chapter Thirteen: The *Fu* Hexagram Establishes the Beginning**

When the *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning, the eldest son inherits the father’s body and founds the omen upon the mother. Waxing and waning respond to the bell and pitch-pipe; ascent and descent rely on the Dipper’s pivot. On the third day, dawn breaks, and *Zhen*’s *geng* receives from the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding* from above, the upper half level as a cord. On the fifteenth, the *gan* body is fully replete. At *jia* in the east, the toad and hare’s essences—sun and moon’s *qi*—shine together. The toad observes the hexagram’s nodes; the hare’s essence emits light, generating seven or eight lines before bending, lowering, and descending.

When the *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning, the eldest son inherits the father’s body and founds the omen upon the mother: the six yin lines below first transform into one yang line, forming the *Fu* hexagram. Thus, it is called "establishing the beginning." This refers to the *Kun* hexagram’s lower line transforming into a *Qian* line, its inner body becoming *Zhen*. *Kun* is *Zhen*’s pregnant mother, thus it is called "founding the omen."

*Zhen* is the eldest son of *Qian*, and from this, it gradually transforms with time until the fifteenth day, when it becomes pure *Qian*—the father. Thus it is said to "inherit the father’s body." This is also like the moon, which appears as a crescent on the third day and by the eighth day forms the upper half-moon, its yang number reaching half—an analogy for the cauldron’s metal and wood being evenly matched. By the fifteenth day, it is full and round, emerging in the east, where the toad and hare’s essences—sun and moon’s *qi*—shine together, an analogy for the cauldron’s metal and water reaching fullness through the proper firing.

Master Wei employs this hexagram’s imagery to illustrate the moon’s waxing: he condenses the half-month’s three *hou* into half a day’s six *chen*, advancing the yang fire and drawing forth the additions within the cauldron, where it receives the fire’s tally and undergoes these transformations, foreshadowing the sprouting. "Seven or eight lines having formed" refers to the fifteenth day, when the *Qian* body is fully realized. "Bending, lowering, and descending" refers to the subsequent text, where after the sixteenth day, the yang fire retreats and the yin tally is employed.

**Sixteenth Turning Receives the Mandate, Chapter Fourteen**
The sixteenth turning receives the mandate: at *xin*, dawn appears; *gen* aligns with the south at *bing*; the lower half-moon is on the twenty-third; *Kun* at *yi* on the thirtieth day in the northeast loses its light, its nodes exhausted, and the succession returns to the father’s body, the dragon reborn.

"The sixteenth turning receives the mandate" refers to the sixteenth day onward, when the yang fire first retreats and the yin tally begins to arise. "At *xin*, dawn appears" is like the initial advance of the yang fire, akin to the moon’s appearance on the third day. The lower half-moon on the twenty-third is analogous to the upper half-moon, with metal and water evenly matched. "*Kun* at *yi* on the thirtieth day in the northeast loses its light" signifies the yin tally’s complete dissolution and the yang fire’s exhaustion. Since within a month yin and yang are evenly divided, they succeed one another, just as water and fire mutually require. Once a month concludes, it reverts to the beginning, again employing the *Fu* hexagram to initiate the cycle. Thus it is said, "the father’s body, the dragon, is reborn."

**Ren and Gui Pair with Jia and Yi, Chapter Fifteen**
*Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end. Seven and eight, nine and six likewise correspond; the four combine to make thirty. The yang *qi* wanes and vanishes, the eight trigrams array their luminaries, and the revolutions proceed without losing the center.

*Ren* and *Gui* are yin; *Jia* and *Yi* are yang. Their pairing refers to the elixir mother within the *Qian* and *Kun* cauldron, receiving the *qi* of the yang dragon and yin tiger in union. Thus it is said, "*Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end." Seven and eight, nine and six combine to form the thirty days. Within these thirty days, seven and nine correspond to yang numbers, six and eight to yin numbers. *Qian* and *Kun* each claim half, and by the thirtieth day, both yin tally and yang fire are exhausted. Therefore, during the month’s firing cycle, one must follow the eight trigrams’ arrayed luminaries, revolving through *zi*, *wu*, east, and west, drawing forth and adding, ascending and descending, so that yin and yang unfold and contract, harmonizing metal and water. If the firing is mistimed, drought and flood disrupt the rhythm, undermining the principles of generation and completion, making it difficult to retain the dragon and tiger’s forms. Practitioners of the firing cycle must ponder this carefully.

**The Primal Essence’s Subtlety Defies Perception, Chapter Sixteen**
The primal essence is too subtle to behold; one infers its effects and verifies its signs. By observing its manifestations, one models its form, erects markers as standards, and divines auspices to determine fortune. Issuing commands in accord with the seasons, one must not miss the moment when lines shift.

Above, examine the *He Tu*’s patterns; below, recount the earth’s flowing forms. In the center, consult the human heart, aligning and assessing the Three Powers. When active, follow the hexagram’s nodes; when still, rely on the *tuan*’s words. Only after *Qian* and *Kun* are applied can the Way of heaven and earth be enacted—how could one not be cautious?

The "primal essence" is the cauldron’s divine spirit, the true essence, the primal *qi* of heaven and earth. Though it cannot be grasped or seen, it subtly follows the transformative mechanism, generating the myriad things. Being profound and elusive, one must infer its effects, verify its signs, and erect markers as standards. Issuing commands in response to celestial tallies, one gazes upward to observe the celestial patterns and downward to examine the earth’s principles, thereby uniting heaven and earth’s *hun* and *po*, harmonizing yin and yang’s contraction and expansion. Establishing the Three Powers, assessing fortune and misfortune, one follows the hexagrams’ images and the lines’ words, ordering ascent and descent by day and night. Thus *Qian* and *Kun* are at peace, husband and wife harmonize, dragon and tiger unite, and heaven and earth are ordered.

The foregoing discusses adhering to the clepsydra’s timing, circulating the fire tally, and clarifying the drawing forth and adding, advancing and retreating—each without missing the revolutions of the sun, moon, and stars. Only then does the cauldron’s interior, in accord with the four seasons, generate the myriad things’ divine essence. How could practitioners of the firing cycle not be cautious?

**The Governance’s Helm, Chapter Seventeen**
The governance’s helm: managing, sealing, and securing; opening, unfolding, and deploying the precious essentials. The *Kui*’s handle unifies the transformative net’s cords, the lines’ movements within foretell fortune or misfortune, while without, the five wefts arise, their interweaving and alignment responding to the times. When the four and seven fall into discord, the *Chen* and *Li* diverge, bowing and rising.

"The governance’s helm" refers to the practitioner of the fire tally’s sequential initiation. Once the metal is cast into the cauldron, one manages, seals, and secures it, ensuring tight closure. "Opening, unfolding, and deploying the precious" means the inner metal unfolds, its fluids flowing, with metal and water interdependent. Following the Dipper’s handle, one traverses the twelve *chen*, aligning the five planets among the four and seven (the four and seven being the twenty-eight lodges). If the weft’s signs are misaligned and the tally’s nodes do not correspond, fortune and misfortune arise from the lines’ movements, and the fire tally is lost in dawn and dusk. Thus, the outer five planets fall into disorder, and the inner five *qi* fail to harmonize. When the four and seven fall into discord, the encircling stars diverge, and the cauldron’s interior fails to generate. Though the outer fire moves, if the inner tally remains quiescent and unresponsive, the celestial *hun* and terrestrial *po* do not unite. Hence, the stars and planets fall into disorder, the sun and moon deviate, the four seasons lose their rhythm, and the myriad things fail to be produced—all due to the firing cycle’s mismanagement in summer and autumn, causing the cauldron’s interior to suffer irregular drought and flood.

**Wenchang Governs the Record, Chapter Eighteen**
Wenchang governs the record, interrogating and holding accountable the Three Ducal Ministers and the hundred officials, each overseeing their respective domains.

"Wenchang governs the record": the Dipper’s *Kui* bears the basket, and the six stars of Wenchang Palace are: first, the Supreme General; second, the Secondary General; third, the Noble Minister; fourth, the Controller of Destinies; fifth, the Controller of Emoluments; and sixth, the Controller of Calamities. The Three Ducal Ministers are the six stars beneath the *Kui*, paired two by two, called the Three Terraces, which govern the world. Above, they assist the Son of Heaven in ordering yin and yang and harmonizing the four seasons; below, they ensure the myriad things’ flourishing. They enable the ministers and grandees to fulfill their duties, just as the cauldron’s interior receives the *qi* of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, generating transformation.

When yin and yang fall into discord and the four seasons lose their measure, it is like the practitioner of the fire tally mismanaging the harmonization—hence the interrogation. The Golden Liquor’s Reverted Elixir’s secret lies entirely in the two characters "fire" and "tally," which govern its beginning and end. Though one may obtain the true tally, the true fire is difficult to attain—how could it be lightly discussed? Thus, Master Wei broadly employs analogies, fearing that later generations might become confused.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Sun Unites the Essence of the Five Phases**

The sun unites the essence of the Five Phases, while the moon receives the regulation of the Six Pitch Pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. From origin to end, the threads of survival and decay unfold: at times the ruler grows arrogant, overbearing, and transgresses the Dao; at times ministers turn treacherous and perverse, straying from the proper path. The waxing and waning of the *chen* and *wang* phases fall into discord, bringing misfortune and blame. Those who uphold the law reproach and interrogate the faults, leaving the ruler to bear the consequences.

"The sun unites the essence of the Five Phases" means that each month, once, it conjoins with the moon. "The moon receives the regulation of the Six Pitch Pipes" refers to the Metal and Water within the crucible, which each month receive half a month’s *qi* of the pitch pipes. (The twelve pitch pipes are divided between the sun and moon.) The sun, moon, and five planets weave their warp and weft to generate the myriad things—this is like the crucible receiving the *qi* of external yin and yang, the rise and fall of the *zi* and *wu* tally, and the circulation of the essence of the five planets, the union of the sun and moon’s purest essences. Fortune and misfortune follow one another; survival and decay continue in succession, cycling endlessly, beginning anew only to return to their end—this is the *kun* hexagram.

Its divine chamber, the yin essence, resides in the Central Palace, embodying the virtue of Earth and symbolizing the ruler. If the crucible responds internally but does not act independently, it is because the ruler’s arrogance causes tribute from the four directions to cease, while treacherous ministers cause the timing of the hours to err. The waxing and waning of the *chen* and *wang* phases, the loss of the new and full moons, the blight of the dark and crescent—all faults are attributed to the ruler. The ruler is the Metal essence and Earth virtue, the divine chamber; the ministers are the essence of the Five Phases, the Six Pitch Pipes, and the *qi*; the gains and losses belong to the practitioner of the fire tally.

Thus, the maiden flees, the Crimson Dragon bolts, and the divine essence departs—what then remains of the Golden Liquor to seek?

**Chapter Twenty: The Celestial Pole Receives the Correct Alignment**

The Celestial Pole receives the correct alignment, moving leisurely and entrusting matters below. The Hall of Light enacts governance, and the state suffers no harm. Within, one nurtures the self, abiding in tranquility and emptiness, returning to the origin and tracing back to the primordial radiance. The inner illumination shines upon the body; the *dui* is sealed and fortified, the numinous root stabilized. The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, and the Pearl of the *zi* is nurtured. Though unseen, it is near and easily sought.

"The Celestial Pole receives the correct alignment, moving leisurely and entrusting matters below" means the divine embryo resides in the Central Palace, like the ruler abiding in the Hall of Light, akin to the North Star. The *qi* of yin, yang, and the Five Phases are the ministers. When ruler and ministers govern within as the North Star aligns at the center of heaven, the *qi* of yin, yang, and the Five Phases harmonize, the fluids of Metal and Water in the crucible chamber flourish, and the ruler nurtures the self in tranquility, entrusting to the spontaneous transformations of emptiness.

"Returning to the origin and tracing back to the primordial radiance, the inner illumination shines upon the body" refers to Metal’s ability to conceal brilliance and yet, by reflecting light, grow ever more luminous when fired. "Sealing the *dui*" means the *dui* opening—once the Golden Tiger’s numinous root is stabilized in the Central Palace, the crucible’s mouth must be firmly sealed. The true essence of the Three Luminaries is then drawn inward to nourish the Pearl of the *zi* and the numinous mercury—hence "the Three Luminaries sink into obscurity."

The Three Luminaries are the yang fire, the yin tally, and the Metal embryo, symbolizing the sun, moon, and stars. Externally, there are also Three Luminaries, distributed within the moments of movement and stillness, the exchanges of yin and yang, and the transformations of tally and fire—thus they are formed. Since both inner and outer possess the bodies of yin-yang transformation, their subtleties cannot be fully expounded here. At this stage, the mysteries are such that they can only be transmitted orally, not committed to writing.

When Metal and mercury transform within the crucible, their changes are unfathomable, beyond scrutiny. Yet if the celestial mechanism is employed to regulate and restrain them, aligning with the pivot of the cosmic pattern, then Metal and mercury dare not flee, and Dragon and Tiger achieve union—hence "near and easily sought." As the *Yin Fu Jing* states: "The cosmos is in the hand; the ten thousand transformations arise from the body."

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Yellow Center Gradually Penetrates Principle**

The Yellow Center gradually penetrates principle, moistening and reaching the skin and flesh. At first, it is upright; in the end, it is cultivated. The trunk stands, the branches take form—yet one may grasp it only to conceal it from the world, so none may know.

As the *Yi Jing* states: "The noble person, with the Yellow Center penetrating principle, abides in correct position within the body. Beauty resides within and flows to the four limbs, manifesting in affairs—this is the utmost beauty." This speaks of the Metal Tiger within the crucible, initially receiving the external yin and yang essences, gradually moistening the skin and flesh. Once it first receives qi, the sprout begins to grow; the branches and trunk are set upright, and in the end, the fruit is formed. It is an analogy for true Mercury of Metal Sand first sprouting buds.

The "one" is Water. As the Water Root and true Metal reside within the vessel, firmly sealed and concealed, ordinary people cannot know it.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Supreme Virtue Acts Without Striving**

Supreme virtue acts without striving, not seeking through scrutiny. Inferior virtue acts, its function unceasing. When the upper is closed, it is called "having"; when the lower is closed, it is called "lacking." The lacking serves the having; above, the spirit-virtue resides. These two apertures emulate the Metal qi, each requiring the other.

"Supreme virtue" is Water above; "inferior virtue" is Fire below. Water and Fire conjoined—this is the meaning of Qian and Kun. Water above is ever still, acting without striving, abiding in yin, not seeking through scrutiny. Fire below is ever in motion, circulating through the twelve celestial stems, its function unceasing.

The "upper closed" is called "having"—the inner Water. The "lower closed" is called "lacking"—the outer Fire. The "lacking" serves the "having," for Fire circulates the qi of the four seasons and five phases to nourish the spirit-embryo. Thus it is said: "Above, the spirit-virtue resides." This refers to the spirit-embryo of Metal and Mercury. These two apertures emulate the Metal qi, each requiring the other—meaning the Water and Fire, the yin and yang qi, are interdependent, forming the divine medicine. There is no other path.

Master Wei expounds this chapter to clarify the great outline of the method and the direction of the divine medicine.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Knowing the White, Guarding the Black**

Know the white, guard the black—spiritual illumination will come of itself. The white is the essence of Metal; the black is the foundation of Water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named "one," the beginning of yin and yang. It contains the Yellow Sprout, the master of the five metals, the Northern River Chariot. Thus Lead is black without but holds golden radiance within—like a jade hidden beneath coarse cloth, a madman outwardly.

The white is Metal; the black is Water. Knowing the root of Metal and Water and using it as the foundation of the medicine, spiritual essence will naturally arise within the vessel. Thus it is said: "spiritual illumination will come of itself." White Metal is born of Water, becoming the divine vessel. The Water’s essence is unbroken, and the two natures of Metal and Water form the pivot of the Dao.

Water’s number is one—the beginning of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the five phases, and the ten thousand things. Water is one, Fire two, Wood three, Metal four, Earth five. "Containing the Yellow Sprout" refers to Metal and Water generating the Yellow Sprout. The "master of the five metals" is the Northern River Chariot. The River Chariot is Water and Fire—meaning the qi of Water and Fire circulate to generate the five phases.

Thus, "Lead is black without but holds golden radiance within" refers to unrefined Lead before it is transformed into White Metal, mixed within the ore. Outwardly black, it inwardly conceals golden radiance—like a madman wearing coarse cloth yet holding jade.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Metal is the Mother of Water**

Metal is the mother of Water; the mother nurtures the child within the womb. Water is the child of Metal; the child conceals itself within the mother’s womb. The true person’s subtlety is as if present, as if absent—now sinking, now floating in the great abyss. Retreating, they disperse, each guarding their own domain.

"Water is born of Metal; Metal is the mother of Water"—Metal gives birth to Water yet is nurtured in form by Water. Thus, "the mother nurtures the child within the womb." "Water is the child of Metal; the child conceals itself within the mother’s womb" refers to Black Lead transforming and residing in the West as the White Tiger, the Metal embryo. Water contains Metal yet hides its essence within the Metal’s womb—this is true Mercury.

"The true person’s subtlety, each guarding their domain" refers to true Mercury, driven by the external tally-fire within the mother’s womb, now sinking, now floating, flying and hiding unpredictably—as if present, as if absent. Following the tally’s response, advancing and retreating, each guards its boundary and dares not transgress.

Master Wei expounds this chapter to deeply clarify the inner image—beyond the reach of seeing and hearing, the state of true essence’s elusive emergence and disappearance. How wondrous! How divine!

**Chapter Twenty-Five: Gathering the White Brilliance**

Gather the white brilliance, refine it into vermilion. Forging it forms an outer defense; the white within holds the true. Residing in a square or circle, an inch in diameter, they blend and restrain each other. Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted.

"Gather the white brilliance" refers to the initial movement, first taking White Metal as the foundation. "Refine it into vermilion" refers to the smelting process, next using blazing fire to form the red.

"Forging it forms an outer defense; the white within holds the true" means using White Metal as the divine chamber. "Residing in a square or circle, an inch in diameter, they blend and restrain each other" refers to the Metal embryo, shaped like the primordial chaos, crafted into upper and lower halves. The hollow center, square or round, an inch in diameter, holds the true Mercury. Once the two halves are joined, firmly sealed and impervious, yin and yang correspond without the slightest leak, nurturing the Dragon and Tiger. As the ancient song says: "Secure the navel-embryo without leakage; transformation occurs in an instant."

"Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted" refers to true Lead existing before the primordial chaos of Heaven and Earth. Lead obtains the One and first takes form; then Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the five phases, and the ten thousand things gradually arise. Thus Lead is the father and mother of Heaven and Earth, the root of yin and yang. The sage gathers the root of Heaven and Earth’s parents as the foundation of the great medicine, assembling the pure essence of yin and yang as the substance of the Returned Elixir—its creation far beyond that of ordinary things.

At the beginning of elixir refinement, the root of Heaven and Earth is taken as the medicine’s root, the mother of yin and yang as the elixir’s mother. If one cannot generate Heaven and Earth, yin and yang within, it is not the path of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir. If one uses substances produced after the existence of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang—such as the five metals, eight stones, plant ashes, morning dew, night frost, snowmelt, ice water, green salt, white brine, and various other things—how difficult would it be?

Those of like mind, ponder this deeply, and you will awaken. Thus, the later chapter says: "After ten thousand repetitions, the divine illumination may be glimpsed, or revealed to others."

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Beside the Walled Enclosure**

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Beside the Walled Enclosure**

Beside it stands a walled enclosure, shaped like Penglai’s fairy isle—encircling, sealed, yet open on all four sides. One lingers, guarding and defending, its defenses tight and firm, barring all that is wicked and perverse. Winding chambers connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen. Thus, one need not fret over hardship, nor weary the spirit and qi. When the chamber is full, none can retain it. He who guards it prospers; he who loses it perishes. In movement and stillness, rest and repose, it ever accompanies the practitioner.

In the refinement of the Returned Elixir, there are the altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth, stacked and joined as in the shape of Penglai. All around, the four directions are open. Within the crucible lies the divine chamber, the golden womb, its winding passages interconnected. Within it, too, are the pivot and bolt, firmly sealing and barring wickedness to prevent the true essence from escaping. Only then can stray thoughts be avoided, and weariness dispelled. Though the defenses are secure and the essence fills the chamber, one must still regulate and move yin and yang, alternating their functions to retain and bind the true essence, bringing about transformation. If the fire-tally is misapplied, even with true essence within, it will still scatter and flee. All depends on harmonizing water and fire, guarding without lapse—only then can one surely flourish. Thus, the true essence’s movement and stillness, rest and repose, ever accompany the practitioner.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Errors of Misguided Practices**

Those who practice misguided methods turn their gaze inward, lost in thought, pacing the steps of the Dipper and the lunar mansions, tracking the six jia stems by day and the yin paths by night. They suppress the nine and the one, disrupting the primordial womb, swallowing qi, and making their intestines rumble. They expel the upright and inhale external perversities, dividing day and night between waking and sleep, never resting. Their bodies grow daily weary, their minds confused, as if deranged. Their hundred vessels boil and surge, never settling into clarity. They dwell in earthen huts, erect altars, and morning and evening pay homage, offering sacrifices to spirits and demons. When they glimpse forms or hear voices in dreams, their hearts stir with emotion, their minds rejoice, believing their years will surely be prolonged. Yet suddenly, their allotted span ends, their bodies decay, and their bones lie exposed. In all their actions, they err and rebel, losing the pivot of the Dao. Such arts are many—thousands, even tens of thousands—yet all deviate from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and turning, straying into the Nine Dark Realms.

The "twisting and turning, straying into the Nine Dark Realms" refers to the Master Wei’s admonition that people, failing to grasp the fundamental principle of the Great Dao, pursue the crooked paths of side doors. Thus, they engage in petty inner contemplations, tread the steps of the Dipper and the lunar mansions, and track the six jia stems and celestial stems—mere childish defenses, the first steps of deviation.

There are also those who practice the arts of "facing the scene and receiving qi," the techniques of the bedchamber—bending and stretching, grasping and sealing, holding the breath and swallowing saliva. From this, their qi becomes disordered, their spirit exhausted, their hun damaged, and their po withered. The yang spirit flees the palace, and yin thieves plunder the lungs and liver. Within and without, they assail each other; at yin and shen hours, they press upon one another. The seven po wander to the gates of death, the three corpses wage war in the eyes. The hundred vessels boil, the three fields collapse into chaos. They sought eternal life but instead harmed their own. How could they ever attain clarity?

Others erect altars and platforms, offering sacrifices to licentious spirits and demons, hoping to encounter the Dao and beg for extended years. Thus, demonic qi invades their essence and po, and perverse winds arise in their hearts. In dreams, they commune; in waking, they see forms and hear voices, believing longevity is within reach. Yet they do not realize that their fate lies in their own hands—thus, their allotted span shortens, and their bodies decay. Such practices are manifold, all left-handed paths. The more they strive, the more they stagnate; the faster they seek, the slower they progress. They rebel against the true, deviate from the correct, and violate heavenly principles. Falsely claiming to be high Daoists, they openly defy the Yellow Emperor’s texts and obscure the true canon, utterly losing Laozi’s safeguards. Thus, the Master Wei wished to steer people away from side doors, guiding them directly into the true Dao. Though misguided practices may yield minor achievements, in the end, none can escape death and decay. Only the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir, once ingested, reverses aging and restores youth. One attains the rank of True Person, sharing the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.

Thus, the following text states:
When golden sand enters the five viscera,
Mist scatters like wind and rain.
Its fragrance steams and reaches the four limbs,
The complexion becomes radiant and lustrous.
White hair turns black again,
New teeth sprout where old ones fell.
The old man regains his youth,
The aged woman becomes a maiden fair.
Transformed, they escape the world’s calamities,
And are called True Persons.

The *Huangting Jing* also says:
At one hundred and twenty years, one may still return.
Beyond this, cultivating the Dao is truly difficult.
Though one awaits the nine transformations and the eight jade elixirs,
The essence of the sun and moon,
To rescue the old and infirm,
One knows this method is the supreme path of ascending to Heaven in broad daylight.
This is now made clear.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Enlightened Examine Their Defenses**

The enlightened examine their defenses and, perceiving the path clearly, practice diligently, day and night without rest. After ingesting the elixir for three years, they become light and soar afar. They tread fire without scorching, enter water without wetting. They can appear and disappear at will, ever joyful and free from care. The Dao is accomplished, virtue perfected. They conceal themselves, awaiting the time when the Great One summons them to dwell in the Central Land. When their merit is complete, they ascend, receiving the registers and charts.

The Master Wei warns those who pursue the Dao: examine and investigate your defenses, and you will suddenly awaken. Once attained, practice diligently day and night, never slackening from beginning to end. After the elixir is formed and ingested for three years, you will become light and travel afar, unharmed by water or fire. You may sit or stand, appear or vanish, secretly perform virtuous deeds, and conceal yourself, awaiting the time. When the Great One summons you, you will move to the Central Land. Counting the days, you will ascend, receiving the registers and charts.

The Great One is the overseer of elixir refinement. The Central Land is the Divine Land. When mortals first attain the Dao, their names are engraved on golden tablets in this land, and they receive the charts and registers, only then ascending.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Fire Record Is Not Falsely Composed**

The Fire Record elucidates the days to clarify the matter. The crescent-moon crucible and furnace use the White Tiger as the pivot for refinement, mercury as the flowing pearl. The Green Dragon accompanies it, rising in the east to join the west. Hun and po naturally bind each other. Above, the trigram *dui* governs the number eight; below, the trigram *gen* also governs eight. The two eights combine their essence, and the forms of Qian and Kun are completed. Two eights make one catty, the correct measure of the Dao, never tilting. A catty has three hundred and eighty-four zhu, corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines. Though the Fire Record exists, one must follow the Dao of the *Yijing*, moving through the hexagrams, cycling through *pi* and *tai*. The crescent-moon vessel is the upturned moon. The Metal Tiger within serves as the pivot of the medicine. Vermilion mercury and the Green Dragon are pursued by the Cinnabar Bird of bing and ding, all entering the golden womb—thus, it is called "rising in the east to join the west." Hun and po refer to the eastern dragon’s hun and the western tiger’s po. The upper and lower eights combine to form one catty, divided into three hundred and eighty-four zhu, corresponding to the two eights of a month’s cycle. Then, the forms of Qian and Kun are both completed, matching the number of one celestial revolution.

**Chapter Thirty: Gold Enters the Fierce Fire**

When gold enters the fierce fire, its color does not fade, and its radiant essence remains. Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never waned in brightness. Gold does not lose its weight; the sun and moon retain their forms as ever. Gold is born from the moon, receiving the sun’s tally at the new moon. When gold returns to its mother, at the moon’s darkening, the sun and moon envelop each other, concealing their outlines. They sink into the cavernous void, and gold regains its original nature. Its majesty and radiance play within the crucible.

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Five Phases Overcome Each Other**

The five phases overcome one another—fire overcomes metal, yet when metal meets fire, it is wrought into vessels, neither harmed nor diminished. Thus, the golden embryo abides within the crucible without dissipation, its luster growing ever more radiant. Since the crucible and vessel were established with Qian and Kun, the sun and moon have poured their essence inward, each benefiting the other, both gaining luminous clarity. The weight of gold remains as before; the sun and moon perpetually encircle and illuminate.

That gold is born from the moon means gold is the essence of yin, dwelling in the west—hence it is said to arise from the moon. The moon, at the new moon, receives the tally of the sun’s celestial stems, thereby generating gold. That gold returns to its mother means the moon’s governance shifts, and gold reverts to water. When the moon wanes and yang qi is wholly spent, the two substances—gold and water—naturally envelop each other, concealing their outlines and sinking into the cavernous void.

The dark of the moon mirrors the year’s end; the new moon, its beginning. When gold and water take form within the crucible’s chamber, they perpetually contain harmonious qi, and success is manifest. Thus it is said, “the crucible rejoices.” Rejoicing is harmony; harmony is joy. When gold and water congeal, the natural Dao is complete.

---

**Chapter Thirty-One (continued): The Union of Zi and Wu Numbers**

The union of zi and wu numbers forms three. Wu and ji are called the five and three. When the five and three harmonize, the eight minerals serve as the proper guiding principle. Breath intermingles and nurtures, awaiting the union of husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal; flowing pearl, the child of water. Water relies on earth as its embankment; earth restrains water from rising. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat. When water prevails, fire is extinguished; when both perish, they return to the fertile earth. Once the three natures unite, they guard their original essence and share a common ancestor.

The number of zi (water) is one; the number of wu (fire) is two. Together they form three. Wu and ji (earth) number five. Three and five combine to make eight—thus, when the three and five harmonize, the eight minerals serve as the proper guiding principle. Hence, the Azure Dragon exhales, the White Tiger inhales; the White Tiger inhales, the Azure Dragon exhales. Their breath intermingles and nurtures, awaiting the union of husband and wife.

That yellow earth is the father of metal and flowing pearl the child of water means earth can restrain mercury, preventing its dispersal—this is the phase of earth governing the late season of each quarter. Metal is wholly dependent on the Vermilion Bird, the spirit of fire, to harmonize victory and defeat. When water prevails, fire is extinguished; at the dark and new moons, both conclude their cycles, their merit returning to earth’s virtue.

That the three natures unite to guard their original essence and share a common ancestor means metal and fire arise from the number one within water’s qi. This originates in the primordial chaos before heaven and earth, from which the five phases are born—not merely from gold and water alone.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Sesame Extends Longevity**

Sesame extends longevity; returning cinnabar may be ingested. Gold’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things. When adepts consume it, their lifespans lengthen. Earth traverses the four seasons, guarding its boundaries with fixed rules. When golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and rain. Through steaming and permeation, it reaches the four limbs. The complexion becomes joyful and lustrous; white hair turns black again. Fallen teeth regrow in their original sockets. The old man regains youthful vigor; the aged woman becomes a maiden. Their forms are transformed, and they escape worldly calamities—such are called Perfected Ones.

Sesame is foreign hemp; those who eat it may yet extend their years—how much more so the golden liquid of returning cinnabar? Returning cinnabar first arises from true gold, whose body is indestructible. This true gold is the ancestor of heaven and earth’s primordial qi, the mother of all things. As the *Daodejing* says: “Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.” Before heaven and earth, the singular qi was the origin, giving birth to all phenomena. Gold is the root of water and serves as the foundation of the elixir—thus, the true gold mother produces golden sand, forming returning cinnabar.

Earth traversing the four seasons marks the beginning and end of the elixir path. Master Wei admonished later generations: the refinement and ingestion of this sand differ from ordinary medicines. When this sand enters the mouth, it is like clouds, mist, wind, and rain penetrating the five viscera and four limbs, restoring youth, reversing aging, regenerating hair, and regrowing teeth. Longevity is attained, and one gazes afar.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Lead Carbonate in the Fire**

When lead carbonate is cast into fire, its color is ruined and it reverts to lead. Ice and snow, when warmed by hot water, dissolve into primordial water. Gold takes sand as its essence, receiving harmony from mercury. Its transformations arise from authenticity, beginning and ending in mutual dependence. To concoct an immortal’s ingestible elixir, one must use substances of the same kind—just as planting grain requires millet, and hatching a chick requires an egg. With the aid of their kind, natural things form easily. Can fish eyes become pearls? Can mugwort become sandalwood? Substances of the same kind follow one another; those that diverge cannot form treasures. Thus, swallows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward.

Lead carbonate is refined from black lead; when cast into fire, it reverts to lead. Ice and snow form from water’s qi; when warmed by water, they return to water. Gold sand and mercury are of one body—gold as mother produces sand and mercury. Thus, planting grain requires millet; hatching a chick requires an egg. Once they receive sufficient qi, a chick or grain is formed. This is the natural Dao of mutual generation, beginning and ending in dependence.

If one mistakenly uses minerals, plants, frost, dew, ice, snow, salt, or brine—all such substances are misapplied, as explained in the preceding commentary. One must take the root of heaven and earth as the elixir’s root, true gold as the elixir’s mother, to produce yin and yang’s essence—golden sand and numinous mercury—as the medicine of longevity. Is this not so?

Thus, swallows do not give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Fire’s nature is to flame upward; it cannot be made to moisten downward. Water’s nature is to moisten downward; it cannot be made to flame upward. Proceeding from the root of natural essence, it is evident that the gold mother produces golden sand.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: Many Scholars in the World**

Many scholars in the world possess lofty talent and refined skill, yet by chance they do not meet one another. They waste fire and squander wealth, relying on texts and following their own interpretations. Their methods lack foundation; their measures and controls are lost. They pound and refine malachite, mica, alum, magnetite, sulfur, and camphorwood clay, smelting and flying them with the five minerals. Copper serves as their auxiliary pivot. The natures of these substances differ—how could they willingly unite? In a thousand attempts, ten thousand failures ensue. What they seek turns to folly; luck never favors them. Only the sage knows this.

From youth to white-haired age, they persist halfway, harboring doubts. They turn from the Dao, clinging to delusion, stepping from the correct path into deviant byways. Peering through a tube, their vision is narrow—how can they fathom what lies ahead?

Master Wei said: Many in the world are learned scholars who turn their minds to the Dao and seek the elixir through fire. By chance, they do not encounter a wise teacher, relying only on texts and oral instructions, arbitrarily following their own ideas. They waste wealth and pound miscellaneous medicines, hoping for longevity and transcendence. Years pass, their hair turns white, yet they cling stubbornly to their views, lost in narrow perspectives, straying into crooked paths. In a thousand attempts, ten thousand failures—how can they foresee the future? The natures of these substances differ, as explained in the preceding commentary.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: The Utmost Sage**

As for the utmost sages, they did not surpass Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them upon Heaven and Earth. King Wen, the ancestor of emperors, structured their forms and composed the line statements. Confucius, the most eminent of sages, added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three sovereigns, raised by Heaven, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their excellence varied in steps and measures, their virtue and power were not unequal. Their creations had their origins; their calculations and divisions were precise to the smallest weight. What has form is easy to ponder, but what leaves no trace is difficult to plan.

In their undertakings, what can now be followed was established for the world. The *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* had no prior knowledge to rely upon; they depended on teachers to awaken understanding. It is like lifting the curtain and gazing out, or closing the eyes and ascending a high tower.

Master Wei praised Fuxi, King Wen, and Confucius, the three sages: Heaven-endowed with divine intelligence, each possessed luminous virtue. In expounding the *Book of Changes*, they penetrated the feelings of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. In editing the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, they set forth the teachings of rulers, ministers, and the multitudes. Moreover, they established fixed line images, dividing and apportioning them with meticulous care, encompassing the cycles of the stars and exhausting the Great Dao. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot conceal the mechanisms of closure and opening. The utmost emptiness of yin and yang harbors the numbers of movement and stillness. Thus, the sages followed these principles to devise the Great Dao: using the images of Qian and Kun as the cauldron and chamber, they embraced the One and made it the ancestor of the ten thousand spirits; with yin and yang, they threaded the sundial’s shadow, enabling the six voids to generate the myriad things.

What is easy to ponder is Heaven and Earth; what is difficult to plan is yin and yang. If not for the three sages’ exposition of the *Book of Changes*, by what path could water and fire be deployed? If not for the texts bequeathed to ten thousand generations, by what gate could the dragon and tiger be controlled? Thus it is said: "Without prior knowledge, one must rely on this." If you lift the curtain, you see clearly; if you ascend the high tower, you still cannot fathom its limits. This is a metaphor for the sages’ Dao: the higher you look up to it, the loftier it becomes; the deeper you delve into it, the more solid it grows.

Following the Dao of the *Book of Changes*, we further clarify the *Fire Records*. The explanation of this will be briefly set forth below.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Six Hundred Chapters of the Fire Records**

The *Fire Records* comprise six hundred chapters, their principles no different from the written word. Yet, out of reverence for the world, people do not thoroughly ponder and trace their origins. The obscure and the manifest originally dwell together. I dare only speak of this to the worthy—how could I lightly commit it to writing? If I were to seal my lips and silence the Dao, I would incur the punishment of condemnation. Yet if I were to set forth my thoughts on bamboo and silk, I would fear leaking Heaven’s mechanism. Hesitating, I sigh, raising and lowering my head, weaving together my thoughts. There is a method to refining and forging, but it cannot be fully expounded. I shall briefly outline its essentials, and its branches will naturally become apparent.

The *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters represent the great number of the fire’s operation through the cycles of the stars. Morning and evening, each is assigned a hexagram, corresponding to affairs. The six hundred chapters follow the same sequence, so that years align with months, months with days, and days with hours. Master Wei dared neither seal his lips to conceal the Great Dao nor openly inscribe it on bamboo and silk to leak Heaven’s mechanism. Hesitating, he sighed deeply, fearing he might not reach posterity. Thus, he briefly outlined the essentials, revealing only a few branches and leaves. The remaining fine details are preserved in oral instructions.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Using Metal as a Dike**

Use metal as a dike, and water will enter to roam freely. The calculation for metal is fifteen, and the number for water is the same. When setting the furnace, fix the weights: five parts water, with a surplus of two—these are the true numbers. The metal’s weight remains as it was at the beginning. The third does not enter the fire but accompanies the two. The three substances mutually embrace, undergoing transformations like spirits. Below, the fire’s yang qi steams and seethes. In an instant, it first liquefies, then congeals, and is called the Yellow Chariot.

When months and years are about to end, nature is destroyed, lifespan is harmed, and the body becomes like ash and dust, resembling dust on a bright window. The Metal Mother resides in the Central Palace as quicksilver. The dike of metal and water allows them to roam freely, their natures and affections intertwined. Metal and water follow the celestial stems, each receiving half the qi, together making up one catty. Once the golden sand is produced, the mother is not diminished. Thus it is said: "The metal’s weight remains as it was at the beginning." The third that does not enter is true earth. Metal, fire, and wood are the three substances. Water and fire follow the celestial stems, entering the vessel together, where the three natures combine and the two flavors restrain each other, transforming like spirits.

The Metal Mother, steamed by the essence of the Great Yang, can then liquefy and congeal, becoming what is called the Yellow Chariot. When the cycles of the stars, yin and yang, and the Five Agents are complete, their functions are exhausted, and they retreat, concealing their forms and returning their achievements to the Central Palace. The Yellow Emperor’s virtue is earth. Thus it is said: nature is destroyed, lifespan is harmed, and one returns to the virtue of earth, transforming into earth. Then the spirit and body resemble dust on a bright window.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Pounding, Refining, and Combining**

In pounding, refining, and combining, hold fast and enter the Crimson Gate. Seal its borders tightly, ensuring it is complete and firm. Below, kindle the blazing fire, day and night, its sound steady and diligent. Begin with the civil, so it may be cultivated; end with the martial, so it may be displayed. Observe and inspect carefully, scrutinizing with utmost caution. Adjust the cold and warmth meticulously, cycling through the twelve nodes. When each node is exhausted, you must personally attend to the qi. When life is nearly severed and the body is on the verge of death, the hun and po change color, turning into a radiant purple. Thus is the Returned Elixir formed. Take a single pill, the size of a knife’s tip—it is most divine.

Once the foundation of the elixir is firmly established and securely sealed, place it within the cauldron, called the Crimson Gate. Above, water flows downward; below, fire blazes upward. From darkness to dawn, advance and retreat; day and night, ascend and descend. The civil begins at midnight, the martial follows until the hour of *si*. At noon, the yin tally arises, continuing until the hour of *hai*. Operate the cycles of closure and opening, adjusting with cold and warmth. When the twelve nodes are complete, the cycle begins anew. When the fire is sufficient, the hun and po transform, turning into radiant purple gold and forming the elixir. Ingesting a single grain, the size of a knife’s tip, yields wondrous and boundless efficacy.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Calculating the Numbers of the Five Agents**

Calculating the numbers of the Five Agents is concise and not cumbersome. Use water to stimulate fire, and suddenly its light is extinguished. The sun and moon mutually eclipse, always occurring between the last and first days of the lunar month. When water is abundant, Kan encroaches upon yang; when fire is weak, Li’s daylight dims. Yin and yang consume each other, their interaction the natural Dao.

The Five Agents are the essence of emptiness and nothingness, difficult to perceive. If one considers the total numbers of Heaven and Earth, none can escape their operation. Within the cauldron, the Five Agents naturally restrain each other, yin and yang intermingle, fire arises, and water recedes. Water stimulates fire to weaken, the sun’s spirit arises at dawn, and the moon’s essence ends at dusk. The feminine and masculine alternate, cinnabar and mercury generate each other. Heaven and Earth do so naturally, and the Dao of the elixir is thus illuminated.

---

**Chapter Forty: Names Define Essence**

Names define essence; words express nature. When metal returns to its original nature, the Returned Elixir is achieved. I dare not falsely imitate or emulate the sages’ writings. The ancient records speak of the Dragon and Tiger, the Yellow Emperor’s praise of Golden Florescence, Huainan’s refinement of autumn stone, and Wang Yang’s addition of the Yellow Sprout. The worthy can uphold and practice this; the unworthy should not partake. From ancient times to the present, the Dao has been one. In discourse, what is discussed is for scholars to exert themselves, to ponder deeply, and to reflect on what is most essential. The words are exceedingly clear and do not deceive me.

**Chapter Forty-One: Qian’s Firmness and Kun’s Softness**

Qian is firm; Kun is soft. Their union is all-embracing. Yang endows, yin receives; male and female depend on each other to generate the essence of creation. Then qi unfurls, Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading, their mystery profound—impossible to depict in diagrams. The sage measures and weighs, arranging in order the primal foundation. These four merge into primordial chaos, entering the realm of emptiness. The sixty hexagrams are spread like a chariot’s canopy, harnessed to the dragon-horse. When the enlightened ruler guides the times, harmony prevails, and the path follows smoothly, free from deviation. The crooked way is perilous, treacherous, and endangers the state.

In refining the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir, first establish the Qian-Kun Cauldron of *jiji*. Then unite yin and yang, merging their essence within. Next, circulate water and fire, Kan and Li, uniting sun and moon, Dragon and Tiger. Thus, the cauldron’s radiance shines brilliantly, its mystery impenetrable. This arises from the sage’s measured texts, the thorough search for the Elixir Mother, so that Qian and Kun, Li and Kan, blend and align. They traverse the Six Voids, unfurling the Five Qi, cycling through the sixty hexagrams, passing the twelve earthly branches, arrayed like a chariot to welcome the dragon-horse. Within lies the Golden Mother of the Central Palace, like a ruler governing the state, guiding the times with harmonious qi, following effortlessly in great accord. Thus, the path is level, without slope; all returns as it goes. But if fire is mismanaged, timing misjudged, the path becomes perilous, the state topples. The Golden Consort in the divine chamber finds no foothold, and the elixir fails to form.

The essence of the Golden Elixir lies entirely in the two words: lead and fire. Lead and fire are water and fire, the ancestors of return and reversal. The remaining Five Phases and seasonal qi merely assist in its completion. The Golden Consort is the Golden Mother.

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Noble One Dwells in His Chamber**

When the noble one dwells in his chamber and speaks with goodness, a thousand *li* away it is answered. This describes the ruler of ten thousand chariots, dwelling in the nine-fold chamber, issuing decrees and commands. He follows yin and yang, regulates the storage of qi, awaits the proper time, and does not transgress. The hexagrams and months: *Zhun* begins at *zi*, *Meng* at *shen*, *Dun* at *yin*, *Gu* at *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their appointed days.

The *Yijing* states: “When the noble one dwells in his chamber and speaks with goodness, a thousand *li* away it is answered.” This likens the Golden Elder residing in the divine chamber to a ruler enthroned in the nine-fold palace. In managing the morning and evening water and fire, he issues commands as if decreeing orders, ensuring all qi find their place. Yet he must remain tranquil and inactive, storing the vessel, awaiting the time, following the line texts, and observing the clepsydra’s marks—each detail carefully attended. *Zhun* and *Meng* correspond to morning and evening signs, meaning the sixty hexagrams align with a month’s cycle: day and night each receive one hexagram, cycling endlessly. *Yin* and *shen* mark the beginning and end of yin and yang.

**Chapter Forty-Three: Briefly Setting Forth the Two Images**

Briefly setting forth the two images, though unable to exhaust their depths, I establish principles and set punishments. To act with benevolence is virtuous; to oppose it is inauspicious; to follow it is auspicious. Consulting the calendar and decrees, one must be sincere, meticulous, and vigilant in observing the celestial stems and earthly branches, scrutinizing waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm.

The two images refer to water and fire, yin and yang. From *zi* to *si* belongs to spring and summer, the phase of fire, the season of growth. Contained within the vessel, it nurtures the spirit—this is the image of bestowing benevolence. From *wu* to *hai* belongs to autumn and winter, the phase of metal, the season of restraint. Descending into the womb, it coagulates the numinous mercury—this is the image of establishing principles and punishments. Master Wei enables later generations to understand the movements of the sun and moon, the rise and fall of yin and yang, following the hexagrams and lines, heeding the warnings of cold and heat. By being meticulous in observing waxing and waning, no regret arises within the cauldron, no thieves emerge from the images. Then red essence descends as qi, white mercury takes form, and the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is swiftly achieved.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The Two Solstices Alter Their Courses**

When the two solstices alter their courses, deviating and twisting, midwinter becomes scorching heat, midsummer brings frost and snow. At the two equinoxes, directions are awry, clepsydra marks misaligned; wind and rain lack moderation. Drought and flood contend, locusts surge and seethe, strange omens proliferate. Heaven displays its portents; mountains collapse, earth splits. The filial son’s concentrated mind moves the August Ultimate. Nearby, it spills from the mouth; afar, it flows to distant lands. Some invite misfortune, some bring fortune; some usher in great peace, some incite war. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intent.

The summer solstice, winter solstice, spring equinox, and autumn equinox—these four correspond to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* among the twelve earthly branches, dividing the four seasons’ boundaries. Additionally, the virtue of earth traverses the ends of the four seasons, giving rise to the forms of Dragon and Tiger, metal and wood. Not only do the four seasons serve as markers; within the twelve earthly branches, they further divide into twenty-four solar terms and seventy-two pentads, symbolizing the year’s qi and numbers.

If the clepsydra’s marks deviate by a hair’s breadth, the sun and moon lose their course; the new and full moons tilt, day and night unequal. If yang fire exceeds its measure, drought and flood disrupt harmony, and midwinter transforms into scorching heat. If yin tally loses its rhythm, cold and warmth clash, and midsummer reverts to heavy frost. Within the golden palace, cinnabar and mercury fail to sprout; in the cauldron, insects and worms arise instead. In great cases, mountains collapse and earth crumbles; the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon seethe. In minor cases, violent rain and fierce winds rage; the Kan Man and Li Woman flee in chaos. The Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon are the ethereal souls of east and west; the Kan Man and Li Woman are the husband and wife of south and north. When the filial son scatters, the true mercury in the womb is disrupted by erratic fire timing, flying away without restraint, causing the August Ultimate to burst from the cauldron’s mouth and flow to distant lands.

Some outcomes are auspicious, some inauspicious; some bring rise, some ruin. These four and the aforementioned transformations all stem from the heart of the fire-manager.

If one can align with the celestial mechanism, weigh the sun and moon, carefully harmonize, and sincerely execute the plan, summoning harmonious qi within the cauldron to produce pure essence, enabling the true sovereign in the womb to generate the purest Kun—this is called true mercury.

**Chapter 45: Constancy in Movement and Stillness**

Movement and stillness have their constancy—adhere to the carpenter’s line. Harmonize with the four seasons and align with qi, then hardness and softness are decisively determined, without mutual encroachment. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. Their transformations circulate freely, bending and stretching, returning and reversing. In all operations of water and fire, movement and stillness follow the proper timing, enabling the qi of Dragon and Tiger to mutually depend on each other, like mother and child, womb and longing. The Five Phases guard their boundaries; the four seasons circulate in turn, expanding and contracting without error or reversal. Thus, success is seen daily.

**Chapter 46: Between Dark and New Moon**

Between dark and new moon, the tally aligns, and the primordial chaos of Hong Meng commences. The female and male follow one another, their fluids moistening and nourishing, their transformations flowing and circulating. The spirits of heaven and earth cannot be measured. Utilizing this, one stabilizes the body, conceals the form, and stores the essence. It begins in the northeast, in the region of Jidou, then rotates rightward, spewing the wheel and spitting forth sprouts, hidden in the depths where images appear, scattering radiant essence.

Between dark and new moon lies the moment when Metal and Water tally—this is the time after dusk and before dawn. As the Yang tally retreats, Metal and Water share the same origin, thus the primordial chaos aligns, the female and male unite, flowing Metal moistens, and fluids nourish the womb, giving birth to spirits beyond measure. It can stabilize the body, conceal the form, store the essence, and hide the substance. As essence gradually emerges in the northeast, rotating rightward, it encounters the new moon and revives, beginning again at Jidou, turning toward the west. The wheel spews forth sprouts, gradually brightening, though still within the hidden Yin. It prepares to restore its former fullness, thus in the northeast, the Gen region, it follows the position of inception and completion, the movement of the hidden Dragon.

This is like when the tally operates between Xu and Hai, and within the cauldron, Metal and Water resemble the approach of dark and new moon. As the Zi tally arises, it is not far from the Gen position and the Mao hour, hence it is called "spewing the wheel and spitting forth sprouts." Just as the Metal Mother, between dark and new moon, Metal and Water flourish, when the month begins and the Zi tally’s solitary Yang fire meets Metal, it rotates leftward, spitting forth sprouts and gradually forming the Dragon’s body. Thus, the following text states: "Gradual transformation in prosperity and decline ultimately returns to the beginning."

**Chapter 47: Above Mao and Bi**

Above Mao and Bi, Zhen emerges as evidence. Yang qi begins its inception. In the *Nine Ones*, the Dragon lies hidden; Yang is established by three, Yin by eight. Thus, on the third day, Zhen moves; on the eighth day, Dui proceeds. In the *Nine Twos*, the Dragon appears, peaceful and luminous. When the virtues of three and five are complete, the Qian body is formed. In the *Nine Threes*, vigilance at dusk suffers loss, and the divine tally waxes and wanes, gradually transforming until it returns to the beginning. Xun continues its lineage, consolidating and upholding. In the *Nine Fours*, leaping or retreating, the Way is perilous. Gen governs advance and retreat, not overstepping its time—twenty-three days guard the appointed period. In the *Nine Fives*, the Dragon soars to the celestial position, adding joy. In the *Six Fives*, Kun bears and binds, encompassing beginning and end, nurturing all offspring as the eternal mother. In the *Nine Sixes*, the Dragon ascends to excess, battling virtue in the wild. Using the Nine, it flutters as the Dao’s compass and square. When Yang’s numbers are exhausted, they turn and unite once more.

"Above Mao and Bi, Zhen emerges as evidence" refers to the moon’s initial appearance in the west, above Mao and Bi, where the Yang fire proceeds. By Zi and Chou, it begins the cycle of qi, moving five days per revolution. From this, a single Yang line is born, and Zhen qi stirs, initiating growth within the cauldron. Thus, Yang qi gradually arises, and after three times five, fifteen days, the pure Qian is formed, its body complete.

"Yang is established by three" means the fire moves for three days, and within the cauldron, Yang qi first spreads, hence "on the third day, Zhen moves." "Yin is connected by eight" means after two encounters, two Yang lines arise. By the eighth day, Dui Metal is activated, and the qi of Metal and Water pauses, belonging to the upper trigram. Metal and Water connect, hence "on the eighth day, Dui proceeds."

"In the *Nine Twos*, the Dragon appears, peaceful and luminous" refers to the moon reaching its upper trigram, half-formed. This is like the cauldron’s Metal and Water receiving the tally of Yin and Mao, with Yin and Yang each at half. "When the virtues of three and five are complete" refers to the *Nine Threes*, where Qian operates until Chen and Si, precisely three encounters, totaling fifteen days. The three lines are entirely Yang, and the Qian body is complete. Thereafter, Yin and Yang are divided, hence it is said: "Gradual transformation in prosperity and decline ultimately returns to the beginning," cycling endlessly.

"Xun continues the Yin lineage" refers to the Yang line retreating and transforming into a single Yin line. Xun thus inherits the Yin tally, moving for five days above Wu and Wei. The soft line gradually advances, Yin qi begins to encircle, enveloping Yang essence without daring to move. After four encounters are complete, two Yin lines are born. Gen moves for five encounters, and the tally reaches Shen and You, meeting the lower trigram—twenty-three days when Metal and Water are again balanced.

"In the *Nine Fives*, the Dragon soars to the celestial position, adding joy" refers to the six encounters, thirty days, when Kun operates the Yin tally until Xu and Hai. The qi of Qian and Kun are both complete, and the numbers of Dragon and Tiger, Yin and Yang, and the myriad things cycle through, hence "the *Nine Fives* add joy."

"In the *Six Fives*, Kun bears and binds, encompassing beginning and end, nurturing all offspring as the eternal mother" refers to Kun initially changing one line into Yang, forming Zhen as the eldest son of the Qian household. As all three lines change into pure Yang, Qian is formed. When Yang reaches its peak, Yin is born, and within the Qian body, one line changes into Yin, forming Xun as the eldest daughter of the Kun household. As all three lines change into pure Yin, Kun is formed. From beginning to end, emergence and concealment all proceed from Kun’s body, nurturing the myriad things as the eternal mother. All offspring are the various hexagrams. Thus, the *Six Fives* of Kun bear and bind the Elixir, encompassing the Dao’s compass and square.

"Using the Nine, it flutters" means that when excess is seen, destiny retreats, and when Yang’s numbers are exhausted, they turn and unite once more.

**Chapter 48: Following the Turning Mechanism**

Following the turning mechanism, ascending and descending, rising and falling, circulating through the six lines is difficult to observe, hence it has no fixed position and is the ancestral founder of the Changes.

The preceding text states that Qian and Kun are the Dao’s compass and square. To follow the principles of Yin and Yang, one must adhere to the movement of the Dipper. Transformations are complete within the six lines, circulating without fixed position—this is the ancestral founder of the Changes. It is like Kan and Li operating qi within the cauldron, circulating through the six voids within the image, where none can perceive its profound subtlety. This is the ancestral founder of the medicine.

**Chapter 49: The New Moon as Fu**

At the new moon, Fu begins, and Yang qi first flows. Entering and exiting without hindrance, it establishes the standard as firm. Huangzhong is established in Zi, heralding the flourishing of growth. Spreading soft warmth, the common people are nourished and attain constancy.

"At the new moon, Fu begins" refers to five Yin and one Yang, where Yin qi is exhausted and Yang qi revives. This is when the six soft lines of the lower trigram first change into a single firm line, the omen of solitary Yang’s birth. Thus, Yang fire begins at the initial Zi. "Yang qi first flows" means the pitch corresponds to Huangzhong, and within the cauldron, it receives the subtle Yang qi, laying the foundation for cinnabar and mercury. With five Yin and one Yang, Yang is the master, spreading qi and flowing without obstruction—this is called "entering and exiting without hindrance." The *Changes* states: "Fu is the return; returning is its Way. In returning, the heart of heaven and earth is seen." This is like heaven and earth within the cauldron, where the myriad things begin to be born. It corresponds to the eleventh month, Zi, when Yang fire advances.

**Before the Crucible, Applying the Branch (Chapter 50)**
Before the crucible, applying the branch opens the path and rectifies the light—radiance gradually advances, day by day increasing in length. At Chou, Great Lü forms, its pitch attuned to low and high.

The *Lin* hexagram has four Yin and two Yang, signifying the firing of Chou: Yang’s power gradually advances, its radiance illuminating the crucible. After the winter solstice, the days lengthen, and Yang qi slowly spreads, engendering the divine qi of essence. This accords with Great Lü, where the pitch is set to low and high—Metal and Water respond to qi, gradually congealing into flowing pearls above. It corresponds to the twelfth month, Chou, when Yang fire advances.

**Looking Upward to Complete Peace (Chapter 51)**
Looking upward to complete peace: firm and soft flourish together, Yin and Yang unite. The small departs, the great arrives, converging at Yin to follow the season.

The *Tai* hexagram has three Yin and three Yang: Yin and Yang qi balance, husband and wife unite, and the essences of Dragon and Tiger gradually manifest, flourishing with Metal and Mercury. Thus it is said, "The small departs, the great arrives." The *Changes* states: "There is no level that does not slope, no going that does not return"—this is the Way of Yin and Yang’s mutual succession. It corresponds to the first month, Yin, when Yang fire advances.

**Gradually Passing Through Great Strength (Chapter 52)**
Gradually passing through Great Strength: arrayed at the Mao gate, elm pods fall and return to their root. Punishment and virtue contend, day and night begin to divide.

The *Dazhuang* hexagram has two Yin and four Yang, signifying mid-winter when Yang qi, though flourishing, still contains Yin qi. The Yin path is about to depart, so elm pods fall with the Yang. "Punishment and virtue contend" refers to the second and eighth months, when Yin and Yang divide their positions: Yang is virtue, and by virtue, the myriad things are born; Yin is punishment, and by punishment, the myriad things die. Thus, in the second month, Yang contains Yin, and Yin qi assaults things—hence, in mid-spring, elm pods fall, symbolizing Metal and Cinnabar stirred by residual Yin qi, descending into the womb. This is called "returning to the root." In the eighth month, Yin contains Yang, and Yang qi arises—hence, in mid-autumn, shepherd’s purse and wheat regrow, symbolizing Metal and Water stirred by residual Yang qi, filling the chamber with fluid. This is called "renewed flourishing." Below, it speaks of the *Guan* hexagram, where form and power contend, and Yin and Yang balance. It corresponds to the second month, Mao, when the fire of rest advances.

**Decisive Yin Retreats (Chapter 53)**
Decisive Yin retreats, Yang ascends and advances, washing and cleansing its wings, shaking off the dust of the roost.

**Decisive Yin Retreats (Chapter 53, continued)**
The *Guai* hexagram holds one Yin and five Yang: as Yang ascends and Yin retreats, Yang qi grows abundant, yet within the crucible a trace of Yin qi lingers. Fired by the Chen trigram’s flame, the golden cinnabar is cleansed, its wings washed, its roost-dust shaken free—this corresponds to the third month, Chen, when advancing Yang fire prevails.

**Vigorous Yang Flourishes Brightly (Chapter 54)**
Vigorous Yang flourishes brightly, its radiance spreading to the four neighbors. Yang culminates at the center of *Ji*, where the *Gan* hexagrams intersect.
The *Yijing* states: “Great indeed is the primal power of *Qian*! Strong and firm, centered and upright, pure and refined.” The primal power of *Qian* is the source from which the myriad things draw their beginning. From the Winter Solstice, when the first Yang arises, to the state of pure Yang—clouds drift, rain falls, and the forms of things flow forth. This is likened to the crucible’s process: from the eleventh month, when it receives the talisman, to the fourth month, when all six lines transform into pure *Qian*, the essence is perfected and the forms take shape. Thus, when the golden embryo encounters the fire of true Yang, the metal, refined by fire, becomes a vessel, its brilliance ever more radiant, spreading to the four neighbors, filling the crucible’s chamber. This corresponds to the fourth month, *Si*, when advancing Yang fire prevails. “Culminating at the center and intersecting” signifies that Yang, having reached its extreme, gives birth to Yin—hence the following passage speaks of “Yin encroaching upon Yang’s virtue.”

**Union’s Beginning Recorded (Chapter 55)**
Union’s beginning is recorded: treading frost first, the well’s cold spring. At *Wu*, the guest is *Si*, and *Si* submits to Yin, for Yin is the host.
The *Yijing* states: “Union (*Gou*) means encounter.” Five Yang and one Yin: Yin arises, Yang retreats, and the boundary between Yin and Yang is drawn. Dragon and tiger intertwine in union—thus they encounter one another. It also states: “Bound to the metal brake, steadfastness brings good fortune,” for the first Yin initiates the change, tethered to *Wu* and transforming until extreme Yin is reached. “Treading frost first” means that when the first Yin arises, extreme Yin must follow: just as the faintest frost heralds solid ice, so too the well’s cold spring signifies that beneath five Yang lies one Yin. Though Yin qi has yet to spread, and the five Yang are many, Yin now assumes control. In all hexagrams, when five Yin and one Yang are present, Yang is master; when five Yang and one Yin, Yin is master—thus it is said, “Yin is the host.” This describes the crucible’s golden mother, originally the essence of supreme Yang water. When it first receives a trace of Yin qi, the subtle stirrings of metal and water begin to unfold, foretelling the coming of solid ice and extreme Yin. This corresponds to the fifth month, *Wu*, when the Yin talisman retreats.

**Withdrawing from the World, Relinquishing Position (Chapter 56)**
Withdrawing from the world, relinquishing position, one gathers true essence, embraces virtue, and awaits the hour, lingering in obscurity and caution.
The *Dun* hexagram holds four Yang and two Yin: Yin qi gradually strengthens while Yang qi wanes. Thus, Yang withdraws from its position, gathering true essence to await the future. As residual Yang dwells within Yin, it nears extinction, lingering in obscurity. The *Yijing* states: “Things cannot forever withdraw—thus one awaits the hour.” This is likened to the crucible’s red dragon essence, now governed by Yin, gradually uniting with metal and water to conceive the maiden. One gathers true essence, allowing Yin and Yang to transform freely. This corresponds to the sixth month, *Wei*, when the Yin talisman retreats.

**Obstruction and Blockage (Chapter 57)**
Obstruction and blockage: what sprouts does not grow. Yang stretches forth, then bends; Yang’s name and form vanish.
The *Pi* hexagram holds three Yang and three Yin: Heaven and Earth both rest, Yin and Yang do not unite, and the myriad things do not sprout. The golden mother within the central palace naturally coils and unfurls in tranquility. This corresponds to the seventh month, *Shen*, when the Yin talisman retreats.

**Observing Its Measure (Chapter 58)**
Observe its measure, examine mid-autumn’s nature: the young and tender, the old and withered, revive and flourish—shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout, [text missing] burgeoning forth beneath their cover.
The *Guan* hexagram holds two Yang and four Yin: Yin qi is now abundant. This describes mid-autumn’s nature, when within the crucible, metal, receiving Yin qi, unites with water and transforms, giving birth to the maiden—quicksilver. Yet Yin qi, though dominant, still leaves a residue of Yang harmony, which in mid-autumn revives shepherd’s purse and wheat. Thus it is said, “the old and withered revive and flourish.” “Burgeoning forth” means sprouting everywhere, likening metal and water, bearing the Yin talisman in mid-autumn, to nurturing sacred mercury within the embryo. The balance of Yin and Yang’s punishment and virtue in the eighth and second months was annotated in the *Dazhuang* hexagram above. This corresponds to the eighth month, *You*, when the Yang talisman advances.

**Flaying the Body to Rotting (Chapter 59)**
Flaying the body to rotting, its form dissolves and vanishes; when qi is exhausted, all is lost, returning to *Kun*.
The *Yijing* states: “*Bo* means flaying.” One Yang and five Yin: Yin flourishes, Yang wanes, the soft encroaches upon the hard, and both metal and water rest. The body dissolves, its work returning to Earth’s virtue. This corresponds to the ninth month, *Xu*, when the Yin talisman retreats. “All is lost, returning to *Kun*” refers to the following passage, where all six lines are pure Yin.

**When the Way Reaches Its Limit, It Turns Back (Chapter 60)**
When the Way reaches its limit, it turns back to *Kun*. The primal power of *Kun* ever follows Earth’s pattern, bearing Heaven’s mandate and spreading its decree.
*Qian* begins from *Kun*: six yielding lines of Earth. When one firm line changes below, it is called “the birth of one Yang.” Yang qi begins here and transforms until all six lines become pure Yang, completing *Qian*’s body. When pure Yang’s qi is full, Yang reaches its extreme and Yin is born. Then, beneath *Qian*’s six firm lines, one yielding line changes—this is called “the birth of one Yin.” It transforms until all six lines become pure Yin, returning to *Kun*’s body. Thus it is said: “When the Way reaches its limit, it turns back to *Kun*’s primal power.”
*Kun* is Earth Mother, Yin; *Qian* is Heaven Father, Yang. Thus Yin, receiving Yang, gives birth; Yang, receiving Yin, achieves completion. This is what is meant by “the Way of one Yin and one Yang.” It bends to form the myriad things without omission—thus it is said, “Ever following Earth’s pattern, bearing Heaven’s mandate and spreading its decree.” This is likened to the year’s twelve months and the day’s twelve hours, where the fire of Yin and Yang’s advance and retreat aligns with the essence of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, cycling endlessly with inexhaustible subtlety. Thereby, the sacred maiden and numinous youth unite Yin and Yang within the divine chamber; flying dragon and crouching tiger entwine soul and spirit within the mother’s womb. Thus, the divine transformations are boundless, and what is born is pure and perfect.

**The Profound and Vast (Chapter 61)**
The profound and vast, though distant and obscured, are linked in resonance, nurturing the seeds of Yin and Yang’s origin. Vast and indistinct, none know its beginning: first it loses the path, then becomes the lord. There is no level without a slope—this is the Way’s natural change. Alternating flourishing and decline, they respond to one another. Beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*, it is like tracing a linked ring. Emperors and kings inherit and govern for a thousand generations, ever abiding. Though Heaven and Earth are profound and vast, when the qi of the sun and moon exchange in accord with their movements, they too are linked, nurturing the seeds of the myriad things as the ancestors of Yin and Yang.
Yin and Yang unite their essence within Heaven and Earth’s vast and indistinct expanse—none know whence they emerge or vanish. This is likened to the crucible’s device, which models *Qian* and *Kun*, father and mother, turning the axis of *Kan* and *Li*, male and female, within its vast and indistinct interior—none witness the traces of its transformations. The metal within the crucible is the medicine’s origin. At first, it is profound yellow, undifferentiated, losing the path. Then Yin and Yang divide, and finally the benevolent lord and the five phases interact, with nothing that does not return. Obstruction and openness alternate, Yin and Yang depend on one another. Beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*, entering the talisman and exiting the fire, adding water and settling metal, moving fire and halting water—this is like the inner image of a cycle. Metal and water nurture one another, just as the ruler, like the four seasons, applies the talisman’s fire, increasing and decreasing without losing the proper time. For a thousand autumns, dragon and tiger endure.

**Chapter Sixty-Two: On Nurturing Nature**

To nurture nature and prolong life, delaying the appointed end, one must first reflect upon its origin. The body we inherit is fundamentally one, without primordial essence—qi spreads and abides in its initial state. Master Wei said: Those who wish to extend life and postpone death must first understand the beginning and end of their form. This beginning and end is the primordial qi. The refinement of the Returned Elixir depends entirely on primordial qi for its completion. It is by joining boundless primordial qi to a finite body that the finite form is sustained. Boundless primordial qi is the long-lived true essence of Heaven and Earth, the qi of the sacred father and numinous mother. The finite body is the short-lived, turbid, and disordered qi of ordinary parents. Thus, by transforming the body of ordinary parents through the qi of the true parents into a form of pure yang essence, one attains a lifespan equal to that of Heaven and Earth. Master Tao said: Primordial qi is the root of humanity. An ancient verse states: *Refine it, ingest it—after a thousand days, the body is without yin, so how could death come?* For the essence and qi of pure yang are indestructible.

**Chapter Sixty-Three: Yin and Yang as Measure**

Yin and yang serve as measure, the dwelling of hun and po. The yang spirit is the sun’s hun; the yin spirit is the moon’s po. Hun and po mutually inhabit one another’s abode. Nature presides within, establishing the inner boundary; emotion operates without, constructing the outer walls and ramparts. When the ramparts are complete, all beings find peace. At this time, emotion harmonizes with Heaven and Earth: when *Qian* moves, it is direct, qi spreads, and essence flows; when *Kun* is still, it contracts, becoming the Dao’s dwelling. The firm advances and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversions, eight reversals, six residences—male is white, female is red. When metal and fire constrain one another, water is stabilized, and fire is the origin of the five phases. Supreme goodness resembles water, clear and flawless—the form and image of the Dao. The True One is difficult to depict, for though it transforms and disperses, each abides in its own place.

Yin and yang as measure: In refining the divine elixir of liquid gold, one must first establish yin and yang’s course, then set up the *Qian* and *Kun* crucible and furnace. Hun and po mutually inhabit one another’s abode: The sun’s hun and moon’s po constrain one another within the golden chamber, forming the foundation of the elixir. Nature presides within, establishing the inner boundary: Nature pertains to metal, which governs the interior, receiving and conveying the outer tally to nurture the numinous mercury. The inner boundary is the physical form. Emotion operates without, constructing the outer walls: Emotion is the tally of fire, which moves through the six voids to become cinnabar mercury. The walls and people are the cinnabar mercury. At this juncture, it is like *Qian* and *Kun* in motion and stillness, qi spreading and essence flowing. Earth resides in the central palace as the Dao’s dwelling. Yang submits, yin acts; peace comes, obstruction goes. The punishment and virtue of yin and yang are the fundamental path of the medicine.

Nine returns, seven reversions, eight reversals, six residences: Metal’s generating number is four, its completing number nine; fire’s generating number is two, its completing number seven; wood’s generating number is three, its completing number eight; water’s generating number is one, its completing number six; earth’s generating number is five, its completing number ten. Male is white, female is red: Metal initially arises from water and belongs to yin, corresponding to the north and the *Kan* trigram—this is the image of the *Qian*-centered male, called the *Kan* male, and metal is white, hence “male is white.” Fire belongs to yang, corresponding to the south and the *Li* trigram—this is the image of the *Kun*-centered female, called the *Li* female, and fire is red, hence “female is red.” When true metal is within the crucible, it is the *Kan* male, the husband of the *Li* female; when outside the crucible, it reverses to become the *Li* female, the wife of the *Kan* male. Thus, the metal mother receives the qi of the great yang and produces numinous mercury. Water is stabilized, fire is restrained: Metal and fire constrain one another, preventing true water from flowing away. The origin of the five phases: Water’s generating number is one. Supreme goodness resembles water: Water is the mother of all things, clear and flawless, invisible. The form and image of the Dao: It operates secretly within the crucible, transforming ceaselessly, impossible to depict. Transforming and dispersing: The five phases each guard their boundaries, and the tally fire follows the four seasons without error.

**Chapter Sixty-Four: Like a Chicken’s Egg**

It is like a chicken’s egg, black and white conjoined, a span of one *cun* in length, serving as the initial stage. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all develop, and after ten months, it emerges from its sac. Its bones are weak and pliable, its flesh smooth as lead.

In refining the Returned Elixir of liquid gold, there is an altar; upon the altar, a furnace; upon the furnace, a hearth; within the hearth, a crucible; within the crucible, a divine chamber; and within the divine chamber, metal and water. The divine chamber resembles a chicken’s egg, and metal and water are likewise. “Like a chicken’s egg” describes layers enfolding one another. “Black and white conjoined” describes metal and water enclosing one another. “A span of one *cun*” is for housing the numinous mercury. If one uses the *Qian* and *Kun* pivot to generate *Kan* and *Li*, after ten months, the form is complete, no different from a human—four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and flesh all intact. These several lines reveal Master Wei’s exposition of the inner and outer symbolic forms and the appearance of cinnabar mercury.

Master Yin Zhenjun’s *Divine Chamber Song* states:
*The golden crucible of Earth gives life and death eternally;
The sevenfold divine chamber shines, threefold round, fivefold in diameter,
Onefold in its chaotic wandering—Heaven and Earth, the five stars,
Yin and yang conjoined in form like a chicken’s egg,
Its appearance without flaw, yellow and white within and without,
Even in thickness. The Six-and-One seals it well—
Guard the noon gate, beware!*

The *Cantong Qi* also says: *With water, fly the Earth Mother to restrain it.*

“Its flesh smooth as lead”: Cinnabar is born from lead, resembling a mother. Master Cao Zhenren’s song states:
*Through a hundred moments, the qi of *Li* reaches its peak,
Cinnabar emerges from this—its body like true pearls.
Cinnabar is not originally mine—
This clarifies its form resembling pearls, its flesh smooth as lead.*

**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Burning Mirror to Capture Fire**

The burning mirror captures fire—without the sun, it does not emit light. The moonlit vessel cannot obtain water without the stars and moon. These two qi, though distant, still interact through mutual resonance. How much more so when near, stored within the heart and chest? Yin and yang pair with the sun and moon; water and fire serve as their proof.

The burning mirror and moonlit vessel, moved by qi, still generate water and fire. How could *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon in symbolic form, fail to produce and complete? Thus, whether drawing near from the body or afar from things, first gather the mother of Heaven and Earth as the foundation of the elixir, then unite the essence of the sun and moon as the ancestor of the medicine. When the seed of mercury is born and water and fire constrain one another, how could there be no evidence of efficacy?

---

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Three Treasures of Ear, Eye, and Mouth**

The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—must be closed and sealed, not opened. The true person sinks into the deep abyss, floating and wandering, guarding the central barrier. Turn and curve to see and hear; opening and closing are as one, serving as the pivot of the self. In movement and stillness, they are inexhaustible. *Li* qi flourishes within the constructive and protective; *Kan* is not used for hearing. *Dui* joins without speech; few words accord with the vast primordial. When these three are secured, relax the body and guard the empty chamber. Entrust your will to the void, take non-thought as your constant, and though proof is difficult to shift, the mind remains focused, without distraction. In sleep, the spirit embraces itself; upon waking, it awaits the signs of life and death. The complexion gradually becomes moist, the bones and joints grow stronger. Expel the host of yin demons, then establish the true yang. Cultivate it without ceasing, and the qi will become like clouds and rain, flowing abundantly like spring’s moisture, trickling like melting ice. From the head, it flows to the feet, then ultimately ascends again. Coming and going, moving without end, it fills the body within—this is the verification of the Dao. The weak is the handle of virtue. Weed and hoe the long-standing filth, even the most minute, to achieve harmony. The turbid path is cleared; after long darkness, brightness dawns.

The *Yijing* states: "Kan is the ear, Li is the eye, Dui is the mouth." Kan, Li, and Dui correspond to water, fire, and metal. The interlocking of water and fire seals and secures the Metal Mother, referring to the Infant Boy and the Maiden Girl as the True Person, who floats freely within the womb. This allows the mother to relax her body and rest within the empty vessel, without movement or thought, to verify its naturalness—thus do male and female multiply.

Once the yin and yang within the cauldron ascend and descend in harmony, the Dragon and Tiger within the womb rise and fall, embracing and securing the true essence. The complexion gradually becomes moist, the bones and joints grow stronger. Cultivating this without cease, over time, verification becomes possible. Dispelling the yin fire means expelling the host of yin demons; adding the yang talisman initiates the proper circulation of yang, cycling endlessly. The spirit chamber becomes peaceful and harmonious, clouds gather and rain falls, mercury flows and golden liquid melts like ice dissolving. From the feet to the head, it suffuses the True Person’s body, circulating through the Metal Mother’s form. The fire qi surges within the cauldron, while the metal essence remains weak within the compass. After long darkness, brightness dawns—this is the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born. Clarity emerges from turbidity, the time when fire retreats and water returns. The four seasons alternate, the five phases interact, and reversal becomes the verification of the Dao.

Kan departs, Li arrives; weakness is the foundation of virtue’s cultivation. Yang extends, yin submits. The Kan ear does not hear, so the yin spirit harmonizes with the true water, preventing its dissipation. The Li eye does not see, so the yang soul warms and nourishes the true mercury, preventing its escape. The Dui mouth does not speak, sealing the golden womb to prevent the opening and closing that would leak the Red Dragon’s essence.

The four chapters of the *True Scripture* as expounded by Master Wei employ metaphors drawn from afar yet applied closely, revealing matters in plain words to guard against misinterpretation. He did not wish to openly disclose the celestial mechanism, nor did he wish to conceal the supreme Dao. Thus, he fully illuminated the inner imagery and its external application, making them one.

This is the sixty-seventh chapter, "Worldly People Prefer Minor Arts."

The worldly prefer minor arts,
not discerning the depth of the Dao.
They abandon the correct to follow the deviant,
seeking swift results where paths are blocked,
like the blind refusing a staff,
or the deaf straining to hear the *shang* note.
They cast nets in water to catch pheasants and hares,
climb mountains to seek fish and dragons,
plant wheat hoping to reap millet,
or wield compasses to draw squares.
Expending effort and exhausting spirit,
throughout the year they see no merit.

To know the method of ingesting and refining,
the matter is simple and unburdensome.
Master Wei said: The worldly delight in learning minor arts,
pursuing shortcuts in haste.
Yet minor arts and hasty paths have beginnings but no ends;
though they expend great effort, few achieve success.
Like the blind and deaf who err in seeing and hearing,
or hunters and fishers misled by rivers and mountains—
their choices are awry,
their right and wrong indistinguishable.
Diligently seeking the supreme Dao,
it is simple and unburdensome.

Moreover, the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir
are the supreme Way of soaring to the heavens in broad daylight.
If one encounters an enlightened master
or receives divine transmission,
following its wondrous instructions in cultivation,
then the principle of ease and simplicity is attained.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Sun’s Flowing Pearl**

The Sun’s flowing pearl ever seeks to depart,
but upon obtaining the Golden Flower, it turns and responds,
transforming into a white liquid,
congealing into utmost hardness.
The Golden Flower first intones,
and in a moment, dissolves and transforms into the Water Horse.
Its teeth are like *langgan* jade;
yang then proceeds to harmonize.
Nature and essence naturally press forward,
while yin constrains and stores,
the forbidden gate of the compassionate mother nurturing her filial son,
the stern father issuing commands to instruct his descendants.
The Five Phases contend in dominance,
fire’s nature melts metal,
metal fells wood,
and the two and five unite with the one—
the supreme essence of heaven and earth.
This can be conveyed through oral instructions,
but is difficult to express in writing.

The Sun’s flowing pearl:
earth qi conjoins with heaven qi to form the pearl and dew,
pure yang essence that engenders the myriad things.
It has qi but no form,
hence it is called the Red Dragon.

Yang fire transforms qi into cinnabar,
thus fire gives birth to earth,
earth gives birth to metal.
Metal is the profound mystery of Great Yin,
able to nourish the myriad things.
It has qi and substance,
hence it is called the Golden Flower.

The Red Dragon arises from *jia* and *yi*,
also named the Azure Dragon—yang,
the father,
the husband.

Fire, then—
the Golden Flower resides in *geng* and *xin*,
also named the White Tiger—yin,
the mother,
the wife.

Water, too—
thus the meaning of Azure Dragon and White Tiger is taken.
Yet some invert yin and yang,
interchange the Five Phases,
and alternate male and female as husband and wife,
which is also its meaning.
As the Tai Bai Immortal’s song says:
*“The Five Phases’ inverted art—
the dragon emerges from fire’s heart.
The Five Phases out of sequence—
the tiger is born within water’s essence.
The root of Returned Cinnabar,
the ancestor of Dragon and Tiger:
the dragon from fire is born,
the tiger from water is formed.”*
These words are not easily altered.

The metal wife first sings,
the wood husband sows and spreads.
The divine mother conceives,
giving birth to the *chana* maiden.
As the *chana* maiden grows,
her transformations are manifold:
sometimes dissolving into water,
sometimes into horse-teeth jade.
Though the metal mother first arises from water,
amidst her transformations,
the water’s essence never ceases.

Yang then advances to harmonize—
what is natural in temperament and nature—
is the mutual generation of metal and mercury.
“Urgent and pressing, when yin constrains and stores within the forbidden gate”
refers to yin qi’s revolving support,
guarding the inner palace.

“The compassionate mother nurtures,
the filial son repays kindness”
speaks of the compassionate mother’s inner womb,
the filial son being true mercury.
The *Yin Zhenjun* song says:
*“Yang is true cinnabar,
yin is true mercury.”*
Since mercury is born of the metal mother,
it is called “repaying kindness.”

Mutual swallowing and guarding—
this is the intercourse of dragon and tiger qi.

“The stern father issues commands,
instructing his descendants”
refers to the *Qian* trigram as father,
directing the host of trigrams
to assist the *Li* maiden and *Kan* man,
and the Five Phases together to generate
the cinnabar and mercury descendants.
Returned Cinnabar takes “lead” and “fire” as its ancestral origin,
its beginning and end,
its revolving application.
The remaining qi, temporal markers, and symbolic tokens
serve as aids to jointly complete the divine foundation.
Beyond this lies no path of Golden Liquor Returned Cinnabar.

Fire can melt metal,
yet fire is born of wood,
and metal in turn restrains wood—
thus metal and wood reverse their restraints to flourish.
An ancient song says:
*“Cinnabar, wood’s essence,
obtains metal and unites.”*
And again:
*“When the three natures conjoin,
the three flavors naturally bind and secure.
The embryo is nourished without leakage,
transformation occurs in an instant.”*
The three natures are fire, metal, and wood;
the three flavors are lead, mercury, dragon, and tiger.
Thus it is said: *“The two and five unite with the one—
the supreme essence of heaven and earth.”*
That it *“can be conveyed through oral instructions,
but is difficult to express in writing”*
is hardly to be lightly discussed with the uninitiated.

The annotation *“alternating as male and female”*
refers to divine water restraining fire,
yet when within the divine chamber,
fire in turn restrains metal.
Mercury is water within metal,
metal is cinnabar within water.
Cinnabar gives birth to mercury,
metal gives birth to water.

*“The child should turn right to the sixty-ninth chapter,
the child should turn right to noon,
then eastward revolve to *mao* and *you*,
where boundaries divide host and guest.
The two names: the dragon calls to the tiger,
the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.
Both feast upon each other,
both covet and thus entwine,
swallowing and chewing,
devouring one another.
When *Yinghuo* guards the west,
*Taibai* traverses the heavens—
what killing qi descends that does not topple?
When the fox guards the rat,
the sparrow fears the kestrel—
each attains its function,
how dare any sound resist?”*

*“The child turns west to *you*,
noon revolves east to *mao”*—
this is the yin-yang recurrence of the twelve earthly branches,
the fire-timing of the symbolic tally.
*Mao* and *you* are the two boundaries—
the qi of metal and wood pauses.
Host and guest are the two names—
the designations of metal and wood.
The Azure Dragon exhales qi,
the White Tiger inhales essence.
Essence and qi intermingle,
together engendering purity.

*Yinghuo* is the fire of extreme yang,
“guarding the west” means fire qi presses upon the metal embryo.
When metal receives fire’s盛 brilliance,
its radiance fills the vessel.
Metal qi bears fire,
traversing the heavens—
thus it is called *“killing qi descends.”*
What could not topple?
The *chana* maiden and true lead dare not flee,
like the cat seizing the rat,
the sparrow fearing the kestrel.

*Taibai* is metal’s essence,
“traversing the heavens” refers to *jia* and *yi*.
Metal, fire, and wood alternately restrain and submit,
yet none are harmed—
each attains its success,
and no dissonant sound arises.

**Chapter Seventy: Failing to Grasp the Principle**
Failing to grasp the principle,
one should not speak recklessly.
Exhausting family wealth,
wife and children starving in poverty—
from ancient times to the present,
countless have loved this path,
yet none have succeeded.
Few indeed are those who meet and achieve it.
Seeking famous medicines widely,
one strays far from the Dao.
If by chance you encounter it,
observe its threads,
compare and measure things from beginning to end,
and only then proceed.

**Master Wei’s Admonition on Refining the Golden Liquor and Returning Elixir**
Master Wei said: To refine the golden liquor and returning elixir without grasping the principle is to act recklessly, squandering family wealth and burdening wife and children. From ancient times to the present, those who loved the Dao number in the millions, yet without encountering an enlightened teacher or meeting the true formula, none have succeeded. If one receives proper transmission and discerns its threads, taking measurements to cultivate it, then from beginning to end, success is assured.

**Chapter Seventy-One: The Five Phases Restraining One Another**
The five phases restrain one another, alternately serving as father and mother. The mother contains the nourishing fluid; the father bestows and congeals essence, shaping form. Metal and stone do not decay. If one examines and concentrates without leakage, one attains the Dao. Like setting up a pole to see its shadow or calling into a valley to hear its echo—how can this not be efficacious? Yet if one takes a mere inch of wild aconite or a single ounce of croton seed, once it enters the throat, the body stiffens, unable to bend or rise. At such a time, even if King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius divined the hexagrams, Bian Que wielded his needles, or Wu Xian beat his drum, how could they revive the dead or restore movement?

The five phases generate and restrain one another, alternately serving as father and mother, mutually acting as husband and wife. Father and mother bestow and beget; yin and yang depend on one another to stand, together forming the indestructible elixir. If one obtains it, one should be cautious and discreet to perfect the Dao. If even setting up a pole yields an immediate shadow and an echo resounds in an empty valley, and if wild aconite entering the mouth can produce instant effects, how much more so the golden liquor and returning elixir?

**Chapter Seventy-Two: The Riverbank Maiden**
The riverbank maiden is numinous and most divine. When she meets fire, she flies away, unseen amidst dust and smoke. Dragons and serpents hide, their whereabouts unknown. To restrain her, the yellow sprout must serve as her root.

The riverbank maiden is true mercury. When she meets fire, she soars like a dragon or serpent, vanishing without a trace. To control her, one must obtain the yellow sprout as her mother to nurture and sustain her. The yellow sprout is true lead.

**Chapter Seventy-Three: Things Lacking Yin and Yang**
Things lacking yin and yang violate heaven and forsake the origin. The hen hatches her own chicks, yet they are not whole. Why? Because the union is not yet complete; the Three and Five have not joined. Hard and soft are divided; the essence of transformation is lost. Heaven and earth act naturally—fire rises and flames upward, water flows and moistens downward—not because some master guides them to do so. The origin of resources and governance of the polity cannot be altered. When male and female mate, hard and soft unite inseparably, attaining their proper measure. This is not achieved through human artifice. When a boy is born, he lies prone; when a girl is born, she lies supine. They receive this from the womb, their qi from the very beginning—not merely visible at birth. When they die, they revert to the same postures, not because their parents taught them, but because the pattern was fixed at the moment of union in the beginning.

The *Yijing* says: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.” Between heaven and earth, if yin and yang are separated, the myriad things cannot exist. Solitary yin or solitary yang cannot generate or complete anything. Thus, if the divine medicine’s workings lack the union of the Three and Five or the harmony of metal and wood, how can the elixir be formed? Fire flaming upward and water moistening downward are natural qualities. When they are matched and cultivated, their essence and spirit are naturally produced, for each receives the qi of the original beginning, and their natures are determined. For example, when a boy is born, he lies prone, and when he dies, he does the same; when a girl is born, she lies supine, and when she dies, she does the same. Thus, from the union of male and female, their true essence is established.

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The Kan Male as Moon**
The *Kan* male is the moon; the *Li* female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If yang loses its qi, yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the new and full moons, they press close, eclipsing and covering one another, mutually overwhelming. Yang diminishes in form; yin brings forth calamity. Male and female depend on one another, inhaling and exhaling to nourish. Male and female intermingle, seeking one another in mutual measurement.

The moon’s essence is golden sand; the sun’s spirit is fiery mercury. When the sun retreats, the moon assumes authority. Metal and fire alternately apply their functions, mutually restraining yet unharmed. Between the new and full moons lies the moment when yin and yang succeed one another, the time of the sun and moon’s waxing and waning. Thus, the sun and moon press close, covering and overwhelming one another, diminishing in form. This illustrates how within the crucible, the yin tally and yang fire intersect with each passing moment, from dusk to dawn, changing with the hours. Since they cover one another, it is said that calamity arises. Within this, the *Kan* male and *Li* female, the male’s nature and female’s essence, depend on one another, inhaling and exhaling, gathering and transforming true essence into the divine medicine.

**Chapter Seventy-Five: Metal Transforming into Water**
Metal transforms into water; water’s nature employs the fire’s function. Fire transforms into earth. Water cannot flow, so the male moves and bestows externally, while the female remains still and conceals internally. If the overflow exceeds its measure, it is restrained by the female. The po controls the hun, preventing excess. Neither cold nor heat prevails; advance and retreat are timely, each attaining harmony and together manifesting verification.

When fire reaches the second and eighth months, metal and water expand. Either watery fluid arises from metal, or golden sand transforms into water, thus harmonizing and employing the function. When the fire’s number is exhausted, it returns its merit to earth. Earth guards the four seasons, so water cannot fly. Thus, water cannot flow. The male moves and bestows externally, so fire moves outside; the female remains still and conceals internally, so metal guards the central palace. Though fire qi encounters metal, it is restrained by fire. Once the yin po is restrained, the yang hun also submits. Cold and warmth cherish one another, each attaining its proper place, together manifesting verification and nourishing the numinous mercury.

**Chapter Seventy-Six: Cinnabar as the Essence of Wood**
Cinnabar is the essence of wood. When it obtains metal, they unite. Where metal and water meet, wood and fire become companions. The four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger. The dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger is yin, its number even. The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother. The kidneys, black, are the child; the heart, red, is the daughter. The spleen, yellow, is the ancestor. The child is the beginning of the five phases; the three things form one family, all returning to *wu* and *ji*.

Cinnabar is the essence of wood. When it obtains metal, they unite: cinnabar originally returns to the metal’s womb to congeal, and metal is mercury. When metal is struck by fire, cinnabar is produced, so cinnabar thus obtains and unites with metal. Metal and wood transform themselves; water and fire mutually operate. The four intermingle within. Dragon and tiger move through yin and yang, odd and even numbers, ascending and descending day and night. The liver, green, is called the father because *jia* and *yi* belong to the fire clan and unite with the metal mother, thus earning the name father. The lungs, white, are called the mother because the metal mother guards the inner womb, constantly using fire as its tally, thus earning the name mother. The kidneys, black, are called the child because the metal mother is originally born from water, and within the crucible, water in turn gives birth to metal, thus becoming the water child. The child water is the first of the five phases. Metal, fire, and wood share the same function, their transformations beginning and ending together, all returning to *wu* and *ji*. Thus, the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor of the medicine. Hard and soft alternate in ascent.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven: Hard and Soft Alternating in Ascent**

Hard and soft alternate in ascent, traversing and distributing through cycles. The dragon lies west, the tiger east; they establish the weft at *mao* and *you*, where punishment and virtue stand guard, meeting in joyful union. Punishment governs subjugation and killing, while virtue governs generation and ascent. In the second month, the elm sheds its pods as the *Kui* star aligns with *mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Tian Gang* star holds *you*. North and south, child and noon, interweave as the warp and weft—one and nine, the numbers that end and begin anew. Within *Xu* and *Wei*, essence is sown at *zi*.

Fire and water alternate in ascent, traversing and distributing through the twelve earthly branches. Dragon and tiger divide at *mao* and *you*, marking the boundary of yin’s punishment and yang’s virtue. Punishment subdues and kills, while virtue generates and uplifts; when punishment and virtue meet, they restrain one another, achieving harmony—hence the term "joyful union."

In the second month, the elm sheds its pods because, as fire advances from *zi* to *mao*, though yang qi gains use, it has not yet reached pure yang, and residual yin remains. Thus, within yang there is yin, and it suffers punishment and killing. Yin steals yang qi, causing the elm’s pods to fall in the mid-spring month of growth. In the eighth month, wheat sprouts because, as the yin tally retreats from *wu* to *you*, though yin qi gains use, it has not yet reached pure yin, and residual yang remains. Thus, within yin there is yang, and it receives virtue’s generation. Yang steals yin qi, causing wheat to sprout in the mid-autumn month of withering.

This mirrors the crucible, where the metal mother, amid the waxing and waning of yin and yang, either coils or unfurls true essence, or else shatters cinnabar and mercury. The *zi* south embodies yin containing yang, the image of the *Kan* man. The *wu* north embodies yang containing yin, the image of the *Li* woman. One is the number of yin; nine is the number of yang.

The cyclical interplay of yin and yang serves as the crucible for the elixir’s workings. Primordial qi generates the void and peril, and yang qi once more sows essence into *zi*, giving birth to true numen.

*Guan Guan*, the seventy-eighth ode:
*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
on the islet in the river.
Graceful and demure, the fair maiden—
the noble man’s fine match.
The male does not dwell alone;
the female does not live in solitude.
The dark warrior, coiled serpent—
twined in mutual support,
they make plain how female and male
must ever rely on one another.
Were two women to share a chamber,
though their beauty differ greatly,
and Su Qin were to mediate,
Zhang Yi to broker the match,
their eloquent tongues to unfurl,
their honeyed words to persuade,
their hearts to harmonize—
even were they wed as husband and wife,
their hair to turn white, their teeth to rot,
they would never know union.
If medicinal ingredients are not of the same kind,
their names disparate, their natures distinct,
their measures mismatched, their principles disordered,
then though the Yellow Emperor tend the furnace,
Taiyi grasp the flame,
the Eight Lords pound and refine,
Huainan blend and harmonize,
though they raise halls and erect altars,
pave steps and terraces with jade,
offer unicorn jerky and phoenix jerky,
hold the register and kneel in prayer,
invoke the spirits with mournful pleas,
bathe and fast in purification,
hoping for some sign—
it would be like mending a cauldron with glue,
plastering a wound with salt,
applying ice to dispel cold,
or boiling water to banish heat:
flying turtles and dancing serpents
would only appear more perverse.

In refining the golden liquor and returning elixir,
first clarify the root of lead and fire,
then recognize the principle of yin and yang.
Solitary yin does not generate of itself;
lonely yang does not achieve of itself.
One must await the union of yin and yang,
the coupling of female and male,
the dragon’s exhalation and the tiger’s inhalation,
the male’s completion and the female’s production.
Thus it is said: the hen does not hatch her own chicks;
two women dwelling together
will never share true affinity.
Moreover, between heaven and earth,
were yin and yang sundered,
the myriad things would cease to be.
Therefore, gather heaven and earth’s true essence,
seize the root of yin and yang—
this alone is the foundation of the elixir.
If one takes gold, stone, herbs, trees,
ice, snow, frost, dew, salt, or brine—
things not of the same kind,
solitary yin or lonely yang—
then though the Yellow Emperor tend the furnace,
Taiyi grasp the flame,
the Eight Lords pound and refine,
Huainan blend and harmonize,
though they erect vast altars,
prepare lavish feasts and wine,
kneel in reverence and pray,
invoke the spirits and hope for the elixir’s return—
it would be like mending a cauldron with glue,
plastering a wound with salt,
flying turtles and dancing serpents:
it would never come to pass.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine: "Only the Sages of Old"**
Only the sages of old embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true, refining the Nine Cauldrons to transform their traces and merge with the hidden. They contained their essence, nurtured their spirit, and penetrated the virtue of the Three Luminaries. Their fluids filled their pores, their sinews and bones grew firm, all evil was dispelled, and their vital qi abided. Through long accumulation, they altered their form and became immortals.

Pitying later generations who loved the Dao, they followed the winds and gathered teachings, inscribing them in charts and texts to enlighten posterity. Yet they revealed only branches and leaves, concealing the root, assigning names to obscure the source. The learned, obtaining these, hoarded them like treasures, sons inheriting their fathers’ work, grandsons following their ancestors’ path. Generation after generation, confusion reigned, and none perceived the truth. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their fields, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars fell into poverty—I grieve for them.

I have therefore set down these words, concise and easy to ponder, their matters few and unburdened. I lay out their principles, verify their substance, and make them observable. Their measures and numbers follow in sequence, yet their phrasing is disordered, their apertures like gates. The wise will examine and reflect, applying their intent to fathom them.

Master Wei said: The Three Sovereigns refined the Nine Cauldrons’ divine elixir and consumed it, attaining essence-containment, qi-nurturance, and the penetration of the Three Luminaries’ virtue. They transformed and merged without form, becoming immortals and guests of the Supreme Emperor. Pitying later seekers of the Dao, some adhered to ancient texts, others gathered from scriptures and formulas, revealing the shallow and near while obscuring branches and leaves, hiding the root. They falsely attributed their methods to metals and stones, confounding their ancestral lineage and obscuring the true. Later generations, obtaining these, failed to trace their origins, taking texts at face value and mistaking the false for the real. Hoarding them like treasures, they passed them down in confusion, pointing to one another in error. Thus, fortunes were squandered, families ruined, and the Dao-heart harmed.

Therefore, I have fixed this record, prizing brevity and ease of thought, simplicity without entanglement. I expose the kernel of truth, not to display disordered words, but to open what has not yet sprouted. I speak directly of cinnabar and mercury; the wise, pondering deeply, will grasp its true meaning.

**Chapter Eighty: "The Pattern of Heaven and Earth"**
No pattern is greater than that of heaven and earth.
The Mysterious Ditch spans ten thousand li,
The Drum of the River faces the Star Marker—
the people all tremble in fear.
The shadow of the gnomon errs in advance and retreat,
nine years of calamity befall.
The August Emperor gazes upon it,
and the king retreats to reform himself.
The pivot has its rises and falls,
harmful qi rushes forth.
The Jiang and Huai run dry,
their waters flow into the sea.
The female and male of heaven and earth
wander between zi and wu.
Yin and yang’s ancestors at yin and shen
emerge and enter, return and begin anew.
Following the Dipper’s handle, they summon the Ladle,
grasping the balance to fix the primal order.

The cauldron of *jiji* models heaven and earth;
within it, the Mysterious Ditch spans ten thousand li.
The three stars of the River Drum, when near the Star Marker,
approach the Northern Dipper, presaging military might.
Thus, the people tremble in fear.
Moreover, war is ruled by metal, which here signifies the cauldron’s metal,
pressed by fierce fire, forced to melt and dissolve.
The cauldron’s chamber suffers drought and calamity,
good fields are ruined.
The clepsydra’s marks diverge, causing yang to act amiss.
Yet we rely on the August Emperor’s earthly virtue to halt metal and water,
quelling fire’s scorching.
He reforms and returns to himself.
If the pivot is not secure and the cauldron’s tally leaks,
the primal qi of the cosmic cycle surges forth,
the Jiang and Huai’s water tally flows away.
Yin arises at wu, yang at zi,
their movement and stillness wandering, never leaving these two positions.
Yin at shen, yang at yin,
water and fire’s end and beginning all follow the Dipper’s establishment
to fix the balance and order.

**Chapter Eighty-One: "Ascending and Roasting on the Steamer Mountain"**
Ascending and roasting on the Steamer Mountain,
fierce fire blazes below.
The White Tiger sings in the lead,
the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
its flying radiance five-colored.
Encountering the net’s spread,
it is pressed and cannot rise.
Its cries are mournful and sorrowful,
like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned into the boiling cauldron,
its feathers and fur are crushed and broken.
Before half the clepsydra’s marks have passed,
fish scales and manes arise.
Five colors gleam and shine,
their transformations ceaseless.
The cauldron’s bubbling boils over,
violently surging without rest.
Layer upon layer, piled high,
like interlocking dogs’ teeth.
Their forms resemble midwinter ice,
preventing desiccation, spitting stalactites.
Towering and jumbled,
their essences intertwine and prop one another.

The cauldron rests upon the stove, the furnace’s altar connected,
thus called the Steamer Mountain.
Above the cauldron is water, below is fire.
The White Tiger sings in the lead: the Metal Mother, receiving fire, takes form,
sometimes spitting white sand, sometimes producing azure fluid.
The Vermilion Bird of bing and ding circulates qi, driving the five phases,
forming five colors and five qi, gathering in the cauldron of heaven and earth.
The four seasons follow the gates of water and fire.
Heaven and earth’s barriers are the net of yin and yang;
the Maiden of Mercury is trapped, true mercury hard to escape.
At times, mournful cries arise, sorrowful and longing for the mother,
leading to crushed feathers and fur.
Within the embryo, it may be mercury or sand;
after the clepsydra’s fire tally, within the embryo,
it may be scales or manes, their transformations ceaseless.
The host’s movement and stillness have their norms:
sometimes violently surging without rest, sometimes bubbling without cease.
When solidly walled, they interlock like dogs’ teeth;
when suspended in emptiness, stalactites form.
Clinging and leaning, propping one another,
towering and jumbled—all reveal the transformations of metal and water,
fully displaying the forms and appearances of cinnabar and mercury.
Their wondrous uses are boundless, their divine essence produced—how subtle!

Master Wei used this to illustrate the formation of cinnabar and mercury.

**Chapter Eighty-Two: "Yin and Yang Attain Their Union"**
When yin and yang attain their union,
they are serene and guard one another.
The Green Dragon dwells in Chamber Six,
spring’s splendor at the east’s mao.
The White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven,
autumn’s austerity at the west’s you.
The Vermilion Bird abides in Spread Two,
true yang at the south’s wu.
All three come to court,
their household becoming kin.
Originally but two things,
in the end, they become three.
Three and five unite as one,
all gathering to return to two.
The method of governance follows the above model,
its days’ count also taken from the beginning.

When yin and yang attain their union, metal and wood are serene and guard one another.
The Green Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird are the three qi of wood, metal, and fire.
Circulating into the cauldron, they become kin.
Moreover, the elixir’s foundation originally has only the two things, metal and fire.
In the end, they become three and five, three and five uniting as one:
wood above, water below, combining with the inner metal and fire,
together completing the transformation.
The days of cultivation and circulation were fully explained in previous chapters.

**Chapter Eighty-Three: "First White, Then Yellow"**
First white, then yellow,
red and black reach within and without.
Called the First Cauldron,
its grains like great millet.
It is the work of nature,
not of deceit or falsehood.
Like the qi of mountains and marshes steaming,
rising as clouds to become rain,
when mud dries, it becomes dust;
when fire dies, it turns to earth.
Like the yellow of phellodendron dye,
indigo forming silk’s green,
hides boiled into glue,
yeast fermenting into wine—
though of the same kind, their effects are easily wrought,
but without the seed, skill is hard to apply.
Only this wondrous art,
examined and verified, does not deceive.
Passed down for a hundred million generations,
its brilliance can be tested.
Shining like the Milky Way,
bright as the sea’s source—
ponder it deeply, make it familiar,
turn it over and over, viewing it above and below.
After a thousand circuits, resplendent and flourishing,
ten thousand times, its wonders will be seen.
The divine may reveal it to others,
the heart’s spirit suddenly awakening.
Seek its threads, trace its beginnings,
and you will find its gate and door.
The Dao of heaven has no partiality,
yet it always abides with the worthy.

Within the womb, the transformations of metal and water unfold thus:
First white—this is metal yielding its jade liquid.
Then yellow—this is the liquid transmuting into the yellow sprout.
When crimson and black permeate both inner and outer, it is the qi of water and fire, yin and yang, with essence and qi circulating through the fetal breath.

The Golden Liquor Returned Elixir, the first crucible, is called the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. As the *Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: "The husk is metal’s essence; water encircles the yellow liquid." Consuming a single grain no larger than a millet seed, after three years the limit is reached, and one ascends in broad daylight. It is also said: "Among all elixirs, its numinous traces are unmatched; none attain longevity without it." The Daoist gate holds twenty-four grades of great elixirs, all beginning with the first crucible, the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. Those that do not start thus are side doors, medicines with form—excluded from the ranks of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.

Formerly, Li Quan’s commentary on the *Yin Fu Jing* stated: "Among the hundred methods of the returned elixir, the essence lies in the divine water and flowery pond." The "hundred methods" refer to the fire times. Drawing and refining for ninety days forms the elixir; another ten days complete the fire times, totaling one hundred days. The "essence lies in the divine water and flowery pond" means the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout arises therefrom. Thus it is said: "Unless one cleaves open the primordial chaos to see the root of heaven and earth, or splits yin and yang to view the origin of water and fire, one cannot grasp the true Dao of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir."

Now, the divine mother within the crucible is steamed by the qi of yin and yang, like clouds moving and rain descending, while water and fire operate, each returning to earth. The medicine within the womb changes its colors and forms with the seasons, its appearance never constant—like indigo dyeing silk green or hides boiled into glue, like yeast fermenting into wine, each following its original kind to transform and take form.

Thus the sage gathers the root and foundation of heaven and earth as the parents of the returned elixir, employing the five phases to generate the numinous medicine. It is not made from the five metals, eight stones, or miscellaneous substances. The principles expounded here are luminous and verifiable, like stars in the Milky Way, like rivers flowing to the sea. The matters and methods are complete, the patterns fully arrayed—how could Wei Gong deceive us? One must only read it ten thousand times, and its meaning will naturally become clear. Or, with divine aid and the spirit of the heart, one may suddenly awaken and thus perceive its gate and door. As the *Daode Jing* says: "Heaven’s virtue is impartial, yet it always abides with the good."

Upon examining various Daoist texts, some claim the *True Contract in Three Chapters* was written by Wei Gong, Xu Congshi, and Chunyu Shutong, each composing one chapter. This is gravely mistaken. Wei Gong himself states in this work’s third chapter: "Now I have compiled and supplemented omissions." Thus it is clear he alone composed it. Moreover, during the Tang dynasty, the perfected one Liu Zhigu of Shu wrote the *Discourse on the Mysterious Pivot of Sun and Moon* and presented it to the Mysterious School, fully expounding these matters. How could there be further doubt about Xu Congshi’s annotations or Chunyu’s transmission? Now, these four chapters are organized into three scrolls, divided into ninety chapters to correspond with the yang number of nine nines.

**Chapter 84: Supplementing Omissions**
The *Cantong Qi* broadly outlines principles but cannot maintain uniformity; its scope overflows, yet subtle details remain incomplete, with gaps and omissions faintly resembling the original. Now I have compiled and supplemented these omissions, refining and deepening the obscure, linking what was disconnected, and equalizing the intent to ensure no deviation. Thus I have composed this third chapter, "Three Phases," so that the nature and essence of the Great Simplicity may be fully illuminated.

**Bing (Floating Stone)**
**Ding (Civil Fire)**
**Ji (Substance)**
**Xin (Common Silver)**
**Gui (True Lead)**
The five positions correspond to:
Three Wood, Two Fire, Five Earth, Four Metal, One Water.
**Jia (Sinking Stone)**
**Bing (Martial Fire)**
**Wu (Medicine)**
**Geng (Common Gold)**
**Ren (True Mercury)**
Each has its match.

Wei Gong first expounded the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters, unfolding its vastness, yet subtle details remained incomplete. Thus he composed the third chapter, "Three Phases," to supplement omissions. Therein, the nature and essence of qian and kun, yin and yang, the five phases, and their cycles are fully revealed. The great patterns of the returned elixir’s beginning and end are now complete.

**Chapter 85: The Nature and Essence of the Great Simplicity**
The nature and essence of the Great Simplicity each adhere to their measure. That measure, when investigated by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, can be applied to the affairs of the furnace and fire with true basis. The three Dao all emerge from one path.

Thus we know the principles of elixir refinement each have their proper sequence and measure. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi investigated this Dao and left writings to this extent. The affairs of the furnace and fire truly have a basis. The five phases share a common origin; the three Dao of metal, water, and fire all emerge from one path.

**Chapter 86: Branches, Stems, Flowers, and Leaves**
Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—fruit hangs down, all rooted in the stock. Do not lose their original nature; what is spoken with sincerity is examined and without error.

In refining the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir, one must first recognize the root and stock to obtain the medicine’s birth, its flowers and leaves, and the fruit that hangs down. "Do not lose their original nature" means not losing the mercury. Only by recognizing true lead as the medicine’s root and stock will the medicine naturally generate true mercury as its fruit, without losing its reliability. This is as stated, without error for later generations.

**Chapter 87: Resembling the Midwinter Season**
Resembling the midwinter season, when grasses and trees are all withered and damaged, assist yang by questioning merchants and travelers. The lord deeply conceals himself. Resembling the season, close your mouth and do not speak of the heavenly Dao—so vast and mysterious, without form or appearance, empty and silent, beyond perception. Boundless, it dissipates errors and missteps, lest words lead to defeat and harm.

I have separately expounded these four images to enlighten later blind practitioners of the elixir. The fire times may cause branches and stems to flourish, or fruit to ripen abundantly, or grasses and trees to wither—responding to midwinter’s opening and closing, all following the regulation of fire in accord with the seasons.

"Assist yang by questioning merchants and travelers" means closing the passes and prohibiting travel, symbolizing the sealed crucible to prevent the leakage of its essence and true qi. "The lord deeply conceals himself" refers to the Golden Mother of the central palace.

The sealing of the mouth from speech is the Chamber of Dui Metal. When the heavenly Dao is so vast and boundless, the transformations within the crucible know no limit. When the Great Mystery is without form or appearance, the fluids of Metal and Water flow in unfathomable abundance, their hidden workings infinite, their divine transformations without fixed direction. As the four seasons shift, the encompassing frame dissolves, and the forms of Metal and Water transmute.

Master Wei said: The Great Dao nurtures the True Governor without form. If one does not regulate and harmonize yin and yang with symbolic methods, restraining and binding their hidden transformations, how could one contend for the celestial mechanism, drawing forth the essence-spirits of the sun and moon, retaining them within the crucible-chamber of a few inches to accomplish wondrous transformation? If one errs in the thread of affairs, defeat and harm are certain. Thus, this text is set forth to awaken those later generations who have not yet seen.

**Chapter Eighty-Eight: The Rustic of Kuaiji**
The rustic of Kuaiji, rotting in a secluded valley, clung to simplicity and plainness, unstained by power or glory. Dwelling in obscurity, he disregarded profit and fame, holding fast to tranquility and contentment, seeking peace and joy in leisure. There he composed this text, singing of the *Great Change* and the three sages’ bequeathed words, examining their shared principles and unified discourse.

This is Master Wei’s own account: not chasing worldly renown, he entered the realm of the Dao, dwelling in ease and quietude. There he composed this text, distilling the three sages’ bequeathed words, converging their threads into one discourse. Taking the crucible of Heaven and Earth as the great foundry, circulating the qi of Kan and Li to compare their transformative powers, then embodying and enacting them—even Heaven would not oppose, let alone humans, let alone spirits and gods. Thus, the divine has no fixed direction, and the *Yi* has no fixed form. Could they not align with its movements and stillness, following yin and yang to accomplish transformation within its emptiness and nothingness? How wondrous!

**Chapter Eighty-Nine: Devotion Lies in Following Principle**
Devotion lies in following principle, manifesting and illuminating the spirit, so that divine transformation flows unimpeded, bringing peace to the four seas. Taking this as a model, it may be followed for ten thousand generations. In governance, its application is not cumbersome; in inner cultivation, it nurtures nature. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi naturally embodied profound virtue, returning to the root and reverting to the origin—close at heart, not apart from the self. Embracing the One without abandonment, one may endure long. Paired with dietary practices, the pairing of male and female is arranged, while the refining of Wudu’s eight minerals is discarded.

The fire times must follow the principle of yin and yang, thereby arousing the spirit, suffusing the Golden Chamber with harmony and smoothness. Governance, conducted according to this method, will not become cumbersome, and it may be followed for ten thousand generations. Let Metal and Water nurture nature within the Central Palace, so that the Yellow Emperor and Laozi contain virtue within, like Metal giving birth to cinnabar and mercury, returning to the root and reverting to the origin, embracing the One as an embryo. Then Water gives birth to the Mother, and the Young Maiden clings to the Mother, so that beginning and end endure long. Without the arrangement of male and female, even the True Mother would achieve no success. As for refining Wudu’s orpiment—one of the eight minerals and five metals—such practices may all be discarded.

**Chapter Ninety: Discerning Use to Complete Things**
Discerning use to complete things: what the world treasures is arrayed in three branches, their stems interconnected, emerging from different names yet all from one gate. This is not merely an accumulation of parallel phrases; this text nearly contains the truth. Though its fragmentation may seem observable, had I spread falsehoods, I would have incurred excess and error. Thus, I composed the *Cantong Qi* to subtly reveal its essence. The words are few, but the meaning is great. Later generations should follow it, relinquishing harm with the seasons, entrusting themselves to the mountains, wandering the vast expanse, befriending spirits and gods. Transforming form into immortality, sinking into silence without sound, they will not descend for a hundred generations, roaming the human world, spreading their feathered wings east and west, south and north. Though scorched by Tang’s drought or drowned by Yu’s floods, though branches and leaves wither and yellow, losing their flourishing splendor, the auspicious person, riding in comfort, may attain long life.

Master Wei commands: cultivate this medicine with utmost sincerity—it is the world’s most precious treasure. The three branches arrayed are the Green Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird—Wood, Metal, and Fire. The Reverted Elixir is formed from nothing beyond these three. Yet these three are originally only two substances: Metal and Fire. Before completion, they become the three of Wood, Metal, and Fire. [These are the three inner images, not the external Wood, Metal, and Fire.] Though many names differ, they are but metaphors to exhaust principle; in truth, they are but one gate. Because the text aligns words and compares matters in parallel, what is valued is the discernment of the mysterious and yellow, the removal of tumors and excess. Thus, the true *Cantong Qi* is composed to reveal its essence. Later generations, following and cultivating it, may dwell in famous mountains and immortal isles, choosing a place to settle, accumulating deeds and piling up merit, departing the world and leaving the vulgar. Their virtue merges with Heaven and Earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, their order with the four seasons, their fortune and misfortune with spirits and gods. Focused and flawless, lofty in their affairs, the Yin Zhenjun’s song says: "Without the proper place, do not act recklessly. In secluded isles, carefully guard and preserve, lest you lose the mechanism of Heaven and Earth." When the Dao is accomplished, the body enters formlessness, sitting and standing at will, roaming east and west, water and fire unobstructed. The calamities of Yu’s floods and Tang’s droughts, the disasters of nine yangs and six yins, will all pose no threat.

**Song of the Crucible**
At dawn, I divided the *Cantong Qi*, supplementing its omissions and filling its gaps, making four chapters into ninety to correspond to the yang number of nine. Beyond this, the "Song of the Crucible" remains, originally placed before the supplements. As its principles interlock and its phrases are fragmented, it stands alone here to correspond to the water number of one. The song says:

Round as three-five,
The crucible’s circumference is one foot five inches,
Its hollow five inches.
Zhang Sui’s annotation says: This is called the Taiyi Furnace,
Round to image Heaven,
Square to image Earth,
Shaped like Penglai,
Also like the human form.
Three layers image the three cinnabar fields.
Thus, the Three Lights, Five Phases,
Four Images, and Eight Trigrams
are all contained within.
One inch one fen thick.

The crucible’s mouth measures four by eight,
its rim inverted like a modern wok or cauldron,
with the lip upturned and the sides split.
Its circumference is approximately three feet two inches,
with a horizontal inner diameter of one foot two inches.
The upright lip encircles it, two inches high,
twelve inches long.
The crucible’s full height is one foot two inches,
with eight inches above the waterline.
Thickness is uniform—
the entire body one inch one fen thick, evenly distributed.

The belly’s navel—three in one—
the crucible’s body, from base to belly, straight through,
equal in upper, middle, and lower sections.
Suspended and warmed—
the crucible hangs within the furnace, not touching the ground,
this is the "suspended embryo crucible."
Yin above—
the upper-water crucible moistens below.
Yang rushes downward—
the lower fire rises upward.
Head and tail martial—
*si* and *wu* mark the boundary of yin and yang:
*si* is yang, the tail of *zi*;
*wu* is yin, the head of *hai*—hence "fire martial."
Center civil—
between *si* and *wu*, yin and yang advance and retreat,
each attaining the mean—hence "fire civil."

Beginning at seventy, ending at three decades,
two hundred and six days, well-regulated.
Seventy-three decades, two hundred and six days,
together totaling three hundred and sixty days,
corresponding to the celestial fire number.
Within this, carefully regulate the fire,
ensuring the tally does not lose the great reckoning of heaven and earth.
Wei Gong, desiring harmonious parallelism, thus divided it in expression.

Yin fire white—
when fire meets yin, its flames are white.
Metal and water are activated, hence more white, less red.
Yellow sprout lead—
the yellow sprout arises from lead;
lead is the mother of the sprout.

Two sevens gather to assist and protect the person—
the later chapter states:
"The Azure Dragon resides in Chamber Six,
the White Tiger in Pleiades Seven."
This signifies the qi of the Azure Dragon’s seven lodges
and the White Tiger’s seven lodges
converging to nurture the divine embryo,
assisting and protecting the birth of the true mercury person.
As the crucible establishes the Three Powers,
the Central Palace is the human realm—
thus the middle chapter says:
"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
floating, guarding the compass within."

Nourishing the brain, stabilizing the ascent—
the *xuanzi* abides in the center, secure and preserved.
The divine chamber, the Metal Mother,
fosters the true child, mercury—
as the earlier chapter says:
"Warmly nurturing the child-pearl."

Coming and going, wandering yet never leaving the gate,
gradually forming great purity of nature.
The maiden and infant, embraced by their mother,
become the linchpin.
The crucible, firm and unyielding,
offers no path of escape—
only within the vessel, above and below,
swimming in cycles like the sun and moon,
day by day, gradually refining into pure essence.

Returning to the One, restoring the original source—
beginning with the water-mother as the cinnabar foundation,
the water-mother regenerates true mercury,
hence it is called "returning to the One, restoring the origin."

Cherish and revere as lord and minister,
through one cycle, with utmost diligence.
Guard closely, guard without confusion—
a full year’s diligence,
carefully guarding without slackening.

The path is distant and profoundly mysterious—should one attain this meeting, heaven and earth become the crucible of the elixir. The Dao of cinnabar is subtle and obscure, its safeguards deep and far-reaching. If one can fully comprehend and reach it, it may be said that heaven and earth lie within the palm, the sun and moon rest in the heart, and nothing remains unattainable.

The *daogui* touches purity, refining soul and spirit;
the golden liquid returning elixir—when the *daogui* permeates the five viscera,
the spirit is tempered, qi clears,
the hun-soul settles, the po-soul stills,
and mortal bones are transformed into those of the perfected.
Attaining longevity, one dwells in the immortal village.

Those who delight in the Dao seek its root—
let those who cherish life pursue the origin of divine medicine and cultivate it,
lest they err by employing杂学.

Examine the five phases, determine the precise measures:
In refining the returning elixir, first investigate the nature of yin and yang,
then clarify the root of water and fire.
Scrutinize the five phases, distinguish their divisions,
trace the cycles of day and night,
and parse the moments of the clepsydra to their finest grains.
Only when yin and yang mutually require,
the five phases interact,
does one achieve success.

Thus Master Cao said:
*"The golden liquid communicates with the immortals—
one must seek it within the five phases.
The five phases are everywhere in number,
but unless the immortal cherishes the essential,
how can one recognize true lead and mercury?
Within one water and one stone,
the Central Palace first presides.
Water and fire teem as things,
yet these two become husband and wife.
When husband and wife pair,
through a hundred moments the qi of *li* is attained—
from this cinnabar emerges.
Thus we know the golden liquid returning elixir:
without the union of true lead and true mercury,
the harmonizing of yin-yang and five phases into medicine,
there is no other path."*

Ponder this earnestly—no need for abstruse discourse.
Guard it closely, do not recklessly divulge its text.
Apply refined focus and deep reflection,
do not treat it lightly in speech.
Seal it within the heart;
if wantonly transcribed, one will surely incur heavenly retribution.

Riding the white crane, driving the scaled dragon,
roaming the Great Void to meet the Immortal Lord,
receiving the celestial charts—thus named a Perfected One.
After the elixir is completed and merits fulfilled, virtue overflows,
one receives the registers and charts, attaining the rank of Perfected One,
verifying all Daoist proofs—is this not so?

Having clarified the divisions of chapters and their meanings,
I humbly observe that the true契 speaks subtly, the Dao’s secret texts profound in principle.
Though the three scrolls are linked from beginning to end,
and the five phases revolve above and below,
the unfolding by the Perfected One is most evident.
Yet I fear the dullness of later learners may struggle to comprehend,
so I dare once more to condense the true契,
composing the *Illuminating Mirror Diagram and Oral Instructions*,
arranging eight cycles to correspond with movement and stillness,
clarifying the two images to determine yin and yang.
The true契’s mysteries, once glimpsed, leave nothing concealed.

The oral instructions say:
The transformations of creation work in hidden ways, their traces unfathomable;
the true instructions cluster, pointing to the youthful sovereign.
Three scrolls secretly arrayed within eight cycles,
the myriad images open their gate within a single mirror.
The Maiden of *Li* rides the dragon as the Wooden Groom;
the Lad of *Kan* mounts the tiger as the Metallic Duke.
Those who love the Dao should delve deeply—
once mastered, the path to longevity lies open.

Moreover:
The supreme Dao is rare and subtle, wondrous and profound;
to refine the elixir, first recognize the Great Returning Heart.

The solar line, yin and even, gives birth to true mercury;
the lunar trigram, yang and odd, produces correct metal.
The woman conceives cinnabar as the man gestates snow—
earth conceals Mars, the *bing* contains *ren*.
The two ends point to the true lead and mercury;
do not seek them haphazardly among the various kinds.

The sun is yang, and within yang lies yin—
the image of cinnabar containing true mercury.
Yang without yin cannot illuminate its spirit,
hence it is called "female fire," for yang contains yin within.
The sun holds the crow; the trigram belongs to the south as the Maiden of *Li*.

The moon is yin, and within yin lies yang—
the image of lead containing true silver.
Yin without yang cannot glow with its essence,
hence it is called "male metal," for yin contains yang within.
The moon holds the hare; the trigram belongs to the north as the Lad of *Kan*.
