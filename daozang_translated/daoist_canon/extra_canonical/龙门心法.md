**The Dragon Gate Heart-Law**
*Compiled by the Pure Perfection Master of the Great Qing, Kunyang Zi Wang Changyue (7th Generation Dragon Gate Preceptor), with the 8th Generation Disciple of Vows, Shi Shouping, and annotated by the 11th Generation Descendant, Min Yide*

**Preface: The True Words of the Heart-Law**

In the year Kangxi 2 (1663), in the month of October, on a favorable day, Kunyang Zi expounded the Precepts at the Jinyin Biyuan [Golden Temple Garden] in Jinling [Nanjing].

To the Concentrated-True Master Shao Shoushan and the Soaring-True Master Zhan Shouchun, he said:

*"Since my youthful years, I have aspired to the Dao, piercing through the illusory nature of mortal life—its emptiness, the impermanence of this phantom realm. To escape the wheel of rebirth, one must early cultivate the Supreme Way.

Yet though Mount Kongtong is near, Guangcheng Zi [Laozi] does not grant an audience;
Though Penglai Island is not distant, how can a common man attain it?

One must resolutely withdraw from defilement, sweep away all dust, purify the heart, and cleanse the will—
until worldly habits crumble like ash,
and the body of desire is purged, severing the roots of delusion.

When all causes cease, one advances step by step through Precept and Meditation;
When all thoughts dissolve, one perceives layer by layer through Wisdom.

To break free is to attain steadiness;
To see through is to endure.

Thus, raise the brows like blades—
wield the knife that severs attachment;
take bold strides—
ascend the path of world-transcendence.

Turn the body, and escape the wheel;
shift the mind, and break free from the net.

If compassion does not fade, as the ancients said: 'First save oneself, then others';
If benevolent resolve endures, I wish to save myself—then save all beings."*

*"I recall my past search for Truth and the Dao:
I visited Wangwu Mountain and met a wise teacher.
Above, I received the boundless grace of the Three Jewels,
and personally heard the Dharma-Treasure.
Below, I relied on my own strength,
enduring hardship to refine the body.

I took refuge in the Supreme Dharma-King,
and walked the Path of the Great Vehicle’s perfection.

Now in this flourishing age of peace and ease—
an era rare in ten thousand kalpas, scarce in a thousand lifetimes—
how dare I not proclaim the Three Jewels,
and repay the Four Debts of Gratitude!

Let me fulfill even a drop of dust’s worth of aspiration,
and offer this humble measure of clarity."*

“Thus, I do not forget the transgressions of presumption and arrogance, and open the hall to expound the precepts;
I do not shun the slander of ridicule and mockery, and expound teachings and scriptures.
This is not for the sake of seeking fame through good deeds,
but to dispel evil and resolve doubts.
Heaven’s law brooks no idle words,
and the Supreme Dao lies only in plain speech.

I now solemnly convey the seventh-generation family tradition of the Dragon Gate lineage
to all assembled.
With reverence, I record the unvarnished truth of the Jade Garden,
for the benefit of all beings in heaven and earth.
I dare not indulge in empty rhetoric—
so let me speak plainly.

Today, I impart this to you,
truly to guide the lost and illuminate the true Dharma.”

*“As for those of the highest vehicle—enlightened ones with keen insight—
I am fortunate to be in their presence,
and earnestly request their compassionate instruction,
to verify what I have heard.
This is my sincere wish.”*

Upon hearing these words, the Master bowed and withdrew, standing to the east and west.
Then, the disciple from Guangling, Shi Shouping, knelt and chanted:

“The source of Dharma is without Dharma, yet the mind creates its cause;
The mind is without mind, yet Dharma is emptiness.
When the mind manifests the Dharma-King’s mind, it manifests form;
When the mind takes refuge in Dharma, it takes refuge in emptiness.
To truly understand Dharma’s essence is not to cling to its roundness,
One must awaken to the fact that the ordinary mind is the sacred mind.
Mind and Dharma, Dharma and mind—
When mind and Dharma are resolved, liberation is known.”

**II. Taking Refuge in the Three Jewels**

The Three Jewels are the Dao, the scriptures, and the teacher.
The Dao is originally formless and nameless, the void itself—
without scriptures, it cannot be made clear.
The Dao resides within the scriptures, profound and subtle—
without a teacher, its principles cannot be grasped.
If one does not take refuge in the Three Jewels,
one will surely sink into heretical paths,
lost in inversion and delusion.

All who aspire to cultivate the True Dao and seek the Way
must, with sincere resolve, take refuge.
They should cherish this rare encounter as a precious opportunity.

First, take refuge in the Jewel of the Supreme Dao,
and pray that all beings may forever attend the Celestial Sovereign,
eternally freed from the wheel of rebirth.

Second, take refuge in the Jewel of the Supreme Scripture,
and pray that all beings may, life after life,
hear the true Dharma.

Third, take refuge in the Jewel of the Supreme Teacher,
and pray that all beings may study the highest vehicle,
and never fall into erroneous views.

These Three Refuges are the first step upward taken by ancient sages
to guide others into the Way,
the first gate of virtue through which one enters.

To become an immortal, to attain the Dao,
to become a sage or a worthy—
all begin with these Three Refuges.
Why?
Because the nature of life and death, the great matters of existence,
are subtle and mysterious, unseen and unheard.
The supreme vehicle of liberation and wondrous Dharma—
if not for a true teacher’s compassionate guidance,
who could suddenly awaken to the true teachings of the Great Vehicle,
gradually entering the boundless Dao,
and avoid falling into heresy or straying into false paths?

Thus, those who have not yet understood the Dao must first take refuge in the scriptures.
Those who have not yet understood the scriptures must first take refuge in the teacher.
If one takes refuge in the Jewel of the Teacher,
then the Jewel of the Scripture may be heard where it was not heard before.
If one hears the Jewel of the Scripture,
then the Jewel of the Dao may be seen where it was not seen before.
What was once unseen and unheard suddenly becomes clear—
all through the power of taking refuge in the Jewel of the Teacher.

Thus, one naturally awakens to the true text,
understands the true Dharma,
transcends birth and death,
and escapes the wheel of rebirth.

But the path of taking refuge in the Three Jewels that I speak of
must be in the true Three Jewels.
Why?
O assembled ones!

Nowadays, the Three Refuges are treated as mere convention—morning and evening before the sacred images, one merely recites and pays homage, without ever truly penetrating the essence of taking refuge. Why then does one come? Thus, one ultimately remains mired in heretical teachings and cannot escape the cycle of rebirth. How then can one attain the Great Dao and transcend birth and death?

*(She Shi’s note: The above two sections concern matters of principle.)*

Those who speak of taking refuge in the Three Jewels must do so in truth. Taking refuge in **intention (意)**, one cultivates the thought of impermanence, and thus the Jewel of the Dao may be illuminated. Taking refuge in **mind (心)**, one removes all obstructions, and thus the Jewel of the Scripture may be awakened. Taking refuge in **body (身)**, one renders the eyes blind to sight, the ears deaf to sound, the nose insensitive to scent, the tongue unable to taste, the hands restrained from movement, and the feet from wandering—untainted by lust, deceit, or impurity—practicing austerities, laboring the sinews, starving the flesh, weakening the limbs, and abandoning the physical form. Only then may one truly invoke the Jewel of the Teacher.

*(She Shi’s note: What is meant by taking refuge in intention, mind, and body are already practical methods. In the initial stages of the Dao of the Elixir, if one takes refuge in intention, the True Gentleman (真士) naturally arises; if one takes refuge in mind, True Fire manifests; if one takes refuge in body, the body remains still while True Water emerges. The foundation of the Dao of the Elixir lies in the purity of the water source, and its greatest key lies in two things: one, if the body does not move recklessly, the water is pure; if the body moves recklessly, the water is turbid; two, if the fire is pure, the water is pure, but if the fire is turbid, the water is also turbid. Thus, taking refuge in the body and in the mind naturally makes foundation-building effortless. And when all three Jewels are taken as refuge, the practice can progress layer by layer.)*

If one can move the Teacher’s compassion and receive transmission of the Scripture and the Dao, it must be through taking refuge in one’s own body, mind, and intention as the true Three Jewels. My own ears and eyes have not yet forgotten their seeing and hearing—whether lost in the illusions of form or attached to emptiness. So long as sound and color remain, the body is not true. How then can it invoke the Teacher?

When one can maintain the body upright, cultivate the root through practice, and align the mind with the True and Eternal, then each thought becomes boundless emptiness, serene and tranquil—this is called taking refuge in the Three Jewels. *(Note: Taking refuge in the Three Jewels is the supreme practice of the Celestial Immortal Dao, namely, "upright the body, empty the mind, true the thought." The beginning and end are no different—how direct and unadorned! Though the practice has no fixed stages, it naturally progresses layer by layer. Kunyangzi, in compassion for later generations, revealed this Dao in this scripture. Alas, today’s people pass by in a daze, failing to grasp the meaning beyond the words. They treat this book as a mere disciplinary or expiatory sutra.)*

If the body does not indulge in licentiousness, the Teacher-Jewel may be invoked;
If the mind is not veiled in delusion, the Scripture-Jewel may be realized;
If the intention is not divided in its application, the Dao-Jewel may be illuminated. *(Note: An intention undivided is the utmost sincerity without cessation—see *Heavenly Immortal Heart Transmission* and *Rain of Fragrance Celestial Scripture Spell Commentary*.)*

When the body is steadfast, essence is preserved and the physique thrives;
When the mind is luminous, qi is pure and wisdom flows;
When the intention is sincere, spirit condenses and nature manifests.
With essence and qi abundant, spirit and intelligence transform boundlessly—all arising from taking refuge in the self’s Three Jewels of body, mind, and intention. Yet the Dao, scripture, and teacher emerge from this foundation.

Now, let us speak of the method for taking refuge in the Three Jewels of body, mind, and intention.

**Assemblage!**
Each of you must focus your minds and listen carefully—I shall now explain the method of taking refuge in the Three Jewels of body, mind, and intention, so that you may dispel darkness and resolve doubt.

**Assemblage!**
This body is formed from the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood, shaped through conception. Its emotions, nature, features, and limbs all develop within the womb. A clump of filth, a sack of the four great elements—eyes see, ears hear, feet move, hands sway, mouth speaks, tongue tastes—none of these are enduring or virtuous things.

The wise use of it leads to becoming an Immortal or Buddha, a Sage or Virtuous One;
The unwise use of it leads to becoming a demon, monster, ghost, or beast.
A single turn upward grants access to the Heavenly Realm;
A single turn downward plunges one into the Hellish Realms.
Those who receive blessings treat it as an external thing;
Those who receive suffering treat it as their foundation.
How much more so for you, who have already left home to transcend birth and death?
You must take refuge in this body—anything less is inadequate.
Otherwise, the six senses will stray outward, and the three poisons will fester within.
Ten thousand calamities and myriad disasters, nine demons and ten trials—all arise from the body.
How then can one practice and enter the Dao?

If you wish to take refuge, there is but one method to subdue this body:
Observe and uphold the precepts, tame the wild corpse.
Take the four great dignities as your foundation—conduct yourself with restraint in walking, standing, sitting, and lying.
Make the ears deaf to sound, the eyes blind to color,
Cultivate a majestic and wondrous form, upright and compassionate,
So that others, seeing you, rejoice and generate reverence.
When the precepts restrain the wild body, transforming it into the Dharma-body, then the Teacher-Jewel may be taken as refuge.

**Assemblage!**
Having now clarified the first segment of the method, you must next take refuge in the mind.
**Assemblage!**
This mind differs from this body in another way...

「Perilous and malevolent transformations are unfathomable,
Like winds sweeping the sea, its waters deep and vast,
When the wind surges fierce, waves and tides rise tumultuous,
Tossing and roaring, their ascent and descent unmeasurable,
Rolling and turning with no fixed course.

Since the beginning of the kalpas, it has been said:
No hope of escape, an endless sea of suffering.

Now, to take refuge in this mind,
You must first recognize that this mind is but a clump of congealed flesh and blood,
Far from being a lasting, benevolent substance.

It relishes sound and color, fearing neither transgression of the precepts nor punishment;
It indulges in sweet foods, heedless of losing life or limb.
It sinks into the torments of hungry ghosts and animal rebirths without dread,
Nor does it flinch at being cast into fiery mountains or burning pits.
It drifts through plagues and calamities without hesitation,
Nor avoids causing stars to fall or mountains to crumble.
All manner of calamitous causes—
This mind alone summons them and sets them in motion.

The Six Bandits march as vanguard, the Seven Emotions lead as generals.
If one seeks to practice without first taking refuge in this mind,
How could they subdue demons and spirits,
Remove the Seven Hindrances and banish evil,
Penetrate the fundamental principle,
Obtain the true Dharma,
Delve deeply into the essence,
And attain the highest vehicle?

Yet to master this mind,
One must again uphold the precepts while cultivating *mingxin* (冥心) and entering *ding* (定).
Reining in the horse with the bridle and whip,
Turning back the wind and extinguishing the flames.
When this mind’s unenlightened fire is quenched,
Then the water of forbearance may conquer it.
Transforming the raging flames into the wind of wisdom,
Changing unenlightenment into great knowledge.
Shifting evil causes into virtuous fruits,
Dissolving sorrow and resentment into joy and delight.
Rising above sound and color as fleeting dust,
Converting sloth and arrogance into reverence.

Without delusion or murkiness,
No confusion of right and wrong,
No battling between attachment and aversion,
No vacillation in coming and going,
No shifting in gain and loss—
Then naturally, *qi* settles and the mind grows still,
Mind still and *qi* settled,
And the scriptural refuge may be taken.

**Assemblage!**
Having now cultivated the power of *ding* (定),
To subdue this mind of congealed flesh and blood,
Then the winds and waves grow tranquil,
The waters smooth and the moon ascends,
Pearls radiate clarity, wisdom illuminates the scriptures,
And insight penetrates the teachings’ depths.
You must next take refuge in this *yi* (意).

This *yi* is yet more difficult to subdue than this mind—
The mind seeks rectitude, but *yi* lies in sincerity.
Sincerity is the state of *shenmi* (慎密).

*Ding* (定) is within this *shenmi* (慎密),
With clarity and distinctness,
No obstruction of light or shadow,
No duality, no cessation,
Motion and stillness in perfect harmony,
Illumination universal.

Thus, without taking refuge in *yi*,
Even the mind’s *ding* and stillness remain uncertain.
It secretly plots and seizes power,
Its schemes mechanical and deceitful;
Fantastic and delusive, it fluctuates wildly—
Sometimes present, sometimes gone.
Its machinations are manifold,
Swiftly vanishing, swiftly arising,
Like dragons or tigers in cunning guise.
Uncatchable as shadows or wind,
Though one may grasp at it,
It has no form to see.

A single spark can ignite a thousand *jun* (钧) of force,
A single drop can flood a thousand *hu* (斛) of water,
Its stratagems countless, its designs vast.
Its power unfathomable—
It can steal the day and deceive the heavens,
Its guile boundless.
Only after taking refuge in *yi* does it dissolve like water,
As if all things return to spring.

Then one may enter sainthood and attain truth,
Ascend to immortality and grasp the Dao.
In the mundane world, one may transform and guide,
Bringing peace to the realm and stability to the people,
Harmony to the seasons and abundance to the harvest,
And cultivate loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness.

The Three Bonds and Five Relationships arise from sincere *yi*,
The Nine Schools and Three Teachings manifest from sincere *yi*.
Between sincerity and insincerity,
Suffering and fortune, calamity and blessing,
All depend on this *yi*.
It is the cause of life and death,
The handle of rebirth and karmic retribution.

**Assemblage!**
If *yi* is not sincere before its stirrings,
The mind’s delusion remains unchecked—
Like stars following the Big Dipper’s pivot.
When *yi* is sincere,
One may seize the power of life and death.
When *yi* is insincere,
Who wields the reins of rebirth?

**Assemblage!**
Within your own mind lies the *yi*-Jewel,
A single thought of purity—
Above, it connects with the heavens,
Below, it reaches the underworld.
Ghosts and spirits lose their hue,
The sun and moon their luster,
Creation its authority,
Yin and yang their order,
Demons and fiends flee their traces,
All beings vanish—
All from this *yi*.

Within the Three Realms, *yi* alone reigns supreme.
Release it, and it exists;
Withdraw it, and it vanishes.
At will, it expands or contracts—
Nothing exceeds this *yi*.

*Yuanqi* (元始) as ancestral breath,
*Fangong* (梵空) as sacred essence,
*Taishang* (太上) as true breath,
*Haoji* (浩气) as boundless breath,
*Yuanqi* (元气) as condensed and harmonious breath,
*Yangqi* (阳气) as compassionate and benevolent breath,
*Yinqi* (阴气) as harsh and punitive breath,
*Xueqi* (血气) as violent and unrestrained breath,
*Yeqi* (邪气) as licentious, murderous, thieving, and false,
*Mogui* (魔气) as obstinate and obstructive,
*Yaogui* (妖气) as cruel and dark,
*Yuangui* (怨气) as oppressive and vengeful—
All arise from the **Assemblage!**

If the body does not take refuge in the Teacher-Jewel,
It will run wild with ferocity.
If the mind does not take refuge in the Scriptural-Jewel,
It will be mired in confusion and darkness.
If *yi* does not take refuge in the Dao-Jewel,
It will be entangled in myriad difficulties.

When *yi* is partial and insincere,
It loses the center—
Without the center, wisdom’s light does not shine,
*Ding*’s power is not firm,
Precepts are not strictly upheld,
The spirit cannot condense,
The *qi* cannot gather,
The essence cannot transform.

Thus, the body cannot be refined,
The mind cannot be still,
And *yi* cannot be sincere.

**Assemblage!**
Now I reveal the Great Dao,
Pointing directly to the human mind.
If you do not swiftly subdue the body, mind, and *yi*,
Transforming them into the true bodies of the Three Jewels,
And escape the cycle of rebirth,
Then even after taking refuge in the world’s enlightened teachers and scriptures,
You will have wasted this chance to leave home for good.

If there are those who uphold the Three Great Methods of precepts, *ding*, and wisdom,
With firm and unwavering faith,
And do not waver or regret,
Then know—
This person will certainly attain the Dao.»

「Even a slight deviation,
Unable to adhere,
And one’s own self slackness—
Know that this person
Has deep faults and scant virtue,
Cannot fathom the Dao,
Is rejected by heavenly deities,
How could they hear the peerless, supreme,
Most authentic, tranquil, and emancipating Way?

When encountering such individuals,
Be cautious not to scold or reproach,
Instead cultivate compassion,
Flexibility and expedient means,
Skillfully guide them to the Dao—
This is called taking refuge in the Three Jewels.

Thus, the precept disciples and others bowed in homage and took refuge,
And composed the following hymn:
*"The Great Dao is pure and void, beyond all naming,
Through scriptures its subtle mysteries are revealed in words.
If not for the Teacher’s exposition of the fundamental principles,
How could the muddled and deluded ever attain clarity?
Clarity, unbroken, is called Perfect Truth,
Perfectly grasping the True Essence, escaping life and death.
The enlightened and compassionate know well—
Endlessly guiding the virtuous to the path."*

**Threefold Confessions of Faults**

Great Assembly!
Having already taken refuge in the Three Jewels,
One must follow and uphold the wondrous conduct.

The *Tàishàng* says:
*"Misfortune and fortune have no gates,
Only summoned by oneself.
The retribution of good and evil,
Follows like shadow to form."*

Therefore, the deities of Heaven and Earth,
Who oversee transgressions,
Measure one’s crimes by their gravity,
And shorten one’s lifespan accordingly.
If the faults are trifling—
Even hundreds of petty deeds—
Those who seek longevity must first avoid them.
Faults are the transgressions themselves.

Now, practitioners of cultivation,
Who obscure their true nature,
Deceive their own essence,
See only others’ faults,
Yet fail to recognize their own errors—
This very ignorance of one’s own faults,
Already makes the guilt profound,
And the karma heavy indeed.

To deceive oneself and obscure the truth,
How could such a one enter the Dao?
Thus, confession is necessary.
Confession means:
With humble reverence before the Sacred and Authentic,
Daring not to conceal past wrongs,
Solemnly vowing to avoid repeating them—
Only then can one advance.

I do not shy from scolding or blame,
Now I plainly reveal to the world
Those who deceive themselves and obscure the truth.
Great Assembly, all listen well,
And you shall understand.

Now I speak of what constitutes self-deception and obscuring the truth:
With lofty rhetoric in their mouths,
Yet greedy for wealth and covetous of gain;
Externally feigning piety,
Internally scheming with deceitful plots;
Taking precepts yet not abiding by their laws,
Urging others without fear of their own faults;
Claiming to be Daoists in public,
Yet secretly consorting with the depraved;
Speaking falsely in assemblies,
And in public affairs always justifying themselves;
Hearing the Dao yet failing to practice it,
Knowing the Dharma yet deliberately transgressing;
Using clever stratagems to deceive the simple,
And seizing advantage as their foundation;
Habitually stirring up ignorance,
And often acting stubbornly;
Treating non-being as being,
And being as non-being;
Passing off falsehood as truth,
And truth as falsehood;
Pointing to a deer as a horse,
Or selling a dog while hanging a sheep;
Acting dishonest in secret,
And committing villainy under broad daylight;
Concealing malice in their smiles,
And harboring knives in their laughter.

All manner of perverse deeds,
Each and every one contrary to the Dao,
Yet none know their own faults.
The ignorant and foolish,
The deluded and reckless,
Do not know—
But those who know yet deliberately transgress,
Are called *evil and petty men.
Is this not self-deception and obscuring the truth?

Such offenders’ faults and karma
Are deeper and heavier than those of the ignorant and foolish.
Why so?
The ignorant and foolish,
Lacking wisdom,
Act in error without knowing—
They can only harm themselves,
Not others,
And if they harm others,
They are ultimately harmed by others.

But *evil men
Are treacherous and cunning,
Damaging others to benefit themselves,
And deceiving themselves to fool their own minds.
They seek to make Heaven and Earth unaware of their faults,
And the deities and spirits ignorant of their wickedness.
Through clever illusions and contrivances,
They always cloak their actions in excuses;
With deep scheming and hidden plots,
They bend and twist to cover their tracks.
They set traps for others,
Yet no one perceives their snares;
They push others into wells,
Yet no one can trace who dug the pit.

Such people exist in abundance in this world—
Yet cultivation cannot prevail against them.»

Before taking refuge in the Three Jewels,
If one harbored such thoughts,
Now that one has received the precepts,
Let them swiftly change and amend,
Seeking repentance without delay.

Of late, the vital *yuan* wind has faltered,
Precepts and disciplines have slackened,
The Dao’s transformative power has waned,
Yellow-crowned monks have strayed from teaching—
Again and again, those who claim instruction
Have frequently violated precepts and transgressed rules.

I now spare no effort in earnest admonition,
Urging the assembly with solemn warnings.
Not only must the karmic debts of countless past aeons be repented,
Nor only the sins owed to one’s parents across many lives—
Even the debts to one’s present parents and seven ancestral generations must be atoned.
Swiftly, with deepest resolve, purify the mind of past transgressions.
All unrighteous delusions,
Every slightest stray thought—
Must be confessed in their entirety,
Regretted in their fullness,
Only then may one attain the Dao’s essence.
Otherwise, it is like covering ears to steal a bell—
How could one hope for liberation?
The Great Way lies distant!

Now I compose this repentance and aspiration text,
That the assembly may recite it morning and evening.

**Text of Repentance and Aspiration**

We, the disciples of the assembly,
From the moment of receiving the precepts
Until this very day,
Have merely indulged in the hollow name of precept-taking,
Yet failed to uphold its true practice.

Our robes and bowls are tarnished by pretension,
Transmitted in vain.
We could not strive earnestly for the first truth,
Nor avoid the depths of grave offenses.
Lacking wisdom, we dared not question the enlightened teacher;
Our nature obscured by ignorance, we struggled to endure hardship among equals.
Our hearts narrow and constrained, unable to embrace compassion;
Our minds twisted and perverse, leading to repeated transgressions.
We mistook illusion for truth,
Failed to discern causes and effects,
Confusing thieves for sons.
We deemed the virtuous as outcasts—
Truth and falsehood became indistinguishable.
We took the noble for the base,
Unable to discern right from wrong.
At times, we misappropriated offerings meant for merit,
Squandering alms into private coffers;
At times, we recited scriptures with garbled words,
Our minds entirely detached from their meaning.
At times, we were stirred by fleeting beauty before our eyes,
Our lustful roots aroused;
At times, we heard sacred teachings yet harbored doubt within.
Endless corrupt deeds have cast us into the depths of mundanity.
If we do not now reform,
When the day of reckoning comes, we shall find ourselves at life’s end,
Doomed to sink like a stone into the sea’s depths.
If we persist in reckless ways,
Only when the hourglass runs out shall we realize the terrors of the sword-trees and knife-mountains.

Thus, we now, with feigned incense, lamps, and water offerings,
Pledge our bodies, our spirits, our very lives in sincerity.
At every moment, we humbly turn toward the celestial heights,
Seeking to preserve our fate;
Morning and evening, we earnestly aspire toward the golden palace,
Offering our devotion with utmost sincerity.
Through fasting and purification, we strive with unwavering piety,
Undeterred by toil and hardship.
We now turn back to seek the mercy of our teacher,
Setting forth offerings in supplication to the Heavenly Judge.

From this day forth, let all evils be utterly abandoned,
And may one forever become a person of virtue and goodness.
Henceforth, let one strive with vigor to serve the True One,
And earnestly uphold the precepts of the Original Truth.

Should one transgress these laws again,
In life, one shall suffer heavenly retribution;
In death, one shall fall into the *Fengdu* abyss.
If one violates the decrees of the Sun’s judgment,
In daylight, one shall endure the utmost punishment;
In darkness, one shall be buried in the *Wujian* pit.

Yet may it be that after repentance,
Guilt be extinguished and blessings arise,
Calamities dispersed and misfortunes released,
As ice melts and enlightenment dawns,
And the obscured moon regains its radiance.
The darkened lacquer chamber restored to clarity,
The wisdom-sun shining through the night;
The sprouts of goodness growing anew,
Sweet dew nourishing the withered branches.

May the boundless compassion of the Original Dao’s renewal
And the law’s abundant rain revive all things with its grace.
Thus may one’s black records be erased,
And one’s name inscribed upon the celestial tablets.

Through profound cultivation and steadfastness,
May the True Body be preserved and secured.
The eight consciousnesses diminished,
A hundred obstacles and myriad demons cleansed away;
The three lifetimes illuminated,
Ascending on the nine clouds to the seven ancestors.

May the divine wind carry far,
And the ten thousand *qi* currents flourish.
Let the lineage’s teachings flourish grandly,
And its branches extend from the ancestral seat.

In both action and concealment, may fortune unfold,
And in seclusion and revelation, may peace prevail—
As the sun and moon rest within the caldron.
May teacher and disciples study together,
Relatives and kin of the lineage,
All beings of the earth and the heavens’ devotees,
Each heart enlightened, each nature radiant with clarity.

May the seasons be harmonious, the winds gentle,
The land prosperous, the people at ease.
May arms lay down, and water and fire find balance.
May the imperial plans be fortified,
The sovereign’s rule extend in splendor.
May the august emperor’s reign endure,
And ministers be virtuous and wise.
May all the people unite in sincerity,
And the myriad realms rejoice in the Dao.

Together with all living beings,
May all return to purity and tranquility.

Humbly, we pray for the sacred mercy
To descend in salvation and deliverance.

Above, the **Confession and Aspiration Text** is to be recited devoutly morning and evening.
One must, with one’s own **Dharmakāya**, before the **Emperor of Heaven**, in every thought, surrender sincerely—
with every heartfelt remorse, each utterance clear and resonant,
each syllable repented with trembling resolve,
and press forward with fierce, unwavering determination.

Life and death, existence and annihilation,
suffering, hardship, hunger, and cold—
all must be relinquished without hesitation.
Only by holding fast to **precepts and concentration** shall one secure one’s path forward.

---
**Scripture of the Jade Terrace, Volume Four: On Severing Obstacles**
For those who practice, if obstacles are not severed,
they are blocked and plunged into darkness.
If hindrances are not removed,
they remain dull and obscured.

The true nature of the mind is as boundless as heaven and earth,
yet deluded emotions drift like fleeting clouds.
When mist shrouds the azure sky, how can the sun’s brilliance shine?
When passions cloud the sacred faculties, how can the true principle unfold?
Is this not the great affliction of the practitioner?

Now I reveal the root of these obstacles.
The **Dao** speaks of two kinds: **obstacles of principle** and **obstacles of action**.
If one does not grasp their nature, truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished;
if one does not grasp their essence, right and wrong cannot be discerned.
If one clings to principle while neglecting action, one becomes rigid and dull—
this is the **obstacle of principle** in the heart.
If one acts while harming principle, one becomes perverse and distorted—
this is the **obstacle of action**, corrupting one’s nature.
Whether in principle or action, any attachment becomes an obstacle.

Now I explain these two terms in detail.
Honored assembly, countless scriptures and teachings exist,
all from the enlightened and wise of old,
seeking to guide later generations
to do good and learn virtue,
to awaken to the **Dao** and cultivate the true self.
Yet beings do not do good but instead do evil,
do not learn virtue but instead learn vice,
do not cultivate the true but instead feign it,
do not awaken to the **Dao** but instead betray it—
this is the **obstacle of action** in one’s original nature.

Again, there are monastic practitioners
who do good yet cling to goodness,
learn virtue yet cling to virtue,
cultivate the true yet fixate on its form,
awaken to the **Dao** yet become ensnared by its traces—
all because they have not transcended their attachments.
This is called the **obstacle of principle** in one’s original nature.

Yet even these two—obstacles of principle and action—
are still afflictions of those striving upward.
There is another kind of practitioner
whose mind remains unenlightened,
whose divine potential has not yet turned.
Wherever they go, obstacles arise.
Seeing those who strive upward
preach scriptures or uphold precepts,
they may outwardly praise them
while secretly stirring **delusion**,
generating an **obstacle of the heart** and **deluded thoughts**.

Honored assembly, if this **obstacle of the heart** is not severed,
how can one escape the sea of suffering?
Though there are boats and rafts,
sails and oars—
though the path across the sea is clear—
one still does not dare to cross, cannot cross.
Why is this?

It is because this **obstacle of the heart**
is like a sudden storm cloud rising in the sky,
darkening all before it,
threatening wind and rain,
summoning monstrous waves and fierce tides—
thus one does not dare to cross, cannot cross.

Honored assembly, the sea of suffering is boundless,
but turning back is the shore.
The practitioner’s obstacles
are like black clouds surging upward,
a deceitful omen concealing the heavens.
Only when they are severed
does the sea grow calm, the winds still,
and one attains ease and freedom—
then, and only then, can one cross to the other shore.

Have you not heard it said in the *Scripture of the Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*?
*"Because beings bear heavy obstacles,
they cannot behold the Emperor’s merciful countenance."*
And again:
*"All these obstacles—
you must each sever them."*

Thus the **Imperial Scripture** begins by proclaiming the severing of obstacles.
The method to sever them is to cultivate **great wisdom**,
to abandon all doubt, all greed and anger,
all lust, all jealousy and malice,
all worldly thoughts and worldly musings,
all dullness and filth,
all attachment to sounds and forms,
all quarrels of right and wrong,
all hatred and love,
all discrimination,
all arrogance and fixation.

Concentrate the spirit, purify the mind—
let all passions submit.
Let the heart be as boundless space,
pure within and without.
Receive all without exclusion,
admit all without resistance.
Do not let external evils disrupt the **True Path**,
lure you from the **True Teaching**,
corrupt your **sacred root**,
or steal your **precious essence**.
Otherwise, you shall for ten thousand kalpas
sink into the mundane realm,
fall into the snares of the world,
be assailed by myriad demons,
suffer countless kalpas without hearing the **wonderful dharma**,
be punished by ghosts and spirits,
and wander from birth to death.

Therefore, you must resolve with determination
to safeguard the **True Teaching**,
lest it be lost.
As previously stated,
each must sever these obstacles—
for these are the very conditions of **obstacles**.

If they are not severed,
the six senses will be defiled,
the three actions will ensnare you,
and you shall never attain **tranquility**.
If you do not attain **tranquility**,
how can you behold the Emperor’s merciful countenance?
How can you attain the **Seventeen Radiant Lights** or the **Thirty Virtues**?

For the Emperor’s radiant virtues and merits
are the domain of all **Buddhas and Holy Teachers**,
the **Imperial Masters of Heaven**.
The **three volumes and five categories** of wondrous scriptures
all arise from severing obstacles.

Honored assembly, the obstacles of the world are countless.
The **Imperial Scripture** merely outlines their general forms,
so you may grasp their essence and understand the **Dao’s** path.

You must realize:
the subtle obstacles of the world
are myriad and countless—
every thought, every impulse,
too numerous to enumerate.
For instance, when reading scriptures or reciting texts,
their profound meanings are deep and hidden.
Since your own wisdom is limited,
you cannot fathom them—
thus you know your **mind’s faculties** are not yet awakened,
your **wisdom-light** is still dim.

Yet you refuse to humble yourself,
to question the enlightened—
this is **filth**.
And when you do ask,
you still harbor doubts,
fearing the speaker’s words may not be true.
You question another,
yet their answers differ—
your heart fills with vexation,
branching into countless contradictions.
Is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, if you study with companions,
and they recite fluently while you lag behind,
your mind grows agitated—
is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, if my companions are skilled while I am not,
I grow elated—
is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, if I possess talent while others are dull,
I take pride in deceiving them—
is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, when I see others practice virtue—
whether in giving, or in meritorious deeds—
if they are rich while I am poor,
I harbor resentment;
if I am rich while they are destitute,
I swell with arrogance—
is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, when reading scriptures,
suddenly grasping a truth,
dimly illuminating its principle,
I cling to it as absolute,
then teach it to others—
yet they surpass me in insight,
and my heart refuses to submit—
is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, if I fixate on heard truths,
grasping only one perspective,
unable to adapt—
is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, in meditation,
encountering fleeting insight,
I boast of my attainment—
is this not an **obstacle**?

Again, when studying with companions under a teacher,
the teacher declares their understanding surpasses mine,
yet I blame them instead of reflecting on myself—
is this not an **obstacle**?

And when death approaches,
clinging to even a single coin—
all attachments,
greed, and indulgence,
unbroken, unsevered—
whether in love of music, books,
chess, or painting—
all are **obstacles**.

Some cling to talismans as divine power,
others dismiss them as crude arts—
when one approves and the other scorns,
this too is an **obstacle**.

Assembly,
if you seek liberation,
to escape the wheel of rebirth,
you must cultivate the **Dao** of the transcendent,
nurture the practice of the world-transcending.
These **obstacles** are but snares
that block the **Dao’s** luminous gate,
and delusions that cloud the radiant nature.

How then can you attain liberation?

If you resolve to sever each tangled root,
dispel all distractions,
cleanse the mind to boundless openness—
then clarity flows freely,
endless and luminous,
and wisdom arises spontaneously.
The natural essence shines forth,
revealing the harmony of life and death,
of heaven and humanity.

Effortless, beyond recognition—
*Ha!*

**Obstacles, obstacles!**
They lie only in whether the assembly can sever or cannot sever them.

Then the Dharma Master expounded thus:
*"When humility begins, the command of life is not in vain.
Illuminating the spirit’s hallowed ground, no speck can obscure it.
Once the chest opens to boundless clarity,
the vision clears and stands firm."*

The afflictions of the Five Aggregates are severed—
Assembly, the harm of **obstacles** you now know.
Yet the harm of **affectionate attachments** is far more severe.
How do you see this?

The harm of **obstacles** arises only when met with circumstances;
when circumstances pass, it vanishes—
its harm comes and goes in fleeting moments.

As for the two characters **"affectionate attachments" (爱缘)**,
they are the karmic roots sown from the beginningless kalpas
even unto this very life.
Thus, sages, immortals, and Buddhas alike
only urge beings: *"Do not cling to forms,
do not bind yourselves,
do not indulge in craving."*
In the scriptures of the Three Teachings,
they all exhort all under heaven, generation after generation,
not to be ensnared by **affectionate attachments**.

This **affectionate attachment** is the progenitor of all demons,
the root of ten thousand harms.
Through countless kalpas, it has plunged beings into delusion,
causing them to fall again and again—
all due to **affectionate attachment**.
The path to liberation is not found,
the truth of emptiness is not understood—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.
To suffer punishment in life,
to sink into hell in death—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.
To perish in floods or flames,
to be slain by calamity or blade—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.
To destroy one’s lineage and vows,
to violate precepts and transgress rules—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.
To bring ruin upon nine generations,
to extinguish ancestral rites—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.
To endure aging, sickness, and death,
to see one’s nature and mind perverted,
one’s body frail,
one’s progress in the Dao/Way and Dharma obstructed—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.
To have the Six Senses impure,
the Six Thieves rampant,
the Six Consciousnesses discriminating,
the Six Realms of rebirth unending—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.

Within heaven and earth,
among the Five Phases,
in the rise and fall of all things,
in every birth and decay—
all because of **affectionate attachment**.

If you wish to transcend the world,
to escape life and death,
to seek neither severance nor abandonment of **affectionate attachments**,
yet to attain clarity so bright,
purity so profound,
liberation so free—
this has never been seen.

I now speak of the **affectionate attachments** of laypeople—
the ruler’s subjects, father’s children, husband’s wife,
brothers, friends, and kin—
as the ancients have already described:
the Five *Yǒu* (有), Five *Zhǐ* (止), and Five *Pì* (僻),
as well as the virtues of harmonious growth,
filial piety, and honoring the worthy.
All these arise from the very essence of that **affectionate attachment**,
which, when properly ordered,
brings the cosmos into unity with the *Tàihé* (太和).
Mingling with the primordial *qi*,
no **affectionate attachment** remains to be abandoned or severed—
the pure Dao/Way of natural tranquility and liberation
I will speak of gradually.

Now I speak only of those who have left home—
that is, the lay devotees gathered here today—
and urge you to discard all extraneous **affectionate attachments**.
As for those within your proper sphere,
do not love what may be loved,
but examine all **affectionate attachments** that seem to have limits,
one by one, and restrain them.
Assembly, you are utterly unaware of the delusion **affectionate attachments** bring.
How do I say this?
The mind’s impulse to delight—
this is **affectionate attachment**.
All coarse and fine, great and small things;
all distant and near, relatives and acquaintances—

「All affairs of inner and outer defilements, errors, and right/wrong distinctions;
all teachings of the sages and the three *Dao* traditions—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—*dharma* and methods of the *sutras*, scriptures, literary works, and music;
all subtle principles of Heaven and Earth, *yin* and *yang*, creation and transformation;
all marvelous techniques of divine and extraordinary *qi* and illusory phenomena;
all paths of Pure Clarity, Spiritual Treasure, and Perfect Truth—Daoists of the highest refinement.

Even the sacred mountains and hidden grottoes,
the celestial palaces and holy realms,
the seven treasures and eight delicacies,
the River Chart and Tortoise Scriptures—
and one’s own body and mind: the five *zàng* organs and six *fǔ* viscera,
the teeth and tongue, vital *qi* and essence,
the rivers and mountains, the vast earth,
the grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and insects—
if they are the objects of one’s craving,
the focus of one’s intentions,
the subject of one’s thoughts,
the convergence of one’s spirit-*qi*,
the longing of one’s emotions,
the delight of one’s nature,
the desires of one’s mouth,
the pleasures of one’s body,
the wanderings of one’s dreams—
all these are **affectionate attachments**.

A single lingering thought
brings entanglement and distraction,
preventing one from attaining the Dao/Way of pure tranquility and liberation,
dooming one to perpetual immersion in sorrow and suffering.

Assembly, when lost in delusion, **affectionate attachments** arise;
when awakened, they cease.
You must cultivate awareness at every moment,
take responsibility in every instant—
for even the slightest trace of attachment in the heart,
all must be abandoned immediately,
and the cycle of *pratītyasamutpāda* must not be allowed to persist.

If one delights in sleep, one must sit;
if one delights in sitting, one must walk.
If one delights in renunciation,
the mind and spirit naturally become lively;
if one delights in emptiness,
the spiritual essence naturally becomes void.

Not a thread of clinging remains,
nor do myriad **affectionate attachments** arise.
The awakened one’s heart shines with clarity,
unmoved by sensory conditions,
undisturbed by objects,
unshaken by affairs.
With time, one reaches the boundless marvelous state—
the primordial orifice opens wide.

If today you do not eliminate them,
tomorrow you do not sever them,
if you abandon yet do not cut them off,
they still ensnare you.
Then even your robes, alms bowl, and meditation cushion
become nets of delusion;
your straw sandals and bamboo staff
turn into bonds of illusion;
sacred mountains and holy realms
are but prisons;
teacher and fellow Daoists
become adversaries.

Even the incantations and true words
become poisonous arsenic;
the innate Dao-heart
is transformed into the fate of a *mara*-like demon of retribution.

Is this not a warning?
Is this not a cause for pain?
Is this not a matter of resolute abandonment?

Once there was a Daoist recluse
who sat long and his spirit manifested.
He saw a radiant light atop his head,
five-colored and vivid,
like clouds or brocade.
Within that light,
mountains, rivers, and the vast earth,
all things were visible.
The recluse rejoiced in his heart,
believing he had attained the boundless light of the Supreme Sage.
Day and night he sat upright,
fixating on the thought of light,
and the light no longer appeared.
The recluse, unaware that the illusory realm was not true,
focused his intentions and meditations,
forgetting all else,
only contemplating the luminous clarity.
His fixation endured for days,
until he became dull and senseless,
his form rigid as wood and clay.
Others thought he had entered the highest Dao.
He sat in meditation for six years,
his *qi* condensed, his form altered,
yet he remained unaware.

One day, his breath grew coarse,
his pulse frantic.
His companions, watching over him,
only hoped he would emerge from his trance
so they might continue their practice.
Among them, one *chúshī*—a disciplined practitioner—
knew he was possessed by a demon.
At midnight,
the recluse in his meditative state
suddenly flung his hands as if in flight.
The others, with lamps, incense, and flowers,
offered reverence and worship.
The recluse then expired,
and from his mouth flew a moth,
which struck the lamp’s flame and perished.
The disciplined practitioner took it
and declared to the assembly of Daoists:
“This is the body of the Daoist
who fixated on the luminous light—
his **affectionate attachment** to light
made him one with the moth.
When **affectionate attachments** reach their limit,
the form transforms into another kind.
If **affectionate attachments** are not eliminated,
all will meet this fate.
Is this not pitiful?
Is this not a cause for severance?”

Assembly, when the heart has attachments,
they are **affectionate attachments**.
**Affectionate attachments** arise from delight,
delight follows **affectionate attachments**,
**affectionate attachments** and delight entwine,
with no end in sight.
Father becomes son,
ancestor turns into grandson,
male shifts to female,
faces and forms change,
names and surnames swap,
and ordinary beings are turned upside down,
taken for reality—
terrifying and pitiable!

Assembly, know this well.
Observe the Six Precepts with utmost precision.»

「Aspiring practitioners, having already severed love and cast aside **affectionate attachments**, earnestly seek liberation from the world to escape the cycle of birth and death. If **affectionate attachments** are not extinguished and lustful desires resurge, then this heart remains ensnared as before, again falling into the nets and pits of bondage—forever without deliverance.

One must, before any signs appear, take preemptive measures to guard against them. Otherwise, all prior efforts will be in vain, and future obstacles from demonic forces will be unavoidable.

Thus, the ancient sages of the Dao/Way confined the heart to **precepts**. This **precept**—
is the pestle to subdue demons, able to crush malevolent spirits;
is the talisman to safeguard life, able to prolong fortune and longevity;
is the ladder to ascend the heavens, able to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones and transcend the mundane to attain sainthood;
is the guiding lamp, able to dispel the Six Desires and pierce through darkness and delusion;
is the celestial vessel and precious raft, able to ferry all beings away from the sea of suffering;
is the compassionate ferry and bridge, able to rescue all beings from the river of **affectionate attachments**.

It is indeed the safeguard of the practitioner and the outline for advancing the Dao/Way. The path to the Dao/Way has no gate—all enter through **precepts**; the way of the sage has no road—all proceed through observance of **precepts**.

In truth, it is the vital thoroughfare for the Dao/Way’s adept and the direct path for the wise.

Assembly, since the **karmic seeds** of your past lives have brought you to hear the **precepts** in this life, you have encountered an immense fortune. If you fail to uphold the **precepts** with utmost precision, diligent effort, and steadfast perseverance, this immense fortune will become an immense sin.

These **precepts** are the fundamental prohibitions of the Primordial Capital, the ordinances established by the Primordial Beginning’s Sacred Treasure, the Supreme Sovereign. They are the regulations constantly enforced by the Lady of the Celestial Azure, attended by divine soldiers and celestial marshals.

Those who honor them are rewarded with **cinnabar talismans** and merit enhancement. Those who violate them are recorded in **black ledgers** and face retribution.»

The slightest detail must not be overlooked, the finest thread must not be missed.

Now, those who receive the precepts are but ignorant folk. How so? Simply because they do not grasp the principle. If one truly understands this principle, one must uphold the precepts with utmost precision and never violate them. If one transgresses the rules, is that not ignorance?

Thus, among the assembly, those who have already taken the precepts must earnestly examine the meaning of *precepts*. How does one practice precepts? Precepts mean restraint—restraint of what? And why did you take them in the first place? If you have come for the precepts, then you must practice them daily. If you do not practice them daily, why take them at all? If your intention is not to uphold the precepts but merely to gain the hollow name of a Daoist—seeking only the robe and bowl of ordination—then you are not truly here for the precepts.

Why else would you not observe the pure rules? Truly consider this: since the Seven Sages revealed the teachings of the Dao, the transmission of the Way has declined. For four hundred years, the precepts and rituals have not shone forth in the world, for within the teaching there was no one to bear this responsibility. Thus, the luminous lamp of the Dao, meant to illuminate the path, has not been polished. Those who practice walk in darkness, their supporting staff abandoned, their grip lost.

It is no wonder that heterodox sects flourish across the land, while the pure, tranquil, and enlightened Way of true liberation remains unheard. Now, fortunately, the Dao’s time has come, and we live in an age of prosperity. Above, the Emperor’s blessings protect; below, the land is at peace. The court is filled with virtuous officials who uphold the faith, and within the teaching, protectors of the law stand firm.

Again, there are lay devotees who make offerings—clothing, robes, and alms bowls—crafted and ready for use. This is a rare fortune, a chance encounter across lifetimes, all stemming from your past karmic connections.

Since you have received the precepts, you must now earnestly seek the meaning of *戒* (precepts). How does one call this *戒*?

Alas, those who take the precepts differ in wisdom and folly. The foolish may begin with sincere intentions, but once they receive the precepts, they abandon their original resolve in darkness, failing to uphold the discipline. How tragic to see the purity of their initial vow—those sacred robes, that ceremonial scarf—cast into the Eastern Sea, sold, repurposed into common garments, or patched into sleeves. They profane the divine, defiling the sacred hall. They turn the pure alms bowl into an incense burner, storing money or rice within. They break their fasts, violate their vows, drink wine, eat meat without restraint, extinguishing their wisdom and severing their path to transcendence.

There are living cases to prove this. Once, a monk destroyed his precepts, defiled the *戒经* (Precept Scripture), sold his robes and alms bowl, then died suddenly. Ghostly officers seized him with chains. In the underworld, he saw a grand hall, its doors flanked by ranks of ghostly officers, binding countless former companions—all broken preceptists who had died in their transgressions.

The monk trembled and asked, *"How did you come here?"*
The others replied, *"We do not know why, but we have all gathered here, one after another."*

Above the gate hung a plaque: *考对司* (Examination Bureau). He asked the ghostly officers, *"What is this Examination Bureau?"*
They answered, *"This is a newly established heavenly decree. There are two judicial halls overseeing monastic and Daoist precepts. Whoever in the mortal world takes the precepts has their name recorded by the Earth Deities. On this day, they received the precepts; on that day, they upheld them with merit; on another, they committed offenses. This one violated the precepts, that one betrayed the Dao and defied the teacher. This one sold his robes, that one defiled his bowl. This one slandered the precept masters, that one harmed donors. This one was greedy, that one indulged in lust—all recorded in detail. Each month, the records are submitted to the respective bureaus for examination. Only after passing this bureau’s scrutiny may one proceed to other halls. Those who uphold the precepts with virtue and strict resolve need not appear here. But those like you, who never took the precepts, will first be examined and expelled from the records before your scheduled death is enforced. If you fail this bureau’s review, no other hall will accept you."*

Listen, fellow preceptists—this monk who died has already returned for half a day, recounting this truth.

You may criticize others’ faults with clarity, yet when your own failings arise, you turn a blind eye, accumulating sins day by day, granting yourself endless pardons while hiding them—this is called *欺心* (self-deception). Those who have taken the precepts must scrutinize their every thought, word, and deed. If wrong, correct it immediately. Do not excuse yourself. Do not forgive yourself. If you err and have not yet reflected, repent humbly before the Sacred Truth, confessing sincerely according to the *戒经*’s laws. Study diligently with a wise teacher, delving into profound teachings.

Revere your masters as parents, your fellow practitioners as elder brothers, the *dharma* as a beloved spouse, and the scriptures as precious jade. Hold the precepts in your heart as you would an object in your hand—let it slip, and they are lost. The world’s laws punish transgressions with punishment; the heavenly *Dao*’s *女青之律* (Laws of the Azure Maiden) demand retribution.

Do not think the underworld is unseen—life and death unfold within your mind. Do not think the precept deities are hidden—they manifest in your every thought.

*戒行精严* (Precept conduct must be precise and strict):
- *降心顺道* (Subdue the heart, align with the Way) is called *戒* (precept).
- *忍耐行持* (Patience and steadfast practice) is called *行* (conduct).
- *一丝不杂* (Not the slightest impurity) is called *精* (refinement).
- *一毫不犯* (No transgression, not even a hair’s breadth) is called *严* (strictness).
- *始终不变* (Unchanging from start to finish) is called *持戒* (upholding precepts).
- *穷困不移* (Unshaken even in hardship) is called *守戒* (defending precepts).

You who have taken the precepts—do you even remember the ten essentials of *戒*? To have the name but not the substance is meaningless! Yet there is one teaching to assure you all: *"Hold fast to the precepts with sincerity."*

This celestial sovereign, by nature, takes compassion for life as his heart, boundless in mercy and salvation for all beings. If one has transgressed the precepts but thereafter repents with genuine sincerity, reaffirms the rules, and strives for utmost strictness and refinement—never daring to offend again—then through such heartfelt contrition, the Heavenly Will itself takes pity and grants absolution, restoring one to the original state.

Now, I have another account of cause and effect for those who break the precepts and then uphold them, to share with all of you.

A monk once confessed: *"After receiving the precepts, I suddenly fell into calamity. During the fast, I broke my vows, committing every sin imaginable. One night, I dreamed of the Underworld, where I witnessed the judicial proceedings. I saw countless ghostly judges, each holding a paper lantern, arranging incense tables. Soon, the King of Hell emerged from the grand gate, his majesty resembling that of an earthly emperor. I heard the judge report, 'The Heavenly Messenger has arrived—quickly prepare the incense tables to receive the edict, just as in the mortal world.' Then I saw the Heavenly Messenger, a celestial official, wearing a golden lotus crown, draped in a five-cloud crane robe, holding a yellow scroll, and entering inside. The ghosts were barred from following.*

*I, too, wished to enter. A ghostly guard shouted, 'What wandering spirit are you, daring to intrude upon this solemn hall?' Another guard said, 'He looks like a monk in disguise.' The ghost replied, 'The edict clearly states that those who practiced and upheld the precepts may enter in full ceremonial attire upon death—those with radiance enter through the main gate, those with lesser light through the east gate, and those without light are stripped of their monastic name, shackled outside the western gate, and summoned for judgment by their records. But you, monk, have no radiance—just a mass of dark qi, indistinguishable from us. You presume to pass as a monk! Begone, begone!' He seized an iron rod toward me.*

*The monk awoke in terror, remembering it all clearly."*

The monk immediately turned over, descended from the bed, and in haste cleansed his face. He took the pure flame to burn incense, seized with great terror, sorrow, and repentance, he bitterly lamented his past deeds and strictly observed the precepts.

Again, he dreamed of wandering through the **Yámù** (阎府), returning to the very place he had visited before. He saw the ghostly guards wielding iron rods and chains, rushing forward to ask, *"What is your esteemed title, and where are you bound?"* The monk replied, *"I came here as a wandering ascetic, not daring to disturb the great king. I shall return immediately."* The guard said, *"The great king has a rule: all ascetics of virtue and radiance who pass must first go to the tea hall, sit down, and state their name and register for inspection."* The monk answered, *"I have no official business here, so I shall not stay."* He turned to leave, but suddenly found himself outside the realm. Upon waking, he told all this to the assembly.

In the first dream, he was beaten and scolded by the ghosts; in the second, he knelt to be questioned about his name. This was but one mind’s advance and retreat, yet it met with two different judgments. If not for his repentance and return to his former self, he would have remained as he was. **Seeing spirits as the Dao**, the principle of dark and light is one—why should one fear?

Assembly, time passes swiftly, but the heart must remain radiant. Do not wait for the **impermanence** (無常) to arrive, nor act in the dark halls of the **underworld** (陰司). **Niútóu** (牛頭) offers no refuge, nor does **Màmiàn** (馬面) show mercy. If you have faults, change them swiftly; all depends on the precision of your precepts.

Within the myriad **dharma** (法) and thousand gates, cultivating the mind is the supreme path. Like an endless sea without shore or edge, follow the **precepts and wisdom** (戒慧) to attain radiance.

**Seven: Enduring Insults and Subduing the Heart**
The greatest affliction of the cultivator, the hardest to remove and rectify, is the **anger** (嗔) within. It is not the attachment to *my* form, nor to *others’* form—when the mind of anger stirs, it is called the **fire of ignorance** (無明業火). Among the three poisons, the poison of anger ranks first. If the mind of anger is not extinguished, internally it burns oneself; if angered words are spoken, externally it burns others. It consumes the **soul’s vital gate** (靈關), reducing it to embers; it scorches the **Dharma-body** (法身), destroying it utterly. The six **organs** (六腑) cannot be cleansed, nor the five **viscera** (五臟) harmonized. When one hears insults against oneself, the fire of anger rises from the liver; when fierce winds fan the flames, the very ears that can hear are suddenly shut as if by closed windows and sealed openings. When one sees others insult oneself, the fire of anger springs from the kidneys; when fierce winds fan the flames, the very eyes that can see are suddenly obscured as if by barred doors and blocked paths. Even if the tongue does not speak angry words, the mind surges with vexation, and the gallbladder swells with malicious schemes. One fears neither the gods of heaven and earth, nor the fate of life and death; one does not dread the **oil cauldron** (油鍋) and **sword trees** (劍樹) of the underworld, nor the punishments of beheading, strangulation, or exile. Yet one turns the very tongue that can speak into a source of countless sins.

Why does this tongue, these ears, these eyes suffer such torment? It is because this **fleshly heart** (肉團心) cannot be subdued, relying on mere **vital breath and blood** (氣血) to act in arrogance and tyranny. When one later attains a tranquil mind, all becomes cold and indifferent.

Assembly, the bodies of all beings in this world are but **clusters of vital breath and blood** (血氣結成). This seed of anger has been planted since the beginningless kalpas; the **fire of ignorance** (無明業火) was sown long ago. Thus, when events align with the heart’s desires, one rejoices. If they do not, one’s joy turns into resentment. When the world’s phenomena clash with the heart’s will, anger arises—this is the root of **endless rebirth** (輪迴). You have left home to seek the **extinction of birth and death** (了生死); if the root of anger persists, the **poisonous dragon** (毒龍) will invade the **heavenly root** (天根). You seek to escape the **worldly net** (世網), yet your **life-force** (性命) is heavy with causes. If this anger and hatred do not cease, it will lead to **vital breath filling the moon’s abyss** (氣填月窟). Nature is inherently good, but anger transforms it into a **poisonous dragon**; habitual anger ignites the fire that consumes the body. Life-force is inherently eternal, but anger turns it into a **fierce tiger**; constant anger breeds **poisonous vital breath**, which, when intense, extinguishes the true self.

Ignorance of birth and death stems from failing to cherish one’s **life-force**; the **life-force** not being established comes from the **fire’s strength**. Thus the six **senses** (六根) cannot be restrained, the limbs tremble in vain, the five **faculties** (五官) fail to function properly, and the **fire of the pores** (毛竅) flares wildly, causing countless harms and shortening life.

Assembly, to extinguish anger, first subdue the **evil thoughts**. What are **evil thoughts**? They are the inability to endure insults. The Great Sage **Confucius** (孔子) taught: *"Be gentle and yielding in your instruction; do not repay injury with wrongdoing."* If the heart cannot endure, and the thought lingers even for a day, one remains a day of evil. How can an evil person enter the **Dao**?

Assembly, those who cannot endure insults have hearts that cannot be subdued. They are like **poisonous dragons** and **fierce tigers**, knowing only how to insult others, never allowing themselves to be insulted. They are **overbearing**, **competitive**, and **boastful**, demanding attention before others, acting in tyranny, and speaking harshly. They **sell their heroism**, **pose as mighty warriors**, **covet gain and flaunt reputation**, **boast of their strength and oppress the weak**, **disdain the elderly and bully the young**. Though sometimes they act with **zeal for others**, they do not realize that such actions can save people as easily as they can destroy them.

Since beings are deluded and do not awaken, how could they ever consider the distant consequences? The **Heavenly Path** (天道) is far-reaching; grudges and resentments never dissolve—all comes from the **unbroken root of anger**.

Anger seeks only to insult others; it cannot bear to be insulted itself. One does not realize that **being insulted by others** and **insulting others** are vastly different.

Assembly, the meaning of **insult** (辱) is vast. If one defiles another’s wife or concubine, one does not consider the insult to her husband, her children, her ancestors, or her entire clan. But when others defile *your* wife or concubine, anger arises, and great evil follows. One thinks: *"How could this person defile my wife or concubine? Where is my dignity now? If others know, it is not just me who will be shamed—my parents’ and ancestors’ **virtue and merit** (功德), my children’s and descendants’ **family reputation** (門風), will all be ruined and destroyed. How can I let this pass?"*

Then one immediately seizes knives and clubs, kindles rage, and stirs murderous intent—no longer considering that *he* insulted *me*, yet *I* repay him thus.

I did not insult him—how then could he insult me? If in this life my wife and daughters are defiled by others, it is certain that in a past life I committed evil deeds. In a former existence, I defiled others’ wives and daughters, so in this life my own are defiled. This is the cause and effect inherent in humanity.

You all must heed these words and never stir the heart of lust. I speak plainly to the assembly: the lives of these people all arise from lust. As long as lustful desire is not eradicated, the root of birth and death remains unsevered.

Because of lust, the colored body exists. To escape the colored body, one must purge desire. Once desire is extinguished, within the perishable colored body, the Dharma-body emerges—only then can one transcend birth and death. These are our true words; do not dismiss them as idle chatter.

Recently, there was a monk under precepts, a man who in daily life held deep Dao-practice, yet suddenly one day he went to solicit alms-food and passed by a rice shop.

The shopkeeper’s master took delight in the Dao and joyfully invited the precept-holder inside, seating him in the central hall. He bowed and offered alms, then placed a small portion of broken rice—a single *qian*—into the alms bowl. As the precept-holder prepared to leave the hall, he suddenly encountered the shopkeeper’s wife passing through the corridor. Their eyes met; she could not avoid him, and the precept-holder declined the alms and departed.

That night, while meditating, his mind wandered to the wife. He imagined her face, and in his reverie, he arose, knelt before the incense altar, confessed his transgression, and lay down again. Suddenly, he felt himself dying, reborn into the womb, growing into a man who took a wife—fair of face, harmonious in union. Walking along the road, he saw a Daoist begging for alms, and his heart rejoiced. He brought the Daoist home, offered alms as merit, and called his wife to meet him, bowing in submission.

Turning, he saw the Daoist gesture toward his wife, and his anger flared instantly. He rushed into the kitchen, seized a cleaver, and lunged to strike the Daoist. His foot caught, he stumbled awake—seething with rage—only to realize it was a dream, his body drenched in sweat. Reflecting on the Daoist’s face, it was the rice-shop owner who had given alms; the wife was the one he had encountered in the corridor.

**Assembly**, this precept-holder, though newly practicing, had firm precepts but unstable concentration. Thus, day and night his thoughts wandered, and delusive visions arose, deepening into dreamlike illusions.

Another practitioner, steadfast in precepts, had never spoken falsely, nor let his mind stray. Though insulted, he harbored no resentment; though struck, he did not retaliate; though reviled, he offered no reply. He only reflected on his own faults, never blaming others. One day, carrying a burden along the road, he encountered a galloping donkey. He stepped aside, but the donkey reared, striking him with its head. He could not evade it and fell to the ground. The donkey bit his clothes, tearing them before trotting away.

That night, as he meditated, his mind grew hazy. Suddenly, a white-clad figure appeared, bowing and saying, *“I am the donkey that struck you on the road. In a past life, we had unresolved karmic debt. Now that debt is released, and we are both freed from suffering. From this life onward, we shall be reborn among humans. I come to tell you: on the *such-and-such* day of the next month, meet me at *such-and-such* place to aid your liberation.”* With these words, the figure vanished.

The practitioner saw and heard this clearly—neither dream nor waking—then resumed his meditation as usual. On the appointed day of the following month, he went to the place. The household was filled with joy, as if celebrating good fortune. Asking others, he learned that the family had given birth to a child that night. The practitioner was struck with terror, memorized the name, and vowed to first liberate himself before aiding others.

**Assembly**, if you harbor such karmic roots, they will manifest in this life. **Precept-holders**, you must resolve to endure insults, release grudges, bear suffering, forget shame, and suffer loss. You must subdue this mind, accept all afflictions, and wield the *jie dao* [precept-knife] to slay the fire of ignorance at every moment. Clothe yourself in the robe of forbearance, enduring beatings and curses, slander and humiliation, without breaking your precepts even for an instant.

Even when falsely accused, dragged before magistrates, struck by lightning, burned by fire, drowned, robbed, mauled by beasts, bitten by serpents, oppressed by demons, or tormented by spirits—when your reputation is ruined, your kin harmed, or your limbs severed—you cannot escape the retribution of past deeds. The suffering is fated; the debt must be repaid.

Do not resist what is inevitable—it would only harm your precepts. Instead, recall: *Those who wrong me have once been wronged by me. Those who oppress me have once been oppressed by me.* All misfortune—magical, karmic, or otherwise—is self-made, the fruit of past actions. From this day forward, as you uphold the precepts, let all evil deeds dissolve with your mind. Naturally, the six desires will fade, the three poisons vanish, and your body and mind will grow light and serene. Suffering will heal, and grudges will dissolve.

**Assembly**, from the beginningless accumulation of grudges, today you must awaken to your true nature. For every debt, every wrong, vow to endure and repay—harming yourself to benefit others—only then will you attain liberation. Thereafter, you will return to pristine purity, the original unity of the cosmos, preserving the spirit in stillness, refining the perfect retribution-body.

If you refuse to repay past debts, refuse to surrender present shame, then future retribution will not spare you. How then can this body transcend? How can this mind attain emptiness? How can the Dao be cultivated?

You cannot even endure a few harsh words now—how can you hope to escape birth and death entirely?

**Assembly**, forbearance extinguishes the fire of ignorance, and the five viscera grow cool. Forbearance brings forth the waters of *Huachi* [the elixir field], and the six bowels harmonize. Forbearance satisfies others’ desires, and grudges dissolve in peace. Forbearance expands your capacity, and your chest grows vast.

In truth, those who insult you do not truly insult you—only you bear the burden of their karma.

He who wrongs others, when others wrong him, will surely repay him with wrong.

If one can endure, then the mind’s *qi* becomes harmonious, preventing liver fire from blazing—transforming into the Southern Dipper’s [Mingantu] disaster-dissolving star.
If one can endure, then the lung’s armpit generates moisture, universally nourishing the stomach and spleen—transforming into the Jade Pool’s sweet dew.
If one can endure, then kidney essence is not depleted, and the upper and lower *yuan* [vital gates] are freed from peril—transforming into the Wuling Spring.
If one can endure, then the spleen’s earth does not wither, and the body becomes light and tranquil—transforming into white snow and golden sprouts.
If one can endure, then the *dharma-body* is without leakage, and the Dao’s *qi* becomes divine—manifesting as a resplendent and wondrous form.

To endure in the realm of the state brings benefit to the court.
To endure in the family brings benefit to kin.
To endure in the body brings benefit to spirit.
To endure in the mind brings benefit to life.
To endure in the teaching brings benefit to the *dharma*-affinity.

Such are the benefits of endurance.

But if one cannot endure insults and bear burdens,
then the mind becomes unempty,
the spirit becomes unrefined,
the *qi* becomes weak,
the capacity becomes narrow,
the chest remains unopened,
the aspiration becomes small,
the practice becomes incomplete,
the conduct becomes flawed,
the insight becomes shallow,
the wisdom becomes diminished,
the virtue and merit become shallow,
the roots become thin—
the Dao remains unclear, the path is obstructed,
one is despised by others, envied by others,
hated by others, and provokes others’ vexation,
becomes arrogant toward others,
invites ghostly reproach,
dreams with terror and alarm,
is scolded by spirits in daylight,
suffers from scabies, leprosy, and maddening rashes,
accumulates the karmic roots of countless calamities,
and the retribution of future lives grows ever deeper.
The sea of suffering never ceases its waves—
how then can one hope to rise above them in vain?

**Assembly**, have you not heard that virtue is fundamental?
Only the great in virtue are supported by Heaven—
Heaven has no favorites, only virtue does it uphold.

Among you, the wise and foolish differ.
Some lose virtue for wealth,
some for beauty,
some for pride.
Though the external causes of insult vary—
whether from wealth, beauty, or pride—
the insult itself is one.

The sages say:
*"A single moment of wrath forgets oneself and one’s kin."*
*"Anger is hard to ponder."*
Zengzi said:
*"When the heart harbors resentment, it loses its rectitude."*

How weighty is the precept of endurance!
How poisonous is the harm of anger!

Thus, the True Ones of old took subduing anger as their entry,
and forgetting anger as their Dao.
They took enduring insult as killing the mind,
and forgetting insult as fulfilling their vow.

The *Sutra of Rescue from Suffering* by the Taishang Laozun says:
*"Fire’s obscurity clears into pure halls,
Sword-trees bloom in fragrant groves.
To transcend the Three Realms is hard—
Yet ascend to the Primordial Heaven’s beginning."*

「Assembled ones, awaken with urgency and vigor, heed my verses:

*"Swiftly abandon the self-other duality,
Hasten to perceive the cause of birth and death.
By enduring insult and quelling the fire of anger,
The formless *Dharma-body* appears in emptiness.
The seven emotions vanish with each passing thought,
The ancient ones praised the hundredfold endurance.
Bear sweetly all guilt and karmic burdens,
Only then does one become a being beyond the *kalpa* (eon).

All afflictions and obstacles are past causes,
Unpaid debts and grudges are but one.
The foolish, in their darkness, suffer loss—anger ignites,
A labyrinth of grievances stretches black and boundless.

In cultivation, guard against seizing advantage,
For if I gain, others will not comply.
Through endless *kalpas*, one drifts in endless debt,
Yet even in the Pure and Tranquil Hall, discord prevails.

Where strife finds no lodging, the *Dharma-realm* is vast,
Yet *xianzi* (immortals) and *modu* (demons) have two fates.
In the Cool and Blessed Land, endurance is the root,
Repaying insult-debt fulfills the Dao’s complete power.

This mortal frame now walks the Dao’s path—
Yet why refuse to bear others’ burdens?

A skyward rage stirs the embers of the *skin* (flesh),
The formless True Ones starve as hungry ghosts.»

**Eightfold Purity of Body and Mind**

Assembled ones, having now taken refuge in the precepts,
You must single-mindedly seek liberation from the world,
To transcend birth and death.

Yet those who have ascended beyond birth and death,
The highest among the *outseers* (those who escape the world),
Have the Dao of *no death, no birth*—
A path where all *dharma* (phenomena) dissolve into *wuwei* (non-action),
For the essence is beyond all *dharma*.

The *dharma* of the world and that of the *outseer*
Differ only in the heart’s application—
Whether inverted or conforming,
They are but one *dharma*.
Nor is *dharma* merely the inversion of conformity.

To conform while applying inversion,
All *dharma* submits to the *Wuwei Law*—
Ghosts and gods cannot fathom its workings.

To invert while following conformity,
One *dharma* manifests as myriad *dharma*—
Yin and Yang operate within its design.

It is not a matter of conscious deliberation,
But of the inherent *Divine Intelligence* and *Rational Nature*,
Which are thus by their original essence.
There is no separate *outseer dharma*.

Though one may transcend the world,
Who is it that truly does so?
Yet to send this being beyond the world’s confines—
That is the true meaning of *outseing*.

But this is not the case.

Now, the world is vast, the *saha* (realm) expansive—
Where is the true *outworld*?

Assembled ones, listen carefully:
The *outworld* is beyond the *dharma* of the world.
Pierce the illusion of worldly *dharma*,
Discern that all conditioned actions are but dreamlike.
Things are without substance,
Affairs are without reality—
Only when this heart is purified
Can one escape beyond the world.

Assembled ones, how does one know this heart can transcend?
Behold the heavens with their shifting Yin and Yang—
They cannot escape the world.
Behold the earth with its collapses and fissures—
They cannot escape the world.
The waxing and waning of sun and moon—
They cannot escape the world.
The distant fall of stars and constellations—
They cannot escape the world.
The winds, clouds, thunder, and rain,
Frost, snow, mist, and dew—
Each bound by measure and limit—
They cannot escape the world.
Mountains crumble, stones shatter,
Waters dry, springs vanish,
Grasses wither, trees rot,
Gold melts, jade fractures—
They cannot escape the world.
Humans face birth and death—
They cannot escape the world.
All things endure growth and decay—
They cannot escape the world.
Emotions vary in depth and shallowness—
They cannot escape the world.
Qi (breath) rises and falls—
They cannot escape the world.
The heart shifts between agitation and stillness—
They cannot escape the world.
Essence leaks away—
They cannot escape the world.
Spirit scatters and dims—
They cannot escape the world.
Power wanes and swells—
They cannot escape the world.
Gain comes and goes—
They cannot escape the world.
All conditioned existence follows the *Four Noble Truths* (成住空坏),
Birth, old age, sickness, and death—
How can any of these draw one beyond the world?

Assembled ones, you must within worldly *dharma*
Awaken to the *outseer dharma*—
For this is the path.

The *outseer dharma* is not in many words,
But in turning this heart back to its source.

Knowing that the heavens, earth, and myriad things,
Human nature and worldly affairs,
Are all non-true *dharma*,
You realize they are but snares within the world.

If you awaken in your heart to this truth,
You can shatter the illusion that all things are impermanent,
That worldly *dharma* and human nature are but phantoms—
What then is the true *ling* (numinous essence)?

This true *ling* is formless, without attributes,
Silent, scentless—
It is said to be within yet not confined within,
Said to be without yet not truly without.
All beings possess it,
All things encompass it—
Thus it is the sovereign *Dharma-king* of escape.

Assembled ones, this true *ling*—
Across time and space, in all things and eras,
It is ever-present, never obscured.
Penetrating heaven, piercing earth,
Emerging from darkness, entering the void.
Neither born nor altered,
Neither excessive nor deficient.
Without lack or surplus,
Without coming or going—
It governs Yin and Yang yet is not enslaved by them.
It commands ghosts and gods yet is not afflicted by them.
It employs all things yet is not hindered by them.
It transforms human nature yet is not moved by it.
It responds to worldly *dharma* yet is not drowned by it.
It transcends the world while dwelling in it.
It roams the Three Realms freely,
It oversees all spirits with unfathomable change.

Above the heavens, below the earth—
Only this is worthy of reverence,
No equal exists.

Yet this true *ling* is had by all,
Each struggles to perceive it.
From myriad *dharma* and thousand gates,
From the Three Vehicles and One Treasure,
All originate from here.

In the *Teachings of the Confucian School*, it is called *Mingde Zhishan* (Illuminated Virtue, Perfect Goodness).
In the *Daoist Tradition*, it is the *Yuanming Daolao* (Round Illumination, the Daoist Mother).
It is also called *Zushi* (Primordial Qi).
The myriad other names are inexhaustible.

Where does one seek the *dharma* that knows all things?
In the *Great Learning* (《大学》):
*"Clarify your Illuminated Virtue,
Stop at Perfect Goodness."*」

「Some subtle marvels, some profound mysteries—
Awakening to them is before your very eyes,
Yet bewilderment casts you into the depths of the sea.

**Assembled ones**, know this: the path to transcendence
Does not exceed the two words—*body* and *mind*.

The body is borrowed, the mind is true,
The mind is borrowed, the *nature* is true—
You must grasp the *Way* of cultivating truth through borrowed forms.

The external is borrowed, the internal is true,
The external is form, the internal is emptiness—
Without relying on the external, colored and impermanent body,
You cannot cultivate the internal, formless *Dharma-body*.

Without abandoning the aged, sick, dying body born of external causes,
You cannot fathom the pristine, perfect mind within.

Without relying on the vital, living *qi* of the mind,
You cannot transcend and realize the boundless, limitless *nature*.

Yet this *nature*, since the decree of Heaven,
From the very beginning of life,
Is utterly untainted—
It shares the same essence as the *Great Void* (太虚),
It shares the same measure as the *Great Void*.

Empty, hollow, and void,
It possesses nothing at all.

Complete, whole, and perfect,
It lacks nothing.

**Assembled ones**, now if you seek transcendence,
First, each must purify *body* and *mind*.

How does one purify *body* and *mind*?
The body is formed by the *qi* of blood and breath—
This *qi* is not inherently corrupt,
But truly the root of birth and death,
The source of all calamities.

It entangles the mind,
And harms the *nature*.

Seeking pleasure through lust and desire,
Chasing fame and gain for worldly benefit,
Breaking laws to invite punishment,
Summoning disasters and diseases—
All arise from this body.

The *Supreme Sage* said:
*"When people have afflictions,
It is because they have a body.
If they have no body,
What afflictions remain?"*

The ancients declared:
*"If one is not bound by form,
Right before your eyes lies the Great Sage of the Luo."*

Thus, this body is no small source of woe.

Now, you must see through the skin-bag as a borrowed thing,
A concoction of earth, water, and wind.

If you do not pursue purification to its utmost,
And merely urge people to practice filial piety,
Saying that the body and hair are received from parents,
And must not be harmed—

Parental essence and maternal blood,
Combined in the Five Agents,
Bear the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
And obtain the divine power of *yin* and *yang*.

The head, round as Heaven,
The feet, square as Earth—
Placed between Heaven and Earth,
Shared among the Three Talents,
Among all things, humans are first.

Above, we can pair with Heaven and Earth,
Below, we can honor the spirits and *devas*.
In learning, we can aspire to the sages,
In cultivation, we can become *immortals*, Buddhas.

How can we regard this most noble, rich body
As a foul, worthless clod of earth?

Only those who embrace the *Precepts*,
Who refuse to sink into decline,
Who are not entangled by worldly waves—

Who do not seek bodily comfort,
But return their true *nature* to its true constant—

Who wish to govern *yin* and *yang* with their will and *qi*,
Who wish to adorn the *Dharma-realm* with their form and spirit—

If even the *Dharma-body* is flawed,
Then form and spirit cannot both be wondrous,
And the *Way* cannot be truly united.

**Assembled ones**, I now explain the practice of purification to you.
If you wish this body to be pure,
First cast aside worldly attachments,
Sever dusty emotions,
And differ entirely from worldly *dharma*.

Embrace simplicity and take joy in quietude,
Abandon richness and leave behind clamor.

Take refuge in the Three Treasures,
And steadfastly uphold the One Truth.

Nurture your *nature* and emotions to be serene and balanced,
Keep your hands and feet dignified and composed—
Your eyes and ears must not stray to evil,
Your thoughts must not be scattered and chaotic,
Your mind must not dwell on contrivance or fixation,
Your speech must not be loud or boastful.

Retract the divine light of your two eyes,
To illuminate within and never dim the sacred *platform* (灵台);

Return the refined essence of your two ears,
To listen inwardly and always hear the Celestial Resonance.

Sparingly speak, often silent,
And return to the natural, unshaken stillness.

Regret none, wander in thought no more,
Your spirit unperturbed, the Heavenly Mechanism clear—
The profound *principles* complete and unobstructed.

Cease consuming meat and blood,
To secretly dissolve the karmic retribution of countless lives.

Follow the *Precepts* in body,
And solemnly uphold the majesty of the Four Great Elements.

If your steps are not disorderly, your mind will not be agitated,
If your hands do not move recklessly, your mind will not be restless.

Sit upright and centered, never allowing crookedness,
Lie alert and aware, guarding against excessive slumber—
Eat simple and bland foods to reduce flavors,
And let the Five *Zang* Organs remain tranquil and peaceful.

Speak with caution and composure,
And let your voice be harmonious and resonant.

This is called the *coarse practice* of purifying the body.

As for the subtle methods,
They require you to ponder the two words—*pure* and *still*—
Lest you fail to penetrate them into your heart,
And instead lament that you cannot achieve the *Way*,
Though you diligently study and practice.

**Assembled ones**, a mind without dual thoughts is *pure*,
A thought without obstruction is *still*.

The mind not clinging to forms is *pure*,
A thought not stopping is *still*.

Thoughts clear and complete are *pure*,
Light unobstructed is *still*.

Not a speck of defilement is *pure*,
All considerations emptied are *still*.

All things cannot hide their forms from you—*pure*,
Spirits cannot fathom your workings—*still*.

The mind like flowing water is *pure*,
The *nature* like bright moon is *still*.

Since beginningless time, all guilt destroyed—*pure*,
All causes from countless eons utterly clear—*still*.

Observing your mind, yet no mind is seen—*pure*,
Gazing at all things, yet no things are seen—*still*.

When these three insights are awakened—*pure*,
Only seeing emptiness—*still*.

Seeing emptiness, yet emptiness itself is seen—*pure*,
Emptiness possessing nothing to be emptied—*still*.

What is emptied has no existence,
Without existence, there is no "without"—*pure*,
Ever-pervasive stillness—*still*,
Stillness possessing nothing to be still—*still*.

The true constant responds to all things—*pure*,
The constant response is ever-still—*still*.

Pierced through without doubt—*pure*,
Entering the gates of all wonders—*still*.

Transcending the Three Realms—*pure*,
Liberated from the Five Agents—*still*.

Shattering the void—*pure*,
Shattering into the void—*still*.

Light encompassing all heavens—*pure*,
Universally delivering all beings—*still*.

**Assembled ones**, I have briefly opened the path for you.
The Three Teachings’ sages,
The vast treasury of scriptures—

All *dharma*s, myriad gates,
The wondrous forms of all heavens—」

The thirty-six thousand *Dao*s,
Eighty-four thousand *dharma* gates—
All *bodhisattvas* as numerous as the Ganges’ sands,
Countless *golden immortals*—
None can escape the wondrous, effortless *dharma* of pure stillness and insight.

**Assembled ones**, the supreme, most exalted *Mahayana* path of ultimate truth—
Giving birth to heavens, earths,
Humans, and all beings—
All arise from pure stillness.

The *Taishang* says:
*"If one remains ever-calm and still,
Heaven and earth shall all submit to them."*
Again it says:
*"Stillness brings rectitude to the world."*
Thus, it is clear: to still the body and mind,
Swiftly seek awakening.

**Assembled ones**, from this day forth,
Cast aside all past delusions—
The lead-mercury, dragon-tiger, yin-yang refining,
All metaphorical alchemical arts—
Discard them all.

Only follow the path of pure stillness,
Extinguish deluded thoughts,
Banish errant desires,
Steady and unshaken,
Walk the middle, straight path—
Fear not delay,
For hesitation is not error—
If there is a path, do not board the boat.

If I deceive you with falsehood,
I shall fall into hell.

At that time, the *Lüshi* spoke this verse:

*"A scattered mind is not still,
Dust-filled, the body is not pure.
Impure, the nature is hard to see,
Unstill, how could it lack passion?
Inner light reveals the body as illusion,
Returning radiance, the heart is void.
Within the void, the spirit manifests itself—
Stillness and insight are the true *宗* (*zong*).
Observe the sun and moon,
In daily life, embody and practice.
To hold the Dipper’s handle in reverse,
Stillness aligns with the Heavenly Will."*

The Ninefold Seeking of the Master.

「From ancient times onward, sages, immortals, and Buddhas—
Those who have attained fruition and realized truth—
None have been enlightened without a teacher.

Thus, teachers pass on the Way to one another,
Mouth to mouth, heart to heart, seal to seal.
Within these teachings, the Dao is uninterrupted and whole.

Like milk turning into water,
Like glue and lacquer merging,
Qi seeks its like, sounds resonate alike—
Water and sky in one hue,
Lamp-light intermingling,
Only then can one grasp the full essence of teacher and disciple.

**Great Assembly**, I observe that many in this world seek teachers and ask questions, yet most fall short.
They bear the name of teacher-disciple transmission,
But lack its true substance.

Therefore, today I spare neither words nor reputation,
Unfearing slander or ridicule,
To reveal the principles of seeking a teacher and inquiring about the Dao—
You must remember them deeply,
For first, as a disciple to others,
If you uphold this practice,
Then later, as a teacher yourself,
Your disciples will follow the ancient ways,
And honor the teacher for the sake of the Dao.

**Great Assembly**, the ignorant and blind in this world
Do not recognize their own hearts,
And drift with external things.
Though they harbor thoughts of the Dao,
They fail to distinguish right from wrong paths;
Though they possess a Daoist heart,
They do not know the methods of cultivation.

When they hear the words:
*"Nature is self-realized,
Life depends on the teacher’s transmission,"*
They act upon them without reflection.

Some chance upon a wandering Daoist,
Clad in patched robes, barefoot in straw sandals,
Wielding a palm-leaf fan,
Shouldering a meditation cushion,
Passing through cities with leisurely ease.
Or they sit at street corners,
Begging alms with a wooden bowl;
Or stroll along the road,
Free and unconstrained.

At temples or halls, they rest briefly,
Before monasteries, they borrow lodging.
They mouth incantations,
Their tongues drumming like gongs and pipes.
Yet how can they speak of the *玄关* (*Xuan Guan* / Mystic Pass)?
Or the *尾闾* (*Wei Liu* / Cauda Equina)?
How can they reach the *泥丸宫* (*Ni Wan Gong* / Mud Pellet Palace) below,
Or the *涌泉穴* (*Yong Quan Xue* / Gushing Spring Acupoint) above?
How can they practice *守中提气* (*shou zhong ti qi* / Governing the Center and Raising the Qi)?
Or stand firm as the *鼎* (*ding* / Cauldron) and settle the *炉* (*lu* / Furnace)?

How can they prolong life and ward off illness,
Through *按摩* (*an mo* / Massage) and *导引* (*dao yin* / Guiding and Pulling)?
The *六字诀* (*Liu Zi Jue* / Six-Syllable Formula),
The *八段锦* (*Ba Duan Jin* / Eight Brocade),
The *悟真篇* (*Wu Zhen Pian* / Awakening to Reality Script),
The *参同契* (*Can Tong Qi* / Alchemical Classic of the Unity of the Three),
As well as the *丹经* (*Dan Jing* / Alchemical Canon) metaphors:
*铅汞* (*Qian Gong* / Lead and Mercury) as *龙虎* (*Long Hu* / Dragon and Tiger),
*银砂* (*Yin Sha* / Silver and Sand) as *夫妇* (*Fu Fu* / Husband and Wife),
*日月* (*Ri Yue* / Sun and Moon) in *卦爻* (*gua yao* / Hexagram and Trigrams),
*龟蛇* (*Gui She* / Tortoise and Serpent) in *温养* (*Wen Yang* / Nourishing),
*沐浴结胎* (*Mu Yu Jie Tai* / Bathing and Conceiving),
*入室坐圆* (*Ru Shi Zuo Yuan* / Entering the Chamber and Sitting in Circle),
*出阴神* (*Chu Yin Shen* / Emerging from the Shadow Spirit),
*出阳神* (*Chu Yang Shen* / Emerging from the Yang Spirit)—

Countless are the *三千六百旁门* (*San Qian Liu Bai Pang Men* / Three Thousand Six Hundred False Paths),
And the *八万四千魔法* (*Ba Wan Si Qian Mo Fa* / Eight Ten-Thousand Demon Arts).
Who can enumerate them all?»

「The multitude—these foolish and blind disciples—lack wisdom in their hearts.
How could they distinguish truth from falsehood, or righteousness from depravity?
Yet they follow such *Dao* practitioners without hesitation.

Even more despicable are those who speak of *鼎器* (*Ding Qi* / Cauldron and Furnace),
those fraudulent *茅银* (*Mao Yin* / Grass-Silver) alchemists,
who seduce others with their allure or ensnare them with wealth.
To say nothing of the *Dao* methods that yield no results,
even if these *Dao* methods contained some truth—
could common mortals transmute base metals into gold?
Could licentious men prolong their lives?

Thus, those who speak of *Ding Qi*:
seeing beauty, their minds are stirred;
confronting circumstances, their thoughts awaken—
their spirits scatter, their true *汞* (*Gong* / Mercury) descends,
the *先天* (*Xian Tian* / Primordial Heaven) is overturned,
the supreme treasure vanishes,
and many fall into *痨疾* (*lao ji* / Consumption).
They never even manage to preserve their lives,
let alone pass on the *命要* (*Ming Yao* / Vital Essence).
Is it not pitiful and lamentable?

As for those who burn *茅银* (*Mao Yin* / Grass-Silver) in fraud—
discoursing on *砂* (*Sha* / Sand) and *矿* (*Kuang* / Ore),
twisting and turning their words—
*温养* (*Wen Yang* / Nourishing) and *开点* (*Kai Dian* / Unblocking),
endless schemes of deception and trickery—
their gullible and greedy victims often meet ruin,
and their crimes surpass those of the *Dao* practitioners mentioned earlier by manyfold.

I cannot bear to elaborate further,
lest it invite slander.
But for those who have taken the *戒* (precepts),
I must outline the general principles of seeking a teacher and inquiring into the *Dao*.»

「Assembly,

This supreme Dao of the Sovereign Heaven (*Huang Tian* / Imperial Sky) is vague and indistinct (*huǎng huǎng hū hū, yǎo yǎo míng míng* / dimly and boundlessly obscure);
it is boundless, vast, exalted, and revered;
it is profound, concealed, and deeply mysterious.
Its greatness knows no outer limit, its subtlety knows no inner bound.
It can span the heavens and measure the earth,
it can traverse the unseen and enter the void.
It exists and yet seems absent—
it does not get wet in water, nor does it burn in fire;
before it, there is no past, after it, there is no future—
it gives birth to Heaven and Earth,
it governs the sun and moon, nurtures all things;
it produces sages and worthies, it produces immortals and Buddhas.
Even the crawling insects and plants possess it—
no one lacks it, no place is without it.
In daily life, it is everywhere, yet all are wondrous Dao.
But because common folk use it without knowing,
the vulgar are deluded and fail to awaken,
the true is lost, and countless eons pass without clarity.

Before your parents gave you birth,
the true spirit (*Zhen Ling*) knew not its beginning;
after your spirit departs,
this body knows not its end.
Inverted cycles of rebirth (*Dian Dao Lun Hui* / transmigration),
suffering in life and death.
Therefore, I point out its source and root (*Yuan Gen*),
urging you to seek true teachers and early hear this Dao.

Yet true teachers are hard to meet,
and worthy disciples are hard to find.
Know that if disciples lack true out-of-the-world sincerity (*Chun Xin*),
their wisdom is obscured—
even if they encounter a true teacher,
spirits and deities (*Gui Shen*) will not let them see,
they will conceal the disciple’s wisdom—
and even if they see, they cannot recognize the teacher as true.

If teachers lack the heart to save the world (*Du Shi Xin*),
even if they meet worthy disciples,
spirits and deities will not allow them to be seen,
they will veil the disciple’s *法眼* (*Dharma Eye*),
and the teacher will perceive no affinity—
many opportunities pass by right before their eyes.

Assembly,
teachers seek disciples as one rolls a *芥* (*jie* / sesame seed) to find a needle;
disciples seek teachers like grasping the moon in water.
True teachers are rare, worthy disciples are hard to find—
not because of wealth or treasure,
but because of the sincerity of a single thought within the heart.

You see which true Dao teachers (*You Dao Shi Fu*)
would dare to transmit falsely to unworthy people (*Fei Ren*),
or which high ones (*Gao Ren*) seeking Dao would dare to blindly revere teachers?

Assembly,
if teachers do not transmit falsely to disciples,
then this teacher holds the Dao supreme,
and seeks worthy disciples.
If disciples do not blindly revere teachers,
then this person has keen insight and discernment,
their mind is open and their vision sharp.

Even those who refuse to lightly revere teachers or blindly follow Dao,
whose hearts are empty of obstacles (*Xing Ai*),
whose aspirations are free from dust (*Chen Huan*),
whose vision is broad and whose spirit is vast—
when they meet a true Dao teacher,
their understanding will be clear beyond words,
they can speak of it, see through it,
and in half a sentence,
the sesame seed and needle will meet,
the needle’s eye will align with the seed.

When such worthy disciples meet a teacher who does not lightly take disciples or falsely transmit,
how could the teacher not joyfully engage in deep discussion,
in expansive discourse on profound truths (*Miao Jue* / wondrous keys),
in authentic explanations (*Zhen Quan*),
in subtle yet profound mysteries (*Wei Mi*),
in heart-transmitted Dao and orally bestowed celestial principles (*Tian Zhang*)?

Assembly,
true teachers are not few,
worthy disciples are many.
But how do we know which are true teachers and not few?

Assembly,
the six senses (*Liu Gen* / Six Roots) you possess all have true teachers.
For instance, if your ears hear virtuous words (*Shan Yan*),
and you truly follow them with conviction (*Shan Shuo*),
this sense of hearing (*Er Gen* / Ear Root)
is your guiding teacher,
and these virtuous words are the transmitting teacher.
The same applies to the other five senses.

Assembly,
there is no fixed teacher in learning (*Xue Wu*),
only the Dao is the teacher.
Whenever your ears hear good words and virtuous speech,
you must focus your spirit and listen in silence—
as if sweet dew were dripping into your heart,
or if clear wisdom (*Xing Ke* / Awakening Mind) were poured upon your crown—
concentrate your mind and silently absorb this person,
who opens my stupidity and ignorance (*Yu Mei*),
who acts with compassion and skillful means (*Ci Bei Fang Bian*),
wishing this person who proclaims virtuous words
to quickly attain profound merit (*Xuan Gong*),
to obtain the unsurpassed Dao (*Wu Shang Dao*),
is this not teacher and disciple?

If your eyes see all the sutras (*Jing Dian*),
the scriptures of the Three Teachings (*San Jiao*),
true words and secret keys (*Zhen Yan Mi Jue*),
and you attain awakening through them,
then you should pay homage and praise them—
such texts are your true recognition and utmost faith.
Naturally, teacher and disciple will meet.

Yet the teacher’s compassionate boat of the law (*Ci Hang Fa Qiao*),
the bridge of instruction,
is not a single method.
Mencius said:
“Teaching methods are many indeed.
There are those who perfect virtue (*Cheng De*),
those who cultivate talent (*Da Cai*),
those who answer questions (*Da Wen*),
and those who privately emulate and learn (*Si Shu Ai*),
these are all methods of teaching and instruction.”

Thus, there are those who bow their heads and rejoice in meeting (*Qing Gai*),
who immediately align upon seeing;
there are those who humbly confess their ignorance (*Zi Shou Ru Xin*),
who do not presume superiority over others;
there are those who kowtow and bend the knee in transmission (*Qi Shou Qu Xi*),
there are those who make solemn vows and pledges before transmission (*Zhai Jin Meng Shi*),
who then receive the teaching.

Reverence is the incomplete form of respect (*Li* / Rites).
Reverence without sincerity is not true reverence.
What matters is observing the disciple’s sincerity and steadfast practice (*Cheng Xin Du Xing*),
respecting the teacher and honoring the Dao.

Thus, there are those who test repeatedly before transmission—
like the ten trials of *Dong Bin* (the Immortal) in *Yun Fang* (the Cloud Room).
There are those who humble themselves before being seen—
like *Liu Xuan De* (Lord Liu) of the Three Visits to *Mao Lu* (the thatched hut).
Some have followed their teachers for years,
yet their hearts do not turn toward the Dao (*Xin Bu Tui Zhuan*).
Some know the truth of sincerity,
yet deliberately test with many hardships (*Gu Shi Duo Jian*).

This transmission of the Dao and reception of its teachings (*Shou Ye*),
is it not something of great significance,
not something easily obtained?

Thus, there are those who speak not with three mouths,
who transmit not with six ears (*San Kou Bu Yan, Liu Er Bu Chuan*).
The highest teachings (*Shang Cheng Dao Fa*)
cannot be transmitted to the middle and low;
the middle and low teachings (*Zhong Xia Dao Fa*)
cannot be transmitted to the superior in wisdom (*Shang Zhi*).

Only does one teach according to the person (*Yin Ren Er Jiao*).
As when *Ran You* asked about *Wen Si Xing Zhi* (the method of hearing and practicing),
the Master said:
“Hear and practice.”
When *Zi Lu* asked about *Wen Si Xing Zhi*,
the Master said:
“With parents and elder brothers present,
how could you hear and practice?”

For *Ran You* was humble (*Qiu Ye Tui*),
so he was advanced (*Jin Zhi*),
while *Zi Lu* was of mediocre talent (*You Ye Jian Ren*),
so he was held back (*Tui Zhi*).
This is why they could not both hear the same teachings.

Thus, *Gong Xi Hua* (Zigong) heard it twice,
and yet still fell into doubt and confusion (*Sheng Yi Huo*).」

The Master and his disciples asked about *ren* (benevolence/virtue) in great numbers, yet the Master’s responses varied—this is so.

Some may take it with sincere faith, while others hear it casually; those with faith may be spoken to, while the casual hearers may not.

Thus it is said: *“Do not dismiss it as trivial just because it is easily obtained.”*

To the assembly: some may transmit the Dao among thousands, yet the wise among them grasp it easily, while the dull find it hard to practice. If one shouts aloud, revealing the profound mysteries, those who listen with intent may record it, but those who lack the right connection hear it as mere words, carried away like wind through the ear.

To the assembly: the Buddha Śākyamuni raised his flower and showed it to all, saying: *“I possess the wondrous bright true-nature, the nirvāṇa-mind, the true Dharma-eye treasure—can all of you see and attain it?”* Only Mahākāśyapa smiled in response.

To the assembly: Mahākāśyapa, the Śākyan, openly cultivated the *Zhàn Dào* (the high road) while secretly crossing the *Chén Cāng* (the hidden pass). Before the great assembly, he transmitted the secret Dao in private, mind-to-mind, mouth-to-mouth. Yet those seated below remained unaware of what was transmitted or received.

Again, like the Sage Confucius before the assembly of sages and worthy disciples, he said to Zēngzi: *“Shēn, my Dao is one thread running through all.”* Zēngzi replied: *“Yes.”* At that time, his disciples were many—was this not the Sage transmitting the Dao before the disciples, while Zēngzi passed it on within the gathered disciples?

Ordinary people do not recognize their own true-nature, so they meet it yet fail to meet it, unaware of what is transmitted or passed on.

But Zēngzi deeply understood his own nature, naturally aligning with the Sage’s intent.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor, Xuānyuán, sought the Dao in the Kūndūn Mountains from Guāngchéngzi. He repeatedly urged his request, but Guāngchéngzi gave no answer. The Yellow Emperor withdrew to fast and meditate, dwelling in seclusion for three months, then returned, bowing humbly, advancing on his knees, and asked for the essence of the supreme Dao. Guāngchéngzi then replied:

*“The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and dark;
its utmost reaches are dim and silent.
See nothing, hear nothing—embrace the Spirit in stillness,
and the form will naturally align.
Be utterly still, be utterly clear—
do not weary your body,
do not let your thoughts flutter ceaselessly,
then you may attain longevity.
Guard your exterior, close your interior—
excessive cleverness brings ruin.
I hold to its One and dwell in its harmony,
thus I have not aged for twelve hundred years.”*

These few words were spoken directly to the Yellow Emperor, yet he said no more.

Follow them if you will—it is your choice.
Do not follow them if you will—it is also your choice.

This is called *each fulfilling their own Dao*.

Great Assembly, within my Daoist tradition, the **Moral Teachings of the Southern Flower** (道德南华) contain countless profound meanings;
the **Primordial Purity and Refined Substance** (冲虚文始) hold many **true words** (真言).
And the **Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries** (三洞四辅), the **Thirty-six Mysteries** (三十六奇), how many **scriptures** (经文) are there!

Who can **purify their ears** (打扫耳根) and reverently listen to the **wondrous critiques** (妙谤) of the **Sacred Scriptures** (圣经);
who can **open their vision** (放开眼界) and **transcendally perceive** (超悟) the **supreme Dao** (大道) beyond mere verbal exposition (言诠)?
If one fails to perceive it, their mind will not be **illuminated** (光明),
even if they meet a **sage-teacher** (圣师), they will still fail to recognize the truth.

Great Assembly, before seeking a teacher, you must first **seek your own self** (求已).
Before inquiring into the Dao, you must first **inquire within your own heart** (问心).
If you do not **abide by the precepts** (依律) in your practice (行持),
it will be **utterly impossible** (万难) to meet a teacher and **verify the Dao** (印道).

The **critical junctures** (关窍) within this path
ultimately demand that you **remain humble and lowly** (谦虚卑抑),
first **completely excising** (刳剔) the **arrogant pride and self-delusion** (贡高我慢) from your heart,
and **softening, harmonizing, yielding, and submitting** (柔和逊顺).
**Sever all thoughts of slander and envy** (诽谤嫉妒之念) at once.
When meeting others, **never boast of your own abilities** (莫自夸能),
for fear that someone may **possess equal or greater merit** (能似你).
If you chance upon a **perspicacious sage** (明眼高人) or a **mind-empty, will-illuminated adept** (心空志士),
a mere **half-spoken phrase** (一言半语) could **sever you at the waist** (拦腰截住),
and how then would you **struggle free** (挣脱)?
You would **naturally melt like snow, revealing your corpse** (雪化见尸),
and **escape no discerning eye** (难逃识者).

I now **solemnly exhort** (奉劝) the Great Assembly:
seeking a teacher and inquiring into the Dao is no **hasty affair** (草草).
Before asking your teacher, **bow your head a few times** (磕下几个头),
and do not think that merely **hearing a few words** (听几声) will suffice.
Nowadays, **disciples disrespect their teachers and slight the Dao** (戒子轻师慢道), such cases are **ubiquitous** (比比皆然).

Great Assembly, you must **urgently turn inward and reflect** (反躬内省),
and **repent your past disdain and arrogance** (忏悔侮傲) before the **ascended masters and ancestral teachers** (历祖师前).
Change your old habits, **revere the treasures of the Law** (尊敬法宝).
If you **truly, sincerely, and earnestly** (真心苦切) **keep watch and seek a teacher** (留眼访师),
then **Heaven will not fail humanity** (天不负人),
and **the Immortal and the True** (仙真) will **come of their own accord** (不求自至),
not bound by **distance, proximity, or time** (远近迟早).

Listen to my **gatha** (偈言):
*"To seek a teacher, one must first conquer self;
To inquire into the Dao, one’s heart must be sincere.
With sincerity, the Dao is perceived;
With earnestness, one meets a worthy cause.
Difficult to encounter in ten thousand kalpas,
Rare to find in a thousand lifetimes—
Now, in this very age.
If you grasp my meaning clearly,
You will **suddenly awaken** (顿悟) to the Dao’s **unborn roots** (未生根)."*

From the **Scripture of the Verdant Garden Platform** (碧苑坛经), Volume Ten: *"The Ten Precepts of Illuminated Wisdom"* (定慧等持).

「大众，但受初真戒者，进受中极，先将初真十戒，细微妙行，密密行持过了，方来进受中极三百大戒。

大众，中极戒与初真戒有甚分别？
一戒无所不戒，一真无所不真了。

怎么初真之后，又有中极，中极之后又有天仙，这却为何分别先后呢？
大众，这个道理也甚明白易见。
我将这个道理，就向虚空取来告你。

大众，你受的乃初真十戒，乃是教你们拘制色身，乘风破浪，不许妄动胡行，起止无常的。
至中极三百大戒，乃是教你们降伏顽心，不许妄想胡思，七心八意的。
至天仙妙戒，乃是教你们解脱真意，不许执着粘缚的。

大众，初真十戒粗，中极三百便细了。
夫初真戒，制其外六根；中极戒扫其内六尘，天仙妙戒，使三身解脱，八识消亡，九魔十难不敢侵犯。

大众，初真戒者，是因你们即悟前非，深追旧过，又念人生在世，光阴有限，生死无常，既是出家做了道士，便就叫做全真。
仔细思量，自从出家到今，何曾全过什么真来，终年虚度时日，与俗人一样的老了。
终朝涉水登山，南奔北走，虽是朝礼过了几座名山，比俗人多见些石头树木，究竟与俗人经商为客，做买卖的一般苦。
食风宿水，着甚来由？
何曾遇见神仙？
传什口诀都是掮上掮下的俗人，俗眼凡胎，把丹经念上几篇，死死牢记着屑屑，名为吞石头，不会化的，全不知味。
是故与俗人无异，安能出世超凡。

今日受了初真戒，这知过之心，也还是本来面目犹存。
何不把平时的假心肠改作真心肠，平日的假意思改作真意思，平日的假面目改作真面目。
发露真心伸忏悔。
今日受戒之日为始，唤作初真戒子。

这初真戒律，行四大威仪，庄严身相，与法身无涉，定慧无干。
知因你们浮躁得紧，不能沉静，所以把十戒制伏其身。
若能依戒律行持，则此身安静而定，以进中极戒了。

大众，这中极戒，是定功，与初真戒不同。
初真是个戒字，中极是个定字，天仙戒是个慧字。
当初天尊慈悯众生，设此戒定慧，降伏身心意的功夫，就是出世超凡，金丹妙宝也。
除此戒定慧之外，就别无什么法儿了。
外虽有八万四千种法，都不能跳出这个定慧两字。
凭你神丹服食、金液还丹、白日升天、拔宅冲举、神通变化、尽空尸解、立化坐亡、投胎夺舍，许多的仙术，那定慧之光，却巍然不动。
照见这些神通法术，如明镜当庭，一出一入，莫不自见其形，乃还在定慧之中，不能出定慧之外。

大众，中极的中字便是斗姥天枢，巍巍不动之中；
这个极字便是南极注生，北极注死之极，生死大机，全凭斗柄默运灵枢之极。
中极二字，秉天地之权，执生死之柄。
这中字是非内非外，非左非右，非前非后，不偏不倚，无过不及的中字。
允执厥中致中和的中，多言数穷不如守中的中，君子中道而行之中，中立而不倚之中。
玄珠黍米，牟尼舍利，金丹大极，许多假名别号，其实不出这个虚灵不昧的妙明真性也。

大众，如何是定慧等持？
大众，这一点灵机，被你无始以来，所作的三业萦缠，六尘粘染，七情迷塞，六欲侵欺，三毒熏蒸，十魔强霸。
把你的灵机暗窃，要死不敢偷生，要生不敢即死。
上不能观天之道，执天之行。

大众，这点灵机，是个法宝，只宜逆转，不可顺行。」

To follow the Way in accordance with things is to drift with their transformations—
when confronted by circumstances, one stirs and summons demons, gathering calamities,
inviting harm and misfortune.
Thus one cycles through birth and death,
wandering the Four Generations and Six Paths,
adrift and sinking without end.

But those who receive the **Middle Pole Precept** must instead **reverse the Way**.
To reverse is to not follow all things in their turning,
to not follow all circumstances in their shifts—
demons, monsters, and disasters dare not assail,
the Wheel of Rebirth may be transcended,
and wandering may be surpassed.

Now, how does one call this **following the Way**?
In the secular world:
to bear sons and daughters,
to take wives and concubines,
to nurture grandchildren and children,
to seek fame and wealth,
to hoard property and land,
to wear fine silks and embroidered robes,
to indulge in lust and desire,
to kill and take life—
all these are but fleeting pleasures for the **colored body**.

Yet this **colored body** is but an illusory vessel of earth, water, fire, and wind,
formed by the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood,
where vital forces coalesce and consciousness takes root,
conceiving life within the womb.
All this arises from the interplay of **yin and yang qi**,
yet it is impermanent, ultimately returning to dust.

Only the two matters of **merit and demerit** do not concern the colored body—
instead, it is the **Dharma-body** that bears the suffering.

Alas! You do not believe,
yet claim the **Dharma-body** resides within the colored body.
When the colored body dies, the Dharma-body is already void—
when a person dies, their **spirit-qi disperses into emptiness**.
How then can one speak of heavens and hells,
of hungry ghosts and beastly rebirths,
or of the Dharma-body receiving retribution?

Now I ask you:
When a person dies, their **spirit-qi disperses into nothingness**—
why then do families, at the four seasons and eight festivals,
set up offerings and sacrifices?
If this lingering **spirit-qi** were not taken by the Underworld to be judged,
then the sins and virtues of this life—
betrayals, thefts, murders, and all manner of karmic debts—
would mean this **spirit-qi** would not return to accept the sacrifices of descendants.

If it does not return to receive the world’s sacrifices,
then why did ancient texts like the *Zhou Li* speak of elaborate sacrificial rites,
sacrificial texts, vessels, and ceremonies?
Why did the Sage Confucius say:
*"To serve the dead as you would the living,
to treat the departed as if they were present,
to sacrifice as though they were there,
to sacrifice to the spirits as if the spirits were there"*—
that when the Duke of Zhou received sacrifices in ceremonial attire,
he appeared *"vast and present, as if standing above, beside"*?
And why does the *Odes* say:
*"The spirit’s response is profound,
unfathomable—
the King stands above,
illuminating the heavens"*?

If such teachings were passed down—
*"as if standing above, the King stands above"*—
then my heart must already harbor sincerity toward the presence of ghosts and spirits.
If my heart holds this sincerity,
then the great sages of old—Zhou Gong and Confucius—
must have deeply known the nature of ghosts and spirits,
and thus established these sacrificial texts, vessels, rites, and ceremonies
to instruct countless generations without end.
Would the sages fabricate lies or conjure falsehoods?

And now, when officials receive posthumous honors and titles,
if the **spirit-qi** after death were truly dispersed and unaware,
then the posthumous glory would already be excessive.
Who receives the golden seals and purple edicts?
Who enjoys the blessings of ascending to heaven?

If receiving blessings means ghosts and spirits are present,
and suffering means they are absent,
then it is only your own heart that is unclear,
your **true nature** that remains unawakened.

There are those foolish and ignorant who,
knowing only lust for wine and women,
obsession with wealth and power,
unaware of the karmic roots of death,
cling only to the fleeting **blood-qi** of life,
and arrogantly recite:
*"Do not ponder the endless affairs of the dead—
just drain the wine while you live."*

Or they might recite:
*"When the body perishes, all else vanishes—
in the underworld, only karma follows the corpse."*

The **Three Karmas** are thus:
The first is **unwholesome karma**—
all its branches and leaves unbroken, unsevered,
endless and unexhausted,
with causes and effects, with deeds and retributions.
Such as disbelief in ghosts and spirits,
disrespect for heaven and earth,
contempt for royal law,
disloyalty to the sovereign,
filial disobedience,
corruption of the Three Bonds and Five Relationships,
slandering the sages,
murder, theft, licentiousness, and **wickedness**—
all such deeds,
when the life ends,
plunge one into hell,
where suffering knows no limit,
and in the next life,
one is reborn as a beast.
After the beastly rebirth,
one returns to human form,
with mutilated limbs,
foolish and dim-witted,
unaware of human affairs,
despised by all,
**hated by all**,
forced into servitude.
Then as a beggar,
the body festers with sores,
infested with lice and filth,
clothing barely covering the skin,
food scarcely filling the mouth,
suffering hunger and cold with no recourse—
until death in the wilderness,
devoured by ants or dragged by dogs,
the lonely spirit again sinks into hell.

The second is **wholesome karma**—
wise and upright,
honest and fair,
bringing joy to kin and neighbors,
respecting parents and deities,
honoring heaven and earth,
loyal to the sovereign,
revering teachers and elders,
loving friends,
refining desires,
untainted by greed or lust,
the Five Relationships unbroken,
all matters considered with care—
as well as those who dwell in mountain hermitages or cave retreats,
who endure hardship and humiliation,
whose **meditative stability** is not yet firm,
whose **Dao-practice** is incomplete—
when their lives end,
they are reborn as officials of rank,
as revered teachers and elders,
or as those who enjoy inherited wealth,
or who attain both longevity and fortune,
living in ease and splendor,
a life of unending happiness.

The third **business** is **pure karma**—
aspiring to sages and saints,
seeking the **Daoist Immortals** and **Buddhas**,
nurturing virtuous thoughts,
speaking wholesome words,
acting in virtuous deeds,
associating with virtuous people,
standing on virtuous lands,
holding virtuous things,
with solemnity and dignity,
body not moving recklessly,
mind not wandering idly,
aiming for clarity,
aiming for stillness—
when **meditative stability** is profound,
the **original spirit** serene and settled,
dwelling perpetually in the **Crimson Chamber**,
within the **Yellow Court**,
in the **Golden Gate and Jade Hall**,
all entanglements suddenly extinguished,
all thoughts dissolved,
seeing only the **true essence**,
forgetting form and matter,
forgetting realm and mechanism—
this is called **samadhi**,
a realm not to be trifled with,
the **Three Purity** realm of **unveiled luminosity**,
transcending the **Thirty-six Heavens** above,
penetrating the **Seventy-two Realms** below,
**freewheeling** beyond the **Three Realms**,
transforming within the **Five Phases** of nature.

In this **samadhi** state,
dim and obscure,
dark and silent,
revolving the heavens and earth,
returning to **Primordial Chaos**,
all as one **Qi**,
neither celestial nor terrestrial,
nor human—
ineffable, indescribable,
beyond conception—
suddenly emitting **spiritual light**,
a wheel of **enlightened nature** surging forth.

The clear becomes **Heaven**,
the turbid becomes **Earth**,
the **harmonious Qi** within is the **Dharma-body**.
Its wisdom pervades the **Three Realms**,
illuminating the **Great Mystery**,
no thing escapes its scrutiny,
no matter remains unknown—
no trace of obstruction,
no thread of hindrance,
no speck of defilement.

All **celestial beings, dragons, ghosts, gods, demons, and fiends**,
all submit to its authority.
The **Yama King** beholds it and dares not raise his voice;
the **Night Marshal** bows in reverence, fists clasped in homage.
With **thin substance and no name**,
the **death ledger** bears no lineage—
eternal life in this world is attained.

Teaching the **Dharma** and liberating beings,
the **spirit** ascends to **transcendence**.
Ultimately entering the **Pure and Empty**,
ascending to the **beginningless court**,
forever freed from **samsara**.

**Assembly of the Great**, the **heavenly mysteries** of **interdependent transformation**,
lie solely in the **movement and stillness of true mind**.

**Stillness** is called **meditative power**,
**true samadhi** is named **wisdom-light**.
If one does not first **kill the false mind**,
calm the **spirit** and settle the **qi**,
how can one attain the **Great Samadhi**?
If one cannot maintain **clarity and stillness**,
how can one enter **samadhi**?
If one cannot enter **samadhi**,
how can one generate **wisdom**?
**Assembly of the Great**, when the mind is empty, the **spirit** is settled;
when the **spirit** is settled, the light arises.
If **samadhi** lacks **wisdom**,
it is but **yin spirit** overcoming **yang spirit**.

**Wisdom** must arise within **samadhi**.
**Wisdom** is the **Dharma-body**,
**samadhi** is the **Buddha’s vessel**.
**Assembly of the Great**, **samadhi** is the **home**,
**precepts** are the **path**,
**wisdom** is the **birth**.
All things, realms, and matters of this world are but **guests**.
If **samadhi** and **wisdom** mutually generate and flourish,
entering the **Gate of All Marvels**,
then the **true essence’s** **spiritual penetration, wisdom, and insight** are fully cultivated,
manifesting luminosity.
One can respond to all things and matters,
yet not be bound by them;
can traverse all worldly realms,
yet not be deluded by them;
can escape **yin-yang, birth-death, and samsara**.

**Assembly of the Great**, first one must understand the **two paths of sin and virtue**,
the **law of cause and effect**,
and adhere strictly to the **precepts**,
not daring to deviate in the slightest.
When **insight** matures through prolonged contemplation,
**clarity and stillness** naturally arise.
Then, one proceeds to **enter stillness through contemplative samadhi**.
Within **samadhi**, the **original nature** is round and bright,
the **wisdom-light** radiant,
and the **spirit-qi** suddenly awakens.
Then **mountains, rivers, and great earth**,
do not exist beyond the self;
all **things’ birth and death**,
do not exist beyond a single thought.
From the **true essence’s** luminous clarity,
one gains the **handle** to avoid **samsara**.
This **middle character’s** work,
neither father nor son can substitute,
nor **gods and spirits** know—
only you must personally tend to it.

**Assembly of the Great**, I raise the **heavenly ladder**,
yet who will ascend it?
I prop the **Dao raft**,
yet who will board it?

Listen to the poor Daoist’s gatha:

*"The River of Love vast and boundless, none cross it,
The Sea of Suffering endless, few bridges of dharma.
Assembly, swiftly uphold the Three Hundred Precepts—
Effortlessly, wisdom and samadhi rise above the waves."*

**Eleven Secret Practices for True Cultivation**

Assembly, since you have vowed to cultivate the True and become a Complete Reality Daoist, you must first distinguish clearly between true and false, penetrating their nature, before applying your efforts. To transform the false into the true with all your strength—that is the duty of those who cultivate.

Assembly, listen now to what is false, so you may cultivate what is true.

Assembly, even this body of yours is false—
a fleeting, illusory form of impermanence.
The six senses will surely decay,
the six cognitions will ultimately dissolve.
Qi passes through a thousand uses,
yet when impermanence arrives, all ends.

Assembly, have you not seen how mortals are born—
nine chi in height, ten spans around the waist;
faces round as full moons, lips like crimson dots?

Eyes like polished lacquer, skin smooth as fine wax;
Countenance noble and imposing, bearing fierce and commanding.
Speaking with eloquence, cunning in speech,
A thousand stratagems, ten thousand schemes of guile.
Wise in letters, skilled in martial prowess,
High-ranking officials and mighty generals—
Artisans and talents, merchants and schemers,
Grasping profit, contending for renown.
Greedy for glory, striving for display,
Amassing wealth like southern mountains’ treasure.

In painted halls, twelve golden hairpins—
Flutes and zithers, songs and dances.
On jade steps, three thousand bejeweled slippers—
Bowing and curtsying, ever obsequious.
Gold and silver surpassing the Northern Dipper,
Jade feasts and brocade robes—
At every meal, delicacies beyond count;
In every gathering, refined etiquette in abundance.

When wives reach half their years, they are cast aside for the new;
Consorts in throngs, forgotten when vitality wanes.
Wealth piled high, vast fields as the foundation of prosperity;
Children thriving, yet one rank still feels too small.

Day and night without rest, lost in flowers and lust;
Love and greed without end, body weary, mind exhausted.

「When scorching heat and dampness give way to cold winds,
The six pulses of yin and yang fall into disarray.

Chasing steeds and hunting game, the three souls scatter and flee—
A thousand maladies assail, aging, sickness, and woe;
A thousand calamities cling, weariness and exhaustion evermore.

Taking *shēn* and *líng* in vain, they cry to heaven and earth but find no response—
A thousand agonies defy utterance,
Till one day the breath is cut, and they descend to the netherworld.

Stately in bearing, yet before the body cools, men turn away in disgust;
Awe-inspiring in presence, yet once the eyes close, the face is turned to the sky.

Four limbs bound in wood, a single corpse reduced to paper—
No sons to avenge, no consorts to follow.

While the corpse yet lies cold, the living already plot—
Brothers divide wealth and seize estates,
Wives and concubines hoard treasures for their own security.

Those with children ponder how to live better;
Those without sons scheme to remarry.

Guests and carriages grow scarce at the door,
As the saying goes: *"A man lives by his connections."*

Servants within steal and plunder,
Yet dare not speak, for *"the fallen are preyed upon by their own."*

When walls crumble and furniture is scattered, who cares?
When fortunes fade, who knows?

Wanton wives and unworthy sons,
Each attend to their own futures.

Who has ever died and lived again?
Who has ever gone and returned?

Born with empty hands, they die with nothing—
The mortal form returns to dust, the name vanishes into emptiness;
The paths of virtue and vice are clear, and retribution is manifest.

Behold, this mortal guise—a phantom of illusion—
Is it not all false?

Yet in their pursuit of wealth, noble rank,
Wives and concubines, grandchildren, honor and riches,
Not a shred of true spirit remains—
This is no falsehood.

Where has this true spirit gone?
Plainly, it is in the afterlife.

If it is plainly there, why cling to wives and children,
To riches and honor?

This is the dual path of virtue and vice—
Guilt and reward, suffering and joy—
As real as shadow clinging to form.

The mortal body endures suffering and punishment—
How could there be the slightest escape?

Thus, you must regard the mortal form as light,
The *dharma-body* as heavy,
Use the false to cultivate the true,
Preserve the true and abandon the false,
To seek liberation from the sea of woe.

Yet without this mortal form,
There is no means to practice—
Then the single spark of the *dharma-body*
Cannot act on its own,
And falls back into the six realms of rebirth—
This would be labor in vain.

Since we have attained human birth,
Entered the Dao,
We must escape the cycle of rebirth—
While sight and vigor remain,
Diligently cultivate the true.

How does one cultivate?
By purifying the six senses’ gates of dust,
Harmonizing the five *zàng* organs and five *qì*—
The true self abides in the *lingtái*,
Unassailable by demons—
Performing countless good deeds,
And uprooting the roots of sin.

Yet within this cultivation of the true,
There are two paths—
Some true, some false,
Some with effort, some without.
The *Vajra Sutra* says:
*"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows,
Like dew, like lightning—thus they are."*

The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:
*"Why do beings not attain the true Dao?
For they have deluded minds."*

What these two scriptures teach
Reveals that conditioned practices are not the way.

There is one school that claims to *"transfer essence and vitalize qi*,
To *"merge life and prolong vitality*,
To *"reverse aging and restore youth*,
To *"achieve eternal life*—
All through clinging to form.

And another that speaks of *"raising lead and lowering mercury*,
Of *"forging the cauldron and burning the thatch*,
Of *"ingesting elixirs of immortality*,
Of *"swallowing talismans and feasting on vital qi*—
These too are *"cultivating the true through the false*,
All manner of conditioned, deceptive practices—
How could they reveal nature and establish life,
To escape the cycle of rebirth?

To transcend birth and death,
It is not this way one emerges.

Cultivating the true through the false,
One must examine the great matter of life and death—
Truly understand the path of the Dao.

What is this path?
It lies in the harmony or discord of your single mind.

If in harmony, it follows its course;
If in discord, it answers to you.

The mortal body must die—
Whether cultivated or not, it dies.
Even if they live a thousand years,
They still return to dust—
So why the struggle?

The form has birth, it must decay;
It has a beginning, it must end;
It is shaped, it must dissolve;
It is gathered, it must disperse;
It comes, it must go;
It succeeds, it must fail;
It thrives, it must age.

Since the body is born,
It must die.

The cultivation of transcending birth and death
I speak of does not concern this body—
It merely uses it as a dwelling place,
To cultivate the *dharma-body* of heaven’s command.

External teachings do not grasp this truth,
And thus take the true as false,
Clinging to form—
They seek to preserve this blood-flesh body,
To make it unbreakable and undying—
Is this not laughable?

The cultivation of transcending birth and death
I speak of lies solely within this body’s true mind—
In the thoughts that move it,
In the deeds it performs.

When deluded thoughts cease,
The *dharma-body* is born;
When the *dharma-body* is still,
Heaven’s mechanism stirs;
When heaven’s mechanism moves,
The true light appears.

It is this true light that cannot be fully realized,
Thus, through this mortal form, we perform good deeds.

Yet good deeds too have true and false—
Clinging to form is false;
Not clinging to form is true.

Observe the Thus-Come-One—
He gives without clinging to form,
He performs merit without clinging to form,
He teaches without clinging to form,
He cultivates without clinging to form.
He emerges from the world without clinging to form—
Thus he can emerge from the world.
Because he can emerge from the world,
He can transcend birth and death.

The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:
*"The highest virtue is non-virtue."*
This means non-attachment—
Only thus is liberation possible.
How then can one transcend birth and death?」

The years you gain are but few—
merely accumulating blessings, no more.
When blessings are exhausted,
you still cannot escape the wheel of rebirth.

Assembled ones, I urge you to follow the words of the Most High—
only when you transcend the body while the body remains,
and follow the body while the body departs,
can you die without perishing.

Assembled ones, set aside your mortal form—
do not cling to the agitation of *jing* and *qi*,
coveting their ascent and descent,
the unblocking of orifices,
the circulation of blood and vessels,
to prolong life and ward off illness.
If you cling to these pursuits,
you will only fixate on the firmness of your fleshly body,
reveling in ease and freedom,
while neglecting your true nature for years without tending to it.

You do not know that one day,
when the lesser demons catch you unawares,
they will suddenly drag you away.
At that moment, where will your *Dharmakāya* follow the waves?
Your mortal form will sink into the muddy pit—
all for naught.

I exhort you to practice the secret work of subduing the mind and enduring with patience,
so that you may soon see your true nature.
Why then would you fear your fate not standing firm?

Assembled ones, I remind you—
the mortal form is but a dwelling,
while the *Dharmakāya* is its inhabitant.
If the master possesses treasure,
why should the dwelling not be orderly?
If the master falls ill or invites calamity,
or is dragged away by fate,
what use is this well-kept dwelling?
Who will dwell in it then?

I reveal another layer to awaken you—
the mortal form is a rented house, not owned.
When the master departs, it returns to the earth,
its elements dissolving back into the Four Great Ones.

If you secretly cultivate a *Dharmakāya* unclinging to form,
why should you fear the mortal form not finding a proper end?

Assembled ones, I offer my clumsy verses—
listen as I recite them:

*"The mortal form is the Dharmakāya’s house,
When its depths are bright, its exterior shines.
May the master cultivate virtue and wisdom—
Why should the house not radiate splendor?
First, the false must be dispelled,
The true *Dharma* requires casting off falsehood.
Do not boast of non-attachment,
Dual-cultivate nature and life beyond impermanence.
Only when the mind is stilled can liberation be sought,
The phantom body set aside reveals the true self.
Clinging to life and fearing death—death must come.
Modifying form to seek the true—how can the true be attained?
The Thus-Come-One severed body and form,
The Jade Emperor once endured as a patient man.
Forgotten body, lost life for three thousand *kalpas*,
Abandoning kingdom for mountain in eight hundred *xun*.
The Daoist clings to the false skin-bag,
Through countless *kalpas* and lives, never transcending dust.
Cease with intent, exhaust the spirit—
Form, in the end, returns to the void.
If you lose sight of the true *Suchness*-nature,
The sea of suffering stretches endlessly.
Alas, pitiful—
Layered falsehoods within falsehood,
In vain learning the Whole Truth—how can the true be found?
Birth, old age, sickness, sorrow, fear, and death—
At death, how different are you from the world’s folk?
In vain donning the yellow cap and feathered robes,
Have you ever known the mechanism of life and death?
Seeking food and clothing, wandering the world’s edge,
Guilt and retribution cling—man turns to mud."*

If you do not realize that guilt and blessings are originally empty,
then birth and death’s wheel will never cease.
If you fail to awaken to the false and true within yourself,
then who will open the light of wisdom?

Assembled ones, reflect deeply—
life and death are fleeting and swift.

I have spoken of the secret practices—three hundred in number,
which are the *Zhongji* Great Precepts in their minutiae.
To cultivate the body makes it upright,
to cultivate the mind erases delusion.
Internally applied, it brings sainthood;
externally applied, it brings kingship.
You may transcend the mundane and attain the fruit of purity and stillness,
deliver others from suffering,
and end the cycle of birth and death.

The most critical aspect is the *secret*—
without secrecy, you cannot achieve the Whole Truth.
Without the Whole Truth, the mind remains unclear,
and an unclear mind cannot perceive the true nature.

Assembled ones, how then is secrecy practiced?
The sage uses this to purify the heart and retreat into secrecy.
Secrecy is the utmost vigilance—
precision leads to hidden concealment, the ultimate of secrecy.

Assembled ones, for those who receive the *Zhongji* Precepts,
the first to the hundredth precepts are the great divine spells of purifying the body.
Hold these spells with reverence—
your body’s agitation must be entirely dispelled,
transforming into clarity and stillness,
vanquishing recklessness and replacing it with steadiness.
Observe the Four Great Comportments:
walk with measured steps,
sit without leaning to one side,
stand erect, never against walls or pillars,
leaning on tables or walls.
Lie curled and sideways, never supine with loud breathing.
Even a faint nasal sound must be adjusted—
cultivate a demeanor of reverent propriety, called *external solemnity*.

The hundredth to the two-hundredth precepts are the great divine spells of purifying the mind.
Merge these spells with the Dao through profound contemplation—
you must engage in secret, penetrating insight,
returning each thought to the true,
aligning each moment with the Way,
never slackening in word or deed.
Reflect again and again, awaken again and again—
observe distant things and examine your own self,
stripping away chaotic and perverse thoughts until none remain.
Only when the true heart is serene and settled
do you proceed to the two-hundredth to the three-hundredth precepts,
the great divine spells of purifying intent.
Not a thread may be leaked—
their subtle mechanisms and flowing principles
are hidden in the mysterious treasury of the arcane.
Subtle and wondrous, beyond conception or description,
graspable only through divine insight, not through speech.
The supreme, effortless, wondrous Dao is thus exhausted.

Assembled ones, this is the secret practice of cultivating the true.
Listen carefully to my final words—
the supreme Way must never be divulged.

Assembled ones, to cultivate the true and escape birth and death—
is this not an extraordinary matter?

The celestial mechanism, if not kept secret, will leak to the unworthy—
thus, **Zhongyang Zhang Zhenren** was struck by Heaven three times for revealing it to the unworthy,
and so it must never be divulged.

What more, to transcend the wheel of rebirth,
to leap beyond the world,
and become a **True Person** unshaken through ten thousand kalpas—
is this not what the **Heavenly and Earthly spirits** forbid,
and what the **Yin and Yang** of creation resent?

Yet you now reverse fortune and act contrary,
opposing the **Dao** of the world like ice and fire.

You must be cautious and thorough—
otherwise, your kin will not favor you,
your extended family will turn to enmity,
your wife and children will grow estranged,
and your friends will lose faith,
all because you lack the **bold and mighty resolve**,
and thus abandon the **Dao-heart**.

**Twelvefold Retribution and Erasure of Karmic Debt**—
Assembled ones, since you have taken the **precepts of leaving home**,
seeking the **path of liberation**,
the **deep-seated grudges** of a thousand lifetimes,
the **ancestral resentments** of generations,
must all be **confessed and purged**,
now and forever eradicated,
so that **retributive suffering** may be cleansed.

But this is still the deed of the **lower vehicle** and **inferior retribution**,
the act of those fleeing debts and grudges,
fearing death while clinging to life,
the **weak-willed and powerless** of lesser **Dao**.

Such a person’s **heart-mind** is unclear,
their **inherent nature** yet unseen—
they only seek present gain,
neglecting future lives.
Now I speak to you of this **outer path**,
so that you may know and understand.

There was once a **Daoist** who left home midway,
wandering and seeking teachings,
who met several **fellow travelers**,
and together vowed to **cultivate the Way**.
They built a **hermitage** on **Laoshan** in Shandong,
but later, due to war,
they descended together.
At **Wangwu Mountain** in Henan,
they sat alone in meditation.

Though six resided there,
they were not of one resolve—
each had their own **practice**.
After one year,
three departed.
The remaining three renewed their vows,
seeking **liberation** together.

Later, one of them **passed in meditation**,
and the other two grew even more resolute.
Then another **passed in meditation**,
leaving only one to **solitary cultivation**.

While sitting in meditation,
in **deep absorption**,
their **spirit wandered** to **Tiantai Mountain**,
where they suddenly encountered a **former Dao-friend** who had also **passed in meditation**.
The two rejoiced greatly.

The **former Dao-friend** said:
*"We have met by fate—
I now must tell you:
you should revise the vow you took last year.
I, at that time, vowed to **cultivate the Way**,
to **confess and purge** my **karmic offenses**,
and seek **deliverance**.
Yet when my **earthly life** was exhausted,
at the **Third Heaven’s gate**,
I was summoned before the **celestial officials**,
who loudly proclaimed:
*'This person’s **karmic roots** remain—
they cannot escape their **kalpa**,*
*their name is absent from the **Heavenly Register**,
*their place is none on the **Elixir Peaks**—
*they may not advance further,
*but shall be appointed to the **Threefold Council** of **Yuntai Mountain**,
*the **Capital of the Three Elements**.'*

*Immediately, the **mighty winds** and **fierce qi***
*sealed the **Heavenly Gate**,
and I saw no way forward.
My body was sent to the **Threefold Council**,
where I met the **Three Officials of the Netherworld**.
They examined my **karmic ledger**,
and declared:
*'You are of the **lower vehicle**, a **petty resolve** from a **side path**—
*you dare to **transcend**?
*Today, we spare you for your **ignorance on the wrong path**,
*as the **mountain god of Tiantai and Tongbo** lacks a **post**,
*so you shall temporarily **administer their duties**,
*and when a **vacancy arises in the Netherworld**,
*you will be **officially appointed**.'*

*I then pleaded for instruction,
so I might **cultivate in the underworld**,
and the **Three Officials**, in their **merciful countenance**, commanded:
*'When you sat on the **cushion** in meditation,
your **intent was not pure**,
your **mind was not empty**—
you had not **penetrated** the **truth that the colored body is empty**,
that **inherent nature is real**,
nor had you **awakened** to the **non-emptiness within emptiness**.
You only knew that **karmic debts of a thousand lives** must be **confessed and purged**,
that **ancestral grudges of generations** must be **erased**,
and that after **leaving home**,
no **karmic debts or offenses** would arise again.
Yet you never **deeply investigated** or **fully awakened**—
how could **grudges and grudges** be **erased** from **inherent nature**,
or **karmic offenses** be **confessed and purged**?

*Who says that the **karmic roots** you have accumulated through kalpas,*
*the **grudges** you have created in lifetimes past,*
*can be **cleared** by a mere **utterance** or **thought**,
*so that **karmic retribution** may vanish like **dust in the wind**?

*You must first **enter the path** and **establish resolve**,
*learn the **highest vehicle** and **great karmic roots**,
*and take **universal salvation** as your aspiration.
For the **great vehicle of the highest path**,
the **common mind is instantly extinguished**,
and **Heaven and Earth become empty**,
**illusory forms** reduced to **ashes**—
then **self and others are one**,
and only **ancestral karmic debts** and **deep-seated grudges** remain,
**unable to be resolved**,
**owing wealth and life**—
how can they be **dismissed lightly**?

*Thus, the **Ancient Buddhas**, like **Ārya Rāja**,*
*severed limbs to **repay past offenses**,
*not omitting even a hair’s breadth,*
*and only then **attained** the **Buddha Śākyamuni**.
*The Sixth Patriarch*
**washed away ancestral grudges**,
**received even the subtlest karmic debts**,
and only then **attained** the **Great Mirror of the Western Heaven**.

*Yet you, with **petty resolve** and **weak roots**,
refuse to **repay karmic debts**,
only seeking to **escape suffering**—
you cling too firmly to the **colored body’s reality**,
fearing **retributive encounters**,
**punishment**, **beating**, **execution**, or **pain**,
and your **one thought** is to keep the **colored body** ever **comfortable**.
This **fear of repayment for private gain** is your **weak root**,
and it marks you as of the **lower vehicle**.

*So long as **karmic roots** are not **empty**,
they will **rearise in future kalpas**,
and **offenses remain**—
in **later lives**, you will **encounter them again**.
You call yourself **one who has left home**,
but in truth, you are **fleeing suffering**.
Unable to **escape suffering**,
you will be **entangled by kalpas**,
**grudges extending through generations**—
all because your **initial vow was weak**,
and your **aspiration too narrow**.

*This life, you have only **left home in name**,
**cultivating merit** but not the **Dao**.
You should **enter the wheel of rebirth**,
**transmigrate** to **reap merit**.
Yet because you once **recited** the **Supreme Emperor’s Scripture** (*Huangdi Fabao*) for a hundred volumes,
and **chanted** the **Miracles of Amitābha’s Name** (*Mile Baohao*) for three years,
with **sincere and ardent devotion**,
you were **enrolled** as a **Zhengyi True Person**,
and **deserve** the **rank of Netherworld Official**.
Now, as you remain in the world,
**acting as a sponsor** for scripture recitations,
you have not **failed** in your **karmic duties**.
As for **receiving wealth** from others,
you have also **distributed it** and **used it properly**—
by **reason**, you should **advance in rank**,
and **gain another stage**.

This register is **selected for enrollment** as a **Minister of the Celestial Peaks’ Mountain Spirit**, and you must **proceed at once** to **oversee its duties**. **In the unseen realm**, you shall **cultivate and refine**—do not **grow negligent**.

*"I then suddenly awoke to self-realization, regretting my limited aspiration. Only now do I grasp: small causes yield small fruits, great vows bring great rewards. My repentance comes too late—now I must enter your realm of **pure and enlightened spiritual insight** to speak with you.*

*Since each must attend to their appointed duties, I dare not leave the mountain to wander. **Dao-friend**, your arrival is most timely—you must **renew your solemn vow**. For all **wronged kin**, you must **not shrink from retribution**, with **unwavering resolve**, only then can your fruit be great. If you harbor even a trace of **hesitation or fear**, you risk **karmic evasion**—and though you may gain your hands, your **fruit of attainment** will never be grand."*

Having spoken, the figure vanished.

The **Daoist adept** emerged from meditation, now recognizing this as merely a **self-serving, lower-grade heterodox** who would remain but a **mountain spirit** in the end. In haste, he **burned his thatched hut**, **slung his meditation cushion and staff**, and **once more turned inward** to **cultivate the mind**.

**Enduring all humiliation**, **bearing all suffering**, **practicing all deeds**—
**Dispelling all stray thoughts**, **forging body and mind**—
**Vowing to resolve all karmic entanglements**, **unflinching before blade or axe**.
**This fleshly form** is seen as **impermanent**;
**This innate life** is held **pure and untainted**.

**Unencumbered and unobstructed, undisturbed and unalarmed.**
**Bare as the red flesh, radiant and bright, round and luminous, pure and naked—**
**Coming and going with perfect ease.**

**When fortune comes, he refuses to accept it;**
**When suffering comes, he does not shirk it.**
**With this singular resolve, he endured many years.**

**Suddenly, one day, within his meditative stillness,**
**A Daoist adept approached, bowing in reverence.**
**Gazing upon him, it was the same disciple from before—**
**The one who had first taken the path.**
**His form remained unchanged, but his face bore shame,**
**Daring not to meet the gaze above.**

**Asked of his circumstances, he confessed:**
**Once, he had followed his master’s perverse Dao,**
**Ignorant of the true principle within.**
**He had long directed his vital qi to the elixir field,**
**And through prolonged practice, became a guardian of the corpse.**
**His light extended but a foot in measure,**
**Illuminating only his own skeletal frame—**
**Beyond that, all remained in darkness,**
**Revealing nothing.**

**Now, because this Daoist adept entered stillness,**
**His light expanded, drawing in the earlier departed disciple**
**Into his meditative realm.**
**In but a moment, he too vanished.**

**Yet this later, still-living adept grew ever clearer in insight.**
**For life resides within the nature—**
**Each increment of understanding brings greater light;**
**Each increase of light brings greater wisdom;**
**Each growth of wisdom brings greater virtue and blessing;**
**Each accumulation of virtue and blessing elevates the fruit of attainment.**

**Thus, he emerged from meditation.**

This Daoist adept, questioning himself—
the six senses purged, the eight consciousnesses dissolved,
the five aggregates all emptied, the seven emotions severed—
now possessed the final refuge in the Eternal-Clear, Eternal-Still Great Heavenly Sovereign.

Yet, born of parents, nurtured by heaven and earth,
the mortal frame’s *qi* and fate had reached their limit.
On the next day, descending to the mountain’s outer gates,
he told the assembled disciples:
*“Now I must take leave of you all—*
*turning back to depart.”*

The crowd asked: *“Why depart so swiftly?”*
The adept replied: *“My three karmas are repaid,*
*but the four debts remain unpaid.*
*Only rebirth can fulfill this final resolve.”*

With hands clasped, he bowed in homage to the void—
then sat in final stillness.

Listen, all of you:
their Dao may differ in correctness,
their aspirations vary in scale.
These three—judging by their final insight,
their fruit of attainment—
differ vastly in rank.

Greatness lies in the will.
Smallness in the petty.
A will unexpanded,
a heart unbroadened,
a capacity unwide—
wishes narrow, scope confined,
knowledge shallow, vision cramped—
then the *qi* one cultivates
fills but a phantom skin-sack,
not the boundless *Tai Pei*,
not the heavens and earth,
not the sun and moon,
not all sentient beings.

How can this be called the Great Dao?

Born beneath heaven and earth,
bathed by sun and moon,
nurtured by parents,
guided by ruler and teacher—
these are the four debts.
Their depth is boundless, their repayment impossible.
Yet still, one clings to the colored form,
trapped in the five aggregates’ suffering,
struggling to transcend.
Dual cultivation of virtue and wisdom
remains but fleeting.

Now that you have taken refuge in the Triple Jewel,
why do you not transcend suffering?
Virtue and wisdom are but the ocean of desire—
the ancients said:
*“A thousand waves in the river of love,*
*a million layers in the sea of desire.”*
Only when the waters dry and the waves cease
can the true nature’s source be revealed.

You must perceive the unity of all beings—
from womb-born, egg-born, wet-born, or formed—
none without awareness.
Recognize that self and other share the same source:
this is repaying heaven.
Endless, vast compassion,
bearing filth, enduring insult—
all share the same breath:
this is repaying earth.

The nature of heaven is luminous,
the nature of earth is clear.
To the lost in darkness, speak the true word,
breaking their confusion.
To the drowning in delusion, preach the Dharma,
removing their obstacles—
this is repaying sun and moon.

Follow the teacher’s instructions,
obey the state’s laws,
revere the sovereign’s decrees—
never overstep bounds,
never violate virtue or custom.
Uphold the pure precepts,
honor the sacred texts,
pray for the emperor’s longevity,
preserve the imperial mandate.
Pass this on to future generations,
proclaiming the true Dao—
this is repaying ruler and teacher.

The body comes from parents:
do not soil even a hair.
Eliminate self and other’s attachments,
atoning for the sufferings of the dark realm.
Repay past parents’ toil,
dissolving the bonds of countless lives.
Ease the present family’s hardships,
atoning for every transgression.
Only by exhausting this mortal form
can filial piety know no end.
If parents are not liberated,
one cannot attain the True.

Revere all beings’ parents as your own,
love all children as your own flesh.
Thus, the Seven Mysteries ascend,
the Three Dynasties soar—
this is repaying parents.

Yet if your heart remains obstructed—
how can you perceive the Three Pure Ones,
the Jade Emperor, the Three Officials and Four Saints,
the Five Elders and Seven Worthies?

You still divide self and other,
clinging to ignorance.
Your chest is narrow—
you cannot endure a single matter.
Your capacity is small—
you cannot contain even one person.
You judge without discernment,
distorting right and wrong.
Praise brings joy, insult brings rage.
Your resolve is shallow,
your thoughts unilluminated.
Your heart lacks tolerance,
your body grows sluggish.
You dismiss minor losses as trivial,
boast of fleeting virtues—
how can you repay heaven, earth, ruler, teacher, or kin?

To repay heaven and earth’s debt,
you must know their Dao,
embody their heart,
grasp their principle,
realize their virtue.
In the darkest chamber, deceive none—
sever all delusive emotions.
With wisdom’s light universally shining,
all defilements are truly borne.
In loss, take loss—
no trace of self remains.
In suffering, endure suffering—
no trace of deceit lingers.
Practice is sincere,
the realm is luminous.
Virtue profound, the Dao exalted—
ghosts and spirits bow in reverence.
Spirit clear, wisdom awakened—
all things submit, people return.
Above, you commune with the Celestial Throne;
below, you command the thunderbolts.
In drought, pray for rain to nourish the people;
in flood, pray for clear skies to lift the calamity.
Demons and spirits cower and flee.
Above, bless the eternal fortress,
the emperor’s boundless years;
below, bless the land’s songs,
the people’s joyous labor.

This is to uphold the ancestral tradition,
to spread the Dao’s transformation.

As for your parents—
ten months in the womb,
three years at the breast—
their toil was boundless, their love profound.
When grown, they hoped for filial care in old age,
for their lineage’s glory.
The ruler, in sleepless vigil,
oversees the six ministries and nine officials,
governing and transforming,
suppressing evil, upholding virtue,
honoring the worthy, valuing the virtuous—
how shallow their merit could be?

You now dwell at home yet cannot properly honor and nourish your parents,
nor, when in service, can you aid the state with wise counsel.
Your robes are bestowed by the charity of countless households,
your meals rely on the labor of ten thousand farmers.

Yet you drift like waves on the tide,
all day long in idle confusion,
idle hands, idle mouths,
muttering nonsense,
neither cultivating virtue nor adhering to precepts.
When you act, you violate the rules;
your mind is clouded, your spirit scattered.

Ascend the altar to pray for the nation—
the spirits and gods refuse to descend.
Drive away demons and purify the land—
plagues and calamities remain unhealed.
Your talismans hold no power,
your supplications are in vain.

The lowly among you, when struck by drought or flood,
blame the wind and curse the rain,
hate the earth and resent the heavens,
roam recklessly, and in defiance,
offend your kin and break the laws.
See the ox, horse, donkey, and mule,
the pig, sheep, dog, and swine—
each possesses five senses and six orifices,
the interplay of yin and yang, male and female,
awareness and vitality.
Yet today, they speak only because of this one mouth.

Ah! At that time, the Master of Precepts proclaimed this gatha:

*"With wisdom and insight both refined,
the precepts pure, heaven and hell clearly known.
Not a thread of clinging—light forever bright,
a thousand burdens cast off—mind at ease.
Life’s mandate from Heaven, unalterable fate,
to transcend birth and death, sincerity is key.
False paths and deceptions multiply like branches—
I urge all to awaken to the true and pure.

The four debts unpaid bring shame,
the three defilements remain—Dao unfulfilled.
To repay the four debts, first guard the precepts,
to dissolve the three defilements, cultivate the True.

Guard the precepts and walk the righteous Way,
cultivate the True and fathom life’s fleeting show.
When life’s illusion is seen through,
the three defilements fade—repay the four debts.
To escape the world and leave the home,
greed, anger, delusion cling—true liberation far.

When worldly passions are exhausted, the heart grows pure,
when true nature shines, the Dao draws near.
Who is real when the colored form is seen through?
Who knows true life when all things are observed?
Not a thread of attachment—three minds released,
the ten precepts fully embraced, free and unbound."*

**Thirteen Resolutions and Vows**

People of the Assembly,
from ancient sages to immortals and Buddhas,
they saw through worldly illusions—all conditioned things,
all forms as empty and false.
Thus they sought to transcend the mundane,
to escape birth and death,
to retreat into the mountains,
to forget the body and perish the self,
all in pursuit of the ultimate Dao.

You know only the names of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,
yet not their true essence.
You all desire to become sages, immortals, or Buddhas,
yet have not truly taken the vow to do so.
You all wish to attain their fruits,
yet do not cultivate their causes.
You all aspire to their station,
yet lack the resolve to make it so.

Thus, though your words may speak of the Dao,
your heart does not understand.
For the Dao remains unclear when no master of truth is met,
and the Dao cannot be practiced without those who walk its path.

Those who merely claim the name "Daoist"—
have they ever grasped its profound essence?
Those who call themselves "Perfect Truth"—
who truly embodies its reality?
No wonder filial piety decays,
no wonder ancestral traditions wither.

Now that you have taken refuge in the Three Jewels
and upheld the precepts,
you have indeed met a master of truth.
But to truly walk the Dao,
you must follow my true words
and act as sages, immortals, and Buddhas do.
Only then are you practitioners of the Way.

People of the Assembly,
before sages, immortals, and Buddhas attained the Dao,
they were no different from you—ordinary mortals,
no extra eyes, no added hands.
Yet they possessed resolve:
to seek the path of transcendence,
to understand the nature of birth and death.

This resolve alone set them apart—
a hundredfold brighter, a thousandfold broader.
Though their bodies remained mortal,
their minds already bore the mark of the sage.

But sages do not merely speak of transcending the world;
they truly harbor such thoughts in their hearts
and act accordingly.
Thus they are called "Great Heroes,"
endowed with great compassion.

True men, teachers of heaven and earth,
are made by their resolve—uncommon from the start.
Their deeds are mighty:
with wisdom-swords gleaming on their shoulders,
eyebrows raised like lightning bolts;
with precept-blades at their throats,
eyes flashing like thunder.

Heretics tremble in fear and flee,
evil winds quake and seek refuge.
Ascending to the Nine-Graded Lotus Platform,
they take their place upon the Law-King’s throne.
Their words resound as pure Dharma,
cleansing all who hear.
Their bodies emit sacred *qi* and fragrant elixirs,
liberating all who behold.

After attaining the Dao, their great resolve fulfilled,
they vow anew:
to abandon self, others, life, and all attachments.
Not to enlighten themselves alone,
but to enlighten all beings.
With the method of self-liberation,
they universally save all sentient life—
yet never demand that others possess their own resolve.

They take the common heart as their own.
For the common folk are but another name for sentient beings,
and sentient beings are our own kind.
With the law of our kind,
we save our kind.
Without enlightenment for all,
there is no attainment of the Dao.

The *Qingjing Jing* says:
*"Though named as one who has attained the Dao,
in truth, nothing is gained.
To transform sentient beings is to attain the Dao.
Those who awaken may pass on the sacred teaching."*

People of the Assembly,
sages, immortals, and Buddhas differ not from mortals.
The difference lies only in public and private:
the sage acts with fairness and impartiality,
for others, not for self;
the common man acts with deceit and selfishness,
for self, not for others.

The sage is but clear and serene, the common man but murky and restless.
The sage wields inner firmness to discipline the self,
outer gentleness to serve others;
the common man uses inner softness to excuse himself,
outer harshness to blame others.
The sage ever fears his own faults,
the common man only accuses others’ errors.

Where the sage treads with care,
the common man steps into peril with reckless abandon.
The sage, though not yet dead,
first understands the workings of death’s aftermath;
the common man, even facing death,
still clings to fleeting life’s calculations.

The sage seeks the *out-worldly Dao*,
refining worldly affairs to purify the heart—
as a son, he fulfills filial duty,
as a subject, he fulfills loyalty;
the common man knows neither *out-worldly Dao* nor even worldly law,
how could he know to be loyal to his lord or filial to his kin?

Pitiful are these deluded, unaware masses,
who neither grasp worldly law nor *out-worldly Dao*.
Day and night they drift in drunkenness and dreams,
living in vain, dying in vain—
born in the morning, dying by evening,
stealing life, fearing death,
blindly living, blindly dying.

They bury their true spirit and nature in this foul skin-bag,
endlessly wandering through countless *kalpas*,
unaware of their inversion,
flipping and turning,
changing faces and forms,
endless cycles of rebirth,
never knowing when they might escape.

Assembly,
if you have already received the *precepts*,
then you have already escaped.

To escape is to leave suffering,
to leave suffering is to leave the world.

Assembly,
to leave suffering, first you must endure it.
If you do not endure suffering, you cannot leave it.

You must heed the true words of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,
not merely chase their hollow names.
You must establish the resolve of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,
not idly speak of their fruits.
You must plant the roots of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,
then naturally reap their rewards.
You must accumulate the *virtue/power* of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,
then naturally attain their Dao.
You must act in their manner,
then naturally realize their station.

If you act without principle and speak beyond truth,
you remain but a stagnant common man.
To vainly imagine the Dao of sages, immortals, and Buddhas—
could such a spiritless one ever walk it?

Assembly,
you must set great resolve and vow great aspiration,
only then may you escape the world.

Thus the *gāthā* is spoken:

*"Hear my words, O precept-holder, with resolve set firm,
for resolve can free you from birth and death.
First endure suffering to discipline mind and body,
for when suffering ends, sweetness comes—death becomes rebirth.
With resolve, clear your heart of dust and delusion,
and reverse the common world’s inverted ways.
Hold aloft the staff of the *Great Void*,
unshaken on the *White Jade Platform* of true space.
Do not wish for *action* to become *external Dao*,
nor for *inaction* to stray into false teaching.
Neither void nor full in balanced aspiration,
neither existence nor nonexistence in awakened practice.

Set resolve unmoved by shifting conditions,
though dangers rise, your heart remains undisturbed.
With heart’s law, you turn the realm of senses—
wisdom’s light spreads when heaven’s gate opens wide.
Set resolve unmoved by worldly things,
for when moved by them, you lose your true nature.
Once power and authority slip from your grasp,
the demon’s hand turns you—regret comes too late.

Set resolve unshaken by worldly affairs,
for stubbornness clings like a fettering rope.
When reason is clear and affairs understood,
obstacles dissolve into void.
Liberated in true space, illusions vanish.

Set resolve unshaken by what the ears hear,
for within the ear-root lies the true teaching.
Guard against sound’s leakage that clouds true nature,
first endure hardship to seal your ears’ hearing.

Set resolve unshaken by what the eyes see,
for within the light lies the birth of emptiness.
Guard against light’s dissipation that scatters vital spirit,
when sight is gone, the heart alone rules.

Set resolve unshaken by what the mouth speaks,
for merging with the Dao, speech returns to nature.
When teaching is spoken, no words are needed—
no words, no speech, yet *qi* flows unbroken.

Set resolve unshaken by what the tongue tastes,
for harming life, killing beings, spirits and demons forbid.
Golden nectar, jade essence, fragrant *sāmbhava*—
divine waters, sweet as *gāndhāra*, quench the thirst.
Set resolve unshaken by what the nose smells,
for worldly scents stir false desires that corrupt true constancy.
Since you have freed yourself from the scent of heaven,
each has their own heart-scent to offer the sky.

Set resolve unshaken by the body’s wild movements,
for always guard decorum, never slack in reverence.
Filial disobedience taints and corrupts the root of the Dao—
the essence of the Dao is upright, strict, and respectful.

Set resolve unshaken by the heart’s defiance of nature,
for anger and rage have no origin.
Subdue your heart and follow reason’s path,
for harmony’s breath dissolves all, and the spirit rejoices.

Set resolve unshaken by the will’s fickle changes,
for sincere intent must be steadfast in every moment.
No double thoughts in the heart, no other intentions in the mind—
guard your solitude with sincerity, and return to unity’s vow.

Set resolve unshaken by love’s entangling bonds,
for love’s fetters bind like ropes and snares.
You must uproot love’s roots utterly,
and cut off all sprouts to board the *Dharma-boat*.

Set resolve unshaken by reckless, inferior companions,
for such companions are fleeting like wind.
Withdraw from them, lest their *Dao-thought* extinguish your true heart,
and their corruption taint the sacred teaching.

Set resolve unshaken by blind guides,
for the six senses and six dusts do not anchor the mind.
Do not cling to one method to perceive true nature,
for *external Dao* and false paths cannot liberate you.

First, set resolve to receive the *initial true precepts*,
for holding the ten *precepts* keeps the heart unbroken.
Subdue your heart and guard the *disciplinary laws*—
never stray, for the four *Great Elements* demand constant reverence.

Next, set resolve to receive the *middle precepts*,
for secret practice and subtle movement lead to *self-liberation*.
When the physical body is dissolved into *Dharma-body*,
the three *bodies* are realized beyond *kalpa’s* bounds.

Set resolve to repay kindness with fervent heart,
for the four *Great Elements*’恩 is profound—you must sever it.
With body and life, repay deep kindness,
and filial sons, loyal subjects will delight heaven and earth.

Set resolve to cultivate true essence, first casting off pretense,
for you dare not feign deafness or dumbness.
With true heart and sincere intent, never deceive—
even a hint of falsehood makes you a donkey, cow, or horse.

Set resolve to sever killing, theft, and lust,
for wine, sex, wealth, and *qi* are the roots of greed, delusion, and rage."*

The six desires and seven emotions are the three poisons—
forever sever rebirth, lest the self be lost in delusion.

Set resolve not to cultivate the middle or lower paths,
for clinging to merit brings only finite reward.
The Great Vehicle’s path of serene liberation,
the supreme path—set resolve to fulfill its vow.

Set resolve to endure hardship without retreat,
to extinguish myriad faults and countless sins.
With wisdom bright and virtue vast as heaven and earth,
stand firm in the boundless Dao.

Set resolve to take refuge in precept, meditation, and wisdom,
the unobstructed path of the highest teaching.
Unobstructed, unobscured—great radiance—
unsoiled, untainted, without fear.

The path beyond birth and death, transcendent and unchanging,
neither annihilation nor increase, no opposites.
No form, no action, no rank or bearing,
no limit, no exaltation, no supreme nobility.

Rising beyond the Three Realms to the Three Purity,
ascending to the *Vimalocana* realm with *dharma-qi* and *mystic light*.
Set resolve to take refuge in the Original Beginning’s Lord,
the Dao’s scriptures, the teacher’s treasures—my heart’s mirror.

My heart’s resolve transcends dust and *kalpas*,
awakening to the unchanging body and mind.
With vow, I pledge to abandon all emptiness and deceit,
to offer body and life to the void,
my thoughts to *Suchness*—void of illusion.

I vow to learn the supreme path,
my heart unattached to all forms.
The six senses purified, the six dusts dispelled—
I reverently follow the Imperial Scripture, first severing obstacles.

I vow to dissolve emotions and cognition, awakening to the true principle,
not letting the supreme treasure turn with demons.
I vow to offer heart and life to emptiness,
not letting nature and life wander aimlessly.

I vow to transcend birth and death beyond the world,
the Dharma-realm vast and boundless, the Dharma-body great.
The Dharma-body perfect, the Dharma-realm void—
the true void, boundless and unobstructed.

I vow to liberate myself from birth and death,
to self-liberate and liberate others without distinction.
I vow to universally liberate all beings,
as myself, all sentient beings alike.

I vow my heart steadfast, my resolve complete,
to grasp the true mechanism and reverse it.
Blades and axes may wound the body—I do not flinch,
floods and fires may scorch the *dharma-qi*—my heart does not soften.

Through the three calamities, eight hardships, and five sufferings,
I vow to bear them all, never resisting.
Though my power may falter, my resolve shall not crumble—
no celestial demon can obstruct.

Even through the ninety-six *kalpas* of sun’s decline,
when the body decays and form perishes, my vow remains.
Though stone crumbles and seas dry, my heart does not fail—
my vow, the adamantine resolve of wisdom and insight.

Even if cast into the Avīci hell,
I will endure karmic retribution without retreat.
I vow to bear the causes of my own sins,
with patient endurance, my suffering complete.

I vow to awaken to the unbegun, deluded nature,
to enter the unexhausted, ever-serene stillness.
I vow to offer my liver and gall to the Three Realms,
to enter the unobstructed great mirror of light.

I vow with compassion to save all sentient beings,
to become the virtuous physician healing the world’s ailments.
I vow to pilot the boat of mercy across the sea of suffering,
to liberate all beings from the realm of illusion.

Heaven, earth, and all things—all true,
the Original Beginning’s *qi*—all divine.
The sages, immortals, and Buddhas—all sincere—
I urge all to follow the path of liberation,
together escaping the dust of mundanity.

「Assembled ones, the resolute spirit you have taken up,
the grand vows you have proclaimed—now I exhort each and all,
with every step, and every word of caution.

You, my disciples of the Dao/Way’s sublime transformation,
my children of the宗宗 *wind* and宗宗 *virtue/power*,
my young souls continuing the Dao/Way’s lineage,
my adepts breaking the celestial barriers—

Across the ten *zhou* and three *dao* islands,
all have heard, all have known.
Each must ponder deeply—
prepare swiftly, for a determined vow is your greatest gain.

*Ah!* If this body does not attain liberation in this very life,
then in what future life shall it be freed?

Time flies like an arrow, the sun and moon like a shuttle—
from your ordination till now,
you have wasted years, squandered days,
your hair like frost, your skin wrinkled with lines,
your teeth falling out, your sinews stiff and skin slackened.

*Alas!* When bones grow soft,
you cannot journey far;
when blood is drained,
your strength cannot bear weight.

When essence is exhausted and kidneys decay,
your eyes grow dim and blurred;
when spirit flags and mind goes wild,
your soul is restless and unmoored.
When vital breath fades yet the corpse remains,
your ears droop in feeble hearing;
when stomach is strong yet spleen is weak,
your appetite wanes and fails.

Assembled ones, know this body is but an illusion—
no matter how firm, death’s day is certain,
only differing in early or late arrival.

Like this: deaf ears, blind eyes, parched tongue,
falling teeth, trembling gums,
aching waist, hunched back,
snow-white hair, scorched brows—
when sinews grow rigid, limbs numb,
when resolve weakens and heart grows cold,
these are the summons from the Lord of Death,
awaiting your arrival.

Do not cling to the petty heart of a housewife,
the shallow mind of a bean-curd merchant,
the narrow vision of a dwarf,
the deluded stupor of a beast—
only fixated on the present,
heedless of the life to come.

If now the ghosts should summon you,
and you refuse to endure,
you must go—
how then can you be called a Daoist,
one who has renounced the world?
Can you escape, can you evade?

Why not look deeply, seek liberation early?

To act with decisive resolve,
to let go with a single step—
this is the mark of a true *dàzhàngfū* (great man),
a singular *qí nánzǐ* (extraordinary man).

Resolute spirit, with skillful means,
to ordain and practice the Dao/Way.
Otherwise, you are but a cowardly mind,
a flaccid visage.

The four *great elements*—wind, fire, earth, water—
each now in their own relentless course.
The lifetime’s clarity of sight and hearing—
all dispersed among the masses.

Murmuring, drifting, swaying, sinking—
into the depths of hell you go.

*Ah!* Assembled ones, without resolve in practice,
you are but puppets in a play—
when the drums and gongs cease,
where shall you go?

Only with resolve can you transcend the world;
without it, a thousandfold difficulty.

To establish resolve in cultivating the Dao/Way of true spontaneity,
whereby great *virtue/power* and spirit are not trifled—

The fourteen *yìn* (seals) verify its efficacy.
Children of the Dao, if you seek the wondrous Dao/Way of
*qīngjìng* (serene stillness) and *wúwéi* (non-action),
you must have resolve—
to be truly free.

If you can walk in freedom,
then the Dao/Way’s natural order is within you.
If you cannot walk in freedom,
how can you be free?
If you cannot even master worldly affairs,
how can you attain freedom?

The *xian* masters say:
*"To cultivate the Dao/Way of immortality,
first cultivate the Dao/Way of humanity.
If the Dao/Way of humanity is unmastered,
the Dao/Way of immortality is distant indeed."*

The Confucian schools teach:
*"First bring order to your family,
then you may govern the state."*

Ordering your family is like mastering the Dao/Way of humanity,
governing the state is like cultivating the Dao/Way of immortality.
If you cannot order your family,
how can you govern the state?

The Buddhist *shì* (teachings) declare:
*"You must exhaust the mind of the mundane,
else there is no awakening to the sacred."*

This mundane mind holds the *sāṃghī* (threefold discipline) of
*three bonds* and *five constants*—
if you follow it to completion,
the Dao/Way of humanity is fulfilled,
and the Dao/Way of immortality is no longer difficult.

Though you may not become a sage, a true Daoist, or a Buddha,
it is still easy enough.

How then should you advance in the Dao/Way of immortality?
Children of the Dao, from your entry into the *xuánmén* (mysterious gate),
studying to be Daoists,
bowing to masters and receiving their precepts—
you then sit in meditation, quieting your mind,
believing the Dao/Way of mundane humanity is exhausted,
that the Dao/Way of immortality is soon to come.

Yet you have not exhausted your heart’s reverence for your master,
nor can you distinguish the transmitted *kōujué* (oral precepts)
from their opposites—
and you dare to act without foundation.

No sooner have you begun
than you seek its verification.
After three days or two,
seeing no signs of progress,
you abandon it.

You then seek another master,
receive two phrases of instruction,
and sit again.
This fleeting impulse toward the Dao/Way
lasts no more than two or three days,
then you seek verification once more—
your very thoughts cannot be steadied.

Such is the confusion of your mind, the shallowness of your wisdom—
in vain do you practice a thin veneer of cultivation,
endlessly pondering,
your spirit unable to settle,
your efforts but a dream.

After twenty or thirty years of sitting,
you remain but a mundane mortal—
and at death, you still do not know it.

What a pity—
time wasted like water beneath a moon’s reflection,
grasping at flowers in a mirror,
thinking it easy, yet never attaining.

There are no shortcuts to the Dao/Way of immortality.

Pitiful are those who follow blind masters,
who are deceived by external *dào* (teachings).
I will not speak further.

Only I urge you:
Take the chapter of *precise discipline and conduct* as your foundation,
establish resolve in repaying kindness,
and repeatedly reflect on these matters.
First purify your thoughts,
remove the afflictions of *mùmíng* (deluded ignorance).

With a single mind toward the Dao/Way,
take refuge in the *sāṃbhoga* (Three Treasures),
recite the true *sūtra* (scriptures),
follow the *lǜ* (precepts) in practice—
sit for a hundred days in the *shí fāng táng* (ten-direction halls),
your outward demeanor dignified,
your corporeal form stable,
all affairs in order,
your body upright and composed.

Then perform the rites of respectful homage,
invite the true *shìzhēn* (authentic teacher),
and vow not to study the *zhōng xià èr shèng* (middle and lower two vehicles).
With resolute heart, you pledge:
*"I wish to hear the Dao/Way of supreme,
natural liberation—
the serene stillness of the unexcelled *dà shèng* (great vehicle),
whereby I may comprehend birth and death,
and forever escape the wheel of *lúnhuí* (reincarnation)."
Only then may you receive the *shíyìn* (ten seals) of *chūzhēn* (initial truehood).」

**Assembly, how is this so?**

The *Dao* begins with transforming *qi* and essence—
only after hearing the *Dao* may one ascend to the *pútuán* (cushion),
calm the mind and still the thoughts,
cut off speculations and forget emotions,
cultivate the mind with earnest effort,
and abandon all worldly affairs entirely.

Then, one must grasp the *Zhuǎnshòu Zhōngjí Sānbǎi Dàjiè* (the Three Hundred Great Precepts of Transmission and Reception),
deliberating them deeply,
penetrating and mastering them thoroughly,
only then understanding the profound causes and conditions:
they lie within the body,
not outside the mind.

In secret, one must penetrate the truth with sincerity,
perfect the wondrous practices,
and verify the voidness of naturalness—
even at the hundred-foot staff’s height,
there remains further progress.

One must not twist the crooked into straight,
nor forcefully argue what is unknown.
When recognizing a few *dàochǎng* (Dao/Way places),
or securing a single hermitage or monastery,
and taking in one or two disciples,
one should not already deem oneself content,
arrogant, and neglect the precepts of virtue, discipline, and wisdom.

Nor should one imitate the *lǜzhǎng* (precept masters) or *jièshī* (disciples of virtue),
maintaining solemn decorum and strict discipline,
yet refuse to harmonize with fellow adepts of the same *mén* (gate/door).

Illiterate in the scriptures,
half-understanding the principles,
the self has not yet fully transformed—
yet one boasts grandly to others,
*"We practice the supreme vehicle’s methods!"*

Seizing a fan, one scribbles a few lines of *dānyǔ* (alchemical speech).
Hanging a pouch,
one fills it with several *dānjīng* (alchemical scriptures).
Carrying a gourd,
one gathers many herbs,
stuffing them inside,
then swindles common folk of their silver,
claiming *"the Immortal’s transmitted elixir prescriptions from the Sea"*—
taking the silver,
buying wine and meat.

With reckless babble,
one speaks of *yīnyáng* (yin-yang) pulse principles,
yet fails to grasp them truly,
randomly collecting a few prescriptions,
pretending to achieve merit.

All day long,
one prattles endlessly,
discusses heaven and earth,
runs hither and thither,
seeking clothes and food.

「They corrupt the **Tàishàng** (Supreme Vehicle) teachings,
defiling the **Quánzhēn** (Complete Reality) reputation.

The lawbreakers, the transgressors of precepts,
sinners sowing seeds of guilt—
when their evil deeds fill to the brim,
the **Tiāncáo** (Celestial Tribunals) will surely hold them accountable,
casting them into endless hells,
a pitiful and agonizing fate!

And there is another sort:
those who have just entered the Dao/Way’s gate,
with petty aspirations and narrow vows,
content only with sitting in meditation to seek ease,
unwilling to humble their hearts,
subdue their **qi**,
sever attachments,
or cut off emotions—
instead, they cling to the muddy and watery,
to forms and lingering thoughts.

They fixate on the immediate effects of their practice,
manipulating **qi** to gather essence,
inducing **zhāojiào** (spiritual openings) through daze,
mistaking thieves for their own sons—
yet they never awaken.

Refusing to cultivate an open heart,
they never seek true verification,
nor observe, visit, or inquire deeply.
When they reach the stage of **huànshú** (illusory attainment),
they become irredeemable.
Many then fall into self-pity,
degenerating through endless cycles of rebirth.

They treat the **Wújí Dàodào** (Ultimate Dao of the Boundless) as mere flesh and blood,
mistaking **shízhen** (cognitive spirit) for **yuánshén** (original spirit),
and follow its illusions—
how could they ever transcend life and death?

All you disciples,
heed my words—
sweep away these **pángmén zuǒdào** (side paths),
**xiéfǎ qízhī** (heterodox methods and branches),
and cast them aside without hesitation.

Refine your body, heart, and mind
within the **Tiānmìng xìng** (Heavenly Fate nature).
Never covet swift, superficial results—
only seek **cānmén** (heart-mind realization).
With resolve, guide this mind of yours
steadfastly along the Dao/Way,
and even **tóngqiáng tiěbì** (copper walls and iron barriers)
will be shattered.

Then, naturally, there will come a day of liberation—
when the fruit ripens and the core falls,
the mind suddenly awakens,
penetrating heaven and earth.

If one’s blessings are thin and fate shallow,
they must accumulate **dé** (virtue/power)
and persevere in practice,
advancing with courage and precision.

Perhaps they fail to awaken in this lifetime,
but in the next—
or the next—
until even across **qiānshēng wànshǎi** (ten thousand lifetimes),
they cannot escape the moment of awakening.

Set this resolve:
the heart of enlightenment will never retreat,
and they will surely become great **bēihuà** (compassionate vows) scholars,
ultimately attaining the Dao/Way.

Yet **hóngfú** (profound blessings) are easy to cultivate,
while **qīngfú** (pure blessings) are hard.

If you have the resolve to walk the **outworldly Dao/Way** (out-of-this-world Dao),
this is the **zhèngdào** (true/orthodox Dao),
not the **wàidào** (external Dao) of worldly scheming,
nor the pursuit of endless life through alchemical arts—
that is but a **kànshān shǒushī** (mountain-guardian, corpse-watching) specter,
enduring for ten thousand generations.

This **Wújí Qīngjìng Zhèngdào** (Boundless Dao of Pure Stillness)
demands no hasty results,
no immediate gains—
not even in three years or nine years.
Its essence lies solely in **jiànxìng** (seeing one’s true nature).

Effects manifest daily,
changing hourly—
saliva sweetens the tongue,
hands and feet grow firm,
the head sprouts a **yuánxiàng** (round symbol),
the mind opens the **Tiānmén** (Heavenly Gate),
internal fire steams the belly,
the whole body resonates with **húnshēn gǔxiǎng** (primal **qi** vibrations),
yet these are but **zhōngxià xiūgōng** (mid-to-lower cultivation attainments).
They must be methodically refined
to return to the Dao’s essence.

For the Dao is utterly void,
its substance utterly nonexistent—
thus it is called **Boundless**.
If practice fails to return to its source,
and one mistakes fleeting gains for true attainment,
they fall into **pángmén wàidào** (side paths and external Dao),
and thus stray by a hair’s breadth
to err by ten thousand miles.

As for those who cling to names and fixed forms,
who guard their **ānshì** (alchemical cauldrons) jealously,
who establish their **lìdǐng** (furnaces) rigidly—
those who at **zǐshí** (the hour of the Rat) ascend lead,
and at **wǔshí** (the hour of the Horse) descend mercury,
who advance **yánghuǒ** (yang fire) and retreat **yīnsí** (yin symbols),
who follow the **guà** (trigrams) to perform their work,
and depend on timing for their effects—
if they fail to recognize the **fǎnhuán dàotǐ** (return to the Dao’s essence),
these are all **xiàchéng xiǎodào** (lower-grade petty Dao).

But the **Qīngjìng Wúwéi** (Pure Stillness, Non-Action) Dao
is the **miàodào** (wondrous Dao) of natural return,
which differs greatly from the above.

Take, for instance, the **imperial scriptures**—
when one sincerely takes the vow,
sets the resolve,
and pledges to transcend the mundane,
this very **initial heart** is like the **Yùnǚ Fàngxiāng** (Jade Maiden emitting fragrance).

Once the **heart-fragrance** is released,
the **six paths** of rebirth are reversed,
and all who hear this fragrance
universally attain liberation.

This **emission of fragrance** is the practice,
and this **hearing of fragrance** is the effect.

Or as when the **Yùdì** (Jade Emperor) emits light,
illuminating all **zhūtiān zhūdì** (heavenly and earthly realms),
the **Boundless world**,
all encompassed within the radiance—
like a **limitless mirror**,
mutually containing each other—
this is the effect.

Or as when **duànzài** (severing obstacles) is the practice,
the **shíqī guāng** (ten kinds of light) and **sānshí zhǒng gōngdé** (thirty kinds of virtue/power)
are the effects.

The **virtue/power** and **reward/retribution** teachings
are the effects of **dòujīng rén** (those who recite scriptures).

For example, those who were once **light-headed, frivolous, and rash**,
whose mouths never cease—
only **húyán** (empty babble),
whose hands never stop—
only **duōmáng** (endless busyness).」

「Feet never stop, only blindly wandering;
Sitting never ceases, only crooked and askew;
Sleep never rests, the body tosses and turns;
Two eyes ever wide—
glancing east, then west,
coming and going like the wind,
not the conduct of one cultivating the Dao.

Like a cow without a nose ring,
or a horse without a bridle,
not following the straight path but wandering.

Now, having taken precepts,
wearing the **changdàyī** (long robe),
fastening the sash,
carrying the alms bowl and wearing shoes,
we assume the outward form of a true practitioner.
Following others in their practices,
listening to words and observing forms,
we abandon our former crude, hasty ways
and strive to become composed and observant—
this is the practice of upholding precepts.

Transforming our **qi** and nature,
changing into the **Dao/Way’s** bearing,
so that others, upon seeing us, naturally feel reverence—
this is the outward manifestation of upholding precepts.

If one can uphold **miàoxíng** (wondrous conduct),
with focused thought and mind aligned with the Dao,
seeking only to awaken the clear mind and see true nature,
not desiring effects,
fearing only that the practice is insufficient,
not that effects will not come—
then naturally, when the great ripeness arrives,
one will awaken fully to the end.

If one’s practice is not strict,
with thoughts and minds ever shifting,
intermittently doubting and confused,
the mind not true, the spirit not responsive,
the thoughts not pure, the **qi** not gathered,
the spirit drifting, the **qi** floating,
the mind’s resolve not sharp—
how then can effects arise?

You today,
with great resolve,
wishing to escape the **lúnhuí** (wheel of rebirth),
must first expand your measure,
tighten your practice,
and postpone seeking effects—
then it will be wondrous.

For instance, a skilled physician prescribes medicine,
seeking balance within.
A mediocre physician prescribes medicine,
demanding swift effects,
ignoring the root,
only hoping to see quick results—
yet once the near-term effects appear,
the fundamental **yuánqì** (original life-energy) is ultimately harmed,
and its vitality may never fully recover.
Often, new symptoms arise,
and the patient, unaware,
regrets too late.

Great assembly,
if you daily and nightly
follow the precepts strictly,
adhere to the teachings,
constantly remind and diligently seek—
how can you fear no effects?

Yet even if some gain
an expanded chest and a clear vision,
you must still temper your aspirations and lower your mind,
seek proximity to those of **virtue/power (dé)**,
and attain supreme clarity.

Do not cling to **wòxiàng** (self-image),
forgetting **rénxiàng** (human form);
nor cling to **rénxiàng** (human form),
forgetting **wòxiàng** (self-image).

When the two minds do not arise,
the four **xiàng** (aspects/forms) are all empty—
**virtue/power (dé)** and **reward/retribution (fú)** effects will naturally follow.

Great assembly,
cultivation of the Dao depends entirely on this one mind—
the mind true, the resolve sharp, the Dao’s form close.

If one understands that **pèngxīn** (thought-mind) is empty and still,
wherever one practices will the Dao’s power respond.

The mind must be cold,
the thoughts must be gray—
cold and gray exploding into a **dòu** (boundless) grandeur.

True fire of **yì** (intention),
able to illuminate all things,
the sun in the sky radiating its splendor.

Precepts and conduct practiced with strict devotion,
within **dìng** (meditative concentration) effects verified—
**huìguāng** (wisdom-light) known.

Within, a grain of millet contains heaven and earth—
tell this to others, and they will call you foolish.

All disciples, heed this lawful speech,
for a wandering mind and floating **qi** will never become a transcendent.

Swiftly follow precepts and teachings to honor the **Tiāngōng** (Heavenly Venerable),
your mouth not boasting, your head not tilted.

this is the outward manifestation of upholding precepts

The inner and outer are of one spirit, unerring—
though the body be mortal, the Dao is complete.

Completing the Dao is neither easy nor difficult—
precepts held or abandoned rest within the heart.

Life and death, death and life arise from precepts and stillness;
once returned, do not neglect them as if they were stubborn.

Fifteen years to preserve life and prolong existence—
O disciples, I spoke to you before, urging you to awaken fiercely,
to take great vows, seeking only to illuminate life and death.
Do not diminish your resolve—
do not follow the way of the two vehicles, clinging to life and fearing death.

Now you speak of methods to preserve life and extend existence—
is this not double-tongued deception, misleading the assembly?

O disciples, the method of preserving life and prolonging existence that I speak of
is not clinging to the form, nor merely preserving vital essence,
nor extending this transient mortal span.

What I call preserving life is the *tianming*—the nature of Heaven’s decree,
the preservation of Heaven’s bestowed mandate, awaiting it in ease.

This *tianming*—the nature of Heaven’s decree—
is the *rujia*’s wisdom-life, the Daoist’s original star of fate.

This *ming*—this is the longevity of death yet not perishing.

Again, as the *Jin Gang Yun* says:
*"How to attain long life? The unbreakable body of the Golden Adamantine."*

Again, Heaven’s decree is unchanging—
cultivate the body and mind, awaiting it.

Again, exhausting principle and nature to reach *ming*—
this is the essential logic of establishing fate.

What is spoken of as prolonging is not dispelling illness to extend years,
nor achieving immortality and deathlessness.

It is the unshaken true nature, imperishable through all kalpas,
the eternal *dharma-body* that nurtures all beings,
the extraordinary form—
not the mere mortal shell.

If one cultivates the skin-bag, one may live longer,
but only dies later—
this is not the true Dao.

What I now point to in preserving life
is harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, encompassing all things.

Though Heaven and Earth shift and change,
my true nature remains undisturbed.
Though all things have their end,
my true nature knows no end.

Though Heaven and Earth and all things cycle through kalpas and cosmic eras,
my serene, true, and constant essence—
pure, luminous, and unobscured—
stands beyond all forms, unspoiled, unaltered, unchanging.

This is what is preserved in life, what is prolonged in existence—
the ever-flowing, ceaseless *tianli*, the true constant Dao.

This passage is spoken only out of necessity.
Those with clear vision, who penetrate the silent teachings of the silent seat,
will know its meaning without a word.

The Great Dao is boundless,
embracing Heaven and Earth,
leaving no place unheld, no time unpresent, no thing unincluded—
everyday actions, every moment, are the Dao.

Seeing and hearing, moving and resting,
eating and drinking, advancing and retreating,
wearing clothes, taking food,
cold and heat—
all are the Dao.

Yet you are ensnared by material *qi*, bound by habits,
unaware in your daily life.

The void within shines clearly in response,
yet before its influence, you stumble step by step in confusion.

Now, relying on the founders of the Three Teachings,
with boundless compassion for salvation and the sorrowful wish to benefit all,
I cannot help but speak at length to you.

Thus, I proclaim to all beings:
there is no other law—
if there were two laws, it would not be the true path of the Great Vehicle.

Your spark of insight—
this is another name for *huiming*—
originally one essence.

This *huiming* is but a provisional name for the Dao-body,
springing from the same source.

Though it arises differently,
it encompasses the Three Teachings while remaining one.

This *huiming* appears at every moment—
you do not see its form;
it hides at every instant—
you do not know its whereabouts;
it speaks the law daily—
you do not hear its voice.

「Are you not like the foolish ones who seek fire by the lamp and ride the ox to find the ox? My children, why do you cling to other teachings?

I fear you do not recognize this *huiming*—it is the **Soul-Treasure** (*lingbao*). Deeply knowing you, at every turn you resist it—you are not those who have seen their true nature (*jianxing*) or grasped the intent (*zhi yi*) of the Dao.

Even if you see it, you do not use it.
When you do use it, you cannot wield it fully.
When this spark of *huiming* departs,
it is as if **Yuan Shi Tian Zun** leaves his seat of law,
**Huangdi** loses his **Mysterious Pearl** (*xuanzhu*),
**Tie Lao** abandons his staff,
and **Zhang Guo** discards his **Green Donkey** (*qinglü*).
Unable to speak, yet groping at empty nostrils;
having a heart yet no aperture—
how could you be so dull and murky?
Now, with this **Sacred Heart** of the *Taoist* scriptures,
I uphold the **Great Virtue** of the **Ancestral Sage** (*qiu zu*) in cherishing life,
urging you to awaken and seek
the wondrous principle of preserving life and extending existence.

Have you not heard the *Sutra of the Supreme Dao of Mysterious and Numinous Treasures for Dispelling Calamities and Protecting Life*?

If you can truly comprehend this sutra,
you will be able to perpetuate your *huiming* endlessly—
everlasting, never ceasing.

If you merely chant the name aloud,
that is but **offering**—not true comprehension.
Those who merely offer,
chant as they may, will depart as they began—
they cannot savor its depth.

The sutra does not say:
*"You beings, from beginningless time,
your mind is enslaved by form,
your thoughts follow the shifting of objects.
Only when lost in love and infatuation,
do you tirelessly drift in the river of desire,
drown in the ocean of craving,
cling to illusory shapes and images,
and lose sight of your original nature.

The Dao is formless—yet you grasp it as form;
The Dao is not empty—yet you cling to it as emptiness.
Confused by the duality of emptiness and form,
you invert existence and nonexistence,
and ultimately cannot clarify your own self.
How could you escape the path of birth and death,
or leap beyond the cycle of transmigration?

If one knows emptiness is not empty,
knows form is not form,
does not cling to the perception of emptiness,
and transcends all doubts and defilements,
then they can purify the Six Senses,
and sever all obstacles.

This is the **core principle** of our school,
which I now proclaim to you—
the sutra is named:
*Protecting Life to Attain the Dao*,
*Universal Salvation of Beings*,
*Teaching the World*,
*Circulating for Recitation*.
Those who recite and transmit it
will be guarded by **Flying Heavenly Kings**,
**Vajra-Destroyers of Demons**,
**Numinous Treasure Children** who protect the law,
**True Persons** who rescue suffering,
and **Golden-Eyed Ferocious Beasts**—
each with ten million hosts to shield this sutra,
so that all beings may escape these defilements."*

**Assemblage!** (*Dazhong ya!*)
The **form-body** (*se shen*) could never know emptiness is not empty,
know form is not form,
discern the **formless law** (*wu kong fa*),
or **penetrate** (*dòng guān*) the **unobstructed** (*wu ài*).
How could it enter the **gates of myriad wonders**?

Thus, I first clarify the sutra’s profound truths
to safeguard your *huiming*—your vital spark.

The **Ancestral Sage’s** compassion fears
you mistake the **form-body** for your true self.
He urges you to be:
**without trace in the without** (*wu zhong wu*),
**form within form** (*se zhong se*),
**having within the having** (*you zhong you*),
**emptiness within emptiness** (*kong zhong kong*),
so that this illusory flesh does not summon or manipulate you—
so that you are not lost in its endless clamor,
bewildered by the true **school** (*zong*), and forfeit the **Soul-Treasure**.

Thus, this sutra commands you
to protect your **numinous root** (*ling gen*),
and **nurture your primal essence** (*zhuang yuan ben*).
When the root is steadfast, the Dao arises.

The **virtuous person** delights in Heaven—
thus, they preserve life.
**Longevity and vitality** (*qian shou*) are inseparable—
this is **extending existence** (*yan sheng*).

The **virtuous person** serves Heaven—
thus, their *huiming* endures.
Hence, you are everlasting and unceasing,
your transformations flow freely,
and you attain the **unbreakable Vajra-body** (*jin gang bu huai zhi ti*),
fulfilling the **imperishable Dharma-body** (*zhen chang wu lou zhi fa shen*).

**Assemblage!**
The **Three Caverns** and **Four Palaces** of scriptural records,
**five thousand three hundred** (*wu qian san bai*) **true texts**—
only those that extend existence and preserve life
can transcend the **kalpas** and rise above the dust.

Clinging to form is not preserving life—
true emptiness is extending existence.

The *huiming* essence does not depart from *huiming*—
the *huiming* light is the *huiming* lamp.
If you wish the light to shine eternally,
your *huiming* must be steadfastly preserved.

Preserved, it does not stray from **serene stillness** (*jing ding*)—
the lamp’s glow naturally attains **constant clarity** (*chang ming*).

Enlightened to the **True Suchness Lamp** (*zhen ru deng*), it shines perpetually,
illuminating the **good path** for all beings.

Its **true substance** is without light to be seen—
its **true clarity** cannot be named.
It is but the **original essence** within life,
and when *huiming* opens, the illusory speech of light and darkness arises.

In this **world of form and emptiness** (*se kong shi jian*), life and death persist—
yet **emptiness within form** (*kong se*) preserves life and extends existence.

Extending existence is transcending the kalpas—
transcending the kalpas, what death or name could there be?

All beings, only because they are lost in *huiming*,
drift through kalpas, birth after birth.

The **Lamp of *Huiming*** and its **light** shine universally—
you must swiftly awaken to the **cause of discipline** (*jie yin*).

Now, test your grasp of this wondrous method:
**stillness within emptiness**—I point to you all.

**My children!** My children!
The sutra says:
*"When it cannot be seen yet is used, life is preserved;
When it is seen yet cannot be used, existence is extended.
Only extinguish the **active mind** (*dong xin*), not the **illuminating mind** (*zhao xin*), then existence is extended.
But extinguish the **dwelling mind** (*zhu xin*), and must solidify the **empty mind** (*ning kong xin*), then life is preserved.
To extend existence is to ensure the *huiming* does not cease—
thus, the **Great Medicine** is complete.
To preserve life is to attain the **fruit of non-birth** (*wu sheng ke zheng*)—
thus, the **Great Elixir** is fulfilled.*

*"Only through the Dao does life endure—
if aligned, it is obtained;
if misaligned, it is lost."*

*"Received from Heaven, reflecting Heaven’s luminous life,
even Zhou—though ancient—renews its mandate;
its essence is ever new."*

All are the **true principles** of preservation and extension—
this is called the **Great Dao of Establishing Life** (*li ming zhi da dao*).

My children, if you comprehend thus,
you have fully attained this wonder.
Now, I will not spare even my most precious treasures,
emptying my **bag of elixirs** (*qing nang dao*), revealing the **deepest mysteries** (*zhi xie xuan ji*).

Here is a **gatha** of four lines—
ponder it carefully, all beings:
*"Life’s brevity and longevity stem from its original essence,
birth and death are but illusions from the start.
No need to seek any method for preservation and extension—
the method is **non-method** within the **Dharma-King’s City** (*wu fa fa wang cheng*).*"»

**The Azure Courtyard Platform Sutra, Lower Volume: The Sixteenth Explication of the Grand Dao** (*Bìyuàn Tán Jīng Xià Juàn Shíliù Fāntán Hóngdào*)

My disciples, though the Dao I spoke of yesterday—though its essence is *wuwei* and its body the Dharma-body—know this: the Dao-body is never separate from the constant body, and the Dharma-body dwells within the physical form itself.

The physical form, when firm, is adorned by the *meritorious deeds of the external*—the realm of *youwei*; the Dharma-body, when serene, is adorned by the *meritorious deeds of the internal*—the realm of *wuwei*. When both inner and outer are pure, and both are realized, then the spirit is liberated, the supreme unbroken true void shines forth—great radiance, perfect fulfillment, invincible, with all spirits paying homage, commanding thunder and lightning, guarding the Three Realms, and the Five Emperors welcoming it. This is not achieved through the cultivation of *youwei* merits.

Disciples, if you refine and nourish the *qi*, the *qi* will settle and the essence will condense. If you still the fire and return the wind, the essence will transform into *qi*, permeating the Four Great Elements and harmonizing with all spirits. True fire without smoke makes the *qi* clear; spirit-water without leakage makes the spirit tranquil. Clear *qi* refines the spirit; tranquil spirit merges with emptiness. When emptiness is absolute and stillness profound, the original essence returns, and the Nine Returns and Seven Regressions occur, restoring the command to its root. Returning to the root establishes the command and preserves true nature. True nature preserved, the Dao-body manifests; the Dao-body manifest, the Dharma-body appears.

Disciples, this is the Dao-body cultivated within *youwei* as *wuwei*, the Dharma-body cultivated within *wu* as *you*. The physical form has a lifespan; the Dharma-body has wisdom-life. Lifespan is granted by Heaven, not by oneself, so the physical form undergoes rebirth and death, cycling through kalpas. Wisdom-life is attained by oneself, not by Heaven, so the Dharma-body’s power is unbound, its liberation unobstructed.

Disciples, the physical form’s lifespan is limited—fate cannot be escaped. Heaven decrees death, and death must come. The Dharma-body’s wisdom-life is boundless, its powers vast, eternally realizing the unborn. Only then does true longevity arise.

Disciples, even if the physical form lingers for ten thousand years, it is but a demon—no Dao. The Dharma-body, ever present, is the sage’s true saying: *"Morning hear the Dao, evening die—sufficient."* The Dharma-body dies yet does not perish; thus it is called eternal life. The physical body dies and dies again—thus it is impermanent.

Disciples, if you realize the Dharma-body, even those with short, impermanent lives may attain longevity. If you cling to the physical form’s appearance, even those with boundless longevity may fall into rebirth.

In one word: pierce through the physical form, and all concerns dissolve. Cultivate with true sincerity, untainted by dust. Do not let the Dharma-body be bound by the physical form—only pierce the physical form to liberate the Dharma-body. Is this not the **Great Transformation**, the flourishing of the Dao’s momentum?

Now, what I expound is the **Perpetual Transformation** of filial piety and the Dao. To restore the ancestral Dao’s brilliance, who else will protect the Dharma-body if it is not made clear? As it is said: *"If the teaching is not expounded, the Dao remains obscure; if the Dao is obscure, the Dharma cannot be practiced; if the Dharma is not practiced, the Dao cannot be expounded."* The sage has said: *"It is the person who expounds the Dao, not the Dao that expounds the person."* Only if you recognize those who expound the Dao, practice the Dharma of the Dao, and speak of its profound essence—how could the Dao’s lineage decline, or the ancestral wind fade?

In my youth, I was unlearned, my studies sparse. I did not master Confucian or Buddhist teachings but stubbornly sought Daoist learning, wandering the lands for decades, intent on tracing its source. What I sought was my own innate awareness; what I questioned was my original wisdom-nature. Through prolonged inner cultivation, my innate awareness revealed itself on the Cinnabar Platform; through deep inquiry, my wisdom-nature emerged in the Void Chamber. With an inner master, how could I not welcome guests and respond to visitors? With the true lineage within, I sought to expound the teaching and uphold the Dao.

Disciples, I am unskilled in letters, ashamed before the Three Caverns’ treasures. Though I read some alchemical texts, I lacked access to the true elixir secrets. My nature being lazy, preferring leisure and stillness, I often cultivated wisdom-life, delving into the mysteries of the Immortal, abandoning all else to embrace the true essence. Where was the time to read Confucian texts or alchemical scriptures? Thus, to this day, I remain unlettered, my speech clumsy and blunt, yet I speak plainly of these supreme truths and hidden mysteries, revealing what has not yet been disclosed.

Yet the Dao is beyond words—why speak? The scriptures require no study—why open halls? The teaching is *wuwei*—why trouble oneself? This Dao belongs to all; never can it be absent for an instant. Whether in the world or the Dao, one may awaken to it, may seek it—why must one renounce the world and become a recluse, seeking teachers and friends? Only because of this matter of birth and death, unresolved in the heart, do people hunger for sustenance, roam the world, and search the ends of the earth for a way to return to the root and restore the command.

Fortunately, there are the Jade Purity, Upper Purity, and Supreme Purity, who transmitted scriptures, expounded the Dao, established teachings, and opened halls, propagating and transmitting the lineage to this day. Among them, Confucius’ disciples—Zhou Dunyi, the Two Chengs, Zhang Zai, and Zhu Xi—received the secrets of the sacred texts and elucidated the essence of the heart-method. Then there are the *Vajra Sutra*, the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment*, and the *Heart Sutra*—the true doctrines of Buddhism, the profound mysteries of stilling the body and transcending desire. What the Three Teachings share is the single path of nature and life: all are methods of compassion, delivering beings from suffering and saving life.

Now, I—though unworthy—am counted among the descendants of the Qiu lineage, following tradition to propagate the Dharma-treasures, receiving and transmitting the teaching as I have been taught.

The disciples, I am but an ordinary mortal, lacking divine powers, knowing only the plain daily practices to awaken others. I am merely one who upholds conduct and observes precepts within the Daoist path. Unlike those who sell spells for alms, idle their hands, eat without merit, and clothe themselves without virtue—how could they truly understand birth and death?

Thus, I only rouse my own spirit to fulfill the universal salvation. Above, I uphold the sacred teachings; below, I benefit all beings. It is all for the sake of others, not for myself.

Our Dragon Gate lineage began with the Qiu ancestor of the Yuan Dynasty, who revived the mysteries and illuminated the transformations. For four hundred years since then, few have been the exalted ones, and rare the devoted souls. Now, in the twilight of the Dao, I have spent thirty years in heartfelt observance of precepts, adhering to the laws and following the rules. Through seeking truth, fate favored my will—at Rongwu, I encountered my teacher; in the Nine Palaces, I received the law. Over twenty years have passed.

Heaven opened the Dao’s fortune, and I joyfully met the imperial era, encountering a flourishing age where officials and merchants take delight in goodness and benevolence. Fellow seekers of the Way had the right timing, and those inclined to cultivation found the moment. Thus, I opened halls and established precepts in the capital. Through eight seasons of teaching, the wind stirred a thousand truths. Both the refined and the common had the karmic connection, all taking refuge in precept and stillness, directly entering the wondrous Dao of purity and emptiness.

I, the humble one, rely solely on this spark of insight, sincere and silent, moved by Heaven’s grace to attain true encounters. Presumptuously ascending the law-seat, I falsely claim the title of Preceptor. As for expounding the mysteries of the Dao and universally establishing sacred grounds, that is my deepest wish.

Disciples, do not heed those who doubt and slander, clinging to their cushions, biting their teeth in silence, feigning the Dao’s form. In the end, they deceive only themselves. If such men speak of constant response and constant stillness—response to what? They cannot even preserve their own lives, how could they care for others’?

Listen well: *"The precepts and scriptures come from the Dao Canon; transmitting the law by ritual is no falsehood. Only by expounding the teaching and saving all beings can I urge the lost to cease their blasphemy. Encourage all to broaden their tolerance, endure insults, and cultivate the true form of the teaching. With wisdom and insight both refined, virtue deepens, and all beings are delivered from suffering’s ocean. Those who receive precepts first sever their obstacles—when obstacles fall, light shines bright. Why fear dimmed wisdom? Only fear the radiance of ten thousand suns. Conceal the flame to preserve life, for wisdom endures. Do not cling to prolong life in illusion’s grasp. Embrace purity, nurture simplicity, and learn non-action. Wisdom and life extend, merging into vastness. If you cling to the colored body, you know not true longevity. Refusing to save others, you seek only self-liberation—how then could the Immortals save us? Ready-made robes, effortless meals—who provides them? How can rice from the Millet Ancestor or mountains of flour be consumed? A drop of water becomes the ocean’s roar, and the hell of Avīci’s cries. Deceiving others with offerings for ease, warm clothes and full bellies bring no thirst. With clever words and hollow speech, the Dao is already lost—promising ascension to lead you away. Those outside protect the name, offering more eagerly, like fools grasping at gold from water. How many mortals can awaken on their own? Who knows the year or month of their ascension? The enlightened know no jealousy; stillness comes first, self-liberation follows. In action, the Dao is expounded to save others—ten thousand words, one awakening. One awakening leads to universal salvation; salvation’s heart is firm and steadfast. The Dao flourishes, the teaching spreads, ancestral winds rise—liberation and true emptiness unite in heart-nature."*

**Seventeen Methods of Saving Lives**

Disciples, what I expound of the teaching and the Dao is not for myself, nor for the teaching itself—only to embody the Dao, follow Heaven’s law, and save all beings. In ancient times, the sages of the Three Teachings—if they had not acted for all beings, how could they have established teachings, transmitted scriptures, opened halls, and revealed truth through every means, exhausting their compassion?

Disciples, the Confucian path has its most exalted teacher. His virtue harmonizes with the Supreme Ultimate; his Dao gathers the Great Achievement. He is neither rigid nor absolute, neither self-centered nor indifferent to others. He edited the Classics, established music, praised the *Yijing*, and upheld rites. In all things, he carried out the transformations of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*; in every direction, he elucidated the scriptures of filial piety and righteousness. The Dao was passed to Zengzi and Mengzi, bearing a heavy burden for the ages. He became the eternal teacher of scholars and the guiding sage of the people. Had it not been for Zengzi and Mengzi receiving the transmission in the Zhou Dynasty, and the Chengs and Zhu elaborating on it in the Song, how could there be the present day?

The Buddhist path originated with the Western Sage, Shakyamuni Buddha. He practiced austerities on the snow mountain, abandoned his kingdom and family, subdued his body and mind, and fulfilled his merits and practices. The Five Aggregates are empty, the Six Senses are pure. He manifested all wondrous forms, transforming himself in the ten directions. When Emperor Ming of Han dreamed of the golden man, the white horse came from the West, bringing the *Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom in Forty-Two Sections*—the Golden Prajnaparamita. The teaching spread among the Eastern people, and the title "Tathagata" was honored. The law was transmitted to the Sixth Patriarch, and the revered golden halls of the Brahmins were upheld. The Great Vehicle’s compassionate sovereign—if not for our Buddha’s transmission, how could the golden statues of the Arhat be venerated today?

The Dao is established by the Three Pure Ones, boundless and ineffable, towering and unfathomable. Its scriptures are profound and secret, passed down by sages. Manifesting in person to teach, it endures through kalpas, guiding beings from the sea of suffering and saving the world across the ages. It is the Three Officials transmitting the law, the Five Peaks opening halls. Pure Yang Lu Zu, the Master of the Three Teachings, issued the Five Thunder Orders, appearing in all directions, revealing the mysteries externally. With great compassion and great filial piety, great benevolence and great孝, he forgot fame and left behind incense and offerings. He transmitted to our Qiu ancestor, who diligently upheld the Dao and preserved benevolence, presenting the Red Book at the Phoenix Gate. He established the sect, transmitted precepts, and revived the pure laws at Dragon Gate. Through countless hardships, he vowed to save beings, earning the titles of the Venerable Long Spring True Lord and the Repeatedly Venerated Heaven-Responding Sage.

He illuminates all dharmadhatus, and all benefit from his boundless grace.

「Practicing virtue and establishing *virtue/power* (德), manifesting all manner of divine powers (神通), is solely for the sake of delivering all beings (濟度眾生) and enabling them to attain the Dao/Way (同臻大道).

All disciples, those who seek to deliver others must do so with utmost sincerity and earnestness (苦苦切切), first delivering themselves (先度自己), and then others (然後度人). Now, if the transmission of the sect (教相) does not proceed, and the *Dao/Way* (玄隐) of the Quanzhen lineage (宗門) remains obscured, it is precisely because the fundamental affliction (大病) has not been eradicated here.

Why does the Dao/Way not manifest (大道不行), and why is the sect’s tradition so meager (教門哀薄)? All disciples, it is because the core principle of Quanzhen—*"unable to deliver oneself, only to deliver others"* (不能度已，只要度人)—these eight characters bear the great root of sin (大罪根), which inherently undermines the Quanzhen sect’s authentic transmission (公案).

All disciples, you who preach the sect: if you cannot even follow its teachings yourself (自己不能依教奉行), yet insist on urging others to do so (先要勸人依教奉行), who will believe you? How can Quanzhen be said to fail in self-delivery (全真不能度已)? All disciples, hear me!

To deliver all beings (度眾生) is to deliver the beings within oneself (度自己之眾生). What are these beings within oneself? All disciples, they are the delusive thoughts and illusory fantasies (雜念妄想) that arise from one’s own original mind (自己本心中之眾生). Within the Quanzhen practitioner’s abdomen (腹內), there are eighty-four thousand illusory fantasies and delusive thoughts (妄想雜念), meaning eighty-four thousand beings (即是有八萬四千眾生).

Within a single day, across the twelve *double-hours* (二六時中), even while seated on the meditation cushion (身座蒲團), one’s mind wanders through the world (心遊世上). The moment one delusive thought is extinguished (妄心才灭), another arises (妄念又來). The seven emotions (七情) never cease, and the six desires (六欲) ensnare one; the three poisons (三毒) drag one down, and the eight consciousnesses (八識) invert one’s perception.

Like floating clouds obscuring the sun (如浮雲掩日), they drift east and west (東去西來); like raging waves driven by the wind (狂浪因風), they surge westward and dash eastward (西馳東蕩). Day and night, they never still (終朝日夜，何曾靜得一時); month after month, year after year, one fails to fix even a single thought (累月經年，未能定得一念). Not only while seated on the cushion (不但坐在蒲團), but even while walking the path (就走在道路), or in dreams (至于夢寐), how often does one cast aside delusive thoughts (那刻撇去妄心) and uphold a pure, right-minded intention (把持正念)?

If the mind does not rest (心不休), the body cannot be delivered (身不度); if thoughts are not singular (念不一), the Dao/Way remains unclear (道不明). Thus, within the Quanzhen lineage (全真門內), one must absolutely cease thoughts and rest the mind (必須要止念休心), only then can the true nature of the mind (天心) emerge (出現), and the luminous wisdom (慧光) reveal itself (發露).

All practitioners, if Quanzhen is practiced in this manner, then one may truly be called a *compatriot of the Dao* (同志). That is why it is said: first deliver oneself (先度已), then it is proper to go and deliver others (方好去度化眾人不遲).

Now, how does one deliver oneself? Through **unyielding resolve** (剛烈), **courageous vigor** (勇猛), **diligence** (精進), **renunciation** (舍除), **almsgiving** (布施), **heightened clarity** (高明), **humility** (謙遜), **liberation** (解脫), and **spontaneity** (自然).

All disciples, you must focus your will (用志不分) and concentrate your spirit (凝神), purifying your thoughts (澄虑). Those with affinity for the Dao (同志有機緣的), listen attentively to me, and I will point out these nine essential principles (一一指那九件道要).

Ah, what is **unyielding resolve** (剛烈)? The teachings of the transcendent world (出世法) and those of the mundane world (世法) are inherently opposed (本來相反), differing in right and wrong (順逆不同), and conflicting in principles (方圆不合). The practice of the transcendent teachings (出世法) requires one to first regard the illusory appearances of the world (世間的幻相) and the delusive fantasies of the physical form (色身的幻想) as false (兩般先看假了). One must sever ties with children, spouse, and kin (子女妻孥), cutting off all entanglements of affection (恩情斩断); abandon fame and wealth (功名富有), rejecting the allure of sensory pleasures (味美裘馬), and free oneself from clinging attachments (留戀葛藤). With a singular, resolute heart (一心), one must leap beyond confusion and excrement (跳出迷屙), maintaining a pure and unfluctuating will (洁志不浮). This is called **unyielding resolve** (是曰剛烈). It is also known as the **staff of subduing demons** (降魔杵) and the **platform of slaying fiends** (斩妖台).

What is **courageous vigor** (勇猛)? Hesitation and indecision (優柔不斷) allow the mind to wander (遊思或往來); when one loses hold of the method (把柄脫離), the light of clarity may be obscured (光明或開蔽). The mind should not be like autumn’s moon (心不同於秋月), ever luminous and clear (皎皎常明); the spirit should not ascend to morning mist (神不登於朝霞), radiant yet reversed (煌煌反照). Delay and laziness (迟延懈怠) make one drift with the waves and follow the currents (逐浪隨波); frivolity and indulgence (玩忽優悠) lead to perpetual vacillation (朝三暮四). One cannot achieve a sudden, sweeping clarity of the chest (胸襟一朝廓落) or an instant, unclouded brightness of vision (眼光立地澄清).

To exert effort on the mind (心上加功), one must cast aside all worldly concerns (全抛身世); in the Dao/Way, one must endure hardships (道中苦行) and crush the forces of illusion (摧卻邪魔). One must pierce through the iron walls and bronze ramparts of ignorance (鑽通鐵壁銅牆), awakening to the reality of heaven and hell (悟這是天堂地獄). All disciples, that is why after **unyielding resolve** (剛烈), one must also add **courageous vigor** (勇猛).

What is **diligence** (精進)? This **unyielding resolve** (剛烈) is the severing of bonds of enmity and kinship (割斷恩仇), cultivating the mind and establishing one’s life (修心立命). This **courageous vigor** (勇猛) is the subjugation of scattered thoughts (降伏散亂), disciplining the wandering mind (整訪遊移), and stabilizing the luminous spirit (神明鎮定).

But what is the **greater diligence** (更精進者)? This is the scholar’s pursuit of the nature of birth and death (參求生死), before this very body has manifested (此身未有之前), asking: where were you? After this body perishes (此身死殁之後), where will you go? All things in the world—heaven, earth, and the ten thousand phenomena (世間天地萬物), daily and ordinary (日用平常)—are none other than the Dao/Way (無不是道). Whatever the eyes see (眼之所見), whatever the ears hear (耳之所聞), there is not a single thing outside the Dao/Way (無一物能出道外).

Things have beginnings and endings (物有本末), which are their birth and death (即是物之生死); events have starts and finishes (事有始終), which are their birth and death (即是事之生死). If one uses the mind to investigate and reflect (用心參悟), with persevering will and meticulous pursuit (苦志精搜), one can clarify the origins and endings of things (能明物之本末), thereby understanding the birth and death of this body (則能明身之生死); one can clarify the conclusion and commencement of affairs (能明事之終始), thereby understanding the arising and cessation of the mind (則能明心之起滅了).

By examining all things and events (從事物上), subtly feeling and deeply comprehending (細細體貼，實實理會), one can penetrate the birth-and-death mechanism (生死之機) and the principle of arising and cessation (起滅之理) of even a single thing or event (自一物以至萬物，自一事以至萬事), without failing to grasp their nature. Then, the understanding of origins, birth-and-death, arising, and cessation all become a unified practice (都成一貫功夫), and only then can one approach the Dao/Way’s true nature (方能於道相近了).

Afterward, one must focus the mind on the Dao/Way (冥心大道), pursuing it with the utmost refinement (微細追求), penetrating its hidden depths (洞明幽隱), and comprehending its profound mysteries (曉會玄機). In silent recognition (默識), one must align with the true nature of the mind (天心), and in secret communion (密通) with the sect’s essence (宗旨), one can awaken this singular point of subtle *qi* (這一點虚靈) to clarity (不昧), penetrating the source of its flow (進透源流). Thus, one responds to all things without confusion (應萬物而不迷), discerns all affairs without doubt (理萬事而不惑).

If one does not diligently pursue (不肯精進), but instead grows lax and negligent (自懈自怠), then one is abandoning oneself (自暴自棄), willingly becoming a lowly specter (甘為下鬼), lacking true aspiration for cultivation (無志真修). Even if one sits cross-legged for a hundred years (纵是趺坐百年), or extends one’s life for a thousand years (延生千載), ultimately, one will still fall into the impermanence of death (終歸無常), remaining trapped in the cycle of rebirth (仍落輪迴).

What is **renunciation** (舍除)? It is the abandonment of former coarse and vulgar ways (舍去以前粗俗), and the eradication of all external, heterodox paths (除盡旁門外道). From this point onward, one must newly practice (新行), with absolute sincerity (一誠) directed toward the highest (向上). This singular point of subtle *qi* (這一點的虚靈) that does not stray from the true sect (不昧真宗) is the **primordial treasure of all beings** (元元至寶), ever-transforming and boundless (千變萬化), without fixed form (無有定體).」

「When encountering things and events, the application of each is distinct, and the response to each is unique. At every turn, perception arises like a shadow; in every moment, confusion entangles the mind. Following the subtle and wondrous *灵机* (spontaneous wisdom), layer by layer, one penetrates and delves into the profound. Yet even so, the more one moves, the more one emerges—its resources are boundless, its application ceaseless. Those who awaken attain it themselves; those who remain ignorant are far removed.

Now, I fear that if you can grasp even a fraction of this awakening, you will be able to uphold it and awaken further, never abandoning this awakening to seek another, for then you would have fallen into the *無常* (impermanence) of it. Instead, take this unchanging, constant *灵机* (spontaneous wisdom) and transform it to apply to the ever-changing, impermanent matters of the world. Then clarity of principle and manifestation of nature will shine forth; abandoning the old and embracing the new, you will pierce deeper layer by layer, ascending step by step toward the highest peak. Without reaching a state of lofty independence, how could one fathom profound wisdom, illuminate the mysteries of birth and death, and transcend the world beyond? How could one sever the doubts that bind across countless *劫* (kalpas)?

What is **布施** (dāna/generosity)? Like yesterday’s awakened insight or the former subtleties of wisdom—whatever is attained and understood must be either shared with all beings or stored within the *黍米* (sūlima, the smallest grain of rice, symbolizing the minutest essence). It must not be hoarded, nor allowed to muddle the *灵台* (spiritual platform). The past is unattainable, the future is unattainable, and even this present moment is unattainable. Within this unattainability, if one further uncovers a self-attained marvel, then perfect wisdom will be illuminated.

Generosity with wealth is called cultivating merit. Generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching) is called cultivating wisdom. Wealth can be exhausted through generosity, but my teachings—generosity with them—is boundless. Generosity with wealth can aid others in worldly matters, provide sustenance for the physical form, and adorn the outward appearance with splendor. Yet wealth can be depleted, leaving one empty-handed.

My generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching) applies both to worldly and transcendent paths. Further, generosity with the **法** can awaken the confused, elevate the latent wisdom in all beings. However, generosity with wealth is not the mundane wealth of this world. Ordinary people may nurture life, save others, relieve emergencies, assist the helpless, ward off disasters, and bring prosperity to the nation—all manner of actions that fulfill the will of heaven, control the forces of yin and yang, and span the heavens and earth with boundless, limitless wonders. This wealth is the innate talent of beings, the very essence that manifests as the **善才童子** (Guanyin’s attendant, Shantizhu, the embodiment of skillful means) in the great bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara’s retinue.

Ah! You must know: to seek the treasures of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world. This worldly wealth is not the common wealth of the world; it is the **法财** (dharma-wealth) of self-liberation, called the **神宝** (divine treasure), and thus it can invoke the treasures of heaven. This daily practice is none other than generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching). Those who attain this understanding are the foremost wise ones of countless *劫* (kalpas).

What is **高明** (lofty brilliance)? To truly cultivate generosity with wondrous teachings and liberate all beings, one must perceive the true loftiness and attain perfect, unfathomable wisdom. All things in heaven and earth possess this luminous nature. If I treat the **法** (dharma/teaching) as fixed law, then I am clinging to the **法** (dharma/teaching). Clinging to the **法** (dharma/teaching) as law is dead **法** (dharma/teaching), not living **法** (dharma/teaching)—this is a lack of lofty perception.

Thus, if I apply my own rigid methods to teach others or impose fixed principles upon the world, it becomes a lifeless, mechanical **法** (dharma/teaching). This is like driving pegs into a post or shaking oars against the wind—it is the equivalent of binding oneself to a rigid column or striking a lute out of tune. One must instead hold to the boundless, upright brilliance, guiding at every moment, acting in accordance with circumstances, and flexibly expounding. If one applies round methods to square circumstances, they cannot adapt. If one teaches the foolish with wisdom, it does not suit their nature.

One must discern the foolish and speak to them in terms they can understand, making the truth clear and accessible. Adjusting to their capacity, they may gradually awaken. If one speaks to the wise as to the foolish, it is also not in accord with circumstances. The teachings must be such that both the wise and the humble can grasp them, blending seamlessly with life’s spontaneity—so that the wise see wisdom, and the compassionate see compassion. The stagnant can flow freely; the confused can be settled. The doubtful will be resolved, the dull will become insightful, the deaf will hear, and the blind will see—then one may truly be called **高明** (lofty brilliance), worthy to lead those in generosity and liberation.

What is **谦逊** (humility)? When true cultivation reaches this stage, encountering those with clear vision—whose wisdom is vast and whose hearts are empty—all external matters, all worldly affairs, become utterly void. Above, they shake the celestial axis; below, they sway the earthly pivot. Beyond human realms, their spirit merges into boundless emptiness. They transcend the world, yet remain untouched by it.

「Where is there still a sentient being before you? From ancient times to today, the two-vehicle *arhat*s (乘), lesser-vehicle *bodhisattva*s (菩萨), and lowly *xianzi* (仙子) have all suffered from this affliction. Deeply entrenched, they remain utterly unaware. Thus, they are called the **small vehicle’s inferior roots** (劣根), the **heterodox outer teachings** (旁门外教), and **perverse Dao/magic** (邪道魔法). If so, they fail to grasp the **boundless formless** (无定体), the **unfathomable transformation** (神化不测). How could you confine or seize what transcends all limits?

Bounded things—how could they presumptuously exalt themselves? Have you not heard that the **Highest Sage** (太上) does not dare to lead the world first? It does not claim precedence in blessings, nor does it boast of its own Way, nor does it flaunt its own virtue/power. It advances by retreating as its principle, and stands high by taking lowliness as its foundation. It sets aside its own body yet the body remains; it yields its own position yet the body takes precedence. While others vie to lead, it alone retreats behind. **Lofty virtue is not virtue** (上德不德), **superior worth has no strife** (上士无争). It is unseen yet seen, not proud, not self-exalted, not self-assertive. It gives to others and thus its own virtue/power is all the more abundant; it benefits others and thus its own virtue/power is all the more plentiful.

I do not know its name—let me call it **Dao** (道). The higher one ascends to lofty brilliance, the more one practices the **humble and retiring virtue/power** (卑退之功夫). With humility and gentleness, one preserves the **thick Dao** (厚道). One way, it universally manifests **compassionate wisdom** (慈慧); another way, it safeguards and nurtures its **radiant essence** (光芒). A nation’s most potent tools should not be displayed to others—if I do not compel others to submit, they will naturally submit to me. At this stage, the **liberation’s profound principle** (解脱道理) cannot be overlooked.

What is **liberation** (解脱)? All disciples who cling to attachments do not understand **Dao/virtue** (道德). Free and unencumbered, they are not entangled by the *dharma* (法); stark and unadorned, they are not burdened by material things. Perfectly round and harmonious, they adapt teachings to the situation; radiant and luminous, they guide sentient beings across countless eons. Entering the **Gate of Marvelous Perfection** (妙门), they become the **Mother of All Sentient Beings** (众生之母). Compassion can love all things, yet it does not take loving all things as its own compassion; goodness can aid others, yet it does not take aiding others as its own goodness. The **Marvelous Law** (妙法) can liberate all sentient beings, yet it does not take liberating sentient beings as its own Marvelous Law; the **Supreme Way** (至道) can transcend the world, yet it does not take transcending the world as its own Supreme Way.

It can both emerge from suffering and endure suffering. Above, it can transcend celestial palaces, yet does not regard the **Heavenly Abode** (天宫) as a place of joy; below, it can universally rescue the **Hell Realms** (地狱), yet does not take the Hell Realms as a source of torment. When encountering suffering, it liberates others from it; when encountering joy, it shares it with all. In joy, it can point out the suffering of sentient beings; in困境 (*困中*), it can illuminate the happiness of sentient beings. In heaven, it guides **celestial beings, dragons, ghosts, and spirits** (天龙鬼神), enabling them to hear the **True Awakening** (正觉) and attain **transcendent immortality** (仙功); on earth, it liberates **culpable, suffering souls** (罪业亡魂), allowing them to behold **radiant clarity** (光明) and be reborn into the **human realm** (人界); in the human world, it guides all **virtuous men and faithful women** (善男信女) to universally practice **daily mundane conduct** (日用寻常), **non-action and rectitude** (无为正直), **loyalty, sincerity, and fairness** (忠信公平), and the **Great Dao of the Virtuous** (贤良大道). It does not teach those of the **four occupations** (士农工商) to enter the **lower vehicle’s petty methods** (下乘小法), to manipulate **vital essence and spirit** (精魂), to fall into **demonic and malevolent destinies** (着魔恶趣), or to engage in **battles with *modu* (修罗)**.

In this liberation, one must attain **spontaneous efficacy** (自然之用), which is the **Way of Freedom** (自在之道). What is **spontaneity** (自然)? All disciples, this **spontaneous marvel** (自然之妙) is the **Heart Sutra’s** (心经) **Bodhisattva of Boundless Perception** (观自在菩萨), who is **the One Who Hears the World’s Sounds** (观世音), perceiving the sounds of the world. Those who grasp this **spontaneous marvel** become **the Boundless Perception Bodhisattva within themselves** (自我自在观音)—the **Observing Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea** (南海之观音). It is the **form of the pure other shore** (彼岸清静真空之妙相), the **principle of void and spontaneity** (虚无自然之理), able to perceive the **form of true sound** (真音之妙相). Without a true teacher’s guidance, how could one awaken to the **form of true void** (真空妙相)?

Ah, disciples! **Form is void, void is form** (色即是空空是色)—if not void, not form, the Dao is not true. The **true void’s marvelous form** (真空妙相) is the **constant Dao** (真常道); if neither void nor form, the marvel is boundless. It shares **one body with my void** (虚空), and **my void has no division with it** (没分己). It enters **metals and stones** (金石) yet causes no obstruction; it enters **water and fire** (水火) yet suffers no harm.

Disciples, you must carefully ponder the **Nine Chapters of Dao’s Essentials** (九章道要), hold fast to the **Simple Core** (薄团), and awaken to all **marvelous forms** (妙相). Once you align with **spontaneity** (自然), the **three families** (三家) have already been verified—you will perfectly guide others, with boundless merit and virtue/power that even **ghosts and spirits submit to** (鬼神). Perverse *Dao* (邪魔) will be disarmed, and **demons will be dispirited** (妖精落魄). Why fear that the world will not believe and follow you?

It is the **universal liberation’s merit and practice** (普度功行), the **benevolent heart’s efficacy** (利济心), and the **diligent cultivation of one’s own liberation** (勤参度己后天人). With a sincere resolve toward the **constant Dao** (真常道), the **Boundless Perception Bodhisattva** (观音菩萨) will naturally protect your path. The **Nine Chapters’ Marvelous Precepts** (九章妙典) transcend the mundane world; the **one complete truth** (一片全真) is polished deeply. **Alms-giving’s subtle words** (布施微言) reveal the **true marvelous principle** (真妙理); **dual cultivation of nature and life** (双修性命) does not spare effort. **Insight is lofty and brilliant** (见识高明), offering many **teachings** (说法); **gentleness and humility** (仁柔卑逊) do not boast of ability. Abandoning external forms and forgetting self and others, one walks the **True Suchness of Heaven’s Great Dao** (真如天心大道). **Effortless liberation** (逍遥解脱) expounds the **supreme void’s profound Dao** (无上真空玄玄道). Even the **smallest fire** (小火) does no harm when the **three lineages** (三姓) are united—**merit is complete, practice is fulfilled**, and one ascends to the **clouds** (云霄).

The **Eighteenfold Wisdom** (十八智慧) shines brightly.

Disciples, you have received the **Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Central Extremity** (中极三百大戒), practicing **secrecy** (密行) and **subtle conduct** (微细威仪)—this is not like the **initial true precepts** (初真戒) of your former days. These **precise and profound rules** (律条) must be applied diligently in your own heart. Whenever a thought or intention arises, you must **uphold sincerity and reverence** (存诚主敬), **examine and reflect inwardly** (暗自端详), **inspect and correct yourself** (省察提撕), and **maintain central rectitude** (大中正直). Sweep away the **pensive thoughts** (念头) in your heart, making it **spotlessly pure** (清清净净). Like the **verdant sky and radiant moon**, there is not a trace of clouds or shadows; like **crystal and polished glass**, there is not a speck of blemish; like **limitless bright mirrors**, there is not a particle of dust; like **night-pearls** (夜明珠), there is not a thread of darkness. Steady and round, **radiant and resplendent** (光灿灿), one may then **deliver the Dao** (讲道). **Wisdom and radiance** (智慧光明), **true void’s marvelous form** (真空妙相), all arise from **precepts and concentration** (戒定).

Through **enduring humiliation and severing obstacles**, with **precepts strict and refined**, through **self-discipline and rigorous cultivation**, aided by **dharma-pharmaceuticals**, one may attain this state. Yet if one **holds precepts loosely**, few can truly uphold them—**practicing secretly yet deceptively**, never truly ceasing even a fraction.

Why? **O foolish disciples**, if one’s **conduct is not secret**, it is called the **cause of defilement**—how then could one **realize the fruit of non-doing**?

These four words—**wisdom and radiance**—are the **highest rank of sharp faculties**. Thus, the **lowest rank of dull faculties** cannot penetrate them. Only by **unwavering resolve**, **concentrating qi at the acupoints**, **nurturing ancestral qi**, **nourishing primordial nature**, reaching **ultimate emptiness**, **steadfastly abiding in stillness**, **remaining pure and undivided**, **hiding the spirit in the boundless**, and **returning to the Great Polarity**, will **wisdom and radiance naturally arise**, as **one yang revives**—only then does one **see the original face**.

To **know the nature of spirits and gods**, to **grasp the mechanisms of transformation**—this is **wisdom**; to **participate in heaven and earth’s nurturing**, to **align with the sun and moon’s succession**, to **harmonize with the four seasons’ cycles**—this is **wisdom**; to **universally manifest the dharma-body**, to **subdue the dharma-realm within awareness**, never straying from **enlightenment’s illumination**, all returning to **the radiant void**—this is **radiance**; to **penetrate all things in formlessness**, to **foresee all matters before their signs**, to **pervade the void without trace**, to **transcend sun and moon without shadow**—this is **clarity**.

If one’s **precepts are not precise**, one cannot attain **serene composure**. Without **serene composure**, **wisdom does not arise**. Without **wisdom**, **radiance does not manifest**.

The *Jade Pivot Treasure Scripture* in one scroll **directly points to human nature**, **unveiling innate truth**, **laying bare celestial mechanisms**, enabling beings to **turn the scripture and awaken to the Way**. Yet alas, the **bewildered outnumber the enlightened**. They **recite with their mouths but cannot uphold with their hearts**; their **hearts may be sincere, yet their strength cannot transform**.

What a pity—**they squander the sage’s intent**, **wasting the sacred treasure**. Now I must **interpret the scripture’s marvels**, **point to the true mechanism**, so that you may **suddenly awaken**.

All of you, **revere and listen with earnest intent**. The scripture says:

*"In the past, fifteen thousand kalpas ago, my heart encountered this Dao, and I attained the rank of Highest Truth. My intention cultivated this merit, and I thus governed the Great Transformation."*

Again it says:
*"With a serene mind, I vowed a boundless aspiration; with wisdom’s power, I subdued all demons."*

Again it says:
*"You heavenly and human beings who wish to hear the supreme Dao—
The supreme Dao is profound and distant, not found elsewhere.
If you truly wish to hear it, **‘without interruption’ is the key.
Without interruption, without perception—this is the true Dao.
Even perception fades; only you remain.
You are not yet ‘having’—how much less the Dao?
To hear without hearing—what Dao is there to discuss?"*

Again it says:
*"The Dao is entered with **sincerity**, guarded with **silence**, and applied with **gentleness**.
To use sincerity seems foolish,
To use silence seems inarticulate,
To use gentleness seems clumsy.
Thus, one may **forget form**, **forget self**, **forget forgetting**.
Those who enter the Dao **know when to stop**,
Those who guard the Dao **know caution**,
Those who apply the Dao **know subtlety**.
To know subtlety, wisdom’s radiance arises;
To know caution, sacred wisdom is complete;
To know when to stop, serene composure is secure.
Serene composure ensures sacred wisdom’s completeness,
Sacred wisdom’s completeness brings wisdom’s radiance,
Wisdom’s radiance unites with the Dao—
This is called **true forgetting**.
Forgetting yet not forgetting,
Nothing left to forget—
That which cannot be forgotten **is the supreme Dao**.
The Dao is in heaven and earth,
Yet heaven and earth do not know it;
Sentient and insentient alike—
It is **one and undivided**."*

Again it says:
*"Those who attain awakening **ascend to the celestial hall**."*

Again it says:
*"The foolish may become wise,
The turbid may become clear—
All by decree.
Foolishness is dim and murky,
Turbidity is dark and obscure—
Yet these are shaped by **inherited wind and soil**.
Heaven’s divine mechanisms
Make people unaware—
Thus it is called **natural**.
If one knows one’s unawareness,
It is also called **natural**.
The marvel of **naturalness**,
Though wondrous in knowing,
Its wonder lies in **unknowing**.
Yet in the Dao,
There was never **foolishness or turbidity**."*

Again it says:
*"All that I have proclaimed—
The worthy who receive the scripture
Must **dig for gold and place coins**,
**Swear to heaven** in its transmission."*

The disciples, this is the **true esoteric secret** of the *Jūshū Jīng*—the supreme, unfathomable treasure of serene liberation, the highest and most subtle of all. You merely recite the scriptures day and night, yet have never truly grasped their profound essence. If, while reciting and upholding them, you awaken to their hidden keys, then **sacred wisdom will be complete and luminous insight will arise**.

The **Ultimate Way** is profound and ineffable—neither visible nor audible. Had it not been for the **Celestial Worthy’s** opening of the serene mind and awakening of boundless aspiration **fifteen hundred kalpas** ago, seeking to deliver all beings and lead them to the peak of perfection—then declaring that the **source is emptiness**, with neither sound to hear nor form to see—if there is no sound to hear, then **forget the ears**; if there is no form to perceive, then **forget the eyes**. When ears and eyes are forgotten, then hearing and seeing will also vanish. Thus, ears and eyes, having form and color, are the leaders of the **six senses**; hearing and seeing, clinging to appearances and thoughts, are truly the **roots of the six senses**. How could they align with the **Dao**?

If one can purify the **six aspects** and sweep away the **six cognitions**, then the ears that do not listen **listen with the mind**, and the eyes that do not see **see with the spirit**. Thus, one does not listen yet hears, does not see yet sees. Without hearing or seeing, one is in accord with the **Dao**.

The *Chìwén Dònggǔ Jīng* says:
*"To forget the eyes, light overflows without limit;
To forget the ears, the mind’s depths remain ever still.
Both mechanisms forgotten, one enters the gate of all marvels.
Seeing without seeing me, hearing without hearing—
Detached from all boundaries, this is called the **Mystic Way**."*

The *Nánhuá Jīng* says:
*"Qi halts at the ears, the heart halts at the talisman."*

Thus, the *Jūshū Jīng* says:
*"To forget form and self is the mechanism of entering the **Dao**.
Again, with sincerity one enters—this ‘sincerity’ is **precept**.
With silence one guards—this ‘silence’ is **observing precepts to subdue body and mind**.
To use silence as if speechless is to enter **samādhi**, forgetting ears and eyes.
To act with gentleness as if clumsy is to conceal wisdom within the profound.
Again it says:
‘You seek within your own colored form to hear or see—
Yet it will never be visible or audible.’*

The *Vajra Sūtra* says:
*"If one seeks me through form or sound,
That person walks the crooked path and cannot see the Tathāgata."*

Now, those who seek the **Dao** must **receive precepts and enter samādhi**, secretly cultivating wisdom, confusing clarity with obscurity, yet not hearing while hearing, not seeing while seeing. Thus, those entering the **Dao** know **restraint**—this is the practice of **observing precepts and stilling thoughts**; know **caution**—this is the practice of **solitary vigilance and diligence**; know **subtlety**—this is the practice of **abandoning the sage and discarding wisdom**.

To still thoughts, one must **observe precepts**; to practice solitary vigilance, one must **enter samādhi**; to know subtlety, one must **cultivate wisdom**. If one truly **observes precepts, enters samādhi, and cultivates wisdom**, then body and mind will be perfectly tranquil, sacred wisdom complete, and luminous insight universally radiant. When the luminous insight penetrates, one merges with the **Dao**—this is called **true forgetting**. This **true forgetting** is not the **true forgetting** of sitting idle in empty meditation, but **true emptiness**. Within this **true emptiness**, there exists a **purple-golden wondrous form**—the marvel of **emptiness within non-emptiness**. If one does not fall into **coarse emptiness**, yet remains within **non-emptiness**, then the **subtle essence** naturally manifests. It is only because of **forgetting without forgetting what is forgotten** that one attains the **supreme and wondrous Way**.

Again it says:
*"Fools and sages differ—thus clarity and turbidity vary.
Though shaped by unequal **inherited wind and soil**,
All are mechanisms of **creation’s workings**,
Divine motion unfolding naturally,
The logic of **qi and fate**—already decreed by destiny.
Yet fools make themselves foolish, sages make themselves wise—
How could Heaven reward or punish their wisdom or folly?
Only by awakening a **serene mind** and establishing a **boundless aspiration**—
To depart the world and deliver others,
One must first hear the **Dao** and deliver oneself.
Those who deliver themselves **take refuge in the Three Jewels**,
Receive precepts, enter samādhi,
Cultivate wisdom to emit radiance—
Then fools may become wise, and the turbid may become clear.
If one cannot **observe precepts, enter samādhi**, or penetrate wisdom,
Without radiance to illuminate,
Then clarity may become turbid, and wisdom may become folly."*

The *Vajra Sūtra* says:
*"My teachings have no fixed form—
This is what is meant."*

The wisdom-light spoken of—**resplendent, vast, and profound**—illuminates the **dharma-realm**. How could it ever transcend the *Jūshū Bǎo Jīng*? **Jūshū** is the **true mechanism**. Those who wish to **turn the scripture** must first **turn the true mechanism**, secretly cultivating **merit and wisdom**. Yet I fear the **hidden light** cannot be opened or seen.

How could one **discern the forms of ghosts and spirits**, grasp the **pivot of creation**, participate in **Heaven and Earth’s transformation**, govern the **movement of sun and moon**, contain the **dharma-realm within a grain of millet**, and settle all things **before their origin**—to be called **Master of the Mystic Way**, advancing to the **Celestial Immortal’s realm**?

It is said:
*"Seeing the hidden light, one hears the **Dao’s root**.
Without cultivating **precepts and samādhi**, how could wisdom’s light be profound?
Clinging to appearances is not the true form—
Only by forgetting hearing can one truly hear.
Hearing, thinking, and cultivating enter the marvel—
The boundless ocean’s sound, free and at ease."*

**The Nineteen Marvels of Divine Powers**

Disciples, the wisdom-light of the **Dao** spoken of above—**the *Jūshū Jīng*** merely says that **hearing and seeing are extinguished**. Without hearing or seeing, the **marvels are already exhausted**, and **divine powers manifest**.

The *Yīnfú Jīng* says:
*"The deaf see, the blind hear."*

Ancient immortals say:
*"In stillness, no thunder is heard;
In deep gaze, no Mount Tài is seen."*

The *Zhōngyōng* says:
*"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—
How magnificent it is!
To see them, yet not see;
To hear them, yet not hear."*

*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"See nothing, hear nothing—
Embrace the Spirit and remain still."*

*The Parameters of the Mysterious* states:
*"The three treasures of ear, mouth, and eye—
Seal them shut, let nothing pass through.
The True Person dwells in the deep abyss,
Floating and guarding within the rule’s embrace."*

All the profound words in the scriptures cannot be exhausted.
The Great Compassionate One, Guanyin, through hearing, thinking, and cultivation,
Enters samādhi.

Now, the ear is the orifice for **leaking essence**—
Not the leakage of post-heaven’s superficial desires,
But the **pre-heavenal Ta Yi’s true qi**, the **manifested essence of the original vitality**.
If one internally listens and seals the hearing,
Then essence does not scatter, and wisdom arises.

The eye is the orifice for **leaking spirit**—
Not the leakage of post-heaven’s deliberative spirit,
But the **pre-heavenal subtle form of luminous awareness**, the **original spirit of the Great Primordial’s misty haze**.
If one internally gazes and returns the clarity,
Then it does not wander externally, and insight is born.

To uphold precepts and enter concentration—
Then wisdom arises.
Wisdom arises, and water and fire unite.
Water and fire unite, and **Kan and Li** are paired.
**Kan and Li** paired, and **Heaven and Earth** are harmonious.
**Heaven and Earth** harmonious, and **Metal and Wood** merge.
**Metal and Wood** merge, and **hun and po** reunite.
**Hun and po** reunite, and **essence and qi** transform.
**Essence and qi** transform, and **divine powers manifest**.
Divine powers manifest, and **light radiates**.
Light radiates, and **merit is complete**.
Merit complete, and the **Dharma-body is formed**.
The **Dharma-body formed**, and the **Dao-body is revealed**.
The **Dao-body revealed**, and **marvelous functions operate**.
Marvelous functions operate, and **sentient beings are liberated**.
Sentient beings liberated, and **vows are fulfilled**.
Vows fulfilled, and the **great matter is accomplished**.
The **great matter accomplished**, and **rank and fruit are attained**.

Only this **One Vehicle** is true—
The other two are not genuine.
From beginning to end, it does not depart from **sincerity**.
*The Zhongyong* says:
*"Without sincerity, there is nothing."*

**Things**—
Vague and indistinct, yet within them, there is substance;
Dark and obscure, yet within them, there is essence.
Their essence is most true, and within it, there is **faith**.
**Faith** is **sincerity**—
This is what the *Yijing* speaks of as **"qi and essence forming things"**, the **"material" of the *Great Learning***.
**Essence** is the **"one essence"** of the *Shangshu*.
**Middle** is the **"middle"** of **"its own middle"**.

*The Lotus Sutra* says:
*"There is a treasure hidden within the mountain of form,
Which the sages use to purify the heart and retreat into secrecy.
All are none other than this very thing—
First retreat, then reveal."*

An ancient song says:
*"If this heart holds nothing at all,
Before your eyes lies the moment of submission."*

What need for divine powers and marvelous functions?
What need for wisdom and light?
These divine powers and marvelous functions
Are the True Persons of the **Dao’s precepts** manifesting themselves
To liberate sentient beings, guiding delusion back to truth.

Thus, within the radiance of great wisdom,
The arm of compassion extends—
Rescuing all beings,
Freeing them from suffering into tranquility.
It grants longevity to those with short lives,
Transforming calamity into ease.
It brings peace to lands, extending life and preserving vitality.
It purifies sentient beings, making them virtuous and upright,
Banishing demons, driving away the strong and rebellious,
Exterminating malevolent spirits.
It makes sentient beings merciful and non-killing,
Causing them to preserve the **eon’s fate** and resolve grievances.
It shatters their darkness, revealing light.
It heals all diseases, dispelling ancient ailments.
It turns the foolish into the wise, leading them to the true and away from evil.
It makes them desireless and pure-hearted, gathering emotions back to nature.
It grants unobstructed liberation, transcending the mundane to become sage.
It accumulates merit and dispels calamity, bringing auspiciousness and eliminating sin.
It achieves transcendence and attains the **Dao**, escaping suffering to become immortal.
It enables cultivation of the **Highest Vehicle**, ascending to heaven,
Leading all sentient beings, wandering the eight extremes,
Surpassing celestial palaces.

May all sentient beings, in their ordinary forms,
Become **Dharma-kings**—
Even beyond measure, called **divine powers**.
Not revealing the secret in this age, called **marvelous functions**.

Thus, the divine powers of the **precepts, concentration, and wisdom** gate
Are the **non-divine divine**—
Transforming the six senses into the six **liberations**,
Communicating with heaven and earth,
With gods and ghosts,
With humans and things—
This is called **divine power**.

This **marvelous yet functional marvel**,
With one mechanism, demonstrates ten thousand transformations.
Transforming **heavenly demons**, **earthly coalas**, **ten thousand ghosts**, **evil beings**, **monsters**—
This is called **marvelous function**.

In the **precepts and concentration** gate, one enters stillness,
And light arises from **concentration and wisdom**—
The **pre-heavenal qi’s round and luminous auspicious form**.
Above, it communicates with the **Celestial Palace**, paying homage to the **Three Pure Ones**.
Below, it communicates with the **Underworld**, pardoning guilty spirits in the **Nine Abysses**.

When teaching, celestial deities submit,
The Five Emperors attend in solemnity,
Ten thousand spirits guard in orderly ranks,
Eager to hear the true **Dharma** and refine their spirits back to emptiness.
Having attained liberation, with compassion and pity,
They rescue the suffering, cold, and lost,
And the **Pure Assembly** praises, **Dìzhàng** shines forth,
Ghost judges obey, and the **Netherworld officials** submit,
Pardoning sins and granting rebirth,
Hearing the true **Dharma**, escaping the **Ghost Register**,
All ascending to **Extreme Bliss**.

Thus, self-liberation and liberation of others,
Taking great vows—
Wishing all sentient beings to universally hear the **Highest Way**,
Using the **Dharma-medicine** to universally save all beings,
Even the dull and moving with life,
All attain liberation.
Earth and wood, tiles and rubble—
All respond and communicate.
All things’ emotions are thoroughly penetrated.

Divine powers operate in **unaware unawareness**,
And heaven and earth, ten thousand things, are within my body.
Marvelous functions manifest in **natural spontaneity**,
And mountains, rivers, stars, and constellations return to the **Law**.

Heavenly demons all respectfully submit,
Bowing their heads in reverence.
Earthly coalas are all transformed into benevolence,
Their reverent hearts subdued.
Ferocious and cruel ghosts, upon hearing, ascend and forever abandon blood offerings.
Asuras and heterodox sects submit to the **Law** and return to correctness.

「War forever ceases, grievances are fully resolved, and grudges dissolve.
With **virtue/power** to transform, not with force to subdue,
Then wicked beings all become virtuous folk;
With **sincerity** to move, not with **craft** to ensnare,
Then errant souls all return to righteousness.

Inverting the **Fighting Star** to govern **yin-yang**,
Yet gods and spirits cannot fathom its marvel;
Upside-down wielding the **transformation-mechanism** beyond the world,
And heaven and earth remain unaware.

Universal manifestation of divine luminosity,
Firmly established in the **Law-body**,
Yet no form can be perceived.
Broadly proclaiming the supreme **vehicle** of one wondrous **Law**,
Yet no sound can be heard.

The **void** is my **Law-realm**,
I am the **Law-body** of the **void**.
Mingling indistinctly, I am one with heaven;
Upright and vast, I am one in heart with **Daoist immortals** and **Buddhas**.

Zhengzi said:
*"Expanding, it fills the six directions;
Contracting, it retreats and hides in secrecy."*
This is what he meant.

So-called parent of all beings,
**Daoist** master of the **Law**—
Is it not the **divine powers** of tranquil liberation,
The **wondrous functions** of **non-action** and natural spontaneity?

All children,
If you do not cling to forms,
Then your **wisdom** will be vast and boundless;
If you follow **heaven’s** natural course,
Then your **wondrous functions** will be infinite.

It is simply about
Diligently seeking the **Dao** in daily life without slacking,
And in haste without abandoning—
The two characters **"virtue/power"** and **"Way"** alone.

Why then forsake **precepts** and **disciplinary laws** to study **talismans** and **ritual arts**,
Or abandon **jade** and **precious gems** to cling to **coarse incantations**?
Would you rather be the foolish multitude,
Not learning the **supreme vehicle** of the **Way**?

Alas! All children entering the **mystic gate**,
Should seek the **supreme vehicle**.
Each person contains a **wondrous secret**,
Every individual is inherently luminous.

When **mindful attachments** arise, they bring many obstacles;
When **precepts** are held lightly, they become mere hollow words.
Even if **meditative focus** is strong,
If **resolve** is weak and **precepts** are not deeply held,
Then **divine powers** and **wondrous functions** remain elusive.

To attain **divine powers** and **wondrous functions**,
All children must rely on **sincere progress**.
If you foolishly cling to forms in pursuit,
Then a life in **ghostly caverns** will never lead to true **Way**.

Heterodox sects and external **Dao** schools often dwell in shapes,
Clinging to **emptiness** while dwelling in **color**—
This is not true cultivation.

Neither clinging to **emptiness** nor to **color**,
When **meditative focus** is deep and **sincere response** is thorough,
Then **divine powers** manifest naturally.

When **wondrous functions** are wielded,
The **divine luminosity** distinguishes itself—
Yet how many **Daoists** lose the **central function**!

I am not speaking at length for no reason—
Ah! I am revealing **heaven’s** true mechanism.

**Divine powers** manifest, **wondrous functions** shine forth,
The **Law-king** of boundless **Dao**—
Not departing from the **true constant** of tranquil stillness,
The **heretical teachings** submit in heart, and evil transforms into good.

Those who defy filial piety and fraternal duty,
Upon awakening, become instantly **benevolent and gentle**.
**Wisdom** is like a mirror,
**Illumination** like a **divine spirit**,
A single **luminous platform** blazing brightly.

The **Six Perfections** interweave without trace of dust,
And the earth, mountains, and rivers all become **gold**.

All children, do not neglect the **precepts** lightly held,
For they are the **heavenly ladder** by which you ascend step by step.

**Divine powers** are unfathomable,
**Wondrous functions** immeasurable—
Yet they never depart from **precepts** and **meditative focus**,
The **true constant** of **wondrous functions**.

The **gate** of **Thusness** has a **passage to heaven**,
Within the **non-dual fast**, **sacred fragrance** is exhaled.

All children, if you cultivate **sincerely** without self-abandonment,
Then the **ancient Daoist** and **Buddhist** **Great Assembly Hall** is yours.

Twenty years of enlightenment into **birth-and-death**—
All children, from ancient times to now,
The **sages**, **immortals**, **Buddhas**, and **patriarchs**,
Only for the sake of great **causes and conditions**,
Nine years facing the wall,
Seeking urgently to penetrate **birth-and-death**,
To subdue the **heart of worldly existence**.

Have you not heard?
**Stone-fire**, **lightning-flash**, **falling flowers**, **fleeting water**—
When **impermanence** arrives,
Not even a moment can be retained.
**Karma** follows the body,
And **rebirth** brings retribution.

Words not yet finished, yet the breath in the throat is severed,
Speech not yet uttered, yet the tongue shrinks and cannot sound.
Naked and stripped, where shall you rest your body?
Dark and boundless, who shall stand firm in your fate?

Great **blessings** lead to rebirth in the world,
Evil **deeds** plunge you into **Fengdu**’s depths.
When **blessings** are exhausted, you return to **rebirth**,
And when **karma** is complete, you transform into **beasts**.

For **aeons** you are ensnared by **grudges**,
Unable to escape;
For **thousands of lives**, **guilt** cannot be erased.

World after world, you sink in **delusion**,
Drunken in **life**, dead in **dreams**.
**Grudges** beget **grudges**,
And you wear **horns** and **fur** as retribution.

To speak of it is painful and pitiful,
To recount it is sorrowful and terrifying.

If you do not **fix your resolve** and **establish your intention**,
Grasping firmly your **innate moral nature**—
Uncovering the earth, overturning the heavens,
Awakening to how **death** truly unfolds;
Surrendering your **heart**, relinquishing your **life**,
Piercing the **ignorance** of your **past lives**—

If you encounter a **resolute warrior**,
Who raises his brows straight,
And wields the **treasured sword** to cut **demons**—
Truly a **great man**,
Who releases his **great qi**,
And severs **heresy** with a **sharp blade** in his heart.

Ultimately, you must see through:
Before your **parents** gave birth to you,
Where did you establish your **command**?
And after **death** claims you,
Where shall you rest your **body**?

Awakening to the **Three Bodies**—
Past, future, and present—
Pursuing exhaustively the **Three Worlds**,
As if they were yesterday;
The **coming morning** is this very dawn.

Thus, all **thoughts** are dispelled,
Only this **luminous light** remains.
All **conditions** are swept clean,
Only that **illuminated nature** endures.

Entering the **mystic gate**,
One **passage** opens, and all **passages** open;
Seeing the **true teaching**,
Then the **Three Realms** are clear, and the **Three Worlds** depart.

Liberation means the **Five Elements** do not cling,
And **void** stillness means the **Four Great Elements** return to **emptiness**.

Entering the **gate of myriad wonders**,
Ascending to the **ground of the Three Jewels**,
Coming and going freely,
Transformation without bounds—

Lightly turning **heaven’s** mechanism,
Then **ghosts** and **spirits** cannot measure its **marvel**.
Majestically reversing the **Fighting Star**,
Then **yin-yang** cannot control its **authority**.

Soaring in the **Vimalakirti’s** **subtle essence**,
Attaining the **position** of **void** and **boundless** stillness—
Forever departing from **dusty kalpas**,
Escaping the **cage of existence**.

The **Great Matter** of **Perfect Truth** is accomplished,
Layer by layer, the **great path** is traversed,
Without practicing **discrimination** yet arriving swiftly.

This **wondrous Law-body** of **Dao**,
All its **secrets** are obtained from **illumination**—
Step by step, **hidden techniques** are perfected,
How could one not awaken and achieve **harmony**?

All children!
The **Way** lies in **sacred transmission**,
Cultivation lies in **yourself**—」

The **virtue/power** comes from human accumulation,
The mirror comes from **Heaven**.

Further, one does not hear of **Heaven** dividing its **creative transformation** within the One,
Nor of humans establishing **dharma** and **precepts** from the heart.

Each person must strive swiftly to uphold and practice,
Urging themselves to press forward without delay.

Those yet **unawakened** shall not lose the **auspicious cause**,
Those who **pierce through** shall return to the **Celestial Realm**,
While the **unawakened** shall not fall into the **hells**.
All children!

Even if you knock with a **golden brick** at the gate,
The gate shall not open,
Yet the **golden brick** remains.

To uphold **precepts** and cultivate the **Dao** though still **unawakened**,
If the **precepts** persist,
You shall not sink into the **Netherworld**,
Ultimately reborn in the **yang** world.

If the **past causes** are not obscured,
The **fruit of realization** shall naturally manifest—
Just a slight turn,
And you still hold the **handle** in hand.

All children!
Do not seek **birth-and-death** outside yourself.
When **birth-and-death** is realized,
Only then do you know the **true essence** within the heart.

I have spoken at length now,
Yet it amounts to no **method**.
If you **embody** the heart in this way,
You shall yourself find that **principle**.

**Death** is examined in **life**,
**Life** is realized in **death**—
This **mechanism** of **life-and-death**,
The **pathway** lies in human **transformation**,
By your will, not mine.

To seek **stillness** within **movement**,
To find **movement** within **stillness**,
Then the **essence** of **movement-and-stillness**,
All depends on the **true knowing** within.

You may question the **heart**,
But you cannot question the **Teacher**.
Heed my words carefully,
And you shall never go astray.
If you do not follow my words,
You shall inevitably lag behind.

The dim lamp of my path
Guides countless lost travelers through the dark.

This raft of suffering
Ferries guests across the endless ocean of the Ganges.

Disciples, do not harbor doubt—
When you recognize the truth, walk swiftly by night.

Then, in the silent hall, voices rise in praise:
*"Where was home before birth?*
*Where shall we return after death?*
*Now, awaken to the Dharma-body,*
*Lest you pass your prime with empty hands.*

*Life and death intertwine—*
*This great matter of cause and effect is no trifle.*
*Before death, first embody its likeness,*
*For the breath of life lies hidden in death.*

*Not in water, not in mountain,*
*Why seek west or east or south or north?*
*Look not beyond your own body—*
*Truth dwells within this narrow span.*

*With precept, concentration, and wisdom,*
*Enter the Mystic Pass,*
*Lest your practice falter in the second or third step.*
*With single mind, comprehend life and death,*
*And iron walls and bronze fortresses shall crumble with ease.*

*True suffering—oh, how arduous!*
*Yet like a boat gliding over shallow waters.*
*Suddenly, the tide turns fair,*
*The wind aligns—*
*In an instant, you sail past the Nine Dragon Bay.*

*When you recognize the truth,*
*Walk by night without hesitation,*
*And all props dissolve into none.*

*Empty, boundless, solitary in practice,*
*Neither thirst nor hunger—*
*Eternal as heaven and earth.*

*The twenty-one virtues perfected,*
*Disciples!*

The boundless void—here lies the ladder to heaven within the gates of precept and concentration.
The boundless sea of suffering—here lies the vessel to cross within the radiance of wisdom.

If you do not stride forward with open steps,
The ninety-thousand *li* of the path shall never be reached.
If you do not straighten your spine and press on,
The true Dharma shall not be heard across a thousand kalpas.

Should your steps falter and your resolve weaken,
How shall your virtue be perfected, your power fulfilled?

Disciples, let no thread of thought leak from your mind—
Let your primordial *qi* naturally fill, harmonize, and suffuse.

To subdue spirits and gods through virtue,
Only then may you escape the retribution of rebirth.
To align with the Dao of heaven and earth,
Only then may you transcend the path of life and death.

Ascend to the Dao’s shore—
Turn and you stand in your homeland.
Plunge into the Mystic Depths—
Blink, and you return to your original form.

Disciples!
Who harbors immortality?
Who beholds eternal life?
The undying is not this mortal frame;
The ever-living is not mere form and substance.

Where is Pengzu now?
Where does Yanzi endure across kalpas?
The undying is my Dharma-body;
The ever-living is my primordial *qi*.

Even the Tathagata has a time of quiescence,
Deep in the realm of *nirvana*;
Even Laozi had his day of ascension,
Soaring to the Great Red Sky.

The Dao abides—so does the person.
The Law abides—so does the self.
To die without forgetting is longevity—
A nameless name unbroken across countless kalpas.
To live without possession is form—
A formless form unharmed through ages.

Countless as the sands of the Ganges,
No sage escapes this Mystic Pass.
Numberless as the void,
No immortal or Buddha bypasses this Great Way.

The clear path of heaven is plain—
Yet how can it save those lost in doubt?
The serene Buddha-land is pure—
Yet how can it free the common folk from their shackles?

Only those with shallow fortune and deep sin,
Though they see, are blind as the sightless.
Many bear heavy karmic burdens,
Though alive, are already dead.

Flesh moves, corpse walks—
No better than beasts, save for speech and wit.
Day sleeps, night dreams—
Worse than plants, lacking even upright growth.

When your time is due, ghosts shall drag you—
No mercy for the "Perfect Truth" adept.
Not a word amiss in judgment—
You are still deemed a wicked, virtue-less man.

Disciples,
All must die—yet let it be well.
Pure, clean, unencumbered,
Coming and going with ease, without restraint.

All must disperse—yet let it be wondrous.
Clear, unbound, effortless,
Transformation complete yet unfathomable.

Before departing, bow to all.
The hour has come—release your grip and go.

Bare as a newborn, radiant *qi* blazes from the crown—
A thousand auspicious lights.
Round and luminous, ascending in marvelous form—
Halfway to heaven, white cranes soar on clouds.

Many celestial scenes—
The spirit returns to the void.
One auspicious glow—
The true bones rest in the cavern.

The great man’s deeds are complete!
Leave behind a name among mortals,
Pass down a teaching to the world,
So that in countless ages,
Some may know of you.

This is to die yet not perish—*shou*.
To propagate the Dao across eons—
This is the body of perfect fulfillment,
Perfect virtue, perfect fortune.

Disciples,
Life and death rest with you alone—
No one can save you.
If you do not cultivate yourself,
No one can do it for you.
Thoughts arise and vanish—
You cannot always grasp them.
Delusion and selfishness—
You cannot always purge them.
Deep attachments—
You cannot always abandon them.
The Dharma-body without form—
You cannot always recognize it.
Precepts and rules—
You cannot always uphold them.
Afflictions and ignorance—
You cannot always extinguish them.
Worldly habits—
You cannot always dissolve them.
Obstacles—
You cannot always remove them.
Sacred mantras and wondrous methods—
You cannot always follow them.
Karma of merit and sin—
You cannot always believe in them.
Worldly mind and attitudes—
You cannot always forget them.
Desires and clinging—
You cannot always empty them.
False paths and heterodoxies—
You cannot always discern them.
Transient illusions—
You cannot always penetrate them.
All things—
You cannot always respond to them.
Realms and stages—
You cannot always transcend them.
Sages and true teachers—
You cannot always seek them.
The boundless Dao—
You cannot always enter it.
This very life—
You cannot always save it.
Your original aspiration—
You cannot fully realize it.

Disciples, why is this?
Because of your arrogance and pride,
I cannot transform you.
With gentle words, I cannot persuade you.
With doubt, I cannot awaken you.
With heavy sins, I cannot redeem you.
With rage and slander, I cannot restrain you.
With flattery, I cannot defy you.
With stubbornness, I cannot guide you.
With deceit, I cannot abandon you.
With honest words, you cannot accept them.
With delusion, I cannot break through.
With blindness, I cannot enlighten.
With recklessness, I cannot restrain.
With sickness and suffering, I cannot heal.
With fate and calamity, I cannot spare.
With predestined time, I cannot pardon.
With karmic retribution, I cannot free.
With cosmic law, I cannot exempt.
With fiery mountains and sword-trees, I cannot shield.
With the boat of compassion, I cannot ferry.
With elixirs and treasures, I cannot bestow.
Though heaven’s secrets may turn you,
Though divine powers may guide you—
Disciples, only through resolute aspiration and strict observance,
Without deviation in precepts,
Seeking singularity in concentration,
With sincerity undivided—
Only then do you truly turn back to the Way.

Disciples, turn back to the Way,
And repentance shall naturally cleanse you.

Disciples, my teaching is now complete,
The Dao-field is fulfilled.

Yet I ponder you—
Father and son ascending the mountain,
A father cannot pass the Dao to his son,
Nor can a son replace his father.
Each follows the Way alone,
Knowing cold and warmth for oneself,
Advancing or retreating by one’s own will.

Thus, my teaching holds no single method.
Only like prescribing medicine to cure illness,
Administering remedies to symptoms.
When the ailment is healed and the symptoms vanish,
No further need for prescriptions or medicine remains.

Like crossing a river—
A boat is necessary until the shore is reached.
Once ashore, one does not cling to the boat.

Like threading a needle—
Once the garment is sewn, no further need for needle or thread.

Do not add unnecessary embellishments,
Or seek the snake after the grass is pulled.

Only strive earnestly forward,
Upholding precepts with sincerity and discipline.
Within precepts, forget precepts;
Beyond laws, add laws.
When the practice is profound and the moment arrives,
You shall naturally be raised by the ancestors,
Guided to true enlightenment.

Do not lack resolve,
Relying on teachers or leaning on fellow practitioners,
Clinging to names and forms,
All day and year,
Blindly following others’ footsteps.

Instead, fix your heart,
Unshaken by doubt.
With single-minded devotion,
Unwavering even unto death.

When the moment is ripe,
Has not Heaven never failed the resolute?

The Dao stands still and unmoving,
Yet those who respond may attain it.

Disciples, if you truly cultivate fierce intent,
Pressing forward without hesitation,
Yearning without turning back—
This is high aspiration,
The seed of the Dao’s gate.

The Master’s silent verse,
Not lightly revealed to all,
Now I recite for you—
Listen closely.

**"The Verse Says:**

Life and death are transient—awaken to this truth,
Die alone, unconcerned by others’ eyes.

Do not lean on others for your own salvation,
Even gods and immortals must cross the river alone.

Not just the six dusts and six senses,
Nor clinging to any single path—
The mind must dwell ever-present,
Yet neither cling to permanence nor to impermanence.

Knowing the cause, you pierce through illusion’s veil—
No cause remains when wisdom dawns.

On the path of origin, you perceive the emptiness of self-nature,
At fruition, you awaken—who then abides in that void?

From this day forth, sever life and death’s snare,
Erase the ledger of rebirth’s wheel.

If one follows the law with strict observance,
Heaven’s unseen spirits will mark it well.

The Dragon Gate’s teaching is without foundation—
Harsh words reveal its single truth.

Do not cling to the law’s letter, sweep it aside,
Only then will the verse’s essence shine clear.

Study my words until the Dharma-body is known—
The void itself is the boundless treasure-house.

Move, and thought arises without end,
The Dao’s storehouse within the body extends blessings.

The teaching merges with the mind, mind is the teaching—
No end to the long pole’s reach.

**—*Scripture of the Azure Grove, Final Volume*"**

「The Twenty-Second Insight into the Primordial Source:
All disciples, this single point of unobscured void and spirit—
Is it not easily seen? Who then is this Primordial Source, the True Person of my Essence?

From ancient times to now, sages, immortals, Buddhas, and ancestral masters of the Dao,
Sat facing walls for nine years,
Or meditated in circles for six seasons,
Counting three threes and seven sevens,
Toiling and striving in earnest pursuit.

They traversed famous mountains and wandered blessed lands,
Sought teachers and questioned friends,
Inquired about the Way and listened to scriptures,
Practiced austere deeds and accumulated virtue through almsgiving.

All manner of cultivation—
Yet only to grasp this body’s life and death, its great karmic cause,
Unknown whence it came, unknown whither it goes,
Lost in wandering, sinking in rebirth,
Unable to escape the Wheel of Existence—
Thus they vow and strive in practice.

Some seek to sever thought and forget emotion,
As the path to transcendence,
And sit in meditation for three or five years,
Breaking countless *zazen* mats—
Yet how often has thought truly ceased,
Or emotion been forgotten?
This is but the five returning to the ten.

Some use *tianlian* (cooking lead) and *lianggong* (refining mercury)
As the path to transcendence,
And perform morning and evening rituals—
Retiring talismans, adding flames—
Yet how often have they seen the seven returns of the Jade Elixir,
Or the nine returns of the Golden Elixir?
How often have they caught the thief,
Only to release the thief again?

Some meditate on the Supreme Sovereign in silent devotion for three days.
Some refine and liberate to aid the lost,
Rescuing wandering souls from the Nine Realms of the Underworld;
Some call upon deities and summon generals,
Wearing talismans to command the True Persons;
Some raise *qi* and open the gates,
Circulating vital essence to proclaim the Wondrous Dao;
Some recite scriptures and toil in worship;
Some prepare elixirs to heal sickness and mend wounds;
Some refine and consume alchemical substances,
Hoping to ascend to the heavens;
Some imitate the *yin-yang* arts in gathering and taking;
Some breathe within the *dingqi* vessel,
Using divine *qi* to transmute lead and prolong life and command;
Some tend the sand-fire in the furnace,
Refining *maogen* (hemp roots),
Establishing merit through almsgiving.

Some cling to bodily suffering,
Embracing the *jin dan* (golden elixir) path,
Waiting for transmission to those of fortune.

Some, with shallow karmic roots,
Practice the most difficult of deeds,
Yet abandon them at the cliff’s edge.

All these obscure the true nature,
Engage in illusory cultivation—
They are but side paths.

All disciples,
To sever thought and forget emotion,
You must first perceive where thought arises,
Where emotion originates,
To grasp it firmly,
To press it steadily,
To recognize it truly,
To point it out clearly—
Only then may you proceed to sever,
Only then may you proceed to forget.

Now I ask you:
Who is this one who knows how to grasp,
How to seize,
How to recognize,
How to point out,
How to sever thought,
How to forget emotion?

Even if you sever thought and forget emotion,
Break countless meditation mats—
Thought remains thought,
Emotion remains emotion.

The assembly,
Severing thought as thought,
Is called *putting one’s head on top of one’s head*;
Forgetting emotion as emotion,
Is called *catching the thief and releasing the thief*.

Better yet,
To forget the very law of forgetting,
To sever the very law of severing—
Both roots forgotten,
Entering the Gate of Marvels—
This alone is the supreme teaching.

All disciples,
When I sever thought from the law,
You do not know that the law itself is the thought’s origin;
When I sever emotion from the law,
You do not know that the law itself is the seed of emotion.

The assembly,
Severing thought is not as good as thought severing itself,
Forgetting emotion is not as good as emotion forgetting itself—
This is called *seeking others is not as good as seeking oneself*.

All disciples,
Those who transmute lead and refine mercury,
Who adjust the fire’s stages,
Who mimic the *yin-yang* hexagrams—
They mutilate the *Taiqi* (Great Polarity) and *Hunyuan* (Chaos Primordial),
Taking false names as true practice,
Pointing at metaphors as actual deeds.

They rashly speak of the Three Fields,
Blindly guess at vital *qi* and essence,
The seven emotions as mechanical traps,
The nine orifices as pivotal hinges.

They take the seven characters and nine characters,
The returns and exchanges,
As seven times, nine times,
Seven rounds, nine rounds,
Seven stages, nine stages,
Seven years, nine years,
Seven transformations, nine transformations.

This drawing of diagrams,
That summoning of forms—
Today it is *Kan* and *Li* (Water and Fire) interacting,
Tomorrow it is *Earth-Heaven* (Tai) harmony,
The day after it is *Hun* and *Po* (soul and spirit) merging,
This year it is the same infant,
Next year it is the same infant—
Until nine years pass,
Still an ignorant, unborn sinner.

They do not know their own errors,
Yet shake their heads,
Curse their fingers,
And face outsiders with false claims:
*"On that day, I conceived the holy child,
The fire’s stages were nurtured correctly,
The bathing time was not amiss—
Yet why, after ten months, does no infant appear?
Is it because our fate is shallow, our sins deep,
And the spirits do not allow fulfillment?"*

They clutch their bellies,
Age their faces,
Strain their eyes,
And shed hollow tears.

Do you know these base-rooted, foolish ones?
They do not recognize their own heart,
Nor understand their true nature—
Their karma is thick as night,
What wisdom could they possess?
Do you know these people?
They still aspire upward,
Yet remain in darkness,
Unawakened to the path of ascent.

Your body’s essence and *qi*,
Are the Primordial *Yuanqi* (Original *Qi*) and *Yuanjing* (Original Essence)—
Unincreasing, undiminishing treasures.
If you stir them,
They do not grow;
If you do not stir them,
They do not wane.

This unobscured void and spirit—
The true essence—
Is the Primordial Spirit.

Yet they say,
*"What is this Primordial Spirit?
Is it not that infant?"*

From countless eons past,
Your sins remain unexpiated,
Obstacles unsevered,
The heart’s source uncleaned,
The nature’s root unilluminated.

You do not early repent your transgressions,
Nor change your disposition,
Nor seek a teacher to awaken to the Way—
Instead, you waste this precious, limited time,
Chasing that shadowy infant,
For what purpose?

All disciples,

Within your own bodies,
You know good and evil,
You know right and wrong,
You know corruption and rectitude,
You know birth and death,
You know self and other,
You know true and false—
This is the infant.

Yet this infant,
Originally does not know
Good and evil, right and wrong,
Corruption and rectitude, birth and death,
Self and other, true and false.

This infant does not cling to forms,
Nor does it generate mind from phenomena,
Nor mind from wisdom,
Nor wisdom from knowledge,
Nor knowledge from good to know evil,
Nor right to know wrong,
Nor rectitude to know corruption,
Nor birth to know death,
Nor self to know other,
Nor truth to know falsehood.

Originally devoid of *wōxiàng* (self-form),
And devoid of *fēikōngxiàng* (non-empty form),
It merely responds to all things
Through this point of perception in the world’s movement.

If one speaks of *Tàijí* (Supreme Polarity) and *Hùnyuán* (Chaotic Unity),
Then even this knowledge may be considered as *wúzhī* (non-knowledge).

Yet this knowledge is *liángzhī* (True Knowing),
The Buddhist school calls it *shànzhīshì* (Wise Knowing),
The Daoist school names it the *bāoyǐngyuánshén* (Infant Primordial Spirit).

In summary, all disciples,
It is merely this unobscured void-spirit essence—
The true nature of your being.

You only see Daoists enter the *yúnquán* (circular meditation chamber),
Practice sitting in meditation,
Speak of nurturing the embryo (*huáitāi*),
After ten months in seclusion,
Have you ever seen any Daoist
Reveal the infant’s form,
Manifest its luminosity?

Before they enter the *yúnquán*,
They do not know
The states of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and gods,
The principles of *yīnyáng* (yin-yang),
The calamities and blessings of humankind,
The auspicious or inauspicious in the future,
Nor their year of birth or day of death.

After they leave the *yúnquán*,
They still do not know.

If they do not understand their own birth and death,
They cannot save themselves—
How can they save others?

If they do not comprehend their own birth and death,
Nor discern auspicious and inauspicious,
Bound by Heaven and Earth as they are,
Their birth is no different from the common folk’s sufferings,
Their death is no different from the ordinary’s fate—
Buried in filth, decaying in stench.

Then this entering the *yúnquán* to sit in meditation,
Is it not merely futile?

All disciples,
You must first forget the mind of death,
Then enter the *yúnquán*;
You must first sever the ties of desire,
Then practice sitting in meditation.

When lustful thoughts are long extinguished,
The kidneys suffice,
And true *lián* (lead) ascends.

When angry thoughts are long extinguished,
The heart becomes void,
And true *gōng* (mercury) descends.

When diet is regulated in accordance with the seasons,
The spleen grows strong,
And mercury and lead are sealed and fixed.

When emotions are emptied,
The lungs are moistened,
And when the nature is settled,
The liver flourishes,
And the kidneys’ waters abound—
Then the eyes shine brightly,
And the pupils are like black lacquer.

When the heart’s fire is quenched,
The mouth’s saliva fills,
And its taste is as sweet as *lì* (fermented rice drink).

When the spirit is pure,
The liver’s *qi* flows smoothly,
And the sinews and bones grow light.

When the ethereal soul is at peace,
The lungs’ fluids circulate,
And the hair and beard turn dark.

When the spleen is robust and the stomach harmonious,
The tongue and throat are agile,
And the voice resounds clear.

When the orifices are open and the blood is abundant,
All diseases are repelled;
When the five flavors are bland,
True *qi* arises.

By practicing *tāoyǐn* (guiding and pulling exercises)
In accordance with the four seasons and eight periods,
You can resist the intrusion of wind, cold, heat, and dampness.

By restraining the six desires and seven emotions,
And subduing the nature to calm the mind,
You can ward off the influence of demons and malevolent spirits.

By seeking the Great Dao,
True Knowing manifests,
And the true nature is illuminated.

When you awaken to *zhēnrú* (Suchness),
The physical form becomes void,
And the Dharma-body is revealed.

First save yourself,
Then save others—
But ultimately, it is to save yourself.

All disciples,
At this stage,
You have only taken the first step
Through the great gate.

Then, enter the *yúnquán* to sit in stillness,
Ascend to Heaven,
Descend to Earth,
And perceive the states of ghosts and gods,
The mechanisms of Heaven and Earth—
All within the breath’s span,
All within the grasp of creation.

This is all achieved through *jièdìng* (restraint and meditation).

Thus, when entering the *yúnquán*,
You are but a mortal embryo and ordinary bones;
When leaving the *yúnquán*,
You are a sacred body and Dharma-form.

Understanding the Great Dao,
Your vision expands—
You see through all ties as illusory and false.

With a staff in hand,
Your heart broadens—
You embrace Heaven and Earth within the boundless void.

Before others act, I already know;
Before events unfold, I foresee.

Only then is it the *liùtōng* (Six Perfections),
With boundless wisdom—
All heavenly demons bow in submission,
And the Dark Protectors (*àn hù*) reverently guard.

All external paths of the ten directions submit,
And all tremble in awe.

Within a sesame seed,
The *xūmíshān* (Sumeru Mountain) is contained—
Unperceived.

Within a grain of millet,
The ten-directional worlds are hidden—
Unknown.

At will, you roam
The vast Earth and mountains and rivers—
Unfettered.

At will, you retreat
Into the subtlest dust or grain—
Secure.

All disciples,
This Dao of effortless ascent to the utmost truth is first
In discerning the subtle principles and awakening to Heaven’s mysteries.

Thus, you must abandon
All blind meditation, chaotic sitting,
Cooking lead and refining mercury,
Concentrating on thoughts and visualizations,
Purifying and transforming to aid the lost,
Seeking official titles and records,
Shaking fans to gather *qi*,
Reciting sutras and chanting scriptures,
Mixing medicines and burning incense,
And all other practices of alchemical furnaces—
These myriad futile affairs,
Do not hasten to them,
But set them aside entirely.

Sincerely and earnestly,
Make vows to Heaven,
Swear with resolve.

From this day onward,
And into the future,
May you swiftly comprehend
The mysteries of birth and death,
Escape the suffering of cyclic existence,
Avoid all false paths,
And attain the wondrous Dao.

Ah!
This saying of *"avoiding all false paths"* (*lí zhǒngzhǒng biān*)
Is indeed the great expedient gate
For discerning the subtle principles and awakening to Heaven’s mysteries.

All disciples,
What are these *"false paths"*?

They are blind meditation, chaotic sitting,
Cooking lead and refining mercury—
All these peripheral practices.

What is *"false"*?
Peripheral practices are neither central nor correct.
Like a table’s edges,
These peripheral paths lie at the four sides—
They cannot enter the heart.
Even if they enter the heart,
They do not leave the table.
Yet you do not realize:
Only by leaving the table
Can one attain the void’s Great Dao.
If you cannot leave the table,
You remain but an object—
Not the Dao—
Is this not *"false"*?

*"False"* means seeking (*xún*),
It means deviation (*xié*),
It means boundary (*jiè*),
It means shore (*yá*).

Peripheral means not central,
Deviation means not upright.
With boundaries,
You cannot be vast and boundless;
With shores,
You cannot be profound and pure.

Clinging tightly to this fleshly sack,
mistaking it for a thousand-year-old cypress,
a ten-thousand-year-old green pine—
only to suffocate the true protagonist alive.

Instead, you abandon the lamp to seek fire,
cling to the false while discarding the true—
is this not tipping to one side?

Even if you succeed,
you remain but a *self-liberated one*.

You have not yet seen your true nature—
though you attain fruition,
your merits exhausted, you still enter the wheel of rebirth,
struggling to transcend the Three Realms.
What benefit do you bring to these beings?

Disciples,
to become an immortal, a Buddha,
a sage, or a worthy—
all lies in abandoning self for others,
in vowing to liberate all beings.

Now, these practitioners who sit in meditation
cannot even liberate themselves—
how could they liberate others?
Called *self-liberated ones*,
have they ever truly understood the Great Dao,
the boundless liberation of all?

They linger in peripheral practices—
deeply pitiable!

The True Lord speaks in verse,
revealing the true mechanism,
teaching the assembly to abandon self-seeking
and to step beyond one-sided methods.

Thus, those of peripheral teachings
return to the central path,
while deviant doctrines revert to the true law.
Bounded realms are opened into boundlessness,
the vast world unfolds to reach heaven and earth,
channeled ditches with shores are widened into limitless expanse.
The unfathomable Dharma-body
expands into formlessness, beyond self and other.

The scriptures say:
*"Seeing without seeing me,
hearing without hearing me,
leaving all boundaries—
this is called the wondrous Dao."*

Disciples,
the gate to realization begins with an open mind.
From where does life arise?
To where does death return?
Seek the lofty, enlightened teachers,
the wise and sincere friends.
Nurture boundless compassion,
and investigate thoroughly.

Life is like a cup of tea—
constrained by form, the water retains its taste.
Pour it into the Eastern Ocean,
and it becomes vast waves and surging tides.
If you seek my original source,
saying the water is now tea because of added flavor—
then it has color and form.
Yet within this ocean’s depths,
my original source resides.
What, then, is my original source?
Investigate carefully,
until seeing without sight,
hearing without sound.

With prolonged cultivation,
the chest suddenly opens,
the vision clears to the ground—
the original face is seen,
the subtle mechanism revealed,
and the true nature confirmed:
the Dao was never unworthy of humanity!

Disciples,
the sages, immortals, and Buddhas have long ascended.
To see their hearts,
first clarify their principles.
Clarifying their principles,
you awaken to their methods,
and act in their deeds.
Acting in their deeds,
you become their embodiment.

Disciples,
where is the heart of the sages, immortals, and Buddhas?
It lies within each person’s *fangcun* [heart-mind].
Where is their principle?
It stands before each person’s eyes.
Where is their method?
It is within the scriptures and histories.
Their deeds do not exceed worldly law—
they are found within worldly affairs.
Their bodies reside in their very core.

If you know the sages’, immortals’, and Buddhas’ hearts
within your *fangcun*,
you can clarify their principles.
Clarifying their principles,
you awaken to their methods.
Awakening to their methods,
you can act in their deeds.
Clarifying their principles,
the true path is preserved.
Awakening to their methods,
all conditions are realized.
Acting in their deeds,
meritorious deeds are established—
and the celestial mechanism never ceases,
enduring through countless kalpas.

Know that such a person’s supernatural powers and wisdom
already embody the sages’, immortals’, and Buddhas’ essence—
this is their heart.

Then, receiving the *Zhongji* Precepts,
the nature is opened,
the Mystic Pass unblocked—
and you can clarify their principles.
Then, receiving the *Tianxian* Precepts,
delving into profound truths,
wisdom becomes boundless—
and you can traverse their Dao.

Then, liberated without obstruction,
round or square,
vast or small,
moving or still,
forward or backward,
alive or dead,
bent or stretched,
exiting or entering,
sage or worthy,
immortal or Buddha—
you can manifest in the Four Births,
the Six Realms,
heaven or emptiness,
or the underworld.
Adapting teachings to each,
you liberate beings through kalpas.
Transformation is unfathomable,
manifesting in person to teach.

Like a boundless mirror reflecting all forms,
mutually containing—
you can act in their deeds,
become their embodiment,
and attain their fruition.

Disciples,
this is called *parametrizing subtle principles*
and *awakening to celestial mechanisms*.

Long ago, the Yellow Emperor lost his *Xuanzhu* [Mysterious Pearl]
in the Red River,
and sent *Lizhu* to retrieve it—
but *Lizhu* could not find it.
Then he sent *Qie Gou*—
*Qie Gou* could not find it.
Finally, he sent *Wangxiang*—
and *Wangxiang* obtained it.

*Lizhu* was one who dwelled in the *Ligong* [Red Palace],
the post-heavenal fleshly cluster of the heart—
thus he could not find it,
symbolizing those today who cling to one-sided views.

*Qie Gou* was one who clung to defilements,
practicing purity of mouth and body,
relying on fasting—
yet even this refined heart could not attain it.

As for *Wangxiang*,
how did he succeed?

The *Wángxiàng*—*wáng* means "none," *xiàng* means "form and color."
Thus, *Wángxiàng* refers to that which is formless and colorless.

Therefore, it is not called the *Bright Pearl*, but the *Xuanzhu* [Mysterious Pearl].
Just as the most exalted Sage-Teacher Confucius said:
*"That which transcends form is called the Dao/Way;
that which is within form is called instruments."*

And the Supreme Old Ancestor [Laozi] proclaimed:
*"Look inward to the heart—
the heart has no heart;
look outward to the form—
the form has no form."*

Disciples,
this is the fundamental truth of ultimate reality.
Sages of sages, Daoists of Daoists, Buddhas of Buddhas—
all abide in non-clinging, non-manipulation.

If one clings to forms in practice,
then the Yellow Emperor would have sought the *Xuanzhu* through wisdom,
fasting, and purity—
and yet still failed to obtain it.

Disciples!
The Yellow Emperor lost the *Xuanzhu* and found it through *Wángxiàng*;
ordinary mortals grasp profound truth through the *wu-xin* [heartless] multitude.

I have fully revealed the celestial mechanisms,
unveiled the heart-seal.
Yet you must scrutinize carefully,
guard vigilantly—
lest the *Xuanzhu* be lost in the Red River,
and you never know where to seek it again!

Thus, I admonish the disciples to bow in reverence and listen to the gāthā:

*"A thousand scrolls of Daoist scriptures cannot exhaust it,
one direct pointer reveals it utterly.
I urge you not to dabble in myriad methods—
the Dao/Way lies in the heart, not in books.

Clinging to forms while seeking the Mysterious—
endless delusions arise.
With intent in meditation, one becomes a demon.
Many stray down false paths,
while the straight path stands unchallenged.

The True Person has no form, no shape—
a segment of celestial mechanism displayed everywhere.
Do not grope blindly before your eyes,
nor abandon the true path for side doors."*

At that time, Kunyangzi Putong, having completed his dedication to the assembly, admonished his disciple Shi Shouping to compile the teachings into a written record. He then presented it to the Master of the Precepts for inscription to benefit later generations. The Master of the Precepts replied:

*"No need. Simply pass it down from person to person. After one hundred and seventy years, it shall be established as the* **Jìyuàn Tánjīng** *."*
