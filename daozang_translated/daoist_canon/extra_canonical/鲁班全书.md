**(Section I: Opening the Mountain and Felling Trees)**

*Invocation of the Mountain Spirit and Deities*
Humbly petitioning this locality’s most potent Land Spirit—who traverses the heavens and earth, enters and exits the unseen realms—convey my decree: do not delay. The Black-Horse Land Spirit shall go forth to welcome and invite.

To the Celestial Officials of the Rivers and Mountains, all temple deities and the hundred spirits, the Mountain King and Sovereign of this domain, the Venerable Broad-Eyed Deity, the ancestral spirits of the earthly domain, the ancient elders of old, the ancestral halls of the soil, all sages and worthies—may they receive my transmission. The disciple, with utmost reverence, invokes the Daoist Master Lu Ban of Hongzhou.

To the Inner Palace of the Great Emperor, Lady Yun, the Teacher-Father and Teacher-Grandfather, the Venerable Sage and True Lord’s Mother, Lady Wu, the Immortal Sisters—may they be summoned to the place of ablution, receive the command, and take their seats. Offerings of true incense are presented.

With sincere devotion, I invite the seventy-two generations of masters, the Craftsman Zhang the Great General, Master Zhao the Skilled, and those who have fulfilled their duties before me. The first libation of wine is poured, for wine is the elixir of the immortals. Before and behind the mountain, it is said that wine is the soup of the immortals—now offered to the divine kings. Today, as we open the mountain and fell trees, may the spirits behind protect us in safety. The second libation is poured, the third libation is complete.

The rites do not require repeated pouring. By decree of the Great Zhonghua Empire, [specific locality], the disciple now seals the Red Mouth.

For the opening of the mountain and felling of trees, ten long strings of cash are burned to secure the horse’s safety. Before and behind the mountain, to the left and right, if any have offered sacrifices—whether of the Five Tones or Five Clans, male or female, or orphaned spirits—let them all come to receive the money.

Those with halls return to their halls; those without return to the palaces. Manifestations appear in all directions, yet none shall harm the common folk in this realm. After the disciple has opened the mountain and felled trees, there are no taboos in heaven or earth, no restrictions in years or months, no prohibitions in days or times—all is supremely auspicious. Jiang Taigong is present; all spirits withdraw. The Golden Light Edict and the Edicts of the Sun and Moon are proclaimed.

**(Section II: Establishing a Miscellaneous Mountain Structure)**

*Invocation of the Land Spirit and Deities*
Humbly petitioning this locality’s Land Spirit, the Cloud-Mounted Horse, and the Horse Boy—let them go forth to welcome and invite. To the Celestial Officials of the Rivers and Mountains, all temple deities and the hundred spirits, the Mountain King and Sovereign of this domain, the Venerable Broad-Eyed Deity, the ancestral spirits of the earthly domain, the ancient elders of old, the ancestral halls of the soil, all sages and worthies, the Five Directions’ Five Emperors, and the Soil Official’s Venerable Deities—may they receive my transmission. The disciple, with utmost reverence, invokes the Daoist Master Lu Ban of Hongzhou, the Inner Palace of the Great Emperor, Divine Mother Lady Han, Lady Yun, Mother Wu, the Immortal Sisters, the Teacher-Father, Teacher-Grandfather, and all Venerable Sage Lords.

May they be summoned to the place of ablution, receive the command, and take their seats. Offerings of true incense are presented. With sincere devotion, I invite five or six ancestral masters, the seventy-two generations of masters, the Craftsman Zhang the Great General, Master Zhao the Skilled, the Pure-Ink Boy, the Ink-Level Lord, the Celestial Official Xiao He, the historical disciples of the mountain—Wooden Horse Boys, Pure-Ink Lords—let them assemble at the incense table. The apprentice [name] of the Daoist Master Lu Ban, the Divine Craftsman of Hongzhou, the Immortal Sons and Daughters, and the Immortal kin—may they be summoned to the place of ablution, receive the command, and take their seats with reverence.

The transmission of the past and the teachings of the present—may the ancestors and grandfathers descend at this time. The historical leaders of the alliance now oversee the construction of the foundation stones and the raising of the beams.

The spirits are invited in order; the wine is poured to completion. A scroll of scripture is read to ensure the spirits are seated. The Primordial Lock is sealed, and prayers are offered to all spirits. The Land Spirit of the Left and Right Neighbors alone may be purchased—no others shall be improperly honored. The merit is dedicated to the Dao. Within and without, all is tranquil. Each deity takes its proper place, and each guards its domain. The Most High has decreed: sweep away all malevolent spirits, obtain the protection of the Lawful Deities, and safeguard the transmission of the True Way. Return to the Great Dao. All is harmonious, prosperous, and true. By decree, there are no taboos—hear the proclamation of the saints! There are no restrictions in heaven or earth, no prohibitions in years or months, no limitations in days or times. The order is given by hand.

*Proclamation:*
In the Great Zhonghua Empire, [specific county, township, village, and location], a house is being constructed and established with purity. Wine and offerings are prepared; the first libation is poured, the second, the third—now complete. The rites do not require repeated pouring. The spirits are seated, and money is offered. The Wind-and-Fire Transmission is complete; private funds are used for seating. The Five Directions are now complete. There are no taboos in heaven or earth, no prohibitions in years or months, no limitations in days or times.

**(Section III: Secret Rites for the Incense Altar)**

*The Horse’s Installation and Sacrificial Rites*
The disciple holds a rooster to sacrifice to the Horse. The Beam is sacrificed upon its raising. Red envelopes and gold are offered in thanks; the Horse withdraws. All is supremely auspicious and prosperous.

*Five-Directional Seating Rites*
For the seating of the Five Directions, wine is offered with five colored fabrics, each measuring one *chi* two *cun*. The wine is poured in three libations to the South, North, East, West, and Center—where the Green, Red, White, Yellow, and Black Emperors and Dragon Deities descend to guard the incense hall. From the South to the East, Center, West, and North, until dawn, all is complete. The disciple’s money and treasures are respectfully offered. The Dragon Deities of the South, East, North, Center, and West return to their homelands.

The North, East, South, Center, and West are now released. The Black, Green, Red, Yellow, and White Dragon Deities are locked within their domains. Thus, the disciple’s rites are complete. After the teachings are concluded, the five colored fabrics—each one *chi* two *cun*—are distributed.

**(Section IV: Raising Water and Securing the Fetus)**

*The Five Phases and Fetal Stability*
When the sun rises, its verdant light reveals the Five-Directional Water-Raising Masters. The first summons the East—Wood, *Jia* and *Yi*. The second summons the South—Fire, *Bing* and *Ding*. The third summons the West—Metal, *Geng* and *Xin*. The fourth summons the North—Water, *Ren* and *Gui*. The fifth summons the Center—Earth, *Wu* and *Ji*.

The Star Lord of Earth descends to the mortal realm. The first sprinkling stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the East. The second stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the South. The third stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the West. The fourth stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the North. The fifth stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the Center. All Five Fetal Spirits are now stable and complete, each dispersing to their respective directions and returning to the gateways.

With hands in the water bowl, I command—
The first sprinkling opens the heavens,
The second splits the earth,
The third brings longevity to humankind,
The fourth annihilates malevolent spirits,
The fifth invokes the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper and the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.
I, in the name of the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*), act swiftly as the decree commands.

**Jiang Taigong** (*Jiāng Tàigōng*) stands here—
All spirits retreat,
Heaven and Earth have no prohibitions.
**Pǔ'ān Zǔshī**, the Great Sage of Mastery over the World,
I beseech you to manifest in my palm.
I command the spirits of the East, South, West, North, and Center—
They rise in the boundless void,
In the unclaimed realm,
In the unclaimed direction.
I now summon the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper and the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.
I, in the name of the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao**, act swiftly as the decree commands.

**Pǔ'ān Zǔshī**, **Pútí Zǔshī**, **Língqí Zǔshī**,
And all the Venerable Masters who have come here—
After the water-raising is complete,
All prohibitions vanish.
With twelve long coins in hand,
I command in the water bowl.

**(Five) Water-Raising Ritual**
*Qián yuán hèn lì zhēn* (The Primordial Dao/Way, the Great Virtue/Power, the Nourishing Virtue/Power, and the Perfect Virtue/Power),
I inscribe the talismans to bind the Six *Ding* (stars),
To stabilize the Fetal Spirit within the ten months of gestation,
To ensure the Six Livestock are born in six months,
To make the grasses of deep mountains unmoving,
To halt the waters of sandy slopes from rushing.
I, in the name of the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao**, act swiftly as the decree commands.

I transmit the Master’s talisman.

**(Six) Ritual of Striking the Mortar**
The first strike resounds until dawn breaks—
It startles the household and land spirits.
The first strike sends the heavenly spirits back to their celestial realm,
The second strikes the earthly spirits into the **Yōumíng** (netherworld),
The third drives away malevolent and ferocious deities,
All obey my command in terror.
The mortar struck to the ground—
All prohibitions vanish.
**Jiang Taigong** stands here—
All spirits retreat.
Great fortune and auspiciousness abound.

Neither too early nor too late,
This is the moment when the disciple strikes the mortar.
This is no ordinary strike—
**Lúbān** (the divine carpenter) bestowed upon me the **Constructing Household Mortar** (*Zào Zhái Chuí*).
The first strike sends the heavenly spirits back to their celestial realm,
The second strikes the earthly *xié* (malevolent spirits) into the **Yōumíng**,
The third sends the ghostly spirits to their western retreat,
The fourth prevents evil demons from approaching.

Here, the **Fēi Xióng Dà Jiāngjūn** (Flying Bear Marshal) arrives,
Turning all **wāngliàng** (goblins and demons) to ash.
All prohibitions vanish,
Great fortune and auspiciousness abound.

I command with my hands.

**(Seven) Ritual of Sacrificing to the Beam**

「This beam, this beam,
Where did you grow? Where did you sprout?
You grew before **Qīnglóng Shān** (Green Dragon Mountain),
You grew behind **Qīnglóng Shān** (Green Dragon Mountain).
Who saw you grow? Who saw you flourish?
**Lúbān** (the divine carpenter) rode through **Línzhōng** (Forest of Pines),
This wood, curved and fine, is perfect for a beam.
**Lǐ Láng** (Master Li) dared not cut it on his way,
**Zhāng Láng** (Master Zhang) hurried back upon hearing,
Handraising his **zhuó fǔ** (adze and axe), rushing in haste.
At the twelfth hour, he felled a **Chénxiāng** (Sandalwood) beam—one root,
Measured with a great **chǐ** (foot): **Yī zhàng bā** (one *zhàng* eight *chǐ*),
Measured with a small **chǐ** (foot): **Liǎng zhàng cháng** (two *zhàng* long).
With a great saw, he trimmed the head,
With a small saw, he trimmed the tip.
After trimming both ends, he sought the middle—
The master summoned a skilled carpenter,
Who carefully shaped and planed it in the woodyard.
A pair of wooden horses like **yuān yāng** (mandarin ducks),
A curved ruler and **mòdǒu** (carpenter’s square) like a **fènghuáng** (phoenix).
A single line of ink, not too long,
Placed upon it—radiant and resplendent.
Hewn from the mountain, its scales like **yú lín** (fish scales) and **jīn jiǎ** (golden armor),
Carved with the **zhuó fǔ** (adze and axe)—beam blossoms for the **shuàngyuán láng** (top scholar).
Chopping, chopping with the adze—
Planing, planing with the **bàozi** (plane),
The two ends sculpted into **lóng hǔ** (dragon and tiger) forms,
Midsection filled with **fú lù shòu** (fortune, prosperity, longevity) in abundance.
The **Tiānzǐ** (Heavenly Son) bends this beam—
**Hé shuǐ mángmáng** (River waters boundless),
Great fortune and auspiciousness abound,
Long life and blessings follow in turn.

**Use hand command.**

**(Eight) Ritual of Marking the Beam**

**Tiāndì yángyáng yī kāichǎng** (Heaven and Earth in harmonious brilliance—opening the ritual),
Today, the disciple marks the **Lifetime Beam** (*Shòu liáng*).
Not to mention how this beam came to be—
This rooster has a lineage to tell:
**Táng Ráng** (Tang Emperor) sent a melon to wander the **Dìfù** (Underworld),
**Sānzàng** (the Three Treasures) went westward to fetch the **jīng** (scriptures),
Bringing back three pairs and six eggs,
Returning home to embrace the **fènghuáng** (phoenix).
From within, he embraced the rooster—
In the year of **yín** (the Tiger), he embraced a **yínjī** (silver rooster),
In the year of **mǎo** (the Hare), he embraced a **mǎojī** (rooster of the Hare).
It grew well-behaved,
Flying into the disciple’s hands.
Renamed, reattired—
Called the **Marking Beam Rooster** (*Diǎn liángjī*).
This rooster marks the beam’s head—
The master’s descendants will be **gōng hòu** (noble and illustrious),
Marks the beam’s tail—
The master’s house will be piled with gold and silver.
Marks the beam’s waist—
The master’s fortune and longevity will surpass the heavens.
After marking the head and tail of the beam,
The master’s house will be stacked with gold—
Congratulations, wealth and prosperity arrive!

**Use hand command.**
**With a long coin of three or five pieces.**»

**(Nine) Secret Utterances for Raising the Beam**
The sun shines upon me to settle in,
The purple *zhēng* [auspicious omen] spreads across the earth as I turn the scriptures.
The Four Great Classics are all turned—
Today, I install the beam of longevity.
On the left, I install a thousand years of auspice,
On the right, I install ten thousand years of fortune.
On both sides, I install virtue, luck, and longevity,
In the center, I install a vault of gold as vast as a *dǒu* [bushel measure].
Sons and grandsons will become *gōng hòu* [noble lords],
Congratulations—wealth and prosperity arrive!
**Hand command:**
*"Beam-head command, beam-waist command, beam-tail command."*

**(Ten) The Rite of Cleansing the Beam**
Today, I summon the Master of Horses,
To welcome the most spiritually potent *tǔdìshén* [land deity] of this place—
One who traverses heaven and earth,
Enters the netherworld and emerges from darkness,
And relays my words without delay.
On the day of merit, I shall record your name for celestial petition,
Not to other prefectures, not to other counties—
But to summon the *yúnzhōng túchǔ* [Cloud Peak disciples],
The *mùmǎ tǔdìshén* [wooden-horse land deity],
The *běnjìng shāngwáng tiānzǐ* [local mountain king sovereign],
The *guǎngmù zūnshén* [Wide-Eyed Venerable],
To assemble at the *jiàn* [beam] altar,
To preside over the cleansing of the beam,
To safeguard peace and well-being.
With reverent incense burned, I now summon *Chén Jìng Lǎozǔ* [Master Chen Jing],
*"Carriage and horses depart for which county?
Carriage and horses depart for which prefecture, which county, which place?"*
At the bridgehead, the *sān zhǔn tǔdì* [three-prepared land deities],
This is the ancestral hall of the Master,
This is the ancestral temple of the Master.
I summon you to the beam altar,
To safeguard merit and virtue.
I now summon the *niánlì wēnyǐn tǔdì* [yearly plague-exorcising land deity],
The *jiànmén tǔdì* [beam-gate land deity],
To assemble at the beam altar,
To preside over the cleansing,
To safeguard purity.
Again, I burn true incense,
And summon with filial devotion:

*Zhāng Láng dàjiàng* [General Zhang Lang],
*Zhào Qiǎo xiānshī* [Master Zhao Qiao],
The *shéngmò tóngzǐ* [measuring-line child],
The *qūchǐ lángjūn* [square-ruler lord],
To assemble at the beam gate,
To preside over the cleansing of the beam,
To safeguard merit and virtue.
Again, I burn true incense,
With filial devotion,
Transmitting the Dao from past to present,
Ancestral masters, *shīyé rùkǒu chuándù shī* [oral transmission masters],
To preside as witnesses,
To safeguard the household’s purity.
I burn true incense,
And with filial devotion, I summon all saints and sages,
To assemble at the beam altar.
*"With a knife-edge pure wine, open the jar to offer—
First libation: a cup of wine, the bottle fragrant with a hundred flowers,
The gods arrive here—
Mounted on horses, they grant names to generals.
I stand before merit—
Second libation: wine offered to the gods,
The gods ride dragon chariots, wielding golden whips,
A cup to honor all spirits,
Turning in the forest with smiling faces.
I stand before merit—
Third libation, the cup is full,
No need for repeated pouring.
Now, with my sincere words, I proclaim to the gods."*

*"Now, with rooster blood, I command the beam gate."*

**Great Zhōnghuá Country, [Province] [Prefecture] [Village] [Location], devout resident [Name(s)]**
*"By fire’s decree, I summon the Universal Monastery’s edict:
To collect plague, sweep away the *guàn* [encirclement], dispel the *kè* [killing array].
Exit the beam gate,
Sweep the beam gate,
With a one *chǐ* two *cùn* white cloth to seal the *chìkǒu* [red mouth],
Recite the *jiěliáng zhòu* [solving-rice pestilence] incantation,
With hands drawing the *jiěhuì nándǒu liùxīng* [six stars of the Southern Dipper],
The *běidǒu qīxīng* [seven stars of the Northern Dipper],
Commanding the talisman."*

**(Eleven) The Solving-Filth Incantation**
*"Heaven and Earth, natural and spontaneous,
The *liáng* [barley] *qi* disperses.
Cavernous emptiness, the *huàngláng dàxuán* [vast void],
Eight-directional mighty spirits,
Make me natural and unconstrained.
With the *língbǎo fúmìng* [numinous treasure command],
I proclaim to the Nine Heavens,
*Qiánluó dǎnluó* [Heavenly and Earthly Roars],
Moving the *gǎng tàixuán* [array’s supreme mystery],
Severing demons, subduing evil,
Slaying ten thousand ghosts,
Mountain incantations, *yuánshǐ wángwén* [Primordial King’s script],
Chanted once, the ghosts retreat in terror,
Shaking the Five Mountain Prisons,
The gods and demons of the Eight Seas bow their heads,
Awaiting my true words—
Malicious filth dissipates,
Daoist *qi* endures eternally.
Thus it is decreed."*

**(Twelve) Secret Affairs for Constructing the Hall of Splendor**
*"I set up the incense altar,
With reverence, I summon the most spiritually potent *tǔdìshén* of this place—
One who traverses heaven and earth,
Enters the netherworld and emerges from darkness,
And relays my words without delay.
On the day of merit, I shall record your name for celestial petition,
Urgent and respectful—
This place’s *tǔdìshén* relays to the *gōngcáo* [Functionary of Merit],

The *shīzǔ shīfù shīyé chuándù shīzūn fú* [oral transmission masters, grandmasters, and patriarchs]."*

**"Thousand calls, thousand responses; ten thousand calls, ten thousand spirits attend.
With joyous welcome, we invite the Golden Chariot to descend,
With delightful welcome, we invite the Jade Steed to arrive,
To gather before the incense altar,
Where wine is drawn from the jar—
Open the cup and pour the offering.
Before the path of faith, the first libation is poured,
The second libation, the third libation,
The wine of descent from chariot and steed,
The cup of descent from chariot and steed,
Three libations poured to fullness.

Now, this devotee of the Great Chinese Realm—of such province, such county, such village, such place—
Not for any offense do they summon,
But for the new construction of their dwelling, several rooms in number,
On a chosen auspicious day, this year, this month, this day, this hour.
They now attest to their wealth and possessions—
With reverence, they offer wine and incense, money and horses,
Various offerings laid upon the hall,
Ten long strings of cash placed before the altar,
Set upon the case.
Humbly, we implore the venerable Lu Ban, the Three Masters of Teaching,
And all holy deities,
To joyously accept the libation,
To delightfully receive the offering,
Three libations poured—
The wine of acceptance, the cup of acceptance,
Accepted and passed.

If the *shàngrè* [heat-offering] does not arrive,
Then before the feast, there is meat—
Yet the mortal cook knows only slaughter, not the art of making it hot.
Humbly, we implore all revered deities,
Lu Ban the venerable master,
And the accompanying kitchen officials,
With left hand wielding the golden blade to cleave,
And right hand wielding the jade axe to divide,
Commanding: *"Left, divide! Right, divide!"*
*"Left, divide! Right, divide!"*
*"Meat forward, bones backward!"*
Bow low to accept the libation,
Raise eyes to guard the spirit—
Three libations poured;
The wine of the *shàngrè*, the cup of the *shàngrè*,
The *shàngrè* passed.

Now, the guarantee arrives—
To safeguard the devotee’s day of constructing the Hall of Splendor,
Ensuring a thousand years of wealth, ten thousand years of glory,
A household of purity, flowing prosperity,
Abundant grains, thriving descendants,
Flourishing livestock—
Three libations poured;
The wine of guarantee, the cup of guarantee,
The guarantee passed.

Now, the *tuīhuì* [pushing away misfortune] arrives—
If wealth or grains are pushed away, let them not be;
Only the calamities of the four seasons shall be repelled—
Disasters, slander, official disputes, fire, theft, pestilence, dampness,
Insects, ghosts, and malevolent spirits—
Pushed to distant realms, banished to outer lands.
Should any evil master wield sorcery,
Gathering you into a single hall,
Or if black-faced or pale-faced men speak falsely,
They too shall be pushed to distant realms, driven to outer lands.
If a man speaks, let him be nailed with copper;
If a woman speaks, let her be nailed with iron—
Never to meet again in a thousand years, ten thousand years.

Three libations poured;
The wine of *tuīhuì*, the cup of *tuīhuì*,
The *tuīhuì* passed.

Now, the offering of money arrives—
This devotee, [name], presents twelve coins,
Delivered to Lu Ban’s Consort, Wu Shi Niangniang,
Zhang Lang and Zhao Qiao, the venerable masters,
For safekeeping in this lifetime.
With joy, they accept the libation.
Additionally, five coins of the year are given
To the Five Directional Imperial Gods and the Tortoise-Dragon Deities.

Before the sacred altar, three silver coins are presented
To the Three Masters of Teaching,
The patriarchs and grandmasters,
The transmitted and oral lineage masters—
Both yin and yang transmissions—
Offered before the Three Masters’ positions.

Again, three silver coins are given
To the Three Teachings’ incense and blessings,
The purified luminous deities,
The ancestral spirits of the household,
The young and old, the departed,
The Long-Life Land Deities, the Auspicious Regard Consort,
The Two Gate Gods, the Heavenly Lord of Response—
All presented before the sacred altar.
Three libations poured;
The wine of offering, the cup of offering,
The offering passed.

Now, the sacred lords depart—
With reverence, we send off Lu Ban’s Consort,
Wu Shi Niangniang, the Ru Shi Maiden,
Zhang Lang the General, Zhao Qiao the Venerable Master—
Each returning to their own hall, their own shrine,
Ten directions summoning them—
May the sacred ones descend in response.

The Five Directional Imperial Gods and the Household Dragon Deities
Guard the household;
The Three Masters of Teaching
Attest to the establishment.
Three libations poured;
The wine of sending, the cup of sending,
The sending complete.

Now, the *huàqián* [transformation of money] arrives—
Fire-money, the cloud path opens,
One coin becoming ten thousand—
Carried by Lu Ban the venerable master.
The door of calamity is sealed,
The door of fortune opens,
Each coin clearly accounted for.
Ten directions summon them to descend.
Humbly, we implore the Three Masters of Teaching
To protect and bless in the unseen.

Lu Ban the venerable master stands upon the cloud heights.
The sacred seal is established for the Hall of Splendor,
The attestation complete—
Heaven and Earth have no taboos,
Years and months have no taboos,
Days and hours have no taboos,
Sacrificial rites conclude,
All prohibitions lifted—
Great auspiciousness, great fortune,
Purity for ten thousand years.

**(Thirteenth Section) Invocation of the Iron Enclosure City**
Heavenly, earthly, most sacred,
I, the disciple, now erect the Iron Enclosure City,
No form revealed in the four directions and eight winds,
A copper wall of iron, ten thousand *zhang* long,
No sorcerer or man may approach.
No law can harm their body,
A single rope, eight *chi* deep,
Copper rope, iron rope at the core—
Neither gold blade nor jade shears may touch the rope.
I bind the evil master with the Five Thunders,
Humbly invoking the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper,
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper,
By the command of the Most High Venerable Lord,
*Jiújí rúlì lǐng* [urgent as the law].

**(Fourteenth Section) Sealing the Wealth Door**
We summon the most sacred Land Deities,
The Heaven-Piercing Great Emperor entering the Underworld,
To transmit our petition—
No delay on the day of merit.
The record is clear:
By the vast divine power, the radiant virtue,
We, the disciples, summon:
The Hongzhou enlightened ones—
Lu Ban the venerable ancestor,
Wu Shi the aged mother,
Zhang Lang the general,
Zhao Qiao the venerable master,
The Carpenter’s Apprentice,
The Carpenter’s Level Master,
To gather before the incense altar,
To newly seal the Wealth Door,
To receive the command of sacrifice,
To safeguard merit and virtue.
With reverent incense burned, we humbly summon:
The master of the household, the Three Teachings’ incense and blessings,
The purified luminous deities,
The Swallowing Heaven Ancient Buddha, the Highest Yellow Emperor,
The Great Sage Confucius,
The Seven-Bend Auspicious Sage,
The Sacred Cypress Sovereign,
The Horse-Riding Official of Auspicious Words,
The Child-Sending Official,
The True Martial Ancestor of the Northern Pole,
The Southern Sea Guan Yin Buddha,
The Returning Host Hall’s deities,
The Cow King of the One-Horned Clan,
Zhao Luo Meng Kang,
The Four Official Generals,
The Eastern Kitchen’s Commanding Officer,
The Kitchen God,
The Two Great Star Officials of Literature and Martial Arts,
The Two Great Gate Gods,
The Long-Life Land Deities,
The Auspicious Regard Consort,
The [Family Name] ancestral hall,
The ancestral spirits of the household, young and old,
To gather before the incense altar,
To newly seal the Wealth Door,
To receive the command of sacrifice,
To preserve the household’s purity.
The gods are summoned in full—
Three libations poured."**

The ritual command is then issued upon the rooster, the carpenter’s square, the money paper, and the red cloth—
once the command is complete,
the **Bao Guan** arrives, the assembled deities in full,
with **Bao Guan** within, **Bao Xin** for the common folk [Citizen So-and-So],
to turn misfortune into fortune in all four seasons,
to transform calamity into auspiciousness,
to bring prosperity to people and wealth to the household,
to flourish livestock—chickens and ducks in flocks,
oxen strong, sheep fat,
pigs fed to a thousand *jin* in weight,
silver to ten thousand *liang* each month.
Three libations are poured, offerings presented—
if the household has wealth, do not take wealth,
if the household has grain, do not take grain,
but only the **White Tigers** of the beam,
the **White Tigers** beneath the pillar,
the **Harming-Door White Tiger**,
before and behind the dwelling,
to the left and right of the dwelling—
foxes, wildcats, venomous snakes, fierce beasts—
banished to distant lands.
Drive away celestial omens, yearly omens, daily omens,
cast them a thousand *li* away, press them beyond the borders.
Three libations are poured before the assembly of saints.
Above, dark clouds rise in the sky,
below, the earth’s affairs unfold—
the deities receive their offerings,
summoning distant gods to attend.
At the fire’s edge, the **Money Master Supreme Deity**,
the **Zhu Gong Great Immortal**,
are invoked to transform wealth—
ten becomes a hundred, a hundred a thousand, a thousand ten thousand,
converted into **imperial currency** by decree of the **August Heaven**.

**Fifteenth Section: A Brief Account of Lu Ban’s Lineage**
Lu Ban, the Master Craftsman, shortened as **Shi Ban**,
surname **Gongchu**, given name **Yizhi**,
father **Gong Xian**, mother **Wu**,
born in the third year of Duke Ding of Lu,
on the seventh day of the fifth month, at noon,
in the year *Jiaxu*,
a native of **Luozhou, Huaxing County**, **Lulai Village**, **Luping Village**.

---
**Sixteenth Section: Joyfully Opening the Wealth Door**
Threefold congratulations, most reverent congratulations!
A towering edifice rising from the earth—
once constructed by Lu Ban in daylight,
it opens its doors by night.

**Joyous Auspicious Day for Wealth**
Most auspicious day for joy—
wealth and nobility begin anew this day!
Call out to the master of the eastern gate,
stretch forth your hand to open the wealth door.

The left hand opens the door to receive jewels and pearls,
the right hand opens the door to welcome gold.
When both hands open together,
gold as large as a *dou* rolls through the door—
great fortune in opening!

Now you come to open the wealth door—
by which path do you arrive, mountain or water?
I come from the southeast, passing through north and south,
then wandering the Five Lakes and Four Seas.
Mountains bring descendants, waters bring wealth—
from this day onward, after opening the door,
honor and riches descend from Heaven.
Great fortune in opening!

Now you come to open the wealth door—
what treasures do you bring?
Gold and silver, silk and brocade,
pearls and agate—
where does the gold and silver come from?
Where does the silk and brocade originate?
Gold and silver come from the Treasury of Wealth,
silk and brocade come from Suzhou and Hangzhou.
Great fortune in opening!

Now you come to open the wealth door—
how is it constructed?
Constructed well—
summon a carpenter and stonemason to carve floral patterns,
engrave a money-tree at the column’s peak,
a treasure basin at the *deng*,
a "whole family prosperity" beam,
and on the four eaves, carve the "golden list" with names inscribed,
as well as the "front granary" and "rear granary."
Great fortune in opening!

Spring brings joy—
may the master’s descendants flourish through generations.
Summer brings joy—
may the master’s household produce a top scholar and a runner-up.
Autumn brings joy—
may the master rise to high office, praised by the emperor.
Winter brings joy—
may the master become the wealthiest household in the land.
Great fortune in opening!

**Seventeenth Section: Door Dimensions**
Upper-class doors: six *chi* six *cun* in height.
Middle-class doors: three *chi* three *cun*.
Lower-class doors: one *chi* one *cun*.

Provincial, county, temple, and monastery doors:
one *zhang* one *chi* eight *cun* in height.
Grand entrance doors: five *chi* seven *cun* high, four *chi* eight *cun* wide.
Residential doors: four *chi* seven *cun* high, two *chi* three *cun* wide.
Do not build an east-facing door in spring,
a south-facing door in summer,
a west-facing door in autumn,
or a north-facing door in winter.

The *Menglong Star*’s auspicious days are counted downward in large months,
upward in small months.
A white circle in the talisman is auspicious;
a *ren* (人) character depletes people,
a *liao* (了) character depletes livestock.

---
**Eighteenth Section: Auspicious Days for Door *Menglong Star* Construction**
Large months: the 1st, 2nd, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 24th, 25th, and 29th.
Small months: the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, and 29th.

---
**Nineteenth Section: Diagram of the Five-Beam House**
The five-beam structure, whether parallel or square, must avoid the *tanren* (反人遭踏) configuration,
where the *fudou* (袱斗) and *sangfan* (桑烦) disrupt the master’s dwelling.

---
**Twentieth Section: Five-Beam with Two Rear Beams**
A five-beam house extended with two rear beams
follows the ancient standard—
though moderns dismiss it lightly,
the uninitiated mock it as "hidden laughter,"
yet it is supremely auspicious.
If one constructs a true five-beam house with two rear beams,
this is its foundation.
The earth holds its own true patterns—
scholars must ponder these.

---
**Twenty-First Section: Standard Seven-Beam Structure**
The seven-beam house refers to the proper seven-beam design,
with single or parallel beams, *dou* and *sang* configurations,
or columns arranged by human craft.
Diagrams exist for proper construction.

---
**Twenty-Second Section: The Method of Raising the *Jiamafa* (架马) for New Construction**
When a new residence is built for the master,
fire must be avoided in the dwelling.
At the start of construction, the master sits upon the *jiamafa* (架马).
On an auspicious day for erecting beams,
this method applies universally.
For demolishing an old house and rebuilding,
the *jiamafa* is set up in reverse—
the master sits upon it to avoid fire in the dwelling.
Once construction begins, the *jiamafa* method is the same as for new builds.

**The *Jiamafa* Method for Repairs**
When repairing a house without avoiding fire in the dwelling,
the master selects an auspicious day to begin construction,
sitting upon the *jiamafa* without observing directional restrictions.
If columns are near empty space or within 100 *bu* of a *bing* direction,
the *jiamafa* talisman is raised on an auspicious day,
and construction proceeds accordingly.
Otherwise, a separate talisman is raised at the proper time,
ensuring no prohibitions arise.

---
**Twenty-Third Section: The Method of Raising Talismans for Construction**
If the master’s age aligns with their current *shichen* (行年),
they personally declare their name to the mountain spirits.
If the master’s age does not align,
the talisman is void, and a disciple who does may act as master,
declaring their name to the mountain and dragon gods.
The *deng* (磉) is then determined,
and the day for erecting columns avoids the master’s birth day
or days in conflict with their *mingguan* (命官).
Incense is moved according to the talisman,
which is then hung and sealed in the dwelling.

**When the Western Neighbor Builds**
If a neighbor constructs a house,
the master’s central hall is measured directly,
and the *shengge* (圣格) is applied.
If the neighbor’s construction falls under:
- the master’s *nianquanfu* (年官符),
- the *san sha* (三杀),
- a *duhuo yue* (独火月),
- non-official provincial or county talismans,
- or a *xiaogui* (小鬼) talisman,

the master must use the *fude* (富德) sitting talisman
to stabilize the ancestral spirits and fortune gods,
temporarily vacating the original boundary.
The talisman is then activated in the neighbor’s house,
transforming it into an auspicious structure.
After the month’s auspicious days pass,
the master’s original dwelling—previously free of *sha* (煞)—
must still honor the ancestral spirits and fortune gods,
thus ensuring the neighbor’s construction remains auspicious.
The measuring rope is hung on an auspicious day,
favoring *tian de* (天德) and *yue de* (月德),
preferably on the third *ji* (己) or *zi* (子) day of the month for great fortune.

The **Lúbān True Measure** (二十四 *Lúbān zhēnchǐ*)
—when the **Lúbān Measure** is the **curved measure** of one *chǐ* four *cùn* four *fēn*,
and within it there are eight *chǐ* one *cùn*,
this is because the curved measure harms the original [structure].

For those constructing doors,
following the **Measure’s Dao** (尺法),
if one uses a single-leaf door of lesser size,
opening one *chǐ* one *cùn* one *fēn*—
the **Lúbān Measure** is auspicious above—
a single-leaf door should open two *chǐ* eight *cùn*,
and the **Lúbān Measure** for auspiciousness above,
a double-leaf door should open three *chǐ* three *cùn* one *fēn*,
totaling six *yī* (六一).
The **Lúbān Measure** is the original door,
great auspiciousness above.
For those using the curved measure above,
four *chǐ* three *cùn* eight *fēn* totaling wealth-auspiciousness (财吉),
and for a double-leaf door,
five *chǐ* six *cùn* six *fēn* totaling *bǐng* (丙),
the **Lúbān Measure** is again auspicious above.

When the auspiciousness is aligned with the **Measure’s Dao** (吉上),
the artisan should open the door to four *chǐ* three *cùn*,
which becomes the **two-lǐ Measure** (二里般尺).
For the auspiciousness of five *chǐ* six *cùn*,
one must add two *fēn* and two *cùn* six *fēn* above,
and the central pillar (中柱) is the true auspiciousness.
All must follow the **Dao** (法) without fail,
a true master artisan.

**Wealth** (财)
—When the character *cái* (财) appears at the door,
one must carefully examine its placement.
The outer door welcomes guests—this is auspicious.
The *qí* (奎) of auspiciousness is within the central door,
and if accumulated, one must use the main door.
If the central room aligns with auspiciousness above,
hang white paper boxes, each containing money.

**Illness**
A true master artisan, if he can grasp this principle,
shall bring wealth and honor to his home.
When the character *bìng* (病) confronts the door,
the house is stricken by pestilence;
the outer door invites spirits and ghosts into the hall.
If this character appears at the door or outside the home,
illness shall forever plague the household.
Worse yet, if the outer door aligns with it,
in two years, the corpse shall be sent to the forest.
To avoid calamity, one must never adopt this—replace it with a new one.

**Separation (离)**
When the character *lí* (离) appears at the door, matters are unclear;
examine closely and see a desolate room.
If the *qí* (奎) aligns with the outer door, it becomes a corpse,
while the child faces south and the father north, each divided.
Daily quarrels fill the home,
misfortune and calamity become unbearable.

**Righteousness (义)**
When *yì* (义) or *zhōng* (忠) appears at the door,
it signifies filial piety and true virtue.
If the *qí* (奎) aligns with the outer door, it becomes a household,
and the veranda’s daughter-in-law brings laughter and joy.
Though the central room aligns with auspiciousness,
it may harm prosperity—one must guard against this.
If the eight *gāng* (罡) and ten *fēn* (分) bring no disaster,
the kitchen may suffer tenfold harm.

**Officialdom (官)**
When *guān* (官) appears at the door, it is auspicious.
Do not let it rest at the main gate.
Though the master’s affairs may visit the hall,
wealth and honor must be guarded in the courtyard.
A disciple shall become a noble child,
and an official’s son shall descend early.
This is comparable to the spaciousness of the *Guǎng* (广) house.

**Retreat (却)**
When *què* (却) appears at the door, it is not auspicious.
Daily affairs in the home become like tangled threads.
If the door aligns with harm, misfortune follows—
layer upon layer, inviting calamity one cannot bear.
Children and grandchildren shall retreat, facing hardship,
while the household endures four killings from the *Huáng* (皇).
Theft and misfortune shall plague others.

**Auspiciousness (吉)**
When *jí* (吉) appears at the door, it is most virtuous and loyal.
Within the courtyard stands a single noble son.
Husband and wife enjoy wealth and honor,
year after year, month after month, with smiles and laughter.
If the *cái* (财) door aligns with it,
the house shall prosper and flourish greatly.
Should the *qí* (奎) of harm align with one’s position,
even a good door may bring disaster.

---

**The Measure of the Carpenter’s Rule**
If one hundred *rú* (如) or six hundred *rú* (如) aligns with eight *bái* (白) and one *chì* (赤) for昌 (*chāng*),
it shall harmonize with the *bān* (班) and bring auspiciousness.
If reversed, auspiciousness shall diminish while harm increases—
the master’s misfortune shall follow.
The diagram of the Carpenter’s Rule:
One *bái* (白) as six,
Two *hēi* (黑), Three *bì* (碧), Four *lǜ* (绿),
Five *huáng* (黄), Six *bái* (白),
Seven *chì* (赤), Eight *bái* (白),
Nine *zǐ* (紫), Ten *bái* (白).

**(Twenty-Five) Treatise on the Roots of the Carpenter’s Rule**
The Carpenter’s Rule has graded measurements:
One *chǐ* (尺) is ten *fēn* (分).
In all construction and planning,
when opening a door, its height, length, size, and measure—
all must be adjusted to fit.
The *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule of eight *chǐ* (尺) and ten *fēn* (分) determines auspiciousness and harm.
The *dù* (度) and *dào* (道) of auspiciousness and harm are daily matters,
for a true master artisan.
But if this method is followed, great auspiciousness and fortune shall prevail.

To harmonize the *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule with the Carpenter’s Rule,
the upper and lower alignments must match.
This is the best method for a skilled artisan to build a residence,
auspicious in its year,
facing the green sky—great fortune and auspiciousness shall follow.
According to the *Jiǔ Tiān Xuán Nǚ* (九天玄女) method of door placement,
the *Xuán Nǚ* (玄女) adjusts the measurements,
each *chǐ* (尺) yielding only nine *cùn* (寸),
with the remainder discarded.

**(Twenty-Six) Treatise on Wealth, Illness, Separation, Officialdom, Retreat, and Auspiciousness**
If the measurements of a house are uneven—
its length and width, height and depth—
and the main door connects with the *cái* (财) door,
it shall bring the greatest auspiciousness.
Also, when placing doors for temples or schools,
the *guān* (官) door may be installed.
Connect the main door with the *cái* (财) door for great fortune.
Most measurement methods follow the artisan’s traditions of woodwork.
One must rely on the *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule for construction and planning.

**Treatise on Door Opening Steps**
The number of steps in opening a door should be single, not double.
One step, three steps, five steps, seven steps, nine steps, or eleven steps—
these bring great auspiciousness.
Others bring harm.
Each step is measured as four *chǐ* (尺) and five *cùn* (寸),
beginning from where the eaves’ water drips,
and extending to the main door.
If the *cái* (财) door aligns with a single step,
and the main door harmonizes with *yì* (义), *guān* (官), or *bēn* (本),
then it shall be auspicious.
Each follows the artisan’s traditions;
construction must align with the *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule for the best.

**(Twenty-Seven) Three-Bay House with Three-Bay Rule**
The builder of this house must never make it too tall.
Each column’s height should be no more than one *zhàng* (丈) and one *cùn* (寸).
The beams above the columns should reach one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and one *cùn* (寸).
The depth of each segment should be five *chǐ* (尺) and six *cùn* (寸),
the width one *zhàng* (丈) and one *chǐ* (尺).
The secondary bay should measure one *zhàng* (丈) and one *cùn* (寸).
This method is balanced and correct.

**Commentary:**
When constructing a three-bay house,
all measurements must follow the auspicious alignment above.
Width, height, and depth—
if done according to the Rule,
the descendants shall produce noble offspring.

**(Twenty-Eight) Five-Bay House Rule**
A five-bay, three-room house with the three-bay rule:
one column’s height should be one *zhàng* (丈) and eight *cùn* (寸),
extended to one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and one *cùn* (寸).
The foundation’s width and narrowness
should be adjusted by the artisan’s discretion.

**Poem:**
Three doors, five-bay house,
if too large, measure carefully.
Follow the *Lǔ* (鲁) Rule’s true measurements,
align the columns properly—
then wealth and auspiciousness shall come,
and horizontal fortune shall multiply.

**(Twenty-Nine) Standard Seven-Bay, Three-Room House Rule**
A seven-bay hall is grand and tall.
When constructing this house,
the front and rear columns should reach one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and six *cùn* (寸),
the beams one *zhàng* (丈) and six *cùn* (寸),
and the segment length four *chǐ* (尺) and eight *cùn* (寸).
The foundation’s width and depth,
as well as the height and narrowness,
should be adjusted according to the artisan’s and the owner’s intentions.
Additions or subtractions may be made as needed.

**Commentary:**
When constructing this noble hall,
it depends entirely on the craftsman’s and the master’s foresight.
Wealth and honor derive from the proper use of the measuring line,
but one must also align with *yīnyáng* (阴阳).

**(Thirty) Standard Five-Room, Nine-Bay Hall Rule**
When constructing this hall,
each column’s height should be one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and six *cùn* (寸).
The beams or foundation’s width should be one *zhàng* (丈) and four *chǐ* (尺) and eight *cùn* (寸),
the depth four *chǐ* (尺) and three *cùn* (寸), or ten *fēn* (分).
The height should be two *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺),
and the beams shall balance it correctly.

**Commentary:**
The two characters *yīnyáng* must be considered first.
Mountains should face inward, waters flow outward—align the orientation properly.
For halls of nine or five bays,
a thousand years of unbroken fortune are assured,
all thanks to the Master’s true measuring line,
which ensures wealth—fields of a thousand *mǔ* and boundless prosperity.

**(Thirty-One) Constructing Gate Towers and Newly Built Dwellings—Opening Doors Properly**
When building a gate tower or new residence,
enter through the main gate first,
then establish a secondary gate to the east for the auspicious entrance.
If the house is narrow or winding,
avoid having a small *bǐngmén* (丙门) gate—
instead, make it no smaller than the outer gate,
following proper construction methods.
Above all, a family’s main gate must never be squeezed by neighboring structures.

**Unfavorable Directions for Doors:**
Horizontally aligned openings face the following *xīnggān* (赤口) days:
1st day of the month (辰), 2nd (卯), 3rd (寅), 4th (丑), 5th (戌), 6th (亥), 7th (戊), 9th (子), 10th (赤).
Additionally, avoid opening doors on the 12th day of a *zhōngwǔ* (仲冬) year of the Horse.

**(Thirty-Two) Concealing One’s Position—Hiding the Body**
Place three copper coins in purity,
facing the correct cardinal direction.
At sunrise, mark one *yīn* (阴) point on the mountain.
The Master commands me to hide my body:
Store the three *hún* (魂) within the Azure Clouds,
the seven *pò* (魄) in the Nine-Heaven Clouds.
My disciple’s true hiding place lies within the Iron Ox’s liver.
I solemnly invoke the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper,
the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper—
*urgent, as by decree.*

I pay homage to:
Lord Lu Ban, the Enlightened Master,
General Zhang the Skilled,
Master Zhao the Artisan,
the Seventy-Two Ancestral Masters,
all past and present teachers and grandmasters,
those who transmit this orally.

Here I take my position.
Though incense burns late and water is not changed,
all sins—ten thousand offenses—are pardoned.
I await the household’s completion of this noble dwelling.
When the work is done, I present it to the Sacred Lord.

**The Four-Directional Cleansing (扫四平):**
A knife’s tip holds pure wine,
a rooster’s blood, a square of white cloth,
inscribed with the *Jīnguāng* (金光) Order.
I summon the most potent local deity,
who traverses heaven and earth, enters and exits the underworld,
and relays my words—
not to linger, but to depart swiftly.
On the day of merit,
I shall record this in writing.
Adorned in crimson, wielding twin daggers,
moving like lightning, vanishing like clouds,
I ride forward to invite:
Lord Lu Ban, the Enlightened Master of Hongzhou,
venerable by all faithful,
whose incense unites the Three Teachings.
The Five Sacred Characters—*Tiāndì-Jūnqīnshī* (天地君親師)—
are omnipotent.
With reverence, I beseech:
The Great Sage Confucius, Master of the *Dàchéng* (大成),
his Three Thousand Disciples,
the Seventy-Two Worthies,
the Imperial Scholar of the Osmanthus Garden,
the Celestial Official of Longevity and Lineage,
the Child-Sending Immortal,
the Homeless Buddha of the Southern Sea,
the Cow King of the Palace,
the Merciful Ancient Buddha Who Covers the Sky,
the Venerable Guan the God of War,
the Northern Pacifier, True Martial Ancestor,
who grants wealth upon invocation,
Generals Zhao, Luo, and Meng Kang,
the Kitchen Commander,
the Kitchen God,
the Central Palace Land Deity,
the Residence Dragon Spirit,
the Twin Gate Gods—
all are revered by me.

Past and present masters, grandmasters, and ancestors,
descend now to the incense altar,
receive my command, and accept sacrifice.
I perform the Four-Directional Cleansing,
seal the Dragon’s Mouth.
A square of white cloth, pure as silver—
Master, take this to sweep:
Above, the *tiānshà* (天煞) return to heaven,
below, the *dìyā* (地压) descend to the underworld,
the *tiānyā* (天压) ascend to heaven,
the *dìyā* (地压) sink to dust,
and all *rényā* (人压) or *guǐyā* (鬼压) retreat swiftly.
Should any malevolent spirits press forward,
one sweep reduces them to ash.
I invoke the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper,
the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper—
*urgent, as by decree.*

Before the assembled saints, I pour three libations of wine,
tear the paper money in my hands—
a handful of white, which the Master sweeps directly into the Nine-Heaven Clouds,
sealing the Dragon’s Mouth.
The sacrifice is complete.

I present to the household:
Tonight, wine and meat to seal the Dragon’s Mouth,
so the master may never lack sustenance.
The Master’s wealth seals the Dragon’s Mouth,
so the master accumulates gold like the Northern Dipper.
Before the saints, I pour three libations,
speaking auspicious words to the master.

The Master grants you:
Two *píniú* (皮牛) for prosperity—
your descendants shall become governors.
Two *píniú* bring wealth beyond measure—
gold and silver in endless abundance.
Two *píniú* ensure your lineage holds noble titles.
A single chest fills with gold and silver.

**Concealment Talisman—Recitation of the Purification and *Jīnguāng* (金光) Incantation**

**(Thirty-Three) The *Jīnguāng* (金光) Incantation:**
From the Primordial Void of Heaven and Earth,
the Original *Qi* of Ten Thousand Things,
broadly cultivating the *yìjié* (意劫) age,
realizing my divine power—
within the Three Realms, none surpass the Dao.
My body shines with golden light,
invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear,
encompassing heaven and earth,
nourishing all living beings.
Recite this poem ten thousand times,
and golden light shall envelop you.
The Three Realms’ guardians shall attend,
the Emperor of Dao shall welcome me,
all spirits shall pay homage,
commanding thunder and lightning at my will.
Demons and spirits shall tremble in fear,
evil *jīngguài* (精怪) shall flee.
Within, thunder crashes,
the Thunder God’s light flickers,
tears and dew mingle,
the Five *Qi* surge upward—
golden light manifests swiftly,
shielding the true script—
*urgent, as by decree.*

**On Hanging the Plumb Line, Preparing Foundations, and Raising Beams**

When marking the plumb line and preparing the foundation, first split the pillars—prioritize the **White Star** (白星), adhering to the **Three Whites and Nine Purples** (三白九紫) for the craftsman’s greatest fortune. First determine the auspicious **White Days** (白日) and hours, then measure the precise dimensions.
