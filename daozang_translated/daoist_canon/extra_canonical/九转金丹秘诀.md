# 九转金丹秘诀

The Master of the Muddy Pellet, Chen Pu, transmits the *Nine Cycles of the Golden Elixir Secret Formula*:

First Cycle: Descending Elixir
Second Cycle: Union
Third Cycle: Nurturing Yang
Fourth Cycle: Nurturing Yin
Fifth Cycle: Bone Transformation
Sixth Cycle: Flesh Transformation
Seventh Cycle: Transformation of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels
Eighth Cycle: Cultivating Fire
Ninth Cycle: Ascension

**First Cycle**
Beneath the tongue lie four apertures—two connect to the heart, two to the fluids.
The work of the first cycle resembles a precious pearl,
Pervading the mountains, rivers, and cosmos with a numinous body.
Beneath the red lotus leaf lies the elixir cave;
Crimson water flows, nourishing the nine-pulse pearl.

*Explanation:*
The work of the inner elixir begins with the one and is completed in the nine.
The one is that from which the myriad things are born.
Heaven-one generates water, Earth-two generates fire,
Heaven-three generates wood, Earth-four generates metal,
Heaven-five generates earth—the sequence of the Five Phases begins with the one.
Thus, the work of the inner elixir also begins with the one,
And through transformation is completed in the nine, for nine is the utmost of yang numbers.
When the number reaches nine, the Dao-fruit is achieved.
The "precious pearl" refers to the true water of Heaven-one stored in the gallbladder,
Where yin and yang harmonize and descend to form the elixir.
The initial descent resembles a single dewdrop of luminous pearl.
The pearl signifies reverence for the elixir.
Moreover, the human body is formed through the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood—this is the union of form.
The descent of the elixir is achieved through the union of heart-fire and kidney-water—this is the union of qi.
Thus it is said: union of form gives birth to humans; union of qi completes the elixir.
After the elixir descends, the spirit roams beyond the mundane,
Yin and yang attain great harmony;
One forgets the body in stillness, and the mountains, rivers, heaven, and earth—
The six directions and the myriad things—all reside within this body.
This body exists beyond heaven, earth, and the myriad things,
Perceiving only a single point of radiance within the heart—
This is the descent of the elixir.
Thus it is said: the mountains, rivers, and cosmos permeate the numinous body.
The "body" here refers to the self.
The mountains and rivers are contained within this body.

The "red lotus" refers to the tongue.
The two apertures connect to the heart, the other two to the fluids.
When a person is ill, the tongue’s fluids dry and true qi dissipates.
At the outset of the first cycle, the tongue seals these two apertures,
Preventing the leakage of true qi and facilitating the flow of divine water.
The "crimson water" refers to the heart’s fluids.
At the beginning of each of the nine cycles, on the ninth day, one inhales nine times,
Each inhalation consisting of nine breaths.
Naturally, the fluids flow from beneath the tongue,
Nourishing the five viscera—hence the "nine-pulse pearl."

*To the tune of "Gazing at the Southern River"*
Seal the tongue’s artful skill, connect the gallbladder’s qi.
The yellow treasure must be sought within the gallbladder.
The spring wind quickens the myriad things,
Heaven and earth lie beneath my knees, my peers in the Dao,
As the hundred vessels flow freely.
Enacting creation, the left and right fires are drawn forth.
Vast and boundless, they illuminate the cosmos;
The bitter smoke ascends, veiling the encircling towers,
As husband and wife gradually conspire.

*Explanation:*
Heaven-one generates qi, called the Central Yellow.
This qi is stored in the gallbladder as the root of life and destiny, its flavor bitter.
Thus, the gallbladder’s qi and flavor are also bitter.
Like the roots of plants and trees, which bear bitter blossoms,
We know that without generative qi, the myriad things cannot come to life.
The medicine of the inner elixir first seals the apertures beneath the tongue,
Internally connecting the gallbladder’s generative qi to the throat and tongue,
Where a faint bitter taste is perceived—this is the flow of elixir qi.
Thereafter, mercury and water congeal to form the elixir.
The generative qi of heaven and earth sprouts in spring;
The myriad things receive this generative qi before they can live.
Humans, too, receive generative qi, stored in the gallbladder.
By connecting the gallbladder’s qi, the inner elixir completes the first cycle’s work,
Like the spring of the four seasons.
As the generative qi ascends, a bitter sensation arises,
Yin and yang attain great harmony, and the spirit dwells beyond heaven—
Then the four seas and the cosmos lie beneath one’s knees.
A vast qi fills heaven and earth, the hundred vessels flow freely, and the myriad apertures open.
This is the descent of the inner elixir.
"Enacting creation" refers to the initial steps.
First, seal the two apertures beneath the tongue to prevent qi from leaking outward.
The qi on the left passes through the left Greater Yang into the brain,
While the qi on the right passes through the right Greater Yin into the brain,
Both converging in the brain before entering the Muddy Pellet Palace atop the head,
Descending through the twelve-storied tower of the throat,
Entering the heart meridian, and transmitting to the elixir center to open the gallbladder’s aperture.
This allows the gallbladder’s generative qi to ascend along the heart and gallbladder meridians,
Passing through the tongue’s apertures, where a bitter taste is perceived—
This is the generative qi preparing to descend the elixir.
Then, sealing the tongue’s apertures, the qi on both sides ascends,
Creating a surging sensation.
When the gallbladder’s aperture is sealed, the generative qi rises gently,
Ascending the twelve-storied tower of the throat from the tongue’s apertures,
Filling the mouth with a bitter taste—this is the flow of generative qi.
"Husband and wife" refer to yin and yang:
The husband is yang, the wife is yin.
When generative qi flows freely, yin and yang attain great harmony,
And heart and kidney unite—hence "gradually conspire."

*Oral Instructions:*
At the outset of practice, first harmonize the five viscera with diet—
Neither hunger nor satiety, the heart-field calm and free of worries—
Only then can one enter the Dao.
At the end of the second watch and the beginning of the third,
Wash and rinse, settle the spirit, and enter the chamber.
Burn incense, sit cross-legged, close the eyes, and concentrate the spirit.
Wait until the breath is even, then curl the tongue backward to seal its root and the two apertures, holding the breath.
Gradually, two streams of qi from the left and right Greater Yang meridians rise from the jaw’s root,
Passing through the two Greater Yang points before entering the crown of the head,
Where the two qi converge and coalesce.
Close the eyes for a long while, then curl the tongue as before,
Waiting until the qi reaches the Muddy Pellet Palace before stopping.
Practice this three times each night.
After several nights or days, the qi will gradually flow from the Muddy Pellet Palace into the brain,
Descending the twelve-storied tower of the throat,
Piercing the spine and threading the tailbone,
Then rising to the heart and penetrating the gallbladder,
Warming the navel and chest with a gentle, harmonious sensation—
This is the true descent.

After this, over several nights, you will gradually feel the qi reach the heart, then sense a gentle warmth or the heart’s qi beginning to stir. A warm qi will rise from the heart, passing through the twelve-storied tower of the throat, where a slight bitterness may be perceived. This is the Central Yellow qi emerging from the gallbladder, signifying the great harmony of yin and yang and the imminent descent of the elixir.

Following this, at the start of each night’s practice, have someone stand guard outside the door to prevent anyone from entering, or cats and dogs from startling you. After practicing two or three times each night, place a small table before you as you sit. Suddenly, the qi will surge, and you will feel your body gradually expand, your spirit soaring. Gradually, the house, people, mountains, and rivers will all appear within your body. Your hands and feet will seem to vanish. Quickly press your hands upon the table, close your eyes, and in a profound state of awareness, you will perceive a luminous orb at your heart, round as the sun. Suddenly, it will descend into the elixir field—this is the descent of the elixir.

After the elixir descends, do not open your eyes immediately. Gradually gather your spirit and settle it. Your limbs will return to their usual state, though they may feel numb or tingling. Wait until you are fully composed before opening your eyes, then drink ginseng broth and sleep. The next morning, take congee to nourish yourself for one or two days. This is the descent of the elixir. Once the elixir has descended, all illnesses will vanish, and no suffering or affliction will remain.

**Second Cycle**
The second cycle begins as yang completes and yin coalesces,
The radiance of the kidneys and the fluid of the heart unite in ding and ren.
The divine pearl, swift as lightning, returns to the Eastern Sea,
Its sacred light bursting forth to illuminate purple gold.

Explanation:
At the start of the second cycle, it is like a woman two months with child—the initial descent of the embryo is the essence of true yang. The spirit is the elixir heart, belonging to fire and categorized as yin, pairing with the southern ding fire. Ding is the yin of fire. The kidneys belong to water and are categorized as yang, pairing with the northern ren water. Ren is the yang of water.

Lü says:
Fire is drawn from the marrow of the cinnabar phoenix of the south,
Water is sought from the essence of the black turtle of the north.
Thus, in the second cycle, yang is nurtured, allowing the radiance of the heart’s fire to stir below. In the third cycle, yin is nurtured, allowing the fluid of the kidney’s water to unite above. True water and true fire ascend and descend in harmony, with ding and ren embracing and nurturing the true elixir to complete the transformation.

When the elixir first descends, it is nurtured in the heart, cultivated by true fire to quicken its growth. Once the first cycle is complete, the elixir flows down from the heart’s network and is stored in the elixir field, nurtured by true water—this is the work of the second cycle. After the elixir is stored in the elixir field, sit quietly in an empty room. Suddenly, a radiance will appear, illuminating the womb like a golden orb—this is the light of the moon.

*To the tune of "Gazing at the Jiangnan"*
The mysterious pearl descends,
The elixir chamber lies within the Central Palace.

Nine breaths harmonize the ninefold count,
Crimson waves surge forth in the east of the Great Yang—
Heart and kidney then commune as one.
At sixfold change, six breaths nurture yin’s work.

Fire from the Sea Gate ascends to the Emperor’s Seat,
Water from the lotus calyx aids Ding Gong—
Violet lightning pierces the translucent.

*Explanation:*
The mysterious pearl is the true elixir. At the first turning’s outset, the elixir descends into the heart’s network, thus it is said the elixir chamber lies within the Central Palace—this descent marks the first turning. After the elixir descends, whenever the ninth day arrives, hold the breath for nine breaths as one cycle, reaching nine nines—eighty-one—to complete nine cycles. Hence it is called the ninefold count. When the nine nines’ work is accomplished, true yang’s elixir is full, flowing from the heart’s network into the elixir field, where the elixir is stored in the Water Palace to nurture its yin. The east of the Great Yang symbolizes the Water Palace of the elixir field, the kidney’s water. The elixir’s spirit is stored in the heart to nurture true fire; when the elixir turns and returns to the kidney, it next nurtures true water. With water and fire in harmony, yin and yang unite in great balance—thus it is said heart and kidney commune. When the second turning’s work is complete, it marks the beginning of the third turning. At sixfold encounters, hold the breath, six breaths as one cycle, six sixes—thirty-six—as one round to nurture yin—hence it is called the sixfold breath. The yin work’s Sea Gate is the kidney’s palace of the elixir field. When the true elixir is stored in the elixir field, the count of the elixir’s yang is fulfilled. Each time noon arrives, the spirit from the elixir field, borne by hot qi, ascends to the heart—this is the Emperor’s Seat. The lotus calyx is the tongue; when the inner yin’s count of six sixes is fulfilled, the divine water of the lower Lotus Pool irrigates the heart’s network to nurture the elixir’s qi—thus it is said to aid Ding Gong. Ding is the heart’s fire. Here, true water and true fire accomplish the work of harmony. When yin and yang are in harmony and the true elixir’s qi is full, a divine radiance appears upon the face and eyes. At midnight, sitting in stillness and inwardly observing the viscera, inside and out are clearly seen, the mysterious pearl directly perceived, nurtured within the elixir field—thus it is said to pierce the translucent.

*Oral Instructions:*
After the elixir descends and the first turning is complete, whenever the ninth, nineteenth, or twenty-ninth day arrives, at noon sit quietly in an empty room. Cross the legs, close the eyes, sit upright, and click the teeth nine times. Spirit and qi commune, then hold the breath—each holding counts nine breaths as one cycle. Open the eyes for a long while, then hold the breath again, as before, nine breaths as one cycle. At the first holding, one or two cycles may bring warmth; by the fifth cycle, extreme heat arises. Proceeding to nine cycles, continue until the inner fire’s timing is fulfilled, resonating with heaven and earth, regardless of distance. If, upon entering the ninth breath, warmth stirs in the heart, the four spirits harmonize and flourish, the heart’s spirit stirs, and a stream of hot qi descends to the elixir field—this marks the completion of the second turning. Thereafter, the count of nine breaths is no longer practiced. The third turning...

The third turning conducts yang into the left palace, where the Mystic Pearl’s fetal hue gradually brightens to crimson. The numinous fire nurtures and divides its forms, while the celestial pipes hasten the work of creation.

Explanation: Upon the completion of the third turning of the elixir, when heaven’s course enters yin, one cultivates the qi of true yin. Once the inner yin’s count is fulfilled, the elixir enters the cinnabar field and flows to the left flank, causing the four limbs to stream with sweat to subdue the corpse-qi. With the third turning accomplished, the three corpse-spirits are no more. The Numinous Pearl is the inner elixir. Thereafter, yang qi abounds, and even urine, mucus, and saliva all assume a pink hue, corresponding to the quality of pure yang. When the elixir’s radiance reveals a luminous pearl—like a wheel of fire—beneath the left flank, the count of the third turning is complete. At each month’s end, stroke the crown with the left hand, draw in breath to stir the elixir-fire until the five viscera grow warm—this is called nurturing the fire to circulate the elixir. From this point, one gradually senses a presence in the cinnabar field; with each inhalation, the elixir stirs, hence the phrase “dividing its forms.” When heaven and earth harmonize, their resonance produces sound—this is the celestial pipes. Before the third turning, the nine orifices are closed and their sounds unheard; after the third turning, the nine orifices become keenly attuned to the celestial pipes’ music, heard day and night without cease.

*To the Tune of "Wàng Jiāngnán"*
The hair grows fine,
as the third turning moves yang.

The fetal hue gradually reddens as yin recedes,
shifting through the years’ cycles to aid yang’s firmness—
nurturing fire to foster the central palace.
The formed image appears,
and at the fifth turning, one discerns the subtle and vast.

Its ingress and egress remain slow, its form still small;
at dawn and dusk, one drinks the jade flask’s nectar,
while celestial pipes play the sheng and huang.

*Explanation:*
When the third turning completes its yang count,
the yin tortoise gradually contracts,
and the intestines and stomach gradually open like an umbrella.
Within a month, there are ten movements of both bowels,
gradually entering earth’s position,
nearing the attainment of the Dao of no leakage.
Qian hexagram is all yang, symbolizing pure yang.

Stroking the crown while drawing in breath,
one inwardly nurtures the fire,
the elixir embracing the sacred embryo,
nearing the formation of its image.
The five peaks are not yet complete,
and at the eighth turning, its form stirs—
like a small child of three or four inches.
The vision of it is not yet distinct,
for yang qi is now full but has not yet nurtured yin.
The sacred embryo possesses a hun-soul
but has not yet acquired a po-soul.
Thus its ingress and egress remain slow,
and its form still small.

When the sacred embryo takes shape,
between sittings and breaths,
one constantly sees its countenance radiant with light.
The sweet dew of the bubbling spring flows forth to drink.
The seven orifices grow keen,
and one hears the music of immortals.

*Oral Instructions:*
After the elixir enters the left flank
and the work of the third turning is complete,
on the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month—
the three sixes—
at midnight, the hour of *zi*,
wash and rinse, then enter a pure chamber.
Sit upright with legs crossed,
knock the teeth thirty-six times,
gather the spirit and settle the qi,
close the mouth and draw in breath six times as one cycle.
Repeat this six times to complete the practice.

On the third and sixth days of the month,
perform this three times in the month,
fulfilling the count by the month’s end.
At midnight, the hour of *zi*,
sit in the pure chamber as before,
eyes closed, legs crossed.
First, use the left hand to stroke the crown,
and the right hand to stroke the tailbone at the spine’s end,
turning with the moon for forty-nine cycles.
While stroking, hold the breath firmly until the count is complete,
then rest briefly to settle the qi.
Repeat this three times,
until one feels the qi of heart and kidney
meet at the central diaphragm,
gently stirring the elixir-qi,
filling the five viscera.
When the five viscera grow as hot as fire,
it is the time to circulate the fire.

At times on the three sixes or the month’s end,
one may suddenly feel the elixir beneath the left flank stir,
with a thread of hot qi passing through the cinnabar field
straight into the flank,
its heat like fire,
shaking for a long while before settling—
this completes the work of the fourth turning.
From this point, one no longer practices the count of the heavy heaven.

**Fourth Turning**
Closing the yang gate’s qi,
the nose as heaven’s orifice, the mouth as earth’s orifice.

At the fourth turning, yin moves into the right pass,
the sacred embryo’s numinous work brightens the crimson countenance.
A halo of light fills the chamber, the spirit unobstructed—
drums and music play as one roams and returns.

*Explanation:*
The left pertains to yang, the right to yin.
After the fourth turning, the inner elixir resides on the right,
corresponding to the count of inner yin.
From this point, inner yin and yang are both full.
The third turning nurtures yang,
and the sacred embryo generates its hun-soul.
The fourth turning nurtures yin,
and the sacred embryo generates its po-soul.
At the elixir’s fourth turning,
the sacred embryo within possesses both hun and po.
Its five peaks and spirit
mirror one’s inner visage—
this is the true body of spirit departure.

After the fourth turning,
with yin and yang qi full,
sitting upright and holding the breath,
the inner spirit-light emerges from the crown.
Like a bright moon encircling the body,
the spirit roams beyond the mundane,
ingress and egress unobstructed.
Sitting in the chamber, one sees the four seas
and knows fortune and misfortune.

*To the Tune of "Wàng Jiāngnán"*
The elixir has returned,
at the fourth turning, yin moves.
On the sixth, close and store the yang gate’s qi,
the three passes fully open, merging *ding* and *ren*—
the tortoise roams, freely rising and sinking.

At times it emerges,
unobstructed, piercing others’ hearts.
Playfully, the spirit-sage often appears,
a halo of light encircling a thousand *xun*,
neither cold nor heat assailing.

*Explanation:*
The fourth turning nurtures inner yin,
the elixir concealed in the right flank.
The nose is heaven’s orifice, the mouth earth’s orifice.
Qi exhaled through the nose pertains to yang,
qi exhaled through the mouth pertains to yin.
On the nights of the three sixes,
close the nose’s breath,
cutting off its coming and going.
Yang qi descends inwardly,
filling the five viscera—
this is using yang to nurture yin.
Closing the nose’s orifice,
the flower pool’s waters brim,
flowing down to moisten the heart’s network.
Water and fire inwardly merge,
heart qi descends,
kidney qi ascends,
*ding* and *ren* unite,
and the sacred embryo’s yin and yang counts are full.
The elixir in the right flank
rises and falls with the qi,
like a tortoise in water,
freely rising and sinking.
The inner elixir’s light
envelops my body,
its form like the moon,
neither cold nor heat assailing.
My heart connects with others’ hearts,
discerning good and evil.
The infant emerges and enters,
playfully roaming the four seas—
one’s name is recorded in the immortal registers.

*Oral Instructions:*
For the nose’s orifice and mouth’s orifice,
after the elixir enters the right flank
and the work of the fourth turning is complete,
on the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month,
at midnight, the hour of *zi*,
wash and rinse, then enter a quiet chamber.
Sit with eyes closed and legs crossed,
knock the teeth thirty-six times,
gather the spirit and settle the qi,
close the nose’s breath, utterly still,
waiting for the true qi.
When the inner cinnabar field’s qi pierces the tongue’s orifice,
the flower pool’s fluids well up, filling the mouth,
nearly overflowing—
then gently swallow them, guiding them to the heart.
When the spirit-water reaches the heart,
it stirs the spirit-fire,
the five viscera grow warm,
sweat bathes the body,
and the four limbs feel refreshed—
this is one cycle.
On the nights of the three origins,
perform this three times and stop.
This is the spirit-water and spirit-fire
embracing and nurturing the original essence.

After this nurturing,
when circulating the three passes,
the inner elixir from the flank
rumbles like thunder.
A thread of hot qi enters the cinnabar field,
firelight shoots from the nose—
thus the inner elixir returns to the cinnabar field,
completing the fifth turning.
From this point, one no longer practices the method of closing the yang gate.

**Fifth Turning**
At the fifth turning, yin and yang complete their transformations,
the infant, a foot in length, plays with yang’s essence.

When asleep, one roams the four seas; when awake, one knows their place—
coming and going without effort, walking at will as one pleases.

**Explanation:**
At the fourth turning, one nurtures the inner yin;
at the third turning, one nurtures the inner yang;
at the fifth turning, both inner and outer,
yin and yang reach their full measure.
The work of transformation is complete,
the sacred embryo’s spiritual powers now unrestrained—
thus it is said, "the transformations are complete."
After the fifth turning, the inner elixir’s sacred embryo is fully nurtured,
the numinous body grows to over a foot in length.
From this point, one absorbs the essence of the sun
to nourish the outer yang,
seizing the transformative power of Heaven and Earth.

Ordinary people, having nothing within to nurture,
let their spirit scatter without return.
By day, their spirit dwells in the heart;
by night, it leaves the body.
When sleep overtakes them, the spirit has no swift guard—
they know neither body nor place,
drifting with hun and po,
entering the dark realms,
gathering with ghosts.
In dreams, they witness the decay of the four great elements,
their spirit following ghosts,
receiving rebirth in heaven or hell according to karma—
all beyond their control,
their spirit unaware of its form,
adrift on the waves.

The perfected one who attains the Dao,
having completed the inner elixir,
unites spirit with body,
unmoved by external things.
Thus hun and po lie hidden,
no evil can intrude,
no cares remain,
liberation from life and death lies within their grasp.
Exiting and entering spirit, unfathomable in movement—
hence the alchemical ode says:
*"The true person has no dreams."*
This is its meaning.

The perfected one who attains the Dao—
their spirit knows no stagnation,
their hun abides within,
walking at will without hindrance.

*Gazing at the River South*
The pearl from the right,
a purple lightning enters the cinnabar city.

Within, the infant is nurtured into a crimson elephant,
timely encountering the five revolutions to gather yang essence—
fire arises from water.
Burning the demonic peaks,
purple lightning surges, towering and majestic.
Roaming at will through the vast seas,
sleeping like a long whale resting on sandy shoals,
moving in harmony with the seasons.

*Explanation:*
When the five revolutions are complete and the numbers of yin and yang are fulfilled, the inner elixir’s mysterious pearl suddenly emits a streak of true fire from the right flank into the cinnabar field. Its sound is like thunder, its light like flame—this is the inner yin and yang of the elixir pearl returning to the cinnabar field to fulfill the five revolutions. Within the sacred embryo, the perfected one is accomplished, emerging and entering through the crown gate, over a foot in length. The third revolution nurtures yang, the fourth nurtures yin, and the inner yin and yang are both fulfilled. When the cinnabar field completes the five revolutions, it seizes the creative power of heaven and earth. Gathering the essence of the sun forms the path of external yang cultivation. From inner to outer, the sequence is orderly. Thus, after the five revolutions, within a month, on the days of the three nines, one gathers the essence of the sun and moon to nurture the sacred embryo. The method of practice is to seek fire through water, seek yang through yin—when water and fire are in harmony, yin and yang achieve great balance. Hence it is said: *fire arises from water.* Ordinary people accumulate yin qi below the cinnabar field, calling it the demonic peaks. When the body becomes purely yang, the yin mountains and demonic peaks are incinerated, and the yang palace and divine court are established. Master Lü said: *"The burning mountain talisman—demons dare not gaze."* This is its meaning. Roaming the four seas at will, coming and going as one desires. In sleep, one recognizes the body; upon waking, the spirit moves outward, and the body perceives its original form, like a long whale resting on sandy shoals. After the five revolutions, the work of creation is complete. In virtue, one joins with heaven and earth; in brightness, one joins with the sun and moon. The inner elixir’s creation moves in step with time.

*Oral Instructions:*
When the inner elixir returns to the cinnabar field and the five revolutions are accomplished, the numbers of inner yin and yang are fulfilled. One then gathers the outer yin and yang to complete the great Dao. On the ninth, nineteenth, and twenty-ninth days of each month—the days of the three nines—at high noon, face south, sit cross-legged with eyes closed, and sit facing the sun. Wait until the qi settles and the breath ceases, allowing no movement of qi, so that true yang is not leaked and fills the interior, and the inner true fire communicates. One will feel the entire body suffused with redness, light filling the room. After a moment or two, a stream of true water from the cinnabar field—a cold qi—rises straight to the heart, like a crystal pearl floating above it. Then, closing the eyes and opening the breath, inhale through the nose, drawing in eighty-one breaths, and gather them into the heart. Once the sunlight reaches the heart, one gradually feels the qi stirring at the heart’s center, leaping in the cinnabar field like a fish—this is the great harmony of yin and yang. Stop at eighty-one breaths. Practice this for three years to complete the work. After three years, one no longer gathers the sun’s essence but instead gathers the moon’s radiance.

*Sixth Revolution:*
The sun has five colors over three years,
the moon has nine rays over one year.
In the sixth revolution, the cinnabar field plays with the moon’s radiance,
transforming the embryo, the hun and po’s shadows stealthily recede.
Yang cinnabar replaces the bones, yin dissolves the flesh—
exchanging all for true suchness, flawless as jade.

*Explanation:*
When the elixir reaches the sixth revolution, inner and outer yin and yang are both complete. The sacred embryo is fully formed, and the perfected one becomes one with the inner body. On nights when the moon is full, one gathers the moon’s radiance to accumulate yin—hence it is called *playing with the moon’s radiance.* In the fifth revolution, true yang is complete, and the hun transforms into spirit. In the sixth revolution, true yin is complete, and the po transforms into qi. The hun and po, inner and outer, roam freely in daylight, leaving no shadow, becoming one with the sun’s pure yang. From this point on, ghosts and spirits cannot be seen, yin and yang cannot be fathomed—thus the path of the true immortal is achieved. Hence it is said: *the shadows stealthily recede.* The ordinary person’s impure bones and turbid body, with unclean yin and yang, cannot ascend to attain the Dao. After the perfected one’s elixir is formed in the fourth revolution, by the fifth revolution, one gathers the sun’s essence, congealing it in the cinnabar field to form yang cinnabar. The cinnabar enters the bone marrow, dissolving with sweat—hence it is said: *yang cinnabar replaces the bones.* After the bone replacement, in the sixth revolution, one gathers the moon’s radiance, congealing it in the cinnabar field to form yin powder. After a year of gathering the moon’s radiance, the yin powder transforms internally to nurture the immortal’s flesh. One will notice blood often appearing in the urine—this is the yin dissolving the ordinary flesh, while the immortal’s flesh naturally grows. Hence it is said: *yin dissolves the flesh.* Jade with flaws is not true jade; a person with an ordinary body and turbid bones is not a true person. After the sixth revolution, the ordinary bones are replaced with immortal bones, the ordinary flesh is shed to grow immortal flesh—exchanging all for flawless unity, the immortal is pure.

*Gazing at the River South*
The sun’s essence fills,
the yin po transforms, leaving no form.

At each full moon, open the earthly gate,
the sacred tortoise drinks the azure jade’s essence—
pure and clean as water once more.
Yang powder glows crimson,
yin powder bears a faint blue-green hue.
Powder replaces flesh, powder replaces bone,
the mortal womb is wholly exchanged for the sacred embryo’s numen,
ascending swift as a shooting star.

*Explanation:*
When yin and yang’s numbers are complete,
hun and po unite within and without,
the body leaves no shadow or form—
this is the Way of ascending as a perfected one.
At each sixth revolution, on the full-moon night of the fifteenth,
circulate the north’s kidney-water to join the south’s heart-fire,
enabling the inner and outer water and fire to achieve mutual fulfillment,
thereby congealing yin powder.
In harmony with heaven and earth’s creative transformations,
it nurtures the sacred embryo’s substance.
The *sacred tortoise* is the tortoise within kidney-water.
Master Lü says: *"The sea-tortoise’s child—none recognize it;
the mountain-burning talisman—ghosts dare not behold."*
This refers precisely to it.
Gathering the moon’s radiant essence into the palace of spirit-water,
the sacred tortoise drinks it—pure as jade, cold as congealed yin.
The powder arises within the northern pole,
hence it takes the tortoise’s form.
*Yang powder* is congealed from the sun’s essence,
thus belonging to yang—its crimson hue likewise mirrors the sun.
*Yin powder* is congealed from moon radiance,
thus belonging to yin—its blue-green hue mirrors the moon.
When bones and flesh are wholly exchanged,
the embryo’s inner flesh, bones, skin, and muscle all vanish,
transforming entirely into immortal substance.
The hun transforms to merge with spirit,
the po transforms to merge with qi,
all becoming a single, pure unity.
Form and spirit both wondrous,
they unite with the Dao in truth.
Those who study the Dao may preserve their spirit,
but cannot yet exchange their form.
Burdened by form, when the spirit departs, the body cannot move.
The corpse lends form—bound by form’s burden,
when the spirit departs, the body cannot move;
the corpse lends form—one cannot forget the body.
After the sixth revolution of the elixir’s completion,
the mortal form is exchanged for immortal substance.
Form and spirit both wondrous,
wherever the spirit directs, the body follows,
ascending to the nine heavens,
swift as clouds, swift as stars.

*Oral Instructions:*
When the elixir completes its sixth revolution,
gather the moon’s radiance.
At each full moon, on the fifteenth night at midnight,
wash and rinse, then sit facing the moon.
Close the breath, seal the mouth,
cut off the incoming and outgoing breath,
so true qi does not leak outward.
Within, true qi fills the six viscera;
the kidney’s true yin and the great yang’s essence,
the inner and outer true qi,
gleam like crystal—limpid and luminous.
After one or two moments,
the kidney’s true water stirs the heart’s fire,
a thread of the heart-spirit’s fire descends into the cinnabar field,
like a wheel of flame set within a lapis lazuli dish.
Then gently open the eyes,
release the breath through the nose,
and facing the moon, inhale the moon’s qi into the cinnabar field.
Draw eighty-one breaths and stop.
After half the inhalations,
the moon’s true yin excites the cinnabar field’s true fire,
water and fire achieve mutual fulfillment,
like boiling water—
the four limbs sweat, the hundred vessels flow freely.
Stop at eighty-one breaths.
Practicing thus for three years completes the work,
advancing the achievement to the seventh revolution’s stage.

*The Seventh Revolution*
At the seventh revolution, the body flies—four limbs light,
spirit-light seals the breath, filling the cinnabar city.
After a thousand mornings of grain abstention, fire naturally arises;
the Kun-gate opens and closes, bathing the ocean’s whale.

*Explanation:*
When the elixir completes its sixth revolution,
yin and yang, inner and outer, are both fulfilled.
Mortal bones are exchanged for immortal bones,
mortal flesh for immortal flesh—
the four limbs and hundred bones harbor no mortal substance.
The immortal body is light and pure,
ascension comes naturally.
The inner elixir refines the spirit-skeleton,
thus the entire body becomes lighter.
At the seventh revolution of the elixir,
yin and yang, inner and outer, harmonize.
One must seal the breath for ten mornings
to perfect the wondrous Dao’s function.
When the elixir completes its seventh revolution,
seal the breath for a thousand mornings,
enabling yin and yang’s great harmony.
When the thousand days’ count is complete,
spirit and qi unite,
the five viscera are renewed,
inner and outer become pure unity.
The elixir’s light shines through the six viscera,
true fire illuminates the five inner organs,
the worms in the intestines transform into water.
From this point, the intestines and stomach are replete,
untainted by the qi of smoke and fire,
unfed by smoke and fire’s food.
Hunger is sated with immortal fruits,
thirst quenched with jade nectar—
unlike the worldly.
After the inner elixir fully transforms,
the yin organ vanishes, leaving only one aperture,
called the *Kun-gate*,
which mirrors yin.
Whenever the spirit-elixir’s fire blazes,
on the third nine-day period,
immerse the body in water,
circulate the elixir pearl,
letting it emerge from the Kun-gate—
inhale, exhale, play with the water, freely at ease.
After one or two hours,
return the elixir to its cinnabar cave
to restrain the fire’s intensity.

*Gazing at the River South*
The form penetrates the sun,
at the seventh revolution, soaring at will.

Secluded in the depths of silent cliffs, one sits in meditation,
breath still, with no coming or going—qi solidifies and congeals.
Rejecting grains reveals its power,
for fire is born of life,
and returning to the root, qi becomes limpid and clear.

When bathing during the ninefold cycles, the Earth-gate opens;
from the moon one gathers fire, from the sun seeks ice—
the five viscera are renewed anew.

*Explanation:*
After the seven revolutions, form and spirit both attain subtlety,
and the inner organs all become vessels of immortality.
Roaming at midday, the body becomes luminous,
its hue like red jade,
soaring and ascending through space, moving freely at will.
In general, one must ensure inner and outer harmony,
so that the radiance of sun and moon
converges in the heart and kidneys, water and fire,
with yin and yang in communion, spirit and qi in harmony.
Deep within mountain valleys, one sits in meditation for hundreds or thousands of days,
closing the nostrils to sever the breath,
so that the harmonious qi congeals and settles.
Then the inner self is replete,
no longer consuming the dust of the world,
thereby realizing the Dao of carefree wandering.

As for rejecting grains, not eating is a marvelous achievement and wondrous path.
After a thousand days of breath-holding,
the spirit-fire blazes within,
scouring away the qi of grains,
eradicating all thoughts of food.
Returning to the root and reverting to the origin,
embracing the One and guarding stillness—
thus it is said: *Returning, qi becomes limpid and clear.*
Whenever the spirit-fire causes the five viscera to grow hot,
on the third nine-day period,
enter the water,
clarify the true elixir,
which shines like a wheel of fire,
emerging from the Earth-gate—
thus it is said: *Opening the Earth-gate.*
The moon is a symbol of yin;
spirit-fire is a thing of utmost yang.
The gate is a yin aperture,
through which yang light emerges from the yin cavity of the Earth-gate—
thus it is said: *From the moon one gathers fire.*
The sun is a yang thing;
the tongue is a yang aperture,
through which spirit-water flows,
emerging from the yang cavity of the tongue—
thus it is said: *From the sun seeks ice.*
The fifth revolution changes the bones,
the sixth revolution changes the flesh,
the seventh revolution changes the five viscera—
the five viscera are the five sacred peaks,
thus it is said: *The five viscera are renewed anew.*

*Oral Instructions:*
When the elixir reaches the seventh revolution,
one should leave the mundane world,
enter deep mountains or secluded valleys to sit in meditation,
seal the breath and spirit,
cutting off the coming and going of breath through mouth and nose.
Let true yin and true yang merge within the abdomen,
seizing the creative power of heaven and earth,
returning it to the four limbs.
After a thousand days,
the five viscera are entirely transformed,
and the fetal qi becomes a celestial palace.
One may feel the aperture at the crown open,
releasing black and red qi—
this is the dispersal of fetal qi.
When the thousand-day count is complete,
the crown aperture closes—
this signifies the fetal qi has fully emerged,
and the seventh revolution is perfected.
From this point onward,
the five viscera are solid and replete,
no longer consuming smoke and fire.
If at times the elixir-fire of the viscera blazes,
enter the water, seal the nostrils,
and let the elixir-pearl and spirit-fire emerge from the Earth-gate,
floating on the water’s surface like a cow playing in yellow mud.
Wait until the spirit-water beneath the tongue flows like a spring,
then absorb the elixir-pearl and spirit-fire,
returning them to the Earth-gate.
This continues until the eighth revolution’s *Earth-sash* is accomplished,
and with no fire-toxins remaining, one no longer needs to bathe.

*Eighth Revolution*
At the eighth revolution, the *Earth-sash* hangs, returning to the origin,
circulating fetal breath to nurture the infant.
When fire blazes, scorching the elixir-cave,
plunge deep into icy springs to play with the red turtle.

*Explanation:*
The infant in the mother’s womb,
within the fetal sac, stabilizes its qi,
unable to expel it—
this is the image of spirit-water in its utmost clarity,
entering without loss.
If the infant’s umbilical cord
is held in its mouth,
the breath comes and goes without cease—
this is natural fetal breathing,
thus it suffers no harm.
After the elixir reaches the eighth revolution,
an umbilical cord-like *Earth-sash* grows from the navel,
resembling the infant’s form,
returning to the original Dao of inception—
thus it is said: *The Earth-sash hangs, returning to the origin.*
The infant obtains the umbilical cord to circulate fetal breath,
thus suffering no harm;
the perfected one obtains the *Earth-sash* to circulate the qi of the celestial cycle,
thus attaining longevity.
The red turtle is the elixir-pearl.
After the eighth revolution,
one refines the true fire within,
eliminating the affliction of heat-toxins.
Whenever fire blazes,
clasp the *Earth-sash* in the mouth and hold the breath.
From the ninth to the ninth day,
true water surges from the elixir field like a gushing spring,
rising to the twelve-storied tower of the *Double Pass*,
with the elixir-pearl within the spirit-water,
like a turtle playing in the water.
From this point onward,
the true fire is free of toxins,
and the affliction of elixir-heat no longer arises—
thus it is said: *When fire blazes, scorching the elixir-cave, plunge deep into icy springs to play with the red turtle.*

*Gazing at the River South*
Inner and outer transform,
the eighth revolution begins the return to the origin.
The *Earth-sash* hangs long, mastering the *Kan-gate*,
circulating fetal breath to pierce the *Heavenly Gate*.
The Dao of the Great Beginning now abides.
A pure, unified body,
black and red qi ever-spouting—
when elixir-fire blazes, scorching the inner landscape,
at the surging of icy springs, bathe the monkey-grandson,
spirit-water and red turtle swallow.

*Explanation:*
When the elixir reaches the eighth revolution,
the outer form and inner five viscera
are entirely transformed.
The *Earth-sash* regenerates,
resembling that of an infant—
thus it is said: *Returning to the origin.*
The *Earth-sash* is the cord below the navel,
born from the navel,
belonging to the northern *Kan* trigram—
thus it is said: *The Kan-gate and Heavenly Gate.*
The aperture of the *Flowery Pond* and the *Earth-sash* enter the mouth,
circulating the breath of the celestial cycle
to regulate the fire-times—
thus it is said: *Circulating celestial breath.*
The Dao of the Great Beginning
is the origin of heaven and earth;
when the elixir reaches the eighth revolution,
it is like the inception of heaven and earth’s creation.
The inner elixir is pure yang,
without a trace of yin qi—
thus it is said: *A pure, unified body.*
Black and red are the qi of spirit-fire.
When the elixir reaches the eighth revolution,
it arises from the heart,
constantly entering and exiting through the nose,
ever manifesting as black and red qi—
thus it is said: *Qi ever-spouting.*
The affliction of elixir-fire
is tempered by circulating spirit-water,
leaving no sign of elixir-heat.
The elixir is the heart-pearl,
the monkey-grandson of the heart;
the red turtle is the fire-spirit.
The elixir floats within the water,
like a turtle swallowing water—
this describes its form.

*Oral Instructions:*

When the elixir completes its eighth revolution, the earth-belt arises within the navel, and if elixir-fire still causes heat, with the five viscera parched and dry, close the eyes and sit in repose. Connect the earth-belt beneath the Flowery Pond, allowing the breath to circulate internally, flowing and pervading through the revolving Dao. After closing the breath, the true water of the elixir field gradually increases day by day. By the ninth day, the spirit-water ascends to the Twelve-Storied Tower, and the elixir-pearl conceals itself within the spirit-water, expelling the fire-toxin. Thereafter, no further affliction of dryness arises. At midnight on the ninth night, close the breath and draw the spirit-water from the Mud-Pill Palace, passing through the Spine-Strap back to the elixir field to complete the work.

**Ninth Revolution:**
When the work of nine revolutions is done,
the Dao-fruit of carefree wandering is complete.
With three thousand merits of conduct,
one becomes an immortal.
Golden writ and jade tablets proclaim the imperial decree,
feet treading auspicious clouds to pay homage in the Nine Heavens.

**Explanation:**
When the elixir completes its ninth revolution, the transformation is perfected, and the Dao-fruit is fully realized. Only after accumulating three thousand merits of external conduct and fulfilling the external fruit can one ascend. Thus, after refining his elixir, Master Xu of Jingyang eradicated the harm of flood dragons before ascending. After refining his elixir, Sun Simiao healed the ailments of ten thousand people before ascending. All must establish merit and achieve renown before ascending. On the day of ascension, celestial music arrives in welcome, with flutes and zithers harmonizing to pass through the Heavenly Gate. According to one’s merits and conduct, one is ranked among the immortals, joining the celestial ranks to endure as long as heaven and earth.

**Internal Elixir Secrets: Nine Revolutions of the Golden Elixir**
*Composed by Chen Puchong of the Mud-Pill Tradition*

**First Revolution Song:**
Beneath the tongue lie four apertures,
two linking to the heart, two to the fluids.
The work of the first revolution resembles a precious pearl,
permeating mountains, rivers, and the cosmos with a numinous body.
Beneath the red lotus leaves lies the elixir-cavern,
crimson water flowing through the nine-marked pearl.

The work of the first revolution resembles a precious pearl.
The true water of Heavenly One is stored in the gallbladder,
where yin and yang harmonize and descend as the elixir,
appearing like a single dewdrop.
The work of the inner elixir begins with one and is completed in nine.
One is the origin of all things.
Heavenly One generates water, earthly two generates fire,
heavenly three generates wood, earthly four generates metal,
heavenly five generates earth.
The sequence of the five phases begins with one,
thus the work of the inner elixir also begins with one.
It is completed in nine revolutions, for nine is the utmost of yang numbers.
When the number reaches nine, the Dao-fruit is achieved.
The "precious pearl" refers to the true water of Heavenly One stored in the gallbladder,
where yin and yang harmonize and descend as the elixir.
Its initial descent resembles a single luminous dewdrop.
The pearl is cherished as the elixir.

**Permeating mountains, rivers, and the cosmos with a numinous body:**
The human body arises from the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood—this is the union of forms.
The elixir descends from the union of heart-fire and kidney-water—this is the union of qi.
When the elixir descends, the spirit roams beyond the mundane,
yin and yang achieve great harmony,
and one forgets the body entirely.
Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers,
the six directions and the myriad things
all reside within this body,
while this body exists beyond heaven and earth.
One only perceives within a single point of radiance like the sun—
this is the descent of the elixir.
The human body arises from the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood—this is the union of forms.
The descent of the elixir arises from the union of heart-fire and kidney-water—this is the union of qi.
Thus it is said: the union of forms gives birth to humans,
while the union of qi forms the elixir.
After the elixir descends, the spirit roams beyond the mundane,
yin and yang achieve great harmony,
and one sits in forgetfulness of the body.
Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers,
the six directions and the myriad things
all reside within this body,
while this body exists beyond heaven and earth.
One only perceives a single point of radiance within the heart—
this is the descent of the elixir.
Thus it is said: *permeating mountains, rivers, and the cosmos with a numinous body.*
The body encompasses mountains and rivers within itself.

**Beneath the red lotus leaves lies the elixir-cavern:**
Beneath the tongue lie two apertures,
the left connecting to the heart, the right to the gallbladder.
True qi flows to communicate with the spirit.
Thus, when the human body is unwell, the fluids beneath the tongue dry up,
for the true qi is depleted.
At the outset of the first revolution,
the tongue seals these two apertures,
preventing the true qi from leaking outward
and enabling the spirit-water to flow.
The "red lotus" refers to the tongue.
From the two apertures, one connects to the heart, the other to the fluids.
When one is ill, the fluids beneath the tongue dry up, and the true qi is depleted.
At the outset of the first revolution, the tongue seals these two apertures,
preventing the true qi from leaking outward
and enabling the spirit-water to flow.

**Crimson water flowing through the nine-marked pearl:**
The crimson water is the fluid.
At the beginning of the nine revolutions,
every nine days, perform nine subtle breaths.
With each breath, take nine sips,
naturally allowing the fluids to flow,
arising from the tongue to irrigate the five viscera—
these are the nine marks.
The "crimson water" is the fluid of the heart.
At the beginning of the nine revolutions,
every nine days, take nine breaths,
with each breath taking nine sips.
Naturally, the fluids flow from beneath the tongue
to irrigate the five viscera—
thus it is called the nine-marked pearl.

**Song of Gazing at the River South:**
Seal the apertures beneath the tongue to connect with the gallbladder’s qi.
The treasure of the Yellow Center must be sought within the gallbladder.
The spring wind brings forth the myriad things,
while beneath heaven and earth, it is my companion.
The hundred meridians flow naturally.
It enacts transformation,
drawing the paired fires from left and right.
Vast and billowing, it illuminates the cosmos,
ascending in wispy smoke to encircle the tower,
as the couple gradually conspire.

**The treasure of the Yellow Center must be sought within the gallbladder:**
The qi of Heavenly One is called the Yellow Center.
This qi is stored in the gallbladder,
serving as the root of life and destiny.
Its flavor is bitter,
just as the roots and stems of plants and trees are also bitter—
thus it is known that nothing can grow without the generative qi.
For the medicine of the inner elixir,
first seal the two apertures beneath the tongue,
internally connecting to the generative qi of the gallbladder.
When a faint bitterness arises between the throat and tongue,
the generative qi is flowing.

Then seek the spirit to become the elixir.
The qi of Heavenly One is called the Yellow Center.
This qi is stored in the gallbladder,
serving as the root of life and destiny.
Its flavor is bitter—
thus the qi and flavor of the human gallbladder are also bitter.
Just as the roots and blossoms of plants and trees are bitter,
it is known that nothing can grow without the generative qi.

For the medicine of the inner elixir,
first seal the two apertures beneath the tongue,
internally connecting to the generative qi of the gallbladder.
When a faint bitterness arises between the throat and tongue,
the elixir qi is flowing.
Then the mercury-water congeals to form the elixir.

The decree of the Spring Lord brings forth the myriad things—
all things receive the spring qi before they can grow.
When one connects to the qi of the gallbladder,
the inner elixir is accomplished.
The generative qi of Heaven and Earth sprouts in spring;
all things receive this generative qi before they can grow.
Humans, too, receive this generative qi,
storing it in the gallbladder.
When one connects to the qi of the gallbladder,
the inner elixir achieves the first turning of its work,
like the spring of the four seasons.

Heaven and Earth lie beneath my knees,
as the hundred vessels flow freely.
The generative qi ascends,
and bitterness is sensed in the mouth.
Yin and Yang achieve great harmony,
and the spirit dwells beyond the heavens—
then the four seas and all under heaven lie beneath my knees.
The vast qi fills Heaven and Earth,
the hundred vessels flow freely,
and the myriad apertures open wide,
as the inner elixir descends.
The generative qi ascends within,
and bitterness is sensed—
Yin and Yang achieve great harmony,
and the spirit dwells beyond the heavens—
then the four seas and all under heaven lie beneath my knees.
The vast qi fills Heaven and Earth,
the hundred vessels flow freely,
and the myriad apertures open wide,
as the inner elixir descends.

At the outset of practice,
first seal the two apertures beneath the tongue,
preventing the qi from leaking outward.
The qi of the left and right apertures rises from within:
the left passes through the left Greater Yang to enter the brain,
while the right, together with the left, traverses the brain to reach the crown.
In the Mud Pill Palace, they merge as one,
then descend the Twelve-Storied Tower,
entering the Heart Channel and passing into the gallbladder,
where they surge open the gallbladder’s aperture,
causing the generative qi within to ascend.
Following the vessels of the heart and gallbladder,
it pierces the tongue’s aperture,
and the tongue senses a bitter flavor—
this is the generative qi flowing,
about to descend the elixir.

At the outset of practice,
first seal the two apertures beneath the tongue,
preventing the qi from leaking outward.
The qi on the left pierces the left Greater Yang to enter the brain,
while the qi on the right pierces the right Greater Yin to enter the brain.
Left and right together traverse the brain,
entering the crown’s Mud Pill Palace to merge as one,
then descend the Twelve-Storied Tower,
passing through the Heart Channel into the gallbladder,
where they surge open the gallbladder’s aperture.
The generative qi within the gallbladder ascends,
following the vessels of the heart and gallbladder
to pierce the tongue’s aperture.
When the tongue senses a bitter flavor,
this is the generative qi flowing,
about to descend the elixir.

Vast and billowing, it fills the cosmos;
wispy smoke ascends to encircle the tower.
Once the gallbladder’s aperture opens,
the generative qi rises in wisps,
ascending the Twelve-Storied Tower
to enter the aperture beneath the tongue.
The mouth senses bitterness—
this is the sign of the generative qi flowing.
Then, sealing the tongue’s apertures,
the qi on left and right ascends,
creating a billowing effect.
Once the gallbladder’s aperture closes,
the generative qi rises in wisps,
ascending the Twelve-Storied Tower
through the aperture beneath the tongue.
The mouth senses bitterness—
this is the generative qi flowing.

The couple gradually conspire.
When the generative qi flows freely,
Yin and Yang achieve great harmony,
and the heart and kidneys unite in congress—
thus it is said they gradually conspire.
The couple represents Yin and Yang:
the husband is Yang, the wife is Yin.
When the generative qi flows freely,
Yin and Yang achieve great harmony,
and the heart and kidneys unite in congress—
thus it is said they gradually conspire.

**Oral Instructions:**
At the outset of practice,
first regulate diet to harmonize the five viscera,
avoiding hunger or overfullness.
The field of the heart must be tranquil,
free from worry or distraction—
only then can one enter the Dao.

neither hungry nor overfull.
The field of the heart must be tranquil,
free from worry or distraction—
only then can one enter the Dao.

When the second watch ends and the third begins,
first wash and rinse,
then enter a quiet chamber to burn incense.
Sit cross-legged, close the eyes, and concentrate the spirit.
When the breath is even,
curl the tongue back to seal the two apertures at its root,
gradually holding the breath.
Sense the two channels of qi in the Greater Yang meridians,
rising from the roots of the molars
to pierce the Greater Yang and enter the crown,
reaching the Mud Pill Palace—
this counts as one cycle.

When the breath is even,
first curl the tongue back to seal the two apertures at its root,
gradually holding the breath.
Sense the two channels of qi in the Greater Yang meridians,
rising from the roots of the molars
to surge upward, piercing the two Greater Yangs,
then entering the crown.
When the two qi merge,
this counts as one cycle.

Then open the eyes for a while,
close them again to concentrate the spirit,
and curl the tongue as before,
waiting for the qi to reach the Mud Pill Palace before stopping.
Do this three times each night.
Then close the eyes for a while,
again curling the tongue as before,
waiting for the qi to reach the Mud Pill Palace before stopping.
Do this three times each night.

After several nights, or ten days, or half a month,
gradually sense the qi reaching the Mud Pill Palace,
then flowing into the brain,
descending the Twelve-Storied Tower,
passing through the spine to thread the tailbone and rise upward.
The true qi enters the heart and pierces the gallbladder,
warming the stomach with a gentle heat,
bringing a subtle sense of harmony and ease—
this is the true qi descending.

After several nights or days,
gradually sense the qi reaching the Mud Pill Palace,
then flowing into the brain,
descending the Twelve-Storied Tower,
piercing the spine to thread the tailbone and rise forward.
It enters the heart and pierces the gallbladder,
warming the navel and stomach with a gentle heat,
bringing a subtle sense of harmony and ease—
this is the true descent.

After several more nights of practice,
gradually sense the qi reaching the heart,
then a gentle warmth,
or a faint stirring of qi at the heart’s center.
A warm qi then rises behind the heart,
passing the Twelve-Storied Tower
to enter beneath the tongue.

Gradually, a faint bitterness arises in the mouth—this is the Central Yellow qi emerging from the gallbladder. Yin and yang achieve great harmony, and the descent of the elixir is imminent.

After several nights, the qi once more reaches the heart, followed by a gentle warmth, or a faint stirring of qi at the heart’s center. A warm qi then rises from the heart, passing the Twelve-Storied Tower, and the mouth senses a slight bitterness. This is the Central Yellow qi emerging from the gallbladder, yin and yang in perfect harmony, and the descent of the elixir is imminent.

Before each night’s practice, have someone stand guard outside the door to prevent anyone from entering, as well as cats, dogs, or other creatures, lest they startle you unexpectedly. When practicing three times each night, place a low table before you as you sit. During the circulation of qi, you may suddenly feel your body expanding, your spirit soaring, until gradually your dwelling, the cities, the entire world—all seem to lie within you. Above, you feel as vast as the heavens; below, as boundless as the earth. Your hands and feet seem to vanish—then quickly press your hands upon the table, close your eyes, and you will sense a small, radiant orb of light at your heart, round as the sun. Suddenly, it descends—this is the elixir descending.

Before each night’s practice, station someone outside the door to bar entry to people, cats, dogs, or other creatures, lest they startle you unexpectedly. When practicing two or three times each night, place a low table before you as you sit. Suddenly, the qi surges, and you feel your body expanding, your spirit soaring, until gradually your home, all people, mountains, and rivers seem to lie within you. Your hands and feet seem to vanish—then quickly press your hands upon the table, close your eyes, and you will sense a small, radiant orb of light at your heart, round as the sun. Suddenly, it descends into the Cinnabar Field—this is the descent of the elixir.

After the elixir descends, do not open your eyes at once. Gradually gather your spirit, returning it to your limbs. Your hands and feet will feel as they did before, though they may tingle slightly. Remain composed for some time, then open your eyes and drink ginseng broth before sleeping until the next day. Eat congee and rest for a day or two—this completes the descent of the elixir.

Once the elixir has descended, all illnesses vanish, and no suffering or affliction remains.

After the elixir descends, do not open your eyes immediately. Slowly gather your spirit and settle it, allowing your limbs to return to their former state. Your hands and feet may feel numb—wait until you are fully composed, then open your eyes. Drink ginseng broth and sleep. The next morning, eat congee and rest for a day or two—this is the descent of the elixir. Once the elixir has descended, all illnesses vanish, and no suffering or affliction remains.
