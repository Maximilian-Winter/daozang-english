**Reader’s Notice:**

1. This book was composed in the *guimao* year of the Guangxu reign (1903), eight years prior to the founding of the Republic of China.

2. The author was a woman who remained unwed all her life, devotedly filial to her mother, who herself observed widow’s chastity. Both mother and daughter were devoted to the Dao, yet lacking a teacher, they gleaned oral instructions from various alchemical texts. At her mother’s behest, the author compiled this work, drawing entirely from excerpts of other *danjing* (alchemical classics), rather than composing it herself.

3. The texts excerpted vary in quality; thus, their theories occasionally contradict one another, and their prose is often verbose. Though some revisions were made, the original intent could not be entirely altered. Scholars must employ their own discernment when studying it.

4. Terms such as "Ancient Mother Xiangyi," "Supreme Emperor of the Dark Heavens," "Jade Emperor of the Golden Palace," "Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool," and "Daoist Matriarch of Perfect Clarity" are all fictitious names borrowed from other texts. In this age of dispelling superstition, such appellations ought not to be used, yet they are retained here as they appear in the original.

5. The book asserts that a woman’s alchemical attainment requires awaiting "transmission" (*daidu*), a theory that is far from satisfactory. This stems from the old custom of valuing men over women. Most religious institutions worldwide deny equality between the sexes—not solely in China. Only when women of exceptional talent emerge can such conventions be broken.

6. In the section attributed to the "Jade Emperor of the Golden Palace," he states: *"Some claim that unless the Red Dragon is severed, the elixir cannot form and the Dao cannot be realized. Yet if the blood is exhausted, so too is the qi. Just as a man’s essence decays and his elixir becomes difficult to refine, the principle is the same. For men’s essence and women’s blood must not be entirely cut off. Qi arises from blood, and when blood transforms into qi, essence flows freely. If one insists that blood must be exhausted to refine the elixir, why do young women with blood depletion fall ill instead? This alone proves that blood cannot be entirely forsaken."*

   **Note:** Severing the Red Dragon refers to the practice of refining and halting menstruation through cultivation, not to blood depletion in women. To equate severing the Red Dragon with blood exhaustion or desiccation is to mistake it for the pathology of *ganxuelao* (consumptive blood depletion). If a woman truly suffers from this condition, she must employ special methods—combined with medical treatment—to restore her menstrual cycle to its regular, healthy state before gradually refining and halting it according to the oral instructions for severing the Dragon. This gentleman’s conflation of the effects of severing the Red Dragon with *ganxuelao* is a grave error.

7. The differing methods for men and women in the initial stages of cultivation arise from physiological distinctions. If a woman wishes to enter the Dao, she must first acquire a foundational understanding of medicine before undertaking practice, lest she err in her approach. No true student of immortality neglects the study of medicine—this is a concrete principle, not to be dismissed as mere abstruse theory or lofty discourse on nature and mind.

8. Regardless of sex, those incapable of conceiving mortal offspring will never attain the hope of forming an immortal embryo. The principles of human birth and immortal transformation are fundamentally the same; the difference lies solely in whether one follows or reverses the natural course. Severing the Red Dragon is a reversal of creation’s flow. If one mistakenly believes that the cessation of menstruation alone suffices for immortality, then women over fifty—whose menses naturally cease—would all possess the qualifications of immortals. If one argues that the elderly are a special case, what of modern young women who undergo surgical removal of the uterus or ovaries, thereby naturally halting menstruation? Can this be deemed severing the Red Dragon? Such matters demand profound investigation.

**Preface**

Ze-huan lost her father in early youth. Her mother, steadfast in widowhood, had no sons, and only we three sisters remained. Soon after, my second sister passed away, and my third sister was betrothed, awaiting marriage. Unwilling to bear my mother’s lonely suffering in widowhood, Ze-huan vowed to remain chaste and serve her, swearing never to marry. At the age of twelve, I began to observe vegetarian precepts alongside my mother, finding solace in reciting *Songs of Exhortation to Goodness*. I often admired the accounts of cultivation in moral tracts—the beauty of self-cultivation, the nobility of immortals and buddhas—yet lamented the lack of an enlightened teacher to guide me in the secrets, and the absence of alchemical scriptures to verify my own experience. For nearly a decade, I silently entreated the heavens for karmic affinity.

Then, in the summer of *gengzi* (1900), the turmoil in the capital of Kyoto struck. Escorting my mother, we took refuge on Mount E, where I first learned of Buddhist texts on female cultivation: the *Sutra of Lady Malla*, the *Sutra of Mātanga-girl*, the *Sutra of the Daughter of Anāthapiṇḍada*, the *Biographies of Bhikṣuṇīs*, and the *Biographies of Virtuous Women*—a mere drop in the vast ocean. Later, I obtained *The Mani Candle Illuminating the Earth*, a collection of over seventy works compiled by Lady Rushan, a *upāsikā* named Shanyi. Yet the Buddhist canon is profound, emphasizing nature over life-destiny, and not readily accessible to beginners.

As for Daoist texts on female elixir (*nüdan*), they are often scattered within the *Daoist Canon*, without order or dedicated volumes—an endless sea, leaving one overwhelmed. Undeterred by my own inadequacy, I excised and compiled passages on female elixir from the sacred scriptures, gathering over a hundred pages. I explained them to my mother, both to dispel her solitude and to encourage her hidden cultivation. Beyond serving her with filial devotion, I followed her command to extract the differences and similarities between male and female alchemical practice from my collection, transcribing them into a separate volume of over five thousand characters. I titled it *On the Differences and Similarities in Male and Female Elixir Work*, placing it by my side to prevent confusion in practice, which might otherwise lead to strange illnesses. I cannot escape the charge of superficiality, but if fellow seekers find value in it, how could I dare withhold it?

Master Sun Yuan’s *Commentary on the Kun Decisions* states:
The *Tuan* says: “Supreme is the Kun’s primordial power—all things draw upon it for life.”
Kun belongs to old yin; when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born. In following Heaven, it gives life to humans and creatures; in following the self, it completes the Dao and attains perfection.

Ancient Mother Xiang Yi says:
In all cases, men’s cultivation begins with the initial work of refining and laying the foundation. For women’s cultivation, however, it differs from men’s. In men, yang descends and disperses; in women, yang ascends. Men’s bodies are firm; women’s bodies are soft. Men use the yang essence of the cinnabar field, constantly preserving and guarding it to prevent external leakage. After long accumulation, they employ fire to refine it, transmuting essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness. Progressing step by step, once the work is complete, they ascend in flight. Women, however, are different. Women are inherently bodies of yin turbidity and blood and flesh. They use the numinous fat of the breasts to transform their qi and disposition. Through prolonged refinement, naturally the red reverses to white, and blood transmutes into qi. Once blood has become qi, they too employ fire talismans to refine it, enabling qi to revert to pure yang, completing the Dao and returning to truth.

In women’s initial work, they first refine the physical form, then refine the original essence. This is unlike men’s work, which first refines the original essence, then the physical form. Their bodies differ, so their work naturally varies. If one does not distinguish the teachings by category, how can one harmonize yin and yang and enable men and women to aid one another?

Yet since the body is already ours, why refine it? Women’s bodies are originally yin turbidity, unlike men’s bodies, which inherently possess yang firmness. Without refinement, blood cannot be transmuted into qi—how then can one conceive the primordial or produce true qi? Without true qi, one remains a mass of pure yin—how could one attain the returned elixir and accomplish the great Dao? Thus, a woman’s form must first be refined before it is viable.

The Dao of female immortals fundamentally differs from men’s work. Men’s Dao values the refinement of the medicine; thus, the earlier stages of work are explained step by step. If one practices diligently day and night with sincere progress, the blood in the five viscera will all revert to qi, naturally transforming and generating. When true qi arises in concealment, the turbid yin body is transmuted into pure yang. Only at this stage can one employ fire and enact talismans, becoming equal to men.

If one does not distinguish the teachings by category, how can the work succeed? Thus, men first refine the medicine, then the form; women first refine the form, then the medicine. Because their bodies differ, the sequence of work also varies. In establishing teachings for others, I must clearly instruct so that learners do not suffer deficiencies.

The principles of female elixir cultivation are not inherently complex, and their practice is not difficult. The reason most elixir classics do not transmit women’s cultivation is that they fail to address both men and women. In offering teachings now, I truly wish for both men and women to cross over together. Thus, following the elixir texts, I append *Ten Principles of the Female Dao* to guide those of karmic affinity.

Why is the Dao of the female elixir so simple and uncluttered? Women’s nature is pure and whole; women’s bodies are tranquil and serene. With just a little work, they can achieve thorough accomplishment. Unlike men, whose thoughts are often biased and deviant, their bodies and minds differ in what they value. Women’s work is swifter than men’s.

From nurturing the true to embryonic breathing, women’s work has already achieved two-thirds of the process. Unlike men’s work, which requires many operations to reach the stage of harmonizing the spirit, in female elixir texts, from nurturing the embryo to embryonic breathing, once the work is complete, one proceeds to external cultivation. Only when external cultivation is abundant can one refine the stage of harmonizing the spirit.

Why must female immortals, once cultivated, await deliverance? Because their bodies of weak blood rely on internal work to refine and become yang bodies. Though the body has become yang, the congealed yin nature has not yet been fully refined. Thus, women’s work lacks the final stage of returning to emptiness, unable to fully manifest the wondrous transformations of Heaven and Earth. The reason they cannot transcend the world is entirely due to the fragility of their bodies. Unlike men, whose bodies are refined into indestructible vajra forms, with the work of returning to emptiness complete, their spirit-light fills Heaven and Earth. Thus, they do not need to await deliverance to complete the Dao, attain perfection, personally attend the Celestial Emperor, and wander at leisure in Penglai.

Women, however, are different. Once the female elixir is cultivated, they must broadly perform meritorious deeds. Only when their merit is complete, seen and pitied by the upper sages, who then memorialize the Celestial Emperor, will an imperial edict be issued and a golden decree selected, certifying the supreme Dao fruit of humanity and Heaven. Otherwise, they will merely become solitary immortals.

Master Lü says:
“Refining the form in the Great Yin differs only slightly from men’s cultivation. The initial work begins with severing the Red Dragon. Thereafter, ten months of work bring the yang spirit to manifestation, shattering emptiness. The path of cultivation is the same as men’s, with no distinction between them.”

The Daoist of Sui Mountain says:
“Once the Red Dragon is severed, the nipples retract like a man’s, and the true yin qi transforms into true yang. Thereafter, the work is no different from men’s. But since women belong to the tranquil body, though the latter four stages share the same operations as men’s elixir, their achievements are even swifter.”

Master Lü says:
“Men’s cultivation subdues the White Tiger; women’s cultivation severs the Red Dragon.”

The *Three Mandates Chapter* says:
“Men’s mandate lies in the cinnabar field—the cinnabar field is the true earth that generates the elixir.”

The female mandate lies in the breasts, for the breasts are the essence of the mother-qi’s Wood.

It is also said: “Women take blood as their kidneys, which are hollow cavities. After forty-nine years, the waist dries and blood withers, leaving no vitality. Yet with long nurturing, the primal blood regenerates, as in a maiden—this is the marvel of creating something from nothing. When this ‘something’ appears, a single severing transforms it, and life is born. From this point onward, the work of cultivating both nature and life is the same as men’s.”

Master Lazy Daoist says: “Why are there three mandates for women? They are the upper, middle, and lower. The upper is the yang cavity, the middle is the Yellow Chamber, and the lower is the cinnabar field. In youth, one begins from the upper; in decline, from the middle; and only at maturity, from the lower. Moreover, women are inwardly yang and outwardly yin, so they must first sever the Red Dragon to preserve their body, whereupon *kan* transforms into *qian*. Thereafter, they employ the same work as men, achieving success in a single year, for the golden elixir resides within.”

The *Inquiries on Cultivating the Dao* asks: “How do the starting points differ for men and women?”
The answer: “Men begin by refining qi as the essential task, while women begin by refining form. Refining qi means subduing one’s qi, and subduing qi requires its return. When qi returns, emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness becomes profound, root and life are restored, and the White Tiger is subdued. Refining form means concealing one’s form, and concealing form requires its dissolution. When form dissolves, the Four Great enter emptiness, the limbs decay, and the Red Channel is severed. When men subdue the White Tiger, they revert to a youthful body, and the post-heaven essence no longer leaks, allowing the elixir to coalesce and years to be extended. When women sever the Red Dragon, they likewise revert to a youthful body, and the impure yin blood no longer descends, allowing them to escape death and enter life. Thus, men’s cultivation is called ‘Great Yang Refining Qi,’ while women’s cultivation is called ‘Great Yin Refining Form.’”

It is further asked: “Do women refining form not subdue qi?”
The answer: “Women are yin by nature, so their qi is easily subdued, but the Red Channel is most harmful to the Dao. This is their crucial point, so they begin by applying effort where it matters most. Once the Red Channel is severed, qi naturally becomes docile—not like men, who are yang by nature and whose qi is difficult to subdue. For example, while men require three years to subdue qi, women can achieve it in one. If a woman is truly a hero among women, receives her master’s oral instructions, and practices the Great Yin Refining Form method, she may attain the Dao in three to five years, with less effort than men. Yet such heroines among women are exceedingly rare. Only those whose fortitude exceeds a man’s by a hundredfold can succeed. Those equal in strength to men cannot achieve it at all.”

Another asked, “The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women—why then are there differences between them?”

The answer came: “The Dao is the same, but its application differs. This is because their inherent natures are not alike, and their physical forms are distinct. Thus, though the Way of cultivating life and destiny is one, the methods of practice vary greatly.”

The Dark-Heaven Thearch said:
The *Book of Changes* states, “Qian is the father, Kun the mother,” making the principle of yin and yang abundantly clear. Only after heaven and earth exist do men and women arise, so the Way of yin and yang is self-evident. Thus, it is manifest that heaven and earth cannot be without men and women. Men receive the transformations of Qian and Kun to form their image, while women inherit the harmonious union of Qian and Kun to take their shape. All who possess these forms are endowed with the qi of Qian and Kun, and together they stand within the cosmos.

Now, in this era of compassionate ferrying and universal salvation, when the precious raft is shared by all, the teachings for men are manifold—how could we abandon the Kun axis and pay it no heed? The profound and wondrous instructions for men fill libraries to overflowing, while the models and standards for women are few and far between. Moved by deep sorrow, I speak of this alone.

In men, qi within essence courses through the *xiezi*; in women, qi within blood warms the *xiezi*. When the *xiezi* is full, the lotus aperture is full; when the lotus aperture is full, the drawing and replenishing begin to move; when drawing and replenishing move, the sweet dew first descends.

Men’s essence is abundant in qi; women’s blood is meager in qi—hence they are called yang in men and yin in women. Those who cultivate our Way take cutting off the seven emotions as their foundation and severing the six desires as their priority. Thus, their faint qi often surpasses that of men. Why? Men’s minds are easily stirred, while women’s thoughts are somewhat still. When stirred, qi is easily lost; when still, qi is easily nurtured. In men, the seven lotuses are easy to gather but hard to release; in women, they are easy to release but hard to gather. If one can remain truly unwavering in resolve, without waiting three to five years, sweet dew will descend constantly, and the seven lotuses will remain open. If opening is easy, how could gathering be difficult? The distinction between men and women is clear here.

Yet when texts speak of emptiness, void, mystery, subtlety, spirit, or transformation, these are the great commonalities of men and women. Men speak of the “embryo,” while women do not use the term “embryo” but simply call it “breathing.” This is to prevent later generations from misconstruing the word “embryo” and ultimately suffering false accusations. Moreover, when a man’s spirit departs, it must reach pure yang before the shell can be shed, for yang contains yin. A woman’s spirit departs differently. When she attains the three yangs, she can already transcend a hundred leagues; when she reaches the meeting of the pure and old two yangs, her departure is permanent, with no risk of premature demise. This is because men contain yin within yang, while women contain yang within yin. In men, yin is within and yang without; in women, yin is without and yang within. When yang prevails, all yin readily retreats.

I now spare no true transmission, revealing this here, solely in the earnest hope that many may swiftly realize their true resolve.

The Golden Tower Lord said:
From a broad perspective, the hundred vessels all emerge from the formless Ultimate; in finer detail, they belong to the formless and imageless, yet originally encompass all transformations. Both men and women share this supreme treasure—only the two paths of blood and essence differ. Men’s essence ascends in reversal to become immortals; women’s blood rises straight to the heart aperture. Thus, each has its own method, each its own illumination.

The elixir in men is formed by essence transforming into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into emptiness. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, the elixir naturally coalesces. The elixir in women is formed by blood transforming into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into emptiness. When emptiness is natural, the elixir naturally forms.

Some say that without severing the Red Dragon, the elixir cannot form and the Dao cannot be achieved. They do not realize that when blood is exhausted, qi is also exhausted—just as when a man’s essence decays, the elixir is difficult to form. The principle is the same. For essence in men and blood in women cannot be entirely cut off. When qi departs from blood, qi has no source; when blood transforms into qi, essence begins to flow. If one claims to refine the elixir only after blood is exhausted, why do young women whose blood is depleted instead fall ill? This ultimately proves that blood cannot be abandoned.

The Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool said:
“Women’s practice shares much with men’s—only the stages differ, and the ground is not mysterious. All wondrous transformations are no different from men’s. You must deeply awaken to this. The texts hold the complete record, without the slightest error. Each must cultivate in seclusion.”

Round Bright Dao Mother said:
“I shall now reveal the truth to spare you from suffering wrongful karma. The paths of yin and yang are apportioned—men and women share one principle. Men possess this ancestral qi, distributed within essence and blood. Women’s ancestral qi converges, spoken of as arising from the Sea of Blood. Men have this yang pass, its flow and reversal requiring no confusion. Women have the Northern Sea’s terrain, its waves surging as if pressed by water. White Lotus Perfected One said: ‘The terrain of the Golden Elixir differs for men and women, yet the principle of yin and yang is truly the same. Clarity of mind and few desires are the root; to lay the foundation, first sever the Red Dragon.’

Master Wu Xin said:
“Men’s essence is yang within yin; women’s essence is yin within yang. Swiftly seek a luminous teacher to receive instruction, and return to youth in your native land. If the Heavenly Heart of seven days can be restored, this is the supreme wondrous technique. Thereafter, the work is the same as for men—every oral instruction must be taught by the master.”

Lüzu said:
“Women’s cultivation is like men’s in every way; what is difficult to attain is purity. Know that women’s desires exceed men’s. When the menstrual flow has ceased, their hearts are like lotuses just opening, riding heaven’s rain and dew to bear fruit. If a woman has no man, she is solitary yin. Master Zhen Yi said: ‘The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women—all may achieve completion. Thus, when a man perfects the Dao, he becomes a Perfected One; when a woman perfects it, she becomes a Yuanjun. From ancient times, alchemical texts have described men’s cultivation in exhaustive detail, while women’s practice is rarely addressed. When it is mentioned, only a glimpse is offered—not out of disdain for women’s cultivation. The underlying assumption is that humans share the same nature and life, thus the same work; speak of men’s practice, and women’s work need not be elaborated. Yet men are yang without and yin within, while women are yin without and yang within. Their inherent natures differ, their forms are distinct. Though they share the same nature and life, their methods of practice differ greatly.’

*The Discernment of Cultivating the Real* states: ‘Men begin with refining qi as essential; women begin with refining form as essential.’ Xu Zu said: ‘When men cultivate, they achieve non-leakage of essence; when women cultivate, they achieve non-leakage of menses.’ Their initial barriers are entirely distinct. Yet in refining the self, obtaining the medicine, returning the elixir, warming and nourishing, and forming the embryo to release the spirit, though similar to men’s, the subtle sequences may still differ in major and minor ways.

In the spring of the *renchen* year, a woman of the *kun* trigram sought the Dao. Having read many ancient books, I verified what she had been taught. Yet alchemical texts say: ‘Works on women’s practice are uniquely scarce, making it difficult to examine differences.’ Thus, undeterred by the transgression of revealing heavenly secrets, I set down in writing the ways in which they are the same and the ways they differ, arranging each step in order to serve as a guide for those seeking the ford. Let them follow the text to interpret its meaning, avoiding the confusion of fish eyes with pearls. If one can deeply understand and vigorously practice, one may achieve the supreme and ultimate Dao, and at the assemblies of the Jasper Pool, it will be no difficulty to join the male immortals in paying homage to Lord Mu and together attend the Golden Mother.

Heaven is yang, earth is yin; *qian* is firm, *kun* is yielding. Yin cannot grow without yang; yang cannot be born without yin. When firmness and softness achieve harmony, water and fire can then achieve mutual completion. Yin and yang must have their counterparts, and from this, humans and all beings are conceived. Thus, *qian* and *kun* both bear the qi of true origin; men and women each possess an undying body. *Qian* is called ‘great generation’—through it, one may perfect the Dao and awaken to truth. *Kun* is called ‘vast generation’—through it, one may also realize the fruit and become a Yuanjun. If one claims that the yin of *kun* cannot enter the immortal Dao, how then does the Queen Mother long dwell on Kunlun? Chang’e stole the elixir between the beams and forever became the empress of the moon palace. The carefree one read the books of the lacquer garden and styled herself the banished immortal of the Jasper Pool. The goddess of the Luo River and the shamanka of Wu have been illustrious since antiquity; Purple Maiden and the Xiang Consorts are celebrated even now. Their traces are recorded in historical texts and can certainly be verified. How could one who embodies the virtue of *kun* be incapable?

Women’s original destiny has three phases—purple, white, and yellow lights—not like men’s. Youth is above, decline in the middle, completion below; one must deeply comprehend the critical juncture where a mistake is made. The qi cavity is the origin of blood, the breasts—located one *cun* and three *fen* in the center, not the two breasts. Men’s destiny lies in the Cinnabar Field, thus the lower field is their qi cavity. Women’s destiny lies in the breasts, thus the breasts are their qi cavity. When yin reaches its extreme and transforms into yang, it transmutes from the qi cavity into yin blood and flows outward in form. Thus, severing the Red Dragon must begin where yin arises, and through long practice, the form will naturally recede. If one mistakenly points to the qi cavity one *cun* and three *fen* below a man’s navel, it is an error.

Xu Zu said: ‘When men cultivate, they achieve non-leakage of essence; when women cultivate, they achieve non-leakage of menses.’ For women, the menses are the first sign of life’s beginning. When the menses return to qi, the breasts shrink like a man’s, and the menses naturally cease to leak. For men, refining essence into qi causes the yin root to shrink like a boy’s, and essence naturally ceases to leak. Only after non-leakage can life be extended. It is also said: ‘When a woman cultivates to the point where the menses do not leak, her subsequent work on nature and life is largely the same as men’s, with only minor differences. The concern is that no one reveals the secrets to unlock its wonders!’

The practice of the yielding differs from that of the firm, yet their success may come more easily than for the firm. The firm may take three years to subdue qi; the yielding may achieve it in one, for the elixir is within the body. Yuanjun Sun Bu’er said:
‘Men and women are originally one qi, differing in purity and turbidity, movement and stillness. If a woman wishes to cultivate the real, she must gather her true origin. Within yin lies primordial yang—preserve clarity and do not discard it. Understand that form and desire are originally without encumbrance.’”

"Banish greed, wrath, and delusion; sever the bonds of care and anxiety.
Refine the turbid to cultivate pure nature, and you shall not fall into evil destinies.
Abide in stillness and embrace non-action—thus do I possess the qualities of a man.
Non-being has no form; being has its meaning.
Inwardly perceive form and sound as empty, with not even a hair’s attachment.
Rely on earth as the foundation of Kun; the primal yang arises from the ground.
Lead and mercury are not the same, yet qi and spirit share a single principle.
The vast and numinous heart—mind and spirit can govern it.
When the one qi returns to spring harmony, it soars beyond the clouds.
Accompanying you to wander the Great Clarity—this is called the gatha of true suchness.

The Way of Qian is movement; the Way of Kun is stillness.
To cultivate nature and life, one must begin with stillness.
You are originally still—why then seek to cultivate?
The Way of Kun is turbid; the Way of Qian is pure.
To cultivate nature and life, one must seek purity.
Only by refining the turbid into the pure can one enter the Dao and attain fruition.

The *Scripture of the Divine Embryo’s Longevity and Function* states:
‘After success, in men the qi of the Gate of Life gathers essence; in women the womb’s moisture does not congeal into an infant. Though desire stirs, it cannot contend with spirit.’
This is the true essence returning to spirit in the midst of forming the embryo—this is the Highest Clarity."
