**The Seven Refutations: Refuting the Critique of Non-Debate**

Master Lu, having received the teaching of *xingming* from the sagely master, attracted scholars from all directions who sought him to inquire into the Dao. When seated in discussion, if their words failed to align, he would engage in repeated debate. Some criticized him, saying: “The ancient sages declared, ‘Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Those who are good do not debate; those who debate are not good.’ Now, sir, in your discussions of the Dao with others, your mouth chatters incessantly—does this not waste words and harm virtue?”

He replied: “I am at fault. Permit me to explain. In former times, Yang Zhu and Mo Di’s doctrines obstructed benevolence and righteousness, so Mencius refuted them with words. Gongsun Chou asked, ‘Outsiders all say you delight in debate—may I ask why?’ Mencius replied, ‘Do I delight in debate? I have no choice!’ Moreover, in an age when the Great Dao prevailed, people spoke no divergent words, scholars held no divergent teachings, and thus the sage dwelled with the world, forgotten in wordlessness. Yet the world could not fully accord with the sage’s intent, so the sage, troubled by this, had no choice but to establish teachings. Consider the *Yinfu*, *Daode*, *Cantong*, and *Wuzhen*—all are the sage’s attested covenants of the Dao, meant to guide the world and all generations into boundless virtue. Yet there are blind and reckless masters who, unable to inherit the sacred scriptures or comprehend their texts, follow their own whims and spread their doctrines to delude the world. Their corruption of hearts and confusion of the true Dao—what greater harm could there be? It is like a place untouched by the great light, where mountain goblins and wild foxes lure people into valleys. If one witnesses this, they must cry out with all their strength to drive them away, fearing that those led astray will perish unawares. How could one conceal the truth and spare their own silence? If, however, you condemn me for self-regard, obstinacy, competitiveness, or love of debate, then I have long failed to vindicate myself before others.”

**Refuting the False**

The world favors petty arts, failing to examine the depth of the Dao. Thus, madmen and charlatans practice their unscrupulous techniques. The profound principles of the mysterious are too abstruse to fathom, leaving the heart without anchor—hence, people readily believe and are easily deceived. Let us briefly survey the false arts of the age:

Some roast the fetus of a pregnant woman to practice grain avoidance; others ingest arsenic or sulfur to ward off cold. Some wield lead swords to open the gates of the body; others cultivate spirit turtles to extend or retract their limbs. Some shake their shoulders and spine until they rattle like rain; others strike their skulls to produce resonant echoes. Some sit motionless as stone; others drum their bellies like thunder. Some hang upside-down like apes; others curl up to sleep like dragons. Some spin lightly as the wind while holding their breath; others sprint like gibbons, their swift steps unmatched. Such examples are too numerous to list, yet none bear any relation to the supreme Dao. Most are mere displays of stubborn skill to embellish their deceptions—what the Realized Master Sima called “cleverly concealing cunning to seek worldly gain.”

Among these, the most egregious fraud is external alchemy and furnace fire. Though silver essence may adhere to the body and be exchanged for minerals, methods of summoning and seizing it abound in the world. Unknowing students mistake this for transmutation. They are gravely mistaken!

Alas, how mistaken! Next in folly are those who engage in acrobatic leaps and dodges, stealing openly like thieves—calling a deer a horse while the master remains oblivious, substituting a sheep for an ox without others noticing. Still worse are the blind who burn and recklessly refine, wasting fire and squandering wealth, frittering away days and months in vain, yet never achieving success. It is not the Dao that misleads people, but people who fail to examine the Dao.

Alas! Without discerning the depth of the Dao, they claim to love it; without recognizing the authenticity of a teacher, they claim to have met one. Thus, madmen and charlatans boldly take the lead, and earnest seekers bow in reverence—what greater shame could there be? For this reason, I have written this discourse. To all my fellow aspirants who cherish the Dao: take heed, take heed! Cease your deluded pursuits early, and seek the true essence soon—for my whip is not to be had.

**On Shattering Attachments**

Consider the nature of things: fruits, foods, vinegars, and wines—anything whose form is broken or seal opened will spoil and cannot endure. The same holds for those who have shattered their bodies. The sages, knowing this, sought what is called the *precelestial true unity* to restore it.

Yet those who now speak of the precelestial do no more than take their already broken bodies, bolt and seal their gates, and forcibly gather and harmonize them, hoping to generate the *true unity* and thereby attain the Dao of longevity and enduring vision. They do not realize that once the true form is broken, the essence, qi, and spirit within the body all transform day by day and month by month, entering the postcelestial. How can the qi of *true unity* remain whole? It is like storing spoiled fruits or sealing opened wine and vinegar, then expecting them not to decay—how could this not be difficult?

This principle is perfectly clear and easily understood. Whether drawing near to the body or far to other things, few analogies are needed to make it plain.

The Way of Returning the Elixir is recorded in the alchemical classics, yet scholars fail to read them thoroughly and ponder their meaning deeply. Instead, they seize upon a word or half a phrase, passing it from mouth to ear, and claim it as true transmission and genuine attainment. Thus they remain deluded their entire lives, clinging to the cultivation of a single element without awakening—how pitiful this is! Moved by compassion for such disciples, I have written this discourse.

The ancient immortals said: *"The form is preserved by the Dao, the life extended by technique."* Nowadays, those who discourse on the Dao are many, but where are the techniques? Let them reflect on this.

**Refuting Heresies**
Among those who expound similar doctrines today, their theories vary. I shall address them all. The "nine-one technique" is undoubtedly heretical. Then there are the teachings of the "precelestial plum," which resemble shadows and echoes, mere semblances. Some may sound plausible, yet they all involve tangible dregs and material substances—no different in essence from the worldly "red lead," only under another name. To regard these as the Dao is, I fear, mistaken.

As for the theories of "detached forms exchanging qi," "plowing the two apertures," "forging the sword by opening the passes," "ascending and descending progressions," some invert the classics to concoct "coiled peaches," others hold jujubes in the mouth to drink "sweet dew," still others crush porcelain and smelt iron to brew "wine," or gather the impure fluids of men and women to mix with yeast, or compound "autumn stone" and call it the "primordial human element." Such practices are manifold, all propagated by heretical masters and crooked scholars, leading the blind to follow the blind. Though they toil from youth to hoary age, they never achieve success, only ruining their virtue and harming their bodies, becoming objects of ridicule—how lamentable!

Moreover, the qi of the precelestial arises from emptiness and nothingness. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped. Those who grope and probe, seeking it through myriad means, only distance themselves further. Where now are the floating and sinking grains and scruples? What I have heard is like the fragrance of orchids and the stench of mugwort—these cannot be stored in the same vessel.

Laozi said: *"Only because of ignorance do none know me."* If there were those in the world who understood these words, my Dao would not be solitary.

**Refuting Doubts**
Some may object: *"The ancients said, ‘A word or half a phrase can penetrate the mysteries—what need for thousands of scrolls of alchemical classics?’ They meant that fine words are not to be prized. Yet you instruct people to read the classics extensively, to thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and deeply fathom the workings of creation. Does this not waste time and obstruct the mind with mere knowledge?"*

*"I have grasped my master’s teaching—with a word or half a phrase, I can follow it to enter the Way. Why read so much?"*

I reply: *"Your words sound reasonable, but you do not know that the Dao has orthodoxy and heterodoxy, and masters have truth and falsehood. Without the Dharma-eye, how will you distinguish them?"*

It is like testing gold, which must be done with a touchstone. The alchemical classics are the touchstone of the masters of our age. Without diligent study and deep reflection, merely relying on a word or half a phrase from a master to seek the Dao—how few will avoid straying into heretical sects and being misled by strange doctrines!

Once, a man wished to travel to the capital. He asked for directions along the way, but each person gave different answers. Fearful, he dared not proceed. One day, in the marketplace, he found a road atlas. Clutching it, he set forth, and every detail—where to lodge, where to trade, the sequence of passes and inns—matched perfectly. Only then did he realize the difference between written records and oral transmission—how vast as heaven and earth!

The alchemical classics are the road atlas to entering the Dao. Now, if one sets aside these classics and seeks only phrases from contemporary masters, it is like discarding the atlas and asking passersby for directions—how can one avoid error on the way to the capital?

Moreover, a word or half a phrase as a secret transmission depends on a true master. You wish to find a master—but where is the master?

**Refuting Ignorance**

Those who now pursue the Dao generally invite alchemists, kindle furnace fires, and hope for transmutation or elixirs to ingest—this they call "external alchemy." Yet they do not realize that such pursuits arise from deluded intentions. Once delusion takes root, deluded companions gather. Thus, cunning impostors seize every gap and crevice, swapping horses for oxen, robbing one face-to-face, yet none awaken to the deceit. Should one attempt to enumerate such cases, even a hundred hands would not suffice.

In my early days, before grasping my master’s teachings, I nearly fell prey to these charlatans. By heaven’s grace, I avoided ruin, and so I write this treatise to bequeath to later generations.

As for furnace alchemy, do not claim it does not exist—it serves as verification for the golden elixir. As the *Cantong Qi* states: “Furnace alchemy is truly grounded in reality. Only when one thoroughly comprehends yin and yang, deeply penetrates the workings of creation, does its wondrous application become apparent.” For furnace alchemy refines qi just as inner refinement does. The pairing of elements, the mechanism of gathering, the nurturing and birth—all follow the same principles. The essentials lie in discerning their ascent and descent, knowing their maturity and tenderness; only then may one approach the elixir’s path.

Yet those who discourse on furnace alchemy today know not what lead and mercury truly are, where their weights lie, or where the true earth resides. They recklessly combine common cinnabar and mercury, mix them with the Eight Stones, boil them with myriad herbs. Some extract lead’s bloom to forge "water gold," others seize cinnabar’s spirit to make "yellow sulfur," or strip cinnabar’s husk to craft "heavenly sulfur." Still others gather menstrual blood to embrace mercury; or mine tin and ore, playing with the sun’s decline, calling these "true lead," "true mercury," "true earth"—claiming the world scarcely knows, weaving a thousand threads into one method. Each follows their own mind, hoards their "treasure," and cunningly sells it, leaving the world unaware. Those who heed them suffer losses beyond words.

Moreover, the Way of the golden elixir is treasured by heaven. To seek it requires external protection and both method and resources in harmony—this may suffice. But to peddle it to others for gifts and gratitude—what justification is there? To trust a man without detecting his fraud, to employ his methods without examining their principles—is this not folly? To repeat the errors of the past—is this not folly? To neglect cultivating virtue yet crave undeserved blessings—is this not folly?

Thus, fortunes are exhausted, wives and children left hungry and poor. Even if one’s aspirations remain unfulfilled, how can success be hoped for? Alas, of ten who fall into the immortal elder’s prediction, nine meet this fate! How perilous!

The Way of external elixirs depends on human effort for its practice, but on heaven for its completion. Its understanding rests on wisdom, its coagulation on good fortune. Its secrets lie with the master, its clarity with one’s own discernment—there is not a hair’s breadth that can be borrowed from another. If one can cultivate virtue in seclusion, bind kindred spirits in silent accord, so that virtue moves heaven and earth and sincerity stirs gods and spirits, then when the time comes to tend the furnace, one may be assured of no mishap. Otherwise, even with correct methods and keen insight, how can one withstand demonic trials?

I have personally undergone these trials and verified them through experience; now I dare not conceal them. For fear that others, unaware, may act recklessly, meet with failure, and grow disheartened—it is not the Way that betrays them, but their own ignorance of it. Yet if one can know it without acting, act without employing it, or employ it without selfishness, that would be even better!

**Breaking Delusion Treatise**
The Way of the golden elixir prizes true knowledge and early cultivation. Thus, the Pure Yang Master said: *"To begin swift practice is already too late."* Yet people, unaware, cling to the Supreme Lord’s saying that one may return at any of the one hundred and twenty years. In their prime, they drown in the river of love, entangled in the dusty net of the world, failing to break free, day and night squandering their essence. Only when the road darkens and ends do they turn to the Way, as a last resort. Unaware that time waits for no one, that the hexagram’s count is complete, that medicinal ingredients are depleted, and the foundation of support is gone—even if they meet a master who knows the medicine, the moment of karmic opportunity has already slipped by. White-haired and unaccomplished, they can only sigh in vain. How lamentable!

Thus, Master Purple Yang’s *Awakening to Reality* opens by comparing time to a spark struck from stone and life to a floating bubble—his warning is profound and urgent. Some ask about the *Yellow Court*’s one hundred and twenty years. I say: "In high antiquity, people were simple and affairs few; marriages came late."

Like fertile fields whose strength is not yet exhausted, late planting may still yield a harvest. But now the soil is barren and depleted, and cultivation comes too late—thus the sprouts fail to flower, and the flowers bear no fruit. No wonder it is so.

Moreover, people of past and present cannot be compared, for the qi of the age makes it so. How then can one judge the ancients by the standards of today?
