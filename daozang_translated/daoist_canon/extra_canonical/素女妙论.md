# 素女妙论

**The Wondrous Discourse of the Plain Girl**

**(1) The Origin Chapter**

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor questioned the Plain Girl, saying: "I have heard that in high antiquity, sages lived to a thousand years, or eight hundred years, or even two hundred years. In middle antiquity, sages lived to one hundred and twenty years. Yet in our present age, some perish at thirty or twenty, others at five or seven, and still others at two or three. Those who enjoy ease are few, while those afflicted by illness are many. What is the reason for this? I humbly beseech you to enlighten me, and pray do not withhold the essentials."

The Plain Girl replied: "All human life begins when the father’s essence and mother’s blood unite, coalescing the four elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—to form the body. The causes of long or short life are manifold. Those who die at two or three, five or seven, or twelve or thirteen years do so because their parents conceived without observing prohibitions, thus giving birth to short-lived children. Those who perish at twenty or thirty possess inherently weak constitutions, lacking robust vitality from the start. Failing to study the arts of nourishing life, they reach youth and vigor, their blood and qi at their peak, yet become ensnared by desire. Their essence and qi dissipate, illnesses multiply, and ignorant of remedies, they squander their root and origin. How then can they hope for longevity?"

The Emperor asked: "When the Supreme Ultimate divided, yin and yang first separated—light and pure became heaven, turbid and heavy became earth. The Dao of Qian formed man, the Dao of Kun formed woman. Humanity dwells between them, and all things arise. What exists without yin and yang? Without yin and yang, heaven’s sun and moon would not shine, earth’s myriad things would not grow, and humanity’s ethical relations would cease. The mutual resonance of yin and yang cannot be absent for a single day. Yet I remain unclear about your words. Pray expound in full the essentials of the union of man and woman, and the methods of treating illness, to aid human longevity."

The Plain Girl replied: "How profound! How profound! The union of man and woman is the Dao of one yin and one yang. Thus, within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin. The interplay of yin and yang, male and female, is the Dao of heaven and earth. Yet if its essentials are lost, illness arises." She continued: "Embracing yin while bearing yang, when yang reaches its peak, yin is born; when yin reaches its peak, yang sprouts. Within a woman’s yin, yin and yang naturally reside, each possessing firmness and softness, each with its own delightful pleasures."

The Emperor asked: "I have heard the Dao of conjugal union, yet its deeper meaning eludes me. When husband and wife unite, they often fail to attain mutual joy. I wish to hear of this."

The Plain Girl replied: "The Dao of conjugal union, the methods of replenishing essence and absorbing qi, the principles of massage and guiding exercises—these return one to the root and restore the origin, deeply anchoring and firmly securing it, yielding enduring harmony. Without the method of absorbing yin, mere coupling is labor in vain, failing to achieve blissful delight. It remains obscure, unable to convey the joy of mutual pleasure, for people do not cherish this Dao. If one practices this method, it is truly the secret essential of nourishing life. In the union of man and woman, the woman’s yin naturally holds wondrous pleasures, yet few know its subtleties. Thus, they often merely stir their passions, leading to mutual dissatisfaction. Exhausting themselves in vain union, they find no delight. If a woman’s essence has not yet arisen and her yin is dry, should the man force himself upon her, his jade stem will labor in vain, drilling into emptiness, wearying his spirit without benefit. Or if the woman’s fire of desire is already kindled yet the man’s jade stem lacks firmness, his essence departs prematurely, leaving his intent unfulfilled. The woman’s heart remains ungratified, and resentment arises."

**(2) The Nine Postures Chapter**

The Emperor asked: "Man and woman embody humanity’s great desire and the source of all things’ transformation. Yet those who neglect this fail to grasp its essentials—is this not the reason?"

Su Nü replied: "Such words are prudent and subtle, yet the foolish deem them lewd, mistaking them for teachings that incite lust and guide desire. In truth, they are wondrous arts of nurturing life. The secret techniques of union comprise nine methods, each named accordingly:

First, the Dragon Soaring Posture;
Second, the Tiger Striding Posture;
Third, the Ape Seizing Posture;
Fourth, the Cicada Clinging Posture;
Fifth, the Tortoise Rising Posture;
Sixth, the Phoenix Soaring Posture;
Seventh, the Hare Suckling Posture;
Eighth, the Fish Kissing Posture;
Ninth, the Crane Mating Posture."

The Emperor asked: "I have now heard the names of the nine postures, but are there methods to their practice?"

Su Nü replied: "Each posture has its own method, modeled after the forms of creatures, hence their collective name, the Nine Postures.

**First, the Dragon Soaring Posture.**
Have the woman lie supine, her body flat, both feet raised toward the sky. The man lies atop her, resting upon her thighs, and takes her tongue into his mouth. The woman lifts her *yin* gate herself to receive the jade stem as it pierces the Mysterious Gate. Withdrawing, he presses against her gate, then raises his body and sways in motion, employing the method of eight deep and six shallow thrusts. Thus, the *yin* within grows ardently hot, the yang member becomes firm and strong, man delights and woman rejoices, both hearts find joy and pleasure, and a hundred ailments vanish. Its method resembles the coiled dragon awakening and ascending the clouds.

**Second, the Tiger Striding Posture.**
Have the woman kneel on all fours, her head lowered. The man crouches behind her, embracing her waist as he inserts the jade stem into the *yin* gate, employing the method of five shallow and six deep thrusts. Withdrawing a hundred times, the jade vise opens wide, essence and saliva overflow, and water and fire achieve harmony, fulfilling the wonders of the cinnabar crucible. Vexation and oppression are dispelled, blood and vessels flow freely, the heart is nourished, and the will is strengthened. Its method resembles the tiger or leopard emerging from the forest to roar in the wind."

**Third, the Ape Seizing Posture.**
Have the woman spread her thighs and sit upon the man’s legs, the *yin* gate opening smooth and slick. Insert the jade pestle, tapping the *yin* portal several times, then employ the method of nine shallow and five deep thrusts. The woman murmurs without cease, her fluids overflowing, while the man secures his yang treasury to prevent spillage. A hundred ailments vanish at once, qi is replenished, and one attains longevity without hunger. Its method resembles the ape snatching fruit from the branches—swiftness is its greatest marvel.

**Fourth, the Cicada Clinging Posture.**
Have the woman straighten her left thigh while bending her right. The man crouches behind her, drawing the jade scepter to strike her crimson pearl, employing the method of seven deep and eight shallow thrusts. The red jewel swells wide, pleasure surging in lively waves, reaching the height of fluid motion. It unblocks and harmonizes the meridians, benefiting the practitioner over time. Its method resembles the golden cicada clinging to the tree, sipping dew in clear song—holding within, never releasing.

**Fifth, the Turtle Ascending Posture.**
Have the woman lie supine, serene and empty, as if forgetting all passion. The man uses his fingers to lift her legs, raising them past her breasts, then extends his head to suddenly enter the red gate, plunging deep to strike the valley’s fruit. Now retracting, now extending, like the turtle’s head drawing in and out. It dispels lingering heat and expels evil qi from the five viscera. Its method resembles the dark turtle gliding through the waters, its hard shell self-guarding, tail trailing in the mud to preserve its essence.

**Sixth, the Phoenix Soaring Posture.**
Have the woman lie sideways upon the bed, hands lifting her own thighs. The man tightly embraces her waist with both hands, inserting the golden pestle into the jade gate, thrusting left and right until the *yin* grows fiery and the woman’s body softens and stirs. Employing the method of nine shallow and eight deep thrusts, she delights with gentle gasps, slick fluids boiling forth. It replenishes all deficiencies, fills the marrow, lightens the body, and grants ageless longevity. Its method resembles the auspicious phoenix of Mount Dan beating its wings to soar through the heavens.

**Seventh, the Hare Suckling Posture.**
First, have the man lie supine upon the bed, legs stretched straight. The woman then straddles him backward, grasping the jade stalk to probe the chamber’s gate, threading the zither strings. Once the jade stem stands firm, she employs the method of shallow and deep thrusts, thereby nourishing blood, circulating qi, and relieving soreness in the four limbs. Its method resembles the jade hare’s swift leaps—now crouching, now bounding, appearing and vanishing unpredictably. So long as one does not lose their essence, they may seize the toad’s spirit in the ninefold heavens.

**Eighth, the Fish Kissing Posture.**
Have two women, one supine and one prone, embrace each other in the act of union. Their *yin* gates meet and naturally rub together, like fish mouths opening as they nibble at duckweed. The man sits to one side, awaiting the crimson tide’s rise. First, he explores the meeting point with his hand, then positions the stem between them, seizing the moment to insert it into both, uniting them in shared pleasure. It greatly strengthens sinews and bones, doubles one’s vigor, warms the center, and remedies the five taxations and seven injuries. Its method resembles fish frolicking among the waterweeds—sipping the clear and spitting the turbid is its essential principle.

**Ninth, the Crane Mating Posture.**
Have the woman embrace the man’s neck, her right foot resting upon the bed. The man lifts her left thigh with his right hand, hoisting it onto his shoulder, their bodies pressed close. Gently withdrawing the jade stalk, he gazes at her water caltrop teeth, then slowly strikes the valley’s fruit, swaying lightly and unhurriedly. Employing the method of nine shallow and one deep thrust, the flower’s heart suddenly opens, its fragrant fluids soaking through. It preserves the center and guards the spirit, aids digestion and whets the appetite, cures a hundred illnesses, and grants life without hunger. Its method resembles the red-crowned crane’s circling dance—wings outstretched without folding, naturally attaining the wondrous realm.

**(3) On Depth and Shallow Thrusts**
The Emperor asked: “The regulation of fire through shallow and deep thrusts is the essential principle of refining the elixir. Yet if the adjustment is improper, each may suffer harm—how is this so?”

Lady Su answered: “Shallow thrusts that fall short provoke frustration, while deep thrusts that exceed bring remorse. There are also thirty-six postures and seventy-two variations that can harmonize sweet affection and enhance delight, though their principles run deep.”

The Emperor asked: “In the Dao of coupling between man and woman, the practice of shallow and deep thrusts often causes harm, with few benefits. I have heard there exists a secret art of ‘gathering and replenishing’ to extend human life—pray, reveal its details.”

Lady Su answered: “A man must observe a woman’s emotions and also firmly guard his own treasure, never allowing careless leakage. First, rub both palms until warm, then firmly grasp the jade stalk. Next, employ the method of shallow withdrawals and deep entries, enduring prolonged engagement to heighten pleasure. One must not be too hasty nor too slow, nor plunge to the utmost depth, for excess depth brings harm.

Strike the ‘lute string’ and assault the ‘water caltrop teeth.’ When pleasure reaches its peak, the woman unconsciously clenches her teeth, fragrant sweat breaks forth, breath quickens, eyes close, face flushes, the fragrant pistil fully opens, and slick fluids overflow—this is the utmost pinnacle of blissful cultivation.

Moreover, within the woman’s yin there are eight names, also called the ‘Eight Valleys’:
First, the *Lute String*, one *cun* deep;
Second, the *Water Caltrop Teeth*, two *cun* deep;
Third, the *Secure Nest*, three *cun* deep;
Fourth, the *Mysterious Pearl*, four *cun* deep;
Fifth, the *Valley’s Fruit*, five *cun* deep;
Sixth, the *Healing Gate*, six *cun* deep;
Seventh, the *Gate of Kun*, seven *cun* deep;
Eighth, the *Northern Pole*, eight *cun* deep.”

The Emperor asked, “What illnesses arise from harm caused by intercourse?”

Su Nü replied, “The essence of union lies in avoiding excessive depth, for deep penetration injures the five viscera. If it reaches the *Valley’s Fruit*, the liver is harmed, giving rise to dimmed vision, eye discharge, tears, and paralysis of the limbs. If it reaches the *Healing Gate*, the lungs are harmed, causing nausea, retching, phlegm, wheezing, and dizziness. If it reaches the *Gate of Kun*, the spleen is harmed, resulting in a sallow complexion, abdominal distension, restlessness, and cold dysentery. If it reaches the *Northern Pole*, the kidneys are harmed, leading to weakness in the waist and legs, bone steaming, and tidal fever. Sudden shifts between shallow and deep penetration injure the heart, causing facial heat, consumptive cough, nightmares, and seminal emission. Thus, intercourse must not be too deep. The woman’s cinnabar cavity lies three *cun* below the navel—take care not to injure it. Nor should it be too swift or too slow: excessive speed harms the blood, while excessive slowness depletes the *qi*, both bringing harm without benefit.”

The Emperor asked, “Having grasped the essentials of regulating the ‘fire phase’ and adjusting depth, one must not overlook the principles of harm. Are there further prohibitions to be observed? Pray, do not withhold them.”

Lady Su answered: “In refining the elixir, one must avoid taboos. If these are mistakenly violated, at worst Heaven and Earth will strip away one’s allotted years, spirits will bring calamity upon the body, and the Three Peng will spy an opening to cling to illness and misfortune. The children born will be short-lived, dull-witted, or unfilial—some will be obstinate and vicious, bringing harm to their parents. How can one not be cautious?

When Heaven and Earth are dark and trembling, during thunderclaps, fierce winds, or violent storms, on the last and first days of the lunar month, the crescent and full moons, in extreme cold or scorching heat, during solar or lunar eclipses, on the birthdays of sages and deities, the days of *gengshen* and *jiazi*, one’s own natal day, the Three Primordials and Eight Festivals, the fifth day of the fifth month, days of lunar inauspiciousness or affliction, or under the baleful influences of *pima* and *hongsha*—on all these, one must not transgress.

Moreover, near the altars of Heaven and Earth, the Five Peaks, rivers and streams, sacred shrines, or before images of deities and spirits, as well as beside wells, stoves, drains, or latrines—each of these places brings harm, often causing early death or the birth of children with monstrous or bizarre forms. There are also taboos to observe during intercourse:

Do not transgress when ravenously hungry, overly sated, severely intoxicated, mentally exhausted or physically fatigued, grieving, sorrowful, or terrified. Do not transgress when newly recovered from illness, in mourning, or when the woman is menstruating.” *(Section Four: The Five Desires and Five Harms)*

The Emperor asked: “Those who exert themselves in youth and vigor may yet face decline and decay. Excessive joy must bring sorrow in its wake. The perfected person regulates these through the Dao, and thus it is said that one who masters the union with a hundred women may attain a lifespan matching Heaven and Earth. Yet today, men do not reach half a century before their sinews wither, their flesh sags, their fire rages while their water dries, and they become ruined beings—why is this?”

The Plain Girl replied: “In all people, there are the five desires, five harms, and ten signs of arousal. If these are managed appropriately, the mind is satisfied and desire fulfilled; if mismanaged, each brings its own harm.

**The Five Signs of Desire:**
1. When the face flushes crimson, the mind harbors thoughts of desire. First, let the jade stem enter, then gently rock and slowly withdraw, often at the gate’s threshold, to gauge her inclination.
2. When breath escapes through the nostrils, the fire of desire stirs faintly. Let the jade stem penetrate the jade gate and pierce the valley’s fruit, but not too deeply—wait for the fire to reach its proper moment.
3. When the throat grows parched, passion blazes. Withdraw the jade stem and await the moment when her eyes close, her tongue extends, and her breath comes in gasps. Then move freely, gradually ascending to bliss.
4. When the red pearl glistens with moisture, the heart’s fire burns fiercely. Piercing it will cause slickness to overflow. Lightly touch the water caltrop teeth, alternating left and right, slow and swift, following her rhythm as the method dictates.
5. When the golden lotus clings in embrace, the fire has reached its fullness. Her feet must coil around his waist, her hands clasp his shoulders and back, her tongue extend without retreat. Then pierce the jade gate ever more deeply, and all four limbs will know perfect ease.

**The Five Signs of Harm:**
1. If the jade gate remains closed and unopened, do not pierce it, for this harms the lungs. Lung injury brings phlegm and wheezing, a hoarse voice.
2. When passion has risen but the jade stem wilts and softens, and union occurs only after desire has waned, this harms the heart. Heart injury disrupts the menstrual flow.
3. When a young yin joins with an aged yang, the fire of desire burns in vain without fulfillment, this harms the liver. Liver injury brings dizziness and dimmed vision.
4. When desire is sated and passion fulfilled, yet the yang fire does not subside, this harms the kidneys. Kidney injury leads to vaginal discharge and flooding.
5. When the monthly affliction is not yet ended and one is compelled to union, this harms the spleen. Spleen injury causes the complexion to wither and yellow.

**The Ten Signs of Arousal:**
1. When she embraces the man’s back with her jade hands, her lower body moves of its own accord, and she extends her tongue to cling close—this is the sign that the man’s passion is stirred and desire awakened.
2. When her fragrant body lies supine, limbs outstretched and still, and her breath comes in faint, urgent gasps—this is the sign that she awaits piercing and withdrawal.
3. When she extends her wrist, opens her palm, and grasps the sleeping man’s jade mallet, turning it—this is the sign of drooling desire.
4. When she chatters playfully, her eyes beckon and her brows signal, and she occasionally utters sighs of longing—this is the sign that spring passion has reached its peak.
5. When she clasps her golden lotuses with both hands, baring the gate of the mysterious valley—this is the sign of ripened passion and swift delight.
6. When she holds the jade scepter in her mouth, appearing drunk or drowsy, and her yin itches within—this is the sign for shallow and deep thrusts.
7. When she stretches her golden lotuses long, hooking and drawing the jade mallet, advancing and retreating, and softly moans—this is the sign that the yin tide surges.
8. When she suddenly attains her desire, subtly arches her waist, her fragrant sweat not yet dried, and a smile lingers—this is the sign that yang qi is spent and passion exhausted.
9. When sweet passion has arrived, bliss grows ever greater, essence is released, yet she still clings tightly—this is the sign that her desire is not yet fulfilled.
10. When her body grows hot and sweat soaks her, her feet slacken and her hands slow—this is the sign that passion has reached its peak and her wish is satisfied.” *(Section Five: The Great Principle)*

The Emperor asked, “Of the great human relations, none precedes husband and wife, for only then may there be descendants. Should not a wife’s virtue and a wife’s beauty be carefully chosen?”

Su Nü replied, “A wife’s virtue is inner beauty; a wife’s appearance is outer beauty. First observe her skin, then her inner qualities. If a woman’s hair is scorched and black, her bones large and flesh coarse, her plumpness or leanness immoderate, her height unusual, or her age mismatched, she will not bear descendants. If her speech is bold and forceful, her temper sudden and violent, her yin dry and rough, her womb cold, or if she suffers from dripping discharge, red or white turbidity, or foul odor, she greatly harms yang qi.”

The Emperor asked, “I have heard of the harm to yang qi. Some seek to remedy this with medicinal tonics—what of this?”

Su Nü replied, “The union of man and woman is not for wanton pleasure. People today, ignorant of cultivation and self-nurturance, force themselves in the act, thus often depleting essence and exhausting qi, giving rise to illness. Some, through mistaken diet or reckless consumption of medicines, injure their nature and forfeit their lives—how truly lamentable!”

The Emperor asked, “The Way of husband and wife is for the sake of descendants, yet now there are those who bear no children—why is this?”

Su Nü replied, “There are three types of women who bear no children, and three types of men who bear no children. Men whose essence is cold and slippery, those who indulge excessively in dissipation and depletion, or those who falter and shrink back when facing the act—these bear no children. Women whose nature is wanton and stirred by mere sight, whose womb is depleted and cold or whose womb-gate does not open, or whose jealousy burns like fire—these bear no children.”

The Emperor asked, “If a person has no children, by what method may they be obtained?”

Su Nü replied, “The method for seeking children follows the numbers of yin and yang conjunction. Use yellow gauze, yellow silk, or yellow damask to make clothing, bedding, curtains, and quilts. On an auspicious day of the yellow Dao, take a peach branch and inscribe the year and stem-branch of birth, placing it within the bedchamber. Also, on the third day of the ninth month, take a peach branch extending eastward, inscribe the names upon it, and insert it above the bed. One must then observe when the woman’s monthly flow has ceased for three or four days. Both should bathe, burn incense, and pray to Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits. Then, entering the curtains, they may unite in the act. At that time, the womb-gate has not yet closed, and thus a child may be conceived.

The method of union: advance and withdraw in accordance with the proper way, purify the heart and cleanse the mind. Do not engage in playful teasing or wanton frolic, do not rely on aphrodisiacs, and do not view erotic illustrations. If these are violated, it harms the parents and is unfavorable for bearing children.”

The Emperor asked, “The Way of yin and yang is called ‘union’—why is this so?”

Su Nü replied, “When yin and yang unite, the man emits and the woman receives—hence it is called ‘union.’ Within the woman’s yin there are natural signs: without striking the zither’s strings or reaching the water caltrop’s teeth, the utmost pleasure is attained, and the true treasure is revealed. When yin blood envelops yang essence, a son is born; when yang essence envelops yin blood, a daughter is born. This is the Way of yin-yang union.”

The Emperor asked, “Union is the origin of human relations. Yet why do some fail to harmonize and delight in one another?”

Su Nü replied, “This arises because women cannot discern their husbands’ intentions, and men do not understand their wives’ nature—thus they fail to grasp the Way of human relations and the principle of procreation and lineage. Each may be stubborn and licentious, each harboring dissatisfaction, mutually fostering resentment. Some abandon their own wives to recklessly consort with other women, while others deceive their husbands to engage in illicit unions. Some men suffer from impotence and fail to satisfy desire, while others possess unyielding virility without respite—eventually leading to mutual aversion.”

The Emperor asked, “When husband and wife are intimate, respectful, and loving, this is the norm of human relations. Yet from what does such reverence and love arise?”

Su Nü replied, “When the union is harmonious, it is aligned with the Dao; when it is discordant, it runs counter to it. When the Eight Characters align and youth and vigor meet in due time, this is alignment with the Dao. When the Eight Characters clash and age and youth fail to meet, this is counter to it. When talent and beauty are both complete and temperaments harmonize, this is alignment with the Dao. When the dull and ugly turn their backs on each other and cruelty and hostility arise, this is counter to it. Yet when affection and mutual accord take root, reverence and respect arise; with reverence and respect come wealth, nobility, longevity, and flourishing descendants.”

**6. On Size and Proportion**
The Emperor asked, “Why do men’s treasures differ in size, length, hardness, and softness?”

Su Nü replied, “Their forms are bestowed differently, just as human faces vary. The distinctions in size, length, hardness, and softness all depend on one’s endowment. Thus, a man may be short yet his treasure mighty, or robust yet his treasure small; lean and weak yet firm and hard, or stout and large yet soft and shrinking. Some resemble a carriage axle, others can be embraced, and still others swell with flesh and bulging veins—yet none of these hinder the essentials of union.”

The Emperor asked, “Since men’s members differ in size, length, hardness, and softness, do the methods for achieving pleasurable union also differ?”

Su Nü replied, “Different endowments in size, length, and form are external matters; the key to pleasurable union lies in the inner disposition. First bind them with love and respect, then guide them with sincerity—what need is there to debate size, length, or proportion?”

The Emperor asked, “Do hardness and softness also differ in their effects?”

Su Nü replied, “Long and large yet limp and soft is inferior to short and small yet firm and hard. Firm and hard yet coarse and violent is not as good as soft and weak yet gentle and considerate. One who attains the mean may be called perfect in both beauty and goodness.”

The Emperor asked, “Those who practice external arts may use medicines to enlarge the small or stiffen the soft. Do such methods risk future harm, or do they offer strengthening benefits?”

Su Nü replied, “When two hearts unite and qi flows unimpeded, the small naturally grows larger and the soft naturally hardens. Those who master the Dao can achieve this, coupling with a hundred women without wilting. Through cultivation and nurturing, one may use yin to assist yang, regulate breath through inhalation and exhalation, draw water to quench fire, and secure the true treasure—remaining unsated through the night without emission. Practiced over time, this prolongs life and dispels illness. But if one resorts to minerals to invigorate yang or seal oil to stoke the fire, the false flame burns alone, true yang withers and dries—such harm is not insignificant.”

The Emperor asked, “Are even those who practice cultivation unrestrained?”

Su Nü replied, “Qi circulates in cycles; one should unite when the time is right and cease when the moment passes, expending only what one’s strength allows. To force or indulge in excess is to invite exhaustion and ruin, even for those who cultivate. ‘Taking medicine for three days is not as good as sleeping alone for one night’—such was the warning of the sages of old.”

---

**7. On Nurturing Life**

The Emperor asked, “In the Way of nurturing life, what is the foundation?”

Su Nü replied, “The Way of nurturing life takes qi as its foundation. Qi moves the blood, blood transforms into essence, essence nourishes the spirit—where the spirit abides, there is life; where the spirit scatters, there is death. Qi is the root of the spirit. One who refines qi enters fire without burning, enters water without drowning. Firmly guarding essence without dissipation, one may lie with a woman through the night without emission. But those who cannot preserve their spirit and act recklessly will surely lose their spirit and forfeit their qi—this is called the axe that severs life.”

The Emperor asked, “If one adheres solely to the Way of nurturing life and neglects the rites of the bedchamber between husband and wife, human relations will be severed, and posterity will be cut off.”

Su Nü replied, “In youth, when blood and qi are not yet full, one must guard against excess in desire and avoid violent depletion. In the prime of life, when essence and qi overflow, forcibly restraining essence and suppressing desire will give rise to strange illnesses. Thus, one must not refrain entirely, nor go to excess, nor fall short.”

The Emperor asked, “If one times emissions to dispel arousal, can one preserve essence and nourish the spirit?”

Su Nü replied, “It is not so.”

If one regularly emits but occasionally retains, sores and ulcers may arise; if one habitually restrains but suddenly releases, one may suffer sudden depletion—both harm the Way of nurturing life.”

The Emperor asked, “How can one know when a man’s essence and blood are full and his spirit and qi are abundant?”

Su Nü replied, “At sixteen, when *tian gui* arrives, a man’s blood and qi are still insufficient, and his spirit unsettled—thus he must be cautioned. By twenty, his blood and qi gradually flourish, and his essence gathers in the intestines and stomach, to be emitted once every thirty days. At thirty, when his blood and qi are robust, his essence resides in the thighs, to be emitted once every five days. At forty, his essence gathers in the lumbar spine, to be emitted once every seven days. At fifty, as his blood and qi begin to wane, his essence collects in the back and spine, to be emitted once every fifteen days. By sixty-four, *tian gui* is exhausted, the hexagram’s measure is complete, his blood and qi decline, and his seminal essence is spent. After sixty, if one can preserve residual qi and remain vigorous, emission is still possible. By seventy, one must not recklessly indulge in desire or stir the passions.”

The Emperor asked, “How is it that some reckless youths, relying on their strength, emit three or even five times a day?”

Su Nü replied, “Excessive emission leads to sudden depletion, and later, impotence and debility. If one emits without respite, one invites early death.”

The Emperor asked, “Why does a man’s yang qi rise vigorously at night, stirring arousal?”

Su Nü replied, “Morning, noon, dusk, and night—these are the four seasons within a day. Thus, yang qi begins to stir at the *zi* hour, corresponding to the hexagram *Fu* (Return); by the *chou* hour, a second yang arises below, corresponding to *Lin* (Approach); by the *yin* hour, the three yang are complete, corresponding to *Tai* (Peace). If one emits violently at midnight, yang essence will wither and deplete—before fifty, one will surely suffer dizziness, visceral pain, dimmed vision, and blocked ears. There are also five injuries: first, if a man emits little during intercourse, it injures his qi; second, if his essence flows sluggishly, it injures his flesh; third, if emission is painful, it injures his sinews; fourth, if his essence is viscous, it harms his bones; fifth, if he suddenly wilts at the threshold, drooling, it injures his blood. All these stem from excessive emission and the exhaustion of seminal essence—how can one not be cautious!”

The Emperor asked, “When a man and woman delight in intimacy, how can one discern their feelings before words are spoken? The subtleties are delicate and concealed—by what art may one gauge and arouse their desire?”

Su Nü replied, “Whenever a man seeks to probe a woman’s private feelings, he should first tease her with playful words to stir her intent, then gently touch or press with his hands and feet to kindle her passion. A man has four *arrivals*, and a woman has nine *attainments*—if the four do not arrive and the nine are not attained before coupling, there will surely be later afflictions.”

The Emperor asked, “What are the man’s four *arrivals*?”

Su Nü replied, “If the jade stem is not firm, his yang qi has not arrived; if it is rigid yet unmoving, his flesh qi has not arrived; if it trembles yet does not swell, his bone qi has not arrived; if it swells yet does not endure, his kidney qi has not arrived. Should even one fail to arrive and he proceeds, there will certainly be harm.”

The Emperor asked, “What are the woman’s nine *attainments*?”

Su Nü replied, “If she yawns, stretches, and sighs, drowsy and half-awake, her lung qi has not attained; if her gate is dry and her thighs remain closed, her heart qi has not attained; if her eyes do not roam and her movements lack joy, her spleen qi has not attained; if she touches the jade stem yet her mood remains unpleased, her blood qi has not attained; if her hands are limp and feet sluggish, lying still without response, her sinew qi has not attained; if she fondles her breasts yet finds no delight, her bone qi has not attained; if her gaze flickers faintly yet her oriole mouth stays shut, her liver qi has not attained; if she presses her body toward him yet her peach cheeks do not flush, her kidney qi has not attained; if her jade gate is only slightly moist and her mouth is not parched, her fluid qi has not attained. Only when all nine signs have manifested should one proceed with the method of *nine shallow, one deep*—then yin and yang will harmonize, and passion will entwine. This can aid yang qi and remedy depletion and taxation.”

The Emperor asked, “What is the method of *nine shallow, one deep*?”

Lady Su Nü replied, “Nine shallow insertions followed by one deep thrust—each cycle measured by the span of a breath—this is the method of *nine shallow, one deep*. From the *qin strings* to the *mysterious pearl* is shallow; from the *tuo* to the *valley’s fruit* is deep. Too shallow brings no pleasure, while too deep risks injury.”

The Emperor asked, “The alchemical crucible’s regulation, the subtlety of fire timing, and the marvel of water and fire in harmony—I have heard these in detail. Yet there remains more to this treasury of wisdom. I wish to exhaust its principles, that your boundless benevolence may be bestowed to save the world, sparing all generations from premature demise and the sorrow of depletion or barren lineage.”

Lady Su Nü replied, “When Heaven and Earth unite in harmony, when yin and yang conjoin in action, first observe her ardor and passion, carefully discern whether her qi signs have fully arrived. Master the art of withdrawal and thrust, the subtlety of adding embers—thus securing your own yang storehouse. Embrace with fragrant kisses, drawing in yin essence to replenish yang qi; inhale through the nose to fill the spinal marrow; hold the divine fluids to nourish the cinnabar field. Let the *niwan*’s potent qi penetrate deeply, coursing through the four limbs, overflowing to enrich blood and qi, preserving youth and forestalling age.”

The Emperor asked, “The cultivation of gathering and refining, the forging of the inner elixir—this is the foremost marvel of the Dao. How could those endowed with spirit fail to grasp its principles?”

Lady Su Nü replied, “Indeed, as Your Majesty commands. This is the wondrous essential for prolonging life and enhancing longevity. Now, heaven is deficient in the northwest, thus a man’s yang qi is ever in surplus while his yin blood is insufficient; earth is incomplete in the southeast, thus a woman’s yin blood is replete while her yang qi is lacking. Those who grasp the profound subtleties take the surplus to replenish the deficient—though they reach a hundred years, their joy remains unaltered. Delight and merriment know no end, and long life with enduring vision spans the heavens and earth. It is fitting to inscribe this upon metal and stone, that it may be transmitted to later generations, for the universal relief of virtue and grace shall be no small thing.”

The Emperor purified himself with fasting and ablutions, then refined his inner elixir according to the method for eighty-one days. His years extended to one hundred and twenty, and when the cinnabar medicine was complete, he cast a tripod by the lakeside. A divine dragon descended to welcome him, and together with Lady Su Nü, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.
