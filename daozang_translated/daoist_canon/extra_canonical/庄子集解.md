**Collected Explanations of *Zhuangzi*, Volume One**
**Inner Chapters: "Free and Easy Wandering" (First)**

"To speak of wandering free and unfettered beyond all things, roaming boundlessly by following Heaven’s course.

In the Northern Darkness there is a fish—*Shiwen* notes: 'An alternate version writes this as *Ming*, referring to the Northern Sea'—whose name is Kun. *Shiyu* explains: 'Kun means fish roe.' Fang Yizhi observes: 'Kun originally denotes small fish, but Zhuangzi uses it as the name of a great fish.' The size of Kun is unknown, spanning who knows how many thousands of *li*. It transforms into a bird, whose name is Peng. The back of Peng spans who knows how many thousands of *li*; when it rises in flight, its wings resemble clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will migrate to the Southern Darkness. *Yupian* states: 'Yun means to move.' Note: It moves upon the sea, hence 'sea surge.' Below, it speaks of 'striking the water,' which confirms this. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond. Cheng Xuanying explains: 'The great sea and vast rivers originate from the workings of creation, not from human effort, hence it is called the Celestial Pond.' Note: This describes the vastness of things, roaming by following Heaven’s course.

*Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. Sima Biao says: '*Qi Xie* is the name of a person.' Emperor Jianwen says: 'It is the title of a book.' It states: 'When Peng migrates to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*—Cui Zhuan notes: 'As it prepares to fly, it beats its wings against the water in a staggering motion'—and spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*—Cui explains: 'It flaps its wings and circles upward.' *Erya* states: 'A whirlwind is called a *biao*.' Guo Pu’s commentary: 'A violent wind rising from below.' It departs with the winds of the sixth month.' Cheng explains: 'The sixth month marks half a year; it rests upon reaching the Celestial Pond.' This cites *Qi Xie* as evidence.

The *yema* is—as Sima explains—'the wandering *qi* of marshes in springtime.' Cheng explains: 'In the season of verdant spring, when yang *qi* stirs, gazing afar at the marshes, one sees something like galloping horses, hence it is called *yema*.' Dust and motes—as Cheng explains—'Raised earth is called dust; the finest dust is called motes.' These are the living things blown about by each other’s breath. Cheng explains: 'Between Heaven and Earth, the breath of living things stirs one another.' Note: The *Hanshu* commentary on Yang Xiong’s biography states: '*Xi* refers to the breath of exhalation and inhalation.' This describes the minuteness of things, which also roam by following Heaven’s course. This meaning is introduced here to show that things, whether great or small, all move by following Heaven’s course. The text does not elaborate further under 'Peng,' but makes this point here.

Is the deep blue of Heaven its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? From Peng’s perspective looking down, it would appear the same as when humans look up at Heaven. This—referring to Peng—is roughly the case, hence 'it is thus.' *Shi* refers to Peng; *shi* refers to humans gazing at Heaven. The bird is ninety thousand *li* above, and the numbers are approximate, hence 'it is thus,' not meaning it comes to a halt. By comparing humans gazing at Heaven to Peng gazing below, it illustrates the extreme height of its ascent.

Moreover, if the accumulation of water is not deep, it has no strength to bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor—Zhi Dun explains: 'This refers to a depression in the shape of a mound in the hall'—and a mustard stalk may serve as a boat—Li Yi explains: 'Jie is a small grass'—but place a cup there and it will stick fast—Cui explains: 'It touches the ground'—for the water is shallow and the boat too large. If the accumulation of wind is not deep, it has no strength to bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath it, and only then can it ride the wind. Wang Niansun states: '*Pei* means to rely upon. The *Zhouli* commentary on the *Fengxiangshi* states: '*Feng* means to mount.' Peng is above the wind, hence it speaks of relying upon it. *Pei* and *feng* are similar in sound and meaning. The *Hanshu* biography of Zhou notes that he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Kuai City, and Yan Shigu’s commentary states: 'Lu Ji pronounces *kuai* as *pei*; the *Chu Han Chunqiu* writes it as the Marquis of Feng City.' This is evidence of the closeness in sound between *pei* and *feng*.' With the blue sky on its back and nothing to hinder or block its way—Sima explains: '*Yao* means to break; *e* means to obstruct. There is nothing to break or obstruct its progress.'"

And only then does it now set its course for the south. Planning to journey southward. The water is likened to the wind—only with ample strength can it bear and carry, making clear that things cannot soar without being propelled by *qi*. The cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: "We dart forth in flight, plunging into the elm and sandalwood—sometimes we fall short and simply land upon the earth. Why must one go ninety thousand *li* to the south?" By borrowing the cicada and dove’s mockery, the passage portrays Hui Shi’s likeness. One who travels to the nearby wilderness returns after three meals, with a belly still full; one bound for a hundred *li* lodges overnight to pound grain for provisions; one journeying a thousand *li* gathers three months’ worth of food. These two creatures—referring to the cicada and the dove—what do they know? The analogy is framed for their sake. Lesser understanding does not reach greater understanding; a short lifespan does not compare to a long one. The preceding statement is explicit, while the paired analogies obscure its intent. How does one know this to be so?

The morning mushroom knows not dusk nor dawn; as the *Liezi*’s "Tang’s Questions" states: "Upon rotting soil grow fungi that live at dawn and die at dusk." Dusk refers to night. The cicada knows not spring nor autumn—these are the short-lived. As the commentary notes: "The *hui* cicada, also called the cold cicada or *dili*, is born in spring and dies in summer, or born in summer and dies in autumn." South of Chu lies the *Mingling*, for which five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity grew the great *chun* tree, for which eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn. The passage from "South of Chu" onward is quoted in full from the *Liezi*’s "Tang’s Questions," where "Chu" appears as "Jing." Yet Peng Zu alone is now renowned for his longevity, as Li notes: "Peng Zu, named Keng, was a minister of Yao, enfeoffed at Pengcheng. He lived through Yu and Xia into the Shang, reaching seven hundred years, and thus became known for his long life." That the multitude compares itself to him—is this not lamentable? This section expands upon the "short-lived" passage.

What Tang asked Ji is likewise so. In the "Tang’s Questions," "King Tang of Yin questioned Xia Ji," where Zhang Zhan annotates: "A minister of Tang." *Ji* and *ge* are phonetically interchangeable. In the far north, beyond the uninhabited wilds, lies the Dark Sea—a celestial lake. There dwells a fish, its breadth spanning thousands of *li*, its length unknown, called the *kun*. There soars a bird, called the *peng*, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds trailing from heaven. The "Tang’s Questions" states: "At the northernmost reaches, beyond the farthest wilds, lies the Dark Sea—a celestial lake. There dwells a fish, its breadth spanning thousands of *li*, its length commensurate, called the *kun*. There soars a bird, called the *peng*, its wings like clouds trailing from heaven, its body proportionate." Note that the *Liezi* does not speak of the *kun* transforming into the *peng*. From this point to "and where does it intend to go?" the *Liezi* omits these lines, though they appear to follow seamlessly in meaning. The Master of the Lacquer Garden cites antiquity with deliberate ambiguity, exemplifying what is meant by "flowing boundlessly at will to suit oneself."

It mounts the whirling winds, rising ninety thousand *li*, spiraling upward like a ram’s horn. It pierces the clouds, bears the blue sky upon its back, then sets its course southward, bound for the Southern Dark. This again invokes the "Tang’s Questions" as proof. The *chiyan* scoffs at it, saying—as Sima notes: "*Chi* refers to a small marsh; *yan*, the *yan* sparrow. *Chi* was originally written as *chi*." The characters are interchangeable. Xiahou Zhan’s *Refuting Doubts* states: "The *chiyan* cannot soar above the mulberry and elm." The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the "Seven Stimuli" notes: "The *yan* sparrow flies no higher than a foot, illustrating its feebleness." Yet how far does a sparrow truly fly? The text below clearly states "several *ren*." "Where does it intend to go? I leap and flutter upward, no higher than a few *ren*, circling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the utmost of flight. And where does it intend to go?" Again, the *chiyan*’s mockery serves as Hui Shi’s likeness. This is the distinction between small and great, now made explicit.

Thus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct matches one village—Li [Yun] says: "*Bi* means to accord"—whose virtue aligns with one lord and whose *power* validates one state—Guo Qingfan says: "*Er* is read as *neng* [ability]. *Neng* and *er* are interchangeable in ancient script. Office, village, lord, and state form a parallel; knowledge, conduct, virtue, and ability likewise correspond." Sima [Biao] says: "*Zheng* means trust." Yet their self-regard is no different from this. This describes the *chiyan*. Now turning to men, it subtly refers to those like Hui Shi. Yet Song Rongzi still laughs at them. Sima [Biao] and Li [Yun] say: "Rongzi was a man of Song." Cui [Yuan] says: "A worthy." That is, he still finds them laughable. Moreover, though the whole world praises them, they are not spurred on; though the whole world blames them, they are not disheartened—Guo Xiang says: "They are certain of their own attainment." They determine the division between inner and outer—Guo [Xiang] says: "Inner as self, outer as things." They distinguish the bounds of honor and disgrace—Guo [Xiang] says: "Honor for oneself, disgrace for others." This is all. Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Rongzi’s wisdom and virtue extend no further than this." As for his relation to the world, he is not *shu shu ran*. That is, such a one is not often seen.

Though this is so, he has still not established himself. Sima [Biao] says: "Established, meaning to stand firm. His utmost virtue is not yet established." Note: This is to say that Song Rongzi is not yet worthy of admiration. As for Liezi, who rides the wind in his travels—Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Lie Yukou was a man of Zheng, a contemporary of Duke Xū of Zheng." Note: The *Huangdi* chapter of the *Liezi* states: "Liezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi, mastering the Way of both. He rode the wind and returned." Further below, it says: "He drifted with the wind east and west, like a withered leaf or a dry husk, never knowing whether the wind bore him or he bore the wind." His skill is effortlessly refined—Guo [Xiang] says: "Lingran describes a light and wondrous appearance." After fifteen days he returns. Yet in attaining such fortune, he is not *shu shu ran*. Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Attaining means obtaining. This is the fortune of one who rides the wind as an immortal." Note: This is to say that those who attain such fortune are also not often seen. Though he is spared from walking, he still relies on something. He may avoid traveling on foot, but he must still depend on the wind. Liezi, too, is not yet worthy of admiration.

As for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth and harnesses the transformations of the six qi—Sima [Biao] says: "The six qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and light." Guo Qingfan says: "Bian should be read as *change*, forming a pair with *constancy*. Bian and *change* were interchangeable in ancient script."—and thereby roams the boundless, what does he have to depend on? To roam the boundless without reliance is the essential principle of the *Free and Easy Wandering*. Thus it is said: The perfected person has no self, the spirit-like person has no merit, the sage has no name. *Shiwen* notes: "Ji is pronounced as in *record*." Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Perfected describes their essence, spirit-like their function, sage their name, but in reality, they are one." Note: They establish no merit or fame and do not set themselves apart, hence they stand alone.

This is Zhuangzi’s own exposition. Below, he lists four examples to clarify it.

Yao offered the world to Xu You—Sima [Biao] says: "A man of Yangcheng in Yingchuan."—saying: "The sun and moon have risen, yet the torchfire still burns—how difficult it would be to match their light! The timely rain has fallen, yet you still irrigate—how laborious it would be to match its moisture!"

"Sir, you stand and the world is ordered—yet I still occupy your place." *Cheng* notes: "尸 means 'to preside.'" "I see myself as lacking and unworthy; let me yield the world to you."

Xu You replied: "You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. If I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of fame? Fame is but the guest of reality—would I become a mere guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch." *Li* notes: "鹪鹩 is a small bird." *Guo Pu* says: "The peach-sparrow." "The mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than a full belly." *Li Yi* says: "偃鼠 is the shrew-mouse." *Li Zhen* says: "偃 may be written as 鼹, a common variant." *Materia Medica* in *Tao Hongjing’s* annotation: "Also called 鼢鼠, it burrows through plowed fields; dig and you will find it." *Shuowen* under 鼢: "A subterranean mouse, transformed from the shrike." *Li’s* account is mistaken. "Return and rest, my lord!"

I have no use for ruling the world. Though the cook neglects his kitchen, the invocator does not leap over the sacrificial vessels to take his place." *Shiwen* notes: "祝 refers to one who conveys the words of spirits." *Case*: This cites Xu You’s refusal of the world as a self-portrait—only thus can one preserve one’s Heaven-given nature intact.

Jian Wu asked Lian Shu (both ancient holders of the Dao), saying: "I heard words from Jie Yu." *Shiwen*: "Huangfu Mi says: 'Jie Yu tilled his own fields. The King of Chu sent envoys with a hundred *yi* of gold and two teams of four horses to summon him, but he did not respond.'" "They were vast yet without foundation," *Shiwen*: "丁浪 *fan*." *Case*: "当 means base." "and went forth never to return. I was alarmed by his words—they were like the Milky Way, boundless and without end." *Cheng* says: "Like the celestial river, distant and lofty; trace its source or flow, and it remains utterly without limit." "They were wildly divergent," *Xuan Ying* says: "径 is the path outside the gate; 庭, the ground outside the hall. 大有 means 'vastly distant.'" "and far removed from human sentiment."

Lian Shu said: "What did his words say?"
Jian Wu replied: "On distant Mount Gushe, there dwells a spirit-person. Their skin is like ice and snow, their grace like that of a maiden." *Li* says: "淖约 means 'beautiful.'" *Shiwen*: "处子 means a maiden in her chamber." "They eat no grains, but drink the wind and sip the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, mount flying dragons, and wander beyond the four seas." *Note*: These three lines also appear in the *Qiwulun* chapter, where "御飞龙" reads "骑日月." "Their spirit is concentrated—these three words are crucial. Only one who roams beyond things can concentrate their spirit. They cause things to suffer no blight, and the harvests to ripen." *Sima* says: "疵 means harm." 疠 is pronounced *lai*, meaning malignant disease. *Liezi’s* *Huangdi* chapter: "Mount Gushe lies in the sea. Upon it dwells a spirit-person who drinks the wind and sips the dew, eats no grains, whose heart is like a deep spring, whose form is like a maiden’s. They bestow no favors, yet things are naturally sufficient; they hoard nothing, yet they lack for nothing. Yin and yang are ever in harmony, sun and moon ever bright, the four seasons ever regular, wind and rain ever balanced, nurturance ever timely, and the harvests ever abundant. The land suffers no pestilence, people no premature death, and things no blight." The Garden of Lacquer Trees takes this as its source.

"I find them mad and unbelievable."
*Kuang*: *Li* reads it as 九况 *fan*. *Case*: The pronunciation is like 诳, meaning "to deceive."
Lian Shu said: "Indeed. The blind have nothing to share in the spectacle of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that knows deafness and blindness? The mind has them too. His words are like a maiden’s." *Sima* says: "Like a virgin." *Case*: 时 means "is." The meaning is: his words are like those of a maiden. The following—*this person, this virtue*—are terms of the utmost comparison. "This person, this virtue, will pervade the ten thousand things, uniting them as one, and the world will seek order—who would exhaust themselves over the world’s affairs!" *Li* says: "磅礡 means 'vast and pervasive.'" *Li Zhen* says: "Also written 旁魄, meaning 'widely covering.' Their virtue broadly pervades the ten thousand things, seeking order for the age—how could they trouble themselves with the world’s affairs! As Laozi says: 'I do nothing, and the people transform themselves.'" 乱 means "to order." *Jianwen* says: "弊弊 means 'to manage busily.'" *Case*: 蕲 is the same as 期.

"This person—nothing harms them. Though the great flood reaches the heavens, they do not drown." *Sima* says: "稽 means 'to reach.'" "Though great drought melts metal and stone and scorches mountains and earth, they do not grow hot. Their dust and chaff," *Shuowen* writes 秕 as "". *Shiwen*: "秕糠 means 'trifling and fragmented.'" *Case*: They regard even the most trivial matters as mere dust. "would mold and cast even Yao and Shun—who would trouble themselves with things!

This again cites the spirit-person who takes no heed of the world, to illustrate the way of preserving one’s nature intact. The people of Song carried *zhangfu* hats to Yue," *Li* says: "资 means 'to sell.' *Zhangfu* are Yin dynasty caps, sold as goods." *Sima* says: "诸 means 'to.'" "but the Yue people, with their cropped hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them." This is a metaphor for having no use for the world.

When Yao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm’s affairs, he went to see the Four Masters on distant Mount Gushe," *Sima* and *Li* say: "The Four Masters are Wang Ni, Nie Que, Pi Yi, and Xu You." *Li Zhen* says: "The Four Masters are not real people; to seek names to substantiate them is forced." "by the northern bank of the Fen River. There, he lost all sense of his possession of the world." The northern bank of the Fen River was Yao’s capital. *Xuan* says: "窅然 means 'deep and distant.'" *Case*: This means Yao himself forgot his own lordship of the world—what follows is even less worth mentioning.

Huizi said to Zhuangzi," *Sima* says: "His surname was Hui, given name Shi; he served as Prime Minister of Liang." "The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *shi*. When I used it to hold water, its strength could not support itself."

"Cheng says: '树 means 'to plant.' 实 refers to the fruit. Being hollow and brittle, it could not support its own weight.'" When split to make ladles, it was too vast and hollow to hold anything. *Jianwen* says: "瓠落 means 'spacious and empty.'" Cheng says: "Its flat shallowness could not contain much." It was not that it was not *xiao*-like in its greatness—*Shiwen* notes: "呺, also written as . Li says: 'It means 'hollow and large in appearance.''" Yu Yue says: "呺 is a vulgar character; it should be 枵, meaning 'hollow.'"—but I smashed it for its uselessness."

Zhuangzi said: "You, sir, are truly inept at putting great things to use. Among the people of Song, there was one skilled in making an ointment to prevent chapped hands." *Xiang Xiu* says: "龟 means 'cracked and split.'" *Shiwen* notes: "Xu pronounces it as *julun*." *Li Zhen* says: "Here, 龟 is used as a loan for 皲. *Xuanying’s Sound and Meaning* cites *Tongsuwen*: 'Cracking of hands and feet is called 皲; classical texts sometimes write it as 龟坼.' It cites this passage as evidence." For generations, his family had made their living by washing silk floss."

The *Cheng* commentary states: "洴 means 'floating'; 澼, 'drifting'; 絖, 'silk floss.'" Li says: "To drift floss upon the water." Lu Wenchang notes: "洴澼 is the sound of beating floss." A visitor heard of this and offered a hundred *jin* for the recipe. Li explains: "A *jin* is the weight of one cubic *cun* of gold; a hundred *jin* is thus a hundred pounds." The family gathered to deliberate: "For generations, we have made but a few *jin* from beating floss; now, selling this skill in a single morning would bring a hundred *jin*—let us give it to him." The visitor obtained it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue posed a threat, the King sent him as a general. In winter, he engaged the Yue forces in a water battle, routed them, and was granted land as a fief. The same ointment that prevents chapped hands brought one man a noble title while another remained a silk-floss beater—such is the difference in how it was used.

Now you possess a gourd of five *shi* capacity—why not consider fashioning it into a great float and drifting upon rivers and lakes? Sima comments: "虑 means 'to bind or fasten.' A *zun* resembles a wine vessel; tied to the body, it allows one to float across rivers and lakes—what is now called a 'waist boat.'" Yet you fret that the gourd is too large to hold anything! Truly, sir, your mind is as tangled as a *peng* plant!" Xiang says: "The *peng* is short and stunted—this describes a narrow-minded scholar." This refers to Hui Shi’s error in deeming the useful as useless, failing to grasp the Way of its application.

Huizi said: "I have a great tree, which people call the *chu*. Its massive trunk is gnarled and unfit for the carpenter’s line, its slender branches twisted and useless for compass or square. Planted by the roadside, no craftsman spares it a glance. Now your words, grand yet impractical, are likewise discarded by all." This is to say, they are cast aside and left untouched.

Zhuangzi said: "Have you alone never seen the wildcat or weasel? As Cheng notes, 'the *sheng* is a wildcat.' Crouching low, it lies in wait for passing prey; as Sima explains, 'wandering creatures, such as fowl and rodents.' Leaping east and west, bounding and darting—heedless of high or low—it falls into the trap’s jaws. The *bi* is the device that ensnares. The *Yantie Lun*’s 'Xingfa' chapter states, 'Traps are set to intercept their paths,' which carries the same meaning. It is also written as *bei*. The *Chu Ci*’s 'Ai Shimming' reads: 'Externally pressed and constrained by the *ji bei*.' The *ji bei* is the same as the *ji bi*. Wang’s commentary in the *Yupian* takes it to mean the body of a crossbow. It dies in the hunter’s net.

Now consider the yak: as Sima explains, 'the *li* ox.' Its greatness is like a cloud hanging in the sky. As Cheng notes, 'Seen from afar in the mountains, it resembles a cloud at the edge of heaven.' This creature can be so vast, yet it cannot catch a mouse. You, sir, possess a great tree and fret over its uselessness—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatsoever, the vast and boundless wilds? As Jianwen explains, 'Mo means great.' Wander idly beside it, roam freely in its shade, and lie at ease beneath its boughs. As Guo Qingfan notes, 'According to the *Shuowen*, *xiaoyao* should be written as *xiaoyao*.' Wang Maoye adds: '*Xiaoyao* conveys the sense of harmony, joy, and ease.' It will not be felled by axe or adze, and no thing will harm it. With no use to be made of it—meaning no place where it can be put to use—how could it ever come to grief? As stated in the 'Ren Jian Shi' chapter: 'This is a tree of no talent, with nothing it can be used for.' And again: 'I have long sought what can be of no use.' The 'Shan Mu' chapter likewise says: 'With nothing it can be used for.' The meaning is the same as here."

This further illustrates how the wildcat and weasel meet their doom, how the yak’s greatness is of no avail, and how the *chu* tree, by preserving itself, fares best—all to enlighten Hui Shi. For Hui Shi sought to engage with the world, while Zhuangzi fled it. Hui deemed Zhuangzi’s words useless, unaware that Zhuangzi roamed the boundless, revealing the difference between "great knowledge" and "lesser knowledge."

---

The second chapter of the Inner Chapters, "On the Equality of Things and Opinions," holds that all things and words in the world may be viewed as equal, without need for debate—one need only abide in the Dao. As Su Yu observes: "Nothing in the world is more tangled than the disputes over things. If right and wrong are too sharply defined, the mind becomes burdened. Thus, regard all the world’s words as the spontaneous arising and ceasing of the heavenly pipes, like the natural cries of fledglings—utterly unconnected to oneself. Only then can one forget 'that' and 'this,' merge praise and blame, level noble and base, equalize things and self, cast off the physical form, leave behind life and death, seek the true master, and illumine it with one’s original clarity, letting the mind wander in the infinite." These are the most subtle principles in Zhuangzi’s thought. Yet in his writings, argument abounds and emotion runs high—could he truly have forgotten right and wrong? He merely leaves the principle intact.

Nanguo Ziqi sat leaning against his desk. As Sima explains, "He lived in Nanguo, hence his name." The *Shiwen* notes: "Yin means to lean; Li’s edition has *ji* as 'table.'" As the *Xu Wugui* chapter records, "Guo" appears as "Bo," and "ji" as "table." Gazing at the sky, he sighed, his response seeming as though he had lost his counterpart. As Xiang explains, "Xu means to exhale." The *Shiwen* adds: "Da describes a state of dissolution; the original also has *ta*. Ou is also written as *ou*." Yu comments: "Ou should be read as *yu*, meaning 'to lodge'—that is, what follows refers to 'I have lost my self.'" The *Xu Wugui* chapter omits this line after "sighed." Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him. As Li explains, "Ziqi’s disciple, surnamed Yan, named Yan, posthumously titled Cheng, styled Ziyou." The *Xu Wugui* chapter has "Yan Chengzi entered to see him." He asked: "What is this? The *Xu Wugui* chapter reads: 'Sir, you are the most extraordinary of things!' Can the body truly be made like a withered tree, and the heart like dead ashes? The *Wenzi*’s 'Daoyuan' chapter quotes Laozi: 'The form like a withered tree, the heart like dead ashes.' The *Xu Wugui* chapter has the same two lines, with 'tree' as 'frame.' The 'Zhi Beiyou' chapter reads: 'The form like a withered frame, the heart like dead ashes.' The 'Gengsang Chu' chapter also has these two lines, with 'withered frame' as 'withered tree’s branches.' The 'Dasheng' chapter likewise states: 'I grasped his arm, which was like the branch of a withered tree.' Thus, this 'withered tree' is the branch of a withered tree. 'Withered frame' is also a withered branch. The following text differs. The one who now leans against the desk is not the one who leaned against it before." Ziqi said: "Yan, how well you ask! Now I have lost my self—do you understand?"

"Have you heard the human *lai* but not the earthly *lai*? Have you heard the earthly *lai* but not the heavenly *lai*?"

Guo Xiang notes: "*Lai* is a flute."

Ziyou said: "May I ask about its method?"

Cheng Xuanying explains: "*Fang* means technique."

Ziqi said: "The great clod exhales *qi*—Yu Yue comments: '*Kuai* is the body, the great earth.' Cheng Xuanying says: 'Exhaling forth *qi*.'—its name is wind. When it does not act, nothing stirs; when it acts, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone not heard its *liu-liu* sound?"

*Zhi* here means "its." Below, the same.

The *Shiwen* glosses: "*Liu-liu* is the sound of a long wind. Li Yi’s edition has *liu*."

The towering peaks of mountain forests, the hollows of great trees a hundred spans around—some resemble noses, some mouths, some ears, some crossbeams, some animal pens, some mortars, some depressions, some puddles.

The *Zilin* states: "*Ji* is the square timber atop a pillar." Cheng Xuanying says: "*Quan* is an animal enclosure." Xuan Ying comments: "*Wa* is a deep pool; *wu* is a hollow. Three resemble the body, three resemble objects, and two resemble the earth—all describe the shapes of hollows in wood."

Some rush forth, some whistle, some shout, some inhale, some cry, some wail, some echo, some keen.

Xuan Ying explains: "Rushing is like the sound of water surging; whistling is like the sound of an arrow in flight. Shouting is loud and coarse; inhaling is soft and fine. Crying is high and clear; wailing is low and muddy. Echoing is deep and lingering; keening is clear and ringing—all describe the sounds of the hollows."

The *Shiwen* notes: "*Xiao* is pronounced *xiao*. Sima Biao says: '*Hao* is the sound of weeping.'" A note observes: "In the *Book of Songs*, 'the twittering yellow birds'—the three schools of the *Odes* write this as *yao-yao*."

The first sings *yu*, and the next sings *yong*.

Li Yi says: "*Yu* and *yong* are harmonizing sounds." Cheng Xuanying explains: "Both are the sounds of wind blowing through trees, one following the other."

A gentle breeze brings a small harmony; a whirlwind brings a great harmony.

Li Yi says: "*Ling* is a light wind." The *Erya* states: "A swirling wind is called a *piao*." *He* is pronounced *huo*.

When a fierce wind subsides, the myriad hollows fall silent.

Xiang Xiu comments: "*Li* means fierce; *ji* means to cease."

Have you alone not seen the *tiao-tiao*, the *diao-diao*?"

Guo Xiang says: "*Tiao-tiao* and *diao-diao* both describe swaying."

Ziyou said: "The earthly *lai* is simply the myriad hollows; the human *lai* is the bamboo flutes. Blowing through bamboo pipes in sequence—may I ask about the heavenly *lai*?"

Ziqi said: "Though the blowing of the myriad things differs, it is the wind that makes each cease of its own accord. All take of themselves—who is it that stirs them to fury?"

Xuan Ying comments: "The earthly *lai* waits for the wind to sound; the wind that makes the hollows sound of themselves is the heavenly *lai*." Here ends the quotation from Ziqi.

A note observes: This passage uses blowing as an analogy. The wind blows through the myriad things differently, yet it makes each cease of itself. Moreover, each hollow produces its own sound—thus, the sounding is all self-taken. Yet if the myriad hollows roar in fury, there must be something that stirs them—who, then, is it that stirs them to fury? Realizing who it is, one sees that the sounding of all things cannot take form without dependence—how much more so the distinctions of gain and loss! "Who is it that stirs them?" prompts one to grasp it immediately—this is what is called below the "true ruler."

The great understanding is expansive, the small understanding is expansive—
The great words blaze, the small words prattle.
In sleep, the spirits intermingle; in waking, the forms open—these are the differences of sleep and waking.
In interaction they form bonds, daily contending in the heart.
Some are loose, some are deep, some are dense—these are the differences of engagement.
Small fears make one tremble; great fears leave one dazed—these are the differences of fear and dread.
Their issuance is like the release of a crossbow bolt—this is what it means to govern right and wrong.
Their restraint is like a sworn oath—this is what it means to guard victory.
Their decay is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decline.
What they sink into through their doings cannot be made to return.
Their weariness is like a sealed letter, speaking of their aging depths.
The heart near death allows no return to vitality.

Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, thought and sigh, change and dread,
flightiness and dissipation, wantonness and affectation—
in movement and stillness, in interaction, in nature and bearing, all are endowed by Heaven.

Above speaks of humans.
Music emerges from emptiness, soundless yet sounding.
Mushrooms form from steam—
formless yet formed, all are moved by qi.

Above speaks of things.
Day and night alternate before us, yet none know where they sprout.
Day and night succeed one another—from where do they arise?

Enough, enough!
From dawn to dusk, one grasps this—it is that by which life arises!
Since it cannot be traced, it is best to let it be.
Yet in the span of dawn and dusk, one awakens to the true principle.
This is the root of life.
Without that, there is no self;
without the self, nothing can be received.
This is close indeed—
yet one does not know what compels it.

There must be a true ruler, though no trace of it can be found.
One may trust in its form, yet not see its shape;
one may trust in its movement, yet not see the form that moves me.
It has sentience but no form.

The hundred bones,
the nine orifices,
the six viscera—all are contained within.
With whom should I be intimate?
Do you delight in all equally?
Or is there a private preference?
Will you cherish all alike, or favor one among them?
If all are so, are they servants?
Yet servants are not sufficient to govern one another.
Or do they take turns as lord and subject?
There must be a true ruler present.

This is the "true ruler" mentioned above—a phrase that awakens. Whether one grasps its essence or not, it neither adds to nor diminishes its truth. Once receiving its completed form, it does not perish but awaits its end. Buffeted and worn by things, its course rushes on like a galloping steed, yet nothing can halt it—is this not tragic?

Where the true ruler resides, grasping it brings no gain, nor does failing to grasp it bring loss. Yet from the moment one receives form, clinging to it without dying, sitting idle until qi is exhausted, pointlessly contending with external things—watching the years race by like a galloping horse, with no power to stop—is this not sorrowful? Once receiving its completed form, it does not transform but awaits its end. All one’s life toils without seeing success, wearily laboring without knowing where to return—how can this not be pitiful? All that exists is illusory and false, so no success is achieved; exhausted by one’s labors, yet unaware of where to find refuge.

Lu Wenchang notes: "● should be read as *nié*." Sima reads it as *ěr*. Jianwen comments: "Fatigue, the appearance of exhaustion."

If one is called "undying," what benefit is there? The body transforms, and the mind follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow? Though alive, what use is it? When the body changes and the mind changes with it, the spirit is utterly lost. Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone in this delusion, or are there others who are not? Once one follows the heart’s inclinations as a teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must one know the principle of alternation for the mind to find its own teacher? Even the foolish possess this. Whatever the heart intends, it follows and fulfills. Taking the heart as a teacher is something everyone has—why must one understand the principle of alternation for the mind to find its own teacher? Even the foolish are not without it.

Before the heart is settled and unified, one arbitrarily judges right and wrong—this is like claiming to have arrived in Yue today when one set out yesterday. Before the heart is firmly established, one rashly forms opinions, declaring this the Way and that not the Way, like boasting of arrival before even setting out. This "right and wrong" is unrelated to the "right and wrong" below. The *Under Heaven* chapter’s phrase "setting out for Yue today and arriving yesterday" is a saying of Hui Shi and the debaters, here used as an analogy.

Thus, one takes what does not exist as existing. Even if the divine Yu were here, he could not comprehend it—what then can I do? Claiming the nonexistent as existent, even the wisdom of Yu could not fathom it. With such self-deception, what can I do?

This passage repeatedly awakens the world.

The word "must" in some editions appears as "if." According to Wang’s note, "if there were a true ruler governing thus," Wang’s edition likely also reads "if."

The word "also" in some editions appears as "perhaps."

"Appearance of exhaustion" in the *Shiwen* appears as "the state of illness and fatigue."

Speech is not like the wind. (This responds to the earlier "wind.")

Those who speak make claims, yet what they claim remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech at all? Do they deem it distinct from the chirping of fledglings—does it possess discernment, or does it lack discernment? Human speech is not like the wind’s gusts; the moment one speaks, it is not yet firmly established. Is it truly grounded in speech? Or is there no such speech? Or is it indeed distinct from the cries of newborn birds—or not distinct at all? Even the weight of their words remains undetermined.

How does the Dao become obscured so that truth and falsehood arise? How does speech become obscured so that right and wrong emerge? Obscured means concealed. Why is the Dao concealed such that truth and falsehood appear? Why is speech concealed such that right and wrong arise? Where does the Dao go that it ceases to exist? Why does speech exist yet remain unverifiable?

Xuan comments: "The Dao is present everywhere; it fundamentally requires no speech. Each word and each Dao likewise need no debate."

The Dao is hidden by partial attainment. Partial attainment refers to clinging to what one has achieved as the Dao, unaware of its vastness.

Xuan comments: "Those with biased views thus obscure the Dao."

Cheng cites the *Laozi*: "When the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise."

Speech is hidden by florid ornamentation.

Cheng comments: "Florid ornamentation refers to the words of empty disputation and embellished rhetoric. Precisely because one is mired in such embellished disputation, the profound words become obscured. As the *Laozi* says: 'Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy.'"

Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists, affirming what they reject and rejecting what they affirm.

Cheng comments: "Long ago, there was a man of Zheng named Huan who studied in the land of the Qiu clan. After three years, his skills were perfected, and he transformed into a Confucian. Confucians follow the examples of Yao and Shun, take the regulations of Wen and Wu as their model, practice the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, and distinguish the ranks of high and low—hence they are called Confucians. Huan’s younger brother was named Di. Huan transformed his brother, and he became a Mohist. Mohists follow the Dao of Yu: esteeming worthiness, revering ritual, practicing frugality and universal love, grinding their heads and treading to the heels to save the common people—this is called Mohism. Though Huan and Di were brothers by blood, each adhered to a different teaching and disputed each other’s right and wrong. Huan resented his brother, was overcome with emotion, and died. Yet the mutual right and wrong between self and other has existed for a long time. The intensity of such contention originated with these two worthies, and thus they are pointed to as the leaders of the disorderly crowd. From this, one sees that when the Dao is lost and speech is obscured, the scrutiny of right and wrong begins."

(Note: The story of the Confucians and Mohists appears in the "Lie Yukou" chapter.)

If one wishes to affirm what they reject and reject what they affirm, then nothing is better than illumination.

Guo Songtao comments: "That and this take the form of opposition, and when right and wrong stand in duality, the right and wrong one upholds are not true right and wrong—the perception of that and this remains."

(Note: "Nothing is better than illumination" means that nothing is better than illuminating it with the inherent clarity of the original state.)

Things are not without that; things are not without this. Where there is opposition, there is both that and this. From that, one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Observing others is obscure; turning inward brings clarity. Thus it is said: That emerges from this, and this likewise depends on that. This is the theory of the mutual arising of that and this. Only after this exists does that come to be, and because of that, this also arises—this is the theory of the initial arising of that and this.

Yet even as it arises, it dies; even as it dies, it arises. Their theories arise and perish, perish and arise, drifting without constancy.

Guo’s interpretation of this as the transformation of life and death is incorrect.

Even as it is permissible, it is impermissible; even as it is impermissible, it is permissible. What is permissible immediately gives rise to what is deemed impermissible; what is impermissible immediately gives rise to what is deemed permissible. Permissible and impermissible are right and wrong. Affirming this and negating that, negating this and affirming that. Where there is affirmation of this, there is also negation of that; where there is negation of this, there is also affirmation of that. Since there is that and this, the arising of right and wrong is endless.

Therefore, the sage does not follow this path.

Xuan comments: "Does not follow the path of right and wrong."

Instead, he illuminates it by means of Heaven.

Cheng comments: "Heaven is nature."

(Note: Illumination means clarity. One simply clarifies it by means of the natural Heaven, without employing right and wrong.)

This too is affirmation of this.

Thus, with right and wrong endless, one does not follow them.

Su Yu comments: "This means 'precisely for this reason.'"

This is also that, and that is also this.

This is the "this."

Guo comments: "This is also made into that by that, and that also deems itself this."

That too has its right and wrong, and this too has its right and wrong.

Cheng comments: "This deems itself right, and that deems itself right; this deems that wrong, and that deems this wrong. Thus, each has its own right, and each has its own wrong."

Is there truly that and this? Or is there truly no that and this?

Divided, there is that and this; united, there is no that and this.

When that and this find no counterpart, this is called the *pivot of the Dao*.

Cheng comments: "Counterpart means opposition. Pivot means essential. Realizing that both that and this are empty, that right and wrong are both illusory, and concentrating the spirit to perceive alone without opposition in the world—this is to grasp the profound essence and attain the pivot of the Dao."

When the pivot first finds the center of the ring, it can respond to the endless.

Guo Songtao comments: "Right and wrong transform in two ways, yet the Dao abides therein; thus, it is called the *pivot of the Dao*. Holding the pivot of the Dao, one roams within the ring. The center is emptiness. Right and wrong revolve endlessly, chasing one another like a ring. Roaming within emptiness, not enslaved by right and wrong, one can then respond to the endless."

The Tang Buddhist Zhanran’s *Fahua Xuanyan Hongjue* quotes an ancient commentary on the *Zhuangzi*: "The inner emptiness of a circular ring has no bounds; thus, it is called the *center of the ring*."

The *Ze Yang* chapter also states: "Ran Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring to follow completion."

This too is an endless, and not-this too is an endless.

Guo comments: "The world deems itself right and others wrong; thus, one right and one wrong proceed endlessly."

Therefore, it is said: "Nothing compares to illumination."

Only the illumination of fundamental clarity can respond to the endless.

This means that where there is that and this, right and wrong arise, and without illumination, the Dao cannot be perceived.

Using a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger.

Using a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse.

Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.

This sets a shadow for the following statement: "Things are called so and thus become so."

Taken closely from the body, a finger is a finger; taken broadly from things, a horse is a horse.

Now, to say a finger is not a finger and a horse is not a horse, people will surely not believe it. Using a finger or a horse to illustrate this cannot make it clear. But using a non-finger or a non-horse to illustrate it, one can then realize that a finger is not a finger and a horse is not a horse.

Thus, though heaven and earth are vast, they are but one finger; though the myriad things are manifold, they are but one horse.

What is permissible is permissible, and what is impermissible is impermissible.

Guo comments: "What is permissible to oneself is called permissible; what is impermissible to oneself is called impermissible."

The Dao is walked upon and thus formed.

Xuan comments: "Dao means path."

(Note: "Walked upon and thus formed" refers to what Mencius called "using it and thus forming a path." This serves as a metaphor for the following statement and does not pertain to the Dao of principle.)

Things are called so and thus become so.

All things are named as they are designated; such names are not inherently fixed.

Thus, a finger or a horse may be called a non-finger or a non-horse, and a non-finger or a non-horse may also be called a finger or a horse.

How is this so? It is so because it is so.

How is it not so? It is not so because it is not so.

Why is it called so? Where there is "so," all follow and become so.
Why is it called not so? Where there is "not so," all follow and become not so—this is to let others determine right and wrong.

Things inherently have what is so; things inherently have what is permissible.
Nothing is not so; nothing is not permissible.

In the beginning of discussing things, there are inherently "so" and "permissible," as in a finger being a finger and a horse being a horse.
Yet in the later arising of discussions, many names become incorrect. If names are altered, then nothing is not so, and nothing is not permissible—why not let people call them as they will?

The passage from "How is it so?" onward also appears in the "Parables" chapter. Here, "right and wrong" and "permissible and impermissible" are discussed together. Comparing it with the "Parables" chapter, after "it is not so because it is not so," there should be four more lines—"How is it permissible? It is permissible because it is permissible. How is it impermissible? It is impermissible because it is impermissible"—but the present text omits them.

Thus, for this reason, examples are given: a stalk and a pillar, a leper and Xi Shi, the vast and the cunning, the strange and the monstrous—all are united in the Dao.
*Annotation:* "For this reason" (為是) is read as *wèi shì*. *Guo Xiang* comments: "For this reason, a few examples are briefly cited." *Yu Yue* comments: "*Shuowen* states, 'A *tíng* is a stem.' The *Han shu* and *Dongfang Shuo zhuan* read, 'striking a bell with a stalk.' *Sima Biao* comments, 'An *yíng* is a house pillar. A *lì* is a leper.' The stalk and pillar illustrate size; the leper and Xi Shi illustrate beauty and ugliness." *Guo Xiang* comments: "*Huī* refers to vastness; *jué* to the strange and cunning. *Jué* also means deceit; *guài* refers to the monstrous and bizarre."

From the perspective of one who knows the Dao, all can be united as one without differentiation.
Their division is their formation; dividing one thing forms many things.
Their formation is their destruction.
*Guo Xiang* comments: "What is formation here is destruction there, as in weaving scattered fur or building a house by felling trees."

All things have no inherent formation or destruction, but are again united as one.
Since formation is destruction and destruction is formation, regardless of formation or destruction, all can again be united as one without differentiation.

Only the enlightened know how to unite them as one, and for this reason, they do not employ their own views but lodge them in the ordinary.
Only those who comprehend the Dao can view them as one; for this reason, they do not impose their own perspectives but rest them in common principles.

The ordinary is the function;
*Xuan Ying* comments: "The function of what is seemingly without use."
The function is the connection;
The function of what seems without use lies in perceiving its connection.
The connection is attainment.
Perceiving the connection leads to natural attainment.
Attainment is the subtle approach.
Natural attainment is the subtle approach to the Dao.
This is the way of it.
This is called "following" (*yin*).
*Following* means yielding—yielding to Heaven’s way.

Once this is so, yet one does not know why it is so, this is called the Dao.
*Xuan Ying* comments: "Once united as one, one does not know why it is so—this is without deliberate intent. This is what is meant by 'natural attainment is the subtle approach.'"

Yet if one exhausts their spirit and clarity to seek unity while failing to recognize their inherent sameness, this is called "morning threes."
If one labors their spirit and clarity to seek unity yet does not recognize their fundamental sameness, they are confined to a single corner of the present, no different from the "morning threes" parable.

What is "morning threes"?
A monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, "Three in the morning and four in the evening." The monkeys were all enraged.
He then said, "Then four in the morning and three in the evening." The monkeys were all pleased.
Though names and realities suffered no loss, joy and anger were manipulated—this, too, is "following."

The *Liezi* "Emperor Huang" chapter states: "In Song there was a monkey keeper who loved monkeys and raised them in troops. He understood the monkeys' minds, and the monkeys grasped his intentions. He reduced his family's provisions to satisfy the monkeys' desires. Soon, he grew impoverished and intended to limit their food. Fearing the monkeys would not submit, he first deceived them, saying, 'I will give you chestnuts—three in the morning and four in the evening. Is that enough?' The monkeys all rose in anger. After a moment, he said, 'Then four in the morning and three in the evening. Is that enough?' The monkeys all prostrated themselves in delight. Things that use their cunning to deceive one another are all like this. The sage uses wisdom to ensnare the foolish, just as the monkey keeper used wisdom to ensnare the monkeys. Though names and realities suffered no loss, he manipulated their joy and anger!"

*Zhang Zhan*’s commentary: "One who enjoys raising gibbons is called a monkey keeper. *Xu* (chestnut) is pronounced *xù*." *Zhuangzi* cites this to show that though names and realities suffer no loss, joy and anger are manipulated—this is merely following their nature, which is also the meaning of "yielding."

Thus the sage harmonizes them with right and wrong and rests in the celestial balance—this is called "walking the two paths."

*Shiwen* notes: "Balance (*jun*) is also written as *均*."
*Cheng* comments: "Balance refers to the principle of natural equilibrium."
*Case*: This means the sage harmonizes right and wrong, resting together in the realm of natural equilibrium, where things and self each attain their place—this is "walking the two paths."
*Case* in the "Parables" chapter also states: "Beginning and end are like a ring, with no discernible order—this is called the celestial balance. The celestial balance is the celestial boundary." Here it is written as *钧* (*jun*), a common loan character.

The knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost.
*Cheng* comments: "Utmost is the name for the highest attainment."
How far did it reach? Some held that things had never yet begun to exist—this was the utmost, the exhaustion of all possibility, beyond which nothing could be added.
*Guo* comments: "This is to forget heaven and earth, to leave behind the myriad things, to look outward without examining the cosmos, to look inward without perceiving one’s own body. Thus one is vast and unburdened, moving with things and responding to all without obstruction."
Next were those who held that things existed but had never yet been bounded.
Boundaries (*feng*) are limits. This next level saw things as existing but still without self and other.
Next were those who held that boundaries existed but right and wrong had never yet arisen.
Though they saw self and other, they still lacked right and wrong.
The manifestation of right and wrong is the injury of the Dao.
When right and wrong appear, the undivided wholeness of the Dao is harmed.
The injury of the Dao is the completion of partiality.
Partial love is completed through right and wrong.
Is there truly completion and injury? Or is there truly no completion and injury?
*Cheng* comments: "Truly (*guo*) means decisively. The Dao is without increase or decrease; things have injury and completion. Thus when partiality is completed, the Dao is said to be injured, yet the Dao is truly without injury. This hypothetical argument clarifies the meaning."
Where there is completion and injury, there is Master Zhao’s zither-playing.
Where there is no completion and injury, there is Master Zhao’s not playing the zither.
*Xuan* comments: "Thus (*gu*) means ancient."
*Cheng* comments: "His surname was Zhao, his given name Wen—an ancient master of the zither. If he played the *shang* note, the *jiao* was lost; if he struck the *gong*, the *zhi* was missing. Better to set it aside and not play, so the five notes remain whole. This is like how preserving emotions disrupts the Dao, while forgetting knowledge aligns with reality."
Master Zhao’s zither-playing, Master Kuang’s propping up his baton,
*Cheng* comments: "Propping (*zhi*) means resting. The baton (*ce*) is the stick used to beat the drum; it also refers to the stick used to keep time."
*Case*: Propping up his baton means leaning on it without striking.
and Master Hui’s leaning on the *wu*-tree—
*Sima* comments: "*Wu* is the zither."
*Cheng* comments: "Checking the records, there is no mention of Master Hui being skilled at the zither. Leaning on the *wu*-tree simply means resting against a *wu*-wood table while discoursing."
*Case*: Following *Cheng*’s interpretation. In the "Signs of Full Virtue" chapter, Zhuangzi says to Master Hui: "Now you strain your spirit outward and exhaust your essence, leaning against a tree to chant, resting your withered *wu*-wood table to doze." Resting against the *wu*-table to doze—this is when the skilled debater does not debate, when the one who props up his baton does not strike. The above reference to Master Zhao playing the zither also carries the implication of not playing.
These three men’s knowledge nearly reached perfection!
All were at their peak, so they are recorded at the end of their lives.
*Cui* comments: "Recorded in the present."
*Case*: Master Zhao was skilled at the zither, Kuang understood music, and Hui discoursed on names and principles—these three men’s knowledge nearly reached perfection! All were at their most flourishing, so they are recorded and passed down to later generations.
Only because they prized it did they differ from others; because they prized it, they wished to make it clear to others.
*Xuan* comments: "Only because they considered themselves different from others did they wish to enlighten others."
*Cheng* comments: "Others refers to the common people."
*Case*: The four phrases "Only because they prized it" refer specifically to the skilled debater.
What they sought to clarify was not meant to be clarified, so they ended in the obscurity of "hard and white."
What was not necessarily to be made clear, they insisted on making clear to all—like the debates over "hard stone" and "white horse," which they wanted everyone to understand, yet which ended in obscurity. Thus it is said, "they ended in the obscurity of 'hard and white.'" "Hard and white" also appears in the "Signs of Full Virtue," "Under Heaven," "Heaven and Earth," and "Autumn Floods" chapters.
*Cheng* comments: "Gongsun Long was a man of Zhao. During the Warring States period, his disciples like Kong Chuan stubbornly upheld this doctrine, parading it across the world, overpowering people’s mouths but not their hearts."
And his son, in turn, ended his life spinning Zhao’s threads, achieving nothing in his lifetime.
*Guo* comments: "Zhao Wen’s son, in turn, spent his life continuing his father’s threads."
*Cheng* comments: "Zhao Wen’s son relied on his father’s legacy, spending his years and life without achievement."
*Case*: Continuing his father’s threads is like the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s "continuing the threads of King Tai, King Ji, and King Wen." What is called "achieving nothing" means no more than mastering a single skill while straying far from the Dao—still, it is achieving nothing. If this can be called achievement, then even I have achieved. If this cannot be called achievement, then neither things nor I have achieved. If this cannot be called achievement, then the world’s unachieved are many. One should know that chasing things with the self is all achieving nothing. Thus the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage plans against. For this, he does not employ it but lodges it in the ordinary—this is called "illuminating with clarity.""

"Sima Biao states: '滑疑 means disorder.' *Case*: Though it disorders the Dao, it is sufficient to dazzle the world—hence 'the dazzling confusion of doubt.' The sage must plan to remove it, for it harms the Great Dao. For this, he does not employ his own wisdom but lodges it in the ordinary principles—this is called 'illuminating with the inherent clarity.'

The above speaks of seeking the Dao: no thing can be admitted. To grasp one aspect of things and take it as the Dao cannot be called achievement.

Now, suppose there is a statement here—is it of the same kind as this? Or is it not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, if they are taken as the same kind, then there is no difference from that. If people all cling to their own views, and now there is a statement like this—is it of the same kind as mine? Or is it not of the same kind? If one strives to prevail over the other and draws what is not of the same kind into the same kind, then is there any difference from that which is not of the same kind?

Xuan comments: 'This is me.' Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it.

Cheng comments: '尝 means to attempt.'

There is that which has a beginning; there is that which has not yet begun to have a beginning.

Cheng comments: '未始 means not yet.'

*Case*: The inception of an affair has not yet appeared.

There is that which has not yet begun to have that which has not yet begun to have a beginning. There is neither inception nor affair, only the principle of the affair.

There is that which has being; there is that which has non-being—speaking of being and non-being.

There is that which has not yet begun to have non-being—speech has not yet emerged.

There is that which has not yet begun to have that which has not yet begun to have non-being. Even the mind that would give rise to speech has not yet sprouted.

Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet one does not know whether being or non-being is truly being or non-being. Suddenly there are those who speak of being and those who speak of non-being. Yet those who speak of being may have exhausted their feelings, while those who speak of non-being may not have fully expressed their intent. Thus, what is being may become non-being, and what is non-being may become being—hence 'one does not know whether being or non-being is truly being or non-being.'

Now, I have already made a statement; I have clearly spoken. Yet I do not know whether what I have called it is truly a statement or truly not a statement. I do not know whether what I have spoken is truly speech or truly non-speech. If it accords with the Dao, it is speech; if it does not accord, then speech and non-speech are equal.

In the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. Nothing is longer-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived.

*Exegesis*: 'A child who dies young' refers to one who dies prematurely. Some say: one who dies under nineteen years of age is called a *shangzi*. Sima Biao states: 'The hair of a rabbit grows in autumn.'

Cheng comments: 'In autumn, animals grow fine hair; its tip is extremely minute, hence the tip of an autumn hair. One who dies in infancy is called a *shangzi*. The arising of things involves different forms and qi—some are small, some are large, some die young, some live long. If one speaks in terms of their inherent nature, none is not self-sufficient. Thus, if self-sufficiency is taken as greatness, nothing in the world is greater than the tip of a hair, and nothing is smaller than Mount Tai. If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great; if the tip of a hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Since small and large are thus, so too are short-lived and long-lived. Therefore, though the Two Modes are vast, their self-sufficient natures are equal; though the myriad things are many, their self-attained meanings are one.'

*Case*: This is what Zhuangzi of Qiyuan called 'equalizing Pengzu and the child who dies young.' Yet as previous scholars have said, this is truly empty, absurd fabrication. His intent is that Mount Tai and the tip of a hair are both things within the realm; if there are things a thousand myriad times greater than Mount Tai, then Mount Tai is no more than equal to the tip of a hair—hence 'nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.' Pengzu and the child who dies young are both persons within the realm; if Pengzu lived seven or eight hundred years before dying, then Pengzu is no more than equal to the child who dies young—hence 'nothing is longer-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived.' If I can be without limit with heaven and earth, then heaven and earth are born together with me; if I need not compete with the myriad things, then the myriad things and I are one."

The arts of the Dao from the Lacquer Garden are exquisitely subtle, awakening the deluded world to directly point to the primal origin and preserve each being’s true nature. Yet vulgar scholars merely seek it in literary compositions, only increasing their delusion.

Once things are already one, can there be speech? What place is there for words? Once things are called one, can there be no speech? To call it one is already speech. One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding from this, even the most skilled mathematician cannot reckon the sum—how much less can ordinary people! Cheng comments: “To speak of one with words is to treat one as something other than words. Once one is one, and words are spoken of it, there arises the duality of one and speech. Then, taking the later duality of names and opposing it to the earlier wondrous oneness, does not one and two together make three? From three onward, even those with the most ingenious reckoning cannot keep count—how much less the common run of people!”

Thus, from non-being to being, one reaches three—how much more from being to being! Cheng comments: “‘From’ means to follow; ‘to’ means to proceed. The ultimate principle is wordless; once words arise, names follow. From wordlessness to words, the moment one speaks, one reaches three. How much more when proceeding from words to words—branches and streams divide endlessly, how can they be exhausted?”

Do not proceed; rest in this. If there is no proceeding, there is only spontaneous compliance. This is why the great and small of things, the long and short lives of people, are all equalized—one attains the subtlety of spontaneous compliance.

The Dao has never had boundaries. Cheng comments: “The Dao is everywhere; what boundaries could it have?” Words have never been constant. Guo comments: “Words of this and that give rise to unfixed right and wrong.” It is for this reason that there are divisions.

Because words are inconstant, boundaries arise. Let me speak of these boundaries: there is left, there is right; some bare the left shoulder, some the right. There are ranks, there are principles. Guo comments: “Every thing has its reason; every affair has its fittingness.” The *Shiwen* notes: “Cui’s edition reads ‘there are discourses, there are discussions.’” Yu comments: “Cui’s edition is correct. The text below says, ‘preserve but do not discourse,’ ‘discourse but do not discuss.’ It also says, ‘Thus, division is where there is no division; distinction is where there is no distinction.’ What it calls division and distinction are precisely the ‘divisions and distinctions’ here. Thus, what it calls discourse and discussion are precisely the ‘discourses and discussions’ here.” Note: The above speaks of “boundaries”; ranks and principles are not boundaries. We should follow Yu’s reading.

There are divisions, there are distinctions—division is differential regard; distinction is analytical separation. There is competition, there is contention—competition is paired rivalry; contention is group strife. These are called the eight virtues. Virtue means attainment. Each clings to what it has attained, and only then are words spoken. These are the eight categories.

Beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discourse. Cheng comments: “The six directions are heaven, earth, and the four quarters. The wondrous principle is subtle and formless, transcending the six directions—thus it is preserved but not discoursed upon.” Within the six directions, the sage discourses but does not discuss. Cheng comments: “Within the six directions refers to the inherent nature bestowed upon living beings. The sage responds to their stimuli and circumstances, expounding as needed. Since it is based on emptiness, there is nothing to discuss in detail.”

The *Spring and Autumn* ordering of the world, the records of the former kings—these the sage discusses but does not dispute. Cheng comments: “The *Spring and Autumn* refers to eras; the former kings are the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. ‘Records’ means to document. Following the examples of Xuanyuan and Zhuanxu, taking Yao and Shun as models, they recorded eras to serve as canonical instructions. The sage discusses them for the benefit of the time, but ultimately does not take sides in disputes or cling to past traces.” Note: The *Spring and Autumn* ordering of the world refers to using years to organize worldly affairs; it is not the *Spring and Autumn Annals* composed by Confucius.

Thus, division is where there is no division; distinction is where there is no distinction. Taking non-division as division, non-distinction as distinction. One asks: Why? The sage embraces and preserves it in the heart. The multitude distinguishes it to display to one another—boasting and showing off. Thus it is said: Distinction is where there is no seeing. Not seeing the greatness of the Dao, only then do distinctions arise.

The great Dao is not named. Xuan comments: “It cannot be designated.” Great distinction does not speak—letting others awaken on their own, not bending them with words. Great benevolence is not benevolent. Cheng comments: “Nurturing all beings, loving without intent—like the springtime, it is not for the sake of benevolence.” Great integrity is not modest. The *Shiwen* notes: “Xu reads this as ‘humble.’” Cheng comments: “Knowing all realms are illusory, nothing is worth coveting; self and others are both empty—what is there to yield?” Great courage is not harmful. Xuan comments: “Without the impulse to harm others.”

The Dao that is manifest is not the Dao—displaying the Dao to dazzle others must not be the true Dao. Words that distinguish do not reach. Xuan comments: “They cannot prevail in distinction.” Benevolence that is constant does not succeed. Guo comments: “Constant love is necessarily incomplete.” Integrity that is pure is not trusted. Xuan comments: “Outwardly appearing flawless, the center remains unknown.” Courage that harms does not succeed. Cheng comments: “...”

"To abandon compassion and embrace courage is to oppose the natural inclinations of things with hostility—all will despise it, and nothing will be accomplished."

In these five, one nears the square from the round. *Shiwen* notes: “Cui reads this as ‘round’; Sima comments: ‘It means round.’” Cheng comments: “‘Nears’ means approaches.” Xuan comments: “These five are originally a seamless whole, but now, clinging to traces, one approaches the square from the round—this cannot be practiced.”

Thus, to know where to stop in what one does not know is perfection. Cheng comments: “When wisdom does not suffice, do not force knowledge. To know where to stop within one’s bounds is the ultimate attainment of learning.”

Who knows the eloquence of non-speech, the Dao of non-Dao? "Non-Dao" refers to the earlier "not displaying." If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Treasury. Xuan comments: “Within this undifferentiated whole, nothing is not contained.”

It may be drawn upon without being depleted, poured from without being exhausted, yet one does not know its source. Guo comments: “The coming of the supreme principle is naturally without trace.” This is called "preserving light." Cheng comments: “To preserve is to conceal. Veiled, its light grows ever brighter. To say that the Dao is revealed through words is not the Dao—this is repeatedly made clear.”

Formerly, Yao asked Shun: “I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao.” Cui comments: “Zong is one state, Kuai two, Xu’ao three.” (As noted in the "Among the People" chapter: “Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, turning their lands into desolate ruins.” This shows he did not follow Shun’s counsel.) Yet when he sat facing south, he could not feel at ease. Cheng comments: “‘At ease’ describes a joyful countenance.” (Note: *shi* here is interchangeable with *yi*. This passage also appears in the "Gengsang Chu" chapter.)

"Why is this so?" Shun replied: "Those three lords still dwell among the brambles and mugwort. *Dwell* means *remain*. (Cheng comments: “Brambles and mugwort are lowly grasses.”) If you do not feel at ease, what is the reason? Formerly, ten suns appeared at once. (As the *Huainanzi* states: “In Yao’s time, ten suns appeared together, and he sent Yi to shoot down nine of them.”) Thus I draw this analogy. All things were illuminated—how much more so the virtue that surpasses the sun!"

(Cheng comments: “*Surpass* means *exceed*. To suppress the desires of those dwelling in brambles and mugwort and force them to submit would hardly accord with the great Dao!") Yao and Shun serve as one proof.

Nie Que asked Wang Ni: (Li’s *Exegesis* reads: “Ni: Xu pronounces it *wǔ-jī*; Li’s *Sound and Meaning* gives another reading. The *Biographies of Eminent Recluses* states: ‘Wang Ni was a worthy man of Yao’s time.’ The ‘Heaven and Earth’ chapter calls him ‘Nie Que’s teacher.’”) "Do you know what things universally affirm?" He replied: "How would I know that?"

(Guo comments: “What is universally affirmed may not be right; what differs is not necessarily wrong. Neither side can correct the other, so there is no use for knowledge.")

"Do you know what you do not know?" (Cheng comments: “Since you do not know what things universally affirm, do you at least know what *you* do not know?”) He replied: "How would I know that?"

(Guo comments: “If you knew what you did not know, that would itself be knowledge—knowledge that would prevent you from letting all things find their own proper place.")

"Then are things without knowledge?" (Since you have no knowledge, are all things likewise without knowledge?) He replied: "How would I know that!"

(Cheng comments: “Not only do I not know myself, I also do not know things. Both self and things are forgotten, so there is nowhere to apply knowledge.")

Yet let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing?

(Li comments: “*Yong* means *use*; *ju* means *how*.”)

Here the commentator notes: "Minor knowledge still does not constitute true knowing—then not-knowing is not necessarily wrong."

Moreover, let me put this question to you: When people sleep in damp places, they develop lower back pain and partial paralysis—is that so? Yet loaches do not. When monkeys perch in trees, they tremble with fear—is that so? Yet gibbons do not. Which of these three knows the proper place to dwell? People, loaches, and gibbons—who knows what place is truly right?

People eat domesticated animals and grains; deer and elk graze on grass; centipedes relish snakes; owls and crows favor mice. Which of these four knows the proper taste? People, beasts, insects, and birds—who knows what flavor is truly right?

Gibbons mate with *bianju* apes; elk couple with deer and swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Lady Li are considered beauties by humans, yet fish dive deep at the sight of them, birds take flight, and deer bolt away. Which of these four knows the true standard of beauty in the world?

From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I discern their distinctions?"

Nie Que said: "If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfected Person likewise not know benefit and harm?"

Wang Ni replied: "The Perfected Person is divine: so utterly transcendent that great marshes may burn without scorching him, rivers and seas may freeze without chilling him, lightning may shatter mountains and winds shake the ocean without startling him. One such as this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Death and life bring no change to him—how much less the beginnings of benefit and harm!"

Ju Que asked Master Changwu: "I have heard from the Master—" (Master Changwu, so named for dwelling beneath a tall catalpa; some say his given name was Qiu.) (Yu comments: "Ju Que must have been a disciple of Confucius’ later generation. The Master here refers to Confucius. The line below, *'Qiu, how could he know such things?'* uses Confucius’ given name, showing that Ju Que cited Confucius’ words only to refute them. The later passage, *'Qiu and you are both dreaming—I say you are dreaming even of dreaming,'* where 'I' refers to Master Changwu himself, proves that Qiu cannot be Changwu’s name. If Qiu and you are both dreaming, and I am also dreaming, how could Qiu be Changwu’s name?")

"The sage does not engage in affairs; things come of themselves, and principle responds naturally—he does not pursue them. He does not seek profit, nor does he avoid harm. He does not delight in seeking, nor does he follow the Dao. He speaks without speaking, and when questioned, his silence is an answer. He speaks yet wishes to remain wordless, and roams beyond the dust and grime of the world."

The Master (Confucius) considered these careless, unbounded words—(Menglang: "aimless, without direction"; some say "without boundaries"; others, "rough and approximate"; still others, "broad and general.") But I regard them as the unfolding of the wondrous Dao.

"What do you think of this?" Longwuzi replied: "This is what even the Yellow Emperor found perplexing—how could one like Qiu (Confucius) claim to understand it?

Moreover, you have judged too hastily. It is like seeing an egg and demanding a rooster to crow at dawn, or spying a slingshot and expecting a roasted owl. I have spoken to you idly, and you have listened idly—what of it?

Embrace sun and moon, clasp the cosmos to your breast. *Shizi* says: 'The four directions of heaven and earth are called *yu*; past and present are called *zhou*.' *Shuowen* says: '*Zhou* is the utmost reach of boat and carriage.' Let your lips meet in harmony, set aside confusion and obscurity, and serve one another with the reverence of lowly bondsmen. The masses toil endlessly, while the sage appears dull and unknowing. Interweaving ten thousand years into a single seamless whole, myriad things are all thus, each enfolding the other.

How do I know that delight in life is not a delusion? How do I know that aversion to death is not like a youth who has lost his home and does not know where to return?

Lady Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first took her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. But once she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed, and feasted on fine meats, she regretted her tears. This too is but an analogy."

How do I know that those who have died do not regret their initial longing for life? In dreams, one who drinks wine may weep at dawn; one who weeps in dreams may hunt at dawn. While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even divine the dream—only upon waking does one know it was a dream. Yet the difference between waking and dreaming is itself a distinction. Only with the great awakening does one realize this was the great dream. Death is the great awakening, and life is the great dream. But fools believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their knowledge. They claim to know: "This one is a lord, that one a herdsman!" How rigid and shallow! How can one truly say who is noble as a ruler and who is base as a groom? Truly, they are trapped in their own crudeness.

You and I, Qiu, are both dreaming; when I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called *diaogui*—"arriving at the strange." When a great sage appears in ten thousand generations, one who understands these words, it is as if meeting them at dawn or dusk. A true interpreter is rare—one in ten thousand generations is like a morning or evening encounter.

If you and I were to debate, and you won while I did not, would you truly be right and I truly wrong? If I won while you did not, would I truly be right and you truly wrong? Or might one of us be right and the other wrong? Or could both be right or both be wrong? You and I cannot know for certain, and others are likewise shrouded in darkness. Whom could we appoint to judge? If we chose one who agrees with you, how could they judge fairly, already aligned with you? If we chose one who agrees with me, how could they judge fairly, already aligned with me? If we chose one who differs from both of us, how could they judge fairly, already differing from us? If we chose one who agrees with both of us, how could they judge fairly, already aligned with us? Thus, neither you nor I nor others can truly know—so must we wait for another?

If I align with them, they do not trust me; if they align with me, they do not submit. Setting up separate standards of right and wrong, both sides remain doubtful. Following others’ judgments, there is no fixed conclusion. Unable to know for certain, what is there to wait for? Such debates are utterly futile.

The mutual dependence of changing voices is like their non-dependence. Right and wrong, affirmation and negation—these lie with the person.

To deem something right or affirm it as so because others do so—this is no different from being self-affirmed and self-so, neither engaging the heart, as the following passage states.

Harmonize with the heavenly boundary, follow the boundless transformations—this is how one exhausts the years. Cheng comments: *"Heavenly" refers to the natural; "boundary" means division; "boundless transformations" are like ceaseless change. "Follow" means to yield. To harmonize with the natural divisions and yield to limitless transformation is to fulfill one’s allotted lifespan.*

What does it mean to "harmonize with the heavenly boundary"? It means: "Is it so or not? Is it thus or not?" If "is" is truly "is," then its difference from "is not" requires no debate. If "thus" is truly "thus," then its difference from "not thus" requires no debate. Cheng comments: *"Right and wrong, thus and not-thus arise from deluded emotions. When examined by reason, all is empty illusion—what is deemed 'right' is in fact 'wrong,' what is deemed 'thus' is in fact 'not thus.' How do we know this? If 'is' were definitively 'is,' then 'is' would differ from 'is not.' If 'thus' were definitively 'thus,' then 'thus' would differ from 'not thus.' Yet what one calls 'is,' another calls 'is not'; what one affirms as 'thus,' another denies. Thus, right and wrong, thus and not-thus, in principle are not distinct—it is only through mutual opposition that deluded distinctions arise, hence no debate is needed."*

Forget years, forget righteousness. Cheng comments: *"Years are what life is endowed with; since all share in life and death, years are forgotten. Righteousness is the judgment of right and wrong; since all is one in right and wrong, righteousness is forgotten."* Flourish in the boundless, thus lodge in the boundless. Cheng comments: *"Flourish means to expand; boundless means limitless. Lodge means to dwell."* When principle expands without end, the mind dwells without end—no need for debate.

Qūquè and Chángwū’s three proofs:
The hill-shadow asked the shadow: *"Formerly you walked, now you stand still; formerly you sat, now you rise—why are you so lacking in constancy?"* The shadow replied: *"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? I am like the snake’s ventral scales or the cicada’s wings—how could I be otherwise?"* Cheng comments: *"If one depended on wings to fly or feet to walk, there are many creatures—why single out the snake’s scales or cicada’s wings for comparison? The snake sheds its old skin, the cicada emerges with new wings, neither knowing why nor discerning how—they simply transform and live, without dependence. Thus, the relationship between form and shadow is no different from scales and wings."* The text asks: *"Do I resemble the snake’s scales or the cicada’s wings?"*—implying that even these have fixed forms, which is not entirely apt. *"How can I know why it is so? How can I know why it is not so?"* Cheng comments: *"Whether dependent or independent, thus or not-thus, the heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself—none knows its master."*

The hill-shadow and shadow’s four proofs:
Once, Zhuāng Zhōu dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering joyfully as a butterfly, self-content and at ease. Lǐ comments: *"Content means delighted."*

He delighted in fulfilling his will—*yú* sounding like "remain." He knew not that he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, palpably Zhou. Cheng comments: *"Qúqú* describes the startled manner of awakening." Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things.

Though Zhou and the butterfly must have their divisions, in the moment of dreaming and awakening, he knew not the boundary between Zhou and butterfly—calling Zhou the butterfly is possible, calling the butterfly Zhou is also possible. Here, the two become one in transformation. This is the fifth proof, demonstrated through personal experience, reaching the ultimate realm of *equalizing things.*

**Chapter Three: The Secret of Nurturing Life**

To follow affairs without being ensnared by things, to merge with emotions without disturbing one’s nature—this is the guiding principle of Zhuangzi’s art of nurturing life. Our life is bounded, while knowledge is boundless. Life has its limits, but knowledge knows no shore. To pursue the boundless with the bounded is perilous. Guo Xiang comments: *"Dài* means exhaustion." And to persist in being one who "knows" is even more perilous. *Yǐ* means "to stop." Clinging to thoughts after the moment has passed brings even greater exhaustion. This speaks of engaging with things to no benefit for one’s nature and life.

In doing good, do not seek fame; in doing evil, do not court punishment. Wang Fuzhi comments: *"Things like sensual pleasures, which cannot be called good, are thus evil."* This is a superficial interpretation. Follow the *dū* as your constant guide. Li Yi comments: *"Yuán* means to follow; *dū* means the center; *jīng* means constancy."* Li Zhen comments: *"In the human body, only the spine is central; the *dū* meridian runs upward along the spine, hence its meaning as 'center.'" Wang Fuzhi comments: *"The *dū* is the central channel at the back of the body. To 'follow the *dū*' is to let the subtle, refined qi flow along the void, naturally attaining the center."* This is a profound interpretation. Thus, one can preserve the body, perfect life (fulfilling the principle of one’s existence), nourish one’s kin (returning to them what was received from them, the ultimate form of nourishment), and live out one’s allotted years. The years granted by heaven should be allowed to run their course without premature truncation, so that what is finite becomes infinite. This introduces the central theme of the chapter, which is then illustrated through five analogies.

Butcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. The *Shiwen* notes: *"Ding was his name. Cui and Sima state: 'Lord Wenhui was King Hui of Liang.'" Cheng comments: *"Xiè* means to butcher."* Where his hand touched, his shoulder leaned, his foot pressed, his knee braced—*yǐ* as Su Yu explains: *"The *Shuowen* says: '*Yǐ* means one foot.' When the knee is raised, the foot stands alone, hence the term."*—the skin and bone parted with a *huò* sound, the blade resounded with a *huō* noise. Sima comments: *"Huò* is the sound of skin and bone separating."* Cui comments: *"Huò* sounds like *huà*; *huō* is close to *huò*, but louder."* Cheng comments: *"The *huò* sound answered in turn, the phoenix knife advanced, and the great dismemberment came with a *huō*."* Every cut struck the right note, harmonizing with the dance of *Sanglin*. Sima comments: *"Sanglin* was the name of a piece of Tang music."* Cui comments: *"It was the name of a dance in Song."* The *Shiwen* adds: *"As in the *Zuozhuan*: 'The dance master marked the rhythm with the *xia* banner.'" It matched the rhythm of *Jingshou*. Xiang and Sima comment: *"Jingshou* was a movement in the *Xianchi* music, the music of Yao."* Xuan comments: *"Huì* means rhythm."* Lord Wenhui exclaimed: *"Ah! How could skill reach such heights?"* Li comments: *"An exclamation of admiration."*

The Cook put down his knife and replied: *"What your servant delights in is the Dao, which surpasses mere skill. When I first began to dismember oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole. Now, I encounter it with my spirit rather than observe it with my eyes—my senses halt, yet my spirit moves. As Xiang comments: *'Meeting it in darkness with the principle.'* As Cheng explains: *'The senses are the governing faculties.'* Here, *'senses'* refers specifically to the eyes. While the eyes still perceive its traces, the spirit has already dissected its form. I follow the natural patterns—*as Cheng notes: *'Following the ox’s natural seams.'*—striking the great gaps, as the *Zilin* defines: *'Striking means to strike.'* As Cheng explains: *'The great gaps are the spaces where seams intersect.'* Guo pronounces *xi* as *que*. I guide the blade through the great cavities, as Guo Qingfan observes: *'Kuan* should read *kuan*, meaning 'hollow.' As the *Hanshu* annotation to Sima Qian’s biography states: *'Kuan* means empty.' It refers to the hollows in the joints." I rely on what is inherently so, never touching the network of vessels, flesh-bound nodes, or knotted sinews. As Yu comments: *'Ji* is likely a corruption of *zhi* (branches). *Zhi* refers to branch vessels; *jing* to main vessels. *Zhijing* thus means 'vessels and channels.' The *Suwen*, citing Wang’s commentary on the *Lingshu Jing*, states: *'Main vessels run internally; branches that extend transversely are called collaterals.'* *Zhi* and *zhi* are interchangeable. Where vessels and channels intersect, the blade’s movement would be obstructed—but I follow what is inherently so, so there is no obstruction." As the *Shiwen* notes: *"Ken* refers to flesh adhering to bone. Sima comments: *'Qi* means the knotted places.'" Thus, the branch vessels, main vessels, flesh-bound nodes, and knotted sinews are all places the blade has never reached—let alone the great bones!" *Gu* is pronounced *gu*.

Cui comments: *"Pan* means coiled around bone." A skilled butcher replaces his knife every year—he uses it for cutting. An ordinary butcher replaces his knife every month—he uses it for breaking. Cui explains: *"Zu* means 'the many.'" Yu notes: "This refers to breaking bone, not the knife breaking. The *Zuozhuan* states: *'Do not break the bone.'"*

Now my knife has been in use for nineteen years, having dissected several thousand oxen, yet its blade remains as if newly whetted on the grindstone. Between the joints there is space, and the blade of the knife has no thickness. Entering with what has no thickness into what has space, how vast is the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, my knife’s edge is still as if newly whetted.

Yet whenever I come to a complex joint—Guo explains: "Where sinews and bones intertwine densely is called *zu*"—I perceive the difficulty, grow cautious, focus my gaze—Guo explains: "Not letting the eyes wander elsewhere"—slow my movement—Guo explains: "Moving the hand with deliberation"—and apply the knife with utmost precision. At once, with a *huo* sound, the ox falls apart, like earth crumbling to the ground.

I raise the knife and stand, look around in satisfaction, then wipe the blade clean—Guo explains: "*Chouchu* means the ease of a well-fed horse, the self-contentment of one at leisure." (Note: The *Tian Zifang* chapter also states: "Now he hesitates in satisfaction, now he looks around in pride.") I then put the knife carefully away.

Wenhui Lord said: "Excellent! From the words of Cook Ding, I have learned the Way of nurturing life."

Though oxen are many, the blade is not harmed; though things are varied, the mind is not burdened—these are all principles of nurturing life. A single metaphor.

Lord Gongwen Xuan, upon seeing the Right Minister, exclaimed in surprise: "What manner of man is this? Why does he have but one foot? Was this given by Heaven, or is it the work of man?" The commentator Sima explains: "Is this by Heaven's decree, or by human agency?"

The Right Minister replied: "It is Heaven, not man. Heaven's creation of him made him thus singular." Sima comments: "Singular here means one-footed." (Note: This differs from the three amputees in the *Virtue's Full Manifestation* chapter—his deformity is Heaven-sent, theirs the result of human misfortune.) "Man's appearance is bestowed by Heaven. As Guo explains: 'Two feet walk side by side.' Thus we know this is of Heaven, not of man." Though his form is impaired, his spirit remains whole. To know Heaven is to dwell in compliance. A second metaphor.

The marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. "Seek" here means "expect." The same usage appears below. Li explains: "A cage is a pen, used to confine birds." Though its spirit may flourish, it is not at ease. "Not at ease" means it does not find contentment. Birds in the marsh are free; in a cage, they are constrained. When men are bound by glory and splendor, they inevitably lose their proper nurturance. A third metaphor.

When Lao Dan died—Sima comments: "Laozi." (Note: Laozi's lifespan is unknown; this is used illustratively.)—Qin Shi went to offer condolences. He cried out three times and departed.

His disciples asked: "Was he not your friend?"
"Yes."
"Then is such a brief mourning fitting?"
"Yes. At first, I thought him a true man—one who does not die. But now I see he was not. When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their mothers. In their gathering, there must have been those who spoke without intending to speak, who wept without intending to weep. This is what is meant by 'gaining trust without words, achieving harmony without contrivance.'" "Gathering" refers to social interaction; "speaking" refers to praise. Laozi's sincerity could move others, so my silence has its own explanation. This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling back on one's nature, forgetting what one has received. "Fleeing" here may also be written as "遯." "Nature" refers to what Master Hui calls "nature," as seen in the *Virtue's Full Manifestation* chapter. "Received" means the form one is given. The ancients called this "the punishment of fleeing from Heaven." This phrase also appears in the *Lie Yukou* chapter. In *Virtue's Full Manifestation*, Confucius is described as bearing Heaven's punishment, so "fleeing Heaven's punishment" is a term of praise. Previous interpretations have all been mistaken.

"When he came, it was his time; when he departed, it was his compliance. To rest in one's time and dwell in compliance is to be beyond the reach of sorrow or joy. The ancients called this 'the Great Release.'" "Release" is pronounced *xuan*. Cheng explains: "The Great refers to Heaven." (Note: The *Great Master* chapter states: "Gaining is one's time; losing is one's compliance. To rest in one's time and dwell in compliance is to be beyond the reach of sorrow or joy. This is what the ancients called the Great Release." This passage closely parallels the present text. "Coming and going" and "gaining and losing" both refer to life and death.) Guo's commentary in *Virtue's Full Manifestation* also says: "Life is my time; death is my compliance. Time is my gathering; compliance is my dispersal. Heaven endows man with nature, which is the 'suspension.' To darken one's nature and follow the course is Heaven's Great Release." Since the Master has died, why should I grieve? A fourth metaphor.

"When the finger is exhausted in splitting wood for kindling, the finger may reach its limit, but the kindling will also be exhausted in time. Yet the fire is transmitted, and its end is unknown. Though the form departs, the spirit remains ever-present—this is the ultimate principle of nurturing life. The kindling has its limit, but the fire knows no end." A fifth metaphor.

**Book IV: "Among the World of Men"**
"Among the world of men" refers to the present age. To serve a tyrannical ruler, to dwell in a corrupt world, to engage with others—one must not contend for fame but conceal one’s virtue: this is the way to preserve oneself whole. At the end, it cites the song of Jie Yu: *"The world to come cannot be awaited; the world gone by cannot be pursued."* This is how the Master of the Varnished Garden expressed his lament, naming the chapter *"Among the World of Men."*

Yan Hui sought leave of Confucius to depart. Confucius asked, *"Where are you going?"* Yan Hui replied, *"I am going to Wei."* Confucius asked, *"What will you do there?"* Yan Hui said, *"I have heard that the Lord of Wei—"* (Sima Biao notes: *"The Lord of Wei refers to Duke Zhuang, Kuai Kui."* However, according to the *Zuozhuan*, Duke Zhuang entered the state in the winter of the fifteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, by which time Yan Hui had already died. This must refer to Duke Chu, his successor.) (Yao Nai comments: *"The Lord of Wei is a pretext, pointing to those rulers of the time who ravaged their people."*) *"—is in his prime, yet his conduct is singular and self-willed. He treats his state lightly and conscripts the people without restraint. Yet he does not perceive his own faults."* (Guo Xiang notes: *"None dare admonish him."*) *"He treats the deaths of his people as lightly as deploying troops. The dead are measured by the state as if filling a marsh—like rushes set aflame, the people of the state perish in such numbers that, if compared to the land, it is as though they were scorched by fire."* (Guo Songtao notes: *"Jiao* 蕉 *is interchangeable with* jiao *焦. The* Zuozhuan *of Duke Cheng’s ninth year writes* jiao cui *蕉萃, while Ban Gu’s* "Rhapsody on the Guest" *writes* jiao cui *焦瘁. The* Guangya *states: ‘*Jiao *means black.’"*) *"The people have nowhere to turn."*

"Formerly, I once heard you say, Master: *'A well-governed state—leave it,'* as Xuān comments, *'Nothing to attend to.'* *'A disordered state—go to it,'* as Xuān comments, *'Desiring to aid its salvation.'* *'The physician’s gate teems with illness.'*—this is a metaphor. Wishing to reflect upon what I have heard and ponder its principles,'* as Cuī and Lǐ comment, *'Principles, that is, models,'* *'might my state yet find recovery?'* as Lǐ comments, *'Recovery means healing.'*

Confucius said, *'Alas! You will likely go only to suffer punishment!'* as Chéng comments, *'You—if you go, you will fear being executed.'* *The Way does not tolerate admixture. Admixture breeds multiplicity; multiplicity breeds disturbance; disturbance breeds anxiety; anxiety admits no salvation.'* as Chéng comments, *'The Way lies in purity. Admixture spawns a tangle of affairs; affairs multiply and the mind becomes disordered; disorder gives rise to anxiety. When remedy and malady are at odds, both parties are confounded. If one cannot even establish oneself, how can one save others?'*

*The perfected of antiquity first established themselves before establishing others,'* as Chéng comments, *'Established means secured.'* *If what is established within oneself remains unsettled, how can one presume to reach the conduct of a violent ruler? Reach here means to attain.'* *Violent ruler refers to the Lord of Wèi.*

*Moreover, do you truly understand whence virtue’s dissipation arises, and from what knowledge emerges? Virtue dissipates through fame; knowledge emerges through contention.'* as Chéng comments, *'Virtue’s dissipation and loss of authenticity stem from pride in fame. Knowledge’s transgressive emergence beyond its proper bounds arises from competition for excellence.'*

*Fame is that by which men mutually injure one another; knowledge is the instrument of contention. Both are instruments of misfortune, not the means to fully enact the Way.'* as Chéng comments, *'Injure means to harm.'* *Note: Both are instruments of calamity, not the means to fully realize the way of the world.* As Sū Yǔ comments, *'To heal a state is a fine reputation; to treat illness is to display much knowledge. Proceeding with such a mindset, the seeds of contention and injury are already sown—hence, instruments of misfortune.'*

*This is speaking superficially; below, it delves deeper. Even without the intent to contend for fame or employ knowledge, merely wielding the language of benevolence, righteousness, plumb-line, and ink-mark to admonish a ruler is still insufficient to traverse a disordered age and escape disaster—how much less so if one carries instruments of misfortune and proceeds!*

*Moreover, though one’s virtue be profound and trust solid as stone, it may not yet penetrate the qi of others; though one’s reputation be uncontentious, it may not yet reach the hearts of others.'* as Jiǎnwén comments, *'Solid as stone describes sincerity and substance.'* *Note: Though one be sincere and profound without employing knowledge, one may not yet win the confidence of others’ vital essence; though one contend not for fame, one may not yet comprehend others’ hearts and minds—people will surely suspect you.*

*Yet to forcibly present the language of benevolence, righteousness, plumb-line, and ink-mark before a violent ruler is to make others resent what is beautiful in you,'* as the *Shìwén* notes, *'Forcibly has two readings.'* *Shù here means to expound.* As Guō Sōngtāo comments, *'In the* Lǐjì’s *"Rhapsody on Sacrifice,"* "and expounding it to examine it," *Zhèng’s commentary reads:* "Expounding should be written as narrating." *Note: If one acts thus, it is as though one possesses beauty oneself, and others will surely resent it.*

*To call this "disastering others." One who disasters others will surely have disaster visited upon them in return. How perilous it would be to become a disaster to others!'* as Chéng comments, *'Call means to name.'* as the *Shìwén* notes, *'Disaster is pronounced zāi.'*

*Moreover, if one delights in worthiness and detests unworthiness, what need is there to seek distinction? You—if the Lord of Wèi truly loved good and hated evil, his court would abound with upright men. What need would there be for you to seek distinction?'*

*If you remain utterly silent, the king and duke will surely exploit your vulnerabilities and contend for victory in eloquence.'* as Chéng comments, *'Admonition means speech. King and duke refers to the Lord of Wèi.'* *They will dazzle your eyes, level your countenance, entangle your speech, manifest in your demeanor, and shape your heart. This is using fire to fight fire, water to fight water—what is called "increasing excess." Once begun, there is no end.'* as Guō Qìngfān comments, *'Dazzle is a loan for* míng *(●), from the* Shuōwén*: "● means confusion. From eye, with* yíng *省 as phonetic."'* as Chéng comments, *'Manifest means to appear.'* *Your eyes will be confounded, your countenance will humble itself, your mouth will scramble to defend, your demeanor will grow ever more reverent, and your heart will abandon its own rightness to conform to their wrongs. Their evils are already manifold, and you will only add to them. Having begun thus, you will follow without end.*

*How perilous it is to speak profoundly before earning trust!'* as Xuān comments, *'Not yet trusted yet offering deep admonition.'* *Note: This "how" is read as "if." You will surely die before the violent ruler.*

*Moreover, in ancient times, Jié executed Guān Lóngféng, and Zhòu executed Prince Bǐgān—both cultivated their persons and, humbling themselves, cherished the people,'* as Lǐ comments, *'Cherished means to show compassion.'* as Xuān comments, *'People here refers to the ruler.'* *They served those below in defiance of their superiors, and thus their rulers, seizing upon their cultivation, cast them out. They were lovers of fame. Seizing upon their love of cultivation and fame, they ensnared them. This is one proof.*

*Formerly, Yáo attacked Cóngzhī and Xū’áo, and Yǔ attacked Yǒuhù—three states. Their lands became wastelands and their people vengeful ghosts,'* as Xuān comments, *'Their lands became ruins, their people became malevolent spirits.'* *Their persons suffered punishment and execution. Their use of arms did not cease; their pursuit of substance knew no end. Pursuit of substance means greed for profit. These three states were thus, so Yáo and Yǔ attacked and annihilated them. They were seekers of fame and substance. This is a second proof.*

As Sū Yǔ comments, *'Lóngféng and Bǐgān cultivated virtue, yet Jié and Zhòu deemed them lovers of fame and thus cast them out. Jié and Zhòu, resenting that upright ministers possessed beauty while they themselves were ashamed to be tyrannical kings, were also lovers of fame. Cóngzhī, Xū’áo, and Yǒuhù, ceaselessly employing arms to seek substance, were attacked and annihilated by Yáo and Yǔ—who themselves were not without the pursuit of substance.'*"

"Thus it is said, *'These were all seekers of fame and substance.'* Have you alone not heard this? Fame and substance are what even the sage cannot overcome—how much less could one such as you! The Master once more recounted what he had heard to instruct him.

He spoke of rulers who occupy the name of lofty position and possess the substance of awe-inspiring power: even if a sage were to serve as their minister, he could not but be bent to their will—how much less could you! Yet if you must have some means, then come, try and tell me!"

*(Here "means" refers to the instruments by which one might hold fast.)*

*(The word "try" means to attempt.)*

Yan Hui said, "If I were upright yet humble, solemn yet modest, and diligent yet single-minded, would that suffice?"

The Master replied, "Bah! How could that suffice? When one’s yang qi is so full that it bursts forth in ostentation, when one’s countenance shifts without constancy—these are things the common man dare not oppose. Instead, one suppresses what moves others, seeking to indulge one’s own heart. As Cheng says, *'Suppresses' means to restrain; 'indulge' means to take pleasure. When others are moved by admonition, one instead crushes them to gratify one’s own desires.* Such a one may be said to lack even the virtue of daily gradual cultivation—how much less could he attain great virtue! He clings rigidly to his own views, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unexamined. As Xuan says, *'He believes himself to be right.' 'Outwardly compliant' means appearing to agree, while 'inwardly unexamined' means lacking self-reflection.* As Yao Nai says, *'Unmeasured' means not weighing the meaning of a gentleman’s words.* How could this ever be acceptable?"

"Then," Yan Hui continued, "what if I were inwardly straight but outwardly yielding, and took the ancients as my model?

*('Then' marks the beginning of Yan Hui’s further response.)*

By 'inwardly straight,' I mean aligning myself with Heaven. One who aligns with Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven—so why should I seek that others deem my words good or bad? As Cheng says, *'Inwardly sincere and straight, one joins the company of natural principle.'* As Xuan says, *'The Son of Heaven is the ruler of men.'* As Guo says, *'All people, regardless of rank, receive life equally. Thus, whether good or bad, one leaves it to impartial judgment, seeking nothing from others.'* One who does so is called a childlike innocent—this is what it means to align with Heaven. By 'outwardly yielding,' I mean aligning with others. Raising the tablet, kneeling upright, bowing deeply—these are the rites of a minister. Everyone else does them; how could I alone refuse? One who does what others do incurs no blame—this is what it means to align with others.

By 'taking the ancients as my model,' I mean aligning with antiquity. As Cheng says, *'Admonishing with loyalty is accomplished in the present; the righteousness of ruler and minister is compared to antiquity.'* Though my words may resemble ancient teachings, they carry the substance of reproof. What the ancients had, I do not possess. One who does so may be straight yet free from harm. As Guo says, *'By lodging one’s straightness in antiquity, one avoids bringing harm upon oneself.'* This is what it means to align with antiquity. If I were thus, would that suffice?"

Confucius said, "Alas! How could this suffice? Excessive governance—*Guo*: 'When principle admits no duality, yet one imposes threefold regulations to govern, this is what is called excessive governance.'*—though lawful, is not expedient. *Yu*: 'These four characters form a phrase. In the *Liezi* it says, "Form expedites the completion of radiance." The *Shiwen* glosses *die* as 'convenient and artful.' Here, *die* carries the same meaning: to have laws yet not be artful.' Though steadfast, one remains blameless—though not grand, one may avoid fault. Yet this is all there is to it; how could it reach transformation? It is insufficient to transform others—it is still to follow one’s own mind." *Cheng*: "To follow what is in one’s mind."

Yan Hui said, "I have no further progress to make. May I ask for the method?"

Confucius said, "Fast. I shall tell you! To do this while still possessing [intent]—is it easy? *Guo*: 'To act with intent in mind is truly not easy.' Those who find it easy contravene the vastness of Heaven and are unfit." *Cheng*: "*Er Ya*: 'Summer is called *haotian*.' This refers to its qi being vast and expansive." *Note*: This contradicts the principle of natural emptiness. *Su Yu*: "Those who find it easy still follow their own minds. To lose one’s original mind is to violate Heaven." This interpretation also accords with the meaning.

Yan Hui said, "My family is poor. For months now, I have abstained from wine and meat. Would this suffice as fasting?"

Confucius said, "This is the fasting of sacrificial rites, not the fasting of the mind."

Yan Hui said, "May I ask about the fasting of the mind?"

Confucius said, "Unify your will—*Xuan*: 'Do not let it be mixed.'—do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; *Cheng*: 'Empty the ear-root, concentrate the spirit to align with the mind.' do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. *Cheng*: 'The mind possesses awareness and still gives rise to attachments; qi is without emotion or thought, empty and yielding, responsive to things. Thus, abandon that awareness and take up this emptiness and yielding. Progress through successive relinquishments to ascend to the mysterious.' Hearing stops at the ears—*Xuan*: 'Stops at the form.' *Yu*: 'This should read, "The ears stop at hearing," transposed in transmission. This elaborates the meaning of "do not listen with the ears": the ears’ function stops at hearing alone, hence one does not listen with the ears.' The mind stops at alignment. *Yu*: 'This elaborates the meaning of "do not listen with the mind": the mind’s function stops at alignment alone, hence one does not listen with the mind. *Fu* means to accord; to accord with things is not the same as being empty and awaiting things.' Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. *Yu*: 'This elaborates the meaning of qi.' *Xuan*: 'Qi has no origin; this is emptiness.' Only the Dao abides in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind." *Cheng*: "Only this true Dao abides in the empty mind. Thus, emptiness is the wondrous Dao of the fasting of the mind."

Yan Hui said, "Before receiving your instruction, I could not practice this fasting of the mind. In truth, it was still I—still seeing myself as Hui. Now that I have received your teaching, it is as though there were no Hui. *Cheng*: 'Having received the command, one forgets both things and self.' Can this be called emptiness?"

The Master said, "It is complete. *Cheng*: 'The wondrousness of the fasting of the mind is complete.' I shall tell you! If you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by its fame—when you enter Wei, you may wander within its borders without being swayed by empty reputation—speak when my words enter, and cease when they do not. *Cheng*: 'If my words enter, then speak; if they do not, then temporarily desist.' Have no gate, no embankment—*Xuan*: 'Do not open a single crevice, do not administer a single remedy.' *Guo*: 'Let things be as they are—this is having no gate. Entrust the world to its own peace—this is having no embankment.' *Li Zhen*: '*Men* and *du* form a parallel construction; *du* is not of the same category as *men*. The *Shuowen* says, "*Du*: thickness. Harmful grasses often grow abundantly." This meaning does not fit. *Du* is likely a loan for *dao*. Under *dao* in the *Shuowen*, it says, "To protect; also called high earth; read like *du*." This aligns with Guo’s gloss of "self-peace." Zhang Xingfu’s *Shuowen Fayi* says, "*Dao* is earth piled into a platform for transmitting signals, as in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*: 'Build a high *bao* to pray on the royal road, place a drum upon it, so that those far and near may hear.' *Dao* is a corruption of *bao*. *Dao* is a place of protection and defense, hence its meaning is borrowed for protection.' The *Zhouyi* says, 'With this, one embankments the world, and the people follow'; Laozi says, 'Level it, embankment it'—in these three instances, *du* carries this meaning. The *Guangya* says, '*Du*: peace.' This is also this sense.' *Note*: Xuan’s explanation, based on the surface of the text, is not as fitting as Li’s interpretation. A gate is that by which one may follow a path; an embankment is that by which one may gaze as a marker."

Without gates, without embankments—this leaves no trace for others to spy or point toward. Dwelling in a single abode within the realm of necessity, one approaches the subtle. Cheng says: "An abode is a dwelling place. To reside in the Dao of utmost unity, responding only when unavoidable and not through premeditation—this is to be nearly there." To erase one’s tracks is easy; to walk without leaving a trace upon the earth is difficult. Xuan says: "In navigating the world, not acting is easy; acting without imprinting traces is hard." To be employed by man is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. Cheng says: "Human sentiments drive and compel, shallow and easily deceived; Heaven’s natural command is enacted yet hard to distort." We have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; we have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. *Shiwen* notes: "The first *zhi* is read as 'wisdom,' the second as the common word." Xuan says: "To move by spirit, to illuminate by stillness." Gazing upon that emptiness, the empty chamber generates whiteness. Sima says: "Emptiness is void. The chamber is a metaphor for the heart. When the heart is empty and void, pure whiteness arises alone." Cheng says: "That is the preceding realm. Observing the myriad existences, all are ultimately empty and still—thus one may empty the chamber of the heart and thereby illuminate the true source." Auspiciousness rests. Cheng says: "Auspicious blessings rest in the heart of concentrated stillness, which can also bring forth good responses." Yu says: "The repetition of *zhi* in 'rests rests' serves no meaningful purpose. The *Huainanzi*’s *Chuzhen Xun* states: 'The empty chamber generates whiteness; auspiciousness rests.' It is likely that the second *zhi* in this text is also a corruption of *ye* ('also'). Lu Chongyuan’s commentary on the *Liezi*’s *Tianrui* chapter reads: 'The empty chamber generates whiteness; auspiciousness rests alone'—this also confirms the error of the repeated *zhi*." *Note*: The second *zhi* may be a corruption of *zhi* ("it"). If one does not rest, this is called sitting while galloping. When the spirit roams outward without settling, the body sits while the heart races. If one follows the ears and eyes to communicate inwardly while excluding the heart’s knowledge, even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men! Li says: "*Xun* means 'to employ.'" Xuan says: "The ears and eyes are external, yet one employs them inwardly; the heart’s wisdom is internal, yet one banishes it outwardly." Cheng says: "With an empty mind that accommodates things, ghosts and spirits will obscurely attach and dwell. Human relationships will naturally follow suit." This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot upon which Yu and Shun acted, the path that Fuxi and Jiqu brought to completion—how much more so for those who are scattered and dispersed! This is the guiding principle by which Yu and Shun responded to things, the conduct and cessation of the ancient sage-kings—how could those who are merely scattered individuals not be transformed by it? Cheng says: "Jiqu refers to the rulers before the Three Sovereigns, who left no written records." Su Yu says: "This means that understanding this enables one to become an emperor or king, to govern the world—how much more so for a fragmented, scattered person!" This interpretation is also valid.

Lord Ye of Zigao was about to be sent on a mission to Qi. He asked Confucius: "The king’s charge to me, Zhu Liang, is most weighty." Cheng says: "The commission is of great importance." "Qi’s treatment of envoys will likely be outwardly respectful but slow in action." Xuan says: "They will appear respectful but delay in addressing matters." "Even a common man cannot be moved lightly—how much less a feudal lord! I am deeply fearful." *Li* means "fear." "You often told me, Zhu Liang: 'In matters great or small, few are not brought to joyful completion through the Dao. In affairs of any size, few are not successfully resolved through the Dao with joyful accord. If the matter fails, there will inevitably be human-caused calamities—the king will surely impose punishment. If it succeeds, there will inevitably be afflictions from yin and yang.'" Xuan says: "Joy and fear will clash, and the two qi of yin and yang will be harmed, leading to illness." "Only one with virtue can ensure that, whether the matter succeeds or fails, no calamity follows." Cheng says: "To entrust success or failure to the path ahead without allowing joy or sorrow to burden the heart—only a person of great virtue can do this." *The above recounts your words.* Su Yu says: "This means that in matters without success or failure, one can ultimately avoid calamity only through great virtue." *Note*: Cheng’s interpretation somewhat resembles Zhang Jun’s defeat at Fuli, which cannot serve as a model. Su’s interpretation is correct.

"In my daily life, I hold to coarse fare without seeking refinement," Xuan says: "Content with simple, rough food, not pursuing fine delicacies." "My cooking fire requires no one to seek coolness," Cheng says: "Cool here means cool air. Yet the fire is not excessive, so there is no heat to avoid." "Now, having received my morning orders, by evening I drink ice—is this not internal heat within me? The cause of burning anxiety. I have not yet reached the truth of the matter," Xuan says: "Not yet arrived at the actual execution of the task," "yet I already suffer afflictions from yin and yang. If the matter fails, there will surely be human-caused calamity—the king will impose punishment. These are two dangers. As a minister, I am not equal to such a burden. You must have something to tell me!"

Confucius said: "Under heaven there are two great precepts," Cheng says: "Precepts here mean laws." "The first is fate; the second is duty. Your love for your parents is fate, something the heart cannot untie—received from heaven, naturally and firmly bound. Serving one’s lord is duty: there is no place where he is not your lord, nowhere to escape within heaven and earth," Cheng says: "There has never been a land without a lord under heaven." "These are called the great precepts. Therefore, in serving one’s parents, one finds peace without choosing the place," regardless of circumstances, seeking only their comfort—"this is the utmost of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds peace without choosing the task," Cheng says: "Whether the task is smooth or perilous, one accepts it as fate," "this is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, sorrow and joy do not alter what lies before it," Wang Niansun says: "*Shi* should be read as *yi* (alter). This means unchanging. The *Yanzi Chunqiu*’s *Waipian* says 'lord and minister alter their positions,' the *Xunzi*’s *Ruxiao* chapter says 'sorrow and emptiness alter each other,' and the *Hanshu*’s *Wei Wan zhuan* says 'what people alter,' all sharing this meaning. Stated directly, it is *yi shi* (altering); inverted, it is *shi yi* (altered)." Xuan says: "Serving the heart as one serves lord and parents, without choosing—though the circumstances of sorrow and joy differ, one does not allow them to alter what lies before." "Knowing the inevitable yet accepting it as fate—this is the utmost of virtue. As a minister or child, one is fundamentally constrained by what cannot be avoided. Proceeding according to the truth of the matter, one forgets oneself," *qing* here means reality. "How then could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death?" Xuan says: "How could one still suffer afflictions from yin and yang?" "You may proceed thus! I shall now repeat what I have heard: In all relations," referring to neighboring states, "those near must rely on trust in their closeness," Xuan says: "Mutually cherishing trust in their conduct." "Those far must be loyal in their words," Xuan says: "Mutually assured through speech." "Words must sometimes be conveyed by others," Xuan says: "One must entrust messengers to transmit them." "Conveying words of mutual joy or mutual anger between rulers—this is the most difficult task under heaven. When both are pleased, there will be much exaggerated praise; when both are angry, there will be much exaggerated slander," Guo says: "*Yi* means excess. Words spoken in joy or anger often exceed what is proper." "All exaggeration is akin to falsehood," Cheng says: "*Lei* means resemblance. It resembles making people fabricate falsely." "Falsehood then makes trust impossible," Cheng says: "*Mo* conveys suspicion." "Suspicion then brings misfortune to the messenger. Thus, the *Fayan* says," citing an ancient maxim (the *Fayan* by Yang Xiong takes its name from this). "'Convey the constant truth,'" Xuan says: "Only transmit what is plain and real." "'Do not convey exaggerated words,'" Guo says: "Though one hears excessive words spoken in the moment, do not transmit them." "'Then one may nearly preserve wholeness.'" Xuan says: "One may nearly preserve oneself." *Note*: End of citation from the *Fayan*.

"Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with openness but invariably end in secrecy; when the struggle grows intense, many strange tactics emerge." *Shiwen* notes: "*Da* is read as *tai*, also written as 泰." *Note*: Contending with strength belongs to yang, but seeking victory ends in yin schemes; when the desire to win becomes extreme, a hundred devious tricks arise. "Those who drink with ritual begin with order but invariably end in chaos; when the drinking grows excessive, many strange pleasures arise. Ritual drinking resembles order, but once drunk, it ends in confusion; when intoxication reaches its height, every kind of indulgence follows. All things are likewise: they begin with sincerity but invariably end in vulgarity."

"Xuan comments: '*Liang* means sincerity; *bi* means deceit.' Yu remarks: '*Liang* and *bi* do not form a proper antithesis. *Liang* is likely a scribal error for *zhu*. *Zhu* is read as *du*. The *Shi Jing* states, 'In Song there is Mengzhu,' while the *Records of the Grand Historian: Annals of Xia* writes it as 'Mingdu'—this is a case in point. 'Beginning with *du*, invariably ending in *bi*'—*du* and *bi* form a true antithesis. Due to the interchangeability of the character *zhu*, it was mistakenly written as *liang*, thus losing the original meaning. The *Huainanzi: Explanations of Dao* reads, 'Thus what begins with *du* commonly grows vast in *bi*,' which is drawn from the *Zhuangzi* and may be used to correct the text. The character *da* in that passage is an error for *zu*. See Wang’s *Miscellaneous Notes* for further discussion.'

What begins simply will invariably end in grandeur. Speech is like wind and waves: it comes as the wind rises, it surges as the waves swell. Action is a matter of gain and loss. Guo Songtao explains: '*Shi* means to possess and retain; *sang* means to indulge and abandon. *Shi* and *sang* are akin to gain and loss.' Wind and waves are easily stirred, and gain and loss are easily imperiled. Since gain and loss have no fixed outcome, it is said they are 'easily imperiled.'

Thus, anger arises without cause, and artful speech with biased words. The onset of anger has no other source—it commonly stems from artful words that exceed reality and biased speech that misses the mark. When a beast is dying, it does not choose its cries; its breath comes in ragged gasps, and in that moment, a vicious intent arises within. When a beast is cornered and near death, its cries are indiscriminate, and its pent-up fury remains. At such a time, it may turn its heart to malice, seeking to bite. This beastly malice serves as a metaphor for the ignoble intentions of petty men. When scrutiny becomes excessive, ignoble intentions inevitably arise in response, though one remains unaware of it. When demands for precision and exactitude grow too severe, others will respond with ignoble intentions, unaware of why they do so. If one remains unaware of this process, who can foresee where it will end?" Xuan comments:

"disaster will surely befall."

Thus, the *Fa Yan* states: "Do not alter decrees," as Cheng explains: "When the lord’s command is truly transmitted, it may not be changed." "Do not urge completion," as Cheng explains: "Do not labor to exhort or reward, forcing things to be accomplished." The quotation from the *Fa Yan* ends here.

Excess is an increase. If one goes beyond the original measure, it amounts to an amplification of words. Altering decrees and urging completion are perilous affairs—such matters will inevitably become precarious.

Good outcomes require time; evil outcomes cannot be undone. What is accomplished as good does not rest in a single moment; what is accomplished as evil will surely leave no time for correction. How can one not be cautious!

Moreover, riding things to roam the mind, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection. Xuan comments: "Following things to wander and lodge the mind, entrusting oneself to necessity in response without contrivance, to nurture the unmoving center of the mind—this is the ultimate principle of the Dao."

Why act in repayment? Guo comments: "Entrusting oneself to what is naturally repaid, why insist on deliberate action!"

It is best to deliver the command. This is the difficult part: merely conveying the lord’s command without inserting oneself—this is the challenge.

If it is a matter of human principles, it is not a true calamity.

When Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei, as the *Shi Wen* notes: "Yan He, a worthy man of Lu. The crown prince was Kuai Kui," he asked Qu Boyu, "There is a man here whose virtue is heaven-sent destruction—by nature, he delights in killing. If I deal with him without restraint, he will endanger our state." Xuan comments: "If one indulges his transgressions, he will surely overthrow the nation." "If I deal with him with restraint, he will endanger my person." "If I regulate him with laws and standards, he will first harm me."

"His knowledge suffices only to recognize others’ faults but not the cause of those faults." As the *Shi Wen* notes: "His knowledge, pronounced as *zhi*." He only knows how to blame others, not his own errors.

"In such a case, what am I to do?"

Qu Boyu said, "Excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious—first rectify yourself! First seek to be without fault yourself.

In form, nothing is better than closeness; in mind, nothing is better than harmony." Xuan comments: "Outwardly, show the form of intimate attachment; inwardly, harbor the intent of harmonious compliance."

"Yet even these two have their dangers." Xuan comments: "They are still not perfectly good."

Closeness must not become intrusion; harmony must not become overt. Attachment must not run too deep, lest one fail to guard against his excesses; compliance must not be too apparent, lest one fail to guide his tendencies.

If form becomes too close and intrusive, it will lead to collapse, ruin, destruction, and downfall. Collapse means falling; ruin means annihilation; destruction means breaking; downfall means stumbling.

If the mind becomes too harmonious and overt, it will lead to reputation, fame, misfortune, and calamity. Guo comments: "If one displays harmony, it will give rise to a reputation for bearing disgrace; if one aids his fame, he will resent being surpassed and falsely generate misfortune and calamity."

If he acts like a child, then act like a child with him—this is a metaphor for lacking discernment.

If he acts without boundaries, then act without boundaries with him—this is a metaphor for minor transgressions.

If he acts without limits, then act without limits with him—this means not establishing rigid barriers.

Understand him, and enter into flawlessness. Follow his intentions to comprehend them, and thereby enter into a state without blemish.

Do you not know the mantis? It brandished its arms to block the wheel tracks of a chariot, unaware that it was unequal to the task—such was the beauty of its talent.

Be vigilant, be cautious! If one accumulates boasting and beauty to provoke him, it will be perilous indeed. *Er* means "you." *Fa* means "to boast of merit." Beauty cannot be relied upon; if you accumulate your beauty and boast of your beauty to provoke the crown prince, you will come close to the mantis’s folly. This is one analogy.

Do you not know those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, for fear of provoking their killing rage; they dare not feed them whole creatures, for fear of provoking their tearing rage. Cheng comments: "When throwing dead prey to a tiger, they first tear it apart to avoid requiring effort."

They time their hunger and satiety and understand their angry impulses. Tigers, though of a different species from humans, fawn upon those who feed them—this is compliance. Thus, those they kill are those who oppose them. If a tiger opposes, it kills; if it is fed, it fawns. This is a metaphor for how one must not provoke anger. This is another analogy.

Those who love horses gather their dung in baskets and collect their urine in conches—so says Cheng: "Conches are large clamshells." This is the utmost in loving horses. Yet when horseflies or gadflies alight upon them (Wang Niansun notes: "The character 仆 here means 'to attach.' The phrase describes flies clinging to the horse's body. The *Book of Songs* says, 'The illustrious mandate has its attachments,' and Mao's commentary explains: 'Attachments are what cling.'"), and one pats them at the wrong moment (Cheng explains: "拊 means to slap. 不时 means catching the horse unawares"), the horse may break its bit, shatter its bridle, or smash its chest. The horse is startled to this degree. When one’s intentions are carried to an extreme, love may turn to loss—how can one not be cautious? This is a third analogy.

A carpenter named Shi traveled to Qi and arrived at Qu Yuan, where he saw a sacred oak used as the village shrine. (Shi is the carpenter’s name. 之 means "to go." Sima explains: "Qu Yuan is a winding road." Cheng comments: "Like the road of Huanyuan." 社 refers to the earth deity; the oak is the sacred tree of the shrine.) The tree was so vast it could shade thousands of oxen, its girth measured in a hundred spans (the *Wen Xuan* commentary cites Sima: "絜 means 'to encircle.'"), and Li explains: "A span is the width of one hand; this tree was likely ten *zhang* in circumference." Its height towered above the mountain by ten *ren* before branches appeared, and its side limbs that could be made into boats numbered nearly ten. (Yu notes: "旁 and 方 were interchangeable in ancient times. 方 means 'nearly.' Thus, the limbs suitable for boats numbered nearly ten.") Spectators gathered like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter paid no heed and walked on without pause. (遂 means "to proceed." The *Wen Xuan* commentary cites Sima: "Shi was the carpenter’s courtesy name.") His disciple, sated with the sight, ran to catch up with the carpenter and said: "Since I first took up the axe to follow you, master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why do you refuse to look and walk on without stopping?"

The carpenter replied: "Enough! Say no more! It is a useless tree. If made into a boat, it would sink; its weight is too great. If made into a coffin or outer coffin, it would rot quickly; its grain is too coarse. If made into vessels, they would break at once; its wood is too brittle. If used for doors or gates, it would ooze resin (Li Zhen notes: "The *Guangyun* defines 樠 as 'the heartwood of pine' or the name of a tree. Pine heartwood contains sap, and 液樠 refers to this property."). If used for pillars, it would be eaten by worms. It is a worthless tree, good for nothing—this has been discussed in earlier chapters such as the *Free and Easy Wandering*. That is why it has lived so long."

When the carpenter returned home, the sacred oak appeared to him in a dream and said: "With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the so-called 'patterned wood'?" (Guo explains: "Patterned wood refers to all usable timber, which can be carved into designs.") "Consider the crabapple, pear, orange, pomelo, and other fruit-bearing trees (Cheng comments: "蓏 refers to melons and gourds."). When their fruit ripens, they are stripped and humiliated; their great branches are broken, and their small branches are dragged away (Yu notes: "泄 should be read as 曳. In the *Xunzi*'s *Fei Xiang* chapter, 'When meeting people, one uses dragging,' and Yang's commentary explains: 'Dragging means to pull.' 小枝泄 refers to branches being pulled."). This is because their usefulness brings suffering to their lives, so they do not complete their natural lifespan but die prematurely—struck down by the world’s conventions through their own actions (Cheng comments: "掊 means to strike."). All things are like this. As for me, I have sought to be of no use for a long time; I nearly died, nearly felled to my death. Only now have I attained this state (Guo explains: "Many have looked at me with disdain, but only now has the carpenter understood me."), which is of great use to me. If I had been useful, would I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how could you judge me as a thing? You, a nearly dead, worthless man, what could you know of a worthless tree?" (而 here means "you." 几 means "nearly.")

The carpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. Wang Niansun notes: "‘Diagnosed’ (*zhěn*) should be read as *zhěn* (告, ‘to inform’)." He informed his disciples of the dream. A disciple asked: "If you hasten to seek uselessness, then why serve as a shrine tree?" Since you urgently pursue uselessness to preserve your life, why must you become a shrine tree to adorn yourself?

He replied: "Hush!" (This means "keep it secret." Yao Nai notes: "密 and 默 are interchangeable. In the *Tian Zifang* chapter, Confucius says: ‘Silence! Say no more!’ In the *Dasheng* chapter, it reads: ‘The Duke kept it secret and did not respond.’") Say no more! That tree merely lodges there, enduring the scorn and reproach of those who do not understand it. It merely dwells by the shrine, bearing the slander of those who fail to know it without complaint. Sima Biao comments: "厉 means ‘affliction.’"

If it were not a shrine tree, it would nearly have been felled! If it were not a shrine tree, it would almost have been cut down—perhaps split into firewood. Moreover, what it preserves differs from the multitude. It is safeguarded in the mountains and wilds, ultimately distinct from the common crowd, not to be likened to a city fox or shrine rat. To praise it by conventional standards—is this not far off the mark? Xuan comments: "义 means ‘common principle.’" The point is: that tree does not rely on the shrine spirit for self-glorification, so to commend it by conventional reasoning is far from its true nature.

Nanbo Ziqi wandered in Shangqiu. Li notes: "This is Nan Guo. *Bo* means ‘elder.’" Sima Biao comments: "Shangqiu is present-day Suiyang County in Liang Province." There he saw an extraordinary tree so vast that a thousand chariots could gather beneath it, sheltering in its luxuriant shade. Xiang comments: "藾 means ‘shade.’"

Cui comments: "隐 means ‘afflicted by heat.’" Cheng explains: "A team of four horses is called a *cheng*. This says that a thousand chariots could gather, finding shelter from the heat in its shade." Ziqi said: "What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!"—meaning it must surely be fit for use as lumber.

Yet when he looked up at its slender branches, they were gnarled and crooked, unfit for ridgepoles or beams. When he looked down at its massive roots, they were split at the core, useless for coffins or outer caskets. Cheng notes: "轴 resembles the turning of a wheel’s axle—here referring to the heartwood. *解* means the grain is loose and scattered, not tightly bound." Chewing its leaves burned the mouth and caused injury; inhaling its scent induced a raving drunkenness that lasted three days without cease. Li explains: "狂酲 means ‘madness like intoxication.’ *酲* refers to the sickness of wine."

Ziqi said: "This tree is truly a worthless wood, and yet it has grown to such immense size!" Cheng comments: "Being worthless is the great timber of perfect life; having no use is the wondrous utility that aids all things. Thus it escapes the axe’s early doom and shelters a thousand chariots in its shade." Alas! The spirit-like person takes this as worthlessness!

The insight moves from wood to man. Xuan comments: "The spirit-like person likewise, by not displaying his talents, remains useless to the world, and thus Heaven alone preserves him whole."

In Song there was a region called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry flourished. Of these trees, those with trunks the size of a man’s embrace or smaller were felled by those seeking pegs for monkeys; Sima explains: "A trunk held by two hands is called *gong*; by one hand, *ba*." Xuan notes: "*Yi* are tethering stakes." Those three or four spans in girth were cut down by those seeking fine timber for grand beams; Cui states: "Eight feet make one span." Guo Qingfan observes: "Here *ming* means ‘large’" (see *Under Heaven*, under "three hundred famous mountains"). Cheng comments: "*Li* refers to roof beams." Those seven or eight spans in girth were hewn by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking single-plank coffin sides. *Shiwen* notes: "*Shan* is also written as *tan*." Cheng explains: "A coffin side made from a single unjoined plank is called *shanpang*. Such trees are enormous, requiring the cutting of vast boards." Thus, before completing their natural lifespan, they were prematurely felled by axes—this is the calamity of usefulness.

Therefore, when exorcists perform purifications, they reject oxen with white foreheads, pigs with upturned snouts, and men with hemorrhoids, deeming them unfit for sacrifice in the sacred river. Guo explains: "*Jie* refers to the exorcism rites of shamans." Cheng comments: "*Sang* is the forehead. *Kang* means ‘raised.’ These three cannot be taken to the numinous river for sacrifice." In ancient times, men were drowned in the river as offerings—when Ximen Bao served as magistrate of Ye, he put an end to this practice, which was of this kind. The shamans knew this well. *Yi* and *yi* are interchangeable. Guo notes: "Even the shamans understood that the useless remain whole." What is deemed inauspicious is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as the greatest auspice. Xuan comments: "To preserve one’s life whole—what greater blessing could there be?" (In one edition, the character *er* appears above *yi*.)

There was a man named Zhili Shu, whose body was deformed. Sima describes: "Zhili depicts a form that is incomplete. *Shu* is his name." His chin rested on his navel, his shoulders rose above his head; Sima explains: "This describes a hunched back and a sunken head." *Huainanzi* states: "His spinal column towered above his head." His topknot pointed to the sky; Sima comments: "The *huicu* is a topknot. In ancient times, topknots were worn at the nape, but with a hunched back and lowered head, the topknot would point upward." Cui says: "*Huicu* refers to the cervical vertebrae." Li Zhen argues: "Cui’s interpretation is correct. In the *Great and Venerable Master* chapter, it says: ‘*Gouzui* points to the sky.’ Li explains: ‘*Gouzui* are the cervical vertebrae, resembling a growth.’ This aligns with Cui’s view. The *Suwen*’s *Cire* chapter states: ‘The third vertebra of the neck, where it is sunken, is the center.’ Wang’s commentary: ‘This outlines the general method for counting vertebrae.’ Shen Tong’s *Explanation of Bones* says: ‘The twenty-one vertebrae below the great cervical vertebra are collectively called the spine, and the bones are called vertebrae.’ The *Nanjing*’s forty-fifth difficulty states: ‘The bones gather at *dazhu*.’ Zhang’s commentary: ‘*Dazhu* is an acupoint located at the first vertebra behind the neck. From here, all bones branch downward like a framework, hence the bones gather at *dazhu*.’ *Huicu* derives its meaning from the gathering of bones and is situated among the cervical vertebrae, hence it is called the ‘cervical vertebra.’ *Chu Xue Ji* 19 cites *cuo* as written as *cuo*. The *Yupian* states: ‘*Cuo* is a knot in wood,’ which resembles a spinal node. The character written with the wood radical is more appropriate in meaning." The five *guan* were on his upper back; Li explains: "*Guan* are the *shu* points. The *shu* points of the five viscera are all located on a person’s back." Li Zhen comments: "The chin and shoulders describe external features; the *huicu* and five *guan* describe internal ones." His thighs aligned with his ribs. Sima explains: "With a hunched spine and raised belly, his thighs pressed against his ribs." He mended clothes and washed laundry, enough to feed himself; Sima notes: "*Cuo zhen* means sewing. *Xie* means washing clothes." He sifted grain and winnowed chaff, enough to feed ten people. Sima comments: "*Gu* means winnowing. A small winnowing basket is called *ce*. *Bo jing* means sifting rice." Cheng explains: "*Bo* means winnowing dust." When the authorities conscripted soldiers, Zhili rolled up his sleeves and wandered among them; Guo observes: "Relying on his uselessness, he did not hide himself." When the state undertook great labor projects, Zhili, citing his chronic illness, was exempt from service; Xuan notes: "He could not perform labor." When the authorities distributed grain to the sick, he received three *zhong* and ten bundles of firewood. Sima explains: "Six *hu* and four *dou* make one *zhong*." Thus, one whose form was deformed could still nourish his body and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is deformed!

Confucius traveled to Chu, where the madman Jieyu wandered near his gate, singing: "O phoenix! O phoenix! How your virtue has declined! The future cannot be awaited, the past cannot be retrieved. Guo explains: "One must act according to the present moment." When the world possesses the Dao, the sage accomplishes his work; Xuan comments: "He fulfills his purpose." Su Yu notes: "Zhuangzi alters the phrasing to show that the times are not favorable. If one lives in an age with the Dao, one would gladly serve the world, not merely preserve one’s life." When the world lacks the Dao, the sage preserves his life. Xuan comments: "He keeps himself whole." In the present age, one barely escapes punishment. Blessings are lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear them—how easily taken, yet not taken! Disasters are heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid them."

"To fail to avoid what should be avoided!

Enough! Enough! To confront others with virtue!
Xuan comments: "What must urgently cease is the matter of displaying virtue to others."

Dangerous! Dangerous! To pace within lines drawn on the ground!
Xuan comments: "Most perilous are those who rigidly constrain themselves with suffering."

*Miyang, miyang*—this refers to thorns, which grow in mountain wilds and wound the feet if trodden upon. Even now, in our state of Chu, cart-drivers encountering them still cry, *'Miyang ti!'* The sound *mi* is read like *ma*.

Let nothing harm my path!
My path winds and bends,
Xuan comments: "Retreating in hesitation, not daring to take the straight way."

Let nothing harm my feet!"

The mountain trees bring ruin upon themselves; the fat of the lamp consumes itself.
Sima comments: "The tree becomes an axe-handle and thus cuts itself down; the fat ignites the flame and thus melts itself away."

Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is slashed.
Cheng comments: "The heart of the cinnamon is pungent and fragrant, so it suffers the axe; lacquer serves vessel-making, so it is cut. Both are destroyed by their own abilities for being useful."

All people know the use of the useful, yet none know the use of the useless.

This analogy clarifies the conclusion, though it does not directly follow Jie Yu’s song above—the song has rhyme, while this does not."

*Zhuangzi Jijie*, Scroll Two
*Inner Chapters: "Virtue’s Full Manifestation," Fifth*

Within, virtue is fully replete, and of itself bears outward signs of verification. In Lu there was a foot-amputee named Wang Tai—Li [Yi] notes: "Amputated feet are called *wu*." Those who followed him in study were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Guo [Xiang] comments: "His disciples rivaled Confucius in number." Chang Ji asked Confucius, saying: "Wang Tai is a foot-amputee, yet those who follow him in study divide Lu equally with you." *Shiwen* notes: "Chang Ji—some say a disciple of Confucius; others, a worthy of Lu." "He stands without teaching, sits without discourse; yet those who go to him empty return full. His disciples all gain something. Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form?" Xuan [Ying] comments: "Silent transformation." "What manner of man is he?"

Confucius said: "This Master is a sage. I, Qiu, have merely lagged behind and not yet gone to him. I intend to take him as my teacher—how much more those who are not my equal! Why only Lu! I would lead all under Heaven to follow him."

Chang Ji said: "He is a foot-amputee, yet he surpasses you, Master—his distinction from the common is indeed great. If this is so, how does he employ his mind?" Confucius said: "Life and death are great indeed, yet he does not change with them. His person moves with change, yet life and death do not alter him. Though heaven and earth collapse, he will not lose himself with them." Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "Lose: to be lost." "He does not follow them into ruin. He examines the flawless and does not shift with things." Guo Qingfan notes: "*Jia* is a scribal error for *xia*. The *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun* reads *shen hu wu xia*—'he examines his own flawlessness.' Thus he lets things shift of themselves without being enslaved by them. In the *Zuozhuan*, 'Fu Xia' appears in the *Zheng Shijia* as 'Fu Jia'; in the *Liji*’s *Tan Gong*, 'Gongjian Jia' appears in the *Hanshu*’s *Renbiao* as 'Gongjian Xia.' *Xia* and *jia* are graphically similar and easily confused." "He commands the transformations of things while guarding their root."

Xuan [Ying] comments: "He governs the transformations of things, holding fast to their pivot."

Chang Ji said: "What does this mean?" Confucius said: "Viewed from what makes them different, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue—though part of one body, the world sees them as distinct. Viewed from what makes them the same, the myriad things are all one—all are a single thing between heaven and earth. If this is so, then he does not know what suits the ears and eyes—what the ears and eyes deem fitting for sound and form—yet his mind roams in the harmony of virtue." Guo [Xiang] comments: "He releases his mind amid the Dao and virtue, and all is vast and without obstruction." "He sees things in their unity and does not perceive their loss." Xuan [Ying] comments: "He sees the myriad things as one, without gain or loss." "He regards the loss of his foot as the shedding of dust."

Chang Ji said: "He cultivates himself—this is all Wang Tai can do. With his knowledge, he attains his heart; with his true knowing, he recovers the principle of his mind. With his heart, he attains the constant heart—again, with the principle of his mind, he awakens to the heart-principle constant through past and present. Why then do people flock to him?" *Zui*: to gather.

Confucius said: "People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water—only stillness can still the many who seek stillness." Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "Mirror: to reflect." Xuan [Ying] comments: "Water does not seek to mirror, yet people come to mirror themselves in it. Only by being still can it still those who seek stillness." "Receiving its mandate from earth, only the pine and cypress remain—standing alone, green in winter and summer. Receiving its mandate from heaven, only Shun stands upright." Guo [Xiang] comments: "Below, only the pine and cypress stand alone; above, only the sage stands alone. Thus all who are not upright come seeking uprightness. If all things were evergreen, the pine and cypress would not be prized; if all people were self-upright, none would admire the great sage and flock to him." Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "The human head is above; remove it, and one dies. The tree’s root is below; remove it, and it dies. Thus we call humans 'upper heads' and trees 'lower heads.' The upper head eats the side heads, the side heads eat the lower heads. The lower heads are grasses and trees; the side heads, insects and beasts." "Fortunate is he who can upright his life, thereby uprighting the lives of others." Xuan [Ying] comments: "Shun could upright his own nature, and the natures of things all received uprightness of themselves."

As for the proof of preserving one’s original state—what is its evidence? The reality of fearlessness. A single brave warrior, boldly entering the nine armies—Cui [Zhuan] comments: "The Son of Heaven has six armies; the feudal lords, three—together, nine armies." He seeks fame and can compel himself—yet even he is like this. How much more one who governs heaven and earth, treasuries the myriad things—Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "He holds the warp of the two powers and embraces the cosmos"—who regards the six limbs as mere lodging—Xuan [Ying] comments: "*Zhi*: merely. He treats the six limbs as his temporary abode." Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "The six limbs: head, torso, and four limbs." "Takes the ears and eyes as mere semblances, and knows with the knowing of unity—*zhi* above refers to wisdom; *zhi* below, to its object. Pure and without duality. Has his heart never died?" Xuan [Ying] comments: "He attains the constant heart, unchanged by life and death." "He will choose a day to ascend in transcendence." *Jia*: Xu [Shen] reads as *xia*. Xuan [Ying] comments: "The *Liji* says: 'The Son of Heaven ascends in transcendence.' Here, it signifies departing the world and standing alone."

"Choosing a day" means selecting a specific day. *Note*: This refers to the Yellow Emperor’s journey to the Great Purity. Yet men cannot but follow such a path. Xuan [Ying] comments: "Men cannot abandon it of their own accord." How then would he deign to make worldly affairs his concern?

This answers Chang Ji’s suspicion that Dai might harbor ambitions to sway the masses.

Shentu Jia, an amputee, studied under Bohun Wuren alongside Zichan of Zheng. (In the "Miscellaneous Chapters," it is written as "Maoren.") Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind." Guo [Xiang] comments: "He was ashamed to walk alongside an amputee." The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia: "If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind. Now that I am about to leave, can you not stay behind? Or is it that you cannot?" Guo [Xiang] comments: "He asked bluntly, hoping Shentu Jia would not walk alongside him." "Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not yield—do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?" *Zhizheng*: Zichan refers to himself. *Wei*: to avoid. *Ye qi*: to be equal. He rebuked Shentu Jia for his lack of deference.

Shentu Jia replied: "In the Master’s gate, are there truly those who take pride in their power as you do? The gate of Master Bohun values virtue and power—how could it harbor those who boast of their authority as you do? You delight in your own power and thus place yourself above others! I have heard it said: ‘When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, the mirror is no longer bright.’ To dwell long with the worthy is to be without fault." *Zhi*: to settle. A clear mirror gathers no dust; to be near the virtuous is to be without fault. "Now, the greater one you seek is the Master, yet you still speak in this way—is this not a fault?" Xuan [Ying] comments: "*Qu da*: to seek broad understanding." *Note*: *Qu da* means to hold in high regard.

Zichan said: "Since you are as you are—already maimed in form—do you still vie with Yao in goodness?" Xuan [Ying] comments: "Yao represents the pinnacle of goodness, hence the comparison." "Do you not reflect that your virtue is insufficient?" Xuan [Ying] comments: "Considering your past conduct, you must have committed faults that led to your amputation—do you not reflect on this?"

Shentu Jia said: "Those who openly acknowledge their faults yet do not deserve to lose their limbs are many; those who do not acknowledge their faults yet do not deserve to keep their limbs are few. *Zhuang*: to make manifest. Many openly declare their transgressions yet do not deserve to lose their feet; few do not declare their transgressions yet still lose their feet. To know there is nothing to be done and accept it as fate—only those of virtue can do this." Xuan [Ying] comments: "To regard amputation as the natural course of fate and not be troubled by it—only those of virtue can do this." "Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow, the center is the mark, yet whether one hits it or not is a matter of fate. The first two *zhong* are read as written; the latter two are pronounced *zhòng*. The drawn bow of Yi is a metaphor for the net of punishment. To dwell within the net of punishment, who can be certain they are without fault? That one is not struck by punishment is merely a matter of chance. Many with whole limbs mock me for my incomplete limbs. I was enraged, but when I came to the Master’s place, my anger dissipated and I returned to myself." Guo [Xiang] comments: "He abandoned his former anger and returned to his usual state." "Was it not the Master who cleansed me with goodness? He purified my heart’s burdens with the Way of virtue. I have accompanied you, Master, for nineteen years, yet you have never once regarded me as an amputee. I have never heard the Master reject me for my maimed form. Now you and I wander within the realm of form and bone, befriending one another through virtue and power. Yet you seek me out beyond the realm of form and bone, measuring me by outward traces. Is this not a fault?"

Zichan, startled, changed his expression and said: "Do not speak thus!" He rose in apology. *Nai zhe*: meaning "like this." *Zi wu nai cheng*: "Do not speak in this way." In the "Great Master" chapter, "not knowing why it is thus" also means "not knowing why it is like this."

In Lu, there was an amputee named Shushan Wuzhi. Li [Yi] comments: "Shushan is his clan name." Xuan [Ying] comments: "Without toes, he took it as his name." He came to see Confucius on his heels. Cui [Wei] comments: "Without toes, he walked on his heels." Confucius said: "You were not careful, and already you have suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?" Wuzhi said: "I was ignorant of my duties and recklessly used my body, which is why I lost my feet. Now that I have come, what remains is something more honorable than feet." Xuan [Ying] comments: "What is more honorable than feet does not reside in the body." "I strive to preserve it whole. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would be like this?"

Confucius said: "I am indeed narrow-minded. Why do you not come in? Please share what you have heard!" Wuzhi departed. Xuan [Ying] comments: "He left directly." Confucius said: "Disciples, take heed! This Wuzhi, an amputee, still strives to learn to make amends for his past misdeeds—how much more should those of whole virtue do so!" Past misdeeds harm one’s virtue; one seeks learning to repair them—how much more should those without misdeeds and of whole virtue do so!

Wuzhi said to Lao Dan: "Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he so frequently take you as his teacher?" Yu [Yue] comments: "*Binbin*: meaning repeatedly. The characters for *bin* and *pin* were interchangeable in ancient times. The *Guangya* explains: '*Pinpin*: in succession.'"

Guo [Xiang] comments: "He found it strange that Confucius was once again studying under Lao Dan." That man sought to make his name known through bizarre, illusory, and monstrous means—did he not know that the perfected person regards these as his own shackles? Li [Yi] comments: "*Zhuogui*: meaning strange and extraordinary." Note: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*'s "Mourning Music" chapter writes it as "*chugui*." Wood on the foot is called a *zhi*; on the hand, a *gu*. *Qi* and *qi* are interchangeable. This says he sought to make himself known to the world as an extraordinary man, yet did not realize that the perfected person views fame as his own shackles.

Lao Dan said: "Why not simply let him see death and life as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuous strand, and thus release his shackles—would that be possible?" This means that life and death, right and wrong, can be united as one—why not let him see death and life, right and wrong, as a single thread, thereby resolving his delusions? Might that be possible?

Wuzhi said: "Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone?" This means his innate capacity is such that he is naturally condemned by Heaven, and it cannot be undone.

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: "In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo." *Shiwen* commentary: "*E*: meaning ugly. Li [Yi] comments: '*Aitai*: an ugly appearance. *Tuo* is his given name.'" "When men dwell with him, they grow so attached that they cannot bear to leave."

Women who saw him would beg their parents, saying, "I would rather be this man’s concubine than another’s wife," and this happened more than ten times without cease. He never initiated speech, only responding in harmony. He never took the lead—only after sensing another’s intent did he reply. Without the rank of a ruler, he saved others from mortal peril. Without amassing wealth, he filled others’ bellies. Though his ugliness startled the world, he did not move people with beauty. Harmonious yet never leading, he never drew others to himself. His knowledge did not extend beyond his immediate domain, nor did his fame reach far beyond his borders. Yet men and women alike gathered before him. This must be because he possessed something beyond ordinary men.

I summoned him to observe him, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. After less than a month in my company, I began to sense the depth of his character. Before a year had passed, I trusted him completely. When the state had no minister, I offered him the governance of the realm. He responded only after long hesitation, as if reluctant, and his words seemed to drift away, untethered to any intent. I felt ashamed, yet in the end, I entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left me and departed. I grieved as if I had lost something, as if no one remained to share the joy of ruling this land. What manner of man is he?"

Confucius said: "I once traveled to Chu and saw young pigs nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they glanced around in alarm and all abandoned her to flee. They were startled because she no longer saw them, no longer bore the likeness of the living. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but what animated her form. When warriors die in battle, their burials do not include the ceremonial *sha* ornaments, for these are the trappings of martial prowess, and the dead possess no such prowess. When a man’s feet are severed, his shoes are not cherished, for they are made for feet, and he has none. In neither case does the root remain.

The palace women who serve the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears; those who take wives remain outside the household, not subject to further service. Preserving the body’s wholeness is sufficient to inspire such care—how much more so for one whose virtue is complete! Now, Aitai Tuo gains trust without speaking, draws affection without merit, and is offered a kingdom with such urgency that one fears he might refuse. This must be because his talents are whole and his virtue unmanifest."

Duke Ai said: "What do you mean by *talents being whole*?"

Confucius said: "Life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the movements of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot trace their beginnings. Thus, they are not enough to disturb one’s harmony or enter the mind’s sanctuary. One should allow them to flow smoothly without losing joy, ensuring that day and night, without interruption, one’s presence brings the vitality of spring to all things."

"Xi (郄) means interval." Xuan comments: "Let the qi of harmony and ease flow unimpeded, never losing one’s joyful nature, so that day and night, without a moment’s interruption, one moves with all things in the springtime of harmony." This is to continuously generate seasons within the heart. Xuan comments: "Here, the four seasons do not reside in heaven and earth, but the spring within one’s heart knows no interruption—thus seasons arise in unbroken succession within the heart." This is called *talents being whole*.

"What do you mean by *virtue being unmanifest*?"
Confucius said: "Levelness is the fullness of still water. Guo comments: 'Nothing in the world is as level as still water.' It may serve as a standard, for Guo comments: 'Utterly without bias, it becomes the world’s measure of correctness.' One inwardly preserves it while outwardly remaining undisturbed. *Disturbed* means moved. One inwardly preserves clarity without being moved by external things. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. Xuan comments: 'When the cultivation of the Great Harmony is complete, it is called virtue.' *Virtue being unmanifest* means that things cannot depart from it."

One whose inner power is profound is delightful for others to draw near. Another day, Duke Ai told Min Zi what he had heard: "At first, I believed that facing south to rule the world, holding the people’s guiding principles, and fearing their deaths—Cheng comments: 'Holding fast to the guiding cords, anxious for the multitudes, providing food and instruction, dreading their early demise'—was the height of understanding. Now, having heard the words of the perfected person," Xuan comments: "the words of Confucius about Aitai Tuo,"

"For I fear I lack its reality and, by lightly using my person, may lose my state. Between Confucius and myself, there is no ruler-minister relation—only a bond of virtue as friends."

Yin Qi, Zhi Li, and Wu Chun—Cheng comments: "Yin means crooked; he walks with twisted limbs and raised heels. Chun means lips; his body is cracked and broken, hunchbacked and maimed, and he also lacks lips." *Shiwen* notes: "Chun: Xu reads *shi zhěn*; also pronounced *chún*."

He spoke to Duke Ling of Wei, who took such delight in him that when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed pitifully frail. *Shuo* (upper) reads *shuì* for "delight"; *yue* (lower) is pronounced *yuè*. The same applies below. *Shiwen* notes: "Dòu means neck. Li comments: 'Shoulder-shoulder describes a meager, slight appearance.'" Li Zhen comments: "In the *Kaogong Ji* of the *Rites of Zhou*, the phrase 'counting eyes and *kuān* necks' is glossed: '*Kuān* means a long neck.' This matches the sense of *shoulder-shoulder*, showing that *shoulder* is a loan character and the original graph should be *kuān*."

When Weng Àng with his great goiter spoke to Duke Huan of Qi, the duke took such delight in him that when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed pitifully frail. *Shuowen* notes: "Àng means tumor." Li comments: "Weng Àng describes a large goiter."

Thus, where virtue excels, form is forgotten—a summation of the above.

One who fails to forget what ought to be forgotten, yet forgets what ought not to be forgotten—this is called true forgetting. Form should be forgotten, virtue should not be forgotten; to do the opposite is genuine oblivion. Thus the sage wanders where he will, letting his mind roam in emptiness. Yet knowledge becomes a snare: the movement of wisdom and cunning spawns offshoots and entanglements. Constraint becomes glue: rites and trust bind and fasten. Virtue becomes a bond: the broad cultivation of virtuous intent creates mutual attachment. Craft becomes commerce: skillful transformation and accumulation facilitate trade.

The sage does not scheme—what use is knowledge? With no plans in mind, why employ wit? He does not carve—what use is glue? Unhewn substance needs no constraint. He suffers no loss—what use is virtue? Virtue means attainment; with nothing lost, why summon others through virtue? He does not traffic—what use is commerce? Valuing no goods, he has no need for trade. These four are the Heavenly Provisions. The Heavenly Provisions are Heaven’s sustenance. *Shiwen* notes: “Provisions means nourishment.” Knowledge, constraint, virtue, and craft—these are how Heaven nourishes man. Heaven’s nourishment is how Heaven feeds him. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why employ man? Having received Heaven’s sustenance, one should preserve one’s natural state, not adulterate it with human artifice.

He has the form of a man, but not the passions of a man—banishing all emotion. Having the form of a man, he mingles with men; *Cheng* comments: “Blending light and merging traces.” Lacking the passions of a man, right and wrong find no hold in him—cutting off the roots of right and wrong. How tiny and slight! This is how he belongs to man. How towering and vast! This is how he completes his Heaven. *Cui* comments: “Resembling men makes him small; aligning with Heaven makes him great.” *Cheng* comments: “Towering, a description of great height.”

Huizi said to Zhuangzi: “Do men truly have no passions?”
Zhuangzi said: “Yes.”
Huizi said: “If a man has no passions, how can he be called a man?”
Zhuangzi said: “The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form. *Cheng* comments: ‘The Dao of emptiness and penetration shapes his countenance; the principle of spontaneity endows his form.’ How can he not be called a man?”
Huizi said: “If he is called a man, how can he have no passions?”
Zhuangzi said: “This is not what I mean by passions. *Xuan* comments: ‘Huizi first misconstrues the word *passions*.’ *Case*: Guo takes *this* to refer to right and wrong, which is incorrect. What I mean by having no passions is that a man does not allow likes and dislikes to inwardly harm his person, but constantly follows nature without embellishing life.” *Xuan* comments: “He adheres to the principle of life without adding human artifice.”
Huizi said: “If one does not embellish life, how can one have a body?” *Cheng* comments: “If one does not rely on the way of embellishing life, how can one have a body?”
Zhuangzi said: “The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—he does not allow likes and dislikes to inwardly harm his person. This is how he has a body. Now you estrange your spirit, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree to chant, and rest on a withered catalpa to doze. *Cheng* comments: ‘Withered catalpa’ refers to a knee-high desk. Huizi estranges his spirit and wearies his essence, so when he walks he leans against a tree to chant, and when he sits he rests on a desk to discourse, his body weary and his mind spent, fatigued and dozing.” Heaven chose your form—*chose* is to be understood as in Mencius’ “Heaven chose and sent you.” Yet you clamor about “hard and white”! How is this different from Gongsun Long’s “hard and white” argument? It is what the *Qi Wu Lun* calls “ending in the obscurity of hard and white.” For the explanation, see above. *Inner Chapters, “The Great and Venerable Teacher,” Chapter Six.*

The present passage states: “People still imitate him.” *Imitate* means to take as teacher. It also says: “My teacher! My teacher!”—taking the Dao as teacher. *Zong* means “master.” To know what Heaven does and to know what man does is to reach the ultimate. To know what Heaven does is to know that it gives life: all things arise spontaneously, so one should accord with their spontaneity. To know what man does is to use what his knowledge knows to nourish what his knowledge does not know, so that he completes his Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge. *Liang qi zhi* is read as *zhi* (knowledge). If one does not force knowledge, then knowledge is properly nourished. Guo comments: “What man does has its limits, so one should follow without forcing; what man knows has its bounds, so one should use without excess. Thus, what one knows does not become self-entangling through boundlessness.” Even so, there is trouble. Cheng comments: “Though knowledge is full and fine, it still brings trouble and encumbrance—it is not as good as forgetting knowledge and following the solitary.” For knowledge must await something before it is fitting, and what it awaits is especially uncertain. Cheng comments: “Knowledge must face an object; without an object, it is not fitting. Since objects arise and vanish unpredictably, knowledge too is contingent and inconstant. Only when both object and knowledge are forgotten can trouble be avoided.” How do we know that what I call Heaven is not man? That what I call man is not Heaven? Cheng comments: “Knowledge can be applied, but all is natural. Thus, Heaven and man are one in principle, so that to call Heaven is to call man, and to call man is to call Heaven. *What I call* refers to Zhuangzi’s self-reference. Here, Heaven and man are merged, self and things made one.” Only when there is a true person is there true knowledge. Guo comments: “Only when there is a true person do all the knowledges under Heaven attain their truth and cannot be confounded.” What is a true person? The true persons of old did not oppose the few—with empty mind, they accepted things, and though few, they did not resist. They did not boast of success, did not take achievement as a cause for pride. They did not scheme for scholars. Cheng comments: “With emptiness and equanimity, scholars naturally gather—no scheming is needed to attract them.” Such persons, when they err, do not regret; when they are right, do not feel self-satisfied. Cheng comments: “When the time has passed, they have no regret or remorse; when their allotted fate happens to be fitting, they do not take it as a personal virtue.” Such persons ascend heights without trembling, enter water without getting wet, enter fire without feeling heat. Their knowledge’s ability to ascend and lodge in the Dao is like this. They do not take peril, difficulty, life, or death to heart. Their ability to ascend to the Dao is not what the world’s knowledge can comprehend. The true persons of old slept without dreaming. Cheng comments: “They cut off thought, so their sleep was still and empty.” When awake, they had no cares. Guo comments: “They were at ease wherever they dwelled.” They did not relish their food. Cheng comments: “They did not indulge in flavors.” Their breathing was deep. Li comments: “The appearance of inner breathing.” The true person’s breathing reaches the heels. Cheng comments: “*Heels* means the soles of the feet.” Xuan comments: “Breath circulates to the *yongquan* point.” The breathing of ordinary people reaches only the throat. Xuan comments: “It stops at the juncture of the epiglottis.” Those who are overborne in debate have their throats choked as if retching. *Overborne* means being bested in argument. *Throat* refers to the larynx. *Choked* is before the voice comes out; *words* are after the voice comes out. In the moment of swallowing and emitting, it is as if retching—this describes those without cultivation. The deeper their desires, the shallower their Heavenly mechanism. With deep passions and desires, their spirit-mechanism is dull and sluggish. The true persons of old did not delight in life, did not hate death. Guo comments: “They took transformation as their body.” They did not rejoice at going out, did not resist coming in. *Shiwen* notes: “*Resist* is also written as *reject*. Li comments: ‘Rejoicing at going out means scheming for life; resisting coming in means hating death.’” They went *xiaoran*, they came *xiaoran*—that is all. Cheng comments: “*Xiaoran* means unentangled.” They did not forget their beginning, did not seek their end. Xuan comments: “They knew the source of life and entrusted the return of death.” They received and rejoiced in it. Xuan comments: “After receiving life, they were always content.” They forgot and returned to it. Xuan comments: “They forgot death and returned to Heaven.” This is called not using the mind to cast aside the Dao, not using man to assist Heaven. This is called the true person. Guo comments: “The things that move people are endless; the desires that people pursue are boundless—then the Heavenly principle is extinguished. The true person knows that using the mind goes against the Dao, and assisting Heaven harms life, so he does not do so.” Yu comments: “According to Guo’s commentary, *cast aside* is likely a mistake for *go against*.” Such persons’ minds were forgetful. Xuan comments: “*Minds* should be *forgetfulness*. No thought.” Their countenance was still. Xuan comments: “No action.” Their foreheads were broad. Xuan comments: “*Foreheads* means the brow.” *Broad* describes great simplicity. Xuan comments: “Read *hui* with the rising tone.” They were bleak like autumn, warm like spring. Guo comments: “Killing things is not for might; giving life is not for benevolence.” Their joy and anger corresponded to the four seasons. Xuan comments: “Joy and anger were without intention, like the movements of the four seasons.” They were fitting with things, yet none knew their limit. They were fitting with circumstances, yet none could fathom their bounds.

Thus, when the sage employs military force, he overthrows states yet does not lose the people’s hearts. Cui comments: “Overthrowing enemy states while winning their people’s hearts.” His beneficence and favor extend to the myriad things, yet not out of love for others. He acts through benevolence and righteousness, yet does not practice benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, one who delights in connecting with things is no sage; one who does not seek to connect with things, yet finds the nature of things naturally aligned, is a sage. Having partiality is not benevolence; perfect benevolence has no private attachments. Following the seasons is not wisdom; Xuan comments: “Choosing the time to act reveals a mind calculating success and failure.” One who does not comprehend the interconnection of benefit and harm is no gentleman; failing to observe their interconnection leads to pursuit and avoidance. Acting for fame at the cost of oneself is no scholar; Cheng comments: “One who seeks fame through action yet loses their true nature is no man of the Dao.” Sacrificing oneself without authenticity is not mastery over others; Xuan comments: “Merely casting aside one’s life without aligning with true nature is to be used by the world, not to use others.” Such were Hu Bujie—Cheng comments: “Surnamed Hu, styled Bujie, a worthy of Yao’s time who refused Yao’s abdication and drowned himself in the river”—Wu Guang—Cheng comments: “A man of the Xia era who cultivated life through herbs, loved playing the zither, and when Tang offered him the throne, refused and drowned himself with a stone in the Lu River”—Boyi and Shuqi, Jizi Xuyu—Sima comments: “Xuyu was Jizi’s name. The *Shizi* states: ‘Jizi Xuyu painted his body to feign leprosy and let his hair loose to feign madness’”—Ji Ta—Cheng comments: “A recluse of Tang’s time who, hearing Tang’s offer to Wu Guang, feared it might extend to himself, led his disciples into the Kuǎn River and drowned”—and Shentu Di—*Shiwen* notes: “A man of the Yin era who drowned himself in the river with a stone.” These were men used by others, following others’ paths, yet never attaining their own true way. Guo comments: “All abandoned themselves to imitate others, harming themselves for others’ sake.” Xuan comments: “Being used by others, pleasing others—what benefit is there to one’s true nature?”

The true person of old had an appearance lofty yet not crumbling. Guo comments: “Accordant with things yet not forming cliques.” Yu comments: “Guo’s note is incorrect. This describes their appearance, not their virtue. *Yi* should be read as *e* (峨). In the *Dao of Heaven* chapter, ‘their appearance *yiran* (义然)’ means *eran* (峨然, towering). *Peng* should be read as *beng* (崩). The *Yijing* says ‘*peng* comes without blame,’ and the *Han Shu Wuxing Zhi* quotes it as ‘*beng* comes without blame.’ *Yi er bu peng* means their appearance was towering and grand yet not crumbling.” They seemed insufficient yet did not submit. Xuan comments: “Humble in self-cultivation yet not subservient to others.” They were solitary yet not rigid. Wang comments: “*Gu* means standing alone, unaligned with the crowd.” Cui comments: “*Gu* means angular.” Li Zhen comments: “*Gu* is a loan for *gu* (孤). The *Er Ya*’s ‘*gu* bamboo’ has a *Shiwen* note: ‘Originally written as *gu* (孤).’ This confirms the interchangeability of *gu* and *gu*. The solitary and independent have edges and corners, hence the character is also borrowed as *gu*. ‘*Yu hu qi gu*’ parallels ‘*zhang hu qi xu*,’ where *yu* should be a loan for *●*. The *Shuowen* states: ‘*●* means walking calmly.’” Note: *Bu jian* means not obstinate. They were expansive in their emptiness yet not ostentatious. Cheng comments: “*Zhang* means vast.” Note: Vast and clear in their emptiness, yet not superficial. They were radiant as if joyful! Xiang comments: “*Bingbing* is the appearance of joy.” Guo comments: “The perfected person has no joy, yet is harmoniously at ease, thus seeming joyful.” They moved as if compelled! Xiang comments: “*Cui* is the appearance of motion.” Cheng comments: “Moved only by necessity, never initiating, thus acting only when unavoidable.” They gathered and enhanced my countenance. Jianwen comments: “*Chu* means to gather.” Xuan comments: “Like water gathering to form a lustrous sheen, their harmonious and gracious demeanor made them approachable.” They drew me in with their virtue. *Yu* conveys the sense of connection. Xuan comments: “Their tranquil and magnanimous virtue made me wish to dwell with them.” They were vast as if embracing the world! Cui’s edition has *guang* (广) for *li* (厉), which should be followed. Yu comments: “*Shi* is a loan for *tai* (泰). *Guang* and *tai* correspond in meaning.” Guo Qingfan comments: “*Li* and *guang* were anciently interchangeable. *Tai* was written as *da* (大). *Shi* and *da* were also interchangeable.” They were towering and beyond control. Cheng comments: “Lofty and distant, transcending the world, they could not be restrained.” They were continuous as if fond of seclusion. Li comments: “*Lian* means the appearance of continuity.” Guo comments: “Vast and remote, their gate unseen.” Cheng comments: “Silent as if sealed, their presence unheard.” *Shiwen* notes: “*Hao* is read as *hu bao* (呼报).” They were absent-minded, forgetting their words. *Shiwen* notes: “*Men* is read as *wang ben* (忘本).” Cheng comments: “*Men* is the appearance of absent-mindedness. The above describes the true person’s virtue; below clarifies their way of governing and benefiting things.”

They took punishment as their foundation. Guo comments: “Punishment is the foundation of governance, not of their own making.” They took ritual as their wings. Guo comments: “Ritual is how the world conducts itself, not of their own creation.” They took knowledge as their timing. Guo comments: “Knowledge moves with the times, not of their own initiation.” They took virtue as their guide. Guo comments: “Virtue is what others follow, not of their own design.” Taking punishment as their foundation, they were lenient in execution. Guo comments: “Entrusting governance to the natural course of execution, thus even in killing, they were magnanimous.”

Taking ritual as their wings, they thereby moved through the world.
Guo comments: “Following what the world already practices, thus nothing was unachievable.”

Taking knowledge as their timing, they acted only when compelled by affairs.
Knowledge responded to the moment, compelled by worldly matters, adapting as circumstances required.

Taking virtue as their guide, it was said that they walked with those who had feet to the hill.
Xuan comments: “Where virtue resides, all may reach it; I merely followed. Like a hill that all with feet may climb, I simply ascended with them—no distinction was made.”
Note: Acting without intent to act, they arrived naturally, thus “walked with those who had feet.”

Yet people truly believed them to be diligent in conduct.
Xuan comments: “People saw the true person as tirelessly active, unaware that not even the slightest part was of their own doing.”

Thus, whether they were loved or not loved, it was all the same.
Cheng comments: “Having forgotten attachment to beauty or ugliness, they also cast aside preferences of love and hate. Thus, whether loved or not loved, it arose from the sentiments of the common, while the sage’s emptiness remained undivided.”

Whether unified or not unified, it was all the same.
Cheng comments: “The unified belongs to the sage; the not unified, to the common. Yet sage and common are not two, thus the not unified is also unified.”

In their unity, they walked with Heaven.
In their disunity, they walked with humanity.
Cheng comments: “Harmonizing with Heaven, equalizing the myriad things—they were of Heaven’s kind. Distinctions of self and other—they walked with humanity.”

That Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is called the true person.
Cheng comments: “Though Heaven has no self or other, and humanity has right and wrong, when clearly illuminated, all returns to emptiness. If Heaven were to overcome and humanity to be inferior, how could they be equal? This is the merging of Heaven and humanity, the obscuring of victory and defeat. One who embodies this is called the true person.”

Life and death are fate; their constancy is like night and day—this is Heaven.
What humanity cannot partake in belongs to the nature of things.
Life and death are like night and day, all determined by Heavenly fate, beyond human intervention. This is the nature of things, truly nothing to cling to.

They regarded Heaven as their father and cherished it—how much more that which stands transcendent!
If one cherishes Heaven as their body does, how much more that which rises transcendent from Heaven!

People consider having a lord superior to themselves.
Xuan comments: “The lord’s position surpasses their own.”
And yet they would die for him.
Xuan comments: “They offer loyalty.”
How much more that which is true!
If one cherishes their lord as their body does, how much more that which is truly aligned with him!

When springs run dry, fish find themselves stranded on land, moistening one another with breath, bedewing one another with foam—better far to forget each other in rivers and lakes. This illustrates how clinging to life and fearing death is inferior to forgetting both in the natural Way.

Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao. Xuan comments: “Here *Dao* is used lightly, referring to the way of right and wrong. To praise Yao and condemn Jie is not as good as forgetting both ways; to love life and hate death is not as good as forgetting both burdens.”

For the great clod bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well. Xuan comments: “To follow nature purely is to treat my life well. If so, death will not be bitter.” This passage appears again later. As the *Liezi*’s “Heaven’s Auspices” chapter says: “People all know the joy of life but not its suffering; they know the weariness of old age but not its ease; they know the dread of death but not its rest.”

Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh seems secure—yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unaware would not know. A boat can be carried off, a mountain moved. Xuan comments: “Creation works in silence, yet those who hide things still believe they remain in their original place.” Whether hiding something large or small, there is always a way for it to escape. But if one hides the world within the world, there is no escape—this is the great truth of all things. Whether hiding something large or small, each has its proper place, yet there is no principle that does not change. Xuan comments: “Escape arises from excessive attachment to hiding. But if one awakens to the principle that the world cannot be privately possessed and instead entrusts it to the world, then this principle will be everywhere shared with me—how could there be any escape? This is the true nature of things.”

Yet people delight in possessing human form—if those with human form are but one of ten thousand transformations without end, how boundless their joy must be! *Fan* (犯) is interchangeable with *fan* (笵). Seeing the form of humanity, they rejoice—if human life is endless, who would not delight in their own existence?

Thus, the sage wanders where nothing can escape and all things abide. Xuan comments: “The sage embodies creation entirely; though form has life and death, this principle already flows with heaven and earth—thus it is said that all things abide.”

Excelling in youth and age, in beginnings and ends, people still emulate them—how much more that on which the myriad things depend and by which all transformations await! The *Shiwen* notes: “*Yao* (妖) is also written as *yao* (夭).” Cheng comments: “Whether long-lived or short-lived, young or old, they remain unconcerned. Though they may not forget life and death, they harbor no aversion—this alone is enough to serve as a teacher for others. How much more when one merges with the myriad things, darkly uniting with transformation, becoming the master of all things!”

The Dao has essence and trustworthiness, yet it is without action or form. Xuan comments: “Essence is the movement of stillness; trustworthiness is the sign of movement.” Cheng comments: “Serene and silent, it is without action; invisible, it is without form.”

It can be transmitted but not received. Guo comments: “It has been passed down through the ages as a dwelling, yet none can receive and possess it.” It can be attained but not seen. Cheng comments: “Through solitary awakening in the heart, it can be attained—but separated from form and color, it cannot be seen.”

It is self-originating, self-rooted. Xuan comments: “The Dao is the root of all things, and there is nothing that serves as its own root—it is self-originating, self-rooted.” Before heaven and earth existed, it was already eternally present. Cheng comments: “As Laozi says: ‘There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.’”

It spiritually empowers ghosts and gods, emperors and lords. Below, Kanpi and Feng Yi are ghosts; Xiwei and Fuxi are emperors—all are spiritually empowered by the Dao. It gives birth to heaven and earth. Cheng comments: “As Laozi says: ‘Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes stable.’”

It exists before the Supreme Ultimate yet is not high; it exists below the Six Directions yet is not deep. Before yin and yang divided, this was called the Supreme Ultimate. Heaven, earth, and the four directions are called the Six Directions. Cheng comments: “The Dao exists before the Supreme Ultimate yet is not lofty; it exists below the Six Directions yet is not profound.”

It precedes heaven and earth yet is not ancient; it is older than antiquity yet is not aged. The *Shiwen* notes: “*Zhang* (长) is read as *dingzhang*.” This passage appears again later.

The Lord of Shivei attained it and thereby harnessed heaven and earth. Shivei is the same as Shivei, an ancient emperor. Cheng comments: “Harness (*qie*) is also written as *qi* (契). It means he could unify the myriad things and align them with the Two Modes.”

Fuxi attained it and thereby merged with the Mother of Qi. Cheng comments: “Merged (*xi*) means united. The Mother of Qi is the primordial qi’s source. Having attained the supreme Dao, he was thus able to draw the Eight Trigrams, unfold the six lines, harmonize yin and yang, and unite with the primordial qi.”

The Weaving Dipper attained it and has endured through all ages without error. Cheng comments: “The Northern Dipper serves as the guiding cord for all stars, hence called the Weaving Dipper. Having attained the supreme Dao, it thus sustains heaven and earth, cycling through beginnings and ends without deviation.”

The sun and moon attained it and have endured through all ages without ceasing.

Kanhuai attained it and thereby entered Kunlun. The *Shiwen* notes: “Cui writes *huai* as 邳. Sima comments: ‘Kanhuai is the name of a spirit, with a human face and beast’s form.’ The *Huainanzi* writes it as *Qinfu*.” Cheng comments: “Kunlun is the name of a mountain spirit. Entered (*xi*) means penetrated.”

Feng Yi attained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Sima comments: “The *Qingling Zhuan* states: ‘Feng Yi was a man from Dishou in Tongxiang, Huayin (Cheng’s commentary includes the character *li* [里]). He ingested eight minerals, attained the immortality of water, and became the River Earl.’”

One variant states: “On the gengzi day of the eighth month, he bathed in the river and drowned.”

Jianwu attained it and thereby dwelt upon the great mountains. Sima comments: “A mountain spirit, undying, who lived until the time of Confucius.” Cheng comments: “Having attained the Dao, he dwelt on Mount Tai, becoming the spirit of Mount Tai.”

The Yellow Emperor attained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens. Cui comments: “The Yellow Emperor attained the Dao and ascended to heaven.”

Zhuanxu attained it and thereby resided in the Dark Palace. Li comments: “Zhuanxu was Gaoyang. The Dark Palace is the palace of the north. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: ‘Its sovereign is Zhuanxu; its spirit is Xuanming.’” Cheng comments: “Having attained the Dao, he became the emperor of the north. *Xuan* is the color of the north, hence he resided in the Dark Palace.”

Yuqiong attained it and stood at the North Pole. *Shiwen* notes: “The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: ‘Yuqiong of the north, black-bodied with human hands and feet, rides two dragons.’ Guo Pu takes him as a water spirit, with a human face and bird’s body. Jianwen comments: ‘The spirit of the Northern Sea, also named Yujing, was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor.’”

The Queen Mother of the West attained it and sat upon Shaoguang. None knew her beginning; none knew her end. *Shiwen* notes: “The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: ‘The Queen Mother of the West resembles a human, with a dog’s tail, disheveled hair, and a sheng headdress, skilled in whistling, dwelling at the edge of the sea.’ The *Inner Biography of Emperor Wu of Han* states: ‘The Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of the Upper Prime descended to the emperor, beautiful in countenance, divine immortals.’ Cui comments: ‘Shaoguang is the name of a mountain.’ Another says: It is the name of the empty realm of the west.”

Pengzu attained it, reaching from the time of Youyu down to the Five Hegemons. Cui comments: “Pengzu lived seven hundred years; some consider him an immortal, undying.” Cheng comments: “From the time of Youyu down to Yin and Zhou, he lived eight hundred years in all.”

Fuyue attained it and thereby assisted King Wu Ding, governing the realm. He rode the Eastern Ridge, mounted the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, and ranked among the constellations. Sima comments: “The Eastern Ridge lies between the Winnowing Basket and the Dipper, the eastern ridge of the Celestial Ford. The *Star Canon* states: ‘The star Fuyue lies above the Tail.’” Cui comments: “When Fuyue died, his spirit rode the Eastern Ridge and lodged in the Dragon’s Tail, becoming a constellation.” *Shiwen* notes: “Cui’s edition includes below: ‘Born without parents, at death he ascended in假, and after three years his form vanished—this speaks of the spirit that cannot be named.’” The text below cites seven instances to illustrate this.

Nanbo Zikui asked Yu Yu: “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child. How is this?” Li comments: “Kui should be Qi, a phonetic error.” *Shiwen* notes: “Yu is pronounced like Yu. One says: She is a woman.” Yu Yu replied: “I have heard the Dao.” Nanbo Zikui said: “Can the Dao be learned?” He replied: “Alas! How could it be?”

“You are not the right person for this. Now, there was one named Buliang Yi who possessed the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage. I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage.” Li comments: “Buliang is the surname, Yi the given name.” Xuan remarks: “Yi was keen of intellect, like Zigong; Yu, forgetful of intellect, like Yan Hui.” “I wished to teach him, hoping that he might indeed become a sage! If not, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would have been easy. Yet I persisted in teaching him, holding fast without departing, repeating my instructions again and again. After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself.” Cheng comments: “With the heart emptied and still, all things under heaven become void.” “Once he had put the world outside himself, I persisted further. After seven days, he was able to put things outside himself.” Guo comments: “Things are what one needs morning and night, intimately tied and hard to forget.” Cheng comments: “The world is distant and easily forgotten; the things that sustain the body are near and hard to forget. After seven days of steadfast practice, he was able to leave them behind.” “Once he had put things outside himself, I persisted further. After nine days, he was able to put life outside himself.” Cheng comments: “Body and form dissolved, self forgotten in seated oblivion.” “Once he had put life outside himself, he was then able to attain morning clarity.” Cheng comments: “Viewing death and life as one, forgetting both self and things, suddenly like the dawn breaking—hence ‘morning clarity.’” Xuan remarks: “Morning clarity is like the clarity of early dawn.” “With morning clarity, he was then able to see the solitary.” “To see the One alone.” “Having seen the solitary, he was then able to transcend past and present.” Cheng comments: “Following the daily renewal of creation, moving with change and transformation, thus transcending past and present.” “Having transcended past and present, he was then able to enter into neither-death-nor-life.” Xuan remarks: “Life and death are one. At this point, the Dao is within oneself.” “That which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live.” Su Yu comments: “These two lines elucidate the preceding. Abandoning the delusion of clinging to life is called ‘killing life’; abiding in the spontaneity of nature is called ‘giving life to life.’ Accepting death and life as they come is neither death nor life.” “As for the Dao, in its relation to things, there is nothing it does not escort, nothing it does not welcome.” Cheng comments: “To escort is to send off. The Dao as a thing aids without limit, welcoming endless life and sending off boundless death.” “There is nothing it does not destroy, nothing it does not complete.” Cheng comments: “Without sending, yet sending—nothing is not destroyed; without welcoming, yet welcoming—nothing is not completed.” “Its name is called ‘tranquil amidst entanglement.’” “‘Tranquil amidst entanglement’ means that only after entanglement does one attain completion.” Guo Songtao comments: “Mencius’ Zhao commentary: ‘Entanglement means pressing.’ The perceptions of self and things, life and death press within; the mechanisms of welcoming and sending, completion and destruction press without. Yet one remains unmoved in heart—this is called ‘tranquil amidst entanglement.’ Placing oneself amidst the flourishing changes, conflicts, and clashes of the world, yet with a heart fundamentally at peace, one approaches completion—hence ‘only after entanglement does one attain completion.’”

Nanbo Zikui said: “From whom did you alone hear this?”
He replied: “I heard it from the son of the scribe’s ink.”
Cheng comments: “‘Vice’ means secondary.”
Xuan remarks: “Writing is done with brush and ink, yet writing is not the Dao—it is but an aid to transmitting the Dao. Hence it is called ‘the scribe’s ink.’ Moreover, compared to the original writing, later texts are its progeny, hence ‘the son of the scribe’s ink.’”
“The son of the scribe’s ink heard it from the grandson of recitation.”
Cheng comments: “Reciting it in a connected manner.”
Note: This refers to repeated reading, as in “connecting and reciting.” *Luo* and *luo* are homophonous loan characters. Compared to the ancient practice of reading books, hence “the grandson of recitation.” Ancient books were first transmitted orally and later inscribed on bamboo and silk, hence the sequence.
“The grandson of recitation heard it from Illuminating Vision.”
“Illuminating Vision heard it from Whispered Assent.”
“Whispered Assent” refers to soft speech, like murmuring.
“Whispered Assent heard it from Diligent Practice.”
Cheng comments: “‘Diligent’ means ‘must’; ‘practice’ means ‘to act.’ One must act diligently without slackening.”
“Diligent Practice heard it from Chanting.”
The *Shiwen* reads: “Yu is pronounced like *wu*. Wang comments: ‘Chanting refers to songs and ballads.’”
Xuan remarks: “Through chanting and singing, one deeply lodges the meaning.”
“Chanting heard it from Dark Obscurity.”
Xuan remarks: “Dark Obscurity is a place of stillness and silence.”
“Dark Obscurity heard it from Profound Solitude.”
Xuan remarks: “Profoundly realizing emptiness and void.”
“Profound Solitude heard it from Doubting the Beginning.”
Xuan remarks: “Reaching the point of no trace, one hears the Dao. ‘Doubting the Beginning’ means that it seems to have a beginning yet never truly had one.”

The four—Zisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai—spoke among themselves, saying: “Who can take nonbeing as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who understands that life, death, existence, and extinction are of one body? I would befriend such a one.” Cheng comments: “Humans arise from emptiness, thus nonbeing is the head. From nonbeing comes being, and life follows, thus life is the spine. Death comes last, thus it is the tailbone. Life and death, though distinct, are of one body. One who grasps this truth finds all encounters fitting; how could there be joy or aversion between existence and extinction? Whoever understands this, I would befriend.”

The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.

Soon after, Ziyu fell ill, and Zisi went to visit him. He exclaimed: “How magnificent!”

The Maker of Things would fashion me into this cramped form!" Cheng comments: "Ziyu laments his own condition." Sima explains: "Cramped—his body is contorted and contracted." His spine was bent, his back hunched, his five vital tubes protruding upward—these were the five visceral conduits turned outward. His chin sank into his navel, his shoulders rose above his crown, and his nape pointed heavenward. Li explains: "His nape, like an excrescence, jutted upward." The qi of yin and yang had fallen into disorder. Yet his heart remained at ease, untroubled. He hobbled swiftly to the well and gazed into it, saying: "Alas! Would the Maker of Things fashion me into this cramped form again!" He sighed once more.

Zisi asked: "Do you resent this?"
Ziyu replied: "No, not at all. Why should I resent it? If gradually my left arm were transformed into a rooster, I would use it to mark the watches of the night. If my right arm were transformed into a crossbow pellet, I would use it to seek roasted owl. If my tailbone were transformed into a wheel and my spirit into a horse, I would ride it—why would I need another steed?" Guo comments: "There is no going forth without cause, and no cause that cannot be followed." Moreover, to gain is to meet one’s time, and to lose is to follow the natural course. Abiding in one’s time and following the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called "suspended release." Cheng comments: "To gain is to live; to lose is to die." As in the *Yangsheng zhu* chapter: "To come is to meet one’s time; to depart is to follow the natural course. Abiding in one’s time and following the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this the release of the bound by the Sovereign." This passage confirms it. Yet one who cannot release themselves is bound by things. Guo comments: "If one cannot release themselves, the myriad things will bind them together." Moreover, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven—why should I resent it?"

Soon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as he neared death. His wife and children gathered around him, weeping. Cheng comments: "Gasping—his breath was labored." Zili went to visit him and shouted: "Begone!"

"Shoo! Make his wife and children leave. Do not be startled by transformation!" *Shiwen* notes: "怛 means 'to startle.'" Do not be alarmed by the one about to transform.

Leaning against the doorframe, Zili spoke to him: "How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? What thing will it make you? Where will it send you? Will it make you a rat’s liver? A bug’s arm?" Wang comments: "Taking the most minute and base things."

Zilai said: "To parents, a child must follow their commands, no matter if they send them east, west, south, or north. The yin and yang of the world are no less to a person than their parents. Cheng comments: 'The transformations of yin and yang—how are they any different from one’s two parents?' If they press me toward death and I do not heed them, then I am obstinate. What fault is theirs? They are yin and yang. Obstinate means disobedient. Xuan comments: '近 means to press close.'

"The great clod bears me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well." These six phrases also appear in the *Da zongshi* chapter.

"Now, a great smith forging metal—if the metal leaps up and says, 'I must become a *Mo* sword!' the great smith will surely deem it an inauspicious metal. A great smith is a metal-forging artisan. If one, upon assuming human form, says, 'I am human! I am human!' the Creator will surely deem them an inauspicious person. *Fan* is the same as *fan* (mold). To become human by chance, then delight in it and cherish it as something distinct from other things—this is what the Creator will deem inauspicious.

"Now, take heaven and earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith—where could one go and not be acceptable?" Rat’s liver or bug’s arm—what concern are they to one’s thoughts!

Then he fell into a deep sleep and awoke transformed. To become human is to sleep; to depart in length is to awaken.

Zisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang were three friends who said to one another: "Who can join together in non-joining, act for one another in non-acting?" Cheng comments: "Like the hundred parts of the body, each with its own function, mutually serving one another without intent to join or act—yet the work of mutual aid is accomplished. Thus, to move together in non-joining and befriend in non-acting is the same."

"Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists?" Xuan comments: "To rise beyond things." "Who can twist and turn without end?" Li comments: "挠挑 means to meander, to wander in the vast and mysterious." "Who can forget life and have no end or limit?" Xuan comments: "Neither delighting in life nor loathing death."

The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.

After a tranquil moment—Cui comments: "莫然 means settled; 闲 means a brief time"—Zisang Hu died, and his body had not yet been buried. Confucius heard of this and sent Zigong to attend to the funeral rites. Cheng comments: "To provide for the funeral."

Some wove bamboo mats—Li comments: "曲 means silkworm trays"—while others played the zither, harmonizing as they sang: "Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu! You have returned to your true nature, while we still remain human, alas!" Cheng comments: "猗 is a harmonizing sound."

Zigong hurried forward and said: "May I ask—is it proper to sing before the corpse?"

The two looked at each other and smiled, saying: "What does he know of the meaning of ritual?" *This* refers to Zigong.

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius: "What sort of men are they? They lack cultivated conduct, disregard their own bodies, sing before the corpse, and show no change in countenance. I have no name for them. What sort of men are they?"

Confucius said: "They wander beyond the bounds, while I wander within them. Cheng comments: '方 means boundary.' Beyond and within do not reach one another, and yet I sent you to offer condolences—how crude of me!

"They are about to become companions to the Creator." Wang Yinzhi comments: "为人 means 'to be a companion.' The *Zhongyong* says, 'The humane are human,' and Zheng’s commentary reads: 'Read as the "mutual companions" in *xiang ren ou*.' The *Gongshi dafu* commentary says: 'At every bow and when facing the stele, they bow as mutual companions.' Thus, *ren* and *ou* share the same meaning. The *Huainanzi*’s *Yuandao* chapter says, 'To be companions to the Creator,' and the *Qisu* chapter says, 'Above, they befriend the divine and enlightened; below, they become companions to the Creator'—this is the clearest proof."

"Yet they wander in the single qi of heaven and earth. They regard life as an excrescence or hanging tumor—Cheng comments: 'Qi gathers to form life, like a tumor or growth attached—nothing to delight in'—and death as the bursting of an abscess. *Shiwen* notes: '● is pronounced *huàn*.' Xuan comments: 'A type of ulcer.' Cheng comments: 'Qi scatters in death, like an abscess bursting—nothing to regret.'

"Those who are like this—how could they know where life and death, before and after, reside?" Xuan comments: "A single qi in circulation."

"Borrowing from different things, entrusting themselves to a shared body—Xuan comments: "As in the *Yuanjue Jing*’s teaching that earth, wind, water, and fire combine to form the body—seeing life as mere chance." Forgetting their liver and gall, disregarding their ears and eyes—Xuan comments: "Disregarding the body, seeing death as mere chance." Reversing and repeating, beginning and ending, not knowing the head or tail, coming and going in life and death, never knowing their limit.

"Vaguely wandering beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action." Cheng comments: "芒然 means the appearance of unawareness. To be unrestrained beyond the dust’s burdens, at ease in the realm of clarity and vastness."

The Master could hardly be expected to entangle himself in the world’s conventional rites, merely to display himself before the eyes and ears of the crowd!" Cheng comments: "愦愦 means confusion and disorder." *Shiwen* notes: "观 means to display."

Zigong asked: "Then what path does the Master follow?"
Cheng comments: "Within the bounds of the world or beyond them—we do not know which Way the Master follows."
Confucius replied: "Qiu is one punished by Heaven."
Cheng comments: "Sacred traces and ritual propriety are but shackles upon form and nature. Since the Master remains within the bounds of the world, he follows the principle of nature—yet is one marked by punishment. Thus, in the 'Virtue Complete' chapter, it is said: *'Punished by Heaven, how could he be freed?*'"
"Nevertheless, I share this with you."
Xuan comments: "He does not wish to conceal what he has attained."

Zigong said: "May I ask about this path?"
Confucius replied: "Fish are made for water, just as humans are made for the Dao. 造 means to reach. Fish that reach water find joy; humans that reach the Dao find joy. Those who are made for water dig ponds to sustain themselves; those made for the Dao find tranquility without effort."
*Shiwen* notes: "池 may also be written as 地." Both versions are valid.
"Fish obtain water and are sustained; humans obtain the Dao and their nature is settled. 生 and 性 are interchangeable. Thus it is said: *Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; humans forget one another in the arts of the Dao.*"
Xuan comments: "The greater the expanse, the greater the ease—how could it be merely a matter of sustenance and settled nature?"

Zigong said: "May I ask about the *jiren*?"
Sima comments: "畸 means unpaired."
Guo comments: "He asks: Where are those who dwell beyond the bounds of the world and do not pair with convention?"
Confucius replied: "The *jiren* is one unpaired with others yet equal to Heaven."
Sima comments: "侔 means equal."
Cheng comments: "Following their original nature, they align with the principle of nature."
"Thus it is said: *What is a petty person in Heaven is a noble person among humans; what is a noble person among humans is a petty person in Heaven.*"
Xuan comments: "Bound by ritual and propriety, ignorant of the true nature of life and destiny, yet humans call them refined."
*Note: All versions agree on this text. It seems repetitive and without meaning; it should likely read: "What is a noble person in Heaven is a petty person among humans."*
Cheng comments: "Zifan and Qin Zhang, unpaired with convention, are called *jiren*—truly noble persons in Heaven."
*Note: To be unpaired with convention means to reject ritual propriety, so humans all disdain them. Thus it is said: "What is a noble person in Heaven is a petty person among humans." The meaning is clear.*
Su Yu comments: "If we judge the *jiren* by the standards of petty humans, then even Qin Zhang and Mengsun would be deemed unworthy. Could Zhuangzi truly be one who does not understand ritual?"

Yan Hui asked Confucius: "Mengsun Cai—what sort of talent is he?"

Yan Hui said: "When his mother died, he wept without tears, his heart felt no grief, and he showed no sorrow in mourning. Lacking these three, he was yet praised throughout Lu for his mastery of mourning rites. Could one truly gain such a reputation without substance? I find this most strange."

*Note: Guo Xiang, Lu Deming, and Cheng Xuanying’s versions end the sentence at "mourning."*
Li Zhen comments: "The meaning remains incomplete. The phrase 'praised throughout Lu' should belong to the preceding clause, akin to the line in 'The Emperor of All Things'—'his merit covered all under Heaven.' The *Shi Yan* states: '弇 means to cover.' The *Shi Ming* says: '盖 means to surpass.' Both imply rising above. Thus, Mengsun Cai’s reputation for mastery of mourning rites surpassed all in Lu."

Confucius said: "Mengsun Cai has exhausted the Way—he has surpassed mere knowledge. As Cheng notes: '进 means to exceed.' Xuan comments: 'He has fully realized the Dao, surpassing those who merely know mourning rites.' He sought simplicity but could not fully attain it. Xuan comments: 'Simplicity means to reduce affairs. Bound by世俗 conventions, he could not entirely dispense with weeping and mourning rites.' Yet he has already simplified much. Xuan comments: 'Still, he wept without tears, felt no grief, and showed no sorrow—this is already a form of simplicity.' Su Yu remarks: 'These two lines are general statements, not specific to Mengsun Cai.' Yao comments: 'Ordinary people are shackled by emotions of life and death, believing sorrow to be natural. Though they cannot fully simplify, they remain unaware that in the truth of nature and destiny, they have already simplified much.' This seems superior to Xuan’s interpretation.*

Mengsun Cai did not know why he lived, nor why he died. Xuan comments: 'He entrusted life and death to nature—this is how he surpassed mere knowledge.' He did not seek what came before, nor what came after. Cheng comments: 'Before refers to life; after, to death. United in life and death, he neither departed nor clung.' Transformed into another thing, he awaited the transformations he could not know! Xuan comments: 'He followed the process of transformation, awaiting whatever unknown changes might come.' Consider: death is transformation into a ghostly thing. But who knows if he might not become a rat’s liver or an insect’s limb—transformations beyond knowing! And if he is about to transform, how could one know he has not already done so? If he is about to remain unchanged, how could one know he has not already transformed? Xuan comments: 'These four lines describe the unknowable transformations—none of which are within our control.' Are you and I merely dreamers who have yet to awaken? Xuan comments: 'We have not yet attained Mengsun Cai’s surpassing knowledge.'

Moreover, he experienced a startling change in form but suffered no harm to his heart. Though Mengsun Cai’s form underwent shocking alteration, his heart remained unburdened. His dwelling renewed daily, yet he did not truly die. Cheng comments: '旦 means daily renewal. 宅 is the abode of the spirit. The body’s changes are but the daily renewal of this dwelling.' Yao comments: '情 means reality. He knew there was no true death.' Mengsun Cai alone was awake. When others wept, he wept too—this was simply how things were. *乃 means "thus." When others wept, he wept without contrivance.* Su Yu comments: 'The phrase "Mengsun Cai alone was awake" stands alone. We are all dreamers, but Mengsun alone is awake. When others wept, he wept too—this was his spontaneous response.'

Furthermore, people see this temporary body of mine and call it "me." But how can they know what I truly mean by "me"? Is this body truly me, or not? You dream of becoming a bird and soaring to the heavens, *厉 and 戾 are homophones, meaning "to reach."* or of becoming a fish and sinking into the depths. But who can say whether the speaker now is awake or dreaming? Is the bird or fish the dream, or is the one speaking of them the dream? One stumbles upon joy before laughter arises; laughter erupts before one can arrange it. Xuan comments: 'People assume laughter arises from joy, yet when joy suddenly strikes, the heart grasps it before laughter comes. And when laughter bursts forth, it is the spontaneous movement of nature—one cannot contrive or arrange it. Thus, joy and laughter are not under our control.' If you calmly accept the arrangements of transformation, you enter the vast oneness of Heaven. Xuan comments: 'From this, we see that nothing is within our control—there is always something arranging it in the unseen. One should simply accept these arrangements, letting go of sorrow over death and transformation, and thus enter the empty, unified vastness of Heaven.'"

Yi’erzi went to see Xu You. Xu You asked: "How did Yao assist you?" Cheng comments: "Yi’er was a worthy man of old." Guo comments: "资 means to provide or aid." Yi’erzi replied: "Yao told me: 'You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness, and clearly distinguish right from wrong.'" Cheng comments: "You must practice them yourself and also make them clear to others." Xu You said: "Then why have you come here?" *而 means "you." 轵 is equivalent to 只.*

"Now, Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong—*as if subjecting you to punishment.* How then will you wander the paths of carefree wandering, unbridled freedom, and ceaseless transformation?"

Yi’erzi said: "Though this be so, I still wish to wander within its hedges." *Though I cannot follow the Way itself, I hope to dwell near its fences.*

Xu You said: "It cannot be. The blind have no part in the beauty of brows and eyes or the radiance of countenance; the sightless cannot share in the splendor of blue and yellow, embroidered patterns and brocade."

Yi’erzi said: "Wu Zhuang lost her beauty—*Wu Zhuang was a beauty of old who, upon hearing the Dao, no longer adorned herself and forgot her own loveliness.* Ju Liang lost his strength—*Ju Liang was a man of great strength who, upon hearing the Dao and embracing stillness, lost his power.* The Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom—*though the Yellow Emperor possessed sagely knowledge, upon hearing the Dao, he was able to cast it aside.* All this occurred within the forge and hammer." *The forge is the hearth; the hammer, the mallet. These three, having grasped the Dao and aligned with truth, were like vessels shaped by the furnace and anvil to serve their purpose.*

"How do we know the Creator will not cease my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride in completion and follow you, Master?"

*To ride is to be carried. Branding and mutilation leave the body incomplete; if they cease and are mended, wholeness is restored. Heaven has now brought me to you, Master—how do we know it will not allow me to be carried in wholeness and follow you?"*

Xu You said: "Alas! It cannot be known."

"Let me speak to you of its general outline.

O my Master! O my Master!
Crushing the myriad things yet not acting for righteousness,
bestowing blessings upon ten thousand generations yet not acting for benevolence—
Sima [Biao] says: '● means to shatter.'
Lu Wenchang says: 'The *Shuowen* writes it as ●, also as . The clerical script simplifies it to .'
Cheng [Xuanying] says: 'Autumn frost descends and shatters the myriad things, yet it does so without intent to sever, thus not acting for righteousness. The harmonious qi of spring nurtures and gives life to the myriad things, yet it does so without affectionate intent, thus not acting for benevolence.'

Ageless since high antiquity yet not deemed old—
Cheng [Xuanying] says: 'Before the myriad forms existed, this Dao already was, ever renewing without end.'

Enveloping heaven and earth, carving and sculpting the forms of all things yet not deemed artful—
Cheng [Xuanying] says: 'Heaven covers and earth bears all through the Dao as their source; the carving of all forms relies on the transformations of creation. Since all equally receive this natural endowment, the name of artifice vanishes.'

This is the realm in which he roams."
Xuan [Ying] says: "This responds to the earlier 'roaming.'"

Yan Hui said: "I have gained much."

Confucius said, "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied, "I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness."
Confucius said, "That is acceptable, yet still not sufficient."

Another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, "I have gained much."
Confucius asked, "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied, "I have forgotten ritual and music."
Confucius said, "That is acceptable, yet still not sufficient."

Another day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, "I have gained much."
Confucius asked, "What do you mean?"
Yan Hui replied, "I have attained 'sitting in forgetfulness.'"
Sima [Biao] says: "Sitting and forgetting oneself entirely."

Confucius started and asked, "What is 'sitting in forgetfulness'?"
Yan Hui said, "I discard my limbs and body, dismiss my wisdom and clarity."
Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Discard means to abolish; dismiss means to set aside."
"I detach from form and cast off knowledge,"
Xuan [Ying] says: "Summarizing the two lines above."
"and merge with the Great Thoroughfare."
Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Becoming obscurely one with the great Dao."

Confucius said, "To be one is to have no preferences,"
Xuan [Ying] says: "Without partiality."
"to transform is to have no constancy."
Xuan [Ying] says: "Without attachment to principles."
"How truly worthy you are! I would ask to follow after you."

Ziyu and Zisang were friends. When continuous rain fell for ten days,—
Rain lasting three days or more is called *lin*—
Ziyu said, "Zisang is likely in distress!" He wrapped rice and went to feed him.

Upon reaching Zisang’s door, he heard something between singing and weeping, as Zisang plucked his zither and said:
"Father! Mother! Heaven! Humanity!"
His voice could not bear the strain, yet he hurriedly recited his verse.

Cui [Wei] says: "Unable to bear his voice—he was exhausted."
Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Trend: hasty and urgent."

Ziyu entered and said, "Why do you sing your verse in such a manner?"
Cheng [Xuanying] says: "His singing seemed resentful, so Ziyu asked in surprise what had caused it."

Zisang replied, "I pondered what brought me to this extremity, yet found no answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without partiality—would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I sought the cause, yet could not find it. Nevertheless, to reach this extremity is fate indeed!" To know what fate has wrought is simply to follow it.

**Inner Chapters, "Fit for Emperors and Kings," Chapter Seven**
Guo [Xiang] says: "To be without intent and yield to self-transformation—this is how one fits to be emperor or king."

Nie Que questioned Wang Ni, asking four times and receiving four times no answer. (See "The Equality of Things and Opinions.")

Nie Que leapt with great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.
*Shiwen* notes: "The *Shizi* says, 'At eight years old, Pu Yi was offered the throne by Shun.' Cui [Wei] says, 'That is, Clothed-in-Rags, Wang Ni’s teacher.' The *Huainanzi* says, 'Nie Que sought the Dao from Clothed-in-Rags.'"

Master Pu Yi said, "So now you have understood it? You."

The Youyu clan did not match the Tai clan. *Cheng* notes: "The Tai clan refers to Taihao Fuxi." The Youyu clan still harbored virtue to bind people, and though it gained people’s allegiance, it had not yet emerged from the realm of the non-human. *Cui* notes: "This means cherishing virtue to win people’s hearts." *Xuan* comments: "The non-human refers to things. To bind people with intent is still to strike at things—this is not yet to transcend beyond them."

The Tai clan, in its repose, was serene; in its awakening, unknowing. *Sima* notes: "Serene describes its tranquil slumber; unknowing, its lack of awareness." At times it took itself for a horse, at times for an ox. *Cheng* notes: "Whether horse or ox, it answered to whatever it was called." Its knowledge was true to its nature, *Cheng* notes: "It followed its genuine knowing, its feelings free of pretense." Its power was utterly real. *Guo* says: "It let things be as they were, so there was no falsity." Yet it had never entered the realm of the non-human. *Xuan* comments: "It merged with the natural, utterly unburdened by things, never sinking into their midst."

Jian Wu met the madman Jie Yu. Jie Yu asked: "What did Rizhong Shi tell you?" *Li* notes: "Rizhong Shi was the name of a worthy man." The *Cui* edition omits the character "日" and reads: "Zhong Shi was a worthy man." *Yu* comments: "日 here means 'recently,' as in the *Zuozhuan* entries for the seventh year of Duke Wen, the twenty-sixth year of Duke Xiang, the seventh year of Duke Zhao, and the nineteenth year of Duke Zhao."

Jian Wu replied: "He told me that a ruler, by imposing his own standards—laws, models, norms, and measures—*Sima* notes: "出 means 'to enact.'" *Wang Niansun* comments: "经式义度 all refer to regulations; 义 should be read as 仪, as the characters were interchangeable in antiquity."—could make people obey and transform without daring to resist!"

Jie Yu said: "This is deceptive power. *Cheng* notes: "To impose one’s will on things is to strip them of their truth—this is a deceitful power, not the true Way." In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea to dig a river or carrying a mountain on one’s back. The sage’s governance—does it concern externals? To rely on laws is to govern externals. First rectify, then act; first align with nature, then enact transformation. It is simply to ensure that each does what it is truly capable of. *Li* notes: "确 means 'firm.'" *Xuan* comments: "Not forcing people to do what their nature finds difficult."

Moreover, birds fly high to evade the harm of nets and arrows, while field mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape the peril of fumigation and digging. *Cheng* notes: "矰 refers to nets; 鼷鼠, a tiny mouse; 神丘, an altar to the earth god." *Xuan* comments: "Even creatures know this much." How much more ignorant are these two creatures—how could humans be less knowing than they?"

Tian Gen wandered in Yin Yang, *Cui* notes: "A place name." and arrived at the banks of the Liao River. *Li* notes: "Liao River, a river name." There he encountered the Nameless Man and asked: "May I inquire about governing the world?"

The Nameless Man said: "Begone! You are a crude man—why do your questions never weary?" *Yu* comments: "*Shuowen* defines 豫 as 'weary.' In the *Chuci*’s *Xi Song*, '行婞直而不豫兮,' Wang Yi’s annotation reads: '豫 means weary.' Here, the Nameless Man chides Tian Gen for his endless questions, as if to say, 'Why are you not afraid of tiring me?'"

"I am about to join the Creator in becoming human—*human* here means *companion*, as explained in the *Great and Venerable Teacher* chapter. Weary of this, I will then ride the boundless bird of the vast and distant—*Cheng* notes: "莽眇 means 'profound and remote.'" *Note*: This refers to the ethereal qi, like a bird.—to soar beyond the six directions *Cheng* notes: "六极 refers to the six directions." and wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, as described in the *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter. There I will dwell in the wild expanse. *Cui* notes: "圹埌 means 'vast and unbounded.'" Why do you trouble my heart with your schemes for governing the world?" *帠*: Xu pronounces it as *yi*, but the character is unclear. The *Cui* edition reads "为," which should be followed.

Tian Gen asked again. The Nameless Man replied: "Let your mind wander in simplicity, harmonize your qi with stillness, follow the natural course of things, and harbor no private designs—*Xuan* comments: "Do not rely on your own cleverness."—and the world will be governed."

Sun Ziju visited Lao Dan and said—*Cheng* notes: "His surname was Yang, his courtesy name Ziju." *Note*: This refers to Yang Zhu, as explained in the *Parables* chapter—"Suppose there were a man here who is swift and resolute, keen and decisive, whose understanding of things is penetrating and clear, and who studies the Dao without weariness. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"

Lao Dan replied: "In the eyes of a sage, he is like a petty officer bound to his duties or a craftsman shackled to his skill—one who exhausts his body and startles his mind. *Guo Qingfan* notes: '胥徒 refers to commoners conscripted for corvée labor. 易 means 'to manage.' 胥易 thus means petty officers performing their duties. 技系 refers to the *Rites of Zhou* passage: 'Those who serve their superiors with a skill shall not take on a second occupation nor transfer to another office'—they are bound by their craft.' Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters, and the agility of gibbons and macaques brings them capture. *Note*: 便 means 'nimble.' A dog skilled in seizing prey is leashed. *Sima* notes: '藉 means 'to bind.' *Note*: Monkeys and dogs are bound because of their abilities. Both phrases also appear in the *Heaven and Earth* chapter. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?"

Sun Chujū bowed deeply and asked, "May I inquire about the governance of an enlightened king?"

Lao Dan replied, "The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover all under heaven yet seem not his own. *Cheng Xuanying* notes: 'The sage’s accomplishments are complete, yet he does not claim them as his own.' He transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. *Xuan Ying* notes: 'Bestows, meaning to grant.' *Cheng Xuanying* notes: 'The common folk believe they do not depend on the ruler’s ability.' He possesses something yet cannot be named. *Xuan Ying* notes: 'He seems to have it, yet it cannot be named.' He allows things to delight in themselves. *Cheng Xuanying* notes: 'Each thing attains its own fulfillment.' He stands in the unfathomable and roams in the realm of nothingness. *Xuan Ying* notes: 'What abides is spirit; he acts without contrivance.'"

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian. The *Liezi* chapter "The Yellow Emperor" states: "A divine diviner came from Qi and settled in Zheng; he was called Ji Xian." He knew the life and death, survival and perishing, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, or day with godlike accuracy. Whether a year, a month, or a day, none of his predictions failed. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in haste. *Xuan Ying* notes: "Fearing he would speak of their misfortune." When Liezi saw him, he was spellbound. *Xiang Xiu* notes: "Bewitched by his way." Returning, he told Master Hu, *Liezi* writes "Master Huqiu." *Sima Biao* notes: "His name was Lin, a man of Zheng and Liezi’s teacher." saying, "At first I thought my master’s Dao was supreme, but now there is something even more supreme."

Master Hu said, "I have taught you only its outward forms, not yet its true substance—how could you have truly attained the Dao? *Cheng Xuanying* notes: '与 means 'to transmit.' 既 means 'to exhaust.' Compared to what I have transmitted to you, you have only grasped the words, not yet penetrated their profound truth. How can you cling to mere words and claim to have attained the Dao?'" *Note*: The *Liezi* reads "without its outward forms." *Zhang Zhan*’s commentary cites *Xiang Xiu*: "Truth is revealed through form; the Dao is made manifest through affairs. To have the Dao without affairs is like having a female without a male. Now, though you and I differ in depth, without form to bring it forth, the true substance of my Dao remains unexhausted. This means that when a sage initiates, there must be a response before there is harmony."

"A flock of hens without a rooster—how can they lay eggs? *Guo Xiang* notes: 'This metaphor means Liezi has not yet embraced the Dao.' And you, seeking to contend with the world and force your way, *Note*: 而 refers to you. 信 is read as 'to extend.' Your Dao is still shallow, yet you contend with the world, striving to impose yourself. The *Liezi* writes 亢 as 抗. Thus you allow others to perceive and assess you. Bring him here and let me show myself to him."

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi, "Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. It will not be counted in days! I saw something strange: I saw damp ashes." *Xuan Ying* notes: "He spoke of lifeless embers."

Liezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels, and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, "Just now I showed him the pattern of earth: *Liezi*’s commentary cites *Xiang Xiu*: 'Like a clod of soil.' Sprouting yet unmoved, unshaken. *Yu Yue* notes: 'The *Liezi* reads: '罪乎不震不止,' which should be followed. 罪 is read as ●, written in the *Shuowen* as ●, meaning 'the appearance of a mountain.' 震 is an alternate form of 震. 不震不止 means 'unmoving and unceasing,' hence described as ●乎, likening it to a mountain. Now 罪 is mistakenly written as 萌, and 止 as 正, losing the original meaning.' According to the *Exegesis*, *Cui Zhuan*’s version reads '不震不止,' matching the *Liezi*, which can be used to correct the text." *Note*: *Liezi*’s commentary cites *Xiang Xiu*: 'Unmoving, yet not ceasing of itself, like a withered tree sharing its lack of blossoms, or dead ashes equal in their stillness—this is the time when the perfected one is without response.' This was nearly showing him my blocked virtue-mechanism. *Cheng Xuanying* notes: '杜 means 'to block.'' The *Liezi* writes 机 as 几. Its commentary cites *Xiang Xiu*: 'The mechanism of virtue does not emerge, hence called 'blocked.'' Bring him here again." *Note*: 尝 also means 'to try.'"

The next day, he brought him again to see Master Huzi. Upon leaving, he said to Liezi: "How fortunate! Your master has met me. He is recovering, fully alive now." *Liezi* writes 全 as 灰. "I have seen his blocked adaptability." *Xuan* notes: "Within the blockage, I sensed his capacity for change."

Liezi entered and reported this to Master Huzi. Huzi said: "Earlier, I showed him Heaven and Earth." *Liezi*’s commentary cites *Xiang Xiu*: "Within Heaven and Earth, the power of covering and bearing is manifest. Compared to the patterns of earth, is this not external?" *Note*: Guo’s commentary writes "之地" for "地之" and "卵" for "外," which are likely errors. Some claim Guo plagiarized *Xiang*’s commentary—perhaps not entirely, but cases like this may approach it. "Name and reality did not enter him." *Liezi*’s commentary cites *Xiang Xiu*: "When one follows the natural and embraces the covering and bearing, then name and reality both become discarded things." *Note*: Guo’s commentary adds after "则": "the mysterious response of the celestial mechanism, and the adornments of name and profit all become discarded things." "Yet the mechanism arose from his heels." *Xuan* notes: "A surge of vital mechanism, issuing from the heels." "This was nearly showing him my mechanism of goodness." *Xuan* notes: "Goodness here means the impulse of life."

"Bring him here again."

The next day, he brought him again to see Master Huzi.

Listz emerged and said to Liezi: "Your master is not in equipoise. *Shiwen* notes: *ce zai* (侧皆) *fan* (反), with an alternate reading as *zhai* (斋). Below likewise." I could find no basis to assess him. Try to attain equipoise, and I shall assess him again."

Liezi entered and reported this to Master Huzi. Huzi said: "Just now I showed him the Great Thoroughfare in its unopposable vastness. *Liezi* writes *zhen* (眹) for *sheng* (胜), which should be followed. The *Xiang* commentary states: 'Abiding at the utmost of the Great Thoroughfare, with a mind vast and still, one merges with the ten thousand directions—no trace of it can be seen.'" *Note*: Guo’s commentary renders "no trace of it can be seen" as "thus neither victory nor defeat can find place therein."

This was nearly showing him my balanced qi-mechanism. *Xuan* notes: "Heng (衡) means level." The *Liezi* commentary cites *Xiang*: "Level in all directions, merged into oneness." *Note*: Guo’s commentary is identical.

The depth where the *ni*-fish coils is a deep pool; the depth where still water abides is a deep pool; the depth where flowing water abides is a deep pool. There are nine names for deep pools—here three are given. *Liezi* writes "the depth where the *ni*-fish coils" as "the swirling eddy of the *ni*-fish." Zhang’s commentary holds that it should be *pan* (蟠), stating: "The *ni* is a great fish. *Huan* (桓) means to coil. *Pan* (蟠) means to swirl. It speaks of the great fish coiling, its waters swirling to form a deep spring."

The nine names for deep pools are: *ni*-coiling, still water, flowing water, overflowing water (*Er ya*: "water gushing forth"), cascading water (spring water flowing down from above), lateral water (spring water issuing from the side), dammed water (river water bursting forth and then returning), streaming water (water flowing onward), and fertile water (water issuing from different sources to become fertile). These are the nine deep pools, all from *Liezi*’s text.

*Cheng* comments: "The water’s body is without intent; its movement and stillness follow things. Whether whales and *ni*-fish coil, or it congeals and abides still, or waves surge and churn—though there are many kinds, all are one in their dark silence and absence of intent."

"Bring him here again."

The next day, he again brought him to see Master Huzi. Before he could stand firmly, the visitor fled in alarm. Master Huzi said, "Pursue him!" Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Huzi, saying, "He has vanished, he is lost—I could not reach him."

Master Huzi said, "Earlier, I showed him that which had not yet emerged from my origin. Deeply rooted and profoundly obscure, he could not perceive the master of my origin. I met him with emptiness and followed along." *Cheng* comments: "Commissioned compliance, an appearance of following along." *Guo* comments: "Without intent, one follows the transformations of things." *Note*: In *Liezi*, "commissioned compliance" is written as "yielding movement," but the meaning is the same. "He knew not who or what it was." *Xiang* comments: "Floating freely, without attachment." *Note*: *Guo*’s annotation is the same. "Thus, I made him like trailing grass." *Shiwen* notes: "The pronunciation of *di* is like *tui*. *Dimi*, an appearance of boundlessness." Lu Wenchang comments: "The *Zhengzitong* writes *di* as ●, and later dictionaries followed suit, though this character does not appear in ancient texts. The *Leipian* lists an alternate pronunciation for *di* as *tuihui*, glossing it as 'an appearance of boundlessness.' This is the original source. In *Liezi*, it is written as 'marsh grass.'"

"Thus, he made him like flowing waves." Cui's edition reads "wave-following," with the annotation: "Always following along." Wang Niansun comments: "Cui's edition is correct. *She*, *he*, *mi*, and *sui* form a rhyme. *She* in ancient pronunciation is *tuohe* (徒禾反). *Mi* in ancient pronunciation is *mo* (摩). *Sui* in ancient pronunciation is also *tuohe* (徒何反)." "Therefore, he fled." Cheng comments: "Following the momentum of the moment without any attachment, undergoing myriad transformations—none of which the physiognomist could comprehend—hence Jiyuan fled."

*Note*: The *Liezi* commentary cites Xiang's annotation: "The perfected person's movement is like heaven, their stillness like earth, their conduct like flowing water, their depth like a silent abyss. The silent abyss and flowing water, the movement of heaven and the stillness of earth—though differing in form, their spontaneity and non-action are one. Now, when Jiyuan saw him dwelling like a corpse and sitting in oblivion, he called it approaching death; when he saw his spirit moving in celestial accord, he called it possessing life. If one responds to stimuli without intent, ascending and descending with change, taking the world as measure, then one may truly master things and follow the timeless without limit—how could a physiognomist perceive this?"

Thereafter, Liezi, considering himself as yet unlearned, returned home. Cheng comments: "Only then did he realize the profundity of Master Huqiu's Dao and recognize his own lack of learning." For three years, he did not venture out. He cooked for his wife. Xiang comments: "Abandoning shame and disgrace."

Eating pork was to him as eating human flesh. *Li's commentary: "食 pronounced as sì."* Guo comments: "Forgetting distinctions of noble and base." He took no part in affairs, nor drew near to worldly matters. Carving and polishing returned to simplicity. Cheng comments: "All tasks of ornate adornment were wholly set aside, reverting to plainness." Solitary, he stood alone in his form—block-like, without peer. In tumult he was sealed. *Li's commentary: "纷而, Cui comments: 'a state of chaos.' 哉, Cui’s text reads 戎, explaining: '封戎 means scattered disorder.'" Li Zhen comments: "Cui’s version is correct. *Liezi* reads '●然而封戎.' The six lines—人, 亲; 朴, 立; 戎, 终—each form their own rhyme."* Thus he ended his days. Xuan comments: "The Dao admits no further addition. Citing the cases of Jiyuan and Master Hu, it clarifies that emperors and kings should empty themselves of action, standing in the unfathomable, so that the world cannot discern their signs and thus awaken cunning. Its purport is subtle and boundless." The above five matters serve as proof.

The character "也" in the *Jishi* edition is written as "矣."

To be no master of fame, Cheng comments: "Master here means controller. To be no controller of fame and reputation."
To be no repository of schemes, no repository of plans and deliberations.
To be no bearer of tasks, Guo comments: "To entrust things so each bears its own charge."
To be no lord of knowledge. *Shiwen* notes: "知 here pronounced as *zhi* (wisdom)." Cheng comments: "Not to deploy wisdom in lording over things."

To embody the boundless, to fathom the true source and merge with the infinite.
To wander without trace, Cui comments: "朕 means sign." Cheng comments: "朕 means mark. Concealing one’s tracks and veiling one’s light, thus leaving no trace."

To fulfill what one receives from Heaven, yet without any appearance of attainment, to preserve wholly what one receives from Heaven without any sense of self-possession.
To be empty, and nothing more. Guo comments: "Without emptiness, one cannot bear the fullness of the multitude."

The mind of the perfected person functions like a mirror, Guo comments: "Reflecting things without emotion."
Neither sending off nor welcoming, responding yet not storing away, Cheng comments: "将 means to send off. Things stir and one responds, yet the response does not arise from the mind. Since there is neither sending off nor welcoming, how could there be any concealment of emotion?"
Thus one can overcome things without harm. Cheng comments: "The mind does not labor, and so suffers no injury."

This is the main text of the passage.

The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Realm was Hundun. Jianwen comments: "Shu and Hu take their names from divine swiftness; Hundun, from harmonious undifferentiation. Divine swiftness is a metaphor for action, while harmonious undifferentiation is a metaphor for non-action." Cui comments: "Hundun has no apertures." Shu and Hu would often meet in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu conspired to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying: "All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing, yet this one alone has none. Let us try to bore them for him." Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died. Guo comments: "To act is to ruin it." This is the allegorical meaning.

Su Yu notes: "The four chapters below *Knotted Toes* mostly expound the meaning of the *Laozi*. Though Zhuangzi delighted in the teachings of Laozi, his self-proclaimed aspirations were far loftier, as can be seen in the *Under Heaven* chapter. Beyond explicating Laozi, these four chapters contain no profound insights; they were likely composed by Zhuangzi’s followers, who used Laozi as their basis. Moreover, their style is straightforward and unelaborated, lacking the vast and unfathomable wonder of the Inner Chapters. Wang Fuzhi and Yao Nai both suspected that the Outer Chapters were not written by Zhuangzi, and this is most perceptive. For instance, this chapter begins by speaking of 'excess and perversion in the practice of benevolence and righteousness,' yet ends by placing 'excess and perversion' and 'benevolence and righteousness' on equal footing—its contradictions are glaring. It also states, 'I am ashamed before the Dao and its virtue,' but how could Zhuangzi ever have uttered such a humble phrase?"

Knotted toes and supernumerary fingers arise from nature, yet they exceed in virtue. Li comments: "Knotted means conjoined." Cheng comments: "The big toe is joined to the second toe; a supernumerary finger means the hand has six fingers." Cui comments: "Exceed means to go beyond." Note: Since they are present from birth, they are said to arise from nature. Virtue here means attainment. What one attains surpasses that of others. Excrescences and hanging wens arise from form, yet they exceed in nature. Excrescences and hanging wens appear in the *Great and Venerable Teacher* chapter. Since they attach after form is complete, they are said to arise from form, yet they go beyond natural nature. Those who employ benevolence and righteousness in manifold ways store them in the five viscera, yet this is not the proper alignment of the Dao and its virtue. Cheng comments: "Manifold ways refer to methods." Note: Those who apply many methods to practice benevolence and righteousness take the five constants (human nature) as shared by all people and arrange them in the five viscera, aligning them with the five phases, yet this is not the original state of the Dao and its virtue.

Thus, conjoined toes are merely useless flesh; supernumerary fingers are merely useless digits. *Shu* means to establish. Those who employ manifold methods to conjoin and branch the passions of the five viscera—passions here mean reality—exceed and pervert the practice of benevolence and righteousness. Exceed means to go beyond; perversion means deviation from the norm, hence it is called excess and perversion. And those who employ manifold methods in the use of hearing and sight.

Thus, those conjoined in brightness disrupt the five colors, indulge in ornate patterns, and dazzle with blue, yellow, embroidered, and brocaded splendor—is this not so? And this begins with Li Zhu and his like. This means it originates with people like Li Zhu.

"Cheng [Yun] states: 'An axe-shaped pattern is called *fu*; two *ji* characters back-to-back are called *fu*. The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. Blue and red form *wen*; red and white form *zhang*. *Huanghuang* describes a dazzling appearance.' Sima [Biao] states: 'Li Zhu was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time who could see the tip of an autumn hair at a hundred paces. Another account says he could see the point of a needle a thousand *li* away. *Mengzi* writes his name as Li Lou.' Those who exceed in hearing disrupt the five notes, indulge in the six pitch-pipes, and dazzle with the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo—are not the tones of *Huangzhong* and *Dalü* thus? And this begins with Shi Kuang.

*Shiwen* notes: 'Shi Kuang was a grandee of Jin, skilled in music and able to summon ghosts and spirits. *Shiji* records: "A native of Nanhe in Jizhou, born without eyes."' Guo [Xiang] states: 'Those born with ears and eyes are commonly troubled by their longing for the rare and their admiration for the distant. Thus, though Li Zhu and Shi Kuang were keen of sight and hearing, they ultimately brought chaos to the senses.'

Those who branch into benevolence pluck at virtue and obstruct nature to gather fame, causing the world to clamor like reeds and drums in service of laws they cannot attain—is this not so? And this begins with Zeng [zi] and Shi [Qiu]."

Those who "branch into benevolence" refer to those who elevate benevolence and righteousness as if an extra finger sprouts from the hand. Zeng and Shi were by nature inclined toward benevolence and righteousness, yet those whose nature is not so endowed vie to emulate them, causing the world to clamor like reeds and drums in service of laws they cannot attain. Zeng and Shi are Zeng Shen and Shi Qiu.

Wang Niansun notes: "塞 and 擢 are not of the same semantic category. 塞 should be 搴, a graphic error due to their similarity. Both 擢 and 搴 mean 'to pluck' or 'to seize.' The *Guangya* states: '搴 means to take or to pluck.' The *Fangyan* writes it as 攓, glossing it as 'to take,' and specifies that in southern Chu it is called 攓. The *Shuowen* writes it as ●, glossing it as 'to pluck.' The *Chuzhen* chapter of the *Huainanzi* states: 'The learning of the vulgar world plucks at virtue and seizes at nature, inwardly vexing the five viscera and outwardly exhausting the ears and eyes. Only then do they begin to summon spirits and shake the finest threads of things, wielding and brandishing benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, displaying their conduct and flaunting their wisdom before the world to clamor for fame and reputation.' It further states: 'Now, the myriad things come forth, plucking at our nature and seizing at our dispositions.' These are all evidence of this usage."

Those who are "paired in disputation" pile words like tiles and knot them like ropes, weaving phrases and roaming their minds among the debates of "hard and white" and "same and different," only to exhaust themselves in pursuit of fleeting reputations and useless speech—is this not so? And this begins with Yang and Mo.

Cui [Yuan] states: "They amass useless words like piling tiles or knotting ropes." Another version reads: "tiles" as "pellets." This refers to distorting and altering phrases, letting the mind wander among the debates of "hard and white" and "same and different." Guo Songtao notes: "敝 means exhaustion. 跬誉 is akin to 'footstep reputation.' A half-step is called a 跬. The *Simafa* states: 'Lifting one foot is called a 跬.' A 跬 is three feet. 跬誉 refers to seeking immediate, short-lived reputation. They exhaust themselves in pursuit of speech that brings fleeting reputation but no real use, hence they are called 'paired in disputation.' Yang Zhu and Mo Di were by nature contentious, so they are singled out here."

Thus, all these are paths of excessive pairing and branching, not the ultimate correctness of the world. That which is truly correct does not lose the genuine dispositions of its nature and destiny. Yu [Yue] notes: "The first 正 is likely a graphic error for 至."

Therefore, what is joined is not called "paired," and what is branched is not called "extended." The *Shiwen* notes: "跂 is read as qí." The *Xuan* edition writes it as "歧." Both 跂 and 歧 mean "to branch."

What is long is not called excessive, and what is short is not called deficient. Thus, though the teal’s legs are short, lengthening them would bring sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, cutting them would bring grief. Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "凫 refers to a small duck."

Thus, what is long by nature should not be cut, and what is short by nature should not be lengthened—there is nothing to remove and no sorrow to dispel. Xuan [Ying] notes: "Following one’s natural endowment, sorrow naturally vanishes—what need is there to remove it?"

Is it not that benevolence and righteousness run counter to human dispositions? Why then are those who embody benevolence so full of sorrow?

Su Yu notes: "‘Benevolent people’ in the *Xuan* edition is ‘benevolence and righteousness,’ which is correct. Guo Xiang’s commentary states: 'Those who fear that benevolence and righteousness run counter to human dispositions and thus worry about them can truly be called full of sorrow.' It seems his edition also read ‘benevolence and righteousness.’ This passage means that benevolence and righteousness bind people, causing them to lose their constant nature and be plagued by many sorrows. The *Zai You* chapter states: 'They vex their five viscera to fabricate benevolence and righteousness,' which expresses this idea. The error here stems from the following ‘benevolent people.’"

Moreover, those whose toes are "paired" weep when separated, and those whose hands are "branched" cry out when bitten. Whether there is excess in number or deficiency in number, their sorrow is the same. The paired are deficient in number, while the branched have excess in number.

Now, the benevolent of the world gaze anxiously at the world’s calamities and worry over its ills. Sima [Biao] notes: "蒿 means eyes in disarray." Yu [Yue] notes: "蒿 is a loan for ●. The *Yupian* states: '● means bright-eyed, or to gaze.' Thus, ● describes the appearance of gazing. The benevolent who worry over the world must gaze far into the distance, hence the term. ● and 蒿 are phonetically close, so they are interchangeable. In the *Book of Songs*, 'white birds gleaming' is written as '鹤鹤' in the *Mencius* and as '●●' in the *Wen Xuan*’s *Jingfu Palace Rhapsody*. The interchangeability of 蒿 with ● is like that of 翯 with 鹤 and ●."

The unbenevolent, however, breach the genuine dispositions of their nature and destiny to greedily pursue wealth and honor. 决 means to breach, like water bursting through a dam. 情 means reality. 饕 means greed.

Is it not that benevolence and righteousness run counter to human dispositions? Since the Three Dynasties and below, why has the world been so clamorous?

Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "嚣嚣 means noisy and clamorous."

Moreover, those who rely on hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to achieve correctness are whittling away their nature. Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Hooks for curves, cords for straightness, compasses for circles, and squares for rectangles—all harm one’s original nature."

Those who rely on cords, glue, and lacquer to achieve solidity are encroaching upon their virtue. Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "约 means to bind. This injures their virtue."

Bending and contorting with ritual and music, coaxing and nurturing with benevolence and righteousness to console the hearts of the world—this is to lose one’s constant nature. Ritual and music’s circumambulations are bending and contorting. 呴俞 is akin to "nurturing and cherishing," a feigned benevolence and righteousness.

The world has a constant nature. What is constant is that the curved do not rely on hooks, the straight do not rely on cords, the round do not rely on compasses, the square do not rely on squares, what is joined does not rely on glue and lacquer, and what is bound does not rely on ropes. The *Shiwen* notes: "The *Guangya* states: '纆 means rope.'"

Thus, the world is naturally guided into life, yet does not know how it comes to live. Xuan [Ying] notes: "诱然 suggests being led as if by something into life."

All alike attain it, yet know not how they attain it. Thus, past and present share one unchanging principle—it cannot be diminished. Past and present hold no dual principles; they cannot be impaired by human artifice.

Why then do benevolence and righteousness cling like glue, lacquer, ropes, and cords, weaving through the space of Dao and virtue? They only confuse the world!

"Clinging" describes their unbroken continuity. Here, Dao and virtue are exalted while benevolence and righteousness are rejected.

Minor delusion confuses direction, losing one’s bearings. Profound delusion alters one’s nature, forfeiting one’s true essence. How do we know this is so?

Ever since the House of Yu promoted benevolence and righteousness to disturb the world—*Yu* notes: "Promoted, meaning raised up"—the *Shiwen* glosses: "Disturbed, meaning disordered"—the world has rushed to obey their commands, hastening to follow. Has this not exchanged their nature for benevolence and righteousness? *Guo* comments: "Though the House of Yu did not intend to alter nature, the world’s nature was already transformed."

Let us examine this: from the Three Dynasties onward, the world has universally traded its nature for external things. The petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar sacrifices himself for fame—exchanging nature for name and gain. The grandee sacrifices himself for his family; the sage sacrifices himself for the world—exchanging nature for family and empire.

These several types—*Su* notes: "Several types, meaning these various kinds of people"—differ in their undertakings and their reputations, yet in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one.

Zang and Gu, two men herding sheep together, both lost their sheep. *Shiwen* notes: "*Zhang Yi* says: 'Zang refers to the son of a son-in-law and a maidservant.' *Cui’s* edition writes *Gu* as *●*, stating: 'A child is called *●*.'"

When asked what Zang was doing, he was found clutching bamboo slips and reading. When asked what Gu was doing, he was found gambling and playing games. Though their pursuits differed, their loss of sheep was the same. *Shiwen* notes: "*Ce* is also written as *策*. *Li* says: 'Bamboo slips.' *Sai* refers to games like dice." *Note*: *Ce* should be read as in *Zuozhuan*’s "Rao Chao bestowed a whip"—a herding whip.

Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain, while Robber Zhi died for profit atop Dongling. *Cheng* comments: "Zhi was the younger brother of Liuxia Hui, leading nine thousand followers as a notorious bandit. Dongling is a mountain name, also said to be Mount Tai, located in Qi Prefecture, fifteen *li* from Dongping, where Zhi met his end."

Though their deaths differed, in wasting life and harming nature, they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is wholly given to sacrifice.

Those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom; those who sacrifice for wealth and goods are called petty men. Their sacrifice is one, yet some are gentlemen, some petty men—*the "then" in "then there are" carries the sense of "and yet."*

If we consider the harm to life and nature, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. What then distinguishes gentleman from petty man? *Xuan* comments: "What justifies their differing names?"

Moreover, those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness, though as accomplished as Zengzi and Shishi, are not what I call good. Those who bind their nature to the five flavors, though as skilled as Yu’er, are not what I call good. *Shiwen* notes: "*Sima* says: 'Yu’er was an ancient expert in discerning flavors.' *Cui* says: '*Shizi* states: "The chef Yu’er seasoned food with ginger and cinnamon for the ruler’s table." *Huainanzi* says: "Yu’er and Di Ya could distinguish the waters of Zhi and Mian by taste." One account claims Yu’er lived in the time of the Yellow Emperor. Di Ya is Yi Ya, the flavor expert of Duke Huan of Qi. Another account says Yu’er was also from Qi.'"

Those who bind their nature to the five sounds, though as perceptive as Music Master Kuang, are not what I call keen-eared. Those who bind their nature to the five colors, though as sharp-sighted as Li Zhu, are not what I call clear-sighted.

What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness—*Xuan* comments: "This phrase may be a corrupted gloss on flavors."—but goodness in one’s inherent virtue alone. What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but following the true essence of one’s nature and fate.

What I call keen-eared is not hearing others, but hearing oneself. What I call clear-sighted is not seeing others, but seeing oneself. *Cheng* comments: "When the mind races and the ears and eyes are exhausted, this is foolishness and blindness—how can it be called keen or clear? If one listens to what the ear hears and sees what the eye sees, preserving one’s allotted nature and remaining unshaken by externals, then all things are keen and clear."

Those who do not see for themselves but see others, who do not attain for themselves but attain others—these attain others’ attainments but do not attain their own, follow others’ paths but do not follow their own. *Guo* comments: "These abandon themselves to imitate others. Though they may imitate others perfectly, they have already lost themselves."

Those who follow others’ paths but do not follow their own—whether Robber Zhi or Boyi—are equally perverse and excessive. *Guo* comments: "If we take the loss of nature as perverse excess, though their paths of loss differ, their loss is one."

*Note*: In the *Da Zongshi* chapter, it says: "Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xu Yu, Ji Ta, Shentu Di—these served others’ service, followed others’ paths, and did not follow their own." Zhuangzi prized preserving life above all, so he deeply disapproved of figures like Boyi. As for Wu Guang, Shentu Di, and others, their circumstances are unclear, but in their time, they may have had ways to avoid death.

The weight of Boyi, Shuqi, and Jizi’s circumstances is too great to be lumped together indiscriminately. Their vision differs from that of the sages. I am ashamed before the Dao and virtue—*Xuan* comments: "A humble phrase."—thus above, I dare not adopt the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not engage in perverse excess. *Xuan* comments: "Zhuangzi treats benevolence, righteousness, and perverse excess as parallel categories—how can there be a distinction of 'above' and 'below'? These terms, 'above' and 'below,' are used here from the perspective of conventional views."

*Note*: Since the Three Dynasties, the Dao and virtue have been held in the highest esteem, while discussions of benevolence and righteousness have lacked precision. Han Feizi conflated righteousness with benevolence, and this passage likewise subsumes benevolence and righteousness under the category of "benevolent men." Outside the works of Confucius and Mencius, few have been able to discern the distinction between benevolence and righteousness. Zhuangzi of Qiyuan (Lacquer Garden) surely had a subtle point here, yet later Confucians no longer sought it deeply. Han Yu’s *Yuan Dao* opens by explicitly listing the four terms "benevolence," "righteousness," "Dao," and "virtue," guiding scholars in a way that enabled them to transcend the worthies of the Tang and align with the ancient sages.

**Chapter 9: "Horse’s Hooves" (External Chapters)**

*Su Yu* comments: "Laozi says, *'Through non-action, things transform themselves; through clarity and stillness, they rectify themselves.'* This entire chapter expounds this principle, culminating in the extended metaphor of the horse—a device not found in Zhuangzi’s Inner Chapters."

Horses’ hooves can tread upon frost and snow; their coats can ward off wind and cold. They graze on grass and drink from streams, lifting their tails to leap. *Annotation*: "Cui’s edition reads *wei* (tail) for *zu* (feet). Sima Biao comments: *'Lu* means to leap; in character dictionaries, it is written as ●. *Lu* signifies a horse’s vigor.'" *Guo Qingfan* comments: "Cui’s edition reads *wei* (tail). The *Wen Xuan*’s *Jiang Fu* commentary also reads *wei*, with *lu* written as 陆, glossed as sounding like *liu*. The *Guangyun* states: *'Lu*, *li zhu* cut, means to prance.'" This is the true nature of horses.

Though there be grand pavilions and stately halls, they are of no use to them. Even the most magnificent dwellings are not what horses’ nature finds fitting. *Annotation*: "*Yi* is pronounced like *yi* (仪) by Xu. *Lu* means 'correct' or 'grand.' Cui comments: *'Luqin* refers to the main hall.'" *Yu* comments: "*Yi* and *yi* (仪) are interchangeable. *Yitai* means 'reception terrace.' The *Huainanzi*’s *Lanming* chapter states, *'The reception terrace trembled and collapsed,'* with Gao You’s note: *'The reception terrace is a terrace for ritual deportment.'"*

Yet when Bo Le arrives, he declares, "I am skilled in managing horses." He brands them, trims them, carves them, and sears them with marks. *Annotation*: "Bo Le, surnamed Sun, named Yang, was skilled in driving horses. Sima Biao comments: *'Shao* means to cauterize with hot iron. *Ti* means to shear their hair.'" *Guo Songtao* comments: "*Luo* is the same as *lao* (烙), meaning to brand." He binds them with reins and fetters, confines them to blackened stables, and arranges them on wooden racks. *Annotation*: "The *Guangya* states: *'Ji* means bridle.' *Zhi* is pronounced *ding yi*. Cui comments: *'Zhi* means to hobble the front and back legs.'" The *Wen Xuan*’s *Dirge for Ma Qian Du* commentary cites Sima Biao: *"Zao* means stable." *Zhan* refers to a lattice bed, used on damp ground." Of the horses, twelve or thirteen out of every hundred die.

He starves them and parches them, races them and gallops them, aligns them and orders them. Ahead, they face the peril of bit-ornaments; behind, the threat of whips and goads. By this point, more than half the horses have died. Sima Biao comments: "*Jue* means bit; *shi* refers to adornments on the horse’s bit." *Cheng* comments: "A whip is covered in leather; a goad is not."

The potter says, "I am skilled in working clay. The round fits the compass; the square fits the carpenter’s square." *Annotation*: "*Tao* means 'to shape.' Cui comments: *'Zhi* means earth.'" The carpenter says, "I am skilled in working wood. The curved fits the hook; the straight aligns with the inked line." Yet do clay and wood’s natures desire to conform to compasses, squares, hooks, and lines? Still, generation after generation, people praise them, saying, "Bo Le is skilled in managing horses, and the potter and carpenter are skilled in working clay and wood." This is also the error of those who govern the world—their mistake is equal to that of governing the world.

In my view, those who are truly skilled in governing the world do not act thus. The people possess an enduring nature: they weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves—this is called "shared virtue." *Cheng* comments: "Each thing is self-sufficient, hence 'shared virtue.'" Unified and impartial, it is called "Heaven’s release." *Cheng* comments: "*Dang* means partiality. *Ming* means to name. *Tian* means natural." *Xuan* comments: "Undivided and unbiased, following Heaven’s spontaneity." *Su Yu* comments: "To be one with Heaven and dissolve the partiality of good and evil also conveys the meaning."

Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their movements were steady and unhurried; their gazes were fixed and unwavering. Cui comments: "*Tian tian* means heavy and slow. *Dian dian* means single-minded." At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels; marshes had no boats or bridges. *Cheng* comments: "*Qi* means path; *sui* means road." Guo comments: "Not seeking what lies beyond, they were content within their own households." The myriad things thrived in flocks, connected to their native lands. *Xuan* comments: "Each settled in their place, forming connections." Birds and beasts gathered in herds; grasses and trees grew to fullness. Guo comments: "Fulfilling their natures and stopping there, without desires to devour or destroy, thus all things were whole."

Thus, birds and beasts could be led by tethers and roam freely; the nests of crows and magpies could be climbed to peer inside. Guo comments: "Harmonious with things, thus creatures were tame." In the age of utmost virtue, people dwelled alongside birds and beasts, gathered together with the myriad things. *Zu*, meaning to gather. How could one distinguish between noble and base? Alike in lacking knowledge, their virtue did not depart; alike in lacking desire, they were called "plain and uncarved." Plain and uncarved, and the people’s nature was preserved. Guo comments: "Knowledge departs from the Dao by seeking goodness; desire departs from nature by seeking adornment."

When it came to the sage-kings, they hobbled and strained for benevolence, stretched and strained for righteousness, and the world first fell into doubt. Li comments: "Hobbling and straining, stretching and straining—both describe the labored effort to enact benevolence and righteousness." They indulged in extravagance for music, picked and parsed for ritual, and the world first became divided. Li comments: "Extravagance means unbridled excess." Guo Songtao notes: "‘Picked and parsed’ should read ‘picked and split.’ Wang’s commentary on the *Chu Ci* states: ‘Split means to divide.’ Picking is to select; splitting is to dissect—referring to the burdensome and fragmented." Thus, if unhewn simplicity were not marred, who would fashion the sacrificial goblet? If flawless white jade were not shattered, who would carve the ritual tablets? Cheng comments: "Unhewn simplicity means the whole wood before carving. The sacrificial goblet is a wine vessel, carved with an ox’s head, used in ancestral temple rites. A tablet with a pointed top and square base is called a *gui*; half a *gui* is called a *zhang*." If the Dao and virtue were not abandoned, why adopt benevolence and righteousness? Laozi says: "When the great Dao is abandoned, there arise benevolence and righteousness." If nature and feeling were not estranged, why employ ritual and music? Cheng comments: "Ritual restrains conduct; music harmonizes the heart. If feelings were not scattered, why harmonize the heart? If nature were not estranged, why restrain conduct?" If the five colors were not disordered, who would devise patterned adornments? If the five tones were not confused, who would attune them to the six pitch-pipes? Guo comments: "All these transform simplicity into ornament, abandon the root to exalt the branch, and thus mar and waste their natural purity." To mar simplicity to make vessels is the fault of the craftsman; to destroy the Dao and virtue for benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage. Cheng comments: "To ruin the Dao of non-action with the traces of benevolence and righteousness."

As for the horse, dwelling on land, it eats grass and drinks water; when pleased, it rubs necks together; when angry, it turns its back and kicks. Xuan comments: "A horse’s kick is always backward, hence it is said to turn its back." The horse’s knowledge extends no further than this.

Li's interpretation of *zhi* as "wisdom" is mistaken.

When a crossbar is added to the yoke—*heng* being the horizontal beam at the front of the carriage to which the yoke is bound, and *e* the fork that clasps the horse’s neck—when it is adorned with crescent-shaped ornaments—*yue ti* being the moon-shaped plate on the horse’s forehead—and the horse knows how to glare defiantly, twist its neck against the yoke, thrust and butt, cast off the bit, and steal the bridle—*jie ni* meaning to glare; *yin* meaning to bend; *zhi* meaning to butt; *man* meaning to thrust—twisting its neck against the yoke to thrust and butt, spitting out the bit and slipping the bridle—then the horse’s knowledge and postures reach the point of theft. This is the result of expanding its knowledge to the point where its postures become thieving. It is the fault of Bo Le.

In the age of the Lord of Hexu, people dwelt without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go, filled their mouths with food and played, drummed their bellies and wandered. This was all the people were capable of. *Hexu* was an ancient sage-king. *Xi* is interchangeable with *xi* (play). *Yi* and *yi* (already) are used interchangeably.

But when the sages came, they bent and shaped ritual and music to correct the forms of the world, and elevated benevolence and righteousness to console the hearts of the world—*kuang* meaning to correct; *xuan qi* meaning to raise and aspire to, so that people would all admire them. And so the people began to strut and strain with cunning, striving for knowledge and practicing deceit, competing for profit without cease. This, too, is the fault of the sages.

In the *Outer Chapters*, "Opening Trunks":

To guard against thieves who pry open trunks, pick pockets, and break into chests—*qu qie* meaning to open from the side—one must bind them tightly with cords, fasten them securely with locks and bolts. This is what the world calls wisdom. *The* Guangya *says: "Jian* and *teng* are both ropes." Li says: "*Jiong* means a latch; *jue* means a bolt." *Zhi* is pronounced as "wisdom."

Yet when the great thief comes, he shoulders the chest, lifts the trunk, carries the sack, and flees, only fearing that the cords, locks, and bolts are not secure enough. Thus, what the world once called wisdom is nothing but the accumulation of goods for the great thief. *Ye* is interchangeable with *ye* (final particle).

Let us consider this: Is there anything the world calls wisdom that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there anything it calls sageliness that does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?

In ancient times, the state of Qi had villages so close they could see one another, and the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard across them. The nets and traps spread, the plows and hoes pierced the earth, covering over two thousand *li* in all directions. Within its four borders, wherever ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain were established, wherever cities, hamlets, districts, villages, and neighborhoods were governed, was there ever a place that did not follow the models of the sages? *The* Art of War *of Sima* says: "Six *chi* make a *bu*, a hundred *bu* make a *mu*, a hundred *mu* make a *fu*, three *fu* make a *wu*, four *wu* make a *yi*." It also says: "Five households make a *bi*, five *bi* make a *lü*, five *lü* make a *zu*, five *zu* make a *dang*, five *dang* make a *zhou*, five *zhou* make a *xiang*." Zheng Xuan says: "Twenty-five households make a *lü*, two thousand five hundred households make a *zhou*, twelve thousand five hundred households make a *xiang*."

Yet Tian Chengzi killed the ruler of Qi in a single day and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also stole the sagely laws of wisdom along with it. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief and usurper, yet lived in the security of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not condemn him, and great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, his line held Qi. *From the time Chen Heng assassinated Duke Jian to the day Zhuangzi wrote this, the descendants who ruled Qi had already passed through twelve generations.* Yao says: "From Tian Chang to King Jian, ten generations, including Wuzi of Huan and Qi of Li, make twelve generations. The Tian clan first grew powerful under Wuzi, hence the count includes twelve generations."

Is this not stealing the state of Qi and, along with it, the sagely laws of wisdom to guard his thieving self?

Let us consider this: Is there anything the world calls supreme wisdom that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there anything it calls supreme sageliness that does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?

Once, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart—*Cui [Yuan] notes: "Read as *tuō*; some write it as 施. 胣 means 'to rend.'" The *Huainanzi* says: "Chang Hong was hacked to pieces and died."*—and Wu Zixu was pulped—*the *Shiwen* reads: "Mǐchí, in the *fanqie* system. Cui [Yuan] notes: 'Dissolved in the river.'"*—so that these four worthies, despite their virtue, could not escape execution.

Guo [Xiang] says: "This shows that even violent and chaotic rulers could wield the authority of a sovereign to execute the worthy, and none dared resist—all because of the sagely laws. Without such sagely laws, how could Jie and Zhou have maintained their thrones to unleash their poison, making the world shudder in fear?"

Su Yu says: "Sagely laws reside in punishments and rewards, yet Jie and Zhou used them to execute the worthy."

Thus, the followers of Robber Zhi asked him: "Does theft also have its Dao?" Zhi replied: "Where could there be no Dao? To divine the treasures hidden in a chamber—*Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "To conceive a reckless thought, weigh and measure, and invariably guess correctly."*—is sageliness. To enter first is courage. To exit last is righteousness. To know what is permissible is wisdom. To divide equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief."

From this we see: the good cannot stand without the Dao of the sage, nor can Zhi act without the Dao of the sage. Since the world has few good people and many who are not, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight, while his harm is great. Thus it is said:

"When the lips are exhausted, the teeth grow cold." *Yu [Yan] notes: "This 'exhausted' should be read as in 'exhausting its tail.' The *Shuowen* says beneath 'swine': 'It exhausts its tail, hence it is called swine.' 'Lips exhausted' means to curl them upward."* "When Lu’s wine was thin, Handan was besieged." *Shiwen* [notes]: *Xu Shen’s* commentary on the *Huainanzi* states: "When Chu assembled the feudal lords, Lu and Zhao both presented wine to the King of Chu. Lu’s wine was thin, while Zhao’s was rich. The Chu official in charge of wine sought wine from Zhao, but Zhao refused. Enraged, the official exchanged Zhao’s rich wine for Lu’s thin wine and presented it. The King of Chu, deeming Zhao’s wine thin, thus besieged Handan." "When the sage is born, great thieves arise."

Smash the sages, release the bandits, and the world will begin to be ordered. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. Once the sage is dead, great thieves will not rise, and the world will be at peace without incident. While the sage lives, great thieves will not cease. Though one may exalt the sage to govern the world, this is but to amplify the profit of Robber Zhi. When pecks and bushels are made to measure, they are stolen along with the grain; when scales and balances are made to weigh, they are stolen along with the goods; when tallies and seals are made to authenticate, they are stolen along with the authority; when benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, they are stolen along with the virtues. How do we know this is so? Those who steal hooks are executed—*Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Hooks for waist belts."*—while those who steal states become feudal lords. At the gates of feudal lords, benevolence and righteousness abide—*Wang [Yinzhi] notes: "'Abide' should read 'abide therein.' 'Therein' means 'in this.' The phrase means benevolence and righteousness exist in this. Ancient texts often use this syntax. (Examples omitted.) Here, 'executed' and 'lords' rhyme, as do 'gates' and 'abide,' with all rhymes at the line-ends. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in its 'Biographies of Wandering Knights,' reads: 'Those who steal hooks are executed; those who steal states become lords. At the gates of lords, benevolence and righteousness abide,' which clearly demonstrates this."*—is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom?

Thus, those who pursue great thieves, who exalt themselves as feudal lords, who steal the benefits of benevolence and righteousness along with pecks, bushels, scales, balances, tallies, and seals—though offered the rewards of high office, they cannot be encouraged to stop; though threatened with the axe and halberd, they cannot be restrained. That such amplified profit for Robber Zhi cannot be forbidden is the fault of the sage. Thus it is said: "Fish cannot be removed from the deep; the state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others." Those sages are the state’s sharp instruments, not what should be displayed to the world. *Display means to show.*

Therefore, sever sageliness and discard wisdom, and great thieves will cease; cast away jade and shatter pearls—*Shiwen* [notes]: "Cast away, meaning the same as 'throw.'"*—and petty thieves will not rise. Burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; smash pecks and snap balances, and the people will not contend. Exhaust and destroy the world’s sagely laws, and only then can one discuss matters with the people. *Shiwen* [notes]: "Exhaust means to deplete."* Throw the six pitch-pipes into disorder and burn the zithers and sevens—*Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Throw means to pluck."* *Shiwen* [notes]: "Burn means to sever by fire."*—stop up the ears of Music-Master Kuang, and the world will begin to retain its hearing; obliterate patterns and scatter the five colors, glue shut the eyes of Li Zhu, and the world will begin to retain its sight; destroy and abandon hooks and cords, discard compasses and squares, break the fingers of the artisan Chui—*Li [Yi] notes: "Break means to snap."*—and the world will begin to possess its own skill. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Each person’s innate capacity contains its own skill. It is like spiders weaving webs or dung beetles rolling balls—what need is there for artisans?"* Thus it is said: "Great skill appears clumsy."

Sever the conduct of Zeng [Can] and Shi [Qiu], silence the mouths of Yang [Zhu] and Mo [Di], cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will begin to merge in profound unity. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "When things do not lose their true nature, all people attain self-possession, follow their nature, and fulfill principle—thus they blend with the profound Dao."*

When people retain their sight, the world will not be dazzled; when they retain their hearing, the world will not be burdened—*Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Burdened means afflicted with cares."*—when they retain their wisdom, the world will not be deluded; when they retain their virtue, the world will not be perverse. Those like Zeng [Can], Shi [Qiu], Yang [Zhu], Mo [Di], Music-Master Kuang, the artisan Chui, and Li Zhu all externally establish their virtues, flaunting their attainments to dazzle and confuse the world—*Shiwen* [notes]: "The *Three Cang* says: 'Dazzle means the dissipation of firelight.'"*—they are of no use to the law. *Xuan [Ying] notes: "In terms of proper governance, all should be discarded."*

Do you alone not know of the age of utmost virtue?

Once, there were Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilü, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong—*Sima [Biao] notes: "These twelve were all ancient sage-kings."* In their time, people knotted cords to keep records. They savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight, the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs carried between them, yet people lived to old age and death without ever visiting one another. In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved.

Now, however, people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, "In such-and-such a place there is a worthy!" They bundle their provisions and rush toward him—*Cui [Zhuan] notes: "Bundle means to wrap."*—thus abandoning their kin at home and forsaking their lords’ affairs abroad. Abandoning kin is like Wu Qi; forsaking one’s lord is like Yu Qing. Footprints crisscross the borders of the feudal lords, and carriage tracks intertwine a thousand *li* away—*the tracks are the ruts of wheels; intertwine means to intersect.* This is the fault of those above who favor cunning. If those above truly favor cunning but lack the Way, favoring cunning to disturb things while lacking the Way to pacify them, then the world will fall into great chaos.

How do we know this is so? When the knowledge of bows, crossbows, nets, snares, and mechanical traps abounds, birds are thrown into chaos above. *Li [Yi] notes: "A net for hares is called a *bi*; a weighted arrow is called a *yi*; the trigger of a crossbow is called a *ji*."* *Guo Songtao notes: "The *Shuowen* says: '*Shuai* is a net for catching birds.' The *Book of Songs* says: 'With nets and snares they catch them.' Bird traps are also called *bi*. Li’s explanation is incorrect."* When the knowledge of hooks, bait, dragnets, seines, weirs, and fish traps multiplies, fish are thrown into chaos in the waters. *Wang Niansun notes: "Hook should be *diao* (fishing hook), for *diao* is the same as hook. The *Shiwen* says: '*Diao* means hook.' The present text writes *gou* (hook), which was mistakenly altered by later hands."* *For details, see *Dushu Zazhi*.* When the knowledge of fences, snares, nets, and traps proliferates, beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes. *Li [Yi] notes: "Fences are used to set up nets."* *Guo Songtao notes: "The *Shuowen Jizhuan* says: 'Long branches are called *ge*.' Fences are scraped and shaped. Fences and snares are all used to intercept and entrap birds and beasts. The *Han Shu* in the biography of Chao Cuo says: 'To make a central enclosure with tiger traps,' and the Yan commentary says: 'This means to enclose them.'"* *The *Shiwen* says: "*Ju* is also written as *fu*. The *Erya* says: 'A rabbit net is called *ju*; a *zhuo* is called *fu*. *Fu* is a covered cart.' Guo Pu says: 'It is today’s overturned cart.'"* When the transformations of cunning deceit, gradual poison, crafty glibness, the obstinacy of "hard and white," the sophistry of "dissolving dirt," and the distinctions of "same and different" multiply, customs are bewildered by disputation. *Guo Qingfan notes: "In the *Xunzi*, the *Fei Shier Zi* chapter says: 'Cunning and dangerous,' the *Yi Bing* chapter says: 'This is gradual corruption,' and the *Zheng Lun* chapter says: 'When those above are treacherous and dangerous, those below gradually become deceitful.' The four characters 'cunning deceit gradual poison' share the same meaning, all referring to fraud."* *The *Shiwen* says: "Crafty glibness refers to improper speech; sophistry refers to devious words."* *Note: Crafty is a loan character for cunning.*

Thus, the world repeatedly falls into great chaos—*Li [Yi] notes: "Repeatedly means as if in darkness."*—and the fault lies in the love of cunning. Therefore, the world all knows to seek what it does not know but does not know to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it does not consider good but does not know to condemn what it already considers good. This is why great chaos arises. Thus, above, it confounds the brightness of the sun and moon; below, it melts the essence of mountains and rivers; and in between, it undermines the operations of the four seasons—*Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Melts means to dissolve; undermines means to ruin."* Wriggling creatures—*the *Shiwen* says: "Wriggling refers to legless creatures"*—and fluttering things—*Li [Yi] notes: "Things that fly lightly"*—none fail to lose their nature.

How severe is the chaos brought to the world by the love of cunning! This has been the case since the Three Dynasties and after. They abandon the steadfast people and delight in the toiling flatterers—*Li [Yi] notes: "Steadfast describes a cautious and sincere appearance; toiling describes a sly and cunning appearance."* They forsake the tranquil and effortless and delight in the ceaseless chatter—*ceaseless chatter has already thrown the world into chaos.* *Guo [Xiang] notes: "Ceaseless chatter means teaching others with one’s own views."*

**Chapter 11: "Letting Be and Indulgence"**

I have heard of letting the world be and indulging it, but never of governing it. *The *Wen Xuan*, in the commentary to Xie Lingyun’s poem "From Duke Song at the Horse-Racing Platform," cites Sima [Biao] as saying: "Letting be means to examine; indulging means to be lenient."* *Su Yu notes: "Letting be should not be glossed as examining, for examining is already governing. Letting be means to preserve. To preserve in the heart without revealing traces of approval or disapproval, allowing people to live in harmony with their uncarved nature, is the essence of the 'Sealed Casket' chapter."*

Letting be means fearing that the world will overindulge its nature; indulging means fearing that the world will alter its virtue—*altering leads to other imitations.* If the world does not overindulge its nature or alter its virtue, is there any need to govern it? *Guo [Xiang] notes: "What further need is there for governance?"*

In the past, when Yao governed the world, he made the world joyful, each delighting in their nature—this was not tranquility. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Tranquility means stillness."* When Jie governed the world, he made the world weary, each suffering in their nature—this was not pleasure. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Pleasure means joy."* Neither tranquility nor pleasure is virtue. That which is not virtue yet can endure for long—there is nothing like this under heaven.

If people are greatly joyful, they harm the yang; if greatly angry, they harm the yin. *Yu [Yue] notes: "Joy pertains to yang; anger pertains to yin. Harming yang and harming yin means injuring the harmony of yin and yang."*

The *Huainanzi’s* "Original Dao Training" states, *"Great anger shatters the yin; great joy collapses the yang,"* which conveys the same meaning. When both yin and yang are harmed, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat cannot form—does this not then injure the human form? *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "When people suffer many illnesses, is this not the injury to the form returning upon itself?"*

When people’s joy and anger lose their proper place, their dwellings lack constancy, their thoughts and reflections find no fulfillment, and the Dao of the center cannot take shape—only then does the world begin to grow restless and perverse, haughty and fierce. *Cui [Zhuan] notes: "Restless and perverse means the mind is unbalanced; haughty and fierce means conduct is unbalanced."* And only thereafter do the ways of Robber Zhi, Zeng [zi], and Shi [Qiu] arise.

Thus, even if the whole world were mobilized to reward the good, it would not suffice; even if the whole world were mobilized to punish the evil, it would not be enough. *Guo [Xiang] notes: "Those who emulate goodness do so for reward, so rewards cannot meet the demand; those who cease evil do so from fear of punishment, so punishments cannot overcome it."* Therefore, the vastness of the world is still insufficient for rewards and punishments.

From the Three Dynasties onward, the world has been in ceaseless clamor, forever occupied with rewards and punishments—how could it have had leisure to settle the true nature of life? *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Clamor means uproar."*

Moreover, delighting in clarity is an excess of form; delighting in keen hearing is an excess of sound. *Note: "Delighting in sound" is the same as above.* Delighting in benevolence is disorder in virtue; delighting in righteousness is perversion of principle; delighting in ritual is mutual assistance in artifice; delighting in music is mutual assistance in excess. *Annotation: "Mutual assistance" means to aid.* *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Delighting in ritual aids superficial and ostentatious skills; delighting in music further aids the excess of musical tones."* *Wang Fuzhi notes: "To follow alongside and lose oneself is called mutual assistance."*

Delighting in sageliness is mutual assistance in arts; delighting in knowledge is mutual assistance in flaws. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "Delighting in the traces of sages aids the arts of the world; loving clever schemes exacerbates the flaws of right and wrong."*

If the world is to settle the true nature of life, these eight may either exist or vanish—it matters not. But if the world cannot settle the true nature of life, then these eight begin to coil and crumple, to snatch and scramble, throwing the world into chaos. *Sima [Biao] notes: "Coil and crumple describes a state of not being stretched out."* *Cui’s edition reads "戕" (slaughter) instead of "獊," noting: "Slaughter and scramble means to plunder and seize."*

Yet the world still venerates and cherishes them—how deeply deluded the world has become! Is it merely a matter of passing them by and leaving them behind?

"Xuan [Yin] notes: 'Is it merely a matter of passing them by when their time has come and leaving them behind?' Rather, the world fasts and purifies itself to speak of them, kneels in reverence to present them, drums and sings to dance in their honor. *Xuan [Yin] notes: 'Thus, generation after generation delights in offering them, unable to cease.'* What then can I do about it?

Therefore, when a noble person is compelled to govern the world, there is nothing better than non-action. Through non-action, the true nature of life finds peace. Thus, one who values their own person above governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their own person above governing the world may be charged with the world. *Xuan [Yin] notes: 'Valuing and cherishing one’s own person in governing the world means holding the inner as weighty and regarding the outer as light—this is why one who practices non-action in the world may become its ruler.'* *Su Yu notes: 'The two instances of "于" after "身" are likely superfluous. These four lines appear in the *Laozi*.'*

Therefore, if a noble person can refrain from loosening their five viscera—*Guo Xiang notes: 'Loosening means dispersing.'* *See the 'Webbed Toes' chapter: 'Those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness and apply them are arrayed among the five viscera.'*—and from flaunting their intelligence—*Zhuo means to pull out, that is, to display and elevate it, speaking of boasting in one’s own intelligence*—abiding in stillness like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon, profound in silence yet resounding like thunder, unmoving yet spirit-like, wordless yet renowned, then when their spirit moves, Heaven follows. When the spirit first stirs, the celestial mechanism naturally responds. Acting with effortless non-action, the myriad things rise and accumulate like steam. *Sima [Biao] notes: 'Rising and accumulating, like things being steamed and cooked.'* *Xiang [Xiu] and Guo [Xiang] note: 'Like dust motes moving of themselves.'* *See how the warmth of spring causes the myriad things to layer and ripen like steamed grain.* What leisure then do I have to govern the world?

Cui Qu asked Lao Dan: 'If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?' *The character '藏' is a miswriting of '臧,' as the ancient character was only '臧.' To settle the human heart means there is no way for it to be good.* Lao Dan replied: 'Take care not to agitate the human heart. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: 'To agitate and disturb the human heart.'* The human heart presses downward and advances upward. *Xuan [Yin] notes: 'When pressed, it descends; when advanced, it ascends.'* Between ascent and descent, it is bound like a prisoner and harmed like a slaughter. *Xuan [Yin] notes: 'Between ascent and descent, it is constrained like a prisoner and injured like a killing.'* *Su Yu notes: 'Its ascent is like killing, its descent like imprisonment. Killing leads to arrogance, imprisonment to rebellion.'* It is yielding and soft yet stronger than the hard and firm. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: 'Yielding and soft means weak and pliant.'* *Guo [Xiang] notes: 'If it can be yielding and soft, then the hard and firm will be softened.'* Sharp and keen, carved and polished, its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice. In the swiftness of a single bow and rise, it reaches beyond the four seas. *Reaching means governing; this illustrates its swiftness.* Its abode is deep and still, *Xuan [Yin] notes: 'Speaking of its profound seclusion.'* its movement soars and celestial. *Xuan [Yin] notes: 'Speaking of its soaring flight.'* Reckless and arrogant, it cannot be restrained—is this not the human heart?

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Then Yao and Shun wore away the flesh of their thighs and the hair of their shins to nourish the forms of the world. *Li [Yi] notes: '胈 refers to the white flesh [of the thigh].'* They wearied their five viscera for benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and qi to model laws and standards. *Guo Qingfan notes: '*Shi Yan* states: "矜 means suffering." Straining their blood and qi is like Mencius’ saying "toil their minds."'* Yet still, they could not prevail. Thus, Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei, and sent Gong Gong to Youdu—was this not failing to overcome the world?

By the time of the Three Kings, the world was greatly alarmed. *Xuan [Yin] notes: 'Unable to rest in their true nature.'* Below were Jie and Zhi, above were Zeng [zi] and Shi; *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: 'Jie and Zhi practiced the conduct of petty men below, while Zeng and Shi practiced the conduct of noble men above.'* and the Confucians and Mohists all arose. *Arising simultaneously.* Then joy and anger suspected one another, the foolish and wise deceived one another, the good and bad slandered one another, the absurd and truthful mocked one another, and the world declined. *Great virtue was no longer the same; the root of virtue is profoundly unified, yet here its traces diverged.* The true nature of life scattered and dissolved. *Cheng [Xuanying] notes: 'Scattered and dissolved means disordered.'* The world pursued knowledge, and the common people were exhausted in their seeking. *Those above exhausted their intelligence, and the common people could not meet their demands.*"

Thus, axes and saws were applied, inked cords cut, and mallets and chisels split. *Carpenters use inked cords to straighten wood, just as rulers use ritual and law to correct people; carpenters use axes, saws, mallets, and chisels to mar wood, just as rulers use punishments to mar people.* The world became utterly disordered, *where "utterly disordered" means people harmed one another relentlessly.* The fault lay in disturbing the human heart.

Therefore, the worthy took refuge beneath the towering cliffs of great mountains, *Yu Yue notes: "嵁 should be 湛, meaning 'deep.' The mountains are described as great, the cliffs as deep."* while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with fear in their ancestral halls. In this age, those executed by decapitation lie heaped upon one another, those in cangues and stocks press close together, and those subjected to punishment and execution stretch as far as the eye can see. *Guangya states: "殊 means 'to sever.'" Cui notes: "桁杨 refers to devices that restrain the neck and shins."* "Lie heaped" refers to the dead; "press close" and "stretch as far as the eye can see" describe their multitude. Yet the Confucians and Mohists now begin to stand on tiptoe and wave their arms amidst the fetters and shackles. Alas! What a lamentable sight.

How extreme it is! How utterly shameless and devoid of shame they are! I know not whether sagely wisdom is not in truth the wedges and clamps of the cangue, *Sima Biao notes: "椄槢 refers to the pegs and blocks of restraint devices."* or whether benevolence and righteousness are not in truth the fetters and shackles with their mortise and tenon. *Cheng Xuanying notes: "凿 means 'hole.' To insert an object into a hole is called 枘."* The cangue employs wedges and clamps as its mechanism; fetters and shackles rely on mortise and tenon for their function. How can one know that Zeng [Can] and Shi [Qiu] are not the whistling arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi? *Xiang Xiu notes: "嚆矢 refers to arrows that whistle in flight."* The *Zilin* states: "嚆 means 'a great cry.'" Guo Xiang notes: "This says that Zeng and Shi are the tools of Jie and Robber Zhi."* Thus it is said: "Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered."

The Yellow Emperor, having ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, with his decrees enforced throughout the realm, heard that Master Guangcheng dwelled on Mount Kongtong. *The *Shiwen* notes: "Master Guangcheng—some say he is Laozi. The *Erya* states: 'The region north of the Dipper’s handle is called Kongtong.'" He therefore went to see him and said: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the utmost Dao? I wish to draw forth the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people." *Cheng Xuanying notes: "He wished to draw the essential qi of yin and yang to assist the growth of the five grains."* "I further wish to regulate yin and yang to bring all living things to fulfillment." *Cheng Xuanying notes: "He wished to model himself on yin and yang, establishing offices and dividing duties. 遂 means 'to follow.'" "How might this be done?"

Master Guangcheng replied: "What you wish to ask concerns the substance of things; *Cheng Xuanying notes: "而 means 'you.' The same below. What you ask is shallow, no more than form and substance."* what you wish to regulate is the dregs of things." *Xuan Ying notes: "This is to say, the remnants after the uncarved block has been dispersed."* "Since you have governed the world in this way, clouds do not gather before raining, *Sima Biao notes: "族 means 'to gather.' Rain falls before gathering, meaning the moisture is scant."* plants and trees do not yellow before falling, *Sima Biao notes: "This indicates an excess of killing qi."* and the light of the sun and moon grows ever more dim." *Xuan Ying notes: "The qi of Heaven and Earth is withering to this degree."* "As for the mean and cramped heart of a flatterer—how could one speak to you of the utmost Dao?" *Cheng Xuanying notes: "You are a sycophantic man with a narrow and petty heart."* *Li Yi notes: "翦翦 describes something shallow and limited."* *Note: 翦 is interchangeable with 谫.*

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass to demonstrate purity, and lived in seclusion for three months. Then he went again to seek an audience. *邀 means 'to request.'* Master Guangcheng lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from downwind, crawling on his knees, bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and asked: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: how should one cultivate the body to attain longevity?"

Master Guangcheng rose abruptly—*蹶然 describes a swift rising*—and said: "Excellent, this question! Come!"

"I shall speak to you of the utmost Dao. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not disturb your essence, and you may attain longevity."

*Xuan comments: "This speaks of calming the external to nurture the internal."*

Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing—then your spirit will guard your form, and your form will attain long life. Guard your inner self, cut off thoughts and cares. Seal your outer self, cease all movement and action. Excessive knowledge brings ruin."

*Xuan comments: "When inner and outer draw upon each other, the malady lies in knowledge—thus I summarize it."*

"I shall lead you to the heights of Great Clarity, to the source of utmost yang. I shall guide you through the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin. *Sui* means 'to reach directly.' The sage’s wisdom illumines like the sun and moon, hence it is called Great Clarity. When moved by sensation, it is said to ascend to the heights of Great Clarity; when free of sensation, deeply rooted and profoundly serene, it is said to enter the gate of profound obscurity. Heaven and Earth have their offices—*Xuan comments: 'The two powers divide their functions'*—yin and yang have their repositories—*Xuan comments: 'Each is the root of the other.'* Guard your body with care, and the myriad things will naturally flourish."

*Xuan comments: "The 'things' here refer to the Dao. Guard the body, and the Dao will receive its nourishment, naturally achieving completion."*

"I guard the One and dwell in harmony—*Xuan comments: 'The harmony of the two qi'*—thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, and my form has never declined."

*Xuan comments: "The way of long life lies in the mutual guardianship of form and spirit."*

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and said: "Master Guangcheng is what may be called Heaven!"

*Xuan comments: "In virtue, he is one with Heaven."*

Master Guangcheng said: "Come!"

"I shall speak to you. Those things appear boundless, yet people all deem them finite; the Dao moves in cycles, yet people believe it perishes and ends. Those things seem unfathomable, yet people all suppose them limited; the Dao is inherently inexhaustible, yet people believe it has an end. One who attains my Dao may ascend as sovereign above or reign as king below; one who loses my Dao may rise to see light yet sink into dust. Though they behold brightness, they have already become soil.

Now, the hundred flourishing things—all that thrives is called the hundred flourishing—are born from earth and return to earth. *Xuan comments: 'Those who do not know the Dao differ not from mere things!'*

Thus I shall leave you, entering the Gate of the Boundless to wander the Wilds of the Limitless. *Cheng comments: 'Returning to the root of darkness and stillness, entering the Gate of the Boundless; responding to change between heaven and earth, wandering the Wilds of the Limitless.'*

I share radiance with the sun and moon; I am constant with heaven and earth. *Cheng comments: 'Share, meaning the same.'*

Approach me, and all is merged! *Shiwen: 'Merged, meaning blended as one.'* Depart from me, and all is obscured! *Guo Songtao comments: 'Merged and obscured are interchangeable; merged is also obscured. Approach me, turn toward me; depart from me, turn away. Let others turn toward or away—respond with a heart devoid of intent.'*

Let others perish entirely; I alone endure!" *Xuan comments: 'In unceasing union with the Dao.'*

*[Note: The four characters "What is to be done?" are supplied from the *Jishi* edition.*

Cloud General was traveling east—*Chuxue Ji* cites Sima, who says: 'Cloud General, the commander of clouds.'*—when he passed the branch of the *fusang* tree—*Li comments: 'Fusang, a divine tree growing in the Eastern Sea.'*—and happened upon Hong Meng. *Sima comments: 'The primordial qi of nature.'* Hong Meng was just then slapping his thighs and leaping about in play. *Cheng comments: 'Slapping, meaning to strike. Leaping, meaning to jump.'*

Cloud General, seeing him, halted in startled confusion and stood motionless. *Li comments: 'Startled, meaning lost in self-forgetting. Motionless, meaning still and unmoving.'* He asked: "Old sir, who are you? Old sir, what are you doing?"

Hong Meng said, "Wandering."

Cloud General said, "I wish to ask you something."

Hong Meng looked up at Cloud General and exclaimed, "Hmph!"

Cloud General said, "The qi of Heaven is discordant, the qi of Earth is pent-up, the Six Qi are unbalanced—*Cheng comments: 'Yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and light.'*—and the Four Seasons are out of order. Now I wish to harmonize the essence of the Six Qi to nurture all living things—*Cheng comments: 'To blend the essence of the Six Qi and nourish the myriad beings.'*—what is to be done?"

Hong Meng slapped his thighs, leapt about, shook his head, and said, "I know not, I know not."

Cloud General could not press his question. Three years later, he traveled east again, passing through the wilds of Song, where he once more encountered Hong Meng. Cloud General rejoiced greatly, hastened forward, and said, "Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?"—*addressing him as "Heaven," as the Yellow Emperor did with Guangchengzi.* He bowed twice, prostrating himself, and wished to hear from Hong Meng.

Hong Meng said, "To wander without seeking, to roam wildly without aim, to find what one seeks of itself, to go where one pleases of itself. The wanderer moves freely—*with the reins in hand, meaning to go forth and wander*—to observe the uncontrived. *Xuan comments: 'The spontaneous movement of true mechanism; I merely follow and behold it.'* What do I know?"

Cloud General said, "I, too, thought myself wild and aimless, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot escape their company—*Xuan comments: 'They will not leave me be.'*—now they merely imitate me. *Guo comments: 'They mimic what I do.'* I wish to hear a single word from you."

Hong Meng said, "To disrupt Heaven’s constancy, to oppose the nature of things, is to fail in the mysterious workings of Heaven—*Cheng comments: 'To disorder Heaven’s constant Way, to go against the true nature of things, is to prevent the transformations of nature from coming to fruition.'*—to scatter the herds of beasts and make birds cry out at night. Disaster befalls the grasses and trees, calamity reaches even the crawling creatures. *Shiwen comments: 'Stop (止) is also written as 昆.' Su Yu comments: '止 and 豸 are interchangeable.'* Alas! This is the fault of governing people!" *Shiwen comments: 'Alas (意) is also written as 噫; the same below.' Guo comments: 'Where there are traces of governance, there lies the root of disorder.'*

Cloud General said, "Then what am I to do?"

Hong Meng said, "Alas! How poisonous! *Xuan comments: 'The harm runs deep.'* Away with you, lightly, lightly!"

Cloud General said, "I have met with Heaven’s difficulty; I wish to hear a single word."

Hong Meng said, "Alas! Cultivate the heart. Only the heart should be cultivated. You must dwell in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. *Cheng comments: '徒 means merely.'* Cast off your form, expel your cleverness—*Cheng comments: 'Forget both body and mind.'*—forget all relations and things, so that human ties and the myriad beings all efface their traces. Merge with the vast primordial qi—*Sima comments: '涬溟 is the qi of nature.' Xuan comments: 'Become one with the boundless qi.'*—unbind the heart, release the spirit, and be as though soulless. *Xuan comments: 'Loosen its attachments, free its bonds.' Cheng comments: '魂 refers to the pursuit of knowledge; 莫然 means without knowing, like dead ashes or withered wood.'* The ten thousand things, teeming—*Cheng comments: '云云 means multitudinous.' Su Yu comments: '按: "云云" in the *Laozi* is written as "芸芸," meaning natural and spontaneous.'*—each returns to its root. *Xuan comments: 'Each attains its uncontrived true origin.'* Each returns to its root yet knows it not. Vast and undifferentiated, they remain thus all their lives—*Xuan comments: 'Without opening their knowledge.'*—for if they knew it, they would depart from it. *Cheng comments: 'To employ knowledge is to depart from natural nature.'* Do not question their names, do not pry into their natures—*Xuan comments: 'Things have no inherent names, so I need not ask; they have no inherent natures, so I need not pry.'*—and things will naturally come to life. *Cheng comments: 'Entrusting to spontaneous transformation, things attain their inherent principles.'*

Cloud General said, "Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me, shown me silence, and through my own seeking, I have now attained it." He bowed twice, prostrated himself, rose, took his leave, and departed.

The common people all delight in those who are like themselves and despise those who differ. Those who desire likeness and reject difference do so with the intent of standing above the crowd—*Xuan comments: 'They believe they surpass the multitude and that all should follow them.'*—yet how can those who seek to stand above the crowd ever truly do so? They are not genuinely above the crowd. Relying on the multitude to settle what they have heard, they are not even as reliable as those who gather the skills of the many. *Without unique insight, they merely cling to what they have heard from the crowd and take comfort in it, yet they are less trustworthy than those who collect the skills of the many.* Yet they desire to govern others’ states—this is grasping at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to their harms. *Xuan comments: 'Yet they wish to govern others’ states with their own views, merely seizing upon the advantages of sagely knowledge and benevolence while ignoring their dangers.'* This is to gamble with others’ states. How often can one gamble and not lose the state? In preserving a state, there is not one chance in ten thousand; in losing it, one failure leads to ten thousand losses. *One matter fails, and ten thousand follow.* Alas! How ignorant are those who hold land! For those who possess land possess a great thing."

Those who possess great things cannot be used by things to govern things. *Guo comments: "If one cannot employ things but is instead employed by them, one is merely a thing—how could one govern things? If one cannot govern things, then one is unworthy of possessing great things."* Yet by not being a thing, one can govern things. *Xuan comments: "If one does not perceive things as things, one transcends them, and thus can master them."* Understanding that those who govern things are not themselves things—how could this apply merely to ruling the world and its people?

They enter and exit the six directions, roam the nine provinces, going alone and coming alone: this is called "possessing alone." Those who possess alone are called the most noble. *Cheng comments: "Those who wish to stand out from the crowd and roam alone—none can match this ability, hence it is called 'possessing alone.' Such people are borne and upheld by the people as their lord, truly the most exalted and noble."*

The teachings of the great person are like a form casting its shadow, a sound echoing its response. When questioned, they answer, exhausting what lies within their heart, becoming the world’s counterpart. *Cheng comments: "The counterpart (配) means a match. The one who first senses is the master; the respondent is the match."* They dwell where there is no echo, *Guo comments: "Abiding in stillness to await things."* and move without fixed direction. *Guo comments: "Adapting to things as they transform."*

They lead you through the tumult of comings and goings, *Yu comments: "The *Shi Gu* states: '适 means to go.' 适复 means to go and return. 挠挠 means chaos. Only the great person can guide those entangled in the world’s chaotic comings and goings, roaming with them in boundlessness."* entering and exiting without obstruction, *Xuan comments: "读若去声 (qù shēng)."* sharing no beginning with the sun. *Cheng comments: "Renewing with the sun, thus without end or beginning."*

They praise the body’s form, aligning with the great unity; they assess its appearance, harmonizing with the multitude, without setting themselves apart. In great unity, there is no self. With no self, how could there be anything possessed? *Guo comments: "The difficulty in the world lies in the self. Once the self is gone, the myriad things are no longer possessed."*

Those who perceive possession are the gentlemen of former times; *Xuan comments: "The so-called enlightened sages of the Three Dynasties."* those who perceive non-possession are friends of heaven and earth.

What is lowly yet cannot be left unengaged are things; what is humble yet cannot be left unaccommodated is the people. Though people and things are humble, one must engage and accommodate them, for turning against their nature brings disorder. What is hidden yet cannot be left undone are affairs; *Guo comments: "Affairs are concealed in others, each acting on its own, so one cannot act alone but must follow and entrust."* what is coarse yet cannot be left unpresented is law; *Cheng comments: "Law refers to teachings. Principles are subtle, laws are coarse, so they are presented accordingly."* what is distant yet cannot be left unoccupied is righteousness; *Cheng comments: "Though righteousness is far from the Dao, if it accords with principle, it must be adopted."* what is close yet cannot be left unexpanded is benevolence; *Cheng comments: "Partial affection is narrow; universal love is great benevolence."* what is regulated yet cannot be left unaccumulated is ritual; *Cheng comments: "积 means to thicken. 节 means ornamentation."* what is centered yet cannot be left unexalted is virtue. *Those who cultivate virtue are in harmony with the world, naturally lofty and far-reaching.*

What is one yet cannot be left unchanged is the Dao; *Cheng comments: "The wondrous origin is a single qi, giving life to the myriad things. It is utterly simple and easy—only the Dao!"* what is spiritual yet cannot be left undone is heaven. Thus, the sage observes heaven without aiding it, *Cheng comments: "The sage observes the wondrous principles of nature, fully complying with things without interfering with their inherent nature."* achieves virtue without encumbrance, emerges from the Dao without scheming, *Guo comments: "Unscheming unity is the essence of simplicity."* meets benevolence without reliance—*Their actions naturally align with benevolence, without depending on it.*—thins righteousness without accumulation, responds to ritual without avoidance, *Yu comments: "讳 is read as 违 (wéi). The *Guang Ya* defines 讳 as 'to avoid.' The *Guo Yu*’s Wei commentary states: '违 means to avoid.' The two words are phonetically close and semantically connected. 不讳 means 'not to avoid.'"* engages with affairs without refusal, equalizes by law without disorder, *Cheng comments: "Following the nature of things, using law to equalize them, thus no disorder arises."* relies on the people without disdain, *Guo comments: "Relying on their self-action, not lightly employing them."* and follows things without abandoning them. *Guo comments: "Following and entrusting them, not abandoning their root."*

Things cannot be forced, yet they cannot be left undone. *Cheng comments: "What is inherently absent cannot be forced; what is inherent in nature cannot be left undone."* Those who do not understand heaven lack pure virtue; *Cheng comments: "Those who are ignorant of natural principles have shallow and impure virtue."* those who do not comprehend the Dao have no path to proceed. *Cheng comments: "Facing matters like a wall, with no way forward."* Those who do not understand the Dao—how pitiful!

What is the Dao? There is the Dao of heaven and the Dao of humans. The honored, who act without doing, belong to the Dao of heaven; the burdened, who act with effort, belong to the Dao of humans. The ruler follows the Dao of heaven; the minister follows the Dao of humans. The Dao of heaven and the Dao of humans—*Xuan comments: "This passage’s meaning is superficial, its phrasing miscellaneous, and it does not closely align with the chapter’s themes. It does not resemble Zhuangzi’s style; perhaps it is a later addition."*—are vastly distant; this cannot go unexamined.

Case in point: Xuan’s doubt is well-founded. Yet Guo Xiang’s commentary exists, so the received text must already have been thus by the Jin dynasty. 〔The eight characters “the Dao of heaven and the Dao of humans” are supplied from the *Jishi* edition.〕

**Outer Chapters, “Heaven and Earth” (Chapter Twelve)**

Though heaven and earth are vast, their transformation is uniform.
*Guo comments: “Uniform in non-action, for they transform of themselves.”*
Though the myriad things are many, their governance is one.
*Guo comments: “Governance is one when each attains its own fulfillment.”*
Though the masses of people are numerous, their lord is the ruler.
The ruler originates in virtue and is perfected by heaven, rooted in possessing virtue and completed by spontaneity.
Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world governed through non-action—this was simply the virtue of heaven.
*Cheng comments: “‘Ancient’ means distant. The sage-kings of remote antiquity governed the world through non-action; this was merely the virtue of spontaneity.”*
*Su Yu comments: “‘Ancient’ forms a complete phrase, with the same meaning as ‘profound virtue’ below.”*

Viewed through the Dao in speech, the rulers of the world are rectified.
*Guo comments: “Those who act without doing naturally become rulers.”*
*Guo Songtao comments: “Speech refers to names. Rectifying the ruler’s name, the world obeys his commands. Thus it is said: ‘Names must be spoken, but their correctness lies in aligning with the Dao.’”*
Viewed through the Dao in distinctions, the duties of ruler and minister are clarified.
*Guo comments: “Each fulfills its proper role: non-action for the superior position, effort for the subordinate.”*
Viewed through the Dao in abilities, the offices of the world are well-ordered.
*Guo comments: “When each office corresponds to its proper ability, there is order.”*
Viewed through the Dao in its all-embracing aspect, the responses of the myriad things are complete.
*Xuan comments: “Responding without limit.”*

Thus, that which penetrates heaven and earth is virtue;
*Guo comments: “When the myriad things all attain their due, heaven and earth are penetrated.”*
that which moves through the myriad things is the Dao.
*Cheng comments: “The supreme principle is unobstructed, freely allowing all things to come and go together—this is called the Dao.”*
*Xuan comments: “‘Dao’ here may be a corruption of ‘meaning.’”*
That which governs people from above is affairs;
*Cheng comments: “When affairs are conducted appropriately, the world is governed.”*
that which possesses skill is technique.
*Guo comments: “Technique is the peripheral application of the myriad things.”*
Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by rightness, rightness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by heaven.
*Guo comments: “When the Dao of heaven flows smoothly, root and branch are both unimpeded.”*

Thus it is said: “The ancients who nurtured the world—*nurtured* means to cultivate—had no desires, and the world was sufficient; acted without doing, and the myriad things were transformed; were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.”
*Cheng comments: “Laozi said: ‘I value stillness, and the people are naturally rectified.’”*
The Record states: *The “Shiwen” notes: “A book, composed by Laozi.”*
“When one penetrates the One, the myriad affairs are complete.”
*Cheng comments: “The One is the Dao. Affairs arise from principle, and principle necessarily encompasses affairs. The root can embrace the branches, so knowing the One, the myriad affairs are complete. This saying appears in the *Xisheng Jing*.”*
“With the attainment of non-intentionality, ghosts and spirits submit.”
Attainment through non-intentionality means none fail to submit.

The Master said: *Sima comments: “Zhuangzi.” Another version: “Laozi.”*
*X

Within clarity lies illumination, and the myriad things reside in a single storehouse.
*Cheng comments: “Forgetting both self and other.”*
Death and life share the same form.
*Cheng comments: “Oblivious to transformation.”*

The Master said: *The Dao dwells in profound depths, limpid in its purity.*
*Annotation: “The *Guangya* states: ‘*Liáo* describes its clarity.’”*
Without metal or stone, there would be no sound. If metal and stone lack harmony, they do not ring—this too reveals the incipient workings of the Dao. Thus, metal and stone possess sound, yet without striking, they do not resonate. Only through resonance do they respond. Who among the myriad things can fix them in place? Extending this principle, the myriad things respond to resonance without limit—who can fix them in place?

The person of royal virtue moves in plain simplicity, ashamed to be entangled in affairs, embracing simplicity in their passage, disdaining involvement in mundane tasks.
*Su Yu comments: “‘Plain simplicity in passage’ echoes the *Shanmu* chapter’s ‘tranquil in their embodied passage.’ ‘Entangled in affairs’ contrasts with ‘attuned to the numinous’—the character for ‘ashamed’ may be an error.”*
They establish their root and origin, thereby attaining attunement with the numinous. Thus their virtue spreads widely. Once the root and origin are established, wisdom can commune with the numinous, and so their virtue extends broadly. When their heart extends outward, things gather to it. Without resonance, there is no response. Thus, form does not arise without the Dao, and life does not become luminous without virtue.
*Cheng comments: “The Dao enables the arising of the myriad things, hence without the Dao there is no arising. Virtue illumines the root and origin, hence without virtue there is no illumination. As the *Laozi* states: ‘The Dao gives birth to them, virtue nurtures them.’”*
To preserve form and exhaust life, to establish virtue and illuminate the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue?

Vast and boundless! Suddenly they emerge, abruptly they move, and the myriad things follow them—this is the person of royal virtue.
*Guo comments: “‘Suddenly’ and ‘abruptly’ both describe the unselfconscious responsiveness of such a person.”*
They see within obscurity, hear within silence.
*Xuan comments: “The Dao does not reside in form or circumstance.”*
Within obscurity, they alone perceive the dawn; within silence, they alone hear the harmony.
*Xuan comments: “The Dao is not mere quiescence.”*
Thus, profound beyond profundity, yet able to give rise to things.
*Xuan comments: “Utterly unfathomable, yet things emerge from it.”*
Numinous beyond numinosity, yet able to refine essence. Limitless and without direction, yet its essence cannot be concealed. Therefore, in their engagement with the myriad things, they are utterly without substance yet fulfill all requests, not possessing yet providing without fail. They gallop through time, seizing the essential and returning to their origin; they travel afar, yet their return can be met. Great and small, long and short, distant and near.
*Xuan comments: “‘Distant and near’ should read ‘far and near.’ Great or small, long or short, far or near.”*

The Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Waters, ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun, and gazed southward. Upon his return, he lost his Dark Pearl. *Wen Xuan’s commentary on "Guang Juejiao Lun" cites Sima, who says: “The Red Waters are a figurative name. The Dark Pearl is a metaphor for the Dao.”* *Xuan comments: “Red is the luminous color of the south; its north is the realm of the dark. The south is the direction of clarity. Having wandered the dark realm, he could not long abide there, and gazing once more toward the bright, the dark was lost.”*

He sent Knowledge to seek it, but Knowledge could not find it. He sent Li Zhu to seek it, but Li Zhu could not find it. He sent Chi Gou to seek it, but Chi Gou could not find it. *Guo Songtao says: “The *Guangyun* states: ‘Chi is the same as ●.’ ● means sound; Gou means anger, and anger too is sound. The *Jiyun* says ‘Chi Gou means strenuous contention,’ which is apt. Knowledge seeks with spirit, Li Zhu seeks with form and shadow, Chi Gou seeks with sound and reputation—thus the more they seek, the farther they stray. But Vague Image, neither form nor formless, could perceive and obtain it.”*

Then he sent Vague Image, and Vague Image found it. The Yellow Emperor said: “How strange! Could Vague Image alone obtain it?” *Xuan comments: “Seeming to have form yet truly formless—this is what is meant by ‘without mind.’”*

Yao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.

Yao asked Xu You: “Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven? I would enlist Wang Ni to summon him.” Yao wished to yield the world to Nie Que, using Wang Ni to bring him forth.

Xu You said: “How perilous it would be to entrust the world to him! Nie Que’s nature is keen, perceptive, wise, and quick—his talents surpass others. *Cheng comments: “Rui means sagely; gei means nimble; min means swift.”* Yet he also takes the human in place of the Heavenly. *Xuan comments: “He is not purely of Heaven.”* He is precise in forbidding transgressions but does not know whence transgressions arise. *Guo comments: “Transgressions arise from keen perception, and he further employs perception to forbid them—thus his perception grows ever more acute.”* Could such a one match Heaven? He would ride the human and lose the Heavenly. If made Son of Heaven, he would rely entirely on the human and no longer retain his natural nature. He would distinguish self from other, exalt perception and rush like fire, be driven by trifling tasks, *Xuan comments: “Ensnared by petty affairs.”* be bound by things, *Xuan comments: “Constrained by external objects.”* glance in all directions as things respond, *Xuan comments: “Endlessly occupied with responses.”* seek to accommodate every contingency, *Xuan comments: “Striving to conform to every situation.”* and transform with things without constancy. *Xuan comments: “Ever changing with circumstances, unable to remain steadfast.”* How could he be fit to match Heaven? Nevertheless, he has clan and ancestry—*Xuan comments: “Every clan has its founding ancestors.”*—he may serve as father to the multitude but not as father of fathers. *Xuan comments: “The father of fathers is the great ancestor of all transformations, the primal source. Nie Que may be a father to the people, but not the father of all fathers.”* He is the master of order and disorder—*Xuan comments: “Master here means origin.”*—employing perception to govern things, he is the source of both order and chaos. He is the calamity of those who face north, the ruin of those who face south.” *Xuan comments: “He is unfit to be a minister, and unfit to be a ruler.”* *Note: This is spoken to caution Yao, not that Nie Que is truly thus.*

Yao observed the land of Hua. *Sima comments: “A place name.”* The border guard of Hua said: “Ah! The sage!”

The border guard of Hua offered blessings to the sage: “May the sage enjoy long life.” Yao replied: “I decline.”
“May the sage grow wealthy.” Yao replied: “I decline.”
“May the sage have many sons.” Yao replied: “I decline.”
The border guard said: “Long life, wealth, and many sons—these are what all people desire. Why do you alone refuse them?”
Yao said: “Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; long life brings many humiliations. These three are not the means to nurture virtue, so I decline.”
The border guard said: “At first, I took you for a sage—now you are merely a gentleman. *Xuan comments: “Now you are like this—you are only fit to be a gentleman.”* Heaven gives birth to the myriad people and must assign them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear is there? If you are wealthy and distribute it among others, what affairs remain? The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling—*Xuan comments: “The quail has no fixed dwelling, meaning he does not seek comfort; the fledgling waits for its mother to feed it, meaning he does not seek satiety.”*—moving like a bird in flight, leaving no trace. *Cheng comments: “In harmony with all things, like a bird’s flight, no visible tracks remain.”* When the world follows the Dao, he flourishes with all things; when the world loses the Dao, he cultivates virtue in seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs to become an immortal, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. *Cheng comments: “The three afflictions—wealth, long life, and many sons—do not reach him.”* His person remains free from misfortune—what humiliation is there?”
The border guard left, and Yao followed him, saying: “May I ask a question?”
The border guard replied: “Withdraw!”
When Yao governed the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was established as a feudal lord.

The *Shiwen* notes: “The *Tongbian Jing* states: ‘Since the opening of heaven and earth, Laozi’s body has undergone one thousand two hundred transformations. In later ages, those who attain the Dao—Bo Cheng Zi Gao is one such.’”

When Yao abdicated to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his title as feudal lord and took up plowing. Yu went to see him and found him tilling in the fields. Yu hastened to stand downwind and, standing, asked: “In the past, when Yao governed the world, you were established as a feudal lord. Yao abdicated to Shun, and Shun to me, yet you resigned your title to plow. May I ask the reason?”

Zi Gao replied: “In the past, when Yao governed the world, he did not reward, yet the people were encouraged; he did not punish, yet the people stood in awe. Now you reward and punish, and the people grow unkind. Virtue declines from this, punishments arise from this, and the chaos of later ages begins from this. Why do you trouble yourself? Do not hinder my work!” He plowed on, vigorous and unheeding.

The *Shiwen* notes: “阖 (*hé*) is also written as 盍 (*hé*). 落 (*luò*) means ‘to abandon.’ The *Zilin* states: ‘俋俋 (*yìyì*) describes a robust and vigorous appearance.’”

In the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing—yet it cannot be called Nonbeing. There was Nameless Nonbeing, which may be called Nonbeing but cannot be named. From the arising of the One, there was the One, yet formless. *Xuan* comments: “The Great Ultimate had not yet manifested.” When things obtain this to come into being, it is called virtue. *Xuan* comments: “When things obtain this formless One to come into being, each possesses a Great Ultimate within its nature—hence it is called virtue.” The formless has divisions, yet remains unbroken and continuous—this is called fate. *Xuan* comments: “Though divided into yin and yang, they transform and unite in ceaseless flow—this is heaven’s way of decreeing fate.” When movement lingers, things are born. *Xuan* comments: “Movement is the flowing of creation; when it lingers briefly, a thing is born.” When a thing is complete in its principle of life, it is called form. *Xuan* comments: “When a thing receives this and fulfills its principle of life, it is called form.” When form and body preserve spirit, each has its proper norms—this is called nature. *Cheng* comments: “体 (*tǐ*) means ‘substance.’” *Xuan* comments: “Form bears spirit and preserves it; in its seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting, each follows its proper norms—this is what is called nature. The earlier statement, ‘obtaining this to come into being is called virtue,’ refers to this. That nature is discussed after form is because nature requires form to bear it—hence it is said, ‘form and body preserve spirit.’” When nature is cultivated, it returns to virtue. *Xuan* comments: “When nature is cultivated, it reverts to the One it obtained when formless.” When virtue reaches its utmost, it merges with the Beginning. *Xuan* comments: “When virtue reaches its peak, it merges with the Great Beginning—this is the highest attainment.” Merging is emptiness; emptiness is greatness. *Xuan* comments: “This describes the wondrous state of merging with the Beginning.” When sounds unite in speech, *Xuan* comments: “All voices blend—this is the forgetting of words.” when speech unites, it merges with heaven and earth. *Xuan* comments: “Having forgotten words, one becomes one with heaven and earth.” This merging is profound and subtle. If it appears foolish or dull, *Guo* comments: “This is the merging of sitting in forgetfulness.” it is called mysterious virtue, aligning with the Great Compliance. *Guo* comments: “Virtue is profound, and what it complies with is vast.”

Confucius asked Lao Dan: “There is one who practices the Dao as if imitating others—what is not may be taken as is, what is not so may be taken as so.” *Guo* comments: “As if imitating, forcing the unacceptable to be acceptable, the untrue to be true.” A debater once said: ‘Separating hardness and whiteness is like suspending the cosmos.’” *Cheng* comments: “‘Hardness and whiteness’ refers to Gongsun Long’s *Discourse on the White Horse*. Kong Chuan and his followers rigidly upheld this theory, unmatched in their time. Now the debater claims, ‘I can dissect the theory of hardness and whiteness, not treating it as debate—like suspending the sun and moon in the cosmos.’” If this is so, can such a one be called a sage?”

Lao Dan replied: “This is a petty clerk bound by skill, one who wearies the body and startles the mind. (See the *Responding to Emperors and Kings* chapter.) A hound skilled in seizing prey is kept on a leash and grows anxious; a nimble gibbon is brought from the mountains. *Shiwen* notes: “执留 (*zhíliú*) is also written as ●, or as 狸 (*lí*). Sima [Biao] comments: ‘● is a bamboo rat.’ Another says: ‘A hound called *zhíliú* is kept leashed because of its skill, growing sorrowful.’ According to the *Shuowen*: ‘● is a bamboo rat.’ The *Piya* states: ‘It is also called a bamboo ●.’ Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shanhaijing* cites ‘its sound like a *liú* ox’ as evidence for ‘执留之狗’ in this passage. From this, we know *liú* refers to the *liú* ox, not the bamboo rat—though the bamboo rat’s sound resembles the *liú* ox. The *liú* ox is the *lí* ox, with *liú* and *lí* being homophonous. The *lí* ox is large, like the ‘clouds hanging from the sky’ in the *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter. This hound alone can seize it—hence it is called the *zhíliú* hound. The point is that the hound, though skilled, is leashed and grows sorrowful, while the gibbon, though nimble, is brought from the mountains—both are constrained. The *Responding to Emperors and Kings* chapter quotes Laozi: ‘The nimbleness of gibbons and the hound that seizes the *lí* ox come to be harnessed’—slightly different from this passage, but the meaning is largely the same, further proving that *liú* and *lí* are the same character.’”

“Alas! I tell you what you cannot hear, and what you cannot speak.”

“This refers to the Dao. *Ruò* and *ér*—both mean ‘you.’ All those with heads and feet but without minds or ears are many.” Xuān comments: “Those embodied as humans yet without knowledge or perception are all such.” “Those with form and those without form or shape yet all existing—none remain. Those with form are humans; those without form or shape are the Dao. None can exist with both human and Dao. Their movement is cessation; their death is life; their decline is rise. Yet these are not the *therefore* of it. Motion and stillness, life and death, flourishing and decay—none are where the Dao resides. There is governance in humans.” Sū Yǔ comments: “The Dao cannot be named; only the traces of its transformative influence remain in humans.” “Forget things, forget Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. Having forgotten things, one forgets even the natural Heaven—this is what is meant by forgetting the self. Those who forget the self are said to enter into Heaven.” Xuān comments: “To become one with Heaven.”

Jiānglǘ Miǎn visited Jì Chè and said—*Shìwén* notes: “*Jiāng* is also written as *Jiǎng*. *Miǎn* is also written as *Tù*, pronounced *miǎn*. The surname is Jiānglǘ, the given name Tù. Alternatively, the surname is Jiǎng, the given name Lǘmiǎn.” Jì Chè was a person’s name, likely of the Jì clan—“The Lord of Lǔ said to Miǎn: ‘I request to receive your teaching.’ He declined but could not refuse the command. Having already spoken, he was unsure whether it had struck true, so he asked to try presenting it again. *Cháng* means ‘to test’; *jiàn* means ‘to advance.’ I shall advance it to Chè. I said to the Lord of Lǔ: ‘You must practice reverence and frugality as if donning them. Uproot the ranks of public-spirited loyalty—*shǔ* means ‘category’—and let no partiality or self-interest remain, so that governance is without private bias. Then which of the people would dare not be harmonious?’” *Jí* means ‘harmony.’

Jì Chè laughed heartily and said: “As for your master’s words, regarding the virtue of emperors and kings, it is like the mantis raising its arms in anger to block a chariot’s wheel-tracks—it will surely not suffice. Moreover, if this is so, then one’s self-cultivation will be perilous, not a path to self-security.”

"The observation terrace teems with affairs—*guān tái* refers to the lord’s dwelling-place; *wù* means ‘matters.’ This means that from the lord’s vantage, matters multiply. Those who come to follow in his steps will be many." Where footsteps gather, the lord will soon be overwhelmed by their burdens, which is no way for an emperor or king to cultivate virtue and bring peace to the people.

Jiǎng Lǘ Miǎn started in alarm, saying: "*Miǎn* is utterly at a loss before your master’s words." *Xì xì* describes his startled demeanor. Though bewildered, he said: "Nevertheless, I beg you to speak of its general outline." *Fēng* is read as *fán*, meaning "to speak of its essentials." Since *fēng* originally derives from *fán*, the two may be used interchangeably.

Jì Chè said: "When the great sage governs the world, he stirs and sways the people’s hearts, transforming their education and altering their customs. He wholly eradicates their predatory impulses and advances their singular resolve. The people follow as if by their own nature, unaware of how this comes to be. In this way, does he defer to the teachings of Yao and Shun as if they were his elder brothers? Rather, he regards them as so much dross. He does not yield precedence to Yao and Shun but seeks to align all under a single virtue, his heart at rest in non-action."

When Zigong journeyed south to Chu and returned to Jin, he passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man tending his garden beds—Li [Yi] notes: "Vegetables are called *pu*; bordered plots are called *qi*"—who had dug a tunnel to enter a well. Carrying a jar, he emerged to water his plants, straining laboriously yet accomplishing little. Guo [Xiang] observes: "*Huhu* describes the appearance of exertion."

Zigong said: "Here is a device that can irrigate a hundred beds in a single day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not desire it?"

The gardener raised his head to look at him and asked: "How does it work?"

Zigong replied: "Carve wood into a mechanism, heavier at the rear and lighter at the front, which draws water as if by pulling. Its speed resembles boiling water overflowing."—Li [Yi] notes: "*Chou* means 'to draw.'" The *Shiwen* reads: "*Shu* is pronounced *suǒjué*; *yi* may also be written as *yì*. Li [Yi] says: 'As swift as boiling water spilling over.'"—"It is called a *gao*." The *Shiwen* reads: "May also be written as *qiao*; Sima [Biao] and Li [Yi] say: 'It is a well-sweep.'"

The gardener flushed with anger, his expression turning to scornful laughter as he said: "I have heard from my teacher: 'One who possesses mechanical devices must engage in mechanical affairs; one who engages in mechanical affairs must harbor a mechanical heart.' When a mechanical heart lodges in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete. When purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit’s life is unsettled. One whose spirit’s life is unsettled cannot be borne by the Dao. *Sheng* and *xing* are synonymous; this means one cannot be a vessel for the Dao. I am not ignorant of such things—I am ashamed to do them."

Zigong hung his head in shame, his face downcast, and made no reply.

After a pause, the gardener asked, "What are you doing here?"

"I am a disciple of Kong Qiu," Zigong replied.

The gardener said, "Are you not one of those who amass vast learning to rival the sages, who strut about to overshadow the masses—who sing mournful songs on a single string to peddle your reputation across the world? You should be forgetting your *qi* and spirit, casting off your bodily form, and nearing the Way! Yet you cannot even govern yourself—how could you presume to govern the world? Be gone! Do not hinder my work."

Zigong shrank back, his face pale with shame, and felt utterly discomposed. He walked thirty *li* before recovering.

His disciples asked, "Who was that man just now? Why did you change countenance and lose composure before him, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?"

Zigong said, "At first, I thought there was only one such man in the world. I did not know there was another like him. I heard from the Master: 'In affairs, seek what is fitting; in work, seek completion; expend little effort yet achieve much—this is the Way of the sage.' But this man is not so. One who holds to the Dao has complete virtue; one with complete virtue has a complete form; one with a complete form has complete spirit. One with complete spirit—this is the Way of the sage. He entrusts his life to the world and walks among the people, yet does not know where he is headed. How boundless and perfectly whole he is! How unfathomable his attainment."

"One must utterly forget the heart that pursues merit, profit, cunning, and artifice. Such a heart is free of these four burdens. As for such a person, if his aspiration does not tend toward it, his heart will not act upon it. Though the world praises him and he attains what he deems right—what is called complete virtue—he remains aloof and unmoved. Though the world condemns him and he loses what he deems right, he remains indifferent and unshaken. The world’s praise or blame neither benefits nor harms him; this is the person of complete virtue!

Yet I am one tossed by the winds and waves." Returning to Lu, he told Confucius what had transpired.

Confucius said, "That man merely dabbles in the arts of the Primal Chaos: he recognizes one aspect but not the other. He cultivates his inner self but neglects his outer conduct. One who is lucid and returns to simplicity, who acts without contrivance and restores primal integrity, who embraces spirit and roams among the common folk—would you truly be so astonished? As for the arts of Primal Chaos, how could you or I presume to comprehend them?"

Hun Mang was traveling east to the Great Abyss, the sea. Along the eastern shore, he encountered Yuan Feng.

Yuan Feng asked, "Where are you going?"
"I am going to the Great Abyss."
"What will you do there?"
"The Great Abyss is such a thing: it receives all yet never fills, it is drawn from yet never exhausted. I will wander there."

Yuan Feng said, "Do you have no concern for the horizontal-eyed people? I would hear of sagely governance."

Hun Mang replied:

"As for sagely governance: offices are established and measures enacted without failing their proper purpose. Sima Biao notes: 'In administering policies and spreading teachings, each attains its fitting place.' Those raised to office never fall short of their capacities. All circumstances are fully discerned, and actions proceed accordingly. Wang Xian comments: 'All conditions and principles are thoroughly perceived, then followed in action.' Words and deeds arise from one’s own nature, and the world is transformed thereby. By personally enacting one’s words, all take self-cultivation as their model, and the people are thereby transformed. With a wave of the hand or a glance of direction, the people of the four directions all come as one. This is to say: with a gesture of the hand or a turn of the head, the people all follow without exception. Sima Biao explains: '挠 means to move.' Guo Qingfan notes: '顾指 refers to turning toward someone and directing them. Zuo Si’s *Rhapsody on the Capital of Wu* reads, "Grasping banners as if at a glance and command," where Liu Kui annotates: "It means to direct as one wishes."' This is what is called sagely governance."

"Now I would hear of the Powered Person."

The Master said: "The Powered Person dwells without thought, moves without deliberation, and harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Wang Xian comments: 'The mind passes over things without lingering.' Within the four seas, all share in the benefits—this is called joy; all are provided for—this is called peace. The people and their ruler together know joy and peace. (The words 为 and 谓 are interchangeable here.) They are forlorn as an infant who has lost its mother, disoriented as a traveler who has lost the Way. The *Shiwen* notes: 'The *Zilin* states: "怊 means dismay."' (Note: 傥 signifies a mind without anchor.) The people depend upon them thus. Their resources are abundant, yet they know not whence they come; their food and drink are sufficient, yet they know not from where they derive. Cheng Xuanying explains: 'With few desires and contentment in their lot, their resources are ever abundant; without craving for rich flavors, their food and drink are always sufficient.' This is called the bearing of the Powered Person." Guo Xiang comments: "Power is the trace of the spirit-person, hence it is called *bearing*."

"Now I would hear of the Spirit Person."

The Master said: "The supreme spirit rides upon light, vanishing with form. The highest grade of spirit-person rides the radiance of illumination, leaving no trace of form. This is called *illuminating the vast*. Cheng Xuanying explains: 'Their wisdom encompasses the ten thousand things, their clarity surpasses the three luminaries; no darkness remains unlit—how could this not be vast!' Yao notes: 'The Jin people avoided the taboo on 昭, writing it as 照 throughout. The *Model Calligraphy of the Right Army* is all thus. Those who do not know this have mistakenly interpreted the character as 照, which is incorrect.' They fulfill destiny and exhaust reality. Wang Xian comments: 'They fulfill Heaven’s mandate and exhaust the true principle.' Heaven and Earth rejoice, and the ten thousand affairs dissolve away. Wang Xian comments: 'They rejoice with Heaven and Earth, and all worldly burdens are cast off.' The ten thousand things return to their true nature, their essential reality made equal. This is called *merging with the Dark Obscurity*." (That is, merging with the profound and obscure.)

Menwugui (the text reads "Men Wuwei" in the Sima Biao edition) and Chizhang Manji—Wang Xian comments: "Chizhang is the surname, Manji the given name"—observed the armies of King Wu.

This refers to the campaign at Mengjin. Chizhang Manji said: "Are they not inferior to the Yu clan? Thus they encountered this calamity." Inferior to the Yu clan’s yielding abdication, they suffered the disaster of armed conquest.

Menwugui said: "Was the world already well-governed when the Yu clan ruled it, or did they restore order only after chaos?" That is, was the world already at peace when the Yu clan took charge, or did they govern only after turmoil had arisen?

Chizhang Manji said: "The universal wish is for a world equally well-governed—why calculate the Yu clan’s merits? Guo Xiang comments: 'When governance is equal, each wish is fulfilled; why deliberate the Yu clan’s virtue and elevate them as rulers?' The Yu clan were physicians for sores." Li Yi comments: "疡 means head wounds." Wang Yinzhi notes: "药 was anciently read as *yao*, akin in sound and meaning to *liao* (to heal). The *Fangyan* states: '疗 means to treat.'" Guo Xiang comments: "The world all suffered from wounds and disorder, so they sought the Yu clan to heal them." Like shaving the bald or calling the doctor when ill. Xuan Ying comments: "Why shave if not bald? Why call a doctor if not ill?"

The filial son prepares medicine to treat his compassionate father, yet his countenance is scorched with distress—the sage feels shame at this. Xuan Ying comments: "This shows it is better to nurture one’s kin so they do not fall ill."

In an age of perfect governance, worthies are not exalted, nor are the capable employed. The high are like treetops—branches without intent, simply existing above. The people are like wild deer. Guo Xiang comments: "Free and self-content." Upright yet unaware of righteousness, naturally fitting. Loving one another yet unaware of benevolence; genuine yet unaware of loyalty; fitting yet unaware of trust. Cheng Xuanying comments: "Acting truly and fittingly." Moving and employing one another, yet not considering it a favor. They serve each other mutually, so no gratitude is owed.

Thus, actions leave no traces, and affairs leave no records. Cheng Xuanying comments: "Acting according to nature, no traces remain. With traces obscured, affairs too vanish." The old edition treats "no records" as a separate passage, and this follows that.

The filial son does not flatter his parents; the loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial conduct. Yet if he agrees with all his parent’s words and deems all their actions good, the world calls him an unworthy son. If he agrees with all his lord’s words and deems all their actions good, the world calls him an unworthy minister. Yet how can one be certain this is not the inevitable way of things? Xuan Ying comments: "They condemn flattery in ministers and sons but fail to see that human nature makes it inevitable."

When the world deems what it calls right as right and what it calls good as good, it does not call such people flatterers—it aligns with them in meaning. Guo Qingfan notes: "道 here means flattery. In the *Yufu* chapter: 'Echoing words to curry favor is called flattery.' In Xunzi’s *Bu Gou* chapter, 'not flattering' appears as '道谀' in the *Han Shi Waizhuan*—道 and 谄 are homophonous variants." Xuan Ying comments: "The world clearly engages in flattery yet does not name it as such."

Does this mean the world holds its own customs as stricter than kinship and more revered than lordship? Xuan Ying comments: "They condemn flattery toward lords and kin but accept it toward worldly customs—does this mean worldly customs are even stricter and more revered?"

Call a man a flatterer of others, and he flushes with anger; call him a sycophant, and he bristles. Yet all his life he flatters others, all his life he sycophants. Xuan Ying comments: "He detests the name but delights in the act." He gathers analogies, adorns his words, and assembles crowds. Xuan Ying comments: "He broadens analogies to make things clear, refines his language to move listeners—this is how he draws people to himself." Thus, his beginning and end, root and branch, do not implicate one another. Xuan Ying comments: "He indulges in the act yet bears no blame—hence they do not implicate each other."

He drapes robes, displays colors, alters his expression to ingratiate himself with the age, yet does not call himself a flatterer—referring to the lord. He joins the company of such men, aligns with their judgments, yet does not consider himself one of the crowd. Xuan Ying comments: "He mingles with the crowd, adopts their ways, yet still believes himself distinct from them." This is the height of folly.

One who recognizes his folly is not utterly foolish; one who recognizes his confusion is not utterly confused. The utterly confused never awaken their whole lives; the utterly foolish never gain insight. Sima Biao comments: "灵 means understanding."

If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached—for the confused are few. If two are confused, the journey is laborious and the destination unattained—for the confused prevail. Now, with the whole world confused, though I have prayers and aspirations, they cannot be fulfilled. Is this not lamentable?

The grand music does not enter the ears of the village folk—*Sima* comments: "Grand music refers to the melodies of *Xianchi* and the six tones."—while the tunes of *Zheyang* and *Huanghua*—*Cheng* notes: "These are likely popular minor folk tunes of antiquity." *Shiwen* adds: "*Huang* is also written as *hua*, pronounced like 'flower.'"—elicit only gaping laughter. *Li* explains: "*Ke* denotes the sound of laughter."

Thus, lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the common crowd—*Xuan* observes: "They do not penetrate." *Cheng* adds: "Words that transcend the vulgar are called lofty."—and the profound speech does not emerge, for vulgar speech prevails. *Cheng* notes: "Emerge means to become manifest."

To be misled by two *fou*-*zhong* measures is to lose one’s way. *Shiwen* reads: "*Fou* should be *chui*; *zhong* should be *zhong*. This speaks of dangling one’s feet in the air, making any destination unattainable." *Sima’s* version has "two *chui zhong*," explaining: "*Zhong* means to fix one’s attention." *Guo Songtao* comments: "*Shuowen* defines *fou* as a clay vessel for holding wine or broth, and *zhong* as a wine vessel. *Xiao Erya* states: 'Two and a half *fu* make a *sou*, two and a half *sou* make a *fou*, and two *fou* make a *zhong*.' Both *fou* and *zhong* are measuring vessels: a *fou* holds four *hu*, and a *zhong* holds eight. To be misled by two *fou* and *zhong* is to fail to distinguish their capacities, and using them as measures leaves one utterly at a loss. The earlier passage speaks of 'one confused' and 'two confused' in terms of people; here, 'misled by two *fou*-*zhong*' refers to matters." *Guo’s* annotation reads: "Each clings to their own certainty, hence they know not where to go." His interpretation likely aligns with the present text. *Lu* altered "*fou*-*zhong*" to "*chui*-*zhong*," and *Cheng’s* commentary followed, though the explanation remains unsatisfactory. *Yu* changed "two *fou*-*zhong*" to "one *qi*-*zhong*," altering even more characters, and his approach is no better than *Guo’s* gloss of the text as it stands.

Now, with the whole world confused, though I have prayers and aspirations, how could they be realized? To know they cannot be realized yet still insist on them is yet another confusion. Thus, it is better to let go and not pursue them. *Xuan* explains: "Not pursue means not to delve into them." If one does not pursue, who then shares the sorrow? *Cheng* notes: "*Bi* means to join with." This is a word of self-consolation.

A leper gives birth in the dead of night and hastily fetches a light to examine the child, anxiously fearing it will resemble him. *Xuan* comments: "A leper dreads his child’s likeness to himself. Now, knowing the world’s confusion, if I insist on what cannot be achieved and thereby add another confusion, am I not equally afraid of resemblance? Thus, it is better to let go and distance oneself from sorrow, for one fears only falling into the same confusion."

A century-old tree is felled to carve sacrificial goblets—*Huainan’s* *Chuzhen* commentary notes: "Sacrificial goblets are intricately carved vessels."—adorned with blue and yellow patterns, yet its severed trunk lies discarded in a ditch. Comparing the sacrificial goblet to the discarded trunk in the ditch, beauty and ugliness differ, yet their loss of nature is the same. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi differ in conduct, yet their loss of nature is equal.

Moreover, there are five ways to lose one’s nature:
First, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear;
Second, the five sounds confuse the ears, making them dull;
Third, the five odors—*Cheng* explains: "The five odors are rank, scorched, fragrant, fishy, and rotten."—foul the nose, congesting and injuring the nasal bridge—*Cheng* adds: "The five odors overwhelm the nose, causing blockage and harm to the forehead." *External texts* call fragrance *chou*, hence the *Yi* says, "Its fragrance is like orchid"; the *Daoist scriptures* speak of "five fragrances," and the *Xisheng Jing* states, "Fragrance and flavor are bondage." *Shiwen* reads: "*Zong* is pronounced *zigong*, and *Guo* reads it as *jun*."
Fourth, the five flavors muddle the mouth, making it diseased and impaired—*Guo Qingfan* notes: "*Shi Jing*’s *Si Qi* commentary says, '*Li* means illness.' *Guang Ya* states, '*Shuang* means injury.' This speaks of harming the sense of taste."
Fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, making the nature restless—*Cheng* explains: "*Qu* means to seek; *hua* means to confuse."

These five are all harms to life. Yet Yang and Mo, standing apart and striving, believe themselves to have attained something—this is not what I call attainment. To be "attained" yet trapped—*Cheng* notes: "Having falsified one’s nature, one encounters hardship."—can this be called attainment? Then the owl in a cage may also be called attainment. Moreover, chasing after sounds and colors to barricade the inner self—like firewood blocking a path—and adorning the outer self with fur caps, kingfisher-feathered crowns, sashes, tablets, and long belts—*Cheng* explains: "A *pi-bian* is a cap made of fur. A *yu-guan* is a crown adorned with kingfisher feathers. *Jin* means to tuck; *hu* is like a jade tablet. *Shen* is a sash. *Xiu* means long."—the inner self is propped up like a cage—*Cheng* notes: "The cage is a pen. Supports fill the inside, hence it is likened to a cage."—while the outer self is bound by ropes and snares—*Shiwen* reads: "*Zhong* is pronounced *zhilong*." *Cheng* adds: "*Mo-jiao* are ropes."—peering about within ropes and snares—*Cheng* explains: "*Huan-huan* describes the gaze."—and believing oneself attained, is like a criminal with arms bound behind his back—*Sima* notes: "Bound arms means tied behind the back." *Xuan* adds: "And fingers locked together."

While tigers and leopards are confined in sacks and cages, one might also deem this "attainment."

The Dao of Heaven moves without accumulation, thus the myriad things come to be. *Shiwen* notes: "Accumulation refers to stagnation and obstruction." The Dao of the Emperor moves without accumulation, thus the world submits. *Xuan* comments: "Spirit and transformation are as one." The Dao of the Sage moves without accumulation, thus all within the seas obeys. *Xuan* adds: "Utmost sincerity knows no pause."

Those who comprehend Heaven, penetrate the Sage, and master the six penetrations and four openings of the Emperor-King’s virtue—when they act for themselves, all is dimly still. *Shiwen* explains: "The six penetrations are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. The four openings are the four directions." *Cheng* elaborates: "The six penetrations refer to the four directions and above and below. The four openings refer to the four seasons. Allowing things to move of themselves is called 'acting for oneself.' Concealing one’s traces and veiling one’s brilliance, one remains as if obscure; yet movement does not disturb stillness, hence all is still."

The stillness of the Sage is not because stillness is good and thus pursued. The myriad things cannot disturb the heart, hence it is still. *Nao* is a loan character for *nao* (to disturb). When water is still, it clearly reflects beard and brows, and its level serves as a standard—great craftsmen take it as their model. Its levelness and standard align, so artisans adopt it, calling it the "water level." *Zhong* is pronounced *zhú-zhòng*.

If still water is so clear, how much more so the spirit! Its clarity is all the more evident. When the Sage’s heart is still, it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the mirror of the myriad things. If truly still, even the essence of Heaven and Earth and the principles of the myriad things cannot escape it.

Now, emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the level of Heaven and Earth and the ultimate of the Dao and virtue. Thus, Emperors, Kings, and Sages rest therein. *Xuan* comments: "They repose their hearts in this." Resting leads to emptiness; emptiness leads to fullness; fullness leads to order. When the heart rests, it unites with emptiness in virtue; united with emptiness, it embraces all principles; embracing all principles, all is well-ordered and in sequence.

Emptiness leads to stillness; stillness leads to movement; movement leads to attainment. Only through emptiness can one achieve stillness; stillness enables movement; movement brings proper attainment. Stillness means non-action; through non-action, those charged with affairs take responsibility. In stillness and non-action, one does not disturb the multitude, so those tasked with affairs govern themselves.

Through non-action, one attains *yuyu*; *yuyu* means cares and troubles cannot abide, and lifespan is long. *Shiwen* cites the *Guangya*: "*Yuyu* means joy." *Xuan* adds: "External troubles cannot reside in the heart, hence the spirit is at ease and life is long."

Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the root of the myriad things. Practicing this while facing south, one becomes a ruler like Yao; practicing this while facing north, one becomes a minister like Shun. Applying this in a superior position is the virtue of Emperors, Kings, and the Son of Heaven; applying this in a subordinate position is the Dao of the Mysterious Sage and Unadorned King. *Cheng* explains: "Those who possess the Dao but lack the rank are called Mysterious Sages and Unadorned Kings—those who esteem themselves, such as Laozi and Confucius." *Yao* notes: "The term 'Unadorned King’s Twelve Classics' is a later usage."

Retiring to leisurely wander with this, recluses of rivers, seas, mountains, and forests submit. *Cheng* comments: "Such as the likes of Chao and Xu." Advancing to govern and pacify the world with this, one’s achievements are great, fame is illustrious, and the world is unified. *Guo* states: "The scope of non-action is vast—where in the world is it not non-action? Thus, if the ruler does not take on the duties of the chief minister, then Yi and Lü remain still in their offices; if the chief minister does not interfere with the hundred officials, then the hundred officials remain still in their governance; if the hundred officials do not burden the myriad people, then the myriad people remain still and secure in their occupations; if the myriad people do not alter their respective abilities, then the world’s self and others remain still and self-content. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, who can achieve anything through action? Thus, the more non-action, the more revered."

Still, one is a Sage; in motion, one is a King. Through non-action, one is revered; through simplicity, the world cannot compete in beauty. Though utterly simple, it is naturally the utmost beauty.

Those who comprehend the virtue of Heaven and Earth call this the Great Root and Great Origin, harmonizing with Heaven. *Guo* explains: "Heaven and Earth take non-action as their virtue; thus, understanding their origin and root means no opposition to Heaven." This is how one harmonizes and regulates the world, harmonizing with others. *Guo* adds: "Following Heaven is how one responds to others; thus, when Heaven’s harmony is complete, human harmony is fulfilled." *Cheng* notes: "*Jun* means to level; *tiao* means to follow."

Harmonizing with others is called human joy; harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy. *Cheng* comments: "Bending to the dust of the world below, rising to accord with nature above."

Zhuangzi said: "O my Master! O my Master! You pulverize the myriad things yet are not cruel, bestow blessings for ten thousand generations yet are not benevolent, are older than high antiquity yet are not long-lived, cover and support Heaven and Earth, carve and sculpt the forms of things yet are not crafty." *Guo* explains: "Longevity refers only to the length of time; without limit, there is nothing to call long-lived." *Note*: These six phrases also appear in the "Great and Venerable Teacher" chapter. In that text, "cruel" is written as "righteous," where righteousness resembles autumn’s killing; "long-lived" is written as "old," with the same meaning.

This is called Heavenly joy.

Thus it is said: Those who know Heavenly joy—while alive, their movement follows Heaven’s course; in death, they transform with things. *Cheng* comments: "In life, they harmonize with Heaven’s four seasons; in death, they merge with the transformations of the myriad things." Still, they share virtue with yin; in motion, they ride the same wave as yang. *These four phrases also appear in the "Engraving Intent" chapter.*

Thus those who know Heavenly joy bear no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no burden from things, no reproach from spirits. *These four phrases also appear in the "Engraving Intent" chapter. "Resentment" is written as "disaster" in that text.*

Thus it is said: In movement, they are like Heaven; in stillness, they are like Earth. Though movement and stillness differ, with no mind they are one. With a single settled mind, they rule all under Heaven. Their spirits bring no misfortune—*Li* explains: "Misfortune here means calamity."—their souls do not weary. *This phrase also appears in the "Engraving Intent" chapter.* With a single settled mind, the myriad things submit. To extend emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, to penetrate the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the heart-mind of the sage, with which they nurture all under Heaven. *To nurture means to cultivate.*

Now, the virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. Through non-action, they employ all under Heaven with abundance; through action, they are employed by all under Heaven with insufficiency. Thus the ancients prized non-action.

When those above practice non-action, those below also practice non-action—this is when those below share virtue with those above. When those below share virtue with those above, they do not serve as ministers. *Cheng* comments: "When above and below practice non-action, ministers usurp the ruler’s virtue." When those below act, those above also act—this is when those above share the Way with those below. When those above share the Way with those below, they do not serve as lords. Those above must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven; those below must act to be employed by all under Heaven. This is the unchanging Dao. *This discourse contains profound principles; it is not empty talk.*

Thus the ancient rulers of all under Heaven, though their knowledge encompassed Heaven and Earth, did not scheme for themselves—*Knowledge here means wisdom; encompassed means enveloped.* *Cheng* comments: "The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of remote antiquity, whose wisdom illuminated the two poles, yet ruled with folded arms and non-action, entrusting matters to their ministers—thus they did not scheme for themselves." Though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not speak of themselves. *Cheng* comments: "Though their vast eloquence flowed like a river, adorning the myriad things, they never spoke of themselves." Though their abilities exhausted all within the seas, they did not act for themselves. *Cheng* comments: "Though their talents surpassed all within the seas, what did they do? Thus Laozi said: 'This is called employing the strength of others.'"

Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success. *Wang Niansun* comments: "*Er Ya* defines *success* as completion. *The Doctrine of the Mean* says: 'They complete without acting.'"*

Thus it is said: Nothing is as spirit-like as Heaven, as abundant as Earth, as great as emperors and kings. Thus it is said: The virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is the Way of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the multitudes of people.

Its root lies above, its branches below; its essentials lie with the ruler, its details with the ministers. The deployment of the three armies and the five weapons—*Cheng* comments: "The five weapons are the bow, staff, spear, dagger-axe, and halberd. Deployment means movement."—is the outermost expression of virtue. Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the application of the five punishments—*Cheng* comments: "Application means law."—are the outermost expression of teaching. Rituals, laws, measures, and standards; forms, names, comparisons, and investigations—*Explanation of Text* notes: "Comparisons mean assessments; investigations mean examinations."—are the outermost expression of governance. The sounds of bells and drums, the postures of feathers and plumes, are the outermost expression of music. Wailing and weeping, mourning garments, the gradations of mourning attire—*Cheng* comments: "Gradations refer to the five degrees of mourning garments, each with its own distinctions. These are the external forms of teaching."—are the outermost expression of grief.

These five outer expressions require the movement of spirit and the activation of the heart’s artifice before they may follow. Such outer expressions were known to the ancients, yet they were not what came first.

*Cheng* comments: "The ancients refer to those of the middle antiquity. *First* means the root."

The lord precedes and the minister follows; the father precedes and the son follows; the elder brother precedes and the younger follows; the elder precedes and the younger follows; the man precedes and the woman follows; the husband precedes and the wife follows. This precedence of honor and humility, of before and after, is the course of Heaven and Earth, and thus the sage takes it as a model. Heaven is honored and Earth is humble—this is the proper position of the numinous. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The transformations and creations of the myriad things, their sprouting and differentiation into forms, *Cheng* comments: "The first signs of growth are distinct, each with its own shape."—these are the flowing currents of flourishing and decline. The gradations of flourishing and decline are the flowing currents of transformation. Though Heaven and Earth are most numinous, they still possess this sequence of honor and humility, of before and after—how much more so the human Dao!

In ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, honor is honored; in village communities, seniority is honored; in conduct, worthiness is honored—this is the sequence of the Great Dao. *Cheng* comments: "The necessary principle of reason."

To speak of the Dao while violating its sequence is not the Dao; to speak of the Dao while not embodying the Dao—how can one claim to grasp the Dao! *Cheng* comments: "Having lost its sequence, it is unfit to govern things."

Thus, those of old who illuminated the Great Dao first illuminated Heaven, and the Dao and its virtue followed. *Cheng* comments: "Nature is the root of the Dao and virtue, hence they follow." Once the Dao and its virtue were illuminated, benevolence and righteousness followed. *Xuan* comments: "Benevolence and righteousness are the threads of the Dao and virtue." Once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, the division of duties followed—superiors and inferiors had their distinctions, and all offices had their responsibilities. Once the division of duties was illuminated, forms and names followed. *Xuan* comments: "The shapes and names of things." Once forms and names were illuminated, the assignment of tasks according to ability followed—appointing tasks based on inherent capacity. Once the assignment of tasks was illuminated, investigation and reflection followed—examining with forgiveness and introspection. Once investigation and reflection were illuminated, right and wrong followed—for only when investigation and reflection are clear can right and wrong be determined. Once right and wrong were illuminated, rewards and punishments followed. *Guo* comments: "The Dao of perfect governance begins with Heaven and reaches its ultimate expression here." Once rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise found their proper places—each was situated appropriately. The noble and the base occupied their stations, each at ease in their position. The benevolent and worthy, the unworthy and flawed, followed their true natures. *Xi* means "to follow"; *qing* means "reality." Each followed their true reality. Abilities were necessarily distinguished, *fen* means "to differentiate," and names were necessarily adhered to. *Xuan* comments: "Demanding reality in accordance with names." With these, one served superiors, nurtured inferiors, governed things, and cultivated the self. Knowledge and scheming were not employed, and one necessarily returned to one’s Heaven-given nature. *Xuan* comments: "Returning to emptiness, stillness, and non-action." This is called Great Peace, the ultimate in governance.

Thus, the ancient records state: "There are forms and names." Forms and names were known to the ancients, yet they were not what came first. Those of old who spoke of the Great Dao underwent five transformations before forms and names could be discussed, and nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be spoken of. From "illuminating Heaven" to "forms and names," there were five transformations in discourse; from there to "rewards and punishments," there were nine transformations. To abruptly speak of forms and names is to be ignorant of the root; to abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to be ignorant of the beginning. To speak in a way that inverts the Dao, or to expound in a manner contrary to the Dao—*Shiwen* notes: "*Wu* is pronounced as *wu*; Sima comments: 'Transverse.'"—this refers to speech that does not follow the proper sequence. Such is what people govern, but it is only fit for petty men who are governed. How could it govern others!

To abruptly speak of forms and names, rewards and punishments—this is to possess the tools of governance but not the Dao of governance. It may be employed in the world, but it is insufficient to employ the world. This is called a sophist, a person of partial understanding. *Cheng* comments: "This refers to those who merely adorn themselves with flowery words, partial and obstinate people of one corner."

Rituals, laws, measures, and standards; forms, names, comparisons, and investigations—these were known to the ancients. They are what inferiors use to serve superiors, not what superiors use to nurture inferiors. What superiors value lies in nourishing the people.

In ancient times, Shun asked Yao: "How does the Son of Heaven apply his heart?" Yao replied: "I do not treat the helpless with arrogance, nor do I dismiss the stubborn people as beyond teaching. I do not abandon the destitute, *Cheng* comments: "Relieving the poor, this heart does not falter." nor do I grieve for the dead. I delight in young children and pity women. *Ku* means "to sorrow for"; *jia* means "to cherish." *Ruzi* are young children. *Ai* means "to pity." This is how I apply my heart." Shun said: "It is fine, yet it is not great." Yao asked: "Then what should it be?" Shun replied: "One embodies the virtue of Heaven and emerges in tranquility. *Guo* comments: "Harmonizing with Heaven’s virtue, one remains still even while active." The sun and moon shine, and the four seasons proceed, as regular as the alternation of day and night. Clouds drift and rain falls." *Guo* comments: "All these occur naturally, without contrivance." *Cheng* comments: "*Jing* means 'constant.'" Yao said: "How entangled and troubled I am! *Jiaojiao* means "fixed and unyielding"; *raorao* means "confused and restless." Moved by Shun’s words, he realized his own busyness. You are in accord with Heaven; I am in accord with man." *Cheng* comments: "Your virtue is far-reaching, in accord with Heaven; my heart is close, aligned with human affairs."

Heaven and Earth are what the ancients held to be greatest, and what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised in common. Thus, those of old who ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply embodied Heaven and Earth.

Confucius deposited his writings in the Zhou archives. *Sima* comments: "He stored his written works there."

Yao comments: "This is also Han-era speech. 'Depositing writings' refers to the sage foreseeing the Qin burning of books and concealing them in advance—what is called 'hiding them in famous mountains.'" Zilu counseled, saying: "I have heard that in Zhou there was an Archivist Sima." *Sima* comments: "Zhengcang was the name of the archive. Another opinion: *zheng* means 'canonical.'" "The archivist was the scribe of the repository. There was one named Lao Dan who resigned and returned home." *Shiwen* notes: "Seeing that the end of Zhou could no longer be rectified, he departed." "If you wish to deposit your writings, Master, you might try going to him for assistance." Thus he suggested entrusting the writings to him. Confucius said: "Very well." He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused—he would not permit the deposit. Thereupon Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him. *Shiwen* notes: "One opinion: the Six Classics—*Odes*, *Documents*, *Changes*, *Rites*, *Music*, and *Spring and Autumn*—together with the Six Weft Texts, make the Twelve Classics. Another opinion: the *Changes*’ upper and lower canons with the Ten Wings make twelve. Yet another: the *Spring and Autumn*’s twelve ducal reigns." Lao Dan was struck by his discourse. *Shiwen* notes: "*Zhong* (struck), read as *dingzhong*." *Cheng* comments: "He acknowledged its reasonableness." *Xuan* comments: "His words were not yet complete." Note: Below it says "too deceitful"—this shows he did not assent. *Cheng*’s explanation is unclear. That he was "struck by his discourse" must mean he had heard only half, hence the following "indeed." He said: "Too deceitful!" *Cheng* comments: "He found it overly verbose and deceitful." *Xuan* comments: "*Man* means 'to deceive,' pronounced *man* in the level tone." Note: Verbosity verges on deceit; he feared much of it was empty words. "I would hear its essentials." Confucius said: "The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness." Lao Dan said: "May I ask: are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?" Confucius said: "Indeed. Without benevolence, the noble man cannot be perfected; without righteousness, he cannot live." *Perfected* and *live* are both spoken in terms of the Dao. "Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of the perfected person—what more could be done?" What else would one do? Lao Dan said: "May I ask what benevolence and righteousness are?" Confucius said: "Joy shared with all things at heart, universal love without partiality—this is the true nature of benevolence and righteousness." *True nature* means reality. Lao Dan said: "Alas! How nearly this resembles later words!" It resembles the speech of later pedantic Confucians. "Is not 'universal love' impractical? 'Without partiality' is itself partial." *Su Yu* comments: "Not forgetting the intent to be impartial is itself partial—this echoes Zhuangzi’s reply to the Grand Steward Dang in the following chapter." "Do you wish, Master, to ensure that the world loses none of its shepherds?" *Sima* comments: "*Mu* means 'to nurture.'" "For Heaven and Earth already have their constancy, sun and moon already have their brightness, stars and constellations already have their ranks, birds and beasts already have their flocks, trees and plants already have their standing. You, Master, need only follow virtue in your conduct and pursue the Dao in your course—you have already arrived. Why then do you so strenuously brandish benevolence and righteousness, as if beating a drum to seek a lost child?" *Shiwen* notes: "*Jiejie* means 'with effort.'" *Cheng* comments: "A lost child is a runaway." Note: *Jie* means "to raise." This passage also appears in the "Revolutions of Heaven" chapter. "Alas!"

"Master, you confuse human nature!"

Guo comments: "To love when matters arise and to stop when righteousness demands—this is to forget benevolence and righteousness. Yet to dwell upon them constantly is to disorder the true."

Xuan notes: "What the Master calls 'aligning with righteousness' and what Mencius terms 'acting through benevolence and righteousness' both express this idea."

Shi Chengqi, having met Laozi, asked: "I have heard that you, Master, are a sage. I did not hesitate to journey from afar, desiring to see you. For a hundred lodgings, my feet bore calluses without rest."

Sima comments: "A hundred lodgings means a hundred nights of stopping."

The *Huainanzi*’s *Xiumu Xun* offers a high note: "*Jian* refers to calluses formed on the feet."

"Now I observe you, Master, and you are no sage. There is surplus grain in the rat’s burrow, yet you discard what your younger sister has left—this is not benevolent."

Guo comments: "This speaks of his disregard for things."

Cheng explains: "*Shurang* refers to soil from a rat’s burrow. *Mei* means 'obscure.'"

Note: Chengqi speaks of what he has witnessed. The surplus grain could be kept, yet he allows it to scatter carelessly across the ground, feigning ignorance—this is not benevolent. Raw and cooked provisions are not exhausted before him,

Cheng explains: "Raw refers to grains and silks; cooked refers to food and drink—all in abundance."

yet he amasses without limit."

He hoards without end.

Laozi remained silent and unresponsive.

Cheng comments: "He deemed it unworthy of reply."

The next day, Shi Chengqi returned and said: "Yesterday, I reproached you, but now my heart has corrected and retreated. My heart is righted and has withdrawn—no longer holding the same base views. Why is this?"

Laozi replied: "Those who are cunning, wise, divine, or sagely—I have long considered myself free of such names. When you called me an ox, I answered as an ox; when you called me a horse, I answered as a horse. If one possesses the reality, yet refuses the name others give, one invites double misfortune. To have the reality but reject its name is to incur repeated harm. My bearing is constant,

Guo comments: "Bearing refers to one’s demeanor and conduct. Not being swayed by praise or blame, one’s countenance remains unchanged."

yet I do not bear it as if it were a burden."

Guo comments: "To act with intention is to be unable to maintain constancy."

Shi Chengqi stepped aside like a goose avoiding its shadow,

Xuan notes: "A description of shifting to the side."

walking in his shoes,

Su Yu comments: "In ancient times, one removed shoes before entering a room and walked on mats. *Lüxing* (walking in shoes) suggests a loss of propriety. When Zhuangzi, his shoes tied with hemp, met the King of Wei, the king marveled at his exhaustion due to his worn shoes being bound with hemp and thus unable to be removed."

and then advanced to ask: "How should one cultivate the self?"

Laozi said: "Your countenance is haughty, standing apart as if superior. Your gaze is piercing, staring straight ahead. Your forehead is prominent,

The *Shiwen* notes: "*Kui* is pronounced *qugui*; some texts write it as *xian*."

Cheng comments: "A high and lofty forehead, adorned with ostentatious embellishment."

your mouth gapes open,

Guo comments: "A wide and open appearance."

and your demeanor is imposing."

*Yi* is read as *e*; see the *Da Zongshi* chapter.

"You are like a horse tethered in place,

Xuan notes: "Your ambition is to gallop."

restrained in movement,

Xuan notes: "You wish to move but forcibly restrain yourself."

quick as a crossbow’s trigger,

Xuan notes: "Your actions are swift as a mechanism."

scrutinizing and meticulous. Your cleverness and skill are displayed in arrogance. All this is deemed untrustworthy."

Guo Songtao comments: "All these traits are discordant with natural nature—this is what is called untrustworthy."

"There are such people at the borders—they are called thieves."

Sima comments: "This refers to such people existing in distant lands."

*Qie* means "thief."

The Master said—

Cheng comments: "Zhuangzi refers to Laozi as Master."

"The Dao, in its greatness, is not exhaustive; in its smallness, it is not neglected.

Xuan notes: "It encompasses the boundless and enters the infinitesimal."

Thus, the ten thousand things are complete. Vast and expansive, it admits all without exception—

*Guangguang* is akin to *kuangkuang*; see the *Han Shu*’s *Wu Wuzhi Zhuan*.

deep and unfathomable. Form, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the vestiges of spirit—

Cheng comments: "The traces left by spirit."

who but the perfected person can stabilize them?

Xuan notes: "Few in the world are not deluded by superficial learning."

The perfected person possesses the world—is this not grand? Yet it is not enough to burden them. The world may strive, but they do not join in its pursuits.

The *Shuowen* notes: "*Bing* may also be written with the radical *shou*."

The world contends for power and influence, yet they alone do not partake. They are certain of what requires no borrowing and do not shift with profit. They embrace reality and do not alter for harmony. They exhaust the truth of things and preserve their essence—

Cheng comments: "They fully grasp principle and exhaust nature, moving without disturbing stillness."

thus, they leave Heaven and Earth behind, forsake the ten thousand things, and their spirit is never constrained. They penetrate the Dao, align with virtue, set aside benevolence and righteousness, and cast off ritual and music—

Yu comments: "*Bin* is read as *bin*, meaning to reject. It refers to casting aside ritual and music. The characters *bin* and *bin* were interchangeable in ancient times."

the heart of the perfected person is settled."

The world values the Dao in written form, yet writing is but speech, and speech holds value. What is valued in speech is meaning, and meaning follows something beyond. What meaning follows cannot be transmitted through words, yet the world prizes the transmission of words through writing. Though the world values this, I still do not deem it worthy—for what it values is not true value.

Guo comments: "True value always lies beyond words and speech."

Thus, what can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas! The world believes forms, colors, names, and sounds suffice to grasp the essence of the Dao!

If forms, colors, names, and sounds truly do not suffice to grasp its essence—

Yan comments: "‘That’ refers to the Dao; ‘essence’ means reality."

—then those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know. How could the world recognize this?

Duke Huan was reading in the hall while Bian, the wheelwright, was hewing a wheel below. Setting aside his hammer and chisel, Bian ascended and asked the duke, "May I dare ask what words Your Lordship is reading?"

The duke replied, "The words of the sages."

Bian asked, "Are the sages still alive?"

The duke said, "They have already died."

Bian said, "Then what Your Lordship reads is but the dregs and lees of the ancients!"

Sima comments: "Dregs rot into lees."

Another version reads *husks*.

Duke Huan said, "I am reading—how can a wheelwright presume to criticize? If you have an explanation, it may be acceptable; if not, you shall die."

Wheelwright Bian said, "Your servant observes this through his own craft. When hewing a wheel, if done too slowly, it is loose and insecure; if too swiftly, it is tight and will not fit. Neither too slow nor too fast—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart. The mouth cannot express it, yet a method resides within. Li comments: "Method, or technique."

I cannot make my son understand it, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, though I am seventy years old, I still hew wheels in my old age.

Cheng comments: "This shows that each thing has its own nature, which cannot be imitated."

The ancients and what they could not transmit—

Yan comments: "The same as above."

—have perished. Then what Your Lordship reads is but the dregs and lees of the ancients!"

**Outer Chapters, "Heaven’s Revolutions" (Chapter Fourteen)**

Does Heaven revolve?
Guo comments: "It does not revolve yet moves of itself."

Does Earth abide?
Guo comments: "It does not abide yet rests of itself."

Do the sun and moon contend for their places?
Guo comments: "They do not contend yet alternate of themselves."

Who directs this? Who governs this?

Who sits idle yet sets these in motion?
These three lines respectively correspond to "Heaven," "Earth," and "the sun and moon."

Is it that there is some mechanism, some inevitability at work?
Cheng comments: "Mechanism refers to a hinge; inevitability, to a closure. It means there is a governing hinge and closure, and things proceed of necessity."

Or is it that they revolve and turn yet cannot stop themselves?
Does the cloud make the rain? Does the rain make the cloud?
Who causes this swelling and pouring forth?
Xuan comments: "Swelling refers to the rising of clouds; pouring forth, to the falling of rain."

Who sits idle, indulging in excess and joy, yet urges these on?
Xuan comments: "Clouds and rain arise from the harmonious intermingling of yin and yang qi, thus they are seen as the wanton delight of creation."

The wind rises in the north, now west, now east, drifting upward in restless motion—
Sima’s text reads "panghuang," explaining: "A whirlwind."
—who exhales and inhales this?
Who sits idle yet scatters and stirs this?
May I ask the reason?

Wu Xian Zhao says:
Li comments: "Wu Xian was a minister of Yin. Zhao is an appended name."
Xuan comments: "Zhao is likely a corruption of 'zhao' (to summon). It is said that Wu Xian, the minister, was summoned to answer."

"Come! I will tell you."

Heaven possesses the Six Ultimates and the Five Constants—
Sima comments: "The Six Ultimates are the four directions, above, and below."
Cheng comments: "The Five Constants refer to the Five Phases."

When emperors and kings align with them, there is order; when they oppose them, there is calamity. The affairs of the Ninefold Luo bring governance to completion and virtue to fulfillment, illuminating the lands below—
Yang Shen comments: "The Ninefold Luo refers to the Nine Categories of the Luo River Chart."

All under heaven revere them; this is called the Supreme Sovereign.

Guo Songtao comments: "The movement of Heaven is simply natural. Emperors and kings align with this naturalness, responding through the Dao."

The Grand Steward Dang of Song questioned Zhuangzi about benevolence.
Sima comments: "Song refers to the state of Song. Grand Steward is an office; Dang is his name."

Zhuangzi said: "Tigers and wolves are benevolent."
Dang asked: "What do you mean?"
Zhuangzi said: "Father and son cherish one another—how is this not benevolent?"
Dang said: "May I ask about perfect benevolence?"
Zhuangzi said: "Perfect benevolence has no partiality."
The Grand Steward said: "Dang has heard that without partiality there is no love, and without love there is no filial piety. Can one say that perfect benevolence is unfilial?"
Zhuangzi said: "Not so. Perfect benevolence is lofty indeed; filial piety is simply insufficient to describe it. Filial piety is but one aspect of benevolence. This is not a statement that surpasses filial piety, but one that does not yet reach it. As you claim, taking partial love as perfect benevolence—this is not a statement that surpasses filial piety, but one that does not yet reach it. Consider one traveling south to Ying: facing north, they cannot see Mount Ming—
Sima comments: "Mount Ming is a mountain in the Northern Sea."
—why is this? Because it lies too far away."

"The analogy of taking partial love as perfect benevolence is thus made. Therefore, it is said: to practice filial piety through reverence is easy; to practice it through love is difficult. To practice filial piety through love is easy; to forget one’s kin is difficult. To forget one’s kin is easy; to make one’s kin forget me is difficult. To make one’s kin forget me is easy; to forget all under Heaven is difficult. To forget all under Heaven is easy; to make all under Heaven forget me is difficult.

Virtue leaves Yao and Shun behind without effort—possessing the virtue of Yao and Shun yet not deliberately emulating them—this is my forgetting of all under Heaven. Benefit and grace extend to ten thousand generations, yet none in the world know it—this is the world forgetting me. How could one merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety? Benevolence and filial piety are not worth mentioning.

Filial piety and brotherly love, benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust, integrity and incorruptibility—these are all self-exhortations that enslave one’s virtue. Such things are not worthy of praise. Therefore, it is said: the most noble casts aside state-bestowed ranks; the most wealthy casts aside state-held wealth. The deepest aspiration casts aside fame and reputation. The deepest aspiration lies in knowing one’s nature and attaining harmony, while fame and reputation are not worth speaking of. Thus, the Dao remains unchanging."

Master Beimen Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor: "When the Emperor performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of Dongting, I first heard it with fear, then heard it with weariness, and finally heard it in confusion. Vast and silent, I could no longer find myself."

The Emperor said: "You were nearly right! I perform it with human affairs, verify it with Heaven, conduct it with ritual and righteousness, and establish it upon the Great Purity. The supreme music first responds to human affairs, accords with Heaven’s principle, is enacted through the Five Virtues, and answers to nature. Only then does it harmonize the four seasons and bring perfect harmony to the myriad things."

The vulgar editions have杂入 these passages." The four seasons arise in succession—"the five notes correspond to the four seasons and continue in endless succession." The myriad things follow their cycles of birth—"the various instruments imitate the myriad things and revolve in ceaseless performance." Now flourishing, now declining, their patterns of civil and martial order unfold; "Ethics (lún) refers to principle; constancy (jīng) to the unchanging. Summer flourishes while winter declines; spring is civil while autumn is martial—this principle of generation and destruction is the eternal Dao of Heaven." Now clear, now turbid, yin and yang harmonize, their sounds flowing with radiant brilliance; "Clear and turbid blend as the two qi unite; when they interact, their luminous splendor overflows." When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder; its end has no tail, its beginning no head; now dying, now living, now collapsing, now rising. What is constant knows no end, yet not one moment can be awaited.

Guo Songtao says: "The rise of thunder reveals neither its origin nor its conclusion. Its origin is the head, the inception of life; its conclusion is the tail, the return of death. Death and life are the great constancies of the myriad things, infinite as Heaven itself—yet when a single moment suddenly arrives, even things cannot await it. This illustrates how music’s transformations arise from nature."

Yu Yue says: "That which 'cannot be awaited' means nothing can be awaited. The character *yī* (一) here carries the sense of 'all,' as seen in the *Lú* commentary to the *Dà Dài Lǐjì* and the *Yáng* commentary to the *Xúnzǐ*."

Guo Xiang says: "When change itself is taken as constant, what is constant becomes endless." Thus, you were afraid.

I then perform it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of sun and moon—"what is called employing the Dao of Heaven." Its sounds can be short or long, soft or hard; their transformations are uniform yet not bound to fixed patterns. In the valley, it fills the valley; in the ravine, it fills the ravine—"the Dao of supreme music leaves nothing unpervaded." It seals the gaps and guards the spirit; "Gaps (xì) share the same meaning as 'crevices.' It blocks the apertures of the heart’s knowledge and preserves the spirit of concentrated unity." It takes things as its measure—referring to the meaning of the two preceding lines about "filling the valley."

Its sounds surge and spread, "what is called unfolding harmony." "Surge (huī) means movement; spread (chuò) means breadth. Like thunder’s reverberation, its sounds are vast and expansive." Its name is lofty and luminous. "Lofty as the heavens above, luminous as the sun and moon; since its sounds are so vast, its name is equally lofty and bright."

Thus, ghosts and spirits guard their hidden realms—"each attains its proper place without interference, as the *Laozi* says: 'When the Dao benefits the world, its ghosts do not haunt.'" The sun, moon, and stars follow their celestial paths—"without deviating from their courses."

I halt it at what is bounded, yet let it flow into what knows no end. Su Yu says: "What is bounded, I join in its boundedness; what knows no end, I join in its endlessness—halting and flowing both follow nature."

I wish to ponder it but cannot comprehend it, to gaze upon it but cannot see it, to pursue it but cannot reach it. Helplessly, I stand upon the Way of the fourfold emptiness—"helplessly (tǎngrán) describes a state without intention, standing upon the vast emptiness of the four directions." Leaning against a withered catalpa, I chant. (See the *Qiwù Lùn*.)

The eyes exhaust their vision in what they wish to see, strength falters in what it seeks to pursue—I can no longer keep up! The body fills the void, even to the point of meandering. You meander, thus you grow weary. Su Yu says: "You follow the music’s meandering and thus grow weary."

I then perform it with sounds that know no weariness, tuning it to the mandate of nature—"for all living things, nature is their inherent mandate. When this music is performed, it harmonizes the heart of creation and aligns with the natural mandate of all things."

Thus, it seems to mingle and chase in tangled profusion, like a forest of music without form; Guo Songtao says: "The *Shuōwén* defines a cluster of trees as a *lín* (forest). *Línlè* means rejoicing together. The five notes converge in abundance, their origins indistinguishable—hence, 'without form.'" It spreads and scatters without trailing—dispersing and flourishing as if trailing yet never trailing. It dwells in darkness without sound—"its sounds are subtle."

The movement knows no fixed direction, dwelling in profound obscurity;
Some call it death, some call it life;
Some call it substance, some call it flourishing.
Flowing, scattering, shifting—no sound remains constant.
Guo says: "It transforms with things."

The world doubts this, examining it through the sage.
*Ji* means to investigate.
By observing the sage, one knows the wonder of supreme music—no need for doubt.
The sage is one who penetrates the essence of things and fulfills their mandate.
Cheng says: "One who comprehends the essence of all things and follows the mandate of nature is called a sage."

The celestial mechanism is not displayed, yet the five organs are all complete—this is called celestial music.
Guo says: "Joy is sufficient without display; completeness does not depend on tension."
Without words, the heart is delighted.
Guo says: "Delight lies in harmony, not in speech."

Thus, the Yan Clan composed a hymn for it.
Cheng says: "Yan refers to Shennong."
*Shiwen* notes: "*Yan* is also written as *Yan*."
*"Hear it yet perceive no sound,
See it yet discern no form,
Filling heaven and earth,
Enveloping the six directions."*
Such is the hymn to this music.

You wish to hear it yet find no means to grasp it—hence your confusion.
*Er* here refers to you.
Music begins with awe; awe gives rise to dread.
Before great harmony is achieved, listening induces terror, as if facing misfortune.

I then follow it with weariness; weariness leads to withdrawal.
Its sounds fade into nothingness, as if unwilling to be heard, inducing lassitude.
Finally, it ends in confusion; confusion gives rise to foolishness.
Foolishness accords with the Dao.
Cheng says: "With a mind free of distinctions, akin to darkness and delusion, vast and silent—this resembles the true Dao."

The Dao can be carried and journeyed with.
Su Yu says: "Taking the undifferentiated as the Dao, weariness nearly approaches foolishness, and thus the Dao may be encountered.
This chapter’s emphasis lies here."

Confucius journeyed west to Wei.
Cheng comments: "From Lu to Wei, hence called a westward journey."
Yan Yuan asked Master Jin,
Li notes: "Master was the Grand Music Master of Lu; Jin was his name,"
saying: "What of your Master’s conduct?"
Master Jin replied: "Alas! Your Master is doomed to distress!"
Yan Yuan asked: "Why?"
Master Jin said: "Before the straw dogs are set out,
Li notes: "Straw bound into dogs, used by shamans and invocators,"
they are stored in fine baskets,
Li notes: "Yan, a bamboo container,"
wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the corpse-invokers fast and purify themselves to present them.
Yet once they have been set out, passersby tread upon their heads and spines, and gatherers take them to burn as fuel.
Li notes: "Su refers to straw; gatherers use them for cooking."
Should one then take them again, store them in fine baskets, wrap them in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath them, they would not escape nightmares—indeed, they would suffer repeated afflictions.
*Shiwen* notes: "*Zilin* says: 'Mi occurs when something enters the eye as an ailment.' Sima says: 'It means oppression.'"
Cheng comments: "Even if one avoids evil dreams, one would surely suffer repeated demonic torments."

Now your Master has taken the straw dogs of the former kings, already set out,
Yu notes: "This *qu* should be read as *ju* ('gather'), as in the *Shiwen* of the *Yi*'s *Cui* hexagram and the Han Shu’s *Wu Xing Zhi* commentary by Yan."
and gathers disciples to wander and rest beneath them.
Thus he was felled like a tree in Song, his traces erased in Wei, and found himself in dire straits in Shang and Zhou—was this not his nightmare?
Besieged between Chen and Cai, seven days without cooked food, life and death as close as neighbors—was this not his affliction?

In water, nothing surpasses the use of a boat; on land, nothing surpasses the use of a cart.
Yet to take a boat’s suitability for water and seek to push it on land is to spend a lifetime moving no more than a few paces.
Eight feet make a *xun*; twice a *xun* makes a *chang*.
Are past and present not like water and land?
Are Zhou and Lu not like boat and cart?
Now to seek to enact Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious yet fruitless, and one’s person will surely meet with calamity.
He does not understand the transmission without fixed direction,
Sima notes: "Fang means constancy."
Guo Qingfan notes: "The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Bi Ji* chapter glosses *zhuan* as 'turning.' It refers to turning without fixed direction."
the response to things that knows no exhaustion.

Have you alone not seen the well-sweep?
Pull it, and it bows; release it, and it rises.
It is pulled by people, not the one pulling people—thus it bows and rises without offending anyone.
Therefore, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for their sameness but for their efficacy in governance.
Cheng comments: "Jin means to esteem. Rituals and music, dignity and deportment, were not handed down unchanged."
Guo comments: "They aimed to suit the times and respond to the needs of governance."
Thus the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are like the crabapple, pear, orange, and pomelo—
their flavors differ, yet all are pleasing to the mouth.
Thus rites, righteousness, laws, and standards are things that change with the times.

Now take a gibbon and dress it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou—it will surely bite, gnaw, tear, and rend them, casting them off entirely before it is satisfied.
*Shiwen* notes: "Li says: 'Qian means satisfaction. Originally also written as *xian*.'"
To observe the differences between past and present is like the difference between a gibbon and the Duke of Zhou.
Thus when Xishi clutched her heart in distress and knit her brows in her village,
her village’s ugly woman saw and admired it, returning home to clutch her heart and knit her brows in the same way.
The rich of her village, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and refused to go out;
the poor, seeing this, took their wives and children and fled.
She knew the beauty of knitting her brows but did not know *why* it was beautiful.
Alas! Your Master is doomed to distress!"

When Confucius reached the age of fifty-one without having heard the Dao, he journeyed south to Pei and sought out Lao Dan.
Sima [Biao] notes: "Laozi was a man of the district of Xiang in the state of Chen. Xiang is now part of Ku County and lies near Pei."
Lao Dan said: "Have you come, sir? I have heard that you are a worthy man of the north—have you also attained the Dao?"
Confucius replied: "I have not."
Laozi asked: "How then have you sought it?"
Confucius said: "I sought it in measures and numbers, but after five years I had not attained it."
Laozi asked: "How else have you sought it?"
Confucius said: "I sought it in the principles of yin and yang, but after twelve years I had not attained it."
Laozi said: "Just so. If the Dao could be offered, none would fail to offer it to their lord; if the Dao could be presented, none would fail to present it to their kin; if the Dao could be told to others, none would fail to tell it to their brothers; if the Dao could be given to others, none would fail to give it to their descendants. Yet this cannot be—there is no other reason: inwardly, without a master, it does not abide; if the center lacks a master, the Dao passes through without lingering. Outwardly, without a match, it does not proceed.
Yu [Yue] notes: "'Match' is a scribal error for *pi*. The *Ziyi* of the *Li Ji* states, 'Only the noble man can love his *pi*,' and Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains: '*Pi* should be *match*, a scribal error.' This is one such example. These two lines resemble the *Gongyang Zhuan* on Duke Xuan’s third year: 'That which issues from within has no match and does not proceed; that which comes from without has no master and does not abide.' Since that which comes from without has no master and does not abide, this text says, 'Inwardly, without a master, it does not abide.' Since that which issues from within has no match and does not proceed, this text says, 'Outwardly, without a match, it does not proceed.' Thus, in the 'Yang' chapter, 'That which enters from without has a master and is not grasped; that which issues from within has a match and is not resisted'—here, too, *match* should be *pi*, an error like the one above."
That which issues from within is not received from without—
Xuan [Ying] notes: "It is not fitting for the times, and so is not received."
—the sage does not put it forth.
Xuan notes: "He does not impose it upon others."
That which enters from without has no master within—
Xuan notes: "It is not the essence of my heart, and so has no master."
—the sage does not conceal it. Not hiding it in the heart, one must inwardly attain the essence of one’s heart and outwardly accord with the changes and transformations of the times, so that inner and outer converge as one, essence and function unite, and the sage thereby harmonizes with the Dao.
A name is a public instrument—one cannot take too much of it. Benevolence and righteousness are the travelers’ lodges of the former kings—
Sima [Biao] notes: "A travelers’ lodge is like a waystation."
—one may stay for a single night but cannot dwell there long, for frequent encounters bring many reproaches.
Xuan notes: "The more one meets, the more one is blamed."
The perfected men of old borrowed the Way from benevolence and lodged in righteousness, roaming the emptiness of carefree wandering, feeding in the fields of simplicity, standing in the gardens of non-bestowal.
Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "*Gou* means 'temporary,' *jian* means 'simple.' *Dai* means 'to bestow.' Knowing contentment, they fed in the fields of simplicity; not depleting their own resources, they stood in the gardens of non-bestowal. The text speaks of fields and gardens to show that these are the places where the sage nurtures life."
Carefree wandering is non-action; simplicity is ease of nurture; non-bestowal is no expenditure.
Xuan notes: "No cost."
The ancients called this the wandering of gathering the true.
Xuan notes: "Not enslaved by appearances."
Those who take wealth as right cannot yield emolument; those who take prominence as right cannot yield fame; those who cling to power cannot share authority. Grasping it, they tremble—
Cheng notes: "Fearful of losing it, they tremble."
—releasing it, they grieve.
Xuan notes: "They cling to it greedily."
Yet they see nothing in it to reflect upon—
Xuan notes: "They see nothing of principle in it."
—only gazing at what they cannot cease pursuing.
Xuan notes: "They are only clear about the relentless pursuit of things."
These are the people Heaven punishes.
Cheng notes: "Though no punishment from Chu has been applied, their nature is already exhausted."
Resentment, kindness, taking, giving, remonstrance, instruction, life, and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification.
Xuan notes: "The tools for setting others right."
Only those who follow great change without obstruction can employ them. Thus it is said: "To rectify is to set right."
Xuan notes: "To set right what ought to be set right."
If one’s heart does not accept this, the gate of Heaven will not open."
Cheng notes: "If one’s heart cannot be thus, the gate of the celestial mechanism is blocked and will not open. The gate of Heaven is the heart."

Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: "When chaff gets in the eye, heaven and earth and the four directions seem to shift places; when mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep through the night.
Sima [Biao] notes: "*Zan* means 'to bite.'"
Guo [Xiang] notes: "Though the external thing that afflicts one is small, the harm to one’s nature is great."
Note: *Xi* means 'night.' *Xi* and *xi* are interchangeable.
Benevolence and righteousness are so harsh that they agitate the heart—there is no greater disorder.
Xuan notes: "They disturb the heart more severely than chaff in the eye or bites on the skin."
You, sir, would have the world not lose its uncarved simplicity—
Guo notes: "Preserve wholeness and let benevolence and righteousness manifest."
—you, too, should move with the wind and act, gathering virtue and standing firm."
Xuan notes: "Return to the natural."

And why should one act so strenuously, as if carrying a war drum in search of a lost child?
Cheng notes: "*Jieran* describes the appearance of exertion."
Note: The *Tiandao* chapter quotes Laozi’s words, also saying, "Why so zealously brandish benevolence and righteousness, like striking a drum to seek a lost child?"—its meaning is the same, referring to startling the world.

The swan does not bathe daily to become white, nor the crow dye itself daily to become black.
Xuan notes: "This illustrates how their original nature is thus by itself."
The simplicity of black and white is not sufficient to serve as distinction;
Xuan notes: "What arises from original nature cannot be judged as beauty or ugliness."
The spectacle of fame and reputation is not sufficient to enlarge one’s being.
The beauty of fame and reputation cannot add to or broaden one’s inherent nature.

When the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on dry land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—yet how much better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes!
Xuan notes: "This illustrates how petty kindnesses are inferior to forgetting one another in primal chaos, where each finds joy in what is naturally so. Why then cling to the paltriness of benevolence and righteousness?"
Note: These four lines also appear in the *Da Zongshi* chapter.

Confucius, having visited Lao Dan, returned and did not speak for three days.
Xuan notes: "He was ill at ease."
His disciples asked, "Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what correction did you receive?"
Xuan notes: "What correction did you seek to apply?"
Confucius said, "Only now have I truly seen the dragon! The dragon coalesces into form, scatters into pattern, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gaped open and could not close—how could I presume to instruct Lao Dan?"

Zigong said, "Then does man indeed possess the power to dwell like a corpse yet manifest the dragon’s presence, to thunder like thunder yet remain as silent as the abyss?"—these two lines also appear in the *Zai You* chapter. "Can one act with the dynamism of heaven and earth? May I, too, observe this?"
He then announced Confucius’s arrival to Lao Dan.
Xuan notes: "He introduced Confucius in advance."
Lao Dan, lounging in the hall, responded in a faint voice:
"As the years pass and my life advances—
*Yun* means 'to move,' *wang* means 'to progress.' My advancing years have already passed.
—what admonition do you bring me?"

Zigong said, "The Three Kings and Five Emperors governed the world differently, yet their attachment to fame and reputation was the same. Why, Master, do you alone consider them not sages?"
Cheng notes: "He means Laozi rejects the Three Kings as sages."
*Shiwen* notes: "Some versions read 'Three August Ones.' According to the commentary, 'Three Kings' is correct; the rest read 'Three August Ones.'"

Lao Dan said, "Young man, come closer! Why do you say they were different?"
He replied, "..."

Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu; Yu relied on strength while Tang used arms. King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose him, and King Wu opposed Zhou without willing to submit—thus they were not the same."

Lao Dan said, "Young man, come closer! Let me tell you of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors’ governance of the world. In the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world, he made the people’s hearts unified: when their kin died, they did not weep, yet none among the people condemned it."
Cheng notes: "The Three August Ones practiced the Dao, and the people’s hearts were pure and unified. They did not favor only their own kin or cherish only their own children, so when kin died, they did not weep, and the world did not condemn it. If one insisted on condemning it, those who forced themselves to weep would be many."

"In Yao’s governance of the world, he made the people’s hearts affectionate: when they killed for their kin, none among the people condemned it."
Xuan notes: "Desiring to honor their kin, they demoted all others, and thus their awareness gradually opened."

"In Shun’s governance of the world, he made the people’s hearts competitive: pregnant women gave birth in ten months, and children could speak at five months."
Cheng notes: "In ancient times, pregnant women carried their children for fourteen months before giving birth, and children only began to speak at two years old. Now, this differs from antiquity."
"Before they could even babble, they began to distinguish others."
Cheng notes: "Before they could laugh as infants, they already discerned right and wrong."
Guo notes: "*Shui* means to differentiate people."
Xuan notes: "The primordial *qi* withered early."

"In Yu’s governance of the world, he made the people’s hearts mutable: people had intentions, and warfare had its justifications."
Xuan notes: "People had cunning, and killing was seen as aligning with Heaven and following the people."
"Killing thieves was not considered killing."
Xuan notes: "They deemed it natural."
"People formed their own factions, and thus the world took shape—each forming their own cliques to constitute the world. As a result, the world was greatly alarmed, and the Confucians and Mohists all arose."
Cheng notes: "Alarming the world led the Confucians to exalt Yao and Shun to conceal their faults, and the Mohists to follow Yu’s way and justify themselves."

"Their beginnings had order, but now even women—though their beginnings still had principles, what is practiced today is that men adopt the ways of women. What can be said of this! Let me tell you: the governance of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors was called ‘governance,’ yet no disorder was greater. The wisdom of the Three Kings—here, *Three August Ones* should read *Three Kings*, otherwise it is incoherent—obstructed the brightness of the sun and moon above, severed the essence of mountains and rivers below, and disrupted the operations of the four seasons in between. Their knowledge was more cruel than the sting of a scorpion’s tail."
Wang Yinzhi notes: "*Chai* and *chan* are both alternative names for scorpions. The *Guangya* states, ‘*Chai* and *chan* are scorpions’ (the present edition omits the character *chan*; the *Zhongjing yinyi* vol. 5 cites ‘*chai* are scorpions,’ and the *Jiyun* cites ‘*chan* are *chai*’). Pronounced *luda*. *Chai* and *chan* are names for venomous stings that harm people. *Chai* is cognate with *zhe* (pronounced *zhe*), and *chan* with *la*. The *Guangya Shigu* states, ‘*Du*, *zhe*, and *la* mean pain,’ which is their meaning. *Zhe* and *chan* share the same ancient pronunciation. *Zhe* and *chan* are the same character. In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the *Qin Benji* reads ‘Duke Ligong,’ while the *Shihuang Benji* writes ‘Duke Lagong.’ *La* interchangeably written as *li* is like *chan* interchangeably written as *zhe*."

"Like ravenous beasts—*xian’gui* is unclear, but likely refers to man-eating creatures—none could secure the tranquility of their nature and life, yet they still considered themselves sages. Is this not shameful? How utterly shameless!"

Gongzi was visibly unsettled, shifting uneasily where he stood. Confucius said to Lao Dan, “I have studied the Six Classics—*Shi*, *Shu*, *Li*, *Yue*, *Yi*, and *Chunqiu*—for so long that I believed I had thoroughly grasped their essence. Yet after expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the traces of Zhou and Shao to seventy-two rulers, not a single one took up my teachings. How profoundly difficult it is to persuade others! Is the Dao so hard to illuminate?”

Laozi replied, “Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age! The Six Classics are but the worn traces of the former kings—how could they be the very essence that produced those traces? What you speak of are still only traces. Traces are what the shoe leaves behind, but are traces the shoe itself?

When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils remain still, yet they conceive through the wind’s influence.” Sima Biao notes, “They transform by responding to the wind’s qi.” He also says, “They gaze and thereby form yin and yang.” Xuan comments, “‘Remain still’ means fixing their eyes unwaveringly.” *Note: Here, ‘wind’ should be read as in ‘horses and cattle mate by the wind,’ referring to the mutual attraction of male and female.* ‘Transform’ means they are moved to conceive. Insects, too, with the male calling from the upwind and the female responding from downwind, conceive through the wind’s influence.” Xuan comments, “They transmit sound and thereby conceive.” Some creatures are self-sufficient as both male and female, thus they conceive through the wind’s influence. The *Shiwen* cites the *Shanhaijing*: “On Danyuan Mountain there is a beast resembling a leopard but with fur, called the *shilei*; on Dai Mountain there is a bird resembling a phoenix with five-colored markings, called the *qilei*—both are self-sufficient as male and female.”

Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed—these are the unchanging truths. Time cannot be halted, the Dao cannot be obstructed—these are the ceaseless transformations. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be done; if one loses it, there is nothing that can be done.” Guo comments, “Even in transformation without fixed form, all is possible.” “Wherever it is lost, nothing is possible.”

Three months later, Confucius reappeared and said, “I have grasped it! Crows and magpies hatch their young; fish spawn in foam.” Li notes, “They conceive by coating their mouths with foam.” “Slender-waisted creatures transform.” The *Liezi* *Shiwen*, citing Sima, explains, “The young of slender-waisted wasps take silkworm grubs, enchant them, and raise them as their own offspring.” “A younger brother weeps when his elder brother is born, fearing the loss of his parents’ love.” This illustrates the vast differences in the natures of things.

For so long, I have not been one with the transformations of humanity! If I cannot be one with the workings of creation, how can I transform others?”

Laozi said, “Good. You have grasped it.”

**Chapter Fifteen: Carving Intentions (Outer Chapters)**

Those who carve their intentions and exalt their conduct do so with severe rigor; their conduct is lofty and noble. They distance themselves from the world and reject its customs, voicing lofty critiques and resentful reproaches. Li notes, “They condemn the world’s lack of the Dao and resent their own failure to meet with it.” This is but defiance for its own sake—such are the scholars of mountain valleys, those who hold the world in contempt. Xuan comments, “‘Hold in contempt’ means to regard it lightly.” These are the pursuits of those who wither away or plunge into the abyss. Sima notes, “Those who wither away, like Bao Jiao or Jie Zitui; those who plunge into the abyss, like Shentu Di.”

Those who speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, who practice reverence, frugality, and deference, do so merely to cultivate themselves. These are the scholars of orderly times, the teachers of humanity. Cheng comments, “These are the scholars of peaceful eras, those who instruct others—like Confucius dwelling by the Zhu and Si rivers, or Zixia in the West River.” These are the pursuits of wandering scholars and recluses.

Those who discourse on great achievements, establish grand reputations, uphold the rites between ruler and minister, and rectify the hierarchy of superior and inferior do so merely to govern. These are the scholars of the court, those who honor their lord and strengthen the state—pursuits favored by those who seek to annex rival states.

Those who retreat to marshes and lakes, dwell in seclusion and open spaces, fish and idle in tranquility, do so merely to practice nonaction. Xuan comments, “Nonaction here means idleness and leisure.” These are the scholars of rivers and seas, those who flee the world—pursuits favored by the carefree.

Those who practice exhaling and inhaling, expelling the old and drawing in the new, emulate the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching. Cheng comments, “They exhale the cold and expel the old, inhale the warm and draw in the new—like a bear climbing a tree and hanging from it, or a bird soaring in the sky and stretching its limbs.” They do so merely to prolong life. These are the practitioners of *daoyin*, those who nurture the body. Such are the pursuits of those who, like Pengzu, seek long life.

Yet there are those who attain loftiness without carving their intentions, cultivate themselves without benevolence or righteousness, govern without achievements or fame, find leisure without retreating to rivers or seas, and prolong life without *daoyin*. They forget nothing, yet possess all things. Guo comments, “By forgetting, they are able to possess.” Serene and boundless, all beauties follow them. Xuan comments, “Without fixing on any single extreme, all excellences are complete.” This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.

Thus it is said: Tranquility and indifference are one and the same—stillness, emptiness, nonbeing, and nonaction. This is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the essence of the Dao and virtue. The *Shiwen* notes, “Essence here means correctness.” Xuan comments, “The root.”

Thus it is said: The sage rests, and in resting attains equilibrium and ease. *Shiwen* notes, “Rest means repose.” Yu comments, “The original text reads, ‘Thus it is said: The sage rests, and in resting attains equilibrium and ease.’ The transposition of ‘rests’ and ‘thus’ is a later scribal error. The *Tian Dao* chapter states, ‘Thus the Thearch, the king, and the sage rest, and in resting attain emptiness,’ which follows a similar structure and may be used to correct this passage.” Guo’s commentary, Cheng’s subcommentary, and Lu’s annotations all preserve only the single word “rest,” and Yu’s emendation is correct—this is an error in later printed editions.

In equilibrium and ease, they attain tranquility and indifference. In equilibrium, ease, tranquility, and indifference, cares and afflictions cannot enter, and perverse *qi* cannot assail. Thus their virtue remains whole, and their spirit does not wane.

Thus it is said: In life, the sage moves with the Heavenly course. Guo comments, “They move in accord with spontaneity.” In death, they transform with things. Guo comments, “They shed their form without attachment.” In stillness, they share the virtue of *yin*; in motion, they share the wave of *yang*. Guo comments, “In movement and stillness, they are without intention, entrusting themselves to *yin* and *yang*.” (These four lines also appear in the *Tian Dao* chapter.)

They do not precede fortune, nor do they initiate misfortune. They respond only after being stirred, act only under compulsion, and rise only when there is no alternative. They discard knowledge and artifice—*Guanzi*’s *Xin Shu* chapter states, “Discard knowledge and artifice,” and this passage adopts its phrasing. The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhu Shu* chapter glosses, “Artifice means cunning.” They follow the principle of Heaven. Cheng comments, “Follow means to accord with.” Thus they incur no Heaven-sent disasters, no entanglements with things, no human reproach, and no ghostly blame. (These four lines also appear in the *Tian Dao* chapter. In that text, “disasters” is written as “resentments.”)

In life, they drift like a floating leaf; in death, they rest like a returning traveler. They do not scheme in thought, nor plan in advance.

Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not demanding—*Xuan* comments, “Without intent to claim certainty.” They sleep without dreaming, wake without worry; their spirit is pure and unalloyed, their ethereal soul never wearied. (These lines also appear in the *Tian Dao* chapter.) Empty and tranquil, they accord with Heaven’s virtue.

Thus it is said: sorrow and joy are virtue’s deviations; delight and anger are the Way’s transgressions; likes and dislikes are virtue’s losses. Therefore, a heart free of sorrow and joy is virtue’s perfection—*Guo* comments, “Supreme virtue is ever at ease, so emotions find no purchase.” Unchanging unity is quiescence’s perfection—*Guo* comments, “Quiescent and unified, it cannot be altered.” Encountering nothing contrary is emptiness’s perfection—*Guo* comments, “The mind utterly open and exhausted, without the slightest resistance.” Unmingled with things is tranquility’s perfection—*Guo* comments, “Things come of themselves; the supremely tranquil harbors no impulse to engage.” *Xuan* notes: *tan* (惔) is synonymous with *dan* (淡). Meeting nothing adverse is purity’s perfection—*Guo* comments, “If tainted by turbid desires, there will be discord.”

Thus it is said: when the body labors without rest, it breaks down; when essence is expended without cease, it wearies; weariness leads to exhaustion. Water’s nature is such that, unadulterated, it is clear; undisturbed, it is level. Yet if pent up and unstirred, it cannot remain clear—*Xuan* comments, “It will turn stagnant and foul.” Such is the image of Heaven’s virtue—*Xuan* comments, “Quiescent yet daily in motion.”

Thus it is said: pure and unadulterated, quiescent and unchanging, tranquil and non-active, moving in accord with Heaven’s course—*Guo* comments, “To move in pursuit of desire is the way of man.” This is the way to nurture the spirit.

Now, one who possesses a sword from Gan or Yue—*Sima* comments, “Gan is Wu. Wu and Yue produce fine swords.”—keeps it cased and hidden, never daring to wield it: this is the height of treasuring. When the spirit flows unimpeded in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit, ascending to touch Heaven, descending to coil upon the earth, transforming and nourishing the myriad things yet leaving no trace—*Xuan* comments, “No image can be made of it.”—its name is “co-equal with the Emperor.” *Xuan* comments, “It shares the function of Heaven’s Emperor.”

The Way of undyed silk is to guard only the spirit, holding fast without loss, merging with the spirit as one. The unity’s refined penetration aligns with Heaven’s order—with the principle of spontaneity. A rustic saying goes: “The multitude values profit, the incorruptible value reputation, the worthy esteem aspiration, the sage treasures essence.” Thus “undyed” means nothing is mingled with it; “pure” means its spirit remains unharmed. One who embodies purity and undyed silk is called a *zhenren*—*Cheng* comments, “To embody is to awaken and comprehend. To intimately align with the principle of purity and undyed silk is to be a true person wherever one is.” (Outer Chapter *Shan Xing*, Sixteen)

To cultivate one’s nature amid the vulgar, one seeks to restore its origin through vulgar learning—*Cui* comments, “*Shan* means to refine.” *Guo* comments, “Having refined one’s nature amid the vulgar, one then seeks to restore the root of life and nature through vulgar learning.” Note: The *Xuan* edition omits one “vulgar.” According to *Guo*’s annotation, there should be two “vulgar,” though one may be superfluous. *Su Yu* says, “One ‘vulgar’ is likely superfluous; ‘learning’ and ‘thought’ form a parallel. It means that both nature and desire have been corrupted by the vulgar, and though learning and thought are both applied, they only deepen the obscurity. *Xuan*’s punctuation, treating ‘vulgar learning’ and ‘vulgar thought’ as separate phrases, seems incorrect.”

To indulge desires amid the vulgar, one seeks to attain clarity through thought—these are called the people of obscurity and delusion. The ancients who cultivated the Way nurtured knowledge with tranquility. *Shiwen* notes, “*Zhi* is pronounced as *wisdom*.” *Xuan* comments, “Stillness gives rise to wisdom.” Wisdom arises yet does not employ wisdom—this is called nurturing tranquility with wisdom. Wisdom arises but is not relied upon, thus using wisdom to nurture one’s stillness. Wisdom and tranquility mutually nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature. Wisdom and tranquility nurture each other, and virtue and the Dao naturally arise from one’s nature.

Virtue is harmony; the Dao is principle. *Xuan* comments, “Virtue and the Dao are simply harmony and compliance. *Li* means compliance.” Virtue admits all without exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao orders all without exception—this is righteousness. Virtue and the Dao give rise to benevolence and righteousness. Righteousness is manifest, and things draw near—this is loyalty. *Xuan* comments, “This is to truly possess virtue and the Dao.” The center is pure and real, returning to genuine feeling—this is joy. *Cheng* comments, “Though one engages with the world, one constantly returns to true feeling; what is attained is harmony and ease, hence it is called joy.” Trustworthy conduct, bearing, and compliance with refinement—this is ritual. True conduct in bearing and compliance with the natural patterns of refinement constitute ritual. When ritual and music are universally applied, the world falls into chaos. *Shiwen* notes, “*Bian* is pronounced as *universal*.” *Guo* comments, “Applying what one part practices and what one mind delights in universally leads to one side gaining while all others lose.” *Yu* comments, “According to *Guo*’s annotation, it should be ‘partial’ (*pian*), hence his explanation. *Shiwen*’s pronunciation is mistaken.” Note: It originally read “partial” (*pian*), but in the Tang era, it was mistakenly written as “universal” (*bian*), so *Lu* followed the text in his pronunciation, though the meaning is incoherent. The *Xuan* edition has already corrected it to “partial.”

When others are upright and receive one’s virtue, virtue is not imposed; if imposed, things will surely lose their nature. When others are upright and receive the benefit of one’s virtue, virtue responds to virtue, without forcing one’s own virtue upon them to overwhelm them. If one forces the world and overwhelms it, seeking to correct others with oneself, then many things will lose their nature.

The ancients lived in primordial chaos, in the undifferentiated state of the world’s beginning. With their generation, they attained serenity and indifference. *Cheng* comments, “Serenity, indifference, and non-action are the Way.” At that time, yin and yang were harmonious and still, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, the multitude of beings did not die prematurely, and though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called perfect unity. At that time, none acted, yet all was constantly spontaneous. There was no artificiality.

When virtue declined, *Suiren* and *Fuxi* began to govern the world, thus complying but not attaining unity. *Cheng* comments, “*Suiren* transformed raw into cooked; *Fuxi* drew the eight trigrams to create writing, made knotted cords into nets, and the sprouts of cunning and deceit emerged. Desires gradually arose, complying with the hearts of the common people yet unable to merge into perfect unity.” When virtue declined further, *Shennong* and the *Yellow Emperor* began to govern the world, thus bringing stability but not compliance. *Cheng* comments, “*Shennong* waged war against *Gonggong*; the *Yellow Emperor* fought *Chiyou*. They sought to stabilize the world but could not fully comply with the multitude of beings.”

When virtue declined still further, *Tang* and *Yu* began to govern the world, initiating the flow of governance and transformation. *Xuan* comments, “Losing their source.” Simplicity dissolved and unadorned nature scattered. *Shiwen* notes, “● is also written as *jiao* (superficial).” *Cheng* comments, “*Tang* and *Yu* established the five canons to regulate the five phases, appointed officials to govern the people, but the five phases declined from then on, the people became superficial and deceitful, and the pure and unadorned nature was destroyed.” They departed from the Dao to pursue goodness, risked virtue to enact conduct—*Xian* means peril. Departing from the Dao to aspire to goodness, risking virtue to regulate conduct, are like *Wuguang* and *Shentu Di*. Then they abandoned nature and followed the heart. *Xuan* comments, “Forsaking heavenly nature, employing the human heart.” The heart and its discriminating knowledge were insufficient to stabilize the world. *Xuan* comments, “People grew increasingly cunning and deceitful.” *Yu* comments, “The *Book of Songs* says, ‘Not knowing, not perceiving.’ ‘Discriminating knowledge’ is a compound; it means only without knowing and perceiving can the world be stabilized. Other interpretations, which break after ‘knowledge,’ are incorrect.”

Then they adorned it with refinement and enriched it with breadth. Refinement destroyed substance, breadth drowned the heart, and then the people began to be confused and disordered, unable to return to their nature and feelings and restore their origin.

From this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world. *Xuan* comments, “Taking the non-Dao as the Dao.” The world and the Dao mutually lose each other. How can the person of the Dao arise in the world, and how can the world arise in the Dao? The Dao has no means to arise in the world, and the world has no means to arise in the Dao. Even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is concealed. *Cheng* comments, “If the sage descends into the dust of the world and mingles with the multitude, concealing his sagely virtue so that it cannot be employed, though he dwells in the marketplace, it is no different from the mountains and forests.”

The concealment lies not in self-concealment. *Xuan* comments, “In an age where the Dao is concealed, one need not conceal oneself—one is already concealed.” The so-called recluses of antiquity did not hide their bodies to avoid being seen, nor seal their words to prevent them from being spoken, nor suppress their knowledge to keep it from being expressed. Rather, the times and fate were greatly awry. Had their times and fate aligned to flourish throughout the world, they would have returned to unity without leaving a trace, reverting to the age of perfect unity where no trace of them would be seen. Had their times and fate been utterly at odds with the world, they would have deeply rooted themselves in tranquility and awaited their moment, firmly establishing the natural root and preserving the ultimate goodness to bide their time. This is the Way of preserving one’s person.

The ancients who conducted themselves in the world did not adorn their knowledge with clever disputation. *Cheng* comments, “Those of old who entrusted themselves to their conduct did not embellish petty wisdom with empty rhetoric.” They did not exhaust the world with their knowledge. *Cheng* comments, “They did not deploy their knowledge to distress the common people.” Nor did they exhaust virtue with their knowledge. *Cheng* comments, “They knew the limits of their portion and did not burden their inherent attainment with boundless pursuits.” Solemnly abiding in their proper place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do? The Dao is not a matter of petty conduct; virtue is not a matter of petty understanding. Petty understanding harms virtue. *Cheng* comments, “Petty understanding and trivial knowledge impair the profound and mysterious virtue.” Petty conduct harms the Dao. Thus it is said: rectify oneself and that is all. To delight in wholeness is to attain one’s aspiration. To delight in the fullness of one’s nature is to fulfill one’s aspiration.

The so-called attainment of aspiration in antiquity did not refer to carriages and caps of office. It meant that nothing could augment their joy. *Guo* comments, “To be complete within and self-sufficient.” The so-called attainment of aspiration today refers to carriages and caps of office. Yet carriages and caps of office are not one’s nature or fate; they are things that arrive by chance, like lodgers. *Cheng* comments, “‘By chance’ means arriving unexpectedly.” As lodgers, their coming cannot be warded off, nor can their going be halted. Thus, one does not indulge one’s aspirations for carriages and caps of office—*tìzhì* means to let one’s aspirations run wild—nor does one conform to custom in times of poverty and hardship, degrading one’s aspirations to follow the vulgar. Their joy is the same in both circumstances, seeing carriages and caps of office and poverty and hardship as no different. Thus, they are without sorrow. Therefore, they can dwell in honor without anxiety.

Now, when the lodger departs, there is no joy—this is common to all people today. From this perspective, though they may rejoice, they are never without distraction. Those who delight in carriages and caps of office have their aspirations scattered abroad. Thus it is said: those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to custom are called “the people of inverted priorities.” *Xiang* comments, “To exchange the inner for the outer is called inversion.”

When autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River. Li comments, "Water is born in spring and swells in autumn." The vastness of its currents—where *jing* means "unobstructed," as Sima explains, while Cui’s version reads *jing* as "direct," meaning "straight passage"—spans between its two banks and islets, where the shores blur so that oxen and horses cannot be distinguished. Cheng comments, "Viewed from afar across the water, one cannot tell ox from horse." At this, the River Lord beams with self-satisfaction, believing all the world’s beauty to be contained within himself.

Following the current eastward to the Northern Sea, he turns to face the east and sees no end to the water. Cheng notes, "The Northern Sea is present-day Laizhou." There, the River Lord at last turns his gaze, looks up in awe toward Ruo, and sighs. The *Shiwen* reads *wang* as *mang*, explaining, "Mangyang means 'to gaze upward,'" while Sima comments, "Ruo is the sea god." He says, "There is a rustic saying: 'Having heard a hundred ways of the Dao, one believes none surpasses oneself.' This describes me. Moreover, I once heard of those who belittle Confucius’s learning and dismiss Boyi’s righteousness, and I did not believe it. Now that I have witnessed the boundlessness of your realm, had I not come to your gate, I would have remained in peril. I would long have been ridiculed by the masters of the Great Dao." Sima explains, "The Great Dao is the grand principle."

The Northern Sea’s Ruo replies, "A well fish cannot be spoken to of the sea, for it is confined by its dwelling. Wang Yinzhi argues, "Originally, the text read 'well *fish*,' later altered by others. The *Taiping Yulan*’s sections on seasons, fish and shellfish, and insects all quote this passage as 'A well *fish* cannot be spoken to of the sea,' proving the original text used *fish*. Moreover, the *Shiwen* does not gloss *wa* (frog) here but only does so later under 'the frog in the shallow well,' where it notes, 'Wa, also written as [蜗], pronounced *huwo*,' and cites Sima’s comment, 'A frog is a water creature resembling a toad.' This clearly shows the original read *fish*, not *frog*. If it were *frog*, the pronunciation and annotation would appear here, not later. Furthermore, the *Huainanzi*’s 'Yuan Dao' chapter states, 'A well fish cannot be told of the great, for it is confined by narrowness,' and Liang scholar Zhang Wan writes, 'The well fish knows not the vast sea; the summer insect knows not winter ice.' The *Shui Jing Zhu*’s commentary on the Gan River says, 'I record this curious text to broaden the hearing of the well fish.' All these draw from Zhuangzi, confirming the original text read 'well *fish*.' In the *Yi Jing*’s hexagram *Jing* (Well), line nine-three reads, 'The well’s valley shoots forth minnows,' with Zheng Xuan noting, 'The fish born in wells are not large, only minnows.' (Cited in Liu Kui’s commentary on the *Wu Du Fu*.) The *Kunxue Jiwen* (Vol. 10) quotes the *Taiping Yulan*’s version of Zhuangzi: 'For those whose thoughts are like well fish, I cast my hook to lure them.' The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s 'Yu Da' chapter states, 'There are no large fish in wells.' All these attest to 'well fish.' Later scholars, seeing this passage’s reference to 'the frog in the shallow well' and the *Xunzi*’s 'Zheng Lun' chapter, which says, 'The frog in the pit well cannot be spoken to of the joy of the Eastern Sea,' changed 'well fish' to 'well frog,' unaware that wells naturally contain fish and needed no alteration to frogs. Since this change, the world has spoken only of 'well frogs and summer insects,' forgetting the metaphor of the well fish." Wang Niansun adds, "*Xu* (dwelling) is interchangeable with *qu* (ruins), as the *Shiwen* notes, '*Xu* is also written as *qu*.' The *Guang Ya* states, '*Qu* is [居] (to dwell).' The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Xizheng Fu* cites the *Sheng Lei*: '*Qu* is the site of former dwellings.' The *jingqu* (mounds and ruins) in classical texts refer to former dwelling places. Thus, 'the well fish is confined by its dwelling' means it does not know the sea’s vastness, just as the River Lord is confined by his banks and shores."

A summer insect cannot be spoken to of ice, for it is bound by its season. Guo Qingfan explains, "Sima glosses *du* as 'thick,' but this is circuitous and unclear. The *Shuowen* defines *du* as 'firm.' In the *Lunyu*, 'firmly believing and fond of learning' means belief held fast; in the *Liji*’s 'Ru Xing,' 'firm in conduct and tireless' means conduct held fast. All that is narrow-minded and unenlightened is called *gu* (stubborn). The summer insect is blinded by its season, hence *du yu shi* (bound by its time). *Du* shares the same meaning as *ju* (confined) and *shu* (restrained) in the surrounding text."

A narrow-minded scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao, for he is constrained by his teachings. Sima explains, "A *qushi* is a scholar from a rural backwater." Now that you have emerged from your banks and shores and beheld the great sea, you recognize your own inadequacy. You may now be spoken to of grand principles." Guo comments, "Because you know your limits, you may be told of the Dao."

Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers flow into it, yet it never fills, though no one knows when it will cease; its Tailu vent drains it, yet it never empties, though no one knows when it will end. The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Yangsheng Lun* cites Sima: "Tailu is where water flows out beyond the sea, also called Wujiao, located in the Eastern Sea. *Wei* (tail) refers to its position below all rivers, hence the name *wei*."

"As for *lü* (闾), it means 'gathering'—the place where waters gather in clans, hence the name. East of Fusang, there lies a stone, four myriad *li* in both breadth and thickness. All the sea’s waters that pour into it are scorched away, hence it is called *Wojiao* (沃焦)."

Note: "*Wojiao*" is also written as "*Wojiao*" (沃焦), as seen in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. Now that the globe is fully traversable, this account may be clarified. The seasons of spring and autumn remain unchanged, and droughts and floods go unnoticed. Such is its flow beyond the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, immeasurable in quantity. Yet I have never boasted of this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive *qi* from yin and yang. I exist between heaven and earth as a pebble or twig does in a great mountain. Even as I recognize my smallness, why should I boast?

Consider the Four Seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a tiny crevice in a vast marsh? *Shiwen* annotates: "*Lěi* (礨), Cui reads as *lěi* (垒); *kōng* (空) as *kǒng* (孔). *Lěikōng* (垒孔) means a small hole. Li explains: 'A small mound,' or alternatively, 'an anthill.'" Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of *ti* (稊) in a great granary? *Shiwen* annotates: "Guo’s *Erya* commentary: '*Ti* resembles *bai* (稗).' *Dà* (大) reads as *tài* (泰)."

The number of things is called ten thousand, and humans occupy but one among them. All the people of the Nine Provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carts travel, still occupy but one among them. Cui explains: "*Zú* (卒) means 'all.'" Guo Songtao comments: "All the people of the Nine Provinces refers to the full count of its population. *Zú* is an exhaustive term. The vastness of the Nine Provinces and the multitude of its people, within the midst of heaven, are but one among the ten thousand things." In this comparison to the ten thousand things, are humans not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?

What the Five Emperors inherited, Cui explains: "*Lián* (连) means 'continued.'" What the Three Kings contended for, what the benevolent worried over, and what the capable labored for—all of it is encompassed here. Boyi rejected it to make his name, and Confucius discoursed on it to display his breadth. Their self-importance was no different from your earlier boasting of water."

The River Spirit said, "Then may I consider heaven and earth as great and the tip of a hair as small?"

The Spirit of the Northern Sea replied, "No. For things, their measures are boundless; their times, unceasing; their allotments, inconstant; and their beginnings and ends, without permanence. Thus, the great wisdom observes both far and near—knowing that wisdom is the same, it surveys both without favoring one corner. Therefore, the small is not deemed few, nor the great many, for it knows measures are boundless. It does not take size as a measure of abundance, knowing each measure suffices in its own way.

It verifies past and present, as Guo explains: "*Xiàng* (向) means 'illuminating.' *Jīn gù* (今故) refers to past and present." Thus, the distant does not vex, for though the past is remote, I am not troubled, nor do I need to follow the ancients. The near is grasped without strain, for what is close at hand is taken without striving. It knows time is unceasing.

It proves the great Dao of past and present, not taking human lifespans as the ultimate measure, for it knows time is unending. It examines fullness and emptiness, so it does not rejoice in gain nor grieve in loss, knowing allotments are inconstant. It understands the level path, as Guo explains: "Life and death are the proper course of daily renewal." Thus, it does not delight in life nor deem death a calamity, knowing beginnings and ends cannot be fixed.

Guo explains: "Understanding that beginnings and ends are ever-renewing, one knows the past cannot be clung to or detained." Consider what humans know—it is less than what they do not know. The known is finite, while the unknown is limitless! The time of one’s life is less than the time before birth. Life has an end, but heaven and earth are endless. To seek the bounds of the greatest with the smallest is to become lost and unable to find oneself. Cheng explains: "The boundless realm is not yet encompassed, while finite wisdom is already exhausted."

From this perspective, how can one know the tip of a hair suffices to define the finest boundary? Or how can one know heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the greatest realm?" The tip of a hair is not small, nor are heaven and earth great.

The River Spirit said, "Those who discuss such matters in the world all say, 'The most refined has no form, and the greatest cannot be encompassed.' Is this a true reflection of reality?"

Cheng explains: "*Xìn* (信) means 'real.'"

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "One who views the great from the perspective of the small cannot encompass it all. As the commentary states: 'Dwelling in the small and viewing the great, there is that which cannot be fully surveyed, and so it seems impossible to encompass.' One who views the small from the perspective of the great cannot see it clearly. As the commentary states: 'Dwelling in the great and viewing the small, there is that which cannot be fully examined, and so it seems formless.' Now, the refined is the subtlest of the small, while the vast is the fullness of the great. As the commentary states: '*Fú* (垺) is pronounced like *fú* (孚) and means 'expansive.' *Yīn* (殷) means 'abundant.' Thus, the difference lies in what is convenient. As the commentary states: 'Thus, one perceives the unencompassable as inconvenient for the small, which finds convenience in its own smallness; one perceives the formless as inconvenient for the great, which finds convenience in its own greatness.' This is the nature of their circumstances. Such is the way of their conditions, and it is not worth debating.

The refined and the coarse are expected to have form. As the commentary states: 'They still seek the Dao in the realm of traces.' That which is formless cannot be divided by calculation—this refers to the refined. That which cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by calculation—this refers to the coarse. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things, for the coarse can still be spoken of. What can be grasped by the mind is the refined aspect of things, for the refined can still be apprehended by intention. That which cannot be discussed in words nor examined and grasped by the mind does not depend on the refined or the coarse. What does not depend on the refined or the coarse lies beyond words and intentions—this is the subtlety of the Dao.

Therefore, the conduct of the great person does not involve harming others, nor does it emphasize benevolence and kindness. It fundamentally does no harm, nor does it pride itself on benevolence and kindness. Their actions are not for profit, nor do they despise gatekeepers and servants. They fundamentally do not act for profit, nor do they regard those who seek profit—like gatekeepers and servants—as base. They do not contend over wealth and goods, nor do they exalt modesty and yielding. They do not contend over wealth, nor do they consider the virtue of modesty and yielding as lofty. In affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overvalue self-reliance, nor despise the greedy and corrupt. They do not borrow strength from others in their affairs but sustain themselves by their own efforts, seeking only sufficiency. Nor do they regard those who greedily seek gain as base. Their conduct differs from the common, but they do not emphasize eccentricity. Their actions do not follow the crowd, nor do they regard flattery and obsequiousness as base. They act in accord with the multitude but do not despise the fawning and sycophantic. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them; execution and disgrace are insufficient to shame them. They know that the traces of right and wrong cannot be divided, nor can the boundaries of the small and great be defined. The traces of right and wrong cannot be separated, and the beginnings of the small and great cannot be seen—only the great person knows this.

I have heard it said: As the commentary states: 'Attributed to another, hence "I have heard it said."' 'The Dao-person does not strive for fame.' Guo states: 'Allowing things to follow their own nature, so that their inherent qualities naturally manifest, then merit and fame return to things—hence, they do not strive for fame.' Note: This saying also appears in the *Shan Mu* chapter, where 'Dao' is replaced with 'perfect.' 'Perfect virtue does not attain.' Guo states: 'Attainment arises from loss. When things each have no loss, then the name of attainment vanishes.' 'The great person has no self.' Guo states: 'They simply follow things.' This is the utmost of restrained conduct." This means restraining oneself and returning to one’s proper place.

The River Spirit said: "Beyond things and within things, how do the boundaries of nobility and baseness arise? How do the boundaries of small and great arise?" He asks: If one does not depend on the refined or the coarse, then how, within the inner and outer nature of things, do the beginnings of nobility and baseness, small and great, emerge?

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "From the perspective of the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness. From the perspective of things, each values itself and devalues others—such is the sentiment of things toward one another, hence the word 'relative.' From the perspective of custom, nobility and baseness do not lie within oneself. The world regards external honor and disgrace as nobility and baseness. From the perspective of differentiation, the numbers of gradation. Following what is great and making it great, as the commentary states: 'Taking self-sufficiency as great.' then there is nothing that is not great. Following what is small and making it small, as the commentary states: 'Taking having no excess as small.' then there is nothing that is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are like a grain of millet and that the tip of a hair is like a mountain and hill, then the numbers of gradation are equal.

From the perspective of merit, the mutual necessity of affairs and achievements. Following what things have and making it have, then there is nothing that does not have. Following what things lack and making it lack, then there is nothing that does not lack. Su Yu states: 'The sentiment of things takes utility as having and mutual overcoming as lacking, just as arrow-makers say there can be no quivers, and quiver-makers say there can be no arrows. Yet if arrows are considered to have, then quivers, which counter arrows, can also be said to have. If quivers are considered to lack, then arrows, which are repelled by quivers, can also be said to lack.' Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other, then the division of merit is settled. East and west are fundamentally opposites, yet without east, west cannot be defined. Thus, speaking of their mutual necessity in terms of opposition, the division of merit can be settled.

From the perspective of tendencies, the inclinations of the multitude. Following what things affirm and affirming it, then there is nothing that is not affirmed. Following what things negate and negating it, then there is nothing that is not negated. They follow others’ right and wrong as right and wrong. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed their own ways and negated the other, then the tendencies and conduct are seen. Yao negated Jie, and Jie negated Yao. Those who follow Yao and Jie each hold to their own right and wrong, so the instability of tendencies and conduct is evident.

In ancient times, Yao and Shun yielded the throne and became emperors, while Zhi and Kuai yielded and met their end. Sima states: 'King Kuai of Yan followed the advice of Su Dai, imitating Yao and Shun by yielding the throne to his minister Zi Zhi. After three years, the state fell into chaos.' Tang and Wu contended and became kings, while the Duke of Bai contended and perished." The *Shiwen* states: 'The Duke of Bai, named Sheng, was the grandson of King Ping of Chu. He caused an uprising and died.'"

"The account is found in the *Zuo Tradition*, sixteenth year of Duke Ai." From this, we see that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, the esteem and debasement of the times—these cannot be taken as constant.

Xuan comments: "From this, the great and small may be known." A roof beam can batter down a city wall but cannot plug a rat hole—this speaks of different implements. Guo Qingfan notes: "In the *Liezi*'s 'Tang Wen' chapter, it says: 'When Yongmen sold his song, the lingering notes coiled around the *liangli*, persisting for three days without cease.' *Liangli* is the same as *liangli*. The *Shanglin Fu* says 'intertwined *li* and *gui*,' with the commentary: '*Li* and *gui* are supports. *Li* means attachment, *gui* means crossing.' The *Guangyun* states: '*Li* means fixed.' The *Yupian* says: '*Li* means paired.' Columns are called *li* when paired, and roof beams are also called *li* when attached to one another—this refers to rafters and pillars. A *liangli* must be made of large timber, so it can be used to batter down a city wall but is not suited for trivial use."

The *Shiwen* states: "*Zhi* means to block." A fine steed like the *qiji* or *hualiu* can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet it is no match for a wildcat in catching mice—this speaks of different skills. The owl snatches fleas at night—The *Shiwen* notes: "The *Huainanzi* says: 'The owl gathers fleas at night, discerning the finest details.' Xu Shen explains: 'The owl gathers fleas and lice at night without fail.' The Sima edition reads: 'The owl, or *xiuliu*, hunts by night.'" Wang Yinzhi comments: "The text originally had only *chixiu*; the *xiu* character was added due to the *Shiwen*'s note 'The owl, or *xiuliu*.' The *Pi Ya* cites this passage in error. The *Shiwen* provides a pronunciation for *chi* ('*chi*, *chiyi* cut') and notes: 'Cui says: "The owl, or *xiuliu*."' It does not provide a pronunciation for *xiu*, which makes it clear that the original text did not contain it. The *Huainanzi*'s 'Zhushu' chapter also says: 'The owl snatches fleas at night.'" Note: *Ju* ("gather") is synonymous with *cuo* ("snatch"). Cui’s edition has *zui* ("best") instead of *cuo*. In ancient texts, *ju* and *zui* were often interchangeable, hence the variant. Yet though it discerns the finest details, by day it glares with wide-open eyes and cannot see a hill—this speaks of different natures.

The *Shiwen* states: "*Chen* may also be written as *ming*." Su Yu comments: "The correct reading is *chen*. It means that the owl, which discerns the finest details of fleas at night, by day glares with wide-open eyes and cannot see a hill. The *Xu Wugui* chapter says: 'The owl’s eyes have their proper time'—meaning they are suited to night and not to day."

Thus it is said: Why insist on following right and rejecting wrong, following order and rejecting chaos? Such common sayings fail to grasp the principles of Heaven and Earth or the conditions of the myriad things. It is like following Heaven and rejecting Earth, following yin and rejecting yang—its impossibility is plain. Yet such talk persists without cease, which must mean either stupidity or deceit.

Xuan comments: "The stupid do not know; the deceitful know but speak falsely." The abdications of emperors and kings differ—Cheng comments: "Some pass the throne to their clansmen, others yield it to different lineages, hence the term 'different abdications.'" The successions of the Three Dynasties differ—Cheng comments: "Some pass the throne from father to son, others seize it through armed conquest, hence the term 'different successions.'" Those who go against their times and defy custom are called usurpers. When the times and customs are already flawed, to oppose and defy them—as in the cases of Zizhi and the Duke of Bai—is to be deemed a usurper by the world. Those who act in accord with their times and follow custom are called righteous men. When the times and customs are practicable, to act in harmony with them is to be deemed righteous by the world—thus we see that esteem and debasement depend on the times.

O silent River Spirit! Beware of speaking too much. How could you know the gate of esteem and debasement, the house of great and small?"

The River Spirit said: "Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I decide what to accept or reject, what to pursue or abandon? In the end, what am I to do?"

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "From the perspective of the Dao, what is noble and what is base? This is called 'reversal and overflow.' As Guo notes, 'The ways of nobility and baseness follow one another in endless cycles.' Cui says, 'When nothing is noble or base, this reversal becomes beauty itself.' The original text also reads 'rebellion and overflow,' with Li explaining, 'Like boundless overflow, merging into one.' Do not constrain your will—*er*, here and below, means 'you.' When nobility and baseness have no fixed standard, one need not be bound by them. Yet this conflicts with the great Dao. Rigid adherence makes the Dao difficult to follow.

What is few and what is many? This is called 'gratitude and bestowal,' merely the gifts of Heaven. To act without unity is to be at odds with the Dao. To cling to unity in action is to fail to align with the Dao.

Majestic, like a state with its ruler, who bestows no private virtue—yet all things receive its power. Free and at ease, like the sacrifices at the earth-altar, who grants no private blessings—yet all believe the spirits bless them. Vast and boundless, like the four directions without end, without boundaries or divisions. Embracing all things, who bears or assists them? This is called 'without direction.' All things are held within me—who bears me, and who assists me? This is called 'without partiality.'

All things are equal: who is short, and who is long? As Xuan notes, 'This is why there is no direction.' The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and birth, yet do not rely on their completion. As Xuan says, 'With life and death, the completion of things cannot be relied upon.' Emptiness and fullness alternate, never fixed in form. As Xuan says, 'Emptiness and fullness succeed one another, so form has no fixed position.'

Years cannot be lifted, time cannot be halted. As Xuan says, 'The past cannot be preserved, the passing cannot be drawn back.' Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is how we speak of the great meaning of the Dao and discuss the principles of all things.

The birth of things is like a gallop, like a swift ride—so rapid is it. No movement without change, no moment without shift. What should be done? What should not be done? All things will transform of themselves." Cheng says, "Be at ease and let them be—they will change naturally. Why trouble yourself with doing or not doing?"

The River Spirit said: "Then what is the value of the Dao?"
Xuan says, "If there is no distinction between doing and not doing, why value the study of the Dao?"

The Lord of the Northern Sea said: "Those who know the Dao must grasp its principles; those who grasp its principles must understand its adaptability; those who understand its adaptability will not let things harm them. The one of utmost virtue cannot be burned by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or injured by birds and beasts. This does not mean they are merely close to these things—*bo* means 'to press.' It does not mean they are pressed near yet remain unharmed."

"To speak of discerning safety and danger, finding peace amid misfortune and fortune—Cheng says, 'Peace means tranquility. Misfortune is obstruction; fortune is smooth passage'—to be cautious in advance and retreat, none can harm you. Thus it is said: Heaven resides within—Xuan says, 'The heavenly mechanism is hidden from sight'—while man resides without—Xuan says, 'Human affairs manifest in action.' Virtue lies in Heaven. Virtue exalts the natural. To know the conduct of Heaven and man, one must root oneself in Heaven and position oneself in virtue. Only those who know the conduct of Heaven and man ground themselves in the natural and abide in self-attainment. Advancing and retreating, bending and extending—Cheng says, 'This describes the appearance of indecision. Adapting to the moment without fixed attachment'—return to the essential and speak of the ultimate." Xuan says, "This is the essence of learning and the pinnacle of the Dao."

Someone asked, "What is Heaven? What is man?"
The Lord of the Northern Sea replied, "That oxen and horses have four legs is called Heaven; to bridle a horse’s head or pierce an ox’s nose is called man. Thus it is said: Do not let man obliterate Heaven, do not let the artificial obliterate fate, do not let gain be sacrificed for fame. Do not destroy the natural with human affairs, do not injure nature with contrivance, do not let limited gain be sacrificed for boundless renown. Guard this carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to one’s true nature." Guo says, "Truth lies within one’s inherent nature."

Kui pitied the centipede, the centipede pitied the snake, the snake pitied the wind, the wind pitied the eye, and the eye pitied the heart. Sima says, "The centipede is the *maxian* insect. The *Guangya* states, '*Ququ* is the *maxian*.' Kui has one foot, the centipede many, the snake none, the wind formless. The eye’s form is fixed here while its vision flows there; the heart’s essence is subtle, its spirit roaming beyond." Cheng says, "Pity here means admiration."

Kui said to the centipede, "I leap and stride with my single foot—Cheng says, 'Leaping and striding'—nothing is as simple as this. Now you move with ten thousand feet—how can you bear it?" He thought it cumbersome.
The centipede replied, "Not so. Have you not seen one who spits? When sprayed, the large droplets are like pearls, the small like mist, and the countless falling ones cannot be numbered. Now I move by my heavenly mechanism, yet I do not know how it is so."

The centipede said to the snake, "I move with many feet yet do not match your footlessness—how is it you are so swift?"
The snake replied, "How can one alter what the heavenly mechanism moves? What need have I for feet?"

The snake said to the wind, "I move by wriggling my spine and ribs, which seems to resemble something—it seems as if I had feet. Now you rise in a great gust from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea as if nothing were there—how is this?"
The wind replied, "Indeed, I rise in a great gust from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea, yet if one points a finger at me, they overcome me; if one stamps a foot at me, I too overcome them." Li notes, "The character *zhi* is also written as *cu*." Guo Songtao says, "In the *Xunzi*’s 'Strong States' chapter, Yang’s commentary on 'the great Yan follows behind' states, '*Cu* means to trample.'" Cheng says, "If a person points a finger at the wind, the wind cannot break the finger; if one stamps a foot at the wind, the wind cannot break the foot—this is the inability to overcome in small matters." "Nevertheless, to break great trees and topple great houses—only I can do this. Thus, to regard many small inabilities to overcome as a great overcoming—only the sage can achieve this." Only those who achieve great overcoming allow no room for calculation in the many small inabilities to overcome—only the sage who knows the Dao can do this. Xuan says, "The functions of the eye and heart are even more wondrous; one may understand this through personal experience, so the text omits further elaboration."

Confucius was traveling in Kuang when men of Song surrounded him several layers deep, yet he played his zither and sang without ceasing. Li notes, "Sima says, 'Song should be Wei. The people of Wei mistakenly surrounded Confucius, taking him for Yang Hu, who had once oppressed the people of Kuang.' The character *chuo* is also written as *chuo* (to cease)."
Zilu entered and saw him, saying, "How can you be so joyful, Master?"
Confucius replied, "Come! Let me tell you."

"I have long avoided poverty, yet cannot escape it—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet cannot attain it—this is timing." Cheng comments, "讳 means to shun." In the age of Yao and Shun, there were no impoverished men in the world, not because wisdom prevailed, but because worthy scholars were all employed; it was not their wisdom that brought success. In the age of Jie and Zhou, there were no successful men in the world, not because wisdom failed, but because worthy men all went into reclusion; it was not their wisdom that caused failure. Such are the circumstances of the times.

Those who travel by water without avoiding dragons and serpents possess the courage of fishermen; those who travel by land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers possess the courage of hunters; those who face crossed blades before them and regard death as life possess the courage of martyrs; those who know poverty is a matter of fate, success a matter of timing, and face great peril without fear possess the courage of sages. Be at peace! Rest content. My fate is governed by Heaven."

Soon after, men bearing armor approached and said, "We mistook you for Yang Hu, hence the siege. Now that we know otherwise, we beg leave to withdraw."

The armored men acknowledged their mistake and withdrew.

Gongsun Long questioned Wei Mou, saying: "In my youth, I studied the Way of the masters, and in maturity, I clarified the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, blended hardness and whiteness, affirmed the untrue, and validated the invalid—confounding the wisdom of the hundred schools and exhausting the eloquence of all debaters. I took myself to have attained ultimate understanding. Yet now, having heard Zhuangzi’s words, I am bewildered and struck with wonder. I do not know whether my reasoning falls short of his, or whether my knowledge simply cannot compare. Now I am at a loss for words. I venture to ask: what is the method?"

Prince Mou leaned against his desk, sighed deeply, looked up to the sky, and laughed, saying: "Have you alone never heard of the frog in the shallow well? He said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea, ‘How joyful I am! I leap and dance upon the well’s railing, then rest at the edge of its broken bricks. When I enter the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my jaws; when I tread in the mud, it covers my feet and submerges my insteps. Looking around at the water striders, crabs, and tadpoles, none can match my delight. Moreover, to possess the water of this entire hollow and monopolize the joys of the shallow well—this is perfection itself. Why do you not come in from time to time to see for yourself?’

Before the turtle of the Eastern Sea could place its left foot inside, its right knee was already caught fast. Thereupon, it hesitated, drew back, and retreated at leisure. It then told the frog of the sea: ‘A distance of a thousand *li* cannot convey its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* cannot measure its depth. In the time of Yu, floods prevailed for nine years out of ten, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, droughts lasted seven years out of eight, yet the shores did not diminish. Not to be altered by the brief or the enduring—

Neither by increase nor by decrease is it altered—this, too, is the great joy of the Eastern Sea."

Upon hearing this, the frog in the shallow well was struck with alarm, his countenance betraying dismay, and he lost himself in bewilderment. For one whose understanding cannot fathom the bounds of right and wrong, yet still seeks to scrutinize the words of Zhuangzi—this is like tasking a mosquito with bearing a mountain or a centipede with racing across a river; it is beyond all capacity. And one whose knowledge cannot grasp the subtleties of profound discourse, yet clings to the fleeting gains of the moment—is this not the frog in the shallow well?

Moreover, the sea strides across the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Vault, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, dissolving into the unfathomable. Unrestrained by east or west, it begins in the depths of mystery and returns to the great communion. Yet you, with your narrow gaze, seek to examine it through scrutiny and pursue it through debate—this is no different from peering at the heavens through a tube or measuring the earth with an awl. Is this not petty indeed? Begone!

Have you alone not heard of the young men of Shouling who traveled to Handan to learn its famed gait? Failing to master the skill of that land, they lost even their own way of walking, and could do no better than crawl home on all fours. If you do not leave now, you will forget your own origins and lose your own calling."

At this, Gongsun Long’s mouth gaped open, unable to close, his tongue raised and unable to descend. He fled in haste.

Zhuangzi was fishing in the Pu River when the King of Chu dispatched two ministers to approach him first, saying, "We wish to burden you with the affairs of our realm." They sought to entangle him in the kingdom’s matters.

Zhuangzi held his fishing rod without turning, saying, "I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise, dead now for three thousand years, which the king wraps in silk and stores in a bamboo box, enshrined in the ancestral temple. This tortoise—would it rather die to leave its bones honored, or live to drag its tail through the mud?" The two ministers replied, "It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud." Zhuangzi said, "Go away! I too shall drag my tail through the mud."

When Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone told Huizi, "Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as minister." Thereupon Huizi grew fearful and searched the state for three days and three nights. Zhuangzi went to see him and said, "In the south there is a bird called the yuanchu—do you know it? The yuanchu sets out from the Southern Sea and flies to the Northern Sea. It alights only on the wutong tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only from springs of sweet wine. Then a kite, having found a rotting rat, saw the yuanchu passing by and looked up, crying, *'Ha!*' Now do you mean to frighten me with your state of Liang?"

Zhuangzi and Huizi strolled upon the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, "The minnows swim forth so leisurely—this is the joy of fish." Huizi said, "You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?" Zhuangzi replied, "You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?" Huizi said, "I am not you, so of course I do not know you; but you are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete." Zhuangzi said, "Let us return to the beginning. When you said, *'How do you know the joy of fish?'*—you already knew I knew it when you asked me. I know it here by the Hao."

**Outer Chapters: "Ultimate Joy" (Chapter Eighteen)**

Is there in the world an ultimate joy, or is there not? Is there a way to preserve life, or is there not? What should one do, and on what should one rely? What should one avoid, and where should one dwell? What should one pursue, and what should one reject? What should one delight in, and what should one detest?

What the world reveres are wealth, honor, longevity, and goodness—goodness meaning favorable encounters. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and harmonious sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and misfortune—early death meaning premature demise, and misfortune meaning grave illness. What it suffers from are the body’s lack of ease, the mouth’s lack of rich flavors, the form’s lack of fine garments, the eyes’ lack of beautiful sights, and the ears’ lack of harmonious sounds. If one cannot obtain these, one is filled with great sorrow and fear. How foolish it is to be so bound to the body!

The wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing riches they cannot fully use—how external their concern for the body! Those of high rank pass their days and nights in anxious thought, weighing right and wrong—how distant their care for the body! When a person is born, sorrow is born with them. Even the long-lived grow muddled; enduring sorrow without dying—what misery! How far removed this is from true care for the body!

The resolute strive to be seen as good in the world, and all praise them as good. Yet this is not enough to preserve life. I do not know whether goodness is truly good or truly not good. If it is considered good, it is not enough to preserve life; if it is considered not good, it is enough to preserve others. Acting on one’s words is enough to preserve others. Thus it is said: *"When loyal admonitions go unheeded, withdraw and do not contend."* Therefore, when Wu Zixu contended and was torn limb from limb, had he not contended, his name would not have been established. Is there truly goodness, or is there not?

As for what the common world does and delights in, I do not know whether its joy is truly joy or truly not joy. I observe that what the world delights in, the masses rush toward in a frenzy, as if they cannot do otherwise. Yet all call it joy—I do not find it joyful, nor do I find it not joyful. Whether it is joy or not, I have not personally experienced it. Is there truly joy, or is there not? I take non-action as true joy, yet this is what the world deems most bitter. Thus it is said: *"Ultimate joy is no joy; ultimate praise is no praise."* Right and wrong in the world truly cannot be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. Ultimate joy and the preservation of life—only non-action comes close to attaining them.

Let me try to speak of this. Heaven is non-active and thereby clear; Earth is non-active and thereby tranquil. Thus, when the two non-actions combine, the myriad things are transformed. Vast and indistinct, how can one trace their origin? Indistinct and vast, how can one perceive their form? The myriad things, teeming and abundant, all grow from non-action. Thus it is said: *"Heaven and Earth are non-active, yet there is nothing they do not do."* Among humans, who can attain non-action?

When Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting with his legs spread, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said, *"You lived with her, raised children together, and grew old. That she has died and you do not weep is enough—yet you drum on a basin and sing. Is this not excessive?"* Zhuangzi replied, *"Not so. When she first died, how could I alone not feel sorrow? But I examined her beginning and saw that originally there was no life. Not only was there no life, but originally there was no form. Not only was there no form, but originally there was no qi. Amidst the indistinct and vague, there was a transformation, and qi arose. The qi transformed and form arose. The form transformed and life arose. Now, it has transformed again into death—this is like the progression of spring, autumn, winter, and summer in the four seasons."*

A man will soon lie peacefully in the great chamber, yet I would wail and follow him in lament—this I deemed a failure to comprehend the mandate, and so I ceased.

Zhili Shu and Huajie Shu—Li notes: *"Zhili forgets form; Huajie forgets wisdom. These two have grasped transformation."* They gazed upon the mound of Mingbo—Li notes: *"A mound’s name, evoking the profound and obscure"*—and the wasteland of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once rested. Suddenly, a growth sprouted on his left elbow, a tumor sounding like *"liu"* (willow), a borrowed term for *"child."* His mind was jolted, dismayed by it. Cheng notes: *"Juejue describes a startled reaction."*

Zhili Shu asked, *"Do you loathe it?"*
Huajie Shu replied, *"No. Cheng notes: *'No' means nonexistence. Why should I loathe it? Life is a temporary borrowing; that which borrows and gives rise to life is but dust and grime. Death and life are as day and night. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has reached me—why should I loathe it?"*

When Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he came upon an empty skull, its form stark and hollow. Xuan notes: *"Xiao (髐) is pronounced 'xiao,' meaning desiccated and hollow."* He struck it with his horsewhip—Shiwen notes: *"Jiao (撽) is pronounced 'jiao' (苦吊反). The Shuowen defines it as ● (旁击), 'to strike from the side.'"*—and then questioned it, saying: *"Did you, sir, covet life and lose the Dao, and so come to this? Or did you suffer the fall of a state, the execution of the axe and halberd, and so come to this? Or did you commit some unworthy deed, bringing shame upon your parents, wife, and children, and so come to this? Or did you endure the miseries of cold and hunger, and so come to this? Or did your years naturally reach their end and so bring you to this?"*

When he finished speaking, he took the skull as a pillow and lay down to sleep. In the dead of night, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said: *"Your words resemble those of a sophist. Yao notes: *'The Zhang Junfang edition includes the character 'xiang' (向) before 'zi' (子).'* All that you have spoken are the burdens of the living; in death, none of these remain. Would you hear the discourse on death?"*

Zhuangzi said: "Very well."

The skull replied: "In death, there is no lord above, no subject below, nor the affairs of the four seasons. Freely and at ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it."

Zhuangzi did not believe him and said: "If I had the Controller of Fate restore your form, giving you bones, flesh, and skin, and return you to your parents, wife, children, village, and acquaintances, would you desire this?"

The skull knit its brows deeply and said: "How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south and return to the toils of the human world?"

---

When Yan Hui was traveling east to Qi, Confucius wore a worried look. Zigong stepped down from his mat and asked: "This disciple ventures to ask: when Hui travels east to Qi, Master, why do you wear a worried look?"

Confucius said: "Your question is excellent! Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I greatly admired: *'A small sack cannot hold a large thing; a short rope cannot draw from a deep well.'* Guo Qingfan notes: *'This saying appears in the Guanzi.'* As Guo Pu explains: *'The Yupian states: "褚 is a garment bag." The character is sometimes written as ●. The Zhongjing yinyi cites the Tongsu wen: "A garment bag is called ●." The Shuowen jizhuan says: "褚 is the sack of a garment." The Jiyun states: "It is a bag." The Zuo zhuan (Cheng 3) records: "A merchant of Zheng had a lamb he placed in a褚 to carry out." Thus, a褚 can hold things, or even a person.'*

Such is the case because destiny has its completion and form has its proper place—neither can be diminished nor augmented. I fear that Hui will speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Dao of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor, and further expound the words of Suiren and Shennong. The marquis will seek within himself and find nothing, and finding nothing, he will be perplexed. When a man is perplexed, he brings about his own death."

Ji Cheng comments: *"Finding no resolution, his heart will breed doubt. Resentful of one who surpasses him, he will surely kill Yanzi."*

"Have you alone not heard? Long ago, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu welcomed it and offered it wine in the ancestral temple. Sima Biao notes: *'The Guoyu states: "A bird called Yuanju alighted outside the eastern gate of Lu for three days, and Zang Wenzhong had the people of the state sacrifice to it." It does not mention the Lord of Lu. Yuanju, also called Zaxian, holds its head eight feet high.' The Erya, with commentary by Fan Guang, says: 'Its form resembles the phoenix.'* The lord had the *Nine Shao* performed for its entertainment and prepared a grand feast of the finest meats. The bird, however, was dazed and sorrowful, dared not eat a single morsel, nor drink a single cup, and died after three days. This was nourishing the bird with what nourishes oneself, not nourishing the bird with what nourishes a bird.

To nourish a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, wander on lakeside shores—Guo Pu comments: *'坛陆 refers to lake islets.'*—float upon rivers and lakes, feed on loach and whitebait—Ji Cheng comments: *'泥 refers to loach; 鲦 refers to whitebait.'*—rest in formation, and dwell at ease. The passage from *'Long ago, a seabird...'* to this point is also cited in the *Chapter on Perfecting Life.*

That one alone detests the sound of human speech—why then subject it to such clamor?" Ji Cheng comments: *"譊 means clamorous noise."*

If the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* were performed in the wilds of Dongting, birds would hear it and fly away, beasts would hear it and flee, fish would hear it and dive deep, while men, upon hearing it suddenly, would gather round to observe. Only humans delight in observing such spectacles."

Fish live in water, yet humans die in it—thus they must differ in nature. Their likes and dislikes fundamentally diverge.

Therefore, the ancient sages did not impose uniformity in abilities nor demand sameness in tasks. Ji Cheng comments: *"The sage follows the nature of things, treating people as vessels—each with distinct capacities, each suited to their disposition, each engaged in different affairs."*

Names are bounded by reality. Ji Cheng comments: *"Names arise from reality; names summon reality. Thus names are confined to reality, never seeking beyond what is real."*

Principles are established for suitability. Ji Cheng comments: *"They are set according to what is fitting, nothing more."*

This is what is called *"orderly coherence with fortune’s support."* Such a Dao may be described as one where principles flow smoothly and virtue sustains its hold.

Liezi was traveling and eating by the roadside—*The Chapter on Heavenly Portents* reads *"journeying to Wei"* instead of *"traveling."* He came upon a century-old skull,—*The Chapter on Heavenly Portents* includes *"man"* after *"came."*—plucked a clump of mugwort, and pointed to it, saying—Ji Cheng comments: *"攓 means to pull up."* *The Chapter on Heavenly Portents* reads: *"plucked mugwort, pointed, and said to his disciple Baifeng."*

*"Only you and I know that you have never died, never been born. Are you truly sorrowful? Am I truly joyful?"*

Prominent commentator Yu Yue notes: *"In the poem 'Two Sons Board a Boat,' the line '中心养养' interprets '养' as sorrow. This pairs antithetically with the following line's 'joy.'"*

The *Shiwen* records: *"The Yuanjia edition reads '若果' as '汝过' and '予过' as '子过.'"*

Editorial note: *The Chapter on Heavenly Portents* renders this as *"此过养乎，此过欢乎,"* aligning with the Yuanjia edition’s two instances of *"过,"* though the meaning remains unsatisfactory—likely corrupt.

How many kinds are there?

Ji Cheng comments: *"Yin and yang create things in endless transformation; their kinds cannot be enumerated."*

When it obtains water, it becomes *●*. The *Shiwen* notes: *"This is an ancient character for '絶,' pronounced 'jué' by Xu Shen, now read as 'jì.' Sima Biao’s edition writes '继.' Some versions render it as '断' or '续断.'"*

Lu Wenchang observes: *"The ancient character for '絶' should be '继,' making this '●' the character '继.'"*

Ji Cheng explains: *"Moist qi generates beings, proceeding from non-being to being, thus mutually continuing one another."*

Editorial note: In the *Erya*’s *"Release of Plants,"* under *"藚, 牛唇,"* Guo Pu’s commentary cites the *Mao Shi Zhuan*: *"Water plantain, resembling '续断,' jointed every inch—when plucked, it regrows."* The *Shuowen* defines *"藚"* as *"water plantain."*

Hao Yixing remarks: *"Examining today’s '马舄' growing in water, its flowers resemble plantain but larger; when plucked, it regrows joint by joint."* Thus, it is named *●*. Some versions write *"断,"* while others *"续断"*—the former likely miscopies *"●"* as *"断,"* with later hands erroneously adding *"续."*

*"藚"* resembles *"续断,"* yet the two are distinct: one grows in mountain valleys, the other in water. Its joint-by-joint regrowth, rootless and unattached to soil, earns it the name *"water plantain,"* matching the text’s *"obtains water and becomes ●."* *The Chapter on Heavenly Portents* includes the line *"if a frog becomes a quail,"* whose meaning remains unclear.

When it obtains the boundary of water and soil, it becomes *"frog-skin moss."* Sima Biao explains: *"This refers to things rooted at the water-soil boundary, spreading in water yet invisible from above. Pressing down, one finds it—like stretched silk in water, called 'frog-skin moss' in Chu."* (The Liezi commentary mistakenly writes *"土"* for *"水."*)

Ji Cheng comments: *"It is green moss, appearing in water like stretched silk—commonly called 'toad-skin moss.'"*

Editorial note: This describes growth at the water-soil boundary, not merely a waterborne plant. The *Erya*’s *"Release of Plants"* lists *"芣卫, 马舄"* and *"马舄, 车前."* Guo Pu’s commentary: *"Today’s '车前草,' with large leaves and long spikes, thrives by roadsides; in Jiangdong, it is called 'toad-skin moss.'"*

Thus, *"toad-skin moss"* is neither green moss nor what Sima Biao describes. The *Erya* also lists *"蕍, 蕮,"* with Guo Pu’s note: *"Today’s '泽蕮.'"*

Editorial note: This is *"泽泻."* The *Bencao* states: *"Also called '水舄' (i.e., '木舄')."* Tao Hongjing’s commentary: *"Narrow, long leaves, clustering in shallow water."* Su Song’s *Tu Jing*: *"Leaves resemble '牛舌草,' single and elongated; in autumn, it bears white flowers in clusters like '谷精草.' Roots are harvested in late autumn and dried."*

This obtains the water-soil boundary, hence its harvestable roots. The *Wen Xuan* commentary cites Han Ying’s *Han Shi Zhangju*: *"芣卫 is '泽舄.'"*

Lu Ji’s *Mao Shi Caomu Niao Shou Chong Yu Shu* notes: *"马舄, called '牛舌草' in Youzhou."* Given their similar leaves and the interchangeable names *"水舄,"* *"泽舄,"* and *"芣卫,"* the name *"toad-skin moss"* was mistakenly applied to the roadside *"陵舄,"* a confusion now unquestioned.

When it grows on dry mounds, it becomes *"mound plantain."* Sima Biao explains: *"Things formed by water but born on land, growing on mounds, transform into '车前'—renamed '陵舄.' Also called '泽舄,' changing with moisture or dryness."* (This further evidences name conflation.)

Editorial note: Zhang Zhan’s *Liezi* commentary defines *"陵屯"* as *"high, pure places,"* generally meaning waterless terrain. The *Shi*’s *"芣卫"* *Shiwen* cites Lu Ji: *"牛舌, also called '当道.'"*

Han Ying’s *Han Shi* states: *"Growing straight is '车前'; growing crooked is '芣卫.'"*

This distinguishes growth in straight paths from roadsides. *"Straight path"* and *"当道"* align with *"grows on dry mounds."* *"陵舄"* obtaining *"郁栖"* becomes *"crow’s foot."*

Sima Biao explains: *"郁栖 is an insect’s name; '乌足' is a plant growing by water. When '郁栖' dwells in '陵舄,' it transforms into '乌足.'"*

Li comments: *"郁栖 is manure. '陵舄' in manure becomes '乌足.'"*

Editorial note: *"郁栖"* is manure, not an insect—see below. The root of *"乌足"* becomes *"蛴螬."* Sima Biao’s edition writes *"螬蛴,"* explaining: *"A scorpion."*

Editorial note: *"蛴螬"* and *"螬蛴"* are distinct. The *Erya*’s *"Release of Insects"* lists *"蟦蛴螬,"* with Guo Pu’s note: *"Found in dung."* It also lists *"蝤蛴, 蝎,"* with Guo Pu: *"Found in wood. Though both are called '蝎,' their habitats differ."*

The *Shi*’s *"领如蝤蛴"* appears in Cai Yong’s *Qing Yi Fu* as *"领如螬蛴,"* showing *"蝤"* and *"螬"* are interchangeable. The *Shuowen* defines *"蝤"* as *"蝤●"* and *"蝎"* as *"蝤●."* It further states: *"● is ●●"* and *"● is ●●."*

Based on this, we know that Sima’s edition erroneously conflates the two. The *Shuowen* lacks the character 「蟦」; 「蟦」 is likely a phonetic loan for 「粪」. Since "乌足" arises from "陵舄" in manure-rich soil, its root dwelling in dung and emerging as "蛴螬" is all the clearer. The *Bencao* states: *"蟦蛴 grows in the marshes of Henan and in household dung heaps; those that move backward are superior."* Tao’s commentary: *"蛴 is also written as 蠀."* The *Fangyan*: *"蠀螬 is called 蟦."* 「蛴」 and 「蠀」 share the same initial consonant. Its leaves become butterflies. The largest are as big as a thumb, moving by their arms—faster than by foot—from summer into autumn, transforming into cicadas. The *Lunheng*’s "Wu Xing" chapter states: *"蛴螬 transforms into 复育, and 复育 transforms into cicadas,"* which confirms this. Butterflies, *xu* also, transform into insects. The *Shiwen* notes: *"Butterflies are also called 胥."* Yu Yue comments: *"‘胥也’ should be read together with ‘化而为虫,’ parallel to the following ‘鸲掇千日为鸟.’ ‘千日为鸟’ speaks of its slowness, while ‘胥也化而为虫’ speaks of its swiftness."* The *Tianrui* chapter’s *Shiwen* explains: *"胥 means ‘little,’ referring to a short time."* It is born beneath the stove, resembling a molted skin (蜕). Its name is *quduo*. In the *Tianrui* chapter, 「鸲」 is written as 「鸲」, the same character. *Quduo* after a thousand days—Zhang’s commentary: *"dies after a thousand days"*—becomes a bird called *ganyugu*. The *Tianrui* chapter includes the words 「化而」 before 「为」. The saliva of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. Li explains: *"Saliva is the fluid in its mouth."* *Simi* becomes *shixi*. Yi Lücheng comments: *"The midges in vinegar jars also become vinegar flies."* Born from *shixi*, *huangkuang*—the *Tianrui* chapter adds the four characters 「食酰颐辂」 before 「生」. Born from *jiuyou*—the *Tianrui* chapter adds the four characters 「食酰黄軦」 before 「生」. *Maorui* is born from *fuxuan*. Cheng comments: *"Fuxuan refers to fireflies, also said to be the insects of powdered mice."* The *Shiwen*: *"Pronounced *quan*, Guo pronounces it *huan*. The *Erya* states: ‘Also called 守瓜.’ Another says: powdered mice."* Note: The *Tianrui* chapter includes the sentence 「九猷生乎瞀芮」 above this, with Zhang’s commentary: *"蠸 pronounced *quan*, referring to the yellow beetle in melons."* "羊奚 compared to 不●"—"old bamboo gives birth to 青宁." The *Shiwen* treats 「羊奚比乎不●」 and 「久竹生青宁」 as separate sentences. Sima comments: *"羊奚 is a plant whose root resembles turnip; when it combines with old bamboo, they form a new entity, both arising from disparate kinds. 青宁 is an insect’s name."* Sima thus reads 「久竹」 as part of the preceding clause. Zhang Zhan’s reading aligns with Lu’s, with the note for 「羊奚」: *"These are different kinds that form an affinity,"* and for 「久竹」: *"It arises in forests and marshes."* Neither offers a definitive explanation, so it remains unclear which is correct. Additionally, the *Tianrui* chapter includes twenty-two sentences from 「羊肝化为地皋」 to 「酰鸡生乎酒」 above this, which *Zhuangzi* omits. 青宁 gives birth to *cheng*. Cheng comments: *"A red insect’s name."* *Cheng* gives birth to horses, horses give birth to humans, and humans eventually return to the *mechanism*. Yu Yue comments: *"‘又’ should be ‘久,’ a scribal error. ‘久’ means ‘old.’"* The *Tianrui* chapter reads: *"人久入于机."* All things emerge from the *mechanism* and return to the *mechanism*.

**Outer Chapters, "Da Sheng" (Chapter 19)**

Those who grasp the essence of life do not pursue what is useless to life. Xuan comments: *"Pursuing useless nourishment is what life has no need for."* Those who grasp the essence of fate do not pursue what knowledge cannot alter. Xuan comments: *"What numbers cannot compel is what knowledge cannot alter."* Nurturing the body must begin with material things. Cheng comments: *"Referring to wealth, clothing, and food."* Yet there are cases where material things are abundant but the body is not nourished. Xuan comments: *"Ultimately, material things are insufficient to nourish the body."* Life must first avoid separation from the body, yet there are cases where the body remains intact but life perishes. Xuan comments: *"Ultimately, the body is insufficient to preserve life."* Life’s arrival cannot be refused, nor its departure halted. How lamentable! The world believes that nurturing the body is enough to preserve life, yet nurturing the body is ultimately insufficient to preserve life—then what in the world is worth doing? Though it is insufficient, it cannot be left undone. One cannot escape doing it. Cheng comments: *"Extraneous matters are insufficient to pursue, but essential matters cannot be neglected."* To avoid serving the body, nothing is better than abandoning the world. Abandoning the world means no entanglements; no entanglements means equilibrium. Xuan comments: *"Wandering on level ground."* Equilibrium means alternating renewal with it. Xuan comments: *"Alternating renewal with the transformations of creation."* Alternating renewal brings one close to it. Xuan comments: *"Approaching the Dao."* What need is there to abandon affairs or forsake life? Cheng comments: *"The world’s emptiness—what need is there to discard it? Life’s illusions—what need is there to forget them?"* Abandoning affairs means the body is not wearied; forsaking life means the essence is not depleted. When the body is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Xuan comments: *"Aligning with the spontaneity of creation."* Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: when united, they form a body; when dispersed, they become a beginning. Xuan comments: *"What disperses here becomes the beginning of what forms there."* When body and essence are not depleted, this is called *transformation*.

Shifting the power of creation itself. Refining essence ever more finely, one returns to assist Heaven. Xuan comments: *"To cultivate essence to its utmost is to rely on its participation in transformation and nurturance."*

Master Liezi asked Master Guan Yin: Li comments: *"Guan Yin is Guan Yinxi, the Magistrate of the Pass."* Cheng comments: *"His surname was Yin, given name Xi, courtesy name Gongdu. As Magistrate of Hangu Pass, he was called Master Guan Yin. A perfected person and disciple of Laozi, he embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue—hence Liezi’s inquiry."*

"The perfected person moves in concealment without obstruction." Cheng comments: *"Moving through the world in concealment, undeterred by external conditions."* Note: The *Liezi*’s *Huangdi* chapter reads *"without emptiness."* "They tread through fire without scorching, walk above the myriad things without trembling." Cheng comments: *"Unmoved by cold or heat, fire cannot harm them; undisturbed by high or low, their hearts know no fear."*

"May I ask how one attains this?"

Master Guan Yin replied: *"This is the preservation of pure qi, not the domain of cunning knowledge or bold decisiveness."* Cheng comments: *"This is the safeguarding of pure, harmonious qi—not something attained through cleverness, deceit, or reckless courage."*

"Sit! I shall tell you."

"All that possesses form, appearance, sound, or color belongs to the realm of things—how can one thing distance itself from another? Guo comments: *'Only the heartless stand apart.'* Why should any suffice to precede the rest? They are but forms, nothing more. Guo comments: *'All are but things of shape and color; none suffice to surpass the others.'* Yao comments: *'The Jiangnan edition includes the character "form" above "color."'*

Thus, things extend into the formless and rest where transformation ceases. As Liezi’s Zhang Zhan annotates: *'If existence has no beginning, then what it creates is formless; if form has no end, then where it rests knows no transformation.'* One who attains this and exhausts its depths—Guo comments: *'To fathom this with the heart.'*—how could things ever constrain them? Cheng comments: *'Not bound by things.'* Note: The *Huangdi* chapter omits the character *'thing'* and erroneously renders *'and rest'* as *'is called.'*

They dwell within the measure of no excess, Guo comments: *'Abiding within the bounds of what is received.'* Note: The *Huangdi* chapter erroneously renders *'excess'* as *'profound.'* Concealing themselves in the traceless principle, Guo comments: *'Obscurely renewing with the transformations of each day.'* Roaming where the myriad things begin and end, Guo comments: *'Beginning and end are the limits of things.'* They unify their nature, Guo comments: *'Adornment divides it.'* Nurture their qi, Guo comments: *'Not employing the heart to command it.'* Harmonize their virtue, Guo comments: *'Not allowing things to sever their nature.'* Note: The *Huangdi* chapter renders *'harmonize'* as *'contain.'* Thus, they commune with the source of all things. Cheng comments: *'The source of all things is spontaneity. Having unified their nature and harmonized their virtue, they respond to things—hence they penetrate the origin of the Dao and commune with the root of spontaneity.'*

Those who are thus preserve the wholeness of Heaven; their spirit knows no fissure—no gap. How could things ever intrude? External afflictions cannot enter."

The drunkard who falls from a carriage, though moving swiftly, does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling; death and life, terror and fear do not enter his breast. Thus, he encounters things without dread.

*Shiwen* notes: *"‘遌’ is pronounced ‘wu.’ The *Erya* states: ‘遌 means opposition.’ Guo’s commentary says: ‘It refers to clashing or striking.’ ‘慑’ means fear."* Lu comments: *"Modern editions write it as ‘悟.’"*

If one preserved in wine can be thus, how much more so one preserved in Heaven! The sage hides within Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.

Here ends the quotation from the *Liezi*.

The avenger does not break the *Mo* or *Gan* swords—*Mo Ye* and *Gan Jiang*. Even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a flying tile; thus, the world remains in balance. Therefore, there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of slaughter—this is the Way’s doing.

Do not open the Heaven of man, but open the Heaven of Heaven. Guo comments: *"Knowing without deliberation is opening the Heaven of Heaven; responding after cognition is opening the Heaven of man. Thus, opening the Heaven of Heaven is the movement of nature; opening the Heaven of man is the function of knowledge."* Opening the Heaven of Heaven gives birth to virtue. Guo comments: *"When nature moves, it meets things appropriately, is content and forgets excess—thus virtue is born."* Opening the Heaven of man gives birth to harm. Guo comments: *"When knowledge is employed, it seeks from stimuli and wearies without cease—thus harm is born."*

Do not weary of Heaven, do not neglect man: constantly guard Heaven’s virtue—this is not wearying of Heaven; intelligence illuminates things—this is not neglecting man. The people thus draw near to their true nature. *"几"* means "near."

Cheng comments: *"When all under heaven abide in the genuine, the living world knows no artifice."*

Confucius, traveling to Chu, emerged into a forest and saw a hunchbacked man catching cicadas with a pole, as if merely plucking them. Cheng comments: *"痀偻 describes the bent posture of an old man. 承蜩 means catching cicadas with a pole. 掇 means to pick up."* Guo Qingfan notes: *"承 should be read as 拯, meaning to draw or take. The *Shuowen* writes it as ●. In the *Liezi*'s 'Yellow Emperor' chapter, it says: 『He had his disciples stand side by side in the current to 承 them.』 The *Exegesis* reads: 『承 is pronounced as 拯.』"* Note: In the "Yellow Emperor" chapter, "偻" is written as "慺," a loan character.

Confucius said: *"Are you skillful? Do you have a Dao?"*
The man replied: *"I have a Dao. For five or six months, I stack pellets [on the pole]. Sima comments: 『Five or six months is the time when cicadas cling [to branches]. 累丸 means stacking them on the tip of the pole.』"* Note: In the "Yellow Emperor" chapter, "累丸" is written as "累垸."
*"If I stack two and they do not fall, I lose only a trifling amount—perhaps two or three out of ten. If I stack three and they do not fall, I lose only one in ten. If I stack five and they do not fall, it is as if I am merely plucking them. I position my body as if it were a withered stump, fixed in place."* The *Exegesis* notes: *"厥 may be written as 橛 in some editions."* Note: This refers to a wooden stake. *"株 means the root of a tree. The body is held as firmly as a stake or root."* In the "Yellow Emperor" chapter, it is written as "橛株驹," using loan characters.
*"I hold my arm as if it were a branch of withered wood."* Guo comments: *"This is the height of stillness."*
*"Though the greatness of heaven and earth and the multitude of the ten thousand things, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn or shift my focus; I do not let the ten thousand things replace the wings of the cicada. How could I fail to succeed!"*

Confucius turned to his disciples and said: *"Where intention is undivided, it congeals into spirit."* In the "Yellow Emperor" chapter, "凝" is written as "疑," which is correct. Below, *"the ferryman steers the boat as if by spirit,"* *"onlookers are startled as if by ghosts or spirits,"* and *"the vessel’s ability to 疑神"* all share this meaning of "疑于神." *"This is what the hunchbacked elder means!"*

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, saying: *"I once crossed the Shāngshēn Abyss—Cheng comments: 'The name of an abyss in the state of Song.'—where the ferryman steered the boat as if by spirit. I asked him, 'Can one learn to steer a boat?' He replied, 'Yes. Those skilled in swimming can do so quickly. Those adept at floating on water can master it through repeated practice. The 'Yellow Emperor' chapter contains the line: *"Those who can swim may be taught."* As for divers, they have never seen a boat before yet can steer it at once.' A diver is one who can submerge in water. Though he has never seen a boat before, once aboard, he can steer it immediately. In the 'Yellow Emperor' chapter, 'at once' is written as 'sù,' with the note: 'Sù means to rise.' I asked him further, but he would not tell me. May I ask what this means?"*

Confucius said: *"Those skilled in swimming can do so quickly because they have forgotten the water. The 'Yellow Emperor' chapter adds two lines before this: *'Those who can swim may be taught, for they treat water lightly.'* As for the diver who has never seen a boat yet can steer it at once, he regards the abyss as if it were a hill, without fear of capsizing or drowning. He sees the boat’s overturning as no different from his carriage rolling backward. Guo comments: *'He regards the boat’s overturning in the abyss as a carriage rolling back on a slope.'* Though a thousand shifts and turns lie before him, none can enter his dwelling—The 'Yellow Emperor' chapter includes the word 'things' after 'thousand,' which is correct. The lines read: *'Though a thousand things overturn and shift, none can enter his dwelling.'* Yu comments: *'Fāng means "alongside." Its original meaning refers to two boats sailing side by side, hence it carries the sense of "together." Fāng chén hū qián means "a thousand things arrayed together before him."'* Zhang’s note: *'The abode of spirit is called a dwelling.'* Where could he not find leisure?—Xuan comments: *'With spirit settled, one is at ease everywhere.'*

One who stakes earthenware becomes skillful—Li comments: *'Zhù means to strike.'* Cheng comments: *'When gambling with worthless clay vessels, one feels no attachment, hence strikes with skill.'* Note: In the 'Yellow Emperor' chapter, 'zhù' is written as 'kōu,' with Zhang’s note: *'Kōu means to probe. To hide an object in the hand and retrieve it by probing.'* One who stakes a hook grows cautious—Cheng comments: *'When gambling with a hook, the object is slightly more valuable, so one fears missing and thus becomes timid and unsteady.'* Note: Zhang’s note: *'A hook is made of silver or bronze.'* One who stakes gold becomes ●—The *Shiwen* notes: *'One version writes ●. The *Shuowen* says: "● means confusion." The Yuánjiā edition writes "hūn."'* Note: The 'Yellow Emperor' chapter writes 'hūn.' Guo comments: *'The greater the stake, the more one clings to it.'* Though their skill is the same, where there is attachment, one values externals. Whoever values externals is clumsy within."*

Tian Kaizhi was received by Duke Wei of Zhou.

Cui’s edition reads *"Duke Wei of Zhou’s Kitchen."* Yu comments: *"The *Records of the Grand Historian* does not record the name of Duke Wei, son of Duke Huan of Western Zhou; Cui’s edition may thus supplement the historical lacuna."* Duke Wei said: *"I have heard that Zhu Shen studies the Way of nurturing life."* Sima comments: *"Studies the Dao of nourishing life."* *"You, sir, have associated with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?"* Tian Kaizhi replied: *"Kaizhi merely grasps a broom to lean against the gate and courtyard."* Cheng comments: *"A broom for sweeping."* *"What could I have learned from the Master!"* Duke Wei said: *"Do not decline, Master Tian! I wish to hear it."* Kaizhi said: *"I heard the Master say: ‘One who is good at nurturing life is like a shepherd: he watches those lagging behind and whips them.’"* Guo Songtao comments: *"To whip those behind is to make those ahead proceed at ease."* Note: The meaning is to carefully maintain one’s end. Duke Wei said: *"What does this mean?"*

Tian Kaizhi said: "In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who dwelt in the cliffs and drank from streams, sharing no profit with the people. At seventy he still had the complexion of an infant, yet by misfortune he met a starving tiger, and the tiger killed and ate him." Su Yu comments: "This speaks of failing to guard against peril on the road." "There was also a man named Zhang Yi who, whether at high gates or curtained thresholds—Xuan comments: 'High gates refer to great households; hanging curtains to screen the door belong to lesser ones'—would run wherever he went. Lüshi Chunqiu's 'Must Oneself' chapter says: 'Zhang Yi was fond of reverence; at gates, curtains, or gatherings, he would hasten without fail.' Gao You notes: 'He would hasten whenever passing by.' The *Huainanzi*'s 'Among Men' chapter states: 'Zhang Yi was fond of reverence; passing palaces or ancestral temples, he would hasten; seeing gates or crowds, he would dismount. Even with grave-diggers or grooms, he exchanged courtesies, yet he did not live out his years, dying of internal heat.'" Yu comments: "‘Run’ is a corrupted form of ‘hasten.’ The *Zhuangzi*’s text is incomplete, so scholars cannot grasp its meaning." At forty he suffered from the illness of internal heat and died. This speaks of exhausting the body to no benefit. Bao nurtured his inner self yet was devoured by a tiger from without; Yi nurtured his outer self yet was assailed by illness from within. These two men both failed to whip those lagging behind."

Confucius said: "Do not retreat into concealment, do not emerge into exposure—Xuan comments: 'Lest one be either too still or too active'—but stand like a withered tree at the center. Xuan comments: 'Like a hollowed tree without intent, standing amid motion and stillness.' If these three are attained, one’s name will surely reach its utmost. Xuan comments: 'One may be called a perfected person.' Now, those who fear the road: if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another, and only with a great host of armed men will they dare to venture forth—are they not wise? Yet what men truly ought to fear—Su Yu comments: 'Ought most to fear'—lies upon their sleeping mats and between their meals, yet they do not guard against it. This is their error." Guo comments: "Though only one in ten is killed, they greatly fear it. But the harms of sensual desire all lead to death, and none fail to rush headlong into them. This is a far greater error."

The invocator, clad in dark ceremonial robes, approached the pen and addressed the pig—Cheng comments: "The invocator is the invocator-priest. *Xuan duan* is his ritual attire. The *ce* is the pen. Before the sacrifice, he approaches the pen to address the pig, as the text below records"—saying: "Why do you hate death? I shall nourish you for three months—*Shiwen* notes: '● is pronounced *huan*; Sima explains: "To nourish."'—then purify you for ten days, fast for three, spread white couch-grass, and place your shoulder and rump upon the carved sacrificial platter. Would you prefer that?" Speaking on the pig’s behalf, he said: "Better to eat chaff and husks and be left in the pen." *Cuo* means to place. He thus imagined the pig’s preference. But if planning for himself, he would accept a life of noble rank with carriages and caps, and in death be placed upon the hearse—*Sima* comments: "*Dun* is like *zhuan* (carved); *dun* is like *an* (table)." Wang Niansun comments: "*Dun* should be read as *quan*, meaning the funeral carriage. The *Zaji* states: 'The coffin is carried on the *tui* carriage,' and Zheng Xuan notes: '*Tui* is read as *quan*.' *Shiwen* notes: '*Quan* is pronounced *shi zhuan* or *shi zhuan*.' The *Rites of Zhou* calls it the *shen* carriage; the *Zaji* calls it the *tuan*. It may be written as *quan* or *tuan*, with similar pronunciation and meaning. Here it is written *dun*, but the sense is the same. *Dun* should be read as *chun*, also a funeral carriage. *Chun* and *dun* are interchangeable, as evidenced by Zheng Xuan’s note in the *Zaji*: 'The coffin is carried on the *dun*.'"—amid the gathered trappings—*Shiwen* notes: "One explanation: *lou* should be *lou*, pronounced *li jiu*. It refers to burial amid rushes and reeds." Wang Niansun comments: "*Julou* refers to the ornaments of the funeral carriage. Many adornments are gathered, hence *ju* (gathered); its shape is high in the center and low at the edges, hence *lou* (bent). The *Shiming* states: 'The carriage for the coffin has a cover called *liu*. *Liu* means gathered, for many adornments are gathered, and its shape is bent.' The *Tan Gong* speaks of 'setting up *lou sha*'; the *Xunzi*'s 'Discourse on Ritual' writes it as *lü sha*; the *Lüshi Chunqiu*'s 'Moderating Mourning' chapter writes it as *lou sha*. *Liu*, *lou*, *lou*, and *lü* are variant characters with the same meaning."—without regard for future consequences.

To plan for a pig is to discard it; to plan for oneself is to keep it—how does one differ from a pig?

Duke Huan was hunting in the marshes, with Guan Zhong driving his chariot, when he saw a ghost. The Duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked, “What did you see, Father Zhong?” Guan Zhong replied, “*Your servant* saw nothing.” The Duke returned, stricken with *eiyi* illness, and for days did not emerge.

*Shiwen* notes: “*Ei* is pronounced *yudai*; Guo reads it as *xi*. *Yi* is pronounced *tudai*; Guo reads it as *yi*. Li reads it as *tai*, explaining: ‘*Eiyi* refers to the loss of one’s hun and po.’”

A Qi scholar named Huangzi Gao’ao said, “If the Duke has harmed himself, how can a ghost harm him?—*Sima* notes: ‘Huang is the surname; Gao’ao is the courtesy name.’ When the *qi* of pent-up anger disperses and does not return, it results in deficiency. Li explains: ‘*Fen* means fullness; *chu* means coagulation. When the spirit is obstructed, yin and yang congeal within, while hun and po scatter without—hence the term *deficiency*.’ If it ascends but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger; if it descends but does not ascend, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. Li explains: ‘When yang scatters and yin congeals, anger arises; when yin surges and yang recedes, forgetfulness follows.’ If it neither ascends nor descends but lodges in the body at the heart, it causes illness.” Li explains: “When above and below fall out of harmony, yin and yang contend and attack the heart—the heart being the master of spirit—hence illness.”

Duke Huan asked, “Then do ghosts exist?” The scholar replied, “They do.”

"In the depths there are *lü*; in the stove there are *ji*."
Annotation: "Sima’s version reads ‘In the depths there are *lou*’: ‘*Shen* (depths) refers to muddy water. *Lou* is the name of a spirit. *Ji* is the Stove God, clad in red, resembling a beautiful woman.’"

Within the filth of doorways, *Leiting* dwells.
Annotation: "Amid the foul soil inside gates, there is a ghost named *Leiting* (Thunderclap)."

In the northeast below, *Bei’a* and *Xielong* leap.
Annotation: "*Long* is pronounced as in *dragon*. Sima says: ‘*Bei’a* is the name of a spirit. *Xielong* resembles a child, one foot four inches tall, dressed in black with a red headscarf, wearing a large cap, bearing a sword and halberd.’"

In the northwest below, *Yiyang* resides.
Sima says: "*Yiyang* has the head of a leopard and the tail of a horse—some say a dog’s head, others that it is the name of a spirit."

In water there is *Wangxiang*."
Sima’s version reads "*Wushang*": "It resembles a child, with a reddish-black complexion, red claws, large ears, and long arms. Some say it is the name of a water spirit."

On mounds there is *Shen*."
Annotation: "An alternate version writes this as *shen*. Sima says: ‘It resembles a dog, with horns and a five-colored patterned body.’"

On mountains there is *Kui*."
Annotation: "It resembles a drum, with a single foot."

In the wilds there is *Panghuang*."
Annotation: "An alternate version writes this as *Fanghuang*. Sima says: ‘*Fanghuang* resembles a snake, with two heads and a five-colored pattern.’"

In marshes there is *Weiyi*."

The Duke said, "May I ask what *Weiyi* looks like?"
Prince Huangzi replied, "*Weiyi* is as large as a wheel hub and as long as a carriage shaft, clad in purple with a vermilion cap. As a creature, it is fearsome. When it hears the sound of a thunder chariot, it clasps its head and stands upright. Those who see it are nearly destined for hegemony."

Duke Huan burst into laughter and said, "This is what *I* have seen!"

The *Shiwen* annotation states: "‘Vermilion cap’—Sima’s version writes this as ‘*Yu* cap,’ explaining: ‘A cap from the state of *Yu*, its design resembling a conch shell.’"

Thereupon, [the Duke] straightened his robes and cap and sat with him. Before the day was out, he was unaware that his illness had departed.

Guo [Xiang] comments: "This speaks of how those who become burdened by worries when they arise fail to understand; those who regain their nature when troubles depart have attained the principle."

Master Jisheng reared fighting cocks for the king.

The *Shiwen* annotation states: "*Jisheng*—a person’s name. An alternate version writes this as *Xiao*." The *Liezi*’s "Yellow Emperor" chapter writes this as "King Xuan of Zhou."

After ten days, [the king] asked, "Is the cock ready?"

The "Yellow Emperor" chapter includes the words "fit for fighting" after "cock," which are omitted here.

[Jisheng] replied, "Not yet. It is still hollow and arrogant, relying on its qi."

Zhang’s commentary: "One without substance who prides itself."

After another ten days, [the king] asked again.

[Jisheng] replied, "Not yet. It still responds to calls and glances at shadows."

Li comments: "It responds to crowing and turns to look at its shadow."

After another ten days, [the king] asked again.

[Jisheng] replied, "Not yet. It still glares fiercely and bristles with qi."

Zhang’s commentary: "It constantly seeks opponents and insists on its own victory."

After another ten days, [the king] asked again.

[Jisheng] replied, "Almost. Though other cocks may crow, it no longer changes. As Zhang’s commentary states: ‘It ignores challenges from opponents and forgets victory or defeat.’ When viewed, it resembles a wooden cock; its virtue is complete."

Xuan comments: "Its spirit is concentrated and still."

No other cock dared respond—all turned and fled.

Guo [Xiang] comments: "Even one reared to perfection remains unmatched—how much more so one that perfects itself!"

Note: The "Yellow Emperor" chapter writes "耳" (*er*) instead of "矣" (*yi*).

Confucius observed the Lüliang Falls.

Sima comments: "A place where the river cuts through stone. Today, west of Lishi County in Xihe, there is such a gorge, commonly called Huangliang. The *Huainanzi* states: ‘In ancient times, the Dragon Gate was not yet carved, and the river flowed above Meng Gate.’"

Cheng comments: "Some say that two hundred *li* from Puzhou there is the Dragon Gate, where the river passes through a waterfall—also called Lüliang. Others say it refers to Lüliang in Pengcheng County of Song."

The water plunged thirty *ren* in height, its froth surging forty *li*, a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and assumed he was in distress, wishing to die—drowning himself out of sorrow or misfortune. He ordered his disciples to follow the current and rescue him.

(Note: "并" and "傍" are interchangeable.)

The *Huangdi* chapter writes "承" instead, an ancient interchangeable character. After several hundred paces, he emerged, hair unbound, singing as he swam beneath the embankment. The *Huangdi* chapter writes "棠行" instead.

Confucius followed and questioned him, saying: "I took you for a ghost, but observing you, you are a man. May I ask if there is a Dao for treading water?"

He replied: "No—there is no Dao for me. I began with the familiar, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny. I enter with the whirlpool and emerge with the surge. I follow the Way of water without imposing my will." Sima Biao comments: "齐 refers to the swirling water like a mill’s wheel." Guo Qingfan notes: "齐 is the center of things. The *Han Shu: Jiaosi Zhi* states, ‘齐 is so called because it aligns with the celestial center,’ with Su Lin’s commentary: ‘It is the central alignment of heaven.’" Wang Niansun observes: "The navel resides in the center of the abdomen, hence it is called 脐. 脐 is 齐." Xuan comments: "The water’s vortex resembles a navel." (Note: The *Huangdi* chapter writes "赍" in error.) Sima Biao comments: "汩 is the surging wave." Guo Xiang remarks: "One surrenders to the water rather than to oneself. This is how I tread it."

Confucius asked: "What do you mean by beginning with the familiar, growing with your nature, and fulfilling your destiny?"

He replied: "I was born on the mound and am at ease on the mound—this is the familiar. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is my nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is destiny." Guo Xiang comments: "When one possesses a particular ability and applies it where it belongs, nothing in the world is difficult. Using what is not difficult to traverse the Way of life and generation, where can one not pass through?"

A certain edition originally wrote "thousand" (千) in place of "ten" (十), which has been emended according to the *Jishi* edition and *Shiwen*.

Ziqing carved wood into a *ju*. Li [Yi] notes: "A grand artisan of Lu. *Zi* is an official title; Qing is his name." Yu [Yue] remarks: "The *Zuozhuan* of Duke Xiang’s fourth year mentions 'Artisan Qing,' who is this man." Sima [Biao] comments: "The *ju* is a musical instrument resembling the *jiazhong* bells." *Shiwen* reads: "Pronounced *ju*."

When the *ju* was completed, those who saw it marveled as though it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and asked, "What technique did you use to make it?" He replied: "I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Nevertheless, there is one thing. When I set out to make a *ju*, I never dared to deplete my *qi*, for Li [Yi] notes: '*Qi* depleted, the mind stirs; the mind stirred, the spirit is not concentrated.' I must fast to still my mind.

After fasting for three days, I dared not entertain thoughts of rewards, ranks, or emoluments." Xuan [Ying] comments: "Forgetting profit."

After five days, I dared not entertain thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness." Xuan comments: "Forgetting reputation."

After seven days, I suddenly forgot I had limbs and a body." *Shiwen* reads: "*Zheran*: a state of immobility." Xuan comments: "Forgetting the self."

At that time, I had no thought of court or state." Xuan comments: "Forgetting power. As if I were not carving for the public."

My skill became concentrated, and all external distractions dissolved." *Shiwen* reads: "*Gu* (bone) is also written as *hua* (distraction)." Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "*Hua* means disorder." Xuan comments: "All external matters that disturb the mind were dispelled."

Only then did I enter the mountain forest to observe the natural qualities of the wood." Xuan comments: "Examining the wood’s inherent grain."

When the form and material were perfectly matched, the *ju* appeared in its entirety—as if the whole instrument were already before my eyes. Only then did I apply my hands to it; thus I proceeded with the work. If not, I would abandon it." Otherwise, I would set it aside.

Thus I aligned the Heaven in me with the Heaven in the wood—my own Heaven encountering the wood’s Heaven. Is this not why the instrument seems divinely wrought?

This speaks of how following its nature makes craftsmanship as if spirit-like, while defying its nature labors the mind and mars the self. Dongye Ji demonstrated his charioteering before Duke Zhuang (in the *Xunzi* and *Aigong* chapter, "Dongye Bi" and "Duke Ding"). Advancing and retreating, he kept to the plumb-line; turning left and right, he traced the compass. Straight as a taut cord, round as a drawn circle. Duke Zhuang thought no patterned weave could surpass this. The Marshal of the Horse said: "No woven braid could exceed this." (This refers to the *Book of Songs* line: "Holding the reins like braided silk.")

He was made to loop a hundred times and return. Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "Letting the horses wheel about like a hook’s curve, a hundred circuits and returns, each retracing its path." Yan He (in the *Aigong* chapter, "Yan Yuan," referring to Duke Ding of Lu) met him and entered to say: "Ji’s horses are about to fail." The Duke remained silent and did not respond. Xuan comments: "Silent, saying nothing." Soon after, the horses indeed failed and returned. The Duke asked: "How did you know?"

He said: "The horses’ strength was exhausted, yet they were still driven—hence I said they would fail." Overtaxing leads to failure; nothing is otherwise. The artisan Chui could spin and surpass the compass and square. Xuan comments: "Surpass, meaning to exceed. With only his hands’ turning, his skill surpassed compass and square—such was his consummate precision." His fingers transformed with things yet did not linger in his mind. Cheng comments: "His hands followed things’ transformations, applying skill according to the object, his mind unburdened by deliberation." Thus his spirit-terrace was whole and unshackled. Xuan comments: "Spirit-terrace: the abode of the spirit. His spirit congealed without the suffering of constraint."

Feet forgotten—shoes’ comfort;
Waist forgotten—belt’s comfort;
Knowledge forgetting right and wrong—mind’s comfort;
No inner change, no outer compliance—events’ meeting’s comfort.
Within, the will unchanged; without, not following things, yet all encounters bring comfort. Beginning with comfort and never not comforted—this is the comfort of forgetting comfort. When one’s nature is inherently comfortable and nowhere is not comfort, this is self-comforting comfort, not comfort dependent on things. Thus even comfort itself is forgotten.

There was a man named Sun Xiu. Cheng comments: "A man of Lu." He came to the gate and addressed Master Bian Qingzi. Li comments: "Bian, the surname; Qingzi, the style." He said: "In my village, I am not called unrefined; in peril, I am not called cowardly. Yet when tilling the fields, I meet no favorable year; when serving a lord, I meet no favorable age. Shunned in my village, driven from my district—what offense have I committed against Heaven? Why must I suffer this fate?"

Sun Xiu exclaimed, "Alas!"—his voice a cry of despair. "I do not understand why I must meet with such a fate!"

Master Bian replied: "Have you alone not heard of the Perfect Person’s way of conduct? They forget their liver and gall, disregard their ears and eyes, let their body crumble, and cast aside their keen hearing and sharp sight. Vast and unbound, they wander beyond the dust and grime of the world—*dust and grime* here meaning the burdens of the vulgar. They roam freely in the work of no-occupation, which is called *acting without reliance, leading without domination*." Xuan comments: "Following one’s nature without relying on ability, guiding things without claiming merit." (This passage is from the *Laozi*.)

"Now you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose the filthy, and shine forth as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride—flaunting yourself to stand apart from others. These three lines also appear in the *Shanmu* chapter. You have preserved your whole bodily form, kept all nine orifices intact, and not halfway perished from deafness, blindness, lameness, or deformity to be counted among the ranks of men—this is already good fortune. Why then do you have leisure to complain against Heaven? Be on your way!"

Sun Xiu departed.

Bianzi entered and took his seat. After a while, he looked up to heaven and sighed.

His disciples asked, "Master, why do you sigh?"

Bianzi replied, "Earlier, Sun Xiu came, and I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person. I feared he would be startled and thus fall into confusion."

The disciples said, "Not so. If what Sun Xiu said was right and what you said was wrong, then what is wrong cannot confuse what is right. If what Sun Xiu said was wrong and what you said was right, then he was already confused when he came—what fault is that of yours?"

Bianzi said, "Not so. Once, a bird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu delighted in it and prepared a grand feast to entertain it, performing the *Nine Shao* to please it. The bird then grew anxious, sorrowful, and dizzy, and dared not eat or drink. This is called *nourishing a bird with what nourishes oneself*. As for *nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird*, one should let it roost in the deep forest, float upon rivers and lakes, feed it with *weiyis*, and settle it on level ground. (*Weiyi*: Li [Yi] says, 'A great bird that swallows snakes.' Sima [Biao] says, '*Weiyi* means mud.') Yu [Yue] says, 'Those who nourish birds have never been heard to feed them snakes, and "mud" is mere conjecture. In the *Zhile* chapter, it says, *"As for nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in the deep forest, wander on level ground, float upon rivers and lakes, feed it with *shu*, follow its ranks in flight, and dwell in *weiyi*." Thus, this passage should also read, *"feed it with *shu*, dwell in *weiyi*,"* for the transmitted text is missing characters. Moreover, only with *"and dwell"* does the phrase *"then settle it on level ground"* cohere; without these two characters, the following line does not connect.') Now, Sun Xiu is a man of shallow understanding and narrow vision." (Li [Yi] says, "*Kuan* means empty; *qi* means to open. Like an empty opening, his vision is small.) "I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfected person—this is like burdening a mouse with chariots and horses or delighting a sparrow with bells and drums. How could he not be startled?"

Guo [Xiang] says, "This chapter speaks of those who nourish life well: each attains the utmost by following the suitability of their nature." (*Outer Chapters, "Mountain Trees,"* Chapter Twenty)

Su Yu says, "This too is a record by Zhuangzi’s followers, its purport akin to *‘Amid the Human World’*—an art of dwelling in a turbid age and evading harm."

Zhuangzi walked in the mountains and saw a great tree, its branches and leaves lush and flourishing. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asked the reason, he replied, "It is of no use." Zhuangzi said, "This tree, by being useless, has attained its full natural span."

The Master emerged from the mountains—here meaning Zhuangzi—and lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend was pleased and ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, "One can caw, the other cannot. Which should we kill?" The host said, "Kill the one that cannot caw."

The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi, "Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, attained its full natural span. Today, the host’s goose, by being useless, met its death. Where will you, Master, take your stand?"

Zhuangzi laughed and said, "I will take my stand between usefulness and uselessness. Between usefulness and uselessness—it seems akin yet is not. Thus one is not yet free from entanglement. But if one rides the Dao and virtue, floating and wandering, it is not so. With the heart set on the Dao and virtue, there is no need to speak of usefulness or uselessness. Without praise, without blame, now a dragon, now a snake—now manifest, now hidden—one transforms with the times and refuses to cling to any single form. Now rising, now descending, taking harmony as one’s measure, one floats and wanders at the source of the ten thousand things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by things—how then could one be entangled? This is the method of the Yellow Emperor and Shennong.

As for the passions of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to destruction. Integrity invites injury, honor provokes censure. Action incurs loss, worth invites schemes, worthlessness invites deceit. How can one be certain of anything? One cannot escape entanglement. How lamentable! Disciples, take heed: it is only in the realm of the Dao and virtue!"

Shi Nan Yiliao visited the Marquis of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Yiliao asked, "My lord, why do you look so troubled?"

The Marquis of Lu replied, "I study the Way of the former kings and cultivate the undertakings of my predecessors. I revere the spirits and honor the worthy, practicing these without the slightest respite. Yet I cannot escape misfortune—this is why I am troubled."

Yiliao said, "My lord’s method of averting misfortune is shallow indeed. The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in rocky caves—this is stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance. Though hungry and thirsty, though hidden and secluded, they still venture cautiously upon the rivers and lakes in search of food—this is steadfastness. Yet they cannot escape the calamity of nets and traps. What is the fault here? It is their fur. Now, my lord’s state—what is its fur? I wish to hear how you govern it."

"Though the beasts remain hidden and secluded, they must still venture far upon the rivers and lakes—where no men tread—to seek their food. This is the steadfastness of their dwelling. Yet even so, they cannot escape the calamity of nets and snares. What fault is theirs? It is their fur that brings them disaster. Now, is not the state of Lu your fur? I wish for you to flay your form and shed your skin, to cleanse your heart and cast off desire, and wander in the wilds where no man dwells.

In the southern lands of Yue, there is a city called the Land of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unadorned, with little selfishness and few desires. They know how to act but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where duty leads, nor where propriety guides. Unrestrained and untethered, they tread the great Dao. Their lives are joyful, and their deaths are fitting to bury. As Guo Xiang says, 'One may dwell there from beginning to end.'

I wish for you to abandon your state, forsake custom, and walk in harmony with the Dao."

The lord said, "That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what am I to do?"

Yiliao said, "Be without arrogance in your form, without attachment to your dwelling—let this be your boat and carriage."

The lord said, "That Way is secluded and remote, with no people. With whom shall I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?"

Yiliao said, "Lessen your expenditures, reduce your desires. Though you have no provisions, you will find sufficiency. As Guo Xiang says, 'To know contentment is to lack nothing.' Cross the rivers and float upon the sea. Gaze upon it, and you will not see its shores. The farther you go, the less you will know its end. As Xuan says, 'To journey alone is to delve so deeply.' Those who see you off will turn back from the shore, for none can follow. From this point, you will be far indeed. As Guo Xiang says, 'You will stand transcendent and independent above the myriad things.'

Thus, to possess others is a burden; to be possessed by others is a worry. Yao did not possess others, nor was he possessed by them. I wish to rid you of your burdens, remove your worries, and wander alone with the Dao in the Land of Vastness.

When a double-hulled boat crosses the river, and an empty boat drifts into it, even a hot-tempered man would not grow angry. But if there were a man aboard, one would shout to open or close the way. If the first shout goes unheard, a second follows, and if that too is ignored, a third shout is sure to be accompanied by curses. Before, there was no anger—now there is. Before, the boat was empty—now it is full. This is the reason.

If a man can empty himself and wander through the world, who could harm him?"

Beigong She, a minister of Duke Ling of Wei, collected funds to cast bells. He built an altar outside the city gates and completed the upper and lower chimes in three months. As Xuan says, "The time was short, yet the funds gathered were vast."

Prince Qingji saw this and asked, "What method did you employ?"

She said, "In the space between, I dared not devise any method. My heart was set solely on the casting of the bells. I have heard: 'After carving and polishing, return to simplicity.' In this age of over-refinement, only sincerity can move people. I appeared artless and without knowledge, hoping only for success. I seemed hesitant and uncertain, fearing a lack of sincerity. I gathered and wandered, sending off the departing and welcoming the arriving. Those who came were not forbidden; those who left were not stopped. I indulged the strong-willed and followed those who clung to me, allowing them to exhaust themselves. Thus, from dawn to dusk, I gathered funds without the slightest harm—how much more so for those who tread the great thoroughfare of the Dao!"

Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren went to console him. As Li says, "Taigong is a title of nobility; Ren is his name." As Yu says, "The *Guangyun* records a surname Taigong, as in *Shiben*'s Taigong Ying Shu. Thus, Taigong is a compound surname, not merely a noble title."

Confucius said, "Were you nearly dead?"
He replied, "Yes."
"Did you detest death?"
He replied, "Yes."

Taigong Ren said, "I have once spoken of the Way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird, whose name is *Yidai*. As a bird, it is slow and sluggish, appearing incapable. It takes flight only with support and roosts only under pressure, never daring to be first in advancing or last in retreating. It does not dare to be the first to eat, but must take the leftovers. Thus, it is never expelled from the flock, and others never harm it, so it avoids disaster. The straight tree is the first felled; the sweet well is the first drained. As Guo says, 'This is the peril of talent.' You, with your intentions, adorn knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose filth, and shine forth as if bearing the sun and moon in your stride—these three phrases already appear in the *Da Sheng* chapter. Thus, you cannot escape harm. Long ago, I heard the Perfect One of Great Accomplishment say—Cheng says, 'The Perfect One of Great Accomplishment is Laozi'—'He who boasts achieves no merit; he who vaunts his success collapses; he who vaunts his fame suffers loss.' As Guo says, 'Those who rely on merit and fame as their accomplishment have never preserved wholeness.' Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common people? The Dao flows without dwelling in prominence; the Dao spreads throughout the world yet does not conspicuously occupy it. Virtue is enacted without claiming a place. Pure and constant, it is nearly akin to madness. Erasing traces and relinquishing power, it does not pursue merit or fame. Thus, it incurs no blame from others, and others incur no blame from it. The Perfected One remains unknown—this saying appears in the *Qiu Shui* chapter, where 'Perfected' is written as 'Dao.' Why then do you delight so greatly?"

Confucius exclaimed, "Excellent!" He then declined his social circles, dismissed his disciples, and fled to the great marshes. Clad in coarse furs and hemp, he ate acorns and chestnuts, forsaking fine garments and delicacies. Entering among beasts, he did not disrupt their herds; entering among birds, he did not disturb their flocks. Birds and beasts felt no aversion toward him—how much less would men!

Confucius asked Zisang Hu, "I have twice been banished from Lu, had my tree felled in Song, erased my traces in Wei, suffered destitution in Shang and Zhou, and been besieged between Chen and Cai. Having endured these many hardships, my close associates have grown more distant, and my followers have scattered further. Why is this?"

Zisang Hu replied, "Have you not heard of the man from Jia who fled? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and fled carrying his infant son. Someone asked, 'Was it for the sake of wealth? The child’s possessions are meager. Was it for the sake of burden? The child’s encumbrance is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a child and flee?' Lin Hui said, 'That was bound by profit; this is joined by Heaven.’ Those bound by profit abandon one another when pressed by poverty, misfortune, or harm; those joined by Heaven gather together when pressed by the same. The distance between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water, while the friendship of the petty is as sweet as sweet wine. The noble grow closer in their blandness, while the petty grow estranged in their sweetness. Those who unite without cause will part without cause."

Confucius said, "I respectfully receive your instruction." He then walked slowly, meandering as if in flight, returned home, abandoned his studies, and discarded his books. His disciples no longer deferred to him as before, yet their affection for him deepened all the more, for true sincerity had moved them.

One day, Sang Hu spoke again: "When Shun was about to die, he earnestly instructed Yu, saying, 'Be ever vigilant! In form, nothing is better than following; in feeling, nothing is better than sincerity. Following ensures no separation; sincerity ensures no exhaustion. Without separation or exhaustion, one does not seek adornment to match form; without seeking adornment to match form, one does not depend on external things.'"

Zhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his shoes with straightened hemp strands, and passed by King Hui of Wei. The king said, "Why is the Master so destitute?"

Zhuangzi replied, "This is poverty, not destitution. When a scholar possesses the Dao and virtue but cannot put them into practice, that is destitution. Wearing tattered clothes and worn-out shoes—this is poverty, not destitution. This is what is called not encountering the right time. Have you alone not seen the leaping monkeys?"

When they secure nan, zi, yu, and zhang trees, grasping their vines and branches, they lord it among them—lording it, as if to say, swelling with self-importance. Even Yi or Peng Meng could not cast a sidelong glance at them. Yet when they find themselves among zhe, ji, zhi, and gou trees, they tread warily, glance sideways, tremble and quake. This is not that their sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened or lost their suppleness; it is that their circumstances are unfavorable, and they cannot fully display their abilities. Now, to dwell among benighted rulers and chaotic ministers and yet wish to avoid destitution—how could this be possible? This is like Bi Gan, whose heart was carved out—a clear portent indeed!"

Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning left against a withered tree, striking its withered branches with his right hand, he sang the airs of the Biao clan—Biao being the same as Yan, as mentioned in the "Heavenly Revolutions" chapter. He had the instruments but not the rhythm, for though he struck the branches against the wood, there was no measure to it.

The song had its sound but lacked the proper notes of gong and jue—so Xuanzai notes: "There was singing but no musical harmony." Yet the sound of the wood and the human voice together struck the heart with a plow-like clarity—so Xuanzai explains: "Like the loosening of soil beneath the plow, it brought release." Yan Hui faced forward with folded hands, then turned his gaze to observe. Turning his gaze means looking back.

Fearing that Hui might grow complacent and reach grandiosity, or grow attached to himself and descend into sorrow—for "reaching" means arriving—Confucius said: "Hui! To not suffer the diminishment of Heaven is easy, as Guo notes: 'Only by accepting it does it become easy.' To not accept the benefits of others is difficult, as Cheng explains: 'What comes by chance and is entrusted to one—pushing it away is hard.' There is no beginning that is not also an end, as Guo observes: 'What is a beginning today was an end yesterday, so what we call a beginning is itself an end—speaking of the endlessness of transformation.' Man and Heaven are one, as Guo says: 'Both are natural.' Who, then, is the singer now?" Guo comments: "Let it be as it is; the singer is not I."

Hui asked: "May I ask why not suffering the diminishment of Heaven is easy?"

Confucius replied: "Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, confinement and immobility—these are the workings of Heaven and Earth, the unfolding of the movement of things, as Sima explains: 'Unfolding means manifesting.' To speak of going along with them is to say: as Xuanzai notes, 'Only by following the flow and going with them.' As a minister, one does not dare to flee them, as Xuanzai says: 'A minister, having received the ruler’s mandate, cannot in principle escape.' If even the Way of the minister is thus, how much more so the Way of awaiting Heaven!" To await Heaven with acceptance is to render diminishment powerless to diminish—hence it is easy.

Hui asked: "What do you mean by not accepting the benefits of others being difficult?"

Confucius replied: "At first, one’s path opens in all four directions, as Xuanzai notes: 'At first, when one advances, all four directions open without hindrance.' Rank and emolument arrive without end—such is the benefit from others. Yet what is advantageous to things is not one’s own, as Xuanzai says: 'This advantage to things has nothing to do with one’s inherent nature.' My fate lies beyond myself, as Xuanzai explains: 'This is merely the occasional alignment of my qi and destiny with external circumstances.' The noble man does not steal; the worthy man does not pilfer. If I were to take these, what would I be doing? As Xuanzai says: 'To accept rank and emolument emptily is no different from theft—something your kind of worthy man would not do. Why, then, would I take them?' Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the swallow. As the *Shiwen* notes: 'Wise here means knowing; some say the swallow is the swallow.' Where its eyes should not linger, it does not tarry in looking—when it sees where it should not be, it departs at once, not waiting to circle back. Even if its food falls, it abandons it and flies away. If it drops what it carries, it does not retrieve it. Though it fears humans, it nests among them, as Cheng explains: 'Nests means enters.' Yet it does so only because its refuge lies there—no different from a state’s altars of soil and grain, which people cannot abandon. When a noble man dwells in another’s state, he too must recognize that the altars of soil and grain are present and devote himself to his duties. As for the benefits of rank and emolument, they do not augment my nature. One should remember: 'Do not enter a state in peril; do not dwell in a state in chaos.' But those who understand this are few—hence it is difficult."

Hui asked: "What do you mean by there being no beginning that is not also an end?"

Confucius replied: "The transformation of the myriad things proceeds without our knowing who succeeds it—Heaven transforms and gives life to the myriad things, renewing them endlessly, yet we do not know who takes over in succession. How can we know its end? How can we know its beginning?"

Thus, there is no beginning that is not also an end—one must simply uphold correctness and await it. To maintain rectitude and await it is all.

Hui asked: "What do you mean by Heaven and man being one?"

Confucius replied: "When there is man, it is Heaven; when there is Heaven, it is also Heaven. As Xuan comments: 'Man and Heaven are both brought forth by Heaven. Heaven is the principle.' That man cannot possess Heaven is his nature. As Xuan comments: 'Man may fail to fully possess his Heaven, for his nature is subject to augmentation or diminution.' The sage, at ease, embodies the ceaseless passage of time and thus fulfills his end."

As Zhuang Zhou wandered near the fence of Diaoling, Sima Biao notes: "Diaoling is the name of a mound; *fan* means fence. He saw an unusual magpie coming from the south, its wings spanning seven feet, its eyes measuring a full inch in diameter. Wang Niansun observes: '*Yun* stands in parallel with *guang*; *guang* refers to breadth, so *yun* refers to length. *Mu da yun cun* means 'its eyes were a full inch in diameter.' In the *Yue Yu*, it says, '*Guang yun* a hundred *li*,' and Wei’s commentary explains: 'East-west is *guang*; south-north is *yun*.' Thus, *yun* refers to length." The magpie brushed against Zhuang Zhou’s forehead and alighted in the chestnut grove. Cheng comments: "*Gan* means to strike." Zhuang Zhou said: "What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly away; its eyes are large yet it does not see." He hitched up his robe, strode quickly forward, took up his sling, and waited for an opportunity. Sima comments: "*Jue* means to move swiftly; *liu* means to watch for an opening." He saw a cicada enjoying the fine shade and forgetting its own body; a mantis, seizing the cover of a leaf, pounced upon it, using the leaf as a shield as if to grasp it. Seeing its gain, it forgot its form; forgetting its form, it was seen by the magpie. The unusual magpie, drawn by the prospect of profit, saw the advantage and forgot its true nature. As Xuan comments: "Having lost its true nature, it neither flew away nor saw." Zhuang Zhou, startled, said: "Alas! Things are indeed mutually entangled. Guo comments: 'Those who seek profit from one another are always mutually burdened.' The two kinds summoned one another." As Xuan comments: "The cicada summoned the mantis; the mantis summoned the magpie—each brought harm upon itself." He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the warden of the grove pursued and berated him. Cheng comments: "The *yuren* is the keeper of the chestnut grove. Suspecting him of stealing chestnuts, he chased and questioned him." Zhuang Zhou returned and for three days did not emerge. The *Shiwen* notes: "'Three days' appears as 'three months' in one version. Sima comments: 'He did not go out, remaining seated in the courtyard for three months.'" Wang Niansun observes: "The following passage speaks of 'a short while,' so 'three days' is correct. If following Sima’s interpretation, 'courtyard' should include the word 'out' for clarity. The phrase 'very much not *ting*' below, if taken to mean 'very much did not go out to the courtyard,' is even more unnatural. *Ting* should be read as *cheng*. *Bu cheng* means 'not at ease'; *shen bu cheng* means 'very much not at ease.' The word *cheng* was anciently pronounced like *cheng*, its sound close to *ting*, hence it was interchangeable with *ting*."

Lin Ju followed and asked him, Sima comments: "A disciple of Zhuangzi." "Master, why have you been so disquieted of late?"

Zhuang Zhou replied: "I guarded form and forgot my own body, preserved the appearance of things and forgot myself. I observed the turbid waters and was deluded by the clear abyss. I knew that creatures pursue profit but did not realize that I should avoid suspicion. Moreover, I have heard from the Master—Laozi, as Cheng comments—that one should 'enter their customs and follow their ways.' Today, I wandered in Diaoling and forgot myself, becoming like the cicada. The unusual magpie struck my forehead; I wandered in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature, becoming like the magpie. The warden of the chestnut grove took me for a thief and humiliated me—this is why I have been disquieted."

Yang Zhu traveled to Song. Sima comments: "Yang Zhu." (Note: According to the *Yu Yan* chapter of the *Liezi*.) He lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s young servant replied: "The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, and her beauty makes her proud. I do not see her as beautiful. The plain one is plain in her own eyes, and her plainness makes her humble. I do not see her as plain."

Yang Zhu said: "Disciples, take note! Act with virtue but discard the conduct of self-regard. Wherever you go, will you not be loved?"

**Chapter 21: Tian Zifang (Outer Chapters)**

Tian Zifang sat in attendance upon Marquis Wen of Wei and repeatedly praised Xi Gong. Li comments: "Tian Zifang was Marquis Wen’s teacher, named Wuze. Xi Gong was a worthy man." (Sima’s text reads *Ji* instead of *Xi*.) The Marquis said: "Is Xi Gong your teacher?"

Zifang replied: "No. He is a villager of Wuze. His words on the Dao often accord with reason, so Wuze praises him."

The Marquis said: "Then you have no teacher?"

Zifang said: "I do."

The Marquis asked: "Who is your teacher?"

Zifang said: "Dongguo Shunzi."

The Marquis said: "Then why have you never praised him?"

Zifang said: "His character is true—outwardly human, inwardly empty of Heaven. Yu comments: "The *Huainanzi*’s *Shu Zhen Xun* says, 'An empty chamber gives rise to brightness.' The commentary reads: 'Empty refers to the heart.' Here, it means outwardly human, inwardly the heart of Heaven. Ancient texts read *xu* as belonging to the lower line, which is incorrect." He follows along while preserving the true, is clear yet accommodates things, clear yet not harsh. When others lack the Dao, he responds with upright bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. Guo comments: "Vast and clear, empty and upright—he merely rectifies himself, and the perversity of others naturally fades." How could Wuze be worthy of praising him!"

Zifang departed. The Marquis, lost in thought, remained silent for the rest of the day. Guo comments: "*Tangran* describes his self-forgetfulness." He summoned the ministers who had stood before him—those who had attended and heard the exchange—and said to them: "How distant is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I believed the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness to be the ultimate. After hearing of Zifang’s teacher, my form dissolved and I had no desire to move; my mouth was sealed and I had no desire to speak. What I have learned is but a clod of earth—Xuan comments: "It is merely the coarsest of things. Outside of Heaven’s truth, all is but a clod." Truly, Wei has been a burden to me!" Guo comments: "Those who know what is most noble consider human rank a burden."

When Wenbo Xuezi traveled to Qi, Guo comments: "His surname was Wen, given name Bo, style Xuezi—a man of Chu who embodied the Dao," he lodged in Lu. A man of Lu requested an audience with him. Wenbo Xuezi said: "I cannot. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but clumsy in understanding the human heart. Xuan comments: "Skilled in superficial learning but ignorant of the fundamental nature." I do not wish to meet him."

When he returned to Qi and again lodged in Lu, the same man requested an audience. Wenbo Xuezi said: "Before, he sought to see me; now, he seeks to see me again. He must have something to rouse me." He went out to meet the guest and, upon returning, sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and returned sighing. His servant said: "Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why?"

He replied: "I told you before: 'The people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but clumsy in understanding the human heart.' The one who saw me earlier advanced and retreated in fixed circles, in fixed squares; moved with ease like a dragon, like a tiger. Guo comments: "His bowing and yielding, advancing and retreating, were as measured as compass and square, as sinuous as a dragon, as powerful as a tiger." He admonished me as a son admonishes a father, guided me as a father guides a son. That is why I sighed." Guo comments: "He corrected me as a son serves a father, instructed me as a father teaches a son. Though there is affection between near and distant, high and low, it is not of Heaven’s nature—why the earnestness? Knowing the harm of sagely traces, I see such pretense, and so I sigh."

Confucius met him and said nothing. Zilu said: "Master, you have long wished to see Wenbo Xuezi. Now that you have met him, you say nothing. Why?"

Confucius said: "For such a man, the Dao is present the moment one’s gaze falls upon him. There is no room for words." Xuan comments: "The moment one’s eyes meet him, the Dao is already there. What need is there for words?"

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master runs, I run; when the Master races ahead, leaving all behind, I can only stare blankly after him."

The Master said: "Hui, what do you mean?"

Yan Yuan said: "When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master speaks, I speak; when the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master debates, I debate; when the Master runs, I run; when the Master speaks of the Dao, I too speak of the Dao."

Though when you race ahead, leaving all behind, I can only stare blankly after you—this is because, though you speak not, you are trusted; though you draw no close comparisons, your care is all-encompassing; though you bear no regalia, the people gather before you like a swelling tide, yet they know not why it is so.

Confucius said: "Alas! Should we not examine this? No sorrow is greater than the death of the heart, and the death of the body is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches—all things align themselves accordingly. Those with eyes and feet depend on it to accomplish their tasks, awaiting the day to begin their work. When it emerges, the world stirs; when it withdraws, the world rests. All things are thus: their death and life alike depend on this rhythm. Once I received my completed form, I did not resist change while awaiting its end, but moved in imitation of things, as things moved and I moved with them. Day and night flow without pause, and I know not where they conclude. My form took shape of its own accord, yet even knowing fate, I could not foresee what lay before me. Thus I pass my days. My whole life, I have grasped your arm only to lose it—can this not be lamented? You cling to what I once clung to. What I once clung to has already vanished, yet you seek it as if it still exists. This is like searching for a horse in an empty marketplace. What I hold in my thoughts of you fades swiftly, and what you hold in your thoughts of me fades just as swiftly. Yet why should you worry? Though the old me is forgotten, there is always something unforgotten remaining."

Confucius visited Lao Dan, who had just washed his hair and was letting it dry with his hair loose, motionless as though not human. The *Shiwen* notes: "慹, pronounced *niè* or *dì lì*; Sima Biao says: 'the appearance of stillness.'" Guo Xiang comments: "the utmost in tranquility and quiescence." Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he approached and said: "Was I deluded just now? Or was it truly so? A moment ago, Master, your form stood stiff as withered wood, as though you had left things and parted from men, standing alone in solitude."

Lao Dan said: "I let my mind wander in the beginning of things." Xuan Ying comments: "The beginning of things is the time before things existed. To let the mind wander in the time before things existed is to encounter the true Dao."

Confucius said: "What do you mean?"

Lao Dan replied: "The mind is confounded and cannot know; the mouth is shut and cannot speak. I have tried to discuss it for you in tentative terms. The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang is blazing and bright. Solemn stillness arises from heaven; blazing brightness issues from earth. The two intermingle and harmonize, and things are born. Some become their guiding principles, yet no one sees their form. Who binds them together as a net? They ebb and flow, filling emptiness; now dark, now bright; changing day by day, transforming month by month. Each day they act, yet no one sees their work. As Cheng Xuanying says: 'Yin wanes and yang waxes; summer is full and winter empty; night is dark and day is bright. Day by day they change, month by month they transform, ever renewing. Thus each day they act.' Life has its place of sprouting; death has its place of return. Beginning and end revolve without end, yet no one knows where they conclude. As Guo Xiang says: 'What is called meeting it, one does not see its head; following it, one does not see its rear.' Su Yu comments: 'The two lines about "beginning and end" are what is meant by "just as it is born it dies, just as it dies it is born."' But this is not so. Then what is their master?"

Cheng Xuanying comments: "If not for this all-pervading, life-generating Dao, who would be the master of the myriad things?"

Confucius said: "May I ask about wandering in this?"

Cheng Xuanying comments: "May I ask how to let the mind wander in this Dao? What power does one gain from wandering in it?"

Lao Dan said: "To attain this is the utmost beauty and the utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy is called the perfected person."

Confucius said: "I wish to hear the method."

Lao Dan replied: "Grass-eating beasts do not dislike changing marshes; water-dwelling creatures do not dislike changing waters. They undergo small changes but do not lose their great constancy. As Cheng Xuanying says: 'Dislike means to find troublesome. Change means to move. Beasts that eat grass do not find it troublesome to move from one marsh to another; creatures that live in water do not find it troublesome to move from one body of water to another. As long as there is grass or water, they do not lose their great constancy. Whether they go east or west is but a small change. It is like a person abiding in the great Dao, following change and responding to transformation, never ceasing to be oneself. This is not losing the great constancy. The changes of life and death are but small matters.' Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness do not enter the breast. Li Yi comments: 'Breast means within.' Guo Xiang comments: 'Knowing that small changes do not lose the great constancy.' The world is where the myriad things are one. As Xuan Ying says: 'The myriad transformations do not exceed the true master.' To attain this oneness and be the same as it, then the four limbs and the hundred parts of the body will be but dust and dirt, and life and death, beginning and end will be but day and night, and nothing can disturb them. How much less the boundaries of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune! As Xuan Ying says: 'Boundaries means junctures.' To discard what is subordinate is like discarding mud and mire, for one knows that the body is nobler than what is subordinate. Subordinate means what is attached, such as officials and retainers. What is noble lies in me and is not lost in change. One does not lose one’s nobility through change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have no end, and I too join in their endlessness. What is there to trouble the mind? As Xuan Ying says: 'Then one wanders in freedom.' Only those who have attained the Dao understand this."

Confucius departed and told Yan Hui: "In my relation to the Dao, am I not like a gnat in vinegar? Guo Xiang comments: 'A gnat in vinegar is a tiny midge in a jar.' Had the Master not lifted the covering from my eyes, I would not have known the great wholeness of heaven and earth. As Xuan Ying says: 'The great wholeness of heaven and earth is where the myriad things are one.'" Zhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu.

"Cheng comments: 'Zhuangzi was contemporary with King Hui of Wei and King Wei of Qi, one hundred twenty years after Duke Ai of Lu. That this says "visited Duke Ai of Lu" is but a parable.' Duke Ai said: 'Lu has many Ru scholars, yet few who follow the Master’s method.' Cheng comments: 'Method means art.' He meant that the land of Lu seldom practiced Zhuangzi’s art of non-action.

Zhuangzi said: 'Lu has few Ru.'

Duke Ai said: 'The whole state of Lu wears the Ru garb—how can you say there are few?'

Zhuangzi said: 'I have heard that the Ru wear round caps, knowing the seasons of heaven; square shoes, knowing the forms of earth. Li comments: 'Square means rectangular.' Those who tie jade jue to their sashes decide matters when they arise. Cheng comments: 'The tie is a five-colored silk cord, threading the jade jue to adorn the sash. Jue means to decide.' A noble person who possesses the Way may not wear its garb; one who wears its garb may not know the Way. If Your Grace truly does not believe this, why not issue a decree throughout the state: "Whoever wears this garb without possessing its Way shall be put to death"?'

Thereupon, Duke Ai proclaimed this for five days, and no one in Lu dared wear the Ru garb. Only one man, clad in Ru attire, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs; though the questions turned a thousand ways, his answers were inexhaustible.

Zhuangzi said: 'With the whole state of Lu, there is but one Ru—can this be called many?'

Baili Xi’s rank and salary did not enter his heart, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The Lord of Yu’s life and death did not enter his heart—whether repairing the granary or dredging the well, it was all the same. Thus he was able to move others."

At Chengyi and Chengdu, the masters bestowed the imperial abdication.

Duke Yuan of Song was about to commission paintings. All the court scribes arrived, receiving the steward’s words: "You have been summoned." They bowed and stood in place; licking their brushes and mixing ink, half remained outside. It was said: "These cannot paint."

One scribe arrived late, strolling leisurely without haste, his voice unhurried. He received the bow but did not stand, then went to his quarters. The Duke sent someone to observe him, who saw him strip off his robes and sit cross-legged, bare. The steward said: "He is about to paint, so he removes his clothes to reveal his form."

The Duke said: "This is the true painter." Guo [Xiang] said: "One whose inner power is sufficient is at ease in spirit and settled in mind."

King Wen observed at Zang, where he saw a man fishing—but his fishing was no fishing, for he cast no bait, his mind not on the fish. He did not hold his rod as if fishing, nor treat fishing as his task. He was one who fished, yet fished for something else. This was his constant way of fishing, not an occasional act.

King Wen wished to raise the man and entrust him with governance, yet feared his ministers, elders, and kinsmen would not be at ease. He hesitated, considering whether to abandon the idea, but could not bear the thought of the people being left without a protector. Thus, at dawn, he gathered his ministers and said:

"Last night, I dreamed of a nobleman, dark of complexion and with a full beard, riding a dappled horse with one red hoof. He commanded: *'Entrust governance to the Elder of Zang, and the people may yet find relief!*'"

The assembled ministers started and said, "It is the late lord, our former king!"—referring to King Ji Li.

Yu Yue notes: *"Below 'former king' a character for 'command' is missing, as evidenced by the later phrase 'the command of the former king.'"*

King Wen said, "Then let us divine by oracle."

The ministers replied, "The command of the former king leaves no room for doubt—what need is there for further hesitation? Why resort to divination?"

Thereupon, they welcomed the Elder of Zang and entrusted him with governance. The established rituals remained unchanged; no partial decrees were issued. For three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and found that the ranked officers had dismantled their factions and dispersed their cliques, no longer forming partisan alliances.

Yu Yue notes: *"In the *Zuozhuan* (Duke Xuan, Year 2), 'Hua Yuan became the *zhi*,' with Du Yu’s commentary: '*Zhi* means the leading master.' Officers must first have a leader before they gather followers, so to scatter their cliques, one must first dismantle their *zhi*."*

The high officials no longer cultivated virtue in isolation but converged in shared goodness. Measures and bushels dared not vary at the four borders.

The *Shiwen* glosses: *"斔 is read as *yu*. Li [Yi] says: 'Six *hu* and four *dou* make one *yu*.'"*
*Note: This implies that measures from other regions, fearing discrepancies in size or form, did not circulate within the borders.*

When the ranked officers dismantled their factions and dispersed their cliques, unity prevailed. When high officials no longer cultivated virtue in isolation, their efforts aligned. When measures and bushels dared not vary at the four borders, the feudal lords harbored no divided loyalties.

Thereupon, King Wen appointed the Elder of Zang as Grand Preceptor. Facing north, he inquired, "Can governance extend to all under Heaven?"

The Elder of Zang remained silent and unresponsive, then vaguely declined. By morning, he had issued orders, and by night, he had fled—vanishing without a trace for the rest of his life.

Yan Yuan asked Confucius, "Was King Wen perhaps still lacking in virtue?"—implying, *"Was his power insufficient to win trust?"*—"Then why resort to dreams?"

Confucius replied, "Silence! Say no more!"

King Wen had already perfected it—Guo Xiang notes, *"He entrusted all matters to his ministers without claiming authority himself; this was perfection."*—so why speak of fault-finding? He merely followed the fleeting moment—Cheng Xuanying explains, *"Xun (循) means to follow; si xu (斯须) means a brief instant."* Guo Xiang adds, *"The si xu is the moment when the people’s sentiments hover between awakening and unawareness. King Wen followed and seized it to harmonize with the multitude’s will."*

Lie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren—*Liezi: The Yellow Emperor* writes *"Wumou"* instead of *"Wuren."* He drew the bow to its fullest, Sima Biao notes, *"Guan refers to the arrowhead."* (Zhang Zhan’s commentary: *"The string fully drawn, the arrowhead at its limit."*) He placed a cup of water on his elbow—Guo Xiang explains, *"His left hand was as steady as a rock, his right as supple as a branch. When the right hand loosed the arrow, the left remained unaware, so the cup of water could rest there."* When he released the arrow, the next arrow immediately followed—Cheng Xuanying says, *"Ta (沓) means repeated."* (The *Yellow Emperor* chapter writes *"di"* (镝) instead of *"shi"* (适), though the meaning is the same.) The moment one arrow was loosed, the next was already nocked. Even as the arrows flew, the cup remained balanced on his elbow. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure—motionless, like a carved effigy.

Bohun Wuren said, *"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot."* Zhang’s commentary: *"Though he has mastered the principles of shooting, he cannot avoid being attached to the act. The shooting of one who does not shoot is to forget both skill and failure—though he does not shoot, he is one with shooting."* *"Let me try climbing a high mountain with you, treading on perilous rocks, standing at the edge of an abyss a hundred ren deep—could you shoot then?"* Could you shoot with the shooting of one who does not shoot?

Thereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod on the perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of the abyss. Turning his back, he retreated step by step, two-tenths of his feet hanging over the void—Cheng Xuanying explains, *"He stepped backward toward the abyss, with two-tenths of his feet suspended in empty space."* He beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

Bohun Wuren said, *"The perfected person gazes upward into the blue sky, plunges downward into the Yellow Springs—Guo Qingfan notes, *"Qian (潜) here pairs with kui (窥) and should be glossed as ce (测), 'to fathom.' The *Erya* states, 'Qian means ce.'"*—commands the eight directions, yet his spirit and qi remain unchanged."* Guo Xiang explains, *"Huichi (挥斥) means to act freely."* *"Now you tremble with fear, your eyes darting in alarm—*"Shiwen"* cites the *Erya*: *'Xun (恂) means trembling.' Li Yi writes it as xuan (眴), pronounced xun.'"* Zhang’s commentary cites He Chengtian’s *Zuan*: *"The people of Wu call blinking xun (眴) mu (目)."* That is, his heart was afraid, and his eyes grew dizzy. *"In this, you are in grave danger!"* Guo Xiang notes, *"With fear, one loses much."*

Jian Wu asked Sunshu Ao, *"You served as Prime Minister three times yet showed no elation, and resigned three times without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see the joyful ease in the space between your brows—how do you cultivate your heart?"*

Sunshu Ao replied, *"How do I surpass others? I accept that its coming cannot be refused and its going cannot be stopped. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and so I show no sorrow. How do I surpass others? Moreover, I do not know whether it lies in the office or in myself—"*Xuan’s commentary: *"He does not know whether the honor lies in the Prime Minister’s post or in himself."* *"If it lies in the office, it is not mine;"* Xuan’s commentary: *"If it lies in the office, it has nothing to do with me."* *"if it lies in me, it is not in the office."* Xuan’s commentary: *"If it lies in me, it has nothing to do with the office."* *"I am about to hesitate, about to look around in all directions—"*The *Nourishing the Lord of Life* chapter also says, *"He looks around in all directions, his heart brimming with satisfaction."*—*"how could I have time to consider whether others value or despise me?"*

Confucius heard of this and said, *"The true persons of old could not be swayed by the clever, seduced by the beautiful, robbed by thieves, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor—"*Cheng Xuanying explains, *"The wise could not debate them, the beautiful could not corrupt them, bandits could not plunder them, and even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could not claim their friendship!"*—*"Life and death are great matters, yet they caused no change in themselves—how much less titles and emoluments! Such persons could traverse the great mountains without obstruction—"*Cheng Xuanying says, *"Jie (介) means hindrance."*—*"plunge into deep springs without getting wet, dwell in lowliness and obscurity without distress—"*Xuan’s commentary: *"Poverty and humble status could not afflict them."*—*"their spirit filled Heaven and Earth. Having given all to others, they themselves possessed even more."* Their numinous power filled Heaven and Earth; though they bestowed it all to aid others, they themselves gained still more.

The King of Chu sat with the Lord of Fan. After a short while, the King’s attendants announced three times, *"Fan is no more."*—*"Shiwen"* cites Sima Biao: *"Fan was a state in Gong County of Ji Commandery."* The *Zuozhuan* records, *"Fan was a descendant of the Duke of Zhou."* In the seventh year of Duke Yin, there is mention of the Earl of Fan. Cheng Xuanying’s note—*"King Wen of Chu sat with the Marquis of Fan Xi"*—has no known source. Guo Xiang explains, *"This indicates three omens of collapse."* Yu Yue counters, *"The King of Chu’s attendants spoke of three people from Fan who had perished. Guo’s commentary is incorrect."*

The Lord of Fan said, *"Fan’s demise does not diminish my existence. If Fan’s demise does not diminish my existence, then Chu’s existence does not ensure its own survival. From this perspective, Fan has never truly perished, and Chu has never truly existed."*

From *Zhuangzi Jijie*, Scroll Six, Outer Chapters: "Knowledge Wanders North" (Chapter Twenty-Two):

Knowledge wandered north to the Dark Waters, ascended the Hidden Mound of Fen,—*Shiwen* notes: *"Fen* is pronounced *fēn*. Li [Yi] says: 'The mound rises hidden and uneven.'"—and there encountered Non-Action’s Discourse.

Cheng [Xuanying] comments: "This chapter employs fictive names to convey its meaning through allegory."

Knowledge addressed Non-Action’s Discourse: "I wish to ask you something: How should one think and reflect to grasp the Dao? How should one dwell and conduct oneself to rest in the Dao?—*dwelling and conduct* referring to one’s abode and practice. By what means and through what path may one attain the Dao?"—*means* signifying *to follow*, *path* signifying *to proceed by*.

Three questions went unanswered by Non-Action’s Discourse—not because he refused to answer, but because he did not know how.

Xuan [Ying] remarks: "The Dao is fundamentally beyond words."

Failing to receive an answer, Knowledge returned south of the White Waters, ascended the Fox’s Watchtower Mound, and there beheld Mad Qu. Knowledge posed the same questions to Mad Qu.

*—the same questions as before.*

Mad Qu replied: "Alas!"

Li, in his pronunciation notes, reads *xi* (熙) as "response." "I knew it," Knowledge said, "and was about to tell you—*you*—when, mid-speech, I forgot what I wished to say."

Failing to receive an answer, Knowledge returned to the Emperor’s palace, where he saw the Yellow Emperor and posed his questions. The Yellow Emperor replied: "Only through non-thinking and non-reflection does one grasp the Dao; only through non-dwelling and non-practice does one rest in the Dao; only through non-following and non-proceeding does one attain the Dao." Xuan remarks: "All speak of spontaneity as the accord with the Dao."

Knowledge asked the Yellow Emperor: "You and I know this, yet those two—Non-Action’s Discourse and Mad Qu—do not. Which of us is correct?" The Yellow Emperor said: "Non-Action’s Discourse is truly so; Mad Qu approximates it; you and I remain far from it. For the knowing do not speak, and the speaking do not know—thus the sage enacts the teaching of non-speech." Cheng comments: "Citing the *Laozi* as evidence."

The Dao cannot be attained, as Guo observes: "The Dao resides in spontaneity, not in attainable speech." Virtue cannot be reached, as Guo observes: "Not losing virtue is called virtue; to claim virtue is not to reach it." Benevolence may be enacted, righteousness may be diminished; to practice benevolence is permissible, to diminish benevolence for the sake of righteousness is also permissible. Ritual is mutual pretense—ritual is ornament and pretense.

Thus it is said: "Lose the Dao, then virtue follows; lose virtue, then benevolence follows; lose benevolence, then righteousness follows; lose righteousness, then ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of disorder." Thus it is said: "The practitioner of the Dao daily diminishes. As Guo observes: "Diminish ornament and pretense." Diminish and diminish again, until reaching non-action—through non-action, nothing is left undone." As Guo observes: "When ornament is stripped away and simplicity preserved, though one acts, it is as if one does not act." Cheng comments: "Citing the *Laozi* again to clarify its meaning."

Now that one has become a thing, as Xuan remarks: "Simplicity scattered into vessels," to return to the root is not easy! Yet how effortless it is for the great person! Life is the companion of death, death the beginning of life—who knows their order? As Xuan remarks: "Death and life cycle endlessly."

Human life is the gathering of qi: when gathered, it is life; when scattered, it is death. If death and life are companions, as Xuan remarks: "Death and life are one qi," what cause for distress have I? Thus the myriad things are one. As Xuan remarks: "The life and death of the myriad things are all one qi." What they deem beautiful is called the wondrous and divine; what they despise is called the foul and rotten. As Xuan remarks: "They esteem life as wondrous and divine, and revile death as foul and rotten." Yet the foul and rotten transform again into the wondrous and divine, and the wondrous and divine transform again into the foul and rotten.

Thus it is said: "The qi of all under heaven is one."

""

Guo remarks: "Are death and life, self and other, truly different?"
Thus the sage values oneness.

Xuan remarks: "The above all speaks of the Dao/Way."

Zhi said to the Yellow Emperor: "I asked Wuwei Wei, but Wuwei Wei did not respond to me—not that he would not respond, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Kuang Qu, and Kuang Qu wished to tell me but did not tell me—not that he would not tell me, but that in wishing to tell me, he forgot it. Now I ask you, and you know it—why then are you not close to it?"

The Yellow Emperor said: "He is truly so because he does not know; this one seems so because he has forgotten it."

Xuan remarks: "Close to non-knowing."

"You and I will never be close to it because you know it."

Xuan remarks: "The Dao/Way fundamentally does not admit of speech."

Kuang Qu heard this and took the Yellow Emperor’s words as knowing speech.

Xuan remarks: "Wuwei Wei ultimately had no words."

Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak.

Xuan remarks: "They benefit the myriad things without speaking of the benefit."

The four seasons have bright patterns yet do not deliberate.

Xuan remarks: "The qi of the seasons is distinctly divided, requiring no deliberation."

The myriad things have principles of completion yet do not explain.

Xuan remarks: "Each has its inherent nature, needing no verbal explanation."

The sage traces back the beauty of heaven and earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things.

*Yuan* means "origin." With the mind of covering and bearing, their origin is the same as heaven and earth. Moreover, the myriad things each have their principles of generation and completion, which they thereby comprehend.

Thus the perfected person does nothing, the great sage does not act—this is called observing heaven and earth.

Taking heaven and earth as their model.

Now that numinous brightness and utmost essence, together with those hundred transformations—above, they are heaven and earth; below, they are the myriad things.

*Ben* notes: "Originally 'now' was written as 'abandon,' changed following Liu’s edition."

Things already have death and life, square and round, yet none know their root. Things transform and vary of themselves, yet none know their root and origin.

Vastly and lightly, the myriad things have existed since antiquity.

*Bianran* means "flittingly." Since ancient times, they have eternally and firmly existed.

The six directions are vast, yet they do not depart from within; an autumn hair is minute, yet it awaits them to complete its form.

Xuan remarks: "Great has no outside; small has no gaps."

Under heaven, none do not sink and float, yet throughout life they are never constant.

Cheng remarks: "Floating and sinking, ascending and descending, ever renewing in succession."

Yin and yang and the four seasons move in their courses, each attaining its proper sequence.

Guo remarks: "Not awaiting anything to be done."

Dimly, as if lost yet present.

Cheng remarks: "Dimly, as if obscured—seemingly absent yet present."

Vital yet without form, numinous.

Vital and arising, without visible traces, transforming swiftly like the numinous.

The myriad things are nurtured yet do not know it.

The myriad things are nourished yet do not know it themselves.

This is called the root and origin; by it, one may observe heaven.

Comprehending this root and origin, one may observe the natural heaven.

Nie Que asked the Dao/Way of Pi Yi.

*Shiwen* notes: "*Pi* is pronounced *pi*; originally also written as *pi*."

Pi Yi said: "If you rectify your form, unify your gaze, the harmony of heaven will arrive.

Xuan remarks: "When body is still and spirit concentrated, the harmonious qi will naturally return."

Gather in your knowledge, unify your measures, and the spirit will come to dwell.

Yu remarks: "*Huainanzi*’s *Dao Ying* chapter and *Wenzi*’s *Dao Yuan* chapter both read 'rectify your measures.' Here, 'unify' should be 'rectify.' *Du* means 'form.'"

*Case*: When the mind is restrained and the form is rectified, the numinous brightness will naturally return.

Virtue/power will become your beauty, the Dao/Way will become your dwelling. Naturally, virtue/power and the Dao/Way will be in you.

Your gaze will be innocent like a newly born calf, seeking nothing of the old!"

Cheng remarks: "*Tongyan* is the appearance of unknowing, straightforward gaze."

*Case*: A newly born calf has a pure, undivided nature, hence the comparison.

Before he finished speaking, Nie Que fell asleep.

Pi Yi was greatly pleased, departed singing, and went on his way.

*Shiwen* notes: "His body turned toward what was said, fearing that hearing and seeing would awaken him. Having received the Dao/Way swiftly, Pi Yi rejoiced."

He said: "His form is like withered bones,

Cheng remarks: "His form is like the bones of withered wood."

*Case*: *Xu Wu Gui* chapter also reads "withered bones"; *Qi Wu Lun* reads "withered wood"; *Geng Sang Chu* reads "withered branches of wood." Since humans have a hundred bones like the many branches of a tree, "withered bones" is the same as "withered branches."

truly knowing its actuality, not holding to the old with self-possession.

Guo remarks: "Moving together with change."

Vaguely, obscurely,

*Shiwen* notes: "*Mei* is pronounced *mei*."

without mind, so that none can consult with him.

Xuan remarks: "Since he has no mind, I cannot speak to him."

What sort of person is he!"

Guo remarks: "One who transforms alone."

Shun asked Cheng: "Can the Dao/Way be obtained and possessed?"

Li remarks: "*Cheng* was Shun’s teacher. Another says: In ancient times, there were four assistants—front *yi*, rear *cheng*—likely official titles."

Cheng said: "Your body is not your own possession—how can you possess the Dao/Way?"

Shun said: "My body is not my own—who possesses it?"

Cheng said: "It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth.

Yu remarks: "*Zhongguo Celue* Gao’s commentary: '*Wei* means 'to entrust.'' *Zuozhuan* Duke Cheng 2nd year Du’s commentary: '*Wei* means 'to belong.'' The form entrusted by heaven and earth means the form that heaven and earth have entrusted and to which they belong. Below, the same."

Life is not your own—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth."

"Nature and life are not your own—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Your descendants are not your own—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth.

Xuan remarks: 'Forms succeed one another in transformation, hence called *shedding*.'

Thus, in walking, one does not know where one is going; in dwelling, one does not know what one is holding; in eating, one does not know the taste. Throughout a lifetime, in walking there is a destination, yet ultimately one does not know where one is going; in dwelling there is something held, yet ultimately one does not know what one is holding; in eating there is flavor, yet ultimately one does not know the taste. This is the vigorous yang qi of heaven and earth.

Xuan remarks: 'Speaking of qi in terms of its dynamic strength.'

How then can it be obtained and possessed?"

Confucius asked Lao Dan: "Today I have leisure and tranquility—may I inquire about the supreme Dao/Way?"

Lao Dan said: "Purify your fast, dredge your mind, *shuoye* your spirit, and shatter your knowledge!

*Shiwen* notes: '*Zhi* pronounced as *zhi* (wisdom).'

Cheng remarks: '*Shu*, like washing; *xue*, like cleansing.'
Cheng remarks: '*Zaoxue*, like refining and purifying.'"

Cheng remarks: "Shatter sagely wisdom."

Ah, the Dao/Way—how profoundly ineffable! Let me speak of its rough outlines. "Outlines" means its boundaries.

Bright clarity arises from obscurity; ordered existence arises from formlessness. All things with order and sequence emerge from the formless. Spirit arises from the Dao/Way, and physical form originates from essence.
Xuan remarks: "Form here means the fundamental substance."

Thus the myriad things generate one another through form. Therefore, those with nine orifices are born from the womb—humans and beasts. Those with eight orifices are born from eggs—birds and fish. Their coming leaves no trace; their going has no boundary. Without gate, without chamber,
Xuan remarks: "Without gate, one knows not whence it emerges; without chamber, one knows not where it returns."

they radiate boundlessly in all four directions.
Xuan remarks: "Vastly pervading and all-embracing."

Those who follow this—
Cheng remarks: "This refers to the Dao/Way."
Yu remarks: "*Shuowen* lacks the character *yao*. Under the *chi* radical, it has *jiao*: 'to follow.' Also, *xun*: 'to move in accord.' Thus *yao* here means 'to follow.' Guo’s gloss of *yao* as 'to encounter' is incorrect."

—have strong limbs, penetrating thoughts,
Cheng remarks: "*Xun* means 'penetrating.'"

keen ears and sharp eyes. Their minds do not toil, and their responses to things are without fixed pattern. Heaven cannot but be high, earth cannot but be vast, the sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—is this not the Dao/Way?
Guo remarks: "All these are simply what cannot but be so of themselves; it is not that the Dao/Way makes them so."

Moreover, extensive learning does not necessarily bring knowledge, nor does eloquent debate necessarily bring wisdom. The sage has already settled this.
"With" and "already" are interchangeable.
Cheng remarks: "Extensive reading of the classics does not necessarily yield true knowledge; grand eloquence and ornate words do not necessarily bring enlightened insight. Thus the *Laozi* says: 'The good do not debate; those who debate are not good. The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.' The sage has thus decisively abandoned such things."

As for that which, when augmented, does not increase, and when diminished, does not decrease—this is what the sage preserves.
Preserving what is fixed in its allotment.

Abysmally vast, it resembles the sea; toweringly high, it endlessly cycles from end to beginning.
*Shiwen* notes: "*Weiwei* is pronounced *yuwei* and read as *weiwei*."

It measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion—such is the gentleman’s Dao/Way. Is this external to it?
All things turn to it for sustenance without exhaustion—is this not the Dao/Way?
Su Yu remarks: "Measuring and sustaining the myriad things still leaves traces of governance and transformation, hence it is called external. All things turning to it for sustenance is like the *Yijing*’s 'sustaining generation and initiating existence'—this is the natural function of heaven and earth, hence it is called the Dao/Way."

Within the central kingdom, there is one who is neither yin nor yang,
Xuan remarks: "Blending indistinguishably between yin and yang."

dwelling between heaven and earth. Merely and provisionally human, endowed with the qi of these two realms, they are only temporarily so.
They will ultimately return to their origin.

Viewed from the root, the living are but a gathering of qi.
Li remarks: "*Yin* is pronounced *yin*; *yi* is pronounced *yi*. *Yinyi* describes the appearance of qi gathering."

That is to say, from the perspective of their original source, the living are merely a conglomeration of qi. Though they may differ in longevity, how great is the difference? All are within a hundred years. It is but a fleeting moment—why distinguish between Yao and Jie?

Fruits and melons have their principles,
*Shiwen* notes: "*Luo* is pronounced *liguo* in Xu’s reading."
Xuan remarks: "Tree fruits and herbaceous fruits do not confuse their kinds; each has its proper order."

and though human relationships are difficult, they follow their natural sequence.
Though human relationships are hard to align, their generation follows a natural order.

The sage encounters them without resistance,
Xuan remarks: "Accords with them."

passes beyond them without clinging.
Moves with them in transformation.

Harmonizing and responding—this is virtue. Coinciding and responding—this is the Dao/Way. From this arise the rise of emperors and the emergence of kings.
Guo remarks: "It is simply thus."

Man dwells between heaven and earth as a white colt passing through a crevice—
*Shiwen* notes: "Originally also written as *隙*. *隙* means an opening."
—suddenly, it is gone. The time is exceedingly brief.

Bursting forth in tumult, none fails to emerge;
Xuan remarks: "Arising into life."
Flowing smoothly and freely, none fails to enter.
*Shiwen* notes: "*漻* is pronounced *liu*."
Xuan remarks: "Returning to emptiness in death."

Having transformed and been born, then transformed and died, living beings mourn them, and humankind grieves.
Xuan remarks: "Those who face death are called *living beings*; distinguished from other beings, they are called *humankind*."

They loosen heaven’s quiver, cast off heaven’s sack—
*Shiwen* notes: "*弢*, as in *Zilin*, means ‘bow case.’ *堕* is pronounced *huigui*."
Cheng remarks: "*●* is a binding sack."
Note: This is a metaphor for the body’s constraints; in death, they are undone and discarded.

In a flurry, in a swirl—
Cheng remarks: "*纷纶* and *宛转* both describe the appearance of release."
—the hun and po depart. Gone!
The body follows after—this is the great return!

The formless form—
Xuan remarks: "The formless is that from which form arises."
Form’s formlessness—
Xuan remarks: "Form is what the formless produces."
This is what all people know in common, yet it is not what those who would reach the Dao/Way strive for.
Xuan remarks: "It is not what those who would attain the Dao/Way pursue."
This is what the multitude discusses together.

Those who have arrived do not discuss; those who discuss have not arrived.
Cheng remarks: "The perfected sage, having forgotten words and grasped principle, has nothing to discuss. If one discusses, one has not reached the Dao/Way."

Clear vision meets nothing—though one sees clearly, there is nothing to encounter.
Eloquence is not as good as silence. The Dao/Way cannot be heard; hearing is not as good as blocking the ears.
This is called the great attainment.
Cheng remarks: "One who understands this may be said to have deeply grasped the great principle."

Dongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: "Where does the Dao/Way reside?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is nowhere absent."
Dongguo Zi said: "You must specify."
Guo remarks: "He wished Zhuangzi to name a particular location."
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the ants."
Dongguo Zi said: "How can it be so lowly?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the weeds and millet."
Dongguo Zi said: "How can it be even lower?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in the tiles and bricks."
Dongguo Zi said: "How can it be still more base?"
Zhuangzi said: "It is in excrement and urine."
Dongguo Zi did not respond.

Zhuangzi said: "Your question, sir, was fundamentally unworthy of a true answer.
Cheng remarks: "*质* means *substance*. My answer to your question still falls short of reality."
The question of Zheng Huo to the market inspector treading on a pig—each step lower reveals more.
Li remarks: "*正* is a pavilion guard; *获* is his name. *监市* is the market chief. *狶* is a large pig. *履* means to tread. The market chief treads on the pig, stepping on its legs and haunches, for the pig’s fat is hardest to discern there. Thus, to inquire about the Dao/Way through ever baser things is to know the Dao/Way."
Cheng remarks: "*正* is an official title, today’s market magistrate."
Xuan remarks: "*况* means a vivid analogy."

You must not insist; there is nowhere the Dao/Way escapes from things.
Do not expect the Dao/Way to be in any one place—there is nowhere beyond things.
The supreme Dao/Way is thus; great words are also so.
Cheng remarks: "The supreme Dao/Way is principle; great words are teaching."

*Zhou*, *bian*, and *xian*—three names, one reality, their meaning is the same.
The three terms *zhou*, *bian*, and *xian* share a single purport.

Once, we wandered together in the Palace of No-What-Is—
Xuan remarks: "Roaming the mind in the realm of emptiness, one sees the Dao/Way’s unity and boundlessness."
—joining in discussion without end!

Once, we dwelled together in non-action!
Serene and still!
Vast and clear!
Guo Qingfan remarks: "*漠* also means *clear*. *Shigu* states: ‘*漠* and *察* mean *clear*.’ Fan’s note says: ‘*漠然* means clear in appearance.’"
Harmonious and at ease!
Harmonized and leisurely.

My aspiration is emptiness—
Empty and still, that is my aspiration.
I go nowhere and yet do not know where I arrive; I depart and return without knowing where I rest.
I have gone and come without knowing my end; swift in coming and going, there is no final limit.
I wander in boundless vastness—
Guo remarks: "*冯闳* means *vast emptiness*."
—great wisdom enters and does not know its limit.
The great sage enters and roams freely with transformations.

That which things things is without boundary with things—
That which things things is the Dao/Way. Where things are, the Dao/Way is, thus it has no limit with things.
Yet things have boundaries—what is called the boundary of things—
Cheng remarks: "Each thing has its own limit; this is merely called the boundary of things. How can one speak of the Dao/Way?"
—is the boundary of the unbounded, the boundary that is no boundary.
The Dao/Way is fundamentally unbounded, yet appears in the boundaries of things. It is the boundary that is no boundary.

We speak of fullness and emptiness, growth and decline—yet that which is fullness is not fullness, that which is decline is not decline.
Cheng remarks: "Wealth and honor are fullness; poverty and lowliness are emptiness; old age and sickness are decline."
That which is beginning and end is not beginning and end; that which is accumulation and dispersal is not accumulation and dispersal.
Cheng remarks: "End and beginning are beginning and end; coming to life is accumulation; dying is dispersal."

E He Gan studied with Lao Long Ji alongside Shen Nong.

Shen Nong leaned upon his armrest, closed the door, and dozed at midday. E He Gan pushed open the door at noon and entered, saying, "Old Long is dead!" Shen Nong, still leaning upon his armrest, grasped his staff and rose, then clapped it down with a laugh. He said, "Heaven knew my perversity, rudeness, and arrogance—thus it cast me aside and let him die. Alas! The Master has died without ever uttering his wild words to me!"

E He Gan’s commentary: "Wild words are the utmost words. They are not what the world understands, so the utmost words are called wild."

Yan Gang Diao heard of this. Li’s commentary: "Yan Gang was a man who embodied the Dao; Diao was his name." Xuan’s commentary: "Yan Gang came to offer condolences." He said, "Those who embody the Dao are what the noble ones of the world depend upon." Guo’s commentary: "To say one embodies the Dao is to call them the master of all people. Yet now, in matters of the Dao, even the tip of an autumn hair—one ten-thousandth of which is not yet attained—you still knew to conceal his wild words and let him die. How much more so for those who truly embody the Dao! They are formless to the eye, soundless to the ear. In the discourse of men, they are called the obscure. Thus, to discourse on the Dao is not the Dao itself."

Guo’s commentary: "Even the obscure is not the Dao—this clarifies that the Dao is nameless."

Then Tai Qing asked Wu Qiong, "Do you know the Dao?" Wu Qiong said, "I do not." He then asked Wu Wei. Wu Wei said, "I know the Dao." Tai Qing said, "In your knowing of the Dao, are there principles?" Wu Wei said, "There are." Tai Qing said, "What are these principles?" Wu Wei said, "I know the Dao can be noble or base, can gather or disperse. These are the principles by which I know the Dao."

Cheng’s commentary: "Noble as a ruler, base as a servant; gathering is life, dispersing is death—these principles are boundless."

Tai Qing took these words to ask Wu Shi, who said the same. Tai Qing said, "If this is so, then is Wu Qiong’s not-knowing or Wu Wei’s knowing correct, and which is incorrect?" Wu Shi said, "Not-knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external."

Thereupon Tai Qing sighed and said, "Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?" Wu Shi said, "The Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is not it. The Dao cannot be seen; to see it is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken; to speak it is not it. Do you know the form of the formless? The Dao is not to be named."

As above: "The form of the formless, the formless of form." Knowing the form of the formless is to know the Dao is not to be designated by name.

Wu Shi said, "Those who ask about the Dao and receive an answer do not know the Dao. Even those who ask about it have not heard the Dao. The one who answers is certainly wrong, and the one who asks is also not right. The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers."

Guo’s commentary: "This is the meaning of abandoning learning and teaching to return to naturalness." To ask where there is no question is to ask the unanswerable. To answer where there is no answer is to be without inwardness. To force an answer where none is possible is to follow externals—thus it is called "without inwardness." Facing the unanswerable with no inwardness, one like this outwardly does not observe the cosmos, inwardly does not know the Great Beginning. They do not understand the principles of things within the six directions, nor do they know the Dao’s root lies within themselves. Thus, they do not pass beyond Kunlun, nor do they wander in the Great Void.

How could one surpass Kunlun and wander in the Great Void?

Guang Yao asked Wu You, "Do you exist, or do you not exist?" Guang Yao could not complete his question. Yu’s commentary: "The *Huainanzi*’s *Dao Ying Xun* has five characters above this line: 'Wu You did not respond.' This should be included; without it, the meaning is incomplete." He then stared intently at Wu You’s appearance, as if scrutinizing it closely.

Gazing into emptiness, utterly void—all day long one may look yet not see, listen yet not hear, grasp yet not obtain.

Guang Yao said, "This is perfection! Who could ever attain such a state? I can attain being and non-being, yet I cannot attain non-being beyond non-being." Xuan comments: "To possess non-being as substance is to attain being and non-being, but one has not yet reached the superiority of absolute nothingness." "And if one becomes 'without having,' how could one reach this?"

Xuan comments: "Even if one becomes 'without,' one has not yet escaped from being—how could one reach the realm of non-being beyond non-being?"

The Master Hammerman of Da Ma—Cheng comments: "Da Ma was the Grand Marshal of Chu. *Chui* means to forge; *gou* refers to a belt hook."—was eighty years old yet never lost the breadth of a hair. Sima and Guo comment: "In judging the weight of a forged hook, he never erred by even a hair’s breadth."

Da Ma said, "Is it skill, or is it the Way?"

He replied, "I have my *shou*." Wang Niansun comments: "*Shou* is the same as *Dao*. In the *Da Sheng* chapter, Confucius says, 'Is it skill, or is it the Way?' and the reply is, 'I have the Way.'"

"""

This serves as its proof. The character *Dao* was anciently pronounced like *shou*, hence interchangeable with it. In the rhymed writings of the *Nine Classics*, *Chu Ci*, Laozi, Zhuangzi, and other masters, *Dao* is always read as *shou*. The *Shuowen* states: "Dao is written with the radical *chuò* and the phonetic *shǒu*." The modern edition omits the phonetic, as the two Xus failed to recognize the ancient pronunciation.

At twenty, your servant took delight in forging belt hooks, seeing nothing else in the world—nothing but hooks did I observe. Su Yu comments: "This is the same principle as not allowing the myriad things to displace the cicada’s wings." Thus, what is used relies upon what is not used to long sustain its use. Cheng comments: "That he retained his skill in forging hooks into old age was due to never applying his mind to observing other things." How much more so for one who uses nothing at all! To not use is already excellent, but to even be without this "not using"—this is what is called "non-being beyond non-being." What thing does not draw upon it? Thus, all things rely on its use.

Ran Qiu asked Confucius: "Can one know what preceded heaven and earth?"
Confucius said: "Yes. The past was like the present."
Guo comments: "Heaven and earth have always existed; there was never a time before them."

Ran Qiu departed, having posed his question poorly. The next day, he returned and said: "Yesterday, I asked whether one could know what preceded heaven and earth, and you replied, 'Yes. The past was like the present.' Yesterday, I understood clearly, but today I am confused. May I ask what you meant?"
Confucius said: "Yesterday’s clarity came because your spirit received it first. Guo comments: "To await destiny with an empty mind is to receive with the spirit." Today’s confusion arises because you now seek it with what is not spirit. What is not spirit is traces and images. Attached to traces and images, you seek further enlightenment. There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end—all are transformations of a single *qi*. Could there be descendants before there were descendants?" Xuan comments: "Descendants can emerge from nothing, but can heaven and earth emerge from nothing?"

Ran Qiu did not respond.
Confucius said: "Enough! No need to answer. Do not let life give rise to death, nor death give rise to life. The dead die of themselves; their life does not give rise to this death. The living live of themselves; their death does not give rise to this life. Do life and death depend on one another? Each has its own integrity. Is there something that existed before heaven and earth? It is the same as this. That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. What gives rise to things is the *Dao*—it cannot be called a thing. Things do not emerge before other things; the myriad things emerge together, none preceding another. Yet they all have their being. They all have their being, and this has no end. For what gives rise to things is ever present. The sage’s love for others has no end, for it is drawn from this."

Yan Yuan asked Confucius: "I once heard you say, 'Do not send off, do not welcome.'" Cheng comments: "The sage is like a mirror, neither sending off nor welcoming." "May I ask where the mind wanders?"
Confucius said: "The ancients transformed outwardly while remaining inwardly unchanged. Xuan comments: "They moved with things, but the heavenly ruler remained unmoved." People today transform inwardly while remaining outwardly unchanged—their spirit drifts and stagnates upon things. One who transforms with things is one who does not transform. Guo comments: "Always without mind, thus one and unchanging; only one who is unchanging can transform with things." To be at ease with transformation or non-transformation, Cheng comments: "At ease means to follow. The sage, without mind, flows with things, whether transforming or not, all is followed with ease." to be at ease and in harmony with them, Cheng comments: "In harmony means to follow." Note: To follow and be in harmony with them. must be in accord with them without excess. Cheng comments: "Though in harmony with things, each remains within its bounds, neither harming the other." The preserves of Xiwei Shi, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of Youyu, the halls of Tang and Wu—with each descending age, the dwellings grew narrower, yet the sage adapts to the times and finds contentment. The noble person, like the masters of the Confucians and Mohists, takes them as teachers, yet even with them uses right and wrong to harmonize—how much more so with people today! Guo comments: "The masters of the Confucians and Mohists are the most difficult in the world to harmonize with, yet one without mind still harmonizes with them—how much more so with ordinary people!" Note: The noble person can transform with people today. The sage dwells among things without harming them. Xuan comments: "Without mind for right or wrong." One who does not harm things cannot be harmed by them. Only one who harms nothing can send off and welcome others. Without sending off or welcoming is acceptable; sending off and welcoming are also acceptable. Oh, the mountains and forests! Oh, the hills and wilds!"

Oh, how joyous and delightful it is! The plains and wilds—oh, the open fields! Yet joy is not yet complete when sorrow follows after. Cheng comments: "Emotions shift with circumstances; sorrow and joy thus change. From this we know that the world’s sorrows and joys are not worth reckoning." When sorrow and joy arrive, I cannot resist them; when they depart, I cannot halt them. How lamentable! The people of the world are but travelers lodging in things. Guo comments: "They cannot sit in forgetfulness and find contentment within, but instead become hostages to sorrow and joy." Note: They are but guesthouses for external things. Those who know what they encounter yet do not know what they do not encounter—encounters have their limits, and knowledge has its bounds. Knowing what one can do yet not knowing what one cannot do—knowledge takes ability as its capacity, yet does not recognize that inability is also a kind of capacity. To be without knowledge and without ability is something no person can avoid. Xuan comments: "Knowledge and ability are boundless, so there will always be things one does not know and cannot do—this is the common lot of humanity." Those who strive to avoid what no person can avoid—Xuan comments: "They exhaust their minds with conjecture, hoping to attain omniscience and omnipotence." How lamentable indeed! Cheng comments: "What utter folly." The ultimate word transcends words; the ultimate action transcends action. Cheng comments: "The word of the ultimate principle is beyond words that can be spoken; the action of the ultimate principle is beyond actions that can be performed." To equalize what knowledge knows is but shallow. Xuan comments: "If one insists on using what knowledge knows to equalize all things, demanding omniscience, how can this be the way of one who has seen the Dao?"

Among the disciples of Lao Dan—*Sima comments: "役 refers to students or followers"*—was one named Gengsang Chu—*Yu comments: "In the *Confucius* chapter of the *Liezi*, there is one named Kangcangzi among Lao Dan’s disciples, and Zhang Zhan’s commentary notes: 'Pronounced Gengsang.' Jia Kui’s *Genealogical Survey of Surnames* states: 'In Wu Commandery, there is a Gengsang clan, counted among the seven great families.' Thus, was Gengsangzi a man of Wu?"*—who had partially grasped Lao Dan’s Dao and dwelt in the north upon Mount Weilü—*Li comments: "Weilü is the name of a mountain. Some say it is in Lu; others, in Liangzhou."*

Those among his retainers who were cunningly clever departed from him; those among his concubines who were ostentatiously benevolent kept their distance. The people of the land revered and cherished Gengsang, wishing to serve as his retainers and concubines. Yet among them were those who flaunted their keen discernment as wisdom, and those who paraded their self-proclaimed virtue as benevolence—Gengsang kept them all at a distance. Those who remained with him were the ungainly—*Sima comments: "拥肿 refers to an ugly appearance"*—and those who served as errand-runners, the *yangzhang*—*Yangzhang: those who toil and rush about in labor.*

After three years, Weilü flourished abundantly—*Li’s commentary: "壤 is also written as 穰. The Guangya states: 'It means abundance.'" Lu notes: "The *Liezi*’s 'Heaven’s Blessings' chapter also uses 壤 for 穰."* The people of Weilü said to one another: "When Gengsangzi first arrived, we were startled by him—*Cui and Li comment: "洒然 describes a state of astonishment."* Now, when we reckon our days, we find them insufficient—*Xiang explains: "There is no small profit from dawn to dusk."* Yet when we reckon our years, we find them overflowing—*Xiang explains: "We prosper in harmony with the seasons."* He must be a sage! Why do we not together enthrone him as our lord and offer him sacrifices as to the gods of soil and grain?"—*尸 means "lord." They wished to honor him as their ruler.*

When Gengsangzi heard this, he turned southward with unease. *This passage also appears in the 'Equalizing Things' chapter.* His disciples were perplexed. Gengsangzi said: "Disciples, why are you perplexed by me? When spring’s qi stirs, the hundred grasses sprout; when autumn arrives in its due season, the ten thousand treasures ripen—*Yu comments: "The character 得 is likely an interpolation from the following line. The *Yi Jing*’s 'Shuo Gua' states: 'Dui corresponds to the true autumn, the season in which the myriad things find joy in completion.' The commentary explains: 'In true autumn, the myriad things all joyfully come to fruition.' This passage suffices in meaning without the 得 character."* Do spring and autumn act thus without reason? The Dao of Heaven has already unfolded—*The *Shiwen* reads "Heaven" as "Great." Note: Time and the Dao move in their course, achieving without awareness.*

I have heard that the perfected person dwells in stillness within a walled chamber, *Xuan comments: "Living in seclusion without ostentation."* while the common people roam wildly, unaware of where to turn—*Xuan comments: "As if forgotten by Heaven and Earth."* Now, with the petty folk of Weilü secretly scheming to honor me among the ranks of the worthy, am I to become their measuring mark?—*Guo comments: "He did not wish to serve as a standard for others."* This is why I remain unsettled by Lao Dan’s words."—*Cheng comments: "Laozi said: 'When the work is done, do not dwell in it; lead without dominating.' Gengsang reverently followed his master’s teaching, while the people of Weilü did the opposite—hence his unease."*

His disciples said: "It is not so."

The shallow ditches of a fathom’s length offer no room for great fish to turn their bodies, yet eels and minnows thrive there—*Cheng comments: "Eight chi make a xun; twice that, a chang. Ni refers to small fish."* *Shiwen* adds: "Zhi means to bend. The small fish can twist and turn."* Note: "Zhi" and "zhe" were interchangeable in ancient script. The low hills of a few paces’ height and a ren’s rise provide no concealment for massive beasts, yet foxes find them auspicious—*Shiwen* notes: "Six chi make a bu; seven chi, a ren. A hill one bu wide and one ren high."* *Cui comments: "Xiang means good. Foxes deem such small mounds favorable."*

Moreover, to honor the worthy and empower the capable, to bestow goodness and profit first upon the virtuous—such has been the way since the days of Yao and Shun. *Note: "Yi" and "yi" are interchangeable.* How much more should the people of Weilü follow this? Master, you should heed this as well!"

Gengsangzi replied: "Come here, young ones! The beast that fills a carriage, once it leaves the mountains alone—*Li comments: "Han refers to a capacious carriage."* *Yu comments: "The *Fangyan* states: 'A beast without a mate is called jie.'"*—cannot escape the snares and nets. The fish that swallows a boat, once stranded on dry land—*Shiwen* notes: "Dang, read as *tulang*. It means to be cast ashore and lose the water."*—is tormented even by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not tire of lofty heights, nor do fish and turtles tire of profound depths—*Guo comments: "Only by distancing oneself from profit and harm can one remain whole."*

For one who preserves their form and life, to conceal oneself is simply to shun neither depth nor obscurity. To be as things are. As for those two—referring to Yao and Shun above—what merit is there in praising them? In their distinctions—*Xuan comments: "Such as honoring the worthy, empowering the capable, bestowing goodness and profit first."*—they were like those who recklessly bore holes in walls to plant mugwort and wormwood—*Guo comments: "They would lead later generations to recklessly bore through and sow disorder."* Picking through hair to comb it, measuring grains of rice to cook—such trivialities! How could such things save the age?

Exalting the worthy sets the people against one another—*Zha means to vie.* Relying on cunning invites theft among them—*Xuan comments: "Dao means deceit."* These few measures cannot enrich the people. The people are relentless in their pursuit of profit: sons kill fathers, ministers murder rulers—*Shiwen* notes: "Sha is read as shi; the text also has shi (regicide)."* In broad daylight, they rob; at noon, they bore through walls—*Shiwen* notes: "Xiang is read as pei. *Bi* means wall. They act without fear or shame."*

""

I tell you: the root of great disorder must arise between the eras of Yao and Shun, while its branches will endure into a thousand generations hence. A thousand generations from now, there will surely be men who devour one another."

This passage also appears in the *Xu Wugui* chapter. Nanrong Chu straightened himself and sat upright, saying—*Shiwen* notes: "Chu is read as *chú* (昌于反); Xiang reads it as *chóu*. Li explains: 'A disciple of Gengsang.' The *Renzhong* text writes it as *Chóu*; the *Huainanzi* as *Chóu*." Lu comments: "The *Huainanzi* now writes it as *Chóu*."—"For one of my years, I have already grown old. How then shall I entrust my studies to attain these words?"

*Wu* is read as *wū*. Cheng comments: "What learning shall I rely upon to reach such words?"

Gengsangzi said: "Preserve your form whole, embrace your life,—Yu comments: "*Shiming* states: 'Embrace (*bào*) means preserve (*bǎo*); to be close and preserve.' Thus *bào* and *bǎo* share the same meaning. 'Embrace your life' is to preserve your life."—and let not your thoughts and cares flutter restlessly. If you do this for three years, you may then attain these words."

Nanrong Chu said:

"The eye and the form—I know not their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves; the ear and the form—I know not their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves; the heart and the form—I know not their difference, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The forms are the same, but their functions differ.

The form and the form are also illustrative—Guo Songtao notes: '*Liji* *Daxue* commentary: "Illustrative (*bì*) means 'to make understood.'" That is, the form and the form are easily understood.'—Yet I say: my form and the form of others are also easily understood. Yet why do things sometimes come between them?—Xuan comments: 'Things (*wù*) refer to desires.'—Why do they seek one another yet fail to attain one another?

There are always those who cannot understand one another, so I suspect some barrier divides them. Now I say to Chu: 'Preserve your form whole, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts and cares flutter restlessly.' Chu has merely heard the Dao with his ears."—*Shiwen* notes: "Cui and Xiang say: 'He has only reached the ears, not yet penetrated the heart.'"—

Gengsangzi said: "My words are exhausted. Thus says the ancient saying."

"The running bee cannot transform the *huozhu* caterpillar—*Sima* [Biao] comments: 'The running bee is a small wasp; another says it is the earth wasp. The *huozhu* is the large green worm found in bean leaves.'—*Cheng* [Xuanying] comments: 'The slender-waisted earth wasp can transform the mulberry worm into its own offspring, yet it cannot transform the *huozhu*.' The Yue chicken cannot brood the swan’s egg, but the Lu chicken certainly can."—*Shiwen* notes: "Xiang [Xiu] says: 'The Yue chicken is a small chicken; some say it is the Jing chicken. The Lu chicken is a large chicken, like the present-day Shu chicken.' *Hu* is also written as *he* (crane), both being the same."

"Between chicken and chicken, their virtue is not different, yet some can and some cannot—this is simply because their capacities are inherently great or small. Now my capacity is small and insufficient to transform you. Why do you not go south to see Laozi?"

Nanrong Chu packed provisions and traveled seven days and seven nights until he reached Laozi’s place.—*Shiwen* notes: "*Fangyan* says: '*Ying* means to carry. In Qi, Chu, Chen, and Song, it is called *ying*.'"

Laozi said: "Have you come from the region of Chu?"

Nanrong Chu replied: "Yes."

Laozi said: "Why have you come with such a crowd of people?"

Nanrong Chu, startled, looked back over his shoulder.—*Juran* means the same as *quran* (startled).

Laozi said: "Do you not understand what I meant?"

Nanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed, saying: "Just now I forgot my answer and thus lost my question."

Laozi said: "What do you mean?"

Nanrong Chu said: "Is it not so? People call me Zhu the Foolish."—Guo Songtao comments: "Du Yu’s *Zuo Zhuan* annotation for the fourth year of Duke Xiang says: 'Short and small is called *zhuru*.' *Zhu yu* likely refers to one whose wisdom and skill are short and small."—Su Yu comments: "This case: *Zhu yu* is like *zhuan yu*. *Zhu* and *zhuan* are double-voiced characters."—"Is it so? On the contrary, my body troubles me with sorrow."

"Without *ren* (benevolence), one harms others; with *ren*, one instead brings sorrow upon oneself. Without *yi* (righteousness), one injures others; with *yi*, one instead brings sorrow upon one’s own person. Where can I flee to escape this? These three sayings are what trouble me, and I wish to ask you about them through Chu."

Laozi said: "Just now, I saw it in the space between your brows and lashes—I thereby understood you, and already grasped your heart. Now you speak again and confirm it. You know my words are proven. Yet you stand there rigidly, as if you had lost your father and mother—like raising a pole to seek the sea. As I said before: 'Using something short and small to measure a deep and vast domain.' You are like a lost man! Bewildered, you wish to return to your nature and disposition yet have no way in—how pitiable!"

Nanrong Chu asked to enter and rest in his lodging. He summoned what he loved and cast aside what he despised. He called forth clarity and emptiness, and removed material desires. For ten days he grieved over himself, for he had not yet attained it. Then he saw Laozi again.

Laozi said: "You have cleansed yourself, washed away the filth. How dense and oppressive! Yet within, there still lingers something noxious. One bound externally cannot be grasped by force—one must close inwardly. One bound internally cannot be grasped through confusion—one must close outwardly. Those bound externally and internally, whose *Dao* and *virtue* cannot hold firm, are like those fettered by external and internal desires. Even if they possess *Dao* and *virtue*, they cannot uphold them—how much less those who abandon the *Dao* and act!"

Nanrong Chu said: "When a villager is ill, and another villager asks about it, the sick one can describe his illness, yet the one who is truly ill remains unwell. The one who asks about the illness is the one who is ill. When I hear of the great *Dao*, it is like taking medicine that only worsens the disease. I wish only to hear the *Canon of Preserving Life*."

Laozi said: "The *Canon of Preserving Life*—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you come to rest? Can you cease? Can you abandon others and seek it within yourself? Can you be free and unconstrained? Can you be simple and unknowing? Can you be like a little child? A child cries all day, yet its throat does not grow hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony. It clenches its fists all day, yet its hands do not cramp—such is the constancy of its *virtue*. It gazes all day without blinking—its focus is not on externals. It walks without knowing where it goes, sits without knowing what it does, moves with things in perfect accord, riding the same waves. All these describe the little child. This is the *Canon of Preserving Life*."

Southridge Chu asked, "Then is this the *virtue* of the perfected person?"

He replied, "No. Is this merely what is called the ability to melt ice and thaw frost? This is but the capacity to dissolve the congealed obstructions within the breast. As for the perfected person, they share sustenance with the earth and commune in joy with Heaven. They do not entangle themselves with the gains and harms of others, nor do they engage in strangeness or set themselves apart. They do not conspire with others, nor do they casually conform. They do not involve themselves in affairs, nor do they lightly form attachments. They come and go with effortless grace, arriving and departing with uncontrived simplicity."

"This is called the *canon of preserving life*."

He asked, "Then is this the ultimate?"

"Has it reached the utmost?"

He replied, "No. I have already told you: *'Can you be like an infant?'*
The infant moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like the branch of a withered tree, and its heart is like dead ashes. Such is the state described in *The Equality of Things and Lives*, and also in *Xu Wugui* and *Knowledge Wanders North*, where 'body' is written as 'frame.' In this state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how could there be human-caused calamity?"

Guo Xiang comments: "Misfortune and fortune arise from loss and gain; human calamity stems from love and aversion."

Xuan notes: "The reply is 'No,' yet no further words are given. For the ultimate Dao lies not beyond what was said earlier—only when the heart takes this as the ultimate does it cease to be the Dao. Thus Laozi strips it away."

When the vastness of the cosmos settles into stillness, it radiates the light of Heaven. Guo comments: "When the virtue of the cosmos is vast and settled, what it emits is the light of Heaven, not the brilliance of man." One who radiates the light of Heaven appears as a human being. Xuan notes: "Seen from a human perspective, such a one is merely human."

Those who cultivate themselves now possess constancy. Xuan notes: "Cultivation here means the settled vastness; constancy refers to pure and enduring stability." Those who possess constancy are sheltered by others and aided by Heaven. People come to rely on them, and Heaven also grants its protection. Those sheltered by others are called the people of Heaven—exalted without rank. Those aided by Heaven are called the sons of Heaven. Learners study what they cannot study; practitioners practice what they cannot practice; debaters debate what they cannot debate. Xuan notes: "In all three, they do not know where to stop." To know where to stop in what one cannot know—this is perfection. Cheng comments: "What one cannot know should not be forced; this is the ultimate subtlety of learning."

If there are those who do not abide by this, the balance of Heaven will ruin them. Cheng comments: "Those who do not take what lies within their nature as right will corrupt their inherent nature." Equip the self with all things to sustain form, and possess all principles to accord with form. Conceal the unforeseen to give rise to the heart. Xuan notes: "Retreat to the realm of no thought, to enliven the heart." Maintain reverence within to reach without—be respectful of inner wisdom to extend it outward.

If, despite this, myriad evils still arrive—Xuan notes: "Referring to calamities"—such as King Wen’s imprisonment in Youli or Confucius’s distress in Kuang, these are all from Heaven, not from man. Xuan notes: "Not brought about by oneself." They are not enough to disturb completion, nor to disrupt one’s great accomplishment. They cannot enter the sacred terrace. They cannot disturb the heart by causing one to be moved. Guo comments: "The sacred terrace is the heart." The sacred terrace has something it holds, yet one does not know what it holds, and it is that which cannot be held. The heart must not be moved by things; its value lies in being able to hold itself. Yet it should hold itself naturally, not with deliberate grasping.

One does not see its sincerity toward oneself and so acts; every action is thus misplaced. One has not seen its sincerity toward the self and so acts recklessly; though it acts, it will not be fitting. When karmic matters enter and do not depart, each change only compounds the error. Cheng comments: "Karmic matters refer to affairs." External affairs enter and disturb the heart without leaving; though they change, they still result in loss. Yao notes: "The 'self' above refers to this. If one does not see its sincerity, then all is delusion. Acting thus, nothing will be right. If matters enter but one cannot abide long, changing only leads to further loss—this is knowing but failing to preserve." This interpretation is also coherent.

To do evil in the open and bright is to be punished by others; to do evil in the hidden and secluded is to be punished by ghosts. Only one who is enlightened to both the human and the ghostly can act alone. Guo comments: "With nothing to be ashamed of in the hidden or the visible, one can act alone without fear." Those who hold the inner contract act without reputation. Xuan notes: "The contract is an agreement, a harmony within." Cheng comments: "Without reputation is the Dao. Those who tread the Dao act without leaving a trace." Those who hold the outer contract aspire to extravagant expectations.

The *Xunzi* frequently employs the character *qi* (綦). Yang's commentary on the "Wang Ba" chapter states: "*Qi* means 'extreme.'" It may also appear as *qi* (期). *Qi fei* (期費) thus means "extreme expenditure," where *fei* refers to material resources.

To note: "Those who hold the outer contract aspire to *qi fei*" means that those who align with external expectations desire to exhaust their resources. "Those who act without reputation" are but the commonplace made radiant—ordinary yet luminous. "Those who aspire to *qi fei*" are but merchants; how do they differ from merchants? People see their striving and liken them to towering market figures. Those who exhaust themselves with things find things entering them. Guo notes: "*Qiong* (穷) refers to beginning and end." Xuan comments: "If I remain with things from beginning to end, things will likewise come to me." Those who deal with things in a haphazard manner cannot even contain themselves; how can they contain others? Yu comments: "*Qie* (且) means 'careless.' The *Book of Songs*' *Dongmen zhi fen* reads *gu dan yu chai* (谷旦于差), where the *Han Shi* renders *dan* (旦) as *qie* (且), stating: 'It means careless.' Thus, reduplicated, it signifies carelessness, while alone, it means *qie*. The earlier 'beginning and end' conveys the sense of exhaustiveness, which is the very opposite of carelessness."

Those who cannot contain others have no intimacy; those without intimacy are wholly others. Guo states: "They are entirely other people." No weapon is more *can* (惨) than the will; the *Mo Ye* sword is inferior. The *Shuowen* says: "*Can* means 'poisonous.'" The character may also appear as *●* (a variant of 惨). Nothing is more poisonous than the heart, with weapons ranking below it. No enemy is greater than yin and yang; there is no escape from them between heaven and earth. Cheng comments: "*Kou* (寇) means 'enemy.'" It is not yin and yang that harm them, but the heart that commands it. Guo states: "When the heart commands qi, yin and yang congeal as *zheng* (症) in the five viscera."

The Dao flows unimpeded through all divisions. Xuān comments: "All divisions necessarily have boundaries. The Dao has no boundaries, thus it flows through all that it divides." Its completion is its destruction. Where this is accomplished, that is undone—hence the Dao makes no distinction between completion and destruction. What is detestable about division is that division strives for perfection. All divisions seek perfection, thus division is detestable. What is detestable about perfection is that it possesses the means for perfection. Those who possess the means for perfection still seek it endlessly, thus perfection is detestable. Thus, to go forth and not return is to reveal one’s ghostly nature. When the emotions and perceptions drift outward without returning, one sees only their ghostly aspect. To go forth and obtain is called "obtaining death." To drift outward and thus gain something, they deem it an attainment, yet it is but the attainment of death. To be extinguished yet possess substance is one form of ghostliness. Though their nature is extinguished, though they possess the substance of form and bones, and deem themselves living, I regard them as but one kind of ghost. It is by possessing form that one models the formless and thus attains stability. When humans possess form, they should regard it as formless—then the heavenly ruler is perfectly at peace.

To go forth without root—this is the flowing of the Dao without origin. To enter without aperture—this is the gathering of the Dao without crevice. It possesses substance yet has no place. The Dao has substance yet no discernible location. It has length yet no root or tip. *Shiwen* notes: "*Piāo* (剽) is also written as *biāo* (摽). Cuī comments: 'It means the tip.'" (Note: The distant branches of a tree are called *biāo*, hence it signifies the tip.) The source and flow of the Dao are vast, yet no root or tip is seen. That which emerges without aperture possesses substance. That which possesses substance yet has no place is space. That which emerges without crevice, though not without substance, ultimately has no location—it abides in the space of the four directions and above and below. That which has length yet no root or tip is time. Though it has length, its beginning and end are the time of past and present. There is life, there is death, there is going forth, there is entering. Beings have life and death; yin and yang have going forth and entering. Going forth and entering without revealing their form—this is called the Heavenly Gate. Guo comments: "The Heavenly Gate is the collective name for the myriad things. To call it the Heavenly Gate is like calling it the Gate of All Wonders." The Heavenly Gate is Nonbeing. The myriad things emerge from Nonbeing. Guo comments: "It takes Nonbeing as its gate." Being cannot take Being as its source. Before Being arises, it is not something Being can possess. It must emerge from Nonbeing. Nonbeing can generate Being. Yet there is not even Nonbeing. Xuān comments: "Even the term 'Nonbeing' is negated—this is where all wonders reside, thus the sage abides here."

The knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost. To what did it reach? Some held that there had never yet been anything—this is the utmost, the exhaustion of all, beyond which nothing can be added. Others held that there were things. (This is also seen in the "Equalizing Discussion of Things" chapter.) They took life as loss and death as return. Cheng comments: "The common person takes life as gain and death as loss. Now, desiring to return to the essence of enlightenment, they take life as loss—for it is nothingness—and death as return, a return to emptiness. Though they have not fully attained the wonders of all things, they can still equalize life and death." Thus, they are already divided. They are the same as themselves. Guo comments: "Though they seek to equalize, they are already divided." Cheng comments: "They still see the difference between life and death." Others said that first there was Nonbeing, then there was life, and life swiftly turned to death. They took Nonbeing as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail. Who knows the one who guards the unity of Being, Nonbeing, life, and death? I would befriend such a one. Those of yet another level also know that Being, Nonbeing, life, and death are one and guard this without doubt. Whoever understands this principle, I would also befriend.

These three, though different—Guo comments: "Some take Being as Nonbeing, some take Being as one, some divide yet equalize—thus they are called three."—though they exhaust or do not exhaust, all can keep their breasts free of right and wrong. They are of the ducal clan. The ducal clan of Chu had not yet received a surname, such as the king’s sons and grandsons. The Zhao and Jing clans took their ancestors as their names. Xuān comments: "These two clans took the ancestors they honored as their surnames." The Jia clan took their fief as their name. "Jia" is a corruption of "Zhong." Xuān emends it, and I follow. This clan took the fief they were enfeoffed with as their surname. They are not one. They are also like the three above, sharing a single origin.

At birth, all is soot—*Xuān* glosses: "Xú reads *jiǎn* (徐于减反). The *Zìlín* states: 'The blackness at the bottom of a cauldron.'" *Xuān* comments: "All living things emerge from obscurity, like the uniform blackness coating the bottom of a cauldron, without distinction of self or other." Yet if one suddenly declares to another, "You must shift your allegiance to this," such a claim generates right and wrong from oneself. Though I have spoken of shifting allegiance, let me try to articulate it—yet it is not something that can truly be spoken. *Xuān* comments: "It is fundamentally inexpressible." Nevertheless, it remains unknowable. Yet the world does not understand this.

At the year-end sacrifice, the tripe and hooves are present—these may be dispersed, yet they may not be dispersed. *Chéng* comments: "The *là* is the great sacrifice. *Pí* refers to the cow’s omasum; *gāi* means 'complete,' though some say it refers to the cow’s hooves. During the *là* sacrifice, the sacrificial animals are fully prepared, with all four limbs and five viscera laid out. Once the rites conclude, they may be dispersed—hence dispersion is permissible. Yet if the sacrifice remains unfinished, they must not be dispersed—thus dispersion is impermissible."

Observe a chamber, and one surveys its halls and ancestral temples, then proceeds to its secluded recesses—*Shìwén* notes: "Sīmǎ and Guō say: '*Yǎn* refers to the side of the screen.'" Guì Fù comments: "'*Píng* should read *pìn*. The *Jíjiùpiān* states, '*Pìn*, privies, clean and filthy, dung and soil,' where Yán’s annotation reads: '*Pìn* is the name for secluded recesses.'" Guō Qìngfān comments: "'*Yǎn* should be *yàn*. The *Zhōulǐ*’s *Gōngrén* states, 'They prepare its well and *yàn*,' where Elder Zhèng explains: '*Yàn* is the roadside privy.' The *Yàncè* reads, 'The King of Sòng cast images of the feudal lords and had them attend the screen and *yàn*'—*píngyàn* thus refers to privies." This gives rise to the shifting of right and wrong.

Let me attempt to speak of this shifting. The scattering or retention of even the smallest things has its proper time; the observation of a single chamber must be exhaustive. Yet because of this, one raises the matter of shifting right and wrong—then let me try to speak of this shifting. Here, life is taken as the root, and knowledge as the teacher. This means taking one’s own life as the foundation and one’s own mind’s knowledge as the guide. Thereby, one rides upon right and wrong, thus generating disputes over them. If there are indeed names and realities to contend over, one takes oneself as the standard, making others use oneself as the measure, and thus repays the measure with death. Guō comments: "'*Zhì* means 'master.'" Note: If there are indeed names and realities to be disputed, one takes one’s own body as the master, making others follow oneself as the standard of righteousness, and thus jointly defends it to the death—this is the so-called "dying to achieve fame."

In such a case, usefulness is deemed wisdom, and uselessness foolishness; thoroughness is deemed honor, and failure disgrace. In such a case, not only do I not control life and death, but even wisdom and folly, glory and shame are not within my control. If I am raised and employed, then I am deemed worthy and wise; if discarded and unused, then I am deemed mediocre and foolish; if I penetrate and ascend, then I am deemed honorable; if I remain mired and lowly, then I am deemed shameful. This shifting of right and wrong is the way of people today—only power shifts it, and this is the way of people today.

This is like the cicada and the fledgling dove being the same in their sameness. The *Xiāoyáo Yóu* speaks of the cicada and the *xué*-dove laughing at the great Peng—these two creatures are equally ignorant. Are people today not subject to the same ridicule as these two creatures?

If one treads upon the foot of a market-goer, one apologizes with an excuse of recklessness—*Shìwén* notes: "*Niǎn*, *nǚzhǎn* reflex. The *Guǎngyǎ* states: 'to tread.'" Xuān comments: "One apologizes and excuses oneself as reckless to take the blame." If it is an elder brother, one acts with tenderness—Xuān comments: "If one treads upon an elder brother’s foot, one need not apologize or take the blame but merely shows gentle affection." If it is a parent, that is all. Chéng comments: "If a father treads upon a son’s foot, one merely feels concern and says no more." Xuān comments: "One may know that the ultimate Way lies in mutual forgetting."

Thus it is said: The utmost ritual does not enter; Guō comments: "One sees others as oneself." The utmost righteousness does not treat things as objects; Guō comments: "If one attains what is fitting, then all things are oneself." The utmost wisdom does not scheme; Chéng comments: "One follows one’s nature and illuminates." The utmost benevolence has no partiality; Guō comments: "It is like the five viscera—though they do not particularly favor one another, benevolence is already complete." The utmost trust dispenses with gold. Xuān comments: "There is no need to use gold as a guarantee."

Shatter the turbulence of the will; Xuān comments: "*Chè* means 'to destroy.' *Bó* means 'disorder.'" Untie the knots of the heart; Chéng comments: "*Miù* means 'entanglement.'" Cast off the burdens of virtue, and open the blockages of the Way. *Dá* means "to penetrate."

Wealth, honor, prominence, authority, fame, and profit—*yán* means "authority"—these six are the turbulence of the will. Appearance, movement, countenance, speech, *qi*, and intention—these six are the knots of the heart. Appearance, movement, facial expression, words, *qi*, and emotions. Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—these six are the burdens of virtue. Withdrawal, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability—*zhī* means "wisdom"—these six are the blockages of the Way.

When these four sets of six do not agitate the breast, then one is upright. Guō comments: "*Dàng* means 'to move.'" When upright, one is tranquil; when tranquil, one is luminous; when luminous, one is empty; when empty, one does nothing yet nothing is left undone.

The Dao is the reverence of virtue; the Dao is invisible, but when one sees its flowing virtue, all revere it as the conduct of one who embodies the Dao—thus the Dao is the reverence of virtue. Life is the radiance of virtue; Chéng comments: "The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life—thus the generation and transformation of the myriad things is the radiant splendor of abundant virtue." Nature is the essence of life; Chéng comments: "Essence means 'root.' The natural nature is the root of the endowment of life." The movement of nature is called *wéi*; Guō comments: "When nature moves of itself, it is thus called *wéi*—this is true *wéi*, not artificial action." Artificial action is called loss. Chéng comments: "Responding to things with movement is the desire of nature. Artificial emotion and action beyond one’s lot is called the loss of the Way."

Knowledge is contact;

Contact with things and knowing them is called knowledge. Knowledge is planning; the character *zhī* (知) is pronounced as *zhì* (智). Planning means strategizing—discerning affairs and deliberating upon them, thus planning reveals wisdom. What the wise do not know is like a sidelong glance. Even the wise have things they do not know, like eyes gazing obliquely in one direction, unable to see all—thus the use of wisdom is partial, not equal to tranquil illumination.

Movement from necessity is called virtue; acting only under compulsion reveals abundant virtue. Movement without self is called order—abandoning the self to pursue things brings chaos, while the reverse brings order. Names oppose one another, yet realities align. Pursuing fame leads to artifice and disorder, ultimately to opposition; seeking reality leads to truth and order, ultimately to harmony.

Yi was skilled at hitting the smallest target yet clumsy at preventing others from praising him. Hitting the smallest target brings praise, for skill and clumsiness are ever intertwined. Only the great Dao can be without name. The sage is skilled in Heaven yet clumsy in man. Guo comments: "Following nature is Heaven; acting with intention is man." Only the complete person can be skilled in Heaven and adept in man. *Shiwen* notes: "*Liáng* (俍) is pronounced *liáng* (良)." Cheng comments: "*Liáng* means 'adept.' The complete person is the spirit-person." Note: The sage refers to those from Yao and Shun onward; the complete person, to those before Fuxi.

Only the creature can be creaturely; only the creature can be Heavenly. Cheng comments: "Birds fly and beasts run—this is being creaturely; spiders weave webs and dung beetles roll balls—this is being Heavenly. All are endowed by the Creator—how could imitation achieve this!" Note: The abilities of creatures are not uniform.

The complete person despises Heaven—despises man’s Heaven, let alone my Heaven or man! The saying that the complete person despises Heaven does not mean despising Heaven itself, but despising man’s Heaven—acting contrary to nature through artifice. If one simply takes man as Heaven and compels all under Heaven to follow, this is even further from the truth.

A sparrow encountered Yi—*shì* (适) means "to meet." Yi was certain to catch it, for he was mighty. Cheng comments: "What he captured was little; what escaped was much. Governing the world with might is likewise." If one takes all under Heaven as a cage, then no sparrow can escape. Cheng comments: "The great Dao is vast and unbounded, encompassing all—thus if one takes all under Heaven as a cage, no sparrow has a place to flee. This shows that seizing things by might deeply contravenes the great Creation."

Thus Tang used a cook to cage Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to cage Bai Li Xi. *Bāo* (胞) is the same as *páo* (庖). Yi Yin gained Tang’s favor through butchery and cooking; Bai Li Xi sold himself to a Qin cattle-keeper for five sheepskins, tending oxen to gain Duke Mu’s favor. Both cases were condemned by Mencius. Thus, if one does not use what they desire to cage them, it cannot be done.

The maimed cast aside restraint, heedless of external praise or blame. Guo notes: "介 means amputation." Cui comments: "拸画 means to disregard laws and measures." Yu observes: "The *Hanshu* annotation to the 'Biography of Sima Xiangru' states: *shē* (痑) means 'self-abandonment,' which shares the same sense as *chǐ* (拸) here. The *Guliang Commentary* to the sixth year of Duke Huan reads '以其画我,' while the *Gongyang Commentary* has '化我,' with He’s annotation: 'Excessive conduct without propriety is called *huà* (化).' The meaning of *huà* (画) is likely the same. Once a man’s foot is severed, he no longer cares for self-preservation, and praise or blame become matters of indifference—hence his disregard for laws and measures."

The convict laborer ascends heights without fear, having abandoned life and death. *Xūmí* refers to those sentenced to hard labor. Fu Yue was a *xūmí*. As for "repeated submission without reciprocation," the *Shiwen* notes: "馈 appears as 愧 in the Yuanjia edition." Guo Songtao explains: "The *Shuowen* states: *zhé* (詟) means 'speechless from intimidation,' and *chí* (謵) means 'speech that is *zhé*.' *Fùchí* (复謵) describes others submitting in speech out of deference. To give something to another is called *kuì* (馈); to offer words to another is also called *kuì*. *Bù kuì* (不馈) means not returning thanks." Heedless of external praise or blame, abandoning life and death—this is to forget oneself. "Repeated submission without reciprocation" is to forget others. Guo’s interpretation is closest, corresponding to the later phrase "revered yet unelated." Here, the text may be missing passages, and I dare not force an explanation. To forget others is thus to become one with Heaven and humanity.

To forget others is to become a celestial being, for one thereby approaches the natural. Thus, those who are revered yet unelated, or insulted yet unangered, are those who harmonize with the celestial harmony. Cheng Xuanying notes: "They forget both adversity and favor." Anger that arises from non-anger is anger born of non-anger; though it emerges from what others would find enraging, I do not grow angry, and thus even when anger arises, it still originates from non-anger. This is what Mencius meant by "King Wen’s singular wrath" and "King Wu’s singular wrath." Action that arises from non-action is action born of non-action; though it emerges from where others would act, I do not act, and thus even when action arises, it still originates from non-action. This is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls "accomplishing without action," and what Confucius called "governing through non-action." To still the qi, one must first calm it; to attain spiritual clarity, one must first follow the heart. Guo Xiang explains: "When the qi is calm, stillness and principle are complete; when the heart is followed, spiritual efficacy arrives." Yet this is still a form of action. To act appropriately, one must proceed from necessity. Guo Xiang notes: "Proceeding from necessity ensures all actions are fitting." Cheng Xuanying adds: "That which cannot be stopped—responding only when moved—is the proper duty of one’s station." Such necessity is the Way of the sage. Guo Xiang observes: "The sage takes this as the Way—how could he seek non-action beyond the indistinct and evanescent?"

In *Miscellaneous Chapters*, "Xu Wugui" (Chapter Twenty-Four):

Xu Wugui, through the minister Nü Shang, was granted an audience with Marquis Wu of Wei. The *Shiwen* notes: "Xu Wugui was a recluse of Wei. Sima Biao’s edition reads: ‘Xu Wugui of Mount Min.’" Cheng Xuanying explains: "Nü is the surname, Shang the given name; he was a minister of Wei." Marquis Wu, named Ji, greeted him, saying: "Master, you must be weary! Having endured the toils of mountain and forest, you have deigned to meet with me." Xu Wugui replied: "I am weary on your behalf—what weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the true nature of your life will sicken. If you suppress your desires and cast off your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I weary on your behalf—what weariness have you for me?" Marquis Wu was taken aback and made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wugui continued: "Let me tell you something—I read dogs. Those of low quality stop when sated; such is the virtue of the wildcat. Those of middling quality gaze fixedly, as if watching the sun. Those of high quality seem to have forgotten themselves." The *Shiwen* notes: "‘Forgotten themselves’ means their spirit remains unmoved, as if their body no longer exists." "Yet in reading dogs, I am not as skilled as I am in reading horses. In reading horses: the straight align with the plumb line, the curved with the hook, the square with the carpenter’s square, and the round with the compass. These are the horses of the state—what a lord would prize above all. But they do not compare to the horses of the world. The horses of the world possess innate talent, as if anxious, as if lost." The *Shiwen* notes: "‘Lost’ is pronounced *yi*; Sima Biao’s edition reads *yi*. Li Yi explains: ‘*Xu* and *yi* both describe a startled, soaring appearance.’" Cheng Xuanying adds: "Their eyes seem to watch themselves, as if troubled; their hooves move slowly, as if fleeing." "They seem to have forgotten themselves. Such horses surpass all, leaving no trace—one cannot fathom their limits." The *Shiwen* notes: "‘Limits’ refers to where they stop." Marquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed.

When Xu Wugui departed, Nü Shang asked: "Master, how did you alone delight our lord? When I delight our lord, I expound broadly with the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, or follow closely with the *Metal Tablets* and *Six Bow-Cases*." The *Shiwen* notes: "Sima Biao and Cui Hao explain: ‘*Metal Tablets* and *Six Bow-Cases* are chapter names in the *Book of Zhou.’* Some say they are esoteric prophecies. The text also reads *Six Strategies*, referring to the *Six Strategies* of the Grand Duke: *Civil*, *Martial*, *Tiger*, *Leopard*, *Dragon*, and *Hound.*’ ‘Tablets’ also reads *boards.*" Cheng Xuanying explains: "‘Broadly’ means distant; ‘closely’ means near. Marquis Wu favored martial arts and disdained culture, so I used military strategy for close persuasion and the Six Classics for distant discourse." "I have served him with great achievements too numerous to count, yet our lord has never once smiled."

"Now, sir, by what means have you persuaded our lord so that he has taken such delight?" Xu Wugui replied: "I merely told him of my skill in appraising dogs and horses." *Merely*—that is, solely.

Nü Shang said: "Is that all?" Cheng Xuanying explains: "He marvels at the shallowness of the method."

Xu Wugui said: "Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? This is a tale handed down from those days. When they had been away from their homeland for several days, they rejoiced at the sight of those they knew. After a month or so away, they rejoiced at the sight of those they had once seen in their homeland. After a full year, they rejoiced even at the sight of those who merely resembled their countrymen. Does this not show that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper one’s longing for them grows? *The longer*—that is, the more so.

Consider those who flee into the wilderness. Sima Biao explains: "They take ruined tombs as their refuge, dwelling in emptiness." Cheng explains: "This refers to the empty spaces beside abandoned sites, as the text below says, 'they take their place in the emptiness.'" Weeds and brambles stand like pillars along the paths of weasels and badgers—places where only such creatures tread, and where thorns and thickets rise like columns, so desolate and overgrown is the land. *Weeds*—that is, mugwort. The *Erya* says, 'Bai is the *shangdiao*,' and Guo Pu notes: '*Shangdiao* resembles *li* (goosefoot).' Yet when they hear the sound of human footsteps—*qiong*, the sound of walking—they rejoice. How much more, then, would they delight in the voices and laughter of brothers, kin, and dear ones at their side!" Li Yi explains: "*Qingkai* is a metaphor for speech and laughter."

This is to say: just as Marquis Wu’s fondness for dogs and horses made him rejoice at the mere mention of them—no differently than the exile who delights at the sight of a fellow countryman, or the fugitive who thrills at the sound of a kinsman’s voice—how long it has been since the words of a true person have been heard at our lord’s side!

"Yet when true words are spoken, none are brought to our lord’s side.

Xu Wugui presented himself before Marquis Wu, who said: 'Sir, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating acorns and chestnuts—Guo Qingfan notes: *Xu* (芧) is the oak, also called *xu* (栩), *yu* (●), or *cai* (采). Its fruit is called *zao* (皂) or *xiang* (样). In later texts, *xiang* is written as *xiang* (橡). The characters *xu* (芧), *yu* (●), and *zhu* (杼) are interchangeable. In this chapter, *xu li* (芧栗) appears as *zhu li* (杼栗) in the *Mountain Trees* chapter.' You are sated with scallions and leeks, yet you reject our lord to come as a guest—*bin* here means *ban* (to cast aside). How long it has been! Are you now old? Do you seek the taste of wine and meat? Li [Yi] says: '*Gan* means to seek.' Or does our lord possess some blessing for the altars of soil and grain?' Li [Yi] says: 'This refers to good words and fine counsel that may benefit the altars of soil and grain.'

Xu Wugui replied: 'Wugui was born in poverty and low station and has never dared to partake of your lordship’s wine and meat. I have come to offer you labor.' The Marquis said: 'What is this? How do you labor me?'"

The speaker said: "You labor both your lordship’s spirit and form." Cheng [Xuanying] notes: "When the form is wearied, the spirit grows weary—thus I offer comfort." Marquis Wu asked: "What do you mean?"

Xu Wugui replied: "The nurture of Heaven and Earth is one." Xuan [Ying] notes: "The life Heaven and Earth grant to all people is the same." To ascend high does not make one tall; to dwell low does not make one short. High and low here mean noble and base. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, wear out the people of an entire state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—while the spirit does not consent to this." Xuan [Ying] notes: "The heart-spirit must feel some disquiet." The spirit loves harmony and hates self-interest. Xuan [Ying] notes: "Harmony means unity with things; self-interest is private gain." Self-interest is a sickness, and so it wearies you. Why do you alone suffer from this sickness?"

Xuan [Ying] notes: "Why do you bring this sickness upon yourself?"

Marquis Wu said: "I have long wished to meet you, Master. I wish to love the people and practice righteousness by laying down arms—may this be done?"

Xu Wugui replied: "It cannot. To love the people is the beginning of harming them; though called love, in truth it binds them to service—thus love becomes the start of harm. To practice righteousness by laying down arms is the root of raising arms; though called disarmament, enemy states lie in wait—thus disarmament becomes the root of war. If you proceed thus, you will likely fail. To name a thing and then act otherwise is nearly certain to fail. All attempts to achieve fine reputations are ill-omened tools. Though you act with benevolence and righteousness, will you not become entangled in the trappings of reputation and turn false? Form inevitably gives rise to form; the formless form can create all forms. Yet achievement inevitably invites self-praise; the moment a name is achieved, there is boasting of merit. Change inevitably leads to external conflict; as affairs shift, one daily contends with the outside world. You must not array your troops in crane formation between the towers of the *Li Qiao*, nor station cavalry and infantry in the halls of the *Zi Tan* Palace." Li [Yi] notes: "*Hè liè* means troops arrayed like cranes in formation; *Li Qiao* is the name of a tower." (The halls of the *Li Qiao* and the *Zi Tan* Palace are no place for deploying troops or galloping horses—this is a metaphor urging you not to indulge the mind’s warfare.) Do not hoard what is gained through perversity; let gain come through compliance. Do not overcome others through cunning, nor through schemes, nor through battle. All three are ways of hoarding what is gained through perversity. Those who kill the people’s soldiers and seize others’ lands to nourish their own private ends and their own spirits—nourishing their own bodies and their own heart-spirits—how can their wars be called good? There is no such thing as goodness in them. Where does victory lie? There is no such thing as victory. If you cannot desist, if you persist in this for the sake of the people, then cultivate sincerity within your breast to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not disturb them. If you cultivate your own sincerity to align with Heaven and Earth and refrain from causing disturbance, the people will already have escaped death—what need will you then have to lay down arms?

The Yellow Emperor wished to meet the great spirit *Dai Kui* on Mount Juci. Fang Ming drove the carriage, Chang Yu rode as attendant, Zhang Ruo and Xi Peng led the horses, while Kun Hun and Hua Ji followed in the rear. When they reached the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all lost their way and had nowhere to ask directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and asked him the way. "Do you know Mount Juci?" they asked. "I do," he replied. "Do you know where the great spirit *Dai Kui* resides?"

The boy said, "I do." The Yellow Emperor said, "How extraordinary, young lad! Not only do you know of Mount Juci, but you also know where the great spirit *Dai Kui* resides. I ask you about governing the world." The boy replied, "Governing the world is no different from this—it is like wandering in the wilds of Xiangcheng and nothing more. What else is there to do? There is no need to seek further affairs.

When I was young, I roamed freely within the Six Directions. Then I happened to suffer from *mào* illness. An elder taught me, saying, 'Ride the chariot of the sun and wander in the wilds of Xiangcheng.' Now that my illness has slightly improved, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions again. Governing the world is no different from this. What else is there for me to do?"

The boy declined, saying, "Such words are not my concern." The Yellow Emperor said, "Governing the world is indeed not your affair. Nevertheless, I beg to ask about governing the world." The boy declined again. The Yellow Emperor pressed further. The boy said, "What difference is there between governing the world and herding horses? Simply remove what harms the horses—that is all." Seeing what harms the horses and removing it allows the horses to preserve their natural state.

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and withdrew, calling him "Heavenly Master." He had already met *Dai Kui*.

Scholars find no joy without the vicissitudes of thought, rhetoricians find no joy without the order of discourse, and scrutinizers find no joy without the sharpness of reproach—all are confined by things. They strive to display their abilities, thus bound by the affairs of the world. Those who summon the age to rise in court seek to gather the people and together cross the ford—these are those who labor to exalt their dynasty. The mediocre among men glory in office, content with their rank and guarding their position—these merely take pride in their posts. The strong boast of hardship, their sinews and strength robust, meeting difficulty with arrogance. The brave rush toward peril, their nature fearless, facing calamity with vigor. Warriors delight in battle, long accustomed to arms and armor. Recluses cling to fame, dwelling in mountain forests, attached to lofty renown. Legalists expand governance, studying laws and seeking to broaden their methods. Ritualists refine their demeanor, binding themselves to rites and respecting formal appearances. Moralists value connection, practicing benevolence and righteousness, prizing interaction.

Farmers, without the toil of clearing wild grasses, find no harmony. Merchants, without the bustle of the marketplace, find no harmony. The common folk, when they have morning and evening tasks to share, spur one another on. Artisans, when their tools and machines are skillfully made, feel their spirits rise. Where wealth does not accumulate, the greedy grow anxious; where power does not stand out, the proud grow sorrowful. Those who wield influence and things delight in change, meeting the times with use, unable to remain inactive. Such men, driven by the pursuit of affairs, rejoice in upheaval, finding purpose only when the moment calls—all follow the turning of the seasons, unchanging in their ways, racing their forms and natures, submerged in the ten thousand things, never to return. How lamentable!

Zhuangzi said, "If an archer hits the mark without aiming, is he a good shot?" Huizi said, "He is." Zhuangzi said, "If the world lacks a shared standard of rightness, and each takes his own as right, then is everyone a Yao? Is that acceptable?" Huizi said, "It is." Zhuangzi said, "Then, among the four—Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and *Bing*—along with you, that makes five. Which of you is truly right? Or is it someone like Lu Ju? His disciples said, 'We have grasped the Master’s Way! We can heat a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer!' Lu Ju said, 'This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—this is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way.'"

Then he tuned two zithers for them, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When he plucked the *gong* note, the *gong* note resonated; when he plucked the *jue* note, the *jue* note resonated—their tones and temperaments were identical.

Xuan remarked, "He used *gong* and *jue* to encompass the five notes. The disciple spoke of qi summoning one another, so Lu Ju demonstrated tones moving one another. *Fei* means 'to place.' One zither was set in the hall, another in the chamber, separated by distance, yet when played, *gong* and *jue* responded in kind, their temperaments undifferentiated. This was Ju’s claim to the Way."

Yet if one alters a single string so that it no longer aligns with the five notes, and plucks it, all twenty-five strings vibrate—no different in sound, yet the ruler of tones is already present.

Xuan remarked, "Zhuangzi refutes Lu Ju’s claim that his Way is extraordinary. Whether considering the two zithers and their five notes resonating, or taking a single zither: when its original tuning is set, each of the five notes has its fixed string. Now, if one alters a single string to create a variation, it no longer aligns with the original five notes and should not respond. Yet when plucked, all twenty-five strings follow and transform, none failing to resonate. How could this involve some sound beyond the five notes? For the five notes can rotate to serve as the *gong*; the altered string becomes the *gong* of the new mode, like a ruler, and the remaining strings naturally follow its movement. Within a single zither, even in a changed mode, all respond without fail—how much more so for two zithers and their five notes, where resonance is but the natural principle? What is so extraordinary here? Ju now boasts of this to his disciples, priding himself on subtle mastery, yet does he recognize that the mutual resonance of tones differs from the mutual summoning of the two qi? Thus, what others deem false, one deems true; what one deems true, others deem false—yet in the end, they are the same. Is this not the case?"

Xuan said, "Hui and the four others each take their own as right, yet in the end there is no universally right—is this not like Lu Ju?"

Master Hui replied, "Now the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all contend with me in debate, the five schools arguing among themselves. They clash with words, overbear with voices, using speech to scrub one another clean, using reputation to press one another down. Yet none has ever deemed me wrong—how then does it stand?"

Xuan said, "If none of the four schools deems you wrong, what then?"

Guo observed, "'None has ever deemed me wrong' means each takes itself as right. Hui thus wishes to take this as the ultimate."

Zhuangzi said, "There was a man of Qi who maimed his son and sent him to Song to serve as a gatekeeper, his command to the gatekeeper made without regard for wholeness. The man of Qi was unkind, yet he too took himself as right, and so did this. When he sought a *xing* bell, he did so with bindings—fearing its damage, he thus took his love of the bell as right. When he sought his lost child, he never left his own domain, leaving his kind behind. In people’s self-certainty lies such folly!

There was a man of Chu who, lodging elsewhere, berated the gatekeeper. In the dead of night, when no one was about, he fought with the boatman, never leaving the shore’s edge, yet enough to breed resentment."

Guo observed, "The two men of Qi and Chu acted thus, never deeming themselves wrong. How different are the five schools’ self-certainty from this?"

Xuan noted, "*Li* means 'to cling.' In the dead of night, with no one present, the boat had not yet reached shore when he fought the boatman—his life was in peril. Both lodging elsewhere and berating the gatekeeper, and this, were enough to breed resentment."

Zhuangzi, attending a funeral, passed by Master Hui’s grave. Turning to his followers, he said, "A man of Ying daubed his nose-tip with a fly’s-wing-thin smear of white clay and had Carpenter Shi carve it away. Carpenter Shi swung his hatchet with the force of wind, and as he carved, the man of Ying stood unflinching. The clay was gone, yet his nose was unharmed. The Lord of Song Yuan heard of this and summoned Carpenter Shi, saying, 'Try doing this for me.' Carpenter Shi replied, 'Your servant once could carve thus. However, my material has long been dead.' Since the Master’s death, I have had no material, no one with whom to speak."

The Master here referred to Hui. Though Zhuang and Hui differed in conduct, they found deep accord. With Hui’s death, Zhuang had no one with whom to speak freely, and so he sighed.

When Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, "Uncle Zhong’s illness is grave—one can no longer avoid speaking of it. If it comes to the worst, to whom may I entrust the state?" Guan Zhong replied, "Whom does the Duke wish to entrust it to?"

The Duke said, "Bao Shuya."
Guan Zhong replied, "No. His character is upright and pure, a fine gentleman. Yet he does not associate with those unlike himself; he does not befriend those whose purity does not match his own—his aversion to evil is too severe. Upon once hearing of another’s fault, he never forgets it. If you place him in charge of the state, above he will oppose his lord, and below he will go against the people. It will not be long before he offends you."

The Duke said, "Then who is suitable?"
Guan Zhong answered, "If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that he forgets those above him and does not turn against those below. He feels shame before the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not match him. One who distributes virtue to others is called a sage; one who distributes wealth to others is called worthy. To rule over others as a worthy is never to win their hearts; to rule while considering oneself worthy is something people will not accept. But to humble oneself as a worthy before others is never to fail in winning their hearts. In governing the state, there are things he does not hear; in managing his household, there are things he does not see. If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do."

The King of Wu floated upon the river and ascended the Mountain of Monkeys. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, in terror abandoned their places and fled, escaping into the dense thickets. Yet one monkey, moving with leisurely grace, leapt and scratched, displaying its skill before the king. The king shot at it, but the monkey nimbly caught the swift arrows. Yu Yue notes: "The words *min* and *ji* share the same meaning. In the *History of the Later Han*, the *Biography of Li Yan* states, 'His speech was *ji* and swift,' with Li’s commentary explaining, '*Ji* means *min*.' Here, *min* and *ji* describe the monkey’s nature—its agility in catching arrows. Earlier annotations mistakenly attribute *min* and *ji* to the king’s archery." The king ordered his attendants to hasten their shots, and the monkey was seized and killed. Turning to his companion Yan Buyi, the king said: "This monkey relied on its skill and trusted in its agility, displaying arrogance toward me—thus it met its end. Take heed! Ah, do not let your demeanor make you proud before others!"

Yan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to temper his bearing. Guo Xiang notes: "*Zhu* here means 'to remove.'" He abandoned music and declined fame, setting aside pleasures and renouncing prominence. After three years, the people of his state praised him.

Nanbo Ziqi leaned against his armrest and sat, gazing upward as he exhaled slowly. Nanbo, also called Nanguo (with *bo* and *guo* being phonetically interchangeable), appears again in the "Discourse on Equalizing Things," where "armrest" is written as *ji*. Yan Chengzi entered and said: "Master, you are a paragon among beings. How can your form be made like withered bones, your heart like dead ashes?" (In the "Discourse on Equalizing Things," this reads "withered wood," while in the "Gengsang Chu" chapter, it is "the branches of withered wood." Here, "withered bones" is akin to "withered branches." The following text differs.) Ziqi replied: "Once, I dwelled in a mountain cave."

At that time, when Tian He once saw me, the multitudes of Qi thrice celebrated it. (The *Shiwen* notes: "The lord of Qi revered virtue, so the people rejoiced." Lu comments: "Tian He is Qi Taigong He.") I must have preceded him, and thus he knew; I must have sold it, and thus he bought it. My name first became manifest, and only then did he know—this is my selling while he buys. If I did not possess it myself, the name would belong to itself. How could he have known it? If I did not sell it, how could he have bought it?

Alas! I grieve for those who lose themselves (Xuan comments: "Pursuing externals, they lose their true nature."), and I grieve yet more for those who grieve for others (Xuan comments: "They too lose themselves."), and I grieve still further for those who grieve for the grief of others (Xuan comments: "They likewise lose themselves."). Thereafter, day by day, it grew more distant. (Xuan comments: "Only when all worldly concerns are cast aside does one attain the semblance of withered wood and dead ashes.")

When Confucius traveled to Chu, the king of Chu offered him a toast. Sunshu Ao stood holding the goblet, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and made a libation, saying: "Ah, the men of old!" (Here his words ended.) (The *Shiwen* notes: "In the *Zuozhuan*, Sunshu Ao was the minister of King Zhuang of Chu, before Confucius was born. After Confucius died in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai, the disorder of Duke Bai occurred, and Yiliao never served Chu. Moreover, in the twelfth year of Duke Xuan’s reign, the *Zuozhuan* records a Xiong Xiang Yiliao in Chu, a contemporary of Sunshu Ao, far removed from Confucius. This is likely a figurative reference." Cheng comments: "The ancients always made a libation before drinking. Yiliao poured the wine in offering, thus invoking the sage." Xuan comments: "At this banquet, it was the proper moment to seek the Dao’s principles. Perhaps these two guided Confucius to speak.") Confucius said: "I have heard of the wordless word, yet never before have I spoken of it—until now, when I speak of it.

Shinan Yiliao juggled his pellets and resolved the strife of two families. (Sima comments: "Yiliao was a brave man of Chu, skilled at juggling pellets. When Duke Bai was about to rebel and kill Zixi, Ziqī and Shi Qi said: ‘There is a Xiong Yiliao of Shinan; if we obtain him, he could withstand five hundred men.’ They went to tell him, but he refused. When they pressed him with a sword, he remained unmoved, juggling his pellets as before, and said: ‘I will not betray you.’ Duke Bai then killed Zixi. Ziqī sighed over the strife of the two families, but Yiliao took no part in their troubles." The text says "resolved the strife," which is incorrect; perhaps the records differ.) Sunshu Ao slept peacefully, holding the feathered wand, and the people of Ying laid down their weapons. (Sima comments: "Sunshu Ao slept tranquilly, cultivating virtue in the ancestral temple, yet his influence extended a thousand *li* beyond, deterring enemy states from daring to invade. The people of Ying laid down their weapons, having no one to attack. Ying was the capital of Chu." The *Shiwen* notes: "The feathered wand was held by those performing the *yu* dance." The *Huainanzi*’s "Mastery of Governance" states: "Formerly, Sunshu Ao slept peacefully, and the people of Ying could not employ their blades against others." This aligns with the present text. ["Employ" in Wang’s *Magazine* is corrected to "use."]) I wish I had lips three inches long." (He wished only to possess the means to speak.)

That is what is called the Dao that is not the Dao. (That refers to Yiliao. Sunshu Ao’s resolution of strife and laying down of weapons required no discourse—this is the wordless Dao.) This is what is called the eloquence of the wordless. Thus virtue encompasses the unity of the Dao. (No matter how one practices virtue, the aim is to accord with the Dao—unity alone suffices.) And words rest where knowledge cannot reach—this is perfection. (The highest knowledge. To halt at one’s allotted portion is to reach perfection.) The unity of the Dao cannot be matched by virtue. (Xuan comments: "Those who perceive virtue cannot equal it.") What knowledge cannot know, eloquence cannot exhaust. (Xuan comments: "Those skilled in eloquence cannot exhaust it.") To bear names like Confucian or Mohist is inauspicious. (Xuan comments: "To brandish names is an inauspicious virtue.")

Thus the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—this is the utmost greatness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know his name. Therefore, in life he holds no rank (Guo comments: "He possesses yet does not possess."), in death he receives no posthumous title (Cheng comments: "In life, he advanced others through merit, so in death, no title is fitting."). He does not accumulate substance (Guo comments: "He allows all things to know contentment."), nor does he establish a name—this is called the Great Person.

A dog is not good because it barks well, nor is a person worthy because he speaks well—how much less so for the great! (Guo comments: "The greater something is, the less it can be attained through effort.") To be great is not sufficient to be called great—how much less so for virtue! (Guo comments: "Only the natural is truly virtue.") The greatest completeness is none other than heaven and earth. Yet what do they seek? They are complete in themselves. Heaven and earth seek nothing, yet lack nothing. One who knows this completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, and does not exchange the self for things. (Xuan comments: "The self is more precious than things.") Turning inward, he is inexhaustible. (He is naturally inexhaustible.) Following the ancient Way, he does not wear it away. (He follows the ancient Dao without need for polishing.) This is the sincerity of the Great Person. (This is true substance.)

Ziqi had eight sons. Arranging them before him, he summoned Jiufang Yin and said: "Divine for me which of my sons is most auspicious." Jiufang Yin replied: "Kun is the most auspicious." Ziqi started in surprise and joy, asking: "In what way?" He said: "Kun will share the same food as the lord of the state for the rest of his life."

Ziqi’s face fell, and tears streamed down in unbroken flow. "My son," he said, "how could you have come to such an extreme!" Grieving for his misfortune, he wept.

Jiufang Yin replied: "To share the same food as the lord of the state—this grace extends to three generations, how much more to his parents? Yet now you hear this and weep, as if warding off good fortune. Your son is auspicious, but you are not."

Ziqi said: "Yin! How could you understand? What do you mean by calling Kun auspicious? It is nothing more than wine and meat passing through nose and mouth. What do you know of its source? All such things are wrested cruelly from the people.

I have never herded sheep, yet ewes appear in the southwest corner of my house. I have never hunted quail, yet they hatch in the northeast. If these things are not strange, what is?"

"Though you have neither farmed nor herded, ewes and quail still appear—though not taken from the people as a lord of state would, they must still come from some cause. Yet you have never once questioned this strangeness, why is that?

What I share with my son is a wandering through Heaven and Earth—a wandering at ease. With him, I roam in joy beneath Heaven; with him, I roam to eat upon the Earth. *Roam* here means to traverse. The meaning is fully explained in the *Gengsang Chu* chapter, where *roam* is written as *intermingle*. I do not join him in affairs, nor in schemes, nor in marvels. The *Gengsang Chu* chapter is largely the same.

With him, I ride the sincerity of Heaven and Earth without letting things clash against it. This corresponds to the earlier passage: *'Cultivate the sincerity within the breast to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth without clashing.'* With him, I drift along in compliance, not binding myself to what affairs deem fitting. I simply move with him in accord, without choosing what is deemed proper for affairs.

All this is the true practice of the Way with my son. Yet now, such worldly recompense has come! You are no worldly man of wine and meat, yet now you have received this worldly repayment of food and drink—how strange!

Whenever strange omens appear, there must be strange conduct behind them." Xuan commented: "This is the usual way of things." Alas!

"Yet it is not the fault of my son or me—it is Heaven that has dealt us this! This is why I weep." Xuan said: "Now there is no strange conduct, yet strange omens appear. It is hardly the fault of my son or me—is Heaven not endangering my house? This is why I weep."

Before long, he was bound and sent to Yan, where bandits seized him on the road. To sell him whole would be difficult; to maim him would be easier. Guo commented: "Keeping him whole risks escape; maiming him makes him easier to sell." Thus they cut off his foot and sold him in Qi, where he happened to serve as a gatekeeper in the streets of Qu Gong. Yet he ate meat to the end of his days. Xuan said: "Qu Gong was likely a fiefdom in Qi, akin to Duke Ye of Chu. Serving as a gatekeeper at the lord’s gate, he thus ate the same food as the lord of the state."

Nie Que met Xu You and asked: "Where are you going?" Xu You replied: "I am fleeing Yao." Nie Que asked: "What do you mean?" Xu You said: "Yao, with his bustling benevolence—Wang commented: *'Bustling' describes his diligent care and toil*—I fear he will become a laughingstock to the world. Might later generations resort to men devouring one another?" The *Shiwen* noted: "This refers to people racing after benevolence and righteousness, neglecting agriculture, and starving to the point of cannibalism." (This passage also appears in the *Gengsang Chu* chapter.)

"Gathering the people is not difficult: love them, and they draw near; benefit them, and they come; praise them, and they are encouraged; impose what they detest, and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, yet those who abandon benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who exploit them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is fundamentally insincere—Guo commented: *'Once benevolence and righteousness are practiced, they become pretense'*—and is but a tool lent to the rapacious. It is a sharp instrument placed in the hands of beasts of prey." Xuan said: "Like birds of prey coveting gain, akin to the avarice of Robber Zhi."

"Thus, one man’s judgment and control benefit the world—yet it is like a single glance. The *Shiwen* noted: *Sima: 'A fleeting glimpse.' Also read as* fu xie *or* pu jie." Xuan said: "One man’s judgment is limited, like a single blink of the eye—how can it encompass the conditions of all things? Yao knew that worthy men benefit the world, yet he did not know they also harm it. Only those who stand outside worthiness understand this." Xuan said: "Only those who do not exalt worthiness realize how the willful harm the world."

There are those who are *nuan shu*—the *Shiwen* noted: *"Nuan* means soft; *shu*, alluring"—those who are *ru xu*—the *Shiwen* noted: *"Ru xu* means lingering in momentary ease"—and those who are *juan lou*—the *Shiwen* noted: *"Juan lou* means cramped and curled."

The *nuan shu* learn the words of a single master, then preen and delight in private, believing themselves complete. Yet they do not know that nothing has truly taken shape—Cheng commented: "They do not realize that what they have learned amounts to nothing"—hence they are called *nuan shu*.

The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: they pick through sparse bristles—Cheng commented: "The long, sparse hairs"—and believe themselves in a vast palace or grand park, nestling in the crooks and crevices, between teats and thighs, thinking it a safe and advantageous dwelling. The *Shiwen* noted: *"Kui* is also written as *kui*." Guo Qingfan said: "The crooks and crevices likely refer to the inner thighs. The *Huainanzi*’s *Lanming* commentary states: *'Wei* means the deep, curved places.' The *Zuozhuan*’s Duke Xi 25th Year commentary by Du notes: *'Wei* means hidden, secluded places.' Thus, *wei* refers to inner, deep, and curved recesses." Yet they do not know that one day the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and wield fire, and they will be scorched along with the pig.

These advance or retreat only within their domain, their movements confined by boundaries—such are the *ru xu*."

The *juanlou* is Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton—mutton is rank. Shun possessed rank conduct, and the common folk delighted in him. Thus, with three relocations he founded cities, and by the time he reached the wilds of Deng, a hundred thousand households had gathered. The *Shiwen* notes: "Xiang said: 'Deng is the name of a settlement.' *Xu* is also written as *xu*." Xiang said: "Barren land is earth without grass or trees." It was hoped that his arrival would bring blessings—it was said they looked forward to Shun’s coming so that he might bestow his grace. Yet when Shun was raised up from barren land, his years had grown long, his keen hearing and sharp sight had faded, and he could not retire and return home. Such was the *juanlou*.

Therefore, the spirit-person loathes the multitude’s arrival. The transcendent spirit-person does not desire the masses to cling to him. When the multitude arrives, he does not draw near; when the multitude comes, he does not form close bonds. Without closeness, there is no advantage. Xuan said: "If he does not form close bonds, others will not see advantage in approaching him." Thus, he has no one excessively close, no one excessively distant. Embracing virtue and warming harmony—The *Shiwen* notes: "Yang: Xu reads *yu liang*; Li said: 'Yang means to roast, to be warmed by the qi of harmony.'"—he accords with the world. This is called the true person.

To ants, he discards cunning; to fish, he finds the proper course; to sheep, he abandons intent. Guo Songtao said: "Ants cling to rankness because they seek advantage—this is their cunning. Sheep’s rankness offers alluring profit—this is their intent. Ants have no cunning yet possess it; sheep have no intent yet possess it. Both should be abandoned. Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; people forget one another in the Dao and virtue. What rankness is there to long for? Thus it is said: to fish, he finds the proper course."

With the eye, one sees the eye—no outward seeing.
With the ear, one hears the ear—no outward hearing.
With the heart, one returns to the heart—no outward use.
Those who are thus: their equilibrium is as a plumb line—*Cheng* says: "Without heart-mind, yet things are rightly aligned."
Their transformation follows the flow.
"Follows" means to accord.
They move with change and shift.

The true persons of old relied on Heaven to respond—*Cheng* says: "Employing the Dao of spontaneity, emptying the heart-mind to await things."
*Xuan* says: "之 should be 人."
So it is.
They did not let the human enter the Heavenly.

The true persons of old—*Yao* says: "Repeating 'true person' to extol them."
In attaining it, there is life; in losing it, there is death.
In attaining it, there is death; in losing it, there is life.
Attaining spontaneity, there is life; losing spontaneity, there is death.
Attaining external glory, there is death; losing external glory, there is life.

Medicine—its substance is *qin*—*Sima* says: "Monkshood."
Platycodon—it is *jiling*—*Sima* says: "Chicken’s head, also called *qian*."
*Pig’s hooves*—*Sima* says: "Also called *zhuling*."
These are the emperors of their time.
Medicines have rulers and ministers.
These several kinds, observing what is timely and fitting, take turns as ruler.
How could they all be spoken of!

Goujian, with three thousand men in armor and shields, took refuge on Mount Kuaiji.
Only Wen Zhong could know how ruin might be preserved—*Xuan* says: "Clear in statecraft."
Only Wen Zhong did not know why his own person would bring sorrow—blind to self-preservation.

Thus it is said:
The owl’s eyes have their proper use—*Cheng* says: "Suited for night, not for day."
The crane’s legs have their proper measure—severing them brings grief.
To take length as the measure and remove it is to invite sorrow.

Thus it is said:
When the wind passes over the river, there is loss;
when the sun passes over the river, there is loss—*Xuan* says: "Blowing and scorching diminish the water."
Suppose only wind and sun were to guard the river together—
yet the river would deem them as never having disturbed it, for it relies on its source and flows onward.
If wind and sun were to constantly guard the river’s banks,
why would the river consider itself unharmed and undiminished?
Because the river’s source is long and distant, it has something to rely on as it flows.

Thus water guards the earth with certainty,
a shadow guards its person with certainty,
and things guard their kind with certainty—
each abides in its nature, remaining fixed and unmoving.

Therefore, the eye’s reliance on clarity is perilous,
the ear’s reliance on keen hearing is perilous,
the heart’s pursuit of gain is perilous—
their use is subject to exhaustion.

All capacities within the organs are perilous—
whatever the organs possess as capacities is also in danger.
Once peril has taken form, there is no time to change—
unable to turn back, when peril has fully formed, even the wish to alter it comes too late.

Disaster’s growth is ever-concentrated—
the lengthening of misfortune gathers heavily upon the person.
Its reversal depends on effort—
returning to spontaneity relies on the work of power.
Its fruition awaits time—
its resolution in self-reversal also requires long accumulation.

Yet people regard these as their treasures—
people take ears, eyes, heart, and organs as the body’s treasures,
exhausting their use without realizing their daily depletion.
Is this not lamentable?

Thus nations are lost and people are slaughtered without end—
the ruin of states and the slaughter of people continue unbroken through the ages.
Yet none inquire into the cause—
all stem from this failure to examine and question.

Yao said: "This is the source." Thus, when the foot treads upon the earth, though it treads, it relies on what it does not tread to achieve its far-reaching breadth. Treading and stepping are both acts of treading. Breadth means vast and distant. This speaks of the foot gaining the earth to tread upon—though the earth allows its treading, it relies on what remains untrodden to attain its far-reaching vastness.

In human knowledge, what is known is little; though little, it relies on what is unknown to comprehend what Heaven calls the Way. Human knowledge often suffers from its scarcity, yet even in its scarcity, it relies on what remains unknown to grasp the spontaneity of the Heavenly Dao. This unknowing is true knowing.

To know the Great Oneness, to know the Great Yin, to know the Great Vision, to know the Great Equality, to know the Great Square, to know the Great Trust, to know the Great Constancy—this is perfection.

Yao said: "To know these is true knowing—what else is there to say?"

The Great Oneness unifies all; Cheng said: "The Great Oneness is Heaven, which brings forth the myriad things, hence it is called 'unifying.'"

The Great Yin resolves all; Cheng said: "The Great Yin is Earth." Yao said: "It resolves entanglements."

The Great Vision sees all, striving to perceive its vastness.

The Great Equality follows all; Cheng said: "To follow is to accord." Guo said: "Accord with their fundamental nature, allowing each to attain its own, thus achieving Great Equality."

The Great Square embodies all; Guo said: "Embodying them so each attains its proper place—this is why it is called the Great Square."

The Great Trust verifies all; Cheng said: "To verify is to reach. Following and allowing each to attain its reality—this is Great Trust."

The Great Constancy upholds all; Guo said: "When the true is unperturbed, it naturally stabilizes, hence it is upheld by Great Constancy."

All these are of Heaven; Cheng said: "The seven 'Greats' above all arise from spontaneity."

Following brings illumination; Cheng said: "Accord with spontaneity, and wisdom naturally shines forth."

The obscure has its pivot; in the profound obscurity of silence, there is naturally a pivot.

The beginning has its other; within the Great Beginning, the seeds of self and other are already manifest.

Thus, its resolution resembles irresolution; Guo said: "Resolving it requires no effort, hence it seems like irresolution."

Its knowing resembles unknowing; Cheng said: "Able to forget knowledge, hence it seems like unknowing."

Only after unknowing does one attain true knowing.

In questioning, there can be no bounds—inquiring into the Dao has no fixed method.

Yet there can be no lack of bounds—for the Dao inherently has its principles.

Complexity holds reality; Yao said: "Complexity refers to entanglement." Each thing possesses its own inherent principle.

Past and present do not replace one another; Guo said: "Each has its own cause and cannot substitute for another."

Yet they cannot be diminished; Guo said: "Each should fully realize its proper place."

Can this not be called the great elucidation and verification?

Cheng said: "The Dao is vast—how can it not be the illumination of its wondrous principles and the verification of its true discourse?"

Why not inquire into this instead of remaining perplexed?

Yao said: "Why not investigate this principle rather than persist in confusion?"

Yao read the lines "all these are of Heaven," "illumination follows," "the obscure has its pivot," and "the beginning has its other," explaining: "That which is of Heaven follows the constant—through unknowing, one grasps its mystery. Illumination follows the obscure—through knowing, one grasps its subtlety. The former is the essence, hence the obscure has its pivot and the beginning has its other. The latter is the function, hence there is an 'other' as the standard. This standard is not fixed. This is not limited to certain individuals—all people possess it, though those with understanding are few. Yet it cannot be sought through understanding, hence questioning is difficult yet indispensable. This principle is real and not empty—why not inquire into it and remain perplexed for a lifetime?"

To resolve confusion with what is not confused, returning to non-confusion—this is the highest non-confusion. Now, using my own non-confusion to resolve others' confusion, returning to non-confusion—this is the greatest non-confusion.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: Zeyang (Chapter 25)**

Zeyang traveled to Chu. Cheng comments: "His surname was Peng, given name Yang, courtesy name Zeyang; he was a man of Lu." Yi Jie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not grant him an audience, and Yi Jie returned. Cheng comments: "Y

Of those who enter, nine in ten are concealed, leaving but one in ten visible from without—yet even this brings joy and delight. How much more so when one sees what one has always seen and hears what one has always heard?

It is like a towering terrace suspended amidst the crowd—Yu comments: "As if a ten-ren terrace were raised before the eyes and ears of all, so that none fail to see and hear it; its joyous effect would be even more evident."

The Lord of Ran Xiang attained the center of the ring and followed completion—Yu comments: "The *Lu Shi* records a Lord of Ran Xiang in the *Xun Fei Ji*." Guo comments: "Abiding in emptiness to follow things, so that things complete themselves."

With things, there is no end and no beginning, no near and no time—Cheng comments: "No beginning means no past; no end means no future; no near and no time means no present." Note: The character "日" should be read with the preceding phrase.

One who transforms with things is one who does not transform—Guo comments: "Transforming with things, one is ever without self; being ever without self, one is ever unchanging." Note: This passage also appears in the *Zhi Bei You* chapter.

When has one ever abandoned it? (阖同曷) Cheng comments: "Moving with transformation, when has one ever briefly set it aside?"

One who would model oneself on Heaven yet fails to model oneself on Heaven, perishing with things—how then can one make this one’s task? One who desires to follow Heaven’s spontaneity yet ultimately fails, thus perishing with things—how can one conduct oneself in engaging with things?

The sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with man, never begun with a beginning, never begun with things—Xuan comments: "Such is the absence of intent." Moving with the world without ceasing, what is accomplished is complete yet not ruined—Wang comments: "洫 means ruin." Note: Moving with things without cessation, what is done is complete and unspoiled—this is what is called "non-action that leaves nothing undone."

How does one unite with it? How does one unite with the Dao without intent?

The two questions "how then" urge one to reflect and choose for oneself.

Tang found his steward, Gatekeeper Yin Deng, and made him his tutor—Xuan comments: "Steward and Gatekeeper are official titles." Xiang comments: "Deng Heng was the man’s name." Cheng comments: "Tang forgot things and obtained a worthy minister as his teacher, governing with folded arms without acting." Note: Steward and Gatekeeper were likely two offices; it is suspected that text may be missing after "御," hence Guo’s comment: "He entrusted it to the hundred officials and did not interfere."

Not limited to one teacher, hence below it says "following the teacher without confinement." Following the teacher without confinement, one attains the ability to follow completion—Xuan comments: "Following the teacher without being confined by the teacher, one attains the Way of the ring’s center and following completion."

He made him steward of the name of names—Cheng comments: "Attributing merit to the steward, the name did not rest with himself."

Through effortless adherence to the law, both were made manifest—Cheng comments: "嬴然 means without intent; 见 means manifest." Note: Without reliance on teacher or law, ruler and minister both became illustrious—this is what is called "illuminating through one’s lord."

Confucius exhausted his thoughts and became his tutor—Guo comments: "Confucius said, ‘What thought, what reflection does the world require?’ His thoughts were already exhausted." Xuan comments: "One should take Confucius as a teacher and be transformed by him."

The Master of Rong Cheng said: "Remove the days and there are no years." Guo comments: "The reason we now have years and preserve days is because of life and death. If there were no death and no life, then the reckoning of years and days would be abolished." Note: The *Huainanzi*'s *Benjing Xun* glosses: "The Master of Rong Cheng was the maker of the calendar in the time of the Yellow Emperor." "There is no inner, no outer." Cheng comments: "The inner is the self; the outer is things. Because we reckon life and death, there is inner and outer. Once years and days are dispensed with, where would self and things be applied?" Yao comments: "Remove the days and there are no years—this is accumulating the few to make the many. There is no inner, no outer—this is accumulating the subtle to make the manifest. These are the maxims of the ancients."

Wei Ying made a pact with Marquis Tian Mou. Sima comments: "Ying was King Hui of Wei; Mou was King Wei of Qi." Marquis Tian Mou broke the pact. Wei Ying was enraged and was about to send an assassin after him. The Marshal of the Rhinoceros heard of it and was ashamed, saying: "You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would follow a commoner in seeking vengeance!" The Marshal of the Rhinoceros—*Shiwen* gloss: "An official title of Wei. Sima comments: 'Like the Tiger’s Fang General of today; Gongsun Yan held this office.'" Yan requested to receive two hundred thousand armored troops to attack Qi on his lord’s behalf, capture its people, lead away its cattle and horses, and make its lord’s heart burn with rage until it erupted on his back, then seize his state. Ignoring this, Tian Ji fled—this was Tian Ji. Only then did he strike his back and break his spine.

""*Shiwen* gloss: "'Chì' means 'to strike.'" Jizi heard of this and was ashamed, saying—*Shiwen* gloss: "Jizi, a minister of Wei"—"To build a wall seventy feet high, only to tear it down once it reaches seventy feet—this is the toil that convict laborers lament. Now, for seven years, no war has arisen; this is the foundation of Your Majesty’s rule. Yan is a disturber of order and must not be heeded."

Xuan comments: "Even convict laborers regret the destruction of a wall they have built, yet the Rhinoceros’ Marshal would overturn the very foundation of kingship. Such a man is a disturber of order."

Huazi heard of this and found it disgraceful, saying—*Shiwen* gloss: "Huazi, also a minister of Wei"—"He who speaks well of attacking Qi is a disturber of order; he who speaks well of not attacking Qi is also a disturber of order. To declare that those who advocate attack or non-attack are disturbers of order—this, too, is the speech of a disturber of order." *Cheng* comments: "These are Huazi’s own words."

Xuan comments: "He has not yet freed his mind from entanglement in affairs."

The king said, "Then what should be done?"

Huazi replied, "Your Majesty need only seek the Dao."

Xuan comments: "The Dao is of the same substance as the Great Void. Even the enterprise of kingship is not worth mentioning—how much less the venting of anger!"

Huizi heard this and went to introduce Dai Jinren.

*Shiwen* gloss: "Jinren, a worthy of Liang; Huishi recommended him to the king of Wei."

Dai Jinren said, "There is a creature called the snail—does Your Majesty know of it?"

*Shiwen* gloss: "‘Snail’ is pronounced *guā*. Li comments: ‘It has two horns and is commonly called the snail-ox.’ *Sancang* states: ‘A small ox-shaped snail, popularly named the yellow calf.’"

The king said, "Yes."

"There is a kingdom on the left horn of the snail called the Chus, and a kingdom on the right horn called the Mans. From time to time, they contend over territory and wage war, leaving tens of thousands of corpses strewn upon the field. The victors pursue the routed for fifteen days before returning."

The king said, "Alas! Is this mere empty talk?"

Dai Jinren said, "Allow your servant to make this real for Your Majesty. When Your Majesty directs your mind to the four directions, above and below—are they bounded?"

*Suyu* notes: "‘Directs’ here means ‘examines.’"

The king said, "They are unbounded."

Dai said, "To know the mind roams in the unbounded, yet returns to the realm of common access—does it exist or not?"

*Guo* comments: "Where human traces reach is ‘common access,’ meaning the present world within the four seas."

*Cheng* comments: "In terms of its magnitude, it may be said to be as if present, as if absent."

The king said, "So it is."

Dai said, "Within the realm of common access lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang."

*Cheng* comments: "Formerly in Hedong, the state was called Wei. Pressed by Qin, it moved its capital to Liang."

"Within Liang lies Your Majesty. Between Your Majesty and the Mans—is there any distinction?"

The king said, "There is no distinction."

The guest departed, and the king was left in a daze, as if something had been lost.

*Shiwen* gloss: "‘Daze’ means ‘bewildered.’"

As if something were missing.

When the guest departed, Huizi came to see the king.

The preceding "guest departed" and these two characters "guest departed" are likely superfluous.

The king said, "That guest is a great man—even a sage cannot compare to him."

*Cheng* comments: "What Jinren discussed was vast and profound; the conduct of sages like Yao and Shun would not suffice to match him."

Huizi said, "When one blows into a *guan*-pipe, there is a resounding note."

*Shiwen* gloss: "*Xiao*, pronounced *hūxiāo* (許交反), is the sound of the pipe."

"But when one blows into the ring of a sword hilt, there is only a faint *xuè*."

*Shiwen* gloss: "*Xuè*, pronounced *xuè* (血) or *xuè* (呼悅反). Sima comments: ‘The ring of a sword hilt refers to the small hole in the pommel. The sound is like a gust of wind passing—*xuè*.’"

"Yao and Shun are what people praise; yet to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint *xuè*."

When Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the thatched hut of an ant-hill wine-seller.

*Li* comments: "Ant-hill is the name of a mountain. A family that sells wine."

His neighbors—a husband and wife, master and servant—climbed to the ridgepole.

*Sima* comments: "The ridgepole is the roof beam. They ascended to look out."

Zilu said, "What is this bustling crowd doing?"

The crowd is gathered thus—what are they doing?"

*Shiwen* gloss: "*Zōng*, also written as 总."

Cheng comments: "A multitude assembled."

Zhongni said, "They are the servants of a sage.

Cheng comments: "In ancient times, the virtuous and the noble were all called sages; thus Confucius refers to Yiliao of Shinan as a sage. He means that this bustling crowd are the retainers of Yiliao of Shinan."

They bury themselves among the people,

Guo comments: "They dwell among them as equals."

they conceal themselves in the fields.

Wang comments: "They hide in the furrows at the edges of the fields."

Their voices fade, yet their aspirations are boundless, their minds set upon the great Dao. Though their mouths may speak, their hearts never truly utter a word, ever serene and still. Even as they stand apart from the world, their minds disdain to keep it company.

Cheng comments: "Both their hearts and their conduct are at odds with it."

They are those who "sink on dry land,"

Xuan comments: "They drown themselves where no water is."

are they not Yiliao of Shinan?"

Zilu asked to go and summon him.

Confucius said, "Enough! He knows that I am aware of him,

Cheng comments: "*Zhuó*: to recognize clearly."

he knows that I am traveling to Chu, and takes me for one who will surely persuade the King of Chu to summon him. He would regard me as a flatterer. One who feels thus about flatterers would feel shame even to hear their words—how much more to meet them face to face! He will certainly not come. And how can you assume he still exists?"

The Xuan commentary states: "He would surely flee and depart."

Zilu went to see him, and his dwelling was empty.

The Warden of Changwu asked Zilao, *Shiwen* notes: "Changwu is a place name. The Warden is the one who guards the border. Sima Biao says: 'Zilao is Qin Lao, a disciple of Confucius.'" "When governing as a ruler, do not act recklessly; when ordering the people, do not act carelessly." Sima Biao says: "Recklessness is like coarse plowing and sparse sowing. Carelessness is like cutting down the grass." Lu comments: "*Cū* is read as *qiān nú*; *cū* as *cái gǔ*. These two characters were often used together in ancient times. The *Fanlu* in the *Yu Sequence* states: 'Beginning with the coarse, ending with the refined.' The *Lunheng* in the *Zhengshuo* chapter says: 'Briefly setting forth the coarse outlines to illuminate the subtle and wondrous text within.' There are many other instances where *cūcū* is used together, meaning coarse and rough. Some wish to emend it to *cūshū* (careless), but I correct it here."

"In the past, when I cultivated grain, if I plowed recklessly, the harvest would repay me in kind; if I weeded carelessly, the harvest would repay me in kind. The next year, I changed my methods—deepening the plowing and carefully tending the soil." Sima Biao says: "*Yōu* means to hoe." "The grain flourished and multiplied, and I had my fill of food for the entire year." *Yàn* means sufficiency.

Zhuangzi heard this and said: "Nowadays, when people cultivate their bodies and order their minds, many resemble what the Warden described: they flee from their Heaven, depart from their nature, extinguish their emotions, and lose their spirit, all for the sake of busyness. There is nothing they do not pursue. Thus, those who recklessly harm their nature—desires and aversions sprout like calamities, turning their nature into reeds and rushes." *Note*: This means that what they desire and what they detest grow rampantly, injuring their true nature, which becomes like reeds and rushes.

"At first, these sproutings seem to support my form, but soon they uproot my nature." Yu comments: "*Xún* and *shǐ* are opposites in meaning. The *Hanshu* in the *Jiaosi Zhi* states: 'It gradually extended to Mount Tai,' and Jin Zhuo notes: '*Xún* means to proceed further.' This means that the affairs of desire and aversion, at first sprouting, seem to assist my form, but as time passes, they seduce my mind and uproot my nature."

"They burst forth in chaotic dissolution, erupting without choosing where to emerge." *Bìngkuì* means to collapse in disarray. *Lòufā* means to break through and emerge. This describes how the harm of emotions and desires collapses and erupts everywhere, without regard for place, so that the spirit is first ruined, and the form and *qi* follow.

"Boils, sores, scabies, and ulcers arise, as do internal heat and turbid urine." *Shiwen* notes: "*Piāo* is also written as *biāo*. *Biāojū* refers to festering sores. *Sōugāo* refers to the fatty white foam that forms on the urine of those suffering from consumptive exhaustion."

Boju studied under Lao Dan. *Shiwen* notes: "Boju was a man of the Dao."

Boju said, "I beg to wander through the world." Lao Dan replied, "Enough! The world is all like this." Boju asked again, and Lao Dan said, "Where will you begin?" Boju answered, "I will begin in Qi."

When he arrived in Qi, he saw a man who had been executed. He pushed the body to straighten it, removed his court robes to cover it, and wailed to Heaven, saying, "You! You! The world suffers great calamity, yet you alone have met it first!" *Great calamity* refers to being killed.

He cried, "Do not steal! Do not kill!" Xuan comments: "He also said, 'Was it not for stealing? Was it not for killing?'" When honor and disgrace are established, then one sees what brings suffering. Guo comments: "If each attains what is proper, there is no honor or disgrace. But when gain and loss are tangled, honor and disgrace arise. Once they arise, one exalts what is called disgrace and strives for what is called honor. Racing between exaltation and striving—how is this not suffering?" When wealth and goods are amassed, then one sees what brings strife. Guo comments: "If one takes contentment as wealth, what would there be to strive for?"

Now, establishing what brings people suffering, amassing what brings them strife, exhausting their strength without respite—how could one avoid reaching this point? Guo comments: "When superiors have their preferences, inferiors cannot rest in their proper places."

The rulers of old took success as belonging to the people and failure as their own; they took uprightness as belonging to the people and wrongdoing as their own. Cheng comments: "They drew blame to themselves." Thus, if a single person lost their proper form, they would withdraw and take responsibility. *A single person* refers to any individual. Cheng comments: "If a single thing lost its place, harming its form and nature, they would take responsibility, as when Tang of Yin cut his hair and nails to bring relief from drought for a thousand *li*."

Now it is not so. They conceal their actions and deem others foolish for not recognizing them, hiding what they do and blaming those who do not understand these things as ignorant. They create great difficulties and punish those who dare not act; they impose heavy burdens and penalize those who cannot bear them. Xuan comments: "They overburden with tasks and punish those who cannot fulfill them." They set distant paths and condemn those who do not arrive. Xuan comments: "They lengthen the journey and punish those who do not reach the end."

When the people know their strength is exhausted, they resort to deception to continue. Guo comments: "To avoid punishment and penalties." Deception increases daily—how can the scholars and common people not be false? Xuan comments: "For the inferiors imitate their superiors."

When strength is insufficient, there is deception; when wisdom is insufficient, there is deceit; when wealth is insufficient, there is theft. Whom can one blame for the acts of theft and robbery?" Guo comments: "One should blame those above."

Qū Bóyù, at sixty years of age, underwent sixty transformations. Xuan comments: "He was not confined by the past." There was never a time when he began with what was right only to end by condemning it as wrong. Cheng comments: "Within a single year, what is right is not constant; thus what was right at the beginning may be condemned as wrong by the end." How could one know that what is deemed right today is not what was deemed wrong in the fifty-nine years prior? This echoes the "Parables" chapter, where Confucius speaks similarly.

All things possess life, yet none see their root; all things emerge, yet none see their gate. People all honor the knowledge of what they know, but none know to rely on the knowledge of what they do not know before attaining true knowledge—can this not be called a great delusion? The first two instances of *zhi* are pronounced as "wisdom"; the last is read as the character itself. Guo comments: "What I do not know, other things may know. Thus, employing the knowledge of things, there is nothing one cannot know; relying solely on my own knowledge, one knows very little. Now, if one does not rely on things for knowledge but instead exalts one’s own wisdom, then things will not inform me—how can this not be a great delusion?" Xuan comments: "The knowledge of what one does not know refers to the 'unseen' mentioned above."

Enough! Enough! There is no escape from this. Xuan comments: "Who in ancient or modern times could escape this principle of the unknown?" Is this what is meant by "so it is," or is it not so? The *Exegesis* states: "The phrase 'is it so?' suggests it is not yet so." This aligns with the meaning in the *Analects*: "So it is—yet is it truly so?"

Confucius asked the Grand Historian Dàtāo, Bó Chángqiān, and Xī Wéi—the three were officials of the archives—saying: "Duke Ling of Wei indulged in wine and revelry, neglecting the governance of the state; he devoted himself to hunting and archery, ignoring his duties among the feudal lords."

"Sīmǎ comments: 'Jì refers to matters of alliances and assemblies.'" Why then was he called "Líng Gōng"? Guō comments: "Líng has two meanings."

Dàtāo said: "It is because of this very reason." Chéng comments: "To be disordered yet unharmed is called *líng*; it is a posthumous title for one without the Way, hence 'it is because of this very reason.'"

Bó Chángqiān said: "Duke Líng had three wives, with whom he bathed together in the same vessel." *Exegesis*: "Làn refers to a bathing vessel." The historian presented the ritual implements and advanced to the proper place. The Duke clasped the silk and supported him with reverence. Chéng comments: "Upon seeing Shǐ Yú, the Duke was deeply ashamed and remorseful; he dispatched attendants to grasp the silk, commanding them to assist and escort him with deference, sending him off with consolation." His arrogance was extreme as seen there, yet his reverence before the worthy was as solemn as this—this is why he was called Líng Gōng." Chéng comments: "Moreover, the rules for posthumous titles state: 'One whose virtue is pure and luminous is called *líng*.'"

Xī Wéi said: "When Duke Líng died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb proved inauspicious, while divination for burial at Shāqiū was auspicious. After digging several *rèn* deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing and inspecting it, they saw an inscription that read: 'Not relying on his descendants, Líng Gōng seized and dwelled here.'" *Exegesis*: "Lǐ means dwelling." Guō Sōngtāo comments: "Among the ancients who were buried, if descendants lacked the ability to rely upon and protect the tomb, Líng Gōng took and occupied it." That Líng Gōng was *líng* had long been so—how could those two men have understood it?" Sū Yú comments: "Xī Wéi attributes it to predetermination, the origin of those who speak of fate and the numinous."

Shàozhī asked Dàgōng Tiáo: "What is meant by 'the words of the village and neighborhood'?"

Dàgōng Tiáo replied: "'Village and neighborhood' refers to the blending of a hundred names from ten clans to form customs. Uniting the disparate as one—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Uniting the ten and hundred as village and neighborhood'—and dispersing the one into the disparate—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Dispersing village and neighborhood into ten and hundred.' Now, pointing to the hundred parts of a horse, one does not obtain the horse; yet when the horse stands before one, its hundred parts are called the horse—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Only by uniting the disparate as one can the Dao be seen. The principles of the world are all thus.'

Thus, hills accumulate the low to become high; rivers gather waters to become great—Yú Yuē notes: '*Waters* is an error for *small*. High and low, small and great, form parallel phrases.' The great person unites and merges to become impartial—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Without partiality toward the world, the customs of the world become one.' Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not rigidly held—Guō Xiàng notes: 'The mind is the great root of the world; thus what enters from without has a residing master but no bias.' What issues from within has rectitude but does not resist—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Conduct is the world’s universal Dao; thus what issues from within attains right principle and things cannot oppose it.'—Note: *Rectitude* appears as *matching* in the *Tiānyùn* chapter commentary.

The four seasons have distinct *qi*, yet Heaven does not bestow them, so the year is completed—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Bestowal would be partial.' The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not favor them, so the state is well-governed—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Distinct duties naturally possess their own talents; thus they are entrusted, not favored.' The civil and martial in the great person are not bestowed, so their virtue is complete—Guō Xiàng notes: 'The civil is naturally civil, the martial naturally martial; they are not bestowed by the great person. If they arose from bestowal, they would at times be lacking. Not only the civil and martial—all natures are thus.'—Note: Guō Xiàng’s edition includes *distinct talents* after *martial*, but the text appears incomplete. Later editions, including the *Shìwén* and *Chéng* commentary, omit this, likely a later interpolation.

The myriad things have distinct principles; the Dao is not partial, so it is nameless—Guō Xiàng notes: 'The Dao is undifferentiated; it cannot be named.' Being nameless, it is non-action; being non-action, it is yet without non-action—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Names are limited by reality, hence non-action; realities act of themselves, hence without non-action.' Times have endings and beginnings; the world has changes. Fortune and misfortune flow on—Wáng notes: '*Flow on* describes their movement.'—where there is obstruction, there is also what is fitting—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Fortune and misfortune are intermingled, naturally interdependent; within disappointment lies what is favorable.'

Pursuing distinct faces—Chéng notes: '*Pursuing* means following; *faces* means directions. Right and wrong, each clinging stubbornly, thus each follows its own view and their directions differ.'—where there is rectification, there is also deviation—Guō Sōngtāo notes: 'Forcing divergence to be called rectification is in fact mutual deviation.'

Compare it to a great marsh: all hundred timbers are measured—all trees drifting downstream are measured by the water’s edge; none are discarded. Compare it to a great mountain: trees and stones share the same foundation—Chéng notes: '*Foundation* means base.' This is what is meant by 'the words of the village and neighborhood.'"

Shàozhī said: "Then is calling it the Dao sufficient?"

Dàgōng Tiáo replied: "No. Now, when counting things, their number is not limited to ten thousand, yet we designate them as 'the ten thousand things'—Chéng notes: '*Designate* means limit.'—calling them by the number of the many—Lǐ notes: '*Calling* means speaking.' Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yīn and yáng are the greatest of *qi*; the Dao is their impartiality—Guō Xiàng notes: 'The Dao is what Heaven and Earth, yīn and yáng share in common. It cannot be pointed to as form, nor as *qi*; its greatness is unparalleled.' Designating it by its greatness to call it so may be permissible—Guō Xiàng notes: 'Just as the ten thousand things cannot be counted and are roughly designated for convenience, the Dao’s greatness cannot be pointed to, so it is roughly designated by the word *Dao*. How could there truly be one thing or affair that can be named the Dao?' Yet once it is named, how can it be compared? If you argue thus, it is like dogs and horses—far from reaching the Dao—Guō Xiàng notes: 'If you say "call it the Dao," then the Dao is like naming a dog as dog, a horse as horse, equating it with a single thing—far from the Dao.'"

Shàozhī said: "Within the four directions, within the six conjunctions, from whence do the ten thousand things arise?"

Dàgōng Tiáo replied: "Yīn and yáng illuminate, cover, and govern one another—Yú Yuē notes: '*Cover* should be read as *harm*. The *Shìyán* states: "*Cover* means to sever." The *Shìwén* notes: "*Cover* in Shèrén’s edition is *harm*." Thus, yīn and yáng sometimes harm, sometimes govern one another, as below: "The four seasons give way to, generate, and destroy one another." Desire and aversion, approach and withdrawal, arise therefrom—Guō Xiàng notes: "*Arise* means to emerge."—Chéng notes: "*Arise* describes their appearance." Male and female unite in their ordinary pairing."

"Lu's *Exegesis* notes: '*Piàn* is pronounced *pàn*.' Chéng comments: '*Yōng* means constant.' Danger and safety alternate, fortune and misfortune arise from one another, urgency and delay rub against each other, gathering and scattering thus take form. Urgency and delay refer to long life and early death; gathering and scattering refer to life and death. These are the principles of names and realities that can be recorded, the subtleties that can be inscribed. Following the sequence, they mutually order one another; in their cyclical movement, they mutually employ one another—Chéng comments: 'The four sequences follow one another, alternately governing and ordering; the Five Phases move in motion, successively driving one another.' Exhaustion returns to the beginning, ending reverts to the start. These are the attributes of things, the limits of speech, the extent of knowledge—merely the utmost of visible things. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what is abandoned, nor trace what arises—Xuān comments: 'Knowing it has no origin, they accord with its spontaneity. *Suí* means to pursue.' This is where discussion halts." Xuān comments: "How can one rashly claim to know whence the ten thousand things arise!"

Shàozhī said: "Jì Zhēn’s doctrine of *non-action* and Jiēzǐ’s doctrine of *some agency*—which of these two theories accords with reality? Which is partial in its reasoning?" Chéng comments: "Jì Zhēn and Jiēzǐ were worthy men of Qí, both frequenting the Jìxià academy. *Mò* means *without*; *shǐ* means *to act*. Jì Zhēn took non-action as the Dao, while Jiēzǐ held that the Dao has the power to act upon things. Each adhered to one school, neither offering a comprehensive discourse, hence the question to determine their merits." Yú comments: "The *Lǐjì* *Jìyì* commentary by Zhèng and the *Mèngzǐ* *Gōngsūn Chǒu* commentary by Zhào both state: '*Huò* means *to have*.' Here, *huò* stands opposite *mò*. *Mò* is *without*; *huò* is *to have*. The *Yìjīng* *Běn Guà* hexagram, line nine, reads: '*No one benefits it, but someone strikes it*,' also opposing *mò* and *huò*." Guō Qìngfān comments: "Jiēzǐ appears in the *Hànshū* *Rénbiǎo* as *Jiézǐ*. *Jiē* and *jié* are interchangeable characters. The *Shǐjì* *Mèngzǐ Xúnqīng Lièzhuàn* *Suǒyǐn* states: '*Jiēzǐ* is the name or title of an ancient writer.'"

Dàgōng Tiáo replied: "The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs—these are things people know. Even those of great wisdom share this knowledge. Yet they cannot articulate the source of their spontaneous transformation—Xuān comments: 'If one were to examine the cause of a single crow or bark, the reason for their natural occurrence, even the wise could not explain the wonder of their self-transformation.' Nor can they fathom what they will do next—Xuān comments: 'Nor can they anticipate the mechanism of what they are about to do.' Dissecting these things—Xuān comments: '*Sī* means to divide. The *Shījīng* states: "*An axe is used to split it*."'—their subtlety reaches the incomparable, their magnitude extends beyond containment. *Jīng* means fine; *lún* means comparison—Xuān comments: 'Even in the cries of tiny creatures, we cannot clarify their reasons, so how can one speak, measure, or conjecture about things so minute they cannot be broken down, so vast they cannot be encompassed?' Agency or non-action, neither escapes entanglement with things, and thus both err in their claims. Agency implies solidity—Chéng comments: 'Adhering to action.'—while non-action implies emptiness—Chéng comments: 'Drowning in causelessness.' Having name and reality, they reside in things—Xuān comments: 'Affirming reality, they remain within the realm of things. This is the error of the *some agency* doctrine.' Having no name and no reality, they dwell in the void of things—Xuān comments: 'Affirming emptiness, they become entirely hollow. This is the error of the *non-action* doctrine.' What can be spoken or conceived only distances one further from the truth. Believing it can be expressed in words or grasped in thought, one only drifts further from the Dao. What has not yet arisen cannot be prevented; things that have not yet come into being cannot be forbidden from arising. What has already died cannot be obstructed—Lu’s *Exegesis* notes: 'The text also reads *cú*.'—for once dead, it cannot be impeded from passing away. Life and death are not distant, yet their principle remains unseen. Life and death lie before us, yet their principle eludes perception. Agency or non-action—these are the pretexts for doubt. The two doctrines serve as the borrowed grounds for later skeptics. Observing their root, their past is boundless; seeking their end, their future knows no limit—Xuān comments: 'To trace their beginning is to find the past without end, its origin unknowable; to trace their end is to find the future without limit, its conclusion unknowable.' Boundless and limitless, speech is also without end, sharing the same principle as things—Guō comments: 'The principle of things is boundless, thus knowing speech is boundless allows one to share the same principle as things.' Agency and non-action are the foundation of speech, ever accompanying things from beginning to end. Whether one speaks of agency or non-action, these two doctrines form the basis of discourse, yet they remain mired in things from start to finish. The Dao cannot be affirmed as existent, nor can existence be affirmed as non-existent—Chéng comments: 'The supreme Dao is unceasing, neither existent nor non-existent. Thus, clinging to existence or non-existence, both are untenable.' The name *Dao* is a borrowed term for its function—Guō comments: 'It is that by which things proceed, hence the borrowed name *Dao*.' Agency or non-action—these are but partial aspects of things. How can they suffice for the great square? If words sufficed, then speaking all day would exhaust the Dao—Guō comments: 'Seeking the Dao beyond words and thoughts, then words suffice.' If words did not suffice, then speaking all day would only exhaust things—Guō comments: 'Unable to forget words and preserve meaning, then words do not suffice.' The utmost of the Dao and things cannot be borne by speech or silence. The extremes of the Dao and things cannot be conveyed by words or silence. Neither speech nor silence—this is the discussion of their limits."

Master Xuan comments: "To seek the Dao beyond speech and silence—this is the ultimate discourse."

**Miscellaneous Chapters: External Things (Chapter Twenty-Six)**

External things cannot be relied upon. Whatever comes from without—its benefits and harms are equally uncertain. Thus, Long Feng was executed, Bi Gan was slain, and Jizi feigned madness—Master Xuan comments: "Goodness cannot be forced." While E Lai died, and Jie and Zhou perished—Master Xuan comments: "Evil cannot be indulged." No ruler fails to desire loyalty from his ministers, yet loyalty does not always earn trust. Thus, Wu Yun was cast into the Yangtze—Master Cheng comments: "He remonstrated with Fuchai, who killed him, flayed his skin to make a bag shaped like an owl, filled it with his corpse, and set it adrift upon the river." Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood preserved for three years before transforming into jade—Master Cheng comments: "Exiled to Shu, he resented his loyalty being slandered and disemboweled himself. The people of Shu, moved by his fate, stored his blood in a casket, and after three years, it turned into jasper." (The *Shiwen* notes: "See the *Lüshi Chunqiu*.") No parent fails to desire filial piety from their children, yet filial piety does not always earn love. Thus, Xiaoji grieved to death, and Zeng Shen lived in sorrow—Master Cheng comments: "Xiaoji, son of Gaozong of Yin, suffered under his stepmother’s cruelty and died of distress. Zeng Shen, the paragon of filial piety, was hated by his parents and often beaten near to death, hence his lamentations." Li comments: "Zeng Shen, though supremely filial, was despised by his father and frequently left to starve before reviving."

When wood rubs against wood, it ignites—Yu comments: "The *Huainanzi’s* *Yuandao Xun* also states: 'When two pieces of wood rub together, they catch fire.' Yet mere wood rubbing seldom ignites. The following line reads 'metal and fire,' suggesting this should also read 'wood and fire.' The subsequent text frequently mentions fire, further confirming this emendation. Since both metal and wood fear fire, the passage uses them to illustrate fire’s great destructive power." When metal and fire are confined together, the metal melts. When yin and yang clash, heaven and earth convulse—*Shiwen* notes: "骇 (*hài*) means 'to stir.'" Master Xuan comments: "骇 means 'to move.'" Then thunder and lightning arise, fire appears in water, and great locust trees are consumed—Sima comments: "Fire in water refers to lightning. 'Consumed' describes how thunderbolts burn great trees." In such times, one faces extreme distress, trapped between two perils with no escape. People, too, suffer extreme distress—benefit and harm are its cause. Harm is indeed harmful, but benefit is also harmful. Thus, one is constantly ensnared, with no escape.

Anxiety and fear yield no success—*Shiwen* notes: "螴蜳 (*chén dūn*), Guo reads as *chén dūn*." Master Cheng comments: "It means 'apprehension and dread.'" (Note: This refers to those who overvalue external things; though anxious and fearful, they achieve nothing.) The heart, suspended between heaven and earth—*Shiwen* notes: "县 (*xuán*) is read as *xuán*."—strains toward external things, extending to the limits of the cosmos. Now soothed, now agitated, now sunk, now mired—Li comments: "睯 (*mǐn*) means 'oppressed.'" As benefit and harm grind against one another, they generate vast fires, just as external things do—Guo comments: "This is due to internal heat." The multitude burns their harmony. All are drowned in benefit and harm, thus scorching the primordial qi of harmony within their hearts.

The moon is no match for fire. The clarity of the human heart is like the moon—how can it withstand such fire? Thus, one collapses, and the Dao is exhausted—*Shiwen* notes: "僓 (*tuí*) is read as *tuí*." Master Xuan comments: "Thus, one crumbles and decays, the heavenly principle perishes, and the vitality of life is extinguished."

Zhuang Zhou was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. (The *Shiwen* notes: "The *Shuo Yuan* records this as the Marquis of Wei.") The Marquis replied: "Very well. When I receive the taxes from my fief, I will lend you three hundred pieces of gold. Will that suffice?" Master Cheng comments: "He meant to wait until year’s end, when he received his subjects’ taxes and tribute from his fief. Items like copper and iron were also called *jin*, not necessarily gold."

Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and changed countenance, saying: "On my way here yesterday, I heard a voice calling from the middle of the road. I looked and saw a crucian carp in the rut of a carriage wheel. I asked it: 'Crucian carp! What are you doing here?' It replied: 'I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you have a dou or sheng of water to keep me alive?' I said: 'Very well. I am about to travel south to visit the kings of Wu and Yue. I will divert the waters of the Western River to welcome you. Will that do?'"—Master Cheng comments: "The Western River refers to the Shu River." The crucian carp flushed with anger and changed countenance, saying: "I have lost my usual element and have nowhere to dwell. A mere dou or sheng of water would suffice to keep me alive, yet you speak of this! You might as well seek me now in the dried-fish market!"

Lord Ren—Li comments: "Ren was the name of a state."—prepared a great hook and thick black line—Sima comments: "A thick black fishing line."—using fifty castrated oxen as bait. *Shiwen* notes: "犗 (*jiè*) means 'castrated ox.'" He crouched on Mount Kuaiji, cast his line into the Eastern Sea, and fished day after day for a year without catching anything. Then, a great fish took the bait, dragging the massive hook down in a plunging dive—*Shiwen* notes: "錎 (*xiàn*), according to the *Zilin*, means 'to sink' like the character 陷." It surged and thrashed, raising white waves like mountains. The sea churned violently, its roar rivaling that of ghosts and spirits, striking terror for a thousand *li*. Guo Qingfan comments: "惮 (*dàn*) denotes overwhelming might. Jia Yi’s *Xian Xian* chapter reads: 'Your Majesty’s awe-inspiring majesty'—the same sense as here."

Here the character *hè* (赫) also denotes fury—both instances refer to the fish. When Master Ren obtained this fish (若 here meaning "this"), he butchered and dried it. From the Zhe River eastward and Cangwu northward—*Zhì* (制) is interchangeable with *Zhè* (淛), the Zhejiang River. The ancient graphs "折" and "制" were used interchangeably. Sima comments: "This refers to present-day Qiantang in Kuaiji." Cangwu is a mountain name in Lingnan. None failed to be sated by this fish.

Thereafter, those of mediocre talent and pedantic persuasion were all astonished and spread the news. *Shiwen* notes: "Li [Yi] says: ‘*Quán* (辁) means ‘one of limited measure.’’ Some versions write *líng* (軨), meaning ‘petty.’ Others write *qīng* (轻), meaning ‘light.’" Now, those who brandish a pole with a thin line, chase after irrigation ditches, and guard minnows and gudgeons—Li [Yi] says: "Both are small fish"—how could they ever catch a great fish? Those who embellish trivial theories to seek high office are equally far from true attainment. Cheng [Xuanying] says: "*Gān* (干) means ‘to seek.’ *Xiàn* (县) means ‘lofty.’ *Lìng* (令) refers to *lìngwèn* (令问), ‘renown.’" Xuan [Ying] says: "*Xiànlìng* (县令) is like a reward standard."

Thus, those who have never heard of the customs of the Ren clan are equally far from being able to navigate the world. The Confucians rob graves in the name of the *Odes* and *Rites*. They seek "poetry and propriety" while plundering ancient tombs. A great Confucian proclaimed in a formal address—*Shiwen* notes: "The superior transmits words to the inferior in a *lú* (胪) address"—"The east is brightening—Master comments: "This refers to sunrise"—how goes the affair?" A lesser Confucian replied: "He had not yet removed his undergarments, and there was a pearl in his mouth. The *Odes* surely say: ‘The green-green wheat grows on the hillside mound. If one did not give in life, why hold a pearl in death?’" Sima comments: "This is a lost *ode* satirizing the dead." They grasped his temples—Cheng [Xuanying] says: "*Jiē* (接) means ‘to seize’"—and his whiskers—*Shiwen* notes: "*Zìlín* says: ‘一指按也’ (*yī zhǐ àn yě*), ‘to press with a finger.’ *Huì* (顪), *xǔhuì* (许秽) *fan*, Master says: ‘The hair beneath the chin.’"—The Confucians used a metal awl to pry open his jaw, carefully separating his cheeks, so as not to damage the pearl in his mouth! Cheng [Xuanying] says: "Tian Heng used benevolence and righteousness to usurp Qi; the Confucians recited the *Odes* and *Rites* to rob graves. From this, we see that the sagely way cannot be relied upon." Su Yu says: "Without the *Odes* and *Rites*, how would such villainy arise? This is one of Zhuangzi’s one-sided arguments, much like saying that Yao and Shun taught the people with benevolence and righteousness, yet it led to people devouring one another, and Tian Heng further used it to steal Qi."

When Lao Laizi’s disciple went out to gather firewood, he encountered Confucius and returned to report: "There is someone over there with a long upper body and a short lower body." Guo [Xiang] says: "Long above and short below."

The man had a hunched back with his ears set far back. Cheng [Xuanying] says: "His shoulders and back were stooped." Sima [Biao] says: "His ears were pushed backward." His gaze seemed to survey the Four Seas. Cheng says: "His gaze was lofty and distant, as if he were governing the world." No one knew whose son he was.

Lao Laizi said: "That is Qiu! Summon him here." Confucius arrived. Lao Laizi said: "Qiu! Shed your bodily self-importance and your display of wisdom. Guo [Xiang] says: 'Bodily self-importance refers to affected conduct; display of wisdom refers to the appearance of intelligence.' Only then can you be a true gentleman."

Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression altered as he asked: "May I advance in my work?" Lao Laizi said: "You cannot bear the harm of this age yet recklessly court calamity for ten thousand generations. *Shiwen* says: '*Ao* is also written as *ao*, both meaning 'reckless.' This refers to Confucius being unable to endure the harm of this age yet arrogantly bequeathing calamity to ten thousand generations. Are you truly so impoverished in spirit? Or is it that your heart has long lacked any reserve, making you a destitute man? Or do your strategies simply not extend this far? Guo Qingfan says: '*Wu qi* should be read as *wu yi* ('or perhaps'). *Wu qi* is a rhetorical turn, as in the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Biographies of Fan Sui and Cai Ze*: 'Or perhaps they say I am too base to be of use?' In *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, *Love of Kindred*: 'Or perhaps they would not take Song even if it were unjust to attack it?' And in the *Strategies of the Warring States*, *Han Strategies*: 'Or perhaps you have abandoned your methods and neglected your petitions?' In all cases, *wu qi* serves as a rhetorical turn, equivalent to modern 'or perhaps.' Is it that your wisdom and strategies do not extend this far?

To take delight in arrogance is a lifelong disgrace, a pursuit only the mediocre might advance in. Guo [Xiang] says: "The mediocre are ordinary people." Su Yu says: "The term *mediocre* also appears in the *Xu Wugui* chapter." Those who make bestowing benevolence their business seek the joy of the multitude and cultivate their own haughtiness—this is what it means to take delight in arrogance, a lifelong disgrace, something only the conduct of ordinary people might attain. They draw one another by name and bind one another in private favor. Yu [Yue] says: "*Yin* should be glossed as 'private.' The *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, *Circular Way* chapter, Gao You’s commentary says: '*Yin* means private.' In the *Wen Xuan*, *Rhapsody on the Red and White Horse*, Li Shan cites the *Guoyu* commentary: '*Yin* means private.' *Binding in private favor* means forming ties through private affection."

Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it would be better to forget both and close off the very grounds for praise. Forgetting both good and evil, sealing off what might be praised, would also halt what might be condemned. This passage also appears in the *On the Equality of Things* chapter, where the last four characters read 'abandon their Way.'

To turn back is to do nothing that is not harmful; to move is to do nothing that is not perverse. Cheng says: "To turn against the nature of things is to do nothing that is not harmful; to disturb the mind is to do nothing that is not perverse."

The sage hesitates before acting, yet each endeavor succeeds. Cheng says: "Hesitation means proceeding unhurriedly. The sage, without preconceived intent, responds to circumstances and acts. In initiating affairs, he is always at ease, never going against the nature of things, so his achievements are always realized." Su Yu says: "*Each* is synonymous with *swiftly*. This means that in acting, he is not rushed, yet success comes quickly."

Why then do you carry this burden of the traces of benevolence and righteousness, only to end in self-importance?"

In the dead of night, Duke Yuan of Song dreamed of a man with disheveled hair peering through the curved eaves of the palace gate. Li’s commentary states: "This was Duke Yuan himself." (Note: Duke Yuan of Song was named Zuo, son of Duke Ping.) The man in the dream said: "I come from the Abyssal Pool of Zailu, a place named for the tortoises that dwell there. I was sent by the Clear River as an emissary to the River Lord, but the fisherman Yu Qiu caught me." Yu’s commentary notes: "In the *Records of Divination by Tortoiseshell*, this name appears as Yu Jū."

Duke Yuan awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said: "This is a spirit tortoise." The Duke asked: "Is there a fisherman named Yu Qiu?" His attendants replied: "There is." The Duke commanded: "Summon Yu Qiu to court." The next day, Yu Qiu appeared. The Duke asked: "What did you catch in your fishing?" Yu Qiu answered: "In my net, I caught a white tortoise, five feet in circumference." The Duke said: "Present this tortoise to me."

When the tortoise arrived, the Duke wavered—first wanting to kill it, then to spare it. His mind unsettled, he consulted the oracle, which declared: "Slaying the tortoise for divination will bring good fortune." Thus, the tortoise was carved open, and in seventy-two drillings, not a single prediction failed. Every divination was accurate.

Confucius remarked: "The spirit tortoise could appear in a dream to Duke Yuan yet could not evade Yu Qiu’s net. It possessed the knowledge to yield seventy-two flawless divinations yet could not escape the calamity of having its entrails carved out. Thus, even knowledge has its limits, and the divine has its shortcomings. Though one may possess supreme wisdom, ten thousand schemers can outmaneuver it." Su Yu comments: "The wisdom of a single being cannot rival the schemes of ten thousand. In the *Mountain Trees* chapter, it is said, 'The worthy are plotted against, the unworthy are deceived'—here, 'plotted against' carries the same meaning as 'schemed against.' Fish fear not the net but the pelican. Those who rely on petty cunning are like fish unaware of the net’s danger."

Discard petty knowledge, and great wisdom becomes clear. Guo’s commentary states: "Petty knowledge is self-serving; great wisdom responds to things as they are." Abandon the pursuit of goodness, and one attains true goodness. Cheng’s commentary explains: "Cast aside the narrow mind of self-importance, and align with the great goodness of nature."

An infant, born without a learned teacher, can still speak—because it dwells among those who can speak. The *Exegesis* notes: "Shi may also be written as shuo." (Note: "Shi" and "shuo" were interchangeable in ancient script.) Xuan comments: "The unlearned possess natural ability."

Zhuangzi said to Huizi, "You say my words are useless." Huizi replied, "Only when one understands uselessness can we speak of use. The earth is neither narrow nor small, yet what people use is only enough to stand upon. If, however, one were to dig away all the earth beyond where the foot rests, down to the Yellow Springs, would it still be of use?" The *Exegesis* notes: "厕 is pronounced *cè*. 垫 means 'to descend' or 'to dig.' 致 means 'to reach'; in some texts, it is written as 至." (Note: This suggests that while the earth is vast and largely unused, if one were to excavate all but the space where the foot stands down to the Yellow Springs, would what remains still be of use?) Huizi said, "It would be useless." Zhuangzi replied, "Thus, the usefulness of the useless is also clear."

Zhuangzi said, "If a person has the ability to wander freely, how could they not wander? If one can find contentment in themselves, what could prevent them from being content? If a person cannot wander freely, how could they wander at all? If one cannot find contentment in themselves, how could they ever be content? Those with the will to flee, the resolve to sever ties, to drift and hide away, to cut themselves off from the world—alas! Are these not the burdens of those lacking perfect wisdom and profound virtue? The path of true wisdom and great virtue is not like this. To stumble and not turn back, to rush forward like wildfire without a glance behind—this is the way of those who cling desperately to worldly engagement. Su Yu notes: 'The phrase *huǒ chí* (fire-driving) also appears in the *Tiandi* chapter.' Though they may serve as ruler and minister to one another, it is merely the way of the times, a temporary alignment. When the age changes, they will no longer hold each other in contempt. Thus, it is said: the perfected person does not linger in their actions. The perfected one moves through this without attachment. Those who exalt the past and belittle the present belong to the current of scholars. Yet if we observe the present age through the lens of the ancient Xiwei clan, who could remain unmoved? If we view today’s world through the pure customs of antiquity, who could remain untroubled within? *Bō* means 'to move.' Only the perfected person can wander through the world without bias, moving with the times without becoming ensnared by them, unlike those who flee or sever ties. They follow others without losing themselves, unlike those who stumble blindly or rush forward like wildfire. They do not learn from the teachings that exalt the past and belittle the present, yet they align with their intent without opposition.

The eyes, when unobstructed, see clearly; the ears, when unobstructed, hear keenly; the nose, when unobstructed, perceives scents. Cheng comments: "颤 refers to pungent and foul odors." The mouth, when unobstructed, tastes sweetness; the heart, when unobstructed, attains wisdom; wisdom, when unobstructed, becomes virtue. (Note: The pronunciation of 知 here is *zhì*.) 彻 means 'to penetrate.' The Dao does not desire obstruction; obstruction leads to choking, and if choking persists without relief, it results in trampling. The Dao is the path all people follow; it does not desire obstruction. Obstruction leads to choking, and if choking is not resolved, it causes reckless behavior and mutual trampling. Guo comments: "跈 means 'to trample.'" Trampling gives rise to manifold harms. Guo comments: "生 means 'to arise.'" Living beings with consciousness rely on breath. Xuan comments: "Breath circulates the qi throughout the body." If it is not balanced, it is not the fault of Heaven. *Yīn* means 'proper.' If it is not proper, it is not Heaven’s error, for Heaven’s endowment of nature is always harmonious. Heaven bores through things day and night without ceasing. Cheng comments: "降 means 'to stop.' The principle of nature bores through all things, from day to night, without pause." Yet people, in contrast, block their own apertures. Cheng comments: "窦 means 'orifices.' The common people, contrary to Heaven’s principle, obstruct their root openings and become mired in stagnation."

The womb has layered chambers. The *Exegesis* notes: "胞 refers to the fetus in the abdomen." Guo comments: "阆 means 'spacious.'" Cheng comments: "The human abdomen is hollow, allowing it to contain the stomach; the stomach is hollow, allowing qi and fluids to circulate." The heart has the freedom of Heaven’s wandering. Xuan comments: "The heart must have space to align with Heaven’s mechanism." If a room has no emptiness, then mistress and daughter-in-law will quarrel. Sima comments: "勃溪 means 'to turn against one another.'" Xuan comments: "勃溪 means 'to be cramped and in conflict.' If a room has no space, then the elder and younger will be cramped and trample one another." If the heart has no freedom of Heaven’s wandering, then the six senses will vie with one another. Xuan comments: "The six senses are the six faculties that carve up one’s nature. Without space for leisure, the six senses take over and usurp one’s nature." The great forests and mountains are beneficial to people, yet even they cannot match the spirit’s capacity. Xuan comments: "If the heart has the freedom of Heaven’s wandering, then within the square inch of the mind, one may roam boundlessly—why seek vast and open places for contentment? Yet people delight in the expansiveness of great forests and mountains, for their minds are cramped and their spirits constrained."

Virtue overflows into fame, and fame overflows into notoriety. Guo Songtao comments: "Virtue overflows because of fame; fame overflows because it is displayed and made known. The *Xunzi*’s *Fuguo* chapter states: 'Reputation is sufficient to expose and roast one.'" Scheming arises from urgency. Guo comments: "誸 means 'urgent.' Only in urgency does one deliberate over plans." Wisdom emerges from conflict. Xuan comments: "Conflict spurs the display of intelligence." Isolation arises from steadfastness. *Chái* means 'to stand alone.' Only with steadfastness can one stand alone without fear. The *Dasheng* chapter states: "Standing alone in the center." Official affairs are settled by the consensus of the many. The affairs of office must be agreed upon by all before they can be decisively carried out. When spring rains come in season, grasses and trees flourish vigorously. (Note: "日" is likely a scribal error for "曰.")

The practice of plowing and weeding thus begins in earnest. Cheng comments: "The *yao* is a kind of plowshare; the *nou* is a hoe." More than half of the grasses and trees that are uprooted and replanted take root anew, yet none know why this is so. *Shiwen* notes: "植 means 'to stand.' Sima comments: 'When uprooted and replanted, they revive—this is called *daozhi*.'" Lu comments: "到 is the ancient form of 倒 (*inverted*)." Cheng comments: "When grasses are uprooted and regrow, it is the season that makes it so. Thus, in establishing laws and teachings, one must follow the proper time."

Stillness can remedy illness. Xuan comments: "In stillness, spirit and qi return, thus it can remedy illness." Pressing and massaging the corners of the eyes can rejuvenate the aged. *Shiwen* notes: "● is also written as 搣." Guo Songtao comments: "The *Guangyun* states: '搣 means to press or rub.' This refers to massaging the corners of the eyes with both hands." Xuan comments: "This is likely a technique of nurturing life, which can bathe and restore an aged countenance." Tranquility can halt haste. Xuan comments: "When one is tranquil and settled, the mind is at ease, and this can halt urgency."

Yet even so, these are but the tasks of the toiling. Xuan comments: "This merely teaches the laboring how to find respite." They are not the concerns that the carefree have ever encountered or inquired after. Xuan comments: "Those who are truly carefree do not engage in such matters." (Note: The character "非" is likely an interpolation.)

The means by which the sage startles the world are matters the spirit-like person has never encountered or inquired after. The sage—such as the Yellow Emperor, Yao, or Shun—and the spirit-like person—such as Guangcheng or Daiwei—operate on different planes. The means by which the worthy startles the age are matters the sage has never encountered or inquired after. Figures like Wuguang and Shentu Di were likely worthy persons. The means by which the noble person startles the state are matters the worthy has never encountered or inquired after. The noble person who startles the state may be akin to Tian Heng and his ilk. The means by which the petty person conforms to the times are matters the noble person has never encountered or inquired after.

At Yanmen, there was one whose parent had died. *Shiwen* notes: "Yanmen was the name of a city gate in Song." He mourned so excessively that he wasted away. For this, he was enfeoffed as an official and master, and the Lord of Song honored his filial conduct. Half of his fellow villagers followed suit, mourning to death. Guo comments: "To feign mourning for reward is far from true virtue—this is the fault of exalting the worthy." *Dang* here refers to one’s village or community.

When Yao offered the world to Xu You, Xu You fled from it. When Tang offered the world to Wuguang, Wuguang grew angry. When Ji Ta heard of this, he led his disciples to crouch by the Kuǎn River. The feudal lords mourned him for three years, and Shentu Di, moved by this, drowned himself in the river. *Shiwen* notes: "踆 is explained in the *Zilin* as the ancient form of 蹲 (*to crouch*). Sima comments: 'Kuǎn is the name of a river.'" Cheng comments: "Fearing he would be implicated, Ji Ta crouched by the water with his disciples. The feudal lords, hearing of this and admiring his integrity, came to offer condolences, fearing he would drown himself. Shentu Di, upon learning of this, emulated his lofty reputation and threw himself into the river."

The fish trap exists for the sake of catching fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten.

The *Shiwen* notes: "荃 (*quan*), Cui reads as *sun*, referring to a fragrant herb used as bait for fish. Some say it means piling firewood in water to attract fish to feed. Another says it is a fish trap." Lu comments: "As some have said, this refers to *qian* (a submerged weir). See the *Zhou Song* in the *Book of Poetry*." Note: Cheng’s edition writes it as 筌 (*quan*). 在 (*zai*) means to capture alive. 蹄 (*ti*) is what traps the hare; once the hare is caught, the trap is forgotten. The *Shiwen* notes: "蹄 is a snare for hares, binding their legs—hence the name." Words exist for the sake of meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. How can I find a man who has forgotten words to speak with him?

**Miscellaneous Chapters: "Parables" (Chapter Twenty-Seven)**
"Parables" make up nineteen out of ten. Xuan comments: "Words lodged in one place, nine out of ten." Note: The meaning lies here, but the words are lodged elsewhere. "Weighted words" make up seven out of ten. Xuan comments: "Cited words of weight, seven out of ten." *Zhiyan* emerge daily. The *Shiwen* notes: "卮 (*zhi*), also written as 巵, pronounced *zhi*. The *Zilüe* says: 'A round wine vessel.' Wang comments: 'A *zhi* vessel tips when full and rights itself when empty, adapting to things rather than clinging to one form. Applied to words, it follows others and changes, having no fixed position of its own.'" Guo comments: "日出 (*ri chu*) means daily renewal." Harmonized with the Heavenly Boundary. Cheng comments: "和 (*he*) means to accord. 天倪 (*tian ni*) is the natural division." Note: It means responding only in accordance with nature. "Parables" (nineteen out of ten) rely on external voices. Guo comments: "Words from oneself are often rejected by the world, so one borrows external voices—like Jianwu and Lianshu." A father does not act as his son’s matchmaker. When a father praises his son, it is not as convincing as when someone else does. Cheng comments: "媒 (*mei*) means to bring together. When a father speaks of his son, few believe him; when another praises him, many do." This is not my fault but the fault of others. It is not that I deliberately act in a disjointed way; rather, others wrongly raise doubts. If something aligns with oneself, one responds; if it does not, one rejects it. What aligns with oneself is deemed right; what differs is deemed wrong. Human nature fixates on agreement and disagreement to determine right and wrong, hence the need for parables. "Weighted words" (seven out of ten): Yao comments: "In Zhuangzi’s writings, nine out of ten are words attributed to others. Among these parables, those attributed to figures like Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Confucius, and Yan Hui—words weighty enough to be revered by the world—make up seven out of ten." This is to silence words. 已 (*yi*) means to stop—to halt the world’s confused and disorderly speech. These are the words of elders. Such are the words of the venerable, and so they are cited. The *Shigu* says: "耆艾 (*qi ai*) means elders." One may be older in years, but without the warp and weft of beginnings and ends to mark one as venerable, this is not true precedence. In handling affairs, the warp and weft matter; in establishing words, beginnings and ends matter. What is valued in elders is not just age but the Dao. If one is merely older in years but lacks the warp and weft of beginnings and ends, how can one be considered truly prior? Su Yu comments: "期 (*qi*) means a limit. To say one has nothing to precede others except age is to use age as a limit. As in the *Yang* chapter: 'Counting the number of things does not stop at ten thousand, yet we set a limit by calling them the ten thousand things,' the word 期 here shares the same meaning." A person who has nothing to precede others lacks the human Dao. Xuan comments: "Cannot fulfill the human Way." A person who lacks the human Dao is called a "worn-out person." Guo comments: "Merely a long-worn person." Xuan comments: "Like a withered old thing." *Zhiyan* emerge daily, harmonized with the Heavenly Boundary, flowing and extending, thus exhausting the years. Following the principles of things and letting them flow and extend, words emerge endlessly, merely to pass the years. As in the *Qiwulun*: "Harmonized with the Heavenly Boundary, flowing and extending, thus exhausting the years." Without words, things are equal. Equality with words is not equality; words with equality are not equality. Thus, it is said: "No words." Su Yu comments: "When there are no words, the Dao is present, and all things are equal. With words, there is correctness and error; equality with words or words with equality can never truly be equal. Hence, it is said: 'Better to have no words.'" Words without words: Guo comments: "Speaking those words, yet for me, they remain no words." Speaking all one’s life, one has never spoken; not speaking all one’s life, one has never not spoken. There is a source from which something may be permissible, and a source from which it may not. There is a source from which something may be so, and a source from which it may not. Guo comments: "自 (*zi*) means *from*. From the bias of self and other, there arises permissibility and impermissibility, so-ness and not-so-ness." How is it so? So in being so. How is it not so? Not so in not being so. How is it permissible? Permissible in being permissible. How is it impermissible? Impermissible in being impermissible. Things inherently have what is so; things inherently have what is permissible. There is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not permissible. The above also appears in the *Qiwulun* chapter. Without *zhiyan* emerging daily, harmonized with the Heavenly Boundary, who could endure for long? Without these wordless words, who could transmit them for long? All things are seeds, succeeding one another with different forms. Xuan comments: "All have their kinds, each with its form succeeding endlessly." Beginning and end are like a ring—none can grasp its principle. Guo comments: "伦 (*lun*) means principle." Note: Like a ring without end, none can grasp its principle. This is called the Heavenly Equality. Heavenly Equality is the Heavenly Boundary. Cheng comments: "均 (*jun*) means equal. This is called the natural equalizing Dao."

"Even the Dao of equalizing equality is also called the natural division."

Note: The *Qiwulun* also states: "Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the Heavenly Equality—this is called the twofold course." Zhuangzi said to Huizi: "Confucius lived sixty years, and in those sixty years, he transformed sixty times. What he initially affirmed, he later negated. Who knows whether what he now calls right is not what he called wrong fifty-nine years ago?" This aligns with the *Zeyang* chapter’s account of Qu Boyu.

Huizi said: "Confucius toils his will and serves knowledge."
Xuan comments: "This suggests Confucius labored his mind and engaged in excessive knowledge, yet had not attained transformation."

Zhuangzi said: "Confucius has already renounced this, though he has not yet spoken of it."
Xuan comments: "This means Confucius had already abandoned the traces of toil and advanced in the Dao, though he had not yet expressed it in words."

Confucius said:
Xuan comments: "Citing Confucius’ refined speech."

“One receives one’s endowment from the Great Root and restores the numinous to live.”
The Great Root is Heaven. Man receives his endowment from Heaven and restores his nature’s numinosity to live.
When he sings in accord with the pitch-pipes, his voice becomes the pitch-pipes. When he speaks in accord with the law, his words become the law for all under Heaven. Though profit and duty lie before him, his likes and dislikes, right and wrong, merely submit to men’s mouths. Yet he enables men to submit in their hearts and dare not stand in opposition, thus establishing the world’s stability.
*Shiwen* notes: “蘁 is pronounced *wu*, meaning ‘to oppose.’”
Commentary: This means it merely submits to men’s mouths. Yet by making men submit in their hearts and dare not oppose, such a one suffices to establish the world’s settled principle.
Thus spoke the Master.
“Enough! Enough! I shall never attain his level!”
Cheng comments: “This is Zhuangzi’s praise of Confucius.”
Yao comments: “The toil of will and service of knowledge—what Confucius taught his disciples—were not what made Confucius Confucius. Thus he ‘renounced this, though he had not yet spoken of it.’ What made Confucius Confucius was the ‘Confucius said’ above. Why? Because the Great Root abides therein. Receiving one’s endowment from the Great Root and restoring goodness to return to one’s life—this is what made Confucius Confucius, nothing more than returning to the Great. As for singing in accord with the pitch-pipes, speaking in accord with the law, and clarifying right and wrong, these are minor virtues. How could they define Confucius?”
This interpretation is also worth considering.

Zengzi took office twice, and his heart transformed twice.
Xuan comments: “Transform means to change.”
He said: “When I served while my parents were alive, three *fu* brought me joy.”
Cheng comments: “Six *dou* and four *sheng* make one *fu*.”
“Later, when I served, three thousand *zhong* did not reach them.”
Cheng comments: “Six *hu* and four *dou* make one *zhong*. *Ji* means ‘to reach.’”
Commentary: He could not reach his parents.
“I grieved in my heart.”
A disciple asked Confucius: “Can one say that Shen here is free from the fault of being bound?”
Guo comments: “Bound means to be tied.”
Xuan comments: “Serving for the sake of one’s parents, his heart was free from the fault of being tied to emolument.”
Confucius said: “He was already bound.”
Xuan comments: “He was already tied to emolument and support.”
“Can one who is free from being bound feel sorrow?”
Cheng comments: “The filial son serving his parents focuses on suitability, regardless of the emolument’s thickness or thinness. He exhausts himself in demeanor and support, hence there are hired laborers who are called filial sons, while three offices still count as unfilial. Since his heart holds sorrow and joy, how can he be free from the fault of being tied to emolument? Only one free from ties should be free from sorrow and joy.”
“To him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* were like watching midges and gnats passing before him.”
“Him” refers to one free from ties.
Yu comments: “The character ‘sparrow’ is superfluous. *Shiwen* states: ‘The Yuanjia edition reads “like storks and midges,” omitting “gnats.”’ Thus, the edition Lu saw did not have the superfluous ‘sparrow,’ for it only mentions the Yuanjia edition lacking ‘gnats,’ not lacking ‘sparrow.’ Yet storks and midges—one bird, one insect—make an incongruous comparison. Wang comments: ‘Storks and midges take large and small as their distinction, to illustrate the disparity between three *fu* and three thousand *zhong*.’ But the perfected man’s view of things is but a sip—how could he be concerned with the disparity between three *fu* and three thousand *zhong*, or distinguish between storks and midges? *Shiwen* further notes: ‘Storks were originally written as “watching.”’ I suspect the ancient text read: ‘To him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* were like watching midges and gnats pass before him.’ The *Huainanzi*’s *Chuzhen* chapter states: ‘Praise and blame to oneself are like a midge or gnat’s passing.’ The meaning is the same. When ‘watching’ was mistaken for ‘stork,’ the three characters ‘stork, midge, gnat’ became incongruous, leading the Yuanjia edition to delete one ‘gnat’ to balance ‘stork’ and ‘midge,’ and the present edition to add one ‘sparrow’ to balance ‘stork, sparrow’ with ‘midge, gnat.’ Neither preserves Zhuangzi’s original text.”

Yan Chengzi You said to Dongguo Ziqi, “As Cheng explains: ‘He lived east of the outer wall, hence called Dongguo, the same as Nan Guo Ziqi in the *Equalizing Things* chapter.’ Since I heard your words, after one year I became rustic—Cheng explains: ‘Rustic means unadorned. After hearing the Dao for a year, with the heart’s learning not yet mature, one can only gradually shed superficiality and return to plainness.’ After two years I followed—Cheng explains: ‘Accorded with the common.’ After three years I penetrated—Cheng explains: ‘No longer stagnated by circumstances.’ After four years I became one with things—Cheng explains: ‘Merged with things.’ After five years they came to me—Cheng explains: ‘Drew the multitude to return.’ After six years spirits entered—Cheng explains: ‘Spirit met the pattern of things.’ After seven years Heaven was complete—Cheng explains: ‘Accorded with natural completion.’ After eight years I knew not death, knew not life—Cheng explains: ‘Unaware of the distinction between life and death, gathering and dispersal.’ After nine years I attained the great mystery—Cheng explains: ‘Mystery means subtlety. Knowing and illumination were vast and broad, hence called great.’

Life with deliberate action is death. Guo explains: ‘To live with deliberate action is to lose one’s life.’ He admonished the duke, saying: ‘As in the following two lines.’ Because death has its source—Guo explains: ‘Source means cause. Death comes from deliberate action; deliberate action comes from prizing one’s life.’ But life as yang has no source—Xuan explains: ‘Death is yin, life is yang.’ Guo explains: ‘Life as yang arises from leaving no trace and acting without deliberate effort; it has no cause.’ Could you truly do so? *Er*, you. Could you truly act without deliberate effort? Where would you find what suits you? Where would you find what does not suit you?—Cheng explains: ‘Everywhere is suitable.’ Heaven has its celestial reckoning, qi and number have their fixed order. Earth has its human claims, each claiming its place. Where should I seek it?—Cheng explains: ‘Where should I seek it beyond what is already here?’ If we know not its end, how can we say there is no fate?—Cheng explains: ‘As time comes and fortune goes, how could it not be fate! This means there is fate.’ If we know not its beginning, how can we say there is fate?—Cheng explains: ‘Life and death, coming and going, are like spring, autumn, winter, and summer—could this be fate? This means there is no fate.’ If there is a response, how can we say there are no spirits?—Guo explains: ‘Pattern must have a response, as if spirits brought it about.’ If there is no response, how can we say there are spirits?’ The principle of response sometimes fails to manifest.

The multitude of *wangliang* asked the shadow, ‘The faint yin beyond the shadow is manifold, hence called the multitude of *wangliang*. “Earlier you were bent, now you are upright—*ruo*, you. Earlier your hair was bound, now it is loose—bound means tied up. Earlier you sat, now you stand. Earlier you walked, now you stop. Why?” The shadow said: “So trifling!—*Sousou* is also written as *sou*. Cheng explains: ‘*Sousou* describes effortless movement.’ Why do you hastily ask? I have it but know not why. Though I clearly have it, I know not how it comes to be. I am like the cicada’s shell, the snake’s slough—seemingly so but not so. Xuan explains: ‘Shell and slough still have a fixed form, hence seemingly so but not so.’”

Fire and sun, I gather—*Tun* means to assemble. Xuan explains: ‘With fire and sun, I assemble and become visible.’ Yin and night, I alternate—Sima explains: ‘Alternate means to allow rest.’ That—referring to form—is what I depend on? How much more so for those who depend on what they depend on!—Referring to form depending on Heaven’s mechanism to move. The *Equalizing Things* chapter says: ‘What I depend on also depends on something else to be so?’ When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it; when it is vigorously yang, I am vigorously yang with it—Xuan explains: ‘Vigorously yang means vigorous movement.’ As for the vigorously yang, what question could there be?’ *You* here means the *you* in ‘I have it’ above. How could the vigorously moving ask about me!’

Yang Ziju went south to Pei—*Liezi*’s *Yellow Emperor* chapter has Yang Zhu. Lao Dan traveled west to Qin and was invited at the outskirts—*Yao* means to invite. Xuan explains: ‘Ziju invited Laozi at the outskirts of Pei.’ Arriving at Liang, he met Laozi. Xuan explains: ‘Liang is a place name in the outskirts of Pei.’ Midway, Laozi looked up to heaven and sighed: “At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.” Yang Ziju did not reply. Upon reaching the lodging, he brought water for washing, rinsing, towel, and comb—*Huangdi* chapter has *guan* for *guan*. He removed his shoes outside the door and advanced on his knees, saying: “Earlier your disciple wished to ask you, Master, but you were occupied on the road, so I dared not. Now you are at leisure; may I ask what my fault is?” Laozi said: “Your haughty and overbearing demeanor—Guo explains: ‘Arrogant in appearance. People will fear and distance themselves from you.’ Who would dwell with you? Who would live with you? The greatest whiteness seems sullied, the fullest virtue seems insufficient.” Sullied means stained. This is a passage from the *Daodejing*. Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: “I respectfully receive your instruction.”

When he had gone before, the innkeeper’s family welcomed him—Zhang Zhan’s note: ‘The innkeeper’s family.’ The master of the house held the mat, his wife held the towel and comb, and the innkeeper left his seat—Cheng explains: ‘Those who had been seated left their seats and departed.’”

The fire-tender avoided the stove—Cheng explains: “One who kindles the fire dared not occupy the stove.” On his return, the innkeeper’s family now vied with him for seats—Guo explains: “Because he had shed his arrogance.”

*Zhuangzi Jijie*, Scroll Eight
Miscellaneous Chapters: "Yielding the Throne," Chapter Twenty-Eight

The four chapters of "Yielding the Throne" below are widely regarded by ancient and modern scholars as spurious.

Yao offered the empire to Xu You, but Xu You declined. He also offered it to Zizhou Zhipu—Li explains: “Zhipu was his courtesy name; he was also called Zhibo.” Zizhou Zhipu said: “That you would make me Son of Heaven is acceptable. Nevertheless, I happen to suffer from a deep-seated affliction—Wang explains: “His illness is profound and entrenched.” I am just now treating it and have no leisure to govern the empire.” The empire is the weightiest of burdens, yet he would not let it harm his life—how much less would he allow other things to do so! Only one who takes no account of the empire can be entrusted with it.

Shun offered the empire to Zizhou Zhibo, and Zizhou Zhibo said: “I happen to suffer from a deep-seated affliction and am just now treating it; I have no leisure to govern the empire.” Thus, the empire is a great vessel, yet one does not exchange life for it—this is how those who embody the Dao differ from the common world.

Shun offered the empire to Shan Juan, and Shan Juan said: “I stand in the midst of the cosmos: in winter I wear furs, in summer I wear coarse or fine linen; in spring I plow and sow, and my body is sufficient for labor; in autumn I reap and gather, and my person is sufficient for rest.”

With the sun’s rise, I labor; with the sun’s setting, I rest—roaming free between heaven and earth, my heart content. Why should I take the empire? Alas! You do not understand me at all!

Thus he declined. Then he departed and entered the deep mountains, and none knew his whereabouts.

Shun offered the empire to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer of Shihu said: “How earnest and diligent is this man! A true preserver of strength.” (The character *hu* is also written as *hou*.) This *hou* then spoke of himself, saying: “I toil earnestly and laboriously—such is the man who preserves his strength. I have no leisure to govern the empire.” He deemed Shun’s virtue insufficient, so he shouldered his wife and carried his child on his head, entering the sea and never returning.

King Tai of Danfu dwelt in Bin, and the Di tribes attacked him. He offered them furs and silks, but they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, but they refused; he offered them pearls and jade, but they refused—the Di sought only land. King Tai of Danfu said: “To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—this I cannot bear. Go, all of you, and dwell here! What difference is there between serving me and serving the Di?” Moreover, I have heard that one must not harm what is nurtured by what is used for nurturing. (What is used for nurturing is land; what is nurtured is the people.) So he took up his staff and departed. The people followed him in droves, and he established a state at the foot of Mount Qi. King Tai of Danfu could indeed be called one who honored life, valuing life above all. Those who honor life, though noble and wealthy, do not harm their bodies with excess; though poor and lowly, they do not burden their forms with profit. Those with means do not injure themselves with indulgence, and those without profit do not weary their forms in pursuit of wealth. Yet the people of this age, who hold high office and exalted rank, all fear losing them and cling to them dearly. Seeing profit, they lightly risk their lives—how deluded they are!

The people of Yue assassinated their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, fearing this fate, fled into the cinnabar caves. (Li: “Sou is the prince’s name.” *Huainanzi* writes it as *Yi*. The *Erya* says: “The southern region where the sun shines is called the cinnabar caves.” Cheng: “The cinnabar caves are caverns in the southern mountains.” Yu: “There is no record of three generations of regicide before Yi. The *Shiji*’s *Yue Shijia* *Suoyin* identifies Sou as the son of Yi, Wuzhuan. According to the *Bamboo Annals*, Yi was assassinated by his son, the people of Yue killed his son and enthroned Wuyu, who was also assassinated and succeeded by Wuzhuan. Thus, Wuzhuan’s three predecessors all met violent ends, so Prince Sou is undoubtedly another name for Wuzhuan. The *Huainanzi*’s account is likely a mishearing and should be corrected according to the *Suoyin*.”) As Yue had no ruler, they sought Prince Sou but could not find him, so they followed him to the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people of Yue smoked him out with mugwort and bore him away in the royal carriage. Prince Sou grasped the carriage strap to mount it, then looked up to heaven and cried: “Rulership! Rulership! Can you not spare me even this?” Prince Sou did not hate being a ruler—he hated the calamity that comes with rulership. Such a man could truly be called one who does not harm his life for the sake of the state. This is precisely what the people of Yue desired in a ruler.

Han and Wei contended over disputed territory. Zihua Zi visited Marquis Zhao of Han, who wore a troubled expression. (Sima: “Zihua Zi was a man of Wei. Zhao was the marquis of Han.” Yu: “The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Guisheng* chapter quotes Zihua Zi: ‘Preserving life is supreme; impairing life is secondary; death is next; coerced life is worst.’ The *Wutu* chapter also quotes Zihua Zi: ‘Kings delight in what makes them kings; the ruined delight in what ruins them.’ Gao’s commentary on both calls Zihua Zi ‘an ancient Daoist.’ The *Zhidu* and *Shenwei* chapters’ commentaries concur. Han had a Marquis Zhao and a King Xi, but no Marquis Zhao-Xi.”) Zihua Zi said: “Suppose the world inscribed a decree before you, saying: ‘If you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be maimed; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be maimed. Yet whoever seizes it will gain the world.’ Would you seize it?” (Cheng: “The decree is a written record.” Sima: “Maimed means injured.” Another interpretation: “Seizing refers to grasping the decree; maimed means severing the right hand.”) Marquis Zhao said: “I would not seize it.” Zihua Zi said: “Excellent! From this we see that your two arms are weightier than the world, and your body is weightier than your two arms. Han’s value is far lighter than the world, and what you now contend over is far lighter than Han. Yet you grieve over harming your life and body for such trivial gains!” (He grieved over not obtaining them.) The marquis said: “Well said! Many have instructed me, but I have never heard such words before.” Zihua Zi could indeed be called one who understood the weight of things. (The character *Zhao* is missing before *Xi*.)

The lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao, so he sent an envoy with gifts to precede him. Yan He dwelt in a humble lane, wearing a coarse hempen robe and feeding his own oxen. The lord of Lu’s envoy arrived, and Yan He personally received him. The envoy asked: “Is this Yan He’s home?” Yan He replied: “This is He’s home.”

The envoy presented the gifts, and Yan He said: “I fear the listener may have misunderstood, thereby bringing blame upon the envoy—it would be better to verify.” (Yu Yue notes: “The character *zhe* below *ting* is superfluous; it does not appear in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s ‘Valuing Life’ chapter.) The envoy returned and re-examined the matter, then came back to seek him, but Yan He had already departed. Thus, one like Yan He truly detested wealth and honor.

Therefore it is said: The essence of the Dao is for cultivating the self; its surplus threads may be used to govern the state; its dregs and chaff may be applied to ordering the world. (Sima Biao notes: “*Tu zha* refers to things like manure and straw.”) From this perspective, the achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover affairs of sages—never the means to perfect the self or nurture life.

Yet the gentlemen of this vulgar age often cast aside their lives and abandon their well-being to pursue external things—is this not lamentable? Whenever sages act, they must examine their intended direction and their underlying purpose. (Wang Niansun notes: “‘Intended direction’ refers to the realm where virtue is applied; ‘underlying purpose’ refers to how they engage with things.”)

Now suppose there were a man here who used a Marquis Sui’s pearl to shoot at a sparrow a thousand *ren* high—surely the world would ridicule him. Why? Because what he employed was weighty, while what he sought was trivial.

For life—how could its value be merely that of a Marquis Sui’s pearl? (Yu Yue notes: “In the *Noble Life* chapter, the character *pearl* follows *Marquis*; it should be added here.”) Master Liezi was impoverished, his countenance bearing the hue of hunger. A guest spoke of this to Ziyang of Zheng, saying: “Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao—a scholar of worth. That he dwells in your state yet suffers want—might this not suggest you hold scholars in low regard?” (The *Exegesis* notes: “Ziyang was the chief minister of Zheng.”) Ziyang of Zheng promptly ordered an official to send him grain. (Cheng Xuanying comments: “The official in charge of the granary.”) When Master Liezi saw the messenger, he bowed twice and declined. After the messenger departed, Liezi entered his home, where his wife, gazing at him, struck her breast and said: “I have heard that the wives and children of those who follow the Dao all live in ease and joy. Yet here you are, starving. The lord, recognizing his oversight, sent you food—an act of kindness from one who heeded his minister’s counsel. That you refuse it—is this not a matter of fate?” Master Liezi smiled and replied: “The lord does not know me of his own accord. He sent me grain on another’s word, and should he condemn me, it would likewise be on another’s word. This is why I did not accept.” In the end, the people indeed rose in revolt and killed Ziyang. (Yu Yue notes: “The affair of Ziyang is recorded in the *Appropriate Might* chapter of the *Lüshi Chunqiu* and the *Fanlun Xun* of the *Huainanzi*. In the *Records of the Historian*, the *Hereditary House of Zheng* states: ‘In the twenty-fifth year of Duke Ru, the Duke of Zheng killed his chief minister Ziyang. In the twenty-seventh year, Ziyang’s faction jointly assassinated Duke Ru the Feeble,’ which differs from the accounts in other texts.”)

When King Zhao of Chu lost his state, the butcher Yue fled alongside him. After King Zhao regained his kingdom, he sought to reward those who had followed him, including the butcher Yue. The butcher Yue said: “When Your Majesty lost your kingdom, I lost my butcher’s trade. Now that Your Majesty has regained your kingdom, I have likewise regained my butcher’s trade. My rank and emolument have been restored—what reward is there to speak of?” The king said: “Insist!” And so he compelled him to accept the reward.

The butcher Yue said: “When Your Majesty lost your kingdom, it was not this subject’s fault, and so I dared not submit to punishment. Now that Your Majesty has regained your kingdom, it is not this subject’s merit, and so I dare not accept reward.” The king said: “Summon him!” The butcher Yue replied: “By the laws of Chu, only those who have rendered great merit through heavy reward may be granted an audience. Now, my wisdom was insufficient to preserve the kingdom, and my courage was insufficient to die resisting the enemy. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled in fear of danger and avoided the foe—not that I deliberately followed Your Majesty. If Your Majesty now wishes to set aside the law and break the covenant to grant me an audience, this is not what I would wish to be heard of throughout the world.”

The king said to Marshal Ziqí: “Though the butcher Yue dwells in lowly and humble circumstances, his exposition of principle is most lofty. Ziqí, extend to him the position of the Three Standards.” *Exegesis*: “The Three Standards refer to the rank of the Three Dukes. The *Records of the Marshal* reads ‘Three Jade-Tablets,’ explaining: ‘This refers to the three ministers of the feudal lords, each of whom holds a tablet.’” Xuan [Yun] comments: “Carriages and robes each have their distinguishing standards, hence the term ‘Three Standards.’” Yu [Yue] comments: “‘Qí’ is a superfluous character.” *Note*: “Qí” may have been mistakenly written for “qí” (其).

The butcher Yue said: “The position of the Three Standards—I know it is nobler than my butcher’s stall. The emolument of ten thousand bushels—I know it is richer than the profits of my butcher’s trade. Yet how could I accept rank and salary and thereby cause my lord to bear the reputation of reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.” Thus he refused to accept.

Yuan Xian dwelled in Lu, in a wattle hut with walls no more than a fathom square, thatched with living grass. *Exegesis*: “Covering a house with grass is called thatching.” Its door of woven mugwort was incomplete, its hinge made of mulberry wood, and its window a broken urn. *Exegesis*: “The door’s pivot was made of bent mulberry branches; the window was fashioned from a shattered urn.” It had two rooms. *Exegesis*: “One for husband, one for wife.” He stuffed the gaps with coarse cloth. *Exegesis*: “He used a hempen garment to block the window.” Rain leaked through above, and damp seeped below; yet he sat upright and played his zither. *Exegesis*: “Kuāng means ‘upright.’” *Exegesis*: “Xián refers to playing and singing.”

Zigong arrived in a grand carriage, his inner robe dark blue and his outer robe white. *Exegesis*: “The inner garment was dark blue; the outer robe was white.” His high-wheeled chariot could not pass through the lane, so he went on foot to see Yuan Xian. Yuan Xian wore a hat of birch-bark and slippers without heels. *Exegesis*: “The hat was made from the bark of a birch-like tree.” Guo Qingfan comments: “The *Rhapsody on the Shanglin Park* speaks of ‘birch and maple, *ping* and *lu*.’ Zhang Yi explains: ‘*Hua* refers to bark that can be made into rope,’ meaning the tree of heaven. The *Shuowen* states: ‘The tree of heaven is a kind of wood; its bark is used to wrap pine resin. It is pronounced like *hua*.’ Li [Xun] comments: ‘Slippers without heels.’ The *Three Cang*’s *Exegesis* writes *xǐ* as *sǐ*, explaining: ‘To tread.’ The *Shenglei* sometimes writes it as *xǐ*. The *Tongsuwen* states: ‘Shoes without heels are called *xǐ*.’” He leaned on a staff of bramble and answered at the gate.

Zigong exclaimed: “Alas!”

"Master, what ails you?"

Yuan Xian answered: "I have heard it said: 'To lack wealth is called poverty; to study yet be unable to practice is called affliction.' Now I am poor, not afflicted."

Zigong hesitated, his face flushed with shame.

Yuan Xian laughed and said: "To act in hope of worldly recognition—*Exegesis*: 'To hope is to long for. One’s conduct is always swayed by the world’s praise.'—to curry favor and make friends, to study for the sake of others, to teach for one’s own sake—*Exegesis*: 'One ought to study for oneself and teach for others; now it is the reverse.'—to feign benevolence and righteousness—*Exegesis*: 'To rely on benevolence and righteousness for wickedness.'—and to adorn oneself with carriages and horses, these are things I cannot bear to do."

When Master Zeng lived in Wei, his quilted robe had no outer layer, and his complexion was rough and swollen—*Exegesis*: "Rough and swollen, chapped and cracked." Guo Qingfan comments: "Perhaps *kuài* should read *guì*, meaning gravely ill."—his hands and feet were calloused. For three days he did not kindle a fire; for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its cord snapped; when he grasped his lapel, his elbow showed; when he put on his shoes, their heels split. Yet he dragged his heelless slippers and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth, resonant as metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject, nor could the feudal lords befriend him.

Thus, those who cultivate the will forget the body; *Exegesis*: "The worthy and the noble do not let the body thwart the will." Those who cultivate the body forget profit; *Exegesis*: "Those who nurture life do not let profit harm their well-being." Those who attain the Dao forget the mind. *Exegesis*: "Those who attain the Dao forget the art of knowing."

Confucius said to Yan Hui: "Come back!"

"Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not seek office?"

Yan Hui replied, "I do not wish to. Beyond the outer wall, I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide congee; *Exegesis*: "Some versions write this as *zhān*; the *Guangya* says, 'It means gruel.'" within the inner wall, ten *mu* of fields, enough to yield silk and hemp. Playing the zither suffices for my amusement; what I have learned of the Master’s Dao suffices for my joy. I do not wish to seek office."

Confucius’s expression changed solemnly as he said, "Excellent is Hui’s intent! I have heard it said: 'Those who know contentment do not burden themselves with profit; those who are secure in self-possession do not fear its loss—*that* is what is meant by profit. Those whose conduct is cultivated within feel no shame without rank.' I have recited these words for a long time, but only now, in Hui, do I see them realized. This is my good fortune." *Exegesis*: "He rejoiced in having found such a person."

The Duke Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi, *Exegesis*: "A prince of Wei, enfeoffed at Zhongshan, named Mou." *Exegesis*: "Zhanzi was a worthy man; the *Huainanzi* writes this as *Zhan*." "Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart lingers beneath the palace gates—*Exegesis*: "The *Huainanzi* writes this as *guī*. The Sima edition is the same, reading *guī* as *wei*. It refers to the towering gates of the palace, the entrance to the lord’s residence." *Exegesis*: "Xu Shen says, 'The two watchtowers of the Son of Heaven.'"—what is to be done?"

Zhanzi said, "Value life. When life is valued, profit becomes light."

*Exegesis*: "To value life is to honor it."

The Duke Mou of Zhongshan said, "Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself."

Zhanzi said, "If you cannot overcome yourself, then yield—why should the spirit resent it? *Exegesis*: "'If you cannot overcome your desires, then follow your heart’s inclinations; this does not trouble the spirit with needless aversion.'" *Exegesis*: "Yu Yue says, 'The phrase should end at *yield*. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s 'Shen Wei' chapter reads, 'If you cannot overcome yourself, then indulge it'; the *Wenzi*’s 'Xia De' chapter and the *Huainanzi*’s 'Dao Ying' chapter both read 'yield to it,' and the repetition of 'yield to it' makes clear that 'yield' and 'spirit' should not be read together.'"

"One who cannot overcome himself yet forcibly resists yielding—this is called double injury. A doubly injured person does not belong among the long-lived." *Exegesis*: "Read *chong* as in 'repeated.'" *Exegesis*: "Double injury means a second wound. If you cannot overcome yourself, you are already injured; to forcibly restrain yourself from yielding is to wound yourself again. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s commentary says, 'Read *chong* as in "repeated injury."' This is correct; the *Exegesis* is mistaken."

The Lord of Wei Mou was a prince of a state with ten thousand chariots; when he withdrew to caves and mountain hollows, it was harder for him than for a common scholar. Though he had not yet attained the Dao, he could be said to have grasped its intent.

Confucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food, subsisting on a broth of pigweed without a grain of rice. His complexion was utterly spent, yet he still plucked his zither and sang within his chamber. As Yan Hui sorted vegetables, Zilu and Zigong said to each other, “Our Master was twice driven from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, reduced to destitution in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai. Whoever kills him incurs no guilt; whoever tramples him meets no prohibition. Yet he strums and sings, never ceasing his music—does a noble man show such shamelessness?”

Yan Hui had no reply. He entered and told Confucius, who pushed aside his zither and sighed deeply, saying, “You and Ci are petty men. Summon them—I will speak to them.”

Zilu and Zigong entered. Zilu said, “This may be called destitution.” Confucius replied, “What words are these! The noble man who is at one with the Dao is called ‘at one’; he who is cut off from the Dao is called ‘destitute.’ Now I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, yet encounter the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, when I look within, I am not cut off from the Dao; when I face adversity, I do not lose my virtue. When the cold arrives and the frost and dew descend, I thereby know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai—are they not a blessing for me?”

Confucius then crisply returned to his zither and played and sang. Zilu, roused, took up his shield and danced. Zigong said, “I knew not the height of heaven nor the depth of earth.” The ancients who attained the Dao found joy in both adversity and success. What they rejoiced in was not adversity or success, but the Dao’s presence in this: then adversity and success became as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain.

Thus Xu You found delight by the Ying River, and Gong Bo found fulfillment at Gongshou. Shun offered the empire to his friend Beiren Wuze, who said, “How strange the lord of men! Dwelling amid the fields, yet wandering at Yao’s gate. Not content with this alone—he would further smear me with his shameful conduct. I am ashamed to see him.” Thereupon he cast himself into the Qingling Abyss.

When Tang was about to attack Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said, “This is not my affair.” Tang asked, “Who is suitable?” He replied, “I do not know.” Tang then consulted Mao Guang, who said, “This is not my affair.” Tang asked, “Who is suitable?” He replied, “I do not know.” Tang said, “What of Yi Yin?” Mao Guang answered, “He is strong and enduring, patient of disgrace—I know nothing else of him.” Tang then plotted with Yi Yin to attack Jie and overthrew him, offering the throne to Bian Sui. Bian Sui declined, saying, “When the lord plotted against Jie, he consulted me—he must have thought me a villain. When he overthrew Jie and offered the throne to me, he must have thought me greedy. I was born in a disordered age, and a man without the Dao has twice come to smear me with his shameful conduct. I cannot bear to hear it again.” He then cast himself into the Zhou River and died.

Tang further offered the throne to Mao Guang, saying, “The wise plan, the valiant execute, the benevolent occupy—this is the ancient Way. Why do you not take your place?” Mao Guang declined, saying, “To depose one’s superior is not righteous; to kill the people is not benevolent; others face the peril while I enjoy the gain—this is not integrity. I have heard it said: ‘One who does not act righteously does not accept its emoluments; in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its soil.’ How much less would I accept elevation! I cannot bear to see this any longer.”

He then strapped a stone to his back and drowned himself in the Lu River.

In former times, when the Zhou arose, there were two knights dwelling in Guzhu named Boyi and Shuqi. The two conferred, saying, “We have heard that in the west there is a man who seems to possess the Dao. Let us go and observe him.” When they reached Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them, making a covenant: “I shall raise your rank by two grades and appoint you to the first rank of office.” They slew an animal and buried it as an oath. The two looked at each other and laughed, saying, “Alas! How strange! This is not what we call the Dao. In the days when Shennong ruled the world, sacrifices were performed with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessing. In his dealings with others, loyalty and trust were fully practiced without seeking anything in return. He delighted in governance and so governed; he delighted in order and so brought order—without using others’ ruin to build himself up, without using others’ lowliness to exalt himself, without exploiting the times for personal gain. Now the Zhou, seeing the disorder of Yin, has hastily seized power. They scheme above and traffic in bribes below, rely on arms to maintain their might, slaughter animals to swear oaths as pledges of trust, parade their conduct to please the masses, and resort to killing and warfare to seize advantage. This is but replacing one chaos with another. We have heard that in ancient times, a knight in an age of order did not shirk his duty, while in an age of disorder, he did not cling to mere survival. Now the world is benighted and Zhou’s virtue has declined. Rather than cling to Zhou and sully ourselves, it is better to avoid them and keep our conduct pure.” The two brothers then traveled north to Mount Shouyang, where they starved to death.

As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and honor, if they could be avoided, they would surely not rely on them. Upholding lofty integrity and defiant conduct, they alone delighted in their own resolve and refused to serve the world. Such was the integrity of these two knights.

Confucius and Liuxia Ji were friends.

Liuxia Ji’s younger brother was named Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi led a band of nine thousand men, rampaging across the world and assaulting the feudal lords. *Li Qi’s annotation to the* Han History *states: “Zhi was a great robber of Qin.”* Yu [Yue] comments: “*The* Correct Meaning *to the* Records of the Historian’s *‘Biography of Boyi’* states: ‘Zhi was the name of a great robber in the time of the Yellow Emperor.’ Thus, there is no definitive account of when Zhi lived. Confucius and Liuxia Hui were not contemporaries, nor were Liuxia Hui and Robber Zhi. Readers should not mistake allegory for fact.”* They broke into chambers and smashed door pivots, drove off people’s oxen and horses, and seized their wives and daughters. Greed made them forget their kin; they paid no heed to parents or brothers and did not sacrifice to their ancestors. Wherever they passed, great states manned their walls, and small states took refuge in their forts. *The* Ritual Records *Zheng [Xuan] annotation states: “A small fortified city is called a fort.”* The common people suffered greatly.

Confucius said to Liuxia Ji, “As a father, one must surely instruct his son; as an elder brother, one must surely teach his younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your younger brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge upon the world, and you cannot teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and persuade him on your behalf.”

Liuxia Ji replied, “You say, ‘As a father, one must surely instruct his son; as an elder brother, one must surely teach his younger brother.’ But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, what can even your eloquence do? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind surges like a spring, his intentions gust like the wind. His strength is sufficient to repel enemies, and his eloquence is sufficient to gloss over wrongs. He is pleased when his heart is followed and enraged when it is opposed. He is quick to insult others with words. You must not go.”

Confucius did not listen. Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong stood to the right as they went to see Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was just then resting his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tai, mincing human liver for his afternoon meal. *The* Exegesis *states: “*Bu*, according to the* Character Forest*, refers to eating at the hour of* shen *(3–5 p.m.).”*

Confucius alighted from the carriage and stepped forward. He said to the usher, “I am Kong Qiu of Lu. Having heard of the general’s lofty virtue, I respectfully bow twice to the usher.” The usher went in to announce him. When Robber Zhi heard this, he flew into a great rage. His eyes blazed like stars, and his hair bristled so that it lifted his cap. He said, “Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kong Qiu of Lu? Tell him this: ‘You fabricate words and concoct phrases, falsely invoking Kings Wen and Wu. *That is, you claim to model yourself on Kings Wen and Wu.* You wear a cap like the branches of a tree—*Sima [Biao] comments: “The cap is excessively ornate, like the branches of a tree.”*—and gird yourself with the flanks of a dead ox—*Sima [Biao] comments: “He takes oxhide to make a large leather belt.”*—spouting a torrent of specious arguments. You eat without plowing, clothe yourself without weaving, flap your lips and wag your tongue to stir up right and wrong, deluding the rulers of the world and causing its scholars to abandon their roots. You recklessly perform filial piety and brotherly duty, hoping to attain enfeoffment and wealth. Your crimes are vast and your punishment severe.’ *Yu [Yue] comments: “*Ji *should be* ji *(‘to punish’). The* Explanation of Terms *states: “*Ji*: to execute.” That is, his crimes are great and his punishment severe. *Ji *and* ji *were interchangeable in ancient script. The* Exegesis *to the* Book of Documents’ *“Great Plan,” “Numerous Officers,”* Zuo’s *commentary to the twenty-eighth year of Duke Xi, and the seventh year of Duke Zhao all state: “*Ji *was originally written* ji. *”*—Be gone at once! If not, I shall add your liver to today’s afternoon meal!’”

Confucius again addressed the messenger: “I have been fortunate enough to gain the favor of Ji. I would be content merely to gaze upon his threshold.” *Explanation of Text* notes: “Sima’s edition has *qi* instead of *mu* (‘threshold’), glossing it: ‘He dares not look upon Zhi’s face but only upon the knots of his sandals before turning away.’” The attendant relayed this message, and Robber Zhi said: “Bring him forward!” Confucius hastened forward, then retreated from his mat and withdrew, bowing twice to Robber Zhi.

Robber Zhi flew into a rage, stretching out his legs, pressing his sword, glaring with eyes like a tiger’s, and roaring like a nursing tigress: “Come forward, Qiu! If your words please me, you shall live; if they offend me, you shall die.”

Confucius replied: “I have heard that in the world there are three kinds of *power*: to be born and grow tall, surpassingly handsome and peerless, so that young and old, high and low all delight in seeing you—this is the highest *power*; to comprehend the workings of Heaven and Earth and to discern the nature of all things—this is the middle *power*; *Explanation of Text* notes: “*Zhi* (‘to know’) is read as *zhi* (‘wisdom’).” to be brave, fierce, resolute, and daring, able to gather multitudes and lead armies—this is the lowest *power*. Anyone possessing even one of these is fit to face south and style himself a lord. Now, General, you possess all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiant, your lips bright as cinnabar—*Sima* comments: “Shining.”—your teeth even as aligned shells, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell. Yet you are called Robber Zhi. I humbly feel shame on your behalf for not claiming what is yours.

If you are willing to heed me, I shall journey south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, and west to Jin and Chu, to have built for you a great city of several hundred *li*, establishing a domain of hundreds of thousands of households. I shall exalt you as a feudal lord, renewing your standing in the world, disbanding your troops, resting your soldiers, gathering and nurturing your brothers, and together offering sacrifices to your ancestors.” *Gong* is read as *gong* (“to provide”). “This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, the very desire of all under Heaven.”

Robber Zhi flew into a rage and said: “Come forward, Qiu! Those who can be swayed by profit and admonished by words are but the foolish and base common folk. As for my tall stature and fine appearance, which delight all who see them—these are the legacy of my father and mother’s virtue. Though you do not praise me, do I not know myself? Moreover, I have heard: ‘Those who flatter to your face also slander behind your back.’ Now you offer me a great city and a multitude of people—this is but to lure me with profit and treat me as livestock among the common herd. How could such a thing endure?

Of all great domains, none surpasses the realm under Heaven. Yao and Shun ruled all beneath Heaven, yet their descendants were left without even a pin’s worth of land; Zhu and Jun did not inherit. Tang and Wu ascended as Son of Heaven, yet their posterity was extinguished. Was this not because their gain was too great?

Furthermore, I have heard: in ancient times, beasts were many and men few, so the people dwelled in nests to evade them, gathering acorns by day and roosting in trees by night—thus they were called the people of the Nest-Builder. In those days, people knew not clothing; in summer they piled firewood, and in winter they warmed themselves by it—thus they were called the people who knew life. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease, serene in repose, and rose with unbounded grace. The people knew their mothers but not their fathers, dwelling with deer and elk, tilling for food and weaving for clothing, without any thought of harming one another—this was the height of perfect virtue. Yet even the Yellow Emperor could not sustain such virtue: he battled Chiyou on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose, appointing ministers; Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu slew Zhou. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many tyrannized the few. Since the time of Tang and Wu, all have been followers of chaos.

Now you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, wielding the world’s eloquence to instruct later generations. You don flowing robes and narrow sashes, uttering deceptive words and feigning conduct to delude the lords of the world, all to seek wealth and rank—there is no greater thief than you! Why does the world not call you ‘Robber Qiu’ instead of calling me ‘Robber Zhi’?

You beguiled Zilu with honeyed words to make him follow you, causing him to cast off his warrior’s cap, lay down his long sword, and receive your teachings. The world all said, ‘Kong Qiu can quell violence and forbid wrongdoing.’ Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei and failed, his body pickled and hung upon the eastern gate of Wei—this was the failure of your teaching! Do you still call yourself a man of talent and a sage? You were twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and left with no refuge under Heaven. Your teaching brought Zilu to this disaster—there seems to be a missing phrase here. Above, you have no means to secure yourself; below, you have no means to secure others. Is your Way truly worthy of esteem?

Of all those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor, yet even he could not preserve his virtue, battling on the plains of Zhuolu until blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unfilial, Shun was undutiful—Yao did not pass the throne to Danzhu, and Shun was hated by his father. Yu was crippled—his toil in governing the waters left him afflicted. Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli.” The sentence should precede “King Wu” but is misplaced.

These six figures, exalted by the world—who has thoroughly examined them, who has weighed them with discernment? All were deluded by profit, losing their true nature and forcibly distorting their innate dispositions; their conduct was truly shameful!

Among those the world calls worthy gentlemen: Boyi and Shuqi renounced the rulership of Gubuzhu, yet starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their flesh and bones left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the age, embracing a tree until he died. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded, so he carried a stone and cast himself into the river, becoming food for fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was the very model of loyalty, cutting flesh from his own thigh to feed Duke Wen; later, the Duke betrayed him, and in anger, Zitui embraced a tree and burned to death. Weisheng arranged to meet a woman beneath a bridge; when she did not come and the waters rose, he refused to leave, clinging to the bridge pillar until he drowned.

These six men differed not at all from dismembered dogs, drifting swine, or beggars clutching gourds—all abandoned their reputations and treated death lightly, forgetting the root of nurturing life and the mandate of longevity. They did not reflect on the foundation of self-preservation, nor that life’s span is decreed by Heaven.

Among those the world calls loyal ministers, none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, Bigan had his heart carved out. Though these two are hailed as loyal ministers, in the end they became laughingstocks to all under Heaven. From a higher perspective, even Zixu and Bigan—who sacrificed themselves for their states and stand above the rest—are not truly worthy of esteem.

What you, Qiu, have tried to persuade me with is like telling me of ghostly matters, which I cannot comprehend. If you speak to me of human affairs, it is nothing beyond these examples—all of which I have already heard and understood.

Now let me tell you of human nature: the eye desires to see beauty, the ear to hear sound, the mouth to savor flavor, and the will to reach fulfillment. Of men, the longest-lived may reach a hundred years, the average eighty, the shortest sixty. Yet deduct the time lost to illness, death, mourning, and sorrow—what remains?

Within this span, the days one opens their mouth to laugh scarcely exceed four or five in a month. Heaven and Earth are without end, yet human death comes at its appointed time. Holding this finite vessel and entrusting it to the boundless, it vanishes in an instant—no different from a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall.

Those who cannot bring joy to their will and nurture their allotted years are not masters of the Dao. All that you, Qiu, have spoken are things I reject. Begone at once, return home, and speak no more of this! Your Way is frantic and grasping—"frantic" meaning the loss of one’s nature, "grasping" meaning never enough—nothing but deceit, artifice, and falsehood. It cannot preserve the integrity of the true, so why even discuss it?"

Confucius bowed twice, then hurried away. Stepping out the door, he mounted his carriage, but three times his hands fumbled the reins. His eyes stared blankly, seeing nothing; his complexion was ashen, like the dead. Leaning against the crossbar, he bowed his head, unable to catch his breath.

Upon returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he chanced upon Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji said, "It’s been several days since I last saw you—now your carriage and horses bear the marks of travel. Might you have gone to see Zhi?" *"Might" meaning "surely not."*

Confucius looked up to the heavens and sighed, "Yes."

Liuxia Ji asked, "Did Zhi perhaps offend you as I warned before?"—referring to Liuxia’s earlier words.

Confucius replied, "Yes."

"Master, what you’ve done is like needlessly cauterizing yourself when you’re not even ill—racing to stroke a tiger’s head, pluck its whiskers, nearly falling into its jaws!"

Zizhang asked Mangou De, "Why not act? Why not practice righteousness? Without action, there is no trust; without trust, no one will employ you; without employment, no profit. Thus, when one considers reputation and calculates advantage, true righteousness is what matters. If you take no action, people will not trust you; without trust, no one will employ you; without employment, there is no emolument. So when one considers reputation and calculates advantage, only the practice of righteousness is truly valid. If you abandon reputation and profit and turn back to your heart, then the conduct of a scholar cannot be neglected even for a day." The above refers to those who die for reputation and profit. If one abandons reputation and profit and returns to one’s own heart, the conduct of a scholar still cannot be neglected even for a day.

Mangou De replied, "The shameless grow rich, the glib rise to prominence. The greatest of reputation and profit lie in shamelessness and glibness. Thus, when one considers reputation and calculates advantage, true trustworthiness is what matters. If you abandon reputation and profit and turn back to your heart, then the conduct of a scholar should embrace the Heavenly within." When one considers reputation and calculates advantage, only trustworthiness is truly valid. If one abandons reputation and profit and returns to one’s own heart, then the conduct of a scholar should embrace the Dao of nature.

Zizhang said, "In the past, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven, possessing all under Heaven. If today you told a slave or bandit, ‘Your conduct is like Jie and Zhou’s,’ they would flush with shame and feel indignant—such is the contempt of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di were impoverished commoners; if today you told a prime minister, ‘Your conduct is like Confucius and Mo Di’s,’ they would change their expression and protest their inadequacy—such is the true esteem of scholars. Thus, to hold the position of Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer nobility; to be a poor commoner does not necessarily confer baseness. The distinction between noble and base lies in the beauty or ugliness of one’s conduct."

Mangou De said, "Petty thieves are imprisoned, but great thieves become feudal lords. At the gates of feudal lords, men of principle reside. These four lines also appear in the *Qièqiè* chapter, where ‘men of principle’ is written as ‘benevolence and righteousness.’ In the past, Duke Huan of Qi killed his elder brother and took his sister-in-law as his wife, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. In words, they condemn such men; in deeds, they defer to them—is this not a contradiction raging in the breast, words and actions at war? Is this not perverse? Thus, the *Book* says: ‘Who is ugly, who is beautiful? The successful are heads, the unsuccessful are tails.’"

Zizhang said, "If you take no action, kinship and affection will lack order, nobility and baseness will lack righteousness, elders and juniors will lack sequence—how then can the Five Bonds and Six Positions be distinguished?"

Mangou De replied, "Yao killed his eldest son; Shun exiled his younger brother. Was there order in kinship and affection? Tang exiled Jie; King Wu attacked Zhou. Was there righteousness in nobility and baseness? Wang Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother. Was there sequence in elders and juniors? The Confucians preach hypocritical words; the Mohists advocate universal love—can the Five Bonds and Six Positions be distinguished? Moreover, you rectify for the sake of reputation, while I rectify for the sake of profit. The reality of reputation and profit does not accord with principle, nor is it illuminated by the Dao. Daily, I dispute with you before Wu Yue, who says: ‘The petty man dies for wealth, the gentleman dies for reputation. Though their emotions shift and their natures change in different ways, when it comes to abandoning what they should hold and dying for what they should not, they are the same.’ Thus it is said: Do not act as a petty man; turn back and die for the Heavenly. Do not act as a gentleman; follow the principle of Heaven. Whether crooked or straight, observe the Heavenly limit—do not question crookedness or straightness, but regard your natural end as the limit. Face the four directions, ebb and flow with the times. Whether right or wrong, grasp the revolving mechanism."

"Grasp the Dao of the ring’s center to respond to right and wrong." Alone, he completes his intent, wandering with the Dao. Without fixation in action, without completion in righteousness, one will lose what one seeks to do. Without rushing toward wealth, without dying for success, one will abandon the Heavenly. Bi Gan was disemboweled, Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged out—these were the disasters of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned—these were the perils of trust. Baozi stood by the pole, Shenzi did not defend himself—these were the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—these were the failures of righteousness. These are what the ancients transmitted and later generations discuss, taking them as models for scholars to rectify their words and align their conduct, yet still they suffer calamity and encounter misfortune.

Wuzu asked Zhihe: "No one among men ultimately fails to pursue fame and seek profit. Those who are wealthy attract others; those who attract others are humbled; those who are humbled are honored. To be seen as humble and honored is the Way to longevity, bodily ease, and joy. Now you alone have no such intent—is your wisdom insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you persist in seeking the correct path without forgetting it?" The words *yi* and *yi* are interchangeable here, meaning "or."

Zhihe replied: "Now, such a person regards those born in the same era and dwelling in the same village as themselves as transcendent, surpassing the world—yet this is to be fixated on having no master and no standard, by which to survey the times of past and present and the divisions of right and wrong. Such a person, who pursues fame and profit, sees those of their own time and place as transcendent and surpassing the world, fixated on non-action and mastering the correct Dao, sufficient to survey the times of past and present and the divisions of right and wrong—why not emulate them? Yet they blend with the俗 and transform with the world, abandoning what is most weighty and discarding what is most honorable for the sake of their pursuits. How far this is from the Way of longevity, bodily ease, and joy! They mingle with the vulgar and conform to the world, how distant they are from those who transcend the俗 and surpass the world! Abandoning the weightiest life and discarding the most honorable Dao for the sake of what they call wealth and nobility—how far this is from the truth of things!

The pain of sorrow and the peace of contentment are not reflected in the body; the distress of fear and the delight of joy are not reflected in the heart. Knowing how to act but not knowing why one acts, one may be honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, yet still not escape misfortune." Wuzu said: "Wealth, for a person, has no disadvantage. It exhausts beauty and perfects power, reaching what the utmost person cannot attain and what the worthy cannot surpass. It harnesses others’ courage and strength without becoming domineering, wields others’ wisdom and plans as one’s own discernment, and relies on others’ virtue to be deemed virtuous. Though not ruling a state, one is as revered as a lord or father. Moreover, sounds and sights, flavors and power—these bring joy to the heart without need of learning, and comfort to the body without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, avoidance and pursuit—these do not require a teacher, for they are human nature. Though all under Heaven may oppose me, who can reject them?" The words mean that all under Heaven shares the same desires.

Zhihe said: "The actions of the wise move with the people and do not violate their measures. The wise act for all under Heaven by moving with the people, and the people do not transgress their standards."

Thus content, one does not contend; acting without contrivance, one seeks nothing beyond. Discontent drives the search, contending in all four directions without self-regard as greed; as Master Cheng explains: "four directions, meaning all quarters." Surfeit prompts refusal, relinquishing all under Heaven without self-regard as integrity. Herein lies the division between sage and commoner. The essence of integrity and greed is not imposed from without but reflects the measure of self-examination. The essence of integrity and greed is not forced by external pressure but revealed by looking inward at one’s own capacity.

Though possessing the power of the Son of Heaven, one does not use nobility to overbear others; though wealth encompasses all under Heaven, one does not use riches to toy with others. Calculating the harm, considering the consequences—"pondering their reversal," as in the *Airs of Wei*—one deems it injurious to one’s nature, thus declines and does not accept, not to seek reputation. Yao and Shun ruled as emperors and brought harmony, the black-haired people then harmonious. Not out of benevolence toward all under Heaven, but to avoid allowing beauty to harm life; exhausting fine benefits to serve oneself is to harm one’s own life. Shanjuan and Xu You, offered the throne, declined—not out of empty refusal but to avoid allowing affairs to harm themselves. All these embraced what benefited them and declined what harmed them, and all under Heaven called them worthy. Thus one may possess such worthiness, yet they did not seek to cultivate reputation.

Wu Zu said: "To cling to reputation, torment the body, renounce sweetness, and restrict nourishment to preserve life—is this not like one long afflicted, enduring hardship without dying?" To insist on guarding reputation, tormenting the body, forsaking sweetness, and limiting sustenance to preserve life—is this not the same as one long diseased, enduring hardship without death? What benefit is there?

Zhihe said: "Equanimity brings fortune, excess brings harm—nothing is otherwise, and wealth is the most extreme case. Now the rich delight their ears with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes, and their mouths with the flavors of fine meats and rich wines," as the *Shuowen* says: "delighting the mouth with what pleases it." This stirs their minds, causing them to neglect their affairs—one may call this disorder. Engorged with qi, they are like one bearing a heavy load while climbing—one may call this suffering. Xu’s note: "Xu reads *ai* as *wai*, fifth tone. Alternatively, *hu gai* tone. *Hai* means food reaching the throat." Wang Niansun says: "In the *Zuo Tradition*, *feng* means abundance. *Feng qi* means abundant qi." Thus, with many desires, one is choked and drowned in surging qi, like bearing a heavy load uphill—how great the suffering! Coveting wealth brings affliction, coveting power brings exhaustion. Guo Qingfan says: "In the *Miu Cheng Xun* of the *Huainanzi*, *wei* means illness. Paired with *jie*, both mean ailment." At rest, one is drowned; in comfort, one is enraged. Idle, one is steeped in indulgence; pampered, one is filled with fury—one may call this sickness. Pursuing wealth and profit, one is so full as to be deaf and unaware of avoidance, pressing forward without cease—one may call this disgrace. Wealth accumulates without use, clung to without release, filling the heart with vexation and sorrow. Seeking more without end—one may call this sorrow. Within, one fears the threats of robbers and extortion; without, one dreads the harm of bandits and thieves. Within, one encircles with layered defenses; Li says: "inner layers of towers, outer open windows—fortifications and defenses." Without, one dares not walk alone—one may call this fear. These six are the greatest harms under Heaven, yet all are neglected and unexamined. When calamity arrives, one seeks to exhaust one’s nature and deplete one’s wealth, craving wealth as if it were innate nature. Wealth becomes nature, hence "exhausting nature and depleting wealth." Yet in a single day, one cannot return to a state of innocence. Guo Songtao says: "*Dan* and *dan* are interchangeable. *Dan* means 'only'; *dan* also means 'only.'" Thus, when observed by name, it is unseen; when sought for profit, it is unattained. Twisting mind and body to contend for this—is this not delusion?

**Miscellaneous Chapters, "Discourse on Swords" (Chapter Thirty)**
Formerly, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Xu’s note: "Sima says: 'King Huiwen, named He, son of King Wuling. Later than Zhuangzi by 350 years.' The *Dong Ji* states: 'In the seventeenth year of King Nan of Zhou, the first year of King Huiwen of Zhao.' Another says: According to the *Long Chronology*, King Huiwen coincided with Zhuangzi—perhaps Biao’s words are mistaken." Swordsmen thronged his gates as guests, numbering over three thousand, dueling before him day and night. Over a hundred died or were wounded each year, yet his fondness was unabated. After three years, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against it. The crown prince, Kui, grew anxious. Yu says: "King Huiwen was later succeeded by King Xiaocheng, named Dan, so this crown prince likely did not ascend." He summoned his attendants: "Whoever can persuade the king to cease his fondness for swordsmen shall be rewarded with a thousand gold pieces." The attendants said: "Zhuangzi would be capable." The crown prince then sent someone with a thousand gold pieces to offer Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi declined, but went with the messenger to see the crown prince, saying: "What instruction does the crown prince have for Zhou, that you bestow a thousand gold pieces?" The crown prince said: "I have heard that you, Master, are enlightened and sagely. I humbly offer a thousand gold pieces as gifts for your attendants. Since you decline, Kui dares not speak further!" Zhuangzi said: "I have heard that what the crown prince wishes from Zhou is to end the king’s fondness for swords. If I persuade the king above but contradict his wishes, or below fail to meet the crown prince’s expectations, I would face execution—how then could Zhou make use of gold? If I persuade the king above and meet the crown prince’s expectations below, what in Zhao could not be obtained?"

The crown prince said: "Indeed. What my king sees are only swordsmen." Zhuangzi said: "Good. Zhou is skilled in the sword." The crown prince said: "Yet all the swordsmen my king sees have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, and drooping caps—*as if leaning forward to fight*—with coarse, unadorned tassels, short-backed robes—*for ease of movement*—and glaring eyes, their speech halting—*for the rage of warriors chokes their words*. The king delights in them. Now if you, Master, appear before the king in scholar’s robes, the matter will surely go awry."

Zhuangzi said: "Permit me to prepare swordsman’s attire." After three days preparing his sword attire, he appeared before the crown prince. The crown prince then presented him to the king, who awaited with bared blade. Zhuangzi entered the palace gate without haste and did not bow upon seeing the king. The king said: "What instruction do you bring, that you send the crown prince ahead?"—*meaning, that the crown prince spoke for him first*. Zhuangzi said: "I have heard that Your Majesty delights in the sword, so I come before you with the sword."

The king said: "What power does your sword possess to restrain and control?" Zhuangzi said: "My sword cuts down one man every ten paces and leaves no obstacle in a thousand *li*."—*Within ten paces, it slays one man; over a thousand *li*, it meets no resistance, its edge unblunted, its force unbroken—this describes the sword’s keen edge. Here, "leaves no obstacle" refers to the sword, not to men.*

The king was greatly pleased and said: "There is none in the world who can withstand it!" Zhuangzi said: "The way of the sword is to present emptiness, offer advantage, strike after the opponent moves, and arrive first. I wish to demonstrate this."—*To forget the self and remain empty, to open the way for others’ benefit, to respond only after being moved, and to perceive things before they arise—this is Zhuangzi’s use of the sword.*

The king said: "Master, rest in your quarters and await my command. I shall arrange a contest and invite you." The king then assembled swordsmen for seven days; over sixty were killed or wounded. Five or six remained, and these he stationed at the palace steps bearing their swords, then summoned Zhuangzi.

The king said: "Today, let us test the swordsmen’s skill in combat."—*"Dun" means "to order" or "to arrange."* Zhuangzi said: "I have long awaited this." The king said: "What length of weapon do you wield?"—*"Yu" means "to use."*—*Here, "weapon" refers to what one holds.*

Zhuangzi said: "Any length I am given will suffice. Yet I possess three swords, and only Your Majesty may choose which to employ. Permit me to describe them first, then demonstrate." The king said: "I wish to hear of the three swords."

Zhuangzi said: "There is the Son of Heaven’s sword, the feudal lord’s sword, and the commoner’s sword."

The king said: "What is the Son of Heaven’s sword like?"

Zhuangzi said: "The Son of Heaven’s sword has Yanxi and Stone Citadel as its point, Qi and Mount Tai as its edge—*Yanxi is a place in Yan; the edge is the sword’s blade, or alternatively, its ridges*—Jin and Wei as its spine, Zhou and Song as its guard—*the guard is the ring; Jin and Wei lie near Zhao, so they form the spine; Zhou and Song lie to the south, so they form the ring*—Han and Wei as its hilt—*the hilt is the grip; one text reads "jiá," meaning the same. Another says the guard runs from ridge to back, while the hilt runs from ridge to edge*—encompassing the Four Barbarians, enfolding the Four Seasons—*embracing the Four Barbarians with virtue and power, following the Four Seasons in generation and transformation*—encircling the Bohai Sea, girded by Mount Chang—*these two lines should precede "encompassing the Four Barbarians."*—governing by the Five Phases, judging by punishment and virtue—*punishment is penalty; virtue is reward; both are spoken of in terms of the sword. The ancients had discourses on the sword*—opening with yin and yang, sustaining with spring and summer, acting with autumn and winter—*spring and summer nurture, so one sustains without wielding; autumn and winter are stern and killing, so one acts with them.*

This sword, when thrust forward, meets no resistance; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is below it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. When this sword is once employed, it rectifies the feudal lords, and the world submits. This is the Son of Heaven’s sword."

King Wen, bewildered, lost himself and said: "What is the feudal lord’s sword like?"

Zhuangzi said: "The feudal lord’s sword has the wise and brave as its point, the pure and incorrupt as its edge, the worthy and good as its spine, the loyal and sagely as its guard, the heroic and outstanding as its hilt. This sword, when thrust forward, also meets no resistance; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is below it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it models the round heaven to follow the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth to follow the Four Seasons; in the center, it harmonizes the people’s will to pacify the Four Directions—*the Four Directions are like the four quarters.* When this sword is once employed, it strikes like thunder, and within the four borders, none fail to submit and heed the ruler’s command. This is the feudal lord’s sword."

The king said: "What is the commoner’s sword like?"

Zhuangzi said: "The commoner’s sword has unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, and drooping caps, coarse tassels, short-backed robes, glaring eyes, and halting speech. They strike at one another before you, severing necks above and piercing livers and lungs below."

This commoner’s sword differs not from cockfighting—once the life is cut short, it serves no purpose in the affairs of state. Now Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven yet delights in the commoner’s sword; your servant humbly deems this unworthy of you.”

The king then led him up to the hall. The royal chef presented the meal, and the king circled it three times, unable to sit still. Zhuangzi said: “May Your Majesty settle into your seat and calm your qi; the matter of the sword has now been concluded.”

Thereupon, King Wen did not leave the palace for three months, and all the swordsmen submitted and perished where they stood. Sima Biao notes: “Enraged at not being received with due ceremony, they all took their own lives.”

**Miscellaneous Chapters: "The Old Fisherman" (Chapter Thirty-One)**

Confucius wandered through the forest of black curtains, which Sima Biao identifies as a grove of dark trees. He rested and sat upon the Apricot Terrace, which Sima Biao describes as a raised mound in the marsh. His disciples read aloud, while Confucius plucked the strings and sang, playing the zither. The melody was not yet half-finished when an old fisherman descended from his boat and approached. His beard and brows were snowy white, his hair unbound, and his sleeves swaying as he walked. Ascending from the marshland, he stopped at the edge of the dry ground, his left hand resting on his knee and his right hand supporting his chin, listening intently.

When the music ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, who both responded. The stranger pointed at Confucius and asked: “What is that man doing?” Zilu replied: “He is a gentleman of Lu.” The stranger inquired about his lineage, and Zilu answered: “His clan is Kong.” The stranger asked: “And what does the Kong clan govern?”—meaning, what arts or teachings do they practice?

Zilu did not answer, but Zigong replied: “The Kong clan cultivates loyalty and trust as their nature, embodies benevolence and righteousness in their conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects from human relationships, examining and choosing among them. Above, they serve the rulers of the age with loyalty; below, they transform the common people—Li Yun explains *qi* as ‘equal,’ while Xu Shen glosses it as ‘the people of equal standing’—all to benefit the world. This is what the Kong clan governs.”

The stranger then asked: “Is he a lord with lands?” Zigong said: “No.” “Is he an advisor to kings and marquises?” Zigong said: “No.” The stranger laughed and turned to leave, saying: “Benevolent he may be, but I fear he will not escape harm to himself. He wearies his heart and exhausts his form, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far he has strayed from the Dao!”

The *Cheng* commentary states: “This means ‘separated from the profound Dao.’” The *Shiwen* notes: “Alternatively written as *jie*. Sima [Biao] says: ‘It means *separated*.’”

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying: “He must be a sage!” He then went down to seek him, reaching the marsh’s edge just as the stranger was propping up his oar to pull his boat. Sima [Biao] notes: “*Na* means *oar*, pronounced *yu*.” Turning, the stranger saw Confucius and faced him, standing still. The *Shiwen* notes: “*Xiang* is sometimes written as *toward*.” Confucius retreated, then bowed twice and stepped forward.

The stranger asked: “What do you seek?”

Confucius replied: “Earlier, Master, you left with words unfinished. Yu [Shi] notes: “*Xu* means *remnant*; you departed before completing them, hence *remnant words*. I, Qiu, am unworthy and did not grasp their meaning. I humbly awaited in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spittle, that I might fully assist Qiu!” The *Cheng* commentary states: “To aid what I cannot reach.”

The stranger exclaimed: “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”

Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying: “From my youth I have cultivated learning, and now at sixty-nine years of age, I have yet to hear the ultimate teaching. How dare I not empty my heart!”

The stranger replied: “Like follows like, sound responds to sound—this is the inherent principle of Heaven. I shall now set forth what I possess and order your *so-that*. Sima [Biao] notes: ‘*Jing* means *to order*.’ Below the same. Your *so-that* is human affairs. The Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the great officers, and the common people—when these four are rightly aligned, each holds to its place. This is the beauty of good governance. When the four depart from their places, no disorder is greater.

When offices govern their duties and people attend to their tasks, none encroaches upon another. Cheng [Xuanying] notes: ‘*Ling* means *disorder*.’ Thus, fields lying fallow and houses exposed, clothing and food insufficient, taxes and levies unmet, wives and concubines discordant, elders and juniors without order—these are the worries of the common people. Inability to fulfill one’s post, official duties neglected, conduct impure, subordinates idle and remiss, achievements unrecognized, no merit for the state, no reputation among the people, rank and emolument unsustained—unable to preserve one’s rank and emolument—these are the worries of the great officers. The court lacking loyal ministers, the state in darkness and chaos, artisans unskilled, tribute and service unrefined, spring and autumn audiences delayed or disordered—*Shiwen* notes: ‘Failing to meet the proper sequence in court appearances’—and disobedience to the Son of Heaven: these are the worries of the feudal lords. Yin and yang disharmonious, cold and heat untimely, harming the myriad things, feudal lords violent and disorderly, seizing and attacking one another to ravage the people, rites and music unregulated, resources exhausted, human relations unordered, the hundred clans licentious and chaotic: these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s officials.

Now, you possess neither the authority of lord or official above nor the office of a great minister below, yet you presume to regulate rites and music, select human relations, and transform the common people. Is this not excessively meddlesome? Moreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot go unexamined.

To take up what is not one’s affair is called *zong*. Cheng notes: ‘*Zong* means *excess*.’ To advance without regard is called *flattery*. Cheng notes: ‘Unsought, one forces forth loyal words.’ To speak in hope of favor is called *sycophancy*. Cheng notes: ‘Hoping to align with another’s intent, one guides their words.’ To speak without discerning right or wrong is called *obsequiousness*. Cheng notes: ‘Indiscriminately following others, not distinguishing right from wrong.’ To delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *slander*. To sever friendships and divide kin is called *treachery*. To praise with deceit and ruin the wicked is called *depravity*—deceitfully praising while ruining those one deems wicked is called *treacherous depravity*. Yao [Shun] notes: ‘The Zhang edition reads *evil* as *virtue*, meaning “to invert right and wrong to ruin another’s virtue,” which is more incisive.’ To accommodate both good and bad, maintaining an agreeable countenance, stealthily seizing what one desires, is called *perfidy*. *Shiwen* notes: ‘*Liang rong jia shi* means to accept both good and evil, adjusting one’s demeanor accordingly. *Jia* may also be written as *yan*.’”

“To *stealthily seize* means to subtly draw forth the desires in others’ hearts.”

These eight flaws externally confuse others and internally harm oneself; the noble person does not befriend such men, nor does the enlightened ruler employ them.

The so-called four perils are these: to delight in managing great affairs, altering and overturning the constant, all to grasp at merit and fame, is called *presumptuousness*. To alter the constant norms in hopes of securing merit and fame is *reckless presumption*. To monopolize knowledge and arrogate affairs, encroaching on others and acting on one’s own, is called *greed*. To monopolize knowledge means to claim, “I alone know.” To persist in error without correction, and to grow more obstinate upon hearing admonition, is called *obduracy*. To approve only what accords with oneself, and to reject even what is good if it differs from oneself, is called *arrogance*. These are the four perils.

Only when one has shed the eight flaws and refrained from the four perils may one begin to be taught.”

Confucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying, “I was twice driven from Lu, my traces erased in Wei, my tree felled in Song, and I was besieged in Chen and Cai. I do not know what fault I committed to incur these four slanders—why was this?”

The guest’s expression turned sorrowful as he replied, “How difficult it is for you to awaken! There was a man who feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, and so ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints he made; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing himself still too slow, he ran without cease until he collapsed and died. He did not know that by standing in the shade he could rest his shadow, and by remaining still he could still his footprints—how foolish he was!

You scrutinize the space between benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundary between sameness and difference, observe the shifts of activity and stillness, adjust the measure of giving and receiving, order the passions of like and dislike, and harmonize the rhythms of joy and anger—yet you have barely escaped calamity. If this is how you weigh your dealings with things, and still you have barely escaped, then take care to cultivate yourself, guard your true nature, and return things to others, and you will have no entanglements. If you do not contend with external things, you will have no perils or burdens. Now, instead of cultivating yourself, you seek from others—is this not misplaced?”

Confucius sighed and said, “May I ask what is meant by *the true*?”

The guest replied, “The true is the utmost of essence and sincerity. Without essence and sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though stern, is not awe-inspiring; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is mournful without sound; true anger is awe-inspiring before it erupts; true affection is harmonious before it smiles. When the true resides within, the spirit stirs without—this is why the true is prized.

Applied to human principles—*principles* meaning human relations—serving parents yields compassion and filial piety; serving a lord yields loyalty and integrity; drinking wine yields joy; observing mourning yields grief. Loyalty and integrity take merit as their aim; drinking wine takes joy as its aim; mourning takes grief as its aim; serving parents takes comfort as its aim. The beauty of merit’s completion lies not in uniformity of form. Many are the visible achievements, so their traces are not uniform. Serving parents with comfort does not depend on means: sipping beans and drinking water can bring perfect joy, so one does not inquire into the means. Drinking wine with joy does not require fine fare: the dishes need not be chosen. Mourning with grief does not depend on ritual: facing death with full sorrow, one then observes ritual. Ritual is what the common customs devise; the true is what one receives from Heaven, naturally and unalterably. Thus the sage models Heaven and prizes the true, not bound by custom. The foolish do the opposite: unable to model Heaven, they fret over human affairs, ignorant of the true’s value. They drift along, shaped by custom, and so are never sufficient.”

*Shiwen* notes: “*Lulu* [禄禄]: Sima’s edition reads *lulu* [录录].”
*Annotation*: *Lulu* is like *lulu* [录录]. The *Hanshu*’s eulogy for Xiao and Cao writes “lulu” [录录], and Yan’s commentary says: “Like *lulu* [鹿鹿], meaning among the common herd.”

“Alas! You were immersed in human falsity early on and only now hear of the great Dao!”

Confucius bowed twice and rose again, saying, “Today I have been so fortunate as to meet you, as if by Heaven’s grace. You do not disdain to treat me like a servant or follower, and you instruct me in person. May I ask where you reside? I would like to follow you to complete my study of the great Dao.”

The guest said, “I have heard: those who can journey with you, journey with them to the wondrous Dao. *Cheng* notes: ‘To go from delusion to awakening is *journeying*. The wondrous Dao is the true origin.’ Those who cannot journey with you do not understand the Dao—take care not to accompany them, and you will avoid blame. Strive on! I leave you now, I leave you now.”

The guest then poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds. Yan Yuan turned the carriage, while Zilu handed the reins, but Confucius did not look back. Only when the water’s ripples stilled—*Shiwen* notes: “The boat’s passage stirs the waves; when it departs far, the waves settle”—and the sound of the oar vanished did he dare to board.

Zilu stepped beside the carriage and asked, “I have long served you, yet never have I seen you meet another with such reverence. Even the lords of ten thousand chariots or the rulers of a thousand, when they receive you, do not fail to observe proper courtesy, yet you still maintain a dignified bearing. Now this fisherman leans on his oar and stands defiantly, yet you bow deeply, your waist bent like a chime stone, answering him with repeated bows—*Cheng* notes: “You received his words with bows and responded.” Is this not excessive? The disciples all find your conduct strange. How has this fisherman earned such deference?”

Confucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed, “How deeply entrenched your ways are, You! You have been steeped in ritual and propriety for so long, yet your crude and vulgar heart remains unchanged to this day. Come closer! Let me tell you.”

"To meet one’s elders without reverence is a breach of ritual; to encounter the worthy without esteem is a want of humaneness. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others—*Cheng* notes: 'Were he not a person of utmost virtue, he could not make others yield in humility.' Yet if one’s humility is not refined, one cannot attain their truth—for as stated above, 'Truth is the utmost of pure sincerity.' Thus, to slight one’s elders harms the self. Alas! There is no greater misfortune for a person than the want of humaneness, and yet You alone clings to it—*to cling* meaning to claim it as one’s own.

Moreover, the Dao is that from which the myriad things arise. Those creatures that lose it perish; those that attain it live. In affairs, to act against it is to fail; to follow it is to succeed. Thus, wherever the Dao is found, the sage honors it. Now this fisherman’s Dao may be said to exist—how could I dare not revere him!"

When Liezi of *Lie Yukou* traveled to Qi, he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Maoren. (See *Liezi* in the *Huangdi* chapter.) Bohun Maoren asked, "Why have you returned along the way?" *Li* notes: "Fang means 'way.'" Liezi replied, "I was startled." Bohun Maoren said, "..."

"Why were you startled?" Liezi replied, "Once, I dined among ten *jiang*-sellers—*Li* notes: '*Jiang* is read as fermented drink. Ten households all sold fermented drinks.' *Case*: The *Huangdi* chapter reads 'fermented drink.'—yet five of them offered me gifts first." *Exegesis*: "Gifts, meaning bestowals. That is, five of the ten households first presented me with offerings." *Case*: Zhang Zhan’s commentary: "People all deferred to one beneath them." Bohun Maoren said, "If this is so, then why were you startled?"

Liezi answered, "For within, sincerity remained unresolved—*Guo* notes: 'Outwardly, he adorned himself with pride.' *Case*: The phrasing is incomplete. Zhang’s commentary includes five additional characters: 'inwardly, it was not released.'—while without, deceptive appearances formed a radiant display—*Guo* notes: 'His conduct was obsequious and polished, presenting a luminous demeanor.' *Exegesis*: 'Deceptive' is read *die* (徒協反). *Guo* says: 'obsequious.' *Shuowen* states: 'composure.'—thereby overawing others’ minds with externals—*Zhang*’s commentary: 'Outwardly, he relied on stern dignity to subdue others, though inwardly he was insufficient.'—causing people to slight the esteemed and the elderly—*Exegesis*: 'Meaning they honored Lie Yukou above elders.'—and disrupting what they took to be troublesome—*Exegesis*: '*Disrupting* is read *zā* (子兮反), meaning chaos.' *Su Yu* notes: 'The later reference to "undertaking tasks and demonstrating merit" refers to what they deemed troublesome. That is, he would use his own concerns to agitate and disorder them. *Zhuangzi* often employs *qi* (其) in this manner. Below, "Why not once observe his excellence" also refers to Ruo Ao speaking of himself.' *Xuan* notes: '*Disrupting* carries the sense of brewing. Another interpretation: *zā* is interchangeable with *jī* (赍), meaning to deliver. Both readings are valid.'"

"Now, selling millet is merely a trade for broth, a surplus of excess—*Huangdi* chapter has 'no' before 'excess.' *Zhang* notes: 'One edition omits "no."' *Case*: Without 'no,' it aligns with the *Zhuang* edition; including 'no' makes the reasoning more complete. Its profit is meager, its influence slight, and yet it is thus—how much more so for the lord of ten thousand chariots! His body toils for the state, his knowledge exhausts itself in affairs." (The *Huangdi* chapter omits '乎.' These two phrases pertain to the Qi ruler's speech.)

"He will task me with duties and demand merit from me." *Cheng* notes: "Testing me with achievements." "This is why I am alarmed." (He went to see the Qi ruler, who would assign tasks and measure merit, imposing heavy expectations—likely to bring disorder. Thus, he extrapolated from the millet-selling affair, took alarm, and fled.)

Bo Hun Mouren said: "Excellent observation! You discern human nature well. Remain at home, and others will come to you." *Sima* notes: "Preserve, meaning to attach." *Case*: Stay at home, and people will gather to you.

Soon after, he went again, and the shoes outside the door filled the entryway." *Cheng* notes: "Once he ascended the hall, many sought his instruction."

Bo Hun Mouren stood facing north, planting his staff and propping his chin upon it." *Sima* notes: "Dun means to stand upright." *Cheng* notes: "Leaning on his staff to support his chin, he listened to his words." After standing for a while, he departed without a word." *Cheng* notes: "He left in wordless return."

The attendant informed Liezi." *Shiwen* notes: "Bin, also written as 傧, refers to the one who receives guests." Liezi grasped his shoes, ran barefoot, and reached the gate, saying: "Master, since you have come, have you no medicine to offer?" *Shiwen* notes: "Sima’s edition has '废' for '发.'" *Guo Qingfan* notes: "'发' and '废' were interchangeable in ancient pronunciation." *Case*: The *Huangdi* chapter has '废.' *Zhang* notes: "'废' means to set aside. He never once offered a healing word as medicine."

He replied: "Enough!"

"Indeed, I had told you, 'Others will protect you,' and now they truly have protected you. It was not that you could make others protect you, nor could you prevent them from protecting you—so why then this pretense of marvel, this premature display of difference? The *Huangdi* chapter adds '感也' after '之' and omits '也' after '异.' *Zhang* notes: 'What art did you use to move others so?' But this is mistaken. The *Huangdi* chapter should read: 'Why do you use this to move others?' *Zhang*'s interpretation is wrong. 'Premature display of difference' means bestowing favors before others act, offering them early to move their hearts—this is merely making oneself different. There must be some influence, yet it shakes your fundamental nature—what meaning does this hold?

The *Huangdi* chapter writes '且必' for '必且,' adds '也' after '感,' and uses '身' for '才.' *Case*: '本才' means one’s fundamental nature, akin to Mencius’ '非才之罪也.' *Shiwen* notes: 'One version writes 性 for 才,' which carries the same meaning. To say one must bestow favors to move others is to chase after things, shaking your fundamental nature—what purpose does this serve?

Among those who keep your company, none admonishes you." *Xuan* notes: "None offers loyal counsel." "Their petty words are all poison to others." *Zhang* notes: "Petty words, clever and subtle, easily move people, thus becoming a poison to them." No one awakens, no one perceives—how can they examine one another? *Guo Songtao* notes: "The *Hanshu*’s *Biography of Jia Yi* reads '日夜念此至孰也,' with *Yan* annotating: '孰 means to examine closely.' Since there is no awakening or perception, how can anyone scrutinize another?"

The cunning labor, the wise worry; the incapable seek nothing. They eat their fill and wander freely, drifting like an untethered boat—empty, they wander at ease." *Cheng* notes: "Things inevitably exhaust themselves through cleverness and knowledge. Only the sage, unbound and drifting like an empty boat, roams in carefree spontaneity." *Case*: The passage from "The cunning labor" onward was added by Zhuangzi.

In the land of Qiu, a man of Zheng named Huan groaned in pain." *Sima* notes: "Huan is the man’s name." *Shiwen* notes: "Qiu is a place name." *Guo* notes: "Groaning refers to chanting and recitation." After three years, Huan became a Confucian." *Guo* notes: "祗 means 'then.'" "His learning moistened nine *li* of the riverbank and nourished three clans." *Xuan* notes: "This illustrates how, once learning is complete, it must benefit others." He sent his younger brother to study Mohism. Huan sent his brother to study Mohism. His brother’s name appears below.

The Confucians and Mohists debated, and their father sided with Di." *Cheng* notes: "Confucians follow the rites of Wen and Wu, tracing their lineage to Yao and Shun, clinging stubbornly to their doctrines and fond of verbose arguments. Mohists follow the Way of Yu, valuing frugality and generosity. With Confucianism and Mohism on divergent paths, each clinging to their own rightness, the father, like a child taking sides, aided Di." After ten years, Huan took his own life.

His father dreamed of him, who said: 'The one who made your son a Mohist was I. Why did you never examine his excellence? He has already become the fruit of the autumn cypress!'" *Case*: 阖 is interchangeable with 盍, meaning "why not." 胡 also means "why." "阖胡" used together follows the example of ancient phrases like "尚犹" or "惟独," forming a reduplicative expression. 尝 means "to try." *Shiwen* notes: "良 may also be written as 埌, pronounced *lang*, meaning a burial mound." *Case*: In the dream, Huan told his father: "Your son’s Mohism was my doing. Why did you never examine my grave? The autumn cypress I planted there has already borne fruit!" The grievance of the wronged spirit was deeply conveyed.

When the Creator repays a person, it does not repay the person but the person’s Heaven." *Guo* notes: "From here onward, these are Zhuangzi’s words." *Cheng* notes: "The Creator is the boundless, the one who fashions and transforms all things, hence called the Creator. A person’s intelligence and abilities are endowed by this creative power, not acquired through study. Thus, if one borrows from learning to assist the Dao of nature, the repayment goes to one’s Heavenly nature, not to human effort. Di possessed a Mohist nature, which did not come from Huan. Huan claimed he taught it—was this not absurd?" It was Heaven that made him so. He had a Mohist nature, so it made him a Mohist.

Yet this man believed himself to be different from others, thus despising his kin." *Cheng* notes: "Huan, relying on his own learning and cultivation, believed himself superior to ordinary people, thus belittling his kin and opposing his father." The well of the people of Qi: those who drank from it fought one another. Thus it is said: "People today are all like Huan." When the people of Qi dug a well, travelers drew water to drink, but the well’s owner, guarding the water, would seize the drinkers by the head, unaware of the spring’s natural abundance. This illustrates how Huan, ignorant of Di’s innate Mohist nature, grew resentful of him. (This note incorporates *Lu* and *Cheng*.)

From this, those with virtue do so through unknowing—how much more so those with the Dao!" *Shiwen* notes: "知 is pronounced *zhi*." *Case*: 以 and 已 are interchangeable. 德 means "to attain." To speak of attaining virtue as "virtue" and then to assert one’s own virtue is already unwise—how much less can those with the Dao fail to follow their Heavenly nature! In ancient times, this was called the punishment of fleeing from Heaven. The earlier passage states, "The cunning labor and the wise worry"—this is to be punished by Heaven. The *Dechongfu* chapter says: "Punished by Heaven, how can one escape?" If one does not claim the Dao for oneself, one may evade the punishment of fleeing from Heaven. This saying also appears in the *Yangshengzhu* chapter.

The sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not peaceful." *Cheng* notes: "安 means to follow."

The sage entrusts the natures of all living beings to themselves, neither drawing things to follow his own will nor forcibly imposing what their natures lack—this is what makes him a sage. The multitude, however, finds peace in what is not peaceful and does not find peace in what is peaceful. Abandoning the self to follow things is to find peace in what is not peaceful; not finding peace in one’s inherent allotment is not to find peace in what is peaceful.

Zhuangzi said: "Knowing the Dao is easy; refraining from speech is difficult." *Cheng* notes: "Applying knowledge is easy; forgetting speech is difficult." To know and not speak is to proceed toward Heaven; *zhi* means "to go." *Cheng* notes: "To reach the realm of naturalness." To know and to speak is to proceed toward man. The ancients proceeded toward Heaven and not toward man. *Cheng* notes: "The true men of old, those who knew the Dao, were naturally pure and free of human sentiments."

Zhu Pingman studied dragon-slaying from Zhi Liyi. *Sima* notes: "Zhu Pingman and Zhi Liyi were both men’s names." He exhausted a thousand gold’s worth of family wealth, and after three years, his skill was perfected—yet he had no use for his craft. *Xuan* notes: "There were no dragons to slay. Thus, the noble man does not value extreme skills but values the Way of the Mean."

The sage takes what is necessarily so as if it were not necessarily so, and thus has no use for arms. *Guo* notes: "Though a principle is necessarily so, to treat it as if it were not is the height of compliance—how could arms arise!" The multitude takes what is not necessarily so as necessarily so, and thus arms abound. *Xuan* notes: "Taking what is not necessarily so in principle and each insisting on their own partial views, discord and strife arise." Following arms, their actions are driven by desire. *Xuan* notes: "Yielding to strife, they act only to satisfy their wants." Arms, once grasped, bring ruin. Even with arms, one cannot rely on them.

The petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond bribes and letters. *Xuan* notes: "*Bao* means wrapping; *ju* means padding. The *Mao Commentary* to the *Book of Songs* states: 'Those who gift fruit must wrap and pad it.'" *Sima* notes: "*Gandu* refers to bamboo slips used for writing letters of inquiry or gifts." They exhaust their spirit on trivial and shallow matters, yet wish to universally guide all things, to unify form and emptiness. Those who do so are deluded by the cosmos, burdened by form, and do not know the Great Beginning. Laboring over trivial and shallow affairs, they seek to lead all things to universal accomplishment, to empty forms to accord with the principle of the Great Unity—yet they are already deluded by the myriad forms of the cosmos, how could they know the wondrous principle of the Great Beginning?

The perfected man, however, returns his spirit to the Beginningless and delights in the darkness of the Land of Nothing-Whatsoever. *Guo* notes: "The Beginningless is the wondrous root; the Land of Nothing-Whatsoever is the realm of the Dao." *Yu* notes: "*Xisheng* reads: '*Ming* is also written as *mian*. It is also pronounced *mian*.' This is correct. *Ming* and *mian* are ancient and modern forms of the same character. The *Wen Xuan*’s *Yangsheng Lun* states: 'Staying awake until dawn without *mian*,' and Li’s commentary notes: '*Mian* is the ancient form of *mian*.' Thus, *ganming* means *ganmian*. The *Xu Wugui* chapter states: 'Sunshu Ao slept sweetly while holding a feather fan.' *Ganmian* and *ganmian* share the same meaning. The *Huainanzi*’s *Chuzhen Xun* states: 'Delighting in sleep in the realm of filth and mire,' which is based on this passage." Water flows where there is no form and vents into the Great Purity. *Xuan* notes: "Emerging from emptiness, returning to emptiness." *Case*: This is a metaphor for the perfected man’s natural flow.

Alas! You take your knowledge to be in the tip of a hair, yet do not know the Great Peace! *You* refers to the "petty man" above. The Great Peace is the realm of effortless tranquility. This speaks of seeing the small and missing the great.

There was a man of Song named Cao Shang who was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his departure, he received several carriages; the King of Qin was pleased with him and added a hundred more carriages. Returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: "Living in a poor alley, weaving sandals in straitened circumstances, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is what I am not good at. Awakening a ruler of ten thousand chariots and following him with a hundred carriages—this is what I am good at." Zhuangzi said: "When the King of Qin was ill, he summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one carriage; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five carriages. The baser the treatment, the more carriages they received. Did you perhaps treat his hemorrhoids? How else did you receive so many carriages? Begone!"

Duke Ai of Lu asked Yan He, saying: "I regard Confucius as the mainstay of the state—will our country then recover?" Yan He replied: "It is perilous, verging on collapse! Confucius adorns feathers and paints them, busying himself with florid words, taking branches for the trunk, treating branch-words as the true purport. He suppresses his nature to display himself before the people, yet knows not how to be trusted. What he receives in his heart, he governs with his spirit—how could this suffice to lead the people! Is he fit for you? Or do you rely on him for sustenance? Even if this were a mistake, it might still be excusable. But now he causes the people to depart from substance and learn falsity—this is no way to guide them. Considering the future, it would be better to cease and not employ him. The state will be difficult to govern."

What is bestowed upon others yet not forgotten is not the Heavenly dispensation. Merchants and traders are held in contempt; though one may engage with them in affairs, in spirit they are still not deemed worthy. Now, to bestow virtue in this manner—how does it differ from commerce?

External punishments are meted out with metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the true person can escape both external and internal punishments.

Confucius said: "The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer, dawn, and dusk—but man has a thick exterior and deep emotions. Thus, some appear earnest yet are arrogant, some seem incompetent yet are truly capable, some are compliant yet sharp and perceptive, some are resolute yet lax, and some are leisurely yet fierce. Therefore, those who rush toward righteousness as if parched may flee from it as if scorched. Thus, the noble person sends them far to observe their loyalty, for distance breeds deceit; brings them near to observe their reverence, for proximity breeds familiarity; burdens them with tasks to observe their ability; suddenly questions them to observe their knowledge; sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness; entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence; warns them of danger to observe their integrity; intoxicates them with wine to observe their decorum; and mingles them in mixed company to observe their demeanor. When all nine tests are complete, even the unworthy reveal themselves."

Zheng Kaofu, upon his first appointment, bent his back; upon his second, stooped; upon his third, bowed low, creeping along the wall—who would dare to act improperly toward him!

As for the common man, upon his first appointment, he stretches himself tall; upon his second, he dances atop his chariot; upon his third, he names others as his uncles—who could compare him to Yao or Xu! The greatest harm lies in virtue having intent and intent having lashes. When virtue has intent, it is no longer natural; when intent has lashes, it is as if riddled with apertures—what ruin could be greater! And when it has lashes, one turns inward to examine, scrutinizing endlessly within the square inch of the heart. Such inward scrutiny leads only to defeat, for it brings the harm of endless distraction.

There are five perilous virtues, with the central virtue foremost—referring to the ear, eye, mouth, nose, and heart, with the heart as chief. What is the central virtue? It is that by which one esteems oneself while disparaging what one does not do. Utter destitution has eight extremes, while success has three certainties, and the body has six repositories.

Beauty, refinement, height, grandeur, strength, splendor, courage, and boldness—when all eight surpass others, one falls into ruin through reliance on them. Compliance, submission, and timid fear—though inferior to others, these three ensure success. Those who extend knowledge outward exhaust their spirit in pursuit of externals. Bold action breeds resentment, and vigorous advance invites enmity. Benevolence and righteousness invite reproach.

Those who grasp the essence of life appear vast; those who grasp knowledge appear small. Those who grasp the great mandate follow; those who grasp the petty mandate endure. A man who had an audience with the King of Song was granted ten chariots, with which he grew arrogant toward Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: "By the river lived a poor family who made their living weaving mats from reeds. Their son dived into the depths and retrieved a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him, 'Bring a stone and smash it! For such a pearl must lie in the ninefold abyss beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you obtained it means you encountered the dragon while it slept. Had the black dragon awakened, what scrap of you would remain?' Now, the depths of the state of Song are far greater than the ninefold abyss, and the ferocity of the King of Song far exceeds that of the black dragon."

"Had you obtained those chariots, you must have encountered the King while he slept. Were the King of Song to awaken, you would be reduced to dust!"

Later, an emissary was sent to Zhuangzi, who replied to the messenger: "Have you seen the sacrificial ox? As the *Cheng* commentary explains, 'Sacrificial oxen are reared for three months prior to being offered in the ancestral temple.' Clad in embroidered robes and fed with fine beans and grasses—yet when led into the great temple, though it might wish to remain a lone calf, could it do so?"

As Zhuangzi neared death, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: "I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, and the ten thousand things as my funeral gifts. Are my burial provisions not already complete? What could be added to them?"

His disciples said: "We fear the crows and kites will devour you."

Zhuangzi replied: "Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by ants and mole crickets. To take from one to give to the other—how partial is that!"

To level the uneven with what is not level—such leveling is itself uneven.

To level the world with partial views—such leveling remains uneven. To govern with what is not governing—such governing is no governance. Guo [Xiang] says: "征 means 'response.'" Cheng [Xuanying] says: "The sage is without intent; when moved, he responds—this is true response. If one responds to things with intent, one cannot truly respond." The enlightened are but servants to things. Cheng says: "Those who flaunt their enlightenment to attend to affairs are driven by things—how can they master others?" The spirit responds to them. Xuan [Ying] says: "Those who follow the spirit’s principle respond without fail wherever they go." That enlightenment cannot surpass spirit has long been so, yet fools rely on what they see and employ their own cunning. They become entangled in others—Xuan says: "Drowned in human affairs"—their merit lies in externals, all their effort bent toward the outer. Is this not lamentable?

**Miscellaneous Chapters, "The World" (Chapter Thirty-Three)**

Those who order the world with methods are many—Cheng says: "方 means 'Way.'" All claim their practices cannot be surpassed—Xuan says: "其有 refers to what they have learned." But where does the ancient Way truly reside? It is said: "Nowhere it is not present."

“”It is asked: “From where does spirit descend? From where does enlightenment emerge?” If it is nowhere not present, then how do spirit-sages and enlightened kings descend and emerge, uniquely distinct from the multitude? Xuan says: “This is another question posed.” “Sages arise from somewhere, kings achieve from somewhere—all originate from the One.” The text below speaks of “the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship.” Xuan says: “This is the answer.”

Not departing from the source is called the celestial person. “Not departing” is like Confucius’ saying that Yan [Hui] did not violate the ancestral master—this refers to the natural. Not departing from essence is called the spirit person. Cheng says: “Unmixed purity is called spiritlike subtlety.” Not departing from the real is called the perfected person. Cheng says: “Unwavering and uncontrived is called the ultimate.”

Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, they foreshadow transformation—transformation beyond reckoning, appearing in things as their inception. These are called sages. Cheng says: “The four types above are but one; their names vary according to their functions.”

Taking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, they are warmly compassionate and humane—these are called exemplary persons. Xuan says: “Exemplary persons are the remnants of the Way.”

Taking law as distinction, names as standards—Xuan says: “Taking legal measures as distinctions, titles and designations as standards”—taking verification as proof—*Shiwen* reads: “Verification, originally written as ‘conduct’”—Xuan says: “Taking the documents they handle as evidence”—taking investigation as decision—Xuan says: “Taking examination of what they handle to decide matters”—their reckoning is one, two, three, four, and so on. Xuan says: “So clear and unerring are they.”

Officials rank one another by these—Xuan says: “This is yet another class of people. ‘Ranking’ means ordering by these. Official posts are the traces of names and laws.” Taking affairs as the constant—affairs refer to daily tasks—taking clothing and food as their chief concern, they multiply and store, caring for the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed, all provided for. “Multiplying” refers to production; “storing” refers to goods and wealth. Their care extends even to those without recourse. This is the governance of the people.

Xuan says: “Yet another class of people.”

The ancients—were they not complete! They matched the divine luminaries, harmonized with Heaven and Earth, nurtured the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, and extended their beneficence to the hundred clans. They were enlightened in the fundamental principles and bound to the derivative measures—Guo says: “When the fundamental principles are clear, the derivatives do not stray.” Their understanding pervaded the six directions and opened the four quarters. Whether in the subtle or the coarse, the great or the small, their operation was present everywhere without exception.

Those whose clarity lay in the numerical measures were preserved in great number by the historians of old laws and transmitted traditions. Xuan says: “This refers to how the historians transmitted them.” Those found in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music* were widely elucidated by the scholars of Zou and Lu and the girdle-wearing masters. The *shi* were Confucians; the *jinshen xiansheng* were those who held office. Cheng says: “*Jin* means tablet, or to insert; *shen* means sash.” Xuan says: “This refers to how the Six Classics were transmitted.” The *Odes* guide the will, the *Documents* guide affairs, the *Rites* guide conduct, the *Music* guides harmony, the *Changes* guides the yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn* guides names and duties.

Their principles, dispersed throughout the world and established in the Central States—*she* means to apply—were at times praised and expounded by the various schools. Xuan says: “This refers to how the Hundred Schools transmitted them.”

When the world fell into great disorder, the worthy and sagely withdrew their light and concealed their traces. Virtue and the Dao were no longer unified, and the world grasped at partial insights to take pride in. Each partial insight was like the clarity of the ear, eye, nose, or mouth, each possessing its own illumination but unable to communicate with the others. So too were the various arts of the Hundred Schools, each possessing its own excellence and occasional utility. Yet they were neither comprehensive nor all-encompassing, being but partial scholars.

They divided the beauty of Heaven and Earth, dissected the principles of the myriad things, and examined the wholeness of the ancients. Few could fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the divine luminaries. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship grew dim and unclear, repressed and unexpressed. The people of the world each followed their own desires to create their own methods.

How lamentable! The Hundred Schools departed and did not return, and their paths must diverge. Later scholars, unfortunate in not witnessing the purity of Heaven and Earth or the great essence of the ancients, will see the Dao and its arts torn asunder by the world.

They did not indulge in extravagance for later generations, nor waste themselves on the myriad things, nor seek brilliance in numerical measures. Xuan says: “They did not display luxury, did not engage in wastefulness, did not pursue ostentation.” They used the inked cord to correct themselves. Cheng says: “*Jiao* means to refine. They used benevolence and righteousness as the inked cord to refine their conduct.” Thus, they prepared for the world’s emergencies. Guo says: “Diligence and frugality leave wealth in surplus, so emergencies are provided for.” Among the ancient arts of the Dao, some were like this.

Mo Di and Qin Guli heard of this approach and delighted in it. Mo Di, a grandee of Song, advocated simplicity and frugality. Qin Guli, a disciple of Mo Di, rejected the music of the Five Emperors and Three Kings,嫌其奢侈. They carried it to excess, merely following their own inclinations. Their excesses were but their own extreme compliance, insufficient to teach the world. They created *Fei Le* and called it *Jie Yong*. In life, they did not sing; in death, they wore no mourning. Cheng says: “*Fei Le* and *Jie Yong* are two chapters in the writings of Mozi. Not singing in life is why they rejected music; wearing no mourning in death is why they advocated frugality.” By this, they meant no funerary garments such as shrouds, coffins, or outer coffins.

Mozi advocated universal love and mutual benefit while opposing strife. Guo says: “When the hundred clans are all diligent and frugal, each with surplus, they take strife to be wrong.” His Way did not involve anger. Cheng says: “They mastered themselves, so they did not resent or rage at things.” They also loved learning broadly but were not tolerant of differences. Guo says: “Having already taken themselves as correct, they wished all things to be the same as themselves.” They did not align with the former kings, nor did they approve of them. They disparaged the rites and music of antiquity. Guo says: “They嫌其奢靡.” The Yellow Emperor had *Xian Chi*, Yao had *Da Zhang*, Shun had *Da Shao*, Yu had *Da Xia*, Tang had *Da Huo*, King Wen had the music of the *Bi Yong*, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou created *Wu*.

In the mourning rites of old, the noble and base had their proper forms, the high and low their proper ranks. The Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, the grand officers three, and the officers two. Yet Mozi alone, in life, did not sing, and in death, wore no mourning. He used a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin as his model. Teaching others thus, he surely did not love them; practicing it himself, he certainly did not love himself.

Guo Xiang says: “This both violates human nature and places oneself in meagerness.” Yet Mozi’s Way has not failed—indeed, Mozi’s Way has not yet failed. Nevertheless, to sing yet not truly sing, to weep yet not truly weep, to rejoice yet not truly rejoice—is this truly akin to human nature? Is this truly in accord with human sentiment? In life, they toil; in death, they are meager. Their Way is excessively harsh. Guo Songtao says: “The *Shuowen* glosses *hu* as ‘exhausted.’ The *Guanzi*’s ‘Di Yuan’ chapter reads: ‘The next is called the Five *Hu*.’ *Hu* means meager.” It causes people sorrow, it causes people grief. Its practice is difficult to sustain. I fear it cannot be the Way of the sage, for it turns against the hearts of the world, and the world cannot endure it. Though Mozi alone could bear it and practice it himself, what of the world? Separated from the world, he is far from the kingly Way. Guo Xiang says: “This is not the Way of the king.”

Mozi spoke of the Way, declaring its origins: “In ancient times, Yu dammed the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the roads to the four barbarians and the Nine Provinces. Three hundred famous rivers—Yu Yue says: ‘*Mountains* should be *rivers*, a scribal error. This passage speaks solely of rivers and should not mention tributaries while omitting the great rivers. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s ‘Shi Lan’ chapter and the *Huainanzi*’s ‘Di Xing Xun’ both say *six hundred* famous rivers.’—three thousand tributaries, and countless smaller streams. Yu personally wielded the basket and plowshare, channeling the waters of all the world’s rivers together.” Lu Deming’s *Exegesis* says: “*Gao* was formerly read as *gu kao*; Cui and Guo read it as *tuo*, so it should be written as *tuo*. Sima Biao says: ‘A vessel for carrying earth.’ *Si* is read as *si*; the *San Cang* says: ‘The iron tip of a plow.’ Cui says: ‘A mallet.’ Sima Biao says: ‘A vessel for holding water.’ *Nine* is also written as *jiu*, meaning ‘to gather.’” Guo Songtao says: “To merge the waters of all rivers into the great rivers is called *jiu za*.” His calves bore no flesh, his shins no hair. He bathed in heavy rains, combed his hair in fierce winds, and established the ten thousand states. Having thus settled the ten thousand states, Yu—a great sage—yet wearied his body for the world in this way.”

The later Mohists mostly wore coarse furs and hempen cloth, bound their feet with straw sandals—Cheng Xuanying says: “The later Mohists were Mozi’s disciples. *Qiu he* means rough clothing; wooden sandals are called *qi*, straw sandals *qiao*.”—and toiled day and night without rest, taking self-affliction as their utmost principle. They said: “If one cannot do this, it is not Yu’s Way and is unworthy of being called Mohist.” Thus Mozi admonished his followers.

Xiangli Qin’s disciples, the followers of Wu Hou—Cheng Xuanying says: “Xiangli was his surname, Qin his given name, a Mohist master of the southern regions. Wu Hou were fellow Mohist scholars.”—and the likes of Han Fei’s *Xian Xue* chapter: “There were the Mohists of the Xiangli clan, the Xiangfu clan, and the Xiangling clan.”—Ku Huo, Ji Chi, and Deng Lingzi all recited the Mohist canon—Li Yi says: “Ku Huo and Ji Chi were the names of two individuals.” Note: *Deng Ling* may be *Xiang Ling*, a corruption due to similar graphs—but their interpretations diverged, each calling the other “deviant Mohists.” *Bei jue* means perverse and cunning, each claiming to be a separate Mohist faction. They debated *jian bai* and *tong yi*, Guo Xiang says: “Refuting each other’s arguments,” and responded to one another with *ji ou* and *bu wu* propositions—Guo Xiang says: “Affirming one side.” *Ji* is the same as *qi*. Lu Deming’s *Exegesis* says: “*Wu* means ‘same.’” Note: Odd and even are inherently different, yet forcing them to correspond makes anything possible to equate. They revered the *juzi* as sages—Guo Xiang says: “The *juzi* were the Mohists’ foremost disciples.” Lu Deming’s *Exegesis* says: “Like the Confucians’ great scholars.”—all wishing to be their successors—Cheng Xuanying says: “To serve as their leaders.”—hoping to become their heirs—Guo Xiang says: “Aspiring to continue their lineage.”—and to this day, their disputes remain unresolved—Guo Xiang says: “Their teachings have not ceased.”

Mozi and Qin Guli’s intentions were correct, but their conduct was not—Cheng Xuanying says: “Their aim was to save the world, which is why they were right; but they went too far, which is why they were wrong.” They would compel later Mohists to wear themselves out with calves devoid of flesh and shins devoid of hair, competing with one another in this. Such conduct is the height of disorder and the lowest form of governance—Guo Xiang says: “Their crime in disordering the world is great, while their merit in governing it is small.” Nevertheless, Mozi was truly one who loved the world, truly one who could love others—Yu Yue says: “This echoes Mencius’ idea of ‘Mozi’s universal love.’” If one sought such a person, one would not find him; if one sought a way to save the world, would one not find it? The words *ye* and *ye* were interchangeable in ancient times—Yu Yue says: “This echoes the idea of ‘sincerely seeking it.’” Even if it meant withering away, he would not abandon it—even if his body withered, he could not bear to let go—Yu Yue says: “This echoes Mencius’ idea of ‘grinding his head and heels smooth for it.’” What a man of consummate talent! One might call him a man who exhausted his talents. Unburdened by custom, unshackled by things. Unadorned by externals, not artificially refined. Uncompromising with others, never careless. Unresentful of the crowd, harboring no malice. He desired the world’s peace and stability to preserve the lives of the people, placing the world’s living beings above all. Once the sustenance of self and others was fully met, he stopped, not seeking excess. In this, he bared his heart—Guo Xiang says: “Revealing his unadulterated intent.”—and in this lay the ancient arts of the Way.

Song Jian and Yin Wen heard of his teachings and delighted in them—Cheng Xuanying says: “Song and Yin were contemporaries of King Xuan of Qi, both studying at the Jixia Academy.”

(Note: The *Hanshu*’s *Yiwenzhi* lists them under the School of Names.) Song Jian authored one treatise, Yin Wen two, both taking the common people as their teachers and deriving their names therefrom. Their nature aligned with their teachings, so upon hearing of his Way, they delighted in and cherished it.

They wore the cap of Mount Hua as a personal emblem—Guo [Xiang] says: “Mount Hua is level above and below.”—and began their engagement with the myriad things by dispelling obstructions. *Shiwen* [notes]: “‘Began’ means ‘to take as the first step.’ Cui [Zhuan] says: ‘To distinguish good and evil, while overlooking what lies beyond.’” They spoke of the heart’s capacity, naming it “the heart’s conduct”—Cheng [Xuanying] says: “‘Naming’ here means ‘to designate.’ Every utterance and word should allow the heart to embrace the myriad things; this capacity to receive is called the heart’s conduct.” (Note: This means that as my heart is, so too is the conduct I extend to others.)

They sought harmony to foster joy—*Shiwen*: “‘Harmony’: Cui [Zhuan] reads it as *er*, Guo [Xiang] as *er*. Sima [Biao] says: ‘A look of deep sincerity.’ Cui, Guo, and Wang [Bi] say: ‘Harmony.’ To harmonize the myriad things is to bring them together in joy.”—and to bring order to the world, compelling others to be governed by their Way. They urged rulers to adopt it as their guiding principle, entreating all contemporary lords to make this heart their foundation.

They endured insult without shame, refusing to call it humiliation. They rescued the people from strife, forbidding aggression and halting warfare to end the world’s battles—*Shiwen*: “‘Halting’ means ‘to cease.’” With this, they traversed the world, persuading the high and instructing the low. Though the world did not accept their teachings, they did not abandon them, persisting tirelessly. Thus it is said: “Though rejected by high and low, they pressed on insistently.” The “high” refers to contemporary rulers; the “low,” to their ministers.

Yet for all this, they did too much for others and too little for themselves, for their words were as follows: “We ask only that five *sheng* of rice be set aside as sufficient. Though the master may fear it will not fill him, and though we disciples may go hungry, we do not forget the world.”—Cheng [Xuanying] says: “Song and Yin called the common people ‘masters’ and referred to themselves as ‘disciples,’ placing others before themselves.” (Note: This refers to Song and Yin’s request for provisions, saying they asked only that five *sheng* of rice be set aside for the master.) Day and night they did not rest, declaring: “We must surely save them!” How lofty their ambition as saviors of the world!

Xuan [Yuan] says: “Again, they said, ‘We must surely find a way to sustain ourselves!’—plotting to preserve the lives of the people, they were haughty as saviors of the world.”

It is said: “The noble person does not engage in petty scrutiny, nor does he lend himself to things.” To deem something of no benefit to the world is to declare that illuminating it is worse than abandoning it. Again, it is said: “The noble person ought not be overly exacting, thus he disregards contempt and disdain, refusing to borrow external things for his own sake.” Therefore, he does not calculate hunger or satiety, while others all flaunt their own discernment. Yet if one calculates and compares too much, though it may benefit the world, none will act upon it. Thus, Song and Yin held that those who offer no benefit to the world are better off not illuminating things at all.

They took the prohibition of attack and the cessation of arms as external matters—Xuan says: “Externally, they saved the world through this.”—and the restraint of desires and their moderation as internal matters—Xuan says: “Internally, they mastered themselves through this.” In their great and small, refined and coarse aspects, their conduct extended no further than this. If their conduct stopped here, then the greatness or smallness, refinement or coarseness of their Way and arts also went no further.

Impartial yet not partisan—Cui’s edition reads “partisan” (*dang*), with the note: “Utterly impartial, without partisanship.” Lu says: “‘Not partisan’ (*bu dang*) is correct.”—easygoing and without self-interest—Cheng says: “Level and easy.”—decisive yet without fixed bias—Xuan says: “Cutting away entanglements, without partiality.”—they followed things without duality—Xuan says: “Following things as they go, without divided intent.”—they did not dwell on deliberation, nor scheme with knowledge, without sidelong glances or cunning plots. Toward things, they made no distinctions, but went along with them. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, some lay precisely here.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of this approach and delighted in it—Cheng says: “All were recluses of Qi, who gathered at Jixia and each composed several chapters of writings.” Yu says: “According to the text below, Peng Meng was likely Tian Pian’s teacher. The *Yi Lin* quotes the *Yin Wenzi* as recording Peng Meng’s words: ‘Pheasants and hares in the wild are all pursued because their apportionment is not yet settled; chickens and pigs fill the market, yet none covet them, for their apportionment is fixed.’”

They took the equalization of the ten thousand things as their foremost principle—Xuan says: “They made this their primary concern.”—and declared: “Heaven can cover them but cannot bear them; earth can bear them but cannot cover them; the great Dao can encompass them but cannot distinguish them.” Knowing that the ten thousand things each have what they can and cannot do, they said: “Selection does not reach all, for there must be some left unselected. Teaching does not extend fully, for there must be some who do not receive it. Only the Dao leaves nothing out.” Only the Dao encompasses all—this is what is meant by equalization.

Thus, Shen Dao—Yu says: “The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s ‘Biographies of Meng and Xun’ state: ‘Shen Dao was a man of Zhao who composed twelve discourses.’ The *Han History*’s ‘Treatise on Arts and Letters’ lists among the Legalists ‘*Shenzi* in forty-two chapters. His name was Dao, and he preceded Shen Buhai and Han Fei, who cited him.’”—abandoned knowledge and discarded the self—Cheng says: “Stilled thoughts, abandoned knowledge, forgot the body, and discarded the self.”—and followed what could not be avoided, sifting through things to establish his principles—*Shiwen* says: “*Lingtai* means the same as sifting (*shatai*). *Ling* is pronounced *ling*.”—with the note: “Though Shen Dao abandoned knowledge and discarded the self, he still relied on what could not be avoided, sifting through people and things to uphold this as his principle.”

He said: “To know without knowing—this is to come close to knowledge and then nearly harm it.” His words were: “In all matters of knowing others, one should act as if one does not know. To come close to having some knowledge is already to approach harming it.” This was Shen Dao’s abandonment of knowledge—Cheng says: “‘Near’ (*lin*) means close.”

Crooked and unsteady, he mocked the world’s esteem for worthies—*Shiwen* says: “*Xike* means the appearance of being askew and unsteady.”—with the note: “Though his use of people was crooked and unsteady, without anyone to employ, he laughed at the world’s reverence for worthies.” Unrestrained and without conduct, he condemned the world’s great sages. In himself, he was dissolute and careless, without conduct to commend, yet he dismissed the world’s great sages, lowering them with no lofty discourse.

Pounding and patting, rounding and severing, he turned with things—Guo says: “Still like pounding and patting, he had not yet merged completely.”—*Shiwen* says: “*Wan* means round.”—with the note: Guo’s explanation of *pounding and patting* refers to striking like a mallet. If things were not yet in harmony, he would pound and pat them heavily, leaving none unaligned. This is the meaning of *pounding and patting*—forcing what does not align to align. *Rounding and severing* means that though things were cut, they remained perfectly round, with no trace of rupture, all in accord with the idea of turning with things. This was Shen Dao’s discarding of the self.

Abandoning right and wrong, he did whatever could avoid harm—Xuan says: “Not clinging to right and wrong, he hoped to avoid entanglement.”—he did not model himself on knowledge or deliberation, nor did he consider before or after—*Shiwen* says: “The first *zhi* is pronounced as *intelligence*.”—with the note: “He did not model himself on others’ knowledge or deliberation, nor did he inquire into the before or after of affairs.” He stood towering and alone. Impartial and easygoing, he could thus stand lofty and firm.

Pushed, he then moved; pulled, he then went—like the returning of a whirlwind—Xuan says: “Revolving without direction.”—like the spinning of a feather—Xuan says: “A feather falling from the sky, spinning without end.”—like the groove of a grindstone—The groove of a grindstone is smooth, an analogy for its flawless motion. Whole and without fault, he could thus preserve himself without incurring blame. In movement and stillness, he committed no transgressions. Still without transgression, in motion also without transgression—how could blame arise?

Why was this so?—A hypothetical question, asking why he could be thus.—For things without knowledge, there is no trouble of establishing the self, no burden of employing knowledge. In movement and stillness, they do not depart from principle, and thus they pass their lives without praise. Things without knowledge—such as wood and stone.

Speaking in analogy to those things without knowledge: they do not establish the self as a standard, and thus avoid the trouble of being pointed at or singled out; they do not employ wisdom to speculate upon one another, and thus escape the burden of envy and jealousy. Moved, they are in motion; set down, they are at rest—ever unseparated from the principle of things, plain and easily seen. Therefore, throughout their lives, none praise them. Without praise, there is also no blame.

Thus it is said: “It comes down to being like things without knowledge.” This is to say, it is carried to its utmost. “There is no need for worthies and sages—for even a clod of earth does not lose the Dao.” Why employ worthies and sages? Even a lump of soil does not lose the Way.

The eminent and powerful mocked them, saying: “The Way of Shen Dao is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—it is nothing but bizarre.” Those among the eminent and powerful who could engage with his teachings would laugh together, saying: “Shenzi’s Way is not the conduct of the living but rather the principle of the dead—it is only enough to elicit the world’s astonishment.” Tian Pian was the same; his words were identical, and Shen Dao is mentioned to include Tian Pian.

He studied under Peng Meng and received the teaching of “no-teaching.” The teaching of no-teaching: one observes his conduct and learns from it, so that the heart attains understanding on its own. To mention Meng’s disciple along with his teacher is to make Peng Meng’s position clear.

Peng Meng’s teacher said: “The Daoists of antiquity reached the point where none affirmed them and none denied them.” This is no different from Shen Dao’s saying “it comes down to being like things without knowledge.” “Their influence was swift as the wind—how could it be put into words?” Xiang and Guo said: “窢 is the sound of wind blowing against something.” The influence and teaching of the ancient Daoists passed swiftly—how could they be transmitted in words?

They constantly opposed others, remaining unseen and unobserved, always countering the opinions and discussions of others, never appearing admirable in their eyes. The text below says: “Taking opposition to others as their substance.” Yet they could not avoid making judgments. Even when compelled to decide, they could only adapt to things, and thus could not escape Shen Dao’s cautious and rigid judgments.

Their so-called Dao was not the Dao, and what they spoke as right was not without error. Guo said: “韪 means ‘right.’” Note: This refers to the words of Peng Meng’s teacher—what was right in them still contained error, and the Dao remained unseen.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao. Thus, these three can simply be said not to have known the Dao. Nevertheless, in broad terms, they had once heard of it. Yet considering their general drift, they had once received old teachings. For instance, “abandoning knowledge and relinquishing the self” must have come from some teacher—only their theories drifted ever further from it.

Impartial yet not partisan—Cui’s edition has “黨,” explaining: “Utterly impartial, without faction.” Lu said: “‘不黨’ is correct.” Easygoing and without self-interest, Cheng said: “Level and easy.” Decisive and without attachment, Xuan said: “Cutting off entanglements, without partiality.” Following things without duality, Xuan said: “Following things as they go, without divided intent.” Unconcerned with deliberation, unplanned by knowledge—without sidelong glances, without clever schemes. Making no distinctions among things, going along with them—this was where the Daoist arts of antiquity lay.

Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of this influence and delighted in it. Cheng said: “All were recluses of Qi, gathering at Jixia, each composing several chapters.” Yu said: “According to the text below, Peng Meng was likely Tian Pian’s teacher. The *Yi Lin* quotes the *Yin Wenzi* as having Peng Meng say: ‘When pheasants and hares are in the wild, everyone chases them because their share is not yet fixed; when chickens and pigs fill the market, no one desires them because their share is already fixed.’”

They took the equalization of the ten thousand things as their foremost principle. Xuan said: “They took this as their primary matter.” They said: “Heaven can cover them but cannot bear them; earth can bear them but cannot cover them; the great Dao can encompass them but cannot distinguish them.” Knowing that the ten thousand things each have what they can and cannot do, they said: “Selection is not all-encompassing—there must be those left unselected. Teaching does not reach all—there must be those who do not receive it. Only the Dao leaves nothing out.” Only the Dao encompasses all—this is what is meant by equalization.

Thus Shen Dao—Yu said: “The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s ‘Biographies of Mencius and Xunzi’ state: ‘Shen Dao was from Zhao and composed twelve essays.’ The *Han History*’s ‘Treatise on Arts and Letters’ lists among the Legalists ‘forty-two chapters of the *Shenzi*. His name was Dao, and he preceded Shen Buhai and Han Fei, who cited him.’”—abandoned knowledge and relinquished the self. Cheng said: “Ceasing deliberation, abandoning knowledge, forgetting the body, relinquishing the self.” Yet he followed what could not be avoided, sifting through things to establish his principle. The *Shiwen* says: “泠汰 is like sifting.” Note: Though Shen Dao abandoned knowledge and relinquished the self, he still acted when compelled, sifting through things to establish his principle.

He said: “Knowing the unknowable—this is to approach knowledge thinly and then draw near to harm.” His words said: “In the Dao of knowing others, one should act as if one does not know. To approach knowledge even thinly is already to draw near to harm.” This was Shen Dao’s abandonment of knowledge. Cheng said: “邻 means ‘near.’”

Crooked and unsteady, bearing no responsibility, he laughed at the world’s esteem for worthies. Though in himself unrestrained and dissolute, without conduct to commend, he denied the world’s great sages, belittling them without lofty discourse. With blunt and rigid judgments, adapting to things, Guo said: “Still retaining bluntness, not yet perfectly merged.”

The *Shiwen* annotates: “輐 means ‘round.’” The case explains: Guo’s gloss of *zhuīpāi* (椎拍) refers to striking like a mallet. When any thing is not yet fully aligned, one strikes it heavily with a mallet, and it will align without fail. This is the meaning of *zhuīpāi*—to force the unaligned into alignment. *Yuànduàn* (輐断) means that though a decision is made, it is exceedingly round, leaving no trace of rupture, all in accord with the intent to adapt to things. This was Shen Dao’s relinquishing of the self.

Abandoning right and wrong, he acted merely to avoid harm. Xuan comments: “Not clinging to right and wrong, he sought to be free of entanglement.” He did not model himself on wisdom or foresight, nor did he consider before and after. The *Shiwen* notes: “The first *zhi* is read as ‘wisdom.’” The case explains: He did not follow others’ wisdom or foresight, nor inquire into the sequence of events. He remained towering and unmoved. Vast and impartial, he could stand loftily. He moved only when pushed, advanced only when dragged—like a whirling wind, Xuan comments: “Turning without fixed direction”; like a feather’s spiral, Xuan comments: “A feather falling from the sky, spinning without cease”; like the groove of a millstone, its path worn smooth by grinding. Whole and without fault, he could preserve himself without incurring blame. In movement and stillness, he committed no transgression, and thus never incurred guilt. How was this so? A rhetorical question: How could he achieve this? For a thing without knowledge—free from the peril of establishing the self, free from the burden of employing knowledge—its movement and stillness never deviate from principle, and thus it remains without praise throughout its life. A thing without knowledge, like wood or stone, does not establish the self as a standard, so it avoids the peril of being singled out; it does not use wisdom to speculate, so it escapes the burden of envy. Moved, it moves; set down, it is still—always in accord with the principle of things, plain and evident. Thus, no one praises it throughout its life, and without praise, it also avoids fault. Hence it is said: “To be like a thing without knowledge—this is the utmost of Shen Dao’s teaching. There is no need for worthies and sages, for even a clod of earth does not lose the Dao.” Why employ worthies and sages? Even a lump of soil does not stray from the Dao.

The proud and eminent mocked him, saying: “Shen Dao’s Way is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—it merely invites strangeness.” The bold and distinguished among his contemporaries laughed together, saying: “Shen Dao’s Way is not the conduct of the living but leads to the principle of the dead—it only earns the world’s bewilderment.” Tian Pian was the same; his words were identical, so Shen Dao is cited to encompass him as well.

He studied under Peng Meng and attained the teaching of non-teaching. The teaching of non-teaching: observing his conduct, one learned and grasped it inwardly. Mentioning Meng’s disciple and teacher, Meng’s own views may be inferred. Peng Meng’s teacher said: “The Daoists of antiquity reached the point of neither affirming nor negating.” This is no different from Shen Dao’s words, “to be like a thing without knowledge.” Their influence was swift and fleeting—how could it be put into words? Xiang and Guo comment: “窢 is the sound of wind blowing against.” The teaching of the ancient Daoists passed swiftly, like a gust—how could it be transmitted in words? They constantly opposed others, remaining unseen, constantly countering others’ opinions without being observed or admired. As stated below: “Taking opposition to others as their substance.” Yet they could not avoid *yuànduàn* (輐断). Even when compelled to make decisions, they still adapted to things, unable to escape Shen Dao’s *yuànduàn*. *Yuàn* (輐) and *●* share the same sound and meaning.

What they called the Dao was not the Dao, and what they spoke as right was not free from wrong. Guo comments: “韪 means ‘right.’” The case explains: Peng Meng’s teacher’s words contained rightness within wrongness, for they did not truly grasp the Dao. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao. Thus, these three may simply be said not to have known the Dao. Nevertheless, in broad strokes, they had once heard of it. Yet though they had once received some instruction—for instance, in “abandoning knowledge and relinquishing the self”—their theories strayed ever further from its thread.

They took the root as refined and things as coarse. Cheng comments: “The root is nonbeing; things are being. Using nonbeing as the wondrous Dao is refined; using being as affairs and objects is coarse.” They regarded accumulation as insufficient. Guo comments: “Entrusting all to the world, they had more than enough.” Serene and alone, they dwelled with spirit and illumination. Xuan comments: “This is the teaching of emptiness and nonaction.” Among the Daoist arts of antiquity, there were those who practiced this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their influence and delighted in it.

The *Shiwen* annotates: “Guan Yin was Guan Ling Yin Xi, also said to be Yin Xi, styled Gongdu. Lao Dan was Laozi, who wrote nineteen chapters for Yin Xi.” Cheng comments: “During the reign of King Ping of Zhou, he was the magistrate of Hangu Pass, hence called Guan Yin.” Yu comments: “The *Han History*’s *Treatise on the Arts* lists *Guan Yinzi* in nine chapters, with a note: ‘Named Xi, he was an official at the pass.’ Some take Yin Xi as a compound name, which is incorrect. The *Han History* does not record a nineteen-chapter work by Laozi. The *Annals of Lü Buwei*, in the chapter ‘Without Duality,’ states: ‘Guan Yin valued purity,’ with Gao’s commentary: ‘Guan Yin was the magistrate of the pass, named Xi. Skilled in divining winds and omens, he knew a divine man would arrive, and when Laozi came, Xi delighted in him and requested the writing of the *Shangzhi Jing* in five thousand words.’ The title *Shangzhi Jing* is not found elsewhere.”

They established their teaching on constant nonbeing and nonhaving, and took the Great Unity as their foundation. Cheng comments: “They established their doctrine on the constancy of nonbeing, and grasped its essence in the emptiness of the Great Unity.”

Embodying gentleness, humility, and deference as their outward form, and embracing emptiness and non-destruction of the myriad things as their inner reality. Cheng comments: “Outward form refers to external conduct. They took softness, weakness, humility, and harmony as the external manifestations of their wisdom and skill, while regarding empty kindness and all-encompassing clarity as the inner virtue of their true wisdom.”

Guan Yin said: “Abiding nowhere in oneself, the forms of things naturally manifest.” Xuan comments: “With no private agenda of one’s own, one moves in harmony with things as they appear.” Their movement was like water, their stillness like a mirror, their response like an echo. Xuan comments: “All arise from having no fixed intent.” Fading away like something vanished, serene like purity itself, those who harmonized with them found accord, while those who sought to possess them lost them. Xuan comments: “Harmony comes from merging with things; loss comes from self-assertion.” Never taking the lead, they constantly followed others. Cheng comments: “Harmonizing without initiating.”

Laozi said: “Knowing the masculine, yet guarding the feminine,” Xuan comments: “Abiding in what seems incapable while possessing ability.” “becoming the world’s valley stream.” Xuan comments: “Dwelling in lowliness to receive all, possessing without accumulation.” “Knowing the white, yet guarding the disgraced,” “pure yet not self-righteous in purity,” “becoming the world’s valley.” Xuan comments: “Abiding in emptiness to receive all, responding without hoarding.”

While others all sought to be first, they alone took the rear, saying: “I bear the world’s filth.” While others all sought fullness, they alone embraced emptiness, possessing nothing yet having abundance, standing alone in self-sufficiency with abundance. Guo comments: “This is what it means to be independent and self-sufficient.” Xuan comments: “This is an emphatic reiteration.” In conducting themselves, they moved slowly yet expended nothing. Xuan comments: “Not taking the lead, they moved slowly. Not leading meant fewer affairs; fewer affairs meant no waste.” They practiced non-action and yet mocked cleverness. Non-action appeared clumsy, yet it could deride those who relied on skill.

While others all sought fortune, they alone bent to preserve wholeness, saying: “Merely avoiding blame.” While others ceaselessly pursued fortune, they alone yielded to safeguard their integrity, saying: “Simply to evade misfortune.” Taking depth as their root and restraint as their guiding principle, Cheng comments: “Taking profound mystery as the root of their virtue, and frugality as the guiding thread of their conduct.” They declared: “What is hard will break; what is sharp will blunt.” Always tolerant toward things, never cutting others down, Cheng comments: “Content with their lot and adhering to their place, they never encroached upon others.” This may be called the ultimate attainment. (The original text reads “though not yet,” stating: “Changed following Li’s edition.”)

Ah, Guan Yin and Laozi! Truly the vast and authentic perfected ones of antiquity!

Vast and formless, ever-changing and constant—death and life alike! Heaven and earth together with me! As the "Qi Wu Lun" states: "Heaven and earth are born together with me." The numinous and bright go forth—where do they wander in their boundless haze? Where do they drift in their sudden swiftness? The numinous and bright depart, yet none know their destination. All things are wholly encompassed—Xuan comments: "Nothing is left unembraced." Yet none can serve as their refuge, for there is no place to return.

Among the Daoist arts of antiquity, some resided in this. Zhuang Zhou heard of their influence and delighted in it. With discourses remote and drifting—Shiwen notes: "As if forgetting all concrete reality"—and words vast and empty, boundless and without edge, he spoke without traceable beginning or visible limit. At times, he gave free rein to his thoughts without constraint—Shiwen reads "and sudden," omitting "not," which is closer to the mark. He meant that his words arrived in a flash, not displaying themselves through partiality. Xuan comments: "He did not present himself through one-sided views." Cheng comments: "Partiality means lack of balance."

Taking the world as turbid and murky, he deemed it unfit for solemn discourse. Solemn discourse refers to straightforward argument. Instead, he used goblet words to flow and extend, weighty words as truth, and parables to broaden meaning. Since the world could not bear solemn discourse, he employed these three modes of speech, as previously seen in the "Yu Yan" chapter. "Flowing and extending" means to follow the principles of things and develop them further, as in "goblet words arise daily, thus flowing and extending." Weighty words recount the sayings of the venerable, making listeners accept them as true—hence they "serve to complete speech." Parables expand the listener’s understanding, as in "borrowing external views to discuss them."

Alone, he communed with the spirit of heaven and earth, his own spirit moving in concert with the cosmos, dwelling in the loftiest realm. Yao comments: "Zhuangzi regarded Guan Yin and Laozi as no more than the perfected ones described at the chapter’s outset as 'not departing from the real'—still not the ultimate. But Zhuang Zhou, in his solitary communion with the spirit of heaven and earth, was one of those called 'not departing from the source, known as the celestial person.'" Yet he did not look down upon the myriad things, never harboring disdain or arrogance toward them. "Looking down" is synonymous with "haughty contempt." He did not reproach right or wrong, thus dwelling among the common world. Cheng comments: "Reproach means to blame."

Though his writings were magnificent and wondrous, they flowed in harmony without harm. Shiwen notes: "Magnificent and wondrous: extraordinary. Flowing in harmony: some read as 'joyful,' others as 'following.' It means following things without opposition, hence no harm." Though his words were uneven, their strangeness and marvels were worth beholding. Cheng comments: "Uneven means sometimes empty, sometimes full, not uniform in speech. Strange and marvelous refers to their wit and humor."

His fullness could not be restrained, for his words and principles were so abundant they could not be contained. Above, he roamed with the Creator, and below, he befriended those who stood beyond life and death, beyond beginning and end. In his fundamentals, he was vast and expansive, profound and unconstrained. Xuan comments: "Unconstrained means unrestrained." In his adherence to the source, he may be called harmonious and ascending. Shiwen notes: "Harmonious is read as 'tiao,' also written as 'tiao.'" Case: "Ascending means to reach or attain." Thus, in his devotion to the source, he may be said to have achieved harmony and risen to the heights. Su Yu comments: "This is what the chapter’s outset calls 'not departing from the source.'"

Yet though he responded to transformation and dissolved into things, his principles never exhausted, his presence never faded. Vague and obscure, who could fathom him to the end? Though he adapted to change and dissolved into the nature of things, his function never ceased, his coming never left behind. Dim and indistinct, none could fully grasp his mysteries.

Hui Shi was versatile in many arts—arts meaning methods. His writings filled five carts, a testament to their abundance. Yet his Way was contradictory and variegated. Guo Qingfan notes: "The original text reads 'contradictory' as 'chuan.' The Wen Xuan’s commentary on the 'Wei Du Fu' cites Sima Biao: 'Chuan is read as contradictory. Variegated means mixed and uneven.' The same note appears here, with one variant reading 'contradictory and erratic.' The Fa Yan’s preface states: 'The various masters each let their knowledge run erratic.' The Huainanzi’s 'Chu Zhen Xun' says: 'The two alternate, contradictory and erratic.' The 'Fan Lun Xun' reads: 'Sights and sounds are contradictory and erratic externally.' The 'Shuo Shan Xun' has 'divergent streams run erratic,' cited in the Yu Pian as '● erratic,' with the same meaning." His words never hit the mark. "Hit the mark" is read as "zhong."

The purport of "examining things" is as follows:

It states: "That which examines the purport of events and things has its sayings.

The supremely great has no exterior—this is called the Great Unity.
The supremely small has no interior—this is called the Small Unity.
He fabricated the Small Unity to pair with the Great Unity.

That which has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet its greatness spans a thousand *li*.

Sima [Biao] notes: 'If it could be accumulated, how would it be limited to a thousand *li*!'

Heaven and earth are base; mountains and marshes are level.
Heaven and earth share a single principle; mountains and marshes are equally balanced.

The sun is just at its zenith even as it inclines; things are just being born even as they die.

Cheng [Xuanying] explains: 'Inclining means to view from the side. Those in the west call it the center, while those in the east call it the side—thus there is no true center or side. It is like life and death: the living take death as death, while the dead take life as death. Since the sun’s center and side are not distinct, so too are life and death without difference.'

The great similarity differs from the small similarity—this is called the small similarity and difference.
To call it great similarity while differing from small similarity is to mix similarity and difference, yet it is still termed the small similarity and difference.

All things are entirely similar and entirely different—this is called the great similarity and difference.
For example, cold and heat, day and night—these are all things entirely similar and entirely different, and thus are called the great similarity and difference.

The southern direction is without limit yet has a limit.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'To call it "south" already imposes a boundary; this is to take one example and infer the other three.'

Today I go to Yue yet arrived yesterday.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'Knowing there is a time to reach Yue, the mind has already arrived beforehand.'
Note: This passage also appears in the "Qi Wu Lun" chapter, where "arrived" is written as "reached."

Linked rings can be undone.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: 'The rings interlock through emptiness, not through the rings themselves. Thus, two rings pass through the void without intersecting, each turning freely—hence they can be undone.'

I know the center of the world: it is north of Yan and south of Yue.
This suggests the earth is suspended in the center, and by land one may reach it—thus north of Yan is south of Yue, differing from Zou Yan’s discourse on the "Ying Sea."

Embrace all things with universal love, for heaven and earth are one body.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'Heaven and earth are not great, nor am I small.'

Hui Shi took these as a grand vision of the world and used them to enlighten the debaters; the debaters of the world delighted in them.
Hui considered himself uniquely perceptive of the world’s principles and used these to instruct the debaters, who in turn took pleasure in them.

Eggs have feathers.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'If eggs had no feathers, how would birds come to have them?'

A chicken has three feet.
Sima [Biao] notes: 'A chicken has two feet for walking, but walking is not movement—thus walking arises from the feet, while movement is guided by spirit. Though a chicken has two feet, it requires spirit to walk—hence it is said to have three feet.'

Ying possesses the world.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'To claim kingship is to aggrandize oneself.'

A dog can be a sheep.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'The names "dog" and "sheep" are both assigned by people. If one first names a dog as a sheep, then it is a sheep.'

A horse can lay eggs.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: 'Birth from wombs, eggs, or moisture—these are distinctions made by human sentiment. From the perspective of the Dao, they are not fundamentally different. If bird eggs can have feathers, why should beast wombs not be called eggs?'

A tadpole has a tail.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: 'The people of Chu call frogs "dingzi." That frogs have no tails is commonly known. Yet from the perspective of the Dao, nothing is truly without form, and what is not without form may still be called "without"—so why should what is not "having" not be named a tail?'
Note: Tadpoles are born without legs but with tails; after hearing thunder, their legs emerge and their tails recede.

Fire is not hot.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'People all eat cooked food—thus it is not hot.'

Mountains have mouths.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'Empty valleys transmit sound.'

A wheel does not tread upon the earth.
The wheel turns without ceasing—if it trod upon the earth, how could it turn?

Eyes do not see.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'If they could see, why do they not illuminate themselves?'

The finger does not reach; what is reached is not exhausted.
Where there is pointing, there is omission—hence it is said the finger does not reach. The second "reached" is likely a scribal error for "ear."
These lines all refer to the human body. Though the ear may cease to hear a sound, ultimately there is no matter in the world, past or present, that is not transmitted—thus it is not exhausted. The character "reached" is a corruption of the above, rendering the passage unintelligible.

A tortoise is longer than a snake.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: 'Length and shortness are relative—nothing is long that is not also short. To say a snake is long and a tortoise short is a delusion of things. To dispel this confusion, it is said the tortoise is longer than the snake.'
Yu [Yue] notes: 'This is the same idea as "nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small."'

A square is not square.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'The world has its own squares, not those made by the carpenter’s square.'

A compass cannot make a circle.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'The world has its own circles, not those made by the compass.'

A chisel does not encircle the tenon.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: 'The chisel is the hole; the tenon is the wood within the hole.'
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'The tenon enters of its own accord—the chisel never encircles it.'

The shadow of a flying bird never moves.
Birds fly mostly by day—hence it is said their shadow never moves.
Sima [Biao] cites Mozi: 'The shadow does not shift.'

The swiftness of an arrow’s tip has a moment of neither moving nor resting.
The movement and rest of an arrow’s tip are determined by people. Focusing solely on the arrow’s tip, there is a moment of neither moving nor resting.

A dog is not a canine.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: 'Dog and canine share the same reality but differ in name. When name and reality align, what they call a dog is what we call a canine; when name and reality diverge, what they call a dog differs from a canine. Mozi said: "A dog is a canine, yet a dog is not a canine."'

A yellow horse and a black ox make three.
Xuan [Yun] notes: 'Two colors and one body make three.'"

The white dog is black.
Xuan [Yun] notes: "White and black are names given by people—how do we know white should not be called black?"

The orphaned colt has never had a mother.
Li [Yi] explains: "A colt is born with a mother, but when called 'orphaned,' it has no mother. Once the name 'orphaned' is established, the name 'mother' is removed—thus the orphaned colt has never had a mother."

A one-foot staff, halved each day, will never be exhausted in ten thousand generations.
Sima [Biao] states: "A *chui* is a staff. If it can be divided, there will always be two parts; if it cannot be divided, one part will always remain—hence it is said it will never be exhausted in ten thousand generations." The debaters used this to engage with Hui Shi, and their arguments remained inexhaustible throughout their lives.

Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long were among the debaters.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "Huan and Gongsun were both from Zhao, skilled rhetoricians who served as retainers at the court of Lord Pingyuan. Gongsun Long’s *Discourse on the White Horse* is still circulated in the world."

They adorned people’s minds and altered their intentions.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "They embellished people’s thoughts and changed their views."

They could overcome others in speech but could not convince their hearts—this was the debaters’ confinement.
Xuan [Yun] notes: "The debaters were trapped within their own arguments and could not escape."

Hui Shi daily employed his knowledge in debate, matching wits with others—particularly in the arguments of his companions and those he debated with. He uniquely indulged in the bizarre among all the debaters of the world.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "*Te* (特) means 'alone'; the character is sometimes written as *jiang* (将)."
Note: *Wei guai* (为怪) refers to displaying strange and eccentric ideas.

This was the essence of his approach.
Yu [Yue] notes: "*Di* (柢) is interchangeable with *di* (氐). In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Annals of the First Emperor of Qin*, it says, 'For the most part, they all rebelled against Qin officials'—*Zhengyi* annotates: '*Di* means 'roughly.' Thus, *ci qi di ye* (此其柢也) means 'this is the rough outline of it.'"

Yet Hui Shi’s oral arguments led him to consider himself the most worthy, believing he alone understood principle better than anyone. He would say: "How grand are heaven and earth!"
Sima [Biao] explains: "Hui considered only heaven and earth to be grander than himself."

Hui Shi was aggressive but lacked method.
Sima [Biao] explains: "Hui’s intent was to defeat others, but he had no art of principle."

In the south there was an eccentric named Huang Liao.
*Shiwen* notes: "*Yi* (倚) is sometimes written as *ji* (畸), with the same meaning." Li [Yi] explains: "It means 'unconventional.'"
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "His surname was Huang, his given name Liao—he did not conform to the common world."

He asked about why heaven and earth do not fall or sink, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline to answer nor did he ponder—he responded without hesitation.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "He did not decline but answered immediately, did not think but replied at once."

He expounded on all things in the world.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "He exhaustively explained the origins of all things."

His explanations never ceased, growing ever more numerous, yet he still deemed them insufficient and added even stranger claims.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "He augmented his arguments with the bizarre to display his abilities."

He took contrariness as truth and sought to defeat others for fame—thus he could not harmonize with the multitude.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "He could not achieve harmony and accord."

Weak in virtue, entangled in things, inwardly frail yet outwardly strong, his path was crooked and obscure.
*Yu* (隩) means "twisted and hidden."

This was not the Great Dao.
Viewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of heaven and earth, he was like a single gnat’s labor—what use was he to things?

To fulfill the One would suffice.
Xuan [Yun] notes: "Inner sageliness and outer kingship both originate from the One. If this can be fulfilled, why chase after things?"

The more he esteemed himself, the closer he came to the Dao.
*Yue* (曰) is a particle. The more he valued himself without excessive speech, the nearer he was to the Dao.

Yet Hui Shi could not find peace in this. He scattered himself among the ten thousand things without respite.
Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "He dissipated his spirit."

In the end, he was known only for his skill in debate.

What a pity!

Hui Shi’s talent was unbounded yet unfulfilled.
*Tai* (骀) means "unrestrained." *Bu de* (不得) means "without attainment."

He pursued the ten thousand things without return—like chasing an echo with sound, or racing one’s shadow.
Hearing the echo, he raised his voice; he did not know that the louder the sound, the stronger the echo’s resonance. Seeing the shadow approach, he quickened his pace; he did not know that the swifter the form, the more closely the shadow follows.

What sorrow!
*You* (有) was mistakenly written as *ruo* (若) in the original; emended according to the *Jishi* edition.
