The true transmission has its secrets, the true transmission has its secrets.
What the *geng* and *jia* must know, the Confucian scholars expound in detail.
Teach people to discern clearly the presence and absence, lest one’s ardent devotion be in vain.
The mechanism lies before one’s eyes; qi is thereby drawn forth.
Above is the Celestial Valley; below is the Spring Cavern.
Recognize these two places—no deviation is permissible.

**Preface to Minor Arts of Heterodox Ways by Ancient Buddha Xiangyue Wentong of Jizhong Charitable Hall**

Heterodox ways are those that openly contravene the Dao; minor arts are those that subtly deviate from it. The Great Dao is supremely profound, wondrous, simple, and effortless—untainted by the slightest selfish intent or the faintest desire. Whatever fails to align with the qi-movement of Heaven and Earth, the orthodox principles of sages and worthies, or the preservation and expression of human nature and emotions belongs to heterodox ways and minor arts.

Yet heterodox ways and minor arts are myriad. To enumerate them in detail might offend the virtuous, while to remain silent might mislead later learners. Thus, I shall briefly outline several dozen of the most pernicious practices in the world—those that most grievously corrupt the heart and defile the gates of the mysterious—so as to stem their poisonous flow. This is but the compassionate hope of pulling one from the abyss or rescuing one from the flames.

Should any cultivator have fallen into these arts, they must turn back at once; to mend the fold after losing the sheep is not too late. But if, swayed by doubt and delusion, one clings stubbornly to error, harming oneself and others, one will not only fail to forge great karmic connections but also forfeit any prospect of a favorable outcome.

The boundless karmic affinity of the ten thousand buddhas lies near—let all cultivators of this age take heed. The path to the Three Pure Ones’ hall remains open—let later cultivators discern it with utmost care.

**Responsive Moon’s Literary Correspondence with Ancient Buddhas (Four Poems)**

Mistaking "other" and "self" for truth,
Who knows yin and yang lie within the body’s own frame?
Buying concubines, consorting with courtesans to practice *cai-zhan*,
Seeking to seize primordial *qi* to replenish the spirit—
Could there be immortals of Penglai’s fairy realms
Who instead resemble lewd youths, lustful in their ways?

Now, "other" refers to the youthful yang, to primordial *qi*;
"Self" refers to the beautiful woman, to the primordial spirit.
The principle is this: with the yang *qi* of one’s own body, one ignites the yin spirit within,
So that spirit and *qi* merge as one—this is called attaining the Dao.
Yet the heterodox schools take "self" as man and "other" as woman.
Thus, some buy beautiful women to keep as concubines,
Having an external "yellow dame" watch for the approach of *ren-gui* to practice *cai-zhan* and seize their *qi*;
Others purchase fair concubines or consort with courtesans,
Engaging in *cai-zhan* to plunder their primordial *qi*.
All these err in misconstruing the terms "other" and "self,"
Committing the gravest transgression—
Neither heavenly law, royal decree, nor the punishments of the unseen realm can they escape.
How then can they hope to become immortals?
If such ways could lead to immortality,
Then Penglai’s immortal mountains would be overrun with lewd youths and wanton women.
Speaking in fairness, can such a principle exist?
Can such a principle exist?

This principle inflicts immense harm upon people, and thus the ancient Buddhas placed it foremost among prohibitions.
In Daoist cultivation, the mind must be kept pure above all—first forge the sword of wisdom to sever the root of lust.
Those who, ignorant of forging the sword, instead test its edge,
Are like adding oil to a raging fire.
Even the hands that subdue dragons and tigers
Cannot escape leakage, turning primordial essence into turbid fluid.

When no thought arises, one abides in the primordial;
The moment a thought stirs, one falls into the posterior.
If the mind remains clear, the primordial still lingers within the posterior;
If the mind is clouded, the primordial vanishes entirely from the posterior.
No thought surpasses lustful desire—once it stirs, the numinous *qi* scatters;
If it lingers long, the numinous *qi* perishes.
The cultivator need not fear thoughts arising, only delayed awareness.
Awareness itself is the sword of wisdom.
Awaken and sever at once, awaken and sever without pause—constant vigilance severs the root of lust.
This is called great awakening, this is called forging the sword.

Yet the heterodox schools, ignorant of the wondrous method of forging the sword,
Instead take the union of man and woman as "testing the sword,"
Claiming that if no thought moves, the blade is sharp,
And if thought moves, the blade is dull.
But ask: when the yang stirs, does thought arise from nothing?
Or does it arise from something?
If the yang stirs without thought, this belongs to the primordial—just the moment to gather it.
If thought arises before the yang stirs, this belongs to the posterior—precisely when it should be subdued.
Yet instead of subduing it, they proceed to lewd acts—what is this if not adding oil to a raging fire?
At such times, the primordial spirit cannot govern, and the acquired spirit takes control,
Turning primordial essence into turbid fluid.
To expect it not to leak or drain away—I do not believe it.
This is a stern rebuke of those who "test the sword."

When the yang stirs, the wind blows and draws through the *weilu*,
If it does not disperse after several attempts, the *zhou-tian* begins.
Thirty-six rounds of yang fire advance,
Twenty-four rounds of yin tally follow—fully employed.
But ask the world’s true cultivators:
From which immortal was this method transmitted?

The dispersal of the yang by wind is proper practice.
If the yang does not subside, there are secret techniques.
Those who practice minor arts perform the lesser *zhou-tian* thirty-six times,
From the *weilu* up the spine to the *jiaji*, over the *yuzhen* to the *niwan*, where it halts—this is advancing yang fire.
Then from the *niwan* down the twelve-storied tower, letting it descend naturally—twenty-four times—this is retreating yin tally.
They then combine thirty-six rightward and twenty-four leftward circles to complete the *zhou-tian* count.
Afterward, they gather the spirit and sit in meditation—this is called "bathing" or "supplementing the intercalary."
I know not how the *zhou-tian* can be so rigidly numbered,
Forcing the mind and intent into external work—how can the spirit settle?
How can the elixir form?
It is but futile labor.
This speaks of minor arts—beware them.

The rolling wheel spins before the chest,
Falsely claimed to be transmitted by the "Two-Mouthed Immortals."
Forcibly employing methods to refine the nature,
Yet failing to recognize that true nature is primordial.
The immortals and Buddhas transmitted the method of settling the spirit—
Wondrous in its effortless naturalness.

The "rolling wheel" is a large circle silently traced before the chest,
Then reduced to a smaller circle to bind the nature—this they call "refining the nature," a mere technique.
Could Lü Dongbin have truly passed this down?
Their slander of Ancestor Lü is indeed grave.

The true nature is utterly empty and numinous—
It is by this nature that one becomes immortal or Buddha.
If tracing a silent circle can bind the nature,
Then tracing a silent circle can bind immortals and Buddhas as well.
This principle is easily understood—
Even those of modest wisdom could discern it,
Yet how have so many fallen into such techniques unawares?

The method of settling the spirit transmitted by immortals and Buddhas
Is itself the method of refining the nature.
Wondrously aligned with the natural,
It requires no forced effort,
And of itself enables the nature to become perfectly luminous, fulfilling the great Dao.

As I, an ancient Buddha, have surveyed the world,
I find no shortage of heterodox minor arts.
I record them here in this book
To spare later students from error.

**Ancient Buddha Who Delivers All Beings (Four Poems)**

Each dawn they face the east, mouths agape toward heaven,
Eyes bulging, shoulders hunched;
Expelling all turbid qi, drawing in the pure,
To shed the mortal coil and restore youthful countenance.
Little do they know that perverse winds enter the viscera,
Distending the lower field, swelling the belly—life cut short.

The technique of drawing in qi:
At early dawn, face east,
Eyes bulging, shoulders raised,
Inhale deeply through the mouth,
Taking pure qi within, expelling turbid qi without—
They claim this can make one immortal or Buddha.
Yet who knows that perverse qi accumulates in the five viscera and six bowels?
Over time, the lower field distends, the chest becomes congested,
And some even die of swelling.
Alas!
To seek the Dao without method and die an untimely death—
How laughable, how pitiable!

Foolish men vainly dream of becoming immortals,
Enduring thirst without drink, hunger without food;
They make of themselves hungry ghosts, falling into the three evil destinies,
Yet still hope to ascend to the Great Brahma Heaven.
Many the wise led astray by this,
As inner demons arise and outer demons cling.

To drink when thirsty, to eat when hungry—
This is the principle of nurturing life.
For those who cultivate the Dao,
When primordial qi is abundant, the need for grain may cease.
Yet only when one neither thirsts nor drinks, neither hungers nor eats,
Does one become an immortal.
But there are those foolish seekers of immortality
Who shut themselves away in silent sitting,
Ignoring the wondrous methods of true cultivation,
And merely endure hunger and thirst—
Even to the point of death.
If such words are to be believed,
Then all who die of hunger in the world
Would be enrolled in the registers of immortals.
I have seen many wise men
Led astray by heterodox paths—
This is the result of deluded longing.
Once the demon of intent arises,
Outer demons come to claim their lives.
Foolish men, seek a true teacher while there is still time!

Without cause they kindle fire and recklessly add oil,
Drawing in pure qi through the nose in outward pursuit;
Guiding it upward to the Mud Pill Palace, halting at the Double Pass,
Then reversing its flow down the Twelve-Storied Tower;
Without fire they manipulate fire, then suppress it—
Wasting spirit and energy until the hair turns white!

There exists a method of "kindling fire and adding oil":
Through the nose, one draws in the pure qi of heaven and earth,
Using intent to guide it upward to the Mud Pill Palace,
Halting at the Double Pass,
Then turning it back up to the Mud Pill Palace,
Crossing the Upper Magpie Bridge,
Swallowing it down the Twelve-Storied Tower,
And stopping at the middle field.
If there is no perverse fire, all is well—
Yet they deliberately manipulate fire, then suppress it.
What method is this?
What Dao is this?
Misusing spirit and energy,
Even to the end of one’s days,
One remains a mortal bound to birth and death.
Of the great elixir of golden cinnabar,
They have not even dreamed—
What benefit is there in blind cultivation?

Most detestable are the blind masters who falsely claim immortal talent,
Leaving the "Five Dragons Bearing the Sage" to wild conjecture;
Boasting of their bellows’ skill as it issues from the furnace,
Stuffing objects to block the bowels—how utterly foolish!
Swindling others of their wealth, ruining their lives,
Doomed to suffer infernal punishments in death and calamities in life.

This method originates from the recipe masters.
At the moment of the yang’s ascent,
They vigorously fan the wind and fiercely refine,
If the qi does not disperse,
They concentrate the spirit and engage in battle for one or two watches,
Using five fingers to cradle the kidneys, tightly grasping the dragon’s head as in self-gratification—
This they call "the bellows issuing from the furnace."
Employing the four-word formula of *cuo* (gathering), *shi* (licking), *xi* (absorbing), and *bi* (closing),
They take the impure essence formed by improper means,
Reverse its flow through the Three Passes up to the Mud Pill Palace,
Swallow it into the Yellow Court,
And circulate it through the microcosmic orbit—
Circling left and right, sixty times in all.
Some even claim:
"When the great medicine passes through the passes,
One must tightly block the bowels with a wooden implement
To prevent the elixir from escaping."
Yet when the great medicine crosses the passes and descends the Magpie Bridge,
It naturally follows its path, surging into the tailbone and ascending—
What has this to do with the bowels?
Why subject oneself to such cruel torment?
These two methods are regarded as secret techniques by blind masters,
Who swindle others of their wealth and destroy their lives.
When the mysterious gate has fallen to such a state,
How can one avoid great calamities in life
Or escape infernal punishments after death?
Cultivators, awaken swiftly!

**—Inscribed by Disciple Zhang Xian of Pure Essence with reverence**

**Water Ancestor (One Poem)**

The immortal elixir lies hidden within the body—most potent,
Why seek strange formulas beyond the self?
Gold and minerals rashly consumed bring only harm,
The placenta’s stench is foul and hard to bear.
Yet there are fools, ignorant and base,
Who devour spent essence like beasts.

The primordial qi within the body *is* the immortal elixir,
Yet wayward schools and heterodox paths seek strange formulas outside.
Some refine metals and minerals to ingest, hastening their own death;
Others consume the placenta, turning kin against kin.
Most detestable are those who, after coupling,
Lick spent essence themselves—
How do they differ from oxen, horses, dogs, or swine?
If consuming spent essence could make one immortal,
Would not oxen, horses, dogs, and swine all ascend to heaven?

This folly stems from misreading "elixirs" and "ingestion" in alchemical texts.
Reading books requires discerning principle,
Seeking a master demands true insight.

**Great Awakened Compassionate Perfected One, Transforming Heaven and Earth, Salvaging All Beings (Two Poems)**

Seeking to unblock every joint and bone,
They boast of "transporting qi" as divine skill.
The tortoise’s head bound—yet the tortoise won’t die;
The dragon’s head inverted—the dragon grows fierce.
Then there’s the so-called "Eight Pieces of Brocade,"
All brute force, like madness or frenzy.

Seeking to unblock every joint and bone,
They boast of "transporting qi" as divine skill.
Drawing in a breath to guide it to the lower field,
From both feet to the knees, then to the insteps,
Turning into the Bubbling Spring point;
Then from the heels up the backs of the legs,
Through the Yang Pass, piercing the Double Passes beside the spine,
Up both shoulders to the backs of the hands, flipping into the palms;
From the elbows to the nape, up the Jade Pillow to the Mud Pill,
Down the Magpie Bridge through the Twelve-Story Tower,
Settling in the elixir field—one cycle of the heavens.

The tortoise’s head bound—yet the tortoise won’t die.
While sleeping, wrap the yang organ with a long cloth,
Bind it with cord, then tie the cloth and cord behind the neck,
Lying on the side to prevent erection and elixir loss.

The dragon’s head inverted—the dragon grows fierce.
This method also uses a long cloth and cord to wrap the yang organ,
Tying it from the tip to the back of the neck,
The upper head facing the lower head,
Eyes fixed intently upon it.

Then there’s the so-called "Eight Pieces of Brocade":
Shaking the head and swaying the tail, rubbing the abdomen,
From top to bottom thirty-six times,
Knocking the teeth thirty-six times, swallowing the saliva,
Hands on the hips, deliberately swaying the body,
Hands swinging fists as if striking someone,
Turning the head left and right to peer at the heels,
Standing on tiptoes, fingers interlaced, raising to the brows and lowering to the ground—called the "Duke Zhou’s Salute."
Standing on one leg, stretching with force,
When finished, exhausted, facing the sky and exhaling three deep breaths—called "Expelling the Five Turbid Qi."
Do this after every meal, and when weary, do it again.
All brute force, like madness or frenzy.

All these heterodox practices are sheer brute force,
As if one were mad or deranged.
Those who practice them seek to ward off illness and prolong life,
Or to become immortals or buddhas—alas!
How laughable indeed.

Turning stones to gold and iron to silver,
The alchemy of yellow and white deceives the greedy.
Building elixir chambers and forging elixir vessels,
Falsely claiming ten thousand taels are needed to succeed.
Yet true refinement lies in heart and nature,
Accessible to all, regardless of wealth or rank.

Turning stones to gold and iron to silver,
The alchemy of yellow and white deceives the greedy.
Building elixir chambers and forging elixir vessels,
Falsely claiming ten thousand taels are needed to succeed.
Those who deceive with yellow-and-white arts claim
That once the elixir is refined, it can turn stones to gold and iron to silver.
Thus they seek out the corrupt and greedy,
Urging them to contribute silver—hundreds or tens of taels—
Promising to amass thousands before commencing the elixir work.
With this elixir, they say, gold and silver can be conjured at will,
Funding the construction of lavish elixir chambers,
Exquisite elixir vessels,
Fine robes, sumptuous feasts, servants, and attendants—
All supplied by the elixir’s transmuting touch.
This is a swindle, yet many fall for it.

Do they not know that refinement lies in heart and nature,
Accessible to all, regardless of wealth or rank?
Why resort to yellow-and-white arts?
Why build elixir chambers and vessels, all this splendor?
Let the greedy ponder this deeply.

**Radiant Cloud Lapis Lazuli Buddha (One Poem)**

Hands cradling the scrotum, wiping the lower field,
Ninety-nine yang counts, left and right complete.
Su Qin bearing the sword—truly unbearable,
Embracing the moon in the bosom, laughing at warming the elixir.
Bending backward to sun the belly—how much more bitter,
Self-entangled in the net—how foolishly sour.

Hands cradling the scrotum, wiping the lower field,
Ninety-nine yang counts, left and right complete.
With the left hand cradling the scrotum, the right hand wipes the lower elixir field eighty-one times;
With the right hand cradling the scrotum, the left hand wipes the lower elixir field eighty-one times.

Su Qin bearing the sword—truly unbearable.
This method uses a willow branch,
Shaped into a crescent board, propped against the wall,
The arched part pressing into the back,
Hair tied to the board, the right foot bound above, the left foot below.
No movement is possible—any shift risks a fall—
Then stealing valuables and violating women.

Embracing the moon in the bosom, laughing at warming the elixir.
In cold weather, a copper bottle filled with boiling water is placed on the navel,
Held in both hands—called "warming the elixir."

Bending backward to sun the belly—how much more bitter.
A deeply curved wooden arch is used,
Lying supine upon it—called "sunning the elixir."

Self-entangled in the net—how foolishly sour.
These heterodox practices are far from reason,
Yet fools are often ensnared,
Casting themselves into the net—how foolish indeed!

**Primal Clarity of the Great Ultimate Buddha (One Poem)**

Eyes fixed on one inch and three below the navel,
This is but a foul sac—how can the elixir form?
Pubic hair and external kidneys are of no use,
Falsely designating cauldrons and furnaces, pointing to the mysterious pass.
The true locus among the body’s pores and orifices—
The slightest deviation spans heaven and abyss.

Eyes fixed on one inch and three below the navel,
This is but a foul sac—how can the elixir form?
One inch and three below the navel—this place is utterly hollow, utterly foul.
To claim the elixir forms here is delusion.

Pubic hair and external kidneys are of no use,
Falsely designating cauldrons and furnaces, pointing to the mysterious pass.
Some focus on the pubic hair, others on the external kidneys,
Yet the true cauldron and furnace lie elsewhere—what use is such observation?

The true locus among the body’s pores and orifices—
The slightest deviation spans heaven and abyss.
Without authentic transmission,
All the body’s points remain uncertain—
Never presume to rely on guesswork.

**Ancient Wind Buddha (One Poem)**

The three thousand six hundred heterodox schools—
impossible to enumerate one by one.
All that involves contrivance is false;
purity and spontaneity alone are true.

The ten thousand differences return to one root,
the three vehicles converge in one mind.
Refining myself through myself is most wondrous—
within the fire of longevity, metal is born.

False and true stand revealed as if unveiled;
what to reject and what to follow have their proofs.
If one can truly abandon the false and return to the true,
ascension in broad daylight is assured.

The three thousand six hundred heterodox schools—
impossible to enumerate one by one.
All that involves contrivance is false,
for the heterodox paths are too many to inscribe on bamboo and silk,
and so all contrivance is subsumed under this.

Purity and spontaneity alone are true—
utterly pure, utterly natural,
this is the primordial Great Dao,
through which one may attain immortality or Buddhahood.

The ten thousand differences return to one root—
resolved in the single word "nature."

The three vehicles converge in one mind—
resolved in the single word "mind."

Refining myself through myself is most wondrous—
both form and spirit are perfected.

Within the fire of longevity, metal is born—
metal is yang, born within the fire of longevity.

False and true stand revealed as if unveiled;
what to reject and what to follow have their proofs.
In the entire corpus of immortal and Buddhist transmissions,
whether false or true, the words are clear—
how could the reader fail to know what to discard and what to embrace?

If one can truly abandon the false and return to the true—
this is the heart of immortals and Buddhas in saving beings.

This verse concludes the entire work.

Transmitted by Perfected Lady Sun Buer
*Secret Book of the Elixir Way*
*True Scripture of the Jade Purity Womb-Primordial Inner Nourishment*
Handed down by the Perfected Lord of the Treasured Spirit Primordial Terrace

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao attended court. The Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the Most High, saying: "When essence is depleted, fire flares upward; when qi is depleted, it flees downward. Yin and yang each course through water and fire, while metal and wood fail to unite as husband and wife. Thus, the people of the lower realms suffer daily decline of true qi, daily encroachment of yin evil, their original lifespan cut short, their spirit and essence incomplete, sinking into the state of lesser ghosts.

I once transmitted to you the wondrous Dao of the Womb-Primordial, whereby the outer Mysterious Female is united with the inner Mysterious Female, the outer true spirit supplements the inner true qi, and the myriad treasures of heaven are gathered to nourish the primordial essence of my womb. Thus, spirit is born within the womb, qi clings to spirit, the Heart-Monarch governs in concealment, breath is harmonized and even, the ten thousand spirits pay reverence, and the hordes of demons bind their forms. You should teach the multitudes first to master stabilizing the heart.

When the heart is stabilized, qi abides; when qi abides, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, the form is firm. Subtly continuous as if existing yet not ceasing, its use is inexhaustible and its efficacy manifest. The Valley Spirit does not die—it merges with my true lineage.

I pity the people of the world: outwardly ravaged by wine and lust, inwardly ensnared by cares and anxieties, ever coveting fame and profit, dissipating their spirit and essence, clinging to painted corpses, artful smiles and moth-like brows, chasing externals and forgetting their root, collapsing the foundation of their numinous nature. This causes Kan and Li to scatter and disperse, the hun and po to drift apart, children to be born in succession, and the bodily frame to gradually decline. Reduced to a mound of earth in a single coffin, they lose the true mechanism of heaven and earth—how lamentable!

You should exhort the people of the world first to uphold minor precepts, advancing to the great precepts; first to learn to still the heart, gradually entering non-action. Through stabilization, clarity arises; through clarity, the Dao is awakened.

The superior class of people, refining the coarse into the subtle, attain a luminous body and dwell in the Heaven of Purity and Stillness, their lifespan immeasurable. The middling class prolong their years and preserve their form, replenishing and restoring the Womb-Primordial, avoiding premature harm. The inferior class distance themselves from passions and desires, diminish their pursuit of profit and fame, turn toward the true wind, and follow the sagely teachings.

You should disseminate my wondrous words in myriad forms, circulating and teaching far and wide, gradually guiding them to abandon the false and return to the true, to discard the turbid and retain the pure, and to realize the supreme Dao."

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao reverently received the sacred instructions and, together with the Radiant Purple Heavenly Mother, each transformed their forms into as many as the grains of dust, dividing their bodies throughout the worlds to universally deliver sentient beings. Before long, the twelve thousand heavens of the upper realms gave rise to immeasurable heavenly beings within lotus blossoms. Each, riding the void, arrived at the Jade Purity realm, faced the true Venerable, and recited a hymn:

"Supreme Divine Father, who opens the great expedient means,
Commanding the Most High and the Radiant Purple Heavenly Mother,
Transforming their forms below to broadly deliver our kind.
Through precepts and stabilization, all ascend above,
Attaining the body born of intent and realizing the supreme Dao.
We, in turn, transform into hundreds of thousands of millions of forms,
Each embodying eternal ages, extolling the mysterious virtue—
Even through hundreds of thousands of millions of kalpas, it cannot be exhausted.
Vast and towering, its merit defies inquiry.
Having faithfully received this, how shall we repay?
We vow to generate the great resolve for future kalpas,
To deliver sentient beings with this single heart—
This is called requiting virtue."

The immeasurable heavenly beings recited this wondrous hymn, each scattering celestial flowers and precious incense into the void as offerings. Gazing afar at the true Venerable, they bowed a hundred times and withdrew.

*True Scripture of the Jade Purity Womb-Primordial Inner Nourishment* concludes.
*Supreme Jade Purity Inner Landscape True Scripture*

The Great Saintess of the Primordial Heaven of the Great Luo True Heaven, the Purple Radiance Heavenly Mother, transmitted this:

At that time, the Primordial Beginning Most True Great Saint transformed and opened the heavens. With the power of great divine penetrations and the power of great wisdom, he structured the world, harmonized yin and yang, and presided over creation. First, within the Mysterious Void of the Great Brahma True Heaven, he manifested external forms to reveal the inner landscape. He divided the nine qi into the color of the Wood Essence of the East, coalescing them into the Nine Qi Venerable One to govern them, which in humans becomes the liver and the hun-soul. Next, he divided the seven qi into the color of the Metal Essence of the West, coalescing them into the Seven Qi Venerable One to govern them, which in humans becomes the lungs and the po-soul. Then, he divided the three qi into the color of the Fire Essence of the South, coalescing them into the Three Qi Venerable One to govern them, which in humans becomes the heart and the spirit. Next, he divided the five qi into the color of the Water Essence of the North, coalescing them into the Five Qi Venerable One to govern them, which in humans becomes the kidneys and the essence. The remaining qi of the four directions—Water, Fire, Metal, and Wood—were distributed at the center as the color of the Yellow Court, coalescing into the One Qi Venerable One to govern them, which in humans becomes the spleen and thought. The five viscera, containing consciousness, together possess the Ten Perfections. The essence of the Ten Perfections can accomplish the Nine Revolutions, gathering into the elixir medicine and scattering as sweet dew. Circulating above and below, it refines and nourishes the hundred bones, washing away the turbid to retain the pure, dissolving yin to cast yang, restoring our primordial origin, preserving our great wholeness. Emerging from Kunlun, entering the Great Abyss, drawing forth the dragon’s transformation, passing through the Tiger City, the four qi harmonize and unite to perfect our utmost truth. The withered become flourishing, the aged return to infancy, the decayed visage is renewed, white hair turns black again, the voice rings like a bell, the body is as light as a feather. All mortal bones are replaced, and one ascends to fly in the Upper Clarity.

Scholars of the world, establish precepts and uphold concentration to generate wisdom and clarity. Through these three powers, they eternally preserve the qi of light purity for a hundred million years, moving with concentration and transformation to transcend as immortals. The True Sovereigns of the Left and Right Two Mysteries, the Limitless, with this Dao widely disseminate it among heavenly beings and humans, enabling them to abandon the karma of impermanence and enter the wondrous truth of the Real One, never aging, never dying, abiding in serene quiescence.

The Primordial Beginning Venerable True One, from his seven orifices, emitted great radiance, illuminating immeasurable lands. The twelve thousand heavens and the hundred billion human realms, each by their own power, scattered fragrant incense and flowers as shared offerings. All rejoiced without exception, each awakening to their original heart.

At that time, within the Mysterious Void, the Jade Clarity Transformative Palace suddenly beheld a precious moon’s radiance illuminating the ten directions, inner and outer. Within the precious moon, purple qi was contained, and inside it sat an infant on a jeweled lotus dais, emitting golden light. With a great jade voice, he spoke this gatha:

With one heart, true concentration arises,
Myriad forms naturally array themselves.
Following the directions, the five qi divide,
The five qi conceive the one numen.
The one numen penetrates transformation,
Refining and coalescing the original true.
The original true has no form,
Yet neither is it nothing nor non-being.
Those who comprehend this principle
Truly awaken to the pearl that gathers dust.

Within the Mysterious Void, inside the moon’s light, the Jade Infant expounded the teaching. In that moment, all in heaven and earth heard it. Without exception, their wisdom seas became serene, their karma mountains crumbled. Turning inward to illuminate, they eternally merged with the Dao’s truth. Gazing up at the sacred radiance, they bowed in reverence and departed, holding fast to faith and devotion.

**Treasure Chapter on Guarding the One**

Transmitted by the True Master of Mount Heng.
Also titled *The Heart Mirror of the Mysterious Pearl*

The Dao is non-action, yet nothing is not done.
It can be realized by the heart, not known by wisdom.
What is knowing?
What is realizing?
Wisdom transcends wisdom.
*[After knowing, one should transcend wisdom, concealing traces and veiling light.]*
Realizing emptiness responds.
*[Abiding in empty non-action, over time the spirit effects response, like echo answering sound.]*
Response arises without source,
*[Naturally and spontaneously.]*
And the heart thereby penetrates.
*[With the heart empty and non-active, over time one illuminates the Dao, and with illumination comes divine penetration.]*
Penetrating the One, all matters are complete.
The One is the root.
*[The One is the root origin of the Great Dao.]*
Matters are the gate.
*[Attaining the origin of the One is what the* Supreme Heart Seal *calls "matters."]*
Matters return to the One, the One abides eternally.
*[In guarding the One’s matters, when the work is complete, one returns to the primordial qi. The body and the void become naturally formless, and the one qi abides eternally.]*
Abiding has no possession, provisionally called "guarding."
*[When the one qi eternally abides in the self, do not allow qi to be possessed. Guarding is but a provisional term.]*
Guard the void and nothingness, and naturally endure long.
*[Simply guard the void and nothingness, and naturally the form and spirit will endure long with the Dao.]*

**Poem on Guarding the One**

The Transmission of the Origin of Obtaining the One by True Maiden Lu Chui of Fanyang to Cui Shaoxuan

*[Note:] The* Daode *[Scripture] states: "Know the white, guard the black."* Those gentlemen who study the Dao, having known the white, must guard the black. The black is the yin qi. At the beginning of guarding the black, the black within the body resembles lacquer. Guarding it without cease, the black qi gradually dissipates, and the tally of yin is entirely consumed. The pure yang white qi, when inwardly luminous at the time of clarity, with eyes closed and vision gathered inward, naturally reveals the five viscera and palace chambers, the thirty-six thousand blood vessels. As the numinous spirit gradually arrives, one emerges from existence and enters non-existence, divides the body into a thousand myriad, and this is called the origin of obtaining the One.

Those who guard the One need only empty their bodies, void their hearts, and constantly abide in emptiness and vacuity. Inwardly, they congeal spirit and thought, and the wondrous qi of the Origin naturally flows back into the body of the one who guards. It presides over nature and life. Lord Lao told Master Wen Shi: "I contemplate this Dao, which originally emerged from the dim and obscure." The dim and obscure is guarding the black—this is guarding the One. When stillness and quiescence endure long, the celestial light illumines within. Shedding the bodily husk, gathering vision inward to observe, the form remains as it is. At this time, outwardly, the radiant flame encircles the body; inwardly, the body divides into a thousand myriad. Such is the subtlety of Lady Cui’s *Poem on Guarding the One*.

The Supreme Lord expounded the *Heart Seal*, saying: *"The Perfected One wears a golden kerchief."* These five characters are the Heart Seal of the Jade Dawn Lord. Lord Lao transmitted this to Master Wen Shi. Guarding this Heart Seal is precisely guarding the origin of the One—this is the gateway to entering the Dao. There are no Highest Sages or Lofty Perfected Ones who did not enter thereby.

In short, the origin of guarding the One is guarding the primordial spirit within the emptiness and stillness. The origin of the One is not visible—it is the formless net. The origin of the One that may be obtained is the primordial pearl. It is not received from heaven but is the truth of the Supreme Lao. *[Note:] Lao may also be rendered as "Non-Existent."* The immortal of the Non-Existent. Light contains, shadow conceals. *[Note:] This speaks of obtaining the origin of the One. One must guard the spirit with utmost sincerity, accumulate merit and refine the form, darken the heart to no-heart, darken the body to no-body. Inwardly, one does not distinguish one’s own body; outwardly, one does not distinguish heaven and earth. With time, even bones and flesh transform into pure yang essence and qi. The yin qi inwardly dissipates, and one begins to perceive the celestial light shining within, brilliantly illuminating the midst of the molted body. When the celestial light unites within, form and shadow vanish and conceal without.* Formed by nature. *[Note:] This speaks of light containing and shadow concealing, spirit congealing in the emptiness and stillness—suddenly, form manifests. This is the countenance of a Celestial Immortal, emerging from nature, not an ordinary body.* Truth and tranquility are not sought. *[Note:] Master Zhenzi of Mount Heng comments: This speaks of the Dao’s completion, when form congeals within the body—not something that can be sought through cunning or skill. One must only darken the heart to no-heart, darken the body to no-body. If there remains even a trace of body or heart, the spirit will not congeal.]* The spirit’s enduring abidance. *[Note:] Wang Sunzhi, the Reclusive Perfected, comments: The true embryo’s tranquility depends solely on congealing thought within, so that the primordial spirit endures long. Formerly, Lord Lao told Master Wen Shi: "If one can retain the spirit within the body, know and embrace the mysterious, with firmness over months and years, the spirit will endure long. Only with enduring abidance does it congeal into immortality." Master Zhenzi of Mount Heng comments: When the work of guarding the One reaches completion, the spirit congeals, and the true form rests within my "child’s palace." The child’s palace is the sea of qi, the sea of blood. The true form resting in the child’s palace is called the spirit’s enduring abidance. One must accumulate merit through arduous effort over long months and years before the form may be completed. The* Western Ascension Scripture *states: "Conceal the person within the person without emergence, conceal the body within the body without manifestation—only then is the celestial Dao flourishing." How profound these words are! It also says: "The heart of no-heart, the body of no-body—this is called the Dao-person."* Beauty and purity become true. *[Note:] This speaks of guarding the One for long, so that the harmonious yang qi illumines the entire body, like a lamp’s flame—bright and clear, utterly luminous and devoid of things. The yin qi is entirely consumed, and the true form becomes ever more true.* The body’s nature is both firm and yielding. *[Note:] This speaks of the wondrous Dharma of formlessness, the Dharma-body of true suchness, which can be firm or yielding. Yielding means it cannot be grasped even when held in the hand; firm means it can pierce through metal and stone.* The azure clouds and jade ruins are the companions of the Highest Sages.

The *Poem on Guarding the One* concludes.

**The Primordial Scripture of the Feminine Origin by Perfected Sovereign Sun Bu’er**

At that time, the Primordial Sovereign was in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven, expounding the *Wondrous Scripture of the Feminine Origin* to the Celestial Nymphs Yan Na, the Twelve Stream Maidens, and others. She said:

Heaven is yang, earth is yin; heaven moves, earth is still. Qian acts, Kun yields—primordial, prosperous, advantageous, and upright. The Dao of Qian completes the male; the Dao of Kun completes the female. Yin alone does not grow; yang alone does not generate. Only when firmness and yielding attain the mean can water and fire achieve mutual completion, giving birth to the myriad things. Bearing and supporting the living, compassionate and forbearing without contention, reverent and yielding in assistance—thus abiding in the benevolence of the mother’s Dao, serving as the consort of the later primordial, achieving merit and discussing transformation, their Dao is one.

Since the opening of Qian and the closing of Kun, there have been the Holy Mother, the Queen of Earth, the Heavenly Matriarch, Nüwa, the Dipper Mother, the Buddha Mother, the Primordial Sovereign, the Queen Mother, the Immortal Maidens, the Jade Maidens, and those such as Magu, the Heavenly Consort, the Heavenly Maidens, the Mysterious Maiden, the Non-Ultimate Female Immortals, the Female Bodhisattvas, the Bhikṣuṇīs, the Nāga Stream Maidens, the Purple Maiden, the Xiang Consorts, the Luo Spirit, the Shamankas, the Lightning Mother, the Azure Maidens, the Plain Maidens, and the Weaving Maidens. All, through the yielding and compliance of the feminine origin, cultivated truth and attained the Dao, verifying the loftiest fruit—one in qi with the celestial origin, undivided.

Now, good women, each possessing the feminine origin, can all enter the Dao. Through cultivation and effort, they may verify the wondrous fruit of ultimate bliss and endure through ten thousand kalpas.

If your body obstructs you, making cultivation difficult, yet your original mind has no leaks—why do you obscure yourself? Before the beginningless past, where were forms? Where were bodily traces? There was only the One, only emptiness, originally without a second mind. Why cultivate the body? Why abandon the mind? If you can return and reflect on the origin, there is a swift path to cultivating truth. I now reveal this swift path to you, women of the assembly. Listen carefully.

The Way of Heaven moves; the Way of Earth is still. To cultivate nature and life, you must begin with stillness. Yet you are originally still—why cultivate? The Way of Earth is turbid; the Way of Heaven is clear. To cultivate nature and life, you must begin with clarity. Only by refining the turbid into clarity can you enter the Dao and verify the fruit.

I now teach you the Way of cultivating clarity. Though clarity and turbidity differ in form and substance, their original source lies in the mind and spirit. If you wish your mind to be pure and your spirit clear, you must cultivate your nature. To awaken to cultivating nature is to establish life. If you can awaken, that is your nature. Your nature is not nature; your mind is not mind. Mind is mind; nature is nature. Nature is not your mind; mind is not your nature.

If asked about your nature, nature speaks of nature. If asked about your mind, mind speaks of mind. Mind has no mind; nature has no nature—yet neither is without nature, nor without mind. Nature is not mind; mind is not nature. Nature has no mind; mind has no nature. Nature is originally without mind; mind is originally without nature. If mind has nature, it is not the Dao-mind. If nature has mind, it is not the Dao-nature.

The Dao-nature is my nature; the Dao-mind is my mind. This is true nature, this is deluded mind. If nature is true, you see the Dao-nature. If mind is deluded, it is not the Dao-mind. Though called the Dao-mind, there are distinctions—what is this "cloud-mind" called? There is the fleshly heart and the empty, numinous mind. This empty, numinous mind—what is it called? It is the true Dao-mind, the true real mind. That fleshly heart—what is it called? It is not the Dao-mind; it is the deluded mind.

If you can transform the fleshly heart into the empty, numinous mind, awaken the non-Dao-mind into the true Dao-mind, and break the deluded mind into the true real mind, then with a mind of courage, a mind of diligence, cast aside the mind of affliction and the mind of obstruction. Only the obstructing mind is attachment. To remove attachment, you must cultivate the vajra mind, the empty mind, the dead mind, the unmoving mind, the wise mind, the steadfast mind, the perfect mind, the accomplished mind, the bodhi mind, the compassionate mind, the joyful mind—such minds are called the Dao-mind. To illuminate the Dao-mind is to realize that mind is the Dao.

If you enter this Dao, guard this mind. When encountering forms, remain thus, unmoved. When facing illness, remain thus, unchanged. When thunder strikes, remain thus, unshaken. When right and wrong arise, remain thus, undisturbed. When blades threaten, remain thus, unafraid. When death approaches, remain thus, unbroken. Only in unbrokenness is there no death; only in no death is there the Dao-mind. Only in the Dao-mind is there cultivation of the Dao; only in cultivating the Dao is there cultivation of nature.

If nature is without clarity, it is not true nature. Without this true nature, what mind remains? Without this true mind, what Dao remains? Thus, divine powers and wisdom arise from the mind-Dao; purity, stillness, and emptiness emerge from the nature-Dao. The Three Treasures are one without duality; the Four Elements are but illusory emptiness.

Strive to preserve clarity within turbidity; guard against movement within stillness. To guard against movement is to illuminate nature; to illuminate nature is to guard the mind. If the mind is constantly cultivated, the six thieves cannot enter. With vigilant awareness, how can the five aggregates arise? Wisdom shines brightly, refining harmony into purity. Nature is illuminated, life is established—lead restrains mercury, relying on earth for success. Mercury is cast into the furnace, secluded in true silence, refining form into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit into emptiness—this is the original state. What kalpa cannot endure? What fruit cannot be verified? What body remains leaky?

How can the mind be obstructed? How can the Dao be dual? O virtuous woman, why do you still hesitate to cultivate?

When the Primordial Sovereign had finished expounding this sutra, she addressed the assembled immortals: "The non-dual principle I have just revealed was once transmitted to me by the Mysterious Lady Primordial Sovereign. It is the peerless, wondrous Dao of *Zhenyi* and *Kunyuan*, a bridge across the sea of the Way for you, virtuous women. Even virtuous men do not depart from this. Fearing that you may remain benighted and waver in doubt, I shall now recite a gatha:

Man and woman arise from the same qi,
Yet differ in clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness.
If a woman seeks to refine the true,
She must gather her primordial essence.
Within yin lies the primordial yang—
Preserve clarity, do not cast it aside.
Understand that form and desire
Are fundamentally without encumbrance.
Banish greed, wrath, and delusion;
Sever the bonds of care and anxiety.
Cast off turbidity to cultivate pure nature,
And you shall not fall into evil destinies.
Abide in stillness, guard non-action—
Then I, the woman, am possessed of the man.
No form in the formless,
Yet meaning in the existent and non-existent.
Inwardly perceive form and sound as empty,
Without the slightest clinging.
Rely on earth as the foundation of *Kun*,
For the one yang arises naturally from the ground.
Lead and mercury are not the same,
Yet qi and spirit share a single principle.
The vast, empty, numinous mind—
The spirit of the mind can master it.
When the one qi returns to spring harmony,
It soars beyond the clouds.
Accompanying you to roam the Great Clarity,
This is the gatha of true suchness."

When the Primordial Sovereign had finished reciting the gatha, the celestial maidens of the heavens, the twelve Immortal Ladies of the Streams, scattered fragrant blossoms and bejeweled tassels, while sacred scriptures danced in flight. All rejoiced, received the teaching with faith, praised its rarity, bowed in gratitude, and withdrew.

**Appendix:**
The Primordial Sovereign’s surname was Sun, her Daoist name *Erbu* ("Non-Dual"). She was a native of Ninghai. Born on the fifth day of the first lunar month in the first year of the *Xuanhe* reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song (1119), she married Ma Yifu of Danyang in her youth and bore three sons. Through the ten transformations of the pear offered by Wang Chongyang, husband and wife cultivated together and ascended as immortals. On the twenty-ninth day of the second lunar month, she ascended in broad daylight and was enfeoffed as *Qingjing Yuanzhen Xuanxu Yanzheng Shunhua Yuanjun*, one of the Seven Perfected.

**Sun Buer Yuanjun’s Stages of Inner Alchemy for Women**
Sun the Immortal Lady, named *Buer* ("Non-Dual"), was also called *Qingjing Sanren* ("Serene Scatterer"). She was the wife of Ma Danyang. Danyang’s hands hung past his knees, and three peaks rose from his brow. He once wrote a poem: *"Embracing the One and guarding unity is the work— / The lazy man now has nothing at all. / All day he holds his cup, delighting in spirit’s ease, / Yet in drunkenness, there is someone to support him."* None understood its meaning.

Suddenly, a Daoist calling himself Chongyangzi came to convert Danyang. When the Immortal Lady entered the Dao, she was offered a melon and ate it from the stem, saying, *"Sweetness is sought in bitterness."* When asked, *"Whence have you come?"* he replied, *"From no great distance, only to support the drunkard."* Danyang found this strange. Husband and wife served their master with utmost reverence and established the Quanzhen Hermitage in the Southern Garden. Several years later, their master took Danyang on a westward journey to dwell in the Misty Rosy Cloud Grotto on Kunlun Mountain, while the Lady remained at home, diligently practicing the transmitted teachings. At the age of fifty, she again traveled with the Immortal Lady Feng to Luoyang. After six years, her Dao was perfected, and she wrote a hymn: *"With three thousand merits complete, I rise beyond the Three Realms, / Leaping free of yin and yang’s embrace. / Hidden or manifest, I gain perfect freedom— / My drunken soul shall never return to Ninghai."* She wrote this, sat in lotus posture, and passed away.

Riding clouds past Kunlun, she looked down and said to Danyang, *"I shall await you on Peng Isle."* Thereupon Danyang immediately wrote a hymn: *"Sixty-one years long, / Unknown to the world— / A clap of thunder, / Vast and drifting with the wind."* With that, he cast aside his brush and ascended.

**First: Gathering the Mind**
Before this body had form,
A single qi already abided;
Like jade, the more it’s polished, the brighter it gleams—
Now refined, how could it remain dull?
Sweep clean the sea of arising and ceasing,
Firmly guard the Gate of Total Retention;
In the half-grain’s empty, numinous space,
The alchemical fire glows warm.

**Second: Nurturing Qi**
This was originally the beginning of non-doing—
Who would have thought it would fall into later heaven?
The moment a sound leaves the mouth,
Three inches already govern its power.
Moreover, worn down by worldly toil,
How can it bear the coils of illness?
When the child grows plump, it nourishes the mother—
Do not say there is no turning back.

**Third: Practicing the Work**
Where breath is gathered and spirit congealed,
The qi of the East arises;
Ten thousand conditions all unattached,
A single qi returns to its terrace.
The yin image should descend before,
The yang light may be planted behind;
From mountain peak to sea’s depths,
After the rain, a single thunderclap.

**Fourth: Slaying the Dragon**
Utmost stillness gives birth to movement,
Yin and yang model each other;
In the wind, seize the Jade Tiger,
In the moon, capture the Golden Crow.
Keep watch on the moment of misty union,
Attend to the paths of sequence and reversal;
Where the Magpie Bridge is crossed again,
The cinnabar qi returns to the furnace.

**Fifth: Nurturing the Elixir**
Bind the tiger and return it to the true cave,
Lead the dragon to gradually augment the elixir;
Nature must be as clear as water,
The mind as still as a mountain;
Regulate the breath to gather the golden crucible,
Calm the spirit to guard the Jade Pass;
Each day, add a grain of millet—
The crane’s hair turns crimson once more.

**Sixth: Embryonic Breathing**
To swiftly complete the elixir,
First dispel the illusory realm;
With every thought, guard the numinous medicine,
With every breath, return to Qian’s origin;
Qi once more flows through the Three Isles,
Spirit forgets and merges with the Great Void;
Whether coming or going,
There is no place not thus.

**Seventh: Kindling the Fire**
Where embryonic breathing is unbroken,
Discern the mechanisms of movement and stillness;
Yang’s light must advance further,
Yin’s waning soul must be prevented from fleeing;
In the pool, the pearl holds its radiance,
On the mountain’s peak, the moon sheds its glow;
At all six hours, do not slacken—
Irrigate the medicinal sprouts to flourish.

**Eighth: Receiving the Medicine**
Half the mystery is realized,
The elixir’s head congeals like dew;
Though it can secure life,
How can it be refined into form?
Through the nose, pure yang is received,
Divine lead permeates the body with numinosity;
Nurture it with utmost care—
When full, it will soar.

**Ninth: Refining Spirit**
The pre-born śarīra,
One day enters my embrace;
Be cautious as one holding a full vessel,
Gentle as one cradling an infant;
The earthly gate must be firmly sealed,
The heavenly portal must first open;
Wash clean the yellow sprout—
On the mountain’s peak, earth-shaking thunder.

**Tenth: Ingesting the Elixir**
The great smelting forges mountains and marshes,
Within it, the workings of creation;
At dawn, welcome the sun crow’s qi,
At night, absorb the moon toad’s essence;
When the time comes, the elixir can be gathered,
The body’s years become pure;
Where the original spirit comes and goes,
Ten thousand pores radiate light.

**Eleventh: Abstaining from Grain**
Having attained the feast of numinous qi,
The lungs and viscera grow wondrously cool;
Forget the spirit, unattached to form,
Merge with the ultimate—there is emptiness and separation;
At dawn, seek mountain taro,
At dusk, gather marsh orchids;
If mixed with smoke and fire,
The body will not tread the Jasper Pool.

**Twelfth: Facing the Wall**
All affairs are now complete,
Serene, seated in a small niche;
The light body rides the purple qi,
The tranquil nature bathes in the clear pool;
Qi blends yin and yang into one,
Spirit unites with heaven and earth as three;
When the work is done, ascend to the Jade Tower,
And with a long whistle, emerge from the misty peaks.

**Thirteenth: Exiting Spirit**
Beyond the body, there is another body—
Not formed by illusory arts;
This numinous qi is all-pervading,
The original spirit, lively and free;
The bright moon congeals golden liquid,
The blue lotus refines jade truth;
When the jade hare’s marrow is simmered,
The pearl shines, never fearing poverty.

**Fourteenth: Soaring Aloft**
The auspicious hour arrives, emerging from the valley,
In an instant, ascending to the divine clouds;
Jade maidens drive the azure phoenix,
Golden lads offer crimson peaches;
Before the flowers, pluck the brocade pipa,
Beneath the moon, play the jade flute;
Once immortal and mortal are sundered,
Coldly cross the sea’s tide.

**Seven-Language Quatrains of Immortal Lady Sun Buer**

I.
Not riding a white crane, I love to ride the simurgh,
Twenty banners swirl to left and right;
By chance entering the literary altar for a smile,
Incense of descending truth coils ‘round the jasper balustrade.

II.
In late spring’s weather, the warm wind melts,
Sunlight bathes the Jiangnan recluse’s home;
It urges the winter plum to burst its buds early—
A pure-hearted one faces the pure-hearted flower.

III.
Resources for life and origin all lie in yin and yang,
The Limitless can open the light of the Supreme Ultimate;
The heart-mirror, diligently polished, shines like the moon—
A mustard seed in the great thousand worlds, yet vast and towering.

IV.
Spirit and qi must be like the night air’s clarity,
From of old, the greatest joy lies in silence;
Within illusion, the true—within the true, illusion—
For now, play with the transformations in the silver basin.

V.
To Peng Isle, one must travel with companions,
A single body cannot ascend the azure cliff;
If withered stillness is taken for cultivation,
The weak waters, brimming, offer few boats.

VI.
Nurture spirit, cherish qi to maintain fullness,
Joy harms yang, anger depletes yin;
The inner brightness of both eyes tames the tiger’s tail,
Dimly, both ears hear the *Yellow Court*.

VII.
Thorns must be made to sprout yellow buds,
Within nature, the wondrous lotus flower resides;
One morning, it suddenly reveals the luminous image—
When you recognize it, that is he.

**Sun Buer’s "Stages of Inner Alchemy for Women" with Annotations by Chen Yingning**

**Preface to Sun Buer’s "Stages of Inner Alchemy for Women" with Annotations by Chen Yingning**

I.
The original fourteen poems are elegant in diction and profound in meaning, representing the highest level of alchemical secrets. They are thus transcribed in full at the beginning of this work to facilitate recitation and study.
*Note: The seven heptasyllabic quatrains of Sun Buer’s "Stages of Inner Alchemy for Women" have already been recorded in the section titled "Sun Buer’s Stages of Inner Alchemy for Women" and will not be repeated here.*

II.
Though the poems are titled *Inner Alchemy for Women*, when compared to the entirety of alchemical teachings for men and women, their differences account for but one or two parts in ten, while their similarities span eight or nine. Thus, men who cultivate immortality may also glean insights from these verses.

III.
The poems employ specialized Daoist terminology, which even the most learned scholars may struggle to fathom—ordinary women, of course, would find them even more obscure. This annotation strives to elucidate their mysteries, revealing all hidden secrets so that the true oral instructions leap forth from the page. Where the sequence of practice cannot be explained in full, this is due to the constraints of the original text. Many references to ancient sayings are drawn from memory, as they aptly convey the subtle truths—preferable to original composition and free from the taint of fabrication.

IV.
Though the annotations are not written in vernacular style, they eschew metaphor in favor of plain speech, making them accessible and easy to understand for anyone proficient in classical Chinese. If even this proves difficult, such a person may lack the karmic affinity for the Dao. For these supreme and wondrous teachings must be imparted only to those of suitable capacity. The poet’s intent was to express her own nature and feelings, not to seek others’ comprehension; the annotator’s aim is to transmit profound learning, not to court popular approval. Thus, the notion of universal salvation lies beyond the scope of this work.

V.
The highest alchemical practices are simple and all-encompassing, without fixed sequence or stages. The "stages" in these poems refer only to the depth of their effects. In terms of practice, the fourteen poems form a single, unbroken progression—no division into segments is possible. To grasp their essential principles, one must view them as a whole, rather than dissecting them piecemeal.

VI.
For women pursuing immortality, the *Celestial Origin* method of ingesting elixirs is fraught with obstacles and impractical, while the *Human Origin* dual-cultivation path is never committed to writing. Thus, this remains the sole authentic tradition for women across the ages, worthy of being called the Great Dao. Other schools, with their myriad names and varied teachings, often lead to corruption when misapplied. Even when practiced correctly, they may only strengthen the body, prolong life, and ensure a peaceful death—still far removed from the Dao of immortality. Those of great aspiration should devote careful attention to this work.

VII.
In ancient times, disciples studied the Dao under a master for twenty years or more. Figures like Yin Changsheng, Bai Yuzhan, and Wu Chongxu lived alongside their teachers, practicing diligently, receiving guidance in real time, and correcting errors step by step before achieving full realization. Modern seekers, however, are fickle and inconsistent, making success elusive. The cunning among them often resort to mercenary tactics, probing and provoking to steal oral instructions, believing that obtaining them guarantees instant transcendence. Yet what they acquire are mere dead methods—the true secrets of immortality emerge only through arduous, hands-on experimentation. Such individuals have never glimpsed them. A word to the reader: if you gain any insight, refine it with care and cultivate it earnestly. Otherwise, possession and non-possession amount to the same.
*This flaw is more common among men; women are less prone to it.*

VIII.
Since the Han dynasty through the late Qing, the three teachings—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—have endlessly debated their relative merits, with no consensus on superiority. After the fall of the imperial system, Confucianism collapsed entirely, Daoism ceased to function as a coherent tradition, leaving Buddhism as the sole surviving school. Though its followers are many, few engage in genuine practice—monastics least of all. Even the so-called "great lay teachers" offer little beyond instructing others to recite *Amitābha Buddha*. Methods like Chan meditation, *hua tou* inquiry, and *gong’an* exchanges have faded with the rise of Pure Land devotion. Tiantai’s *zhiguan* meditation, though a viable entry point, serves only as material for scriptural lectures, with no one pursuing its actual realization. Recently, the Shingon school, imported from Japan, has gained traction in China, but its hasty recitations often disrupt bodily and mental harmony.
These four approaches—Pure Land, Chan, Shingon, and *zhiguan*—represent the essence of modern Buddhism. Yet they remain one-sided, focusing solely on the mind while offering no resolution to the material realities of birth, aging, illness, and death. Their promise of liberation applies only to the afterlife, leaving practitioners to grapple with mundane needs—food, clothing, desire, and infirmity—just like ordinary people. As for what follows death, only the dead can know; the living can but speculate.

Moreover, the habitual tendencies of Buddhist adherents often lead them to exalt the Buddha alone while dismissing all others, rejecting outright any teachings beyond their own tradition. Though such reverence for a religious founder is to be expected, their rigid demarcation and self-imposed boundaries have stifled progress.

The purpose of this present work is to explore principles of learning, to inspire future like-minded seekers to engage in practical experimentation, and to resolve all questions of human existence—an aim fundamentally distinct from the propagation of religion. Thus, it bears no relation to Daoist figures such as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord Lao, or the Jade Emperor. As for the scriptures of Confucianism and Buddhism, as well as the works of the Hundred Schools, whatever may be of use will be gathered opportunely and employed as needed, without regard for sectarian divisions.

Within these pages, occasional comparisons between immortals and buddhas, based on the insights of past masters, are offered with brief commentary. Though such discussions may be partial and incomplete, they at least avoid both arrogance and obsequiousness, sparing the reader from blind conformity that misleads both self and others. Such, indeed, is the proper attitude of a scholar.

In short, regardless of sect, one must demand tangible results within a set timeframe and prioritize attainment in this present life. If this is the aspiration, there is no method other than the Golden Elixir of Returning to the Cinnabar. With this humble sincerity, I dare address my fellow seekers.

Nine. Among the world’s religions, their rituals, systems, theories, and practices rarely offer equal opportunities for men and women. The school of immortals alone is different. It is often said that women achieve cultivation faster than men: what takes a man three years to complete, a woman may accomplish in one, owing to the unique physiology of her body, which grants her this advantage. Yet once success is attained, one’s standing depends solely on individual effort, with no distinction between male and female. This is the singular insight of the immortal tradition, setting it apart from all other teachings. Clearly, the path of immortals is utterly free, transcending the bounds of religion and existing purely as a matter of scholarship. Readers should not judge it through the lens of religion. Women of great ambition would do well to enter this gate.

---

Ten. I am not a woman—why then study the women’s elixir formulas? Nor do I intend to become a teacher of worldly women—why then annotate the women’s elixir formulas? It is because I deeply fear that the transmission of this art, passed down for millennia, may now be severed. If it remains concealed and unspoken, future generations will have no means to comprehend it, and even the wise will find no entry. Yet the world is not lacking in learned and principled women who, inspired by great resolve and unyielding perseverance, refuse to be content with the conditions of modern life or to take refuge in the afterlife superstitions of religion. They seek to overcome the difficulties of food, clothing, shelter, and mobility, and to shatter the immutable laws of birth, aging, illness, and death. How can their aspirations be fulfilled if not through the study of immortality?

This, then, is the earnest intention behind my annotations.

Men’s immortality practice relies on the *Taiyang* method of refining *qi*, which is still known in this age. Women’s practice, however, depends on the *Taiyin* method of refining form, which has nearly vanished. Since men’s cultivation requires only that they fulfill their own duties, they need not concern themselves with women’s affairs. Thus, those who transmit the Dao often speak vaguely of women’s practice, and among women themselves, few possess the exceptional talent to receive and pass on this art. From this point forward, I deeply hope that successors will arise.

**A Brief Account of Immortal Sun Bu’er**

Immortal Sun, styled Bu’er, was also known as the Serene and Secluded One. She was the youngest daughter of Sun Zhongyi of Ninghai County (Ninghai being part of modern Dengzhou Prefecture in Shandong, not the Ninghai of Zhejiang Province). Born in the second year of Emperor Taizu’s Tianfu reign of the Jin dynasty, she was naturally intelligent, gentle, and refined. Her father betrothed her to Ma Yifu, with whom she bore three sons. Yifu was none other than the Ma Danyang Perfected, one of the Seven Northern Perfected.

After Danyang became a disciple of Wang Chongyang, the ancestral master employed various expedient means to persuade Immortal Sun as well. She then left her three sons behind, severed all worldly ties, and journeyed to the Golden Lotus Hall to seek ordination, where she secretly received the essential teachings of the Dao. Several years later, her master urged Danyang to travel west, and they dwelled in the Mist and Cloud Grotto of Kunlun. Immortal Sun, however, remained at home, diligently cultivating without respite.

In the fifteenth year of Emperor Shizong’s Dading reign of the Jin, she went to Luoyang and took refuge with Immortal Feng, residing in her lower grotto. Six years later, her Dao was perfected. On the nineteenth day of the twelfth month of the twenty-second year of Dading, she suddenly bathed, changed her clothes, and asked her disciples what time it was. Upon learning it was midday, she took up her brush and wrote a verse:

*Three thousand merits fulfilled, transcending the Three Realms,*
*Leaping beyond the confines of yin and yang;*
*Hidden or manifest, freely roaming at will,*
*The drunken soul shall never return to Ninghai.*

Having written this, she sat in lotus posture and passed away. Fragrant winds and auspicious vapors lingered for an entire day.

In the *jisi* year of the Zhiyuan reign of the Yuan dynasty, she was granted the title *Qingjing Yuan Zhen Shunde Zhenren* (True Person of Serene Depths and Compliant Virtue), and her lineage was named the Qingjing (Serene) School.

*(The above is drawn from the* Continuation of the Comprehensive Examination of Literature *and the* Dengzhou Prefecture Gazetteer*, as well as other records. For further details, consult the biographies, chronologies, and specialized texts on the Northern Seven Perfected in the* Daoist Canon*.)*

**Annotations**

Here follows the translation:

---

It is noted that among extant texts on female alchemical formulas (*nüdan jue*), only a few survive—barely one percent of the male alchemical canon. This scarcity is lamentable, and worse still, most were penned by men. Though their words may strike true, they remain secondhand accounts, not the lived experience of women. Apart from Cao Wenyi’s *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source*, this poem may well be the sole surviving work authored by a female adept.

The poem has circulated for generations without annotation. Years ago, in the course of discussing the Dao with a certain lady, I offered explanations from time to time, sending them to her by post. Two decades have since passed. The old drafts lay scattered among stacks of papers, nearly unreadable. I have now retrieved and re-examined them; fortunately, no major errors were found, so I have transcribed them here. I make no claim to have fully grasped Immortal Mistress Sun’s profound meaning, but hope to provide later readers with a path into the text. Some notes may yet fall short of perfection, for my aim is to guide beginners, not to indulge in lofty discourse.

**1. Gathering the Mind**

Before this body had its day,
The primal qi already held sway.

Before we had this form, we had this qi. Tanzi’s *Book of Transformations* states: “Emptiness transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into blood, blood into form, form into the infant, the infant into the child, the child into youth, youth into maturity, maturity into old age, old age into death.” This describes the forward course of human life. But those who attain the Dao can reverse the process: blood returns to qi, qi to spirit, spirit to emptiness—thus achieving immortality.

“Primal qi” refers to the undifferentiated qi before the division of yin and yang. Once yin and yang separate and the Two Modes take shape, it can no longer be called “primal qi.” The Confucians say, “As a thing, it is undivided; thus its generation of things is unfathomable”—this too refers to the primal qi. Laozi’s “attainment of the One” means obtaining this primal qi, which demands real practice, not mere empty talk.

Like jade, polished ever brighter,
Like gold, refined to purest luster.

Alchemists speak of the Jade Pool, Golden Crucible, Jade Hare, Golden Crow, Jade Fluid, Golden Elixir, and many such terms. Generally, yin, spirit, and gentle fire are likened to “jade,” while yang, qi, and martial fire are likened to “gold.” Jade embodies warmth and harmony, gold firmness and strength—though exceptions do occur.

Sweep clean the sea of arising and ceasing,
Firmly guard the gate of total retention.

---

The "sea of arising and ceasing" refers to the thoughts of us all. In a single instant, stray thoughts arise without cause, flickering into being and vanishing again, never settling. When a thought arises, it is birth; when it ceases, it is death. Within a single day, one dies and is reborn ten thousand times—thus the wheel of rebirth unfolds before our very eyes; why wait for proof after the body perishes?

Yet to sweep these thoughts away—how easily said, how difficult done! The only way is to employ a method that unifies the mind. What method? Precisely the firm guarding of the "gate of total retention." This "gate of total retention" is what Laozi called the "mysterious female’s gate," later known in Daoist tradition as the "mysterious pass, the single aperture."

Zhang Ziyang said:
*"This aperture is no ordinary one—
Heaven and Earth together form it.
Called the cavity of spirit and qi,
Within it lies the essence of Kan and Li."*

In plain terms, it is nothing more than one yin and one yang, one spirit and one qi. When yin and yang unite and spirit and qi engage, the substance of the mysterious pass is established.

Though it is said that one must first eliminate delusive thoughts, this does not mean the work is done solely on the level of thoughts. If one rejects all and thinks of nothing, the result will be futile, leaving one disheartened and in despair. This is a matter requiring deep reflection and clear discernment.

*(Zhang Ziyang’s verse admits another interpretation, but it lies beyond the scope of this discussion.)*

At the half-grain’s hollow and numinous point,
The fire’s warmth blends in perfect measure.

"Half-grain" describes how, when spirit congeals into the qi cavity, spirit dwells within qi while qi enfolds spirit without—retreating into secrecy. Its function is most subtle and fine, hence the metaphor of half a grain. "Hollow" means not clinging to appearances. "Numinous" means not sinking into torpor. Distracting thoughts must not arise, for their rise makes the fire parched; true intent must not scatter, for its scattering makes the fire cold. Only when it accords with Laozi’s words—"subtly continuous, as though present, yet not exerting"—does it meet the Middle Way. "Blending" means harmonious and fitting. "Warm" means neither cold nor parched.

These two lines of verse describe the true and practical work of guarding the mysterious pass, capturing its essence with precision. Yet this is decidedly not about fixating on some specific part of the body and rigidly holding to it—beware of misunderstanding. If beginners cling stubbornly to one place without adaptability, they will inevitably develop strange illnesses.

**Nurturing Qi, II**
It begins with non-doing—
how did it fall to the postnatal?
Following nature with non-doing is the Dao of the prenatal;
acting through human effort is the work of the postnatal.

Before we were born, we were originally a single undifferentiated qi, nameless and formless. Unaware, we sank into the womb and thus acquired a body. Once we have a body, great trouble follows. The moment the first cry escapes, three inches seize control. While in the womb, the infant has only fetal breathing, with no nasal respiration. But at the first cry upon birth, external air rushes in through the nose, and postnatal breathing thus takes hold of our life’s authority. At first, the inhaled breath is long and the exhaled breath short, and the body grows stronger daily. Later, inhalation and exhalation become equal in length, and bodily development halts at this point. In middle age, exhalation gradually lengthens while inhalation shortens, and the body declines day by day. At the moment of death, there is only the mechanism of exhalation, with no inhalation—once the nasal breath stops, the root of life is severed. "Three inches" refers to breathing.

Moreover, worn down by worldly toil,
how can one endure the coils of illness?
The above speaks of the natural principle of life and death; this speaks of how people harm themselves. Color, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharmas are called the "six dusts." Mental and physical labor are both called "toil." Our natural lifespan is already very short, and even without self-inflicted harm, few in this world live past a hundred. Moreover, worldly toil and illness deplete one’s primordial qi, preventing one from fulfilling one’s natural years, so many die prematurely before their time.

*(Someone asked: "The theory of the six dusts is Buddhist terminology—why use it to annotate a Daoist classic?"
Answer: "This is not my fault. The original poem already favors Buddhist terms, such as 'arising and ceasing,' 'thusness,' and 'śarīra,' none of which are originally Daoist. Without citing Buddhist texts, how could one annotate it?")*

When the child is plump, it nourishes the mother—
do not say it cannot return.

"The 'child' refers to postnatal qi; the 'mother' refers to prenatal qi. In the Dao of elixir refinement, postnatal qi is metaphorically called 'water,' while prenatal qi is metaphorically called 'metal.' According to the Five Phases theory, metal generates water—this is prenatal transforming into postnatal. The Dao of elixir refinement emphasizes reversing the course of creation, making water generate metal instead—this is returning from postnatal back to prenatal. The ancients called this the 'Ninefold Cyclic Elixir,' where nine represents the ultimate yang number and also the completion number of metal, hence 'nine returns.' This does not mean it is limited to nine cycles. Prenatal is difficult to grasp, so one must begin with postnatal practice to return to the prenatal. When postnatal qi is sufficiently cultivated, prenatal qi naturally arises—thus it is said, 'When the child is plump, it nourishes the mother.' 'Returning' refers precisely to this reversal and reversion.

**Third Stage of Practice: Gathering Breath and Concentrating Spirit**
At the place where breath is gathered and spirit is concentrated, the generative qi of the East arrives.
'Gathering breath' means the breath of inhalation and exhalation is stored and unmoving. 'Concentrating spirit' means the numinous spirit is focused and undispersed. 'The East' is the position of sunrise; 'generative qi' is spoken of in contrast to dead qi. Ancient practitioners of breath cultivation generally faced east during the hours of *yin* and *mao*, drawing in the generative qi of the void into their bodies, using its power to expel the accumulated dead qi within. Though superior elixir methods are not bound by time or place, they are best practiced in quiet mountain forests during warm, gentle weather—then the effects in the body appear immediately, like a shadow cast by an upright pole. If one can consistently concentrate spirit and gather breath, fermenting and steaming, before long one may extract the primordial qi from the cave of creation.

Confucius said, 'Acting before Heaven, one does not oppose it.' If even Heaven does not oppose it, how much less would humans or spirits? This is real practice, neither empty talk nor mere theory—only those who realize it will know. If one asks, 'How is breath gathered? How is spirit concentrated? Where does one abide? From where does it come?'"

"Since it cannot be clarified in a few words, nor fully conveyed through brush and ink, it requires repeated debate and repeated experimentation. Moreover, the learner must possess innate wisdom and pursue it with painstaking dedication before gaining entry. If every detail were committed to paper, the living method would become a dead one. People’s natures differ, and their constitutions vary—applying this dead method would only invite illness, not merely failing to benefit but causing harm. What good would that serve?

Let go of all entanglements, and the single qi returns to the terrace.

As the ancients said: 'Those who cultivate the Dao must sever all entanglements, uphold a single thought, making this heart as still as death—only then can one avoid death; making this qi unbroken and ceaseless—only then can it endure forever.'

What is this 'terrace'? It is the numinous terrace. The numinous terrace is one’s nature. The 'single qi' is one’s life. When life returns to nature, it is the restoration of the elixir.

The true adept Zhang Ziyang said: 'At this stage of refinement, the nine palaces stir with wind, the Crimson Palace shines with moonlight, the Cinnabar Field blazes with fire, the Sea of Grain ripples with clarity. The spine turns like a wheel, the four limbs become as steadfast as mountains, the pores rise like one freshly bathed, the bones and channels sink like one in deep slumber. The spirit rejoices as if in conjugal union, the hun and po linger like mother and child.' This is its realm, not a mere metaphor.

What has been described above may be called the ultimate depiction."

The yin image should descend in front, while the yang light may be planted behind.

Though the operation of yang fire and yin tally arises naturally, human effort also exerts a subtle transforming influence—this must not be overlooked.

From the *weilü* it ascends to the *niwan*; this path along the spine is called “advancing the yang fire.” From the *niwan* it descends to the *qihai*; this path along the front of the chest is called “retreating the yin tally.” Ascending is advancing; descending is retreating.

Moreover, when ascending behind, one feels the body suffused with rising heat; when descending in front, the heat gradually settles into cool stillness. Thus, the flourishing of heat is “advancing the yang fire,” and the calming of heat is “retreating the yin tally.” Though the two explanations differ in meaning, their principle is one and the same. Within this lies many subtleties—these should be studied.

Atop the mountain and beneath the sea, after rain comes a clap of thunder.

The Perfected Lü Chunyang’s *Lyrics of Pacing the Toad Palace* says: “The earth’s thunder shakes the mountain’s rain.” The *Hundred-Character Stele* says: “Yin and yang arise in reversal; the universal transformation is a single thunderclap.” Master Shao Kangjie’s poem says: “Suddenly at midnight a thunderclap—ten thousand households, a thousand gates open in turn.” The Perfected Zhongli Quan says: “The adept gathers the primordial qi; all night the thunder rolls without cease.” Master Peng Helin says: “Those on the Nine Flowers Peak know—one night of wind and thunder shakes ten thousand mountains.” The alchemical classics speak of thunder in many places; they cannot all be recounted. Their source lies in the *Zhouyi* hexagram “Return of the Earth’s Thunder,” yet in truth they all describe the phenomenon of the primordial qi accumulating over time, its power growing mighty, and responding to the moment with activation.

When this qi arrives, all the gates and orifices of the body open at once: the ears hear the sound of wind, the back of the head trembles, the eyes flash with light, the nose twitches—these and other signs should be known in advance to avoid alarm and confusion when they occur.

However, for women practitioners to reach this stage, it must be after the cessation of menstruation. The state described in Sun’s poem occurs before the slaying of the dragon and thus may not yield the same effect. Here, the term “thunder” likely refers only to the qi surging upward from the sea of blood to the two breasts during practice. The arising of this qi is called by alchemists the *huo zishi* (“living midnight”). The “mountaintop” symbolizes the two breasts and the *shanzhong* region; the “sea bottom” symbolizes the uterine sea of blood. “Rain” symbolizes yin qi; “thunder” symbolizes yang qi.

*Editor’s note: This annotation is in error. Practitioners at this stage will naturally come to understand.*

**Slaying the Dragon, Fourth Stage**

When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is born; yin and yang intertwine in embrace.

The “dragon” is a woman’s menstruation. “Slaying the dragon” means using the method to refine and sever menstruation, ensuring it never returns.

If one asks, “Why is menstruation called the dragon?”—from the Tang dynasty onward, all alchemical texts and oral transmissions have used this term, suggesting a deeper significance that need not be elaborated here.

If one asks, “Why must women practitioners first sever menstruation?”—this is the unique transmission of the immortals’ school, the supreme mystery, incomparable to any world religion, philosophy, or theory of physiology and hygiene. The difference between women’s and men’s practice lies precisely here; women’s success is swifter than men’s for this very reason. To depart from this path and seek another is to abandon all hope of attaining immortality. If one fails to refine the immortal body in this life, facing death empty-handed and claiming posthumous enlightenment or liberation is self-deception—such talk must not be believed.

Some may argue: “If menstruation is an obstacle to practice and must be refined away, then elderly women whose menstruation has naturally ceased should be spared this effort and achieve success more easily than the young.” Yet those who are virgins with no prior menstruation, if born with innate wisdom and awakened to the mysterious work, will naturally find success even more readily. Once old age arrives and menstruation dries up, the vital force is depleted—a world of difference from the virgin state. How can they be treated alike? The method requires generating something from nothing, restoring circulation in those whose *tiangui* has already ceased. Only then, returning from having to non-being, can one follow the established path for young women, gradually severing it step by step. This is far more difficult—how could it be easier?

Thus the ancients admonished: “Add oil while it is still early; join life before it is too late.”

When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises; when movement reaches its extreme, stillness returns. When yang reaches its peak, yin emerges; when yin reaches its peak, yang arises—this is the natural circulation of principle and *qi*, nothing strange in it. *The Daodejing* (Chapter 15) states: *“Who can make the turbid gradually clear through stillness? Who can make the tranquil gradually come to life through long abiding in movement?”* The first line speaks of how, when one attains stillness, the turbid *qi* within the body gradually transforms into pure *qi*; the second line speaks of how, after stillness has endured for long, movement within the body gradually stirs once more. *The Daodejing* (Chapter 16) states: *“Attain the ultimate of emptiness, guard stillness with sincerity; the myriad things arise together, and I observe their return.”* The first two lines speak of stillness at its extreme; the latter two speak of the arising of movement. *“Return”* refers to the hexagram *Fu* (Return). Yin symbolizes stillness, yang symbolizes movement; beneath five yin lines, one yang returns—this too speaks of *“stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement.”* *“Model”* refers to a pattern, that by which things are formed. *“Mutually modeling”* expresses how yin and yang are rooted in each other, mutually completing one another in inseparable interdependence.

“Seizing the jade tiger in the wind, capturing the golden crow in the moon.”
*“Wind”* refers to human breath. As the alchemical classics say: *“The postnatal breath stirs a gentle wind,”* and *“Blowing and exhaling rely on the wind of Xun.”* Both convey this meaning. Daoist texts often pair *“tiger”* with the west (metal) and *“dragon”* with the east (wood). Whenever they speak of lead, metal, or tiger, they refer to the same thing—nothing more than a metaphor for the prenatal yang *qi* that arises when stillness reaches its extreme. *“Moon”* has two meanings: in the context of cultivating *xing* (nature), it refers to the state of not a single thought arising, called *“moon”* for its purity, flawlessness, and solitary radiance; in the context of cultivating *ming* (life), it refers to the moment when prenatal yang *qi* stirs, likened to the phases of the moon—new moon, crescent, full moon—turning without error. *“Golden crow”* is a synonym for the sun; the sun is *li* (fire), fire is mercury, mercury is spirit. When gathering prenatal *qi*, one must rely on postnatal breath as the pivot, hence *“seizing the jade tiger in the wind.”* The word *“jade”* describes its gentle, harmonious quality. As the Perfected One Shi Xinglin said: *“When the wind first rises amid ten thousand whispers, the moon begins to round over a thousand peaks.”* This is precisely the scene. In the Dao of the Elixir, where there is wind, there must be fire; when *qi* moves, spirit responds. Thus Lü Chunyang, the Perfected One, said: *“Lead too is born, mercury too is born; born mercury and born lead are refined together.”* Lead and the moon are metaphors for yang *qi*; mercury and the golden crow are metaphors for yin spirit. When yang *qi* stirs, yin spirit necessarily responds simultaneously, hence *“capturing the golden crow in the moon.”*

Observe closely the moment of *yinyun*; attend carefully to the paths of sequence and reversal.
*The Book of Changes* states: *“Heaven and earth intermingle in *yinyun*, and the myriad things are transformed into harmony.”* *“Yinyun”* describes how the *qi* of heaven descends to earth, and the *qi* of earth ascends to heaven, warmly brewing like the moment before rain, when the sky is overcast for miles, the air thick with the union of spring’s vitality—yet before thunder rolls or rain falls. Once thunder and rain have been released, it is no longer *yinyun*. The moment of *yinyun* in the human body follows the same principle. But what exactly is its manifestation? There are unspeakable subtleties here, not to be written on paper. A discerning woman, if she receives true transmission, may seize the moment to apply effort; otherwise, she risks missing it entirely. Though there remains the possibility of creating the opportunity oneself, it will never match the ingenuity of the natural moment. At this time, if one follows the movement in sequence to practice the human Dao, conception may occur; if one reverses the movement to practice the immortal Dao, the medicine may be gathered and the elixir returned. Yet the meaning of sequence and reversal extends further. Outward expression of vital movement is sequence; inward gathering of vital movement is reversal. Vital *qi* descending and transforming into menstrual blood is sequence; vital *qi* ascending without transforming into blood is reversal. Thus the Daoist texts say: *“Men cultivate to cease leaking essence; women cultivate to cease leaking menses.”*

Where the Magpie Bridge is crossed again, the elixir *qi* returns to the furnace.
*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *“Cross the upper Magpie Bridge, cross the lower Magpie Bridge; heaven responds with stars, earth responds with tides.”* Later elixir classics all derive their use of *“Magpie Bridge”* from this. In the practice of refining the elixir, one must first turn from the lower Magpie Bridge up the spine, striking through the Jade Pillow to reach the Mud Pill Palace; then turn from the upper Magpie Bridge down the twelve-storied tower of the chest to return to the Ocean of Qi. The *“upper Magpie Bridge”* lies within the Mountain Root between the brows; the *“lower Magpie Bridge”* lies between the coccyx and perineum. When the elixir *qi* reaches the upper Magpie Bridge, one feels a radiant orb flashing between the eyebrows, hence *“heaven responds with stars.”*

When the elixir *qi* ascends from the lower Magpie Bridge, one feels a steaming warmth surging within the Sea of Blood, hence *“earth responds with tides.”* The phrase *“crossing the Magpie Bridge again”* refers to both the upper and lower bridges. *“Returning to the furnace”* means returning to the Yellow Court and no further, for the Yellow Court is also called the Earthen Furnace.

*(Note: The upper and lower Magpie Bridges have other interpretations, which are not discussed here.)*

**Fifth Stage: Nurturing the Elixir**
Bind the tiger and return to the true cavity; lead the dragon to gradually augment the elixir.
The *“tiger”* is *qi*; the *“dragon”* is spirit; the *“true cavity”* lies roughly between the breasts. *“Binding the tiger and returning to the true cavity”* refers to what Master of Supreme Yang, Chen Zhixu, called: *“For women cultivating immortality, one must first accumulate *qi* in the breasts.”* *Qi* is divided into precelestial and postcelestial: refining postcelestial *qi* employs methods of regulating breath and concentrating spirit; gathering precelestial *qi* requires acting when the generative *qi* stirs within the body. *“Leading the dragon”* is nothing more than concentrating spirit to unite with *qi*. When spirit and *qi* merge, the hun and po are restrained, and the elixir coalesces.

Celestial Master Zhang Xujing said:
*“The moment primordial spirit strays, draw it back;
Spirit returns to the body, and *qi* naturally follows.
Thus morning and night without cease,
The sacred embryo of the red child will form.”*
This expresses the meaning of *“leading the dragon to gradually augment the elixir.”* Here, the *“dragon”* differs from the *“dragon”* in *“slaying the dragon.”*

The nature must be as still as water,
The heart as tranquil as a mountain.

True Man Zhang Sanfeng said: *“Concentrate spirit and regulate breath; regulate breath and concentrate spirit—these eight characters must be practiced as one, in layers yet unbroken.”* To *“concentrate spirit”* is to gather the already-cleared heart and draw it inward. When the heart is not yet clear, do not forcefully close the eyes. First, one must self-exhort and self-encourage; only when clarity, coolness, and serenity are attained may one gather it into the *qi* cavity—this is called *“concentrating spirit.”* Then, as if seated atop a high mountain gazing upon all peaks and rivers, or as if a heavenly lamp illuminates the nine depths and nine obscurities—this is what is meant by *“concentrating spirit in emptiness.”*

Regulating breath is not difficult: when the heart-spirit is still, breath follows naturally, and I merely guard its spontaneity. Regulate breath to gather the golden crucible; settle spirit to guard the jade pass.

True Man Zhang Sanfeng said: *“In seated meditation, one must embrace spirit with *qi* and tether intent to breath, revolving gently within the Cinnabar Field, gathering without scattering. Then the internal *qi* and the external *qi* intermingle in the Cinnabar Field; day by day and month by month, it fills the four limbs and flows through the hundred vessels, striking open the twin passes of the spine to ascend to the Mud Pill Palace, then circling back down to the Crimson Palace and returning to the Cinnabar Field. Spirit and *qi* guard each other, breath upon breath interdependent—the path of the river chariot is opened. At this stage, half the effect of laying the foundation is achieved.”* He also said: *“To regulate breath, use postcelestial respiration to seek the true person’s breath. Yet in regulating postcelestial breath, one must let it regulate itself, only then can precelestial breath be aroused. I merely embody emptiness and guard stillness. When true breath stirs, the mysterious pass is not far. Proceeding thus, the foundation can be attained with ease.”*

Guangchengzi said: *“Embrace spirit with stillness, and the form will right itself. Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence—only then can you attain longevity. Eyes seeing nothing, ears hearing nothing, heart knowing nothing—your spirit will guard your form, and your form will endure. Guard your inner, close your outer; excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I preserve the One to dwell in harmony, thus my body has endured twelve hundred years without decline.”*

*(Note: Zhang Sanfeng’s method of regulating breath is the most detailed, while Guangchengzi’s discourse on settling spirit is the most refined; thus, they are cited as commentary.)*

The preceding line speaks of martial fire, hence "golden crucible"; the following line speaks of civil fire, hence "jade pass." Daily, one may augment by a grain of millet, and white hair returns to youthful complexion.

*The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: “Chaos envelops emptiness, emptiness encompasses the Three Realms. Tracing to its root, a single grain is no larger than a millet.” It further says: “Grain upon grain, from the subtle to the manifest.” This is the meaning of “daily augmenting by a grain of millet.” In essence, it is nothing more than gradual gathering, gradual refinement, gradual coagulation, and gradual congealment—there is no actual millet-like form to be sought.

*The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: “Golden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist or rain. Steaming and permeating the four limbs, the complexion becomes radiant and fair. White hair all turns black, fallen teeth regrow in their original place. Old age reverts to youthful vigor, the aged crone becomes a maiden. Transforming form to escape worldly calamities, one is called a true person.” This is the meaning of the poem’s final line.

Some say: “White hair on the head with an infant’s face is called ‘crane’s hair returning to youthful complexion.’” This is mistaken. If a cultivator practices primordial work, even white hair must turn black. If the hair remains white and only the face appears rosy, this is merely postnatal effort or the practice of absorption and supplementation—immortals are not like this. The common saying of immortals having “crane’s hair and a child’s face” is the talk of outsiders.

**Sixth Stage of Embryonic Breathing**
To hasten the elixir’s completion, first remove illusory realms.
“Illusory realms” refer to all worldly circumstances that entangle a person, pressing in from all sides, clinging without end, from which one cannot escape even in death. In the next life, the same or worse may await. Thus, the Dao cultivator must sever worldly ties to achieve swift results. Those who study the Dao for decades without progress have all failed to transcend worldly burdens.

*Note: The preceding explanation is correct, but it does not convey the true meaning of “illusory realms.” It was simplified for beginners. In truth, “illusory realms” refer to the various phenomena arising from yin demons within the body, seizing opportunities to manifest—some arousing desire, some inducing terror, some provoking anger, some evoking sorrow, some misleading one into mistaking them for spiritual powers, some luring one onto deviant paths, even causing mental confusion, self-mutilation, or delusional claims of encountering sages. All such phenomena are illusory realms and must be swept away. Without the Dharma eye, they are difficult to discern, which is why students must seek a teacher. Those who study the Dao for decades without encountering demonic obstacles have simply not practiced earnestly.*

With every thought, guard the numinous medicine; with every breath, return to Qian’s origin.
“The numinous medicine” is wondrous existence; wondrous existence is true breath. “With every thought, guard the numinous medicine” means the heart abides in breath. “Qian’s origin” is true emptiness; true emptiness is the heart of Dao. “With every breath, return to Qian’s origin” means breath abides in the heart. Though beginners in cultivation may achieve heart and breath interdependence, it does not last long before they separate again. At the stage of embryonic breathing, heart and breath remain interdependent without end.

“Qian’s origin” refers to the moment before the first line of the Qian hexagram is drawn, not the first line of Qian. *The Illumination of Dao* says: “Observe Qian before its line is drawn—what form does it take? With a single line, the ten thousand images arise.” Thus, is not Qian’s origin the image of the Great Ultimate before yin and yang divide?

Qi returns to the Three Isles; spirit forgets and merges with the Great Void.
“The Three Isles” metaphorically represent the upper, middle, and lower cinnabar fields in the human body. Laozi said: “Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering life.” This is the meaning of “qi returns.” The human body originally comes from the Great Void, but upon entering form, it becomes obstructed and cannot merge with the Great Void. Only those who have attained the Dao can forget all forms; once forms are eliminated, they merge with the Great Void.

Tian Yinzhi was a Daoist who said: “Those who cultivate the truth cannot achieve sudden enlightenment and must proceed gradually. First, fasting and purification—cleanse the body and empty the heart. Second, peaceful dwelling—reside in a quiet chamber. Third, visualization—gather the heart and restore nature. Fourth, sitting in forgetfulness—forget the body and the self. Fifth, spiritual liberation—penetrate all dharmas with the spirit.” The entire text is over a thousand words, and I cannot quote it in full; these are its essentials. Sima Ziwei’s *Treatise on Sitting in Forgetfulness* is also worth reading. Such practices are exceedingly difficult and cannot be mastered in a short time, but where there is a will, there is a way—it depends solely on one’s resolve.

Whether coming or going, there is no place that is not true suchness.
“True suchness” is a Buddhist term. Buddhist scriptures say: “The Tathāgatagarbha contains two aspects: the gate of arising and ceasing, and the gate of true suchness.” When the heart is free from arising and ceasing, it is true suchness. To turn away from true suchness is to enter arising and ceasing. It is also said: “True means real and not illusory; suchness means constant and unchanging.”

**Chapter Seven: Firing with the Talisman**

When in the state of continuous fetal breathing, one must discern the mechanisms of movement and stillness. The interplay of yin talismans and yang fire, the dynamics of qi in motion and repose—these have already been addressed in previous stages and need not wait until fetal breathing is perfected. However, before reaching the stage of elixir formation, the movement of qi often surges upward to the nipples (in men, it descends to the reproductive organ). Once the elixir is formed, the two nipples contract tightly like those of a maiden, and though internal movement persists, it can no longer manifest externally, remaining purely internal. Such movement occurs at intervals—sometimes once every few days, sometimes several times a day—depending on the diligence of one’s practice.

Before movement arises and after it subsides, all is still. The yang radiance should advance further, while the yin po-soul must be guarded against flight. Movement pertains to yang; stillness pertains to yin. When yang qi stirs, the primordial spirit moves with it; where qi travels in the body, the spirit follows. The activation of yang qi is called "advance," and by subtly aiding it with the spirit, it grows ever more vigorous—hence "further advance." When yang reaches its peak, yin arises; when movement reaches its extreme, stillness returns.

Man’s hun-soul belongs to yang and tends upward; the po-soul belongs to yin and tends downward. When it is time to ascend, do not force descent; when it is time to descend, do not force ascent. "Guard the yin po-soul against flight" means that if qi assumes a state of tranquil stability, the spirit must assist in maintaining that stillness to prevent restlessness and agitation.

Within the pool, the pearl holds its light;
Atop the mountain, the moon casts its glow.
The "pool" below symbolizes the region of the blood sea and womb; the "mountain" above symbolizes the area between the nipples and the chest center. The pearl’s light is concealed and restrained; the moon’s light is radiant and bright. "Within the pool" and "holds its light" describe the image of deep, hidden stillness; "atop the mountain" and "casts its glow" describe the mechanism of outward, manifest movement.

Do not slacken for even a moment through the six periods;
Nourish the medicinal sprouts to fatten them.
The "six periods" do not refer to the six divisions of day or night but to the six metaphorical phases of internal, silent cultivation. Ancient texts also speak of the "six seasonal nodes," but one must not rigidly adhere to celestial timing, lest a living method become a dead one. What, then, are the six periods of the human body? They are nothing other than the ebb and flow of spirit and qi, the ascent and descent of yin and yang.

"Do not slacken" means that thoughts must not arise, intention must not scatter; maintain a single thread without interruption or discontinuity. Only after completing this phase of practice may one act freely.

**Chapter Eight: Gathering the Medicine**

Half the mystery is realized,
The elixir’s head congeals like dew.
At this stage, half of the immortal’s entire practice is complete, for the internal elixir has formed. "Dew" is water from the earth that, heated, transforms into vapor and disperses into the air; at night, encountering cold, it clings to the most heat-dissipating objects and condenses into dew. The Dao of the elixir follows the same principle—it may be grasped through spiritual insight but cannot be conveyed in words.

Though life may be secured,
How can the form be refined?
Having formed the elixir, the essence, qi, and spirit of the entire body are fully consolidated, ensuring longevity—but one has not yet achieved transcendence. At this stage, one may be called a *human immortal*.

There are five ranks of immortals:
- *Ghost immortals*, who do not depart from the ghostly realm, possessing spiritual communication and enduring existence, unlike ordinary ghosts.
- *Human immortals*, who do not depart from the human realm, eating and dressing as others do yet free from the afflictions of aging, sickness, and death.
- *Earth immortals*, who do not depart from the earthly realm, untouched by cold or heat, hunger or thirst, and though they may not yet project their spirit, they are unburdened by the needs of clothing, food, or shelter.
- *Divine immortals*, who possess supernatural transformations, moving freely, shedding their physical forms, standing alone and unbound—dispersing into qi, coalescing into form.
- *Celestial immortals*, who, building upon the foundation of divine immortality, pursue further practice to transcend the world we inhabit, entering another realm beyond the measure of mortal sentiment.

The nose’s observation connects to pure yang;
Divine lead permeates the body with numinosity.
These two lines describe the concrete practice of transcending the mundane and entering the sacred—without this path, one cannot project the yang spirit. In the present age, aside from a few dedicated adepts, not only does no one practice this method, but even those who comprehend its principles are rare. Were I to venture my own interpretation, I fear it would be met with incomprehension and dismissed as delusion. Thus, I cite the ancient transmitted method of *"Refining the Form in True Emptiness"* to elucidate its profound meaning.

The *Method of Refining the Form in True Emptiness* states:
"Before a person is born, with each inhalation and exhalation, qi connects to the mother; after birth, with each inhalation and exhalation, qi connects to heaven. Heaven and humanity share a single qi, linked and flowing, mutually inhaling and exhaling like the pull of a saw. Heaven bestows it, and I can draw it in—obtaining qi, it flourishes and gives life. Heaven bestows it, then reclaims it—losing qi, it dissipates and brings death. Thus, the sage observes the Dao of heaven, grasps heaven’s movements, and at the time when the sun’s chariot has not yet risen from the Valley of Light, gathers the spirit in tranquil sitting, emptying the self to await it. Within, thoughts are relinquished; without, all entanglements are forsaken. Suddenly, heaven and earth are forgotten, the bodily form is pulverized (Daoist terms like 'pulverizing emptiness' or 'pulverizing the bodily form' merely signify forgetting the physical—one must not take 'pulverize' literally)."

Within the great void of nature, there gleams a single radiant yang—like dew, like lightning—which surges into the mysterious gate, pierces the long valley, and ascends to the mud-pill palace, where it transforms into sweet nectar and descends into the five viscera. I then stir the wind of Xun to meet it, driving out the evils lodged in the three barriers and nine apertures, sweeping clean the filth of the five organs and six bowels, refining the body and forging the essence, burning away dross and dispelling haze, drawing forth the foul and turbid frame to transmute it into a body of pure yang. With long and patient accumulation, the form is transformed, and one becomes immortal.

The *Song of Breaking Delusion* says:
*"Truly, after a hundred days of guarding against peril,
The blood turns to cream, the body shines like silver;
Truly, after a hundred days without loss,
Jade nectar flows, luminous light is born."*

The *Emerald Void* says:
*"Golden light suffuses the body, the marrow exudes fragrance,
Golden sinews and jade bones become wholly yang;
Refining until the red blood flows white,
Yin qi dissolves, and the body is naturally sound."*

Qiu Changchun says:
*"As long as you breathe, ever mindful,
The bodily frame is exchanged, jade liquid flows."*

Zhang Ziyang says:
*"Heaven and humanity share a single qi from the beginning,
Yet the bodily form obstructs its free flow;
Only when refining reaches the point where form and spirit merge in darkness
Does one know that form is none other than true emptiness."*

The methods of refining the form number six in total: the first is refining the form with jade liquid, the second with golden liquid, the third with the great yin, the fourth with the great yang, and the fifth with inner contemplation. Yet all these, though not the great Dao of emptiness, ultimately cannot unite with the great void. Only this one secret—called *refining the form through true emptiness*—though termed "active practice," is in truth non-action; though called "refining the form," is in truth refining the spirit. It is cultivation of the external that encompasses the internal.

Following this method for a hundred days, the seven po dissolve, the three corpses vanish, the six thieves lie hidden, and the ten demons flee afar. Refining for a thousand days, the four great elements of the body become like a crystal pagoda—translucent within and without, radiant inside and out, the flower of the heart blazing, the numinous light manifest.

Thus the *Scripture of Spirit Generation* says:
*"When body and spirit unite as one, it is the true body.
Body and spirit conjoined, form follows the Dao’s flow.
Concealed, the form is stabilized by spirit; revealed, spirit merges with qi.
Thus one treads water and fire unharmed, faces sun and moon without shadow.
Life and death lie in one’s own hands, entry and exit without obstruction,
Whether preserving form to abide in the world or shedding the frame to ascend as an immortal."*

Note: The work of refining the form through true emptiness encompasses a vast scope, not merely glossing this single verse. Even the later methods of refining the spirit, ingesting elixirs, fasting, wall-gazing, and spirit projection all fall within its application, differing only in stages according to the depth of practice.

*"Nurturing must be done with care; when fullness is achieved, one soars."*
"Nurturing" here means to temper and nourish. "Fullness" means qi is sufficient and the medicine potent. "Soaring" refers to the image of the great medicine surging through the passes. If taken to mean ascending into the sky, the time has not yet come.

*Refining the Spirit, Ninth Stage*

The Śarīra of former lives,
One day enters my embrace.
"Śarīra" is a Buddhist term; here it symbolizes the primordial spirit. "Former lives" refers to the time before this body existed. Our primordial spirit remains unchanged through kalpas, while what changes is the spirit of consciousness. Through the practice of refining the form with true emptiness, the spirit of consciousness is gradually refined away, and the primordial spirit gradually emerges. It is like polishing a mirror: once the dust and grime dissolve, radiance appears. Thus we know that all spiritual powers are inherently possessed by our original nature, not acquired from without.

This verse, "One day enters my embrace," seems to refer to the aspect of qi. Yet at this stage, qi and spirit are inseparable—speak of spirit and qi is within it; speak of qi and spirit is within it. Lü Zu’s *Song of Tapping the Trigram* says:
*"From the lead pool bursts forth golden light,
Mercurial fire flows like pearls into the imperial capital."*
"Lead pool" and "golden light" refer to qi;
"Mercurial water" and "flowing pearls" refer to spirit.
"The imperial capital" is the central cinnabar field, also called the Crimson Palace or Spirit Chamber, the domain of the heart. The heart is the sovereign of the body, hence the "imperial capital." The phrase "enters my embrace" carries the same meaning.

Hold it as one holds a fragile vessel,
Tender as one cradles an infant child.
Laozi says: *"To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping in time."* He also says: *"Those who preserve this Way do not wish to be full."* And again: *"Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible."* From this we may understand the intent of the next line in the verse. Laozi says: *"Concentrate qi to attain suppleness—can you be like a newborn babe?"* And: *"I alone am still, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile."* And: *"In life, humans are soft and weak; in death, stiff and strong."* From this we may grasp the meaning of the following couplet.

The earthly gate must be firmly sealed,
The heavenly pass must first be opened.
All references to "earth" pertain to the lower part of the body;
all references to "heaven" pertain to the upper part.
In cultivation, the greatest taboo is the leakage of essence and qi;
thus all lower orifices must be gathered and tightly sealed.
As the body’s essence and qi gradually accumulate and fill, unable to leak downward, they must surge upward to the brain. At this time, one hears the sound of wind in the ears, sees flashes of light before the eyes, feels tremors at the back of the head, and surges in the navel—many extraordinary phenomena arise.

The seventeenth-generation master of the Dragon Gate lineage, Hong Jiaosui of Guangxi, transmitted a *Song of the Golden Elixir* that has not yet circulated widely. I recall it contains these lines:
*"Ten thousand horses gallop, assaulting both ears,
Meteors and lightning strike the brows.
If you reach this point, do not be alarmed—
Firmly hold the heart and spirit, do not waver."*
This describes the phenomena of sealing the earthly gate and opening the heavenly pass.

Wash and cleanse the yellow sprout,
On the mountain’s peak, earth-shaking thunder.
Lü Zu, in instructing the Immortal Maiden Zhang, wrote in *Lyrics to the Toad Palace*:
*"Earth-shaking thunder on the mountain’s peak,
To wash and cleanse the yellow sprout as it emerges from the soil."*
"Yellow sprout" is another name for the Great Return Elixir. Here, "mountain’s peak" likely refers to the muddy pellet palace atop the head. The third poem in this sequence also says:
*"Mountain’s peak and ocean’s depths,
After the rain, a single thunderclap."*
Judging by the surface, there seems no difference;
in reality, however, the effects are vastly distinct.

The function of "washing and cleansing" is nothing other than stillness and stabilization. In the Dao of the Elixir, after a minor stillness, there must be a minor movement; after a great stillness, there must be a great movement. The deeper the power of stillness and stabilization, the greater the effect of the ensuing tremor. When the magnitude of this tremor reaches its fullness, it can directly burst open the crown gate and exit—yet this is only possible after a great stillness. Now, regarding the power of stillness and stabilization, we can take control ourselves, progressing from brief to prolonged, from shallow to deep. As for the effect of the tremor, however, it follows its natural course and cannot be forced by human effort, seeming beyond our control. Nevertheless, minor stillness invariably leads to minor movement, and great stillness invariably leads to great movement—this reaction never fails. The reason ordinary people lack such effects is their inability to achieve stillness and stabilization. The reason practitioners fail to attain great effects is that, though they know stillness and stabilization, their power in this regard remains insufficient. Those in the Buddhist tradition who study meditation may also achieve stillness for days on end, yet ultimately lack such effects because they merely know how to sit in meditation but not how to refine *qi*.

**Note:** Here, "śarīra" serves as a substitute term for the Internal Elixir, though it does not carry the original Buddhist meaning of relic. Whether *śarīra* and the Golden Elixir are the same or different, and what distinctions exist between the outcomes of Buddhist and Daoist cultivation, are questions of great urgency—yet none of the scriptures from any school have addressed them. While the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* speaks of the "ten kinds of immortals," this is merely the Buddhist perspective. Outside of Buddhist scriptures, no Chinese texts—ancient or modern—mention these ten kinds of immortals, so they cannot be taken as definitive. The Chinese disposition has always favored harmony: not only do Confucianism and Daoism share a common origin without conflict, but even toward the foreign religion of Buddhism, there is no discrimination. Instead, mutual integration prevails, a tolerance far broader than the exclusivist doctrines of other faiths. The Venerable Qinghua’s discussion of *śarīra* is particularly impartial. He states: Buddhism takes seeing the nature as its essence and does not value essence and *qi*. All things are born and perish, but nature is neither born nor perishes. After nirvāṇa, the original nature becomes perfectly luminous, transcending the three realms and forever escaping the cycle of rebirth. After cremation, the remaining essence and *qi* condense into *śarīra*, like a pearl emerging from an oyster—separate from spiritual nature. That it can radiate brilliant light is due to the concentration of essence and *qi* within it. The three treasures of the human body—essence, *qi*, and spirit—are originally inseparable, yet Buddhism uniquely seeks to illuminate the mind and see the nature, refining wisdom by extracting the light of spirit alone, leaving essence and *qi* to coalesce into form, discarded and unattended. Nevertheless, because all leaks have been sealed and the power of meditative concentration is profound, the essence and *qi* within the body are no longer ordinary. Thus, *śarīra* can transform, appear and disappear, and display varying hues of light.

From this, we may infer: what Buddhism calls the unborn and undying is spirit, that is, nature. *Śarīra* is essence and *qi*, that is, life. After a Buddha’s passing, the spirit has already transcended form, yet essence and *qi* remain bound within the world. Daoism, by contrast, cultivates both nature and life, merging essence, *qi*, and spirit into one. Through the fire phases of the celestial cycle, it refines a body beyond the body—spirit resides within it, essence resides within it, *qi* resides within it, and they cannot be separated. Thus, after ascension, whether the flesh transforms into *qi* or the corpse releases the spirit, no *śarīra* remains. If, by chance, *śarīra* is left behind after seated transformation, the practitioner’s daily work must have leaned toward Buddhism, emphasizing nature over life.

Those who cultivate both nature and life fuse the body’s essence, *qi*, and spirit into a luminous, vibrant whole. Bones and flesh dissolve, pores merge, blood becomes silvery nectar, and the body flows like fire, coursing through the four limbs and hundred joints, illuminating the realm of purity and emptiness. Thus, they can ascend or descend unpredictably, appear and vanish without trace. The difference between Buddhism and Daoism is this: Buddhism emphasizes refining nature, with solitary spirit shining beyond root and dust—this is called "nature’s longevity." Daoism emphasizes refining *qi*, with the entire body becoming purely yang and golden light radiating—this is called "*qi*’s longevity." Ultimately, at the supreme source, nature is *qi*, and *qi* is nature. What is the same is their reality; what differs is merely their names.

**Ingestion Tenth**
The Great Foundry shapes mountains and marshes,
Within them lies the sentiment of creation.
"Great Foundry" originally meant forging the five metals; here, it metaphorically describes the mighty work of creation. Heaven and earth serve as furnace and crucible, yin and yang as water and fire. All phenomena are forged from this, for all things share a single Supreme Ultimate. Mountains and marshes are but one thing among the myriad, yet within them lies creation—each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate. Mountains and marshes communicate *qi*, with *zhèn* and *duì* interacting, and the sentiment of creation becomes manifest.

For those who cultivate immortality, the key lies in gathering the pure, numinous *qi* of empty space within the body. Then, one’s spirit is combined with this *qi* and refined and nurtured. Over time, spirit and *qi* merge into one, and the Great Elixir is formed. The latter stages of practice are best conducted in the mountains, for the pure, numinous *qi* there is superior to that of cities. Yet even in the mountains, one must carefully select the terrain—whether building a thatched hut or dwelling in a cave—choosing a place sheltered from wind and gathering *qi*, with the mountain’s vein flowing behind, protective barriers on either side, a node at the center, and an open vista in front. This is the land where the generative *qi* of heaven and earth accumulates.

As the sun and moon rise and set, the wheel of creation turns. The Daoist who sits in meditation amidst this ceaseless motion draws in this boundless, pure, numinous *qi* to nurture the primordial spirit—how could one not undergo a transformation of bones and rebirth of the body? At dawn, one welcomes the *qi* of the solar crow; at night, one absorbs the essence of the lunar toad. Just as the clam receives the moon’s radiance to form its pearl, and the earth receives the sun’s essence to yield gold and jade, so too may a person gather the essences of sun and moon to congeal the immortal elixir and transmute the mortal frame.

As for the method of gathering these essences, at this stage, one naturally comprehends—there is no need to cling to outward forms, lest it hinder perfect adaptability. The "Method of Gathering Solar Essence and Lunar Radiance" described in the *Yijin Jing* pertains to the highest level of martial cultivation, not the profound mysteries of the immortal arts.

When the elixir is ripe for gathering, the years weigh lightly upon the body. To gather the numinous *qi* of heaven and earth and congeal the elixir, one must recognize the waxing and waning of yin and yang. To seize the profound mechanism of creation and transform the body requires the effort of three years and nine cycles.

Where the primordial spirit travels, the myriad pores radiate light. This speaks of the luminosity that manifests from every pore in the body. As the alchemical classics say: *"One morning, the work is complete, unknown to others—on all sides, palaces of night-shining jade appear."* This conveys the same meaning. The reason for this luminosity may lie in the body’s abundant electrical vitality. In the world, thunder and lightning naturally emit light, enduring through long ages without the slightest diminution of their essence. If even such mindless substances possess such marvelous potency, why doubt the immortal body?

**Chapter Eleven: Abstaining from Grains**
Having feasted on numinous *qi*, the lungs and viscera grow wondrously cool and pure—this is the true practice of cutting off cooked food. The ability to do so arises because the body is filled with numinous *qi*, naturally eliminating the desire for food, not merely enduring hunger on an empty stomach.

*"Forgetting the spirit without attachment, merging with the Ultimate to part from emptiness."*
"Forgetting the spirit" means that though wisdom is present, it is not employed—flaunting cleverness easily gives rise to demonic obstacles. "Without attachment" refers to having no form or appearance to cling to. "Merging with the Ultimate" means uniting with the Great Ultimate, where spirit and *qi* merge as one, and yin and yang intertwine. Thus, one does not fall into inert emptiness, hence "parting from emptiness"—meeting emptiness, one distances oneself from it. The third line speaks of non-attachment to form, the fourth of non-attachment to emptiness; with both form and emptiness forgotten, one abides in perfect samadhi.

At dawn, one seeks mountain taro; at dusk, one gathers marsh orchids. Taro is an ordinary food, known to all.

"Zhi" resembles a mushroom, with a cap above and a stalk below, its texture firm and smooth. *Bencao* records six varieties—green, red, yellow, white, black, and purple—all of which, when consumed, lighten the body and prolong life. Yet the divine scriptures list dozens or even hundreds of *lingzhi* names, though these are not obtainable by ordinary people.

If one mingles with the smoke of the kitchen fire, the body will never tread the Jasper Pool. The immortal’s form prizes purity and ethereality; if one does not abstain from cooked food, the turbid *qi* of the mundane will mingle within, and how can transcendence be hoped for? The "Jasper Pool" is the abode of female immortals. *Collected Biographies of Immortals* states: "The palace of the Queen Mother of the West is bordered on the left by the Jasper Pool and encircled on the right by the Emerald Waters."

**Facing the Wall, Twelfth**
All affairs are said to end—
still, one sits in the small niche.
The practice of "facing the wall" began with Bodhidharma. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, Bodhidharma dwelled at Shaolin Temple on Mount Song, sitting motionless facing the wall for nine years as if a single day. Thus, later Daoist practitioners of stillness cultivation all spoke of "facing the wall." Today’s Buddhists, however, no longer uphold this practice, merely reciting the name of Amitābha.

Once the barrier of grain avoidance is passed, not only can cooked food be forsaken, but even *zhi* and taro may be left uneaten. When ancient immortals reached this stage of cultivation, most chose to dwell in mountain caves, having others seal the entrance with massive stones to ward off wild beasts and the disturbances of human affairs, with no need for guardians. Yet this method may not suit the present age. A common approach is to build a few thatched huts in a quiet mountain forest for fellow cultivators to reside in. Then, one constructs a small niche from wood, just large enough for a single person to sit, with a soft, thick cushion. A door is set at the front, while the other three sides allow airflow without drafts, best covered with bamboo-slat curtains like those used on sedan chairs. Seated within, one disregards the passage of days and months until the yang spirit departs the body, marking the completion of the work. However, someone must keep watch day and night to guard against unforeseen dangers. If one does not wish to sit for long, temporary emergence is permissible.

At this stage, the body’s *qi* is full, eliminating the desire for food; the spirit is whole, dispelling the need for sleep. Outwardly, the breath ceases, the pulse stills, the body remains warm, and the eyes emit a radiant light. The inner workings of the body differ entirely from those of ordinary people and cannot be judged by conventional physiology. Such phenomena are not uncommon even today, for I have personally witnessed them. Yet none could discern what spiritual powers they possessed—perhaps this is what the alchemical classics mean by "wisdom present but unused"?

**Note:** From the third line of this verse to the end of the fourteenth, all describes inconceivable states, hence no annotations are provided. A certain lady once suspected I was deliberately withholding secrets and wrote to question me. Yet in my thirty years of seeking the Dao, I have never beheld the form of the yang spirit or how it departs. Even my teacher’s transmission did not touch upon this, merely stating, "When the time comes, you will know." Thus, regarding the various effects after the spirit’s departure, lacking direct experience, I dare not speak idly. If a practitioner truly masters the work of facing the wall, what fear is there of not knowing the matter of the spirit’s departure? I ask that you remain patient and await personal verification in the years to come.

**Departing the Spirit, Thirteenth**
Beyond the body, another body—
not formed by illusion.
**Note:** To leave this verse entirely unannotated would leave readers unsatisfied, yet to comment on each line would be difficult to put into words. Thus, I excerpt several passages from the records of past masters to illustrate the scene of the spirit’s departure and the further work thereafter. For full details, one must broadly study the alchemical classics and engage in true inquiry and realization—this text cannot encompass it all.

*Record of Elder Qinghua* states: "The omens before the yang spirit’s birth include light radiating outward from the navel wheel and fragrance issuing from the nose and mouth. After its departure, golden light shines in all directions, the pores gleam like crystal, like the sun rising over the sea or a pearl emerging from the deep. Fragrant mist fills the room, and with a thunderous crack, gold and fire intermingle as the yang spirit exits through the *niwan* [mud-pill palace]. After departure, all depends on one’s prior work. If the yang spirit is formed purely from primordial spiritual *qi*, it remains unstained by circumstances, unmoved by phenomena, gathered or released at will, coming and going freely. Upon re-entering the *niwan*, the body becomes fiery hot, golden light once more emanates from the pores, and fragrance again suffuses the air. In an instant, it returns to the Yellow Court, as if absent yet present, unknowing yet aware—this is the true state. If the mind has not attained emptiness and clarity, the embryo formed will not be the sacred embryo, and the spirit that emerges will carry impurities. At the sight of the fearful, terror arises; at the sight of the desirable, attachment arises. It may linger and forget to return, falling into demonic paths. Though the body appears to die, those unaware may think it an immortal’s transformation, yet if the yang spirit departs and does not return, the outcome is dire indeed."

Someone asked: "If the mind is not yet pure but the spirit has already departed, what is to be done?"
The master replied: "If unavoidable, there remains the practice of refining emptiness."

Though the embryo spirit has emerged, it must be tightly reined in to complete the work of refining emptiness before releasing it again. Then, within the true light of the Dharma-realm, it may roam freely at will, vast and transformative. Refining emptiness requires a vast and boundless heart—no self, no other, no heaven, no earth. In the clarity of empty qi, within the primal chaos, one discerns neither "I" nor "not-I," neither emptiness nor non-emptiness. Creation turns and revolves, undivided when divided, unmerged when merged—this is called refining emptiness. For the emptiness of the yang spirit merges with the Great Emptiness, fusing seamlessly, such that form and spirit are both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. This is the work after the spirit’s emergence, the task before the division of the body.

Someone asked: "What is the difference between yang spirit and yin spirit?"
The master replied: "If the yin has not been fully refined and the spirit emerges too soon, it is called yin spirit. When it departs, one may see a river of white light in the eyes, and the spirit exits through them; or hear the sounds of bells, chimes, flutes, and pipes in the ears, and the spirit exits through them. Because the yang qi is not yet robust, it cannot break through the Celestial Pass and thus takes a side path of convenience. After emerging, it too roams freely and joyfully, traversing streets and alleys, approaching waters and ascending mountains. It can assume form but not divide it; it can wander among humans but cannot soar or transform. Yet when the scorching summer sun hangs overhead, the yin spirit fears and avoids it. Thus, though it bears the wind of immortality, it has not escaped the realm of ghosts."

Someone asked: "Can the yin spirit be refined into a yang spirit?"
The master replied: "It can. Those who study the Dao and refuse to settle for the lesser vehicle must, after the yin spirit has emerged, undertake further refinement. They shatter the original form of the yin spirit, pour it into the golden tripod and jade furnace, and rekindle the fire. When the fire and timing are sufficient, the yin will be exhausted and the yang purified, and the true person will manifest."

Someone asked: "How can the original form of the yin spirit be shattered?"
The master replied: "Forget the body, empty the mind. In the vast emptiness, let no thing arise. Then one may exchange the mortal embryo for the sacred embryo, transform the mundane self into the true person, and the task is complete."

Someone asked: "After attaining a body beyond the body, what further work remains?"
The master replied: "An excellent question! There are two paths in this Dao: the lesser adept surrenders the body and departs swiftly; the greater adept merges with the body and departs slowly."

When the yang spirit pierces through the crown, it roams freely and joyfully in the Great Void, soaring tens of thousands of miles in an instant, treading upon clouds and mist, gazing down upon mountains and seas, transforming endlessly at will. Looking back at the illusory body, it is but a clod of dung and earth—better to cast it aside. Thus, one sheds the bones in the wilderness, leaves the form behind, and departs far away: this is the conduct of those who surrender the body and depart swiftly.

If a person of resolve seeks no hasty results and willingly undertakes the slow and patient work, the yang spirit may emerge yet remain unemerged, the illusory body may be abandoned yet remain unabandoned. Preserving the primordial numen, refining it through a thousand fires and ten thousand smeltings, one forgets the spirit as if it were the Great Void, yet with pure fire tempers it, transforming together with it. Flesh, bones, and form all turn to fine dust: this is the conduct of those who merge with the body and depart slowly.

Both paths are set forth here for one to choose. Should those of aspiration not take the higher way as their model?

From *The Recorded Sayings of Master Chongxu*, someone asked: "The emergence of the yang spirit need not necessarily entail a body beyond the body, as you have already made clear. But if there is truly no visible form, how can it be called the emergence of the spirit?"

The master replied: "The luminous nature of the original essence is neither existent nor nonexistent, neither non-nonexistent nor existent. How can its concealment and manifestation, its forms and appearances, be confined to one mode? Of old, the Perfected Liu Haichan emerged as a white vapor; the Patriarch Wang of Xishan emerged as a flowering tree..."

The Perfected Ma Danyang emerged with thunderous reverberations; the Primordial Lady Sun Bu’er emerged amid fragrant winds and auspicious qi. Though these several cases presented visible forms, they were not the human body. Moreover, Master Lan Yangsu of Nanyue departed with a clap of the hands and a great laugh; the Perfected Qiu Changchun himself said: when the spirit emerged, three times he struck through the Heavenly Gate, gazing straight down upon the forest of myriad phenomena, seeing mountains, rivers, and the great earth as if on the palm of his hand. These two cases showed no visible form, yet neither were they the body—why then cling to the notion that there must be a body beyond the body for the spirit to emerge?”

Someone asked: “Why do these differences arise?”

The master replied: “At the moment one emerges from samādhi, if by chance a thought stirs and aligns with the mechanism of emergence, there is none that does not manifest in accord with that thought. Thus, if the thought is not directed toward transforming the body, there need not be any visible form; if the thought is directed toward transforming the body, there need not be an absence of visible form. My words here are spoken only for those who have attained the Dao and become immortals within the lineages of our ancestral perfected ones—Zhong, Lü, Wang, Qiu, Li, and Cao. This is household talk for household members, not meant for the ears of heterodox practitioners or vulgar youths. Even if they hear it, it will be of no use to them. Those of later generations who receive the Dao within the lineage of our ancestral founder, the Perfected Qiu Changchun, must take heed and remember, lest they be startled or doubtful when the moment arrives.”

The aforementioned perfected ones are, respectively: Zhongli Quan (Zhengyang), Lü Dongbin (Chunyang), Wang Zhe (Chongyang), Qiu Chuji (Changchun), Li Niuwan, and Cao Xuanyang (Changhua). Perfected Cao represents the seventh generation of the Dragon Gate lineage, transmitting to the eighth generation, Wu Chongxu (Shouyang); Perfected Wu, in turn, transmitted to the ninth generation, Liu Huayang (Taichang). These words refer precisely to the lineage of the Wu-Liu Immortal School.

**Ascension (Fourteenth)**
The auspicious hour arrives, and one emerges from the valley,
In an instant, ascending to the divine Empyrean.
“Ascension” is what the vulgar call “ascending to heaven in broad daylight.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “Diligently practice it, day and night without rest; after three years of refining and ingesting, one becomes light and roams afar. Crossing fire, one is not scorched; entering water, one is not drenched. One can appear or vanish at will, abiding in eternal joy without care. When merit is complete, one ascends on high, receiving the registers and charts.”

Such accounts have existed since antiquity, yet in the present age, they remain unseen and unheard, and in theory, lack evidence. If one relies on the biographies of immortals through the ages, the tales come as readily as counting household treasures, and listeners may delight in them without tiring. Yet others may suspect them of being fabricated facts promoting superstition. Only when an ordinarily skeptical person—one who does not believe in the Dao of immortals—provides corroboration, whether in speech or writing, can doubt be dispelled.

Consider, for instance, the poem *Xie Ziran* by Master Han Tuizhi of the Tang:
In Guozhou’s Nanchong County, there lived a girl, Xie Ziran;
Naïve and ignorant in youth, she had only heard of immortals.
Light of life, she learned their arts, dwelling on Jinquan Mountain;
She spurned worldly splendor and renounced her parents’ tender love.
One day, seated in an empty chamber, clouds and mist arose within;
As if hearing the strains of sheng and yu, descending from the unseen heavens.
Eaves and pillars flickered in radiance, hues of five colors linked in succession;
Onlookers stood aghast, hesitating, none daring to draw near.
In an instant, she ascended lightly, drifting like smoke in the wind;
Vast and boundless the eight directions, no trace or echo to be found.
The village head reported the matter; the prefect marveled and sighed.
He drove his carriage, leading officials, while the common folk vied to lead the way.
Entering the chamber, they saw nothing—only robes and shoes, shed like a cicada’s molt.
All declared it the work of immortals, a tale so luminous it must be passed down.

The prefecture of Guozhou lies in present-day Shunqing Prefecture of Sichuan. This poem spans three hundred and thirty characters in total, with the first half narrating events and the latter half offering commentary. Nearly every derogatory term is heaped upon her—cold maiden, dull-witted child, mountain demon, phantom, gloom, desolate wind, unholy trickster, specter, netherworld, ghost, inanimate stone, monstrous transformation, fox spirit, malevolent curse, forsaken soul, deep grievance, uncanny marvel, lament—sparing no effort in slander. Clearly, Master Han harbored no belief in the existence of immortals. Yet his concluding argument amounts to no more than this: *"Human life follows constant principles; men and women each have their proper roles. Cold clothing and hunger are met by weaving and tilling. Below, this sustains descendants; above, it serves ruler and kin. To stray from this Dao is to abandon one’s true self."*

Alas! Such a perspective differs little from a frog at the bottom of a well or a louse in a monk’s robe—how could it satisfy our aspirations? The value of immortals lies in their achievements, surpassing the mundane a myriadfold, transcending all worldly suffering, and breaking every fetter of mortal existence—not merely in the name "immortal." Call them "immortals" if you will, or "demons and specters" if you prefer; what matters is the truth of the matter. The ascension of Xie Ziran was witnessed by all in her time; even the obstinate Master Han could not deny it. Yet, clinging to Confucian orthodoxy, rejecting Buddhism and Daoism, his stern demeanor crumbled—how could he bear to recant? Thus, he cloaked these divine signs in foul names, which is hardly surprising.

Reading the *Yongcheng Record of Assembled Immortals*, which recounts the wondrous life of the Perfected Woman Xie Ziran in meticulous detail, one hesitates to accept it as truth. Yet upon reading the lines of this poem—*"In an instant, she ascended lightly, drifting like smoke in the wind; entering the chamber, they saw nothing—only robes and shoes, shed like a cicada’s molt"*—one realizes the accounts of ascension are no deception. O later scholars, can you not take heed?

*Song of the Numinous Source Dao*
By Cao Wenyi of the Song Dynasty

I shall speak to you now of the truth:
The stem of life has ever dwelt in the true breath.
Illumine the body—longevity abides in emptiness that is not empty;
The numinous mirror embraces the heavens, cradling the ten thousand things.

The Supreme Polarity unfolds its wonders, and man attains the One.
Having attained the One, guard it well and never lose it.
Let the palace be empty and still, that spirit may dwell therein;
The numinous house, scorched and parched, dries up the blood and fluids.

A single sorrow, a single joy, a single thought or care,
A single indulgence, a single toil—each wears the body thin.
Morning’s harm, evening’s loss, unheeded and unknown,
Scatter and disorder the spirit, leaving it without support.

Gradually worn away, slowly declining,
The primordial qi is exhausted, and spirit departs.
They say sitting in meditation is also meditation—
Such may befit the sage, but not the common man.

Tender and fragile as a budding sprout, it must be nurtured;
Rooted in deluded perception, it shifts and changes.
Dawdling, one fails to clear the brambles—
When has fine grain ever sprung from a barren field?

After nine years, the work is complete, the fire and timing perfected.
Responding to things without intent, the spirit transforms swiftly.
Intentless intent—this is the true heart;
Forgetting both movement and stillness, one transcends desire.

Spirit is nature, qi is life.
When spirit does not stray outward, qi naturally settles.
These two, originally one—who is closer?
Lose them, and what remains to grasp as the root?

Merge them into one, then forget even that oneness—
You may then emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.
Piercing metal and stone is no longer difficult;
Sitting in liberation or standing in death—all is swift and fleeting.

This Way is easy to know but hard to practice.
Forget the practice, and the Way is complete.
Do not mistake breath-holding for the true task—
Counting breaths or following diagrams is not the way.

Of late, lay down the toils of the external world;
Yet within, the heart remains entangled—what difference is there?
Observe the infant in the womb—
Does it scheme or calculate in secret?

Concentrate the qi, attain softness, and spirit lingers long.
The true breath comes and goes, naturally at ease.
Gently, unbroken, it returns to the primordial life—
Without drawing from the numinous spring, it flows of itself.

Thirty-six thousand days make the great work,
Within which lie the rhythms of yin and yang.
Steaming and fusing, the meridians and sinews transform;
Everywhere, radiance shines—nothing is obstructed.

The Three Corpses depart the yin abode of the corpse;
The myriad lands come to pay homage at the Red Emperor’s palace.
I ask you: whence comes the Perfected One?
From the beginning, he has dwelt only in the numinous terrace.

Once, clouds and mist deeply obscured him;
Today, we meet, and the eye of the Way opens.
This is not the work of a day or a night—
It is my original truth, not some mere technique.

Firm as metal and stone in the biting cold,
Repelling the demons of yin with the power of wisdom—
All arises from emptiness and tranquility, refined and focused.
This is the land of purity in the dream of Hua Xu.

What foundation was first laid?
At the place of non-doing, all is done.
Banish the images that arise in thought;
In dreams, the spirit toils to hold fast.

Neither movement nor stillness—this is the great essential;
Neither square nor round—this is the ultimate Way.
When the primordial harmony circulates within, truth is realized;
Seeking it in the breath without is never complete.

If the primordial qi does not abide, the spirit cannot rest—
A worm-eaten tree, rootless, its branches and leaves wither.
No need to speak of tears, saliva, essence, or blood—
Trace them to their source, and all are one.

This thing has no fixed place;
It shifts and changes with the heart’s intent.
In the body, when heat is felt, it becomes sweat;
In the eyes, when sorrow is felt, it becomes tears.

In the kidneys, when desire arises, it becomes essence;
In the nose, when wind is felt, it becomes mucus.
Flowing and circulating, it moistens the entire body—
In the end, it does not depart from the water of spirit.

The water of spirit is hard to describe; few recognize it.
It sustains all life through the true qi.
Know only tranquility, free from thought and care;
Fast, quiet the heart, and moderate your speech.

A single taste of ghee and ambrosial nectar—
Hunger and thirst vanish, revealing true simplicity.
When the work is complete in time, you shall be free and at ease.
At first, the refining and forging are truly arduous.

Yet within this arduousness, there is no arduousness—
Leisurely, one need only nurture the primordial spirit.
Alas, the heart will not allow leisure—
At this point, even restraint depends entirely on the self.

I once suffered bitterly, more bitter still—
Eating bark, wearing grass, solitary and still.
Though I knew the great Way, I could not practice it—
Fame and reputation were the great afflictions of my body.

How does it compare, practicing in leisure,
To sitting in great stillness, utterly at peace?
Though form and spirit are said to be two, hard to unite,
One must first complete life before completing nature.

Do not chase fame or pursue profit;
Cut off human attachments, and all affairs cease.
The resolve lies with you—why linger?
Who else can control or restrain me?

What is the worth of a reputation that shakes the heavens?
Or writing essays as swiftly as a horse gallops—are these truly noble?
Wealth, fine clothes, food—all are of no concern;
Piling up jade and gold—what use is it?

Craftsmanship, literature, poetry, and prose—
All hinder the path of cultivation.
Like thin mist or light smoke,
Drifting idly beside falling flowers, following willow fluff—

Floating, leisurely, between heaven and earth,
Yet in the end, unable to become rain or dew.
Which is closer—fame or the self?
Half a lifetime’s years, spent in great procrastination.

Of late, I rely on spirit and qi for my practice,
Yet if spirit and qi are not at peace, the toil is in vain.
Pity this fine foundation—
A golden hall, a jade chamber, without a master.

If only the master could dwell there long,
Placed in emptiness, in idleness—
The wondrous existence within nothingness is hard to grasp;
To nurture the infant, one must rely on the mother.

Seal away clever speech, set aside brilliance,
Gather in the spirit, and feign foolishness.
With a steadfast heart and single intent, follow the path ahead—
The great Way will never betray a person.

*Plain Explanation of the "Song of the Numinous Source Dao"*
By Chen Yingning

**Reader’s Note:**
1. Though the *Song of the Numinous Source Dao* was written by a female Perfected, it is not exclusively a manual on female alchemical formulas. All who cultivate the Way—regardless of gender, age, or status—may practice this method with great efficacy, free from harm. It is among the most stable and universally accessible paths in the pursuit of immortality. Previously, scholars paid little heed to this work, leaving it buried for many years—a great pity. I have long wished to provide a plain explanation and publish it for circulation, but the opportunity never arose. Now, at the request of the Academy of Immortal Studies for teaching materials, the annotation is finally complete. With the Alchemical Scripture Publishing Society’s commitment to dissemination, publication has at last become possible.

Thus we may know that the success or failure of all worldly affairs hinges upon their proper timing and karmic conditions—nothing occurs by mere chance.

Second, the excellence of this text lies in its complete absence of cryptic language. From beginning to end, it expounds the truth with utter clarity, unlike other alchemical scriptures that fill their pages with terms like *Dragon and Tiger*, *Lead and Mercury*, *Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches*, *River Chart and Luo Scripture*, *Five Phases and Eight Trigrams*, leaving practitioners thoroughly bewildered. Though this commentary offers no particular distinction, it employs plain speech over literary language, adhering closely to the original text’s meaning while striving for simplicity. It is written so that even those with only basic literacy may grasp it at once, and further, may relay its teachings to those devoted to the Way yet illiterate. In this manner, the vow of universal salvation may gradually be fulfilled.

Third, some question why this text omits the female practice of *Severing the Red Dragon* and the male practice of *Refining Essence into Qi*, fearing that its teachings on life-cultivation (*minggong*) remain incomplete. Yet one must understand that the methods for women to halt menstruation and for men to seal the essence-gate each encompass both rapid and gradual approaches, as well as forced and natural techniques. The methods described in other texts are forced and rapid; those in this text are natural and gradual. When executed well, forced and rapid methods yield swift results, but if mishandled, they give rise to many afflictions and may even lead one astray. Natural and gradual methods, when practiced well, produce the same effects. If practiced poorly, they at most yield no results—never will they cause harm. By comparison, such methods are the most stable and free from pitfalls. Thus, the Perfected Master Cao transmitted this song to later generations not out of ignorance of *Severing the Dragon* or *Refining Essence*, nor from a desire to withhold secrets.

Fourth, one may ask: “Two-thirds of this text expounds profound principles, while one-third urges the severance of worldly attachments. Where, then, are the actual alchemical formulas?” The answer is this: For those who cultivate the Way, the most difficult tasks are comprehending profound principles and breaking free from worldly entanglements. Should one achieve these two, even if one has not yet devoted oneself to dedicated practice, one has already attained the necessary qualifications. When the day comes to earnestly apply the method, results will manifest with ease. Otherwise, even if you recite the formulas by heart, they will be of no use. If you insist on knowing where the formulas are concealed, I shall point them out to you. Within this text, four lines contain the most essential formulas:

1. *“When the spirit ceases its outward scattering, the qi naturally stabilizes.”*
2. *“Concentrate the qi to attain suppleness; the spirit will long abide.”*
3. *“Merge into oneness, then forget even that oneness.”*
4. *“When primordial harmony circulates within, one attains the true.”*

Once practice reaches this stage, the great work is complete—no further formulas need be sought.

Fifth, this text is not without its shortcomings, yet these are common to nearly all Daoist scriptures, not unique to this one. Surveying the Daoist texts of past and present, one finds they generally address three themes: extravagant descriptions of the wondrous, concealment of formulas, and exhortations to practice. Yet none attend to the practitioner’s living conditions—what dietary, residential, or daily-life conditions must be met to properly engage in cultivation. Nor do they consider whether failing to meet such conditions might hinder progress. This is because the social circumstances of ancient China differed vastly from those of today. The challenges faced by modern practitioners may have been unimaginable to the ancients. Those who seek to cultivate the Way in this age must carefully assess whether their environment and social conditions are conducive, lest they mistakenly attribute their lack of progress to the inefficacy of the method.

Sixth, this text propagates the great Dao, reveals the numinous source, directly points to *xing* and *ming*, and focuses solely on spirit and qi—hence its avoidance of terms like *Lead* and *Mercury*. Master Wang Dongting once remarked: “This song contains not a single word about Lead; all it speaks of is the true Mercury.” In my humble view, while the *spiritual water* mentioned herein may be likened to the true Mercury, the text also states: *“Spiritual water is hard to describe; few recognize it. All life arises from the true qi.”* This *true qi* refers to Lead, not Mercury. Moreover, cultivating the Way differs from refining elixirs. Were we to reverse the terms and speak of *cultivating elixirs* or *refining the Way*, others would surely mock our lack of linguistic precision, thereby clarifying the distinction between the two. For those who cultivate the Way, the return of postnatal spirit and qi to the prenatal *xing* and *ming* signifies the completion of merit—no further discussion of Lead or Mercury is necessary. Only in the *Three Primes* elixir method must one emphasize Lead and Mercury. Many Daoist texts conflate the cultivation of the Way with the refinement of elixirs, offering sweeping critiques that mislead later learners. Furthermore, Wang also observed: “All writings by female Perfected Ones speak of Mercury but not Lead, of Water but not Fire.”

For female Perfected Ones, their bodies belong to the *kun* phase, thus they cannot speak of yang Fire but only of yin tally. However, my humble observation notes that Sun Bu’er, the Perfected Sovereign, in her *Verses on the Stages of Female Elixir Practice*, includes the line *“Divine Lead permeates the body with numinosity,”* explicitly mentioning Lead. Moreover, the seventh poem in her collection is titled *“Tally and Fire,”* clearly referring to both yin tally and yang Fire. Thus, Wang’s assertion cannot be taken as an absolute principle.

Seven: In ancient times, those who studied the Way necessarily received oral transmission from a master, which is why Daoist texts of various schools contain no introductory procedures for beginners. Modern learners often regard this as a憾事. Some years ago, I encountered *The Five Great Health Cultivation Methods* by Hong Tai’an of Fuzhou, a work of clear and systematic instruction that may serve as a reference for beginners. Written on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China (1938), by Chen Yingning of Wanjiang, at the Shanghai Academy of Immortal Studies.

During the Xuanhe reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty, there was a Lady Cao who enjoyed considerable renown as a talented woman of her time. Emperor Huizong, by nature fond of the Dao and partial to those skilled in poetry and prose, held her in high regard, for her mastery of Daoist learning ranked among the finest, and her poetry and essays were indeed of no mean quality. He summoned her to reside in the capital (at the time, the Song capital was Bianjing, present-day Kaifeng County in Henan Province) and accorded her special favor. She was later bestowed the title *Wenyi Zhenren* ("Cultivated Recluse Perfected One").

*(Yingning’s note: The term* Zhenren *was a posthumous honorific used by later Daoist practitioners, not an imperial bestowal.)*

*(Yingning’s note: Cao Wenyi was a distant descendant of Cao Liyong, the prime minister during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song. At the age of twenty-one, she left home to become a Daoist nun and wandered across the land. In her later years, she was summoned to reside in Bianjing and was granted the title* Wenyi Dashi *"Cultivated Recluse Great Master." After her ascension, the court further bestowed upon her the posthumous title* Xiyuan Guanmiao Xiansheng *"Mysterious Master of the Abbey of Rare Origin." For details, see the second volume of* Bianjing Gouyi Ji *(*Records of Strange Happenings in Bianjing*), compiled by Song Lian of the Ming dynasty. When I first wrote these annotations, I had not yet come across this record, so I regrettably omitted the full account of her life.)*

This *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source* was composed by the Perfected Cao Wenyi during that period for the edification of Dao seekers. Having circulated to the present day, it has endured for approximately eight hundred and twenty years (reckoning from the early years of the Xuanhe reign). The *Stages of Female Alchemy in Verse* by Sun Bu’er appeared several decades later, while all other extant texts on female alchemy postdate Sun Bu’er, likely originating in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Though the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* was transmitted by Lady Wei of the Jin dynasty, it cannot be considered her own work. Similarly, while Xie Ziran and He Xiangu attained the Dao during the Tang, no writings of theirs survive (poems and prose produced through planchette writing at spirit altars cannot be attributed to their authors). Thus, we may affirm that among all formally composed alchemical texts written in the hand of female Perfected Ones throughout history—(Yingning’s note: Given the distinction between non-action and action-based methods, this work can only be termed a *Daoist text* rather than an *alchemical scripture*. The initial classification was an oversight, now duly corrected.)—this text stands as the most ancient.

The text comprises one hundred twenty-eight lines in total. The principles expounded and the practices discussed are not confined to women alone but may equally apply to men. Below, the original text is presented in sequence, with each short line annotated in vernacular as follows:

I, Cao Wenyi, now declare to all present and future seekers of immortality and cultivators of the Dao: the true root of life’s stem lies ever in the *true breath*.
*I*: Cao Wenyi referring to herself.
*All present and future seekers*: those who study immortality and cultivate the Dao in her time and thereafter.
*True root*: the genuine and certain foundation.
*Life’s stem*: the most vital locus of human life. As the stem connects flower, leaf, melon, or fruit to the branch, so this point, once severed, causes flower and leaf to wither instantly and fruit to cease its growth.
*True breath* differs from *ordinary breath*. Ordinary breath is coarse; true breath is subtle. Ordinary breath is shallow; true breath is deep. Ordinary breath is swift; true breath is slow. True breath is the source of ordinary breath; ordinary breath is the manifestation of true breath. True breath may transform into ordinary breath, and ordinary breath may likewise return to true breath. For example, the spring water flowing from a crevice in a mountain stone is true breath; the surging, wind-tossed current of a great river is ordinary breath.

Illumine the body to attain eternal life—empty yet not empty, the numinous mirror embraces heaven’s countenance and holds all things.
*Illumine the body*: to turn the light inward and reflect upon one’s own nature.
*Eternal life*: the perpetual existence of the nature-body.
*Empty*: the nature-body is fundamentally empty. Yet because this nature-body encompasses all, true emptiness and wondrous being appear simultaneously, and thus it is also said to be *not empty*.
*Mirror*: a reflective surface. *Numinous mirror* refers to the nature-body.
*Embraces heaven’s countenance and holds all things*: the numinous mirror contains and encompasses heaven and earth, all myriad things.

The second line speaks of *ming* (life-destiny); the third and fourth lines speak of *xing* (nature).

The Supreme Ultimate unfolds its wonders; humanity receives the One—guard it well, lest it be lost.
The *Book of Changes* states: “The *Yi* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.” The *Daodejing* states: “These two emerge together yet bear different names; together they are called the Mystery. Mystery of mysteries, the gateway of all wonders.” This is the meaning of the Supreme Ultimate unfolding its wonders.
*The One* is the Dao. To *receive the One* is to attain the Dao. Laozi says: “The Dao generates the One.” Master Zhou says: “Non-Ultimate and yet Supreme Ultimate.” Laozi says: “The One generates the Two.” Confucius says: “The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes.” Thus we may understand: the Dao is the Non-Ultimate; the One is the Supreme Ultimate; the Two are the Two Modes; the Two Modes are yin and yang; yin and yang are *xing* and *ming*; *xing* and *ming* are spirit and *qi*.
The Dao cannot be spoken or seen. Whatever can be spoken or seen is either the Two or the Three. For example: above and below, left and right, front and back, large and small, long and short, thick and thin, many and few, light and heavy, cold and hot, hard and soft, auspicious and inauspicious, beneficial and harmful, good and evil, right and wrong, empty and full, being and non-being, *xing* and *ming*, spirit and *qi*, yin and yang—all these paired opposites are the Two. That which lies between these Two is the Three. Once the Three arises, it may evolve into thousands and tens of thousands. Thus Laozi says: “The Three generate the myriad things.” Since the myriad things arise from the Dao, we humans, called the most numinous of the myriad things, are also born of the Dao. Without the Dao, there would be no world, nor would there be humanity.
That *humanity receives the One* means each person receives an infinitesimal portion of the Dao in its entirety. Yet this portion is exceedingly minute. If we were to lose even this tiny measure, we might not even attain human form in the next life, gradually descending into lower, baser creatures. Therefore, the author urges all to cherish this human birth, ever vigilant and cautious, safeguarding this Dao, lest it be lost.

Palaces lie vacant and serene—spirit naturally abides; the crucible of the numinous palace scorches the blood dry.
*Palaces lie vacant and serene*: a metaphor for the human body free of vices, harmful habits, deluded thoughts, and scattered intentions. If so, the primordial spirit naturally dwells securely within, never adrift or lost, never wandering without return. Yet in this world, people’s hearts are ceaselessly disturbed by the seven emotions and six desires, never knowing a moment of cool clarity.

When passions and desires stir, the yin fire follows in motion. As the yin fire moves, the qi, blood, and fluids of the entire body suffer harm, leaving one sallow and emaciated, the countenance withered and gaunt. The root of this affliction lies in the inability of every heart to see through and let go. Thus it is said: *the crucible of the numinous palace scorches the blood dry.*

The origin of human consciousness and thought is called the *numinous palace*. A single sorrow, a single joy, a single reflection, a single indulgence, a single strain—each wears away the body. When things go awry, one grieves; when fortune smiles, one rejoices. Faced with unsolvable difficulties, one broods. Fearful of not gaining what is desired, and once gained, fearful of losing it, the mind is ceaselessly taxed. Nine-tenths of the circumstances we encounter are setbacks; moments of success are rare. Within the fleeting decades of life, all is consumed by worry and suffering.

To relax the body and mind is indulgence; to tense them is strain. Alternating between indulgence and strain, the body cannot endure such ceaseless agitation and naturally decays into irreparable decline. *The form gnawed and ruined* describes the inner corruption of the body, like wood devoured by worms.

*Morning’s harm, evening’s loss*—blindly unaware of the peril, the spirit dissipates in confusion, unmoored. If asked how to live well in this world, or how to cultivate the Dao and attain liberation, they have not the slightest certainty. Gradually worn thin, slowly depleted, the primordial qi is exhausted, and the spirit departs.

As this gradual erosion unfolds, the harm to our bodies goes unfelt, sparing us sharp pain. As aging creeps in by degrees, the decades of a human life slip by all too easily, unnoticed. Unaware, our hair turns white; unnoticed, our skin wrinkles. Unaware, our blood dries up; unnoticed, our sinews stiffen.

Primordial *qi* is the original harmonious *qi* of the beginning. It is also called precelestial *qi*. Strictly speaking, it is the vital force that gives birth to heaven, earth, humanity, and all things. Though the vital force in the cosmos is boundless, the portion each person carries from the womb is pitifully small. From childhood to old age, over decades, the vital force stored within the body is exhausted, and our soul must then bid farewell to our flesh. When form and spirit part, how can one not die?

They claim that even mediocre Chan practitioners and sages can achieve this—yet it is not so for ordinary beings. *Chan* may be understood as *samādhi*. Those who strike lofty tones all know how to say: "In walking, there is *samādhi*; in sitting, there is *samādhi*; even in sleep and repose, there is *samādhi*—no need for any effort." If one were to practice diligently morning and night, they would dismiss it as excessive attachment, lacking in spontaneity and natural insight. Some might mock it as "polishing a brick to make a mirror." Yet such words may only be spoken to those of the highest caliber, not to ordinary people. Sages may act thus, but common folk can never attain it.

The tender sprout must be nurtured in restraint, for when root and perception fall into confusion, change comes all too easily.

When plants first emerge from the soil as seedlings, they are called "sprouts." Their substance is fragile and delicate, unable to withstand harm. They must be cultivated with proper methods and protected with care, only then may they one day grow into useful timber. This illustrates how the vital qi within the human body, if its foundation is unstable, is most easily lost. One must find a way to contain it within the body, preventing its constant dissipation outward—only then may one’s lifespan be extended.

The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are called the six roots. The functions they give rise to are the six perceptions. When roots and perceptions are disturbed by worldly dust, they fall into confusion, readily shifting from good to evil, from uprightness to depravity. Without the utmost diligent effort, one fears there will be no favorable outcome.

If one idly lets time slip by without clearing the brambles, who has ever heard of fine crops growing in a wasteland?

In a fallow field, thorns and brambles grow thick. If one is lazy and negligent, idle and indolent, failing to cut away the brambles in the field, good rice will never grow. These two lines compare how, if the deluded thoughts and bad habits in the human mind are not eradicated, progress in cultivation will be difficult, and good results will not easily appear.

When nine years of practice are complete and the firing process is perfected, one responds to things without intention, and spiritual transformation comes swiftly.

Nine is the supreme number among yang numbers. "Nine years" signifies pure yang—it does not necessarily mean precisely nine years. "Practice complete" means the work is perfected. "Firing process perfected" means that, by this stage of cultivation, one may bring a phase to its conclusion. "Responding to things" means engaging in worldly affairs to benefit others. "Without intention" means acting in accord with conditions, not deliberately seeking merit. "Spiritual transformation comes swiftly" means that when one applies their whole spirit to teaching and transformation, the effects naturally manifest quickly. As the *Mencius* says: *"What one passes through is transformed; what one abides in is spirit."* This conveys the same meaning.

The heart without intention is the true heart; forgetting both movement and stillness is liberation from desire.

The "heart without intention" refers to the essence of the heart free from thoughts. Ordinary people’s minds never rest from thoughts for even a minute. They mistake these thoughts for the true essence of the heart, but this is incorrect. You must understand that the heart without thoughts is the true heart, while the heart with thoughts is false. Once one recognizes the true heart, every movement and stillness becomes an expression of Heaven’s mechanism, allowing one to reach the state of forgetting both things and form—this is what is called "liberation from desire."

Spirit is nature, while qi is life—when the spirit does not stray outward, qi naturally settles.

Ancient alchemical classics often say: *"It is nature and life, not spirit and qi."* This is directed at those of deep cultivation and advanced attainment. Here, *"Spirit is nature, qi is life"* is stated for ordinary practitioners. Each serves its purpose and is not contradictory.

For ordinary people recognize only their own physical bodies. Beyond the body, they never pay attention to spirit and qi. If one can teach them to recognize the functions of these two words—spirit and qi—it already marks a great advancement over the average person. The true reality of "nature and life" must be left for them to contemplate in the future. In the initial stages of cultivation, one cannot do without spirit and qi. One must first gather one’s spirit within the body, and only then can qi settle.

Originally, these two are most intimately close—what could be more dear?
These two things are spirit and qi. They are inherently inseparable. If spirit leaves qi, it has nothing to nourish it; if qi leaves spirit, it has nothing to guide it. Without qi to nourish spirit, spirit will flee; without spirit to guide qi, qi will dissipate. To lose one is to lose both. What then remains to serve as the root of our body or the handle of our self?

Merge them into one, then forget even that oneness—thus may one emerge and submerge in unison with the primordial transformation.
To "merge them into one" means to practice such that the heart and breath depend on each other, spirit and qi unite. To "forget that oneness" means that after achieving unity, one must not cling rigidly to it but should let go of even this state of unity. Only when one can unite and then forget that unity will the qi within the body naturally rise and fall in harmony with the mechanism of primordial transformation. When the transformative mechanism should manifest, it manifests; when it should conceal itself, it conceals—without the slightest assertion of self.

Piercing metal and penetrating stone present no difficulty; sitting liberation or standing departure occur in an instant.
Ordinary people’s spirit is confined by the body and cannot directly reach external matter. Those who have succeeded in cultivation can separate their spirit from the body and command matter beyond it—thus piercing metal and penetrating stone present no difficulty. "In an instant" means within the blink of an eye. "Sitting liberation or standing departure" means that whether sitting or standing, if the spirit wishes to leave the body, it can do so in an instant, unconstrained by the body.

This Dao is easy to understand but difficult to practice—only when action is forgotten is the Way complete.

Even if one forces oneself to practice diligently, completion remains elusive. One must progress from forced effort to spontaneity, from spontaneity to utter integration, and from integration to effortless release—only then is it true that "when action is forgotten, the practice of the Way is complete."

Do not mistake breath-holding for the true work, nor counting breaths or following diagrams as the proper method. *Xi* (息) refers to the breath through the nostrils. *Bi xi* (闭息) means temporarily holding the breath. *Shu xi* (数息) means counting one’s breaths—from one, two, three, four, up to dozens or hundreds. *An tu* (按图) means practicing according to diagrams, either by fixating the mind on a single cavity within the body or by moving the hands and feet through various postures. None of these methods constitute the Great Dao. For breath-holding strains through force, counting breaths wearies the mind, and following diagrams fosters attachment—all far removed from the natural Great Way.

How is recent abandonment of external distractions, only to be entangled by internal concerns, any different?

Master Cao’s meaning is this: those who cultivate the Dao in these recent times have already set aside all worldly distractions beyond the body—why then cannot they set aside the distractions within, still clinging to so many concerns in the heart? I ask you: how does being entangled by the hundred affairs of the inner self differ from being bound by the myriad dusts of the outer world?

Consider the infant dwelling in the womb—during those ten months in the mother’s belly, did it ever secretly scheme or calculate? Since you seek to learn the Dao, why not first learn from the infant?

*"Focus the qi to attain suppleness—can you be like the infant?"*
Thus says the *Dao De Jing*, Chapter Ten.
*"Focus the qi"* means to concentrate the mind single-pointedly upon the qi in one’s practice.
*"Attain suppleness"* means to refine one’s work to the utmost softness, without the slightest rigidity or haste.
If one can achieve this, the spirit will long abide within the body, never straying outward.
*"When the spirit does not stray outward, the qi naturally settles."*
Once the qi settles, the true breath will arise of its own accord.
*"Leisurely, leisurely"*—these words describe the manner of the true breath: deep and enduring, gentle and unhurried.

*"Unbroken and winding, it returns to the root of life—without drawing from the numinous spring, it ever flows of itself."*
*"Unbroken"* signifies the ceaseless, subtle continuity.
*"Winding"* suggests its meandering, unbroken progression.
The *"root of life"* is the very source of human existence.
This line depicts the movement of the true breath within the body—though it reaches every limb and bone, it naturally returns to its origin.
The *"numinous spring"*—later called *"spirit-water"*—flows downward on the earth’s surface, never upward; to use it, one must draw it with vessels.
Yet the numinous spring within the body requires no drawing—it circulates naturally throughout the entire form.
Wherever the true breath arrives, the numinous spring arrives.
For saliva transforms into qi, and qi transforms into saliva, filling the whole body—thus its wondrous function.

*"Thirty-six thousand marks the great work—within it lie the rhythms of yin and yang."*
In the modern calendar, a day and night comprise ninety-six *ke*; in the ancient calendar, a hundred *ke*.
Master Zhang Ziyang’s preface to *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states:
*"A year has twelve months, a month thirty days, a day a hundred ke—one month totals three thousand ke, ten months thirty thousand ke. Whether moving, standing, sitting, or lying down, maintain unbroken awareness. Once the fetal qi congeals, the infant manifests; the Mysterious Pearl takes form, the Supreme Unity unites with the Real. Within these thirty thousand ke, one may seize thirty thousand years of celestial time—why? Because each ke of practice contains a year’s seasonal rhythm. Thus thirty thousand ke can seize thirty thousand years. Hence, a year’s twelve months total thirty-six thousand. Even the dullest of men, by practicing this, may ascend to sagehood—yet how is it that the common folk use it daily without knowing?"*

This passage is quite clear and may serve as commentary here.

Cao Wenyi lived during the Xuanhe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, 790 years before the Republican era. Zhang Ziyang lived during the Xining era of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, approximately 840 years before the Republican era. The two were separated by no more than fifty years, and thus their doctrines share considerable similarity.

*Steaming fuses, joints and vessels transform—*
*In every part, radiance shines, nowhere obstructed.*

These two lines describe the effects of the practice. *Steaming* refers to evaporation, *fusing* to dissolution; *joints* are the body’s articulations, *vessels* its blood channels, and *transform* the process of change. First comes evaporation, then dissolution. Through constant dissolution, hardness is prevented, allowing gradual transformation. This practice is called "Golden Elixir Bone-Transmutation." *Radiance shining in every part* echoes the *Sun Bu’er’s Scripture of the Female Elixir*, which states, "Where the primordial spirit travels, all orifices emit light." *Nowhere obstructed* means the entire body is fully unblocked, with no closures anywhere.

*The Three Pengs depart the yin-corpse’s abode—*
*Myriad realms pay homage at the Crimson Emperor’s palace.*

The *Three Pengs* are the Three Corpses. Daoist texts state: "The upper corpse, named Peng Ju, dwells in the head, causing foolishness and lack of wisdom; the middle corpse, named Peng Zhi, resides in the chest, stirring vexation and preventing clarity; the lower corpse, named Peng Jiao, lodges in the abdomen, inciting cravings for food, drink, and sensual desires." They are also called the Three Corpse Spirits or Three Corpse Worms. The *Great Clarity’s Central Scripture of the Yellow Court* contains the lines: *"Alas for the twelve towers of the Mysterious Palace—who knew they would become the abode of the Three Worms?"* This means that our pure and refined bodies are infested by the Three Corpse Worms, rendering them filthy and wretched—a great pity.

Daoist methods for slaying the Three Corpses include talismans, incantations, observing the Gengshen day, or ingesting elixirs, but none offer a thorough resolution. Here, through internal refinement, one circulates the primordial harmonizing *qi* to fill the viscera, steaming and fusing the joints and vessels, transforming the sinews and bones. This forces the Three Corpses to abandon their lair and flee. Once the corrupt departs, the pure arrives.

All nations paying homage—this metaphor describes how the essence, *qi*, and spirit of the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, and hundred bones all converge in the Crimson Palace. The Crimson Palace pertains to the region of the heart; the heart belongs to fire, its color is red, and physicians call it the "Palace of the Sovereign Lord," hence its name, the "Palace of the Red Emperor."

I ask you: whence comes the True Person?
From of old, he has dwelt only in the Numinous Terrace.
The True Person is the true self. Our physical body, subject to birth and death, cannot be called the true self—it is but a provisional self. Setting aside the corporeal form, what remains is that intangible thought. Can this be called the true self? No, for even that thought arises and vanishes inconstant, not subject to our mastery. Only when we further set aside these fleeting thoughts and discover instead an indestructible entity—eternal across ten thousand kalpas—do we find the true self, also known as the True Person. This True Person, though never before seen, is now met for the first time. Yet whence does he come? In truth, he has always resided within our Numinous Terrace, never once departing, nor has he entered from without.

*Of old, thick clouds and mist obscured him—
Today we meet as the Dao-eye opens.*

For years, clouds and mist have veiled the True Person’s visage. Though he has always dwelt within the Numinous Terrace, we could not recognize him. Now, as our practice reaches a certain depth, the Dao-eye opens. With the Dao-eye opened, it is as though clouds and mist are swept away to reveal the blue sky, and the True Person thus appears. The "clouds and mist" are metaphors for our seven emotions, six desires, deluded thoughts, and scattered notions.

*This is no work of a morning or an evening—
What I find is my original truth, not some artifice.*

This practice cannot be accomplished in a day or a night; it requires the passage of many years. Nor is it a matter of clever techniques or seeking unexpected gains—it is merely the rediscovery of our original true face.

*In the biting cold, firm as metal and stone,
Driving back yin demons, wisdom and power grow.*

The *Analects* states: *"Only in the cold of winter do we know that the pine and cypress are the last to wither."* "Biting cold" refers to the year’s most frigid season. "Wither" describes trees shedding their leaves. That the pine and cypress wither last means that while other trees have withered and fallen by this time, the pine and cypress remain verdant. This illustrates how those who cultivate the Dao possess enduring strength, able to endure hardship and tribulation without wavering in their resolve. "Firm" shares the same meaning as "steadfast." Even the unwithering pine and cypress are deemed steadfast, yet metal and stone are even more so. Thus, here metal and stone serve as metaphors for the resolve of the Dao cultivator. With a will as unyielding as metal and stone, one naturally repels yin demons. Once yin demons are wholly dispelled, wisdom and power simultaneously increase. "Wisdom" is insight; "power" is fortitude. Without fortitude, one may glimpse the Dao but cannot fulfill it. Without insight, one risks misrecognizing the great Dao and straying into side paths. Only when both wisdom and fortitude are complete can regret be avoided.

*From emptiness and tranquility, returning to refinement and focus—
This is the Pure Land of Huaxu.*

To be free of deluded thoughts and desires is emptiness; to be unstained by any craving or vice is tranquility. To investigate thoroughly and comprehend fully is refinement. To accept and uphold with unwavering constancy is focus. The *Liezi* states: *"The Yellow Emperor, napping by day, dreamed he wandered in the land of Huaxu. In that land, there were no teachers or rulers. Its people had no desires."*

"Unknowing of closeness to self, unknowing of distance from things—thus free from love and hate.
Unknowing of opposition, unknowing of compliance—thus free from benefit and harm."
This is, in truth, a parable, akin to what moderns call a utopia.
If one’s heart could attain perfect purity, it would be as though one had arrived in the land of Huaxu.

At first, how does one establish a foundation in non-action where nothing is left undone?
In worldly affairs, whatever one undertakes, one must first establish a foundation before any achievement is possible.
The cultivation of the Dao is a great endeavor; one must stabilize the foundation to advance step by step.
When skill is refined and attainment profound, all things naturally manifest the Dao.
Outwardly, it may seem as though nothing is done,
yet in reality, essence is complete, qi is complete, spirit is complete—without the slightest deficiency.
Laozi’s *Daodejing*, Chapter Three, states: *"Act through non-action, and nothing is left ungoverned."*
Chapter Thirty-Seven again says: *"The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone."*
This passage’s *"at the place of non-action, nothing is left undone"* likewise follows Laozi’s meaning.

Within thought’s realm, images must be uprooted;
in dreams, the spirit must be firmly held.
These two lines describe the method of establishing the foundation.
When one sits in meditation, one must sweep clean the heart’s stray thoughts.
Once sitting practice is mastered, stray thoughts can be entirely extinguished.
Then, even in sleep and dreams, one does not forget the work of cultivating the Dao,
remaining as composed as in ordinary meditation, fully self-possessed.

Non-movement and non-stillness are the great essentials;
non-square and non-round are the supreme Dao.
If practice leans toward movement, it risks excessive restlessness;
if it leans toward stillness, it risks excessive desiccation.
If temperament leans toward square, it risks rigidity;
if it leans toward round, it risks slickness.
Only by avoiding both extremes and attaining harmony is the great Dao realized.

Refining primordial harmony within completes true breath;
seeking without only prolongs unending toil.
If one can circulate within the body the primordial, harmonious qi without cease, one may attain the Dao.
But if one clings forever to external breathing, refusing to relinquish it, one will never achieve liberation.
If primordial qi does not abide, spirit cannot settle;
a worm-eaten tree, rootless, withers its branches and leaves.
Primordial qi is the primordial, harmonious qi mentioned above.
If it does not abide—if it cannot long remain within the body but leaks outward—
excessive dissipation depletes the body’s primordial qi.
As the primordial qi wanes, the primordial spirit, lacking nourishment,
cannot remain within the body and must flee.
Like a tree infested by borers, its roots damaged, its branches and leaves naturally wither.
When the body’s primordial qi is harmed by the seven emotions, the six desires, hunger and satiety, cold and heat, mental strain and physical toil, the body cannot endure.

Set aside talk of snivel, spittle, blood, and essence—
tracing to their source, all are one.
The fluid produced by the nose is called snivel; that from the mouth, spittle;
that from the heart, blood; that from the external kidneys, essence.
Though these four bear different names, their fundamental origin is the same.
To *reach the root* is to see through to their source.

To *trace to their source* is to investigate their origins.
These substances have never held fixed positions—they transform in response to circumstances and the mind’s intent.

The various fluids of the human body are not partitioned into rigid domains, confined to one place without movement.
Rather, they arise in the moment, shaped by external stimuli and internal impulses.

When the body senses heat, they become sweat;
when the eyes sense grief, they become tears.
The fluids within the skin, stirred by high external temperatures, transform into sweat and emerge through the pores.
The fluids within the eyes, moved by overwhelming sorrow, transform into tears and flow from the tear ducts.

When the kidneys sense desire, they become essence;
when the nose senses wind, they become snivel.
The fluids within the external kidneys, aroused by lustful thoughts, transform into essence and issue from the urethra.
The fluids within the nasal membranes, chilled by cold winds, transform into snivel and flow from the nostrils.

Flowing freely throughout the body, they moisten the whole—
yet in the end, they never depart from the *spiritual water*.
*Vertical* refers to the body’s upper and lower.

Horizontal refers to the body’s front and back, left and right. *Flowing and turning* describes its circulation throughout the body. *Moistening the whole* means it reaches and nourishes every part without exception. That such transformations and effects arise at all is due ultimately to the workings of *spiritual water*.

This treasure of *spiritual water* is so profound in principle that words can scarcely describe it. Though the learned abound in the world, few recognize it. Know that sweat, tears, snivel, spittle, essence, and blood all derive from *spiritual water*, and *spiritual water* itself arises from *true qi*. Without *true qi* in the body, *spiritual water* will inevitably dry up. Once *spiritual water* is exhausted, the eyes cannot see, the ears cannot hear, the nose cannot smell, the tongue cannot taste, the generative organs cannot reproduce, and the limbs and joints cannot move. At this stage, death is not far off.

Note: What scholars of alchemical classics find most perplexing is that the same term may be used interchangeably across different methods. For instance, the term *spiritual water* is explained here in this way, yet in other alchemical texts, though the term appears identically, its meaning may differ entirely. Consider Zhang Ziyang’s postscript to *The Understanding Reality Classic*: “The essence of the Golden Elixir lies in *spiritual water* and the *Flowery Pond*.” Again, in Zhang Ziyang’s *Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir*, he writes: “When lead encounters mercury, it is called the *Flowery Pond*; when mercury enters lead, it is called *spiritual water*.” This refers to *spiritual water* in the Human-Realm Elixir method. In Zhang Ziyang’s *Secret Formula of the Golden Medicine*, he states: “Golden water is the mysterious water that partakes of the metal’s qi, also called *spiritual water*. The secret of elixir refinement is simply to guide *spiritual water* into the *Flowery Pond*—then all is accomplished.” In Xu Zhenjun’s *Stone Casket Record*, the *Sacred Stone’s Mysterious Pointer* reads: “Lead sand is kneaded into clods, sealed with the Six-One method and cherished. Fired for a day and night, the flame dies, the smoke clears, and the earth turns to ash. The ascending lead is inverted into the ash pond, where fire melts it into *spiritual water*.” This is *spiritual water* in the Heaven-Realm Elixir method. The *Mirror Casket* states: “If one knows true mercury, within yellow gold lies *spiritual fire*; if one knows true lead, within white gold lies *spiritual water*.” Bai Ziqing’s *True Formula of the Earth-Realm* says: “The *Flowery Pond’s spiritual water*—*spiritual water* is true gold. Flashing with primordial radiance, it releases the Qian-metal’s potency.” This is *spiritual water* in the Earth-Realm Elixir method. Lingyangzi’s *Secret Canon of the Grotto-Heaven* writes: “Yin-yang lead and mercury become *spiritual water*; its workings never depart from lead. Who recognizes the *spiritual water* of the elixir furnace? It is the moon’s essence and golden nectar.” Wu Chongxu’s self-commentary in *Songs of Immortal Cultivation* notes: “‘Dark advancement’ refers to the subtle infusion of *spiritual water* and *spiritual fire*, pertaining to the work of refinement. ‘Bright advancement’ refers to the overt infusion of *spiritual water* and *spiritual fire*, pertaining to the work of transcendence.” Zhu Chibo’s *Lamp of Gold and Fire* states: “Raw lead contains only *ren-water* and *kui-water*; once refined into white gold, *spiritual water* emerges within.” This is *spiritual water* in the art of aurifaction.

The term *spiritual water* in the various alchemical classics listed above differs as vastly from that in *The Song of the Great Dao’s Spiritual Source* as heaven does from earth. Langranzi’s poem reads:
*“The spinal river-carriage pierces the crown gate—
this is the swiftest path of true cultivation.
Frequently swallowing the *Flowery Pond’s spiritual water*,
the Purple Mansion’s Primordial Lord ascends directly.
Ever let qi surge through the joints,
and naturally essence fills while the Valley Spirit abides.
One day attaining the path of longevity,
grateful for the guidance once received.”*
Here, the term *spiritual water* refers specifically to the saliva in the mouth—its narrow sense. In *The Song of the Great Dao’s Spiritual Source*, *spiritual water* encompasses all coarse and fine fluids of the body—its broad sense. Though the meanings overlap, they are not entirely the same. If a scholar knows only one and not the other, clinging to first impressions and assuming identical terms imply identical methods, they mislead both others and themselves.

The *Celestial Origin Elixir Method* emphasizes ingestion but not transmutation. The *Terrestrial Origin Elixir Method* enables transmutation and may further refine the elixir for ingestion, thereby ascending to the *Celestial Origin*. *Yellow and White Arts* achieve only transmutation and cannot advance beyond. The *Human Origin Elixir Method* employs yin and yang of the same kind; though terms like *lead, silver, cinnabar,* and *mercury* appear, they bear no relation to the five metals or eight minerals. These distinctions mark the four elixir methods.

The guiding principle of *The Song of the Great Dao’s Spiritual Source* is Daoist cultivation—not elixir refinement, nor Chan meditation or contemplative stillness. Scholars must discern its purport with clarity, allowing no ambiguity.

Most extant elixir scriptures and Daoist texts suffer from vagueness, their principles muddled, often inducing weariness in readers. Having deeply grasped their flaws, I prioritize analysis, seeking to apply scientific rigor to immortal studies, thereby guiding later comrades. For this reason, my writings often diverge from predecessors’ views, a necessity I hope readers will understand.

Furthermore, in *Yangshan Semi-Monthly* (Issue 41, page 6), the closing couplet of *The Jade Flower Palace’s Immortal Scribe’s Descent-Poem* reads:
*“To cherish past affinities and awaken future insight,*
*Early preserve true fluid to ferry decay and decline.”*
Here, *true fluid* precisely aligns with the original meaning of *spiritual water* in *The Song of the Great Dao’s Spiritual Source*. Only by preserving *true fluid* can one ferry decay and decline—just as retaining *spiritual water* sustains life. This principle stands as unshakable as ironclad truth.

Since the Perfected One Cao Wenyi once selflessly revealed the foremost method of cultivation for posterity, you, having encountered her verses even eight centuries later, may as well hear her voice and see her person. Thus, I earnestly urge you to diligently practice, lest you squander your years. Otherwise, upon rebirth, you may not again chance upon such an opportunity.

Only know to embrace tranquility and dispassion, freeing the mind from thoughts and cares,
Observe fasting and still the heart, restraining speech.

The phrase *"only know"* means to follow solely the method described below, disregarding all else.
*Tranquility* is inner stillness; *dispassion* is regarding worldly vanities with indifference.
*Thoughts* are the workings of the mind; *cares* are anxieties.
*Fasting* was an ancient preparatory practice before sacrifices to heaven, earth, or spirits—
such as bathing, changing garments, abstaining from wine, meat, and music.
*Stilling the heart* is to quiet wayward thoughts; *restraining speech* is to guard one’s words.

A single taste of ghee and sweet dew—hunger and thirst dispelled, true simplicity revealed.
The first transformation of milk is *curd*; the second, *raw butter*; the third, *clarified butter*; the fourth, *ghee*.
Ghee may be considered the essence distilled from milk.
There is a variety of plantain called *sweet-dew plantain*, whose flower buds contain a nectar of exquisite sweetness—this is *sweet dew*.
It may be regarded as the essence distilled from the plantain.
*"A single taste"* signifies no other—
for the work above is pure and still, and thus the effects arising within the body are sweet and cooling.

Hunger craves food, thirst craves drink—
both reveal a lack within the body, a need for replenishment to sustain it.
If the body were whole, without lack,
hunger and thirst would vanish of themselves, and one could enter *great samādhi*,
naturally beholding the original face.
All silk untainted by dye is called *plain*;
our true face is pristine, flawless, unstained by a speck of dust—
thus it is called *true simplicity*.

In time, when the work is complete, one will roam free in boundless ease,
yet at the outset, the labor is truly arduous and bitter.
With *martial fire*, it is called *forging*; with *civil fire*, *simmering*.
What is *martial fire*?
Rousing the spirit, sweeping away stray thoughts,
sitting upright, body aligned, breath and mind interwoven.
What is *civil fire*?
Utter relaxation, inner light contained,
subtle as a thread of silk, still as if nothing were there.

Amid the toil, one must yet remain effortlessly at ease—
all to nurture the *primordial spirit*.
Though the work demands perseverance,
it is not a matter of straining mind or force, of restless hands or feet.
Thus Laozi’s *Dao De Jing* offers this secret:
*“Use it without exertion.”*
At first glance, “exertion” and “non-exertion” seem to contradict—
but know that *“non-exertion”* means no forced labor, no clinging,
no pulling shoots to hasten their growth.
*“Exertion”* means no idleness, no slackening,
no fits and starts like sun and frost.
*“At ease”* is the mark of non-exertion.
Only when at ease can one preserve the *primordial qi*;
only by preserving *qi* can one nurture the *primordial spirit*.

Alas, the human heart ever seeks rest yet cannot attain it.
Though circumstance may bind, preventing full release,
half the struggle lies in habits forged over countless kalpas—
hard to shed.
The practitioner is often burdened by this very thought.
At such a juncture, whether to indulge or restrain,
to let go or seize control, rests entirely with the individual.

I once endured suffering upon suffering—
coarse food, tattered robes, solitude, and silence.
As Immortal Cao recounted of her own practice:
in those days, she endured hardships beyond measure.
What she ate and wore were cast-offs from others.
Her surroundings were desolate, her world still.

The heart knows the Great Dao cannot be practiced—reputation, deeds, and the body become grave afflictions.
Though the mind clearly recognizes the Dao as supreme, alas, it cannot be put into action.
The reason it cannot be practiced lies in three burdens: first, empty fame; second, worldly affairs; third, the physical form.
The burden of empty fame is that the capable are often overworked;
the burden of worldly affairs is the entanglement of power and duty;
the burden of the body is the necessity of food, clothing, shelter, and movement.

For example, when at leisure to cultivate, how could any effort compare to sitting in perfect serenity?
Those who cultivate the Dao fear nothing more than lacking leisure.
Even when leisure is attained, they are often encumbered by myriad minor techniques and peripheral practices.
For instance, when body and mind have already reached a state of tranquility,
rather than pursuing various secondary methods, it is far better to relinquish all and focus solely on the practice of *great stillness*.
The character *zheng* (争) is equivalent to *zen* (怎), and *zhengsi* (争似) means "how could it compare to."
(Note: In the second poem of Zhang Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian*, the line reads: *"The great elixir is not sought—how could it be encountered?"*
In the thirteenth poem: *"How could it compare to planting lotuses in fire?"*
In the first *quatrain*: *"How could one attain the golden elixir without understanding life?"*
In the eighth: *"How could it compare to true lead merging with the sacred mechanism?"*
In the fortieth: *"How could the golden crow seize the hare?"*
In the sixty-fourth: *"How could one be taught to see the workings of concealment and revelation?"*
All instances of *zheng* are to be understood as *zen*. The idioms used in Song-dynasty writings differ from those of today. This annotation is provided for the reader’s convenience.)

Though form and spirit are said to be difficult to perfect together, one cannot first complete *ming* without completing *xing*.
The essence of the Great Dao lies in perfecting both spirit and form.
Perfecting spirit is commonly called *xing* cultivation;
perfecting form is commonly called *ming* cultivation.
For those who cultivate the Dao, achieving the unity of form and spirit is the highest attainment.
If this is not possible, one may first cultivate *xing* to perfect the spirit,
and when the opportunity arises, cultivate *ming* to perfect the form—this is also acceptable.
The following passage describes the method for completing *xing* and perfecting the spirit.

Avoid chasing fame and profit, sever all worldly ties—then nothing will disturb you.
By refusing to compete for reputation and gain, and cutting off social obligations,
one may reach a state of unburdened tranquility.

Resolute action lies with the individual—what binds others need not hinder me.
Who could restrain me if I choose to act?
To forsake fame and profit and reject social entanglements may seem difficult,
but where there is a will, obstacles are not insurmountable.
If I am truly determined, who can control me?

Obstruction signifies hindrance; control signifies interference.
What use are soaring fame and swift prose?
"Praising the heavens" describes one’s lofty reputation;
"leaning on a horse" describes the speed of one’s writing—
yet neither serves the Dao.

Glory and fine garments, food and comforts—all are met with indifference.
Piling up jade and amassing gold—what good do they do?
The first line speaks of single-minded devotion to the Way, unmoved by glory or comfort.
The second line asks: if the wealthy refuse to cultivate the Dao,
what use is their wealth when old age, sickness, and death arrive?

Crafty compositions and florid verses—
mastery of them only obstructs the path of cultivation.
To become a man of letters is of little use,
and may even hinder one’s progress.

Like thin mist and drifting smoke,
idly lingering by fallen blossoms and willow floss—
such is the scholar who achieves nothing of substance,
adrift and rootless, floating and insubstantial.

Wandering between heaven and earth,
never becoming nourishing rain or dew.
The first line describes the form of mist and smoke;
the second, their futility—
unlike rain and dew, which benefit the world,
mist and smoke remain ever useless,
never transforming into life-giving moisture.
"Drifting" depicts their rootless wandering;
"floating" their emptiness and unreality.

Fame and life—which is closer?
No one fails to cherish reputation,
and none neglects the body.
Yet when weighed, which is truly dear?
Naturally, the body is nearer.
Alas, how half a lifetime slips by in idle procrastination—
"procrastination" meaning adherence to old ways.

We cling to the dietary and marital habits passed down by humanity’s primal ancestors, never willing to change. We submit to the laws of nature governing birth, aging, illness, and death, never daring to defy them. All this is called *yin xun* (adherence to old ways).

Of late—meaning in recent years, roughly from middle age onward—
one’s body gradually decays, and all efforts at cultivation depend on *shen* and *qi*.
If *shen* and *qi* cannot settle within, all practice is but empty toil.

Pity the fine foundation, the golden hall and jade chamber, left without its master—
the body likened to a house, the *yuan shen* (original spirit) to its owner.
If the owner constantly wanders outside, never returning to the chamber,
the house, though fine, will fall into ruin from neglect, lack of upkeep, and disrepair.

We must persuade the master to dwell long within,
to abide in stillness and emptiness, free from distraction,
so that old habits may slowly fade.

In the state of profound stillness, the original spirit cannot be called "existent."
When stirred to response, it cannot be called "nonexistent"—
it is best described as "subtle existence within nonbeing."
All truths beyond words or thought are called *miao* (subtle).
*Miao you* (subtle existence) is such a truth—
neither leaning toward being nor nonbeing, hence difficult to grasp,
meaning it eludes firm hold, slipping beyond reach.

How, then, to begin practice?
Consider how a child is nurtured wholly by its mother’s care.
If the original spirit is the child, what is its mother?
Laozi’s *Dao De Jing* states:
*"Nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth;
Named, it is the mother of all things."* (Chapter 1)
*"Alone I differ from others,
For I honor the mother as my sustenance."* (Chapter 20)
*"There is a thing, formless yet complete,
Born before heaven and earth,
Silent, vast, standing alone, unchanging,
Circling endlessly, never exhausted—
It may be called the mother of all under heaven.
I know not its name; I style it the Dao."* (Chapter 25)
Thus, we may conclude: the mother is the Dao.
To nurture the original spirit, one must rely on the power of the Dao.

What is the Dao?
The Dao is yin and yang; yin and yang are *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life);
*xing* and *ming* are *shen* and *qi*.
The first step in practice is to guide *qi* with *shen* and nourish *shen* with *qi*.
When *shen* and *qi* unite, one cultivates the Dao.

Seal away sharp eloquence, set aside cleverness,
withdraw the spirit, feign dullness—
for the spirit manifests in hearing and sight as *cong ming* (keen perception),
in speech and writing as *jun bian* (brilliant discourse).
*Jian* means to seal; *cang*, to conceal; *chu*, to discard.
*Shou juan* means to retract.
These lines urge one to gather the spirit within,
not dissipate it outward,
to emulate Laozi’s words:
*"Great eloquence seems inarticulate;
Great skill seems clumsy."* (*Dao De Jing*)
This is the initial method of Daoist practice.

Steel the heart, focus the will,
and walk the great path without doubt—
in the end, you will find the Dao does not betray you.
The danger lies in refusing this path,
preferring crooked byways and heretical gates,
gaining nothing in this life
and inviting retribution in the next—
why suffer so in vain?

**Three Poems by Immortal Maiden Wu Cailuan, with Preface**

Cailuan was the daughter of Wu Meng. Meng served the Kingdom of Wu as Magistrate of Xi’an. A perfected adept, Ding Yi, transmitted the Daoist arts to him, and Meng in turn passed them to Xu Xun of Nanchang. Xu, then Magistrate of Jingyang, heard of the profound Dao of Immortal Mother Shen of Danyang and journeyed with Meng to seek her instruction. The Mother bestowed her esoteric teachings upon Xu, who then requested that she also transmit them to Meng. She refused, commanding instead that Xu relay them to him.

Cailuan studied under Ding Yi’s daughter, Xiuying, and upon attaining the Dao, ascended with her father.

*Her heart like a jade vase of ice,*
*No dust allowed the slightest trace.*
*Though dust may cloud the jade vase whole,*
*She mounts the jade terrace’s highest place.*

*Fame and disgrace—why strive or fight?*
*Floating clouds cannot dim the moon’s bright light.*
*Call her ox or horse—she answers still,*
*But never lets a speck of dust invade her will.*

*Though dwelling in the city, her nature stays in mountains high,*
*In the puppet’s theater, all is but idle play.*
*A mustard seed contains the boundless void,*
*And all the scriptures of the great chiliocosm may be erased away.*

**Six Poems by Immortal Maiden Fan Yunqiao, with Preface**

Fan Yunqiao was the wife of Liu Gang. Both possessed the Daoist arts, able to summon spirits and gods, command transformations, and practice secret cultivation unknown to others. As magistrate, he governed with purity, simplicity, and ease, bringing blessings to the people. The land prospered, and his virtue was revered far and wide.

Often, she and Gang tested their arts against each other. Once, Gang set fire to a guest mill, flames rising from the east. His wife summoned rain from the west to quell them. In their courtyard stood two peach trees: Gang incanted, and one branch fell beyond the fence; she incanted, and the other vanished into a casket. Gang spat into a plate, and it became a fish; she spat, and it was devoured by an otter.

One day, they entered the Siming Mountains, where a tiger blocked their path. Gang subdued it, and the beast crouched, roaring. His wife approached to observe, and the tiger dared not lift its gaze. They captured it and tethered it beside their bed.

On the day of their ascension, beside the county hall stood a great honey locust tree. Gang soared upward from its crown, while his wife sat serenely upon her bed, rising gently like a cloud. Together, they ascended to heaven.

Later, they reappeared upon a boat at Lan Bridge, where they instructed Pei Hang in the Dao, giving him their sister Yunying in marriage. Together, they attained the supreme fruit.

*Qian’s strength is firm, Kun’s virtue soft—*
*Seek first within stillness the work’s true source.*
*Stir clear a ladle of Jade Pool’s water,*
*Why need the seven treasures to polish the moon’s course?*

*Dragon and tiger, wild horse—why cage in vain?*
*Let them soar, and karmic obstructions will obscure the way.*
*In perfect quiescence lies the wondrous Dharma:*
*Capture them, and they become a single day’s breeze.*

*To nurture nature, first calm the heart.*
*Why labor to thread needles in vain art?*
*When the iron ox turns with you in tow,*
*Then shall boundless wisdom’s depth be shown.*

*Why pray for long life? Seek instead*
*The primordial spirit’s utter clarity.*
*Shatter empty space—then all is free.*
*Mani and śarīra are but empty names, you see.*

*Within a golden house dwell two fair maids,*
*Their forms may charm, yet their intent betrays.*
*If from the moon a sun should rise,*
*The night-shining pearl the dragon’s mouth displays.*

*Waves of the River of Love rise high,*
*Dense, they sink; light, they fly.*
*If with oars you strike with bold resolve,*
*How can the weak waters of Penglai be crossed with difficulty?*

**Six Poems by Immortal Maiden Yuehua Cui Shaoxuan, with Preface**

**Preface and Six Poems by Immortal Maiden Yuehua Cui Shaoxuan**

Cui Shaoxuan was the youngest daughter of Cui Gong, Prefect of Fenzhou during the late Tang. Born with refined beauty, she was devoted to the Dao from childhood. At fifteen, she married to the frontier, where she cultivated for ten years of arduous practice and attained the Way at twenty-four. While her husband served as an official in Minqiao, passing through Jianxi and the Wuyi Mountains, he saw amidst the clouds the Purple Empyrean Sovereign and the Lady of Fusang, who asked him, *"Has the Lord of Moonlight arrived?"* Perplexed, he questioned them, and they replied, *"I was once the Left Attendant of the Jade Emperor, recorded as the Lord of Moonlight. By karmic destiny, I was demoted to be your wife."* Later, after resigning from office, she left a letter for her husband in Luoyang, which read:

*"Attainment of the One Origin comes not from heaven’s bestowal.*
*The truth of the Great Elder, the supreme immortals—*
*Light veiled, shadow concealed, form arises from spontaneity.*
*The real abides not in seeking; long does man tarry.*
*Pure and fair is its truth, its nature both firm and yielding.*
*Amidst cinnabar skies and azure heavens, it joins the ranks of the highest sages.*
*A hundred years hence, naught remains but an empty mound."*

With the letter complete, she transformed.

On the third day, her reflection appeared like the moon’s crescent,
Facing the sunlight, radiant and bright.
To achieve the coalescence of yin and yang on a jade night,
First seek the message and grasp the golden waves.

Where innate nature is clear, the foundation of life stands firm;
Nine revolutions of the River Chariot, nine cauldrons complete.
Gold Tiger and Jade Dragon unite in harmony,
The Three Flowers present a minor immortal.

The heart, still as water, drifts serenely,
Ever tranquil, ever wakeful—thus progress in cultivation.
Nurture the crow’s plumpness, foster the hare’s leanness,
And the magic fungus blooms atop the emerald peak.

Know that beneath the earth, heaven also exists;
Devote the heart to self-cultivation, and you seek immortality.
Once the principles of yin and yang are fully realized,
All lies in the primal qi of ceaseless generation.

How fleeting the time of green tresses and rosy cheeks!
In an instant, crane-white hair tangles like silk.
Parting the curtain, she glimpses the plum blossoms bloom—
A moment of spring’s splendor must not be delayed.

She sought no external protection, nor did she study Chan;
The vicissitudes of the world beneath her gaze she let pass.
Know that the cinnabar path ascends straight upward—
The Mysterious Pearl lies only within my breast.

**Four Poems by Perfected Guangzhen of the Tang, with Preface**

Perfected Guangzhen of the Tang, a native of Yanzhou, served her mother with utmost filial piety. After marriage, she suffered from a blood ailment, but dreamed of a Daoist adept who gave her medicine, and she was cured. From then on, she devoted herself to the Dao. She revered Immortal He Xiangu and one day received the profound mysteries directly from her. During the Chunxi era of the Song, three immortals led her to the seashore, where she rode a giant toad across the sea and wandered through famous mountains. The immortals asked her, *"Do you wish to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood? To preserve your form and dwell in the world? Or to abandon your bones and ascend as an immortal?"* She replied, *"My mother still lives; I wish to serve and care for her until the end."* They bestowed upon her a single elixir pill, which she swallowed, and thereafter she no longer consumed grains. Later, she was summoned to the Deshou Palace and enfeoffed as Perfected One of Serene Stillness and Congealed Spirit.

*Face-to-face with the Mysterious Mechanism, one searches in vain—*
*Only by fixing the gaze does one fathom its profound truth.*
*The nature of being defies description in words;*
*When karmic conditions are settled, the true heart is revealed.*

*The heart and nature were ever the simplest to understand,*
*Yet they shift like evening clouds over the mountain peak—*
*East or west, south or north, all places are fit to dwell,*
*Then one may wander Penglai’s peaks or the azure sea.*

*Not knowing one’s nature, not knowing one’s fate,*
*One splits heaven and earth, dividing the path in two.*
*But when the elixir is formed through their union,*
*One becomes drunk within the gourd, needing no support.*

*Without anger, without joy, the qi harmonizes and warms;*
*Responding to affairs as they arise, like wind chasing clouds.*
*The tiger subdued, the dragon tamed, the heart grows still—*
*Beneath the bright moon of the azure sky, white [snow/petals] scatter.*

**Five Poems by Perfected One of Mystic Stillness, Lady Zhou, with Preface**

Perfected One of Mystic Stillness, née Zhou, was the mother of Wang Chuyi of Dongmu in Ninghai. Chuyi was born in the second year of the Huangtong era of the Jin, during the Song dynasty. While pregnant, Lady Zhou dreamed one night of red clouds swirling around her body, and she awoke startled from the vision. From childhood, Chuyi was exceptionally intelligent. One day while wandering in the mountains, he encountered an old man seated upon a great stone, who said to him, *"In the future, you will rise to fame at the imperial court and become the patriarch of the Daoist teachings."* He then stroked Chuyi’s head and departed. Chuyi once composed a verse and sang it to himself: *"Why contend for fame?"*

Why contend for profit?
Better to hear early and cultivate the heart-ground.
One’s own cultivation and realization shape one’s own future;
if one does not act, one becomes like the common herd.”

In the eighth year of the Dading era, she met the Patriarch Chongyang at Quanzhen Hermitage and requested to become his disciple. She served her mother while cultivating the Dao together, each receiving the Great Way. Though their family was poor and their means meager, they endured hardship with steadfast resolve.

Later, when Chuyi answered the summons to court, his memorial included these words: *“A mirror, though bright, can still reflect things—how much more the mirror of Heaven and Earth, which illuminates all without fail? What can escape it? This mirror of Heaven and Earth is none other than the wondrous clarity of one’s own spirit.”* The imperial response praised him highly, and the ancestral master sighed, saying, *“With purity and brightness in one’s person and a will as keen as the spirits—this describes the Master indeed.”*

The following year, when his mother turned ninety, he submitted a petition to attend to her for a day. Lady Zhou said to Chuyi, *“My time of return has come,”* and left behind words on *“neither clinging to life nor fearing death”* before passing. After her burial, he told his disciples, *“The Perfected Ones have made an appointment—I am leaving.”* He then bathed, burned incense, and ascended.

The secret of the feminine Dao must be sought in stillness;
within stillness, the dynamic mechanism remains.
If you merely sit in emptiness, clinging to withered thoughts,
how can the tiger be subdued or the dragon tamed for the elixir’s casting?

A speck of numinous terrace rests firm as bedrock,
heedless of the thousand shifts of glory and decline.
The yang radiance is itself the mani-jewel—
within this, gather and refine the Great Elixir.

The heart is like an autumn stretch of Caoxi’s stream;
best to devote effort to the midnight and noon practice.
Though fish and dragons thrash, the waves return to calm—
only the moon’s reflection lingers in the vast sky.

Light mist and thin haze veil the empty void,
driving the numinous clarity to find no dwelling.
Love and hate, glory and ruin—all are sharp blades;
if you wound the child, how can you seek the child?

First, one must inquire at the Moon Grotto of life and destiny;
seize the dragon and bind the tiger—do not delay.
When the time of yang’s arising leaks true yang,
how can a grain of millet be preserved whole?

*Later Chapters of the Anthology of Feminine Elixir Poems*
Recorded by Jishan Hall of Accumulated Virtue in Qianzhong

The White Lotus Perfected One

Though the terrain of Golden Elixir differs for men and women,
yin and yang share one principle in truth.
Purity of heart and few desires form the root—
to lay the foundation, first sever the Crimson Dragon.

Though the terrain of Golden Elixir differs for men and women,
(what men observe in their terrain differs from what women observe at the outset),
yin and yang share one principle in truth,
(for both must refine themselves into pure yang—essentially, the principle is one and the same).
Purity of heart and few desires form the root—
to lay the foundation, first sever the Crimson Dragon.
(The Crimson Dragon is the monthly flow.
When the flow ceases through refinement, and the breasts retract like a man’s withdrawn turtle,
only then is the foundation of the Elixir complete.)

Born in stillness, seek within stillness—
with single-minded steaming, mend the broken boat.
Blood transforms into qi, the tide of menses ceases,
and the primordial unity returns to ascend Penglai Isle.

Born in stillness, seek within stillness,
(for women are born with an inherently still nature,
and thus succeed in refining the Elixir more swiftly than men within stillness).
With single-minded steaming, mend the broken boat—
blood transforms into qi, the tide of menses ceases,
(Women abound in blood; through method, it is entirely transformed into qi,
and the monthly flow may be halted).
The primordial unity returns to ascend Penglai Isle.
(To restore one’s original nature is to become immortal or Buddha.)

When the aperture of emotion opens like a split melon,
rely wholly on the virtue of earth to grow the Yellow Sprout.
Morning and night, diligently nurture it—
naturally, you will attain the flower of ageless life.

When the aperture of emotion opens like a split melon,
(when the water of Heavenly Dew arrives, like a melon splitting open),
rely wholly on the virtue of earth to grow the Yellow Sprout.
(The sprout grows within the five soils, hence it is called the "Yellow Sprout.")
Morning and night, diligently nurture it—
naturally, you will attain the flower of ageless life.
(By nurturing the Yellow Sprout without harm, it gradually blossoms,
becoming the foundation for transcending kalpas and attaining longevity.)

The Fragrant, Leisurely, Numinous, True Buddha

Within the body lies the White Sparrow Temple—
learn Guanyin’s method of refinement.

and all shall feast together at the Peach Banquet.

Within the body lies the White Sparrow Temple—
(referring to the breasts, transformed from red to white,
hence likened to the White Sparrow Temple.)
Learn Guanyin’s method of refinement—
(once, the holy mother Guanyin refined her practice in White Sparrow Temple
and ultimately attained the great Dao.)
One day, with merit perfected, pay homage to the Queen Mother,
and all shall feast together at the Peach Banquet.
(may all ascend the other shore, a universal compassion.)

Women, busy yet let worldly dust grow faint,
recite Amitābha Buddha in the heart.
Never apart from the Yellow Maiden, sit and lie together—
the mortal husk will naturally shed, exchanging for immortal bones.

Women, busy yet let worldly dust grow faint,
recite Amitābha Buddha in the heart—
(constantly reciting these four characters is the method to tether the mind.)
Never apart from the Yellow Maiden, sit and lie together—
(guard the true intention at all times, and merit may swiftly ripen.)
The mortal husk will naturally shed, exchanging for immortal bones.
(with such wondrous benefits, how can one not cultivate?)

Wujī True Person

Though undead, learn death to never die,
meet birth with slaying—never to be born.
Neither dead nor born, the True Person’s wonder,
one attestation of Nirvāṇa, the great achievement complete.

Though undead, learn death to never die,
(though the person is not yet dead, act as one already dead—
thus in the end attaining deathlessness.)
Meet birth with slaying—never to be born,
(when the mind gives rise to birth, slay it with the sword of wisdom—
thus in the end attaining non-birth.)
Neither dead nor born, the True Person’s wonder,
one attestation of Nirvāṇa, the great achievement complete.
(When form does not die and mind does not arise,
one may attest to the supreme fruit of Nirvāṇa—how great the achievement!)

Above "Right" True One, reverently annotated by Ancient Mother
Compassionate Ancient Mother

Turn the light inward, reflect between the breasts,
cultivate spirit, focus before the golden lock.
After two and a half days, yellow transforms to white,
shift the cauldron, change the furnace—refine and become immortal.

Turn the light inward, reflect between the breasts,
cultivate spirit, focus before the golden lock,
(gaze between the two breasts, direct spirit below the two kidneys—
naturally, the river chariot ascends to the central field to mend the broken body.)
After two and a half days, yellow transforms to white,
(after two and a half days of practice, blood turns to yellow—
at this time, purify the mind and apply effort.
Soon it turns white, the red vessels severed, returning to a maiden’s body.)
Shift the cauldron, change the furnace—refine and become immortal.
(When the red dragon is slain, the place of practice differs—
with the proper method, refinement leads to attainment.)

Every person possesses the bodhi tree;
long seated in bodhi, ascend to the Great Luo.

*(Know where the bodhi tree resides—
cultivate upon it, and in time, bodhi will surely be attained.)*

Qīngyún True Person

The medicine refines within the fire,

When fire and medicine harmonize,
the golden elixir coalesces, entering the paradise of Làngyuàn.

The medicine refines within the fire—
*(The medicine is qi; the spirit is fire.
This is the spirit guiding qi.)*
The fire manifests within the medicine—
*(The spirit grows ever more numinous through qi.)*
With fire but no medicine, the cauldron boils empty—

The Immortal of Colored Clouds and Lapis Lazuli

Best of all is the Six-Character Scripture;
From front to back, it abides in the heart.
Within it lies concealed the River Chariot method—
Unknowingly, unconsciously, the true refinement is achieved.

Best of all is the Six-Character Scripture,
*(Namely, "Namo Amitābha.")*
From front to back, it abides in the heart,
*(The method of reciting the Buddha’s name: "Nan" at the navel, "Wu" at the Yang Pass, "A" at the Yin Kidney, "Mi" at the Mud Pill Palace, "Tuo" at the throat, and finally resting the character "Buddha" in the heart. This both collects the mind and harmonizes qi.)*
Within it lies concealed the River Chariot method,
*(By reciting thus at all times, the postnatal yang qi is charioted into the Central Field, naturally replenishing the prenatal.)*
Unknowingly, unconsciously, the true refinement is achieved.
*(This method is simple—women may recite it, and men may do so as well. The longer it is practiced, the greater its efficacy.)*

Holds two *ruyi* diagrams in her embrace,
Born with them, all people possess them alike.
If one truly attains *ruyi*,
Even the heavens above become attainable.

*(These diagrams protect the heart and also connect it.)*
Born with them, all people possess them alike,
*(Regardless of gender, all have them.)*
If one truly attains *ruyi*,

Even the heavens above become attainable.
*(Not betraying the name of the *ruyi* diagram, one gains its true essence, and ascension may be expected any day.)*

The Great Compassion Pure-and-True Buddha
In movement and stillness, never depart from this,
Depart from this, and the path is lost.
The Yin of Kun transforms into the Yang of Qian,
Standing between heaven and earth, be not weak or timid.

In movement and stillness, never depart from this,
Depart from this, and the path is lost,
*(This refers to true intention. With sincerity at all times, the prenatal naturally returns. If intention strays even slightly, it is no longer the correct path.)*
The Yin of Kun transforms into the Yang of Qian,
*(Women are inherently Yin; only by transforming into Qian Yang can the body become light.)*
Standing between heaven and earth, be not weak or timid.
*(The Yin nature is often soft; one must have the aspiration to stand between heaven and earth, only then can there be hope for the Dao.)*

The Jade Perfected One of Wuji

Entering the gate of emptiness, all affairs cease—
Why still cling to the red dust in the heart’s core?
The ancient model of Gold Sand Buddha remains;
In silent sitting, why not emulate Chan meditation?

Entering the gate of emptiness, all affairs cease—
*(Nuns and Daoist sisters have already entered the gate of emptiness, yet their hearts still linger on the red dust—why?)*
Why still cling to the red dust in the heart’s core?
The ancient model of Gold Sand Buddha remains;
*(Gold Sand Buddha is the Great Being Guanyin. Why not follow this path to perfect enlightenment? This urges those who have left the household life to cultivate with urgency.)*
In silent sitting, why not emulate Chan meditation?

Awakened World Buddha

Most pitiable are those not yet deceased—
Vowing steadfastness like frost and ice, truly bitter and toilsome.
Unwavering integrity is the seed of immortals and Buddhas;
Hasten to cultivate, hasten to refine, and rise above the dusty world.

Most pitiable are those not yet deceased—
*(The living are called "not yet deceased" when their spouses have passed.)*
Vowing steadfastness like frost and ice, truly bitter and toilsome—
*(Widows who keep chastity, resolute as frost and ice, endure untold hardships!)*
Unwavering integrity is the seed of immortals and Buddhas;
Hasten to cultivate, hasten to refine, and rise above the dusty world.
*(Immortal maidens and female Buddhas all take steadfast integrity as their foundation. As a chaste widow, you are already the seed of immortals and Buddhas—what use is remaining in the dusty world? This urges chaste widows to cultivate with urgency.)*

Queen Mother selects and esteems the true maidens,
Form is emptiness—this insight is clear.
The primordial qi, undiminished and whole,
With the proper method, one refinement and merit is achieved.

Queen Mother selects and esteems the true maidens,
Form is emptiness—this insight is clear.
*(Those with profound karmic roots perceive that form is emptiness, emptiness is form, and thus cultivate into true maidens, so the Queen Mother particularly favors them.)*
The primordial qi, undiminished and whole,
*(No need to mend leaks,)*
With the proper method, one refinement and merit is achieved.
*(Attaining the precelestial method, one refinement suffices—this speaks of ease. This urges maiden girls to cultivate with urgency.)*

Merciful and Benevolent Mirror of Goodness Buddha

Do not say household affairs are too tangled to sever,
The Earth’s upright qi, once cultivated, is attained.
From nonbeing into being, nurture the spirit-embryo,
The lower field bears no fruit—only the middle field does.

Do not say household affairs are too tangled to sever,
The Earth’s upright qi, once cultivated, is attained.
*(All women possess the Earth’s upright qi; do not let worldly affairs delay your entire life.)*
From nonbeing into being, nurture the spirit-embryo,
The lower field bears no fruit—only the middle field does.
*(Fruit in the lower field is the mortal embryo; fruit in the middle field is the spirit-embryo. The spirit-embryo coalesces from one’s own spirit and qi, not from external sources—thus called "from nonbeing into being." This urges household women to cultivate with urgency.)*

Eternal Mother of Myriad Kalpas’ Spiritual Wholeness

The Four Great Sacred Mountains abound with female immortals,
Half through filial piety, half through chastity, half through Chan meditation.
All root in the mind-nature as their foundation;
When merit is complete and conduct perfected, they ride the jade lotus.

The Four Great Sacred Mountains abound with female immortals,
Half through filial piety, half through chastity, half through Chan meditation—
*(Some attain through filial devotion, some through chastity, some through Chan practice; though their paths differ, their destination is the same.)*
All root in the mind-nature as their foundation;
When merit is complete and conduct perfected, they ride the jade lotus.
*(The two characters "mind-nature" are the essence of elixir cultivation, indispensable to both men and women. This verse concludes the Female Elixir Canon.)*

Collated by Fu Jinquan of Jinxī

*Preface to the Western Pool Collection*
It is said that Qian’s strength governs heaven, while Kun’s compliance finds its master. The Way of nurturing life embraces the two qi in harmonious union; the harmony of Qian and Kun unites the Three Powers in shaping creation. Virtue, speech, work, and appearance—Kun’s Way is fulfilled in the virtues of gentleness, prudence, warmth, and softness, thus establishing the model for inner chambers.

Yet those born with innate spiritual essence and wisdom may still weave brocade in reverse script, only to incur resentment in waves of slander; or be buried beneath the green mound, their souls returning in vain to the moonlit night. Others, with mist-like temples and cloud-like tresses, remain mired in the bitter sea, weeping fragrant tears and lamenting powdered sorrows, cast into the fiery pit. The five-leaking body is but the karmic obstacle of past lives; failing to awaken the three causes only compounds present-life transgressions. Their fates—long or short, prosperous or destitute—cannot be enumerated; their forms—fair or plain, foolish or wise—are beyond description!

All this stems from the lack of a Kun transmission in the world, making it difficult for people to transcend the kalpas. Thus, a petition was made to the Supreme Venerable, who commanded the host of perfected beings to expound mind-nature through poetic verses, conveying awakening through paradoxical words. Knowing stillness, they feared falling into empty dullness, so they further transmitted true teachings to guide practitioners in beginning their practice.

Every word is jade nectar, none but the work of cultivating life and establishing destiny; every character is a golden needle, all the secrets of binding tigers and leading dragons. If one can refine with sincere heart, the Dark Continent appears before the eyes; if one cultivates according to the method, crimson snow congeals within the cauldron. Rather than entangle oneself in the world’s net, clinging to this fleeting breath of splendor, how much better to sever the passions, seizing the eternal realm of the Dao!

The Western Pool offers a path—here lies the oar for crossing. I humbly append these words to serve as the wooden clapper, respectfully inscribed by Chongyangzi.

*Eighteen Poems on Nature Cultivation*
I.

When the moon is full, it shines bright upon the water,
Heaven and earth, vast and gleaming, all aglow.
A lone goose slants past, its shadow cast in the pool;
After a time, the bright moon mirrors the limpid waves.

Huichunzi says:
The subtle mechanism aligns—precious form gathers in perfect roundness.
The moon illumines the cold pool, its radiance shooting forth in all directions.
Only through clarity comes stillness; only through stillness comes illumination.
Silent illumination, perfectly penetrating—awakened spirit manifests of itself.
The wondrous meaning from the West is most great, most perfect,
Vivid and profound, like the pearl returned to the Eastern Sea.

Hmm!
The four seas surge, waters merging with the sky;
In the depths where water and heaven meet, one naturally finds the source.

Haichanzi says:
Delighted to find fellow practitioners annotating poems on nature,
The time when mind is illuminated and nature seen—when the Dao is accomplished.
Liu the Foolish arrives for the Dragon Flower Assembly,
Drunk, he reaches into the limpid pool to grasp the moon—too late!

Lingyangzi says:
On this night, joyfully encountering the opportune moment,
Clarity and stillness must be sought now.
The moon’s pure light imprints the deep pool—
Truly, the stars of heaven are inverted below.
Not clinging to strange forms or appearances,
How could one mistake empty realms for emptiness?
A single spirit pierces through, revealing the pearl before the self—
Fish eyes should know they are not the same.

Changchunzi says:
Mind and nature are not one thing;
Nature is seen within the mind.
Water and moon, both limpid—
The radiance of waves remains unstained.

---

II.
The spirit terrace is deep and vast as a limpid river,
Its distant source flows long—one should know this.
Let poison dragons contend and stir in play,
How could it compare to the filth churned in ditches and drains!

Huichunzi says:
Pure light is like a mirror, requiring no refinement.
With a single wipe, the poison dragon appears.

Hmm!
Nothing more to say.

The subtle essence from the West—
One sandal returns alone.

III.
Unstained by grinding, unsullied by dye,
Why covet favor or shun disgrace?
In stillness appears a perfect moon—
Only then does one trust this man is no fool.

Huichunzi says:
A single blow to the head—
Those who grasp it depart to comprehend,
Those who comprehend nod in assent,
Merging into silent extinction.

IV.
Neither hate evil nor boast of good,
Hold fast to my nature and let others be.
When the earth-shaking thunder manifests truth,
Freely roam the vastness of sea and sky.

Huichunzi says:
What is the Buddha’s Dharma?
A dried turd on a stick!
A single thunderclap—
Fearless even of death.

V.
Thick clouds and dense mist, both bleak and chill,
Veiling the original face of the bodhisattva.
Were it not for the cleansing sweep of pure wind,
How could the full moon’s radiance appear?

Huichunzi says:
A moment on the meditation mat,
In an instant—
A single somersault,
And the bodhisattva emerges.

VI.
Nature is like a limpid pool,
The mind like level earth.
Weeds arise—cut them away,
Wind passes—waves grow clear.

Huichunzi says:
Nature does not leave the mind,
The mind is empty, without thing.
Cutting away sprouting weeds—
This is the lesser vehicle’s method.

VII.
A single point of luminous clarity, inherently pure and void,
Clouds come and go—the moon remains unchanged.
Responding to affairs is like light’s fleeting dimming,
Yet when the moon’s shadow fades, the bright pearl reappears.

Huichunzi says:
Not knowing how to engage in meditation,
How can one know how to venerate the Buddha?
A single fist shatters it—
The five fingers do not release.

VIII.

The mind is like a wild bird, most difficult to tame—
Scarcely freed from its cage, it seeks to be seized again.
Do not let it drift with the wind, south or north,
For it was born in chaos and falls into deep pits.

Huichunzi says:
Clearly a single moon,
Yet early on, it is mistaken for the sun.
Sun and moon illumine the virtue of heaven,
Mountains and rivers adorn the imperial capital.
Hmph!
Who understands?

IX.
A single point of luminous clarity, a single point of gold,
Drifting with the wind, lost in boundless depths.
Clearly there is a bodhi seed—
Yet when nature scatters and spirit dims, where can it be found?

Huichunzi says:
Dressing and eating,
Unmindful of warmth or fullness.
The mind departs, nature empties—
A lotus appears in the fire.

X.
Sorrow’s sprouts and passion’s seeds—both cast away,
Outwardly spring’s warmth, inwardly iron’s firmness.
Following death and defying life share the same principle,
Yet in movement and stillness, they are not the same.

Huichunzi says:
No harm in stepping into thorns,
Nor in turning within deep pools.
Fear only the clear wind and bright moon,
Sitting face-to-face with green mountains.

XI.
Human life, bustling like duckweed,
On the karmic sea’s waves—when will they cease?
To know one’s original true face,
Diligently knock on the true one beneath the moon.

Huichunzi says:
A single bowl, a single alms-bowl,
Everywhere a home.
Meeting an old Chan hand—
The staff is raised to strike.

XII.
The primordial qi of the undifferentiated was originally without form,
Yet between *geng* and *jia*, one becomes aware of shape.
Do not say being and nonbeing are hard to discern—
One must seek within oneself, not in others.

Huichunzi says:
A single mani pearl,
Unmatched in the sand-realm.
Presented by the dragon girl—
Only now is it recognized.
Hmph!

A single child with two mothers,
Four families as kin—none may be estranged.
Alas, it is lost!

XIII.
Know that the outer turbid holds an inner purity,
Dragon’s head and tiger’s tail arise in due season.
If one blends the mundane and sacred as one,
White snow and yellow sprouts will grow of themselves.

Huichunzi says:
What is the Dao?
Piss and shit must be let go.
Eating meals, donning clothes—
Utterly without distinction.

XIV.
The Great Dao first requires nurturing the numinous spirit,
When the numinous light is fully awakened, return to the root is easy.
Though essence, qi, and spirit may all be full,
How can one refine and temper in darkness?

Huichunzi says:
East, west, south, north, and the central land—
In the dust’s dark obscurity, hair turns white with ease.
Hmph!
Speaker, you’ve got it backwards!
Hard or not hard? A single somersault.
Easy or not easy? Force open both eyes.

XV.
Seal the mouth, still the spirit, and gaze inward,
The Dharma-body ever manifests at a hair’s tip.
In stillness, gather the treasure of numinous clarity,
Place it directly in the central palace—this is the elixir.

Huichunzi says:
Once grasped, seal the mouth.

If you still refuse to take up the task,
How can the bamboo rod bear to strike you away!
Hmph! Hmph! Hmph!
Come again and you’ll not be worth half a penny—
Go rest in the abbot’s quarters behind.

XVI.
The vast sky, clear and turning, remains unstained,
Clouds come and go, ever busy on their own.
The stirring of the xun-wind whirls up and down,
The light of nature and the treasure of life all return to the sack.

Huichunzi says:
A single cloth sack,
Unobstructed in what it holds.
Chaotic and undifferentiated,
It cannot be let out.

XVII.
Do not divide the world’s affairs into light and dark,
In leisure, seek the self that preceded your present form.
Ever wakeful, free from the ways of heat and cold,
Cast off life and death to attain the utmost truth.

Huichunzi says:
Above the nine heavens,
Below the nine springs.
Shaolin’s staff and fist,
Strike above and below.
Once struck open and through,
Roam freely as you will.

XVIII.
Fierce flames leap as the Azure Dragon dances,
Vast clear waves as the White Tiger crouches.
Tiger’s tail and dragon’s head bound by a silken cord,
Seized and returned to the spirit-chamber to merge with the true source.

Huichunzi says:
Long parted from home,
The Way is long and obstructed.
Now that you’ve returned at last,
You find father and mother, wife and children—each safe and well.
Hmph!
The thousand-year-old marble pillar stands unchanged,
While mulberry fields transform into seas at will.

*Postscript to the Western Pool Collection*
The *Yi* says: “Supreme is the power of Kun! All things rely on it for birth.” Is this not what it means to follow and receive from Qian? Yet among the women of the world, few truly understand the Way of Kun and embody its virtue. Some are dull and stubborn in their habits, others indulge in extravagance or violence as if it were their nature—countless delusions, impossible to enumerate. Even among the rare few with resolve who seek to escape life and death, their nature and life remain obscure. Often, one sees village witches and rustic maidens reciting a few Zen phrases, prattling of past causes and future effects, and taking this to be the Great Dao. Blindly cultivating, blindly refining, they deceive themselves and mislead others. Alas! This is all because the true oral instructions for women’s cultivation have been lost. Now, the *Western Pool Collection* emerges, revealing secrets untransmitted for millennia. With great compassion, it opens the gate of expedient means, wishing that women under heaven will reverently believe, cultivate, and delve deeply into its study. Every word bears merit, every line holds a secret—do not lightly pass them by. Where brush and ink cannot convey, it depends entirely on sincerity in pursuing the Dao, that one may encounter a true person’s guidance. The essential first step is to collect the mind and nurture qi. If the mind is not collected, the root of nature is obscured; if qi is not nurtured, the stem of life is lost. Only through dual cultivation of nature and life is the Way of Kun complete. Readers of this collection, take care not to sit idly and miss this opportunity, lest you fail the author’s compassionate vow to deliver the world.

Respectfully inscribed by Lingyangzi.

*Women’s Golden Elixir*
Written by Zhong Zhenyizi
Preface

The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women—both may attain completion. Thus, when a man completes the Dao, he becomes a Perfected One; when a woman completes the Dao, she becomes a Primordial Sovereign. From ancient times, alchemical texts have expounded in exhaustive detail the practices of cultivation for men, while the Way of cultivation for women is seldom addressed. Even when it is mentioned, only a glimpse is revealed, not out of disdain for women’s practice. The underlying assumption is that since human nature and life are the same, the methods must also be identical—speak of men’s cultivation, and women’s practice need not be separately explained. Yet they do not realize that men are yang without and yin within, while women are yin without and yang within. Their inherent natures differ, their physical forms are distinct, and though both share the same nature and life, their practices diverge significantly. As *Disputations on Cultivating the Real* states: “For men, the essential first step is refining qi; for women, it is refining the form.” Ancestor Xu said: “When a man completes his practice, he no longer leaks essence; when a woman completes hers, she no longer leaks menses.” Their initial barriers are entirely distinct. As for later stages—refining the self, obtaining the medicine, returning the elixir, warming and nurturing, coalescing the embryo, and projecting the spirit—though these align with men’s practices, the subtle details and sequences inevitably bear both great similarities and minor differences.

In the spring of the *renchen* year, a woman of the *kun* trigram came to seek the Dao. I instructed her to read many ancient texts to verify what she had been taught. Yet alchemical works addressing women’s cultivation are rare, making it difficult to examine these differences. Thus, undeterred by the transgression of revealing celestial secrets, I have set down in writing how their practices are the same, how they differ, and the step-by-step progression of each stage, offering a guide for those who seek the ford. May those who study these words find clarity in their meaning, lest they mistake fish eyes for pearls. Through deep understanding and diligent practice, may the golden crucible successfully refine the mercury, and the supreme Dao be attained. Then, at the assembly by the Jasper Pool, they shall not find it difficult to join the immortals in paying homage to Lord Mu and the Golden Mother together.

Written in the *zhonghe* month of the *renchen* year of the Guangxu reign of the Great Qing, by Zhong Zhenyizi at the Reclining Cloud Western Pavilion by Jade Belt Stream.

**Volume One: Admonitions and Resolutions**
**Establishing the Will to Enter the Dao**

Heaven is yang, Earth is yin; Qian is firm, Kun is yielding. Without yang, yin cannot grow; without yin, yang cannot be born. Only when firmness and softness attain their harmonious mean can water and fire achieve mutual completion. Yin and yang must have their counterparts, and from this all beings are conceived. Thus, both Qian and Kun are endowed with the primordial qi of true origin, and both men and women possess the indestructible body. Qian is called "great generation," through which one may attain right enlightenment in the Dao; Kun is called "vast generation," and may likewise realize the fruit of the Primordial Sovereign. If one claims that the yin of Kun cannot enter the immortal Dao, how then does the Queen Mother dwell eternally on Kunlun? Chang’e stole the elixir from the rafters and became the eternal Empress of the Moon Palace; the carefree scholar of Qiyuan read the books of Zhuangzi and styled himself the Exiled Immortal of Yaochi. The goddess of the Luo River and the shamans of antiquity have long been renowned; the spirit of Zigu and the consorts of the Xiang River remain celebrated even today. Their traces are recorded in historical texts and may certainly be verified. How then can one who embodies the virtue of Kun be incapable of attaining the Dao? The obstacle lies only in drowning in the sea of desire without awakening the resolve to enter the Way—how can one leap from the ford of delusion to become a cloud-ascending woman? By nature yin and yielding, women often see with narrow vision, unaware of the Four Virtues and ignorant of the Three Obediences. They fail to correct their faults when they should, and neglect to cultivate the field of blessings when they ought. Indulging in passion without restraint, they lose the true essence of their original nature, abandoning themselves to degradation. Little do they realize that the human world is like floating clouds, and the mundane realm is but a sea of karmic retribution. Rather than entering the wheel of rebirth, why not turn back and ascend to the other shore? Penglai’s path is indeed real, and lies before one’s eyes; the ladder to Jade Capital is not absent, but must be realized through the heart’s awakening. The Buddha is the mind, and the mind is the Buddha; immortals may emulate me, and I too may become an immortal. Mercury and lead, gold and cinnabar, are the precious rafts that ferry one across existence; the alchemical classics and Buddhist scriptures are the celestial ladders to the Dao. Yet the celestial mechanism is not lightly disclosed—teachings often conceal their beginnings and ends. Even if one recites the jade-like verses to the end, one must still seek teachers and companions, for each secret revealed leads to another, and each stage of progress opens another beyond. If one can truly sever worldly attachments, bow before a wise teacher to seek the mind’s method, what difficulty remains in stepping into the Jasper Palace, paying homage to the Golden Mother, and joining the ranks of immortals? One must establish resolve—let each exhort themselves.

**Twelve Precepts for Entering the Dao**
1. Guard against the ceaseless arising of deluded thoughts
2. Guard against indulgence in lust and desire
3. Guard against harshness, cruelty, and ruthlessness
4. Guard against vexation and anger
5. Guard against anxiety, fear, and dread
6. Guard against excessive and reckless gazing
7. Guard against excessive and reckless listening
8. Guard against excessive and reckless speech
9. Guard against miserliness and attachment to wealth
10. Guard against killing and harming living beings
11. Guard against immoderate consumption of meat and fish
12. Guard against disrespect for the Dao and one’s teacher

Though women ought to guard against more than twelve things, by observing these twelve precepts, they are not far from immortality.

**1. Guard against the ceaseless arising of deluded thoughts**
The mind’s issuances are called thoughts. When thoughts are upright, all actions are upright; when thoughts are awry, all deeds are awry. The mind is the lord of heaven, and thoughts are its servants—when the lord of heaven is at peace, the hundred limbs obey its commands. Deluded thoughts are all reckless and improper notions. The ancients said: “The thought of no-thought is the true thought—this is the genuine intent.” This genuine intent cannot be dispensed with, for only with it can one refine lead to seek mercury and concentrate the spirit to nurture the embryo. The alchemical classics say: “In walking, standing, sitting, and lying, never depart from this.” *This* is the genuine intent. How can it compare to these improper deluded thoughts, which arise in countless tangled forms beyond description? At first, they arise from nothing; then, they take shape in response to circumstances. One thought has not yet faded before another follows, linking this to that, and stirring the mind upon encountering objects. When thoughts turn to gratification, one cannot help but congratulate and content oneself; when they turn to disappointment, how can one bear the self-reproach and sorrow? Throughout the day, there is no respite, and when night falls, even in sleep, the spirit is not preserved. Since the thoughts that arise are deluded, all actions that follow are likewise deluded—how can such a deluded person speak of the immortal Dao? Even if these thoughts have not yet manifested in action, the divine eye, like lightning, sees all with unerring severity. Moreover, the cycle of birth and death for all beings is created by a single thought—the realm of infatuation is the very ground of rebirth. Alas! A single thought sows the seeds of endless rebirth—how can one not be cautious in what thoughts arise? As for the perfected, knowing that these rootless, baseless deluded thoughts destroy one’s nature and hasten one toward the six paths, they diligently examine and keenly observe: Where do these thoughts arise? Where do they vanish? And before they arise—what then?

Once arisen—what then? The moment this thought arises, raise the sword of wisdom to sever it, striving to pluck out its root so it does not stealthily sprout and grow in the hidden depths. Ensure this nature remains empty, still, and silent, all thoughts extinguished, only the solitary spirit abiding—free and untrammeled, vivid and unbound. Thus, with selfish desires wholly purified and the heavenly principle flowing freely, the immortal Dao is not far off. Therefore, those who enter the gate must first guard this critical juncture with vigilance, for only then are they resolute and steadfast, true vessels of the Dao.

**Second Precept: Against Lust and Sensual Indulgence**
Of all barriers humans find hardest to break, none surpasses the pass of lust. Why are humans born? Because this root of desire remains unsevered, and upon encountering sensual matters, the nature enters the bodily root of male and female, taking rebirth through conception. Why does one have a body? Because it begins with the lustful union of parents. Born from lust, its habitual defilement runs deep, and its root is not easily plucked. Moreover, what sustains human life is entirely dependent on this vital essence. Indulgence in lust injures the essence; when essence is harmed, the Gate of Yang weakens, and a hundred illnesses arise. The ancients said: *"Taking a hundred pills is not as good as sleeping alone for one night."* This is to cherish one’s vital essence. Preserving even a fraction of this essence adds years to one’s lifespan. When the foundation is firm and the Gate of Yang sealed, longevity is attained. Furthermore, women’s natures are easily swayed; once lustful affairs are indulged, the fire of desire burns the body, and passion becomes uncontrollable. Without a husband to fulfill her desires, she may engage in conduct that shames her integrity. Even if she does not lose her virtue, the mere stirring of lustful thoughts ignites a fire that consumes the entire body, and vital essence is no longer preserved within. In the past, when the eleventh disciple Wei studied the Dao, her master transformed into a handsome man who teased and tempted her in every way, even attempting to force himself upon her. Yet her resolve did not waver, and only then was she taught the immortal arts. Thus, those who fail to sever the root of lust often lose their connection to the Dao. Even if they chance upon the teachings, this path is practiced within the realm of form—how can they succeed? Even if they do, the embryo they cultivate is but a lustful one; when the spirit departs, it will inevitably see lustful unions and be reborn, all prior efforts wasted. Many celestial maidens banished to the mortal realm suffer this fate due to unresolved emotional ties—how can one not be vigilant? The method of guarding against this lies in *not thinking* and *not looking*. Not thinking prevents passion from arising in the first place; not looking severs the念 at the moment of encounter. Wenchang dijun said: *"Do not think of what you have not seen; do not be disordered by what you see; do not dwell on what you have seen."* This is truly a fine admonition against lust. Yet how can one stop at merely not thinking, not being disordered, or not dwelling? One must utterly eradicate the root of passion, seeing form as emptiness and emptiness as form, forgetting emotion in the face of circumstances, and being desireless amid desire. Only then can one speak of the immortal Dao. Those who cling to lustful desires while seeking the path of the perfected—if any have succeeded, I have never heard of it.

**Appendix: The Story of Wei the Eleventh Disciple**
Wei the Eleventh Disciple was a poor girl from Chang’an during the Song dynasty. She married a man from the same village, Deng, who loved gallantry and adventure. Despite her repeated admonitions, he turned against her. During the Zhenghe era, he joined the military at the frontier and was gone for a long time without any word. Her husband’s elder brother was of ill character and often teased her with lewd words, but Wei sternly rejected him. Remembering the Daoist nun Zhao, whom she had loved since childhood and who possessed arts that could be transmitted, she sought her out. The nun gladly took her into the convent and taught her the methods. One evening, the nun descended the mountain, leaving Wei alone in the convent, and warned her: *"Do not drink wine or indulge in lust."* Wei thought deeply: *How could such things exist in this mountain?* After the first watch of the night, a man climbed over the wall and entered. Wei quickly rose and questioned him, but he did not answer. He approached and embraced her; she refused. His advances grew more insistent, and Wei drew her sword to strike him. He countered with a sword of his own, sharp and swift. Realizing she was no match, Wei cast aside her sword and pleaded: *"My fate is thin, and I have long renounced worldly desires. How could I bear to corrupt myself? Moreover, my master has given strict warnings—I dare not transgress."* He pressed his sword to her neck, demanding compliance. Wei bared her neck to receive the blow. The man withdrew his sword, smiled, and said: *"I know your heart has not changed."* Looking closely, she saw it was the Daoist nun. From then on, the nun taught her all her arts.

**Third Precept: Against Cruelty, Violence, and Harshness**
Firmness is a virtue. Without it, one becomes weak and listless, achieving nothing. This quality of firmness is indispensable. Yet firmness without propriety degenerates into violence—self-willed, refusing to yield, heedless of right and wrong, unmoved by others’ words, disrespectful to parents-in-law, discordant with sisters-in-law, lacking reverence for her husband, tyrannical toward children and nephews, and harsh toward servants. Such is the way of the shrew. Thus, firmness followed by violence often leads to cruelty, mercilessness, and stinginess. A person must possess a heart of benevolence and compassion to cultivate a magnanimous capacity. The Holy Mother, Yuanjun, regards the world as one family and the Middle Kingdom as one person. All beings between heaven and earth—every kind of creature—she cherishes as tenderly as her own child. How could she ever harbor even a trace of malice or descend into cruelty? Guanyin Bodhisattva is called the *"Vessel of Compassion"* because her nature is formed of benevolence, universally aiding all beings, serving as the compassionate mother through eons. Thus, her divine spirit endures through the ages. If one is violent and harsh, they lose the yielding and gentle virtue of Kun’s Yin; if cruel and harsh, they lack Kun’s capacity for broad nurturance. What use does Heaven have for such a person? What benefit do they bring to the earth below? It would be better for them to die swiftly—how can they hope for longevity?

Only those whose nature is violent must be nurtured with gentleness and slowness, as mild as the spring breeze that delights all, never clashing with anything. Those who are cruel and harsh must be transformed with kindness and generosity, like the timely rain that nourishes all things, so that none fail to receive its grace. Outwardly manifesting thus, the inner nature becomes luminously free, vibrant and fluid, containing boundless vitality within. How then could Guanyin, the Compassionate Ferry, sit idly by without awaiting your arrival?

**Four: Guard Against the Afflictions of Resentment and Anger**
Resentment arises when one is vexed by labor and harbors ill will. In this fleeting life, who is without tasks? One must proceed slowly, neither calculating merit nor shunning toil, nor fearing weariness—only then can affairs be accomplished. If vexation breeds resentment, what in this world can ever be achieved? In cultivating one’s nature, patience is even more essential. For the heart, long scattered, once reined in like a living dragon or tiger, refuses to submit at once. When it resists submission, one must nurture it with ease, neither restraining nor neglecting, neither forgetting nor forcing, allowing it to follow its natural course. Cultivate one degree today and gain one degree; cultivate another tomorrow and gain another. When cultivation reaches its fullness, clarity will naturally arise. If one grows resentful at the difficulty of perfection, how can the nature ever attain luminous wholeness?

Anger arises when things fail to conform to one’s wishes, breeding hatred and rage. Yet how can all things in the world always align with one’s desires? Anger does not make them so—why not reflect more deeply? One must simply accept what comes. Moreover, those consumed by anger harbor a poisonous heart; many die and are reborn in the bellies of venomous snakes. In summer, Xi La transformed into a serpent through anger, and Empress Chi became a python—these are clear proofs. Anger may arise from resentment, and resentment from anger; both are burdens on the heart. One must swiftly guard against them.

**Five: Guard Against Anxiety, Overthinking, Fright, and Fear**
Overthinking injures the spleen, causing qi to stagnate and fail to rise. Fright injures the kidneys, scattering the spirit so it cannot be stored. Before matters arise, one frets endlessly; as they approach, one trembles without cease. These are the roots of obscured nature and the tools of depleted essence and scattered spirit. If unchecked, they often lead to internal injuries. The way to guard against them is to remain steadfast and empty, the heart unburdened by things. When anxiety comes, reflect on reason; if reason cannot dispel it, let it follow its course—what benefit is there in worrying?

The reason people harbor such fears is the dread of calamity befalling them. Yet if one lives uprightly, with nothing to shame heaven above or humanity below, having done no wrong to others, others will not harm them—what is there to fear? Even if misfortune strikes suddenly, life and death are fated; one must accept it with equanimity. The sage remains unshaken before a collapsing mountain, unafraid even with a blade at the neck—such is the power of a settled spirit. Long ago, when Wanqiu tested the Green Bird Master with the six senses—sight, sound, scent, taste, touch—and the seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, anxiety, grief, fear, and shock—two traces remained unresolved, and he barely attained the rank of earthly immortal. If scholars do not exert effort here, they remain mere mortals—how can they hope for accomplishment?

**Six: Guard Against Excessive Wandering Gaze**
The eyes are the chief of the six thieves. When they see form, the heart is ensnared, and the hun-soul leaks through the eyes, injuring the liver. The hun-soul rests in the liver at night and dwells in the eyes by day; a wandering gaze causes the hun-soul to leak, leading to excessive dreaming. The sage has no dreams, for they can withdraw their gaze inward, preventing the hun-soul from straying outward and the heart from being led astray by form. Thus, to gather the heart, one must first restrain the eyes. The method is to constantly return the gaze to the Mysterious Pass, keeping this luminous nature undimmed, nurturing the unshakable spirit. Naturally, the eyes will not wander, the heart will not stray, the hun-soul will not roam, and the spirit will not flee, allowing the primordial qi to return to the body.

**Seven: Guard Against Excessive Wandering Hearing**
The kidneys open at the ears; reckless listening stirs the heart, and essence leaks through the ears, injuring the kidneys. The kidneys are the true water of the primordial One, irrigating the body’s defensive and nourishing qi. Injury to the kidneys leads to emaciated skin, essence depletion, and deafness. If one can often concentrate the ears to listen inwardly, not only will the heart remain undisturbed by sound, but the heart will be nourished and essence will congeal in the kidneys—ascension to immortality is not far off.

**Eight: Guard Against Loquaciousness and Recklessness**
Words easily invite blame. Nan Rong was praised by the sage for reciting the *White Jade* thrice, for he knew the value of cautious speech. Loquaciousness fails to nurture the heart’s benevolence. When Sima Niu asked about benevolence, the sage advised him to be sparing in speech—restraining the external to cultivate the internal. Moreover, words are the voice of the heart; the heart stores the spirit. Excessive speech injures the spirit. If one can guard the mouth like a sealed vessel, the spirit will naturally abide in the heart. The nature will not be disturbed by words, and in social exchanges, one will not speak amiss.

**Nine: Guard Against Stinginess and Hoarding Wealth**
Wealth exists to serve the world; no one is without need of it. The key is not to be enslaved by it. If one is utterly stingy, refusing to part with even a penny, then even if gold is piled like mountains, can it buy back the five constants? Rather than hoarding wealth to enrich oneself and become a miser, is it not better to disperse it to accumulate merit and forge bonds with immortals on the Dao? All immortals and perfected beings have attained their state by broadly sowing fields of blessing. As the ancients said: *"If one is stingy with wealth and hoards treasures, ten thousand immortals will refuse to come."* The perfected regard wealth and honor as floating clouds, gold and jade as dung and dirt, unstained by even a speck of dust, unattached to even a single thing. Since this body is not truly one’s own, how much less so the wealth beyond it?

Thus, those who enter the Dao must break through this barrier all the more, lest they be deluded by it.

**Tenth Precept: Refrain from Killing Living Beings and Harming Life**
Heaven and Earth cherish life as their essence; the sages embrace all things with compassion. Heaven and Earth give life, yet I recklessly take it—this greatly disrupts the harmony of Heaven and Earth. The sages love all beings, yet I willfully harm them—this utterly betrays the benevolence of the sages. Moreover, all creatures share this same nature and life: they love life and fear death, just as we do. If I dread injury to my own life, how can I not fear the death of other living things? Extending my heart to others, there must be those who cannot bear to kill or harm. As the ancients said: *"If you wish to prolong life, you must release life."* Since I seek the Dao to attain longevity, I ought to extend my own heart to cherish the lives of all beings. Though it is said that the lives of creatures lie in human hands and that killing brings cruel retribution, saving an ant may lead to imperial honors, and freeing a sparrow may yield a luminous pearl. From ancient times to the present, many have gained blessings through releasing life. How can one fail to cultivate compassion toward all beings to nurture the virtue of cherishing life?

**Eleventh Precept: Refrain from Excess in Meat and Fish**
Though meat and fish nourish the human body, those who observe fasting and abstain from such flavors have never been harmed—thus, sustaining life does not depend entirely on flesh. In high antiquity, people wore clothing of grass and ate the fruits of trees, and their people often lived long. Yet since the rise of cooked flesh and blood, people have tended to die young—why is this? For rich and fatty foods stir the fires of desire; consuming them excessively often leads to indulgence and depletion of essence. Grain, however, embodies the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, offering the purest and most wholesome flavor, making it the finest sustenance for nurturing life. Moreover, to eat the flesh of one’s kind to nourish one’s own flesh is something the heart cannot bear. The Buddhists abstain from meat and fish, for they do not indulge the palate at the cost of increasing the karma of killing. The Lady of South Marchmount warned Yang Xi: *"Those who cultivate the Dao should not wish to see blood and flesh; if they see it, they should avoid it—better still not to see it at all. Once dead, a creature becomes corpse qi, and contact with it most harms the Dao."* Thus, those who enter the Dao must value restraint in meat and fish.

**Twelfth Precept: Refrain from Disrespecting the Dao and Belittling One’s Teacher**

The most precious and revered in Heaven and Earth is none other than the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. It can lift one from the mortal realm, resolve the cycle of life and death, and transcend nine generations of ancestors. For the ancients, it was an encounter once in ten thousand kalpas—how could this be a trivial matter? Even one as noble as Emperor Wen of Han humbled himself before He Shanggong; even one as wealthy as Ma Danyang emptied his heart before Wang Chongyang; even one as martial as Han Zhongli lowered his head before Wang Xuanfu; even one as learned as Baopuzi knelt before Deng Siyuan—how much more so for those beneath them? Thus, those who seek the Dao must not cling to their own wealth and status, flaunt their own power, or rely on their own learning and intelligence. They must approach with an empty heart and sincere seeking. Like Wu Chongxu, who swept floors and performed menial tasks, asking earnestly for twenty years before attaining it, the one who imparts it does not do so lightly.

Baopuzi said: *"Those who receive the true and singular secret must swear an oath, partaking in the blood of a white sacrificial animal. They receive it on an auspicious day, sealing the pact with white silver and white silk, splitting a golden contract. To speak of it lightly or transmit it recklessly is to forfeit the protection of the gods."*

Chongxuzi said: *"Since ancient times, the immortals and perfected ones have transmitted the true Dao only after purifying themselves through fasting and ritual offerings, presenting formal gifts of sincerity, swearing blood oaths to Heaven, and submitting memorials to the Supreme Emperor. They petition the Three Northern Dipper Stars, the Southern Asterism, the Three Officials, the Four Sages, the Five Emperors, and the Lords of Destiny, seeking their approval before transmission. Whenever one person is taught, all the gods and sages between Heaven and Earth are notified. If there are wicked sorts who act for profit or deceit, engaging in private transmission, both master and disciple will face divine punishment—how can one not be cautious? Since the celestial envoys do not bestow it lightly, how can the recipient treat it with irreverence?"*

Baopuzi said: *"The grace of a true teacher surpasses that of Heaven and Earth, outweighs that of one’s parents—how can one not revere and honor them?"* From this, it is clear that those who seek the Dao, upon encountering a true teacher, must show reverence and respect, inquire diligently and earnestly, and persevere without slackening. Only then can they ultimately hear the heart-method and find the path to ascension.

**Oral Instructions from the Lower Scroll of the Female Golden Elixir**

**Gathering the Mind**
The principles of the Golden Elixir are most profound and subtle;
Each step of the practice must be pursued with intent.
If you ask where to begin,
Sweep away deluded thoughts to gather the mind.

The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is most sacred, most divine, most mysterious, most wondrous. It encompasses both inner and outer, beginning and end. One must understand its subtle details and practice with clarity. If one does not apply oneself with intent, knowing the inner but not the outer, one will ultimately fall into emptiness; knowing the beginning but not the end, one will achieve only minor fruition. The first step in cultivation is to gather the scattered mind.

Mencius said: *"The way of learning and inquiry is nothing other than seeking the lost mind."* If this mind is daily scattered outward, like a wild horse or a mountain ape, never at rest, and if it daily clings to emotions and selfish desires, the true nature will be increasingly obscured by material cravings. Once the root of equilibrium is disrupted, the nocturnal qi will not endure—how then can one hope to conceive the Embryo Immortal?

Thus, at the outset, one must lay down all entanglements, free from the slightest attachment or defilement, releasing the mind into the realm of nothingness. In utter clarity and stillness, emptiness and silence, with long and steady practice, the mind will naturally die, and with the mind’s death, the spirit will live. Even if one does not ascend as an immortal, immortality is not far off.

**Nurturing Nature**
A pearl of *maṇi* like crystal,
Who would expect dust and grime to obscure its brilliance?
But with quiet sitting and turning the light inward,
The moon of the celestial heart shines bright once more.

The true nature is inherently luminous and clear, yet constrained and obscured by the endowment of qi and the desires of the material world, it may at times grow dim. However, its fundamental brightness never ceases. If one diligently polishes and nurtures it, it will once again shine like the moon of the celestial heart, illuminating all lands.

The method of nurturing: each day, sit in stillness, first laying down all entanglements. Turn the light inward and reflect, like the moon reaching the heart of the sky or the wind rippling the water’s surface—serene and buoyant, lively yet formless, neither forgetting nor forcing. When matters arise or things approach, remain unmoving yet fully aware. To lack awareness would be to fall into the dullness of wood or stone!

In reflection, one must be at ease and comfortable; if not at ease, the method is not yet mastered, and one should not continue reflecting, lest it lead to qi stagnation. As the ancients said: *"At first, one must both release and gather; later, with mastery, there is neither release nor gathering."* When gathering and releasing are balanced, with long and steady nurturing, one may suddenly perceive a flash like lightning—this is the first sign of the true nature’s appearance. From there, with continued practice, there will come a time of perfect clarity. However, the work of reflection must not be prolonged.

The ancients said: *"Before obtaining the Great Medicine, one must not reflect for too long, lest the yin spirit emerge and enter demonic paths."* Thus, within the twelve hours of the day, one reflects for one hour, while the rest of the time remains carefree and at ease. The practice must never be interrupted. With mastery, the natural light of wisdom will spontaneously manifest, illuminating the nine provinces and touching the future with insight. Yet one must know and then forget what is known, forgetting until there is nothing left to forget, naturally attaining the state of transformation.

**Nurturing Qi**
Though one may hold the thought of the first dhyāna,
Only when the breath reaches harmony is Heaven revealed.
There is no other art to nurturing qi—
Walk together, sit together, sleep side by side.

The Buddha said: *"In the first dhyāna, thought is stilled, and the mind is free from arising and ceasing. In the second dhyāna, the breath is stilled, and there is no inhalation or exhalation."* When the breath is stilled, qi is properly nurtured.

This breath is not the breath of mouth and nose. At the beginning of life, one relies on the mother’s breath to form the embryo. Upon breaking the womb, this breath is stored in the ancestral aperture, though it remains connected to the breath of mouth and nose.

The breath of ordinary people enters and exits through the mouth and nose, unable to enter the ancestral aperture and return to the root. The true person, however, breathes such that each breath returns to the root. Thus Zhuangzi said: *"The breath of the multitude reaches only the throat, while the breath of the true person reaches the heels."* To seek the breath of the true person, one must regulate the postnatal breath to find the true breath, returning it to the root in the ancestral aperture. There, qi is stored, and when the breath is harmonized, qi is balanced; when the breath is stilled, qi does not scatter. This is what the ancient immortals meant by *"qi returning to the primordial sea, life knows no end."*

Yet the breath must be regulated to the point of harmony before one may gather the medicine or nurture the embryo. Hence it is said: *"Only when harmony is attained does Heaven appear."* Liu Changsheng said: *"Harmony unites Kan and Li."* He also said: *"Harmony nurtures spirit and qi."* What is harmony? Master Wu said: *"Neither partial nor biased, neither hasty nor slow, neither existent nor nonexistent."* How does one cultivate harmony? Master Wu further said: *"Husband and wife walk side by side, yin and yang unite as one. By day, they move together without one leading or lagging; by night, they dwell together without clinging or parting."* Such realization is the samādhi of harmony.

In short, Master Wu’s words are but a metaphor for the interdependence of mind and breath, never parting day or night. Zhongli Quan said: *"When mind and breath depend on each other for long, the body is transformed and jade nectar flows."* Thus, when mind and breath are harmonized through interdependence, the work of nurturing qi is complete.

**Concentrating Spirit**
Spirit is the husband, breath the wife—
Let not cloud and mud keep them apart.
When the two unite and return to the root,
Together they ascend the moonlit ladder.

Spirit is fire; breath is wind. In refining the elixir, wind fans the fire, and fire refines essence. Wind and fire work as one, spirit and breath depend on each other, never parting—like husband and wife. Thus, one must concentrate spirit within the qi cavity, spirit embracing qi, intention binding breath, neither clinging nor separating, neither forgetting nor forcing. Only then is there true union, true communion.

Zhu Yuanyu said: *"To seek the primordial true seed, one must establish the root in chaos."* Chaos is the place of returning to the root and reviving life. Ancestor Hai Chan said: *"The sages of old revealed the secrets of the elixir platform; many times the spirit bird nested in the osmanthus branch."* Ancestor Jingyang said: *"I reveal my family’s tradition to you: the sun moves into the bright moon."* All these are metaphors for concentrating spirit within the qi cavity.

Ancestor Sanfeng said: *"In seated meditation, one must embrace qi with spirit and bind breath with intention, circulating gently within the cinnabar field, gathering without scattering. There, the inner qi and the incoming qi merge in the cinnabar field, growing day by day, filling the four limbs and flowing through the hundred channels. Breaking through the double pass of the spine, they ascend to the mud pill, enter the vermilion palace, descend the multi-storied tower. Spirit and qi guard each other, breath and breath depend on each other—then the river chariot’s path is open."* At this stage, half the effect of laying the foundation is achieved. From this, we know that the work of concentrating spirit is indispensable for both the firm and the gentle.

**Three Destinies of Women**
Women’s destinies originally number three—
Purple, white, and yellow light, unlike men’s.
In youth, above; in decline, middle; in completion, below—
One must deeply understand this path at the pass.

Women have three destinies: purple, white, and yellow. The yellow light is where the elixir is born in the cinnabar field. The white is where the embryo is nurtured in the womb. The purple is the sea of blood where blood is generated. The upper is the yang cavity, the middle is the yellow chamber, and the lower is the cinnabar field.

In youth, when the celestial water fills the measure of one catty, the true qi of the cinnabar field is abundant, ascending to generate blood in the blood origin. Yang at its extreme transforms into yin, and the turbid essence flows outward as menses—thus in youth, it comes from above. In decline, when the celestial water is exhausted, qi cannot ascend to generate blood, and with the waist and spine drained of blood, the menses cease—thus in decline, it comes from the middle.

To cultivate the qian body, one must move from the lower field to the upper yang cavity, steaming with the fire of spirit until the menses turn yellow, the yellow turns white, and the white dissolves into nothingness—then the form naturally conceals itself. Thus it is said: in completion, it comes from below. Unlike men, if one does not recognize this pass, the elixir will not form.

**Qi Cavity**
The qi cavity is none other than the breasts—
Do not mistakenly measure below the navel.
If one does not know where yin arises,
How can the poison dragon be made to hide?

The qi cavity is the blood origin, the breasts—one inch and three fen within, not the two breasts. In men, the destiny lies in the cinnabar field, so the lower field is the qi cavity. In women, it lies in the breasts, so the breasts are the qi cavity. Yang at its extreme transforms into yin, flowing outward from the qi cavity as yin blood. Thus, to sever the red dragon, one must work at the place where yin arises. With long practice, the form will naturally conceal itself. To point to the qi cavity one inch and three fen below a man’s navel is a mistake. Know the timing—

When flowers bloom beneath the moon’s gaze,
The ram butts against the fence in vain.
I urge you—when the time is ripe, delay no more,
Lest the red dragon emerge from the water’s edge.

*The Subtleties of the Primordial* states: "Before a girl is born, at the moment her parents unite in essence, the father’s essence arrives first, the mother’s blood follows after, and blood enfolds essence to form the female body. At the hour of her conception, she first receives one *liang* of the mother’s lead-qi, which generates the right kidney, then draws a thread upward to form the two eyes, and another downward to produce the golden elixir. From then on, for every twelve days, one *zhu* of *gui*-water is generated; for every one hundred eighty days, one *liang* of *gui*-water is generated. Thereafter, for every fifteen days, one *zhu* of *gui*-water is generated; for every year, one *liang* of *gui*-water is generated. By fourteen years of age, fourteen *liang* of *gui*-water have been produced in the sea of blood, which, together with the one *liang* carried from the womb, completes the full measure of one *jin*—three hundred eighty-four *zhu*—corresponding to the three hundred eighty-four degrees of the celestial sphere, the three hundred eighty-four days of the year, and the three hundred eighty-four lines of the *Book of Changes*, the numbers of Heaven and Earth. When yin reaches its extreme, yang arises; when *gui* is exhausted, lead appears. At twice seven, the celestial *gui* descends. At fourteen, the celestial *gui* descends, and thereafter, every twenty-six months and seven and a half days, one *liang* of *gui*-water is consumed, until at forty-nine it is entirely spent. From the age of twice seven, a woman’s menses flow once each month, circulating without cease, in perfect accord with the moon’s waxing and waning, never deviating from its rhythm. Should it stray even slightly, illness will arise. Thus, month after month the flowers bloom, and the menses flow in their season. The reason for this flow is that yang transforms into yin. Once yang has become yin, it cannot be circulated. If one recklessly attempts to circulate it, lives will be lost. One must begin practice before the ram butts against the fence, when the time is ripe and the work can commence."

*The Spiritual Mirror of Superior Medicines and Three Lives* states: "The monthly signal is not the arrival of the menses. The word *signal* is like a messenger arriving before the traveler returns home. On the day the signal arrives, she will know it—perhaps by pain in the waist or legs, discomfort in the head or eyes, or loss of appetite. This is the signal’s arrival, the formation of blood, which is qi. One must devote oneself to practice two and a half days before this time. Once the menses begin, the red dragon’s yin-essence cannot be grasped. Reckless circulation will cost lives. One must wait two and a half days after the menses have ceased, then test with white silk. When its color turns golden, the menses have ended. Proceed with the previous work to sever it."

**Severing the Dragon**
As yang transforms to yin and flows from the jade ravine,
The fire-wheel must be swiftly driven—do not delay.
Let the *xun*-wind blow upward to the crimson origin-palace,
And sever the red channel so it never flows again.

When yang is about to transform into yin—when the signal has arrived but the menses have not yet begun—hastily stir the *xun*-wind, drive the fire-wheel, and circulate from the cinnabar field upward to the crimson origin-palace to sever it.

*The Method of Refining Form in Great Yin* states: "At the outset, close the eyes and gather the spirit, resting fully to calm the heart and regulate the breath. Then concentrate the spirit and enter the qi cavity. Cross the hands to cradle the breasts, gently kneading them three hundred sixty times. Draw the qi upward from the lower cinnabar field with twenty-four subtle breaths. Then, still cradling the breasts, return to contemplation and regulate the breath. With long practice, the true breath will naturally come and go, opening and closing, nurturing the *yin* and *e* until spirit and qi are abundant, true yang flourishes, the menstrual water ceases, and the breasts shrink like a man’s. This is called severing the red dragon." After long practice, there is no need to cradle the breasts or draw the qi—simply concentrate the spirit in the qi cavity and turn the light inward. This is called establishing the gate of the *pin*.

When the true breath flows gently, emptiness reaches its depth and stillness its utmost. Yang-qi steams upward, the river chariot turns backward, ten thousand clusters of purple clouds gather at the jade palace, and a thousand channels and a hundred vessels plant seeds in the mud-pill. Such are the effects of severing the red dragon. Thus, for women, cultivation hinges on severing the red dragon.

**Concealing Form**
No demon is deadlier than this enchantress—
When the seventy-sevens are complete, life is spent.
But once the form is refined in Great Yin and concealed,
The purple palace is prepared to celebrate long life.

Master Xu said: "When a man cultivates to the point of no seminal leakage, when a woman cultivates to the point of no menstrual flow—this is the way. For a woman, the menses are the beginning of life. When the signal returns and the menses transform into qi, the breasts shrink like a man’s, and the flow ceases of itself. For a man, refining essence into qi causes the yin-root to shrink like a boy’s, and leakage ceases of itself. Only then can life be prolonged. If this demon is not severed, by seventy-sevens—forty-nine years—blood will be exhausted and the menses will end, leaving no vitality. When vitality is gone, life is spent."

*The Spiritual Mirror of Superior Medicines and Three Lives* states: "For women, blood is the kidney, an empty cavity. After forty-nine years, the waist dries, blood desiccates, and vitality is lost. Yet with long nurturance, the blood-origin is born anew, as in a maiden. This is the marvel of creating something from nothing."

When one perceives and possesses this, severing it transforms it at once, and life is born." How then to nurture it so that the blood-origin is reborn? It is nothing more than gathering the heart to cultivate nature, nurturing qi to congeal spirit. The Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign said:

"Originally it begins with non-doing,
Who could foresee its fall into the postnatal?
The moment a word leaves the mouth,
Three inches already seize control.
Moreover, troubled by worldly toil,
How can one endure the coils of illness?
When the child is plump, it nourishes the mother—
Do not say there is no turning back."

There are other supplementary practices, but I dare not lightly disclose them. This is what Sun Bu’er meant by: *"Bind the tiger and return it to the true cave; lead the dragon to sever the elixir of benefit."*

When a woman’s cultivation reaches the point where her menses no longer leak, her subsequent work in nature and life differs only slightly from that of men. The trouble lies in no one revealing the secret to unlock its mysteries!

**Seeking the Elixir**
Refining form into qi, laying the foundation—
The work of highest celestial immortals differs.
If you ask where the Golden Elixir truly lies,
It is the sun coming to illuminate the moon across the primordial vastness.
Only when the sun comes to illuminate the moon
can it radiate light for ten thousand ages.
Understand this principle, and the Dao of the elixir is not far.

**Refining the Self**
The living dragon and tiger battle the lotus chamber,
Most fear the wild monkey of the heart and galloping horse of the mind.
If refining the self is not yet mastered,
How can one sail across the sea and hoist the sail?

The Lüzu’s *Lyrics of Ascending the Toad Palace* says: *"To refine metal and wood, one must generate dragon and tiger."* Know that dragon and tiger are not external things—they are only "living" when they arise from within. When practicing the Dao, drive the living tiger to meet the living dragon, but beware the wild monkey of the heart running rampant and the galloping horse of the mind flaunting its power. Without taming them, how can one cross the sea and retrieve the scriptures? Thus, one must refine the self to perfection, so that spirit is whole, qi abundant, the seven emotions unmoved, the five thieves unchaotic, the six roots firmly stabilized, and both form and appearance forgotten. Only then can one enter the lotus chamber to seek the elixir.

*The True Principle of Celestial Immortals* states: *"Refining the self means: enduring hardship in what ought to be done is refining; mastering what ought to be done is refining; abstaining from what ought not to be done is refining; advancing with unyielding resolve to ensure success is refining; severing desire without lingering attachment is refining; prohibiting old habits without contamination is refining. The self refers to the true nature in stillness and the true intent in movement—another name for the primordial spirit."* As the ancients said: *"Before refining the returning elixir, first refine the nature; before cultivating the great medicine, first cultivate the heart."* This is the Dao of refining the self.

**Sequence and Reversal**
Following the sequence gives birth to humans; reversing it makes one immortal.
When Kun and Qian form *Tai*, this is the true principle.
Do not be alarmed if the elixir is hard to congeal at the furnace—
When you pull the goat cart, you will naturally see heaven.

The Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign said: *"Watch closely for the moment of intermingling; pay heed to the path of sequence and reversal."* The *Rootless Tree* says: *"Sequence makes one mortal; reversal makes one immortal—it all lies in the inversion between."* The Dao of the elixir employs reversal, thus the hexagram *Tai* has Kun above and Qian below, enabling heaven and earth to unite and the myriad things to communicate. Without pulling the goat cart in reverse, the host of yin will obstruct—how then can one dispel turbid yin to perceive the heart of heaven? Therefore, in immortal cultivation, whether man or woman, one need only understand sequence and reversal.

**The Elixir’s Birth**
In vagueness and obscurity, emotions seem dull,
Yet in harmony, the medicine is born.
When the cinnabar field gives its signal, the opportunity arrives—
Hasten to adjust the fire-work and harvest the jade mushroom.

This elixir is endowed by parents and stored in the qi cavity. In youth and prime, it possesses the mechanism to push outward and transform. Seizing this transforming mechanism and reversing it into the yellow center is called "the elixir." Yet when the elixir is born, there are signs to observe. The *Daodejing* says: *"Vague and indistinct, yet within it is substance; dim and obscure, yet within it is essence."* Niwan said: *"When spirit and essence merge in obscurity and qi returns, flesh and bone fuse without awareness."* Master Yin said: *"Suddenly, an itch arises in the pores, the limbs become soft as cotton, the heart feels vague and indistinct—this is the scene of the elixir’s birth."* Moreover, there are signals to hear. Shaozi said: *"Suddenly, in the dead of night, a thunderclap—thousands of gates and ten thousand doors open in succession."* Master Hunran said: *"When the time arrives and qi transforms, the mechanism stirs and the flute sings—this is the moment the signal arrives."* The moment the signal arrives is the living midnight. Upon hearing this signal, prepare swiftly and do not err in the fire-work. If you miss it in the moment, how can you harvest the jade mushroom in an instant?

**Harvesting the Medicine**
Suddenly beholding the primordial single grain of elixir,
Its light blazes like a golden pellet.
If the *Xun* wind does not blow the bellows,
Even with desire, crossing the pass would be difficult.

A single grain of Golden Elixir, round and glowing, shines brightly like a golden pellet. Without the *Xun* wind blowing the bellows, how can it pass the *Weilü*, ascend the double passes of the spine, reach Niwan, and enter the cinnabar field?

*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Rise with the *Xun* wind, move the Kun fire."* Xiao Zixu said: *"The bellows of Qian and Kun have their number."* The *Xun* wind refers to the qi of breathing. The bellows is the mechanism. Only with the qi of breathing can one activate this mechanism, causing the medicine to rise and descend, circulating to complete one celestial cycle. Liu Huayang said: *"The Dao of the Golden Elixir begins when yang is born: concentrate spirit into the qi cavity, stir the bellows’ *Xun* wind, and blow gently into the furnace with each breath, like a blacksmith pumping the bellows."* When wind arises, fire flames; when fire flames, essence transforms; when essence transforms, qi is born. Harvest this born qi, let it rise and descend in circulation—this is called a "celestial cycle."

**Rising to the Origin**
The sun rises in Fusang, east of the great sea,
The wheel of fire flies across—do not slacken your effort.
The deer cart carries it to the summit of Kunlun,
Where cinnabar mercury naturally returns to the chamber of spirit.

The red sun of Fusang emerges from the west to the east—this is the true medicine, like the radiant sun moving from east to west.

At this moment, swiftly mount the wheel of fire to cross the vast and surging sea, ascending from the *Weilü* through the twin passes of *Jiājí*. Master Pure Yang said: *"Sit in stillness from midnight to noon, and the twin passes of Jiājí will lead you past Kunlun."* He also said: *"Rely on the hours before midnight and after noon to see—one pulse of celestial fluid rests at the spine’s end."* Xiao Zixu remarked: *"How many times I’ve laughed and pointed to Kunlun’s path—clearly, a road runs through the twin passes."* Yet for the reverse course, only the deer cart can push it forward. To pull the deer cart is true intent. With this single point of true intent, one can surmount perilous obstacles, pass the twin passes, ascend Kunlun, descend the Magpie Bridge, and guide the living mercury into the golden crucible of the spirit chamber, there to become an eternal treasure of the body.

**Uniting the Elixir**
The *Gèn* boy first returns to the womb of primordial chaos,
From this moment, husband and wife weave their silken bonds.
Seal the six gates and diligently tend the fire,
Within the curtains, spring’s warmth must be harmonious.

The *Gèn* boy symbolizes the medicine arriving from the *Gèn* palace. The womb of primordial chaos is the cavity of ancestral *qi*. The medicine of the *Gèn* boy enters the cavity of ancestral *qi* from the northeast, uniting with true lead like a couple binding their silken threads. Yet at first, they do not congeal—one must tightly seal the six gates, regulate the breath in unbroken continuity, and steam with the fire of spirit until they merge as one. The fire for uniting the elixir must be a gentle warmth, unlike the fierce blaze of the harvesting phase. Only with perfect harmony and balance can one achieve the touch that brings spring to life.

**Fire Timing**
Though six hundred scrolls record the fire’s lore,
None truly write the timing on phoenix paper.
Clearest of all are Chongxu’s words:
*"Breath by breath, the immortal’s path is complete."*

Master Zixian said: *"Sages transmit the medicine but not the fire—few have ever known its timing."* Ten thousand elixir classics never commit it to writing. Yet Chongxu alone declared: *"Who says the fire timing cannot be passed down? Follow the moment’s flow, silently guiding it into the profound. Gazing back at the sages of old—breath by breath, the immortal’s path is complete."* Thus, the essence of fire timing must be sought in the true breath. For breath arises from the heart; when the heart is still, the breath is regulated, and each breath returns to its root—this is the mother of the Golden Elixir. Yet fire timing is not uniform; the ancients distinguished inner and outer. Outer fire timing involves action and effort, the work of laying the foundation. Inner fire timing comes after the elixir is obtained, a matter of natural non-action. Both hinge on the two words *breath* and *rest*: without regulating the outer fire’s breath, one cannot circulate the elixir; without regulating the inner fire’s breath, one cannot nurture it. Thus, Liu Huayang said: *"The fire of ordinary breath transforms the essence of food to aid primordial essence; the fire of spirit transforms primordial essence to aid primordial qi; the fire of primordial qi transforms breath to aid primordial spirit; and the fire of primordial spirit transforms form to return to emptiness and aid the Dao. From beginning to end, all depends on the power of fire to ascend to the Great Luo as an immortal. Yet one must know that fire and timing are never separate—fire must respond to timing, and when timing arrives, so does fire."* Thus, the two words *fire* and *timing* involve step-by-step procedures, which, without a master’s transmission, remain difficult to fully grasp. One must cultivate virtue and pledge to heaven to seek a teacher’s guidance.

**Nurturing**
Now behold the white snow sowing cinnabar sand,
Balance cold and warmth—take care not to err.
When the thirty-six palaces brim with spring’s fullness,
Naturally, a path opens for the immortal’s raft.

Once true lead is obtained as white snow and cinnabar sand, the living mercury must be tempered with balanced warmth. *Nurturing* means avoiding excess heat. If too cold, the water chills and the elixir fails to form; if too hot, the fire scorches and the elixir melts. Thus, *warm nurturing* is a patient, unhurried process of natural transformation—like heaven nurturing things with timely rain and sun, like a mother carrying a child with regulated rest and activity, like a dragon guarding its pearl in still hibernation, like a hen brooding her eggs with unbroken warmth. Before midnight, advance the fire; after noon, withdraw the tally. At other times, regulate the breath in unbroken continuity, as if present yet absent, banishing deluded thoughts to dwell in simplicity and silence. As the ancients said: *"Harvesting the medicine takes but a moment; uniting the mercury requires ten months."* And: *"After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid."* Without skillful nurturing, how could the embryo reach perfection? The thirty-six palaces represent the three hundred and sixty degrees of the celestial cycle. After each full cycle, rest a while. The celestial cycle has its measure, and nurturing has its count—only when fully nurtured can the sacred embryo be formed. The details of its stages and numbers dare not be written on bamboo or silk, lest the celestial mechanism be revealed. Alas!

The immortal raft is not distant, the path to ascension lies open—only lament that people fail to cultivate virtue, ally with Heaven, or seek with empty heart and sincere devotion.

At this stage of *embryonic breathing*, take care not to grow careless. Let the spirit-breath flow ceaselessly, merging with the Great Void. One may ask: to what may the nurturing of the embryo be likened? It is as if returning to the state before father and mother were born.

After the elixir coalesces, spirit congeals with *qi*, and *qi* abides with spirit—like a woman with child, hence it is called the embryo. Yet there is no true embryo; it is the dwelling of spirit-breath. The embryo is the palace that shelters spirit; breath is the source that transforms the embryo. The embryo arises from breath, and breath abides through the embryo. Without breath, the embryo cannot form; without spirit, breath has no master. When spirit and breath depend upon each other, this is true *embryonic breathing*.

At this stage, take care not to grow careless. One must forget form and appearance, body merging with the Great Void, so that true breath comes and goes in unbroken continuity—seeming to exist yet not, as if forgotten yet present. Like fish in a spring pond, like insects in hibernation, exhalation reaches the root, inhalation reaches the stem, all day long in a state of undifferentiated oneness, as if still in the womb before birth. The Unparalleled Lord said: *"With every breath, return to the primordial Qian."* This is that.

When breath abides and the pulse stills, spirit settles. Only when spirit settles can one emerge from concentration, and the sacred embryo be perfected.

**Degrees of Practice**
Refining the elixir follows an order—*Kan* and *Li*, *Gen* and *Xun* reversed and inverted.
When the nine-nines of the celestial cycle are complete,
Who would fear failing to become a transcendent immortal?

The gentle practitioner’s path differs from the resolute one’s, yet success may come more easily. The resolute may subdue *qi* in three years; the gentle may achieve it in one, for the elixir already resides within. Yet though *qi* is more readily subdued, the red pulse remains the greatest threat to the Way. If a woman of true fortitude can sever the red pulse, her menses will cease, and the foundation will be laid.

After laying the foundation, refine essence into *qi*, dissolving the two *yang* of *Li* and the two *yin* of *Kan*, transforming them into the body of *Qian*. Though the *Kan-Li* work is complete and the *Qian* body formed, *qi* remains unrefined, spirit unenlightened. One must then refine *qi* into spirit, transmuting the single *yang* of *Gen* and the single *yin* of *Xun*, smelting away all external *yin* *qi* to forge pure *yang* spirit. When the celestial cycles reach their term and the nine-nines restore pure *yang*, one must then refine spirit to return to emptiness—only then does one become a transcendent immortal.

**Emergence from the Womb**
Seventy-six celestial cycles complete,
The *yang* spirit suddenly ascends to the upper field.
A thunderous roar shakes the Gate of Heaven,
Above the crown, white mist rises in contest.

When the work of the celestial cycle reaches seventy-six degrees, the sacred embryo is perfected. The *yang* spirit moves from the middle field to the upper field, breaking through the crown and emerging—this is called *emergence from the womb*. Zhongli Quan said: *"Thunder shakes the Gate of Heaven, startling gods and demons; the cosmos overturns, white clouds take flight."* The *True Transmission of the Golden Elixir* states: *"Suddenly, thunder resounds at the crown; in one’s arms, the infant is held."*

The reason spirit can emerge from the womb is because spirit has settled. Chongxu said: *"Initially, spirit cannot settle and relies on the two *qi* for stability. When *qi* settles, spirit follows and settles with it. When *qi* settles, it ceases to be *qi*; spirit, no longer dependent, stands alone—only then can it leave concentration and depart the body. Without attaining great stillness, spirit, still clinging to *qi*, cannot leave the body. Thus, when heart and breath depend upon each other, spirit settles and can emerge from concentration."*

The manifestations of emergence vary: some emerge amid a rain of heavenly flowers, others through a seven-tiered pagoda, or a body beyond the body. Some emerge with wind, clouds, and thunder—such was the case for Master Ma Danyang. Others emerge with fragrant winds and auspicious mists—such was the case for the Unparalleled Lord. In sum, spirit’s emergence arises from a single thought in deep stillness; its transformations and manifestations likewise arise from a single thought. Even a thousand, ten thousand, or myriad bodies arise from a single thought. One should not doubt the path because of differing manifestations. The "white mist rising" is but one example offered as evidence.

**Nurturing the Infant**
The newborn infant’s *qi* is not yet pure;
Still, it must swallow *wood mercury* to restore primordial truth.
After three years of nurturing,
It transforms, becomes numinous—truly spirit.

As the ancients said: *"The newborn infant is not yet fully formed; it must rely on the kindness of Mother Kun for nurture."* Only after three years of nursing can it transform and become numinous. Thus, it must still swallow *wood mercury* to restore primordial truth—not that three years are truly required, but rather three celestial cycles.

**Wall-Facing**
Though the elixir work is complete, there remains labor to be done.
With profound stillness, sit in meditation within the cave-heaven.

**Wall-Facing (continued)**
Nine years of forgetting form in samādhi complete,
Only when emptiness is shattered is true emptiness attained.
Wall-facing is the work of non-action.
The Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign said:
*"All affairs now done, I sit serene within my niche,
Light of body, I ride the purple qi,
Still of nature, I bathe in limpid pools.
Qi merges yin and yang as one,
Spirit unites heaven and earth as three.
Work complete, I ascend to the Jade Towers,
Letting forth a long whistle amid mist and clouds."*

Thus, when the nurturing work is fulfilled, one must choose a renowned mountain grotto or abode, sit in profound stillness, and face the wall to harmonize the spirit. Emerging, one takes the Great Void as the realm of transcendence; entering, one makes the Upper Cinnabar Field the dwelling of repose. Forgetting form, one enters samādhi to refine true emptiness—refining until emptiness itself is emptied, shattering the void so that spirit may return to the formless. This was Bodhidharma’s practice, requiring nine years of wall-facing.

**Ascension**
Refining to true emptiness, the Dao grows ever loftier;
A celestial writ descends, summoning one to tread the cloudy heavens.
Henceforth dwelling forever in the Jasper Pool Gardens,
Accompanying the spirit consorts to the early court.

The Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign said:
*"The auspicious hour arrives as I emerge from the valley,
A mere span away, I ascend to the divine clouds."*
And again:
*"One day, immortal and mortal part,
Cool and detached, I cross the sea’s tide."*

Once the return to the formless and ascent to the distant realms is at hand, a heavenly decree descends, cloud-cranes come to welcome, and one is summoned to the Jasper Pool for a celestial banquet, to attend the Golden Mother and receive the sacred charts. Jade towers and pearl palaces become one’s home; the Xiang River consorts and Jade Maidens, one’s companions. What joy could surpass this? The only regret is that the cosmos lacks resolute women—those who cannot stand beside Ma Gu. Yet if a woman is truly a hero among her sex, cultivating virtue to pledge herself to heaven, emptying her heart in sincere pursuit, she may walk this path—indeed, she may succeed even more readily than men. Let her but set her resolve and strive.

**Women’s Daoist Studies: A Small Collection**
*Preface to the Reprint of* Women’s Daoist Studies: A Small Collection

To propagate Daoist culture, excavate the treasures of Daoist scriptures, and provide theoretical guidance and practical verification for immortal Dao cultivation, we now reprint *Women’s Daoist Studies: A Small Collection*. Compiled by the advocate of immortal Dao, Chen Yingning, this work draws upon the physiological and psychological characteristics of women, adhering to the Daoist principle of seeking truth through practical realization. It gathers women’s cultivation methods from across the ages, meticulously selecting and editing them into five texts: *The Wondrous Scripture of Kun’s Peace*, *The Orthodox Methods of Women’s Practice*, *Ten Principles of Women’s Elixir*, *A Discourse on the Differences Between Men’s and Women’s Elixir Work*, and *A Collection of Women’s Elixir Poems*. This is one of the rarest specialized works on women’s cultivation.

Today, we reissue this book, consolidating it into two volumes without altering the original text, for the convenience of readers in perusal and preservation. Given current limitations in printing (and the lack of certain characters), we ask readers for their understanding and corrections.

**Editorial Principles of the *Women’s Daoist Studies Series***

1. Carefully selecting exemplary conduct and edifying words from women of past and present—concise works that cultivate lofty character and nurture exceptional wisdom in women—pertains to the psychological dimension.
2. Carefully selecting methods of cultivation, scriptures, treatises, and poems from women across the ages—works that foster extraordinary talent in women and strengthen the physical constitution of the fairer sex—pertains to the physiological dimension.
3. Daoist studies are the quintessence of the Chinese nation, unique to our land and absent in other countries. Previously, due to the lack of widespread education for women, this transcendent discipline remained inaccessible. Now, in accordance with the principle of equality between men and women, we gradually make this knowledge public.
4. Ancient writings vary in depth; some are profoundly abstruse and difficult to comprehend, while others are overly vulgar and uninspiring. To ensure accessibility, we annotate the abstruse passages to aid understanding and refine the vulgar ones to avoid offending refined sensibilities.
5. The editorial aim of this series is to promote China’s indigenous Daoist tradition while resolutely eliminating superstition. Any text tainted by superstition is excluded.

**Preface to the Collated *Wondrous Scripture of Kun’s Peace***

The origins of Daoist studies are lost to time. The earliest recorded instance appears in the teachings of Guangchengzi to the Yellow Emperor, dating back over 4,600 years. Though transmitted unbroken through the ages, it has occasionally faced suppression by narrow-minded Confucians and marginalization by Buddhist partisans. On the surface, it seemed to fade into obscurity, yet hidden in mountain forests and among wandering adepts, its secret oral transmission endured for millennia, unchanged. These masters vowed never to commit their teachings to writing, leaving outsiders unaware of their profound depths. Thus, while Confucian and Buddhist canons fill libraries, authentic Daoist texts remain as rare as morning stars—women’s Daoist scriptures even more so.

Over twenty years ago, I resolved to circulate esoteric alchemical texts but was hindered by unfavorable circumstances. Years passed with little progress. Now, fortunately, I have met Zhang Zhuming, master of Yihua Hall, a kindred spirit. After mutual consultation, we have compiled the *Women’s Daoist Studies Series*, with the *Wondrous Scripture of Kun’s Peace* as its first publication. We gathered six versions—printed editions, hand-copied manuscripts, and family-held texts—each differing in phrasing and riddled with errors. Comparing them, we selected the finest readings, revising and polishing the text from beginning to end until it took on a new form. Though not yet perfect, what remains are but minor flaws in an otherwise refined work. Eager to meet the needs of the world, we publish it now. Should we later obtain rare manuscripts, we will undertake another round of collation to achieve perfection—this we leave to future efforts.

*Written in January of the 24th year of the Republic of China (4,631st year of the Yellow Emperor’s reign) by Chen Yingning of Wanjiang, at Hongdao Studio in Shanghai*

**Guidelines for Reading the Scripture**

1. Women who seek the Dao often struggle without texts to study or scriptures to expound. Even those earnest in their pursuit, unable to find the proper path, frequently stray into error. Once the cause is misplaced, the result is entirely lost—a lamentable outcome. With this scripture’s publication, if those well-versed in profound principles thoroughly study its text, delve deeply into its meaning, adapt teachings to the times, and expound them skillfully, allowing all to hear and harmonize understanding with practice, it may well herald a dawn for women’s Daoist cultivation.
2. This scripture first expounds the principles of creation and human life, then the cultivation of women’s virtue, followed by the roots of body, mind, nature, and destiny. It reveals the secrets of the Golden Elixir and Jade Crucible, guiding practitioners to awaken the heart, realize truth, and ascend together to the ranks of immortals. It encompasses all fundamental methods of Kun’s cultivation, addressing the psychological and physiological needs of women. If expounded skillfully, its effects will be profound.
3. When Buddhist masters lecture on scriptures, laywomen often mingle among monks, nuns, and lay devotees. They join in palms, bows, chants, and even drowsy nods—mirroring the crowd in every gesture. Occasionally startled awake, they feign attentiveness, their discomfort plain. Yet when the lecture ends and they are asked about the scripture’s meaning, they respond with blank stares, offering only, *"I don’t understand."* To claim such listening yields benefit is self-deception. The reasons for their incomprehension are twofold: first, the scripture’s teachings fail to resonate with women’s sensibilities, feeling alien and unrelatable; second, the lecturer’s monotonous and dull delivery fails to engage the audience, lulling the entire hall into a hypnotic state. Thus, Buddhist scripture lectures become mere ritual, impressive in appearance but hollow in substance.

**IV.** To lecture on the *Kun Ning Jing*, one must devise ways to avoid the second pitfall of Buddhist scripture lectures. Within the lecture hall, the temperature should be comfortable, and the air should circulate freely. All rituals and arrangements may be adjusted flexibly according to time and place, without rigid adherence. If financial constraints exist, burning a small amount of fine incense suffices; other decorations should be kept simple. Most crucially, the audience must be kept calm and focused, never allowed to drift into drowsiness.

**V.** The lecturer’s qualifications must include: (1) mastery of the philosophical principles of the Supreme Ultimate, yin-yang, the Five Phases, and the Eight Trigrams; (2) knowledge of the histories of eminent women in ancient China; (3) understanding of the roots of body, mind, nature, and destiny; and (4) clarity on the methods of *nüdan* (women’s internal alchemy) cultivation. Lacking any one of these four fields of learning, one cannot properly explicate this scripture.

**VI.** Each lecture should last no more than one hour, lest the audience forget what they have heard. Fortunately, the text is concise, comprising eighteen chapters in total. One chapter may be covered per session, completing the scripture in eighteen lectures; or two sessions per chapter, finishing in thirty-six. Whether held daily, every two or three days, or weekly, the schedule may be decided as circumstances allow.

**VII.** The lecture hall should be equipped with a blackboard and chalk. When encountering passages relevant to the scripture’s meaning, the lecturer may write them out on the spot for the audience’s reference.

**VIII.** Regarding the practical oral instructions of *nüdan* cultivation, any details unsuitable for public discourse should follow the transmission rules of past masters. The lecturer must not violate ancient precedents, nor should the audience insist on disclosure.

**Chapter One: Nourishing Life**
The two modes intermingle, life originating from Qian;
All things take form, nourished by Kun.
Kun’s yielding and steadfastness align with Qian’s compliance,
Storing and congealing, its Dao is upright.
The work of bearing all things—none but Kun can achieve it.
Paired with Heaven, it establishes the ultimate standard.
In singularity and constancy, yin and yang do not err,
Mysteriously giving rise to transformation.
Every being relies on it for growth and sustenance,
Each breath draws from its enduring presence.
Profound is the principle of ceaseless generation;
Subtle is the source of endless transformation.
Within utmost stillness lies utmost movement,
From the turbid abyss, the clear stream divides.
To grasp the guiding threads of feminine virtue,
First discern the profound mysteries of Kun’s primal power.

The earth bears all beneath the sky,
Yin holds the marvel of containing yang.
Illuminating the Four Conducts to establish a fragrant model,
Rejecting the Seven Emotions to return to the supreme Dao,
Moderating deportment to leave a mark in history,
Refining the spirit to attain the Purple Palace’s title—
Discoursing on the scripture to uphold the eternal model of motherhood,
Wielding the brush to impart teachings to all women.
The work of nourishing life begins with proclaiming its essence.

---

**Chapter Two: Transforming Qi**
Yin and yang alternate in endless cycles,
Day and night shift in ceaseless motion.
Qi divides at the two solstices,
Its movement embracing the Three Origins’ marvels.
The mechanism of transformation leaves no trace,
Its pivot lying at the center;
Substance and function are interdependent,
Each concealing the other at their juncture.
Vast and boundless, it begins as non-being yet manifests being,
Ultimately returning from being to non-being.
Flowing in primordial vastness, from solidity it becomes void,
From void it verifies solidity.
Void and solid, solid and void—
their origins remain inscrutable;
Being and non-being, non-being and being—
their signs are equally unfathomable.
The precelestial Supreme Ultimate is the root of creation,
The great Dao of Qian and Kun is the vitality of all beings.
Women, embodying Kun’s form and inheriting Qian’s work,
Attain stillness and oneness.
Stillness concentrates in tranquility,
Oneness refines in virtue.
Unknowing and unperceiving, they follow the Emperor’s decree,
Grasping the true mechanism of receptivity,
Harmonizing the sun and moon within the body.
Ceaselessly flowing in natural spontaneity,
Each breath returns to the root and cave.
Drawing the clear spring from the Water Palace,
Nurturing the luminous moon of the Spirit Terrace—
Awakening to the subtle and mysterious,
They become immortals of the Jasper Pool.

---

**Chapter Three: Purifying Karma**
To ascend the immortal’s steps, one must eliminate evil karma.
Before evil is purged, virtue cannot flourish.
If the mind is deluded by desire,
Or emotions entangled in attachment—
Whether lingering in coquetry,
Or swayed by sorrow, laughter, or tears;
Whether ensnared by unbroken threads of longing,
Dragged into the depths by their pull;
Or misled into the net of illusion,
Suffering injustice on the wrong path—
The Yellow Springs echo with sorrow,
Vainly lamenting the loss of reason;
The netherworld’s winds scatter regrets,
Yet the roots of love remain.
Bound by such fetters,
How can one escape the wheel of rebirth?
To emerge from the sea of illusion,
Rely solely on the torch of wisdom.
Body, speech, and mind must never invite transgression;
Killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct must be scrupulously avoided.
Sincerely embracing goodness is like fine grain basking in the morning sun;
A myriad of thoughts dissolve like boiling water melting snow.
Purify the source to properly cultivate,
Awaken to causes and conditions—
Attaining the Dao is then no difficult task.

---

**Chapter Four: Cultivating Goodness**
When worldly karma is fully cleansed,
Sweeping away dross to expand the mind’s clarity;
When past and present harmonize,
Clearing the brambles to illuminate the nature’s sky—
The empty and numinous shine forth,
Revealing the constancy of innate goodness.
Gather the spirit and focus on cultivating noble conduct.
Accumulated goodness brings blessings,
While accumulated evil brings calamity—
As the Kun hexagram records, good intentions run deep.
The Dao of the Most High refines qi to achieve suppleness;
The words of the *Chu Book* declare goodness as the essence.
A gentle and yielding nature can rectify conduct;
Goodness returns to softness, manifesting kindness and humility.
Compose the will with solemnity,
Restrain the body with warmth and tranquility.
Embrace emptiness with harmony,
Uphold constancy with wondrous responsiveness.
Nurture qi through silence,
Purify the heart without contention.
Cherish all life to preserve vitality,
Study the Dao’s essentials to clarify true nature.
Having fulfilled the duties of human relationships,
Delve into the profound mysteries of the unseen.
Avoid empty talk of embroidered images—
Instead, investigate the heart-seal of the returned elixir.
Never dismiss small acts of goodness,
Nor resent the goodness of others.

Amidst the harmonious light of wind and moon, within the curtains of one’s natural disposition, one lights incense to reverently worship the primordial spirit of one’s own nature, and pours water to cultivate the luminous treasury of clarity. Let none say that women lack outstanding talent, for one must know that the Mysterious Gate holds the wondrous subtleties of *Kun*-tranquility.

**Chapter Five: Exalting Virtue**
Heaven has five thieves—when employed, they bring prosperity;
Humans possess five blessings—when cultivated, they bring goodness.
Great virtue does not claim virtue, flowing like a river;
Small virtues accumulate virtue, earnestly practiced and transforming.
In essence, it is *Gen*-stillness; in function, it is adaptability.
Attaining the mean, all traces and images dissolve.
The great transformation is called sageliness—its spirit cannot be fathomed.

The work of women’s cultivation begins with eliminating hidden faults.
What is the key? Distinguishing delusion to attain truth.
Now, women’s perceptions often err toward yin’s secrecy,
Wavering in ambiguity, suspicion, and indecision.
Thus, their passions and desires are prone to arrogance and folly,
While their understanding is frequently clouded by confusion.
Moreover, they seldom peruse the classics,
And even refined daughters of official families merely adorn themselves with embroidered curtains and painted chambers;
Noble ladies of gentry clans do no more than recite verses on snow and wind.
Needlework and embroidery may display boudoir marvels,
While seductive dances and amorous songs further flaunt their allure—
Yet how few know the noble beauty of chastity and stillness,
Or possess the pure excellence of lofty virtue.
Of old, the woman of Beiguo declined office, her fame resounding in Chu;
Meng Guang lifted the tray to eye level, earning praise from Liang Hong.
Yet while great families issued instructions, their words were not detailed;
The *Biographies of Exemplary Women* left their transmissions incomplete.
Here, therefore, the *Kun-Tranquility* is wondrously expounded
To serve as a model for the inner chambers.
Talented women of the boudoir, let virtue be your foundation;
Fragrant bedding and fine talents—may they aspire to this exalted hope.
From beginning to end, never abandon it, that your roots may remain firm.

**Chapter Six: Women’s Education**
To nurture correctness in youth is the work of sage-making.
*Kun* is fundamentally yielding—this is the Dao of softness.
Of old, there were worthy women who established teachings through their own conduct.
Their orchid-like nature was innate; their fragrant words were emulated.
They preserved chastity without marrying, guarding the inner chamber for a decade.
Gentle in temperament and graceful in demeanor, their wisdom was serene and refined.
Rising early and retiring late, their filial piety and reverence were sincere.
They governed subordinates with harmony and cultivated themselves with dignity.
In movement and speech, they adhered to rules and discipline.
The tortoise-mirror and grand chronicles once recorded women’s histories:
Some moved their husbands through filial devotion to the divine,
Some surpassed men in loyalty and steadfastness,
Some were as stern as autumn frost,
Some as radiant as the sun in the heavens,
Some had righteousness that could pierce metal and stone,
Some had valor that could stir wind and thunder,
Some had wisdom to resolve great doubts,
Some had talent to aid an era.
Tracing their virtuous deeds, their fragrance lingers through the ages.
Drawing from their fine example, a hundred years gain luster.
You, ladies of the boudoir, keenly observe these precedents.
Do not covet empty glory or pride yourselves on literary brilliance.
Wash away cosmetic adornments; do not boast of extravagant attire or exotic makeup.
Compose your brush with solemnity; do not craft ornate phrases or flowery lines.
Cultivate ethical relations and love learning;
Delight in the *Book of Rites* and understand the *Book of Poetry*.
Devote yourself to weaving and sewing; do not merely adorn yourself with delicate craft.
Purify your conduct in the inner quarters, embodying frugality and diligence.
Rectify soft virtue to perfect your reputation.
Further refine your true nature and preserve your primordial essence,
Achieving merit in both inner and outer realms,
Refining qi from dawn to dusk.
Thus, even in maidenhood, one may attain the Dao,
And ride the simurgh or crane to ascend in flight.

**Chapter Seven: The Way of the Wife**
The way of the wife is revered and requires steadfast cultivation.
She is the equal counterpart to *Qian*, her maternal demeanor impeccable.
At the time of tying the sash, her kind mother’s instructions
Must be respected and heeded, never disobeying her husband.
The bond of husband and wife is the beginning of human relationships.
Governing the household requires teaching; the main chamber demands propriety.
Pulling the deer-cart together, sharing coarse blankets without shame,
Drawing water and grinding grain with one’s own hands, finding no disgrace in simple fare.
Do not meddle in trivial matters or speak of inner-chamber affairs.
Having assisted the head of the household, instruct children and grandchildren.
Like Jing Jiang, who diligently spun thread,
Or Meng Mother, who moved thrice for her son’s education,
Or the mother who prepared bear gall to aid her son’s studies,
Or the wife who sent salted fish to cultivate integrity,
Or the woman who received lessons from behind a screen,
Or the one who cut her hair to detain a guest—
These former worthies have passed; who will continue their fine legacy?
In all wealthy and noble families, one must abandon haughty airs.
Within the household, foster benevolence and deference—
Thus, descendants will be fine and their fragrance enduring.
Even those who engage in humble work must extinguish the sprouts of resentment.
With mutual respect, joy and contentment may be found;
Children and grandchildren will surely flourish.
Caution against greed and delusion to pacify violent temper,
Sober infatuation to prevent dissipation and excess.
If a wife’s virtue is irreproachable, human relationships will be fulfilled.
Good fortune then brings sons and longevity;
Blessings bring peace to the body and glory to one’s name.
Having attained such noble beauty, the mysteries of cultivation may be pursued.
Having guided you in your fundamental duties,
I further instruct you in the true scripture.

**Chapter Eight: Scriptures and Treatises**
In high antiquity, the world was undifferentiated, its qi and beings pure and simple.
Harmonizing yin and yang, all was luminous and bright—names and forms were undivided.
Then the *Qiu Suo* arose; in middle antiquity, Fu Xi and Shen Nong
Drew diagrams and expounded the trigrams, creating written records to inaugurate teachings.
They bequeathed canonical texts and plans, flourishing from the Yu and Xia dynasties.
Yet all their writings transmitted this single heart-seal—
There was no distinction, much less division between men and women.
Moreover, in this endowment of life, all share the same primordial origin.
Though their forms differ, their principles are the same.
Only essence and qi, with spirit as their master.
Whether pure or turbid, the heart-monarch governs.
Curb desires and forget passions to lay the foundation and refine the self.
The Mysterious Female harmonizes; the tide’s mark vanishes.
From the ordinary and near, one ascends from the dust to the heavens’ summit.
Stabilizing contemplation is the work of self-mastery;
The *Yellow Court* conceals the true person’s countenance.
The Western Flower proclaimed wondrous transformation;
The Golden Mother drew forth the numinous wind.
Preserving form requires no corpse-liberation;
Refining qi enters directly into the celestial vault.
Maidens, unharmed by the injuries of intercourse and childbirth,
Easily transform their forms to awaken enlightenment.
Women, often defiled by the corruption of pregnancy and childbirth,
Must purify their aspirations and cultivate their bearing.
Abandon all private desires; extinguish the myriad distractions.
Broadly study scriptures and treatises to enter the gate of myriad wonders.

**Chapter Nine: Awakening from Delusion**

Vast as the dusty sea, surging as wind and waves,
Water and land shift through kalpas; ancient and modern pass like morning and dusk.
This floating life is but a transient lodging—
Alas for the five turbidities of this bodily form, a dream dissolving by dawn;
Lament the fleeting decades, skin like a chicken’s, hair like a crane’s.
Scarce can youth’s crimson glow endure—jade beauty and flower-like visage
Are swiftly entombed in the green barrow.
Some are burdened by sons and daughters,
Others stained by the allure of splendor.
If one does not seek early escape from the path of delusion,
How can one abide long in the mortal realm?

Born, life is already ephemeral;
Dead, how then to transcend?
Women, by nature serene and retiring,
Thus find cultivation secure and steadfast:
Firmly seal the golden essence within the mysterious chamber,
Sever the celestial waters at the layered pass.
Their merit surpasses the crimson snow elixir,
Their spirit roams the gardens of Langfeng.
They laugh at the coquetry of powdered faces,
Equating it with the affectations of actors.

Seizing this opportunity for universal deliverance,
Swiftly board the Dharma-boat and retreat into seclusion.
The women of old who realized the Dao
All dwelt atop Penglai’s summit.
Awaken the deluded beside your pillow;
Do not mistake the illusions before your eyes.
Know that the work of return and restoration
Must be undertaken with urgency and diligence.

The pure and tranquil source is the foundation of life and destiny—
The sublime principle of Earth’s origin is known to few.
A trace of dawn’s moon glimmers in the east,
Yet none fathom the time before this bodily birth.

---

**Chapter Ten: The Earth’s Foundation**

The two qi intertwine; the central yellow responds to the mysterious.
The five phases engender one another, yet only Earth is complete.
Its virtue is stability,
Its merit deep accumulation,
Its nature single-minded,
Its function true and constant.
It nurtures the ten thousand beings, fostering their flourishing;
Above, it aligns with Heaven; below, it connects with the abyss.
It harmonizes the hundred meridians,
Irrigates the three fields.

The yellow sprout emerges from the soil—
Behold the tender shoots of the medicine;
White snow congeals into butter—
Discern the wondrous tone of the ice-pure vessel.
Secure the primal essence within the mysterious female;
Enter a single thought into the profound obscurity.
Begin by mastering the self;
Apply effort solely in preserving the spirit.
In the four dignities, practice silent illumination;
Within inner visualization, settle the mind.
Only when the Celestial Monarch attains tranquility
Can one circulate and traverse freely.

Without grasping the true essence,
All efforts are but empty names.
It is like building a house—
First, one must lay the foundation.
Or like firing a furnace—
First, one must kindle the flame.
The five phases gather and cluster,
Binding the affinity of the central palace’s numinous terrace;
The four images are arranged,
Unfolding the mysteries of the Earth’s alchemical chamber.
Without recognizing the mysterious pass,
One cannot speak of the supreme Dao.

Constantly illumine the root within this bodily birth;
Investigate life and destiny through the teachings of immortality.
Mind is Dao; Dao is attainable.
---

**Chapter Eleven: The Root**

In this world, whether man or woman,
To know the root is to enter the Dao.
The root is the origin of nature;
The stem is the stalk of life.
Like a tree, one must cultivate its root—
Only when the root is firm can it flourish.
Or like a flower or fruit, which first sprouts from the stem—
Only when the stem is replete can it ripen.

How can one fail to safeguard the human root?
Tracing back to its origin, the root was originally steadfast—
Why willingly hack and wound it?
Self-inflicted harm,
Extinguishing nature and trivializing life,
One sinks among the blind multitudes.
Thus, the single spark of numinous light from the primordial beginning
Gradually erodes,
Inevitably leading to perdition.

Consider the myriad beings of the cosmos—
Each has its own root.
Even the tiniest creatures
Know to nurture their lives.
How can humans,
Of all beings, be inferior to them?

Yet when blood and qi are disharmonious, the root is difficult to establish;
When the bodily form is leaky, the root is difficult to complete;
When pregnancies are many, the root is difficult to secure;
When love and desire cling, the root is difficult to strengthen;
When ignorance and turbidity mingle, the root is difficult to clarify;
When spirit and will are chaotic, the root is difficult to pacify;
When greed and self-interest disturb, the root is difficult to purify;
When deceit and pretense become habit, the root is difficult to preserve.
Thus, in cultivation, progress cannot be refined.

Knowing these ills, sweep them away one by one.
Do not shake your root;
Do not harm your foundation.
Cherish your nature and life;
Guard your essence and qi at all times.
Calm the spirit and preserve the true;
Dispel delusion and uphold sincerity.
Investigate the root alone—
Thus may one attain longevity.

---

**Chapter Twelve: Nature and Life**

Life originates from nature; nature is rooted in life.
They are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth,
The numen of the ten thousand things.
Before life was established, nature was originally the same;
After life exists, it does not depart from this nature.
The goodness of innate virtue
Is possessed by all.
Though there are men and women,
Nature knows no distinction.

Tracing back to the origin,
Nature is nameless.
Before the Supreme Ultimate divided,
How could nature and life be separate?
Only after the Two Modes emerged
Did nature and life become manifest.

Nature is the treasure of life;
Life is the source of nature.
To cultivate nature is to preserve the mind;
To refine life is to realize the Dao.

Do not resign yourself to fate—
That is to belittle life.
Do not falsely claim nature is evil—
That is to misconstrue nature.
To know the root of nature and life,
One must investigate the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth.

Within yang, yin is contained to receive form;
Within the moon, the sun is embraced to generate light.
This inherent interplay of Heaven’s mechanism
Is the sublime principle of nature and life.

Movement begins in the beginningless;
When movement reaches its extreme, yin arises.
Stillness abides in the endless;
When stillness reaches its extreme, yang arises.
One yin, one yang;
One movement, one stillness.
Clear and turbid, above and below—
Thus creation is revealed.
The root of yin and yang, movement and stillness,
Is the essence of nature, life, body, and mind.

A single numinous awareness illumines—
The sea of nature ever emits the light of wisdom.
When the ten thousand things are all empty,
The Gate of Life alone opens the path of birth.
To preserve nature is to preserve the whole, to receive the whole, to return to the whole;
To refine life is to refine immortality, to refine the Dao.
Mutual cultivation of both
Is the ultimate practice.

---

**Chapter Thirteen: The Substance of the Mind**

The substance of the mind is non-action,
Profoundly still and ever tranquil.
Before any sign appears,
The mechanism of transformation vanishes.
The Supreme Void is undifferentiated,
Silent and motionless.
The Great Emptiness is formless,
Its wonder beyond comparison.
Subtle and minute, pure and unified—
When yin and yang first divide,
There is one to preside.
Forcibly made the pivot,
It is called the Celestial Mind.

**Chapter Fourteen: Pointing to the Mysterious**

The primordial qi is employed with the acquired spirit;
The acquired substance is named by the primordial.
Thus do heaven and earth establish life,
And all beings secure their bodies.
Tang and Yu transmitted it in succession,
While sages and worthies preserved it in perpetuity.
Tracing the ten thousand things to their one source,
Uniting the Three Teachings in the one truth.
Only the real, only the one—
Ever wakeful, ever luminous.
Vast and empty yet undimmed,
Its substance radiant and clear.

To know the Dao-mind as the root of the human mind
Is to see the human mind as the function of the Dao-mind.
To speak of the Dao-mind is not the Dao-mind;
To speak of the human mind is not the human mind.
To speak of a mind as existent yet not perceive it as such,
To speak of no-mind yet not perceive it as absent—
Do not stir the deluded mind,
But stir the mind of awareness.
The mind of awareness ever illumines,
The deluded mind ever empty.
The fundamental substance thus abides,
And the true mind appears.

To grasp or abandon it is still effort;
To forget both grasping and abandoning
Is to attain the solitary realization of the fasting of the mind.
The teaching of the four "do nots"
Returns to spontaneity.
Like the moon’s reflection in a cold pond,
Like still water’s clarity—
The substance of the mind, profound and still,
Is likewise thus.

Goodness or evil of nature are but provisional names;
Dao-mind and human mind have caused endless dispute through the ages.
Clinging to words and grasping at images,
None fathom the original truth.
Primordial and acquired—
Which aligns, which diverges?
I reveal the substance of the mind to you all:
Seek only the Dao-mind, do not scrutinize the human mind;
Awaken only the true mind, do not give rise to the deluded mind;
Preserve only the mind of awareness, do not stir the selfish mind;
Abide in no-mind, do not cling to a mind of existence.
In such tranquil equanimity,
The hundred parts of the body obey.
To cultivate the Dao or refine immortality
Follows what the mind realizes.

**Chapter Fourteen: Pointing to the Mysterious**

The mysterious cannot be pointed to;
To point is not the mysterious.
Since nothing can be pointed to,
The mysterious is hard to express.
What then is spoken of?
The empty void itself.

The mysterious within the mysterious
Is called the ultimate meaning.
When mind and nature are utterly still,
The empty void shatters.
Without substance or form,
What aim or flavor could there be?
Yet this wondrous method
Is the supreme vehicle.
Mysterious beyond mystery,
Beyond all description.

The pure Dao-body—
All may attain this.
Sudden awakening to the nature of heaven
Leaps beyond all bounds.
Those of middling capacity or below
Scarcely hear of this subtle principle.
Thus is guidance offered,
Opening the gate of expedient means.
Though its meaning ranks second,
Its Dao is the same in return.
Those who aspire to cultivate truth
May rely upon this.

The Dao’s wonder is stored in the subtle and profound,
While spirit and essence congeal in the mysterious female.
The gate of life, the door of death—
Exiting Kan, entering Li—
None surpass this,
For the mysterious is the barrier.
The bellows blends yin and yang,
The furnace and tripod are established—
None lie beyond this,
For the mysterious is the key.

This mysterious one
Is the master of nature and life,
The foundation of creation,
The seed of the embryo,
The abode of the primordial spirit.
Thus it is called the Five Mysteries,
Establishing the ultimate of the Three Powers.
Heart, liver, spleen, and lungs
Each have their repository,
Yet the primordial essence
Returns solely to the sea of the kidneys.
This is the pivot of the human body,
The destination of the stars,
Where the hundred vessels converge,
Where the three carts transport,
Their axle set in motion.
For men and women cultivating truth,
All lies here—
Mysterious, oh mysterious!
Dark and indistinct,
Being within non-being,
Non-being within being.
I would point to it,
Yet nothing can be pointed to.
Know this mystery,
Then gathering medicine and applying fire,
You may naturally achieve the seven returns and nine reversions.
Without the work of refining the self,
You will struggle to lay the foundation.
The immortals and sages of past ages
Have spoken of this in detail.
Pointing to the true mechanism,
The great elixir is easily refined.
Universally binding Earth’s affinity,
Together we become companions in the Dharma.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Golden Elixir**

Eons of true cultivation,
A legacy unbroken through millennia—
Who has heard its echo?
Who can discern the scorched paulownia?
Who can split the jade?
How would they know the uncut stone?
Hares nursing foals,
Different species seeking one another.
Swallows nesting in a phoenix’s nest—
Lesser virtues delude themselves.
With such examples,
How can one hope to learn longevity?
To shoulder the great Dao
Is no different from bearing a mountain.
Unenlightened about life and death,
How can one grasp the elixir’s essence?
Rather than stray into side paths,
Better to rest in stillness.
Yet most learners in the world
Are just like this.
Gazing across land and sea,
How truly lamentable!

Moreover, women,
Unenlightened about the subtle and profound,
Sit secluded in chambers,
Wasting their beauty in vain.
Even with aspiration,
Where would they find a teacher?
Pitying your delicate forms,
I open a swift path—
A method grounded in truth,
Free from fragmentation.
Within this very body,
Trace the source to its origin.
The female elixir is most simple,
The Earth Dao most easy.

As the dawn sun rises,
Its light just beginning to appear—
Circulate mercury to match lead,
Spirit and qi both abiding.
Accumulating qi begins in the land of generative qi;
Preserving spirit is the path to refining spirit.
First cut off desire and forget emotion,
Then enter the chamber and sit in meditation,
Refining the self as men do.

Regulate the breath, soft and unforced—
When the first yang stirs,
Practice the work of zi, wu, mao, and you.
When the hundred vessels are open,
Determine the positions of Qian, Dui, Kan, and Li.
The mysterious female established,
The tripod emits the yellow sprout.
The bellows opens,
Heaven bestows sweet dew.

Primordial essence congeals mercury in the mud-pill of the Niwan;
The fire of spirit circulates, refining the Jade Peak.
Carefully observe the signs of the tide’s approach,
Reversing the flow of the Yellow River, the waters naturally course through.
Golden essence transforms into liquid,
Cinnabar mercury radiates light.
Guard the numinous elixir in the original chamber,
Nurture true qi in the yellow room.
After forty-nine days, the elixir’s foundation is firm;
After a hundred days, the Red Dragon descends.
Refining form is refining qi—
This is the great elixir’s method.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Jade Dipper**

Heaven has the seven luminaries,
Wielding the authority of the jade armillary.
Humans have the seven orifices,
Subtly employing form and spirit.
Vessels and channels align with celestial movements,
Stars converge at the mysterious aperture.
Comprehending the pivot and balance of the Jade Dipper,
One ascends to the rank of the celestial perfected.
Using this as a universal bridge,
It guides you directly into the land of immortals.

All women,
With sincere and pure hearts,
In the stillness of night,
When the first yang of zi turns,
Concentrate the spirit and sit upright,
Calm the breath and lower the light.
Knock the teeth to gather essence,
Silently recite the numinous verses.

Direct the spirit to the primordial sea, passing straight through the kidney hall, ascending via the Jiaji Pass to pay homage to the Jade Emperor. The essence of stars moves the seal, the celestial sun blazes brilliantly. Above, it connects with the Northern Dipper, purple qi rising between the brows. Visualize the true form, illuminating my yellow chamber. The cinnabar primordial spirit-palace radiates luminous splendor, containing and emitting light. Azure, vermilion, white, and yellow—Wood, Fire, Metal, and Earth—along with the dark essence of kidney water, form five colors. These align directly with the Dipper’s radiance, intertwining as companions. Together they enter the cinnabar primordial, nurturing the sea of essence, transforming into the true person’s form, bursting forth from the crown of the head. Passing through the North Polar Palace, with sincere devotion, one pays homage, circling the Dipper’s city before returning to the original body. Gathering the golden light, nurturing essence and cleansing marrow, the five qi return to the origin—no practice surpasses this. Diligently cultivate it, and in three years, distant ascension is achieved.

This is the secret chapter of the Jade Dipper, the supreme vehicle’s essence. Those of wisdom who truly cultivate, if destined, may attain it.

**Chapter Seventeen: Realizing the Truth**

To cultivate the Dao is to cultivate immortality; to aspire to sageliness is to aspire to worthiness. There is no distinction between men and women—only in the single-minded devotion of the heart. Sincerity without ceasing endures; spiritual illumination lies within each person. If one can practice with embodied dedication, wisdom and perfect comprehension naturally arise. To hear of the great Dao, one must understand true cultivation. If cultivation is not genuine, how can realization be authentic? Know that true realization discards superficialities, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to grasp life itself. Leaping from the mundane cage, one reaches the realm of the sacred.

Worldly cultivation clings to names, and by clinging to names, it lacks substance. To pass away without awakening is deeply lamentable. Though the Three Teachings all possess true realization, their fruitions are not necessarily identical. From beginning to end, in substance and function, they may be partial and incomplete. Grasping only one aspect, few achieve success. You must understand: in women’s cultivation, the work is divided into nine grades, each grade into three steps. Three nines accumulate, forming twenty-seven layers. Cultivating both nature and life—this is the great vehicle. Illuminating substance and mastering function, penetrating beginning and end, the yang spirit universally transforms, its light filling the void. Yet the void is not clung to—what void is not real? Within lies the profound mechanism, the ebb and flow of yin and yang. Profoundly still and perfectly luminous, the true reality is clearly understood. May all of you devote yourselves to this meaning, verify it through practice, and not merely chase names and reputations. The Most High forgets emotions, extinguishing thoughts and deliberations. True realization is not empty—aim for the highest.

**Chapter Eighteen: Arousing the Mind**

The great void is profound and boundless, its dharmic vow vast and deep. The sea of suffering is endless, but turning the heart is the shore. All good devotees, present and future, holding this heart-incense, together pledge sincere vows: arouse the mind of true faith, without doubt; arouse the mind of diligent progress, without laziness; arouse the mind of resolute determination, without entanglement; arouse the mind of humility, without arrogance; arouse the mind of aspiration, without mundane attachments; arouse the mind of purity, without desire; arouse the mind of compassion, without harm; arouse the mind of wisdom, without greed or anger; arouse the mind of perfect comprehension, without attachment. Vow to refrain from all evil and practice all good.

**Women’s Orthodox Methods**
*Editorial Note on the Daoist Studies Series*

**I.**
The origins of Daoist studies trace back to the Daoist school of the pre-Qin era. The teachings of Daoism originated with the Yellow Emperor and reached their culmination with Laozi. They flowed into Zhuangzi and Liezi, transformed into Han Fei and Guiguzi, and branched into Heguanzi and Huainanzi. The history of Chinese Daoism predates the emergence of Indian Buddhism by over two thousand years, making its lineage the most venerable—unmatched by any other religious or philosophical tradition in the world.

**II.**
Daoism diverged into distinct streams, one of which evolved into Confucianism. Confucianism further branched into the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties. Thus, the scope of Daoist studies is broader than that of Neo-Confucianism.

**III.**
Within Daoism, the tradition of self-cultivation became the foundation of later Immortalist schools. The Yellow Emperor pursued immortality even amid warfare, while Laozi explicitly expounded the Way of "longevity and enduring vision." Therefore, the term *Daoist studies* encompasses the study of immortality.

**IV.**
The editor had long planned a comprehensive *Anthology of Immortality and Dao*, vast in scope and profound in depth, which has since been published in woodblock editions. However, as the process requires considerable time, the editor—eager to satisfy scholars’ desire for early access—has now undertaken the compilation of this *Daoist Studies Series*. The selection of materials is meticulous, publication swift, and emphasis placed on practical application, eschewing empty discourse. Though the volumes are concise, their methods are boundless.

**V.**
The editorial aim of this series is to promote China’s indigenous Daoist studies while resolutely eliminating superstition. Any text even slightly tainted by superstition has been excluded.

**Preface to *Women’s Orthodox Methods* by Chen**
This work was originally titled *Zhihua’s Direct Pointers to Women’s Orthodox Methods* and was authored by Qingxia Lingyang Daoren. It was transmitted to the world as one of the few specialized texts for women’s cultivation.

Its purpose is to guide women—whether renunciates or lay devotees of the Dao—in verifying and refining their pure practice. However, due to its long circulation, the text has been extensively corrupted by blind and misguided practitioners. For instance, the *General Explanation* section, though over twelve hundred characters in length, is a patchwork of hackneyed phrases and trite expressions, and thus has been omitted. Additionally, the sections on Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and heterodox teachings have been removed, as they bear no relevance to women’s internal alchemy (*nüdan*). Moreover, their discussions of the three teachings’ core principles and histories contain numerous omissions and errors, while the section on heterodoxy is particularly unrefined. The text has therefore been revised beginning from the first chapter through the sixth, which detail women’s internal alchemy methods. Though these techniques are somewhat contrived and not entirely natural, they have a long-standing tradition, and practitioners should be familiar with them. The seventh chapter is overly brief, while the eighth and ninth chapters, which discuss the yang spirit, incorporate many foreign terms inconsistent with Immortalist terminology. The present edition follows the corrections of Yang Yiyu’s 1858 woodblock version to avoid the confusion of "fish eyes with pearls."

The tenth chapter is of little importance, and the eleventh consists merely of the author’s speculations, neither warranting discussion. The two appended texts are included for reference only. The original edition also contained sixteen seven-character quatrains titled *Quick Methods for Women’s Orthodox Practice*, but as they merely reiterate the preceding content, they have been omitted.

**A Note to the Reader**
The study of immortality rests on four fundamental principles:
1. **Value substance over emptiness**;
2. **Focus on practice, not theory**;
3. **Prize the counterflow over the compliant**;
4. **Emphasize oral instructions over written texts**.

All authentic internal alchemy scriptures and Daoist works should be evaluated according to these principles to avoid delusion. This book, in its present form, adheres to these tenets: it speaks of *practice*, not theory, and advocates the *counterflow*, not compliance.

What has been transmitted here are *oral instructions*, not mere *text*. It conforms to the second, third, and fourth principles, yet the original has been recklessly altered by later hands. Terms like *maṇi dhāraṇī* have been misapplied, muddling the underlying principles, and the entire system of women’s practice has been rendered neither fish nor fowl—deviating from the very essence of the Dao of immortality and thus failing the first principle of valuing substance over emptiness. Therefore, all obvious interpolations have been excised to strip away the false and preserve the true. Men of wisdom in this world will surely concur.

**General Discussion**
At sixteen, a boy’s essence flows; when full, it spills. At fourteen, a girl’s menses begin; when full, they overflow. To prevent spillage or overflow, one must master wind and fire. Fire is the primordial spirit; wind is the true breath. Spirit and breath depend on each other, attained through contemplation. The method directs the gaze through the mysterious aperture of the eyes into the qi cavity, where qi enfolds the spirit, both gathered by intent. The natural interplay of wind and fire, ceaseless in motion, transmutes essence into qi, qi into spirit. When spirit is perfected and form transcended, a body exists beyond the body.

The oral instruction states:
*If spirit and breath ever attend each other,*
*The jade liquid flows, transforming the frame.*
*Only by gazing long into the cave of longevity*
*Is the yang spirit refined, emerging at the crown.*
*Know that all born things must die,*
*Yet grasp that the primordial spirit, though dead, revives.*
*If the heart’s spirit dwells within qi,*
*The infant is nurtured, and the work is complete.*

Those who cultivate thus need not fear the internal elixir will fail.

The method employs the *Chong*, *Ren*, and *Du* meridians, circulating through the outer, middle, and inner passes. Women’s practice differs slightly: it begins at the upper pass of the breast stream, proceeds to the middle pass within the navel, and culminates at the lower pass of the womb. The middle and lower passes are then merged into a single cavity. Men refine essence, called *Taiyang refining qi*; women refine blood, called *Taiyin refining form*.

The secret of fire and wind lies in balancing civil and martial. The martial resides in the center, while the civil operates from start to finish. The celestial revolution never strays from observation and cessation. Within a single day’s twelve hours, wherever intent arrives, practice may commence.

Those who attain the primordial qi and the postnatal qi live as if perpetually intoxicated.

Worldly women, deeply entrenched in habit, crave meat and fish, easily stirred by desire. Witnessing others marry, they harbor resentment; moved by spring, grieved by autumn, they invite weakness and illness. Overindulgence in cold foods exacerbates menstrual stagnation. Further tempted, they ruin both body and reputation, leaving lifelong regret. Let this be a warning: avoid karmic entanglements. Endurance brings peace; repentance brings joy. Intent should cradle fullness; the heart should mirror still water. Emulate the golden man: seal the mouth, conceal the tongue. In movement and stillness, preserve chastity and integrity. Shatter the passions, leap from the sea of desire. The heavenly water within the body is the wellspring of life. Urgently seek the method to refine and transform it into truth. With merit accumulated in the human realm, the spirit ascends to heaven. Cultivators, take heed and strive.

**Section One: Recognizing the Foundation and Purifying the Heart**
To recognize the foundation, first purify the heart. Let no dust cling, no illusions delude. With the heart empty and desires stilled, tranquility arises naturally—clear as a mirror, limpid as water. Once the heart is purified, seek to recognize the foundation.

A woman’s body is fundamentally *kun*: yin on the back, yang on the abdomen. The outer aperture is the breast orifice; the inner cavity is the breast stream. The sixth *chonglou* lies at six and a half divisions, opposite the outer gate of the tenth *chonglou*. Begin seated, legs crossed like a crane’s, knees locked. Secure the lower pass (the spring gate) to consolidate primordial qi. Activate the upper pass (the breast stream) to prevent leakage. The middle pass lies within the navel, one *cun* and three *fen* deep.

To avoid the five leakages, guard the three passes: ears turned inward to listen, eyes turned inward to see, mouth sealed to refrain from speech. Qi is drawn into the breast stream; spirit congeals in the golden chamber; nature settles in the sea of awareness; intent focuses on the elixir palace. Return to oneness through contemplation. The Golden Mother contemplates the heart; Laozi contemplates the aperture. Throughout the twelve hours, observe before emotions arise. The seven passions vanish; the five aggregates are originally empty. The heart remains free, vibrantly alive.

As our master Lü [Dongbin] taught: the source of Dao is in the Jade Clarity. Concentrate spirit in the qi cavity; direct intent from the eyes into the qi cavity. When primordial qi arrives, postnatal qi enters. Maintain this moment by moment.

For women, the upper elixir cavity is the breast stream. Behind the navel and before the kidneys lies the middle pass. The lower pass is the *pinhu* (womb gate); the womb is the great cauldron. All are accessed by guiding from the eyes into the breast stream, the navel, and the womb—one continuous channel. The primordial seed is the root of life.

A man’s primordial essence is the utmost yang qi; a woman’s true blood is the utmost yin essence. These are the treasures of life, the root of all transformations. Men store it in the *mingmen*; women store it in the *pinhu* (the womb). Once stirred, it is hard to retain. Only with a tranquil heart and the refining power of wind and fire can it be preserved.

**Section Two: Cultivating the Menses and Initiating Practice**
At fourteen, a girl’s menses begin, depleting her blood. Though the monthly flow regenerates, it also monthly drains. Those determined to cultivate the menses refine and transform it. Even after menopause, they can restore it. Avoid cold and raw foods to prevent blood stasis.

*(Chen Yingning’s note: This is a conventional belief, but one need not be rigid.)*

The menstrual blood is the root of life. The method of initiation seems active, yet it replenishes blood and qi, preventing further loss. Non-being arises from being; being culminates in non-being. Where effort is applied, postnatal qi flows; where intent is absent, primordial qi abounds. The eyes follow intent; spirit and breath depend on each other. Blood is transmuted into qi; qi is refined to nourish spirit.

Begin at the middle pass. Intent seems to exert force, drawing upward thirty-six times to the upper pass. Rotate thirty-six times on each side, then proceed to the breasts, rotating thirty-six times on each side. If the celestial valley is not warm, qi has not ascended; if the earthly spring is not warm, qi has not descended. Intent guides; the eyes focus on the upper and middle passes.

Cross the hands below the navel and above the spring. Intent seems to exert force, drawing upward thirty-six times to the breast stream, then to the inner cavity of the breast orifice, rotating thirty-six times on each side.

**Section Three: The Dragon-Severing Method**

The Dragon-Severing secret technique combines active and passive practice. At the *zi* (11 p.m.–1 a.m.) and *wu* (11 a.m.–1 p.m.) hours, sit as if straddling a crane. Tap the teeth seventy-two times to activate the *Feishu* (Lung Shu) point, employing postnatal intent. Breathe naturally through the nose thirty-six times, and the meridians throughout the body will open.

Press the heels firmly against the *quanfei* (Spring Gate). Cross the hands below the navel and above the spring. Intent seems to exert force, drawing upward thirty-six times to the upper pass. Rotate the intent and gaze thirty-six times on each side, then proceed to the middle pass, rotating intent and gaze thirty-six times on each side. Raise the hands toward the heavens, slowly thirty-six times, then swiftly thirty-six times. When the *weilu* (coccyx) suddenly stirs, clasp the hands at the waist, clench the jaw tightly, and raise the shoulders straight up. Squeeze the *jiaji* (double passes along the spine) so that the *Feishu* (Lung Shu) points are activated. Intent lifts the head and back straight upward to the *yuzhen* (Jade Pillow), connecting to the *niewan* (Mud Pillow). Press the lower lip tightly over the upper lip, and intent guides the true *qi* upward to the *niewan*, descending near the nostrils.

The tongue rests on the heavenly bridge, and sweet dew flows naturally. With a slight contraction of the nose, swallow the saliva as intent directs it downward to the navel. Place the hands over the *pin* (female gate), and intent seems to exert force, extending to the *zigong* (womb) thirty-six times. The sweet dew enters the cauldron, and warm *qi* spirals within. Press the heels firmly, and body and mind settle as the womb becomes tranquil.

Master Wei Yuanjun said: *"The treasure returns to the Northern Sea—calm and secure."*

---

**Section Four: Refining the Breasts to Restore Youth**

The breasts connect upward to the heart and lungs and descend to the *qi* sea. To refine the breasts to the form of a maiden’s, incorporate the Dragon-Severing method by guiding the sweet dew to the *jiangong* (Crimson Palace). Focus intent on both breasts, rotating thirty-six times on each side. Press the upper and lower lips together, clench the teeth, and close the nostrils, employing internal breathing.

Within the breasts, use the palms to knead each side seventy-two times—first slowly, then swiftly; first lightly, then with greater force. After one hundred days of practice, the breasts will take the shape of walnuts. The Immortal Fengxian’s breast-refining formula states:

*"Left sun, right moon—one yin, one yang.
Nasal breathing circulates the inner *gang*.
To return yin and yang to sun and moon,
Refine both palms with true fire."*

---

**Section Five: Stabilizing the Cauldron and Conceiving the Embryo**

In men, the lower, middle, and upper *dantian* serve as cauldrons. In women, the womb, the area within the navel, and the breast stream serve as cauldrons. The womb lies 1.3 *cun* below the lower *dantian*, 2.8 *cun* from the navel, and beneath the upper pass of the breast stream. The upper breast stream, the middle navel area, and the lower womb form the three positions, arranged from outer to inner, with practice moving from inner to outer. Men lack a womb, so the lower *dantian* serves as the great cauldron—thus the names are the same, but their referents differ.

Master Lü’s *Jinhua Collection* states: *"With both eyes returning light, focus intent evenly between them and direct it to the lower* dantian*."* After practicing the Dragon-Severing method, women should rest in stillness for a moment. Direct intent from between the eyes, returning light to the breast stream thirty-six times, then to the area within the navel, and finally to the lower *dantian* (the womb), thirty-six times each. Guide the water of the *huachi* (Flower Pool) to the upper cauldron, draw the fluids of the heart and lungs to the upper cauldron, and send the true gold from the sea to the upper cauldron. Then, intent seems to exert force, guiding it downward to the middle cauldron, and further to the great cauldron, spiraling eighteen times. Inner heat rises, the cauldron stabilizes, and the embryo congeals.

(Note by Yingning: The function of this passage remains unclear, and its meaning is likewise obscure. Beginners may find it difficult to practice accordingly.)

**Section Six: Self-Regulation of Embryonic Breathing**
To avoid the faults of windy, panting, coarse, or shallow respiration, nasal breathing must be regulated. When each breath returns to its root, embryonic breathing is achieved. As breath moves, the pulse stirs; when breath stills, the pulse halts.

Ancient texts state: *"Ingesting qi does not confer longevity; longevity requires the subjugation of qi."* When true breathing circulates, qi is naturally subdued. After practicing the Dragon-Severing method, rest in stillness for a while. With the seven emotions unarisen and stray thoughts stilled, press the feet against the *quanfei* (Spring Gate), enclose the lips over the teeth, and let intent follow the gaze to the space between heart and kidneys—three *cun* and eight *fen* apart. Rotate left and right for forty-nine breaths. Sweet dew will arise of itself; when swallowed, it is drawn upward, then directed to the navel, where qi congeals. With prolonged practice, embryonic breathing forms: exhalation and inhalation occur spontaneously, as does the upward drawing. Within the *pinhu* (Mystery Gate), opening and closing proceed naturally, warm as spring. The elixir then takes shape.

(Note by Yingning: The phenomena between regulated breathing and embryonic breathing are left unexplained. The claim that the heart and kidneys are three *cun* and eight *fen* apart is also unreliable.)

**Section Seven: Elixir Reversion and Embryo Formation**
For male practitioners, the River Chariot method involves the divine fire stilling the wind. Daily gathering refines the lesser medicine in the furnace. When qi is abundant and spirit whole, the greater medicine forms. The Five Dragons bear the sacred, merging with the natural. From the lower field, it ascends to the middle, augmenting qi and nourishing spirit, then to the upper field. First, it pierces the *dingmen* (Crown Gate). Jade fluid returns as the elixir, *tihu* (divine nectar) bathes the crown, and the yang spirit is refined—this is called immortality.

As for women’s jade fluid returning as the elixir: the Red Dragon transforms into the White Phoenix, filling the lower field as if with embryonic gestation. When practice is complete and qi transforms, the radiance of spirit becomes whole, piercing the Crown Gate. The yang spirit is refined, jade fluid returns as the elixir, and *tihu* bathes the crown. This does not depart from prior practice—one must listen to the subtle and wondrous sounds as if in the Kunlun Palace of the Queen Mother.

(Note by Yingning: The discussion of women’s practice is overly brief and insufficient as a method.)

**Section Eight: Refining and Transforming the Yang Spirit**

For men’s inner elixir: essence is transmuted to augment qi, and qi is refined into spirit. For women’s inner elixir: blood is transmuted to augment qi, and qi is refined into spirit. Both employ fire and wind. In women’s practice, severing the Dragon lies in transforming blood into qi. It is also said: regulate the breath to transform qi into spirit. If qi is not refined, spirit remains insufficient, and form does not coalesce—this yields only yin spirit, not yang spirit. The method begins with entering stillness, applying the Six-Character Formula, and moving intention with the Three-Word Seal. Starting from within the navel, abide in the Central Elixir Field, rotating left and right thirty-six times each while directing intention with the character *lan*. For the Liver Palace in the east, rotate left and right thirty-six times each while directing intention with the character *luo*. For the Heart Palace in the south, rotate left and right thirty-six times each while directing intention with the character *bo*. For the Lung Palace in the west, rotate left and right thirty-six times each while directing intention with the character *dai*. For the Kidney Palace in the north, rotate left and right thirty-six times each while directing intention with the character *tai*. Ascend to the Mud Pill Palace, rotating left and right thirty-six times each, with intention centered. The hun, shen, po, and qi are gathered at the crown, refined and transformed into yang. Yin resides in the great cauldron; stillness guards the embryo. Then, move intention with the Three-Word Seal through the Central Pass nine times. When practice is complete, yin ascends and yang descends, uniting in the Central Cauldron. Radiance fills the Crown Gate, and one becomes like the Queen Mother seated in the Kunlun Palace, listening to the wondrous, stringless music in the void.

**Section Nine: The Yang Spirit’s Radiance Becomes Whole**

When jade fluid returns as the elixir, the yang spirit is not yet pure. When the Red Water obtains the Pearl, the yang spirit’s radiance becomes whole—like the Queen Mother seated in the Kunlun Palace, listening to the wondrous, stringless music in the void. The heart is the Vermilion Bird, soaring through the sky and descending in utmost sincerity. The root of intention returns to its origin; the six roots are liberated, and spirit becomes naturally luminous. The kidneys resemble the *wangxiang*, revolving to obtain the precious pearl, which is offered before one. Radiance envelops the ten directions. When heart and kidneys unite, spirit and qi naturally merge, forming the true seed and nurturing the sacred embryo. The Purple Chamber seals it away, for the liver’s nature is benevolence. The White Parrot dances, for the lung’s disposition is righteousness. Metal and wood intermingle, and nature and disposition harmonize. The tiger is subdued and the dragon descends; water and fire balance. The pure precious vase symbolizes the lung’s fluid; the willow branch symbolizes the liver’s tail. The fluid of the Flowery Pond is like sweet dew. Atop the Mud Pill Palace, one sits steadfast upon Kunlun. The method employs firmness: move intention with the Three-Word Seal into the true breath’s abode—the great cauldron. The millet-like pearl flies and revolves, entering the navel. The mouth seems to chant, *bu bu xi lie*, with undivided focus. In all worlds, concentration and wisdom become perfectly interpenetrating. Though the Southern Sea’s waves surge, when original yang qi is full, the spirit-fire’s radiance becomes whole. The great medicine surges through the passes, yet I remain ever pure and ever still. The heart is settled, intention is clear—profound stillness alone. This great method, this wondrous and true mechanism, surpasses the Dragon-Severing practice in excellence. After nine revolutions, the Seven Returns are achieved. The work returns to the navel, the yang spirit appears at the crown, and precious radiance ascends. Form and spirit are both wondrous; merit and virtue are complete. The Jade Edict descends.

**Section Ten: Nurturing and Facing the Origin**

When the great cauldron is settled, the great medicine obtained, the sacred embryo formed, and the yang spirit manifested, it must still be nurtured—nursed for three years, faced in wall-sitting for nine. The breath is continuous, intention undivided. Spirit and breath attend each other. For three thousand days, guard it as one would a newborn child, never forgetting this for even a moment. No need for distraction: the two eyes lower their lids, light following intention inward. The deeper the stillness, the more profound the entry. Qi is warm as spring; sweet dew arises frequently. Qi circulates throughout the body, beginning in the Palace of Childbirth, then ascending and descending. The River Chariot turns of itself, transforming the mortal frame into my true form. In men’s Facing the Origin, white light pierces the crown, followed by black, then blue, then red, then gold. In women’s Facing the Origin, black light pierces the crown, followed by red, then white, then blue, then gold. When practice is complete and radiance is whole, the five lights merge into one. The earthly thunder rumbles of itself; the Heavenly Gate opens of itself. When the yang spirit emerges, it emerges and returns—first near, then far. Do not become deluded. At this juncture, one must be even more cautious.

**Section Eleven: Merit Complete, Transcending the Mortal**

When the yang spirit comes and goes freely and the true self roams at will, one may remain in the mortal realm to broadly establish merit and virtue. When virtue is deep and conditions mature, a true teacher will come to guide one. One is led to audience with the Supreme Emperor, then to pay homage to the various heavens, and finally to the Jasper Pool to present oneself before the Golden Mother. One is appointed as an immortal—this is transcending the mortal.

**Appendix:**
1. First, treat channel illnesses.

For ailments before and after childbirth, menstrual blockages, and resulting illnesses, apply the method of rubbing the waist thirty-six times, alternating left and right. For the shoulders, perform thirty-six upward and downward motions on each side, alternating left and right. Additionally, massage the navel and center, crossing the hands to rub one hundred forty-four times each until internal heat arises and ceases.

For flooding and spotting, add the "Inverted Tiger" technique to the previous methods: suspend a horizontal beam in the air, hang upside down by both feet like a golden hook, and press the fingers into the ground. Focus the mind below the navel, rotating left and right one hundred twenty times. Perform this daily at midnight and noon to also treat menstrual blockages, blood stasis, and blood accumulations.

To the previous methods, add the "Sequential Hook of the Golden Turtle": suspend a horizontal beam in the air, clasp the palms and hang downward, toes touching the ground. Lower the eyelids like a curtain, bow the head to observe the heart, and perform thirty-six repetitions. Let the mind follow the gaze to six-tenths below the navel for thirty-six repetitions, then direct the gaze to the afflicted area for another thirty-six. For all such ailments, apply these principles accordingly.

The secret use of the mind’s true fire to treat illness is the esoteric healing method of Immortal Wei Yuanjun, Cui Fengsun, and the "Hemp Ball, Fish, Glare, and Turtle" technique.

**Two: Restoring the Menstrual Flow After Cessation**
When the monthly flow has ceased, first restore it. Within the "Dragon-Sealing Method," direct the intention upward, then shift to outward projection. Rotate left and right, then change to rubbing motions. After one hundred days, the menses will return. Three days thereafter, resume the previous method. After one hundred days of practice, the flow will cease permanently.

**Four Principles of Female Practice**
*Inscription of the True Character*

**Inscription of Stillness**

At birth, humans embody stillness, the undifferentiated Great Ultimate. Mind, destiny, nature, and emotions are as yet undivided. Later, the postnatal takes precedence, and principle and desire stand side by side. When desire overcomes principle, peril follows; when principle overcomes desire, desire wanes. Eliminate desire to preserve principle, and the spirit-terrace remains pure. The sages’ method of the heart is to cleanse the mind and embrace tranquility. Like polishing a mirror to remove grime, like facing a wall in meditation, the five aggregates dissolve into emptiness, and the ten thousand conditions settle into stillness. Without seeing, without hearing, the true nature sprouts. Cultivate this embryo, and the study of longevity begins. Women, in particular, align with stillness and contraction. Abiding in stillness and preserving sincerity, they stand alongside immortals and buddhas.

**Inscription of Purity**

Sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas—all maintain perfect sincerity from beginning to end. The Dao of Heaven flows unimpeded. The thoughts of ordinary people are杂 and impure; even if they briefly cease, the supreme Dao does not coalesce. As the sun and moon shine long, as the four seasons endure, so too must the cultivation of the Dao and nurturing of nature persist without end. In haste or turmoil, not a moment departs from benevolence. Unceasing and enduring, sever the seven emotions. Through deep familiarity, the marvelous arises; radiance and brilliance follow. The slightest lapse, and the study cannot succeed. Only through unwavering purity is the heart of the Dao preserved. Women of affinity, let none shame their lives.

**Inscription of Oneness**

The Dao is not distant from humanity; humanity distances itself from the Dao. With a virtue divided, no success is possible. All things are thus—how much more so the mysterious and wondrous? Focus on one without distraction, and grasp the essential. Do not stray into side paths, do not enter heterodox teachings. The non-dual Dharma gate reveals its secrets. The Great Void is undifferentiated, empty yet with subtle signs. Firmly guard the inch of the heart, silently observe the mysteries of the elixir. Women, do not abandon or neglect yourselves. Within, nature and destiny; without, integrity and conduct. With one heart and one virtue, you will attain profound mastery. The fruit of the Dao will be perfectly luminous, and the ranks of immortality may be reached.

**Compendium of Elixir Secrets**

*The Awakening Path of Kun* states: Before cultivating this Dao, first uphold the five precepts.
1. Do not kill—this is benevolence.
2. Do not steal—this is righteousness.
3. Do not engage in illicit sex—this is propriety.
4. Do not consume alcohol or meat—this is wisdom.
5. Do not speak falsely—this is trustworthiness.

Having upheld the five precepts, next eliminate the six desires: the eyes do not gaze wantonly, the ears do not listen wantonly, the nose does not smell wantonly, the tongue does not speak wantonly, the body does not move wantonly. With the six desires eliminated, how can the seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, aversion, and desire—remain? Once the seven emotions are gone, then enter the chamber and begin practice.

*The Scripture of Kun’s Peace* says: "Without true refining of the self, all efforts are difficult to commence." It also says: "First cut off desire and forget emotions, then enter the chamber to sit in meditation. The refining of the self is the same as for men; regulate the breath so it is continuous and unbroken." It further states: "The four great elements of the body converge at the spirit-terrace of the Central Palace. The two qi intermingle, the Yellow Court responds to the Mysterious, and the five phases generate one another—only Earth is complete."

It also says: "A trace of dawn’s moon appears in the eastern sky, seeking the origin of the unborn body." This is like building a house, where opening the entrance comes first; it is like firing a furnace, where kindling the flame is the method.

*The Discernment of Cultivating the Dao* states: "For men, the essential practice is refining qi, called ‘Yang Refining Qi.’ When qi is refined and returns, the White Tiger descends, transforming into a youthful body. Then the postnatal essence does not leak, longevity is possible, and the elixir may be formed. For women, the essential practice is refining form, called ‘Yin Refining Form.’ When form is refined and vanishes, the Red Dragon is severed, transforming into a male body. Then the impure yin blood no longer descends, transcending death and entering life. Thereafter, cultivate using the men’s method, and the great elixir may be attained in a year." Yet there are also secrets, timings, and methods.

*The Three Lives Mirror of the Sacred Medicine* says: "The human navel is called the ‘Gate of Destiny.’ Above it is the Primordial Pass, within it is the Yellow Court, and below it is the Sea of Qi."

Lazy Daoist says: "Women have three destinies: upper, middle, and lower. The upper is the Yang Cavity, the middle is the Yellow Chamber, and the lower is the Cinnabar Field. In youth, begin with the lower; in decline, proceed from the middle; only when accomplished, turn to the upper."

*The Discernment of Cultivating the Dao* says: "A man’s destiny lies in the Cinnabar Field; a woman’s destiny lies in the breasts." The breasts are the source of blood, located one inch and two fen within the center—not the two breasts. Women take blood as their kidneys, which is an empty cavity. The blood source generates blood, the Cinnabar Field generates the elixir. The practice occurs at the zi and wu hours: focus the mind on the empty cavity of the breasts, breathe continuously, exhaling less and inhaling more. When the monthly signal arrives, guide it from the Cinnabar Field upward to the breasts. Some say that when the signal arrives, it is like the living zi hour for men. This is what *The Scripture of Kun’s Peace* calls: "At dawn’s sunrise, a trace of light appears. Circulate mercury to match lead, and both spirit and qi abide." Accumulating qi originates from the land of generative qi; storing spirit is the path of refining spirit. When the Yang stirs, practice the work of zi, wu, mao, and you. When the hundred vessels are open, stabilize the positions of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li.

However, the monthly signal is not the arrival of the menses. *The Three Lives Mirror* says: "It is like a person away from home whose letter arrives first."

When the signal arrives, she will know it herself. Sometimes there is pain in the waist and legs, or discomfort in the head and eyes, with no desire for food—this is the signal arriving, about to transform into blood, and it is *qi*. She should focus her efforts two and a half days *before* this. If the menses flow, the Red Dragon’s yin essence cannot be controlled; reckless circulation will harm many, so she must wait two and a half days after the menses end. Test with white silk: if it turns golden yellow, this is the sign that the menses have ceased. Then proceed as before, circulating upward to sever it. After several months, the menses will turn yellow, yellow will turn white, and white will vanish entirely—this is the Dao of returning from existence to non-existence. If she is past forty-nine and her waist is dry with blood exhausted, there is no life left, but with prolonged nurturing, blood and primal essence will regenerate, and she will resemble a maiden once more—this is the marvel of generating existence from non-existence. When she sees it present, sever it at once, and life will be renewed.

The Lazy Daoist also said: "With long practice of inward reflection and breath regulation, true breathing naturally arises, opening and closing. Nurturing the *yinqie* (yin barrier), spirit and *qi* become abundant, true Yang flourishes, the menstrual flow ceases, and the breasts shrink like a man’s—this is called severing the Red Dragon." After this, the seven-day great return and great cycle proceed without distinction between men and women.

**Discerning the Living Zi Hour**
Heaven and Earth generate beings through *yinyun* (intermingling) and joyful nurturance—this is true for all things, so how are men and women different? This is the natural principle of creation, the Dao of non-thought and non-action. Moreover, the *Dan Jing* (Alchemical Scriptures) clearly state: "For women, blood serves as the kidneys." The *Inner Canon* also says: "At eight, a boy’s kidney *qi* is full, his hair grows and teeth change; at seven, a girl’s kidney *qi* flourishes, her teeth change and hair grows." Clearly, both men and women have kidneys—why would their *zi* hours differ?

Further, examining texts on conception: Inside a woman’s yin is a lotus-bud shape called the "uterus." Each month, after the menses, regardless of the day, there is a time of *yinyun* and joyful nurturance—*qi* steams and grows hot, she feels drowsy and stifled, subtle movement stirs in her meridians, and the lotus bud shows a desire to open. At this moment, life’s vitality surges. If used in accord, it can conceive a child; here, it is used in reversal. How can there be doubt about the living *zi* hour? Yet without a pure body and mind, it is difficult to perceive and comprehend—this depends on the practitioner’s spiritual insight.

**On the Living Zi Hour in Women’s Alchemy**
The living *zi* hour for men is recorded in alchemical scriptures, but for women, the ancients did not speak of it. However, the *Yi Jing* says: "Heaven and Earth intermingle, and the myriad things transform into harmony; male and female unite their essences, and the myriad things come to life." The *Book of Rites* states: "Food and sex are humanity’s greatest desires." Generally, the movements and stillness of Qian and Kun depend entirely on the mechanism of opening and closing—there is no difference between the two. Observing animals: sows, cows, and ewes, when in their time of *yinyun* and joyful nurturance, invariably cry out loudly, compelled by the moment. Heaven generates beings, and humans are the most intelligent—surely they too have this moment. The living *zi* hour arrives, but humans, more refined than animals, endure it in silence.

The people may be made to follow it (procreation), which is the natural course, but not to know it (reversal), which is the alchemical path. Practitioners observe the waxing and waning of the moon, reflect inward to cultivate virtue, and stabilize their practice in stillness. Gathering primordial true *qi* and preventing its transformation into blood—this is the moment to begin severing the Red Dragon.

**Distinguishing Differences in Men’s and Women’s Alchemy**

**Editorial Principles of *A Compendium of Women’s Daoist Learning***
1. Select ancient and modern exemplary conduct and wise sayings, along with concise writings from women, to cultivate lofty character and instill exceptional intelligence—this pertains to the psychological aspect.
2. Carefully choose methods of cultivation, scriptures, and poetry from women throughout history to foster extraordinary talent in women and develop robust, graceful physiques—this pertains to the physiological aspect.
3. Daoist learning is the quintessence of the Chinese nation, unique to our country and absent in others. Previously, due to limited women’s education, this transcendent knowledge could not be studied. Now, following the principle of gender equality, this learning is gradually being made public.
4. Ancient writings vary in depth; some are profoundly abstruse and difficult to understand, while others are overly vulgar and unrefined. To ensure accessibility, abstruse texts are annotated for clarity, and vulgar ones are slightly refined to avoid offending refined sensibilities.
5. The purpose of this compilation is to promote China’s indigenous Daoist learning while absolutely rejecting superstition. Any text tainted with superstition is excluded.

**Reader’s Note**
This book was written in the *guimao* year of the Guangxu reign, eight years before the founding of the Republic.

2. The author was a woman who remained unmarried all her life, devotedly serving her mother with filial piety. Her mother observed widow’s chastity, and the daughter preserved her maidenly purity. Both mother and daughter were devoted to the Dao, yet lacking a teacher, they could only search through various Daoist texts for oral instructions. At her mother’s behest, the author compiled this book, which consists entirely of excerpts from other alchemical classics rather than her own compositions.

3. The excerpted texts vary in quality; some are sound, while others are not. Thus, their theories occasionally contradict one another, and their prose is often verbose. Though some revisions have been made, the original intent has been preserved as much as possible. Scholars should use their own discernment when studying these passages.

4. Terms in this book such as "Ancient Perfumed Mother," "Supreme Emperor of the Dark Heavens," "Golden Portal Emperor Lord," "Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool," and "Luminous Dao Matriarch" are all borrowed names from other texts. In this age of dispelling superstition, such appellations ought not to be used, yet they remain unchanged here as they appear in the original sources.

5. The book states that a woman’s alchemical attainment requires awaiting deliverance, a theory that is far from satisfactory. This stems from the old custom of valuing men over women. Most religious systems worldwide have historically denied gender equality—not just in China. Only through the emergence of exceptional women can such conventions be broken.

6. In one passage attributed to the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, he argues: *"Some claim that without severing the Red Dragon, the elixir cannot form and the Dao cannot be realized. Yet if the blood is exhausted, so too is the qi. Just as a man’s essence decays and his elixir becomes difficult to refine, the principle is the same. For men, essence, and for women, blood, must not be entirely cut off. Qi arises from blood, and when blood transforms into qi, essence flows freely. If blood must be drained to refine the elixir, why do young women with blood depletion fall ill instead? This is clear evidence that blood cannot be forsaken."*

Now, to clarify: "Severing the Red Dragon" refers to the practice of refining and halting menstruation through cultivation, not to blood depletion in women. To equate severing the Red Dragon with blood cessation, exhaustion, or desiccation would be to mistake it for the pathology of consumptive blood stasis. If a woman truly suffered from such a condition, she would require special methods—both meditative and medicinal—to restore her menstrual cycle to its natural, healthy rhythm before gradually refining and halting it according to the oral instructions for severing the Dragon. This gentleman’s conflation of the effects of severing the Red Dragon with consumptive blood stasis is a grave error.

7. The differences in initial methods of cultivation for men and women arise from physiological distinctions. If a woman wishes to enter the Dao, she must first acquire a solid understanding of basic medical knowledge before undertaking practice. Otherwise, she risks following the wrong path. Among those who study immortality, none have succeeded without also studying medicine. This is a concrete principle, not mere abstract theory or lofty discourse on nature and mind.

8. Regardless of gender, those who lack the capacity to conceive mortal offspring will never achieve the formation of an immortal embryo. The principles of human birth and immortal transformation are fundamentally the same, differing only in whether one follows or reverses the natural course. Severing the Red Dragon is a reversal of creation’s flow. If one mistakenly believes that the cessation of menstruation alone leads to immortality, then women over fifty, whose menses naturally cease, would all possess the qualifications of immortals. If one argues that the elderly are an exception, what of modern young women who undergo surgical removal of the uterus or ovaries, causing their menstruation to cease naturally? Can this be considered severing the Red Dragon? Such matters demand careful scrutiny.

**Preface**

Ze Huan lost her father in youth, leaving her mother to uphold chastity without an heir, with only we three sisters beneath her care. Soon after, my second sister passed away, and my third sister was betrothed, awaiting marriage. Unwilling to bear my mother’s lonely widowhood, Ze Huan vowed to remain chaste and serve her, swearing never to marry. At the age of twelve, I began to observe vegetarian precepts alongside my mother, entertaining ourselves with the *Exhortations to Virtue* and its verses. I often admired the accounts of cultivation’s beauty and the nobility of immortals and buddhas in devotional texts, yet lamented the absence of an enlightened master to guide me in the secrets, nor any alchemical scriptures to verify my mind and body. Silently, I sought heavenly affinity for nearly a decade.

Then, in the summer of Gengzi during the upheaval in the capital, I accompanied my mother to seek refuge on Mount E, where I first learned of Buddhist texts on female cultivation: the *Sutra of Lady Moye*, the *Sutra of Matanga’s Daughter*, the *Sutra of the Daughter of Anathapindika*, the *Biographies of Bhikkhunis*, and the *Biographies of Virtuous Women*—a mere drop from the vast ocean. Later, I obtained the *Mani Candles for the Earthly Realm*, a collection of over seventy works compiled by Lady Rushan, a laywoman named Shanyi. However, the Buddhist canon is profound, emphasizing nature over destiny, and is not readily accessible to beginners.

As for Daoist texts on female elixir cultivation, they are often appended within the *Daoist Canon*, lacking order or dedicated volumes, like an endless sea—overwhelming and disorienting. Undeterred by my own inadequacy, I excerpted and compiled passages on female elixir cultivation, amassing over a hundred pages. I shared these with my mother to dispel her solitude and encourage our quiet practice. Beyond our filial joy, at my mother’s behest, I extracted the distinctions between male and female cultivation from my collection, transcribing them into a separate volume of over five thousand characters. Entitled *On the Distinctions Between Male and Female Elixir Work*, I placed it by my side to prevent confusion in practice, lest one incur strange illnesses or be ridiculed for superficial understanding. If such errors are inevitable, how could I dare presume to share this with fellow seekers?

Sun Yuanjun’s *Commentary on the Kun Formula* states:
The *Tuan* says: “Supreme is the Kun’s primal power—all things draw life from it.” Kun belongs to old yin; when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born. In following Heaven, it gives life to humans and creatures; in following the self, it completes the Dao and attains perfection.

Xiang Yi, the Ancient Mother, says:
In all cases, men’s cultivation begins with the initial work of refining and laying the foundation. For women, however, cultivation differs from that of men. In men, yang descends and is discharged; in women, yang ascends. Men’s bodies are firm; women’s bodies are soft. Men use the yang essence of the elixir field, constantly preserving it to prevent external leakage. When accumulated over time and refined with fire, essence transforms into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness. Progressing gradually, the work is completed, the Dao attained, and ascension achieved. Women, however, are different. Their bodies are inherently turbid yin, vessels of blood and fluid. They employ the numinous fat of the breasts to transform their temperament. Through prolonged refinement, the red naturally reverts to white, and blood transforms into qi. Once blood has become qi, fire talismans are used to further refine it, enabling qi to revert to pure yang, completing the Dao and returning to the true. In their initial work, women first refine the physical form, then the original essence. This is unlike men’s work, which first refines the original essence before refining the form. Their bodies differ, and thus their practices naturally diverge. Without distinguishing these paths and establishing separate teachings, how can the transformation of yin and yang be achieved, and men and women together attain completion?

Yet if the body is already one’s own, why refine it? Women’s bodies are originally turbid yin, unlike men’s, which inherently possess firm yang. Without refinement, blood cannot transform into qi, nor can the prenatal be conceived or true qi produced. Without true qi, one remains a mass of pure yin—how then can the returned elixir be obtained to accomplish the great Dao? Thus, a woman’s form must first be refined before further progress is possible.

The path of female immortals fundamentally differs from the work of men. Men’s path values the refinement of the medicine; thus, the earlier stages of practice are explained step by step. If diligently practiced day and night with sincere devotion, the blood of the five viscera within the body will all revert to qi, naturally effecting transformation. When true qi subtly arises, the turbid yin body is transmuted into pure yang. Only at this stage can fire talismans be employed, aligning the work with that of men. Without distinguishing these methods, how could the practice bear fruit? Therefore, men first refine the medicine, then the form; women first refine the form, then the medicine. Their bodies differ, so the sequence of their work also varies. In establishing teachings for others, I must clarify these distinctions so that learners may proceed without deficiency.

The principles of female elixir cultivation are not inherently complex, and their practice is not difficult. The reason most elixir classics do not transmit women’s cultivation is that they fail to address both men and women. In offering these teachings, I truly wish for the dual salvation of men and women. Thus, following the elixir texts, I append *Ten Principles of the Female Dao* to guide those of karmic affinity.

Why is the path of the female elixir so simple and uncluttered? Women’s nature is pure and whole; their bodies are tranquil and serene. With but a single practice, they can achieve thorough accomplishment. This is unlike men, whose thoughts are often wayward and partial, leading to differences in their aspirations and physical constitutions. Thus, women’s work is somewhat swifter than men’s. From nurturing the true to fetal breathing, two-thirds of the work is already achieved—unlike men, whose practice requires many additional steps to reach the stage of spirit regulation. Therefore, in female elixir texts, from nurturing the embryo to fetal breathing, once the work is complete, external practices are recorded next. Only when external practices are abundant may the stage of spirit regulation be refined.

Why must female immortals undergo a waiting period after completion? Their bodies, weak in blood, rely on internal refinement to become yang. Though the body may become yang, the congealed yin nature has not yet been fully refined. Thus, women’s practice lacks the final stage of emptying the void, preventing them from fully embodying the wondrous transformations of Heaven and Earth. This is why they cannot transcend the worldly realm—entirely due to the fragility of their physical form. Men, however, refine their bodies into indestructible vajra, and with the work of emptying the void complete, their spirit-light fills Heaven and Earth. Thus, without needing to wait, they may complete the Dao, attain perfection, and ascend to pay homage to the Supreme Emperor or wander at leisure in Penglai. Women are not so fortunate. After completing the female elixir, they must broadly perform meritorious deeds. Only when their merit is full, and the sages above take pity on them, will they petition the Supreme Emperor. Then, an imperial decree may be issued, a golden writ of selection bestowed, and the supreme Dao-fruit of humanity and Heaven attained. Otherwise, they will merely become solitary immortals.

Master Lü says:
“The refinement of the Great Yin’s form differs only slightly from men’s cultivation. The initial work begins with severing the Red Dragon. Thereafter, ten months of practice bring forth the yang spirit, shattering the void. The path of cultivation from then on is identical to men’s, with no distinction between them.”

The Daoist of Sui Mountain says:
“Once the Red Dragon is severed, the breasts naturally retract, becoming like a man’s. The true yin qi then transforms into true yang, and subsequent practice is no different from that of men. However, women belong to the tranquil body, and though the latter four stages share the same operations as men’s elixir work, their achievements are even swifter.”

Master Lü says:
“Men’s cultivation subdues the White Tiger; women’s cultivation severs the Red Dragon.”

The *Three Destinies Treatise* states:
“A man’s destiny lies in the elixir field—the elixir field is the true earth that gives birth to the elixir.”

A woman’s destiny lies in the breasts—the breasts are the essence of the mother’s qi, the wood spirit of nurturance.

It is also said: “Women take blood as their kidneys, which are hollow cavities. After forty-nine years, the waist dries and blood withers, leaving no vitality. Yet if nurtured long enough, the primordial blood revives, returning to a maiden’s state—this is the marvel of creating something from nothing. Once this something appears, a single severing transforms it, and life is reborn. From this point onward, the work of refining nature and life is identical to that of men.”

Master Lazy Daoist says: “Why are there three destinies for women? They are the upper, middle, and lower. The upper is the yang cavity, the middle is the Yellow Chamber, and the lower is the elixir field. In youth, one begins from the upper; in decline, from the middle; and only when mature does one proceed from the lower.

Moreover, women are inwardly yang and outwardly yin. First, one must sever the Red Dragon to preserve the integrity of the body, whereupon *kan* transforms into *qian*. Only then may one apply the methods of men’s practice, achieving success in a single year, for the golden elixir already resides within.”

The *Disputations on Cultivating the Real* poses a question: “How do the initial steps differ between men and women?”

The answer: “For men, the essential first step is refining qi; for women, it is refining form. Refining qi means subduing the qi, and subduing the qi requires its return. When qi returns, emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness becomes profound, root and life are restored, and the White Tiger is subdued. Refining form means concealing the form, and concealing the form requires its dissolution. When form dissolves, the Four Great Elements enter emptiness, the limbs decay and rot, and the Red Dragon is severed.

When a man subdues the White Tiger, he reverts to a youthful body, and the post-heaven essence no longer leaks, allowing the elixir to coalesce and years to be prolonged. When a woman severs the Red Dragon, she likewise reverts to a youthful body, and the impure yin blood no longer descends, allowing her to escape death and enter life. Thus, men’s practice is called ‘Greater Yang Refining Qi,’ while women’s practice is called ‘Greater Yin Refining Form.’”

Another question: “In refining form, do women not subdue qi?”

The answer: “Women are inherently yin, so their qi is easily subdued. Yet the Red Dragon is most harmful to the Dao, and this is where the emphasis lies. Thus, one begins by applying effort where it is most needed. Once the Red Dragon is severed, the qi naturally becomes docile—not like men, who are inherently yang and whose qi is difficult to subdue. For example, while a man may require three years to subdue qi, a woman can achieve it in one.

If a woman is truly a hero among her kind, receives her teacher’s oral instructions, and practices the Greater Yin Refining Form method, she may attain the Dao in three to five years, with less effort than a man. Yet such women are exceedingly rare. Only those whose fortitude surpasses a man’s by a hundredfold can succeed. Those equal to men in strength will never achieve it.”

Another question arises: "The Great Dao makes no distinction between male and female—why then are there differences in practice?"

The answer: "The Dao is the same, but its application differs. This is because men and women are endowed with different natures and distinct physical forms. Thus, though the Dao of cultivating life and destiny remains one, the methods of practice diverge considerably."

The Dark Heavenly Emperor declares: *The Book of Changes* states, "Qian is the father, Kun is the mother"—the principle of yin and yang is luminously evident. Only with heaven and earth do male and female come into being; thus, the Dao of yin and yang is self-evident, and it is clear that heaven and earth cannot be without them. Men receive the transformations of Qian and Kun to form their image, while women inherit the harmonious union of Qian and Kun to embody their form. All who possess these forms are imbued with the qi of Qian and Kun, standing together within the cosmos.

Now, in this era of compassionate salvation and shared effort to uphold the precious raft, men are taught through many methods—how could we neglect the Kun axis? Texts expounding the profound mysteries of male practice fill libraries, while those guiding women’s cultivation are few and far between. With deep sorrow, I speak of this alone.

A man’s body is pervaded by qi within essence, while a woman’s is suffused by qi within blood. When the *xiezi* is full, the lotus aperture is full; when the lotus aperture is full, the drawing and replenishing begin; and only then does the sweet dew descend. A man’s essence is abundant in qi, whereas a woman’s blood contains but a trace—hence the distinction: man is yang, woman is yin.

For those who cultivate this Dao, severing the seven emotions is fundamental, and cutting off the six desires comes first. Thus, the faintest qi in women often surpasses that of men. Why? A man’s heart is easily stirred, while a woman’s mind is somewhat still. Movement scatters qi, while stillness nurtures it. A man’s seven lotuses are easy to gather but hard to release; a woman’s seven lotuses are easy to release but hard to gather. If she remains unwavering in sincerity, within three to five years, the sweet dew will flow ceaselessly, and the seven lotuses will bloom perpetually. If blooming is effortless, how could gathering be difficult? The distinction between male and female is thus made clear.

Yet when texts speak of emptiness, void, mystery, subtlety, spirit, or transformation, these are the great commonalities shared by men and women. Men refer to their practice as "embryo," while women speak only of "breath," lest later generations misconstrue the term "embryo" and suffer false accusations. Moreover, when a man’s spirit departs, it must attain pure yang before the opportunity for shedding the husk arises, for yang contains yin within. A woman’s spirit departs differently: upon reaching the stage of the Three Yangs, she may transcend a hundred leagues; when she attains the union of the Pure and Aged Two Yangs, her departure is permanent, free from the risk of premature demise. For men, yang contains yin within, while women, yin contains yang within. In men, yin resides within, and yang without; in women, yin is without, and yang within. When yang prevails, all yin readily retreats.

I now spare no sacred truth, revealing this fully, solely in the earnest hope that many may swiftly realize their true aspiration."

The Golden Palace Emperor declares: "From a grand perspective, all meridians emerge from the formless Wuji. In finer detail, they belong to the formless and imageless, yet originally encompass all transformations. Both men and women share this supreme treasure, differing only in the two paths of blood and essence. A man’s essence ascends in reverse to become immortal, while a woman’s blood rises straight to the heart aperture—thus, each has their own method and illumination.

The male elixir transforms essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness. When emptiness reaches its utmost stillness, the elixir naturally forms. The female elixir transforms blood into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness. When emptiness becomes spontaneous, the elixir naturally coalesces.

Some claim that without severing the Red Dragon, the elixir cannot form and the Dao cannot be attained. Yet if blood is exhausted, qi is also exhausted—just as when a man’s essence decays, the elixir is difficult to complete. The principle is the same. For essence in men and blood in women must not be entirely cut off. Qi departs from blood, and without blood, qi has no source; blood transforms into qi, and only then does essence flow freely. If one claims to refine the elixir only after blood is spent, how then do young women with withered blood fall ill instead? This is final proof that blood cannot be abandoned."

The Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool says: "Women’s practice shares much with men’s, differing only in stages—the ground itself is not mysterious. All wondrous transformations are no different from those of men. You must awaken to this fully, for the texts hold the complete teaching, without error. Cultivate in seclusion, each according to your path."

The Venerable Perfected One of Perfect Illumination says: "Now I shall reveal the truth to spare you from suffering wrongful karmic entanglements. The paths of yin and yang are apportioned, yet for men and women, the essential node is one. Men possess this ancestral qi, distributed within essence and blood. Women’s ancestral qi converges, its yin aspect spoken of in relation to the Sea of Blood. Men have this yang barrier, its flow and reversal requiring no confusion. Women possess the Northern Sea’s terrain, its waves surging as if pressed by water.

The White Lotus Perfected One says: "The terrain of the Golden Elixir differs for men and women, yet the principle of yin and yang is truly the same. Purity of heart and restraint of desire are the root. To lay the foundation, first sever the Red Dragon."

The Master of No-Mind says: "Men’s essence-fluid is yang within yin; women’s essence-fluid is yin within yang. Swiftly seek a luminous teacher to have this revealed, and returning to youth in your native land shall be yours. If the Heavenly Heart of seven days may be restored, this is the supreme wondrous technique. Thereafter, the work aligns with that of men, yet each oral instruction must be imparted by the teacher."

Master Lü says: "In women’s cultivation, as with men, what is difficult to attain is immaculacy. Know that women’s desires exceed those of men. When the menstrual flow has ceased, the heart is like a lotus newly opened, riding the Heavenly rain and dew to bear its fruit. If a woman lacks a man, she is solitary yin. "

The Master of Integrity says: "The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women—all may achieve completion. Thus, when a man completes the Dao, he becomes a Perfected One; when a woman completes it, she becomes a Primordial Sovereign. From ancient times, elixir scriptures have described men’s cultivation in exhaustive detail, while women’s practice is seldom addressed. When it is mentioned, only a glimpse is offered—not out of disdain for women’s cultivation. The underlying assumption is that since human nature and life are the same, the work is identical: speak of men’s practice, and women’s work need not be elaborated. Yet they do not realize that men are yang externally and yin internally, while women are yin externally and yang internally. Their inherent natures differ, their forms are distinct, and though their nature and life are the same, their practice diverges greatly."

*The Discernment of Cultivating the Real* states: "For men, the essential starting point is refining qi; for women, it is refining form."

Master Xu says: "When a man completes his practice, he no longer leaks essence; when a woman completes hers, she no longer leaks menses."

Their initial barriers are entirely distinct. Yet in refining the self, obtaining the medicine, returning the elixir, nurturing the embryo, and projecting spirit, though the work aligns with men’s, the subtle sequences may still differ in significant ways. In the spring of the *renchen* year, a woman of the *kun* trigram came to inquire about the Dao. Drawing from my extensive reading of ancient texts, I verified what had been transmitted to her. Yet elixir scriptures state: "Works on women’s practice are rare, making it difficult to examine differences." Thus, undeterred by the transgression of revealing celestial secrets, I set forth in writing the points of convergence and divergence, step by step, to serve as a guide for those seeking the path. May those who study these words and grasp their meaning avoid mistaking fish eyes for pearls. If they deeply understand and diligently practice, they may attain the supreme and ultimate Dao, and at the assemblies of the Jasper Pool, they shall not find it difficult to join the male immortals in paying homage to Lord Wood and together worship the Golden Mother.

Heaven is yang, earth is yin; *qian* is firm, *kun* is yielding. Yin cannot grow without yang, nor yang generate without yin. When firmness and softness achieve harmony, water and fire attain mutual completion. Yin and yang must have their counterparts, and from this all beings are conceived. Thus, heaven and earth both bear the true primordial qi, and men and women each possess an indestructible body. *Qian* is called Great Generation, through which one may realize the Dao and awaken to truth; *kun* is called Vast Generation, through which one may likewise attain the rank of Primordial Sovereign. If one claims that the yin of *kun* cannot enter the immortal path, how then does the Queen Mother dwell eternally on Kunlun? Chang’e stole the elixir from the rafters and became the eternal Empress of the Moon Palace. The carefree reader of the *Zhuangzi* styled herself the Exiled Immortal of the Jasper Pool. The Luo River Goddess and the Wu Mountain Maidens have been renowned since antiquity; Purple Maiden and the Xiang River Consorts remain illustrious to this day. Their traces are recorded in historical texts and may be verified. How could one who embodies the virtue of *kun* be incapable?

Women’s destinies originally have three phases: purple, white, and yellow—unlike men’s. Youth belongs to the upper, decline to the middle, and completion to the lower. A single misstep at the critical juncture must be deeply understood.

The qi cavity is the origin of blood, which is the breasts. It lies one *cun* and three *fen* at the center—not the two breasts. Men’s destiny resides in the Cinnabar Field, thus the Lower Field is their qi cavity. Women’s destiny lies in the breasts, thus the breasts are their qi cavity. When yin reaches its extreme and transforms into yang, it converts from the qi cavity into yin blood and flows outward in form. Therefore, severing the Red Dragon must begin where yin arises, and through prolonged practice, the form will naturally recede. If one mistakenly identifies the qi cavity as the point one *cun* and three *fen* below a man’s navel, it is an error.

Master Xu says: "When a man completes his practice, he no longer leaks essence; when a woman completes hers, she no longer leaks menses." Women’s menses are the first sign of life’s inception. When menses return to qi, the breasts shrink like a man’s, and the menses naturally cease. For men, refining essence into qi causes the yin root to shrink like a child’s, and essence no longer leaks. Only when there is no leakage can life be extended.

It is also said: "When a woman’s practice reaches the point where menses no longer leak, her subsequent work on nature and life aligns closely with men’s, differing only in minor ways. The obstacle lies in the lack of someone to reveal the secrets!"

The path of the yielding differs from that of the firm, yet its success may be easier. The firm require three years to subdue qi, while the yielding may achieve this in one year, for the elixir resides within their bodies.

The Primordial Sovereign Sun Bu’er says:
"Men and women arise from the same qi,
Yet differ in purity, turbidity, movement, and stillness.
If a woman wishes to cultivate the real,
She must gather her true primordial essence.
Within yin lies primordial yang—
Preserve its clarity and do not discard it.
Understand that form and desire
Are originally without encumbrance."

"Banish greed, wrath, and delusion; sever the bonds of care and anxiety.
Refine the turbid to cultivate a pure nature, and you shall not fall into evil destinies.
Abide in stillness and uphold non-action—
I, though a woman, possess the qualities of a man.
Without form in the realm of non-being,
Yet with intent in the realm of being.
Inwardly perceive form, sound, and emptiness,
Not a trace of attachment remains.
Rely on earth as the foundation of Kun,
For the one yang originally arises from the earth.
Lead and mercury may differ,
Yet qi and spirit share the same principle.
The subtle, empty, and numinous heart—
The heart-spirit can govern all.
When the one qi returns to spring harmony,
It soars beyond the clouds.
Together we wander in the Great Clarity,
This is called the gatha of true suchness.

The Way of Qian is movement; the Way of Kun is stillness.
To cultivate nature and life, one must begin with stillness.
You are originally still—why then seek to cultivate?
The Way of Kun is turbid; the Way of Qian is pure.
To cultivate nature and life, one must seek purity.
Only by refining the turbid into purity
Can one enter the Dao and attain fruition.

The *Scripture of the Divine Embryo’s Longevity and Function* states:
'After success, men gather essence in the Gate of Origin,
While women’s wombs no longer conceive embryos.
Though desire stirs, it cannot contend with spirit.'
This is the true essence returning to spirit in the midst of embryo formation—
This is the Upper Clarity.

*Ten Principles of the Female Elixir*
Composed by the Ancient Buddha Qinglie of Huazang Mountain."

**Editorial Principles of *Women’s Daoist Studies: A Small Collection*
Compiled and Revised by Chen Yingning of Wanjiang**

1. To select exemplary conduct and edifying words from women of past and present, along with concise writings, that may cultivate lofty character and impart exceptional wisdom in women—this pertains to the psychological aspect.
2. To select methods of cultivation, scriptures, treatises, and poems from women of past dynasties that may foster extraordinary talent in women and develop robust, graceful physiques—this pertains to the physiological aspect.
3. Daoist studies are the quintessence of the Chinese nation, unique to our country and absent among all others. Formerly, as women’s education was not yet widespread, this transcendent discipline remained unstudied. Now, in accordance with the principle of equality between men and women, such knowledge shall gradually be made public.
4. Ancient writings vary in depth; some are profoundly abstruse and difficult to comprehend, while others are overly vulgar and uninspiring. For the sake of accessibility, abstruse passages must be annotated to ensure clarity, and vulgar ones refined to avoid offending refined sensibilities.
5. The purpose of this compilation is to promote China’s indigenous Daoist tradition while utterly rejecting superstition. Any text even slightly tainted by superstition shall not be included.

**Notes to the Reader**
1. This book bears no author’s name, and the traditional attribution to "Ancient Mother Xiangyi of Jinhua Mountain" is crude and shallow. Though the author may not wish to use their real name, why fabricate a sacred title? Thus, it has been omitted.
2. Though the book is titled *Ten Principles*, the fifth and sixth principles largely overlap in content, and the tenth is excessively vague, rendering it unnecessary as a separate entry. These three have therefore been substantially abridged to spare the reader tedium. Other principles have also been edited or revised. Comparing the original with this edition will reveal the necessity of such changes—this is no idle revision.
3. Beyond the main text, readers should pay close attention to the appended annotations. These commentaries are the fruit of decades of experience and are not mere casual remarks, as in the writings of others, which lack substance or evidence.
4. The appended *Kun Formula*, though not definitively attributable to Sun Buer, is written in a concise and admirable style. The annotations by Fu Jinquan, however, are regrettably filled with metaphorical language, which may prove difficult for scholars to grasp. The origins of the terms "Yellow Sprout" and "White Snow" at the end are explained in detail—readers should study them carefully.
5. Among all extant *Women’s Elixir Scriptures* containing true methods, only twenty-odd have been found throughout the country from ancient times to the present. Scholars must read them all to grasp the essentials, then seek teachers and companions for practical cultivation—only then may success be hoped for. Beware of half-understanding and self-satisfaction.

**First Principle: Nurturing the True and Transforming Qi**

*(Yingning states: In Daoist practice, the value lies in oral instructions; the quality of the prose matters little. Thus, works with flawed theories, awkward phrasing, vulgar insights, or superstitious admixtures often invite disdain, causing even their authentic oral instructions to be buried and forgotten—most lamentable indeed. In compiling this book, I aim to guide women of above-average learning. Had I merely transcribed the original text, it might have drawn ridicule from the refined. Instead, I have distilled its essence, excised its flaws, and though it may not be entirely pure, it is now far more presentable than the original.)*

Women’s cultivation differs from men’s. In men, yang descends and dissipates; in women, yang ascends. Men’s bodies are firm; women’s are yielding. Men preserve the yang essence of the dantian, preventing its outward leakage. Over time, they refine it with the true fire within, transmuting essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—thus attaining the Dao. Women, being of yin constitution, must employ the spiritual marrow of the breasts to transform their temperament. Through prolonged refinement, the red naturally reverts to white, and blood transmutes into qi. Once blood has become qi, they too use the fire talisman to advance and retreat, enabling qi to revert to pure yang and return to the true.

Thus, women begin with refining the physical form before refining the original essence, unlike men, who first refine the original essence before refining the form.

What is "nurturing the true"? The human heart is easily swayed; if constrained within, it grows restless. Therefore, the initial step teaches the method of nurturing the true, naturally easing restlessness, harmonizing the four limbs, and enabling further progress.

In daily seated practice, one must mobilize the qi mechanism from the dantian and sea of blood, directing it toward the spirit chamber within the heart. A wisp of pure qi emerges from the sea of blood. With prolonged focus, the qi stirs and, following its dynamic impulse, soars upward to the niwan. It then descends again. At this moment, gently guide it with intention as it flows from the niwan down the *chonglou*. Here, one must not exert intent, lest the body be harmed. Simply follow the qi’s movement as it descends from the *chonglou* to the space between the breasts, where an empty cavity resides. After prolonged concentration, if movement arises, proceed as before. Within forty or fifty days, the qi will penetrate, blood will transmute into qi, and the red will revert to white. At this stage, the elixir origin is revealed, and the Dao-heart is sincere.

If one persists in tranquil abiding, unwavering day and night, and diligent practice, how can the great elixir fail to form, or the female immortal fail to manifest? This is the first step in women’s cultivation. If one attains its most profound and wondrous state, all subsequent practices will advance from this foundation.

Students, take heed.

*(Yingning notes: When the qi descends from the niwan, it is first said, "gently guide it with intention," and then, "do not exert intent." So, is intention to be used or not?)*

Is intention to be used or not? At this stage of movement, it lies between intention and non-intention. To follow its natural course, one says, "Do not exert intent." Yet it cannot be left unattended, hence one says, "Gently guide it with intention."

**Second: Nine Cycles of Refining the Form**
Refining the form means regulation and nurturance. Blood and fluids, belonging to yin and yang, congeal and reside below, stored in the Sea of Blood and the womb, transformed at the summit of the Five Aggregates Mountain. They irrigate the entire body, nourishing the hundred vessels, circulating without cease, overflowing through the meridians, and becoming dreg-like matter, discarded and unused. Only after two hundred and forty *ke* (twenty-four hours) have passed does the refined essence re-emerge, the primordial transform the form, and it is retained for the sustenance of life. This is what is meant by: the pure qi ascends to the breasts, while the turbid qi descends to become stagnation. The mechanism of human life and immortality truly diverges here. Thus, in women’s cultivation, one must first discern the pure from the turbid to refine the true form.

How is the form refined? While seated, employ the spirit’s mechanism to move. When the mouth is full of fluid, gently rinse several times, waiting until it clarifies. Then, inhale the pure qi through the nose, swallowing it along with the jade-like fluid, descending past the Towering Mansion into the Crimson Palace, then further down to the Yellow Chamber, halting at the Sea of Blood in the Pass Origin. Briefly stabilize it, then circulate it from the Sea of Blood to the Tailbone, ascending the Spine’s Ridge to penetrate the Crown Gate and enter the Niwan Palace. From there, descend again to the space between the breasts and pause. After a long gathering, the fluid transforms into qi—this is one cycle. Repeat this three times three cycles. Once complete, use both hands to rotate the breasts thirty-six times. Then, cup them and gently guide them to the center, halting at the Sea of Blood. Repeat the refining process as before. One round consists of three cycles; three rounds complete nine cycles.

If a woman is profound, composed, deeply rooted, and of substantial capacity, practicing thus for no more than a hundred days, her form will be refined, and the path to longevity will open. From here, further progress may be sought, and the great elixir will be within reach.

**Third: Applying the Fire and Talisman**
Men first refine the medicine, then the form. Women first refine the form, then the medicine. Due to the differences in their physical constitutions, the sequence of practice differs. Women cultivating the Dao should follow the preceding oral instructions with diligence. When, in the Sea of Blood within the Elixir Field, the qi mechanism warms, a wisp of pure qi will naturally surge upward to the Heart Chamber, reaching the breasts. At this moment, one must not stir a single thought. Continue the practice and circulation, allowing it to descend naturally back to the Sea of Blood. By this time, the qi mechanism has stirred, and true qi has arisen. The yin of red blood transforms into the yang of white qi. If the fire and talisman are not applied, the qi will revert to red blood, the white will turn red again, and all effort will be wasted.

At this stage, one must use true fire to refine it and true talisman to respond. When the talisman arrives and the fire is sufficient, the qi will congeal. At this moment of congealment, a distinct phenomenon arises. If not clearly explained, the application of fire and talisman may err, risking harm to the elixir origin. Cultivators must memorize this carefully and not forget. If this stage is mishandled, not only will prior efforts be wasted, but future practice will be difficult, and bodily harm—even the danger of blood collapse—may ensue. Students, take heed.

When the qi returns to the Sea of Blood, though it emerges from the blood, it is not blood itself. It is like a person who leaves home, changes appearance, and returns—even their family and wife may not recognize them, let alone restore the former intimacy. Thus, as it descends, the Sea of Blood must feel like a fish gulping water. At this time, the four limbs grow languid as if intoxicated, and the bliss is akin to the union of husband and wife, an ecstasy beyond restraint.

*(Yingning notes: Some say the bliss within the body at this moment surpasses that of sexual union manyfold. For certain women, naturally cold in temperament, or when paired with a physically weak man, may feel no pleasure at all. Yet women practicing the Dao differ: though alone, with a pure heart and few desires, seated in quietude, if they harmonize the yin and yang within themselves according to the method and enter the most profound and wondrous state, extraordinary phenomena will manifest. The bliss defies description. While men practicing quiet cultivation may sometimes experience blissful phenomena, compared to the degree of a woman’s bliss, they attain only twenty or thirty percent. This pertains to the physiological differences between men and women, not something that can be forced by human effort.)*

At this stage, one must firmly maintain control and not indulge. Focus the mind and stabilize it in the Central Palace. After a long gathering, it will naturally surge upward through the passes, ascend into the Niwan Palace, and transform into jade-like fluid. Guide it with intention down the Towering Mansion, halting between the breasts. Use the method of congealing qi to blend it, ensuring it gathers and does not scatter. With prolonged practice, one will naturally return to the origin and achieve fetal breathing. Once fetal breathing is attained, the Dao of immortality can be realized in due time. Women cultivators of the truth, take this to heart.

**Fourth: Silent Circulation of Fetal Breathing**
If women cultivators of the truth follow the preceding oral instructions with wholehearted dedication, true qi will arise daily, blood will transform into fluid, and from the space between the breasts, it will flow through the hundred vessels, moistening and nourishing the entire body.

This fluid, transformed from blood, must be constantly nurtured with the internal circulation of primordial harmonizing qi to warm and nourish it. Only then can it stabilize the Central Field, becoming the foundation for transcendence.

What is the internal circulation of primordial harmonizing qi? It arises from and settles within the center—breath born of the middle, returning to stillness in the middle.

For women cultivators of the truth who have attained the jade-like fluid, this qi must be employed to congeal it. Only thus will the fluid not dissipate, and only thus may it coalesce into the Reverted Elixir. During this internal circulation, the movement neither adheres to nor departs from the mouth and nose. Though it bears the name of breathing, it possesses no form of breathing. Why? It borrows the breath to fulfill the meaning of breathing.

For the breathing of mouth and nose is postnatal breathing, while the internal circulation is prenatal breathing. At this stage, emphasis is placed on the prenatal, not the postnatal. Prenatal breathing has a name but no form, and as it follows the postnatal breathing of mouth and nose—one exhalation, one inhalation—it naturally ascends and descends. With prolonged practice, each breath returns to the root, and the qi of breathing no longer depends on the mouth and nose. Once fetal breathing is achieved, the Dao of immortality is not far off.

The subtler intricacies and finer turns of this practice must be transmitted orally and demonstrated in person by one’s master. Moreover, the disciple must inwardly grasp and spiritually comprehend them, verifying them through direct experience within their own body. With deep and prolonged cultivation, the work will naturally come to fruition. Should one suddenly achieve a thorough and luminous penetration, they will spontaneously align with the profound mysteries of the Dao, no longer needing to cling rigidly to the written word.

**Fifth Principle: Broadening Meritorious Conduct**

If a woman can quietly cultivate the supreme Dao, having already refined the Jade Fluid and Returned Elixir, recognized her prenatal visage, and stabilized her fetal breathing practice, she must then rely on external conduct to nurture the root of the Dao. Only thus will she avoid deficiency in the outer while gaining support within. Therefore, in serving her parents-in-law, she should fulfill her filial devotion; in interacting with others, she ought to maintain sincerity and kindness. She should take pity on orphans and widows, relieve suffering and aid the poor, respect her teachers and elders, and foster harmony with her neighbors. Her movements should not be frivolous, her speech not arrogant. All her actions should conform to principle and propriety, naturally refining her qi and disposition into a state of harmonious equilibrium. Without seeking meritorious conduct, such conduct will establish itself.

The Sixth Principle: Resolute Commitment in Practice

Should a female cultivator of the Dao secure an enlightened master, grasp the oral instructions, cultivate her character, and pledge unwavering dedication to her practice with enduring perseverance, then the attainment of immortality may be realized in due course. Yet the nature of women is often fickle and mutable; when faced with adversity, one can scarcely guarantee that her original resolve will not falter. Some may be led astray by divergent paths, harboring wayward and biased views, thereby squandering all prior efforts and sinking into the abyss of karmic suffering—how lamentable this would be!

Though many in the world transmit the Dao, those who receive its true transmission are rare, and many err, leading others astray. Here, the oral instructions of the Female Elixir are revealed with clarity, to guide those of karmic affinity. May they leap from the sea of delusion and reach the other shore, ensuring that no jade-like souls are shattered in the Yellow Springs, and that the fair and rosy-cheeked may preserve their youthful countenance. By steadfastly upholding these teachings without loss, they shall enjoy boundless joy—how could this not be a cause for celebration?

The precepts are as follows:
1. Filial devotion to parents-in-law.
2. Uprightness and integrity.
3. Prudence in speech.
4. Carefulness in conduct.
5. Reverence for the master and the Dao.
6. Unwavering resolve.

**Seventh Rule: Cultivating the Original Spirit**
The practice of women is swifter than that of men. In the Female Elixir method, from nurturing the true to achieving fetal breathing, the greater part of the work is already complete—unlike the male path, which requires many additional steps to reach the stage of spirit regulation. Thus, once the work of nurturing the true and fetal breathing is finished, one proceeds to external cultivation. When external practice is abundant, the work of refining and regulating the spirit may begin. For by this time, the blood has already been transmuted into *qi*, and this *qi* can then be transformed into spirit. If, at this stage, one does not refine the temperament and supplement it with external practice, the spirit may fail to congeal, risking the loss of all prior effort. One must adhere strictly to the precepts, observe the methods with rigor, and polish the mind until it becomes like a block of crystal—refined and refined again, polished and polished again, until inner and outer are immaculate, transparent within and without, the form empty and free of the slightest dust. At this point, a luminous, transformative mechanism naturally arises, illuminating the cavity within. In deep meditation, one neither eats nor hungers, neither moves nor speaks. At this time, a guardian must be present to prevent startling disturbances, lest the spirit be harmed or demonic influences intrude, which would cause grave harm. Women who have reached this stage must remain vigilant, avoiding any misstep. Day and night, someone must watch over them. If their breath ceases entirely and their complexion remains unchanged—whether for a day or two, five or seven days, or even ten—do not disturb them. Wait until their breath returns faintly and their spiritual light begins to emerge before calling to them in a low voice. After emerging from meditation, let them eat, drink, and dress as they please. Companions of like aspiration must remain constantly attentive, guarding them until the spirit has fully departed the body, at which point the danger is past.

**Eighth Rule: Moving the Spirit Beyond the Shell**
The path of women is to return from yin to yang, and when yang is at its peak, the spirit is complete. Yet even when the body becomes like an ice-clear vessel and the spirit like autumn waters, the spirit must not be allowed to linger too long within. Thus, when the melon is ripe, it falls of itself; when the spirit is perfected, it naturally departs. At this time, one should employ the method of spirit projection, moving the spirit beyond the body. However, it must not be expelled too swiftly, nor should the initial excursions be overly prolonged, lest the spirit become lost and unable to return. The spirit should be drawn back into the body, moving in and out, beginning nearby and gradually extending farther. Take care not to act recklessly; only when the spirit is fully matured may it come and go freely. Once mastery is attained, there will be no fear. Yet the work of spirit projection requires further elaboration.

Before the yang spirit emerges, its nature is utterly still, and the practice remains governed by the rules of nurturing the true. This continues until the spirit is perfected. Once the yang spirit has emerged, its nature becomes dynamic, and the previous methods no longer suffice. One must then employ the method of freeing the spirit, allowing it to move with lively agility, unobstructed. Whether wandering mountains and rivers or manifesting in response to conditions, when opportunities arise, one should perform meritorious deeds. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, the day of ascension will naturally arrive.

**Ninth Rule: Awaiting Ascension by Grace**
When the Female Elixir is cultivated to completion and a body of pure yang is attained, one is unbound and moves freely. Yet one must widely perform virtuous deeds and plant many roots of goodness. One must not, in the freedom of spirit projection, neglect the fruition of the Dao, nor boast of the marvels of creation, lest one stray from the uprightness of heaven’s principle. Any reckless conduct will surely invite retribution. Instead, one should subtly employ spiritual power to protect the nation and save the people. When merit and practice are complete, high sages and perfected beings will naturally come to deliver one to ascension—ascending to the Golden Towers, receiving imperial decrees, and dwelling forever in the celestial palaces, enjoying boundless joy.

But why must female immortals await deliverance? It is because, though their weak constitution has been refined through internal practice into a yang body, the residual yin essence has not yet been fully dissolved. They lack the final stage of returning to emptiness and cannot fully embody the wondrous transformations of heaven and earth. Thus, they cannot transcend the world on their own, for their form is not yet indestructible. This differs from the male body, which, when refined into an indestructible vajra form and the work of returning to emptiness is complete, radiates spiritual light that fills heaven and earth. Thus, men need not await deliverance but may realize the Dao, ascend to the presence of the Supreme Emperor, and wander the immortal isles of Penglai.

*(Sakura’s note: I cannot endorse this theory. I record it here merely as it stands. If a woman truly possesses great wisdom, great power, and attains great liberation, then at the pinnacle of her practice, she may take a further step—where form and emptiness are nondual, self and other forgotten, and the luminosity of her original nature transcends the beginningless. Only then will she know that the mundane world and celestial palaces are equal in suffering and joy, that yin and yang, though named differently, emerge from the same source. The ten directions and three realms do not lie beyond the Gate of the Mysterious Female, and immortals, buddhas, and sentient beings alike all seek sustenance from the Mother. At this stage, what need is there to speak of awaiting ascension? "Emerge from the same source," "the Gate of the Mysterious Female," and "seek sustenance from the Mother" are phrases from Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*, each containing profound meaning.)*

The Tenth Principle: Attaining the Dao and Realizing Truth

What is most valued in cultivation is the transformation of the mortal frame into a sacred vessel. Without this, one remains like a frog at the bottom of a well—still a creature of the karmic sea, how could one escape the cycle of rebirth and transcend the turning of kalpas? If a woman in the world can maintain a heart unstained by even a speck of dust and a qi unbroken by a hundred setbacks, following her teacher’s oral instructions and practicing in seclusion day and night, she may attain the fruit of the supreme vehicle in merely three to five years. Why, then, would anyone shrink from such a path?

*(This passage has been largely revised, as it consisted of empty words.)*

**Appendix: The Kun Formula**
By Sun Bu’er, the Pure and Primordial Sovereign
Collated by Fu Jinquan, the Integrator of Unity

True transmission has its secrets—true transmission has its secrets.

Women embody the yielding virtue of *kun*, and within their true yin resides true yang, making their cultivation comparatively easier. The key lies in exerting effort within *you* ("being"). *You* is the origin of *wu* ("non-being"); from *you* to *wu* is the station of true yang. Though these two lines emphasize the work of *ming* (destiny), they unite both *xing* (nature) and *ming*, forming the foremost crucial point in the *kun* path.

The first line requires returning to *wu* within *you*; the second, generating *you* within *wu*. One must understand *geng* and *jia*—scholars of Confucianism expound upon this in detail.

*Geng* and *jia* clarify the entry point of *ming* cultivation.
*Geng* is metal, the tiger.
*Jia* is wood, the dragon.
*Geng*-metal is the foundation of cultivation, while *jia*-wood constantly fears its restraint. Yet within this restraint lies the germ of life. Alchemists delight in seeking vitality within death. Thus, when the *geng*-tiger descends, the *jia*-dragon rises—a descent and a rise, the mechanism of life and death is already latent, and the principle of inversion becomes ever more real.

When one knows this moment of life, death, and inversion, one applies the method to sever the dragon’s head and lead the tiger by its tail, ensuring the dragon does not summon clouds and the tiger does not stir winds. When wind and clouds subside, the sky clears and the moon shines bright; when dragon and tiger are subdued, nature and emotion harmonize. Returning to the furnace to refine, the millet-pearl is immediately formed—no method of preserving life surpasses this.

The word "know" implies quiet observation and vigilant guarding. When the wind is about to rise, one must seize the tiger; when rain is about to fall, one may sever the dragon—neither too soon nor too late, cutting at the opportune moment to refine. Without understanding this principle, one has no means to learn the Dao. Only by integrating it with the study of the classics can one avoid falling into emptiness.

To grasp the turning phrase beneath the *Doctrine of the Mean* is to perceive the Dao. The principles of governance must be studied, the nature-school thoroughly penetrated; one cultivates both nature and life, joining yin and yang. The alchemical Dao is contained within the *Book of Changes*, where the *Tuan* states: "Supreme is the origin of Kun! All things draw life from it." Kun belongs to old yin; when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born. Following heaven’s sequence, it gives birth to humans and creatures; following one’s own sequence, it completes the Dao and perfects the true. By closely examining where Kun’s true yang arises, one knows where the true unity of the self is produced. Seek this unity, secure this unity, and the treasure of life is whole.

The work of nature is the beginning and end of entering the Dao. Without penetrating nature, this treasure cannot abide; it must be like the autumn moon in serene meditation—spotless, without a speck of dust. Once the beginning of no-beginning is clearly understood, the non-empty emptiness all returns to spontaneity, and thus nature and life are dually cultivated, yin and yang joined.

Teach others to discern being and non-being with care, lest they waste a heart full of ardor. Yin and yang are precisely being and non-being; one must attend to the scriptures with diligence. In three days, the coming of true yang and the going of true yin will be as orderly as a well. The dragon’s head may be severed, the tiger’s tail retained; when the two qi intermingle in harmonious warmth, the dharma-body is formed. Otherwise, one merely exhausts heart and blood—how can refinement proceed?

The mechanism lies before you; qi is drawn forth from it. Above is the Celestial Valley, below the Spring Cavern. Fix your attention on these two places without the slightest deviation. At the critical moment, begin with the eyes to direct the intent, with intent to guide qi, with qi to congeal spirit, with spirit to refine the true. Thus one connects heaven and earth, and nothing is not efficacious.

If the Celestial Valley does not grow warm, qi does not ascend; if the Bubbling Spring does not grow warm, qi does not descend. One must focus the eyes and intent, directing force upward and downward to draw it. Fix attention on the two cavities without the slightest error. Practice at midnight and noon until fully mastered, then proceed to refinement. With timely insight and diligent cultivation, yellow sprouts and white snow will naturally appear.

*(Yingning’s note: "Yellow sprouts and white snow" are originally technical terms in external alchemy. Here they serve as metaphors for internal alchemy, prompting reflections I cannot suppress. Consulting the *Golden Elixir Secret Formula* of the Ancestor Fu Li, Chapter Seven: "Purple powder like frost, yellow sprouts fill the chamber." Xu the Perfected’s *Stone Casket Record*, in the "Purple Mother Treatise," states: "A cauldron of cinnabar may be ingested; long consumption reverses yang and changes the bones, reversing yang and changing bones to become an immortal. This requires divine talismans and white snow. Great indeed is the divine talisman, true white snow—reviving the soul and resurrecting Xu Jia." The *Stone Casket Record*’s "Luminous Chamber of the Spirit" further says: "Each grain a true red pearl, red blossoms and purple veins give birth to the Metal Duke. When Metal Duke, water, and earth unite, refined yellow sprouts become white snow. Purple sand and red powder drift about—drifting about, the Green Dragon’s ointment. When red powder is scarce and the White Tiger aged, refined dragon’s ointment and tiger’s brain become the wish-fulfilling jewel in the Hall of Longevity. To transmute ten thousand taels of gold is nothing—it can transmute the feeble old man to eternal youth."

Observe the above: red blossoms, purple veins, yellow sprouts, white snow, red powder, purple sand—these terms all refer to tangible substances produced in the external alchemical furnace. They possess real forms, visible to the eye, graspable by hand, and ingestible. Thus they are called the golden elixir. Later practitioners, failing to receive the true transmission—or even if they did, guarding it in secrecy—transformed the term, calling the undispersed union of essence, qi, and spirit in the human body the "golden elixir." Though this deviates from the ancient immortals’ methods, traces remain discernible. A second transformation later applied Buddhist terms like *tathata*, *perfect enlightenment*, *nirvana*, and *wondrous mind*, or Confucian terms like *wuji*, *taiji*, *heavenly principle*, and *innate knowledge*, indiscriminately attaching them to the "golden elixir." Thus later Dao-seekers fell into a fog, utterly bewildered—truly a descent into further obscurity.

The art of transmuting mercury into gold, once withheld by the Chinese, was lost and later discovered by foreigners. The elixir of immortality, which the Chinese dare not claim for themselves, may yet be seized by outsiders. For a nation with five thousand years of civilization and four hundred million enlightened people to forget its heritage and seek the Dao abroad—how grievous!)*

**Supplementary Q&A**

**Question from Miss Lü Bicheng, Answer by Mr. Chen Yingning:**

*The Ten Principles of Female Elixir* states: "The yang of women ascends from above." May I ask what is meant by "the yang of women," and how does it ascend?

**Answer:** What is called the yang of women refers to a kind of generative qi within the female body. "Ascends" means it rises to the two breasts. In maidenhood, the breasts remain unformed because this yang qi is inwardly gathered. After the age of ten or so, the breasts gradually develop. The cause of this transformation is the function of yang qi.

**Question:** How are the terms *fire* and *symbol* to be explained? What is their function?

**Answer:** Daoists have the terms "advancing yang fire" and "retreating yin symbol." The two words *fire* and *symbol* are abbreviations of these. For example, when a blacksmith forges iron, he first uses fierce fire to heat it until it glows red inside and out—this is "yang fire." Then he quenches the red-hot iron in cold water to harden it—this is "yin symbol." The human body operates on the same principle. As for their specific functions, they cannot be explained in a few words.

**Question:** What is meant by *form and substance*? What is meant by *original essence*? What is meant by *prior and posterior*?

**Answer:** *Form* refers to the two breasts, and *substance* refers to menstruation. *Original essence* refers to the "prenatal qi." In men’s practice, one first begins by gathering the prenatal qi, then seals the essence orifice to prevent any leakage. This is called "first refining the original essence, then refining form and substance." In women’s practice, one must first "sever the Red Dragon," waiting until the monthly flow ceases entirely and the breasts retract like those of a maiden. Only then does one gather the "prenatal qi" to congeal the inner elixir. This is called "first refining form and substance, then refining the original essence."

**Question:** How is the practice of "nurturing the true" performed?

**Answer:** The method for nurturing the true has already been explained in this text, namely the passage below that states: *"When sitting in daily practice, one must mobilize the qi mechanism from within the elixir field and sea of blood."*

**Question:** Where in the body are the *elixir field* and *sea of blood* located?

**Answer:** The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: *"The brain is the sea of marrow, the womb is the sea of blood, and the chest center is the sea of qi."* To know where the sea of blood is located, one must first understand what the womb is. The womb lies before the rectum and behind the bladder; in women, it is called the *uterus*, the place where conception and gestation occur.

**Question:** What is meant by *mobilizing the qi mechanism*? Is it like performing gentle calisthenics?

**Answer:** The *qi mechanism* does not refer to human strength but to the activating mechanism of the vital qi within the body. The term *mobilizing* means that the true intention and original spirit take charge—it is not a matter of moving the hands or feet. At this time, one remains in stillness while seated.

**Question:** What is the *spirit chamber within the heart*?

**Answer:** This refers to the *chest center*, the region between the membranes in the chest, which is the location of the pericardium.

**Question:** What is meant by *prolonged stabilization*?

**Answer:** When the heart is calm and the breath harmonized, spirit and qi coalesce—this is called *abiding*. Maintaining this state continuously, extending it for as long as possible without scattering the spirit or falling into torpor, is called *prolonged stabilization*.

**Question:** What is the *mud-pill palace*? What is the *heavy tower*?

**Answer:** The *mud-pill palace* (泥丸) is located at the crown of the head—it is the brain. The *heavy tower* (重楼) is the straight central pathway descending from the front of the chest, roughly corresponding to the medical conception of the *Chong* and *Ren* meridians.

**Question:** Where is the empty cavity between the two breasts, and what is its name?

**Answer:** The empty cavity between the two breasts is called *Shanzhong* (膻中) in medical texts. The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: *"Shanzhong is the sea of qi."* It also says: *"Shanzhong is the ministerial envoy, from which joy and happiness emerge."* And further: *"Shanzhong is the palace city of the heart’s ruler."* This region contains the diaphragm, which connects anteriorly to the *xiphoid process*, posteriorly to the spine, and laterally to the ribs. Above the diaphragm lie the heart and lungs. The heart stores spirit; the lungs store qi. If the heartbeat ceases, death follows immediately; if the breath of the lungs is cut off, death likewise ensues at once. Thus, the *Shanzhong* region is of paramount importance in the human body.

**Question:** What is the *Five Aggregates Mountain Peak*?

**Answer:** The term *Five Aggregates* (五蕴) originates in Buddhist scriptures, not Daoist discourse. The Five Aggregates are also called the Five *Skandhas*—namely, *form, sensation, perception, mental formations,* and *consciousness*. Here, however, the character *yun* (蕴) should be understood as *harmony*. It refers to the harmonious coalescence of the qi of the Five Phases. The *mountain peak* denotes the *Shanzhong* region, which lies above the *sea of blood* and is thus called the *peak*.

**Question:** The texts say, *"Blood and fluids transform into dreg-like matter, which departs and is not used."* How can it depart and not be used?

**Answer:** *"Departs and is not used"* refers to monthly menstruation. This is a natural process, not something contrived by human effort.

**Question:** Two hundred forty *ke* (刻漏) and thirty *shichen* (时辰) together equal how many hours?

**Answer:** Two hundred forty *ke* are equivalent to thirty *shichen*, for one *shichen* comprises eight *ke*. Thus, thirty *shichen* equal sixty hours.

**Question:** The texts speak of *"refining the essence to reveal it anew."* What is *refining the essence*?

**Answer:** The term *refining the essence* (熔华) does not appear in ancient Daoist texts. Its meaning refers to the period after menstruation concludes, when thirty *shichen* have passed and the vital qi in the womb is abundant. If one follows the human path, conception may occur; if one follows the immortal path, the foundation for elixir-cultivation may be established. *Rong* (熔) means *to dissolve*; *hua* (华) means *essence*.

**Question:** What is meant by *prior to Heaven*?

**Answer:** The concept of *prior to Heaven* (先天) requires study of the *Yi Jing*’s trigrams and images for proper understanding. Confucius said: *"That which is prior to Heaven—Heaven does not oppose it."* Laozi said: *"There is a thing, formlessly formed, born before Heaven and Earth."* And further: *"Vague! Elusive! Within it there is image. Elusive! Vague! Within it there is something. Dark! Obscure! Within it there is essence. Its essence is most real; within it there is sincerity."* These lines vividly depict the landscape of *prior to Heaven*. Master Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"Within the vague and elusive, seek the image;
Within the dark and obscure, find the true essence.
From here, being and non-being interpenetrate—
How can mere imagination ever grasp it?"*
This poem describes the scenery of *prior to Heaven*, which must be personally verified through practice to be understood. Without direct experience, idle speculation remains confusion.

**Question:** What is *pure*? What is *turbid*? How are they distinguished?

**Answer:** Qi is pure; blood is turbid. The pure ascends; the turbid descends. The pure is usable; the turbid is not. However, students must not misunderstand the statement that the turbid is unusable and thus allow it to depart without retention, failing to cherish or refine it. Know that turbid blood is transformed from pure qi—if too much turbid blood is lost each month, the pure qi will also become deficient. In superior practice, the pure qi ceases to transform into turbid blood, and menstruation naturally ceases. In middling practice, one refines pure qi from turbid blood, gradually reducing menstruation until it stops entirely. Not only must the red discharge vanish completely, but even the white must be absent—only then is there hope for success. Otherwise, one may only cultivate for a future life; dreams of attainment in this one are futile.

**Question:** The texts speak of "employing the divine mechanism to move, causing the mouth to fill with fluid." If one merely raises the tongue for a moment, the mouth will fill with saliva. Is this what is meant by employing the divine mechanism to move? It also says, "Draw in the pure qi with the nose." Is this "pure qi" simply the air of the external world?

**Answer:** In the teachings of internal alchemy, there are the concepts of "golden fluid" and "jade fluid." This practice resembles what the ancients called the "jade fluid river chariot." First, sit upright with the body aligned. Next, calm the mind and settle the breath. Then, regulate the breathing and concentrate the spirit. At this time, gaze at the tip of the nose, listen to the breath, and press the tongue against the upper palate (a technique known as "bridging the heavens") to await the generation of saliva in the mouth. When it fills slightly, swallow it. Then proceed according to the method of circulating the river chariot as described in the texts. If this can be done smoothly, it is best. If there are difficulties and one cannot follow the instructions precisely, one must devote careful study to the matter.

**Question:** Where are the "heart chamber," "yellow court," "Pass of Origin," and what is "jade fluid"?

**Answer:** The "heart chamber" refers to the region of the heart. The "yellow court" lies below the heart and above the navel, between the two. The "Pass of Origin" is located a little over two inches below the navel. "Jade fluid" is the sweet, cool, and clear saliva in the mouth.

**Question:** Where are the "coccyx," "spine’s midpoint," and "crown gate"?

**Answer:** The "coccyx" is the small final segment of the spinal column, where four bones fuse into one, directly above the anus. The "spine’s midpoint" is below the eleventh vertebra of the spine; acupuncturists call this point the "Spinal Center." The "crown gate" is the center of the top of the head, known to acupuncturists as the "Hundred Meetings" point.

**Question:** How does one ascend and descend—should it be allowed to occur naturally, or should one force it with effort?

**Answer:** The jade fluid river chariot is akin to the ancient art of *daoyin*. It is neither left entirely to nature nor forced by effort. Rather, one guides it with intention and moves it with spirit. The human spirit and intention can reach anywhere, thus allowing such subtle circulation.

**Question:** How can saliva transform into qi, and how does one know when saliva has become qi?

**Answer:** During proper practice, one will feel the body entirely unobstructed, the head and eyes clear and refreshed, a warm qi like fire rising within the abdomen, and the mouth producing fluid as clear as water, welling up continuously. These are the signs that saliva has transformed into qi. Beginners may not yet reach this stage, but there is no need for haste—such effects will gradually manifest with practice.

**Question:** The texts say: "Use both hands to revolve the two breasts thirty-six times, then cup them together at the center." The breasts are fixed in place—how can they be moved? Even if they could be moved, how would one revolve them? How can they be cupped to the center?

**Answer:** "Cupping to the center" means using both hands to hold the breasts, compressing them into a firm sphere rather than letting them sag like bags. The right breast is pressed toward the left, and the left toward the right, preventing them from inclining to either side. At this time, one’s spirit and intention should silently reside in the "Central Altar" between the breasts. "Revolving thirty-six times" means gently massaging the nipples and areolae thirty-six times with the hands—it does not mean shifting the base. The base is fixed and cannot change its position. This method is not used by those who have preserved their virginity.

**Question:** What are "refining the medicine," "refining the form," "true fire," and "true tally"?

**Answer:** First refine the form, then refine the medicine—this is what was previously meant by first refining the physical substance, then refining the original essence. "True fire" and "true tally" refer to the subtle workings of advancing yang fire and retreating yin tally. The circulation of yin and yang is profoundly subtle, and its applications are manifold. Not only is it difficult to describe in writing, but even verbal explanation may not fully convey it. One must read many Daoist texts, diligently practice, engage in real cultivation, and contemplate at all times to gain correct understanding. Once sudden comprehension dawns, it can only bring personal satisfaction, for it cannot be easily communicated to others. The principles of yin and yang are indeed mysterious and ineffable.

**Question:** What does it mean to "damage the cinnabar origin"? What is the "central palace"?

**Answer:** The cinnabar origin is the foundation of internal alchemy. To damage it means that the qi scatters and the blood rushes, destabilizing the foundation of the elixir. The "central palace" lies below the chest and above the navel—since this is not acupuncture, there is no need to locate the exact point.

**Question:** What is "rushing the passes"?

**Answer:** "Rushing the passes" refers to the moment when one’s true qi is full and spontaneously activates. Because the lower orifice is tightly sealed and cannot leak outward, the qi rushes into the "coccyx pass," penetrates the "spine’s midpoint pass," and ascends directly to the "jade pillow pass." This is a natural surge of abundant qi—there is a genuine, powerful warmth within the body, not an imagined or forced circulation. An ancient poem says:

*"The river chariot through the spine ascends the crown gate,
The swiftest path to immortality—none more revered.
From jade pool’s fluid, swallow again and again,
The Purple Palace’s sovereign soars straight upward.
Let qi surge through the joints unceasingly,
Naturally essence fills and the Valley Spirit abides.
Once the path to longevity is recognized,
Gratitude must be felt for those who first guided the way."*

This process knows no difference between ancient and modern times, nor any distinction between male and female—it is the universal formula for attaining immortality and returning to one’s original nature. Beyond this, there is no other path.

**Question:** What is meant by "condensing qi and merging"?
**Answer:** It refers to concentrating the spirit into the qi cavity, the principle of heart and breath interdependence.

**Question:** What is "embryonic breathing"? What is the "Central Field"?
**Answer:** "Embryonic breathing" means the nose ceases to exhale, like an infant in the mother’s womb, where nasal respiration is absent. The Central Field is the Middle Elixir Field, also called the Crimson Palace, which is the *shanzhong* (center of the chest).

**Question:** What does "jade fluid returning to the root" mean, and why must qi be condensed to prevent its loss?
**Answer:** "Jade fluid returning to the root" refers to the work of qi transformed from the Sea of Blood returning to the breasts. "Using qi to condense it" echoes the earlier principle of condensing qi and merging—essentially, the interdependence of heart and breath.

**Question:** What is "returning the elixir"?
**Answer:** "Returning" means restoring one’s original state—replenishing a depleted body and restoring lost primordial qi.

**Question:** What is "postnatal"?
**Answer:** All things with form are called "postnatal," as they arise after the existence of heaven and earth. This is the broad sense. In alchemical texts, "prenatal" and "postnatal" often carry a narrower meaning: the fetus in the womb is "prenatal," while after birth, it is "postnatal."

**Question:** What is the "breathing within the Central Palace"?
**Answer:** As Immortal Cao Wenyi’s *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source* states: *"When primordial harmony circulates internally, truth is realized; seeking breath externally never ends."* Zhuangzi says: *"The multitude breathe through the throat, but the perfected person breathes through the heels."* There is profound subtlety in this. Without having cultivated to this stage, no amount of explanation will bring clarity—only through direct practice and realization can one truly understand.

**Question:** What is meant by "each breath returning to the root"? Where is this "root" located?
**Answer:** One inhalation and one exhalation make a single breath. The root of the breath lies within the navel. When an infant is in the womb, its mouth and nose cannot breathe; it relies entirely on the umbilical cord connected to the placenta, which attaches to the mother’s uterus. The circulation of blood and qi flows between mother and child, allowing the infant to grow in the womb. If one wishes to return to the origin and restore the primordial state, one must trace back the path of one’s coming, returning to the state of chaos. Only then can one truly affirm, *"My life is determined by me, not by Heaven."*

**Question:** What does "slaying the Red Dragon" entail? Is it simply the cessation of menstruation?
**Answer:** It refers to refining and severing menstruation, not merely stopping it. Ordinary women may occasionally cease menstruating due to illness, but this is a pathological state. Refining and severing menstruation, however, is a deliberate practice, entirely different from illness. Young girls who have not yet begun menstruating are spared this stage of work. For elderly women whose menstruation has already ceased, they must first regulate their bodies and cultivate the practice to restore menstruation before refining it away—a far more intricate process.

**Question:** What is the form of "internal breathing"?
**Answer:** The function of "internal breathing" distinguishes between "prenatal qi" and "postnatal qi." When postnatal qi descends, prenatal qi simultaneously ascends; when postnatal qi ascends, prenatal qi simultaneously descends. The *Book of Changes* states: *"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian."* Opening and closing constitute transformation; ceaseless coming and going constitute communication. This principle bears a close relation to the method of internal breathing. Yet for those who have not reached this stage of practice, no amount of explanation will bring clarity. Beginners who have not yet mastered the foundational work cannot even begin to discuss internal breathing. Those who transmit the Dao but lack depth in practice, when describing the form of internal breathing, are like scratching an itch from outside one’s boot—leaving the learner with no way to proceed.

**Question:** When entering samadhi, one is speechless and motionless, like a corpse. What should one do in this state?
**Answer:** This is a natural phenomenon, not something forced. As for posture, one may sit cross-legged, sit upright with legs hanging, or recline with the upper body propped up—ordinary supine lying is less suitable. Those refining the yang spirit keep their eyes half-open; those refining the yin spirit keep them fully closed.

**Question:** After emerging from samadhi, one may eat and dress as one pleases. Does this mean one may take and use whatever one desires? And what of the warning to "guard against danger at every step"—does this refer to preventing unexpected disturbances?
**Answer:** "As one pleases" means one may freely dress and eat, with no attachment to preference. If there is attachment, desire lingers, and one cannot enter samadhi. Guarding against danger is not limited to one type; disturbances are among the risks to be prevented. At such times, one must have companions taking turns to keep watch day and night—hence the necessity for fellow cultivators.

*Collected Poems on Women’s Alchemy*
*Compiled by Fu Jinquan of Jinxī, Disciple of Unity*

**Editorial Principles of *Women’s Daoist Studies: A Small Collection*
Revised by Chen Yingning of Wanjian**

1. Carefully selected ancient and modern exemplary conduct and wise sayings from women, along with concise writings, to cultivate elevated character and impart exceptional intelligence in women—this pertains to the psychological aspect.
2. Carefully selected methods of cultivation, scriptures, treatises, and poems from past dynasties to foster extraordinary talents among women and strengthen the physical constitution of ordinary women—this pertains to the physiological aspect.
3. Daoist studies are the quintessence of the Chinese nation, unique to our country and absent in others. Previously, due to the limited spread of women’s education, this transcendent discipline remained unstudied. Now, following the principle of equality between men and women, this knowledge is gradually being made public.
4. Ancient writings vary in depth; some are profoundly abstruse and difficult to comprehend, while others are overly vulgar and unengaging. To ensure accessibility, abstruse passages are annotated for clarity, and vulgar ones are refined to avoid offending refined sensibilities.
5. The purpose of this compilation is to promote China’s indigenous Dao.

**Notes for Readers**

1. Three printed editions of *Women’s Alchemy Poems* exist:
   - A standalone edition,
   - An appended edition within *The True Mechanism of Unity: A Simplified Record*,
   - A collected edition in *The Combined Women’s Alchemy Anthology*.
   Differences in detail and arrangement exist among them. Sun Bu’er’s poems appear only in *The Simplified Record*; other editions omit them. The postscript to *The Western Pond Collection* appears solely in the combined edition. In the standalone edition, *The Western Pond Collection* is placed in the latter section, while the combined edition features *Jishantang Poems* in the latter section, with *The Western Pond Collection* as a separate, preceding section. *The Simplified Record* omits *Jishantang Poems* entirely and titles the work *Women’s Golden Alchemy* rather than *Women’s Alchemy Poems*. Here, the best versions are adopted, with over 180 characters corrected.
2. Determining the true authorship of certain poems is difficult. Daoist texts often bear attributed names without verifiable sources. Moreover, such textual scholarship is unnecessary for cultivation.
3. Though these works are called "poems," their intent lies not in poetry. Do not judge them by literary standards. Where the original text is crude, corrections have been made, but passages that cannot be altered without losing their essence remain unchanged. Few women in China are literate, and even fewer excel in poetry or prose. What may seem vulgar or shallow to us might appear refined and profound to them. The dissemination of the Dao prioritizes universal salvation, not catering to the tastes of a few literati while excluding the majority. Kindly understand the compiler’s intent.
4. *Jishantang Poems* were written by transmitters of the Dao yet falsely attributed to immortals, perfected beings, or ancient mothers—sixteen in total. These attributions have been removed. Each poem now bears a four-character title for the reader’s convenience. The original small-character annotations remain unchanged.

5. The annotations by Huichunzi in *Xichi Collection* consist largely of empty discourses on profound mysteries. They bear no relation to the cultivation of destiny (*minggong*), nor are they truly necessary for the cultivation of inner nature (*xinggong*)—such verbose elaborations are superfluous. Nowhere in *The Complete Works of Patriarch Lü* do we find such idle talk, which does an injustice to the Patriarch. However, as a few passages do offer some clarity, they have not been excised. Readers should discern their value accordingly.

6. Among the *Jishantang Poems*, works such as *The Wondrous Method of Scent Observation*, *The Method of Invoking the Heavenly Worthy*, and *The Six-Character Scripture Method* serve as metaphors for Immortal Learning, offering introductory practices. This is not to suggest that Daoist cultivation ends here, nor that no further progress lies beyond. Readers must not dismiss them as commonplace. Ordinary women, lacking in learning, may struggle with abstruse principles; thus, they are guided by what they already understand. Those of higher knowledge, of course, have no need for such instruction.

7. The supplementary *Twenty-Four Oral Instructions on Female Alchemy by Zhenyizi* were not part of the original compilation. I have selected them from another Daoist text and included them here, amending one hundred and ten characters in the process. They hold considerable value for study—readers are urged not to overlook them.

Written in December of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the four thousand six hundred and thirty-second year since the Yellow Emperor.

**Preface to the *Female Alchemy Poetry Collection***
*Former Section* – *Brief*
*Latter Section* – Compiled by Jishantang of Qianzhong
Edited and Annotated by Chen Yingning of Wanjiang

**1. Cleansing the Heart and Curbing Desires**
The ground of male and female elixir differs,
Yet the principle of yin and yang is one and the same.
Cleansing the heart and curbing desires form the root—
To lay the foundation, first sever the Red Dragon.

The ground of male and female elixir differs:
The initial work for men and women is not the same.
Yet the principle of yin and yang is one and the same:
Both must refine themselves into pure yang—truly, the principle is identical.
Cleansing the heart and curbing desires form the root—
To lay the foundation, first sever the Red Dragon.
*Red Dragon*: the monthly flow.
When, through refinement, the monthly flow ceases and the menses no longer rise,
The two breasts naturally shrink like a man’s retracted turtle—
Only then is the elixir’s foundation complete.

**2. Blood Transforms into Qi**
Born in stillness, seek within stillness,
Steam and nourish the broken vessel with singular devotion.
When blood transforms into qi and the tide of menses ceases,
The primordial unity is restored, and one ascends Penglai.

Born in stillness, seek within stillness:
Women are born with a nature inherently still—
Refining the elixir within stillness, success comes swifter than for men.
Steam and nourish the broken vessel with singular devotion—
When blood transforms into qi and the tide of menses ceases,
Women, abundant in blood, employ the method to transmute it entirely into qi,
And the monthly flow may be extinguished.
The primordial unity is restored, and one ascends Penglai:
Returning to the original nature, one may attain immortality and the Dao.

**3. Nurturing the Yellow Sprout**
When the passions bloom like a split melon,
Rely wholly on the virtue of earth to grow the yellow sprout.
Morning and night, diligently nurture it—
Naturally, one obtains the flower of ageless life.

When the passions bloom like a split melon:
When the water of heavenly gui arrives, it is like a melon splitting open.
Rely wholly on the virtue of earth to grow the yellow sprout:
The sprout arises within earth, hence it is called the *yellow sprout*.
Morning and night, diligently nurture it—
Naturally, one obtains the flower of ageless life:
From the yellow sprout, diligently nurture it without harm,
And it will gradually blossom—
This is the foundation for transcending kalpas and attaining longevity.

**4. The Wondrous Fragrance Observation Method**
Within the body lies a White Crane Temple—
Learn the wondrous method of observing fragrance to refine it.
When the work is complete, ascend to the Jasper Pool,
And all shall together attend the Peach Banquet.

Within the body lies a White Crane Temple:
This refers to the breasts—
Transform red into white, hence likened to the White Crane Temple.
Learn the wondrous method of observing fragrance to refine it:
Long ago, the Immortal Maiden of Fragrance Observation refined her method within the White Crane Temple,
And ultimately attained the great Dao.
When the work is complete, ascend to the Jasper Pool—
All shall together attend the Peach Banquet:
A hope that all may cross to the other shore—
Such is the universal compassion of the ferryman’s heart.

**5. The Heavenly Worthy’s Secret Intent**
Women, swiftly distance yourselves from worldly affairs,
For the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation suffers in mind.
Day and night, sit and lie with the Yellow Dame—
The mortal frame will shed, and immortal bones take its place.

Women, swiftly distance yourselves from worldly affairs—
The Heavenly Worthy of Salvation suffers in mind:
Constantly reciting the four-character scripture is the method to tether the heart.
Day and night, sit and lie with the Yellow Dame:
Guard the true intent at all times—
Thus, the work may swiftly be accomplished.
The mortal frame will shed, and immortal bones take its place:
With such benefits, how can one not cultivate?

**6. The Mysterious Awakening of Life and Death**
To learn death before dying is never to die;
To kill life when encountering birth is never to be born.
Neither death nor birth—truly entering the wondrous—
The mysterious awakening is realized, and the great work complete.

To learn death before dying is never to die:
Though not yet dead, one is like a dead person—
Thus, one ultimately does not die.
To kill life when encountering birth is never to be born:
When the deluded mind arises, sever it with the sword of wisdom—
Thus, one ultimately does not give birth to it.
Neither death nor birth—truly entering the wondrous—
The mysterious awakening is realized, and the great work complete:
The body does not die, the mind does not arise—
One may realize the wondrous fruit of mysterious awakening.

**7. Turning the Light Around and Reflecting**
Turn the light around and reflect between the two breasts,
Focus the spirit before the golden lock.
After two and a half days, yellow transforms to white—
Shift the cauldron and change the furnace to refine into immortality.

Turn the light around and reflect between the two breasts—
Focus the spirit before the golden lock:
Gaze between the two breasts, concentrate the spirit below the two kidneys—
Naturally, the river chariot will ascend to the central field to mend the broken body.
After two and a half days, yellow transforms to white:
After this period of practice, blood transforms into yellow.
At this time, purify the heart and apply effort—
Soon, it will turn white, the red vessels severed,
And the body will resemble that of a maiden.
Shift the cauldron and change the furnace to refine into immortality:
The Red Dragon already severed, the ground of practice differs—
With the proper method, refinement may lead to attainment.

**8. Compassion as the Root**
Compassion as the root, harmonious in nature and temperament,
Endure humiliation, swallow bitterness, and bear hardship.
Every person possesses the Kalpa Tree—
Sit long beneath the Kalpa Tree to ascend the Great Web.

Compassion as the root, harmonious in nature and temperament—
Endure humiliation, swallow bitterness, and bear hardship:
Whether laywomen or Daoist nuns of the mysterious stream,
All may cultivate—
But the root must be compassion.
Every person possesses the Kalpa Tree—
Sit long beneath the Kalpa Tree to ascend the Great Web:
Knowing where the Kalpa Tree resides,
And applying effort upon it,
One will surely attain the heavenly treasure.
*Note*: The first two lines of this poem originally read:
*"Compassion as the root, the heart is the matriarch—*
*At home or in retreat, nurture great harmony."*
They have now been amended.

**9. Employing Medicine and Fire in Dual Use**

**9. Employing Medicine and Fire in Dual Use**

The medicine refines within the fire,
The fire manifests within the medicine.
With fire but no medicine, one boils an empty pot;
With medicine but no fire, all eventually scatters.
When fire and medicine harmonize,
The Golden Elixir coalesces, and one enters the Jasper Garden.

The medicine refines within the fire—
The medicine is *qi*,
That is, spirit guiding *qi*.
The fire manifests within the medicine—
Spirit grows ever more numinous through *qi*.
With fire but no medicine, one boils an empty pot—
One must not play with fire!
With medicine but no fire, all eventually scatters—
One must not lack fire.
When fire and medicine harmonize,
The Golden Elixir coalesces, and one enters the Jasper Garden.
Spirit and *qi* interdependent—
How could it not succeed?

**10. Gathering Form in Great Yin**

Secluded, serene, and steadfast—nurturing nature and temperament,
A woman’s way is perfected, her virtue no light matter.
Ever mindful of the breasts and Sea of Blood,
Gather the form to unite with Great Yin.

Secluded, serene, and steadfast—nurturing nature and temperament,
A woman’s way is perfected, her virtue no light matter.
The first line nurtures nature; the second cultivates virtue—
This is the work of inner and outer refinement.
Ever mindful of the breasts and Sea of Blood—
The initial practice: gather the form to unite with Great Yin.
The method of refining form in Great Yin
Shrinks the breasts like a man’s.

**11. The Six-Character Scripture**

Best of all is the Six-Character Scripture,
From front to back, dwelling in the heart.
Within it lies the hidden River Chariot method—
Unknowing, unseeing, one refines into truth.

Best of all is the Six-Character Scripture

**18. The Root of Heart-Nature**

The Four Great Sacred Mountains teem with female immortals—
Some through filial piety, some through chastity, some through profound meditation.
Yet all rely on heart-nature as their root;
When conduct is complete and merit perfected, they ascend to heaven.

The Four Great Sacred Mountains teem with female immortals—
Half by devotion, half by discipline, half by mystical inquiry.
Though their paths differ, their destination is the same.
All rely on heart-nature as their root;
When conduct is complete and merit perfected, they ascend to heaven.

The twin characters "heart-nature" are the foundation of elixir refinement—
Neither man nor woman can do without them.
This verse concludes the *Female Alchemy Canon*.

**Supplement to the *Collected Poems on Female Alchemy***
**Oral Instructions on Female Alchemy by Zhenyi Zi**
**Collated and Revised by Chen Yingning of Wanjian**

**1. Gathering the Mind**
The principles of the Golden Elixir run most profound;
Seek each stage’s work with careful intent.
If you are but entering the gate and beginning practice,
Sweep away delusive thoughts to gather the mind.

**2. Nurturing Nature**
A seed of dark jade, once clear as crystal,
How could dust and grime obscure its brilliance?
But if you sit in stillness and turn the light inward,
The heart of heaven’s moon shines bright again by night.

**3. Cultivating Qi**
Though holding the thought may open the mystery,
When breath reaches harmony, it returns to the natural.
To cultivate qi, there is no other art—
Walk together, sit together, sleep together in accord.

**4. Congealing Spirit**
Spirit is the husband, breath the wife;
Do not let them part on divergent paths, sundered like cloud and mud.
When the two unite in the root-cavern,
The elixir is complete, and the crane arrives.

**5. The Three Destinies**
Light divides into yellow, white, and purple—three in all,
For a woman’s destiny is not like a man’s.
Youth in the upper, decline in the middle, fulfillment in the lower—
Master this single path through the crucial pass.

**6. The Qi Cavern**
The qi cavern is clearly the breasts;
Do not mistakenly guess below the navel.
If you do not recognize where yin arises in elixir refinement,
How can you tame the tiger and subdue the dragon?

**7. Knowing the Time**
Each time the flower blooms beneath the moon,
The ram is about to butt against the fence.
I urge you: when the moment comes, do not delay—
Lest the dragon’s form emerge from the water’s edge.

**8. Slaying the Dragon**
When yang stirs and yin emerges from the jade ravine,
Drive the fire-wheel without pause.
Let the *xun*-wind blow upward to the Crimson Palace;
Reverse the river chariot, relying on the counterflow.

**9. Concealing Form**
The ordinary body flows with monthly blood,
And by seventy, the signs of age appear.
But when you refine to conceal form in Great Yin,
From then on, the immortal body rejoices in long life.

**10. Seeking the Elixir**
Refining form into qi is the work of laying the foundation—
Not the same as the highest-grade celestial immortals.
If you ask where the Golden Elixir truly lies,
It is the sun shining on the moon, illuminating the primordial chaos.

**11. Refining the Self**
The living dragon and tiger battle in the lotus chamber;
Most feared is the heart-monkey and mind-horse running wild.
If refining the self has not reached pure mastery,
How can you cross Chen Cang in peace?

**12. Sequence and Reversal**
Following the sequence, one becomes human; reversing it, one becomes immortal—
The union of *qian* and *kun* is the true teaching.
Do not be surprised if the elixir is hard to congeal at the furnace;
When you reverse the ram’s chariot, heaven will appear of itself.

**13. The Elixir’s Birth**
In dim obscurity, as if entranced,
When fusion and harmony arrive, it is the moment the medicine is born.
The cinnabar field gives its sign, the opportunity arises—
Prepare your work to gather the jade mushroom.

**14. Gathering the Medicine**
Suddenly beholding the primordial single grain of elixir,
Its radiance blazes like a golden pellet.
If the *xun*-wind does not frequently urge the drum,
How can the great medicine pass through the barrier?

**15. Ascending the Origin**
The sun rises over Fusang in the eastern sea;
The fire-wheel flies across—do not pause in your work.
The deer cart carries it to the summit of Kunlun,
Where the wood-mercury naturally returns to the spirit chamber.

**16. Uniting the Elixir**
The *gen*-boy first returns to the chaos nest,
Where husband and wife henceforth weave their silken bonds.
Seal the six gates tightly and diligently add fire—
Within the curtains, the springtime harmony must be supreme.

**17. Fire Timing**
Though six hundred chapters on fire timing have been handed down,
The true timing has never been inscribed on phoenix paper.
Nothing is clearer than the words of *Chongxu*:
When inhalation and exhalation are distinct, immortality is attained.

**18. Warm Nurturing**
Already you see white snow sown in green sand;
Regulate cold and warmth—take care not to err.
When the thirty-six palaces are full of spring’s intent,
Naturally, a path opens for the immortal raft.

**19. Fetal Breathing**
Let your work be fine and close, not coarse or careless;
Spirit and breath, continuous as the Great Void.
If you ask what nurturing the fetus resembles—
It is as if returning to the time before father and mother were born.

**20. The Count**
Gathering the medicine and firing the elixir follow an order—
*Kan* and *li*, *gen* and *xun* are inverted and reversed.
When the work completes the ninety-nine revolutions of the celestial cycle,
Only then have you become a transcendent beyond the world.

**21. Shedding the Fetus**
After ten months, the fetus is round and the count complete,
The yang spirit suddenly wanders to the fontanel.
With a thunderous crack, it bursts forth into the sky—
Above the crown, all see the white qi floating.

**22. Nursing**
The newly born infant’s qi is not yet pure;
Still, it swallows wood-mercury to restore primordial truth.
After nursing for three years,
Its transformations become wondrously numinous.

**23. Facing the Wall**
Though the elixir work is complete, there is still labor to be done—
Sit in silent emptiness within the cave-heaven.
Forgetting form, enter samadhi without reckoning years;
Shatter the void to witness the sacred work.

**24. Ascension**
When you refine to true emptiness, the Dao grows ever higher;
The elixir scripture’s decree summons you to tread the clouds.
From now on, you dwell forever in the Jasper Pool gardens,
Following the spirit consorts to the early court.

**Yingning’s Note:**
These twenty-four poems on oral instructions for female alchemy,
Comprising six hundred seventy-two characters,
Have now been meticulously collated and corrected in one hundred ten characters,
Improving upon the original. Thus, they are printed here.
Recorded in the mid-winter of the *yihai* year.

**Songs of the Dao’s Subtle Source: Female Immortal Practice**
*(From the *Daoist External Canon*, Volume on Daoist Texts)*

For female immortality practice, one must first dispel illness and regulate the monthly flow to precision. Only then may one refine the self and sever the Red Dragon—its principle identical to a man’s subjugation of the White Tiger. Men possess a body of pure Yang, round and complete; their Yang essence may daily grow or discharge, and through this growth and discharge they replenish and perfect the firmness of Qian. Yet only a man of resolute will, one who has mastered the work of subduing the tiger, may achieve this. Women possess a body of pure Yin; their celestial water flows once each month. Thus, their initial practice aligns with that of men.

After severing the Red Dragon, a woman’s practice follows the same principle as a man’s: beginning with the Small Celestial Cycle, progressing through spirit emergence and returning to emptiness—all remains identical. Yet many women suffer irregular monthly flows, for their Conception and Girdle Vessels harbor stagnant blood from excess or deficiency. First, one must employ herbal medicine to treat these tangible ailments.

Begin with a single dose of *Tongqiao Huoxue Decoction*, composed of:
- Five *li* of true musk (infused),
- Three *qian* of safflower,
- Three *qian* of peach kernel paste,
- One *qian* of red peony leaf,
- Two *qian* of Sichuan lovage,
- Three *qian* of ginger,
- Three stalks of scallion,
- Seven red dates.

Crush these three ingredients, then decoct with half a *jin* of yellow wine until reduced to half a cup. Strain, add the musk, and decoct thrice more before consumption. This ensures all blood pathways throughout the body are unobstructed, and it also treats consumptive ailments.

Next, take the *Modified Four Agents Decoction* to harmonize qi and blood, ensuring neither excess nor deficiency, until the monthly flow arrives with a fresh, bright red hue and precise timing. Only then may one refine the self. If the monthly flow remains irregular, one dare not sever the Red Dragon—this is the immutable principle.

The *Four Agents Decoction* consists of:
- Three *qian* of tangkuei root,
- Two *qian* of white peony,
- Two *qian* of Sichuan lovage,
- Three *qian* of raw rehmannia,
- Two *qian* of ginseng,
- Two *qian* of white atractylodes,
- Two *qian* of bupleurum,
- Three *qian* of poria,
- Two *qian* of pinellia,
- Three *qian* of cyperus,
- One *qian* and five *fen* of honey-fried licorice,
- Three slices of ginger.

For qi deficiency, add five *qian* of astragalus. After two or three doses, qi and blood will be abundant, and one may proceed to sever the Red Dragon. Seek a master’s guidance without delay to refine the self and cultivate the true, transforming the Kun body to the firmness of Qian.

Women, being of pure Yin, base their practice upon the menstrual flow. Blood belongs to the Lesser Yin meridians, coursing alongside the Girdle and Conception Vessels in ceaseless circulation. It is the sea from which celestial water descends and ebbs, the primary channel through which the flow perpetually courses. Yet each month, a woman receives one *sheng* and three *ge* of this celestial water, and as it flows, so too do her meridians.

From childhood, a girl has no menstrual flow. Only at fourteen, when she awakens to the desires of union between man and woman, does passion stir, her body grow warm, and her qi pathways open—until celestial water surges forth. To cultivate the Way of longevity, one must seclude herself in a quiet chamber, sever all contact with men, and shun the company of wanton women. Her mouth must not speak of idle matters, her eyes must not gaze upon distant or near sights, her ears must not heed any extraneous sounds. She refines her spirit between her breasts, silently forgetting passion and extinguishing thoughts, her heart never straying outward.

Whenever worldly desire stirs, she must immediately rectify her mind. When the root of lust arises, she must swiftly employ the *Lute-Playing to Summon the Phoenix* method: stoke the martial fire to nurture the Northern Sea, then raise the Xun wind to fan its depths, allowing the light of wisdom to illuminate the Dragon Palace. She concentrates her spirit between her breasts. Without unwavering resolve, if her nature wavers and her passions overflow, the Red Dragon cannot be severed.

For example, if her flow arrives on the first day of the previous month and ceases by the third, she begins her practice on the third day of the current month. The first session severs the tail; the next month, she begins on the second day to sever the waist; the following month, on the first day, she severs the head—thus, the Red Dragon is cut off. If she is past seventy, her celestial water has already ceased. Yet with a true master’s guidance in the *Lute-Playing to Summon the Phoenix* method, she may coax the Red Dragon forth and sever it—this is the true secret.

For virgin maidens, there is no need to sever the Red Dragon. They may directly ascend to primordial chaos in an instant—this is the practice of virgin immortality, akin to a man’s work of gathering the essence. The foremost requirement is to refine the self to perfection, for even the slightest deviation will cause one to miss the moment of essence production—this is the method of refining the form in the Greater Yin.

At the first stirring of desire, true qi arrives. One must then gather the true qi from the crucible of the pre-parental state, forcefully drawing it upward with intent and guiding it to the right breast thirty-six times. With the right hand, knead the left breast thirty-six times. The gathering and drawing of true qi must be performed six times, totaling two hundred sixteen repetitions. Then, sit in silence, holding the breath, and clasp both breasts with both hands. After a moment, when the breath settles, true qi will arrive again. Forcefully draw the true qi from the pre-parental crucible and guide it to the right breast twenty-four times. Perform this six times, totaling one hundred forty-four repetitions. Again, sit in silence, holding the breath, clasping both breasts with both hands. The work of the twelve double-hours is complete, aligning with the fire phases of the Celestial Cycle.

Each day, persist in this practice. By the second day of the following month, sever the waist as before; by the first day of the third month, sever the head. In the fourth month, the Red Dragon will be fully severed, and this work must no longer be performed. Instead, clasp both breasts with both hands, hold the breath, and sit in stillness. Daily, forget passion and cleanse the mind of all worldly thoughts. Progress steadily without slackening, and naturally, essence will be born.

From the Mysterious Female, Yang qi will surge upward, ascending from the coccyx through the spine, passing the Jade Pillow, and rising straight to the Mud Pillow Palace—identical to a man’s practice.

When the Passes open and the essence-fluid is obtained, it descends through the Yellow Court in union, irrigating the five viscera. This practice must not be interrupted; one must advance with diligent effort to achieve the perfection of the Infant. The work of harmonizing and nurturing requires meticulous care. Observe the stages of practice as employed by men, and one must understand this method. Only when encountering a woman of utmost sincerity—a chaste, virtuous, and refined lady—may the secret be revealed. Guard this well! Should it be transmitted to a woman of lewd or deceitful nature, one will surely incur heavenly punishment and retribution.

This is the supreme and wondrous Dao of the Great Awakening, the Golden Immortal of Primordial Heaven. It was first transmitted by the Queen Mother of the West to the Old Mother of Li Mountain, who then directly instructed Daoist Nun Cui. Nun Cui passed it to Daoist Nun Li, who transmitted it to Immortal Chen. Chen then taught Yang Saihua, who conveyed it to Huanghua Gu, who in turn instructed the Young Lady. Huanghua Gu also transmitted it to Ma Gu, who passed it to Wang Jinlian, who then taught Daoist Nun Yang. All these transmissions were oral, one to another.

Dazhi asked: *"Have male immortals ever transmitted this to female immortals?"*
Qiaoqiao replied: *"The Great Dao is the same for men and women. If one knows the true secret, a man may transmit it to a woman, and a woman may transmit it to a man. In ancient times, Patriarch Lü Chunyang directly instructed He Xiangu, and later Zhang Zhennu. Patriarch Wang Chongyang transmitted it to Sun Bu’er, the Primordial Sovereign—this is an example of a man transmitting to a woman. There are also cases of women transmitting to men: Sun Bu’er established the ‘Pure Serenity School’ and has since guided countless later disciples—this is a woman transmitting to men."*

Zhao Dawu asked: *"Are there those who have attained the Dao through self-realization?"*
The answer: *"In former times, there was Wei Yuanjun, named Huacun, styled Xian’an, a native of Bianliang. Her father, Wei Shu, styled Yuanyang, served as Left Deputy Minister during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Jin, later rising to Minister of Works and being enfeoffed as the Duke of Juyang County, posthumously honored as Wen Kang. Her mother was Lady Deqing. Yuanjun was born on the fifteenth day of the second month in the eighteenth year of Jian’an during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han. Gifted with extraordinary talent from birth, she studied the books of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi in her youth and was deeply drawn to the arts of divine transcendence. She longed to cultivate the Dao in seclusion, but her parents vehemently opposed it. At twenty-four, she was compelled to marry Liu Yi, a subordinate of the Grand Protector, and bore two sons. Her husband died early. Her eldest son, Liu Xia, became the Prefect of Ancheng, and her second son, Liu Pu, served as Gentleman of the Palace. At this time, Yuanjun renounced worldly ties and devoted herself to cultivation. On the sixteenth day of the twelfth month in the first year of Taikang during the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin (the year *wushen*), at midnight, the Dao Lord bestowed upon her a thousand volumes of immortal scriptures, along with oral instructions from a true adept of the Western Regions. She also transmitted the method to Qi Gu and her three daughters, as well as to Lingzhao Nü. All practiced this Dao. After Yuanjun attained the Way, she composed the *Jade Sword and Golden Writ*, which circulated in the world. She ascended as the Primordial Sovereign of the Purple Void, governing the life-destinies of the Southern Marchmount’s Perfected Ones, her influence extending between the Dipper and Ox constellations. She transcended the mundane and ascended in the ninth year of Chengxuan during the Jin dynasty, on the fifteenth day of the ninth month, by imperial jade decree. She left behind the *Exhortation to the World* and a collection of verses, including the *Songs of Refining Form in the Great Yin*."

**First Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
A woman’s path to immortality lies at hand,
Two wondrous gates open to the Mud Pillow Palace.
Align true breath with the tides,
Spirit returns to the Celestial Valley, naturally circling.

First refine the two breasts with true fire,
Then guide it into the Elixir Field, transmuting into lead.
With utmost sincerity, forge a body of pure Yang,
Reversing age to regain youth, living ten thousand years.

**Second Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
Essence and qi are the root, establishing the foundation of nature.
Still the mind, illuminating inner and outer with non-action.
In continuous breath, absorb the Yang waters,
Silently harmonize the elements, uniting Kan and Li.

Hunger and thirst quenched by the true fluid of Earth,
Drunk and asleep, clad in the Fire Dragon’s robe.
With a turn of the body, the sword strikes the Heavenly King’s Pagoda,
Transforming into an immortal, ascending the ladder of sixteen feet.

**Third Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
The wondrous workings of Qian and Kun adapt to square and circle,
Grasp the Double Passes, and qi spirals upward.
Reverse the flow of the Yellow River’s three-foot waves,
Scoop back the primal spring from the Mysterious Valley.

The pure vase opens upward, gathering clouds and snow,
When the clear flute is blown, heaven and earth respond.
Swallow the elixir of the two eights into the belly,
The body in an instant transforms into pure Qian.

**Fourth Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
Close the door, open the Passes, and the hundred channels flow,
Silently cultivate the work before midnight and after noon.
Refine the form, revolving through the wondrous gates,
Circulate the fire, fanning the bellows’ wind.

Harmonize pure Kun into the tiger within the cave,
Encircle and bind the dragon of the Zhen Palace.
The thunder of Earth issues commands, clouds dispense rain,
Washing the Yellow Sprout, piercing the nine layers.

**Fifth Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
To secure destiny, first regulate the original form,
Forget words, extinguish thoughts, and do not cling to scriptures.
The cauldron boils the red dust-water of the eight seas,
The mouth absorbs the azure essence of the three mountains.

The five-colored Mysterious Pearl pierces the Crimson Wall,
A sprig of willow leaf is planted in the golden vase.
The fair maiden displays her divine skill,
Carving bamboo into a flute, playing a single note.

**Sixth Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
Yin and Yang’s ebb and flow entrusted to the Yellow Dame,
Silently, true feelings harmonize two minds.
The old tiger feasts on the young phoenix’s marrow,
The red snake pierces through the black turtle’s nest.

Five hues intermingle, free from demonic obstacles,
Entering water, returning to the source, waves cease.
Clouds spread, the dragon roars, white snow flies,
The cowherd plays his flute, turning toward the western slope.

**Seventh Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
To refine the form, seek the root’s origin,
Qi circulates and gathers in the Upper Mystery.
Seize the Red Dragon, hiding in the field,
Secure the White Tiger, sleeping in the mud.

Summon the immortal maidens, the Blue Maidens,
Accompany the Perfected One, the White Jade Toad.
Mouth to mouth, transmit the talisman, connecting one qi,
Mutually consuming, turning back to heaven.

**Eighth Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
The divine maiden plays the flute at the two eights’ hour,
Clear notes resound, echoing in the western flowers.
The jade lad startles from the Dragon’s den,
The Queen Mother invites her to the Tiger’s foundation of Dui.

The hundred apertures open, qi circulates as one,
The nine palaces close breath to sever the Three Corpses.
Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Axis communicate their tidings—
The inversion of yang’s return is known by few.

**Ninth Song of Refining Form in the Great Yin**
Ever since the Three Treasuries set forth to fetch the scriptures,
They toppled the Nine-Bend City of the Western Heaven.
To rectify heaven and earth, one must accumulate qi,
Seek to replenish water and fire to restore the primal form.

After three cycles, without inquiry, divine work is complete,
In a single moment, aligned with creation, it is accomplished.
Once more, the spring breeze welcomes the cosmos,
Transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood, eternal and everlasting.

Since ancient times, the true cultivation of women
Has been ten thousand times harder—scarcely one succeeds.

Master Zhao Dawu asked: *What should a woman prioritize when cultivating the Great Dao?*
The answer: *Sweep away desire first, sever attachment with urgency.*

Again, he asked: *Why?*
The answer: *If desire is not eradicated, her menses will not cease; if attachment is not cut, the Great Dao remains obscure. These two are the seeds of life and death, the root of rebirth. Thus, they must come first. If one can extinguish desire, sever emotional bonds, abandon greed and wrath, and dedicate body and mind, why fear the Dao’s difficulty or wisdom’s failure to arise? Even the dull-witted, following the method, may refine the primordial One Return—wisdom will multiply a hundredfold. Poetry, prose, and essays will flow without thought, understanding will dawn without study.*

For example, the common folk, entangled in passion, give birth to children in the usual way. But if one reverses this process, returning it to the self, spiritual wisdom grows. Over time, transformation occurs—one may then be called an immortal, Buddha, or sage.

Lü Zu said:
*To escape the suffering of rebirth, first extinguish ignorance.
Hold fast to the mind’s resolve, firmer than iron.
A single thought of womanly longing—
Not even raging fire can warm it.
Worldly ties and wealth,
Honors and splendor—all must be wiped away.
Retreat from the dusty realm,
Forget others, forget the self.*

The Dao, though nameless, is cultivated into form through unwavering awareness of the true source.
Why does the body exist? Through the power of the Great Ultimate,
A small heaven and earth, the five phases congealed.
From the parents’ twofold mystery, the true essence arises—
Only then do the four great elements form the fetal sac.
The five senses and four limbs gradually take shape,
Like a melon ripening on the vine, the body naturally appears.

Desire stirs awareness, anger and sorrow awaken emotion,
True knowledge and perception of things become complete.
From youth to maturity, the seven emotions shift,
The nature of consciousness alters, distinguishing signs emerge.
Desire rages, ambition swells, the heart clings to fame and profit—
Ten thousand times harder to break free from this great barrier.
Thus, the common saying: *Life and death are self-made.*
The sages could not bear to leave people trapped,
So they crafted alchemical scriptures to guide the worthy back to truth.

From entering the womb, spirit and breath harmonize,
Joining with essence to coagulate the sacred infant.
The method lies in silent contemplation, envisioning the original form.
The parents’ root is the Buddha-seed,
The parents’ paradise is one’s own foundation.
By this root, transcend the ordinary;
By this root, attain sagehood.
Do not mingle with the mundane—
The heart’s filth defiles the Kidney Palace.

The two qi come and go, yin and yang delight,
As if parents bestowing this body.
The noble one achieves the Dao; the common man clings to base emotions.
Only the resolute husband can temper his nature.
Governing the self is hardest—
Without virtue, one drifts empty, unaware of when to stop.
To embrace the highest good, gather and refine.

Rely on mutual forgetting, entering hibernation like a hidden insect.
True intention is the fire, breath is the wind.
Do not miss the appointed time—
When the thunder rumbles in earth and sky,
Gather and forge, drum and blow the flute.
When things submit and peace prevails, nurture gently, do not startle.
In an instant, with utmost urgency, return to play.
After two watches, the pearl coalesces, the Muni takes form.
The true master transmits the method, reversing the ascent upward.

The prior and posterior heavens merge in one place,
Three revolutions, nine returns, seven reversals refine it.
The Buddha calls it *Perfect Enlightenment*,
The Daoist calls it *Elixir Achieved*,
The Confucian calls it *Vast Integrity*—eternal, divine power,
The greatest, most unyielding, nurtured by virtuous power.

Again, a chant:
*The three teachings’ forbidden secrets are now revealed,
The River Chart and Luo Scripture name this source.
Confucians speak of the two and five congealing in wondrous union,
Daoists speak of the river chariot circling the heavens.
Buddhists speak of the deer cart and the turning Dharma wheel—
For ages unspoken, now fully transmitted.
I wish for like-minded friends of true heart,
To cultivate earnestly, awaken deeply, and discern with care.*

*From the "Women’s Alchemy Section of Chinese Immortal Studies"*
*Letter from Chen Wuxuan of Baoying, Jiangsu*

To the Venerable Master Yuandun, Enlightened One of Sudden Awakening:

With deepest respect, I humbly report: Since first hearing the Dao twenty-odd years ago, I have drifted in confusion, remaining unchanged. Reflecting on this, shame and regret overwhelm me. In past years, I have entered many gates and met numerous cultivators, most of whom merely copied teachings without true realization. Few achieved genuine verification. Alas, my fate is thin and karma deep—I have rarely encountered a true master. Thus, I turned to the immortal and Buddhist authentic transmissions, such as *The True Principles of Heavenly Immortality*, reading in stillness and pondering in darkness. Gradually, I gained some understanding. Later, I sought out an elderly Daoist master, Li, who at seventy still possessed robust vitality. His Daoist name was Zhongzhou. His teachings aligned with the classics, so I entreated him to transmit oral instructions such as "Severing the Red Dragon." Following them, I witnessed effects. Unexpectedly, Master Li passed away within a few years. Each time I recall him, I sigh deeply. In the twentieth year of the Republic, floods wrought disaster, disrupting my practice. The following winter, during meditation, I entered a state of forgetting form with eyes closed. Suddenly, the room filled with radiant light, clearer than daylight. When I opened my eyes, nothing remained. Soon after, repairs to my dwelling led to neglect.

Last year, I reflected: human life resembles a dream; awakened, one sees its illusory, impermanent nature. Unresolved in life and death, one remains bound to the wheel of rebirth. Thus, I vowed to enter seclusion, hoping to refine and deepen my practice. Nearly a year has passed, and I dare say I have achieved some verification. Yet, I regret not having received direct transmission of celestial oral instructions from a named master. I often fear treading perilous paths and straying onto wrong turns. Recently, Mr. Shi Zhihe delivered your writings, revealing your lofty Dao and profound virtue, your vast vows and deep compassion. Regrettably, confined to my seclusion chamber, I cannot pay homage in person. Joy and agitation mingle—my reverence is beyond words! Thus, I take the liberty of humbly beseeching you, Master, to generously bestow mercy. Kindly elucidate in detail the crucial oral instructions: advancing the *yang fire* at *zi*, retreating the *yin tally* at *wu*, bathing at *mao* and *you*, gathering the great medicine over seven days, crossing the passes to ingest it, forming the sacred embryo, and the great celestial cycle, among others. May this spare me from wasting time and missing the opportunity. Should I ever attain success, it shall be entirely your grace. Your boundless kindness will be engraved in my heart, and I vow to honor it throughout my life.

Having read your esteemed works, I see your advocacy for virtue, with particular emphasis on the feminine current and earnest guidance. Though I have not formally entered your lineage, I presume my bold request will not be rejected. I shall say no more. I earnestly await your reply.

With utmost respect, I bow a hundred times,
Your disciple, Chen Wuxuan

Reply to Ms. Chen Wuxuan of Baoying, Jiangsu

To Ms. Wuxuan, Disciple of Sudden Awakening:

Your letter has been received. Your sincerity in pursuing the Dao fills me with admiration. As for the immortal Dao, I can only be called a researcher. Deeply ashamed of my own lack of attainment, I am unworthy to serve as a teacher. Yet, moved by your earnest seeking, I fear silence may lead to disappointment and disheartenment. Thus, I cannot disregard your plea. However, as this is our first correspondence, I cannot presume to know your circumstances. Please answer the following questions in detail, after which we may proceed further:

1. Are you a monastic or a layperson?
2. Have you married, or are you unmarried?
3. What is your age?
4. Is your family situation favorable?
5. Do you have living parents? Any siblings or children?
6. Which Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist scriptures have you read?
7. Which texts on women’s cultivation have you studied?
8. When does your seclusion period conclude?
9. What practice are you currently engaged in during seclusion?
10. What level of attainment do you aspire to achieve?

Respectfully,
Yuandunzi

Second Letter from Ms. Chen Wuxuan of Baoying, Jiangsu, with Answers

To the Venerable Master Yuandun, Enlightened Teacher:

With deepest respect, I humbly report: Burdened by deep karmic obstacles, I was born a woman. In my youth, I received little formal education, merely observing and mimicking my brothers’ studies. Fortunately, my family possessed many virtuous texts, which I perused in leisure. I particularly enjoyed reading *The Precious Scroll of Immortal He Xiangu*, which inspired my aspiration for cultivation.

**Yuandun’s Note:** From the perspective of immortals, men and women are equal in potential. In terms of practice and verification, women progress faster than men. In future attainment, there is no distinction of high or low. The common prejudice of valuing men over women is a human construct, not a natural one. In major world religions—Buddhism, Catholicism—and various secret sects in China, such as certain gates, halls, or societies, men and women are not treated equally. Only in the Daoist path is there no such hierarchy. Other religions guide ordinary people, while true Daoist cultivation is reserved for the most wise. Thus, it transcends such prejudices. Those with aspiration must not feel discouraged merely because they are women.

Later, I obtained works such as *Authentic Transmissions of Immortals and Buddhas*, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, and *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality*, and only then did I realize that the Dao of immortality was a matter of easy cultivation and tangible verification.

**Yuandun’s Note:** For women, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas* and *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality* may serve to clarify principles but cannot be practiced as written. *Authentic Transmissions of Immortals and Buddhas*, moreover, is too disordered and lacks structure, falling short of the other two works.

Thereupon, I upheld the precepts of refuge and vowed to renounce the red dust of the world. By this time, I had reached the age of sixteen or seventeen, and my widowed mother had already entrusted matchmakers to arrange my marriage. I then earnestly declared my aspirations to her. Not only did my mother refuse to believe or heed me, but she sought to undermine my resolve—when that failed, she resorted to relentless abuse.

**Yuandun’s Note:** Most people behave this way. I recall that around the age of ten, I found two volumes of *Biographies of Divine Immortals* by Ge Hong of the Jin dynasty at home. Too afraid to read openly, I placed the book on my lap and read in secret, while a copy of the *Analects* lay spread on the desk as a decoy.

For I feared that if my father learned I was reading heterodox books, he would beat and scold me. At thirteen, I slipped out to the streets to learn the talismans of Chen Prefecture, only to be thrashed severely upon returning home. At fourteen, I bought a copy of *The Ten Thousand Dharmas Return to the Source*, which was seized by my family and cast into the fire. Not until I turned sixteen did I gain some freedom, as they grew too weary to interfere further. Yet even then, I dared not openly display things like thunder-struck jujube-wood seals, camphor-and-willow spirits, or peachwood swords.

My maternal uncle, seeing that I endured every trial without wavering from my original resolve, took pity on me. He devised a ruse to deceive my mother, enabling me to be brought here—a place for practicing the Way while keeping my hair, where several Daoist nuns already resided. At last, my early aspirations found some solace. Yet this was but a desolate temple, a poor hermitage with no property to its name. Having come this far, I had no choice but to endure hardship and bitterness, fending for myself. The depths of my plight defy description. In the tenth and twentieth years of the Republic, two floods brought further setbacks.

**Yuandun’s Note:** Remaining at home entangles one in worldly affairs, while leaving home makes survival no easier. Is it truly better to cultivate the Dao at home or in seclusion? This is indeed a profound question. Not only women face this dilemma—men who seek the Way encounter the same difficulties. I have long wished to unite like-minded individuals across the nation to devise a sound solution, but the time is not yet ripe. When this wish may be fulfilled remains unknown. From my twentieth year to the present, over two decades have passed, and though I have known constant hardship, the pursuit of the "Dharma, wealth, companions, and place" has never left my thoughts for a single day.

In recent years, several chaste widows and virtuous maidens have come to the hermitage to cultivate. Reflecting on my own lack of true transmission, I cannot hope for swift attainment—how then can I guide them to fruition? Thus, two years ago, I traveled to the capital to seek instruction. Alas, the wise had concealed their traces, and I found no one to consult. I then turned to Buddhist organizations. After visiting many, I encountered only ordinary practitioners, and none whose understanding promised liberation.

**Yuandun’s Note:** In this day and age, traveling to seek the Way is no easy task. I have seen many monastics and lay practitioners devoted to the Dao who spent their lives journeying across the land, yet still gained nothing. How much less could one achieve by confining the search to the capital in so short a time? Buddhist organizations, aside from teaching people to recite the Buddha’s name, offer no other methods. I knew this could not satisfy your aspirations. In my earlier work, *Record of Minor Heterodox Arts*, I made a few remarks that may supplement what is left unsaid here:

*"Seeking a true teacher early—what a laughable idea! A true teacher does not advertise, distribute flyers, hang a sign, boast, or bear any special mark. The world is vast, and those who seek the Way—how are they to know who is a true teacher, or where one resides, in which province, county, mountain, cave, street, or alley? Let me speak plainly: a true teacher is encountered, not sought."*

Yet I believed the discipline and rituals of that teaching could restrain later learners and serve as a means for universal salvation. Thus, I returned home, shaved my head, and presumptuously donned the guise of a Buddhist monastic. Though I achieved some minor success in exhortation, I deeply regret my own inability to attain liberation.

**Yuandun’s Note:** Her circumstances are pitiable, yet her resolve is admirable!

Last year, on the ninth day of the third lunar month, I formally entered seclusion, intending to devote three years to quiet cultivation in pursuit of ultimate attainment.

**Yuandun’s Note:** This is an excellent decision—I wholeheartedly approve!

Since entering seclusion, I have maintained a regimen of three sittings by day and three by night, totaling six sessions daily. In recent months, I have frequently heard rushing wind within my ears and seen flashes like lightning before my eyes. At times, faint strains resembling silk and bamboo music or the chirping of insects arise, prompting me to send someone to investigate outside, though no trace is ever found.

**Yuandun’s Note:** Such phenomena are common to all who earnestly practice Daoist cultivation and are nothing to be alarmed by—do not let doubt or fear arise!

When internal respiration becomes perceptible, I must immediately enter meditation; otherwise, I feel discomfort. Only after sitting for two or three hours do I sense my qi restored and my spirit at ease. I am uncertain whether these two experiences are auspicious or inauspicious, or what their underlying cause may be. I humbly beseech my revered teacher for instruction.

**Yuandun’s Note:** These are merely physiological transformations within your own body and are not harmful. Persist in your practice, and even more wondrous states will unfold. I refer you to the letters of Li Chaorui, a student at Anhui Normal University, published in earlier issues of this journal, as well as the eight queries from Liu Yuliang of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, in the current issue. Though male and female physiology differs, the process of reversing the course of nature remains the same.

*The Ten Principles of Female Alchemy* states: “When a woman severs the Red Dragon, she must refine it with true fire and align it with true talismans. Should the fire or talismans falter, not only will the Golden Elixir fail to form, but she may also suffer from blood collapse.” These words are true and not empty. Your disciple has already undergone this once.

Afterward, it took more than a month of effort before recovery was achieved. That is now a matter of the past. As for the most recent attempt, when the Red Dragon was severed again within a short span, more than half a year has since passed—yet unexpectedly, what was cut off has returned. This is surely due to a failure to grasp the true fire and true talismans.

I privately reflect that for women who cultivate the Dao, transcending the cycle of rebirth and attaining liberation hinges entirely upon this. If this barrier is not thoroughly penetrated, efforts will be in vain, and the outcome will be nothing more than aging and death—no different from ordinary people.

*Yuan Dun’s note: Your insight is most apt; my own view is the same!*

The practice of "severing the Red Dragon" is not particularly difficult—indeed, it is several times easier than the practices of men. That it is cut off only to return must have a cause. When men cultivate the Minor Celestial Cycle, they may seal the Yang Pass and retain essence for a year or half a year without leakage, yet later, leakage may still occur. If one examines this closely, one finds that if the practice is out of harmony—whether excessive or insufficient—problems arise. One must grasp the principle of the "mean." Even minor details in diet may have an effect.

Those who maintain a vegetarian diet often favor such savory delicacies as mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and monosodium glutamate, but these are most unsuitable. One should consume bland, flavorless meals and dishes; even soy sauce, salt, and spices like pepper and chili should not be eaten in excess. There are many other minor considerations, but I shall not enumerate them all here.

In a moment of hesitation, I learned of your esteemed teacher’s great name and, a few days ago, took the liberty of writing without due consideration. Having prepared this letter, I am deeply grateful that you did not dismiss my humble words. Receiving your generous reply, I have read it again and again, filled with joy and gratitude beyond measure!

*Yuan Dun’s note: At present, I appear in the guise of an outer-path practitioner, devoted solely to the study of immortal arts, which differs from the principles of the Buddhist school. Since you, madam, have shaved your head and taken refuge in the Buddha’s gate, if you were to study the Dao under me as well, would you not fear reproach from your fellow disciples? In past years, there have been lay Buddhists who came to study the Dao with me. Occasionally, one or two of them, due to ill fortune, were discovered by their fellow practitioners, leading to great disputes. Frightened, they dared not show themselves and later consulted me, asking that I keep their studies secret and not make them public. I believe that studying the Dao is an upright and honorable matter—why conceal it? If one acts in such a furtive manner, what dignity remains? Would this not tarnish the reputation of the immortal arts? Though they had their own difficulties, I could not agree to their request and had no choice but to let the matter drop. I wonder if you, madam, face similar obstacles. This is why I have not yet published your name—it is for this very reason. I now present the full account to you, though it may weary your ears. If you do not disdain my unworthiness, I humbly beseech your esteemed teacher to compassionately reveal, in detail, the secret oral instructions on advancing the fire, withdrawing the talisman, bathing, nurturing, the Major and Minor Celestial Cycles, the civil and martial firing times, gathering and sealing, the living Zi hour, and all other such esoteric methods, so that I may cultivate accordingly. Should you deign to impart these teachings, any future attainment I achieve will be entirely the gift of your great kindness. My gratitude would know no bounds!*

The Perfectly Sudden One replied: Those who study Buddhism are often bewildered by terminology. Daoist practitioners share this affliction. In time, I shall dispel these knots of doubt for you—pray, do not fret.

In response to your ten queries, I humbly answer as follows:

1. I am a monastic.
2. I have never married.
3. I am forty-six years of age.
4. My circumstances spare me from cold and hunger.
5. My family home lies fifty *li* from here. My father passed early; my mother remains alive. Though I have siblings, we do not keep in touch.
6. I have perused the essential texts of both Confucianism and Buddhism. As for Daoist works, I have read: *The Twelve Kinds*, *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* (*Cantong Qi*), *Awakening to Reality* (*Wuzhen Pian*), *The Pointers on the Cultivation of Nature and Life* (*Xingming Guizhi*), *The Complete Guide to Daoist Cultivation*, *The Union of Dao and Buddha* (*Xianfo Hezong*), *The True Principles of Heavenly Immortality*, *The Authentic Transmission of Dao and Buddha*, *The Complete Works of Patriarch Lü*, *The Scripture of the Mysterious Pass*, *The Realm of Profound Mystery*, and *The Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*, among others.
7. The *Daoist Studies Minor Series* published by the Yihua Hall is nearly complete in my collection. As for the *Daoist Studies Minor Series for Women*, I have also acquired *Ten Precepts of the Female Elixir*, *The Orthodox Methods of Women’s Work*, *The Songs of Sun Buer’s Female Elixir*, and *A Discernment of the Differences Between Male and Female Elixir Cultivation*.
8. My initial seclusion was set for three months, but as I gained benefit within, I extended it to three years.
9. In my current practice, during seated meditation, I first guard the *hai di* (Sea Bottom). When the *qi* mechanism there stirs, I shift to guarding the breasts.
10. My aspiration is to attain the state of “ascending in broad daylight,” that the multitude may witness it.

Further, I have observed in texts on the female elixir the saying, “A woman’s destiny has three.” This likely refers to the *hai di* (Sea Bottom), *zhong gong* (Central Palace), and breasts. Yet I remain uncertain: when a woman first begins cultivation, which locus should she guard?

The Perfectly Sudden One replied: Guarding the Center is most fitting. This “Center” signifies the union of spirit and *qi*, not the Central Palace; it is the nexus of inner and outer resonance, not a fixed point within the body. While the *hai di*, *zhong gong*, and breasts may be guarded, clinging rigidly to any single locus strays from the Great Dao.

As for your disciple: what practice must now be employed to witness the auspicious sign of *yang* stirring within? Though all may know the method, its proper application is not necessarily understood. As the ancients said: “A hair’s breadth in error leads one a thousand *li* astray.” Truly, these are words of profound truth.

The Perfectly Sudden One replied: For now, proceed temporarily with the practice you are accustomed to. You must maintain *"an unbroken continuity, as if present yet not exerting force."* (These two lines are from the *Daodejing*, and are precisely applicable when first beginning.) As for the auspicious sign of *yang* stirring, you must first clearly understand the "Living Zi Hour." To discern whether the manifestation of the "Living Zi Hour" is pure and authentic, you must first comprehend the "Living Wu Hour." In women’s cultivation, most speak only of mercury and not of lead. The *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source* by the Song-dynasty Immortal Lady Cao Wenyi is of great value among women’s alchemical texts—it is indispensable reading. If you have not yet seen it, I may copy a version for you in the future.

Whenever you encounter elders in the Dao, you ask them about the profound and wondrous, yet they respond vaguely—is this because they are unwilling to speak plainly, or because they do not know? The Perfectly Sudden One notes: There are three reasons for this. First, the boundary between male and female makes it difficult to speak freely. Second, men understand only the cultivation of the *qian* Dao and lack thorough knowledge of women’s physiology, so their explanations often miss the mark. Third, when they first studied the Dao under their masters, they did not inquire about women’s practices, and thus cannot answer such questions later. These are the shortcomings of male instructors.

As for female instructors, though they may avoid these three flaws, their level of attainment is often not yet equal to yours, so if you ask them, they naturally cannot provide answers. I humbly beseech the Venerable Master, whose wisdom encompasses both inner and outer, whose merit and fruition are complete, whose words surpass those of ordinary people, and whose aspirations transcend even the sages of old. In my joy and gratitude, I dare say this is the good fortune of three lifetimes. Though our exchange is but through letters, it is no different from receiving your oral teachings in person. Yet I fear that the celestial mechanisms and oral instructions are guarded as strict secrets, requiring face-to-face transmission and not to be lightly committed to paper—this would indeed be an unavoidable憾事. Reflecting on the Master’s boundless heart for propagating the Dao and earnest wish to deliver all beings, might you, for the sake of convenience, make an exception and impart them? I offer fervent prayers and await your gracious reply with reverence.

Your disciple, Chen Wuxuan, bows in respect.

The Perfectly Sudden One replied: Correspondence is acceptable, but do not be impatient. This matter depends on karmic conditions and timing, and cannot be forced. When an opportunity arises, I intend to copy several oral instructions on women’s alchemy and send them by post. However, success also depends on the disciple’s wisdom and merit. Relying solely on oral instructions does not guarantee attainment.

*Answering the Ten Questions of Miss Chen Wuxuan of Baoying*
*The Perfectly Sudden One*

**Question One:** You mentioned that there are only twenty-some extant texts on women’s alchemy in the country. Here, I possess only the *Winged Transformation Hall’s Minor Compendium on Women’s Daoist Studies* and your own *Annotated Poems on Women’s Alchemy*. I am unaware of others. If there are places where they may be purchased, kindly provide the addresses. If they are rare treasures, might I borrow two to copy?

**Answer:** Such books do not circulate publicly and cannot be purchased. When an opportunity arises, they may be disclosed in this publication.

---

**Question Two:** When I practice seated meditation during the day, stray thoughts are easily stilled, and tranquility comes with relative ease. Yet upon waking at night, I feel my spirit vigorous and my qi abundant, while scattered thoughts surge uncontrollably, preventing me from settling my mind. This is most disruptive. I humbly request an ingenious method to correct this.

**Answer:** Carefully study the *Treatise on Sitting in Forgetfulness* and thoroughly read the *Classic of Earthly Tranquility*—you will find the subtle method for "halting thoughts" therein. In my view, "scattered thoughts" pose no great harm to beginners. So long as your body remains still, let these thoughts rise and fall naturally. "Still water without ripples"—how easily said!

---

**Question Three:** Among women in our tradition who possess both merit and wisdom, some may be expected to achieve attainment. Having sought the Dao for many years, you must have encountered such individuals. Might you name a few to gladden my heart?

**Answer:** In this world, those lacking both merit and wisdom form the vast majority. A small number may have merit but no aspiration, or aspiration but no merit. Those who possess both are exceedingly rare. And among these, those who both love the Dao and may be expected to attain—such women are truly difficult to find today. I am presently making inquiries; if I learn of any, I shall inform you.

---

**Question Four:** There is a chaste widow who married at nineteen and was widowed at twenty-four. Though robust in body and keen in mind, the strange thing is that she has never menstruated. She now intends to cultivate the Dao—might she have hope of obtaining the medicine and refining the returning elixir? I humbly seek your guidance.

**Answer:** Women who never menstruate are not uncommon. If not due to a hidden ailment, this is likely a karmic root from a past life. When she truly begins Daoist practice, she will have greater advantage than women who menstruate, for she may omit the procedure of "slaying the red dragon." There was once a veteran film star who was born without menstruation. Though highly intelligent and youthful in appearance despite her age, she knew nothing of cultivation and lived a dissipated life—most regrettable.

---

**Question Five:** All alchemical texts state that women’s practice differs from men’s, and that "they speak of mercury but not of lead." This humble disciple is dull-witted; I humbly request your instruction.

**Answer:** This arises from the natural physiological differences between men and women, not from deliberate contrivance. The phrase "speak of mercury but not of lead" does not mean women possess only mercury and no lead. Rather, in former times, women were constrained by old rites and morals, often too shy to speak openly of such matters.

---

**Question Six:** Women’s alchemy texts say: "When the wind is about to come, seize the tiger at once; when rain is about to fall, then may you slay the dragon." Timing is critical—only by slaying at the right moment can refinement proceed. The profound subtleties elude me; I humbly beg your detailed explanation.

**Answer:** The character "slay" (*zhan*) in "slay at the right moment" may be a misprint for "gather" (*cai*). For details, consult the poem "Slaying the Dragon" in the *Annotated Poems on Women’s Alchemy by Sun Bu’er*. If you still do not understand, words on paper can hardly convey it—this must be transmitted orally in the future.

---

**Question Seven:**

**Question Seven:**
Is it true that "Yang Fire" descends first and "Yin Talisman" ascends afterward? How exactly does this circulation operate, and when should it be applied? I humbly beg your instruction.

**Answer:**
This kind of operation is profoundly subtle and intricate—it cannot be clearly explained on paper and must be addressed face-to-face. Moreover, it is not something that can be grasped in a short time. The learner and the transmitter must remain together, practicing constantly while receiving guidance at every turn. If errors arise, they must be corrected immediately; if flaws appear, they must be removed at once. Only then can one hope to reach the stage of perfection.

**Question Eight:**
The alchemical classics state, *"Set up the furnace, move the crucible, and establish the Celestial Cycle."* Where exactly are the furnace and crucible to be placed? Some say they are set in the Central Palace—is this correct?

**Answer:**
The furnace is the *Kun* furnace, located in the lower region; the crucible is the *Qian* crucible, situated in the upper region. The Central Palace is not the place for setting up the furnace and crucible.

**Question Nine:**
*"When the elixir is ripe, fire phases need not be applied; if fire phases are still applied, the elixir will be harmed."* What exactly constitutes the ripeness of the elixir?

**Answer:**
The ripeness of the elixir refers to the point at which the elixir has already formed. At this stage, one should focus on gentle fire for nurturing and not employ fierce fire for intense refinement. If one continues to refine with the same intensity as before, the formed elixir will be unable to stabilize in its place, risking dispersal or loss. Not only will all prior efforts be wasted, but grave illness may also arise.

**Question Ten:**
Master Chongxu said, *"When the elixir is ripe, pass through the barriers, ingest it, and enter the divine chamber to practice the Great Celestial Cycle for nurturing with fire."* Is this teaching accurate?

**Answer:**
It is entirely accurate.

Further Response to Ms. Chen Wuxuan’s Inquiry on Preserving the Achievement After Slaying the Red Dragon

By Yuandunzi

Last month, I received your letter but had no time to reply. Now, I specially set aside this moment to write these few lines, hoping to ease your distant longing.

This kind of work is a living method, not a rigid one. It must adapt to each person’s physical constitution and circumstances. Those who transmit the Dao often teach rigid methods, leading to strange illnesses—all because they fail to adapt. No matter what oral instructions one follows, every benefit carries a potential harm. Stubborn teachers paired with dull disciples often bring harm before any benefit is gained.

When a physician prescribes medicine to treat an illness, they must carefully examine the patient in person. If one merely inquires about symptoms and dispenses remedies, danger cannot be avoided. How much more so for such great matters as contending with the transformations of creation and the profound mysteries beyond even ghosts and spirits? How can one resolve them without a single face-to-face encounter, relying only on a few letters of inquiry? If illness arises, who will bear the blame?

Thus, the only guidance I can offer you on paper is these four words: *"embrace the One and guard the center."*

*"Embrace the One"* means that the heart and breath depend on each other, and spirit and qi unite without separation.

*"Guard the center"* means that after spirit and qi unite, one abides in perfect stillness within the central palace, returning to the primal chaos before heaven and earth existed.

This is the highest-grade elixir method—beneficial without harm. Since the Red Dragon has already been slain, it is fitting to continue with this work. If one can reach its most profound and wondrous state, one may transcend the cycle of rebirth and rise above the turning of kalpas, standing shoulder to shoulder with sages, immortals, and buddhas. Looking down upon the realms of humans and gods, one plays freely with life and death, and trivial transformations of this illusory flesh-body become no concern at all.

*"When the Dao is spoken, it seems as bland as if it had no flavor."* If you are of superior root and sharp capacity, you will surely trust these words.

**Appendix: Original Letter from Ms. Chen Wuxuan**

Respectfully submitted,

Last month, I was already enlightened by your teachings in this publication, and you further graciously copied and sent me the *"Song of the Great Dao of the Spiritual Source."* The blockage in my heart has gradually opened. How can I ever express my gratitude for such kindness and virtue?

I should not presume to trouble you further, but should quietly await the right moment and reverently follow your instructions.

Yet your disciple, acutely aware of the critical importance of the *Fire Talisman* and the peril of its loss, cannot but make repeated entreaties.

In recent months, there has been some consolation: the dragon has been slain and has not returned. Yet as the *Fire Talisman* remains obscure in its depths and workings, I secretly fear that what has been gained may yet be lost, and what has departed may yet return. Thus I urgently beseech you, Master, to bestow great compassion, look down with pity, and reveal a hint of the celestial mechanism—transmit but one true formula—so that I may attain the ultimate in elixir refinement and ascend the true path of the Perfected. Then I shall not waste years in vain, nor bear the empty name of cultivation.

Looking back upon the aspirations I expressed earlier, I now see how they might invite the reproach of boastful words. Upon reading the venerable discourse on the reality of ascension in the seventy-fourth issue of this publication—where not a single soul has yet succeeded—I realize how my dull and clumsy faculties led me to rashly declare such transcendent ambitions, surely provoking the laughter of the wise.

I prostrate myself before you, Master, whose learning spans all schools and whose resolve to deliver sentient beings is unmatched in ancient or modern times, in China or beyond. With but a single foolish impulse, I have secluded myself to practice quietude and presumptuously pursued the Way of the Real, yet have failed to present myself before you to reverently receive your teachings—how deep is my shame!

Herein I record several doubts and humbly implore you, Master, to generously bestow your vast wisdom and provide detailed instruction. The secret celestial mechanisms I especially entreat you to address in writing. Should I ever treat these teachings with disrespect or transmit them lightly, I vow to suffer the destruction of my body.

I dare not make such bold requests lightly, but only fear repeating past mistakes. If you would deign to look upon this lowly one with compassion and indulge my foolish sincerity, I would be infinitely grateful.

I beseech you to graciously elucidate the ten questions listed below. Should you condescend to grant my plea, my gratitude would know no bounds. With reverence, I prostrate myself and bow a hundred times.

Your disciple, Chen Wuxuan of Chahé Town, west of Baoying Lake, respectfully submits.

**Reply to Ms. Chen Wuxuan of Chahé Town, Baoying**
*Yuandunzi*

Having received your previous letter introducing Ms. Zhang Zhide, who has practiced the art since severing the Red Dragon, she personally sought me out in the countryside last month and stayed for two days. I explained to her in broad terms the advance and retreat of the *yang fire* and *yin tally*, as well as the circulation of breath in ascent and descent. Though her literacy is limited, her practice is indeed commendable. Now forty-one years of age, her monthly courses have ceased for three years. Regarding the subtle conditions within her body—which I found improper to inquire about directly—my wife, Yizhu, acted as intermediary, relaying my questions. Her past bodily experiences align perfectly with the oral instructions I have received, confirming she is no deceiver. As a practitioner of substance, her foundation is already firm, so she grasped my teachings at once. She far surpasses more learned women in this regard—a most encouraging development. She departed content, though I regret not obtaining her address. I hear she rents a garret in Yangshupu, Shanghai, cooking for herself and living independently, not residing at the Tang residence. Have you heard of this? Your seclusion period remains unfulfilled, so it is best not to emerge prematurely, lest the vulgar mock you.

The operation of *yang fire* and *yin tally* belongs to the *youwei* method, emphasizing the word *"refine."* The subtleties of *embracing the One* and *guarding the center* belong to the *wuwei* method, emphasizing the word *"nurture."* The *youwei* method cannot encompass *wuwei*, but *wuwei* can encompass *youwei*. What I shared with Ms. Zhang pertains to mid-level alchemical practice, whereas what I previously conveyed to you in this journal constitutes the supreme attainment. Take care not to dismiss it with disdain or harbor dissatisfaction.

**Further Reply to Ms. Chen Wuxuan Regarding Post-Severing the Red Dragon**
*Yuandunzi*

I received your letter last month but had no time to respond. I now take this moment to pen these few lines, hoping to ease your distant longing.

This practice is a living method, not a rigid one. It must adapt to each person’s physical constitution and circumstances, flexibly adjusting as needed. Those who transmit the Dao often teach rigid methods, frequently causing strange illnesses—all due to their failure to adapt. No matter what oral instructions are given, every advantage carries a corresponding disadvantage. When stubborn teachers encounter dull-witted disciples, the harm often precedes the benefit. A physician prescribing medicine must carefully examine the patient in person; if treatment is given merely by inquiring about symptoms, danger may arise. How much more so with such great matters as contending with the transformations of creation and the unfathomable mysteries beyond even spirits and gods? How can one resolve them without face-to-face guidance, relying only on a few letters of inquiry? If illness arises from practice, who will bear the responsibility?

Thus, what I can convey to you on paper today are only these four words: *"embracing the One and guarding the center."* *"Embracing the One"* means that the heart and breath depend on each other, spirit and qi unite without separation. *"Guarding the center"* means that after *"spirit and qi unite,"* one abides in profound stillness within the central palace, returning to the primordial state of chaos before heaven and earth existed. This is the supreme alchemical method, offering only benefit and no harm. Now that the Red Dragon has been severed, it is the perfect time to continue this practice. If one can reach its most profound and wondrous depths, one may transcend the cycle of rebirth and rise above the turning of kalpas, standing shoulder to shoulder with sages, immortals, and buddhas—looking down upon the heavens and humanity, playing freely with life and death. Trivial changes in the physical body then become insignificant.

*"The Dao spoken aloud is bland, as if without flavor."* If you are of superior capacity and sharp faculties, you will surely believe these words.

**Appendix: Original Letter from Ms. Chen Wuxuan**
Respectfully,
Since you graciously instructed me in the previous issue and also transcribed and sent the *"Song of the Great Dao of the Spiritual Source,"* the obstructions in my heart have gradually dissolved. How can I ever repay such kindness and virtue? I ought not to trouble you further but should instead await the right moment in quiet reverence. Yet I humbly await your guidance.

Yet your disciple, acutely aware of the urgency of the *Fire Talisman* and the peril of its loss, cannot but make repeated entreaties. In recent months, there has been some cause for reassurance: the *Red Dragon* has been severed yet has not returned. Still, as the true essence and subtleties of the *Fire Talisman* remain unclear to me, I secretly fear that what has been gained may yet be lost, and what has departed may yet return. Thus, I urgently beseech you, Master, to bestow your boundless compassion, look upon me with mercy, and deign to reveal a glimpse of the celestial mechanism, to transmit the true oral formula—so that I may grasp the ultimate principle of *elixir refinement* and ascend the true path of transcendence. This way, I may avoid squandering years in vain and escape the hollow pretense of cultivation.

Looking back upon the aspirations I expressed earlier, I now see them as no small boast, inviting ridicule. Upon reading the esteemed discourse on the reality of ascension in the seventy-fourth issue of this publication—where it is stated that not a single soul has yet achieved it—I realize that my dull and clumsy faculties have led me to rashly proclaim such lofty ambitions, surely provoking the scorn of those of true attainment.

Prostrate before you, Master, whose learning encompasses all schools and whose resolve to deliver sentient beings is unmatched in past or present, in China or beyond: I, in my foolish sincerity, have secluded myself to cultivate stillness and vainly pursued the Way of the Real, yet have failed to present myself before you to reverently receive your teachings. How deep is my remorse!

Herein, I humbly submit several questions, earnestly imploring you, Master, to bestow your vast grace and provide detailed instruction. The secret celestial mechanisms I especially entreat you to expound in writing. Should I ever treat these teachings with disdain or transmit them carelessly, I vow to suffer the destruction of my very being. I dare not make such bold requests lightly—only that I dread repeating past mistakes. If you would deign to look upon my sincerity with compassion and forgive my ignorance, I would be infinitely grateful.

I beseech you to graciously address each of the ten questions listed. Should you grant this request, my gratitude would know no bounds. With utmost reverence, I prostrate myself and bow a hundred times.

Your disciple from West Fork River, Baoying Lake,
Chen Wuxuan, bows her head in submission.

In response to the Venerable Zhang Huikun of Chicheng, Tiantai,
The Perfected One of Sudden Enlightenment.

The previous letter forwarded by the *Xian Dao Monthly* contained points not without reason, yet regrettably, you had not thoroughly studied the entirety of *Yang Shan Journal*. Had you, at the time, examined each issue in sequence from the first to the ninety-ninth, the editorial aims of the journal—and the gradual evolution of its style—would have become perfectly clear to you, leaving no room for doubt.

All the essays in *Yang Shan Semi-Monthly* debating the doctrines of immortals and buddhas were written from a defensive position, compelled by necessity. Otherwise, who would idly waste ink and brush? Layman Zhang Huasheng was a devotee of the Three Teachings—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—neither favoring immortals nor slighting buddhas. Thus, his writings consistently sought to harmonize the teachings of immortals and buddhas. Alas, certain parties deliberately sought to create a monolithic following, refusing to tolerate Huasheng’s efforts at reconciliation. They insisted on elevating Buddhism above both Confucianism and Daoism, forcing Huasheng to rise in opposition. This led to many complications, though such was never his original intent.

Alas! Whose fault was this?

In all times and places, for every school of thought, there will always be proponents, opponents, and reconcilers. Take, for example, the teachings of immortals and the Dao: I and my fellow believers belong to the camp of proponents. Those who slander these teachings are numerous, all falling into the camp of opponents. Then there are figures like Huasheng and Zhuqian, as well as Zunxian, who belong to the camp of reconcilers. In all matters and principles under heaven, these three camps inevitably intermingle, and none can eliminate the others. Only one can eliminate oneself. If one endures slander without rebuttal, it is as if one has eliminated oneself. While we have no intention of attacking others, we also refuse to eliminate ourselves. Thus, the debates over the similarities and differences between immortals and buddhas arise. This is the natural course of events, nothing strange at all.

The ancient authors of Daoist texts were, in essence, of the reconciling disposition. Hence, their works often intermingled terminology from Confucianism and Buddhism, yet Confucians paid them no heed, having long tacitly accepted this. The opposing camp, however, sought to create a monolithic following to elevate the status of their own teachings and thus rejected such reconciliatory works, sparing no effort to suppress them. As for us, we strive to preserve the independent standing of the study of immortals, lest it be belittled by the opposing camp, and so we are unwilling to indiscriminately adopt Buddhist terminology.

What perplexes us most is that the Daoist texts popular during the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties were all written in the reconciliatory style. They freely borrowed terminology from all Three Teachings, with few works maintaining a singular purity. Thus, in the Daoist texts I have edited and published, though I have already revised and removed many Buddhist terms, some inevitably remain. To excise them entirely would risk distorting the original texts. Only when I compose my own Daoist works in the future will I be able to avoid Buddhist terminology entirely.

Moreover, ancient Daoist texts such as the *Daodejing* of Laozi, the *Nanhua Jing* of Zhuangzi, the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, the inner chapters of the *Baopuzi*, and the *Huangting Neijing* and *Waijing* contain no Buddhist terminology, which is why the older the Daoist text, the better. The only drawback is that the language of ancient works is often too abstruse for easy comprehension.

*The Rekindling of the Lute’s Fire* is a specialized text on external alchemy. Without having received the true transmission and practical experience in the furnace and fire of external alchemy, one will certainly fail to understand it. This book was published by the Alchemical Scripture Engraving Society, and I merely contributed modest efforts in proofreading. After its publication, the society’s staff presented me with several copies as remuneration, which I have long since distributed to those who study external alchemy.

*(Yu Yang’s note: *The Rekindling of the Lute’s Fire* is an exceedingly rare text, scarcely circulated within or beyond our borders. The Alchemical Scripture Engraving Society, fearing its eventual loss, undertook its publication to preserve this national treasure. I am deeply humbled by the honor of receiving this profound work from Master Yuan, and I dare not forget his kindness. Ashamed of my own inadequacy, I have neither had the leisure to study it thoroughly in the past nor, amidst these times of turmoil, the opportunity to attempt its practice. As I review it now, I cannot help but feel a lingering sorrow.)*

As I no longer have a copy on hand, I regret that I cannot present one to you. I hope you will forgive me. In my humble opinion, those who practice internal alchemy need not read books on external alchemy, for they pertain to an entirely different matter, bearing no relation to our bodies and only wasting mental effort.

The Immortal Studies Institute has been in operation since May of the twenty-seventh year of the solar calendar, completing its first year amid constant instability. Thus, no formal regulations have been established, nor have any fellow Daoists taken residence here. Whether it will continue in the future remains uncertain. As inquiries have come from fellow Daoists in other regions, I shall provide a general response here.

**Reply to a Lady from Anyang, Henan:**
I have read your letter with care. That you, at just over twenty years of age and having received a modern education, have wholeheartedly embraced this Way and resolved to pursue it is truly remarkable. Though circumstances may temporarily hinder your aspirations, where there is resolve, success is only a matter of time—do not be anxious. Such matters require the convergence of opportunity, the fullness of both fortune and wisdom, before one may hope to attain the goal. The more one frets, the less effective one becomes.

Consider this: as an ordinary mortal of flesh and blood, if you aspire to accomplish earth-shaking deeds, how must you cultivate deep perseverance and unyielding resolve? How must you embody fluid adaptability and perfect harmony? How must you endure every hardship and trial? How must you maintain equanimity amid adversity and change? Can such things be rushed? If you grow impatient, you risk afflicting your nerves—and all prior efforts may be undone. Would that not be a pity?

Regarding dual cultivation practice, it must only commence after the "Dragon-Slaying" stage to ensure stability. Otherwise, should the partner’s practice momentarily falter, losing their power of steadfast endurance, it would be as Zhang Sanfeng the Perfected One said: *"On the rapids’ edge, one cannot hold back the boat."* Thus, the immortal embryo may fail to form while the mortal embryo takes root, adding yet another layer of demonic obstruction.

After bearing children, one may naturally resume cultivation to restore the original state, yet compared to the time before childbirth, this inevitably introduces many complications and lacks the former ease. As for age differences, these certainly matter. However, if the partner’s internal cultivation runs deep, even a twofold age gap poses no harm. For instance, if through their labor they earn one hundred yuan, and they assist you with fifty, they still retain fifty for themselves. If through your labor you earn two hundred yuan, even if you assist them with one hundred, you still keep one hundred for yourself. In this way, both parties hold one hundred fifty yuan in savings. The next time, and every time thereafter—whether dozens or hundreds of repetitions—the outcome remains the same.

After several years pass, the two of you may become wealthy, but what is to be feared is depleting your principal rather than earning new wealth. After several years of spending, your capital will be exhausted, and poverty will immediately follow—this would truly be untenable! Such is the principle of dual cultivation. The ancients never spoke of it plainly; today, I have revealed but a fraction. This is already an unprecedented discourse—take heed.

**Appendix: Original Letter from a Certain Lady of Anyang**
To the Venerable Master Yuandun,

Since graduating from a women’s normal school in Henan, this disciple has felt the impermanence of worldly affairs and the unpredictability of life, thus harboring no affinity for the red dust and constantly cherishing the intent to cultivate the Dao. I have perused works such as *The Complete Works of Patriarch Lü*, *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality*, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, *The Great Compendium of the Daoist Tradition*, *The Laozi’s Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, and various texts on women’s cultivation. Yet without true oral instructions, all remains in vain.

Unexpectedly, upon receiving the recently subscribed *Biweekly for Promoting Goodness*, I found my teacher’s vast learning, profound Dao, and towering virtue so deeply admirable that I prostrate myself in utmost reverence. In recent days, my longing for the Dao has grown even more fervent—I am as if entranced, forgetting sleep and meals, and yearn to present myself before your esteemed presence to receive the authentic transmission. Alas, constrained by circumstances, I cannot fulfill this wish, which is truly regrettable.

This disciple plans, after "severing the Red Dragon," to spare no sacrifice or hardship and resolutely pay homage to your honorable countenance. I implore my teacher to bestow great compassion, take pity on this woman (for women face greater difficulties in cultivation, often burdened by family ties, and with limited knowledge, seldom encounter enlightened masters), and secretly transmit the oral instructions. Should I attain any accomplishment in the future, it will all be by your grace. My gratitude is beyond words.

With deepest respect, I wish you peace in the Dao.

Below, I list further details of my circumstances:
1. I cultivate at home.
2. I have been married for several years, but my partner also practices the Dao and has long severed worldly attachments.
3. I am currently twenty-four years old, and my partner is forty-eight, though in robust health. May I inquire whether dual cultivation is feasible?
4. Only my birth mother is alive; I have one elder sister and one younger brother. I have no children and have decided against having any to avoid hindering my cultivation.
5. My family circumstances are sustainable.
6. I have read some texts from the Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist traditions.
7. I have generally read all available books on women’s cultivation, though regrettably, such works are scarce in circulation and insufficient to meet demand.
8. My aspiration is to "ascend in broad daylight." What I fear is the unpredictability of worldly affairs—should I suffer unforeseen harm and my body be damaged, my goal would remain unattainable. Were it not for this, my resolve would surpass that of men a hundredfold.

**Yundun’s Addendum:** Since you have graduated from a women’s normal school, your command of classical Chinese must be excellent. The reason I have not accepted female disciples in the past is precisely because their level is generally too shallow to enter the gate. Your resolve to study immortality and the breadth of your reading set you apart from ordinary women of conventional households. Here, I present you with a topic of considerable relevance to the study of immortality. Please compose an essay for the appreciation of fellow cultivators. The topic is as follows: *"On the Similarities and Differences in the Fundamental Tenets of the Four Schools: Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Immortality Cultivation."*

**Answers to Thirteen Questions from a Lady in Shanghai**
**By Yundunzi**

**Question One:** Are the initial steps of practice the same for men and women?
**Answer:** According to what I consider the most stable and sublime method, the initial steps of practice are identical for men and women. As one progresses, however, differences gradually emerge due to the natural distinctions in male and female physiology, not by human design.

**Question Two:** When practicing the *"Severing the Red Dragon"* technique, how many hours should one practice daily? How long does it take to fully sever the Red Dragon? After severing it, what practice should follow, and is there a clear stage of completion?
**Answer:** For formal practice of this technique, one should engage in four sessions daily, each lasting two hours—eight hours in total, or four *shi* (double-hours). The swift may achieve severance in half a year, while others may require a full year. After severance, one naturally advances to the next stage of practice. Beginners, however, should not yet concern themselves with this. Once the menstrual cycle is refined and ceased, the practice may be considered complete for that stage. If one chooses not to continue, resting for several years is permissible, provided proper preservation is maintained. Otherwise, if the cycle returns after cessation, additional effort will be required.

**Question Three:** Is there a fixed limit to daily practice time, or is more always better? What are the most suitable times for practice, or can one practice at any time?
**Answer:** Certain minor methods require adherence to specific *shi* (double-hours). For superior methods, however, no fixed time is necessary. Practicing four *shi* (eight hours) daily is sufficient; excessive practice may lead to aversion and subsequent obstacles. There is no single optimal time for practice, though it is inadvisable to practice immediately after eating or when fatigued and drowsy.

**Question Four:** In refining the elixir, should one adhere to a vegetarian diet, consume meat, or is either acceptable? Are there particular foods to favor or avoid? Do cultivators require air and sunlight in the same way as ordinary people?
**Answer:** While a vegetarian diet is pure, it should not be overly bland. Meat, though nourishing, should not be consumed in excess, especially strong-smelling varieties. Among vegetarian foods, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and fresh fungi—though palatable—are prone to inducing illness and should be avoided. Seasonings such as MSG, flavoring powders, and soy sauce concentrates are also inadvisable. If consuming meat, one may occasionally eat chicken, duck, fish, and eggs, but other meats should be minimized. Air must be exceptionally clean, free from dust, coal smoke, foul odors, and impurities. Indoor air should circulate freely; doors and windows should not be tightly sealed. Sunlight is naturally beneficial, but in a meditation chamber, it should not be too bright—slight dimness helps settle the spirit. If full sunlight is needed, one may go outside to absorb it.

**Question Five:**

**Question Five:**
At what maximum age can women no longer cultivate? At what maximum age can men no longer cultivate? Or, if one obtains the proper method, may cultivation proceed regardless of age?

**Answer:**
By ordinary reasoning, men at sixty-four and women around fifty, when *tian gui* (heavenly essence) is nearly exhausted, find it difficult to practice *minggong* (life-cultivation). Yet this is a rigid principle and cannot be taken as absolute. The marvelous arts of immortals lie in rejuvenation and creation from nothing—seizing the power of transformation from Heaven through human effort. If one remains bound by age, awaiting death with folded hands, then the arts of immortality are hardly worthy of esteem.

**Question Six:**
In a bimonthly publication, I read that “men cultivate to achieve non-leakage of essence, while women cultivate to achieve non-leakage of menses.” Does “non-leakage of menses” refer to the practice of “severing the red dragon”? And how is “non-leakage of essence” in men to be understood?

**Answer:**
“Women cultivating to achieve non-leakage of menses” indeed refers to the practice of severing the red dragon. “Men cultivating to achieve non-leakage of essence” means the permanent absence of seminal emission through masturbation, nocturnal emission, urinary incontinence, or intercourse.

**Question Seven:**
Cultivation is divided into *xinggong* (nature-cultivation) and *minggong* (life-cultivation). Which of the three stages—“refining essence into *qi*,” “refining *qi* into spirit,” and “refining spirit to return to emptiness”—pertains to *xinggong*, and which to *minggong*? Or are all three *minggong*, with *xinggong* following a separate method?

**Answer:**
In superior cultivation, *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) are originally inseparable. The distinction between *xinggong* and *minggong* is merely a provisional teaching. For the sake of guiding beginners, we may temporarily classify “refining essence into *qi*” as *minggong*, “refining *qi* into spirit” as half *minggong* and half *xinggong*, and “refining spirit to return to emptiness” as entirely *xinggong*.

**Question Eight:**
If one cultivates only *xing* and not *ming*, can one attain longevity? If not, how does the outcome differ from that of an ordinary person? Is there a distinction between “longevity without death” and “ascending to Heaven in broad daylight”?

**Answer:**
The effect of longevity arises from the practice of *minggong*. Without *minggong*, longevity is impossible. Those who cultivate only *xinggong* will nonetheless differ from ordinary people in their end: some may die without illness, some may foreknow their time of death, some may pass away in seated meditation, and some may seize another’s body for rebirth—all feats beyond the reach of ordinary people. “Longevity without death” is but an initial effect, while “ascending to Heaven in broad daylight” is the ultimate result, with profound differences in their levels.

**Question Nine:**
Daoist texts speak of the “four essentials”—method, wealth, companions, and place. Regarding the matter of wealth, what is the ideal amount required for perfection, and what is the minimum necessary?

**Answer:**
This question concerns practical matters, not abstract theory. A few words cannot suffice; a detailed analysis is needed.

Based on Shanghai’s cost of living, rent amounts to forty yuan per month, food to thirty yuan, and miscellaneous expenses to thirty yuan—totaling one hundred yuan in monthly expenditures, which suffices. At the very least, fifty yuan per month is required; anything less would likely be impossible. If one leaves Shanghai for a lower-cost city elsewhere, fifty yuan per month would suffice in place of Shanghai’s one hundred. For instance, fifteen yuan for rent, fifteen for food, and twenty for miscellaneous expenses would already constitute a comfortable standard of living outside Shanghai. If one departs from urban areas altogether and resides in a mountain monastery among renunciates, with lodging and meals entirely managed by the monastic community, thirty yuan per month would suffice.

The above calculations apply to individuals. For a group, expenditures may be reduced: the more people involved, the lower the cost per person; the fewer the people, the higher the cost—an inverse proportion. My usual advocacy for collective organization stems precisely from the aim of reducing expenses for fellow practitioners, though the conditions for this have yet to fully ripen. Some individuals, capable of enduring hardship, may further reduce their expenditures, while others, seeking comfort, may require even more.

The above estimates pertain to a moderate standard of living—neither ascetic nor indulgent. They do not include medical expenses, social obligations, or travel costs. Furthermore, personal expenditures such as those for one’s family—parents, spouse, or children—are entirely separate matters.

**Question Ten:** If circumstances permit, one abandons all worldly concerns with unwavering resolve and encounters no unforeseen obstacles, how many years would be required to achieve success in cultivation?
**Answer:** To restore the body to health and freedom from illness takes approximately three years. The work of "severing the Red Dragon" requires another two. Beyond that, progress depends on circumstances and cannot be predetermined. Moreover, this applies specifically to you; for another individual, the timeline would differ.

**Question Eleven:** Many Daoist adepts also practice martial arts. Does practicing martial arts benefit or harm the Dao of internal alchemy?
**Answer:** If practiced naturally and in harmony, it may offer some benefit. But if pursued recklessly or with brute force, it risks causing injury. However, each person’s constitution differs, so no universal rule applies. Given your current physical condition, martial arts may not be advisable; it would be better to focus solely on quiet nurturing.

**Question Twelve:** Internal alchemy distinguishes between solitary and dual cultivation. Which is more advantageous, which more harmful? Which is superior, which inferior? Which yields faster results, which slower?
**Answer:** This is a major question that has remained unresolved since the Han dynasty. Circumstances—environment, family, age, era, customs, propriety, law, morality, religious belief, scholarly pursuits, gender, innate capacity, and lineage of transmission—vary so widely that they naturally diverge into two distinct paths. I cannot favor one over the other.

I have read hundreds of texts advocating exclusively for dual cultivation or solitary practice. Over the past thirty-seven years, I have encountered countless individuals devoted to one or the other. Each path has its own advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses—how could I presume to judge or critique them?

If I were to praise dual cultivation while disparaging solitary practice, only those with ample resources or householders with spouses could pursue it. What of those facing financial hardship or renunciates? To claim that poverty precludes cultivation unless one first amasses wealth, or that monastic life precludes cultivation unless one first returns to lay life, would discourage the determined and diminish the spirit of the noble—words I cannot bear to utter.

For further discussion, refer to *Yangshan Journal*, Issue 74, page 6, in responses to Mr. Zhang Daochu of Suzhou (Questions 3, 4, and 6), and Issue 76, page 8, in the letter to a certain physician on internal alchemy.

Let us set aside internal alchemy for now and speak of human affairs. Consider this: Is it better for a person to marry or remain single during their decades of life? This, too, is not easily answered. Marriage has its benefits and drawbacks, and the circumstances are complex. One cannot impose a rigid or authoritarian view, for it would leave others unconvinced.

Those who insist on solitary cultivation or dual cultivation, dismissing all else, are no different from despots and autocrats.

**Question Thirteen:** In internal alchemy, should one abstain from desire entirely, moderate it, or does sexual activity have no bearing on the practice?
**Answer:** For those who embrace celibacy, this is not an issue. For those with a spouse, the matter warrants consideration.

"Abstinence" means complete cessation, which requires mutual consent; if one party disagrees, it cannot be achieved. "Moderation" means exercising restraint without excess, which is easier to practice and more aligned with human nature. However, it still poses obstacles to dedicated internal alchemy.

Ordinary sexual relations between men and women are crude, scarcely different from lower animals. Compared to the Dao of immortality, the difference is as vast as heaven and earth. If one does not seek a profound and mysterious method to reverse the course of nature, but instead follows humanity’s inherited base instincts, acting impulsively, how can one escape the cycle of rebirth and shatter the immutable laws of birth, aging, sickness, and death?

Since I have not sought your consent, I will not disclose your name. If you have no objection, future questions and answers may be published under your real name, as was done with Ms. Chen Wuxuan of Baoying, who granted permission.

**Letter from a Lady in Anyang, Henan Province, with Responses**

To the Venerable Master Yuandun,

I was overjoyed to receive your reply in *Yangshan Journal* to my previous letter. Your words—"The more urgently one seeks results, the less they manifest; one must await the convergence of conditions" and "Only with both merit and wisdom can the Dao be realized"—are indeed immutable truths, valid for all time.

In the closing section, where you discussed the methods of dual cultivation, though you did not explicitly reveal the oral instructions, I was nevertheless able to grasp the underlying meaning. It was as if I had awakened from a dream, my long-standing confusion suddenly dispelled—I am overwhelmed with gratitude, which lingers without cease.

As for the topic you assigned, *"On the Differences and Similarities in the Core Tenets of the Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist, and Immortalist Traditions,"* asking me to compose an essay for fellow seekers of the Way to appreciate, I feel utterly unworthy of the task. Though I have glanced at a few texts from these four traditions, I have not studied them in depth. For how could one dare to speak recklessly of Confucian *loyalty and forbearance*, Buddhist *compassion*, Daoist *resonance*, or the Immortalists’ *nature and emotions* without profound scholarship and abundant experience? I dare not risk exposing my inadequacies and becoming a laughingstock, thus failing to meet your high expectations! *(The rest is omitted.)*

**Additional Query:**
Previously, while reading the sixth item in the general principles of *Master Sun Bu’er’s Annotated Poems on the Female Elixir*, I came across the statement: *"For women cultivating immortality, aside from the Celestial Origin’s ingestion of essences, all other methods are obstructed."* Your disciple remains unclear about this reference to the *Celestial Origin’s ingestion of essences*—I humbly request your guidance.

**Yuandun’s Response:**
Regarding the *Celestial Origin’s ingestion of essences*, you may first refer to the section on the *Danyang Chen lineage* in *"Correspondence with Physician Zhu Changya on Immortalist Studies"* under the *Theoretical Research* column in this issue. Then, consult the third question in *"Responses to Fifteen Queries from Daoist Zhang Daochu of Suzhou"* on page six of *Yangshan Journal*, Issue 74. These should provide a general understanding.

**Letter from a Lady in Shanghai, with Responses**

Yuandunzi (omitting prior text):

On the morning of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, at three o’clock, after sitting in meditation for a short while, I soon felt warmth at the *hai di* (perineum). After some time, the warmth spread to the navel wheel and breasts. Simultaneously, the crown of the head and feet grew hot and began to twitch. When stillness reached its utmost, I entered a state of primordial chaos—though this lasted but a moment. Such occurrences repeated six times. By the seventh, I suddenly felt my entire body contract, as if anesthetized, even my breath becoming unnatural. At that time, my head and chest grew intensely hot, nearly breaking into sweat, while the *wei lü* (coccyx) and spine felt unbearably heavy. I then applied the *Three Unmoving Method* to address it, enduring for twenty minutes before gradually easing. My breath also returned to normal. The above occurred on the third day after menstruation, much like the previous instance I reported in person—also on the third day after menstruation. The difference was that last time I sweated, whereas this time I did not reach that stage, though the duration was longer.

**Five Questions Attached**

**Question One:**
Before and after my menstrual period, I often feel warmth and swelling with twitching in the *xue hai* (Sea of Blood) and yin region, accompanied by soreness and numbness in both legs. Is this the stirring of *zhen yin* (true yin)? Though I attempt to gather and withdraw it with intent, sometimes I fail to contain it. I humbly request the oral instructions for absorption to prevent its loss and irretrievable escape.

**Answer One:**
This phenomenon closely resembles the stirring of *zhen yin*, though its qi is not yet sufficiently vigorous. To gather it back is not difficult—simply apply the *Three Unmoving Method*, which will suffice.

**Question Two:**
When circulating qi with intent through the *Microcosmic Orbit*, from the *wei lü* ascending to the *ding men* (crown), then descending from the crown—where should it stop? Does the speed of ascent and descent matter? Is it permissible to practice this during menstruation?

**Answer Two:**
Descend from the crown to the *zi gong* (uterus) and stop there. Initially, the ascent and descent should be slow, not fast. During menstruation, it is best not to practice circulation, though quiet sitting is permissible.

**Question Three:**
In *Ten Principles of Female Alchemy*, may I practice the *Nine Cycles of Refining Form* method?

**Answer Three:**
If you wish to attempt the movements as described in the text, you may do so, but proceed with utmost caution and avoid forcing it. If it arises naturally and harmoniously, that is best; otherwise, it is better to fall short than to overdo it.

**Question Four:**
When saliva arises in the mouth, where should it be swallowed?

**Answer Four:**
Swallow it as you would tea, directing it to the stomach. If someone claims there is another path, they do not understand human physiology—do not believe such talk.

**Question Five:**
As my weak constitution gradually recovers, may I be granted the formal oral instructions for *"Severing the Red Dragon"* to follow in cultivation and advance my practice?

**Answer Five:**
First study *The Authentic Methods of Female Practice* and the *Severing the Dragon* techniques in *Ten Principles of Female Alchemy*. When convenient, you may attempt them, but proceed gently and avoid forcing it, lest you deviate from the proper path and incur illness. After thirty months of practice, observe the changes. If any transformations occur, write to report them—or we may discuss in person. Should errors arise, correct them promptly.

*Correspondence with Physician Zhu Changya on Immortalist Studies*

Yuantunzi to Physician Changya, with kind regards:

I recently received the letter you sent to my wife Yizhu, along with four poems. From them, I learned of your noble aspiration to transcend the mundane—so unlike the mediocre masses, who cling to shallow habits and neglect long-term reflection. This is truly admirable!

In your fourth poem, you wrote:
*"Among mortals there are extraordinary men and women,
Who set their resolve to ascend to the Ninth Heaven."*
I most heartily endorse these two lines. Though such an endeavor is exceedingly difficult and rarely realized, when we peruse the biographies of immortals across the ages, we find that in every dynasty, a few have succeeded. This alone suggests it is not entirely hopeless. Even if all the records of old are false, there is no reason we cannot pioneer the way ourselves. How much more so when the ancients have left behind guiding principles for us to follow?

During the two hundred and more years of the Qing dynasty, the finest minds among men were shackled by the eight-legged essay, while the brightest women were constrained by outdated rituals. Not only did they dare not test the arts of immortality in practice, but they scarcely dared speak of them. They were forbidden not only from seeking teachers or like-minded friends but even from reading the relevant texts. (Around the age of ten, I took pleasure in reading *The Biographies of Divine Immortals* by Ge Hong in the *Han-Wei Congshu*, but I dared not let my elders know—had they found out, I would surely have been severely reprimanded.)

Thus, the cautious and dutiful flocked to Confucianism, while those seeking liberation turned to Buddhism. Confucianism, though grounded in common sense, often degenerates into rigidity and pedantry. Buddhism, though seemingly profound, falters in its failure to recognize the reality of human life. (Buddhism regards life as illusory, fostering a disdain for the body, yet it cannot escape the very physical necessities of "clothing, food, shelter, and movement"—matters intimately tied to the body. To deem life illusory while still striving to sustain it is a glaring contradiction.)

Daoism comprises two major schools: the Orthodox Unity (Zhengyi) and the Complete Perfection (Quanzhen). The former is the older tradition, while the latter emerged only after the Yuan dynasty. Both have since declined into obscurity, and there is no need to discuss them in depth. Having devoted over thirty years to the study of immortals’ arts, those who know me well understand my position entirely, while others may suspect that, in this age of science, I am merely promoting superstition. In truth, I harbor no superstition whatsoever; I simply recognize that the study of immortality can remedy the deficiencies of human life, and its capacity surpasses all worldly sciences. Whatever problems ordinary science cannot resolve, the arts of immortality can. Moreover, it is grounded in practical, step-by-step practice—unlike Confucianism, which offers no path beyond mere moral conduct; unlike Buddhism, which provides no method beyond chanting the Buddha’s name; unlike the Orthodox Unity school of Daoism, with its talismans and incantations; and unlike the Complete Perfection school, with its repentance rituals and scripture recitations. Thus, the arts of immortality possess an independent character, lying beyond the scope of the Three Teachings, though adherents of any of the Three Teachings may freely pursue them.

Historically, Confucians who studied immortality include the great Han dynasty scholar Liu Xiang and the Song dynasty master Shao Yong. Buddhists who did the same include the Song dynasty Chan master Xue Daoguang and the Qing dynasty Chan master Liu Huayang. Daoists who pursued immortality are too numerous to count. Beyond these, figures such as Prince Wang Ziqiao of the Zhou dynasty, the favored courtier Dongfang Shuo of Emperor Wu of Han, the minor official Ma Mingsheng of Qi, the aristocrat Yin Changsheng of the Han, the recluse Wei Boyang, the thaumaturge Zuo Yuanfang, the Tang dynasty scholar Lü Chunyang, the Yan dynasty prime minister Liu Haichan, the general Zhongli Quan, and the magistrate Zhang Sanfeng—all of whom, according to popular tradition, are acknowledged as immortals—were laypersons, not monastics. They were neither monks, nor Daoist priests, nor even followers of Confucius or Laozi. Later generations conflated the teachings of immortality with the doctrines of the Three Teachings, thereby obscuring the true nature of the immortals’ arts. It is as though one were to daub a fair, unblemished complexion with layers of pigment, believing it enhances beauty, only to invite ridicule from those of refined taste.

You have studied in America for many years, and your scientific mindset goes without saying; your knowledge of modern medicine is undoubtedly extensive. While others might grow complacent, you, by contrast, display ever greater humility. Having recognized that the great matter of life and death cannot be resolved by medicine alone, you have taken a further step to seek the arts of immortality, cultivating thoughts that transcend the ordinary. Who but one with deep karmic roots and innate intelligence could aspire to such a path?

Miss Chen Wuxuan of Baoying once asked me, “Among women who possess both good fortune and wisdom, who might be expected to achieve success in cultivation?” I replied, “Those who combine good fortune and wisdom are exceedingly rare. Among such women, those who also love the Dao and may be expected to achieve success are even harder to find in today’s world. I have been diligently seeking them.” Now that I have found you, perhaps there is hope that you may meet the criteria.

At present, your medical duties still burden you, and you have not yet reached the stage of dedicated practice. Thus, you should first focus on studying the underlying principles. Below, I briefly outline the essentials of women’s cultivation for your perusal. I will also publish this manuscript in *Yangshan Journal* for the reference of all those across the nation who love the Dao, thereby fulfilling my long-held wish.

The study of immortality prioritizes longevity. The concept of longevity has existed since antiquity. Laozi said, “Deeply root and firmly secure [the stem]”; Zhuangzi said, “Guard the One and abide in harmony.” The *Suwen* states, “The True Person’s lifespan spans heaven and earth; the Perfected Person accumulates essence and preserves spirit; the Sage’s body does not decay.” Yet while such theories appear in the classics, the methods are not detailed in the records, leaving scholars disappointed. Only with the emergence of the *Cantong Qi* and the *Huangting Jing* did the arts of immortality’s cultivation and nurturance gain dedicated texts. Since the Tang and Song dynasties, alchemical scriptures have proliferated, yet their esoteric language and variant names create confusion, while divergent branches and winding paths lead practitioners astray. If even the methods for men’s practice remain unclear, how much less is known of the secret essentials for women’s cultivation?

Master Shangyangzi said, “In women’s cultivation of immortality, the breasts are the seat of generative qi. One must first accumulate qi in the breasts, then establish the furnace and cauldron to practice the Great Yin method of refining the body.” Alchemical texts often state, “Men cultivate to prevent seminal leakage; women cultivate to prevent menstrual leakage.” Yet when asked how qi can be accumulated or how menstruation can be prevented, they never provide explicit answers. The *Huangting Jing* states, “The teacher who transmits and the disciple who receives take an oath, hand in hand ascending the mountain to sip the elixir’s fluid; only then may the golden script and jade tablets be revealed.” The *Cantong Qi* says, “To express one’s thoughts on bamboo and silk risks leaking the celestial tally,” and further, “The Three and the Five unite as the supreme essence of heaven and earth; this can be conveyed orally but not transmitted in writing.” Thus, the secretive practices of cultivation schools did not begin today.

The reasons for the reluctance to transmit oral instructions lightly are fifteenfold, as detailed in the successive installments of *Oral Instructions: Unveiling the Profound* published in *Yangshan Semi-Monthly*. I will not repeat them here.

Here follows the translation:

In brief, there are six principal reasons:

First, life and death are the constant workings of creation, yet the study of immortality places utmost importance on longevity and transcendence of death—contending with creation itself. If lightly divulged or recklessly discussed, this may invite calamity and misfortune. (Though modern minds may dismiss this as superstition, the ancients were indeed governed by such concerns.)

Second, the distinction between orthodoxy and heterodoxy is finer than a hair’s breadth. “When the unorthodox practice the true method, the true method becomes wholly unorthodox.” Oral instructions are not recorded in writing lest they fall into the hands of the unorthodox.

Third, what is gained with difficulty is transmitted with equal difficulty—this holds true for all arts, and especially so for the elixir’s secrets.

Fourth, the Dao may be made known so that the world recognizes its existence, but its techniques must be guarded with reverence to preserve the master’s dignity and authority.

Fifth, the world lacks the Dharma-eye; who can discern yin and yang? If not deeply concealed, the teachings are easily slandered.

Sixth, the original intent of transmission is to ferry across those with karmic affinity. Yet if, through a moment’s misjudgment, the recipient treats the oral instructions as a rare commodity to be hoarded or bartered, this contravenes the transmitter’s purpose—hence the reluctance to transmit lightly.

The above reasons for secrecy pertain to the true method. As for those wandering alchemists who falsely assume the mantle of the Dao to amass wealth, they fall outside this discussion.

Profound in sudden enlightenment is the deep sorrow for those who, chasing after the form-bound, forget to return. Thus, there arises the desire to breach the ancients’ barriers and reveal their secrets, that extraordinary and untrammeled scholars—rich in lofty thought—may not misapply their wisdom and fall into peril. Yet affairs often thwart the heart’s intent, leaving only an unfulfilled aspiration. Here, I can but select what may be spoken and speak it.

Let us first discuss the schools of women’s cultivation. Since ancient times, alchemical formulas have relied on oral transmission rather than being recorded in texts, and this is especially true of women’s alchemical formulas. To trace their origins and exhaust their details, thereby forming a systematic study, is no easy task.

Examining the methods by which Daoist schools have traditionally been classified: some divide them by person, such as Qiu Changchun’s “Dragon Gate School,” Hao Datong’s “Mount Hua School,” and Sun Buer’s “Pure and Serene School,” among others. Others divide them by region, such as the “Northern Seven Perfected School,” the “Suo Five Patriarchs School,” Lu Qianxu’s “Eastern School,” and Li Hanxu’s “Western School,” and so on. Yet such classifications are ill-suited to women’s alchemical formulas. Moreover, they are divisions of doctrinal appearance rather than scientific categorization.

In my humble opinion, the schools of women’s alchemical formulas should not be divided by person or by region, but rather by method. This would lend interest to research and facilitate the seeker’s inquiry. Below, I tentatively list them as follows:

1. The Central Ridge Old Matriarch School

1. The Northern School begins with the refinement of sword techniques. There are two types of functions: the "Dharma Sword" and the "Dao Sword." Their origins and development are briefly recorded in *The Complete Works of Patriarch Lü*. In modern Daoist circles, two verses on internal refinement through sword techniques are still transmitted, offering a glimpse into this tradition. However, as the method is exceedingly difficult, few in the present age achieve mastery. Nevertheless, this approach constitutes a distinct lineage within immortal Daoism, and those who study these schools cannot disregard it. (Mount Zhongtiao is located in Yongji County, Shanxi.)

2. The Danyang Chen Matriarch School
This school emphasizes the cultivation and ingestion of Heavenly Origin Divine Elixir, along with talismans, registers, and summons. *Danyang* is a place name, and *Chen Matriarch* is a person’s name. Wu Meng of the Jin dynasty was originally the teacher of Xu Xun, but later, Xu Xun fully inherited the transmissions of Chen Matriarch. Wu, following the Matriarch’s command, again became Xu’s disciple. Perfected Lord Xu composed *The Stone Casket Record*, while Perfected Lord Wu wrote *The Bronze Talisman and Iron Contract*; both texts discuss the Heavenly Origin Divine Elixir, which was transmitted by Chen Matriarch. These two works represent the supreme teachings of elixir methods. Yet those who study the Dao in the world generally fear their difficulty and dare not attempt them. Since the Ming dynasty, with figures like Zhang Sanfeng and Shen Wansan, there have been few true adepts.

3. The Southern Marchmount Wei Lady School
This school focuses on "refined contemplation" and "visualization," revering the *Yellow Court Scripture* as its orthodox text. Since Wei Lady transmitted the *Yellow Court Scripture*, many female perfected ones of later generations have cultivated according to it, such as Lu Miaodian, Cui Shaoxuan, and Xue Xuantong. My humble work, *Lectures on the Yellow Court Scripture*, offers a fragmentary glimpse; if you have leisure, I invite you to peruse it briefly.

4. The Xie Ziran Immortal Maiden School
This school begins with "grain avoidance" and "qi ingestion," taking the *Central Yellow Scripture* as essential reading. Later, one may consult various qi formulas and methods for grain avoidance and fasting. It is suitable for the young and robust, but for the elderly or infirm, practicing this method exclusively may not be advisable.

Xie Ziran began her Daoist studies as a maiden of little more than ten years—how rare is such a one in ancient or modern times!

5. The Perfected Cao Wenyi School
This school begins with "clarifying the mind and reducing desires," "preventing the spirit from scattering outward," "focusing qi to attain suppleness," and "internally circulating primordial harmony." From start to finish, no other methods are employed—it is most simple and most accessible. For details, see the *Yangshan Semimonthly*, issue seventy-seven, "Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source."

6. The Primordial Lady Sun Bu’er School
This school practices the *Cultivation of Form through the Supreme Yin*. It begins with "severing the Red Dragon," which is the formal method of female cultivation. For details, see my humble work, *Annotations on Sun Bu’er’s Female Elixir Poems*.

The above six schools encompass the entire range of female cultivation methods from the Wei-Jin period through the past seventeen hundred years. Though scholars should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each school, as well as comparisons of difficulty and superiority among them, such discussions are not urgent for the present and may be deferred.

Additionally, there are methods such as "harmonizing *xun* and *gen*," Xia Ji’s "nourishing yin" techniques for "filling the flesh," and Feiyan’s "inner visualization" arts. There are also "secret chamber arts" and the *Su Nü’s Legacy Scriptures*—these involve "language that is not refined" and "matters of hidden intricacy," and thus are not suitable for open discussion.

Next, we consider the relationship between female cultivation and age. The *Plain Questions*’ "Discourse on the Heavenly Truth of High Antiquity" states:

The Yellow Emperor asked: "When people grow old and have no children, is it because their strength is exhausted, or is it determined by Heaven’s decree?"
Qibo replied: "In women, at seven years, kidney qi flourishes, teeth are replaced, and hair grows. At fourteen, *tian gui* arrives, the *Ren* vessel flows, the *Tai Chong* vessel flourishes, and menstruation begins at regular intervals—thus they can bear children. At twenty-one, kidney qi is balanced, the wisdom teeth emerge, and growth reaches its peak. At twenty-eight, sinews and bones are strong, hair reaches its fullest length, and the body is at its most robust. At thirty-five, the *Yang Ming* vessels begin to decline, the complexion starts to wither, and hair begins to fall. At forty-two, the three *yang* vessels decline above, the face is entirely withered, and hair begins to turn white. At forty-nine, the *Ren* vessel is depleted, the *Tai Chong* vessel weakens and diminishes, *tian gui* is exhausted, the earthly path is obstructed—thus the form deteriorates, and they can no longer bear children." (This describes the natural principles of the human body.)

The Emperor asked: "Yet some in their old age still bear children—how is this?"
Qibo replied: "These are those whose heavenly lifespan exceeds the norm, whose vessels remain unobstructed, and whose kidney qi is abundant." (This describes exceptions in physiology.)

The Emperor asked: "Those who follow the Dao may live to a hundred years—can they still bear children?"
Qibo replied: "Those who follow the Dao can ward off aging and preserve their form. Though their years may be long, they can still bear children." (This describes how those who cultivate the Dao can reverse the course of nature.)

According to the *Plain Questions*, this discussion seems to refer specifically to bearing children. Yet whether one follows the natural course to become human or reverses it to become immortal, the principle is the same—it depends solely on how one applies it. Thus, in female immortality cultivation, age makes a great difference:

1. Cultivation in Maidenhood
This refers to girls of around ten years who have not yet begun menstruation. At this time, primordial qi in the body is abundant, undivided, and whole; the spirit is unified, and desires have not yet arisen. If such a girl possesses innate wisdom and can devote herself to the Dao, her accomplishments will come easily—several times faster than those who begin later. For maidens, cultivation may bypass the foundational work of "building the base" and proceed directly to grain avoidance and qi ingestion, or to stillness and non-action through calming the spirit and seated meditation, as in the case of Xie Ziran.

2. Cultivation in Young Womanhood
This refers to girls from fourteen or fifteen to their early twenties who have begun menstruation but have not yet lost their virginity. At this stage, one should first use methods to refine and halt menstruation, restoring the state of maidenhood before proceeding with further work.

3. Cultivation in Mature Womanhood
This refers to unmarried women from twenty-two to thirty-five. The body’s physiology has reached its peak and is about to decline. At this time, menstruation may be regular or irregular, timely or untimely; there may be leukorrhea, flooding, or other ailments causing indescribable distress. One must first employ medical and hygienic methods to dispel stagnation, harmonize qi and blood, and invigorate the spirit—only then will cultivation yield results. This is more difficult than for young women.

4. Cultivation in Later Womanhood
This refers to women from thirty-five to forty-nine who have maintained their chastity without marrying. At this time, *tian gui* is nearing exhaustion, and the body’s vital qi daily weakens. Though they may have remained unmarried their whole lives, the depletion of their form is no different from that of married women. This is akin to men who never marry yet still cannot avoid aging—the principle is the same. Thus, the first essential in cultivation is to nourish and replenish the body’s deficiencies; there is no need to rush into "severing the Red Dragon."

5. Cultivation in Elderly Yin
This refers to women from forty-nine onward, up to sixty or seventy years. At this time, menstruation has ceased. One must daily practice cultivation, drawing in the generative qi of nature to replenish the generative qi within the body, gradually restoring menstruation to the state of a middle-aged woman. Then, through subtle practice of the mysterious work, one gradually refines it away until it resembles the state of a maiden. At this point, the bones and marrow become firm, qi and blood harmonize, the complexion glows with redness, the voice is soft and clear, white hair turns black, and fallen teeth regrow—this is called "reversing aging and returning to youth."

This practice may sometimes require twenty or thirty years to complete. (In the Eight Trigrams, *dui* represents the maiden, *li* the middle-aged woman, *xun* the timid woman, and *kun* the elderly Yin.)

6. Cultivation for Young Married Women
This refers to married women from sixteen or seventeen to twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age. At this time, their passions have just awakened, and desires are strong; the bonds of marital affection and family obligations are particularly constraining. Such conditions are most unsuitable for cultivation. Even if the woman herself is determined to cultivate, her husband will surely resist. A wife from a poor family need not envy those from wealthier ones. If she has neither in-laws above nor children below, and her household is prosperous with ample leisure, even if her husband is unwilling to sever worldly affairs, should she possess unwavering resolve and receive true transmission, she may secretly apply the technique of reverse circulation during her daily routines. This neither disrupts worldly affairs nor hinders progress on the immortal path. Though she may not immediately transcend the mundane, she will surely preserve her youthful countenance. However, those who have not yet mastered the "Severing the Red Dragon" practice are unfit to attempt this.

7. Intensive Cultivation for Middle-Aged Married Women
This refers to married women from twenty-six or twenty-seven to forty-six or forty-seven years of age. At this stage, they are burdened by household cares and preoccupied with their children, making cultivation seem entirely out of reach. If their husbands oppose it, there is no hope at all. But if husband and wife share the same aspiration, they may mutually agree to abstain from worldly affairs and each devote themselves to practice. If there are young children requiring nursing, a wet nurse must be hired, or substitute milk powder or semi-solid foods used; one must not feed the child with one’s own milk, lest it impede progress in cultivation.

8. Cultivation for Widows
For those who have married and been widowed, with no children or whose children are already independent, this is an opportune time to embark on the path of cultivation, filling the solitude of their later years. In the era of old Confucian ethics, widows were bound by reputation to maintain chastity; since the Republic, the custom of widow chastity has been overturned, yet remarried women still face societal disdain. Why not instead devote oneself to the study of immortal arts, finding solace for the spirit and joy in bodily health? Success would be ideal, but even if not fully attained, the results will be beneficial, sparing one from wasted effort. The initial practices differ little from those of unmarried women.

The above outlines the general paths of cultivation for women, which have seldom been openly discussed by past masters. Today, I reveal them to you in full.

Herein lies the same intent as when, twenty years prior, I composed the *Annotations on the Female Alchemy Poems* for the lady Lü Bicheng. Later, for reasons unknown, she returned to the Buddhist path. Who can foretell her next life? I fear she may no longer aspire to liberation in this present existence. Nevertheless, had it not been for that karmic connection, the *Annotations on Sun Bu’er’s Female Alchemy Poems* might never have been completed. To date, no fewer than two or three thousand copies have circulated both domestically and abroad. (*The Annotations* first appeared in *Yangshan Journal*, with two thousand copies distributed per issue. Later, woodblock editions were printed as standalone volumes, selling several hundred more.) Among these readers, some must have attained liberation through this work. Tracing its roots, the one who initially requested the annotations played no small part. Moreover, with the emergence of the *Thirty-Six Questions*, the gateway to female cultivation has advanced further. Readers will reap even greater benefits. Though she failed to liberate herself, she first liberated others—upon hearing this, Lü Bicheng would surely find solace. Yet what I expect of you surpasses even that. Lü’s merit lay solely in benefiting others; today, you should seek mutual benefit for self and others, achieving true perfection.

The supreme path of cultivation prioritizes attainment in this very life. Do not procrastinate or grow indolent, abandoning the present in pursuit of the illusory blossoms of future lives—this is my earnest hope. When Yizhu returned home, I learned of your eagerness to begin in earnest. Is this not most excellent? However, the subtleties of principle and method defy expression in mere words. When circumstances align in the future, I shall delineate the stages and discuss them face-to-face. For now, I offer this reply, with wishes for your well-being.

**Essentials of Female Alchemy from the *Recorded Sayings of Leyu Hall* by Master Huang Yuanji**

1. Shuduan, chaste and solitary in her suffering, aspires to cultivate the Great Dao—truly an extraordinary woman. I deeply pity and praise her. In essence, the study of the Dao requires nothing more than purifying the heart and cleansing the mind, emptying it to lay the foundation. Emptiness gives rise to numinosity, and numinosity reveals the true heart, from which the original nature emerges. This is but one facet of "illuminating the heart and perceiving the nature." Know that this is no arduous task. When one’s thought returns to the cinnabar field and the intent is used to observe it, the initial stirring of thought is the heart. Illumination means illuminating this—nothing more. Before thought arises, there is but a vast clarity, empty and undifferentiated, devoid of all things—this is the nature. Perception means perceiving this—nothing more. If one can truly illuminate the heart and perceive the nature, it is akin to the moment when, amid the congealing yin, a single yang stirs—suddenly, the light turns inward. This is the ancient saying: "At winter solstice, yang is born; at midnight, the living zi hour arrives." Here, one redirects the light to the breasts, where the water source is purest, to refine the immortal elixir. Beginning with dispelling illness and prolonging life, it culminates in sagehood and transcendence—all rooted in this single moment.

Yet, fearing that women may struggle to grasp such profound teachings, I offer a simpler method. When beginning practice, sit upright and composed, serene and tranquil. Be diligent and self-motivated. Reflect that nothing in this world is truly one’s own—even children and spouses dissolve in an instant, like travelers parting at dawn, each going their separate way. You are you; I am I. When the eyes dim and the breath ceases, this body becomes mere dust, leaving only the heart-nature. If one cultivates well in life, the spirit remains clear and luminous, free from torpor—ascending to heaven. Upon rebirth, with such clarity of heart and numinosity of nature, who would willingly descend into the ranks of beasts? Thus, those who nurture their heart-nature well reap its benefits for myriad lifetimes. Clearly, who would choose to be reborn into poverty and suffering? One must select a favorable birth—this is both principle and sentiment. For the uncultivated, death brings only confusion, like a blind man stumbling without regard for peril. If entangled by karmic debts, they may fall into the three evil destinies or be reborn into hardship—an inevitable fate.

2. Xianzhen and others, devoted to this path, have recently endured trials and tribulations, surely recognizing the illusory nature of worldly attachments and refusing to cling to them further. My teacher advises: even the greatest worldly wealth and love last but fifty or sixty years before parting. How much better to cultivate the Dao within, enjoying boundless, imperishable bliss? Seize this moment to see through the red dust, shatter the web of karma, and leap free with resolve. Day and night, focus on observing the breath within the breasts—counting each inhalation and exhalation, allowing it to flow naturally. As you exhale, let it rise without disturbing the head or eyes; as you inhale, let it descend without agitating the water palace. Let it proceed gently, unhurried and at ease. Whether a hundred or a thousand breaths, let it follow its course without counting. Simply concentrate the spirit in the breasts, regulating the breath there, following its natural rhythm of ebb and flow. This is sufficient.

**Patriarch Ma Danyang’s Gift to Sister Ma**

Jade Maiden, fairy of jasper, wears a jade gourd,
Amid lotus fragrance, she plays with the whirlwind’s might.
Within the *Moon over the Western River*, she gathers the sprouts of lingzhi.

Ninefold refinement complete, she enjoys eternal joy,
The Three Fields’ treasures congealed, she roams at will,
A guest of immortals, ascending to the azure heavens.

**To Sister Sun**

I urge you, Sister Sun, to cultivate the Great Dao,
Ever sweeping the field of the heart.
Slay the Three Corpses and the Six Wastes,
Free from affliction—
Ever pure, ever still, you shall know the profound mystery.

Ask not of strange names for furnace or hearth,
For harmony rises and falls, inverting high and low.
Lead and mercury naturally form the supreme treasure—
How wondrous!
Clouds of radiance escort you to Penglai Isle.

**To All Sisters**

Listen, sisters, listen well,
Learn from Ma Gu’s utmost purity,
Follow her wondrous goodness.

Be not clever, be not clever,
Outwardly simple, inwardly awake,
Your work complete, you ascend to Jade Capital.

**To Sister Ma**

Jade Maiden, fairy of jasper, wears a jade gourd,
Amid lotus fragrance, she plays with the whirlwind’s might.
Within the *Moon over the Western River*, she gathers the sprouts of lingzhi.

Ninefold refinement complete, she enjoys eternal joy,
The Three Fields’ treasures congealed, she roams at will,
A guest of immortals, ascending to the azure heavens.

**To Chen Gu, the Recluse of Cave Clouds**

Pure and still,
Delving into the profound,
Gazing at heaven, you discern the root-source.
Spreading and weaving the net of the Three Powers,
All phenomena transmit the sun and moon’s legacy.
Emulating Nüwa’s craft,
Gathering emptiness—
Five hues renewed.
Refining with fire,
The great work perfected,
Whole, without lack or excess.

Attaining unity, you dwell in serene earth.
Acting without contrivance,
Naturally, eternally enduring.

In the depths of profound obscurity,
She conceives and bears a celestial embryo—
This is the original face,
Ever luminous, though without mouth to speak.
When the time arrives,
A golden youth comes to announce:
She shall ascend to audience at the Primordial.

**To Yang Wuyi of Lingkou**

Yang the Maiden awakened to the Dao,
Her resolve fierce beyond compare—
Shattering the mirror-tower to pieces.
Seeing through the foul and putrid skin-sack,
She vowed never to groom or wash again.
With single-minded devotion, disheveled and unkempt,
She dons a straw cloak, wields a staff, and wears a bamboo hat.
She severs all cunning and wisdom,
Renounces the karma-fire of ignorance,
And dulls all sharpness of self.

How does this compare to men?
It surpasses even the soul-snatchers,
The life-demanding living ghosts.
Wealth and glory she casts aside,
No longer giving them a thought.
Abiding in constant purity, constant stillness,
Dwelling in non-action and the natural principle.
When merit and practice are complete,
She shall claim a place among the immortals
On the Ten Isles and Three Mountains.

**To Li the Maiden of Little Hu Village**

Maiden, in your cultivation,
Hear my earnest counsel:
First, sever all afflictions.
Capture the mind-monkey and intent-horse,
Lest they reverse course.
Like a resolute man,
Do not hesitate or act carelessly.
Swiftly take up the task,
Rely on utmost bitter resolve,
To avoid facing King Yama.

Cut away the myriad worldly ties,
Attain true joy and true bliss,
Gradually penetrating the profound mysteries.
Guard closely the non-action of pure stillness,
The natural Dao.
Responding to things with true constancy and ease,
Qi and spirit conjoin to form the elixir-treasure.
When merit and practice are complete,
Ride the auspicious clouds
To return to the Three Isles.

**To Wang the Maiden of Chang’an**

Marvelous is the sword of wisdom—
Formless and traceless,
Of pure steel, cleaving iron and severing nails.
It hews asunder the mountain of affection,
Strikes down the dust of love and desire.
It exterminates the Three Corpses and Six Bandits,
No need to brandish it—
Even gods and ghosts tremble.
Ever grasp it firmly,
To subdue the tortoise and serpent,
Ensuring peace beneath your feet.

This sword, all possess,
Yet only those who single-mindedly turn toward the Dao
Will witness its power unfold.
Further, with constant purity and stillness,
Its blade gleams bright.
Naturally, it penetrates the profound and wondrous—
Why then fret over an unenlightened nature?
When merit and practice are complete,
You shall surely ascend,
Bearing clouds to Penglai and Yingzhou.

**To the Two Maiden Sisters of Jingyang County**

Marvelous is the supreme principle—
Ever pure, ever still,
Easy to know, easy to understand, yet hard to practice.
To become an immortal,
You must take this as your foundation.
Cease seeking the profound or wondrous;
Simply settle the mind, dispel desires, and forget emotions.
Without attachment,
Without hatred or love,
Without contention or strife.

Once awakened, though touched, remain unmoved,
Aware that within the boundless,
All returns to tranquility.
Sun and moon share the same palace,
Day and night unite in radiance.
Not divine, yet divinity manifests—
Riding auspicious clouds,
Hastening to Penglai and Yingzhou.
Paying homage to the Jade Emperor,
Displaying true merit,
The Dao of pure stillness is accomplished.

**To Wang the Auspicious Recluse of Chang’an**

The matter of life and death is pressing—
What concern are sons and grandsons?
Blithely leap beyond the household gate.
Roam carefree beyond the mundane,
Dwelling in a tranquil pavilion free of affairs.
Ever settling the mind and cutting off thoughts,
This is called capturing the horse and seizing the monkey.
Sever worldly thoughts,
Awake and unburdened,
You shall comprehend the profound words.

The subtlest and most wondrous realm
Lies where wind neighbors moon, and companionship,
Where the roots of clouds take root in your feet.
In stillness, you know the cave’s interior—
A heaven and earth apart.
How can destiny be left to heaven and earth?
Shield your numinous clarity,
Return to the origin.
Return to Penglai Isle,
Where there is neither birth nor death, ever abiding.

**To Wei the Illuminated Recluse of Lingkou, Afflicted by Wind**

Though a woman in body,
Her will rivals a man’s—
Awakened, she leapt beyond the household gate.
Seeking the Dao,
She forsook her beloved daughter and handsome son.
Her nature like a solitary cloud or wild crane,
Unentangled by worldly dust.
Truly liberated and untrammeled,
She may well be called
A great man.

Recognizing the original purity,
Why trouble to acknowledge
Tiger-child or dragon-child?
No need to arrange
The maiden of Kan and Li,
The infant and the girl.
The great work of non-action is accomplished,
Bearing a formless child.
When yang is perfected,
She shall become
A child of the Most High.

**To the Assembly of Maiden Disciples**

Averse to wind and sun,
Cherishing your appearance,
You find comfort in the depths of painted halls.
Before the mirror, you groom,
Adjusting your golden-threaded silken robes.
Yet hearing of the immortal’s molting like a cicada,
You admire true cultivation,
Resolute and unwavering.
Forsaking splendor,
Disheveled and unwashed,
You take refuge in plain cloth.

The spiritual root, once afflicted,
Now demands your hands-on healing.
Circulate the sun and moon within your body,
Directly to the ends of the earth.
Naturally, wood and metal become treasure,
Revealing the divine pearl,
Shimmering in limpid streams.
Only then shall you know
These wonders
Are beyond thought or speech.

**To Lu the Maiden**

A wisdom-lamp soars to the Milky Way,
Auspicious smoke of the Eight Trigrams billows forth.
Ninefold golden elixir refines the jade nature,
The jeweled path to the Ten Isles lies smooth before you.

**To Xue the Recluse of Pine Stream**

The great taboo of cultivation is extravagance—
Shatter all attachments, refine wheat and hemp.
Reversing yin and yang, penetrating creation,
Naturally, the furnace congeals the great cinnabar.

**To Chai the Maiden**

Non-action, non-effort—great cultivation.
Intent pure, mind clear, the wisdom-lamp shines.
Illuminating the Nine Passes, traversing freely,
On Kunlun Mountain, you ascend.

**To Yan the Recluse of Frost Stream**

With single-minded devotion to the Dao, never turning back,
Eight-flavored nectar irrigates the great elixir.
The Nine Luminaries harmonize the true jade nature,
With merit complete, you ascend to the immortal altar.

**To Liu the Maiden of Hu County**

A single grain lodged within the abdomen,
The secret transmitted, transforming the vulgar stream.
Fire mutually engenders, preserving life and nature,
Penetrating nature, she is called Immortal Liu.

**Matching the Rhyme of Cao Jieyuan’s Wife, the Non-Action Recluse Jia Wu’er**

Fire in the same palace, two intermingling,
By the moon’s light, brilliance shines forth.
Awakened to the Dao, worldly dust is cast aside,
Timely settled, never sinking into the desert.

**To Old Zhang the Maiden of Hucheng County and the Assembly of Maiden Disciples**

Extraordinary ones act extraordinarily,
Wielding the Three Wonders and Six Xin.
The jade tree ever flourishes, ever watered,
The jeweled blossoms never fade, untouched by spring.

**To Wang the Maiden of Hu County and the Assembly of Maiden Disciples**

Leisurely and serene, nurturing the true person,
No need for wine, meat, or pungent flavors.

**To Maiden Zhao of Huxian County and the Assembly of Maiden Disciples**

Three cups of ghee bestow a thousand autumns,
One peach of Penglai grants ten thousand springs.

**To Maiden Sun the Second**

In non-action, purity refines the elixir-maker,
Spared from the ten thousand sorrows of red dust.
The Mystic Garden yields the fruit of no-leakage,
The Water Realm’s withered spring leaves no trace.

**Master Wang Chongyang**
**Maiden Zhang’s Inquiry**

Nine-petaled golden flowers ever unfurl,
Eight channels of jade waters freely flow.
Seven gates, each attained, all lead through,
Four images, bright and clear, wholly still.
One grain of divine elixir returns to the true path,
Two silver threads bind the primal beginning.
Radiant and resplendent, know the transmission—
Fruit realized without remainder, medicine in surplus.

**To Maiden Sun the Second**

Maiden Sun was the wife of Ma Yu. The Master twice halved a pear to share with the couple, wishing their transformation together. Yu followed the Way for over a year, and Sun also left home to embrace the Dao.

Ten divisions of the pear—years past,
Heaven grants the season, nature’s decree.
Why not depart then and there?
Only to await the golden lotus’ bloom.

**To Maiden Sun**

The Second Granny still clings to her estate,
Yet who knows wealth will ruin her coin?
Had she kept home as before,
Master Ma would have no share in immortality.

**To Maiden Sun**

At home, she was but "Second Granny,"
Once departed, the hearth’s fire is gone.
If she masters cultivation and refinement,
Others will forever call her "Immortal Maiden."

**Tune: "Bu Suan Zi"**
**Jiao the Maiden’s Request**

Hearing the gate of exposition unsealed...

**To Yang the Maiden**

Extinguish the worms, the hearth and stove stand firm and secure.
Refine the pure and constant, gaze beyond the void,
Utterly clear, utterly still—thoughts and cares dissolved.
Press down in frequent forgetfulness,
Bind the golden elixir,
Pierce through to the Hall of Light.
The axe’s long blade wields a steel-edged sword,
Offering the true origin,
Straight to the path of Penglai.

**Master Tan Chuduan**
*Presented to Yang the Maiden*

Eighty Daoist nuns of Yang’s Investiture into the Mysteries,
A single blossom of jade flower, fragrant after autumn’s fall.
The jade chalice brims with water of purity,
The golden censer must burn incense of wisdom’s spirit.
Now you have secured blessings for the days to come,
Henceforth, what doubt remains of past misfortunes?
The silent, profound, empty hall is free of hindrance,
Naturally, the jeweled tripod reveals rosy clouds.

**To the Three Sisters of Marshal Wang’s Residence**

If you wish to cultivate amidst the worldly,
First extinguish the distinctions of self and other.
In softness and weakness, guard poverty’s clarity,
In steadfastness, remain unchanged from beginning to end.
True goodness—true goodness—
Only in harming the self to benefit others lies true convenience.

**Master Wang Chuyi**
*The Wife of the Surveillance Commissioner Seeks a Cure for Illness*

Heaven births, heaven nurtures—follow heaven in cultivation,
Disregard the dusty world and its mortal bones.
How can the Four Borrowings ascend the Phoenix Terrace?
How can the Three Corpses reach Yingzhou’s isles?
Awakening to truth, inward illumination forgets new attachments,
Returning to the root, the heart’s embers extinguish old sorrows.
The formless true emptiness transcends the other shore,
Steadily riding the great divine vessel of ease.

**To the Abbess of Weizhou’s Abbey, the Grand Lady**

Who has encountered a living immortal?
Certainly, one who nurtures the numinous and bright, piercing the azure sky.
From the jade treasury, true water and fire are drawn and replenished,
In the jasper palace, auspicious clouds and mist congeal.
Form and spirit both wondrous—who can fathom?
Void and color both dissolved—how can the principle be conveyed?
The four seas turn their light in unison to revere the teaching,
Naturally, merit and virtue fill the three thousand realms.

**Sent to My Mother**

Mother and child cultivate the true and leave the household together,
Embodying heaven and modeling the Dao as our livelihood.
Wherever we transform conditions, the gods and spirits assist,
Exhorting goodness again and again, blessings and longevity increase.
Worldly ties and affections are no longer discussed,
The mysteries of the Dao’s gate and its virtue never err.
When the inner spirit ascends and transforms, it merges with the true,
One day, our merit complete, Penglai’s isles will be praised.

**To My Aunt and Mother-in-Law on Cultivation**

Aunt and mother-in-law both speak of the heart’s devotion to the Dao,
Yet do not indulge in extravagance, lest it all come to naught.
First awaken to true cultivation, forgetting self and other,
Do not let external seeking send you wandering east and west.
Qi and spirit must be made to attend the Ocean of Origin,
The monkey and horse must be locked within the Crimson Palace.
Subduing the host of demons without obstruction,
Freely and at ease, you will complete the immortal’s work.

**To Daoist Nun Liu Zhimiao of Huang County on Daily Practice**

Scrutinize daily practice with painstaking care,
Where the eye falls, turn the light—all deeds perfected.
Refine the self to temper the true and magnify the great Dao,
The path ahead will naturally extinguish all transgressions.

**To the Cypress of Longevity and Protection at Fushan**

From ancient times to now, true compassion establishes great merit,
Only after three heavens does one encounter trust in haste.
Gradually, joy and glory reveal the profound mystery,
Attaining unity, you know the Dao is shared by all.

**To Jiang the Maiden of Fushan on Cultivation**

Studying the Dao is like smelting gold in fire,
True gold, once refined, gleams with deep purple light.
Within the mysterious palace, employ the three treasures of the body,
A single orb of perfect clarity comprehends ancient and modern.

**To Sui the Maiden on the Mind-King**

The mind is the great Dharma-King of all dusts,
Do not let it be inverted, chasing after drifting things.
Naturally, inner and outer unite in true emptiness,
Then return to Penglai to recognize your homeland.

**Sent to *Cloud Record*, with This Quatrain Presented to the Lady of Gold and Purple**

Pure tones and wondrous conduct, without private bias,
Even a drop of water’s kindness is hard to forget.
Secretly, from the immortal’s palace, ascend the purple paths,
Your name is already prepared in the *Cloud Record*.

**The Surveillance Commissioner’s Wife Seeks Instruction Due to Illness**

Birth and nurturance are the Dao’s constant way,
Yet how is it that people all turn their backs on this path?
Not cherishing the original, pure, and tranquil master,
How can this colored body ever attain peace and health?

**To the Female Assembly of the Hall of Cultivation**

Regardless of age, engage in true cultivation,
Each unfolds in tranquil leisure, reaching the shore’s vessel.
Light fills the ten directions, freeing from suffering and peril,
Forever dwelling beyond the heavens—most refined.

**To Gao the Maiden of Laiyang**

The mind is the bodhi, the great Dharma-King,
Do not become inverted, chasing after waves in haste.
Naturally, a single point of numinous emptiness coalesces,
Then return to Penglai to enter your homeland.

**To Zhang the Maiden of Dizhou Seeking Instruction**

Born of the great Dao, fragrance is natural.
With a true master, examine carefully.
The path is open, immortal tidings arrive.
Only when the ashes are cold does the nature stretch and lengthen.

**Excerpts from *The Heart Talks of Two Lazy Ones*: Women’s Alchemy Section**
*(Editor’s Note: This compilation reveals the secret of "retaining the gaze to forget and advance the fire," a method hitherto unrecorded in the alchemical canon. First retain, then forget—retain at "a certain place," then forget at that same place, and true fire will naturally arise there. When true fire is born, the turbid yin-qi of illness dissolves of itself. Yet the bellows must be unobstructed for the practice to avoid error. The method: first direct intention to a certain place and still the mind. Stillness deepens into softness, softness into release, release into forgetting, forgetting into deeper forgetting—then true fire ignites like flame.)*

**Preface**
These two individuals—of unknown origin and unrecorded surname—appear, from their *Heart Talks*, to be adepts of the nurturing arts, poised to embark upon the Southern Palace. I copied their words with delight, for their speech is shallow yet profound, coarse yet refined. Their intent seems purposeful, far removed from the obstinate recluses of this world, and their tastes align with my own. Thus, I have excised the unorthodox and preserved the essential, naming the collection *The Heart Talks of Two Lazy Ones*. One styles himself "Lazy Old Man," the other "Great Lazy One." The character for "lazy" (懒) here takes its sense from the heart, not the woman radical, implying reliance on the heart in learning—akin to Su the Lazy Old Man. For they are those who engage with the heart of Heaven and the heart of the Dao.

Respectfully transcribed and annotated by Xiao Gen on the fifteenth day of the eleventh lunar month in the *wuyin* year of the Jiaqing reign.

**Encounter**
You drift like duckweed in the southern skies, I in the northern earth. This autumn’s sudden meeting felt as natural as a lifetime’s acquaintance—destined, indeed! Your teacher was Li the Barefoot, mine the Venerable of Great Emptiness. Though no cause bound us, our masters’ silent accord brought us together. You recently befriended the Master of the Northern Wall, who received transmission from the Stone Mirror Mountain Daoist. What you may not know: his master’s master, the clear-sighted Jin Huaihuai Wang, is also your master’s master. Thus, your teacher, Red Master, and my Stone Mirror Mountain Daoist were fellow disciples under the same master. I once studied under Jin the Cup-Holder, having been introduced by the Venerable of Great Emptiness. You and I are kin in lineage, and at first meeting, we blended like water and milk. Our school is one, our practice identical—our tastes naturally harmonize. What Dao did the Master of the Northern Wall impart to you?

**The Heart Talks of Two Lazy Ones**
*Question:* What have you learned?
*Answer:* Only the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass and the union of heart and kidney.
*Question:* Whether the Mysterious Pass is open is not difficult to discern. But if the method of opening it remains unknown, how do you propose to unite them?
*Answer:* I seek instruction.
*Reply:* We are of one family—how could I remain indifferent? For now, we are but drifting duckweed, but one day we may together dissect the profound mysteries.

**A Good Question**
Great Lazy One asked: The ancients said the subtle mechanism lies in the eyes. I wish to fathom its wonders.
Lazy Old Man rose solemnly and said: An excellent question! The entire body belongs to yin, and what transforms yin back to yang are the two eyes. This is the first oral instruction for entering the Dao. Since you already know this, use it for inner illumination, and every step will be the Dao—the Mysterious Pass may yet open.
*Question:* Where does inner illumination begin?
*Answer:* Close your eyes and regulate the breath for a time. When the breath feels settled, begin by gathering intention and spirit in the brain *(Editor’s Note: This is a general term for progressive stages. Beginners may practice the Brahma Heaven "Ī" seal, using spirit-intention to envelop the entire surface of the head, with the root of the nose as the foundation. Advanced practitioners may enter the brain’s interior; the most advanced unify inner and outer, merging the five senses.)*. With the eyes’ light, glance slightly toward the crown. You will sense a faint brightness, like moonlight in darkness. Then use intention to guide this light to illuminate the Mud Pill Palace *(Editor’s Note: This means drawing the life-qi from the top of the head to merge with one’s spirit-intention—what is called the "intention-pearl," the celestial pivot of human stability. For details, see "Revealing Heaven’s Mechanism.")*. When the brain is filled with light and the head feels crystalline (this is the marrow-washing method), over time, guide this brightness from the Double Towers to the Crimson Palace. Retain it there for a moment, and you will feel the Crimson Palace turn purely white (this is the heart-washing method). Then direct intention to the Central Yellow, retaining it as before, until the Central Yellow also turns white (this is the Pure Land method). The radiance will naturally descend with the qi, and you will feel the Lower Field gradually expand, becoming ever more serene and profound (this is the Ocean-Purifying method). With prolonged inner illumination, the light grows brighter and the space vaster. After much time, you will sense qi stirring within (this is the dragon emerging from the sea bottom). Maintain a single thought of clarity and emptiness, gently guiding the eyes’ light to circle and illuminate from the sea bottom backward. Soon, you will feel this light penetrate the Tailbone Pass (this is the tiger turning from the water’s depths). Gradually, light will rise from below (this is the Yellow River flowing backward), ultimately piercing the crown (this is the method of returning essence to replenish the brain). At this moment, employ the head-to-tail illumination method. What is this method? Let the light of both eyes rest in midair, like the sun and moon shining down upon the crown, penetrating the Three Passes straight to the deepest sea bottom (this is the secret of the sacred sun and moon illuminating the Golden Court). It will seem as if a moon’s reflection rests at the sea bottom, mirroring the moon in the upper sky (this is the secret of "water in the Yangtze, moon in the heavens"). At this juncture, all sounds fade into emptiness. Use a single intention to surge upward and penetrate downward, advancing both without conflict. With long practice, you will feel this clear light pierce the Nine Heavens above and shatter the Nine Abysses below.

At this moment, I am no longer aware of my body’s existence. Such is the entry into inner illumination—ah! Speaking of it is easy, but practicing it is difficult. I may be dull-witted, yet I shall devote myself to these words.

*(Xie’s note: This method of inner illumination is a secret never before revealed in the alchemical classics. Its essence lies in naturalness. At the outset, one must first empty and still the heart—this is the key! It constitutes the foundational practice of the "Three Observations." The initial regulation of breath is also crucial. If this method is combined with the union of heart and breath, it becomes the supreme vehicle of the Great Dao.)*

Shan Yi, having parted one day, returned shortly after and said: "Since I began practicing inner illumination and continued with the formless meditation, my mind-ground has grown clear and bright. Gradually, I felt as though my lower region had vanished, as if boundless and fathomless. This arose from prolonged inner cultivation. After my thoughts settled profoundly, this scene appeared. I felt my entire body suffused with harmonious qi, and eventually, even this vision faded beyond concern. Only then did I realize that the breath had ceased, while the lower region grew intensely warm. Suddenly, amid the extreme heat, several strands of cool qi emerged—some descending from the chest and abdomen, others flowing down the front of the spine and back of the viscera, swirling around the male root as if on the verge of leakage. I feared this was not an auspicious state and halted midway. (If one stops here without adding the fire of refinement, harm may follow.) Upon emerging, I respectfully sought instruction."

The Lazy Old Man said: "Excellent question! This cool qi flowing downward is the yin essence encountering qi and transforming. (This yin essence is precisely the strands of cool qi mentioned earlier.) If the true qi is weak and the transformation lacks refinement, it will merge with ordinary qi. (Ordinary qi is ordinary fire; at this stage, it is ministerial fire.) This may form generative essence. Without advancing the yang fire (holding the breath and concentrating the mind is called advancing yang fire), this substance will inevitably break through the barrier and escape. The method is to focus the spirit and gather qi at the sea bottom, then propel it with the light of both eyes, as if turning a millstone. At this moment, the heart grows even more tranquil, the breath halts, and true qi flows downward to the lower region. (This is the great secret of advancing yang fire.) The lower region then becomes hot as a boiling cauldron (boiling describes the state of fire and water merging), and yin essence transforms into qi."

*(Xie’s note: This segment of the method emphasizes the dual-eye spiritual light and breath retention, followed by forgetting form in emptiness. Thus, ordinary fire departs, and true fire arises. If the practitioner’s nature-cultivation is impure or the upper-body practice insufficiently refined, one may fail to forget form and still the mechanism, giving rise to desire. With desire, essence will not transform into qi but instead become turbid fluid and leak out. Be cautious! Be doubly cautious!)*

Following the qi’s ascent, it pierces the tailbone, rises to the mud pill, and transforms into true fluid. (This is the concrete evidence of returning essence to replenish the brain.) It then descends the "heavy tower," moistening the Crimson Palace. (This is called "postnatal sweet dew," a substance that transforms into blood.)

*(Xie’s note: The formless, pure aspect returns to the Central Yellow within the mud pill, while the turbid aspect enters the Crimson Palace and lower elixir field.)*

From the front of the spine behind the heart, it divides and reaches both kidneys. (At this point, the sweet dew has turned red, transforming into blood.) I then direct the light of both eyes downward to the kidneys, rotating left and right. The faster the rotation, the hotter it becomes (this refines blood into essence). The heat extends from the kidneys to the navel wheel (this is the method of refining the ordinary to return to the true, and refining qi to return to primordial qi). This heat must be several times more intense than before, so that this substance transforms from true essence into qi. From here, one must not cease (not even briefly). The heat then descends again to the sea bottom, where the work of concentration and infusion continues. (This is a crucial instruction.) As before, the yin essence (which will inevitably be present and abundant—only after achieving pure yang throughout the body will it vanish) transforms into qi and ascends. The method of refining yin to return to yang is no more than this. Its effects may be witnessed in due course (interruption makes them difficult to see, hence the warning against it). The subtlety lies in perseverance (this cannot be overemphasized). Thus, by circulating without pause and practicing at set times daily (this is the only way), how can one not achieve what the ancient masters promised—success within months? (This is certain, without doubt!)"

*(Xie’s note: Practicing the above method is no easy task! It is better to first open the bellows and form true breath before proceeding, as this makes control easier. This method is suitable for middle-aged and elderly practitioners.)*

The Great Lazy One said: "Your words are indeed so. I shall follow this practice. Yet I have heard that in the method, after the heart, one divides and descends to the two kidneys—this is the way of women’s cultivation. Since women take blood as their foundation, their mysterious pass opens naturally at the Crimson Palace. In their practice, they add rubbing at the space between the two breasts, called the Breast Stream. Kneading and rubbing a hundred or a thousand times, the chest becomes fiery and hot, and one feels only qi oppression, even a sensation of stiffness and numbness. Only then does the blood begin to flourish. The method is simply to withdraw with intention behind the heart and before the spine, dividing to pour into the two kidneys. If, like men, one were to descend straight from the heart to the abdomen, there would be the danger of blood collapse." *(Xie’s note: This is a secret never before revealed in the alchemical canons!)* "(This question concerns the true internal practice of the Great Lazy One’s venerable mother. Lazy Weng often explained it to her in ordinary times, hence this inquiry—this is the essential method of women’s elixir cultivation.) Thus, the application is just as you have said.

Now, what you describe pertains to qi. When qi ascends to the brain and transforms back into fluid, this is already extraordinary. Once it has become fluid, what hinders its direct descent to the lower field? Why must it, like women, descend to the Crimson Palace, then withdraw before reaching its destination, passing through the two kidneys and rising to the navel wheel before it finally transforms into qi? This principle is unclear. Moreover, qi and *qi* are one and the same—both are by nature fire, differing only in the names of pre-heaven and post-heaven. Having heard your discourse, my doubts multiply, and I cannot suppress them. I beg you to clarify."

Lazy Weng said: "Excellent indeed is this question! You may truly be called one who doubts well. What I have spoken is half what I heard from my teachers and half what I learned from books. Now, let me briefly outline its general principles. I say: I am ready to hear your profound teaching."

The Master said: "In men, yang resides in the abdomen; in women, yang resides in the back—this is the unchanging principle of Heaven and Earth. What I call *yin essence* is not true essence in form, though it resembles it. It is the fluid transformed from food and drink, not yet refined into blood, stagnating among the hundred apertures, becoming phlegm-like. When it lingers in the middle burner, it forms *yin-fluid* patterns; when it flows into the bladder, it becomes slippery discharge. Within the three hundred joints and eighty-four thousand pores of this body, such substance abounds, lurking in every crevice. When external pathogens exploit these gaps, they collude with this substance to wreak no small harm.

Now, when my true *qi* circulates and warms it, this substance melts and stirs, following the *qi* to protect and flow into the lower field. Its nature is yin-cold, so its movement seeks only coolness. Yet if it accumulates without transformation, it must eventually turn to fire and emerge—what the world calls *flowing fire syndrome* is none other than this.

Thus, whenever I sit in meditation and true *qi* flows, I feel a cool, rustling breeze rising from within—this is the effect of this substance being transformed and released. Therefore, when this substance flows into the lower field, I must apply great true fire to refine it (this is a most essential secret). Then it becomes like mist or cloud, rising with the true *qi* along the spine to the crown of the head. Once gathered and condensed, it becomes true fluid, like rain or dew, dripping from the nostrils into the mouth (this is the sweet dew). It moistens the Crimson Palace (here, one must hold the intention firmly), and with the heart’s fire warming it, it transforms into blood.

It must then descend between the spine and the heart, dividing to flow into the two kidneys. After further refinement, it follows the *qi* to the navel, and through great refinement, it becomes *qi*. This is the fixed process of *qi*-transformation, the same for men and women.

Who does not consume food and drink? The fluids derived from them are produced daily. If one remains ignorant of the secret of refining them through the heart’s intention, few will avoid illness—hence nine out of ten people suffer from phlegm. Those who cultivate the Way often struggle with seminal loss. The world fails to understand, attributing it to wayward thoughts, or to a lack of harmony between heart and kidneys, or to poor digestion—all are mistaken. The true cause lies in not gathering the *qi* through the heart’s intention, allowing fluids to overflow, accumulate, and congeal into phlegm, which then flows downward and leaks out. Some forcibly suppress it, only to develop external ailments—abscesses and toxins—where it transforms into fire and erupts. The harms it breeds are too numerous to count, so I have explained it in detail.

As for what is called *true essence*, it exists when embodied as a whole, but vanishes when grasped or sought."

As for the essence of intercourse, it remains a product of *qi*-transformation, thus possessing form and color; since it arises from within, it can give life. Yet this fluid from food and drink comes from without, and if not refined by the heart, the blood has not yet transformed—it merely resembles essence in form, how could it give life? It is not the supreme treasure, and if it leaks out occasionally, what cause is there for regret, for worry, for fretfulness? Is this not delusion? Rather than taking medicine to astringe it, it is better to refine it as I have said—this is called "removing the firewood from beneath the cauldron."

I speak of this matter so earnestly because, though this substance is mundane, when refined according to the method, it becomes *yin qi*. When it ascends to the brain and descends to the heart, it can transform into blood, already a treasure. If it further descends to the kidneys and rises to be refined at the navel, meeting the *earth* (note: *earth* refers to true intention and true breath), it becomes indistinguishable from true *qi*, thus manifestly the supreme treasure.

Alas! The prenatal is yang, the postnatal is yin—our cultivation is nothing but the Way of refining yin to return to yang. The secret lies in nothing more than forgetting form to nourish *qi*, forgetting *qi* to nourish spirit, forgetting spirit to nourish emptiness. The reason one must attain the state of "forgetting" is that only when the gathered essence, *qi*, and spirit all belong to the prenatal can they be free from harm. Moreover, what matters is that the body constantly undergoes refinement, and its function lies solely in fire. With sufficient fire, there is prosperity; with weak fire, there is decline. Without forgetting, there is no gathering; only by forgetting can fire be sufficient—this is the essential secret of cultivating the truth.

(Note: "Forgetting" means to forget what has been established, not empty forgetting. Thus, it is said: first preserve, then forget—preservation refers to preserving spirit.)

Alas, take heed! I say: "How dare I not listen and obey?"

Then Great Lazy One asked again: "I have heard there are three hearts—what does this mean?"

The master replied: "Indeed. They are called the Heavenly Heart, the Earthly Heart, and the Human Heart, yet in truth they are one. As the classics say: *'The heart is the mansion of spirit and brightness; the Dao of transformation arises from it.'* For the entire body moves or rests by the heart’s *qi*, just as a fish dwells in water. The ancients said: *'The solid parts of the body are Earth; the hollow parts are Heaven; bending and stretching, speech and sight and hearing—these are Man.'* They also said: *'The Heavenly Heart resides in the brain, the Earthly Heart in the abdomen, and the Human Heart in the Crimson Palace. The Crimson Palace’s heart is a solid yet empty, numinous, and unobscured entity—one thing containing three aspects.'* For the hearts in the brain and abdomen are formless and insubstantial, yet they are none other than the numinous *qi* of that solid, lotus-like center, ascending and descending with true presence. Thus I say they are one in truth."

Great Lazy One said: "I understand. *Intent* is what the heart emits. The heart itself is soundless and odorless; when thought stirs, it issues forth as intent. *Thought* refers to the present mind—it is the very heart itself. *Intent* is the heart’s resonance, meaning the thought has already arisen. The Buddhist epithet *Guanshiyin* is a great secret for cultivating body and mind—ponder it well. In my reading of the sutras, the character *shi* ('world') should be interpreted as *shen* ('body'), meaning to carefully observe the movements and stillness of *qi* within one’s own body, lest they stray into error. As Lü Dongbin said: *'The Great Dao teaches people first to stop thoughts; if thoughts do not cease, all effort is in vain.'* He also said: *'Fear not the arising of thoughts, but the slowness to awaken.'* Master Qingyunzi said: *'Thoughts still within the cavity are easily removed; once released outward, removal becomes harder.'* Thus the ancients said: *'Remove thoughts as they arise, and immortals will acknowledge you.'*"

Great Lazy One smiled and asked: "Is the secret of immortal cultivation limited to this? I have heard it said: *'To cultivate life without cultivating nature is the foremost flaw in practice,'* and also: *'To cultivate nature without cultivating life makes it difficult for the spirit to attain sagehood even after ten thousand kalpas.'* What does this mean?"

The master sighed: "Life without nature is not numinous; nature without life does not manifest. It means one must cultivate both nature and life. In my view, cultivating one part of nature preserves one part of life, for nature and life cannot be separated. In truth, sometimes one leans toward nature yet life is within it, or leans toward life yet nature is within it—like form and shadow, can they be divided? In cultivating the Dao, first establish your resolve: this is the foundation of nature’s work. Cherishing the body as jade is the foundation of life’s work. Proceeding further, stopping thoughts and eliminating delusion is the work of nature; regulating, abiding, and circulating the breath—its ascent and descent—is the work of life. Reflect on this: if thoughts do not cease, breath is not regulated, and delusion is not eliminated, progress is impossible. All practices of regulating, abiding, circulating, ascending, descending, blending, and uniting must unfold in a state of no-thought, no-worry, where all sounds are empty and not a speck of dust remains. Thus I say: *'Cultivate one part of nature, and you preserve one part of life.'* Do you agree?"

Great Lazy One replied: "Yes. You have tested this yourself. But in the alchemical tradition, the body has four seas: the heart is the Sea of Blood, the stomach the Sea of Grain, the kidneys the Sea of *Qi*, and the brain the Sea of Marrow. Their subtleties are not yet fully clear to me—would you elucidate?"

The master said: "An excellent question. The entire body relies on the natural *qi* of life to grow and take form. Only the Sea of Grain depends on postnatal, external food and drink to digest and transform, replenishing what the body’s *qi* lacks—this is common knowledge and needs no elaboration. Great Lazy One, do you understand why those who teach nourishing life always begin with the layer of *mingxin* (obscuring the heart)? It is because the heart is the Sea of Blood: when the heart is cool, blood is generated; when the heart is obscured, it becomes cool. The secret of *mingxin* lies in subtly guiding the heart’s *qi* with intent, withdrawing it to the front of the spine, sensing the body’s warm *qi* gathering protectively around the Crimson Palace—above, below, front, back, left, right, and center."

He continued: "In this way, the gentle *qi* of life, upon nearing the Crimson Palace, naturally transforms into blood, then diffuses through the muscles and channels. Its purest essence retreats and descends to the two kidneys, where the red and vibrant becomes the pure essence of *qi*, the Heavenly One. Great Lazy One, do you know whether those who teach nourishing life close their eyes before *mingxin*? Ah! Its meaning is profound, its principle refined."

The heart’s numinous spirit manifests through the eyes—this is the first principle. The two eyes also store the essence-*qi* of the liver’s *hun*, the lungs’ *po*, the spleen’s spirit, and the kidneys’ essence—this is the second. When the heart enters *mingxin* and the eyes close in advance, the *qi* of life from the viscera, limbs, interior, and exterior naturally gathers in audience at the Crimson Palace—this is the third. Moreover, whenever this gathering occurs and life-*qi* is spontaneously attained, it transforms of itself into pure blood without deliberate effort; its wondrous function also lies in the two eyes—this is the fourth. Furthermore, the ability to guide this pure blood, each following its *qi*, to distribute and moisten the channels, muscles, and interstices, arises entirely from the eyes suspended like sun and moon, illuminating all within and without, high and low, far and near—now with intent, now without, as if guiding yet not guiding—this is the fifth. You once said its mechanism lies in the eyes; from this, one may trust that the ancients’ words do not deceive.

The Lazy Master said: The kidneys are the Water viscera, called the Sea of *Qi*. You doubt this—good doubt indeed. Yet know this: that the Water viscera are called Water viscera does not mean the bladder stores turbid water. Rather, they are where the *qi* of our body’s breath gathers, purely postnatal yet divided into yin and yang—yang is called *qi*, yin is called fluid. These two kinds, without the fire of the body’s Great Yang to refine them, will stagnate and fail to transform, causing no small harm. The diseases they spawn are too numerous to name. What is the secret to refining them? It lies entirely in using the two eyes to guide true yang and store it in the Sea-Bottom. With a mind undistracted, the *qi*-mechanism flows unimpeded, neither inner nor outer, unaware of the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, or heaven and earth. Only then do you inwardly reflect upon the Sea-Bottom, sinking a crimson sun there (this is the crucial secret). If you forget, you must promptly awaken to its presence; when present, act as if forgotten (wondrous indeed is such practice). If lost, awaken to its presence as if it were stored; thus the cycle continues (this is the essential instruction). When this one sea is settled and free of harm—ah, Lazy One!

In Dao cultivation, those who begin are as numerous as ox hairs; those who succeed are as rare as rabbit horns. Why? Because they abandon this very gate of the Sea—such cases are everywhere under heaven. If you are truly resolved, persist in this practice. To persist without firmness, or to be firm without constancy, is of no benefit (heed this warning, heed it well!). Strive on, I urge you—ten thousand times, ten thousand times!

Heed this warning, heed it well!

Lazy Old Man says: Ah, Lazy One! Take heed—what was spoken above merely points to the crucial gate of the qi sea, yet the visions therein are manifold, beyond full recounting. Ten thousand words, a thousand teachings—all the scriptures of the Three Teachings, all the works of the Hundred Schools, filling ox-carts to the rafters—none but serve the single method of cultivating the heart-mind. Remember this, Lazy One.

Good fortune is not cause for delight; ill fortune is not cause for sorrow. All such favorable or unfavorable visions, though seeming real, are but illusions. When they arise, let the heart remain unmoved, the thoughts unshaken, the conduct unobstructed. The apparitions that manifest are never beyond two kinds: astonishment and joy. Yet within them, transformations and illusions often exceed all expectation. The unchanging principle is to remain unmoved. You must recognize them all as demonic illusions or as trials sent by the perfected ones above. Only by refusing to be swayed by demons can a person reveal their original true face.

Thus, whenever demonic disturbances arise, you should redouble your resolve and redouble your courage. Ah, Lazy One! Lazy One! The reason I cry out so urgently is that the demonic and the true cannot coexist, yet they always appear side by side. Why? Without demons, the Way cannot be revealed; if demons do not retreat, the Way cannot be accomplished. Strive on, Lazy One!

*(Xie’s note: Gains and losses are ever as ordinary—attend only to your cultivation, not to the harvest! This is most crucial!)*

Lazy Master says: The brain is called the Sea of Marrow—its principle is manifest and clear, requiring no tedious explanation. Yet this single sea, as the world describes its functions, is vast indeed! Most belong to the methods of earthly immortals or ghostly immortals, not the supreme Dao, and must not be followed. What you pursue and I practice is the singular tradition of heavenly immortals, refining to purely return to the primordial for the proper attainment. Thus, one must be cautious in what one refines.

Ah, Lazy One! You must understand the ultimate fruition of heavenly immortals and the pure subtlety of the primordial unified qi—its essence is utterly pure, utterly soft, yet utterly firm and utterly keen, such that not even metal or iron can obstruct it. What it passes through is transformed; what it preserves is spirit. *(Xie’s note: When qi lies hidden, it becomes supremely spiritual; when qi arises and manifests, there is progress and transformation.)* Vast as the cosmos or minute as a speck of dust, when expanded, it can embrace the three thousand great thousand worlds like the sands of the Ganges; when transformed, it can coalesce into countless beings, mountains, waters, palaces, halls, and temples. *(Such realms are not to be feared in attainment, only in attachment to spirit. Why? Once a thought stirs, these realms manifest endlessly, growing ever more wondrous. Once one clings to form, one enters the demonic path—minor attachment leads to demonhood, major attachment to instant death. Among those who cultivate the Dao in the world, many die thus, yet neither they nor their kin and fellow practitioners realize it, often believing they have attained the Dao and departed. The harm is no small matter! Thus, the school of heavenly immortals never regards such phenomena as proof of efficacy, but rather as demonic disturbances. If one sits and such visions appear, one must not attempt to dispel them with intention—doing so only transforms them into battlegrounds, with unpredictable manifestations of conflict and subjugation, inevitably leading to madness and death. Or one may be seized by demons and die, or fall into their snare. If by some chance one prevails in battle, one’s spiritual powers and magical abilities grow without cultivation, and the deluded practitioner takes this as clear proof of Dao attainment. Little do they know they have been lured into the demon’s trap—when their life ends, they merely become part of the asura retinue. Or, if defeated in battle and the spirit departs the body entirely, the shell may be occupied by a demon. Outsiders, unaware, believe the person has attained the Dao, testing their spiritual powers and magical abilities to find them no different from ancient immortals. The demon, possessing the body, practices its demonic ways, gathering followers like clouds. In its teachings, lust, wrath, greed, and deceit are deemed harmless to the true Dao, and those who follow are led into demonic realms, becoming demonic retinues. The leaders of heterodox sects like the White Lotus of past and present often arise from such deluded cultivation, their bodies possessed by demons to form these perverse teachings. This must not be unknown! Therefore, for all who cultivate the Dao, the great secret to subduing demons is to see yet not see, hear yet not hear—so-called, "Though wind and waves rise, I do not set sail." This teaches the crucial secret of not stirring thought. All who refine the Sea of Marrow must take heed!)*

When gathered, it forms shape; when dispersed, it becomes qi. It merges the Three Pure Ones without duality and unites the Three Teachings as one *(this refers to maintaining a single, clear, and unattached thought, allowing all existence and non-existence, blue and yellow, red and white to be as they are. Scholars, beware of clinging to gathering and dispersing, merging and uniting, or forms and colors)*. This is the ultimate fruition of heavenly immortals and the wondrous function of the primordial unified qi. Those of us with aspiration can surely attain it—this is no delusion, but the nature of resolve. As the ancient immortals said: "To learn immortality, one must learn heavenly immortality; only the Golden Elixir is most authentic." Thus, resolve must be firmly established!

How to refine this Sea of Marrow? Above, it connects with heaven; below, it penetrates the earth’s bounds. In the four directions and four cardinal points, it is boundless and infinite, its aspect serene and still. No mountains, rivers, or cities exist—only a radiant golden world and a luminous moon hanging in the sky. *(Xie’s note: This scene is the true image of the exact noon hour.)* This is the secret to beginning. If visions of jade terraces, jeweled chambers, the Ten Continents, or Three Islands appear, do not regard them *(this is the secret of "supreme virtue acting without action" and "having yet not having")*. Even if iron enclosures, impassable barriers, blade mountains, sword trees, or seas of flame and boiling pools arise, do not examine them *(this is the secret of not seeking through scrutiny)*. Only maintain a single, unattachable right thought and eliminate the stirring mind—this is the essential secret to mastering the Sea of Marrow.

As for the Valley Sea’s barrier, its refinement method is this: only use your hands to rub the abdomen, aiding your yang qi to dissolve and transform. Thus, the ancients, after eating, would first use one hand to rub from the middle of the stomach to the abdomen, walking slowly for about a hundred steps. Then, with their hand on the abdomen, they would move in circles as if polishing a mirror, from inside to outside, walking about three hundred steps. If the left hand tired, they would switch to the right. Then, they would quietly observe the qi mechanism until it flowed smoothly before stopping. Later, when finding leisure to sit, they would continue by closing their eyes, calming the mind, and visualizing the spirit in the Crimson Palace—thus, the qi of the central palace could transform into blood and reach the kidneys. Practicing this method ensures no harm from fluids transforming into phlegm or essence into yin. Though it seems an active practice, it is truly an aid to non-action *(this is the method of "inferior virtue acting with ceaseless function")*.

Lazy One, take note! Do not dismiss this as a minor practice—this is precisely my teacher’s secret method for preemptively refining yin essence. It is also extremely simple.

Lazy One rose and bowed, saying: "Understood!"

Having reverently received the teaching, Lazy One straightened his robes and cap, then spoke with utmost sincerity: "I have heard that if the Mysterious Pass remains unopened, the Sacred Embryo will not form; if postnatal nurturing is improper, the Sacred Infant will suffer inner affliction; if the transference of the immortal fetus is not conducted according to the Dao, the True Person will meet an early end. Fearing these, I humbly seek your instruction: for one such as myself, may the Mysterious Pass fortunately open? May the Sacred Embryo fortunately take shape?"

Hearing this, Lazy Old Man smiled warmly and leaned forward, saying: "You are mistaken—or perhaps you speak of your own experience? Your Mysterious Pass has already swung wide open on the previous night. *(As mentioned in the 'lower section,' this was precisely the clear sign of your Pass opening afterward.)* As for whether the Embryo has formed, you must ask yourself: Do you feel unobstructed throughout your entire body? Have you experienced the misty, billowing qi phenomenon? Have you attained the state where self and other dissolve into oblivion? *(These are all essential practices—only through diligence can they be achieved.)*"

Lazy One replied: "I have encountered all of these at times. *(To experience them often is most wondrous.)*"

The Old Man asked: "Have you reached the state where the myriad sounds are empty and the solitary spirit stands revealed?"

He answered: "I have glimpsed such moments, yet my regret is that I have not sustained them for long. *(If one could sustain them, the formation of the Embryo would be near.)*"

The Old Man then asked: "What signs have you observed in your Earthly Abdomen?"

Lazy One replied: "Whenever I sit in meditation, I feel threads of true qi descending from the heart in delicate strands. Soon after, I sense an inner vastness suddenly opening—boundless without, infinitesimal within—with all manner of true qi billowing and pouring inward. I feel this space as bottomless, yet warm; now as if fire were present, now as if absent, yet a gentle warmth arises, drifting and rising from the lower region, surging upward in all directions. It ascends directly behind me, thickly reaching the back and crown of the head. Then, I feel a sudden heat descending from below the throat, and upon reaching the Crimson Palace, it abruptly transforms into cool droplets. Passing the heart’s threshold, it suddenly turns into scalding liquid rushing downward, filling the abdomen with fiery warmth. My entire body feels thoroughly unobstructed.

Lazy One said: "If this is so, you are not far from forming the Embryo." He continued: "Great Lazy One, you must understand that the formation of the Heavenly Immortal’s Embryo differs from what is commonly heard. You must carefully study the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*—how to refine, how to form, how to gather, how to tend the firing, how to guard, how to nurture, how to bathe, how to apply, how to subdue, and how to transfer the spirit and change the crucible until liberation is complete. All these are fully described within. The most essential secret lies in thought within no-thought, like a hen brooding her eggs. Sitting upright in meditative absorption is the method of gathering; intermittent focus is the way of guarding; movement, stillness, sitting, and lying are the firing times."

He added: "Diligent yet unguided, you must meet a perfected one; guided yet indolent, you will remain a lowly ghost. Keep these four lines ever in mind as a reminder."

Asked: "Beyond the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, which books should I study?"

He answered: "*Inquiries in the Crane Forest*, *Revealing the Mysteries of the Mysterious Pass*, *On Nature and Life*, and externally, *The Ancestral Teachings of the Golden Flower*, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, *The True Principles of Heavenly Immortals*, *The Torch of Doubt*. Further, *The Seal of the Unity of the Three*, *Awakening to Reality*, and in broader scope, *Laozi’s Dao De Jing with Bai’s Commentary*, the *Vajracchedikā*, *Śūraṅgama*, and *Perfect Enlightenment* sutras. Alas! Ancestor Bai said: *'A word or half a phrase may unlock the mystery—what need for ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts? If one is not burdened by form, the Great Brahma Heaven lies before your eyes.'*"

*(Xie’s note: This compilation may be read alongside *Continuation of Fragmentary Sayings*. The Lazy One herein is Min Yide speaking of himself.)*

*Collected Insights on Women’s Alchemy*
Author: Liu Yiming

The immortal master’s surname was Liu, given name Yiming, style Wuyuanzi, also known as the Unadorned Recluse and the Clad-in-Rough-Cloth Recluse. His ancestral home was Quwo County, Pingyang Prefecture, Shanxi Province (now northeast of Wenxi County, Shanxi). From childhood, he devoted himself to cultivation and refinement, though he did not receive true transmission.

He abandoned a family fortune of ten thousand gold to pursue the Dao. He once wandered through Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Gansu, seeking instruction and visiting masters for many years. Later, he met the Elder of Kan Valley, who distinguished the true from the false, and again encountered the Immortal Liurenzhang, through whom all doubts vanished. Only then did he grasp the secret subtleties of the elixir path.

Thereafter, he secluded himself on Qiyun Mountain and Xinglong Mountain in present-day Yuzhong County, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, where he established altars to transmit the teachings and composed writings. His Daoist works number many; in the early Republican era, they were compiled into a collection titled *Twelve Daoist Books*. In *Collected Insights*, among the verse compositions, the Immortal Master composed a poem on *Women’s Alchemy*:

A thousand scriptures, ten thousand scrolls—all elixir methods complete,
The ancestral masters, in compassion, ferry across the dusty world.
The Great Dao makes no distinction between man and woman,
For yin and yang, the Five Phases, are all the same.
Only the true oral instructions for beginning differ,
Their applications as distant as heaven from the deep.
The sun refines qi—this is the man’s principle,
The moon refines form—the woman’s path and net.
Women find it even easier than men,
In three to five years, they attain immortality.
If I did not now reveal the crucial point,
Where would one board the dharma boat?
First, raise your hand to slay the Red Dragon,
Sever the Red Dragon, and misfortune vanishes.
Heavenly *ren* and earthly *gui* meet face to face,
The yin qi of the sea-bottom spirals up and down.
The Three Corpses and Six Thieves seek to steal the treasure,
The Seven Emotions and Five Aggregates return to the cinnabar field.
Grasp the sharp-edged sword of Moye,
To cultivate the lotus in the mire.
Seize the true unified qi of creation,
Gather the spirit to ascend and descend the waxing and waning moon.
The turbid blood transforms and vanishes without trace,
The two breasts retract to the chest, the trigrams invert.
Though the woman’s form resembles the man’s body,
The foundation remains firm, unchanged.
From here, enter directly the Yang Pass Way,
Choose a numinous site to complete the Great Return.
Within the vast emptiness, establish the crucible,
Where heaven and earth unite to refine the true lead.
Kick over the Eight Trigrams, beyond birth and extinction,
Seal the Three Treasures, cutting off all threads.
The ten directions of the world shrink to a millet grain,
The sands of the Ganges appear as a hair’s tip.
Reduce and reduce again—Dao diminishes daily,
Increase and increase again—merit connects.
Until there is nothing left to reduce or increase,
From non-being guard being, the sacred embryo firms.
In the *mao* and *you* hours, bathe with care,
Following the *Zhun* and *Meng* trigrams, in accord with nature.
The heart must be pure, the mind tranquil and settled,
Water fears drying, fire fears fanning.
The slightest leak spawns transformations,
The medicine in the crucible flees like flying smoke.
Diligently nurture it for ten months,
Then—with a thunderclap—beyond the heavens.
Guard it well, do not let it wander far,
Mature, roam the four seas’ edge.
Only then is the work complete and fulfilled,
As the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool rides her colored phoenix.
I now compose this *Women’s Alchemy*,
For boudoir heroes to delve into and study.
Burning incense and tending the fire are empty affairs,
Eating vegetarian meals and chanting sutras—mere lip-service.
To speak of returning to the Buddha-land after death
Is like gazing at plums to quench thirst—all vain illusion.
If this body is not liberated in this life,
One cannot escape the pull of evil destinies in the next.
But if one truly turns back and swiftly cultivates realization,
True women of the Dao will be transmitted through the ages.
Should anyone deceive the world with falsehoods,
They will forever sink into hell’s yellow springs.

*Woodcutter Yang’s Manual on Women’s Cultivation*
Transmitted by Pure Yang Ancestor Lü
Recorded by Fu Jinquan, the Helper of Unity

Refining form through the Great Yin differs little from the man’s method of cultivation. At the outset, close the eyes and abide in spirit, resting completely to still the heart and regulate the breath. Then concentrate the spirit into the qi cavity (above the heart’s hollow, between the two breasts). Cross the hands to cradle the breasts, gently massaging them twenty times. Draw the qi subtly upward from the lower cinnabar field thirty-six times. Again, use the hands to cradle the breasts, reflecting inward to harmonize the breath. Over time, the true qi will naturally come and go, opening and closing to form the *yin’e*. When spirit and qi are abundant, true yang flourishes of itself, the menstrual flow ceases, and the breasts resemble a man’s—this is called slaying the Red Dragon.

After long practice, there is no need to cradle the breasts or draw the qi; simply concentrate the spirit in the qi cavity, turning the light inward in reflection—this is the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The true breath drifts, emptiness reaches its utmost, stillness its depth. Yang qi steams and rises, the river chariot revolves, myriad purple clouds adorn the jade palace, a thousand blood vessels penetrate the mud-pill. One becomes aware of a single numinous light, neither inside nor outside, ascending from the lower field through the Crimson Palace and mud-pill, descending the heavy tower to return to the golden womb’s divine chamber. Turning the light inward, concentrating the spirit, the true breath rests within the central crucible—this is the spirit entering the chamber, the Mysterious Female, the embryonic immortal, the single point falling into the Yellow Court.

Thereafter, in ten months of effort, the yang spirit manifests, shattering emptiness. The path of true cultivation is the same for men and women, with no distinction between them.

*Secret Instructions on Women’s Alchemy*
by Wang Dongting, the Body-of-Truth Recluse

The study of nature and life is the same for men and women, with no difference. In sum, it hinges on the four words: *"utmost sincerity, focused attention."* The Book says: *"Only the utmost sincerity under heaven can transform."* The Classic says: *"Focus the mind to its utmost to heed the mandate."* For beginners, the first crucial step is nothing other than *"refining the self."* Refining the self means the heart and breath depending on each other. This dependence means the heart relies on the breath, and the breath also relies on the heart. But the most important is the word *"harmony."* The *Canon* says: *"Harmony follows."* It also says: *"Each attains its harmony."* Harmony does not depart from the center, the center does not depart from harmony. Are center and harmony one? Or two? Center and harmony united is called the Yellow Dame. When the Yellow Dame harmonizes, love, longing, swallowing, and spitting arise naturally. Continuous, unbroken, neither forgetting nor forcing. Laozi said: *"Can you concentrate your qi to attain suppleness like a newborn babe?"*

"The ultimate attainment of true central harmony." Yu Chan said: *"When the old husband and wife meet, affection lingers naturally."* The *Canon* states: *"Twist into one mass, blend into one place, forge into one sheet, temper in one furnace."* It also says: *"The Oxherd and Weaver Girl meet, yin and yang follow each other, crow and hare share a den, sun and moon share a palace, hun and po unite, metal and fire merge as one."*

When thoroughly realized, it is always spirit not departing from qi, qi not departing from spirit—thus the heart not departing from breath, breath not departing from the heart. Now, spirit is nature; qi is life. The *Canon* says: *"The root of nature lies in the heart; the stem of life lies in the breath."* This is so. One must know that only when the two unite is creation accomplished. For when the two unite, the Two Modes return to the One Supreme Ultimate—this is called *"dual cultivation of nature and life."*

Dual cultivation of nature and life simply teaches one that heart and breath must depend on each other, never for an instant parting. Thus, the White Patriarch said: *"Refining the medicine with fire to form the elixir is none other than guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao."* Each day in practice, one must hold the heart to the breath and the breath to the heart. After a moment’s duration, once equilibrium is naturally achieved, great stillness arises, and one enters into profound obscurity—dim and indistinct, boundless and formless, forgetting things and forgetting form.

The *Canon* says: *"Growing to complete the father’s body, by the mother the foundation is laid."* It also says: *"Know the white, guard the black, and spirit and brightness will come of themselves."* This is precisely that moment.

It seems as though body and mind awaken with an extraordinary softness and ease. As Sanfeng said: *"Like a mute tasting honey, it cannot be spoken."* Shaozi himself wrote:

*"From the dim and indistinct, yin and yang first transform,
The primal qi of heaven and earth begins its revolving.
Amidst this, a wondrous light appears—
How could one find the words to describe it?"*

The *Canon* says: *"Golden sand enters the five viscera,
Mist scatters like wind and rain.
Steaming and permeating the four limbs,
The complexion becomes joyful and radiant."*

For at this moment, the primordial qi arrives from the midst of emptiness and nothingness. Shaozi said: *"At the midpoint of the winter solstice,
The heart of heaven remains unchanged.
Where the first yang stirs,
Before the myriad things are born."*
This is what the alchemical texts call the *living midnight hour*,
And what Ziyang termed *"When gui arises, hasten to gather."*

Shangyangzi asked: *"What is gathering?"*
He answered: *"Gathering with the gathering that is no-gathering."*
*"And what is the gathering that is no-gathering?"*
*"Splitting open the primordial chaos."*

I explain: *"What is splitting open the primordial chaos?
It is the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness."*
For when one attains emptiness to its utmost and guards stillness to its depth, this is returning to Kun.
Now Kun is the southwest—
The land where the medicine is born,
The place of chaos,
The aperture of the Mysterious Female.
Mizi said: *"To seek the true seed of the primordial,
One must find chaos to establish the foundation."*
Zhang Ziyang said: *"To keep the Valley Spirit from ever dying,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation."*

Ah! Once the foundation is laid, the Valley Spirit does not die.
How then could a person die?

The above concerns refining the self and laying the foundation, gathering the great medicine of the primordial—identical for both men and women in cultivation. Thus it is said: *"The Great Dao makes no distinction between man and woman;
Yin and yang, the Five Phases are all the same."*

What follows speaks of the differences in post-heaven practice.

Liu Wuyuan’s *Women’s Elixir Formula* states: *"There is only one true oral instruction for beginning,
Yet their methods diverge as heaven from the abyss.
Cultivating qi in the Greater Yang—this is the man’s principle.
Cultivating form in the Greater Yin—this is the woman’s path."*

For man is yang, and his number is odd.
The *Classic* says: *"Heaven’s one generates water, and man receives it."*
Thus, he begins his work one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel, in the Kan palace.
Woman is yin, and her number is even.
The *Classic* says: *"Earth’s two generates fire, and woman receives it."*
Thus, she initiates her work between the two breasts, in the Li position.
This is an immutable principle.

What the medical texts call the *"breast stream"* and the alchemical classics term the *"breast chamber"* refers to this very aperture.

Of old, Lüzu transmitted the method to Immortal Zhang, saying:
*"Sit in fixed breathing between midnight and noon,
Pass through the Jiaji Gate and ascend Kunlun.
When you obtain the qi at that moment, think of me."*

He also said:
*"Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui divide midnight and noon.
You must recognize your own ancestral origin.
When the thunder of earth shakes the mountain’s peak, rain falls—
Wait to wash and nurture the yellow sprout as it emerges from the soil.
Seize the golden essence and firmly seal it,
Refining geng and jia to generate dragon and tiger.
When he asks who transmitted this to you,
Simply say the master’s surname is Lü."*

For one must refine the self to perfection before gaining mastery.
And one must daily steal the yang of heaven and earth,
Constantly steaming and bathing in it,
Before seeing any effect.
Whether one or two months, or three or four,
The duration depends on the depth of the practitioner’s effort.

At times during practice, one may suddenly feel qi in the aperture,
Bursting forth and splitting into two paths that surge straight to the breasts,
Penetrating to the nipples, making them firm and erect.
This is what the alchemical texts call the *living midnight hour* when the medicine is born.
Shaozi said:
*"Suddenly, in the dead of night, a clap of thunder—
A thousand doors in ten thousand households open in succession.
If you recognize the image hidden within the formless,
You may meet Fuxi himself."*

When the work reaches this point, the hundred vessels harmonize,
All gates and apertures open,
And truly, one’s whole being brims with spring.

Now *"between midnight and noon"* refers to the purest moment between *hai* and *zi*.
*"Fixed breathing"* means regulating the breath to evenness.
*"Sitting"* means the two (yin and yang) divide left and right,
As one must deploy them like left and right armies.
One earth stands at the center,
For both sides harbor the true earth.
When the true earth returns to the center, the qi flows unimpeded.
Thus, *"passing through the Jiaji Gate and ascending Kunlun"* is precisely the moment when the Yellow River’s current turns and a single channel opens.

*"When you obtain the qi at that moment, think of me"*—
*"Me"* is a metaphor for the pure yang qi,
And also for the perfected Taiyi Golden Immortal,
That is, the Taiyi containing the true qi.

*"Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui divide midnight and noon"*—
First, one establishes the four cardinal positions of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui,
Then distinguishes the four seasonal phases of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.
*"Recognize your own ancestral origin"* means to trace back to the moment of receiving the qi at birth,
To recognize that first speck of ancestral qi of the primordial.

*"When the thunder of earth shakes the mountain’s peak, rain falls"*—
This is the white clouds ascending to the celestial gate,
The sweet dew sprinkling the empty vastness.

*"Wait to wash and nurture the yellow sprout as it emerges from the soil"*—
*"Wait"* means to await the proper time.
*"Wash and nurture"* refers to bathing, purifying the heart, refining the self, and steaming.
*"Yellow"* is the color of earth.
*"Sprout"* is the mechanism of growth.
*"Emerging from the soil"* is a metaphor for the renewal of all things in the three springs—
The mountains, rivers, and great earth all take on a fresh hue.

At this moment, the yang qi connects with heaven,
The form blazes like fire,
The state resembles a scorching wind.
Swiftly gather it and send it into the Central Palace.
Thus it is said: *"Seize the golden essence and firmly seal it."*
Sanfeng said: *"Seize the golden essence and carefully guide it,
Send it into the Elixir Field to refine geng and jia."*

*"To generate dragon and tiger"* means that geng must generate jia,
And jia must generate geng—
This is the first stirring of the Dao.

*"When he asks who transmitted this to you,
Simply say the master’s surname is Lü."*
*"Lü"* implies mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture—
This is the heart-to-heart transmission,
The oral transmission of the golden elixir’s wondrous formula.

In essence, this teaching instructs one to guide the fire, urging the golden dragon to circulate through the *Zhoutian*, embodying the rising and descending of the *qi* of the Two Mysteries—Dragon and Tiger—through ceaseless diligent practice.

Ancestor Sanfeng said:
*"Wait until that single drop naturally submits,
Within the body, it transforms into the four seasons of spring.
A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance,
After each rain, everything is renewed.
All day in a daze, like a drunken man,
Leisurely guarding the spring within the cave.
When all yin essence throughout the body is stripped away,
It becomes a single mass of pure yang gold."*
Such is the way.

From this point onward, the practice aligns with that of men. Among the secrets of the female true elixir, this method is the most direct path. The Patriarch Lü did not greedily reveal the Great Treasure in a single day, yet alas, people fail to recognize it. Now I have explained it clearly: the point one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel and the cavity between the two breasts are both real. Yet one must not seek them through form.

As the scriptures say:
*"Clinging to this body is not the Dao,
Departing from this body is also in error."*
And:
*"The entire body, inside and out, is yin."*
And:
*"Gazing before your eyes, you fail to recognize the true."*
Moreover, the layers and fire phases within are subtle and refined; one must receive the oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction from a true master to grasp them with intention. Only then can one begin.

Master Shangyang said:
*"How can oral secrets be made clear on paper?"*
Do not force guesses or grope blindly, lest you mislead yourself.

With long and persistent practice, the yang *qi* will naturally arise, and the entire body will become extraordinarily robust—far surpassing the joys of gold, jade, wealth, or the pleasures of spouse and children. Even if a slight stirring of yang occurs, it must still be gathered and returned to the furnace. One must not descend to idle chatter or external affairs, so that through daily accumulation and monthly refinement, great efficacy may be achieved.

*Illustrated Explanation of Female Practice: Refining the Self and Returning the Elixir*
By Er’e Mountain Man

The Sage Master said:
*"Women, being of greater yin, first refine the form."*
At the outset of practice, the intention must dwell in the breasts, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—always thus. After forty-nine days of practice, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, the intention should guard the *Zhongji* (*Zhongji* being the cavity below the heart and above the *Blood Sea*, a suspended void at the center).

When walking or standing, silently guide the *qi* to the *Tianting*; when sitting or lying down, guard the *Zhongji* and *Blood Sea* with intention, like a hen brooding her eggs—no thoughts arising, all distractions absent. However, in this practice, before the true yin stirs and the meridians open, one may often feel drowsy. Thus, one must perform the exercise of *"pointing the brain downward."*

What is *"pointing the brain downward"*? It is the practice of *"turning the light around"*:
With the eyes gazing at the nose, fix the *Magpie Bridge*, descend through the *Xuan Ying*, pass the *Weighty Tower*, return to the *Zhongji*, and enter the *Blood Sea*—water meeting fire. After a moment of drowsiness, one will awaken (this is the method of regulating the medicine and refining the heart). If stray thoughts arise, return to guarding the *Zhongji*.

For young women practicing to a hundred days, undisturbed by external influences, the *Blood Sea* will naturally surge, and the true yin will stir (this stirring is not of body or mind but of the blood and *qi* rising like a tide, an indescribable yet blissful sensation—arising spontaneously from thoughtlessness. At this moment, one must not entertain thoughts, for thoughts will scatter it. Only by firmly holding the original spirit and employing the method of gathering can one proceed).

This is the arising of the *lesser medicine*, and the method of gathering must be applied two or three times (until the mechanism ceases). Then return to guarding the *Zhongji*.

The method of gathering:
With the eyes gazing at the nose, cross the *Magpie Bridge*, descend through the *Xuan Ying*, pass the *Weighty Tower*, enter the breasts, roam the *Zhongji*, return to the *Blood Sea*, part the waters, penetrate the *Jade Pillow*, ascend to the *Hundred Meetings*, descend through the *Muddy Pellet*, enter the *Bright Hall*, and finally return to the *Zhongji* and *Blood Sea*. Firmly guard the *Zhongji* and *Blood Sea* with true intention, entering stillness and samadhi.

If yin arises again, repeat the gathering method until the mechanism ceases, then return to guarding the *Zhongji* and *Blood Sea*.

In this practice, one must abstain from violent anger, wind, cold, heat, dampness, raw or cold fruits, and fried or baked foods. One must be vigilant, for if wind or cold enters the orifices, the medicine will be difficult to cure. All worldly concerns must be relinquished, and not a speck of dust should cling.

If one adheres to this method, the *qi* of true yin may stir two or three times in a single day.
*(This stirring must be discerned as true or false: there is the stirring of the *qi* mechanism, and the stirring of thoughts and desires. Only when it arises spontaneously from thoughtlessness, desirelessness, and intentionlessness can it be considered the true stirring of yin.)*

After one hundred and seven days, the blood will be entirely transformed into *qi*, the *Red Dragon* will be severed, and the body will become *qian*-like. The foundation is thus established—how could the returning elixir be difficult to achieve?

*(Note: Many female elixir texts claim that women must cease practice upon the arrival of the monthly flow, but this is erroneous, arising from a lack of clarity. The essence of female practice lies in the *qi* mechanism, yet there is a distinction between *ren* and *gui*. When *ren* water first arrives but *gui* has not, this is the onset of the flow. One will naturally sense it—perhaps with dizziness or lumbar pain. When the flow arrives but the tide has not, this is the time to turn the light around, silently guard the breasts and *Blood Sea*, and employ the gathering method to replenish the brain and build the foundation. What is gathered is *ren* water, not *gui* water. When *gui* water arrives, one should cease practice. After thirty *shi chen* (two and a half days), when *gui* is exhausted, resume the gathering method. How many days one gathers depends on profound oral secrets, which must be sought through a true master’s heart-to-heart transmission—do not guess blindly. If one receives proper instruction, even a young woman may establish her foundation in a hundred days.)*

Upon reaching this stage of practice, verification will naturally occur: the *Red Dragon* will be severed, the nipples will retract like those of a man, and the *qi* of true yin will transform into true yang.

At this stage, one must have a Dao companion of shared purpose for mutual support. When the true vision arrives, gather the *lesser medicine* and pass the barriers (the passage of the *lesser medicine* also manifests signs). Once the foundation is established and the medicine is produced, a fire-pearl will surge in the *Cinnabar Field*, the *Blood Sea* will boil like scalding soup, the nose will twitch, and the body will tremble—do not be alarmed. Here, too, there are oral secrets; only with a master’s guidance can danger be averted, lest the true fire become ordinary fire, risking either bodily immolation or madness.

For those who receive a true master’s transmission, once the medicine enters the crucible, one must know the method of refining it (the method awaits the master’s oral instruction). Without knowledge of the refining method, the medicine cannot congeal into the elixir, and what is gained will surely be lost. Since this is called the *lesser medicine*, one should employ the *lesser celestial cycle* of firing (the *lesser cycle* also has its oral secrets), advancing the *yang fire* and withdrawing the *yin tally* to temper it (the tally and fire have their proper timing and measures). Refine it until a full month’s cycle of the *lesser celestial* is complete. Whether the medicine is genuine or false, whether the elixir has formed, will naturally be verified. If the *lesser elixir* has indeed congealed, whenever one enters seclusion to sit in meditation, the entire body will radiate heat like steam from a steamer. One should silently guard the *Central Palace*, refrain from speech, and allow the transformations to unfold. In an instant, a fire-pearl the size of a bean will shoot from the *Hall of Light* to a height of over a *zhang*, flashing like lightning—this is the true realm of foundation established and medicine obtained.

At this time, though there are secret methods for refining the medicine, one must maintain a mind free of thoughts, with the five aggregates emptied. Even if the heavens overturn and the earth splits, thunder roars and lightning strikes, one should steadfastly seat the original spirit in the *Central Palace*, utterly fearless, like a hen brooding her eggs or a dragon guarding its pearl. When it is time to advance the fire, advance it; when it is time to withdraw the tally, withdraw it (advancing the fire and withdrawing the tally have their proper timing and measures). One must refine until reaching profound stillness and deep stability, with *qi* abundant and spirit complete, the fire-pearl no longer appearing, and the *lesser elixir* fully congealed.

These are the three layers of oral secrets: establishing the foundation, obtaining the medicine, and congealing the elixir. Beyond this lie four further layers, but the celestial mechanism cannot be fully disclosed at once—all immortals throughout history have transmitted their teachings in this manner. If one’s practice and conduct reach this point, the fruition of *human immortality* is attained! Thereafter, the method of practice is no different from that of men. However, as women belong to the tranquil body, though the latter four layers share the same operations as the male elixir, their progress will be even swifter!

**True Master’s Final Remarks:**
Widows, chaste maidens, and women of steadfast virtue—those who establish true and unwavering resolve, remain constant to the end, withstand demonic obstacles without retreat, endure to the point of death without wavering, remain unmoved by wealth or poverty, and maintain unshakable fidelity—may be taught these three layers of wondrous methods. Proceeding step by step, they will be invisibly protected by celestial immortals, and no inner or outer demons will dare disturb them, ultimately ensuring great accomplishment. As for married women, whose worldly affairs remain unresolved, this must not be rashly transmitted. It is only fitting to advise them to cultivate their nature, restrain desire, honor their mothers-in-law, and respect their husbands, awaiting the proper time for transmission. If one carelessly imparts these teachings without due caution, there will indeed be consequences. There is not a word of falsehood or reckless speculation here—this is truly a celestial mechanism that must not be lightly disclosed. Those who receive this transmission do so by virtue of past karmic affinity. Guard it well and treasure it.

*"Noon is the root of yin, midnight the sprout of yang.
Men possess yang externally and yin internally; women possess yin externally and yang internally.
Men seize external yang to ignite the inner elixir; women seize internal yin to ignite the outer elixir."*

In women’s practice, the first priority is to understand how to gather the yin within the body to replenish the yang within. Yang is essence and *qi*; yin is spirit and blood.

When is the time for gathering? Know that it is the moment when the monthly flow is about to arrive and when it has just ceased. What is this "flow"? It is like a traveler who has not yet returned, yet word of his coming arrives first. At the time when the signal arrives but the flow has not yet come, hasten to practice—either in full lotus or in Avalokiteśvara’s half-lotus—awaiting the stirring of spirit and *qi* within the body. Turn the light inward to illuminate the breast cavity and the Sea of Blood. Regulate the breath through the nose until even. Then, using true intention (that is, the Yellow Dame), guide the stirred spirit and *qi* from the Sea of Blood upward along the Caoxi pathway, straight to the fontanel, then descend from above to the breasts, and finally return to the Central Pole.

This method must not be used carelessly (it may be employed when the signal has come but the flow has not yet arrived, or after the flow has ceased for a day and a half). If one rashly gathers before the flow has fully ended, it will surely lead to mortal harm. Remember this well.

For young women whose blood and *qi* are abundant and whose minds are tranquil, three months of practice will suffice to sever the Red Dragon and restore the body to youth, the complexion like peach blossoms. When the practice reaches this stage, one will resemble a drunken person—dazed and silent—with a radiance that persists day and night, unscattered. After a year of steadfast practice, the foundation will be firmly established, and the work of becoming a Human Immortal will be verified.

For middle-aged women, cultivation requires the method of refining the form through the Great Yin. Those who practice this must eliminate thoughts and desires, forget emotions and worries, and only then proceed. Calculate the exact day and hour when the monthly flow is due. Two or three days before its arrival, begin quiet nurturing. When the signal comes, sit upright in a quiet chamber, hands resting on the knees, the index fingers forming a *zi-wu* mudra. Close the eyes, gather the spirit, regulate the breath, and inwardly observe, directing the gaze from the breasts to the Sea of Blood. Wait until the true yin *qi* stirs, then proceed with the refining practice.

In this stage, one must distinguish between true and false, pure and turbid. If one refines false yin or turbid *qi*, illness will surely follow, and no medicine will avail. When true yin stirs, the entire body will feel soft as cotton, resembling a drunken state. At this moment, the Sea of Blood will seem like a fish gulping water—its joy indescribable. This is the true realm of true yin’s manifestation.

Once this scene appears, use true intention to guide the *qi* past the Jiaji, up the Jade Pillow, through the Muddy Pellet, across the Magpie Bridge, down the Double Towers, into the breasts, and finally return to the Central Pole and the Sea of Blood.

If the body is weak and the *qi* feeble, and after two or three months true yin shows no sign of stirring, one may resort to deliberate effort: first knead the right breast twelve times, then the left breast twelve times, rub the navel and abdomen thirty-six times, and swallow saliva three times. After swallowing, resume the inward illumination as before, maintaining extreme emptiness and profound stillness. Practicing thus at the *zi* and *wu* hours daily without fail, within a month signs of stirring will appear, and gathering and refining may begin.

When true yin is entirely transformed into yang *qi*, the nipples retract, the Red Dragon is severed, and the body becomes masculine—then the work of refining the form through true yin is complete.

A poem says:
*"The face like peach blossoms, the skin like snow,
At this stage, the Red Dragon is forever cut off.
The pure Dharma-body is originally without dust;
When the work is complete, one ascends to the Jade Palace."*

Once the elixir foundation is laid, the Returned Elixir may be anticipated. With the Red Dragon severed, yin blood is wholly transformed. Yang *qi* cannot long abide in the Sea of Blood within the Cinnabar Field; it must pass through the barriers to become the Dharma-body. At this time, the body grows hot as fire, and *qi* surges like pearls. Then one employs the work of the Returned Elixir, which is no different from that of men.

When the elixir returns to the ancestral aperture of the Cinnabar Field, one proceeds with the work of refining the medicine through the Microcosmic Orbit. The Mysterious Pass is the ancestral aperture of the myriad spirits and *qi*; within it, the primordial ancestral *qi* gathers and congeals. One should breathe softly and continuously, focusing the intention without distraction. The two *qi* will naturally merge, the eight vessels will naturally flow, and the immortal embryo will naturally form.

Proceeding to the next stage, after three years of refining the self, the Great Return is achieved, and the sacred embryo is formed. When the immortal embryo is complete and the ten-month firing process is fulfilled, the infant will manifest. One may hear the sounds of strings and flutes, or see light in a dark room. Future events, the thoughts of others—nothing will be hidden, and all will be known upon encounter.

At this point, one may cultivate a body beyond the body. Whatever visions arise, do not cling to them, nor fear them. Simply maintain single-mindedness at the center. After nine years of facing the wall, when yin is exhausted and yang is pure, form and spirit will both be perfected, merging with the Dao in truth. Awaiting the imperial summons to ascend, one becomes an eternal attendant of the Queen Mother, liberated from the wheel of worldly rebirth.

Consider: a few years of effort yield boundless joy for eons. Why should women of this world hesitate to undertake this?

Lüzu says:
*"How laughable are those in the world who study the Dao,
Debating heaven and earth, discoursing on cultivation.
Ignorant of the wondrous celestial mechanism,
Unclear on the three families’ medicinal substances.
Without refining the true transformation within the furnace,
One cannot escape suffering and sinking in the bitter sea.
I now transmit to you the principles of the Three Teachings,
Revealing the wondrous work of cultivation.
First speak of astronomy and geography—
The Three Powers of heaven and earth must be mastered.
Men cultivate by taming the White Tiger;
Women cultivate by severing the Red Dragon.
Heaven and earth circulate through measured degrees;
Sun and moon revolve in their transformative work.
Five thousand four hundred and eight return to the Yellow Way,
Where metal, wood, water, and fire meet in turn.
Women are originally bodies of Great Yin—
Know the wondrous work of Great Yin’s transformation.
Each day it moves thirteen degrees to the right;
After two and a half days, it enters a new palace.
In a month, it completes a full celestial circuit—
Women’s qi and seasons follow the same pattern."*

To know the true oral formula of the Golden Elixir,
Heaven and humanity’s transformations are fundamentally interconnected.
Grasp the wondrous subtleties within,
And scrutinize the dark, new, crescent, and full moons with care.
The mechanism of the monthly cycle first stirs—
After two and a half days, the work begins in earnest.
If one comprehends the marvel of heaven’s mechanism,
How can the woman’s practice fail to be exquisitely refined?

There is yet another segment of the true Golden Elixir formula,
To be discussed in detail with the immortals.
Hang the Seven-Star Precious Sword in the southwest,
And beneath the Twin Trees, revolve the wheel.
In the dish, precious pearls appear in pairs,
A single white ox pierces through Kunlun.
At the hundred-foot pole, hastily let go,
Riding the ox to chase the moon, accompanied by an old monk.
Again, strike the golden bell of the Shadowless Temple,
Where water in the sixth month turns to ice.
The stringless zither plays the *Three Refrains*,
The holeless flute sounds the *Eight Tones*.
The Wood Mother runs as a wooden horse,
The Metal Duke follows the Golden Crow in flight.
The two overturn rivers and upend seas,
Soon ascending the Pavilion of Lofty Peaks.
A single drop of true sweet dew is sprinkled,
And suddenly, the seven apertures radiate light.
At this step, press forward with each step,
Never allowing disturbance or procrastination.
Wait for that single drop to return to the vessel,
Where the two and five congeal, becoming perfectly luminous.

If one asks who composed this song,
It was passed down by two mouths to deliver the female immortals.
Within it, all wondrous principles are fully encompassed—
Do not fail to heed my earnest admonitions.

**The Ten Principles of the Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation by the Queen Mother of the West**
**Preface to the Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation**

The Pure Yang Master vowed to ferry all beings, having already composed the *Annotations on the Nine Emperors’ Elixir Canon* as a bridge for men’s immortal cultivation. Yet he could not bear to witness women of latent roots and innate Daoist aspirations deprived of true transmission, straying onto false paths and sinking into ghostly realms. Thus, on the first day of the first month of winter in the *jiwei* year, at the Radiant Splendor Tower, moved by the Non-Dual Immortal Maiden, he sincerely expounded the true transmission orally bestowed by the Queen Mother of the West upon Lady Wei Huacun, originally titled *The Great Golden Elixir Formula for Women*. He revised it into *Nine Principles of the Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation*, still prefacing it with the Queen Mother’s name, and requested the proclamation of the *Nine Precepts for Female Immortals* to rectify Daoist mores. Together, they form ten principles, all to be reverently received under the compassionate decree. Yet what is most precious is the ability to personally embody them.

The Immortal Maiden exhorted: the Dao’s application is boundless, yet its foundation begins with these ten principles. Thus, this preface.

The Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign Sun Zhenyi said: Are there truly no *Elixir Books for Female Immortals* in the world? Most are muddled with distorted theories, leading deluded followers to fabricate and attach falsehoods, deceiving themselves and others. Some even guide others into the realm of spirits, spreading calamity without end. The Dao’s Ancestor, in his profound magnanimity, lamented only their descent into ghostly realms. I have long grieved over this! Fortunate to receive the Dao’s Ancestor’s commission to edit and revise, I have thus refined it. Following the original text of the *Great Golden Elixir Formula for Women* by the Queen Mother of the West and incorporating the *Mysterious Shadow of the Great Dao* orally transmitted by the Jade Purity Divine Mother, I compiled nine principles and presented them for scrutiny. The Dao is not meant to remain forever hidden, and I was graciously permitted to revise it. Entitled *The Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation by the Queen Mother of the West*, it is prefaced with the *Nine Precepts for Female Immortals*, forming ten principles in total. I further requested the elucidation of its profound secrets, so that women cultivating the Dao—though the Earthly Way achieves no completion yet fulfills its end—may know the great Dao of assisting in transformation and nurturing life, and may personally embody and diligently practice it. All are to reverently receive this under the compassionate decree. Henceforth, the lineage of female immortals will not only avoid straying onto false paths but will also easily ascend to the celestial gates. The proper course of the Dao is to be vigorously revitalized. With reverent joy, I bow and inscribe this preface at the Radiant Splendor Tower in Wulin, to mark this felicitous occasion.

The Orthodox Daoist Descendant of the Complete Truth Tradition, Sun Zhenyi, bows a hundred times and respectfully writes this preface.

**Supplemented and Narrated by the Primordial Sovereign Sun**

**First Principle: The Nine Precepts**

It is said: For women’s cultivation, the Nine Precepts must be received. The precepts state: Perseverance in practice yields great benefit; when the precepts’ fruits are perfected, one avoids the suffering of hell, is born into a family of the ten virtues, has one’s name inscribed in the Purple Palace, and ranks among the immortals. Now, in proclaiming the *Correct Path for Women’s Cultivation*, the *Nine Precepts* shall serve as the first principle. The text reads:

Be filial, respectful, gentle, and harmonious; speak cautiously and without jealousy.
Maintain chastity and tranquility in body, distancing oneself from all impure conduct.
Cherish all living beings, practicing compassion and refraining from killing.
Be diligent and cautious in rituals and recitations, abstaining from meat and wine.
Wear plain and simple clothing, avoiding ornate adornments.
Regulate and nurture one’s nature and emotions, preventing the arising of afflictions.
Do not frequently attend vegetarian feasts.
Do not cruelly employ servants.
Do not conceal goodness or broadcast evil.

Only by observing these Nine Precepts may one receive and uphold the correct path. For what is proclaimed here is most precious and noble. To transmit or receive it without precepts is to profane the celestial treasure. Both the giver and receiver shall be equally punished—be cautious and vigilant.

The Second Precept: *Root of Life*

If it is said: The second precept for women on the correct path is titled *"Root of Life."* Women, being of yin essence and resembling the moon, at the ages of thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen, possess abundant primordial *qi* and full true blood. Within yin there exists a single yang, and the moon’s radiance is at its brightest. Yet when *heavenly gui* descends, the primordial *qi* is broken, and true blood is drained. After marriage, should they bear sons or daughters, the primordial *qi* gradually depletes, and true blood steadily wanes. Though the monthly *water of fidelity* renews each month, it is also harmed each month.

<*Xie’s Annotation:* *Heavenly gui* marks the moment when yang reaches its peak and yin arises—this yin being impure yin. The arrival of *heavenly gui* knows no distinction between male and female, nor even among all living species, for all possess the "fidelity" of *heavenly gui.* *Heavenly gui* is the unified whole, the undifferentiated primordial state. The moment this whole is "broken" is called *heavenly gui.* Thus, the Dao of internal alchemy lies in returning to this state, preserving the harmony of the center. For women cultivating the elixir, severing the *Red Dragon* follows this principle.>

The difficulty of women’s cultivation lies precisely here. To preserve life and return to the origin, a woman must seek the method of cultivation. With the method, success comes swiftly. This is titled *"Root of Life"* because a woman’s life remains bound to *heavenly gui.* If *heavenly gui* is not transformed, how can life be preserved? Without this transformation, there is no return to the origin—hence the preciousness of the cultivation method. Thus, the *"Nine Precepts"* form the first precept, while *"Root of Life"* is the second, embodying the principle of *first nature, then life.* Following this precept, the next is titled *"Origin of Nature,"* for the cultivation of nature is precisely for the preservation of life.

<*Editor’s Note:* The entire text, with the first precept composed by Lü Dongbin, was later revised and compiled by the Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign. Lü Dongbin further refined it to ensure clarity, fearing that ornate language might obscure meaning and mislead later generations. Readers must not dismiss the text as unrefined and doubt its divine authorship. As for the tenth precept, it was entirely composed by Lü Dongbin, expanding upon the principles established thereafter.>

The Third Precept: *Origin of Nature*

The Third Precept: *Origin of Nature*
If it is said that the third precept of the proper path for women’s cultivation is titled *"Origin of Nature,"* this speaks to the nature of women: they are of water-nature and flower-essence. When young and their awareness has awakened, they must discipline themselves, refrain from frivolous play, and guard against reckless movement. At this time, there naturally resides within the inner *yin* a speck of initial essence—like a star, like a pearl—this being the primordial chamber of the utmost, concealed above the *Kun*-womb, positioned within the Central Yellow. If a woman at this time knows to purify her nature, refrains from viewing lewd plays or hearing lewd words, maintains serene conduct, moves in accordance with inner principles, and in stillness remains composed, then this single entity will adhere to the celestial nature, becoming the primordial unity, the unchanging crimson pearl, the untransformed celestial water. Yet how few worldly women possess such knowledge! In their childlike nature, they delight in movement—whether in play or in running and leaping—unaware that their *qi* stirs, their heart sways, their spirit becomes internally disordered, and their true *jing* is unsettled. Then this star-like celestial treasure naturally melts away, its heat like fire, bursting through the gate and shattering the door to descend—what the world calls *tian gui*. From this point onward, even if she guards her chastity and remains unmarried, she is still but an ordinary woman. There is no other reason for this but her failure to recognize the *"Origin of Nature."* If she aspires to return to cultivation, she must begin from the foundation below.

[Editor’s Note: The *inner yin* refers to the *yin* gate. Below, there is also the *spring gate*, likewise called the *yin* gate, hence the gate of the Central Yellow is termed the *inner yin*. Further note: The initial essence, the treasure of life, if one does not know to cultivate it, will adhere to the celestial nature and transform into primordial unity. Ancient sagely women practiced this—Bodhisattva Guanyin and the Heavenly Consort are clear examples. Though the world is not lacking in wise women, alas! They lack immortal parents within and sagely teachers without, leading to a thousand wisdoms and a thousand falls.]

[Commentary by Xie: Before the arrival of the monthly flow, the essence-*qi* is the primordial undifferentiated unity, concealed within the "center" of the Yellow Path. Though this essence-*qi* is the yang of growth and possesses a nature of dispersion, the cycle has not yet arrived, and consciousness has not taken flight, so the essence-*qi* does not leak—this is called maidenly purity. At this stage of cultivation, there is no need for foundational work; one may proceed directly to transforming spirit and returning to emptiness, achieving the elixir and attaining the Dao in a single step. This is called the *qingjing* (pure stillness) cultivation of nature, where *qi* is transformed into spirit, and spirit into *qi*.]

The Fourth Precept: *Cultivating the Menses*
If it is said that the fourth precept of the proper path for women’s cultivation is titled *"Cultivating the Menses,"* this speaks to the fact that once a woman’s *tian gui* has descended, her true *qi* has been broken, and her true blood has been depleted, if she does not engage in cultivating the menses, her true blood will diminish day by day, and her true *jing* will wane. Even if she wishes to cultivate diligently, what benefit can there be? The *Canon of the Elixir* states: *"When bamboo is broken, it must be mended with bamboo."* What is the method? *"For those who still have their monthly flow, first sever the Red Dragon; for those who no longer have it, they must first restore it before severing it again."*

[Commentary by Xie: True blood is true *yin* primordial essence, called *divine water* in the elixir texts. In the postnatal realm, true *qi* is the single speck of true yang within true blood; in the prenatal realm, true blood is the wondrous function of true *qi*—the *"one encircling nurturing yin."*]

[Further note: In the elderly, *yin* is abundant and *yang* is scarce, true *jing* is exhausted, so the priority is to supplement *qi*. When *qi* is sufficient, the menses will naturally return, and the foundation for supplementing blood will be established. In the young, *qi* is abundant, so the priority should be to supplement true *yin*.]

In all cases, the initial practice employs the method of the *zhou tian* (microcosmic orbit). At the *zi* and *wu* hours, sit astride as if riding a crane, release all concerns, and knock the teeth seventy-two times to open the *fei shu* (lung transport) points. Then, using both nostrils, gently inhale and exhale thirty-six times to circulate the blood and vessels throughout the body. At this time, fearing that *jing* may leak downward, one must sit firmly, not allowing any slack. Place both hands below the navel and above the gate, directing *yi* (intent) backward and upward, circulating for approximately thirty-six breaths. Next, raise both hands as if supporting the heavens, ensuring that *yi* remains at the *wei lü* (tailbone), guiding *qi* backward and upward, continuing for about thirty-six breaths. Then perform slow lifts thirty-six times and rapid lifts thirty-six times, until one feels the *qi* at the tailbone stirring, with a surging upward momentum. After this, lower the hands and place them on the waist, vigorously raising both shoulders thirty-six times, until one feels the *qi* at the *jiaji* (spine) gate and *fei shu* points stirring and ascending. If there is any blockage, clench the teeth tightly, focus *yi* on the back of the neck, and lift straight upward thirty-six times, until one feels the *yu zhen* (jade pillow) and *ni wan* (mud pill) open. Only then, cover the upper lip with the lower lip, applying gentle pressure, so that the *qi* from *ni wan* descends to the lower part of the nose. At this time, simply rest the tongue on the *heavenly bridge* without force, focusing *yi* on the point where the tongue rests, and the sweet dew will naturally descend. Then, slightly contract the nose [Commentary by Xie: Focus *yi* on the *shan gen* (mountain root), otherwise the *qi* may scatter], and direct the dew downward with *yi*, swallowing it straight to the *jiang que* (crimson palace). Retain it there for a moment, then guide it backward with *yi*, splitting it left and right to the waist, each side rotating thirty-six times. Next, guide it with *yi* to the navel wheel, rotating left thirty-six times and right thirty-six times, until one feels the entire abdomen unobstructed. At this time, place both hands below the navel and above the gate. Direct *yi* to lift simultaneously on both sides, raising thirty-six times, until one feels a single speck enter the *zi gong* (womb). Then, maintain a state of *ruo cun ruo wang* (as if present, as if absent) for a brief moment.

This outlines the general method of refining the meridians, though within it lies an unexcelled living technique that cannot yet be spoken of—yet it is nothing beyond the phrase "abide in quiescent emptiness and observe."

[Commentary by Xie: This method of practice is overly effortful and truly unsuitable for beginners. Its essence lies in "naturalness," guiding in accord with the moment rather than forcing intention. Thus the closing line states: "nothing beyond abiding in quiescent emptiness and observing." The instructions such as "rotate so many times, lift so many times" should be understood flexibly—indeed, the heart-mind and breath interdependently observed with martial fire, nothing beyond "single-mindedness."]

[Editorial note on locations: The *zi gong* (womb) is the inner *pin* (feminine gate), the mysterious aperture in men. The *Dan Shu* states: "Yang is called *xuan* (mysterious), yin is called *pin* (feminine gate)." Combined, this is what the *Laozi* terms the "gate of the mysterious feminine" and what the *Huangdi Yinfu Jing* refers to as the "marvelous vessel." Whether called marvelous vessel, mysterious aperture, feminine gate, or womb, though the names are four, the cavity is one. Editorial note: Here it is termed *zi gong* (womb) to borrow human affairs for clarity, yet it is evident that both the sacred embryo and the mundane embryo coalesce therein.

[Commentary by Xie: This aperture is a living aperture; its "form" manifests only when *qi* arises, not confined to a fixed, tangible yin cavity.]

Further note: The phrase "nothing beyond" implies there is a subtle message to be embodied and practiced—take heed not to be careless. When the womb receives a spiraling surge of warm *qi*, the gate of the spring must be tightly sealed, never loosened, to attain a sense of ease. The greatest danger lies in the arising of thoughts; even a trace of attachment leads to the entire body dissolving into numbness. Not only must one swiftly settle the mind—here the paths of immortality and mortality diverge.

[The text warns to keep the gate tightly closed, never careless. If the gate slackens even slightly, true *qi* will leak. The following passage describes even greater peril: at that moment, the gate’s interior must experience extraordinary tingling; with further lifting and sealing, the feminine gate within attains an exceptional ease. Without settling the mind—

[Commentary by Xie: Here one should remain unmoved in heart, further entering the practice of heart-mind and breath interdependently merging into emptiness, forgetting form and appearance.]

—one will inevitably dissolve into numbness throughout the body.

[Commentary by Xie: True *qi* escapes through the skin.]

Slipping into the sea of desire, even if one seeks to settle the mind, it may be too late. Thus it is said: "here the paths of immortality and mortality diverge."

Master Taixu said: "The method lies solely in *gen bei* (stabilizing the back); only then is the mind settled."

[Commentary by Xie: Place the heart-mind "at rest" within the aperture of the *jiaji* (spine). Yet one must habitually temper and nurture this aperture to full maturity, cultivating the power of inherent nature to purity and depth, only then can one avoid loss. Otherwise, clinging to the physical body, one may not see its benefits before encountering its harm.]

Otherwise, the gate will surely open wide, and essence will leak like a pouring stream. Alas!]

At this moment, one must swiftly quiet the heart-mind for an extended time, waiting in stillness until the *Zigong* (Palace of the Child) settles into tranquility—this is precisely what Wei Yuanjun meant by *"treasure returned to the Northern Sea, securely at rest."* Yet this remains but a "yellow leaf to silence a child’s cry"; one must not mistake it for the formation of the embryo.

[Cautious note: The *Juehai* (Sea of Awareness) is the Southern Sea. Thus, this *Zigong* is the Northern Sea, though its position lies north of the *Zhongji* (Central Pole) and *Zhonghuang* (Central Yellow)—the locus of the *Zhouyi*’s *"yellow center through which principle flows."* Here, front and back define south and north, not above and below. (Xie’s note: The path governed by the three fields of the *Renmai* (Conception Vessel) is called the Southern Sea, rooted in the "heart"; the path governed by the three passes of the *Dumai* (Governor Vessel) is called the Northern Sea, rooted in the single aperture of the *Yinqiao* and the lower *Dantian*.) Moreover, Wei Yuanjun’s verse provides ample proof—only when the *Zigong* is stilled may one cease practice. (Xie’s note: The stilling of the *Zigong* means the "fire of the heart" has descended, the *Juehai* is waveless, and all has returned to the Northern Sea.)]

Privately, I observe that this pertains to cultivation with the "Red Dragon" still present, extending to the stages after the Dragon is severed. Such practice demands utmost stillness in the body; a single act of carelessness, and all effort is ruined—hence the saying, *"here the paths of immortality and mortality diverge."* Further note: This method embodies the entire process of *"round reflection"*—the return to the origin and restoration of the root. When the embryo is formed, the mysterious landscape is complete. Yet this refers to refining and returning the heaven-and-earth and five phases within the body to their primordial treasure, still a minor return. Such a treasure may be attained in a day or an hour, as the *Dan Book* states: *"one grain returns to one grain."* (Xie’s note: This denotes the effects of foundational work, beginning from the inner mysterious aperture, accumulating essence and amassing *qi*: *"one grain returns to one grain"* signifies accumulation, for each day brings a time of yang’s birth.) Thus, the "yellow leaf" is used as an analogy, but the true art lies in the secrets of gathering, refining, guiding, and settling—this is the complete process of the *"great return’s* mysterious reflection." One must carefully discern this; do not pass over it recklessly. (Xie’s note: Though this discusses the minor return, the methods of the great return that follow are fundamentally similar—hence it is called the *"mysterious reflection,"* the "shadow" of the great return.)

**Fifth Method: Returning and Restoring**
If we speak of the proper path for female cultivation, the fifth method is titled *"Returning and Restoring."* It refers to women in the world—some who reach old age without their bodies becoming pure, others whose Dragon is severed by forty-five or forty-six—all of whom should cultivate to restore their original state, returning to the condition of a maiden. This practice and method are those of the previous four methods, with only this difference: what was formerly drawn upward and backward is now directed forward and downward, flowing back to the *"stream and sea."*

**Fifth Method: Returning and Restoring (Continued)**

When swallowing the sweet dew, allow it only to linger in the throat without sending it downward. Then, use the hands to massage the *"breast stream"*—thirty-six rotations to the left, thirty-six to the right—until this *"stream and sea"* reveals a subtle, flowing savor. Next, gently massage both breasts: thirty-six slow strokes, thirty-six swift strokes, light at first and then heavy, each performed thirty-six times, totaling one hundred forty-four. Naturally, one will feel the true *qi* suffusing the breasts and the stream, as cool fluid like a spring emerges from the *"twin passes"* and surges into the *"Southern Sea."* Calm the mind and await this, without allowing the *qi* to disperse into the waist. Instead, release all thoughts within the *"Central Palace,"* refraining from any deliberate guidance, letting it disperse of its own accord. The entire body will then feel exceedingly clear and harmonious.

Practicing thus without interruption each day, the weak will gradually grow strong, the frail will gradually become robust, and the aged will gradually regain youth. The complexion will bloom like flowers, the breasts will gradually retract like those of a maiden, and within, something will congeal like a peach pit. Within a hundred days, the *Heavenly Water* will attain a hue like rouge, and after three days, proceed with the practices of the fourth method—without the slightest addition or alteration—and the *Red Dragon* will be severed once more. Yet only when the sun and moon appear as twin rings is true attainment achieved.

*(Xie’s Note: This method is none other than the practice of *"mind and breath interdependent, guarding the center and embracing the One,"* beginning cultivation from the female upper cinnabar field. This is called *"generating qi through spirit, transforming blood through qi,"* thereby restoring menstruation. *"Generating qi through spirit"* means that when spirit returns to the body’s *"center,"* qi naturally returns; when qi returns to the *"heart"* and is further refined by *"emptiness and stillness,"* it transforms into blood.)*

*(Careful Note: The* Daoist Canon *states that even in elderly women, there may still be menstrual flow. Yet this is not true menstrual flow—it is merely the fluids of food and drink.)*

The substance formed by the mingling of the people’s ministerial fire, which fails to return to the liver and spleen, may transform into intestinal bleeding, red vaginal discharge, or inverted menstruation—all manifestations of this same matter. These conditions all stem from deficiency. Thus, whether the menses cease prematurely or require restoration, the method of repair is the same: only after the body is refined to resemble that of a virgin may one proceed with the severing of the Red Dragon.

*(Xie’s Note: The character "得见" should be read with the rhyme of "现," for here "见" is pronounced as "现." The encounter is unplanned, arising not from deliberate arrangement or calculation, hence it is called "现"—simply a natural occurrence! "See" here signifies the appearance of signs, which can only be perceived when the heart is still and the body at rest. The character "现" in "现若" refers to manifestation, and when the body is attuned, the signs become visible. These two characters—"见" and "现"—carry distinct layers of meaning, and one must not read them carelessly.)*

**Sixth Principle: The Breasts**
If we speak of the proper path of female cultivation, the sixth principle is titled *"The Breasts."* This refers to the breasts’ connection above to the fluids of the heart and lungs and below to the true essence of the Sea of Blood. When the breasts are refined to resemble those of a virgin or a young child, it signifies the female body’s transformation into that of a male.

The method does not depart from the fourth and fifth principles. Women are rooted in blood, yet the aim of this principle lies in refining the red back to white, hence the additional step of *"refining fluids into blood."* To transform fluids into blood, nothing surpasses the practice of *"dew lingering at the pass,"* where spirit is focused on the twin gates, melting the old stagnant fluids within like mud, allowing them to flow back to the sea. When they return, blood is generated and flourishes—its profound essence lies within the fifth principle.

If one seeks to refine blood back to white, nothing compares to directing intention to the breast channels, clenching the teeth tightly, and augmenting the mind with emptiness and stillness, so that qi naturally gathers in the channels and reaches the breasts. Then, using both palms, knead the breasts—first slowly, then swiftly; first lightly, then with greater pressure—performing one hundred and forty-four repetitions. The gathered qi will flourish abundantly; afterward, withdraw the intention and direct it to the two flanks. Further, guide the eyes’ spirit to rotate the qi left and right, completing seventy-two breaths, until the qi warms the area like moxibustion. Then, with intention, circulate the qi around the wheel without counting, until the lower extremity feels as if boiling. Thus, the red will transform into fresh white, which must then be refined into qi, ascending through the spine’s gates, crossing the pillow, and penetrating the valley.

When, at the appointed time, the inner vision reveals the Three Mystic Mountains and the Pure Garden—yet the scene is not yet pristine—one must immediately engage in *"forgetting forgetting,"* suddenly entering the profound darkness of night. Abiding in stillness, over time, one will naturally experience lightning flashes and thunderous roars, a downpour like cascading dew, the Flowery Pond brimming full, the throat unable to swallow it all, the fluid descending smoothly through the pass to the navel, and the entire body suffused with clarity and harmony. Remaining in stillness, observe this process. After a hundred uninterrupted days, those with firm breasts will find them as flat as a young boy’s, while those with hollow breasts will fill them like walnuts, resembling a virgin’s. Achieving the form of a young boy results from the completion of the white-refining practice; attaining the form of a virgin comes from the completion of the red-refining practice.

Our tradition has seen many verified practitioners, among whom Mistress Feng stands out for her poetic records. Her verses serve as testimony:

*"Left sun, right moon—one yin-yang,
Through the nose’s pass, the inner work is called ‘moving the Gang.’
To return yin and yang to sun and moon,
Grasp the true fire and knead the twin chambers."*

Let the seeker take heed.

[**Note:** The "twin passes" lie between the spine and the palace behind it, containing two cavities where the body’s muddy fluids lodge. The left is called *Gao*, the right *Huang*—places where medicinal power cannot reach and true qi does not naturally arrive. These muddy fluids, if left to fester, bring calamity to the entire body. Creation, in forming humans, established these passes to guard the heart, hence their name: the Twin Passes. The fluid is called "mud" because, though resembling liquid, it is not true liquid—it derives from transformed food and drink, a kind of essence. Borne by qi, it spreads through the lungs to moisten the meridians. When the body’s true qi is abundant, this substance is transformed and serves boundless purposes. If true qi declines, the substance remains untransformed, flowing into the organs and meridians without harm. But when it encounters extreme yin qi, it congeals into muddy fluid—seeming like essence yet not essence—blocking the qi pathways. The Twin Passes and the lower extreme are where it lingers most. Of these, the Twin Passes are the most pernicious, for true qi does not reach them naturally. Thus, it accumulates like the ice and snow of Kunlun’s yin peaks, enduring the three summer months without melting. Though the heart’s Gang of Earth guards and protects, when spirit is strong, all is well; when spirit weakens, danger arises. The ancients knew this and devised the method of "gathering spirit to warm the passes," though few in the world have heard of it. Among those who knew, practiced, and recorded their success in verse, only Perfected Feng stands out. Thus, her words are cited here as proof. Yet her success also relied on first cultivating an empty, still mind, holding to the single incantation. Only by emptying the mind could spirit return and qi flourish, and with the method of channeling streams and kneading chambers, the muddy fluids were melted and surged forth from the passes, flowing abundantly to be refined. This is the wondrous interplay of non-being and being!

**Further Note:** The left chamber of the breast connects to the liver, the right to the lungs; the streams connect to the heart, kidneys, and spleen. Thus, one must observe and channel them diligently. Yet in ordinary times, one need only maintain this with intention, whether conscious or not. For in women, the root of life lies in the heart, corresponding to the central line of the *Kun* hexagram, which forms *Li* and harbors true fire. Blood arises from coolness, and when blood is abundant, spirit is at peace. Thus, emptiness and stillness are essential—this is the key to curing illness, nurturing life, and returning to the origin to achieve the Dao. The *Scripture of Purity* and the *Three Observances* are most fitting for this practice.]

**Seventh Rule: Jade Fluid**
If we speak of the seventh step in the proper path of female cultivation, it is titled "Jade Fluid." In men, when practice begins with purity and the work advances to moving the river chariot, true essence is preserved and does not leak from the Mysterious Pass.

[**Xie’s Note:** "Does not leak from the Mysterious Pass" means the Yang Pass has closed, turning life’s mechanism inward. Once the Yang Pass closes, the Mysterious Pass naturally opens, and the primordial no longer transforms the postnatal. The current reverses to the crown, dew showers the Celestial Valley, and flows down to the Flowery Pond—also called Jade Fluid. Yet only when the yin spirit appears, the hun soul wanders the Jade Palace, the po soul pays homage to the Imperial Perfected, the round light crowns the head, the tides surge in the Mysterious Sea, and the echoes resound in the Jade Clarity, does the true return of the Jade Fluid elixir occur. The ancient perfected called this "nectar pouring on the crown."

**Xie’s Note:** Even in the minor return of Jade Fluid, there is the work of harmonizing spirit. Once the river chariot flows smoothly and the Yang Pass is tightly sealed, the yin spirit appears. Then, harmonizing and refining spirit to purity, one emits light to draw the primordial unity, filling the body with true yang. The heart’s brightness shines day and night, and only then can one proceed to the major return of Golden Fluid. Most in the world are unaware of this step of harmonizing spirit, nurturing, and bathing. Some mistakenly call this "emitting the yang spirit," but this is a grave error. At this stage, the primordial spirit has only just formed and returns to the Muddy Pellet. The Mysterious Sea is the sea of the brain; Jade Clarity is the realm of emptiness in the upper elixir field.]

As for women, Jade Fluid is the transformation of the Red Dragon’s liquid into the White Phoenix’s marrow. Only when this marrow is abundant can one proceed with the reverse flow, avoiding empty effort. The methods within, though not departing from the four rules already shown, must follow the subtleties of the six rules. Only thus can their use be inexhaustible—this is what the earlier worthies meant by: *"One grain returns to one grain, / Its use is never spent. / When the true seed is attained, / This work must still be pursued with force."* Yet the means to attain sufficiency lie entirely in cultivating an empty, still mind. Let the seeker take heed.

[**Note:** For this rule, we should cite the self-account of the Immortal Jade Maiden. She said: *"In my past practice of returning the elixir, I forgot the person through the method, forgot the method through the person, and acted when the time came—thus, I forgot the self for the sake of the self. From this day forward, I forgot the day, forgot the hour, until even heaven and earth vanished. Over time, I suddenly awoke as if enlightened, listening and seeing in stillness, yet utterly forgetting what the matter was. Only then did I feel scorched as if burning, and afterward, there appeared a grease like oil (after the North Star, the Red Dragon’s liquid transformed into the White Phoenix’s marrow), boundless and limitless, now sounding, now silent, now flowing, now stopping, now surging, now spraying. At times, it hung like a snow-white ribbon; at others, it settled like a clear ice lake. The times were not one time, the places not one place, yet the eyes were not dazzled, nor the spirit wearied."*]

Suddenly, amid this state, what was seen and heard became enough to delude the nature. At that moment, I still managed to caution myself: *"Do not be lured by phenomena."*

Then, I suddenly realized: *"Heaven and earth share the same body with me."* Turning inward to reflect, I saw that my own body was surely the same—if the principle held externally, it must also hold internally. Thus, it must be so within.

Thereupon, I turned my gaze inward to examine myself. I had no self; after abiding in stillness for a long while, the true "I" emerged. *(Xie’s note: "吾" refers to the conscious spirit and the self of perception; "我" refers to the primordial spirit and true intent.)* Yet when I sought to delve deeper into this inner reflection, there was no gate or aperture to be found.

Suddenly, as if awakening from a dream, I became aware that within this body—deep in its lowest depths—there burned a scorching heat like moxibustion. A sound arose like thunder, the roar of wind and tide surging from within. In an instant, it pierced the gates, ascended the spine, passed through the pillow bone, and reached the valley, flowing like sweet dew until it descended from the nose. The Flower Pool filled with water, so abundant that swallowing could not keep pace. In less than half a day, the fluid surged into the Southern Ocean, then poured into the waist and coiled around the navel, smelting and refining. Truly, heaven and earth shared one body—externally so, and now internally so as well. The truth of it was confirmed.

At that time, I simply followed the usual sequence, completing the work before withdrawing.

Such were the words of the immortal maiden, all describing the transformation of inner work. One can imagine that in her daily practice, she must have first devoted herself to emptiness and stillness, then later advanced to a state of utter forgetfulness. This account is thus recorded here to verify that such methods indeed belong to the art of inner cultivation.

**Eighth Method: Embryonic Breathing**

This is the eighth method in the proper path of female cultivation, titled *"Embryonic Breathing."* Embryonic breathing is the supreme Dao, the celestial ladder. After a woman completes the Returned Elixir, her essence and qi become abundant, her body one with that of a man—without embryonic breathing, the day of returning to emptiness will never come.

This single breath holds boundless efficacy, yet its practice is most simple. However, not all who cultivate it achieve the same result; the differences are profound. Is this not the work of Creation’s design? Yet Creation itself is shaped by the nature of things.

When one first enters stillness to seek the breath at the nose, there is no thought, no deliberation.
*(Xie’s note: "Emptiness" is not the Dao; "stillness" is not the Dao. "Emptiness" is not the Mysterious Aperture; "fullness" is not the Mysterious Aperture. These terms—emptiness and fullness, stillness and movement—serve only as means and tools to perceive the Dao and enter the Mysterious Aperture.)*

Morning and night, one persists until one day the Ancestral Aperture is touched—it opens of itself, neither sought nor rejected. Suddenly, the breath merges with the nose.
*(Xie’s note: This refers to the method of Golden Fluid. At the outset, mind and breath interdepend in the emptiness beyond the body—not the air-filled emptiness outside the flesh. When breath at the nose and heartbeat both vanish, the Outer Mysterious Pass activates spontaneously. Essence transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit returns to emptiness—all naturally, effortlessly, perpetually aware and luminous. Within the body, infinite celestial mechanisms unfold; inside and outside become one, heaven and humanity share a single qi. Hence it is called embryonic breathing, also known as the Returned Elixir.
Further note: At the outset, one begins with the Outer Elixir Field, then unites inner and outer Elixir Fields; eventually, heaven, earth, and humanity merge into primordial chaos.)*

Vast and boundless, profound and unfathomable—one no longer knows whether the Ancestor is oneself or oneself the Ancestor. A single breath through the nose: the ancients called this embryonic breathing. Within this aperture, yin and yang, the Five Phases, heaven and earth, all beings—all arise from it.

The breath responds to the mechanism as the mechanism responds, naturally giving rise to six grades of immortal kin: celestial, aquatic, terrestrial, human, spiritual, and spectral. The key lies in extreme emptiness and stillness. Those whose virtue aligns with True Unity cultivate to become Celestial Immortals; those whose virtue aligns with Mysterious Unity become Aquatic Immortals; those whose virtue aligns with Upright Unity become Terrestrial Immortals; those whose virtue aligns with Essential Unity become Human Immortals. The two lesser vehicles—those whose virtue aligns with Passionate Unity—become spirits if leaning toward yang, ghosts if leaning toward yin. Though the virtuous may attain fruition, they cannot be called true immortals. Such are the distinctions, rooted in the interplay of mechanism and response.
*(Xie’s note: Plant melons and you reap melons; plant beans and you reap beans. In cultivation, only "resolve" matters.)*

Though called a heavenly endowment, is it not self-acquired? Let the practitioner take heed.
*(Xie’s note: Responding with True Unity, one becomes a Celestial Immortal; responding with Mysterious Unity, an Aquatic Immortal... The "nose" here refers to the Outer Mysterious Aperture, the Mysterious Female of Creation. It is not the nostrils of the human body. Because one begins with breath, it is called the nose. First, "mind and breath interdepend, spirit and qi unite"; then, "spirit and breath interdepend, nature and life unite"—all transpiring within the Mysterious Aperture. Thus, a single breath through the nose unites heaven, earth, humanity, and self in one qi, one spirit, one Mysterious Aperture.)*

This humble reflection affirms: embryonic breathing is the true supreme Dao, the true celestial ladder. How could one not strive with diligence?

Sixth Precept: *Namo* – On the Ninth Path of Women’s Cultivation, titled *"Namo."*
To speak of the consummation of women’s practice, none surpasses the Great Being, who through ascetic cultivation and devoted refinement attains the realization of buddhahood and bodhisattvahood. The power of this attainment lies in the two syllables *Namo*. Within these two characters is concealed a profound mystery. Only by embodying and safeguarding the truth that this very body is Buddha—like a seven-tiered crystal stupa enshrined upon Mount Putuo—can one proceed. Before the stupa stands a red child, the leader of the discriminating mind, whom the Great Being allows to wander east and west in inquiry. After fifty-three inquiries, the inquiry culminates in seeing the Buddha, and the koan becomes perfectly clear. Then, relying on the Dragon Girl of the Southern Ocean, she offers the Pearl of Spontaneous Freedom, which is shielded by the Purple Bamboo Grove. Presently, the white parrot flits up and down; in hand, she holds the Pure Bottle, inserting a willow sprig to gather the natural nectar of sweet dew. Seated steadfast upon Mount Putuo, she employs the *Dhāraṇī* method, placing a single syllable in the realm of the truly real, securing the supreme treasure within the fish basket. Reciting *Garuḍa*, she releases all of *sahā* into the Southern Sea, where waves surge unceasingly—yet she abides in spontaneous ease, beholding the spontaneously free. This great dharma, however, cannot do without the fourth precept’s inner work, which must arise moment by moment from the preceding precept. Thus, step by step, one returns to true emptiness and true quiescence. When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, one may exchange smiles with the Great Being, serene and joyful as the liberation of the Buddha.

Let the practitioner take heed.

*(Respectfully noted: This precept is purely about transforming function and resolving the mechanism of transformation. It is to be apprehended intuitively, not expounded verbally. One must only devote oneself earnestly to *Namo*, embodying the truth that this very body is Buddha—living, vibrant, and unbound in all directions.)*

Tenth Precept of the Women’s Right Path, titled *"Vigilance at Life’s End."*
Women embody the virtue of *kun*, the Way of Earth—without achievement, yet ever completing what has begun. Thus, they ought to assist in nurturing and transforming the world beneath the bright sun of civilization. Yet the work begins with emptiness and quiescence, costing not a penny nor expending a thread of effort. It is achieved through sitting, unknown to others, yet one’s virtue parallels the workings of creation—healing the world through this very body. The practice relies entirely on regulating the mind to emptiness and quiescence: when the heart’s chamber is purified, the celestial realm attains great peace; when the *kun*-abdomen flows freely, the common folk prosper; when the four limbs circulate unimpeded, the four barbarian regions are pacified. Thus, when the body is regulated, the self is at peace; when the self is at peace, the world is governed. The resonance is immediate: a single moment of harmony yields a moment of true virtue. Though no effect is seen, the effect is inherent.

Yet one must guard against superficial learning and the failure to unify the Three Fields, for no one whose own body remains unintegrated can possess the talent to save the world.

*(Xie’s note: The Confucians say, “Cultivate the self, order the family, govern the state, bring peace to all under heaven.” How profound these words!)*

The secret lies in morning and evening devotion: if others advance by one, advance by a hundred; if others advance by ten, advance by a thousand. Though dull-witted, one will surely become enlightened.

Let the practitioner take heed.

*(Respectfully noted: This precept is the full reissue authorized by the Queen Mother of the West. The Non-Dual Primordial Sovereign, following the oral transmission of the Great Way of World-Healing from the Jade-Pure Divine Mother, compiled and amended the final precept of former transmissions to conclude the text. It is truly an unprecedented and monumental canon since the dawn of creation. Lü Dongbin called it “the greatest fortune of creation,” while the Primordial Sovereign deemed it “the timely revival of the Dao’s destiny.” Such high expectations are placed upon later learners. May all who encounter this text encourage one another.)*

*The Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation for Women’s Practice*
*Transmitted by Patriarch Li of the Mud-Pill Palace*

Master Tai Xu’s Account with Annotations, Revised by Disciple Min Yide

**First Precept**

The Master of Mud-Pill Palace states:
For women’s practice, progress begins with halting thoughts, then regulating the mind. Once thoughts are stilled and the mind harmonized, one may proceed to massage.

**The method forbids avoiding warmth to seek coolness.**
Women, whose root is blood, are by nature inclined toward yin. Yin delights in coolness, yet without the subtle activation of qi through massage, they easily sink into pure yin. Yin begets coolness, coolness congeals into ice—if not countered by movement, it breeds phlegm stagnation, blood stasis, and other ailments, obstructing progress. Thus, one must begin with halting thoughts and regulating the mind.

Women belong to *kun*, yet *kun* conceals true fire. When fire lies dormant, all is auspicious; when it flares, it scorches metal. If left unregulated and stirred, metal, pressed by fire, manifests the omen of "the bird’s cry ascending to heaven." Therefore, women’s practice must commence with halting thoughts and regulating the mind.

In halting thoughts and regulating the mind, one cannot practice too much, nor fear prolonged effort—within stillness, there is movement.

**Master Tai Xu annotates:**
When thoughts cease, qi becomes pure; when the mind is regulated, qi becomes harmonious. Continuing with massage then awakens the mechanism of yang. Yet one must guard against stagnation and restlessness. Women naturally prefer coolness and dislike heat, and upon initially achieving stillness of thought, harmony of mind, and balance of qi, they may encounter stagnation or agitation. This often sparks the desire to replenish true yin, leading to the accumulation of pure yin. For stillness congeals yin, and inactivity stifles yang—beginners invariably fall into this pitfall. Unaware of the cause of restlessness and vexation, they hastily seek temporary relief in coolness, a grave mistake! One must instead intensify practice, employing methods to circulate qi. When qi flows, agitation naturally dissolves. Those who fail to grasp this and seek results only deepen their afflictions, further inviting phlegm stagnation and blood stasis. Hence, this warning is urgent.

The purpose of continuing massage is precisely to prevent such stasis. Yet human nature favors progress and swift results, sometimes leading to overly vigorous massage. If the earthly fire blazes, all fires follow, risking the harm of scorching metal—hence the caution against "the bird’s cry ascending to heaven." *Hanyin* refers to the *you*-bird (rooster); when pressed to its limit, it flees upward. Thus, the text reemphasizes the subtlety of halting thoughts and regulating the mind.

This precept reveals the essential method for women’s practice, thorough from beginning to end.

The Second Precept

Master Niwan states: In women’s refined practice, one begins with the flourishing of yang and concludes with the restraint of yin—this method is most profound, yet few comprehend it. The deluded follow the male path in their cultivation, while the wise turn to Chan Buddhism, each able to verify a certain fruition, achieving effects such as vanishing while standing or transforming while seated. Yet they remain mired in ghostly realms, far from the Dao.

For women, blood is the foundation: when blood is abundant, essence overflows; when the heart is cool, blood is generated. As the ancients said, the refinement of fluid into blood and the transformation of blood into essence depend on a clear spirit. Without the transformation of fluid, fluid loses the warming of spirit, congeals into phlegm, flows into the spleen and stomach, steams upward to the lungs, scatters through the meridians, and gives rise to a hundred diseases. The five viscera suffer calamity, the six bowels encounter misfortune. Thus, ancient elixir methods always begin by stilling the heart. When the heart is stilled and breathing settled, the spirit becomes clear, and the heart cools.

One must wait until the heart is cool and fluid surges, then direct attention to the breast channels, applying rotating massage with the hands to ensure the qi mechanism overflows. Next, raise both hands to rotate around the breasts, waiting until this misty vapor envelops them, feeling the warmth suffuse from behind, the twin passes alight with smoky flame. The momentum presses through the passes, filling them with muddy fluid, which flows into the breast channels like a gushing spring.

Then, with true intent, guide it into the Southern Ocean, silently guarding it for approximately thirty-six breaths. Release the intent slightly, sensing within a spontaneous descent, dividing to flow into both flanks, spiraling left and right, each for thirty-six breaths of spirit. Then, with unified intent, gather it deep within the navel wheel, slowly rotating forty-nine times, swiftly rotating forty-nine times. Observe the coccyx: if the warmth penetrates from behind, and the momentum seems sluggish, employ the method of contracting the two excretory orifices to naturally ascend through the tailbone, up the spine, over Kunlun, and descend into Niwan. Feeling Niwan vast as the sea, one may pause to nurture it. Then, descending into the Crimson Palace and the Flowery Pond, the great earth’s Jambudvīpa is drenched with dewdrops, all tasks forgotten. One feels only a vague indistinctness, breathing without conscious breath, swallowing without conscious swallow, lifting without conscious lift—within, the flavor is sweet and fragrant, qi and spirit harmoniously full, the three fields unified.

Then, as mysterious conditions pervade, swiftly turn inward, releasing all entanglements. Gradually, the body feels hollow as a valley, the great earth vanishes, and a subtle coolness subtly assails one, misty vapor filling all. Suddenly, clouds disperse and fog clears, revealing the Sea of Nature below, its azure waves limpid. I remain unmoved by a single thought, forgetting both state and emotion. Suddenly, myriad golden rays appear, fine rain like pearls descending with the light, spiraling left and right, transforming into a luminous moon floating in a crystalline sea. Abruptly, one awakens as from a dream.

Master Niwan states: At this moment, swiftly introspect this body. At this time, one should feel qi refreshed, spirit clear, and the entire body harmonious—this is attainment. Attainment means the whole body remains luminously concentrated for a while, with intent directed to the feminine gate, sensing within a profound tranquility—this is it.

Then, rub the hands and face, circulate spirit around the abdomen, raise the windlass on both sides, each for forty-nine breaths. Gently twist the waist, sway the knees and legs, sit and tap the toes, each for twenty-four breaths, then stop. Practicing this for a hundred days, three times daily without interruption, the foundation for celestial immortality is established.

Master Taixu states: This precept is a general outline, anciently called the Ladder to Heaven. The great Dao’s elixir method lies herein, lacking only the final crucial step. Later scholars must first become thoroughly familiar with it, embodying each word, silently contemplating it hundreds of times daily. Then, when practicing, it will be like entering a familiar path, not led astray by phenomena. Even if manifestations slightly differ, the sequence remains orderly. Scholars must not treat this as a *Journey to the West* to be read and set aside.

For men’s elixir texts abound like cattle hairs, but women’s elixir texts are rarely complete in the world. To obtain the *Eighteen Direct Pointers of Golden Flower* is already to possess an untransmitted secret. With this guide to cross-reference, the secret method for female celestial immortality is complete. If one only obtains the *Direct Pointers*, one may attain earthly or human immortality at best.

---

The Third Precept

Master Niwan states: In dual cultivation, men do not require a vessel; those who use one will never attain the Dao. Adding oil is a minor technique, not the true method. The true method unites the Three Powers in one body. Women’s dual cultivation is fundamentally the same: without containing the Three, the elixir is nurtured to completion. Within, the true One is like granary millet—creation is the furnace, ready to be consumed at will.

He further states: Know that in the world there are Unobstructed Assemblies; seeds originally pervade the great thousandfold world. Using an altar as furnace and vessel, after Lu’s departure, the true transmission was lost.

He further states: In speaking this gatha, the Eight Divisions of Devas and Nāgas will surely be astonished, deeming me garrulous and fearing divine punishment. Yet I speak freely because I received the august decree of the Jade Purity Divine Mother, who lamented the Dao’s near extinction and commanded the Peerless Holy Maiden to solemnly proclaim it, orally transmitting it to me with the intent to reveal it directly, no longer concealing it under false names to further mislead later generations.

Her teaching states: Solitary cultivation is not the supreme Dao; those of the same kind naturally rely on one another. Those who possess a body beyond the body can forget form and serve all things.

Her method states:
*"Qian’s origin is attained from the crown,
Kun’s origin is lost from the feminine gate.
The human origin pervades the great stem,
The Three Origins are mastered by one heart.
Not beyond the heart’s stillness and emptiness,
Not beyond the body’s lack of obstruction.
Movement and stillness unite with true constancy;
I have no origin, yet it naturally merges.
When origin merges, the One also merges,
The One Origin is emotion and nature.
Emotion is nature’s origin,
Nature is endowed with talent.
Able to transform without origin or One,
One naturally transcends the supreme rank."*

This is the august decree of the Jade Purity Divine Mother and the oral transmission of the Peerless Holy Maiden. Those who can, follow it.

[Master Taixu states: The mutual necessity of like kinds is the principle of the Supreme Ultimate—this is precisely what is called the wondrous union and coagulation of the dual essences of the Two and the Five. Within and beyond *Awakening to Reality* lies the entirety of the *Triple Concordance*; what it speaks of is this single principle. Yet世人 have misunderstood it, giving rise to the defiled practices of the "Three Peaks." Now, having received the Master’s instruction, the oral transmission of a thousand years is at last made clear. How fortunate am I, Bing, to have received it. (Bing is the lineage name of Master Taixu.) How fortunate the world is to have it illuminated—this is the culminating great stratagem of the dual traditions of male and female cultivation. Yet unless one possesses the power of wisdom, few can bring it to completion.

I, Bing, have tasted the essence of the tradition: the method lies solely in the absence of self, which alone can lead to the absence of things. When both self and things are forgotten, the True One appears. Once the True One has appeared, follow the One in its upholding. The One naturally dissolves into itself, transforming and generating endlessly, without limit. Within this imperial Dao, nothing surpasses the Unobstructed Buddha Assembly. The alchemical texts speak of "living dragons and tigers filling empty space." I, Bing, have witnessed this in such an assembly. However, one must adhere strictly to the ancient regulations to avoid disgrace or regret.

Regarding this assembly, its meaning is most profound yet its manifestation most evident—take care not to misunderstand. What is called "profound" lies hidden in the heart, where gains and losses are known to none but oneself. What is called "evident" is as open as a marketplace, where every movement and stillness is revealed without the slightest concealment. Only by thus observing the method can one avoid the world’s censure.

Alas! The sage’s heart is burdened with sorrow; the sage’s vision extends far indeed!]

Fourth Section.

Nīwán Shì states: Indeed, the ancient sages have said: If the gross substance is not transformed, the Dao remains ever distant; if merit and conduct are not perfected, fruition will never come. To advance by skipping stages is but to court delusion; to attain realization without perfection is to gain only a lesser, inferior fruit. Let the learner heed this compassionate instruction: one must first temper the Dharma-body to firmness, for this provides the foundation for refinement. Without this foundation, one cannot speak of the higher principles.

The higher principles concern purely the work of transformation, yet each step arises from the physical form—this is the art of lodging the empty within the solid and, through the solid, attaining the empty. Such is the method of the Heavenly Immortal.

[Taixū Shì comments: The Dharma-body is the body beyond the body. This body is not obtained through visualization, nor can it be accomplished by alchemical refinement. Its secret lies in "borrowing the false to cultivate the real," and its practice does not extend beyond the physical form. The key is to refine this physical body until, within and without, it is pure and stainless—where "body" is no-body, and no-body is body. This is what is meant by: when the work is active, the body vanishes; when the work ceases, the body appears. In that state of vanishing, all sensations of cold and warmth are not the self; all sensations of pain and itch are not the self—this is what is called "awareness without attachment."

How is this achieved? The method lies in dwelling in emptiness with the spirit, so that the body is no longer the body. One who can recognize the True One, beyond which all is illusion, has further mastered it. Refining thus until there is no far or near, no inside or outside, one advances further. Cultivating further to the point of no going or coming, no entering or exiting, one truly attains the state of no far or near, no inside or outside. Refining still further to the point of no arising or ceasing, no movement or stillness, one truly reaches the state of no coming or exiting. In this way, the pure realm of the Dharma-body is fully realized. Yet all this is sought nowhere but within the physical body.]

Fifth Principle

Nīwán Shì says: The words of Zhēnyáng are true. (Zhēnyáng is the sobriquet bestowed upon Taixū Shì by Nīwán Shì.) Through such diligent cultivation, the Dharma-body naturally manifests; through such unwavering practice, a body exists beyond the body. You must understand: the ancient sages relied upon the final, great expedient to complete the Dao—this is the swiftest path to its attainment!

For the true yin and true yang within the body are limited; refining them involves nothing more than mutual tempering of the prior and posterior. Though daily cultivation yields gradual accumulation, the acquired impurities of the postnatal body also grow day by day. Even with diligent practice, those who encounter great calamities are many across the ages—how pitiable! There is no other reason: the innate endowment of true essence is measurable, while the accrued falsity of the postnatal is boundless. Moreover, if one does not begin cultivation in youthful purity, the stains of corruption are inescapable. In this, you may well fear for the world!

[Taixū Shì says: Whether drinking water or broth, one knows its warmth or coolness. If the Dharma-body is already formed, the methods of regulation and protection, the proper timing of gathering and releasing, need not be sought elsewhere—for inner verification is sufficient. Even if the Dharma-body is not yet formed, the methods of regulation and protection, the timing of releasing and gathering, are still to be sought within the body’s own fluctuations—nothing more than blockage and flow, ascent and descent, cold and warmth, dryness and moisture.

In applying these principles, how could they extend beyond unblocking what is blocked, warming what is cold, moistening what is dry, and circulating these transformations within? The great aim is single-mindedness and softness, not being led astray by external things, harmonizing the foundation of heart and qi, unifying the movement of qi, and recognizing this body as a borrowed vessel. All practices—massage, contraction, visualization, and frequent circulation—serve only to enliven the qi’s movement.

Once the qi’s mechanism is lively and free, the method rests solely on single-minded softness: when thoughts arise, dissolve them; when gathering, know when to rest. Beware of "riding the ox to seek the ox," of gathering without cessation—this is called "adding a head atop the head." Even when signs such as unobstructed flow, ascent and descent, warmth, coolness, and balance are achieved, avoid clinging—just as gathering must know when to rest.

Cultivating and nurturing in accordance with this, one will never face the peril of collapse. Such is my observation.]

**Sixth Principle**

Master Niwan states: Indeed, your words are correct. The woman’s spirit takes flight, the man’s essence congeals—both stem from the error of "adding a head atop the head." For the spirit clings to essence: when spirit congeals and essence is balanced, all is at peace; when essence is exhausted and spirit left solitary, it flees. The unknowing mistakenly call this "transformation," a grievous pity.

From this, one may discern the folly of excessive massage and visualization. Why is this so? The woman is inwardly yin yet outwardly yang, her trigrammatic nature belonging to *Li*; her true yin leaks away with the monthly tide. Thus, stillness triumphing over motion brings fortune, while motion triumphing over stillness invites misfortune. The man’s root lies in essence, the woman’s in blood; essence thrives with warmth, blood flourishes with coolness. Know this, and you know how to nurture.

Yet the woman’s practice does not abandon massage and visualization, for it serves two purposes: first, to free the movement of qi, ensuring the meridians flow unimpeded; second, to refine the body’s fluids, preventing stagnation from congealing into phlegm, so that fluids may transform into blood.

The ancient sages spoke of stillness and preservation as the foundation, which also holds two meanings: when ruler and ministers are at peace, the spirit remains clear and does not flee; moreover, stillness gives rise to wisdom, shielding the life-force from desire’s disturbances. This is the secret of dual cultivation within the self.

Once the qi’s mechanism is free and the will pure and tranquil, augment it with harmony, follow with integrity and purity. Though daily progress may seem slight, monthly gains accumulate. Persist in this practice, and one day you will realize a body equal to empty space, the Three Fields unified as one. You will perceive only luminous radiance in every limb, joint, and aperture. At this stage of cultivation, the self and the body beyond the self are both attained.

If you persist without retreat, spirit and qi will be full, thoughts will not stray outward, the spirit will not chase after thoughts, blood will flourish abundantly, true yin will be sufficient, and qi and essence will naturally expand to fill heaven and earth. Yet if thoughts soar and scatter, you will fall into the Two Vehicles—what the alchemical texts call "the yin spirit departing the husk." The practitioner must guard against this.

---

Master Taixu comments: I have heard from the Master that the spirit is the heart’s spirit; when it remains and does not flee, it is because it clings to essence. Once essence dries up, the spirit takes flight. Essence here refers to kidney essence; when essence does not congeal, it is governed by the spirit. Yet this congealed essence is not primordial essence—it is merely a fluid, akin to the body before its formation. Once the true spirit departs, this essence hardens.

The *Book of Changes* states: "The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao." A verse says: "Half a catty and eight taels make the true." And again: "Solitary yin does not generate, lone yang does not grow." *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*, *Zhen* and *Xun*, *Dui* and *Gen*—heaven and earth, sun and moon, nature and life, male and female—all follow the ceaseless cycle of yin and yang, which is the constant Dao. If cultivation leans toward one vehicle or perception tilts to one side, it becomes a flawed path.

It is further said: In the beginning of practice, one seeks union within the body, yet there is always a sequence—first the true, then the false. Though the false arises from the true, the true may also be called false; when the false returns to the true, it is then called primordial. If the gathering misses its time or clings to form, it strays onto side paths, becoming mere illusion—though still salvageable. The gravest danger lies in the moment when, after solitary cultivation reaches fulfillment, perception enters the profound void, and a single bias in thought leads to a corresponding bias in attainment. Though one may seek to halt it, it is already too late. The woman’s spirit flies, the man’s essence congeals—how can one not be cautious!

Alas! Know that Master Cui’s *Mirror for Taking the Medicine* says: "It is nature and life, not spirit and qi." To speak of spirit and essence is like offering yellow leaves to stop a child’s crying. Without recognizing true gold, how can one distinguish yellow leaves?

Master Zhong said: "The four great elements of the body are all yin; what, then, is yang essence?" Only when one meets a enlightened teacher’s guidance does the Daoist immortal’s work become the cultivation of the body. He also said: "The intermingling of being and non-being is the root of the elixir; the mutual support of the hidden and manifest is the water and metal. Do not cling to this body as the Dao, for solitary cultivation without substance is but solitary yin."

Combining these teachings with the Master’s instructions, there must be what is called the "true seed." Yet if it is not sought outside this body, its meaning is profoundly subtle.

**Seventh Principle**

Master Niwan states: Indeed.

**Seventh Principle**

Master Niwan states: Indeed.

The *Daode Jing* says: "There is a thing, formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and does not change, circulates without cease, and may be called the mother of all under heaven. I know not its name; forced to designate it, I call it the Dao." It also says: "Vague and elusive, yet within it there is form; dim and obscure, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is most real, and within it there is truth."

This one thing is enclosed within the mountain of form. The ancients said: "Seek it not within the body, nor gather it outside the body." Vague and elusive, it seems to dwell in the void and obscurity between being and non-being, yet it does not lie beyond the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass. This aperture—vast without boundary, minute without interior—cannot be grasped by thought nor opened by effort. The method lies only in making the body equal to emptiness, releasing all conditions, forgetting even emptiness, forgetting even stillness. Then the spirit naturally enters the mark, and qi naturally emerges from within. When the qi-body becomes misty and boundless, without head or tail, this is the manifestation of that thing, the first sign of the body beyond the body.

If this aperture does not open, even if one severs the dragon and transforms the spirit, it remains but the illusory existence of yellow leaves—how can it be called "conceiving the embryo" or "entering the gate"? What was shown before is still but yellow leaves, not true gold.

Master Taixu states: Massage, though delusive, cannot be abandoned lest the qi-mechanism stagnate; visualization, though false, cannot be discarded lest qi and essence falter. Advancing further, one cultivates until there is something yet nothing, yet the teacher’s intent still does not deem this ultimate—because it remains but this-side’s affair! Nevertheless, when this-side’s affair is complete, the far shore is easily reached; if the far shore is not reached, the mechanism is blocked by layered mountains. When it is reached, guide it with mindfulness—effortlessly, abundantly, and the four neighbors will arrive of themselves. Thus, though separated by mountains and lakes, the qi-mechanism’s communion is as if face-to-face.

What is the method? As the teacher said: "Emit light to draw it, concentrate the mind to await it." If it ascends while you descend, or retreats while you advance, the meeting is futile. The method lies only in stillness amid motion, empty and receptive. When the qi-mechanism arrives, sense its harmonious ease, yet remain still and unmoving. Envelop it with intention, store it deep within for inner refinement, proceeding from *kun* to *gen*, riding the raft into the Milky Way. Perceive golden lightning flashing, cool qi filling the void, like clouds or mist swirling within and without. At this moment, guard against杂念—whether admiration or doubt—dismiss thoughts as they arise. Sense a kind of qi-mechanism, effortlessly filling the center, without inside or outside, without boundary. In an instant, myriad transformations appear, impossible to count, depict, or describe. Yet there are also times of stillness without radiance, pitch-black as night. These are all called "mysterious reflections," also named "round images of the far shore." In truth, they are the perfect interpenetration of self and other—what is called the three realms of the *Huayan*, *Śūraṅgama*, and *Lotus Sutra*, the wondrous scenes of Three Mountains and Ten Isles. In reality, they are the qi-mechanism of transformative craft between self and other, the far shore yet not the far shore. Yet the attainment of the far shore does not lie beyond this.

The teacher said: "I once inquired of the Pure and Tranquil Primordial Sovereign, who replied, 'So it is, so it is.' And further: 'Why should the work of men be different?'"

**Eighth Principle**

Master Niwan states: The verse says: "Turning and overturning, the affairs of heaven and earth; the two qi conjoin in essence to form *gen*-metal." It also says: "The hawk seizes the sparrow, the falcon strikes the winter crow—subtle within the subtle, wondrous within the wondrous." Yet this does not lie beyond "knowing the white and guarding the black, knowing the male and guarding the female"—how could it lie beyond "preserving non-being and guarding being"?

Master Taixu states: The *Daode Jing* and *Nanhua* are not texts a woman can recite daily; the *Qingjing Jing* should be read until familiar, revered within. Perhaps only the *Kun Ning* and *Zhen Yi* sutras! For without thoroughgoing nature, life cannot be preserved; without strict discipline, merit cannot be firm. The verse the teacher cited is profoundly abstruse—how could it be easily fathomed? Even after receiving the highest teachings, how many women truly understand? They remain adrift in longing—such is common under heaven. It contains the entire *Fire Record* within.

Study the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Convergence*, ponder the *Dragon-Tiger*, *Triple Unification*, and *Awakening to Reality*—only then can one speak of this principle. I shall briefly indicate the outline:

Turning and overturning,
its affairs are cyclical.
Recognize the one within the one,
and the one ever precedes.
All comes down to the two qi,
their essence conjoined in myriad forms.
When the body is without one, it appears,
able to embrace the great thousand.
The great thousand’s radiance gleams,
gleaming is the other’s origin.
If not led astray by the other’s origin,
the origin’s origin is my origin.
Origin upon origin, not one by one,
each one lacks wholeness.
Still and unrelenting,
is the work truly ordinary?
Sparrows and swallows follow their nature,
crows endure the cold.
When not hungry, they do not come;
when the time comes, they feast at will.
This is wondrous within the wondrous,
mystery within mystery.
Knowing the white, thus guard the black,
and the great whole is attained.
How does it achieve this?
The utmost non-ultimate contains all.
The teacher’s profound meaning is thus—
yet being and non-being generate each other,
grasping and relinquishing must follow the one.
Without transforming the colored body, nothing is accomplished.

**Ninth Principle**

Master Niwan states: Well said! There are teachings that say: To transcend the mundane, first purify mundane thoughts, then empty the three realms. Yet do not transgress inner principles, nor flatter ghosts and spirits. Be filial, respectful, compassionate, and kind, without defying the Master. Be gentle, yielding, upright, and steadfast, without violating the *kun*-Way.

When in motion, follow principle; when at rest, release all attachments.
The wondrous Dao is lodged in holding the dustpan and broom,
the firing times are realized in tending the hearth and cooking.
The *Ode* says:
*"Gentle and graceful,
like mountains, like rivers.
If this child is unworthy,
what can be said?"*
Such is its admonition—how profound!

**Master Taixu states:** This principle of the Master is most subtle. Those in the world who take refuge in the Dao or in the Buddha seldom follow inner principles, rarely grasp the nature of the school. Though they may be gentle and yielding in serving their teachers and elders, they often harbor resentment and defy ethical norms. Their disciples and masters alike are scorned by the teachings of proper conduct, and they will cast themselves into the iron-ringed Avīci hell—is this not lamentable?

**A Note by Min Yide:** My master, the Venerable Taixu, received the supreme Great Dao from our lineage ancestor, Master Niwan, in nearly its entirety, as further evidenced in this text. Yet this central transmission is not merely a precious raft for the Women’s School—those in the Men’s School who have penetrated its secrets in midnight meditation are likewise numerous.

The original text, having been copied and recopied through generations, contains many errors, which I have carefully corrected and emended. It is regrettable that *The Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation for the Men’s School* was taken away by the Yuan family of Changshan. I await its recovery, for it should not be lost. Within the texts of the Men’s School, traces of *The Precious Secrets of the Women’s School* also appear, though its transcribed copies suffer from many omissions. If these could be obtained, corrected, and printed together, they would form a complete work, and the two schools could be mutually referenced—no small contribution to the salvation of the world.

I record this to inform those gentlemen who possess the texts of the Men’s School: to destroy or discard sacred writings is to invite karmic retribution, as attested in the scriptures. Can one not be warned?

*Essentials of Women’s Alchemy*

Jiyi Zi of Jinxī, Fu Jinquan, has compiled this collection.

The Patriarch Lü’s *Lyrics on Ascending the Toad Palace* states:
The Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui divide at midnight and noon,
One must recognize one’s own ancestral lineage.
The thunder shakes the earth, rain falls upon the mountain peak,
Washing and nurturing the yellow sprout that emerges from Kun’s soil.
Seize the golden essence and firmly secure it,
Refining geng and jia to give birth to dragon and tiger.
When he asks who transmitted this to you,
Simply say, “The master’s surname is Lü.”

The *Three Mandates of the Sacred Mirror of Superior Medicines* states:
The subtlety of life is beyond words!
Within it, the workings shift in myriad transformations.
The human navel is called the “Gate of Life,”
Within it lies the Yellow Court, behind it the Dark Palace,
Above it the Mysterious Origin, below it the Sea of Qi,
To the left the sun, to the right the moon—all radiant.
The radiance of life also manifests in three forms:
The yellow radiance is the Cinnabar Field,
The white is the Womb Origin,
The purple is the Blood Origin.
The Blood Origin refers to the breasts,
Located one *cun* and two *fen* within, not the two breasts.
A man’s life resides in the Cinnabar Field,
The Cinnabar Field being the true soil that generates the elixir.
A woman’s life resides in the breasts,
The breasts being the essence of the mother’s qi, the wood spirit.
The Womb Origin forms the embryo,
The Blood Origin generates blood,
The Cinnabar Field produces the elixir.
The practice is conducted at the hours of zi and wu,
Focusing the mind to observe the hollow cavity within the breasts,
Breathing softly and continuously, exhaling less and inhaling more.
When the monthly signal arrives, guide it upward from the Cinnabar Field to the breasts.
The “monthly signal” does not refer to the arrival of menstruation.
The word “signal” is like a message arriving before a traveler returns home.
On the day the signal arrives, she will know it herself—
Perhaps with aching waist and legs, discomfort in the head and eyes, or loss of appetite.
This is the signal’s arrival, as blood is formed, which is qi.
One must concentrate and apply effort two and a half days prior.
If menstruation begins, the Red Dragon’s yin essence cannot be controlled;
Reckless circulation and misguided practice may harm many.
One must wait two and a half days after menstruation ends,
Testing with white silk—when its color turns golden, it is the sign that menstruation has ceased.
Then, following the previous method, guide it upward to sever it.
After several months, the menses will turn yellow,
The yellow will turn white,
And the white will vanish entirely.
Behold, this is the Dao of returning from existence to non-existence.
For women, blood serves as the kidneys, which are hollow cavities.
After forty-nine years, the waist dries, blood dries up, and vitality is lost.
Yet with prolonged nurturing, the Blood Origin revives like that of a maiden—
This is the marvel of generating existence from non-existence.
When one sees its presence, a single severing transforms it, and life is reborn.
At this stage, the work of cultivating life and nature becomes the same as for men.
Within the navel, wind arises, thunder rumbles, lightning flashes—
The transformation of the wood spirit.
Clouds gather, mists shift, flowers smile, birds take flight—
The generation of the earth spirit.
Who can fathom its wonders?

The Lazy Daoist says:
Why does a woman’s life have three aspects? They are the upper, middle, and lower.
The upper is the Yang Cavity,
The middle is the Yellow Chamber,
The lower is the Cinnabar Field.
In youth, one begins with the upper;
In decline, with the middle;
Only upon completion does one proceed with the lower.
Moreover, women are internally yang and externally yin;
First, one must sever the Red Dragon to preserve the body’s integrity,
Thus transforming Kan into Qian.
Then, employing the man’s method,
After a year of practice, the golden elixir will reside within—such is the principle.

The *Method of Cultivating the Great Yin* states:
The method of cultivating the Great Yin’s form
Largely resembles that of cultivating the Great Yang’s form, with minor differences.
At the outset, close the eyes and abide in spirit, resting deeply for a time,
Calming the heart and regulating the breath before concentrating the spirit into the qi cavity
(Located between the breasts, above the heart’s hollow).
Cross the hands to cradle the breasts,
Gently massaging them three hundred and sixty times.
Then, lightly draw the qi upward from the lower Cinnabar Field twenty-four times,
Still cradling the breasts, return to observe and regulate the breath.
With prolonged practice, true breathing will naturally ebb and flow,
Opening and closing, nurturing the barrier until spirit and qi are abundant,
True yang flourishes on its own,
The menstrual flow ceases,
And the breasts shrink like those of a man—this is called severing the Red Dragon.
After sustained practice,
There is no need to cradle the breasts or draw qi;
Simply concentrate the spirit within the qi cavity,
Returning the light to illuminate it—this is the Gate of the Mysterious Female.
True breathing becomes serene,
Utterly still and profoundly tranquil,
Yang qi steams and ascends, the river chariot reverses its course,
A myriad purple clouds gather at the Jade Palace,
A thousand white channels plant seeds in the Muddy Pellet.
One senses a single point of numinous light,
Neither inside nor outside,
Rising from the lower field to the Crimson Palace and Muddy Pellet,
Descending the heavy tower to return to the golden womb’s divine chamber.
After ten months of practice, the yang spirit manifests—
No different from the initial work of men.

The *Mysterious Subtleties of the Primordial* states:
Before a woman is born, at the moment of her parents’ union,
The father’s essence arrives first, the mother’s blood later,
Blood envelops essence to form the female body.
At the moment of a woman’s conception,
She first receives one *liang* of the mother’s lead qi,
Which first generates the right kidney,
Drawing a thread upward to form the two eyes,
And another thread downward to form the golden elixir.
From then on, every twelve days, one *zhu* of gui water is generated,
Every one hundred eighty days, one *liang* of gui water is generated.
Thereafter, every fifteen days, one *zhu* of gui water is generated,
Every year, one *liang* of gui water is generated,
Until at fourteen years, fourteen *liang* of gui water is generated in the Sea of Blood,
Combined with the two *liang* carried from the womb,
Completing the full measure of one *jin*.
Three hundred eighty-four *zhu*,
Corresponding to the three hundred eighty-four degrees of the celestial cycle,
Three hundred eighty-four days in a year,
Three hundred eighty-four lines in the *Book of Changes*—
The numbers of heaven and earth.
When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born;
When gui is exhausted, lead appears.
Thus, at fourteen, the celestial gui descends.
After the celestial gui descends at fourteen,
Over twenty-six months and seven and a half days,
One *liang* of gui water is depleted,
By forty-nine years, it is entirely exhausted.

Within lies a secret formula, difficult to express in full.

*Questions on the Difficulties of Cultivating the Real* asks: How do the starting points differ for men and women?

The answer: For men, the starting point lies in refining *qi* as the essential practice; for women, it lies in refining the form as the essential practice. Refining *qi* means to subdue one’s *qi*; subduing *qi* requires that the *qi* return, so that emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness becomes profound, root and origin reunite, and the White Tiger descends. Refining the form means to conceal one’s form; concealing the form requires that the form be extinguished. When the form is extinguished, the Four Great Elements enter emptiness, the limbs rot away, and the Red Channel is severed.

When the White Tiger descends in men, they revert to a youthful body, and the post-heaven essence no longer leaks. Thus, they may form the elixir and prolong life. When the Red Channel is severed in women, they transform into a male body, and the impure yin blood no longer flows downward. Thus, they may transcend death and enter life. Therefore, men’s cultivation is called *Taiyang Refining Qi*, while women’s cultivation is called *Taiyin Refining Form*.

Another question: Do women refining form not subdue *qi*?

The answer: Women’s nature is yin, so their *qi* is easily subdued, but the Red Channel is most harmful to the Dao. What matters most lies here. Thus, one begins by applying effort where it is most needed. Once the Red Channel is severed, the *qi* naturally becomes docile—not like men, whose nature is yang and whose *qi* is difficult to subdue. For example, if subduing *qi* takes a man three years, a woman may accomplish it in one.

If a woman of true fortitude obtains her teacher’s oral instructions and practices the *Taiyin Refining Form* method, she may attain the Dao in three to five years, with less effort than a man. Yet such women of fortitude are most rare. Only those whose resolve exceeds a man’s by a hundredfold can succeed. Those equal in strength to men cannot possibly do so!

Another question: The Great Dao makes no distinction between men and women—why then are there differences?

The answer: The Dao is the same, but its application differs. Since their natures and forms are not alike, though the Dao of life and destiny is one, the methods of practice differ greatly.

Question: How is the Red Channel severed?

Answer: The Red Channel arises from post-heaven yin *qi*; when yin *qi* stirs, impure blood flows. To transform the blood, first forge the *qi*. When the *qi* is transformed, the blood returns upward into the breasts. Red turns to white and circulates throughout the body, freeing one from the affliction of raging desire-fire. When desire-fire is extinguished, true fire emerges. From this point onward, stability and smooth progress ensure that preserving life and perfecting form are no longer difficult.

*Collected Explanations of the Female Elixir*
Edited by the Buddha of Immeasurable Kalpas

The Elder of Yuexi in Guangdong recounted the words of the Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor:

*The Book of Changes* states: "Qian is the father, Kun the mother," making the meaning of yin and yang abundantly clear. Only with heaven and earth do male and female come to be, so the Dao of yin and yang is self-evident. Thus, it is manifest that just as heaven and earth cannot be without male and female, so too must they exist. The male receives the transformations of Qian and Kun to complete his form, while the female inherits the harmonious union of Qian and Kun to possess her body. All who bear these forms and images possess the *qi* of Qian and Kun, standing together within the cosmos.

Now, in this era of compassionate ferrying and shared salvation, when the precious raft is universally poled, why should men alone be taught through manifold methods while the feminine principle is neglected? Guidance on the profound essence and wondrous subtleties of the male abounds like books filling a house to the rafters, yet methods and models for the deliverance of women remain pitifully few! With deep sorrow, I take up this topic alone. In this collection, though the words are vast, there is little systematic discourse—here, I distill their wonders into restraint.

The female body belongs to the yin image, but where then does yang return? The body is yin, while *qi* is yang. If *qi* is likened to form, yin and yang become indescribable; if *qi* is spoken of in terms of blood, yin and yang find their place. Blood is originally sweat, yet without *qi*, blood does not move. *Qi* contains *qi*, and thus the clear and turbid are distinguished. Blood is yin, yet without the yang *qi* stored within yin, *qi* does not flow. Having distinguished thus far, I must now shatter the truth in one breath:

The *Qi* Sea belongs to yang, containing yin within; the Blood Sea belongs to yin, harboring yang within. Between these cavities lies a dividing membrane, through which the twelve double-hours flow without cease. *(The Qi Sea and Blood Sea lie beneath the navel, separated by a membrane one cun and three fen apart.)* When yang reaches its peak, yin grows; when yin reaches its peak, yang is born. The two revolve and intersect, and after thirty such cycles, the monthly signal stirs of itself. What intersects is yin and yang, yet in truth, it is *qi* that effects their union.

This cavity, though one, divides into two. When the signal halts, *qi* surges; when the signal appears, *qi* leaks. Thus, when the monthly signal stirs, practice must cease. If *qi* leaks while practice continues, turbid *qi* will rush into the Mysterious Pass—how can this not be guarded against?

The male body channels *qi* from essence into the Mysterious Pass, while the female body steeps the Mysterious Pass in *qi* from blood. When the Mysterious Pass is full, the Lotus Cavity is full; when the Lotus Cavity is full, the drawing and replenishing begin to move. Only then does the descent of sweet dew arise. *(The above text is incomplete.)* Yet they do not know that the *qi* in a man’s essence is abundant, while the *qi* in a woman’s blood is faint—hence the names: man as yang, woman as yin.

Those who cultivate our Dao take severing the seven emotions as fundamental and cutting off the six desires as primary. Then, the faintest *qi* in women surpasses that of superior men. Why? A man’s heart is easily stirred, while a woman’s thoughts are somewhat still. Stirring leads to easy leakage of *qi*; stillness leads to easy growth of *qi*. One grows easily, the other leaks easily—how vast the discrepancy, like the distance of a thousand *li*!

A man’s seven lotuses are easy to gather but hard to release; a woman’s seven lotuses are easy to release and easy to gather. If she can remain unwavering in true sincerity, without waiting three to five years, sweet dew will descend constantly, and the seven lotuses will bloom perpetually. If blooming is easy, how could gathering be difficult? The distinction between male and female is thus made clear.

As for the words in this collection—speaking of emptiness, void, mystery, subtlety, spirit, and transformation—these are the great commonalities of men and women. Let me further clarify and distinguish their truth.

Why, then, is it called "embryo" for men but only "breath" for women, never "embryo"? Lest later generations misconstrue the term "embryo" and ultimately suffer false accusations! Alas! A woman’s breath, if not congealed, remains so; once congealed, it seals and solidifies; congealed again, it guards itself; congealed a third time, it roots firmly. Strengthening these three, her lotuses become easy to release and easy to gather. Can the chaste and resolute woman not hasten to awaken to this wonder?

Further, in discussing the Dao, a woman’s *qi* and breath are originally soft in nature; what is not soft arises from later harms. Those aspiring to transcend the dust must only guard against one word: rigidity. Always embrace one word: softness. If she constantly embodies gentle warmth without cease, then emptiness, subtlety, void, and mystery—all are stored within the word "softness," encompassing the myriad things.

Moreover, when a man’s spirit departs, his true nature must be utterly pure and yang before the opportunity for shedding the husk arises, for yang contains yin. When a woman’s spirit departs, her true nature differs from a man’s. Why? When a woman reaches the stage of the Three Yangs, she may transcend a hundred *li*; when she attains the union of the two purest and oldest yangs, once departed, she departs forever, without risk of premature demise. For a man, yang contains yin, with yin within and yang without; for a woman, yin contains yang, with yin without and yang within. When yang prevails, all yin readily retreats.

I now spare no truth, revealing it here, solely in the earnest hope that those who swiftly attain the real may multiply.

The Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor inscribed: Can you now know the true elixir of women? What I have distinguished is most certainly so—compared to other

Where there is method and where there is none, it is ever plainly revealed. Where there is thought and where there is none, it must yet be carefully discussed. Too much adherence—what fault is this? Too much attachment—what transgression is that? All stems from the worldly, mingled with what comes before and after. The "after" is the six desires; the "before" is the numinous origin. When before and after are used together, the numinous *qi* does not turn. The *qi* of prior Heaven is but a single thread. The three barriers and nine apertures—each aperture is thus. Once the later arises and mingles, the mysterious pass is blocked. The *qi* of prior Heaven is obstructed, and the nine apertures are unsettled. After a single sitting, joint by joint, bitterness ensues. The whole body stiffens, *qi* fails to pass the barriers. If one aperture remains unopened, affliction will cling. In your cultivation, who among you knows this? Without compassion, I would not descend to explain in detail—so that you may guard against calamity, and not blame the immortals for misleading you. By method, I would not have you all tremble in fear!

Between prior and posterior *qi*, only a thought’s breath divides. Thought is inherently hard to purify; it must follow nature. Do not rigidly fix thought, for rigidity blocks the pass. In the central field, *qi* gathers in its entirety. The immortals speak of "gathering"—gathering the prior Heaven. When posterior thought ceases, prior Heaven arises naturally. United as one, the three barriers are filled. Harmonizing yin and yang, the two link as pairs. Yin wanes, yang waxes, solidifying into a single mass. From this, the elixir grows; from this, the sprout takes hold.

Now observing sentient beings, each suffers from clinging illness. All belongs to prior and posterior, their boundaries undistinguished. I have now pointed this out—let each of you reflect and strive.

Before ascending the seat, first cultivate a state of ease—neither constrained nor bound, lively and natural. Only then ascend; no restraints shall linger. As thoughts arise, let them depart of their own accord. As they transform naturally, preserve only the wholeness of spirit. If thoughts accumulate, do not cling to them in the slightest. Close the eyes and contemplate sleep; the body dissolves, the form remains complete. Neither self nor other exists—only a lifeless mass. Through such practice, illness naturally subsides. No ailment shall arise, and the entire being relaxes in peace.

To rigidly fix thought is to block *qi*; fire then scorches the source. To forcefully direct *qi* is to scatter it; perverse flames blaze even brighter. Illness arises from this, burning away the true origin. In women, the Sea of Blood is where *qi* transforms and emerges. When perverse fire stirs, it steams through the vital origin. Blood gradually withers, and healing becomes difficult. When blood stirs, all the more should one relax and expand. Do not let restlessness arise; do not harbor anger. Thoughts should be purified further, spirit further stilled. As all distractions dissolve, sitting then becomes natural.

If one acts with impatience or anger, the central field is offended. Day and night, the heart burns, the mouth turns bitter, the tongue parched—all stems from this. Who discerns this cause? Those who cultivate and refine must not transgress even the slightest.

Even the slightest speck of dust on the casket harms the true origin. You remain unaware, yet suffering draws near. Chills and fever arise from imbalance. Do not claim to cultivate the Dao to cure illness and prolong life—if you fail to examine yourself, suffering will be immense.

At every moment, in every thought, scrutinize carefully. Avoid offense, avoid disturbance, and the elixir will grow effortlessly. No need to yearn—mystery unfolds of itself. No need for arduous effort—the pill forms through nine transformations. No need for strenuous sitting—every moment is Chan. In stillness or movement, in solitude or company, the wondrous elixir grows.

You who cultivate, your minds are not unwhole—yet later intrusions sever the primordial. Few escape illness; how then to blame the immortals? I now point this out—ponder it carefully. All wondrous methods are sharp as a blade, yet whole. Not a hair’s breadth may err, not a thread’s weight may cling.

Morning and evening, wander freely, at ease and unburdened. Whether eating or fasting, let it not weigh on your mind. Whether acting or still, do not circle in distraction. After a hundred days, wondrous signs will appear. After a year of practice, the ten thousand phenomena will align naturally.

Do not cling to the word *cultivate*; refine it further. If not bound by even a single word, transformation flows like a spring. Only then is it true cultivation, true refinement. Cultivation uproots evil; refinement restores wholeness. To refine the formed invites illness; to refine the formless is true mystery.

Today, I stand before you, sweeping away the ten thousand phenomena. First guard against the six thieves—yet let it be natural. To guard with intent is the hardest of hardships. To guard without intent is to stand firm. Unbreakable, what need is there for defense?

Women and men alike, unite in diligence. Wherever you dwell, whatever vow you hold, the matter is ordinary—do not see it as difficult. How simple it is: only distinguish worldly ties. When thoughts cease, you are Buddha; when desires cease, you are immortal. Immortal and Buddha differ not—they ferry all from the dusty world.

You inherently possess the mind—refine it into a golden immortal. Without refining, it forms itself; without establishing, it stands itself. Sweep away thoughts and delusions—do not let them cling. Joy day after day—this is the immortal. Persist thus, and why fear the Western Heaven?

I come to ferry you, to restore your golden body whole. Measure yourselves—value your own dedication. My words may seem shallow, but their wonder lies in deeper exploration. From beginning to end, the great method is complete.

The Golden Sand Ancient Buddha says:
The method is not wondrous, nor the formula—wonder lies in the firing time, the foremost essential.
The Dao arises from the Limitless; the Limitless originally enfolds the aperture.
Essence issues from here, *qi* stirs from here, the medicine is born from here, the embryo is preserved from here.
Examine closely—the mechanism leaps of itself, alive and flowing, deep and vast.
All take root in this aperture.

From a broad view, the hundred vessels branch from the Limitless to shape form.
From a subtle perspective, it belongs to the formless and imageless, yet originally encompasses all transformations.
Men and women share this supreme treasure—only divided into two paths: blood and essence.
Male essence ascends to become immortal; female blood rises straight to the heart aperture.
Thus, each has its own method, its own illumination.
Though women’s practice employs the *congealing* method, do not tightly grasp the mind-ground.
If the mind-horse is hard to tether, even a fleeting thought stirs the Sea of Blood.

The Sea of Blood and the Sea of *Qi* are distinct—before the Sea of Blood lies seven-tenths.
Here is the aperture of the Sea of *Qi*, located in the wondrous gate neither above nor below, neither left nor right.
Blood transforms, *qi* congeals—mysterious is the transmutation of postnatal *qi* into the primordial.
A single taint of human desire severs it—with the postnatal but no primordial, you become mortal.
Know that immortal and mortal differ here.

The Dao here is not yet the Dao; *qi* must return to the root, the Limitless aperture,
to congeal this spiritual sprout, to form the pill when the firing time arrives.
How to distinguish this point of before and after? The firing time must not be lacking.
If the Water of *Gui* has not yet come, practice diligently without slack.
Morning and evening, be lively and joyful.

Too loose, the spirit scatters; too tight, the *qi*-aperture closes.
It must be neither loose nor tight, neither late nor early.
Not dwelling is dwelling; not good is the good.
Not congealing is congealing; not illuminating is illumination.
This firing time is most subtle—women must attend to it carefully.
Without recognizing this point, it is not cultivation.
The words *cultivation* and *refinement* must be forgotten.
To cling too much to *refinement* is to leave traces—one clinging stirs the roots of illness.
Once this illness takes hold, medicine cannot reach it.

People say illness roots in the organs—this illness hides in the marrow’s path.
How can medicine remove it? Only by the single yang point piercing the inner aperture can this illness be eradicated.

Good, good, good. I will show you another principle, peel back layers of the firing time.
Without layer-by-layer revelation, confusion remains, and illness deepens.
*Qi*’s surging must return to the aperture. When movement arises, stillness cannot begin.
Let it be unknown, unperceived—return to the root.
At the first stirring, life and destiny, yin and yang meet.
Water and fire intermingle, the Limitless divides, the Supreme Ultimate enfolds, transforming into primordial chaos.

Sit and slightly refine—congeal the formless, do not hold to form.
A hint of stillness—do not seize it. Let it be natural and quiet.
Do not rashly engage the conscious mind.

Let everything go—sleep as it comes, dullness as it comes.
Do not err in the slightest shock.
Few recognize this firing time.
Most mistake stillness for delusion—when the body moves, *qi* scatters, becoming demonic obstruction.
A thousand, ten thousand thoughts swirl.
At this moment, descend from the platform, take a walk, then return to rest.
Wait a moment, then ascend again to nurture stillness—stillness will naturally return to the root.

If forced sitting is imposed, disease takes root within.
With too many deluded thoughts, first sleep, then apply focused spirit—
where there is no delusion, do not force it; where delusion arises, refine the heart-mind.
The word "refine" must be understood flexibly:
a faint congealment, a state of dim indistinction—
only then is it the method of *ninglian* (congealing and refining),
only then is it the first vehicle of entering stillness,
this is precisely the firing time of ascending the platform.

When movement occurs, the firing time must be clearly distinguished:
the moment of movement must be sensed, and when sensed, do not let worldly dust intrude.
Here lies the boundary between heaven and humanity,
here the division between immortals and mortals.
It is like the body of an infant yet unawakened—
the precelestial body is already aware, while the postcelestial gives rise to this realm.
Examine this closely:
at the first instant of awareness, there is still a trace of dim indistinction;
once awareness arises again, ten thousand thoughts entangle.
The words "first" and "again" are like lightning—
in a single flash, all chaotic images vanish.
The correct thought listens to the division of *qi*;
if deluded thoughts disturb the congealing and refining,
advance one layer—still listen to the *qi* returning yin and yang,
and when both are restored to their origin, wander freely again.
In applying this effort, never slacken—
apart from this method, there is no higher vehicle.

I now reveal this true and wondrous secret:
let men and women alike bear it in mind.
If not refining the true seed with a true heart,
carelessly leaking celestial mechanism invites thunderous retribution.
Though the method seems simple and plain,
only through careful reflection does its subtlety become clear.
This is the practice before attaining the Golden Elixir,
a daily gate one must never depart from.

The Perfected of White Lotus says:
Establish resolve with steadfast integrity,
and never let worldly dust pollute your being.
The method is fundamentally level and easy—
in its circulation, do not pause or linger.
At times the method should be applied,
but know not to be overly rigid.
At times the method should be set aside,
silently guarding your original true nature.
Movement and stillness mutually interpenetrate,
moment by moment aligning with the heart-mind of heaven.
The chaste woman originally has no method—
this is but a touch to the eye.

Blood and *qi* wax and wane;
the work of nurturing must run deep.
With time, blood transforms into *qi*,
white essence pervades the entire body.
Naturally, yin completes yang,
and the red dust no longer stirs the heart.
Only then can the *Qian* body be achieved,
only then can the highest truth be realized.
Even the slightest deceitful thought
may yet cause one to fall into the abyss.

The Perfected of White Lotus says:
Stages are the steps of cultivation;
chastity and stillness, free from dust, are the first dhyāna.
Add to this the refinement and nurturing of true *qi*—
yin descends, yang ascends, revealing the Mysterious Pass.
The Mysterious Pass is not sought outside the body—
it is found within an inch of space to seek the Great Elixir.
When the heart-mind is still, the spirit at ease,
vibrantly and freely circulate the *Zhoutian*.
*Qi* returns to its source, blood returns to its source—
gently refine them within the furnace.
Neither scorching in summer nor freezing in winter,
warmly nurture this true beauty.
After ten months, the Elixir is complete;
three years of nursing follow naturally.
Naturally ascend to the Great Brahma Heaven,
naturally ascend to the Great Brahma Heaven.

The Ancient Buddha of Golden Sand says:
From whence does the Female Elixir arise?
Man and woman do not correspond,
woman and man differ greatly.
The male elixir transforms essence into *qi*,
*qi* into spirit, spirit into emptiness—
when emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound,
the Elixir naturally coalesces.
The female elixir transforms blood into *qi*,
*qi* into spirit, spirit into emptiness—
in the emptiness of nonbeing, the Elixir naturally forms.
Yet though *qi* arises from blood, there are two interpretations:
if the heart-mind is unsettled, thoughts impure,
the body restless, *qi* unbalanced,
then blood cannot transform into *qi*,
and blood remains mere blood.
If *qi* does not manifest as *qi*, blood becomes entirely turbid,
and the monthly flow appears.
This flow is inherently foul and turbid—
how can it transform into *qi*?
What transforms into *qi* is blood,
but what enables this transformation is the primordial *qi* within the blood.
What is primordial *qi*?
Blood is the essence-*qi* that pervades the entire body.
With this blood, essence-*qi* is stored;
without it, *qi* has no place to reside.
Blood is like seawater—
when water congeals, *qi* congeals;
when it surges upward, rain and dew descend.
The human body has blood like the sea—
thus blood naturally transforms into *qi* and ascends throughout the body,
then flows through the hundred vessels.
When the hundred vessels are connected, a single point descends—
from this, the hope of the Elixir’s formation arises.
Otherwise, if the mind is filled with worldly concerns,
daily entangled in external affairs,
with a temper hasty and reckless,
drawn by worldly splendor,
plagued by sorrow and depression,
disturbed by deluded thoughts,
never a moment of tranquility—
then turbid *qi* blocks true *qi*,
heaven and earth do not commune, yin and yang are not harmonized,
cold and heat are not regulated, the *Zhoutian* does not align,
and disease becomes inevitable in nearly every case.
This is not the fault of the Dao—
it is truly the fault of the person!

I now point this out to all beings:
each should carefully reflect and comprehend.
Do not say the Dao is not true—
the problem lies only in your heart not being true!
If your heart is truly sincere,
sweep away all floating thoughts,
discard all worldly splendor,
soften your temperament,
banish all violence,
free yourself from worries and attain a joyful spirit,
cut off external affairs—
then heavenly *qi* descends, earthly *qi* ascends,
and primordial true *qi* naturally flows forth,
filling the sea of blood.
*Qi* then naturally connects with spirit-*qi*.
If you do not sit, so be it—
but once you sit, it happens of itself,
within which there is an inexplicable wonder,
a realm entirely different from all human worlds.
Only then do you realize the Dao is not empty,
immortality is not false,
and the secret does not mislead—
it only requires self-nature to awaken itself.

I now offer another elixir of words:
Some say that if the Red Dragon is not slain, the Elixir cannot form,
and the Dao cannot be achieved—
but if blood is exhausted, *qi* is also exhausted.
Just as when a man’s essence is depleted and the Elixir is difficult to form,
the principle is the same.
For men, essence; for women, blood—
neither should be entirely cut off.
*Qi* departs from blood, and *qi* has no way to arise;
blood transforms into *qi*, and essence begins to flow.
If one claims that blood must be exhausted to refine the Elixir,
why do young women with withered blood fall ill instead?
This ultimately does not depart from the consideration of blood.

Others say that after years of refinement, there is no effect—
not because there is no secret,
but truly because the heart-mind has no moment of stillness.
Even if one sits morning and night,
not a single hour in the twelve is tranquil—
even if there is stillness, it lasts only a few moments.
When does *qi* have time to transform?

When does the spirit congeal? When does the Elixir coalesce?
Year after year, one merely becomes a dullard!
Those who claim to cultivate the Dao or preserve chastity,
yet remain uninvolved in worldly affairs—
I observe their reality, and they differ little from ordinary folk.

Others say: so-and-so has obtained the true secret,
or so-and-so has practiced for many years yet achieved nothing.
Little do they know that those who gain the true wondrous secret
begin with diligence but end in slackness;
those who practice for many years merely wait in complacency.
To cultivate the Dao in this manner is to deceive the Dao most gravely!

Now I exhort you, all beings:
When I speak of your wealth, it cannot compare;
when I speak of your nobility, it is incomparable;
when I speak of your clothing and food, they pale beside mine.
Yet I have already severed all attachments in this very moment—
what difficulty do you have in letting go?
Those who cannot sever attachments are truly deluded,
and in their delusion, they fear they will become beings without affinity—
how lamentable!

For the immortals and buddhas, with compassion, deliver the world;
people must not abandon themselves.
If they could become immortals and buddhas, I would rejoice,
for my heart is set on universal salvation—
only do not cut yourselves off from me.

Samantabhadra Bodhisattva says:
Morning and night, one cultivates in hope of forming the Golden Elixir.
The mercury of the Elixir is not the unrefined Elixir.
The Elixir resides within the body, formless and traceless.
Where there is trace, it is not wondrous;
where there is no trace, it is utterly mysterious.
When mystery abides, the Elixir is complete—
without mystery, it cannot be spoken of.
To refine with intention is to waste the mind’s monkey;
only when refinement occurs without deliberate refinement
is it called the Great Elixir.
The Elixir descends from emptiness, one with heaven and earth.
Tangible *qi* is not the wondrous explanation;
the formless origin contains all phenomena.
Once attained, it is eternally attained—
emptiness swirling in emptiness.

When things arise, here the first signs appear;
when things flourish, here the spark ignites;
when things withdraw, here the wonder is mastered.
What has form and image is called the posterior heaven;
what is imageless and shadowless is the prior heaven.
The posterior heaven is generated and completed;
the prior heaven is the origin of signs.
In human life, the principle is fundamentally one.
Imageless and intangible, it conceals a mystery within.
The posterior heaven obscures it, and the mystery ceases to be mysterious.
Now I reveal the wondrous method, having refined it for years.
Who does not know this? Yet later generations find it hard to speak of.
Once the spirit is recognized, thoughts are not yet a clear pool.
Too often, human desires intrude; too rarely is the mystery of the Dao glimpsed.
Seven days to return—yet even this is difficult.
The heart is thick with dust, the spirit steeped in delusion.
Neither bright nor pure, neither clean nor dry,
both spirit and *qi* are harmed—how can the pass be opened?
If the pass is not opened, how can the aperture begin?
If the aperture does not open, how can the drawing and adding be set in motion?
If drawing and adding are not set in motion, one sits on the meditation cushion in vain.

Now I speak again of gathering and preserving the spirit whole.
Gathering is self-gathering, yet it holds a mystery.
The moment a thought stirs, it turns of itself.
Its emergence must have its time, tested in the central field.
The previously revealed wondrous method moves as if moving,
yet as if uninvolved.
This "as if" movement severs heaven and earth.
When suddenly it arises "as if," the maiden and mercury unite.
This point is most wondrous, never before spoken of.
Now I reveal it in detail—do not transmit it lightly.

The classics and scriptures on the Elixir each proclaim:
All speak of "as if," of the maiden uniting with the phoenix.
Yet this is only half the story, without distinction of boundary,
without division of time, without precedence.
Now I speak further, to be studied in detail:
When "as if" moves, prior and posterior both partake.
Knowing the "as if" movement, the womb has its key.
When it moves in profound obscurity, "as if" occurs naturally—
only then is the test understood.
The origin of the spirit’s emergence:
To move knowing it moves is still posterior heaven;
to not know the sudden movement is "as if" in joy.
Indescribably wondrous, boundless delight—
only then is it called "as if" movement, and the Great Elixir is formed.
Witnessing this wondrous realm, worldly affinities vanish of themselves.
No need to sweep away appearances—all thoughts are relinquished.
The skandhas do not cling to emptiness; emptiness is naturally empty.
Not clinging to the form of emptiness, all realms are an empty pool.
The movement of heaven and earth, I am one with the whole;
the stillness of heaven and earth, I am one with the mystery.
The arising of heaven and earth, I share in it;
the withdrawal of heaven and earth, I am one with the origin.
When one reaches this point, the Great Awakening may begin to be spoken of.
Without reaching this realm, even immortality is difficult to attain—
how much more the Great Awakening? How lightly can it be spoken of!

Now I reveal the turning of "as if,"
the mechanism fully exposed, the wondrous method boundless.

The Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool says:
The true maiden is originally a child’s body,
distinguished only by purity and turbidity.
Though lead and mercury are complete,
alas, they have already transformed into form.
Once entering the womb,
they can no longer be called by their true names.
Having fallen into the posterior heaven,
how can they take flight?
Even if the primordial *qi* is fully rounded,
it must still be refined into undifferentiated oneness.
Only by returning from being to non-being
can one speak of returning to the root.

As for the principle of returning,
women have not understood its melody.
They constantly cling and guard,
their eyes fixed on the breast’s courtyard.
Purity and turbidity are hard to distinguish;
how can *qi* congeal in confusion?
Purity ascends and turbidity descends—
this is the constant principle one hears of.
If one over-fixates and *qi* does not move,
turbid *qi* rises instead.
When pure *qi* sinks,
how can one recognize the spirit’s numen?

Women have no other secret—
liveliness is the essential scripture.
When the heart is lively, *qi* naturally flourishes;
when the spirit is lively, *qi* naturally becomes numinous;
when intention is lively, *qi* naturally stabilizes;
when nature is lively, *qi* naturally ascends.
Liveliness is not external—
in the heart, no trace is left.
When the heart is settled, one sits upright;
sitting upright, the breath is harmonized.
When breath is harmonized, the body transforms,
and true joy arises within.
In joy, one forgets joy,
and the whole body’s *qi* merges into oneness.
Naturally, it returns to the ancestral aperture,
with no trace of mechanism remaining.
If one can be still for a moment, for a moment it returns to the central courtyard;
if one can be still for an hour, for an hour *qi* circles back.
If one can be still every morning and night,
in a month, the practice bears numen.
In a hundred days, there will be signs;
in twelve years, one will surely ascend.

How can one achieve such swift attainment?
The primordial *qi* has not yet leaked or collapsed.
Alas, too much restraint—
*qi* and blood remain undifferentiated.
At times *qi* transforms into blood,
at times blood transmutes into silver.
In transformation, not the slightest awareness arises;
in a trance, it shifts and inclines again.
Thus, through years and months,
the numinous efficacy remains unseen.
Instead, one withers into desiccation,
and illness clings to the body.
Without contemplating the great Dao’s unfolding,
how can one discern the luminous truth?

Xiang Yi Gu Mu says:
Now I discourse on the profound principle,
speaking solely of the Queen of Methods for women.
Woman is inherently a tranquil being,
within yin, yang is also contained.
To guard stillness is ever difficult to still—
mechanisms lie hidden within the yellow center.
Though stillness is her original nature,
governing softness still relies on firmness.
Firmness is the master of yang,
softness the repository of yin.
Recognizing firmness within softness,
one may attain strength within weakness.
*Qi* and blood arise later,
while the ancestral aperture spontaneously emits yang.
When one *qi* flows through the four limbs,
the hundred vessels all become nectar.
Why sever the Red Dragon?
When turbidity is exhausted, radiance flows.
This distinction is fundamental—
women are divided in two.
The female body is not whole,
for primordial *qi* has already been harmed.
To restore the *qi* of Kun’s yin,
activation begins in the breasts.
With the subtlest application of true intention,
guide the fire with precious care.
If one is even slightly too overt,
blood stagnates and illness lurks unseen.
Move with neither intent nor absence of intent—
neither assist nor forget.
Over time, *qi* returns to its source,
and yin *qi* naturally perishes.
Yin subdued, yang ascends,
refining into the firmness of Qian’s primordial yang.
For virgins, this method is unnecessary—
only true stillness from beginning to end suffices.
When *qi* is still, blood transforms of itself;
when spirit is clear, *qi* naturally rises.
Without knowing or recognizing,
transformation is wholly contained.
The celestial circuit divides by degrees,
unobstructed, harmonizing yin and yang.
Beginning with blood transforming into *qi*,
culminating in softness becoming firmness.
In a month, *qi* converges and meets—
expelling turbidity, retaining primordial yang.
When turbidity is exhausted, purity ascends,
naturally cleansing the foul intestines.
Radiance shines with true brilliance,
the bone marrow reveals its lustrous glow.
If the original source is not purified,
thoughts and cares will secretly injure.
When fire blazes, the whole body grows hot—
this is the true yang manifesting contrary to the Dao.
If one knows the method to halt the fire,
without intent, silently forget.
Perverse fire instantly vanishes,
and true primordial *qi* remains unharmed.
This is the true oral transmission—
women must be vigilant.
If one can truly be thus,
the Dao will be attained and the Queen of Methods met.

Bailian Zhenren says:

Those with aspirations beyond the dusty world,
set their resolve without bias—
yet must gather and restrain both outer and inner,
for stillness unmoved is the root-source.
Sit in tranquility long, and vexations scatter;
even slight constraint makes *qi* hard to perfect.
Women are inherently tranquil—
in stillness they refine,
true *qi* leaps and surges of itself,
forgetting intent, forgetting words, abiding in utmost goodness,
unshifting, unchanging, uniting with the Mysterious Pass.
Let *qi* flow without stagnation,
let it settle without forced addition.
In refining, neither overdone nor deficient—
cold and dryness both are bias.
If one can practice thus,
merit will be complete and the primordial seen.
How is the primordial seen?
Only when the heart holds no entanglements,
unbound and unclinging, spirit moves freely,
spirit free, life and nature twine together,
spinning ceaselessly, yin and yang meet,
their union fills and perfects true *qi*.
Perfect and full, it flows through the crown,
then descends, dripping upon the seven lotuses.
The lotus, nourished by sweet dew, revives at its heart—
in seven days and seven dawns, it blooms in full,
the lotus heart unfolds, the true heart appears,
the self-so Tathāgata pervades the great chiliocosm,
roaming freely through the worlds of the great chiliocosm,
gazing upon the sea of suffering at the edge of the red dust,
then knowing the immortals’ subtle pointers were not in vain,
truly not misleading those who board the compassionate vessel.
Women of chastity, refine with urgency—
surely you will bear fruit and wander the Western Heaven.

Guanghui Ancient Buddha says:
Now I point to a single firing time,
for chaste women to observe together.
Do not force sitting when weary,
but roam freely, unconstrained.
Let it be naturally released, naturally gathered—
when thoughts are still, spontaneously enter meditation;
when thoughts are not still, do not sit,
for forced sitting severs *qi* from the ancestral source.
This point of primordial *qi* arises in stillness,
growing gradually in ease, the two entwined.
Even in this entwining there is a test:
if the spirit grows dull and craves sleep,
then lightly sit upon the meditation bench—
in one sitting, true *qi* gathers naturally.
Without this method, spirit cannot unite;
with this practice over time, the crown becomes full.
Only by dissolving all worldly burdens
can the postnatal be shed and the primordial embraced.
If not among the chaste of both kinds,
do not covet this practice in vain.
If you covet it, sleep-demons will form,
and spirit and *qi* will be blocked at the apertures.
Again, for the chaste woman’s practice:
at the *zi* hour, when yang stirs, sit before the bench.
Silently recite the Buddha’s name thirty to fifty times,
then proceed as instructed before.
If at the *zi* hour the body does not move,
celestial and demonic forces will clash here.
If you can shift the body to dissolve demonic burdens,
a single Buddha’s name will resound through heaven and earth.
At the *chen* hour, do not move lightly—
reckless movement disrupts the spirit’s mechanism and harms the root.
This is the supreme secret of true cultivation,
for chaste women to observe together.
Why distinguish two kinds in refining the firing time?
The chaste woman’s spirit-source resides between both.
The faithful widow’s resolve may be firm,
yet before cultivation, she has often suffered depletion—
her inner store of primordial *qi* is already damaged,
and she must rekindle the furnace to restore the original.
At the *chen* hour, rise to sit only when spirit and *qi* are full;
if insufficient and unmoving, the elixir is further harmed.
Why is the elixir named as if it had form?
The elixir is *qi* congealed, called the Mysterious.
The Mysterious is another name for the elixir—
when spirit is complete, *qi* naturally returns in dual reunion.
This is the true firing time for the chaste woman:
after a hundred days of practice, then refine the elixir.
Women inherently hold true yin concealing true yang—
thus at the *chen* hour, apply effort in practice.
At the *zi* hour, when the first yang stirs,
it moves freely, circulating the microcosmic orbit.
When the first yang stirs, true yin flourishes—
sitting then, one naturally embraces and returns.
This points to the wondrous celestial mechanism within—
attend carefully, ponder deeply, do not speak idly.
The oral instructions are all provisional;
true cultivation lies in relinquishing all thoughts.
If you can cast off the ten thousand conditions, pure as water,
the bright pearl shines in your palm, radiant and full.

Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool says:
I now remind you:
women’s golden elixir
advances by degrees,
finds ease through effort.
From below to above,
from later to earlier.
Slowly refine,
gradually simmer.

Neither slack nor tense—
the fire’s timing comes naturally.
When the appointed time arrives and water surges,
the Northern Sea roars to the heavens.
Like a river in flood,
hasten to steer your boat.
If waves toss wildly,
the boat will surely be lost.

For women who cultivate stillness,
the sea’s waters are most steadfast.
When the term is fulfilled,
it blazes like wildfire across the plain.
If practice is not paused,
disaster will strike before your brows.
Stop for one seven-day cycle,
a second seven brings no harm.
Do not call this laziness—
the work is hard to resume.
Wait until the dew is clear,
then speak of entering the mystery.
If you do not wait until it is exhausted,
foul qi will mingle within.

When the tide of water floods the sea,
the time has come in full cycle.
Every aperture gathers and meets,
the microcosmic orbit is complete.
Flowing together, they descend—
thus it is called "roaring to the heavens."
Like a river’s tide,
a hundred streams and springs,
mountain brooks and small valleys,
all converge as one.
This is called "flooding"—
the principle is clearly spoken.

If stillness is cultivated without pause,
you will meet the appointed time in meditation.
When true fire arises,
foul impurities are burned away.
But if it becomes a chronic ailment,
the medicinal sprouts will not heal.
Not only the Northern Sea—
foulness dries to desiccation.
A hundred vessels are blocked,
the vital center hardens.
Strength cannot break through the blood,
dryness enters the marrow.

I now reveal this clearly,
speaking in detail.
Beware the strange calamity—
each one fears the difficulty.
This is the wondrous method,
never lightly transmitted.
I now point it out,
to encourage women of virtue.

Pause longer when the term arrives,
and you will not fall ill.
On the day the term is fulfilled,
liveliness comes first.
Do not worry, do not fret—
cast aside the seven emotions.
Sweep away the six desires,
abide in ease.
Free and unburdened,
do not crave cold drinks.
Spicy and pungent things—
do not let them touch your lips.
Illness will depart naturally,
and you will live in peace for a lifetime.

Within this karmic thread,
there are several strands.
In this life’s pursuit of the Dao,
past lives’ grievances accumulate.
Grievance repays grievance—
how can the body be at peace?
Often afflicted by illness,
karma is hard to complete.
Those who abandon the path midway
are secretly entangled.
Though life may not be joyful,
in death they attain immortality.
If one can complete the work in life,
they hold the Golden Immortal in their grasp.
From immortality upward,
they ascend straight to the Western Heaven.
The two paths of life and death—
why cling to them in the heart?

I now speak this to you,
all worthy women.
Suffering within suffering—
do not crave rich delicacies.
Let it pass just a little,
sweep away worldly ties.
When worldly ties are swept clean,
the true spirit is whole.
Preserve this single point,
and drift among the immortal mountains.
If you wish to climb the jeweled pagoda,
climb as high as you desire.
If you wish to reach Potalaka,
explore as far as your feet may go.
If you wish to wander the Eastern Capital,
roam at leisure.
If you wish to reach the Western Land,
the Buddha will guide you across the pass.
If you wish to step into the Numinous Empyrean,
advance as you will.

What I have said
contains no falsehood.
Women’s practice
is the same as men’s.
Only the stages differ—
the ground itself is not mysterious.
All wondrous transformations
are no different from men’s.
You must awaken to this—
it is all recorded in these writings.
Not a single error—
each must cultivate in seclusion.

Remember this well—
my heart rejoices greatly.

*Resonant Moon Wenchong Ancient Buddha annotates:*

Disaster arises before the brows when the tide of blood surges like fire—if you do not cease practice and instead fight fire with fire, the blood will overheat and wither into desiccation. The "sea tide" refers to the time when the moon’s influence flows forth; you must cease practice and sit in stillness. If you persist for several days, it is like sailing a boat on a river, knowing the waves rage yet deliberately setting forth—you will surely lose everything. Remember this well, and do not neglect it!

*Resonant Moon Wenchong Ancient Buddha says:*
Though the Dao is divided into stages, it is merely to tether the heart of the cultivator. If we speak of chastity, no refinement is needed—only the two words *true* and *still* hold profound mystery. Woman is inherently a vessel of stillness; opening and closing arise naturally, the numinous qi manifests of itself, blood transforms into golden elixir, yin qi dissolves entirely, and true fire steams within the marrow. What obstruction or illness remains? What need is there for the "slaying of the dragon"? Transformation occurs not by force, but of itself—Earth’s position turns to Heaven.

*Resonant Moon Wenchong Ancient Buddha says:*
Purity and sincerity are the wondrous mystery. Do not let later-arising thoughts disturb the primordial. When the mind is settled, sit long and steadfast; when the spirit grows dull, do not probe rigidly. The true nature shines bright as the moon, the Great Mystery Gate clear as autumn waters. Lively yet unstained, unobstructed, it drifts in profound stillness as if at ease. The single spirit moves, and dross dissolves; joyous realms unfold like fish and kites. Do not confine the true self within the false body—only then can you return to the root and restore the original.

*Resonant Moon Wenchong Ancient Buddha says:*
The jeweled lotus throne and pagoda await such a one—truly, truly, the original cause is never obscured. First, clearly distinguish the pure from the turbid; with long sitting, numinous qi gradually arises. Do not fear the rising and steaming of primordial qi—let it ascend and descend, naturally harmonizing. Neither forget nor force the true firing times; whether intentional or unintentional, do not linger. If vexation arises, walk and disperse it; if rigidity takes hold, the spirit will not settle. Movement of thought is fire, not true medicine; stillness of nature, unstained, is true gold. Refinement requires no division into stages—once the dross is washed away, clarity comes of itself. No need to seek other true oral instructions—tonight’s words must be strictly heeded.

*Golden Sand Ancient Buddha says:*
I awaken the women cultivating truth within their karmic conditions: chastity and its opposite arise from the roots of hearing. Know this wondrous secret—it is not without method, for the method itself emerges from the secret. Constantly wash the mortal body and return to the realm of stillness; diligently nurture the immortal heart, and filth melts like ice. Value the immortal root and minimize worldly disturbances; sever mortal bones and exchange them for an immortal frame. Clearly and constantly reflect upon your former self; the seven stars of the Dipper radiate brilliance. Let the eyes’ spiritual light ever arise within; let the ears’ numinous qi ever close their gates. Let the nose not be drawn by worldly fragrances—true fragrance stirs and pierces the seven stars. Let the mouth shut out coarse, vulgar breath; in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, chant the Buddha’s name. Let the hands not cling to worldly affections—often turn the pages of scriptures and recite the sutras. Let the feet stand firm upon the Terrace of Heaven; wander freely through the Elixir Chamber and Meditation Palace. If your steps are light and your heart sways, delusion stirs the ears and eyes, disturbing the spirit. When the spirit is disturbed, the heart follows external conditions, scattering without return—how can qi be harmonized? If inner absorption is uneven, outer qi intrudes; when inner and outer unite in a single breath, you return to the root. If the inner master does not waver, the spirit steadies itself; if it wavers and does not settle, qi cannot fill. Even if true mechanism stirs, weariness without return disturbs the Yellow Court. When breath is even, the primordial moves; the acquired yields to the primordial’s course. If you can contemplate death and sever the acquired, the primordial will arise from left and right. This mechanism comes naturally—no technique or secret instruction is needed to illuminate it. I have now revealed the supreme wonder; may you, in your mortal frame, reflect and act upon it. Together, guard the true aspiration and do not covet secrets; I point out your barriers and strengthen your resolve. If your aspiration aligns with mine, if your heart can be as clear as mine—if your heart is as clear as water, after three years I will come to you in person. I will manifest to deliver your virginal body; my form will soar through empty space like clouds. My form will always dwell within your heart—your heart is my Avalokiteśvara. The Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will always be present; when your merit is complete and the fruit ripens, you will accompany my body. A single lotus can transform into a thousand myriad blossoms; a thousand myriad lotuses will cover your body. If you do not tread this swift path, where else will you bow to the World-Honored One?

*Golden Sand Ancient Buddha says:*
I have no other method—only the supreme means of gathering the heart, the most wondrous way of sweeping thoughts—each is clearly pointed out to you. The wandering of heart and intent is nothing other than failing to chew and contemplate the Great Dao. Consider this body dwelling in the red dust—it is like being in a sea of suffering. This life falls into the human realm; the next may be lost, and suffering will be unbearable. As the saying goes, "Once the human body is lost, ten thousand kalpas will pass in difficulty." Fortunately, you have now encountered the Great Dao. Sitting on the meditation cushion, neither the heart needs gathering, nor the intent observing, nor thoughts sweeping, nor the monkey tethering. Have a body as if without a body; let the heart be as if without barriers. Neither observe your heart nor memorize your dharma words. Simply take a single intent and place it between the breasts—if the heart is unsettled for a moment, do not cast it aside for that moment; if two or three thoughts are impure, do not idle for those two or three. Yet do not bind it too tightly—it should rest in the space between intention and non-intention. If too tight, qi will stagnate; if inattentive, thoughts will stray. I have another method, also a supreme elixir for gathering the heart: constantly recite the classics. Whether chanting aloud or silently, recite a sutra once—this takes only a moment or two. When you feel dazed, thoughts will naturally fall away, and effortlessly the merit will be complete. After a hundred days, you will perceive the primordial; if sleep demons arise during sitting, upon waking, immediately engage in meditation. With a clear aspiration, no need to gather—when thoughts arise, use this method to collect deluded thoughts. Truly difficult! Truly difficult!

Truly difficult to drag you from these entanglements! Endlessly severing the reds and greens, the gaudy robes of worldly adornment. Unseverable are the southern fields and northern lands, the long strings of affection for sons and daughters-in-law. Even with the powers of immortals and buddhas, it is hard to ferry you to the immortal gardens, hard to carry you aboard my boat. I urge you not to retreat, lest you cast your golden elixir into the boundless sea of karmic debt. In life, you knew no repentance; only in death do you awaken.

Awaken now, chaste maidens, each reflect deeply: the roots of your past lives were not shallow. In this life, you have encountered a rare opportunity—no one has led you by the hand, yet you have heard the profound mysteries of the Great Dao expounded. Each of you, by your own heart’s resolve, has seen through the red-dust world, severed the seven emotions, and remained unstained. Truly, this is a rarity through the ages, a woman who is a marvel among men. Yet the eye is the chief of the six thieves—it cannot bear the sight of reds and greens, the allure of gaudy blossoms. A single thought turns you back; in every matter, you crave appearances. False human sentiments waste true mindfulness. I now urge you: do not cling to these.

Do not fret that these affairs will bear no fruit, nor that this great karmic bond will go unfulfilled. Do not worry that no one from Mount Potalaka will call to you. If you can sever all worldly attachments, naturally golden boys and jade maidens will come to tend you at all hours, ensuring your Dao-qi is not disturbed by demons, your Dao-methods not ensnared by evil. Press on to full awakening, unstained and untainted—your body will grow light, your form at ease, a hundred illnesses will not arise, and boundless joy will be yours. When your merit is complete, a jeweled canopy and banners will appear, guardian deities and Skanda will lead the way, the eighteen arhats will attend your carriage, and countless flower immortals and celestial maidens will surround you, escorting you to the Western Paradise. Chaste maidens, is this not a wondrous prospect?

Truly, your past roots are no less than your present karmic conditions. These are the precious teachings of the heavenly immortals, earnest words from a pained heart. Take heed, and let each of you remember them well.

**The Illuminated Dao Mother says:**
The luminous qi is originally round,
qi originally dwells in one cavity.
This cavity divides into nine apertures,
east and west, south and north.
The constellations array their positions,
all pivoting on the One.
Unseen and unheard,
it seems to exist, seems not—yet distinct.
Existence and non-existence converge at the center,
radiant brilliance fills the four directions.
This cavity is not large,
yet it encompasses all phenomena.
Vast as the space beyond the heavens,
small as the form it matches—unfathomable.
Lofty as the three heavens,
low as the depths of the sea.
The cavity’s path is clearly marked,
let all listen plainly.
Now, I do not repeatedly point it out—
its subtlety is hard to fathom.

It is neither yin nor yang,
yang essence mingles with yin blood.
Yin qi returns to the sea of blood,
yang essence is discharged here.
Its arousal goes unnoticed,
yet in reverie, the heart is greatly pleased.
Floating and drifting,
the clear and turbid separate like black and white.
If displeased, the heart grows vexed and stifled;
yin and yang fail to connect.
Once the spirit attains ethereal subtlety,
qi envelops without obstruction.
At the midnight hour, the lotus begins to bloom,
yin and yang leaves intertwine.
Yin unites with the ancestral qi of yang,
lotus stamens array across the pond.
Yang joins with the ancestral qi of yin,
flowers bloom, branches and leaves flourish.
When this single flower opens,
seven blossoms all unfold.
The sea of blood connects to ancestral qi,
ancestral qi returns to the sea of blood.
When blood dries, qi is obstructed;
when qi is obstructed, blood is exhausted.
From obstruction and exhaustion, illness arises—
all due to qi stagnation.
And whence comes stagnation?
From constraint and lack of ease.
Because the heart is not detached,
the gates of prior and posterior qi are sealed.
Sealing is lower obstructing upper;
blockage is spoken of in vain.
Because sealing halts blood’s movement,
stasis leads to obstruction.
When qi is obstructed, the gates seal themselves,
not a single thread passes through.

The blood and qi have purity and turbidity—
how to distinguish them?
When the heart is pure, free of selfish delusion,
breath too is bright and clear.
Bright clarity unites with true yin,
true yang naturally presses in.
Pure and turbid separate of themselves—
trust this, and you will not lose even a month’s progress.
The light and pure ascend,
the turbid naturally leaks downward.
When the heart is impure, qi grows restless,
breath too becomes fierce.
Restlessness mingles with yang,
wicked fire blazes like iron.
It burns the true yang qi,
drying and withering—illness comes easily.
Worldly physicians are like the blind—
they diagnose pulses and prescribe recklessly.
First, they supplement qi and blood,
yet never address the passage of the gates.
Once turbid qi congeals,
meridians grow more obstructed.
When heart illness arises,
vexation and heat flare up.
Mouth parched, tongue scorched,
cold food offers temporary relief.
Medical arts grow ever more confused—
they question symptoms, then distinguish further.
Hearing of heat symptoms,
they prescribe cooling herbs like *zhi* and *huangbai*.
First supplementing, then cooling—
chronic illness becomes incurable.
After consuming every herb,
the complexion grows pale and emaciated.
When all else fails,
they add ginseng, deer antler, angelica, and turtle shell.
Nourishing yin and fostering yang,
the threads grow ever more tangled.
Cultivators of the true suffer harm,
each fearing to awaken.
Those who do not cultivate remain carefree,
while those who do endure setbacks.
I now make this clear warning:
when blood stagnates, there are rules to follow.
Blood is like the waters of a mountain valley—
it cannot be forced to flow by damming.
Once a dam breaks and surges,
it disrupts the proper meridian points.
Forced to flow askew,
it may even breach its bounds.
Within the sea of blood in the human body,
there are only three vessels.
The seas of qi and blood,
the *Ren* and *Du* vessels—all one cavity.
Essence passes through here,
the turbid is discharged here.
If not for cold stagnation,
there would be no obstruction.
When blocked and unable to flow smoothly,
use medicine to open the passages.
It must be warming, not too drying—
distinguish the clear from the turbid.
Treat this illness thus,
and the skilled physician is called a master.

I now reveal this to spare you suffering.
Distinguish the paths of yin and yang—
for men and women, the principle is the same.
Men possess this ancestral qi,
distributed within the essence cavity.
For women, ancestral qi unites—
yin is spoken of in terms of the sea of blood.
Men have this yang gate—
whether flowing forward or backward, do not be confused.

Women possess the Northern Sea’s earth,
its waves surging as if pressed by water.
The great *zhou tian* stirs greatly,
the small *zhou tian* likewise expands.
Twelve two-hour watches await,
the *zi* and *wu* poles converge.
This point admits of distinction—
those who cultivate may yet lack the dwelling.
The cultivator unites *zi* and *wu*,
true *qi* truly conjoins.
Without cultivation, though union occurs,
true ancestral *qi* is hard to release.
Here lies the true life’s essence—
do not lightly or recklessly speak of it.

The Northern Sea holds clear and turbid;
the turbid is *qi* faint and insipid.
Turbidity reveals form and substance—
on this day, thoughts must be swept away.
When thoughts are pure, clarity floats upward,
meeting ancestral *qi*.
When thoughts are mixed, *qi* enters substance,
and clarity instead turns foul.
If the monthly cycle errs,
it is because thoughts are too heavy.
Heavy thoughts dull the spirit,
and when the spirit is dull, no distinction is made.
Clear and turbid intermingle,
true *qi* fails to rise.
If this is the constant state,
such is the illness that arises in the pulse.
It must be addressed on that very day—
do not indulge in idle or deluded thoughts.
Abide in ease without the slightest stagnation,
flowing freely and unconstrained.

Do not worry, nor fret,
do not startle, nor fear.
Do not strain, nor inflate,
but remain bright and pure.
In movement and stillness, unobstructed,
alert and joyful.
Unknowing and unaware,
hearing and listening without attachment.
The body drifts as if weightless,
illumined by heaven’s light and earth’s whiteness.
Hands and feet feel as light as feathers,
floating without clinging.

Most to be avoided is an overzealous heart,
fearing that effort may be flawed.
This thought is a grave illness—
swiftly remedy it without delay.
Before the twenty-one days of discharge are complete,
do not restrict bedding or routine.
Wait until the discharge fully ceases,
then ascend the bed—only then is it proper.
This is an immutable method,
not to be transmitted to the unworthy.

The essence of heaven and earth—
once lost here, it cannot be regained.
I now urge you, women,
do not fixate on these secrets in your hearts.
Without secrets, the Dao is hard to fathom,
but clinging to secrets creates barriers in *qi*.
In daily life, let heart and mouth
quietly recite the Buddha’s name.
Recite only when thoughts arise;
when thoughts cease, do not recite.
Attend only to worldly affairs,
and do not let your hands chase butterflies.
Beyond mending clothes and shoes,
constantly examine your inner practice.
Engage in worldly tasks,
but let your thoughts remain cold as iron.
The eye is the thief that shakes the heart—
do not be drawn to the colors of flowers and shadows.
These are the burdens of the mundane frame;
if you wish to cultivate virtue,
cultivate virtue and the true,
refine your nature and purify your heart’s impurities.
Purify impurities, and virtue renews itself—
one morning, *qi* will steam forth.
You will ascend beyond the body, above the clouds,
drifting and resting in the far north.
I ride a phoenix chariot,
golden flowers and immortal maidens welcome you.
They guide you to wander the upper realms,
escort you to the Buddha’s land.
Ascend the tiers of the immortal pagoda,
your eyes beholding the vast expanse.
The toiling masses of the red dust,
their worldly fetters so pitiful.
Gazing southward,
tears fall like silk.
Though great compassion stirs,
it cannot aid those without affinity.
Even the great vow’s ship
cannot ferry those who create their own suffering.

The great Buddha of the Western Heaven,
even myriad methods cannot purify all.
I am the original luminous ancestor,
descended to this dwelling.
I point clearly, again and again—
how earnestly I hope for your awakening.
Do not forget this earnest instruction;
tranquility at dawn and dusk is the secret.

If you are often entangled and disturbed,
it is because the eye invites thieves.
See as if you have not seen,
turn inward to contemplate the inner cavity.
Neither light nor heavy,
neither urgent nor idle.
Neither restless nor reckless,
never forced in any way.
Neither clinging nor detached,
all vexations vanish.
Without seeking joy, joy arises naturally;
without forcing cessation, cessation occurs naturally.
When seated above, do not exert intent—
like a corpse, silent and still.
Though heaven collapses, you do not collapse;
though earth splits, you do not split.
Though others speak, do not be moved—
understand for yourself, clearly.

Worldly blessings and red fortunes—
regard the red as you would black.
Discern the true from the false in blue and white;
people are mixed, each of different kinds.
Without a vajra body,
do not recklessly wander the Land of Bliss.
Do not calculate length or shortness,
do not listen, and delusions will vanish of themselves.
Transcend the world by how many ranks?
Do not conform to the vulgar.
Let your aspirations be great, but your words not boastful;
let your heart be true, but your thoughts not timid.
Constantly embody the immortals and Buddhas—
here I speak of the profound secret.

Women read few books,
and the principles of nature are even harder to attain.
Simply maintain a single pure thought,
without the slightest inner obstruction.
Like the light of heaven and the transforming sun,
like stars and the moon.
Like the brightness of the North Star,
the Seven Stars hanging in the celestial palace.
Bright and radiant,
luminous without a speck of darkness.
Let your heart be as bright as the Dipper,
the inner Seven Stars resplendent.
Dark clouds cannot obscure it—
its true nature remains unbroken.
When clouds pass, the stars still shine;
let your heart be like a blazing star.
With not a speck of dust in the heart,
if dust arises, the heart strays elsewhere.

The heart is originally without delusion—
delusion enters only through what is seen.
The heart is originally without other thoughts—
hearing brings misfortune.
The heart is originally without clinging—
the body’s lack of agility causes it.
When body and speech do not align with intent,
anger and displeasure arise.
With this single angry state,
fire erupts from the five viscera.
If this root is not eradicated,
all cultivation of the Dao is in vain.

Now I point out in detail—
the word "greed" must be severed.
Do not covet clothing or food,
for what is natural will come.
Do not cling even to good thoughts—
the thoughts of immortals and mortals differ.
Do not cling even to wondrous methods—
abiding in stillness is unfathomably subtle.
Do not cling even to effort—
sit in absorption whenever the moment allows.
Do not cling even to wondrous realms—
realm and form are without shape or color.
Abide in peace and joy,
in delight and gladness.
Flowing freely and unconstrained,
spacious and at ease.
This is the wondrous realm—
this realm cannot be grasped.
Let it come and go of itself,
let it conjoin and transform naturally.
Let thoughts be still, and the spirit undisturbed—
in two or three years, you will surely attain.

Now, in great compassion,
I explain this step by step.
You women—
do not cling to this wondrous secret.
Once clung to, it becomes an illness;
do not blame the Dao for deception.
Neither internally nor externally bound,
the spirit moves freely, *qi* transcends.
Roaming with thoughts clear and bright,
the heart remains pure and radiant.
Why be constrained in coming and going?
The moon in the high sky may wax and wane.

---

Life’s desires are seldom fulfilled—
only at the end does one know red from black.
In this age of thin *qi* and frail virtue,
heed not the words of others.
Each cultivates their own nature and form;
immortals and mortals are distinct.
Immortals arise from immortal roots,
mortals bear the karma of past lives.
Though one may enjoy wealth and rank in this life,
the body’s decay is fearful to behold.
Without good deeds to one’s credit,
sins are recorded in the Black Ledger.
A lifetime without merit to offset them—
silver and gold slip through empty hands.
Only sins remain, a body bent in dust,
knees bloodied in the mire.
Condemned to the Great Hell,
in the next life one is reborn deaf and blind.

Here lies the divide between immortal and mortal—
yet cultivation holds further truths.
Even if one fails to reach the highest rank,
immortals and buddhas may intercede in calamity.
Cultivate one’s nature in the inner chambers,
and when merit is complete, ascend to the celestial palace.
When the elixir of true cultivation is full,
a divine decree descends with an immortal’s writ.
Golden youths bear jeweled banners,
jade flutes resound through heaven and earth.
They welcome you to the Land of Ultimate Bliss,
to enjoy boundless kalpas.
No longer entering the wheel of rebirth,
neither born nor extinguished,
neither dying nor aging—
a guest inscribed on the roster of eternal life.
Now drifting with mist and clouds,
now resting in phoenix pavilions,
now roaming the ends of the sky,
now wandering isles in the sea,
beholding endless vistas of golden splendor,
gazing upon inexhaustible hues of lapis lazuli.
This is the great joy of merit perfected,
the supreme secret of returning to the root through cultivation!

**Women’s Alchemical Secrets**
*By Pu Yang’s Unhearted Master Chen Yongqing*

**The Secret of Refining Form in the Great Yin**

Women’s cultivation of the true holds its own secrets,
not idle speculations spun from thin air.
The human body inherently possesses yin and yang—
the principles of yin and yang demand repeated reflection.
A man’s essence is yang within yin,
a woman’s essence is yin within yang.
Seek a wise teacher without delay to shatter the mystery,
and return to youth in the homeland of the origin.

In stillness, cultivate the true without doubt,
awaiting the arrival of the one yang within the body.
Return to the realm of the primordial,
and plant the golden crow in the moon.
Who devised this method of true cultivation,
drawing noblewomen to shave their heads?
Day after day, they guard empty chambers,
hearts as dead as ash, wielding the blade of life and death.
Alas, the Red Dragon, that demonic force,
endlessly encircling the sun and moon.
Place the dragon’s head upon the executioner’s block,
sever it before dawn breaks.
Clasp the gate tightly with both hands,
lest the Yellow Tiger slip past the wall.
To lead him home is no difficult task—
quickly set him ablaze.
Mount the crane and count the breaths,
the cold sound of jade dew like fragrant milk.
Gently guide it past the Purple Tenuity Palace,
suffusing the body with softness until noon.
Temper the civil and martial fires with care,
lest the mind become cluttered and chaotic.
Ever vigilant, guard against the true seed’s escape—
draw it back to the breasts to form the sacred embryo.
Once the sacred embryo gathers in the breasts,
longevity rivals heaven’s, boundless and immeasurable.
Thus concludes the cultivation of the true in this life—
within seven days, yang is reborn.
If the celestial heart revives in seven days,
this is the sublime marvel of the highest vehicle.
Henceforth, the practice aligns with that of men—
each oral instruction must come from the teacher.

**The Secret of Threefold Severing of the Red Dragon**

Women who cultivate the true are bold indeed,
raising the blade to sever the Red Dragon.
Defying husbands and rebelling against mothers, hearts filled with venom—
all for the rare chance to transform this human form.
Strike with all one’s strength,
lest the vital essence leak outward.
Reverse the flow of the Yellow River,
yin wanes as yang waxes, governed by breath.
Breath is but a furnace’s fire,
the yellow sprout simmered in the cauldron.
Warm vapors rise to the heavens,
then descend the tower to the earthen crucible.
A broken bamboo must be mended with bamboo—
do not boil cinnabar and mercury with silver and lead.
Take only those of the same kind to engender one another,
swiftly gather them into the two breasts.
Seizing the mechanism of heaven and earth’s creation,
each person possesses a ladder to the heavens.
Yang’s rise and yin’s retreat hold no other secret—
only in thought free from delusion.
Free from delusion, one has resolve,
wielding the merciless sword in the dark.
Sever the Red Dragon two or three times,
then a noblewoman’s skill is revealed.
When skill is high, so too is the dharma’s power—
gathering the phoenix without duality, soaring with the clouds.
Though all are women in skirts,
who says their names cannot be inscribed among the immortals?
Let the resolve of women in skirts stand firm as a mountain,
planting flowers in fire to bloom white lotuses.
Cultivate a heart of compassion,
and one may ascend to immortality from level ground.

Only a single grain of golden elixir,
radiant day after day.
Its form like a millet seed, sweet as honey,
its power to revive the dead and restore life is doubled.
Alas, people remain unaware of the golden elixir—
even spirits and gods may not fathom it.
Its wondrous illusion requires a teacher’s transmission—
yet it is but a remedy from one’s own garden.

**Women’s Secrets of Cultivating the True**

Noblewomen study meditation day by day,
silent and speechless, their hearts devoted.
If even a trace of selfish desire arises,
the true lead will flee the furnace.
True lead is the medicine of the primordial—
why do people fail to grasp it?
Guard the gate with care,
lest it steal away from the chamber.
If it escapes, do not fear—
raise a tempest of wind and fire.
Drive it straight to the ninefold heavens,
seizing heaven and earth to hang upon the breasts.
Without steadfast integrity, do not transmit the Dao,
lest foolish passions invite mockery.
To leak the mystery is unforgivable to heaven—
the sin is no small matter.
Do not teach the secret to those who lack understanding,
lest they babble to others in confusion.
Though I have exhorted you again and again,
do not treat the immortal’s way as mere trifle.

Women’s natures are wayward,
their hearts set only on ascending to the Jasper Terrace.
If you speak of this to others,
how could such learning befit a woman in skirts?
Women who study the Dao often bring shame,
heedlessly encountering packs of dogs.
Lured into secret rites with blind masters,
they check their navels to verify their progress.
Better to sit steadfast in the incense chamber,
honoring parents-in-law and obeying husbands.
After death, the soul returns to the Pure Land,
where the Buddha of the West calls your name.

I urge women to abandon the study of the Dao—
amidst the Dao, false paths disrupt the true one.

Cultivate a heart of loyalty, kindness, and benevolence—
what matter if the Way be false or true?
Even if the true Way requires no seeking,
the fire of desire arises unbidden, unrestrained.
Young in years yet already disgraced—
do you know shame or not?

*Essential Teachings on the Female Elixir*
*Transmitted by the Pure Yang Ancestor Lü*
*Respectfully recorded by the disciple Fu Jinquan*

The Three Flowers of essence and qi never wane,
the Purple Qi of the Clear Void follows established rules.
The Nine Revolutions of the Golden Elixir are refined by the Primordial Lady,
and longevity resembles the Yellow Peace turtle seated upon its treasure.

As for the text *"Purple Qi of the Clear Void,"* it was bestowed by the Primordial Lady.
When asked how long the Yellow Peace turtle remains seated, the answer was:
"This turtle fears the light of sun and moon, emerging but once every thirty years.
I have sat upon this turtle and witnessed three emergences."

You fail to understand that the old yang has no birth or cessation.
Let me offer a comparison:
"Like the crescent moon on the third day, by the fifth or sixth it remains full."
Women’s cultivation is the same as men’s—
what is difficult is maintaining purity.
Know that women’s desires exceed those of men.
Once the menstrual flow has ceased,
the heart is like a lotus just opening,
and only with heaven’s rain and dew does it bear fruit.
A woman without a man is solitary yin—
solitary yin does not give birth to the lotus.
Without receiving the grace of rain and dew,
even fertile soil will be of no use.
Heaven’s rain and dew exist to bring forth the myriad things—
can this act be in vain?
If the myriad things do not receive rain and dew,
then solitary yang cannot grow.

The Way can be verified through things,
and understood through affairs.
Even in shallow discourse, profound principles are present—
it is only that people do not reflect and comprehend them.

Women may employ the method of massage:
Upon rising in the morning, sit in stillness for a moment.
Press the heart firmly with the right hand,
while the left hand strokes the abdomen and navel twenty times.
Then stroke down to the waist, kneading and patting once.
Reverse the hands—left hand pressing the heart, right hand stroking,
then right hand pressing the heart, left hand stroking.
After kneading and patting the waist with both hands,
rub the hands until warm and smooth the face.
Massage the ears, pressing and flicking them,
then knead the shoulders, pinch them,
swallow the generated saliva,
stretch the waist, stand, and rub the hands together.
Walk a few steps before attending to external matters.
Perform this again in the evening before taking the pills.

**Pill Formula:**
- *Polygonum multiflorum* (prepared) – 2 kernels
- Walnuts – 3
- *Ophiopogon japonicus* – 1 *liang*
- *Rehmannia glutinosa* (prepared) – 2.5 *liang*
- *Psoralea corylifolia* – 6 *fen*
- *Amomum villosum* – 3 *fen*
- *Eucommia ulmoides* – 8 *fen*
- *Asparagus cochinchinensis* – 1 *liang*
- Fresh ginger – 3 *fen*

Grind the eight ingredients into a fine powder,
then mix with half a *jin* of lard (for those who eat meat, use lard;
for vegetarians, use human milk, cow’s milk, or goat’s milk—
milk is *su*, not meat. In the northwest, this is called "milk tea,"
which strengthens the spirit, nourishes the complexion,
blackens the hair, and extends life.
The Buddha consumed it during his ascetic practice on Snow Mountain,
which is why it is not forbidden in Buddhist monasteries.
If using imitation *su* oil, it is often sheep’s fat—
better to use human milk).
Form into pills and take for one month.
The spirit will grow strong, the hair black, and life extended—
no other medicine compares.

On the days of *yin*, *wu*, *shen*, and *hai* each month,
take three *fen* of the medicine with a bowl of water.
At dawn, face east, inhale the fresh qi three times, and swallow.
Recite:
*"The light of the rising sun is rooted in true yang.
I absorb the proper qi of the eastern direction,
refining it into the jade liquid of nectar.
The Golden Essence of Taiyi penetrates the crown,
the Li Palace forges pure hardness.
The two qi transform the northern direction,
and the robust body resides within."*

Press the palms together and stretch seven times.
With a finger, write:
*"Supreme Divine Numinous Highest Longevity Eternal Life Heavenly Worthy"*
in the bowl of water.
After swallowing the pill, face west, inhale once, and swallow.
Then proceed with daily affairs.
Guard against carelessly transmitting this to the unworthy.
Once the Great Elixir is accomplished, prepare and take the medicine again.

**Female True Elixir**
*Excerpted from* The Secret Manual of Nourishing the True *by the Realized One of the Elixir Pavilion, Ancestor Lu*
*Recorded by Fu Shan of Taiyuan*

The Realized One said:
In the cultivation of the female true elixir, there is also the method of closing the menstrual blood.
This method was transmitted from our ancestor, the Primordial Lady of Silence,
to the Primordial Lady of Wei,
who passed it to Yellow Flower Maiden,
who then transmitted it to Maid Ma,
who gave it to Maiden Qi—
this formed one lineage.
Ancestor Lü transmitted it to Immortal He,
who taught Wang Chongyang,
who initiated Sun the Immortal Maiden,
who then taught Zhang the True Slave—
this formed another lineage.
The Realized One of the Straw Cloak transmitted it to Golden Lotus Woman.
All first closed the menses.

Though male essence and female blood are dregs,
the qi of the prior heaven is entirely concealed within them.
If the posterior heaven is discharged,
then the prior heaven is also discharged—
hence the closing of this pathway.

The *Vast Principles of Nourishing Life* asks:
"May I inquire about the method of closing the menses?"

The Realized One said:
For female cultivators, first practice breath-counting and seated meditation as before.
Once the qi in the body is circulating smoothly,
begin the practice one day before the menstrual period at the *zi* or *wu* hour.
At midnight, put on clothes, sit cross-legged,
clench the fists, and embrace the ribs.
Wait until the qi in the body rises and falls several times,
then use the left heel to press against the *yin* gate and anus.
Clench the teeth, strain the eyes, shrug the shoulders,
and exert force to lift,
visualizing two streams of red qi rising from the uterus,
passing through the coccyx, the Three Passes,
ascending to the Mud Pill Palace,
descending to the root of the tongue,
and pouring into the breasts.
Continue until the body grows warm before stopping.
Then insert a piece of white, soft silk into the *yin* gate
to observe whether the flow is more or less than the previous month.
Repeat the previous practice to disperse the blood and qi,
preventing illness.
Within a hundred days, it will naturally cease.
Note the day of the previous month’s onset—
for example, if it came on the first day,
wait until the third day to sever it once.
Sever it once in the second month,
and once more in the third month.
After no more than three months, it will stop.

First sever the tail in the first month,
sever the waist in the second,
sever the head in the third—
this is called "severing the Red Dragon."
Mark this well.

*Observations from Heart-Fasting Studio*
*Recorded Sayings of Lord Wenchang*

Only after the division of yin and yang
do male and female distinctions arise;
only through opening and closing, gathering and receiving
is the work of Qian and Kun established.
Endowed with constant inclinations and innate goodness,
they share the same qi to form their bodies.
The origins of human relationships begin
with the pairing that first transforms the source.

Heaven and Earth possess no solitary Way,
and how could creatures have a mechanism for solitary birth?
Thus, Fu Xi and King Wen expounded the hexagrams,
revealing the profound subtleties of the Six Children;
the Zhou dynasty laid its foundations,
greatly manifesting the refined transformation of the *Er Nan*.

The sagely teachings do not neglect the model for the inner chambers,
and true cultivation fundamentally relies on the primal power of Kun.
Yet as the root descends, the branches also diverge,
and falsehoods masquerade as truth while the proper becomes distorted.
The heart of chastity and integrity gradually declines,
and the steadfastness of the pine and cypress is rarely seen.
Great principles remain obscured,
and who recognizes the mysterious workings?

Though the Three Teachings offer awakening words,
through the ages few have specialized in this discourse.
To rouse and admonish—
this is my compassion;
to proclaim and propagate—
this is your duty.

According to the memorial requesting the exposition of the *Nü Jing*’s alchemical principles,
the sentiments and words were earnest and sincere,
sharing the same salvific intent.
The details were thorough,
rooted in the sincere quest for the hidden truth of the Red Dragon,
opening a bridge for the Way of women.

The tally matched,
initiating instruction for the unenlightened among women.
At an opportune time, it was to be disseminated,
and promptly forwarded for deliberation.
After consultation,
the transcendent script was inscribed,
a karmic affinity from past lives,
using this to awaken the common folk.
The Left Bureau planted the immortal bones
from former existences,
relying on this to propagate the great transformation,
undertaking this monumental task,
assisting Heaven’s work.

The Original Lady was commanded to select an auspicious day for expounding the scripture,
and the host of perfected ones were ordered to enact the teachings in due time.
The words were drawn from sincerity,
awakening the delusions of the world’s inner chambers;
the text was refined and pure,
establishing a model of maternal virtue for later generations.

The excellence of these fourteen chapters, perfected through countless kalpas of transcendence, is now specially decreed for dissemination—let this command be reverently received and never neglected.

From the *Recorded Sayings of Heavenly Lord Wang*:
Previously, upon Jin Zi’s memorial petitioning the Original Lady to determine whether the female disciple Lin Ying was suitable for instruction in cultivation, and whether those permitted to expound the scripture were appropriate, an imperial decree was issued ordering the local City God’s Bureau to examine Lin Ying’s karmic records from past and present lives and submit a memorial to the Imperial Lord. Now, according to the memorial received, it is found that Lin Ying’s past three lives originated as a scholar of the Ming dynasty’s Chenghua era in Weiyang, surnamed Wei, named Wenxi. Though upright in conduct and never entering officialdom, he indulged in ostentatious eloquence, weaving ornate falsehoods, mocking his peers, and disparaging esteemed predecessors. Moreover, he violated the precept against lust, and thus was punished in his second life by rebirth as a woman, placed in the monastic order to endure hardship. At that time, during the Tianqi era’s middle years, she was reborn in Wu, in the western village of Kunlun Mountain County, to the Cao family—this being her third life. Due to her vow of purity, during her monastic existence she maintained a resolute will, practicing austerities and revering the Most High. She encountered the female Dharma-teacher Dinghui of Zhongshan, who instructed her in the cultivation of mysterious arts and the contemplation of the Great Yin’s alchemical techniques for refining form. Regrettably, before mastering them, she lightly abandoned the world. That she now receives this karmic affinity is indeed rooted in the seeds sown three lives prior.

Further investigation reveals that though she is now a woman and still young, she bears no grave transgressions. The reason she suffers the retribution of a female rebirth is that the sin of ornate falsehood remains unresolved. All these details were memorialized and reported.

Additionally, according to the memorial from the Dharma-hall Inspector, Chunxiu is currently engaged in the Rite of the Dipper to beseech blessings and repent sins. The Original Lady is greatly pleased and has petitioned the Imperial Lord to bestow further transformation and deliverance. Once the Rite of the Dipper is complete, she is to submit a formal memorial to repent sins and seek grace. The Original Lady will select an auspicious time to descend and personally instruct her, awaiting the scripture’s exposition.

By the command of the Imperial Lord and the Original Lady, Jin Benzun, as Chunxiu’s preceptor in transmission, is to be questioned whether he can guarantee her unwavering devotion to the end. A clear memorial is to be submitted in response.

Though this karmic cause appears remote, by the Imperial Lord’s decree, the planchette’s sand is specially employed to reveal it: the retribution for ornate falsehood persists even after two lifetimes as a woman. Now, by virtue of her monastic cultivation in a past life, she has entered the Dharma assembly. If she can transmit the alchemical teachings with sincere and unshakable devotion, her past defilements will be entirely purified, and her immortal affinity may be fulfilled.

Let Chunxiu take heed of this! Be solemn!

The *Recorded Discourses of Lady Wanyun*

By the Imperial Lord’s decree of pardon, I have reviewed the memorial submitted by Jin Benzun, which states that the devout woman of refining brushwork, Lin Chunxiu, has firmly resolved to advance in cultivation with unwavering sincerity, her wisdom-nature clear and keen, making her fit for the office of transmission. Her petition, both in its earlier and later submissions, has been fully reported to the commanding generals for response. Now, I am specially commanded to personally instruct her at the altar of our Lin lineage, guiding her to lucid awakening. Once her brush attains penetrating insight, she may serve as my proxy in expounding the subtleties of the Dao.

Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, take different forms yet function in mutual dependence. The male, modeled on *qian*, embodies firmness and strength, his form established in vigor, his *qi* received as purity. The female, modeled on *kun*, embodies steadfastness and softness, her form established in yielding, her *qi* received as turbidity. Purity is light, turbidity is heavy; the light and pure image Heaven, the heavy and turbid image Earth. Yet Heaven, though yang, contains yin within—embodying Earth’s response above; Earth, though yin, contains yang within—embodying Heaven’s union below. Thus the Two Modes arise from the Supreme Ultimate, and yin and yang reside in male and female.

Know this: Heaven’s body is non-action, pure emptiness, lofty and distant. Though it steams clouds and rains moisture to nourish the earth below, it cannot itself gestate, nurture, or sustain the ten thousand beings. Therefore, for men, the work of cultivating the Real is arduous. As for women, likened to Earth—though they bear mountains and receive rivers, congealing in thickness and weight—yet the hundred grasses and myriad things sprout in due season. By reversing the usual course, they may raise yang *qi* at the Spring Equinox and emit harmonious radiance at the Winter Solstice. This is analogous to the mechanism of female gestation, sharing in the same ceaseless generative wonder. Thus, for women, the cultivation of the Real is far simpler than for men.

In sum, the worldly are beset by desires, and so they distance themselves from the Dao. The perfected are free of desire, and so they attain the Dao. Regardless of gender, those who know that reducing desire leads to the Dao may enter it. For without desire, one is pure; pure, one is still; still, one is luminous; luminous, one abides in profound tranquility and constant reality, the thusness of the original body, universally aware and illumined. The pearl of wisdom-nature in the ocean of consciousness shines forth—how could this be merely a marvel wrought at the tip of a brush?

I pity the women of the world, who deem themselves base and defiled, sunk in delusion and degradation. For many years, I have wished to expound the alchemical scriptures to deliver them from suffering, and have spoken of this often with Jin Benzun. Now, Lin Chunxiu’s karmic roots are keen, and to have attained a human rebirth three times is already rare. Though she bears past defilements, they may be repented and cleansed. Having now received this instruction, she should diligently engage in contemplative study, purify her heart, reduce desires, and devote herself with utmost sincerity. Not only may she then propagate my esoteric texts for the salvation of the world, but she may also enjoy blessings, bear worthy descendants, and, having fulfilled this karmic female form, follow me in carefree wandering through the celestial palaces.

Strive on! Be solemn!
