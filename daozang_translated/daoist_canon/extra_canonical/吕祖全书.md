**Volume 1: The Original Biography of Patriarch Lü**

*Preface to the Original Biography in The Complete Works of Patriarch Lü*

Patriarch Lü, in response to the Supreme Yang Emperor, declared, "Only when all sentient beings are delivered shall I ascend." Yet even after his ascension, he continued to transform and deliver the world. Thus, from the Tang dynasty to the present, his manifestations and transformations have been myriad. The world calls him "Immortal Lü," while he refers to himself as "The Returning Daoist" or "Lord of the Supreme Palace." Having ultimately realized the rank of Supreme Sage and Teacher, his numinous traces are too numerous to record in full.

This biography follows the original account in sequence, with occasional additions and annotations for reference.

As for the divergent accounts in circulation: some claim he was originally of the Tang imperial clan, surnamed Li, and named either *Huan* or *Qiong*, entering the mountains with his wife to cultivate together and changing his surname to Lü; others say he passed the imperial examinations and became a magistrate, or that he failed the examinations; some assert that at sixty-four he traveled to Chang’an and encountered the Supreme Yang Emperor, while others claim he ascended at sixty-four to pay homage to the Jade Emperor of Primordial Beginning; some hold that he was born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, others on the fourth day of the eighth month. As for the year of his birth, some say it was during the *Zhen’guan* era, others the *Tianbao* or *Zhenyuan* eras—such variations abound.

Patriarch Lü once remarked, "Call me an ox, and I respond as an ox; call me a horse, and I respond as a horse. The world’s errors may be true or false—what did I have to do with anything before the Tang?" His words were truly enlightened.

When the Most High descended to be born, he took Li as his surname; when the snow-clad mountain first bore him, he emerged from a *qi*-womb. Dragons coiled around the chamber, and the five stars shone in the courtyard—such divine portents were precise and unerring. The births of immortals, buddhas, sages, and worthies have always been extraordinary. How, then, could I presume to fathom Patriarch Lü?

*Eulogy*

The greatest divine power
Lies in loyalty and filial piety;
Benefiting self and others—
The grand Dao of a thousand autumns.

From ancient times to the present,
Karmic conditions are not trifling;
Freely brushed onto the page,
A portrait before one’s eyes.

Again—
A sword slashes through autumn,
Pure wind fills both sleeves;
The Dao resides in the Three-in-One,
The elixir perfected, cycling through the Nine.

Cangwu and the Northern Sea,
The imperial homeland of white clouds;
A single drop from the Gan River—
Its source distant, its flow long.

*The Original Biography of Patriarch Lü*
*(Collated from the *Complete Writings on the Dao*, *Marvelous Traces of Immortals and Buddhas*, *Comprehensive Mirror of Divine Immortals*, and *Complete Tang Poems*. Discrepancies are annotated beneath the text for reference.)*

Patriarch Lü’s personal name was Yan, his courtesy name Dongbin. His family had long been natives of Yongle County, Hezhong Prefecture. His great-grandfather, Yanzhi, served the Tang as Military Commissioner of Hedong; his grandfather, Wei, ended his career as Vice Minister of Rites; his father, Rang, was Prefect of Haizhou.

Born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the fourteenth year of the Zhenyuan era (at the *si* hour), his mother, as she lay in childbed, was enveloped in a strange fragrance, while celestial music drifted through the air. A white crane descended from the heavens and vanished into the bed curtains. At birth, his form was golden, his essence wooden—crane’s crown, tortoise’s back, tiger’s body, dragon’s jowls, kingfisher brows, phoenix eyes, a long neck with prominent cheekbones, a broad forehead and rounded frame, a straight and towering nose bridge, a face of pale yellow hue. A black mole marked the corner of his left brow, another beneath his left eye. His head was large, his feet bore hidden patterns like tortoise-shell creases.

From childhood, he was keen and quick-witted, memorizing ten thousand words a day and composing essays extemporaneously. In adulthood, he stood five *chi* and two *cun* tall, fond of wearing a Huayang cap, a pale yellow *lan* robe, and a black sash, his bearing reminiscent of Zhang Zifang.

At twenty, he remained unmarried, still in swaddling clothes. Master Ma saw him and remarked, *"This child’s bone structure is extraordinary—naturally a figure beyond the dust of the world. When you encounter a hut, dwell there; when you see a bell, strike it. Keep this in mind."* Later, all came to pass as foretold.

He later traveled to Mount Lu, where he met the Fire Dragon Perfected and received the *Celestial Concealment Sword Technique*. Thereafter, he wandered the world selling ink among the common folk, styling himself *Master Pure Yang*.

During the Xiantong era, he passed the imperial examinations at the age of sixty-four. Later, while visiting a wineshop in Chang’an, he saw a Daoist—green turban, white robe, long whiskers, and bright eyes—carrying a purple bamboo staff and a large gourd at his waist. The Daoist inscribed three quatrains on the wall:

*Seated or reclining, I always carry a jug of wine,
Lest my eyes ever recognize the imperial capital.
Vast as heaven and earth, yet nameless—
A carefree man of the world, a true husband.*

*True immortals who have attained the Dao are not easily met;
When shall I return? I wish you would follow.
I say my dwelling adjoins the azure sea—
It is the first peak of Penglai, apart from all.*

*Do not weary of chasing joy and laughter,
For pondering separation and chaos grieves the spirit.
Leisurely, I count on my fingers—
How many have known true peace in this world?*

Struck by the Daoist’s archaic and extraordinary appearance and the soaring spirit of his verses, Patriarch Lü bowed and inquired after his name. The Daoist replied, *"My compound surname is Zhongli, my given name Quan, my courtesy name Yunfang."* Patriarch Lü bowed again and invited him to sit.

Zhong said, *"Might you recite a quatrain? I would fain observe it."* Patriarch Lü thereupon presented a quatrain:

*Born to the Confucian path in times of peace—
The weight of office hangs heavy, while coarse cloth feels light.
Who in this world would vie for fame and gain?
I serve the Jade Emperor, returning to the Upper Clarity.*

Zhongli beheld the poem and rejoiced inwardly. They then rested together in a tavern. Zhongli himself rose to tend the stove, while Patriarch Lü, overcome by weariness, pillowed his head upon the table and dozed. In his dream, he journeyed to the capital as an examination candidate, passed the imperial exams, and began his career in local posts before ascending to the ranks of ministerial secretary, remonstrator, academician, and custodian of the imperial archives—every eminent office he traversed in turn. Promoted, then demoted; demoted, then promoted again. Two wives, daughters of wealthy families, were wed in his youth; sons and grandsons flourished, the household brimming with capped and gowned officials. For nearly forty years he served, then a decade more as sole minister, his power and influence scorching all. Suddenly, he was charged with grave crimes: his family’s wealth confiscated, his wives and children scattered, himself exiled to the southern frontier, left alone, destitute, and gaunt. As he stood astride his horse amid wind and snow, a deep sigh arose—

Then, in a start, he awoke. Zhongli was beside him, the millet still uncooked, and laughed, saying:
*"The millet is not yet done—
A dream has carried you to the land of Hua Xu."*

Patriarch Lü exclaimed, *"Master, did you know my dream?"*
Zhong replied, *"The dream you just dreamed—its rises and falls, its countless glories and sorrows—all spanned fifty years in but a moment. What is there to rejoice in gain, or grieve in loss? Only when one awakens to the Great Dao does one realize this world is but a vast dream."*

Patriarch Lü, moved to sudden enlightenment, understood that the path of officialdom was not worth clinging to. He bowed again and said, *"Master, you are no ordinary man. I beg you to teach me the art of transcending the world."*

Zhong declined, saying: *"Your bones are not yet whole, your will and conduct not yet settled. If you seek to transcend the world, you must pass through several more lifetimes."* With that, he departed in a flutter.

Patriarch Lü, disheartened and lost, resigned his office and withdrew into seclusion. Thereafter, Zhongli tested Patriarch Lü ten times:

1. One day, returning from outside, he saw that all his family had fallen ill and died. His heart held no grief—he simply prepared coffins with care. Soon after, the dead all revived.

2. Once, selling goods in the market, he agreed on a price. The buyer suddenly paid only half, yet he made no dispute. He did not even take the half, but left the goods behind and departed.

3. On New Year’s Day, a beggar leaned against his door, seeking alms. He gave money and goods. The beggar demanded more, hurling abuse. He bowed again and again in apology, until the beggar laughed and left.

4. Herding sheep in the mountains, he encountered a tiger chasing the flock. He pushed the sheep down a steep slope and stood alone before the beast. The tiger then turned and left.

5. Alone in a thatched hut in the mountains, reading, a girl of seventeen or eighteen appeared—her radiance dazzling, her adornments and voice pure and lovely. She claimed to be returning to her mother’s home, weary from travel, and asked to rest a while. Soon, she began to tease and entice him in every way, pressing him to share her bed through the night. Yet he remained unmoved.

6. One day, traveling in the countryside, he returned to find his household possessions plundered by bandits, leaving almost nothing for his daily needs.

He showed no sign of resentment, supporting himself by tilling the soil. One day, while hoeing, he uncovered several dozen cakes of gold. He quickly covered them again and took not a single piece.

7. Once, in the marketplace, he purchased several copper vessels and took them home, only to find they had turned to gold. He immediately sought out the owner and returned them.

8. A mad Daoist priest wandered the streets selling medicine, proclaiming, “Whoever takes this will die at once, but in the next life will attain the Dao.” After ten days with no buyers, he bought the medicine himself and consumed it without ill effect.

9. In spring, floodwaters surged, and his small boat was swept into the current. Waves tossed and churned, yet he sat unmoving, and in the end, he came to no harm.

10. One day, sitting alone in his room, he suddenly saw countless grotesque spirits and demons: some sought to strike him, others to kill him, yet he felt no fear. Then, several dozen night specters appeared, dragging a prisoner in shackles, blood and flesh dripping, wailing and shrieking, “You killed me in a past life—repay my life at once!” He replied, “A life for a life—what objection could there be?” He immediately seized a knife and rope to end his own life. Suddenly, a rebuke rang out from the void, and all the ghosts and spirits vanished. A man descended, clapping his hands—it was Ancestor Zhong. He said, “The dust of the world is hard to extinguish, and those with immortal potential are rare. My search for a worthy one surpasses even their search for me! Ten times I tested you, and you remained unmoved—you are certain to attain the Dao! Yet your merit and conduct are not yet complete. I will teach you the secret arts of alchemy, that you may aid the world and benefit all things. When your three thousand merits are fulfilled and your eight hundred deeds perfected, I will come to deliver you.” He asked, “In the work of metal transmutation, will there be any anomalies?”

The Ancestor replied, “After three thousand years, it shall return to its original essence.” Lü Zu’s voice grew somber as he said, “To mislead people for three thousand years—I would rather not.” Zhong laughed and said, “With such a heart as yours, the three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are already fulfilled in this! This test alone suffices.”

He then recounted to him the history of his renunciation of the world and attainment of the Dao, adding, “The inscription of Master Ku Zhu said: ‘When you journey among men, you will meet one with two mouths—he shall be your disciple.’ I have roamed mountains and seas, yet never encountered a man with two mouths! Now, examining your surname, it truly matches the record of Ku Zhu. I dwell on Crane Ridge in Zhongnan—would you follow me there?”

Lü thus accompanied him. Beneath the radiance of stars and moon, all was still and desolate. Zhong took Lü’s hand as they walked, and after just a few steps, it seemed as though they rode swift horses, crossing mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at the southern cave, where the gate was locked. Zhong struck Lü’s belt with a jade tablet, and together they slipped through the crevice—suddenly, all was bright and vast. Ascending a high peak, they reached the eastern gate of the great cave, where two tigers crouched in guard. Zhong rebuked them, and the tigers lay still, allowing them to enter. There were golden towers and jade terraces, rare birds and jasper trees, their radiance dazzling, the climate like spring.

They sat upon a serpentine stone, drinking three cups of *yuanhe* wine. Soon, a maiden in green appeared—her double buns adorned with golden bells, crimson robes and kingfisher sleeves, cloud-patterned shoes and jade pendants—exotic fragrance curling about her. She bore a jade seal and golden-scripted paper, saying, “The assembly of immortals has gathered in the Upper Palace of Penglai. They urgently summon you to the Heavenly Pond Assembly to discuss the *Divine Travels of the Five Primordial Lords*.”

As Zhong Ancestor prepared to depart, Lü Ancestor, fearing he might not return, composed a poem to send him off:

“To meet one of lofty Dao is rare indeed—
Yet now you journey east to grace the immortal altar.
A staff tipped with spring’s hue, a gourd of wine,
A crown of five-hued clouds piled high upon your head.
The sea-turtle’s child drinks deep, unknown to men,
The mountain-burning talisman eludes the gaze of ghosts.
When you depart, this body must wither with age—
I beg you, grant this poor scholar the Elixir of Bone-Transformation.”

Zhong replied, “Simply remain here; I shall not be gone long.” Then, facing southeast, he rode upon a cloud of purple and departed.

Lü Ancestor took up the plain silk scroll that had accompanied him, unfolding it to read and recite with delight. Ten days later, Zhong returned and asked, “You have dwelt in this solitude—do you not long for home?”

Lü answered, “Having resolved my heart to study the Dao, how could I yearn for the mountains of home?”

Zhong said, “Excellent! You do not yet grasp the subtleties of yin-yang convergence and separation. To abide in yin is merely to be *po*; to preserve yang is merely to be *hun*. If one can gather *hun* and unite *po*, merging yin and yang so that *hun* and *po* become one in truth, this is called a *zhenren*.”

Lü said, “*Hun* and *po* dwell in darkness—how profound the principle! How may their full measure be attained?”

Zhong replied, “When wisdom arises from the unseen and the spirit settles in perfect stillness…”

When the spirit has merged into unity, does it not then align with the true? The golden form and jadelike essence arise from utmost sincerity. Once the Great Elixir is perfected, the body becomes light as if to take flight.

Lü then asked about "Heaven and Earth." Zhong replied, "When Qian’s three lines seek union, Heaven conjoins with Earth, giving rise to the three yang; when Kun’s three lines seek union, Earth conjoins with Heaven, giving rise to the three yin. Within yang, yin is concealed—this is called *true yin*. When true yin ascends to Heaven, it is born through yang. Within yin, yang is concealed—this is called *true yang*. When true yang descends to Earth, it emerges through yin. Through their union and harmony, the Dao is attained, and longevity naturally endures."

Lü asked about "the Sun and Moon." Zhong said, "The moon receives the sun’s *hun*, transforming yang into yin. When yin reaches its extreme, yang becomes pure, and the moon’s radiance shines with crystalline clarity. Cultivating to this stage, accumulated *qi* refines into spirit."

Lü asked about "the Four Seasons and Five Phases." Zhong replied, "Within a single heart, the Five Phases reside; within a single day, the Four Seasons unfold. In essence, it is merely the interplay of yin and yang. Yang cannot complete itself without yin, yet in the end, there is no yin that does not die; yin cannot generate itself without yang, yet in the end, yin is exhausted and all becomes yang." The doctrines of the eight grades of scripture are fundamentally rooted in this.

Lü further asked about "Water, Fire, Dragon, and Tiger." Zhong said, "Within the body, there are sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire. True fire emerges from water—dim and indistinct, yet within it lies something. Though unseen to the eye and unattainable by grasp, it is there. True water arises from fire—profound and obscure, yet within it lies essence. Though glimpsed, it cannot be detained; though detained, it cannot be held.

The kidneys are water. Within water resides *qi*, called *true fire*. The heart is fire. Within fire, fluid is born, called *true water*. This is the meaning of 'the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger is born at water’s edge.'

As water generates wood: when kidney *qi* is abundant, liver *qi* arises, cutting off the kidney’s residual yin. As *qi* passes through the liver, it becomes pure yang, storing the water of the true One—dim and indistinct, it is called the *true dragon*. As fire tempers metal: when heart fluid is plentiful, lung fluid is born, cutting off the heart’s residual yang. As fluid reaches the lungs, it becomes pure yin, storing the *qi* of true yang—profound and obscure, it is called the *true tiger*.

Drawing water from *qi* and *qi* from water, one obtains the *grain of millet*, returning it to the Yellow Court—this is the *Great Elixir*."

Someone asks about "lead and mercury." The master replies: "Lead’s nature is heavy and fond of sinking—this is kidney water, which moistens downward and readily fills. Mercury’s nature is light and fond of rising—this is heart fire, which flames upward and readily scatters. Using lead to restrain mercury, employing heaviness to anchor the light and flighty, the inner elixir coalesces!"

Another asks about "withdrawal and augmentation." The master replies: "After the winter solstice, yang ascends from the earth, and the earth withdraws its yin: *Greater Yin* withdraws to become *Terminal Yin*; *Lesser Yang* augments to become *Yang Brightness*. *Terminal Yin* withdraws to become *Lesser Yin*; *Yang Brightness* augments to become *Greater Yang*. After the summer solstice, yin descends from heaven, and heaven withdraws its yang: *Greater Yang* withdraws to become *Yang Brightness*; *Lesser Yin* augments to become *Terminal Yin*. *Yang Brightness* withdraws to become *Lesser Yang*; *Terminal Yin* augments to become *Greater Yin*.

Moreover, consider the sun and moon: the moon receives the sun’s *hun*-soul; the sun receives the moon’s *po*-corporeal soul. In the first fifteen days, the moon withdraws its *po* while the sun augments its *hun*—essence and brilliance fill, and light illumines the earth below. Without this, there would be no crescent waxing to first quarter, nor first quarter waxing to full moon. The moon restores its yin *po*; the sun gathers its yang essence. In the latter fifteen days, the sun withdraws its *hun* while the moon augments its *po*—light fades, and yin *po* settles. Without this, there would be no full moon waning to last quarter, nor last quarter waning to darkness. As sun and moon cycle endlessly, the nine and six transform—this is the image of withdrawal and augmentation."

Another asks about the "River Chariot."

He replied: "In the human body, yang is scant while yin abounds—all is but water, hence the recourse to the *River Chariot*. The *River Chariot* arises from the true water of the northern quarter, not through the forced transmutations of heterodox schools."

Asked about the wonders of "inner contemplation and sitting-in-forgetfulness," he said: "When dragon and tiger conjoin, yin and yang pair as mates. The Nine August Perfected Lords descend, leading a vermilion-robed youth; the Nine August Perfected Ladies ascend, leading a black-clad maiden. They meet before the Yellow Palace, where a yellow-robed crone receives them with a rising inflection, as husband and wife unite in joyous consummation. When the union is complete, the woman descends again, the man ascends, as husband and wife part. Once done, a thing is born, round as a pellet, its hue like red citrus. It is cast into the Yellow Palace and preserved in a golden vessel."

Asked, "Does such cultivation invite demonic trials?" he answered: "Do you know the ten demons and nine trials? Pressing needs of clothing and food—first trial. Entanglements of affection and love—second trial. Snares of profit and fame—third trial. Sudden calamities—fourth trial. Blind teachers and misguided precepts—fifth trial. Conflicting doctrines—sixth trial. Wavering resolve—seventh trial. Wasted years—eighth trial. Turmoil and chaos—ninth trial. The six thieves: first, the demon of wealth and rank; second, the demon of riches and honor; third, the demon of the six passions; fourth, the demon of love and attachment; fifth, the demon of hardship; sixth, when gods and buddhas become harmful—this is the demon of sages and worthies. Seventh, the demon of blades and warfare; eighth, the demon of music and women; ninth, the demon of feminine allure; tenth, the demon of goods and gain."

Further asked, "How may one verify attainment?" he replied: "At first, deviant influences are wholly extirpated, and external conduct is cultivated alongside internal practice. When gathering the medicine, the golden essence fills to abundance, and the yin *po* melts away. Next, the *Heart Sutra* wells forth, and sweet nectar flows from the mouth. Then, yin and yang clash and grapple, the belly roars like thunder. Then, as *hun* and *po* remain unsettled, dreams and sleep are fraught with terror. Then, minor illnesses arise but heal without treatment. Then, the cinnabar field grows warm at night, and the countenance is clear by day. Then, in darkness, one’s spirit-light appears of itself. Then, one embraces the infant and ascends the golden tower. Then, a thunderclap resounds, the joints open, and startled sweat pours forth. Then, the jade liquid is refined into congealed butter, and snow-like essence scatters down. Or blood transforms into milk, and one gradually shuns the rank and foul. Or the dusty bones grow light and turn to gold and jade. Then, one’s gait is swift as a galloping horse. Then, one is unmoved by external scenes. Then, one’s breath can cure illness. Then, inner vision grows luminous. Then, both eyes gleam like lacquer. Then, black hair regrows. Then, true *qi* suffices, and one is ever sated. Then, one eats little but can drink wine without limit. Then, the spirit-body glows, and essence and *qi* are radiant. Then, the mouth savors strange flavors, and the nose detects rare fragrances. Then, the eyes see for ten thousand *li*. Then, scars vanish. Then, tears, saliva, and sweat all cease. Then, the three corpses and nine worms are wholly expelled. Then, the inner will is lofty, harmonizing with the Great Void; worldly passions fade, and both mind and realm become empty. Then, *hun* and *po* no longer wander, and dreams end of themselves; spirit and essence are fresh, undivided by day or night. Then, the yang essence forms the body, and the numinous palace is fortified—cold and heat cannot assail, life and death cannot touch. Then, a sigh can dry external mercury. Then, spirit-light constantly arises whether sitting or lying. Then, in stillness, one hears celestial music—gold, stone, strings, and bamboo—sounds not of this world. Then, in inner vision, one may wander Hua Xu, where towers and halls gleam with splendor unseen in the mortal realm. Then, one perceives the foulness of ordinary people. Then, one’s inner gods manifest. Then, external gods come to pay homage. When merit is complete and conduct perfected, one receives registers and charts. Purple auroras fill the eyes, golden light envelops the body. One may see fire-dragons soar or phoenix-cranes dance, colorful clouds swirling, auspicious vapors in profusion. Heavenly flowers rain down, divine maidens descend. One leaves the mundane and enters sagehood, carefree and natural. This is the day when the great man’s merit is accomplished and his name established."

Hearing the esoteric formulas of the Perfected Ones from Zhongli in full, Patriarch Lü comprehended each in turn. Presently, a knock sounded at the door; rising to see, he beheld Qingxi’s Zheng Siyuan, along with the two Perfected Ones, Shi Hufu of Taihua, arriving from the southeast. They strode unhurried through the void, their forms suffused with golden and azure radiance, and after exchanging bows, sat together. They said, “We have just offered congratulations to Yin Siyi for his elixir’s completion and have come to call at your immortal gate.”

Shi asked, “Who is this attendant?”
Zhongli replied, “The son of Lü Rang of Haizhou in our dynasty. In youth, he studied the Confucian and Mohist arts but met with frustration in the capital. By chance, he encountered me in a Chang’an wineshop and followed me into the Dao, mastering the subtleties of yin-yang, refining form and spirit, and entering the wondrous.”

Zhongli then bade him bow to the two immortals. Zheng and Shi said, “Your form is pure, your spirit present; your eyes are bright, your essence concealed. If you seek to cast off the dusty net, may we see a poem?” They presented him with a golden brush, rosy stationery, divine glue, and a rhinoceros-horn inkstone.

He immediately offered this poem:
*"Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives to this life,
Only now does this life’s body begin to sense its weightlessness.
Leaving home, parting from kin, casting off the clouds and mountains of the realm,
Refining po and hun with the essence of sun and moon.
I have seen the Perfected discuss the Nine Cauldrons—
Seeking the great elixir, I inquire of the Three Clarities.
Now that I meet the true immortals face-to-face,
My name is recorded at the gates of the Purple Palace."*

The two immortals sighed at his talent and elegant lines, each bestowing their secret teachings before departing. At that moment, spring birds trilled as Ancestor Zhongli inscribed at the cave’s mouth:
*"Spring’s qi fills the sky, flower dew drips;
Morning sun strikes the sea, mountain clouds return."*

Turning to Lü, he said, “My audience at the Primordial has its time; the feathered guests of the Ten Isles will journey to Jade Capital to report these merits, ascending the immortal ranks. I fear you cannot long remain in this cave. We shall meet again at Dongting in ten years.” Taking up his brush, he wrote in cursive on the cave’s stone wall:

"By day, the sun shines in lofty brightness;
By night, the moon glows in perfect clarity.
Yin and yang, soul and spirit,
Merge and ascend as one."

He cast aside his brush and declared, “As you wander the world, you must practice the Way of benefiting and saving others! When your deeds are complete and your merit fulfilled, we shall meet again.” With this, he bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Bifa* and said, “At first, within the stone cliffs of Zhongnan, I once obtained the three divisions of the *Lingbao Scriptures*: the upper is called the *Yuanshi Jin’gao*, the middle the *Yuanhuang Yulu*, and the lower the *Taishang Zhenyuan Yi*. Altogether, they number several thousand scrolls. I distilled their essentials into this *Bifa*, dividing it into sixteen sections and the three vehicles with their six meanings. It clarifies how within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—the Dao of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent. Within qi, water is born; within water, qi is born. The mechanism of heart and kidney communion operates through the eight trigrams moving the twelve hours, its crux lying in *Gen*; through the three fields mutually interacting, its crux lying in the *Niwan*. As for the initial practice, I merely use swallowing qi and rinsing saliva as an analogy. Yet the true oral instructions on qi reside in heart-to-heart transmission, not within written words.”

He then presented several grains of numinous elixir, explaining, “These are not the five metals or eight minerals of the mortal world, but a wondrous treasure compounded from rare substances. Though they possess substance, they have no form—like clouds, like fire, like light, like shadows—visible yet intangible. When ingested, they merge with a person’s soul and consciousness into one body, subtle and wondrous, unlike any elixir of physical form.”

Finally, he gifted a poem, which read:

“You are blessed with a spirit of heroic bone—
Thus I teach you the heart’s trance-state.
In the Crystal Palace atop the Hall of Primordial Containment,
I clearly point out the cavern of immortals.

O great man,
Having met the true formula,
You must hold fast with a heart fierce and resolute.
The Five Phases align as naturally as the *daogui*;
Grasp the inverted secret of Tortoise and Serpent.

The Three Corpses’ spirits—
You must strike them through.
Advance and retreat by the celestial mechanism of the Six Jia.
Know these three essentials, and the ten thousand spirits will submit,
Coming to harness the Fire Spirit, departing the Nine Gates.

When the nine-by-nine Dao reaches its consummation in true attainment,
The Three Realms and Four Palaces will celebrate the Return to the Origin.
Qi soars aloft, the spirit blazes in glory—
Penglai is but my family’s dwelling.
The assembled immortals feast amid celestial music’s clamor,
Twin lads usher in the ascending guest.

As my Dao-heart does not regress, I transmit this to you.
We pledge our oath, words sealed with blood.
When you meet others—
Do not speak recklessly.
When you meet fellow seekers—
No need for secrecy.

Do not fault me for repeating these words:
Disdain will surely bring retribution from the Dark Bureau.
Hand in hand we part—what is the feeling?
Today I compose this song anew for you,
Expounding every wondrous principle of the immortal path.
Yet will your heart truly believe it?

I speak to you with utmost clarity—
Cherish my words, ascend to the Great Canopy.”

When Patriarch Lü had heard this, the dust and filth of the world fell away entirely, and he pressed further, asking of the teachings on the "Three Origins, Three Purities, Three Treasures, and Three Realms." Master Zhong replied:

"The first is the Primordial Chaos of Supreme Non-Being, from which the Heavenly Treasure Lord is transformed. He governs the Jade Pure Realm, the Heaven of Subtle Clarity, its qi beginning as azure.

The second is the Crimson Chaos of Supreme Non-Being, from which the Numinous Treasure Lord is transformed. He governs the High Pure Realm, the Heaven of Yu-Yu, its qi verging on yellow.

The third is the Profound Stillness of Mystic Pervasion, from which the Divine Treasure Lord is transformed. He governs the Supreme Pure Realm, the Heaven of Great Redness, its qi verging on white.

Thus the qi of the Nine Heavens gives birth to the spirit."

The scripture states: *"Though their names differ, their root is one."*

Each of the Three Lords serves as a teaching master, the revered teachers of the Three Caverns.

As the transmission neared its end, two immortals suddenly appeared, clad in gossamer robes shimmering with rosy clouds, bearing in their hands golden tablets and sacred talismans. They announced: "By decree of the Supreme Emperor, Zhongli Quan is appointed as the Celestial Envoy of Selection for the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens."

Having received the mandate, he turned to Lü and said, "I shall now ascend to heaven. You must remain in the world, cultivating merit and establishing conduct. One day, you too shall be as I am."

Lü bowed again and replied, "My resolve differs from yours, Master. I must first deliver all sentient beings before I shall ascend."

What boundless vow and power of compassion this was—truly a heart of mercy!

At that moment, phoenixes soared and auspicious cranes took flight, golden banners and jade regalia gleamed, and celestial music resounded in clear, ringing tones. The Ancestral Master Zhong, together with the two immortals bearing the decree, ascended upon clouds, drifting slowly away.

Having received the Dao of Zhongli, Patriarch Lü also obtained the Heaven-Concealing Sword Technique from the True Man of the Fire Dragon. With it, he severed in three stages: first, the afflictions of sound and short-lived vexations; second, the desires of form; and third, greed and wrath.

He once wrote a poem:

*"In years past, I met the Fire Dragon Lord—
A single sword passed to me, companion to this body."*

From mist the heavens and earth and mountains and rivers took form,
While stars and sun and moon halted their turning wheels at will.
Know that the original nature endures through countless kalpas—
Yet vainly in the human world it has passed ten thousand springs.

Last night, Zhongli spoke a single word:
The six celestial palaces would crumble to dust.

This poem was inscribed later, as he blended into the marketplace in remembrance.

On his first journey to the Jiang-Huai region, he tested the magic sword, slaying the great flood-dragon’s harm. Arriving at Dongting Lake, he ascended Yueyang Tower and drank alone. Suddenly, Ancestral Master Zhong descended, saying, “I have come to fulfill our former pact. The Supreme Emperor commands that your kin all dwell in the Jing Mountain grotto-palace, and your name has already been inscribed in the Jade Clarity Register.”

On the eighteenth day of the third month, he was led to pay homage to True Lord Ku Zhu and received the method of the sun and moon’s conjoined radiance. At fifty-three, he returned to Mount Lu to take refuge in the ancestral teachings. At sixty-four, he ascended to pay homage to the Primordial Celestial Worthy and the Jade Emperor. From then on, his appearances and transformations were manifold.

Only because his vows were vast did he drift through the turbid world, practicing transformation and delivering people. Even the most ignorant men and women, hearing his name, could not help but rise in reverence. He once said, “People vie to see me, yet cannot follow my words. Though they dwell with me day and night, what benefit is there? If a person can be loyal to their country, filial and kind to their family, faithful to friends, benevolent to those below, neither negligent of their own heart nor deceitful in secret, using skillful means to aid others and accumulating hidden merit to move Heaven—then people will love them, and ghosts and spirits will revere them. In this single thought, they are already one with me. Though they do not see me, they have seen me.

For the nature of humanity is this:
When the mind turns to goodness, it belongs to luminous yang, its nature entering the light and pure—this is the path to Heaven.
When the mind turns to evil, it belongs to turbid yin, sinking into coarseness and heaviness—this is the stairway to Hell.
Heaven and Hell are not ruled by any sovereign master; they are merely self-created by the human heart!”

In the early years of the Jianlong reign of Emperor Taizu of the Song, the Venerable Lü emerged from the rear palace gardens. Addressing the emperor, he identified himself as the August Thearch of Zhu Ling, who ruled the realm under the virtue of Fire. He spoke at length, though none in attendance could hear his words—his discourse remained secret and untransmitted. The emperor removed his cinnabar robe and jade belt and bestowed them upon him. In an instant, the Venerable Lü vanished. The emperor commanded his likeness be painted in the Tower of Supreme Purity, and Daoist registrar Chen Jingyuan disseminated the portrait among the world.

During the Zhenghe era, malevolent spirits plagued the palace precincts, manifesting even in broad daylight to steal gold and jewels from the imperial consorts. Only the emperor’s own chambers remained untouched. Lin Lingsu, Wang Wenqing, and other court Daoists were summoned to exorcise them, yet the disturbances ceased only to resurface. The emperor fasted with utmost sincerity and offered six memorials in prayer. One day, as he dozed at midday, he saw beyond the Eastern Florescence Gate a Daoist priest—crowned with a kingfisher-blue lotus coronet, clad in a purple crane-feather cloak, and holding a crystal ruyi scepter. The priest stepped forward, bowed, and said, “Your servant has received the August Thearch’s command to subdue this malevolence.”

After a long while, he summoned a warrior in golden armor, who seized the spirit and tore it apart to devour it. The emperor asked, “Who is this warrior?”

The Daoist replied, “This is Lord Guan Yu, the *Chongning* Perfected Lord whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed.” The emperor repeatedly expressed his gratitude. He then asked, “Where is Zhang Fei?” Guan Yu answered, “Fei is my brother through countless kalpas. Now he has been reborn in Your Majesty’s realm to the family of Yue in Xiangzhou. In days to come, he will aid the restoration of the dynasty, and Fei shall render great merit.” The emperor inquired after the Daoist’s name. The Daoist said, “Your servant’s surname is Yang, and I was born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month.” When the emperor awoke from his dream, his attendants identified the Daoist, saying, “This is Master Lü.” From that time onward, the palace disturbances ceased entirely. The emperor then issued an edict to all under heaven, ordering that wherever incense was offered to Master Lü, his title be corrected to “Perfected Lord of Wondrous Communication.”

The imperial decree read: “We delight in joining the people in reverence for the Great Dao. All those immortals and recluses are recorded in the registers. Moreover, those who silently respond to prayers deserve to be shown favor and honor. The Perfected Lord Lü has concealed his radiance and hidden his traces, wandering near and far. When he arrived at the Palace of Established Felicity, he found a temporary abode. Moved by this karmic affinity, We bestow upon him a title and name. Though his numinous presence is solemn and majestic, may he deign to witness this act. Let him be enfeoffed as *Perfected Lord of Wondrous Communication*.” A statue was sculpted in the Palace of Illustrious Spirits, where seasonal sacrifices were offered.

His wondrous spiritual efficacy, as recorded in various biographies, cannot be fully described in words. The Yuan Emperor Shizu enfeoffed him as *Perfected Lord of Pure Yang, Who Warns and Transforms with Orthodox Teachings*. Emperor Wuzong of Yuan later elevated his title to *Perfected Lord of Pure Yang, Who Warns and Transforms with Orthodox Teachings, the Emperor Who Protects and Assists*. His collected poems and lyrics, titled *The Anthology of Effortless Mastery*, circulated in the world. Later, through planchette revelations, he expounded the *Eight Preceding Grades* at Wuling, the *Five Grades* at Qizhen in Ezhu, the *Three Grades* and *Triple Concordance* at Hansan, and the *Scriptures on Sagely Virtue* at the Thatched Hut in Hunan. Earlier works such as the *Treatise on the Pointing Staff*, the *Edict on Loyalty and Filial Piety*, the *Anthology of Cultivating the True and Transmitting the Dao*, and the *Eulogies on the Jade Pivot Scripture* were also transmitted. Now, all these have been compiled into a complete collection.

The following passage, absent in the original Yuan Shizu biography, has been added here:

The Venerable Wuwozi respectfully eulogized: “The Daoist tradition’s *Emperor Who Protects and Assists* is like the Buddhist tradition’s *Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara*. The World-Honored One abides in non-action, yet his Dharma flourishes through the *Great Bodhisattva*. The Most High abides in non-action, yet his Dharma flourishes through the *Emperor*. Though they have attained celestial ranks, they still move among humankind, delivering countless beings. This is akin to the sages’ desire that all things attain their proper place. Thus, for ten thousand generations, all who hear of them are inspired, for their vow-power is vast and far-reaching. Formerly, at the *Śūraṅgama* assembly, the World-Honored One selected the *Great Bodhisattva* as foremost in perfect penetration among all buddhas. As for Ancestor Lü, is he not also foremost in perfect penetration?”

**Brief Preface to the First Eight Chapters of the Scripture**
Since the Blue Ox departed and the studies of *xuan* flourished, and the White Horse arrived and the Buddhist teachings arose, beyond the Confucian canon, there have also been Buddhist scriptures and alchemical classics—all intended to guide and uplift this world, to guard the mind of the Dao with vigilance, and to cleanse the hearts of humankind.

Yet the texts of Buddhism and Daoist immortality each establish their own schools and doctrines, diverging into a thousand paths and ten thousand streams from the Way of the Two Emperors and Three Kings. Who, then, has traced the source to its root and returned to the One?

Only Lüzu harmonized the essences of the Three Teachings and expounded them as various scriptures. The *Eight Chapters* mark their first emergence:
- The first and second chapters were revealed in Guangling,
- The third and fourth in Jinling,
- The fifth in Piling,
- The sixth and seventh in Xinzhou,
- The eighth in Linjiang.

Spanning five regions and several years, one can well imagine the arduousness of their transmission! Yet through his compassionate heart, vast vows, and resolute determination, he ultimately brought them to completion.

This scripture is often profound and solemn, unlike the more expansive later revelations. Yet it truly encompasses all scriptures, gestating myriad chapters—like a spring emerging from the mountains, its momentum bound for the sea; like bamboo shoots breaking through their sheaths, their vitality already piercing the heavens.

In essence, the principle is one and unbroken, the intent fundamentally the same. The Three Teachings need not follow separate paths, nor do the scriptures differ in their ultimate aim. Yet those of shallow learning, inferior capacity, and heterodox schools each raise their crimson banners, mutually ridiculing one another—surely they may now desist and return to the source.

**Original Preface to the Reprinted *Eight Chapters of the Immortal Scripture***
I, by nature, am serene and simple, with a steadfast aspiration for the Dao. In my daily life, I reverently venerate Lüzu. In all my undertakings, I first report to him, and the Master, perceiving my sincerity, often descends through the planchette to bestow guidance, admonitions, and poetic verses. Though his words initially seem cryptic, when events unfold, they invariably align with perfect clarity.

Upon my transfer to govern Yunnan, one day the planchette suddenly conveyed a command: “The immortal scriptures I composed in the past—eight chapters in total—were once printed in Guangling, but their transmission remains limited. You now govern Yunnan, an ancient land of the Six Zhaos, where barbarians and Han intermingle. The people’s nature is harsh, their speech guttural and coarse, ignorant of ritual propriety and royal transformation. Daily they take up arms, slaughtering one another, their rotting bones and putrid flesh reeking of blood and filth, thereby provoking the celestial punishments of the Emperor on High. You shall preface this scripture and widely disseminate it—its benefits will be profoundly far-reaching.” I respectfully assented at the time.

The Dao finds its fullest expression in the *Book of Changes*, while its meaning is exhausted in yin and yang. Later, the Yellow Emperor battled Chiyou at Zhuolu, where the Nine Heavens’ Mystic Woman bestowed upon him the *Classic of the Yin Talisman*, composed by the Supreme Dao Lord—just as in the time of the Dragon Duke, when he crossed Hangu Pass and was urged by Magistrate Xi to compose the *Classic of the Dao and Virtue*. These two scriptures, though their style may seem abstruse, lead to profound clarity; though their words may appear partial, their store of meaning is complete. Thereafter came the *Triplex Unity*, rooted in the *Book of Changes*, expanding upon the intent of the two sages in recondite terms, boundless in its depths! Still later appeared the *Awakening to Reality*, which earnestly expounds the theories of lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, infant and maiden. Those who awaken to it perceive the kan and li within the body; those who remain deluded drift into the arts of alchemical refinement. Such offshoots, myriad and rootless, exaggerate beyond truth—how could the Dao be thus?

This present *Eight Chapters* takes the Dao as its core, supplemented by Confucian and Buddhist teachings. In its essence and function, it accords well with the *Doctrine of the Mean*; its ultimate aim differs not from the *Śūraṅgama* or *Perfect Enlightenment*. Proceeding from shallow to deep, from outer to inner, from manifest to subtle, from the five phases to the myriad things, from daily ethical conduct to the nature of body and mind—nothing is left unaddressed, nothing left obscure. Lofty beyond measure, profound beyond fathoming, when expounded it illumines the Three Luminaries; when unfolded it pervades the Six Directions. Follow it and its end cannot be seen; meet it and its beginning cannot be perceived. Vast indeed, great indeed! Dimly, vaguely, its images and things cannot be exhausted, nor its abstruse subtleties plumbed. Compared to the *Awakening to Reality*, it swiftly treads in the footsteps of the *Triplex Unity*, rivaling its excellence.

Those who wander within the world, if they study and grasp its meaning, will be moved to loyalty to their lord, filial piety to their parents, observance of ritual and law, rejection of violence, and earnest self-cultivation to nurture their reputation. Those who wander beyond the world, if they study and grasp its meaning, will still their thoughts, extinguish desires, refine essence and qi, diligently practice breath circulation, and focus on inner preservation to nurture their spirit. This is called not living in vain; this is called long life; this is called non-arising. The Three Teachings merge as one, and the myriad principles suffer no deficiency.

The Dao does not choose its ground, nor does the ground choose its people. Whether among those clad in robes and caps, versed in culture, or those in feathered speech and floral garments, it appears as if the Eastern Flowery One and the Trustworthy Protector descended in paired chariots upon the clouds to teach them, fully spreading the mystic wind and thoroughly washing away vulgar customs—how could this be but a great aid?

Yet one must grasp the root before aligning the branches, trace the origin before comprehending the end. Thus, in today’s publication and circulation, special attention must be paid to those within the world, for they are the foundation of those beyond it. As the *Master Embracing Simplicity* says: “To seek immortality, one must first take loyalty, filial piety, harmony, compliance, benevolence, and trust as the foundation. If virtue is not cultivated and one merely pursues arts and techniques, one will never attain long life.”

A guest at my side laughed and said: “Sir, you speak eloquently—surely you do not intend to employ the numinous Dao as a means of instruction?” I withdrew, not daring to presume.

In the winter month of the Jia-Yin year of the Wanli reign (1594), the Returned-to-Yang Daoist Zhao Xingcui inscribed this at the Clear-Heart Studio in central Yunnan.

**Original Preface to the *Eightfold Scripture of Immortality***
*(This preface was composed when the eight ranks were first compiled, before their definitive classification)*

The *Eightfold Scripture of Immortality* is the posthumous work of the Pure Yang Patriarch, Master Lü. The first and second ranks were transmitted in Guangling, the third and fourth in Jinling, the fifth in Piyin Pilin, the sixth and seventh in Xinzhou, and the eighth in Linjiang. The master instructed that the scripture be preserved for those worthy of its reception. Later, he commanded Tong Qixuan of Guangling to widely carve and disseminate it, and Disciple Li was tasked with composing this preface.

When the scripture arrived, Qixuan compiled and recorded it, further entreating the Immortal Maiden He and the Purple Yang Patriarch Zhang to proofread and collate it. It was then printed at the Immortal Tower of Wan Dian, and Yang subsequently undertook a thorough revision.

Kneeling in reverence, I bow and compose this preface:

How vast is this *Ranked Scripture*! It encompasses the alchemical canons, dissects profound mysteries, elucidates imperial governance, and serves as a raft for the Dao. It traces origins and conclusions, unifying Heaven and humanity—nothing is left unaddressed. Truly, it is the authentic sign of deliverance from the world and the essential path of immortal cultivation.

In surveying its outline, one may:
—Verify the numinosity of its teachings,
—Discern the flourishing of its aid to governance,
—Gauge the magnitude of its merit and virtue,
—Comprehend the convergence of the Three Teachings,
—Distinguish the rectification of heterodoxy, and
—Confirm the secrets of spiritual refinement.

Why is this so?

The numinous cannot be measured by place; thus, its response grows ever more manifest from the slightest stimulus. Trust cannot be obstructed by distance; thus, its sincerity spreads universally, and its transformation shines ever brighter. Therefore, the Patriarch’s *Ranked Scripture* was not bestowed upon a single person or place. That it was granted to the many scholars of the Five Mounds is precisely to manifest the impartiality of the Great Dao and to instill the mechanism of sincerity that engenders faith. Hence, it is said: *“One may verify the numinosity of its teachings.”*

Of old, Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun transformed the people through spiritual means, governing effortlessly. Thus, the *“Primordial Supreme Ultimate and Five Agents Rank”* begins by exalting the sacred edicts of our Great Ancestor, the August Emperor, aligning them with the Jade Emperor and Heavenly Worthy, and expounding the wondrous principles of transformation. It enables people to clearly understand how migrating toward goodness averts calamity, how accumulating virtue brings fortune, how nurturing one’s nature aligns with the Real, and how to aid the state and bless the people—silently assisting the flourishing of non-action. Hence, it is said: *“One may discern the flourishing of its aid to governance.”*

Of old, the sages of antiquity transformed their forms to expound scriptures, and bodhisattvas manifested in myriad bodies to preach the Dharma. Thus, the Patriarch, grieving for the benighted and blind, bent low to guide them—sometimes through dreams, sometimes through apparitions, sometimes through planchette writings—yet records cannot exhaust his deeds. In this *Ranked Scripture*, he rivals the *Cloud Satchel* and the *Universal Gateway*, his merit and virtue boundless. Hence, it is said: *“One may gauge the magnitude of its merit and virtue.”*

The Dao is one and undivided; there was never a distinction among the Three Teachings. Of old, our Old Master was likened to a dragon, the Profound Sage compared himself to a unicorn, the Elephant Teaching had not yet come east, and Liezi foretold it—yet how could their followers cling to their own traditions and refuse to yield? This was mistaken! Thus, the *Ranked Scripture* broadly draws upon the subtleties of Confucianism and Buddhism, unfolding the profound mysteries of the Dao’s source, making ever clearer the principle that diverse paths converge as one. Hence, it is said: *“One may comprehend the convergence of the Three Teachings.”*

Moreover, the Dao has its orthodox lineage, its lineage has its secrets, and its secrets have their true exegesis. Since heterodox schools arose, the false has mingled with the true, and delusion has disordered the Real. Thus, the *Ranked Scripture* sweeps away falsehood to reveal truth, establishes orthodoxy to dispel heterodoxy—its clarity is strict, its detail precise. Scholars who rely on its ranks to examine exegesis, follow exegesis to explore secrets, and grasp secrets to return to the lineage—how could heterodox schools delude them? Hence, it is said: *“One may distinguish the rectification of heterodoxy.”*

The Great Dao is not easily expressed in plain words, and perfected beings are seldom encountered. Moreover, the mechanisms of cinnabar and lead, the abundance of metaphors, the profusion of names, the concealment of oral instructions in cryptic language—these make comprehension arduous. Yet in reciting and practicing the *Ranked Scripture*, one naturally grasps its meaning, connects its categories, and achieves sudden enlightenment, as if bolts were drawn and doors flung open to grant direct access to the inner sanctum. Hence, it is said: *“One may confirm the secrets of spiritual refinement.”*

Nevertheless, the scripture bears the Dao, while people expound it. The Patriarch composed the scripture to instruct the world, yet if people fail to model themselves upon it to cultivate immortality, will they not betray the benevolent intent of universal deliverance? If every person were to faithfully receive it—not merely reciting and perusing but practicing and embodying its teachings—then each would escape the sea of suffering, ascend the shore of the Dao, and transcend into the realm of immortals, fulfilling the Patriarch’s earnest and compassionate hopes.

How excellent is Disciple Tong! His merit in defending the Dao is as vast and enduring as the scripture itself, and his blessings and posterity will surely flourish in kind. Sun Defu, who preserved the planchette methods, and Zhu Ni, who embraced the Dao and received the scripture, both contributed to this endeavor—thus, they too are mentioned. As for the many faithful recipients of the scripture, their names are recorded within its ranks and need not be repeated here.

Respectfully composed in the third month of the Ji-Chou year of the Wanli reign (1589) by Disciple Li Yingyang of Guangling, who has broadly investigated the subtle and profound.

**Postscript to the *Eightfold Scripture of Immortality***
*(Composed later during the repeated proofreading, this postscript recounts the process of collating the scripture, rather than serving as a dedicated preface to its exposition)*

The *Scripture of Immortality* was composed in the Five Mounds long ago. Its great purpose unifies the Three Teachings, converging the myriad principles. It instructs in loyalty and filial piety, exhorts to virtuous deeds—ever aiding royal transformation and harmonizing with Heaven’s work. From the self to the family, from the family to the state, its extension proceeds from the broad to the refined, from the manifest to the esoteric. Its application attains the utmost of spiritual transformation, yet it does not transcend the return to investigation, sincerity, integrity, and rectification. Such is the meaning of composing the scripture in the Five Mounds!

The Great Dao shines resplendently, its path level and unobstructed—it is no book of hidden wonders or strange anomalies, nor a manual of fortune-telling or exorcism. Those who fathom its subtleties exhaust essence and penetrate transformation, ascending to the Celestial Capital.

Its governance attains order through effortless rule—hands folded in repose, punishments set aside in non-action. Its nurturing of the latent proceeds through cultivating the self, quieting the mind, withdrawing the will, and embracing tranquility. How could it be reduced to burning incense and reciting scriptures, or bowing to canons, blindly trusted by the ignorant and the simple? Thus the superior person awakens to it through subtle spirit, the middling person cultivates it to enter the Dao, and the lesser person gains it to prolong life. Its principles merge into boundlessness, its qi and spirit vast and expansive—how could one not thereby endure as long as Heaven and Earth?

After the scripture was transmitted, errors crept in amid the carving of words and the chiseling of sounds, such as "bird" (鳥) rendered as "crow" (烏), or "fox" (狐) nearing "lonely" (孤). These were once corrected by the two Perfected Ones, He and Zhang, whose emendations were themselves laborious and exacting; now, a thorough revision has been made. Though the Five Mounds’ texts diverged in place and interpretation, they were but rough drafts. What was unordered in scrolls has now been ordered; what was unranked in categories has now been ranked. Yet one still fears that as ages grow distant, errors will be passed down in turn, and the printed text will again become as confused as before: "lord and king" (君王) written as "lord and parent" (君親); "spirit’s decay" (神敗) as "spirit’s nourishment" (神沃); "Great King" (太王) as "Civil King" (文王); "Martial Village" (武鄉) as "Martial Minister" (武卿); "resolving the heart’s unclarity" (任心不了) as "abiding in the heart’s unclarity" (在心不了); "why not cultivate and uphold" (何匪修持) as "why must one cultivate and uphold" (何必修持). Such instances are not merely ten or a hundred—all are errors that arose *after* the corrections of He and Zhang.

What is most troubling is this: the followers of miscellaneous and crooked schools, with their tangled words, imitate our scripture; the clever and eccentric, with their false doctrines, adulterate our canon. The crimson sun wheels through the sky, illuminating all peoples. Heaven and Earth are vast, embracing the ten thousand things—how could one compete with them? Yet can one remain unafraid?

The patterns of Heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; dew, thunder, wind, and rain; clouds, rosy dawn, rainbows, and lightning. The patterns of Earth are mountains and peaks, seas and rivers; flying and walking creatures, hidden and growing things; dwellings and the wilds. The patterns of humanity are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom; loyalty, filial piety, trustworthiness, and sincerity; clothing and food. The reason the Three Powers endure so long is their constancy. Beyond the supreme principle, there is no other principle. At the end of verbose speech, what superfluous words remain!

Thus, after Confucius and Mencius, no more books of Confucius and Mencius appeared; after Laozi and Zhuangzi passed, no more words of Laozi and Zhuangzi were heard. Why then, in revising this immortal scripture, should I compile heaps of bamboo slips, repeatedly engaging in mundane discourse? Even after He and Zhang’s corrections, some suddenly claim one must wait for the tenth month, the tenth day, the tenth hour to begin entering the chamber. I can only laugh and say:
*"How many live a hundred years—
The swift return lies right before your eyes!"*

"Love’s river, desire’s sea—boundless suffering;
How could one bear to wait idly for the tenth year?"

These are truly the galloping strides of heterodox paths, recklessly trespassing the celestial precincts, where wandering spirits and numinous essences roam, tongues wagging like winnowing baskets, disrupting my sacred canons. Such acts merit the punishment of betraying the Dao and forsaking the teachings. Though they may evade manifest judgment, how can they escape the unseen retribution?

By chance, I encountered a devoted disciple in his youth who, to save his mother’s life, cut flesh from his thigh. Later, his father suffered misfortune, and in his overwhelming grief, the son lost his sight. Moved by this, I descended to restore his vision and bestowed upon him a collection of recorded sayings, a scroll of *The Immortal’s Repentance After Snow*, and a fascicle of *The Great Divine Mantra of the Dipper’s Light for Deliverance and Lifesaving*. The immortal scriptures were thereby firmly established.

After the transmission, I no longer returned. This scroll’s sequence is now fixed, radiant as the sun and stars; its ranks are distinguished, steadfast as Mount Tai’s balance. Should anyone alter my words or destroy the scriptures and teachings, this text declares: *"If there be those who destroy the scriptures and teachings: the city gods and village spirits shall report them; the thunder and fire departments shall swiftly mete out retribution."* How could this promise fail?

Receive and uphold these teachings, guarding them without loss. Practice ritual recitation and contemplative insight, cultivating without negligence.

Expanding the propagation of the Dharma and teachings, greatly reviving the winds of the *xuan* tradition. Thus, those who enter the Dao/Way remain unwavering in their resolve, and my strength in defending the Dao/Way is not solitary. These words should also be transmitted alongside *The Eight Ranks*, to admonish those who compile scriptures in later ages.

In the *bingyin* year of the Tianqi reign, on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the Lord of Trust and Protection composed this preface.

*Illustrations of the Eight Ranks* (No illustrations for the sixth and seventh ranks)

**Opening Gatha of the First Eight-Rank Sutra**
(All Daoist scriptures contain a gatha, which encapsulates the entire purport of the sutra and serves as the words of refuge, faith, and submission.)

We bow our heads in homage to the Three Teachings’ Founders,
The Heavenly-Thunder Prime Minister, styled Pure Yang,
Whose meritorious deeds are complete throughout the Three Realms,
Whose vast vows deeply pervade the Ten Directions.
The precious sword’s majestic radiance vanquishes and humbles,
The Golden Elixir’s supreme Dao/Way subdues gods and spirits.
Ascending transcendents’ true canon and satchel,
The wondrous Dharma-vessel universally saves the deluded.
Dispelling misfortune and dissolving calamities, seeking deliverance from peril,
With utmost sincerity, we take refuge and recite the *xuan* chapters.

**Supreme Sutra of the Heavenly Emperor’s Verification of Reality, Opened by the Most High Lord Lü**
**Volume One**

**Chapter One: The Transformation and Nurturance of the Supreme Ultimate**
(All chapter titles were rectified by Lord Lü.)

At that time, two meanings were implied: first, it recounts the reason for receiving the mandate to expound the teachings, as in "at that time"; second, it directly indicates the moment of sutra-recitation, as in the later phrase "At that time, the Perfected One said," and the like.

At that time, the August Jade Emperor, residing in the Lingxiao Heavenly Palace of the Yü rate Star, together with the Holy Mother of the Jasper Pool, expounded the *Wondrous Dharma of the Heavenly Emperor’s Opening of the Supreme Ultimate for Universal Salvation*. The Five Elderly Thearchs, accompanied by the immortals of the Ten Continents, Three Islands, Five Peaks, Four Waterways, and the Three Realms, all gathered at His side to listen to the wondrous Dharma.

Then, the Thearch of the Eastern Peak stepped forth from the assembly and addressed the throne, saying: "Formerly, a celestial decree descended, for the reason that sentient beings had turned their backs on their sovereigns, bullied their parents, and become defiled by the dust of greed, craving the clamor of profit and fame, engaging in deceit, theft, depravity, and licentiousness. Their impurity and chaos bred mutual contention between self and others, and strife among kin. Thus, retribution was specially ordained to afflict their descendants, and calamities to plague the land. In obedience to the decree, the continents were surveyed: epidemics of premature death and pestilence spread across hundreds of thousands of myriads of beings; drought and flood ravaged the crops, ruining seven or eight parts out of ten. Those with grave offenses were cut off from their posterity, while those with lighter sins suffered from plagues and pestilence. Their souls filled the courts of the Underworld, and none could be delivered."

Amidst famine and starvation, the roads were filled, and daily life became unbearable. Such was the retribution for their sins, yet beings still failed to repent, ensnared in the web of karmic transgressions. Humbly we beseech the Merciful One to take pity on their ignorance, deliver them from great suffering and distress, and bestow a decree of grace to transform misfortune into fortune. May they return to the true Dao, cast off all obstacles, and no longer suffer untimely death; may the realm know peace and the years bring abundance. Thus, the lingering souls may ascend, and pestilence, by this, be purified into tranquility. May heaven be clear and earth serene, all things prosper in harmony.”

The Jade Emperor replied, “Excellent! Excellent! The mortal realm is defiled, evil pervades heaven and earth, and the wheel of retribution turns, visiting obstruction and karma upon them. For they have strayed from the true Dao and thus committed transgressions. Let it be decreed that the Immortal Ministry dispatch the Perfected One Lü to descend to the world, broadly reveal the subtle and profound, awaken the blind and deaf, and expound the Great Dao of Supreme Strength. Let him purge the world of its dust and miasma, that all may turn from evil and return to rectitude!”

“I, in obedience to the Supreme and Non-Action Wondrous Decree, shall deliver living beings. Those in the world who read and recite this may release deep-seated grievances and past suffering, resolve the transgressions of this life, and transform all into just rulers and upright ministers, loving fathers and filial sons, harmonious brothers, mutual affection among the six relations, unerring propriety and righteousness, and households of purity and peace. All of you, with reverence and sincerity, heed my teaching:

The Supreme Ultimate was formless, born before heaven and earth. Qi and spirit merged as one in the primordial chaos.”

One qi then stirred—stirring, it trod the yang, and its hexagram answered as Qian. Stirring to its utmost, it returned to stillness—still, it gave birth to yin, and its hexagram answered as Kun. Light and pure, it floated upward, and the Qian Dao became Heaven; heavy and turbid, it congealed below, and the Kun Dao became Earth.

Now Heaven—its motion ceaseless, its qi whirling like a ring. Now Earth—firm and still, its winds fierce yet sustaining. Heaven and Earth interdepend, their substance and function complete: Heaven rests upon Earth, Earth upon Heaven.

The sun is yang qi accumulated, its essence shining outward; the moon is yin qi accumulated, its po containing radiance. The principles of yin and yang are all bound to the *Yi*; the pivot of the celestial sphere holds its warp and weft—such are the transformations of Heaven and Earth’s creative work.

The sixty-four hexagrams, each inverted or upright, each descending or ascending—ascending, they unite with yang; descending, they align with yin. Those who cultivate the elixir expound the hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng*: *Zhun* ascends yang, *Meng* aligns with yin. Fire has its upper and lower, reversal and uprightness must be clear.

The mystery of yin and yang, the division of dark and new moons—at the first exchange of *zi* and *hai*, the numinous essence of the elixir coalesces. The *Ren* and *Du* meridians, the essence of yin and yang, flow unimpeded through the hundred channels, circulating through the body, naturally and of itself, not by any contrived spirit.

Water and fire, the division of above and below: the *Yongquan* at the soles of the feet, the root of the two qi. Rising into the *Weilu*, they meet the two sovereigns—one water, one fire, right as life, left as essence. Ascending the spine, the double gates open. Reaching the *Niwan*, they return to the *Mingtang*, silently irrigating the five palaces. Descending through the *Chonglou*, straight into the *Jiangting*, they flow back to the elixir府, ceaseless day and night, impossible to dam or halt.

True fire has no season, the great medicine no weight. With spirit driving qi, the supreme Dao is accomplished.

Man embodies the Three Powers, his body complete with the Supreme Ultimate. The heart precedes Heaven and Earth, vast and penetratingly round. Its original nature is empty and limpid, its function harmonious and balanced. Spirit transforms naturally, endlessly and without attachment.

*“Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the conduct of Heaven.”*
Essence transforms into qi, qi into spirit; refining spirit to return to emptiness is called longevity.

Yet beings do not awaken—they are deluded by the seven emotions: joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure scatter spirit in form. They rebel against the moral order, violate the constant norms. Drowning in the waves of desire, they commit countless acts of unkindness: sons disobey fathers, ministers betray rulers, elder brothers do not love younger, younger do not respect elder, wives do not submit to husbands, friends do not trust companions. Benevolence and righteousness are perverted, form and spirit unsettled. They are vain, deceitful, and false; tame yet fierce, self-aggrandizing; proud, arrogant, self-protective, and belittling of others.

Thus the Supreme Lord shakes with anger, and transgressions bring calamity: crops fail, kin scatter, untimely deaths and violent ends, floods, fires, plagues, and punishments. Yet they do not reflect—instead, they resent the gods, foolish and stubborn in their heavy transgressions.

Therefore I descend, expounding the teaching and founding the school, preaching the Dharma to deliver beings. Each of you should examine and rectify yourself, unite sincerely in heart, be loyal, filial, righteous, and compassionate, accumulate virtue and merit, painfully repent past wrongs, and reform to begin anew. In stillness, awaken to the Dao; in silence, nurture spirit.

I transmit the supreme principle, broadly revealing it to Heaven and humanity. If you can fathom it, you will instantly transcend the wheel of suffering. I pity those drowning in delusion, repeatedly manifesting forms, traversing the cosmos, universally delivering all beings.

This first chapter of the scripture briefly expounds the causes of cultivation; the seven subsequent chapters serve as the great bridge of guidance. Those who faithfully receive and take refuge will have their names recorded in the celestial court. Those who awaken will be numinous; those who slander will be struck down. Those who realize it will attain fruition in the registers of immortals; those who transmit it will benefit across three lifetimes.

The Sagely Dao of the August Ultimate must not be treated lightly. Those who aid it will increase blessings and prolong life; those who destroy it will forever sink into the dark netherworld. Heavenly spirits observe and examine—retribution is clear and bright. With purification, reverence, and recitation, the myriad spirits all revere it. City gods and village altars follow the teaching and practice it.

The assembly at the altar rejoiced, believed, and received it, then bowed and withdrew.

**Chapter Two: The Five Phases and the Root of Filial Piety**

At that time, the Perfected Lü of Pure Yang said: “In past lives, my heart abided in the Dao. Following form and entrusting transformation, I never lost my root or pursued nature, thus never straying from my original source. Though the supreme secret was hard to encounter, my body and life floated and sank. Repeatedly receiving, repeatedly cultivating, I accumulated merit and virtue, vowing to practice filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, righteousness, benevolence, and compassion.

Later, I met the Lord Emperor of Eastern Florescence and thus heard the great Dao. I ascended to the Golden Gates and attained sagehood, becoming a perfected one. Pitying the afflicted, I roam the Three Realms, universally saving all beings.

Recently, a celestial decree has commanded me to deliver those blind and deaf in the sea of karma. Yet many chase fame and profit, while few attain sagehood and cultivate perfection. They scorn others and think only of themselves, their natures like wolves and tigers, their venom even more poisonous. Their words and hearts diverge, their schemes myriad. Countless are those stained by desire, but how few cherish life!

I have heard the Supreme Lord say: *‘I have three treasures, which I hold and preserve: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to put oneself before the world.’* Thus compassion engenders courage; frugality engenders abundance; not daring to put oneself before the world enables one to perfect one’s vessel.”

What is called *"the Real"*? It is to empty the heart and sever thoughts, preserve *qi* and nurture essence. Respond to things without being ensnared by them; cultivate emptiness and embody the void. Clarity of intent and emotion—thus begins primordial cultivation. The six gates are strictly guarded; a single breath is ever present. *Qi* and spirit do not deplete; spirit and *qi* merge as one.

Subdue *qi* beneath the navel; guard the spirit within the body. When spirit and *qi* harmonize, the gates and pivots open smoothly. You speak of the Dao—where does the Dao reside? If the heart does not forget the Dao, the Dao is already attained! Embody the heart of sages and sages’ deeds—only then is it the Dao!

I have received the grace of a mandate to guide all beings. With wisdom, I illuminate you, yet you still do not believe and accept, recklessly wielding cunning and deceit, stirring up treachery and obstinacy. You conceal falsehood amid truth, making the Real difficult to grasp. Clearly, in this floating life, there is no benevolence or virtue!

My heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth. I only wish that all the deluded will universally cultivate kindness and goodness, silently focusing spirit so that spirit and *qi* align. Subdue and embrace primordial *qi*; do not lose these three treasures.

Now, for the sake of all beings, I expound the principles of the *Yi*, drawing analogies from former sages to illustrate subtle truths. I show that the *Yi* encompasses the Dao, and the Dao encompasses the *Yi*. Gather and practice it; cultivate it in seclusion; guard it in silence; refine it with diligence. Then the spirit ascends to the Purple Palace, and one takes one’s place among the immortals.

When Qian and Kun merge, the images of the *Yi* are thus. Once the singular *qi* divides, it becomes the source of the Two Modes. To fathom the spirit and know transformation, to encompass all in an unbroken cycle—knowing the subtle and the manifest, the hidden and the revealed, which are indescribable, continuous, and boundless, their radiance illuminating the vast primordial.

Pride does not endure; only humility can preserve the whole. Guard the Dao with reticence; indulging in cleverness will surely lead to error. Hold to the center and embrace the One; walk in harmony and humility. Accumulate through lowliness; strengthen through softness.

When the heart stirs, it becomes intent; when intent turns, it becomes emotion; when emotion clings, it becomes delusion; delusion leads to manifold transgressions. Human emotion, upon seeing things, is like a tiger in pursuit; human intent, upon seeing things, is like a dragon’s coils. If the stirring heart is not extinguished, the illuminating heart cannot be perfected. Life resides in the kidneys; nature belongs to Qian.

When the heart congeals, it becomes spirit; when spirit is still, it becomes nature. To exhaust principle and fulfill nature is to merge with the boundless. When spirit returns to non-action, refining and tempering the Three Origins, seeing yet not perceiving, hearing yet not clamoring, speaking yet voiceless—all thoughts are cast aside.

In the Dao of the Five Phases, water and fire transform. Water and fire harmonize; water and fire intermingle. Within fire is earth; within water is flame. Since fire generates earth, the three natures are complete. Use earth to restrain water; when water overflows, it must be turned back. Guide water to aid fire; when water and fire rejoice together, metal and wood unite, *qi* and spirit connect. The nature of metal and the essence of wood are driven and refined until they adhere. Through the long night, light pierces heavy curtains. Nurturing with warmth, ascending mercury and descending lead—metal floats, wood sinks, the red sun stands at midheaven.

Fire requires water to aid it; water relies on fire to blaze. Use softness to restrain hardness; hardness and softness intertwine. Refined into one mass, neither mercury nor lead, it can ascend and descend—this is called the Embryonic Immortal.

Circulate fire to refine the elixir; spirit and *qi* entwine. Use fire as an analogy for spirit; use the *qi*-vessel as an analogy for the elixir. Unite spirit with *qi*; when *qi* is sufficient, spirit is complete. The river chariot’s count: circulate *qi* through the celestial cycle. Heart and breath depend on each other; the abdomen stores, the eyes are clear.

Wu-earth follows Kan, advancing with yang fire; Ji-earth follows Li, retreating with yin tally. Advancing and retreating, merging and parting—abandon them to the Great Primordial. The aperture of the Primordial Sea follows the Mud Pill Palace. The Five *Qi*-Vessels merge; all phenomena pay homage to Heaven.

Yet people do not recognize this and cling to distorted transmissions. Before the human Dao is complete, the immortal Dao is difficult to fulfill. To cultivate the Real Dao, the human Dao must merge with the immortal. Practice and walk this path, and immortals and sages will stand side by side.

Born of father and mother, the body unites with karmic conditions. Shift spirit and shed *qi*; waxing and waning like the moon’s beauty. The two *qi* assist each other; tortoise and snake coil together. Gathered and congealed, the embryo is complete. Nurtured for ten months, the body accords with the prenatal. Splitting open the primordial chaos, the image appears resplendent.

Nurtured in the womb and suckled, the mother’s form is emaciated and tormented. Gradually, the child is reared, the body firm and spirit complete. Shedding *qi* and transforming through nurture—boundless is the vast Heaven. What is called "transformation" is a profound and subtle principle.

The Dao of the Embryonic Origin accords with Kun and Qian. Yang bestows; yin receives. Emotion and nature intertwine.

In this world, those lost on the path doubt and misinterpret the teachings. They scatter internally and drown externally, clinging to the seven emotions and spoiling the six roots. Losing their original nature and forgetting the Real, they know no warning. Fire scorches; water collapses; *qi* departs; spirit decays.

Cherishing children and pitying wives, they hold pearls in their palms. Yet the great kindness of parents becomes dust in their eyes. Disobedient and unfilial, their sins are vast. If you cherish your child, you should cherish your parents. If you are filial to your parents, your child will also be filial to you. If you do not respect your parents, your child will also defy you.

The sorrowful countenance of parents is like lightning or morning dew. Receiving *qi* and taking form, you should remember their nurturing. Now, as I transmit this scripture, filial piety is the foremost duty—the first of the Five Phases, the path of a hundred virtues. Follow their wishes and expressions; heavenly spirits will protect you. If you do not honor your ancestors, the years and months are spent in vain.

Those who are unfilial will be split by thunder; retribution is clear and swift—awaken now! In the dark room, you may deceive your heart, but the divine cannot be concealed. If you wish to learn the immortal Dao and attain longevity, first cultivate the human Dao as your duty.

The *Yi* says: *"Coming and going in confusion, friends follow your thoughts."* Harmony of *qi* is the thoroughfare of spirit; the transformation of essence is the task of the elixir. Returning essence to replenish the brain is like mist or fog—creating something from nothing, a practice rare in the world.

Why does Heaven’s form endure? Why does the door’s hinge not rot? Inwardly illuminating the jewel of wisdom, the resplendent Pearl Palace shines brightly.

The reason beings cannot fully comprehend with their hearts is that they are attached to things and deluded by love.

If you attain softness to nurture harmony, turn the body inward and reflect—then the Dao abides therein!

Guangchengzi said: *"See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness."*
The *Odes* says: *"The workings of High Heaven bear no sound, no scent."*
The Western teachings say: *"No wisdom, no attainment—thus, nothing is attained."*
The Most High said: *"Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is its function. The greatest sound is soundless; the greatest form is formless. The vulgar are ever bright; I alone seem dim. That by which Heaven and Earth endure is their non-self-existence."*

How grand the words of sages and worthies!

The *Analects* says: *"Hold to no certainty, cling to no rigidity."*
Mencius said: *"Neither forget nor force—both are steps to preserving spirit and guiding qi."*

Yet people today remain unaware!

The Dao of nurturing qi lies in unbroken continuity—like flowing water’s winding ease, like drifting clouds’ soaring flight, like a round pearl rolling on a plate, or an infant’s selfless state.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *"Obscure yet ever more radiant."*
The *Wall Sutra* says: *"His heart rests in perfect repose."*

---

Are these not all truthful words? From ancient times to the present, the sages and worthies have followed the same track, like wheels sharing a single rut. Yet the ignorant世俗, blindly dividing the Three Teachings, fail to recognize that *"a thousand lamps in one room share the same light; ten thousand dharmas follow the same principle to sagehood."* Without plumbing the subtlest depths of the supreme principle, they cling obstinately to right and wrong, self and other, grasping at branches and plucking leaves, wagging their tongues and flaunting their lips. They flaunt their arms in delusion, practicing blind cultivation and aimless refinement. Later learners are all led astray by such clamor, never awakening.

May all beings advance diligently in the Dao, with sincere hearts and earnest devotion. Do not cling to the sounds of phenomena, nor become attached to mere words. Honor your teachers and draw near to virtuous friends; empty yourself in reverence. In silent realization, you may ascend to longevity!

Then was spoken the incantation:

*North unites Heaven and Earth’s essence,*
*Transforming all things with boundless spirit.*
*The axis of Qian and Kun turns,*
*Dragon and Tiger conceal true qi.*
*Six demons dissolve and scatter,*
*Three Primes shine with radiant splendor.*
*Crow and Hare meet in the central valley,*
*Tortoise and Serpent coil within the inner court.*
*Roaming beyond the cosmos,*
*Grasping life and death in hand.*
*Commanding lightning’s flashing might,*
*All ghosts and spirits vanish without trace.*
*Who dares defy this power?*
*Shattered like dust in the wind.*
*Where wisdom’s light shines forth,*
*All calamities and misfortunes turn to peace.*
*Receive and recite with reverence,*
*Your name recorded in the celestial palace.*

When the Perfected One finished expounding the sutra, auspicious clouds and fragrant mists swirled in the air, while propitious vapors coiled and ascended. Cranes bore his chariot through the azure sky. The master returned to his abode, and all present bowed deeply, prostrating themselves in homage. They received the teachings in faith and withdrew.

*(The above two chapters were inscribed at Guangling.)*
**Chapter Three: Sincerity, Reverence, and Daoist Practices**

At that time, the Pure Yang Immortal Master addressed the great assembly of Jinling, saying: "Through the Xu family of Hecheng, I long dwelt in the gate of emptiness, practicing joyful almsgiving and enduring hardship. Though I have passed seventy years, my resolve for the Dao has never waned. Though I have not achieved sudden enlightenment, my merits run deep. By the command of the Jade Emperor’s voice, I was tasked to deliver sentient beings. My wisdom illumined heaven and earth, and my sincerity moved them to descend. I have already expounded the *Supreme August Ultimate’s* first and second chapters on the mechanisms of transformation and nurturance.

Yet the beings there were arrogant and self-important, envious and jealous, greedy and wrathful. I repeatedly taught them the virtuous Way, but the multitude clung to delusion and failed to awaken. Though two or three preachers of the Dharma emerged, none embodied my spirit of universal salvation. Each harbored private obstructions, flaunting their abilities, uttering kind admonitions yet failing to exhort others. They indulged in superficial displays outside the teachings, boasting of their own virtues. Before attaining the immortal realms, they rashly rejected others’ counsel—how lamentable, how pitiable!

Those who practice my Way must accumulate merit and cultivate virtue, exhorting goodness and transforming evil, teaching loyalty and filial piety, encouraging faith and sincerity. With *qi*, they achieve suppleness; in tranquility, they abide in the Middle Way. They discern no wrong in others, nor do they incur blame from hidden spirits. Harmonizing with the nature of the multitude, they follow the principles of the people. Through the Dao and righteousness, they enact benevolence and compassion, benefiting beings and aiding life. They pity the poor and relieve the suffering, their mercy extending even to insects and plants—nothing may be harmed or destroyed. They grieve for the wicked and succor the afflicted, practicing life-release and forbidding killing. To cultivate great compassion and act with a mind of expedient means surpasses even fasting and abstinence. To embody the virtue of heaven and earth—what practice could be excluded?

When encountering the unvirtuous, those who walk my Way transform them through virtue and reason. If they stubbornly refuse goodness, one must still meet them with harmonious countenance and cheerful demeanor. Thus did Confucius, step by step, skillfully guide others; thus did Lou Shide endure spittle drying on his face—when did he ever harbor anger? If one masters oneself and remains composed without arrogance, even the wicked will turn from evil to goodness—such is the merit of expounding the teachings. To abandon the people without instruction is to cast them aside—how could one be without blame?

When encountering those who revere the Dao, one should bind them with kindness and goodness. If they err in practice or cling to partiality, one must still guide them to awakening through the sacred scriptures."

Thus does the noble person bring joy to those near and draw those far—like King Tai of Zhou, whose followers thronged like a marketplace, all through the power of virtue and kindness. If one exhausts one’s harmony without partiality, others will surely turn toward rectitude and rise in reverence—such is the benevolence of expounding the teachings. To see another stumble and not lift them—how could one bear it? Would this not be a grievous fault?

All under heaven are to be taught without distinction. As a teacher or mentor, one must act with loyalty, forbearance, respect, and solemnity; meet others with harmonious qi and cheerful countenance; take righteousness as one’s essence and ritual as one’s practice; receive them with humility and fulfill them with trust. Too profound, and one becomes severe—severity makes following difficult. Too shallow, and one becomes frivolous—frivolity breeds disorder. Words not weighty lack authority.

Ah, to guard the One! With mind at peace and qi harmonized, qi harmonized and spirit flowing, spirit flowing and body at ease—vast as heaven and earth, one moves without shame, inhaling and exhaling in accord with nature, never departing from substance and function. Preserve the true One-heart, transcend the true One-Way.

I have heard the Most High say: *"Before heaven it is born, born yet without form; after heaven it abides, abiding yet without body. Stillness is its nature, the heart within it; movement is its heart, nature within it. When the heart arises, nature vanishes; when the heart ceases, nature appears. Like empty space without form, it is serene and ever full."*

The Great Dao has no image, yet inwardly abides in being. True nature has no exterior, and does not give rise to the heart. Abiding in the realm, one forgets the realm—no image remains. Guarding the formless, one roots deeply, nurturing celestial authenticity, as if forgotten yet present. Essence unites with qi, qi unites with spirit.

The Most High said: *"Spirit is born from form, essence is filled by qi. Know spirit and qi, and you may attain long life."* I cite the words of the ancient sages to harmonize the Three Teachings—not idle branches or leaves to mislead the multitude. If one awakens suddenly, one may preserve the true form.

I transmit the scriptures, yet in Yangzhou, arrogance and deceit prevail. Thus I reveal these teachings in Jinling, with loyalty and trust as their measure, to transform all beings. I do not urge fasting, only sincere faith. Fasting is fasting of the heart—if the heart is not cultivated, what merit lies in fasting? To know only the restraint of the mouth and not the restraint of the heart—this heart is the Dao. Guard it firmly, lightly not.

You who attend this altar, each bears karmic causes from the past. Having heard this Way, still the dust of your hearts. When worldly desires are wholly overcome, the Great Dao shines clearly. Still, take the *Five Ranks* text from Piling, harmonize its ranks with transmission, and reverently uphold the *Rank-Changing Scripture*.

I shall descend in spirit to address the assembly of Yangzhou: each must reform your angry hearts, avoid repeating past errors, lest your cultivation be in vain. If you harbor seeds of wrongdoing, you will incur punishment; if you receive with sincere faith, you will surely ascend. The Dao makes no distinction between rich and poor—do not choose whom to exhort. Words may claim certainty, yet true knowing remains uncertain.

Those who cultivate the Dao have hearts without the slightest dust; those who attain the Dao often live in hidden poverty. The Dao is not conferred by wealth—it is transmitted only to those of trust. If you seek me for gain, how shall I hear you? Empty yourself to seek the Dao, and the sage will surely manifest.

Do not presume to be others’ teacher, nor look down upon them. To obstruct another’s practice invites calamity upon your house. Good words should be understood; false speech must not be spoken. Cloaked in coarse cloth yet holding jade—how could Fan Yu measure such a one?

Thus the Most High said: *"To see the small is called clarity; to guard the soft is called strength. Employing strength while returning to clarity, one leaves no misfortune for oneself."* Without action, there is no failure; without attachment, there is no loss.

Yao praised Shun for governing the people with leniency; Zhong Hui extolled Tang for his perfect kindness and benevolence. If one is haughty and without discord, if the multitude is free from favoritism, if one is strict with oneself and lenient toward others—one draws near the Dao.

Thus the sage cultivates the self through the Dao, and cultivates the Dao through benevolence. Praising the good while pitying the incapable, the perfect Dao coalesces. Gentle toward those afar, the world returns to benevolence—thus aiding heaven and earth in transformation, and partaking in the triad of heaven, earth, and humanity.

Now those who study external alchemy fiddle with the Four Yellows, while those of internal alchemy stop at seated practice. They do not consider that the Five Metals are not the mother of the Eight Stones, nor is the illusory body the precelestial Dao. Thus the swallow does not hatch a phoenix, nor does the fox give birth to a horse. To nurture with the illusory body, to practice with arsenic and sulfur—these are not one’s true parents. Qi does not connect, spirit does not commune—how can one refine the external to nourish the internal?

When the Six Demons are extinguished, the Six Penetrations arise; when the Three Corpses are severed, the Three Lights appear. They do not depart from the body, nor do they cling to it.

Now those who awaken to practice believe they have attained through sitting—sitting by night, lying by day—how can they refine the form? In all twelve hours, act without fail. With spirit drive qi, with qi move essence. Essence does not enslave the form, nor does it arise from emotion. If emotion does not shift, essence does not drown or collapse.

Essence is not inherently born—it arises from emotion. Unite essence with qi, harmonizing and gathering celestial authenticity. Celestial authenticity is not true—"true" is but a forced name. Harboring thoughts of self and others—how can this be the heart of the Dao?

Those who practice the Way embody the heart of heaven and earth. Whether called Confucian, Buddhist, or Daoist, the Three Teachings do not depart from the heart: Confucians with humility and harmony, Buddhists with forbearance, Daoists with yielding. *"Essence, qi, and spirit"* cannot be obtained without softness; *"precepts, concentration, and wisdom"* cannot be upheld without forbearance; *"benevolence, righteousness, and virtue"* cannot be contained without harmony. Softness, forbearance, and harmony—these are the mean, and therein lies completion.

The mean is nature, and nature is fundamentally good. Advancing with the yang fire, one subdues nature with emotion; retreating with the yin tally, one returns emotion to nature.

What is called *nature* is wood, mercury, spirit, fire, dragon, and snake. What is called *emotion* is metal, lead, essence, water, tiger, and turtle. These are all metaphors.

When spirit moves essence, essence transforms into qi. When metal smelts wood, wood becomes timber. Driving the dragon to the tiger, dragon and tiger rejoice in union. With the heart subduing the body, heart and body harmonize in peace.

By returning emotion to nature, emotion and nature blend in harmony;
By returning lead to mercury, mercury and lead fuse like lacquer;
By the turtle entwining the snake, turtle and snake coil in embrace.
Without oral transmission, all is but forced conjecture!

Confucianism is for *action*, Buddhism for *quiescence*, and the *Xian* path for *preservation*.
Quiescence means stilling birth, aging, sickness, suffering, and death—pointing to the quiescence of illusion.
Action means practicing benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—pointing to the governance of conduct.
Preservation means preserving metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—preserving the spirit within.

Birth, aging, sickness, suffering, and death are stilled;
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust are practiced;
Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth are preserved.
Things arise from earth and perish in earth; humans arise from qi and perish in qi.
Those who purify earth and nurture qi may partake in the *Xian* path!

Then he spoke the gatha:
Great indeed is the true *Xian*!
Water and fire in balance,
Returning emotion to nature—
Not through greed or wrath.
The wondrous Dao of emptiness aligns with the celestial mind.
This celestial mind is not the fleshly heart;
It is singular in truth,
Never dual or inclined.
Enter through sincerity,
Achieve through silence.
Not that it lacks spirit,
But spirit resides in the inch of sincerity.

I reach with sincerity,
Not with wealth.
Disciples of the Dao,
First cultivate your hearts.
Do not indulge in arrogance,
Nor cling to stubborn emptiness.
Refrain from violence and anger,
Accumulate virtue and benevolence.
Encourage filial piety toward parents,
Loyalty to the sovereign,
Trust among friends,
Harmony with neighbors,
Compassion for all beings,
Relief for the poor.
Do not boast of your own merits,
Nor belittle others.
Wealth has no root—
Why pride yourself?
Poverty is not eternal—
Why harbor resentment?
The poor do not flatter,
The rich do not arrogantly display.
Good begets good with resounding voice,
Evil begets evil with departing tone—
Karmic retribution is clear and bright.
If you cultivate goodness,
Your descendants will flourish;
If you commit evil,
Your posterity will wither.
Relieve the orphaned, cherish the aged,
Refrain from killing, release the living.
Day by day, month by month,
You will surely attain merit.
With the Three Primes’ protection,
All sages will aid your success.
In years to come, when your practice is complete,
You will ascend with your entire household.

The master concluded the gatha.
Among the assembly, twenty people in unison voiced their praise,
bowed their heads to the dharma altar,
expressed gratitude to the celestial perfected,
and wholeheartedly accepted the teachings,
vowing to embody the precious scripture of the immortal master,
to practice impartiality,
to eliminate the Three Poisons,
to distance themselves from the Six Dusts,
to purify the heart and illuminate nature,
and to make their grand vows before the master.

At that moment, auspicious clouds gathered in gentle harmony,
immortal music filled the sky,
white cranes soared,
cinnabar clouds illuminated the chamber,
and the assembly bowed in reverence before withdrawing in solemnity.

**Chapter Four: Zhengzhong’s Teachings**

Then Lü Zu again addressed the assembly, saying:
"The world is an illusion of the blind multitude, who do not embody the formless and are utterly lost in existence.
Often seeking the Dao, they cling to delusion and stray from truth,
not knowing that the Dao resides within themselves, not in external manipulation.

The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states:
*'The mind is like a master painter, creating all pure conditions.'*
The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says:
*'When the mad nature ceases, cessation itself is bodhi.
Hearing is restored, the root of obstruction removed, dust vanishes, and awakening is perfectly pure.'*
The *Pan* scripture says:
*'From love arises sorrow, from sorrow arises fear.'*
All your fears stem from love.
Depart from this ocean of love, and it is called true awakening.

The *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* states:
*'All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, echoes, dew, and lightning—
contemplate them thus.'*
You have long erred in stubborn emptiness, entangled in multiplicity and delusion.
Can you awaken to such truths?
Can you practice and uphold them?

The *Buddha-nāma Sūtra* says:
*'With attachment, there is arising; with the exhaustion of attachment, there is cessation.
Comprehending this arising and cessation, one may speak of it.'*

It is not that I seek extensively among the sages for analogies,
but because the three teachings—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—
have been falsely divided by people.
Branches and leaves are used as metaphors,
creating a vast chasm,
yet when one investigates the root,
all return to the same principle.

A heart free from worldly dust is called *emptiness and tranquility*.
People attribute this to Buddhism as the path of quiescence and cessation,
yet they do not know themselves.

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says:
*'Quiescence and cessation are called the One Mind—
not the cessation of movement, nor the extinction of what has already arisen.
Only when the locus of arising is known can the locus of cessation be understood.'*
The *Yuanjue Jing* states:
*'When the eye of wisdom is pure and clear,'*
it purifies the inner realm.
With no inner realm arising,
true samādhi and nature’s samādhi are realized.
When nature is settled, emotions are stilled,
and the primordial is illuminated.

The primordial is called *spirit*;
congealing spirit in *Kun* gives birth to the numinous medicine.
The postnatal is called *qi*;
circulating qi into *Qian* completes the elixir’s work.

The true nature is quiescent and unmoving,
yet responsive and unobstructed.
Refining medicine with spirit,
guiding qi to nurture spirit,
qi infuses spirit—
not bound by trigrams or forms,
fire and seed continue in succession,
the elixir crucible remains warm.

Thus, the ceaseless cycle of heaven and earth
awakens one to perfect quiescent awareness.
With a quiescently aware heart,
do not indulge in illusions or defiled appearances.
Understand that body and mind
are all hindrances.
Without knowing, awareness is bright,
not dependent on any obstruction.

The learning of the Western Paradise
takes departure from illusion as the Dao,
so heaven and earth accomplish without speech.
The primordial true nature
comes from emptiness and nothingness;
the postnatal true samādhi
arises from forbearance and clarity.

Abiding in silent preservation,
congealing essence to transform spirit,
obscuring things to lose intent,
dispersing qi to divide spirit—
do not be burdened by things.
Preserve essence with spirit,
essence depends on spirit to transform,
nature is still, spirit merges.

The Most High said:
*'Always observe the wondrous with desirelessness,
always observe the gateway with desire.'*
Gather the gateway of desire
to unite with the wondrous *Xian* path.

Thus, the Buddha, the World-Honored One, said:
*'With the power of quiescence and cessation, arise in perfect stillness,
abide in purity.'*

Now, as I expound the Dharma,
heavenly spirits gather in throngs,
thunder and fire oversee the altar,
golden youths burn incense and emit fragrance,
jade maidens scatter blossoms,
all sages assemble,
cleansing the dust and vapors.
If you do not believe and accept,
the officials will bind your souls.
All beings, take heed!

Purify your hearts with sincerity—
the spirits cannot be deceived.
Do not be deluded by karmic causes.
The path of loyalty and integrity
is revered by gods and ghosts alike."

To serve one's lord with the Dao,
one must be prudent and diligent,
never indulging in idleness or arrogance,
never stained by greed or wrath.
Without cultivating merit and virtue,
emptiness and stillness remain elusive;
with the dust-heart unresolved,
the immortal realms stay beyond reach.

The plantain offers its auspicious sign—
this is my manifestation of the numinous,
revealed to you in the capital,
to honor the meritorious ministers.
Those loyal to their lords,
who die for principle or defy authority:
such were Bi Gan of Yin,
Qu Yuan of Chu,
Bo Yi and Shu Qi of Zhou,
and Long Feng of Xia.
Those who remonstrated boldly,
plucking the dragon’s scales:
Ji An and Zhu Yun of Han,
Lu Zhi and Wei Zheng of Tang.
The reclusive scholars of insight:
Zhang Liang, who repaid loyalty to Han,
Fan Li, who left Yue to preserve his life.
Those who upheld fidelity unto death:
Zhuge, Marquis of Wuxiang,
Lord Guan of Hanshou,
Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan,
Yan Zhen and Gao Xing.
The loyal and steadfast of ancient times,
their names inscribed in crimson and azure,
their glory rivaling sun and moon,
their places secured in the celestial court—
this passage foreshadows the later *Exhortation on Loyalty and Filial Piety*.

Flatterers and sycophants,
who curry favor with their lords,
who enrich themselves through cruelty
and bleed the people of their fat;
who chase fleeting glory and wealth,
are scorned for ten thousand generations.
Behold these paragons,
who aided the state and forgot themselves—
how can one not blush with shame,
crimson to the core?

Now I exhort the world:
to be a minister is to be loyal,
to serve one’s lord with loyalty,
and one’s descendants shall flourish like clouds.
Loyalty is the fulfillment of one’s duty,
not the imposition of falsehood upon others.
Heaven is impartial,
yet favors those with virtue.
The people’s hearts are not constant,
but turn toward those with benevolence.
The grace of lord and father
is the root of all transformations.
I summon the worthy and urge them on,
to chastise disloyalty.

Those who cultivate the Dao
must first embrace filial piety and loyalty,
sincerity, benevolence, and virtue,
humility, deference, and reverence.
With a rectified heart, the spirit becomes luminous;
with a rectified heart, wisdom becomes numinous.
Then the immortal masters will appear,
guiding you to success.
Though one may understand the principles of the elixir,
without accumulating merit,
harming others to benefit oneself,
demons will come to obstruct the spirit.

All who study the true Dao
must refine the heart.
Practice universal generosity and relief,
rooted in benevolence.
Offer aid and benefit,
rescue the drowning and extinguish the burning,
uphold the endangered and succor the distressed,
rejoice in the Dao and hold fast to faith.
Those who cultivate such merit
shall have their names recorded in the Jade Court.
The August Emperor of Emptiness has decrees,
the *Xian* Emperor has texts,
golden precepts and jade statutes—
not a hair’s breadth of leniency.

Relieve the people’s suffering,
succor the hungry and destitute.
Of old, the Celestial Master of Han
condensed grains of rice.
When scarcity struck,
prices soared bitterly,
yet he sold at the original price,
or reduced it to aid the poor,
not raising it by even a fraction,
thus supplying the people.
The people relied on him for sustenance,
their bellies filled and bodies flourished—
Huang of Chengdu,
his name inscribed in the Purple Palace.

Of old, Lord Xu the Perfected
compounded medicines to heal the sick,
relieving all manner of suffering,
earning profound merit.
Of old, Master Ge the Immortal
performed rituals and alchemical rites,
liberating the suffering in the netherworld,
so that all sentient beings
might attain transcendence.

Now, the wealthy and noble
indulge in luxury and ease,
riding sleek horses,
while the people subsist on greens.
Who among them will relinquish wealth
to generously aid the poor?
The perfected masters of past ages
attained the Dao in their hearts.
The Three Officials examine and record,
merits and transgressions made clear:
those with merit
are recommended for immortal ascension;
those with transgressions
are bound in the netherworld as guilty souls.

Those who ascend to the heavens
have not achieved it in a single lifetime,
but through cultivation across kalpas,
their celestial nature at last revealed.
Those I have chosen,
who stand in attendance within the altar,
all bear blessings from past lives—
do not regard them lightly,
but treat them with reverence and love.

In expounding my Dharma-gate,
do not cling to a single person
and withhold the Dao from others.
All who stand within this altar
possess the root of the Dao.

Now, the foolish of this world
rashly speak of demonic possession.
Without even an inch of virtue,
they aspire to the Great Web of Heaven,
boasting of their own immortality,
indulging in excess and greed,
their cravings impure—
how can they escape the river of desire?

Those who practice my Dao
must not discriminate by high or low status,
but govern the heart with benevolence,
restrain the nature with goodness,
avoid the stains of greed and wrath,
and never seek personal convenience.
To diminish oneself in hidden cultivation
draws the affection of celestial spirits;
to refine and cultivate thus
will summon the imperial summons of the August Lord.

Now, as I expound the Dharma,
do not cling stubbornly to the *Xian* path,
but sever the dust-heart,
and the Dao-heart will lie open and serene.
Practice hidden virtue extensively,
awaken to the Three Origins.
Do not heed deluded masters
who engage in vain practices—
when the qi scatters in a single morning,
how can one become an immortal by talisman?

If this body is not cultivated now,
what other year shall one await?
Without departing from this,
the soul wanders in confusion;
without a starting point,
it drifts through the cycles of rebirth.
For your sake, lost in delusion,
my tears flow in secret—
heedless, the heart remains unresolved.

My teachings are difficult to convey:
the principle of the great elixir
is to nurture qi and harmonize the origin,
simply to settle the spirit and still the breath—
this is the return to the womb.
The true person
abides deep in the abyss,
emotion and nature as one,
the wondrous principle arising naturally.

Do not dismiss these words as distant and vague,
but believe with utmost sincerity.
Believe and practice,
and you shall stand shoulder to shoulder with the immortals and sages.

Upon hearing the Master’s discourse, the entire assembly at the altar bowed deeply. Daoist Yiyi then prostrated before the seat and offered this hymn of praise:

The Perfect Sage’s profound scroll
bestows teachings upon the altar,
illuminating the Three Teachings,
gathering the words of all sages.
Through Confucianism and Buddhism,
it clarifies our profound Way;
through loyalty and filial piety,
it opens the minds of the foolish.
Vast virtue reaches to heaven,
benevolence and mercy universally proclaimed,
rescuing all from distress and calamity.
The true essence of kindness,
greatly sagely, greatly merciful,
greatly compassionate, greatly vow-bound,
universally delivering all beings,
establishing karmic connections through scriptures.
Descending upon Jinling,
your numinous radiance shines brightly—
illness is instantly healed,
disaster is immediately dispelled,
surpassing even father and mother.
Vastly manifesting like Maudgalyāyana,
we, by karmic affinity of former lives,
have been granted to hear the Supreme Way.
Inspired by dreams, bestowed with the staff and carriage,
the subtleties of the whispered teachings
are wondrous beyond words.
Those who believe attain,
those who awaken become immortals.
With humble verses, I now extol you before the Master.
When my practice is complete in years to come,
I vow to attend your compassionate presence.

Then Daoist Yiyi, together with the assembly of disciples, bowed repeatedly before the altar, praising without end and expressing profound gratitude. They burned incense and paid homage together. Suddenly, auspicious clouds like a canopy descended before the altar, rare fragrances filled the air, and mist enveloped the earth. The Patriarch returned in his phoenix chariot, and throughout the village, all beings bowed in reverence. Each household turned toward virtue, every person engaged in cultivation. Wherever the rare fragrance reached, no illnesses arose. Every family obtained good fortune, every household manifested auspicious signs. The sagely power was resplendently revealed, and joy knew no bounds. All received the teachings with faith, paid their respects, and withdrew.

*(The above two chapters were first recorded in Jinling. Later, a child from Guangling named Tong Qi obtained them and combined them for wider circulation. Thus, the transmitted version consists of eight chapters divided into upper and lower volumes.)*

**The Supreme Lord Lǚzu’s Scripture of Opening the Celestial Pole and Verifying the True Mystery of the Closed and Open Gate**
**Lower Volume**

**Chapter Five: Faithfully Attaining the Dao**

At that time, the Immortal Master addressed the great assembly of Piling, saying: "I manifested signs across the Five Mounds and the Dragon Sands, responding to past virtues. Though my ascent and descent through the cycles of rebirth were not complete, the wondrous Dao of immortals was fully revealed. Thus, the female immortal of Tanyin in Tai Cang, Nanyang, whose original transmission traces to Tanluan, attained the immortal realm as proof of her Dao. The virtuous maiden Lian of Xiangshan County cultivated the causes and verified the fruit of Buddhahood. All achieved this by upholding faith, while those without intention attained realization.

I, by the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, descended into the mortal realm solely for the sake of sentient beings, who turn their backs on principle and violate virtue, cruelly harming others, bending the straight to crookedness, mixing flattery with benevolence, rebelling against rulers and parents above, and scorning their villages below. They fish for empty reputations, set traps to harm lives, and scheme to deceive others. As a result, the sagely ruler sends down calamities—floods, fires, plagues, and punishments—yet they do not repent or reform. Their karmic obstructions accumulate like clouds.

I have preached the scriptures in Yangzhou and Jinling. Among the assembly at the altar, barely one in a hundred believed, while countless others slandered. Unable to settle the spirit and establish destiny, they instead toy with cleverness and forget their true nature. The arts of flattery and deceit fill heaven and earth. They boast of their own abilities, delude their ancestors, and deceive the gods. Instead of quieting their minds, they indulge in karmic actions, unable to restrain themselves. They falsely depict emptiness, like a mantis brandishing its arms or a frog croaking in vain, obstructing the supreme Way. Though not without perception, they drift in the dark sea, ungrateful for the Emperor’s grace. Yangzhou was arrogant, Jinling lacked sincerity—compared to you, Piling, you must cultivate solemn reverence.

Having returned to my teachings, spread virtue and practice benevolence. Uphold filial piety, loyalty, and trust, and diminish the self to bring peace to others. All living beings, even the lowliest creatures, cherish life—do not harm them, but show compassion for all that heaven has created. Human nature is originally pure, yet obscured by external things. When the spirit is employed in the dust, it becomes dimmed by the dust.

The Way of Heaven follows its course without emotion, nurturing the myriad forms, embracing and sustaining all. The celestial body is round, with latitude and longitude. By day, it rotates from left to right; by night, from right to left. In harmony with the four seasons, it knows neither cold nor heat, creating and extinguishing the ten thousand things without awareness of creation or extinction. Existing without knowing, it endures; being without birth, it is luminous. Those who embody this may attain longevity.

The Way of longevity lies in its wondrous application by humans. Heaven relies on Earth, revolving through the great void without obstruction. Earth relies on Heaven, remaining still to adhere to qi, never falling or collapsing. Human essence is to Heaven as Earth is to Heaven, born in the Kan palace and residing within a single qi. Just as Earth revolves with Heaven to generate the myriad things, essence transforms through qi to govern the hundred bodily forms. If essence does not transform, emotional defilement causes collapse; if Earth does not revolve, extreme yin leads to ruin.

Advancing fire and retreating talisman follow Heaven’s left and right. Yin and yang grasp each other, the moon shifts within the sun. Nurture within and guard without, qi continues and spirit functions. Achieve harmony through emptiness, abiding in sincerity. The heart is not a heart—it is the spirit; qi is not breath—it is the numinous void.

Guard it like Penglai, shape it like an egg, visualize it as an unbroken ring—how dare one describe it? The Supreme Lord said: ‘Excessive speech exhausts the lunar cycle; better to abide in the center.’ Thus, one should constantly illuminate, neither scattered nor congealed. Practicing thus, the medicine circulates throughout the body. Warmly nurture the childlike pearl, and the hundred meridians flow freely. Preserve the original essence, refine the original form.

If essence is insufficient, supplement it with flavor; if form is insufficient, supplement it with qi. The southwest yields companions—this is the method for supplementing qi. Call the child with the mother, and like attracts like. Thoughts must not arise—arising brings the flame of fire; intention must not scatter—scattering brings the cold of fire.

Though the story of standing in snow at Cheng Yi’s gate pertains to events after Lǚzu’s verification of immortality, the perfected ones of the highest realms observe past and future without being bound by worldly eras. Moreover, the texts cited within this scripture, such as *Awakening to Reality* by Ziyang, are all from later times. *Entering the Medicine Realm* states: ‘Water fears drying, fire fears cold; deviate by a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form.’"

Moreover, it states: ‘Water flows, fire blazes—within the body, this can be verified for oneself. Dismiss cleverness, sever seeing and hearing; inwardly illuminate the original true, outwardly forget the use of things. Cultivate both trust and sincerity, and wisdom and stillness will naturally arise. The source of establishing trust lies in nothing but sincerity—take Yu the Great’s offering of shoes at the ruined bridge as your heart, and Cheng Yi’s standing in snow as your teaching.

Fan and Zhang’s shared meal, never forgetting their appointed time; Guan and Bao’s friendship, uncalculating of gain; Ji Zha’s hanging of his sword, serving the dead as if alive; Guo Ji’s bamboo horse, with children blocking the road—by being trustworthy to one’s lord, one must be loyal; by being trustworthy to one’s parents, one must be filial; by being trustworthy to friends, the bond must endure; by being trustworthy in affairs, harmony must prevail; by being trustworthy in Daoist cultivation, success must flourish; by being trustworthy in offering to the gods, efficacy must manifest.

Cultivation takes trust as its foundation. Clinging to doubt invites ruin; breaking trust with others brings karmic retribution from the heavenly spirits. How could the August Heaven be deceptive toward beings? The Great Dao is attained through sincerity. Those with virtue must have their words, but those with words do not necessarily have virtue. Those who attain the Dao appear foolish and dull—how could they deceive with words and diminish their fortune? Facing wealth, do not be attached to wealth; facing beauty, do not be greedy for beauty.

The work of transcending the spirit and liberating the aperture lies in extending knowledge through the investigation of things. Confucius inquired about ritual and offices, yet even the proclaimed sage found himself insufficient. Knowing is sufficient for knowledge; not knowing, do not claim attainment. Enduring humiliation will perfect the perfected one; emptying the self naturally brings benefit.

The *Transmission* says: ‘Those in peril secure their position; those on the verge of ruin preserve their existence.’ How great is the essence of the *Book of Changes*! Thus, *Kun* excels through simplicity, *Qian* through ease of understanding. Ease allows for understanding; simplicity allows for following. The principles of the world prize their mean!

Yin’s compliance and yang’s vigor arise from simplicity and achieve completion. Thus, the Dao of *Change* corresponds to the work of the elixir. Knowing the transformations of *Change*, the immortal’s path may be ascended. What, then, is this so-called ‘Golden Elixir’? Metal pertains to *Kan* Water, cinnabar pertains to *Li* Fire. *Li* Fire corresponds to the heart—not the heart of blood and flesh, but the original spirit; *Kan* Water corresponds to essence—not the essence of intercourse, but the prenatal metal.

With spirit moving essence, essence does not fly or soar—when it neither flies nor soars, it is called original essence. This original essence is the root of life’s numinous power. Thus, the Returned Elixir means returning to the heart. When external realms do not delude, internal realms naturally clarify. The heart is the elixir; the elixir is the heart. Those who awaken to this may preserve the cinnabar heart. The cinnabar heart is the Dao; the cinnabar Dao is the heart.

Breath rests in the womb; the womb persists through breath. Breath arises from the heart; when the heart is still, breath merges. The Dao of regulating breath lies in each breath returning to the root. The root is not a root—it arises from *qi*; to preserve is to preserve nothing, to preserve the One within.

It penetrates the Mysterious Female and reaches the Celestial Court. If you are not thoroughly versed, do not speak of profound depths! If you can practice this, the empty valley transmits sound—not that the valley gains sound, but that emptiness makes it vast. By emptying external realms, the Six Demons conceal their forms.”

Then he spoke the incantation, saying:
Alas, those in the red dust,
All drowned in profit and fame,
Unknowing of preserving life’s nature,
Idly debating death and life.
Failing to examine the mechanism of life and death,
Vainly exhausting life’s nature.
Learning death before death,
Encountering life, they kill life.
All things live and die,
The original spirit dies and lives again.
If this life is not resolved in the dust,
Reciting myriad scriptures is in vain.
Only by exhausting all conditions
Can the host of thoughts be emptied.
The sword of wisdom can slay demons;
When demons are pacified, the Great Dao shines.
Without ascending the nine-tiered terrace,
How can one see the empty sky?
People of this age rely on mouth to speak,
The mouth may speak, but the heart cannot.
Not from the mouth, but from the heart—
From the heart, the Dao naturally forms.
How can one act from the heart?
I shall pour forth lead and mercury.

When the Immortal Master finished expounding the scripture, he again addressed the assembly, saying: “If there are beings who see or hear this scripture and embody its practice, the Three Corpses will retreat afar, all demonic influences will not intrude, and the myriad spirits will grant their protection. Only by distancing oneself from worldly affairs and guarding the heart to stabilize the nature can one ascend the immortal’s ranks.

There are also the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit—profound and arcane texts, the essentials of returning to the root, altogether completing eight grades, symbolizing the meaning of the *Changes*’ Two Modes and Six Voids. You have accumulated benevolence and cultivated virtue; I shall universally bestow this upon the world. If in each altar there is jealousy, arrogance, or pride, this immortal mechanism cannot be transmitted. The place for judging the scripture has not yet been selected; only those who sincerely take refuge in me may receive it. You must faithfully accept it, and I will surely manifest my numinous power. Upon encountering the subsequent three scriptures, Penglai will come to you.”

The Master finished expounding the scripture.

Amidst this, auspicious clouds descended from the heavens, phoenixes soared and cranes danced, while observers near and far—fifteen hundred in number—each bowed in reverence to the empty sky, received the teaching in faith, and withdrew.

**Chapter Six: Preserving Essence and Securing Life** *(From the sixth to the eighth chapters, no titles were originally given during the first exposition. Later, Patriarch Lü reviewed and corrected the prayers, adding chapter names to match the first five.)*

At that time, the Immortal Master spoke: “In a former kalpa, during the first year of the Tianbao era, on the ninth day of the first month, I ascended the Yu Luo Void Brahma Heavenly Palace and attended the *Xu Huang* Heavenly Worthy—*Xu Huang* being the Primordial Beginning—alongside the Ten Ultimate Perfected Ones, where the *Great Zhou Scripture of Cinnabar Alchemy for Subduing Fire* was expounded. At that time, boundless sacred assemblies from the ten directions, the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Three Realms and Five Peaks, along with exalted perfected beings of wondrous conduct, all gathered in the Cloud Palace to hear the great Dharma.

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembled perfected ones, saying: ‘Because the people of the world, sunk in karmic delusion, drown in the sea of desire, I have repeatedly dispatched perfected beings of wondrous conduct, along with the host of immortals, to descend into the mortal realm and disseminate the *Great Vehicle Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation in All Its Chapters*, eighteen thousand scrolls in all, scattered across the four great divine continents of the world. Yet the blind multitudes of the four seas know only to chant its words, failing to awaken to its power. Their flattery lacks sincerity, their transgressions accumulate day by day, their hearts harbor the three poisons and their mouths the four faults. They fall into the turning wheel of retribution, their bones lost in the rushing torrent of suffering, ensnared by the hindrances of hell, cast into the destinies of beasts, and find it difficult to regain human form. Born from evil retribution, they clog the cosmos, beyond all hope of deliverance—deeply pitiable indeed.’”

At my great-grandfather’s time, he served as Military Commissioner of Zhejiang East; my grandfather was Vice Minister of Rites; and my father was Prefect of Haizhou. The Perfected One again instructed me, saying: ‘You have repeatedly cultivated the Dao and virtue, your name inscribed in the registers of immortality, your merit and conduct now complete, revered by all the Heavenly Worthies. Yet your worldly ties remain unsevered, and so in the future world of the Tang’s latter age, in the fourteenth year of the Zhenyuan reign, the wu-yin year, on the fourteenth day of the fourth month at the si hour, you shall be born a son in the Lü family of Henan. I command the Three Perfected—Kuzhu, Huolong, and Zhengyang—to transmit and confer the Dao upon you, that you may ascend the ranks of immortality. You shall incarnate in the world to propagate my teachings and guide all celestial and mortal beings back to the true teaching.’

I received the mandate and took birth in the Lü household. From childhood I was precocious, understanding filial piety and fraternal duty, careful in speech and action, moderating joy and anger, and urging my father to distribute grain to relieve famine. Later, when I set out for the examinations, I encountered the Perfected Master Zhengyang. In a dream of millet, I awoke to his teachings, abandoned office to cultivate the real, and my name was enrolled on Penglai, where I attend the Golden Gates of the Jade Emperor’s palace.

Again I received the August Emperor’s decree to rescue the deluded world, expound scriptures, and transform and deliver beings. I demonstrated the stages of nature and life, exhorted the roots of loyalty and filial piety, and with my fellow immortals compiled this scripture into eight chapters: the first and second chapters I left in Guangling; the third and fourth I entrusted to Jinling; the fifth I taught to the assemblies of Piling and others. Now I descend with the refined qi of the sixth and seventh chapters to Xinzhou, conferring them upon your assembly. The remaining eighth chapter, with its methods for refining spirit and returning to emptiness, its numinous talismans and true incantations, I shall transmit in Linjiang, keeping it secret and uncirculated. I instruct each locale to carve and print the complete scripture for exchange. Those of sincere faith shall find it efficacious; those who obscure its principles shall remain benighted. Yet I seal not the scripture but your heart—those who awaken shall attain it, those who comprehend shall achieve it.

Within these *Eight-Chapter Scriptures*, each passage soothes the numinous, refines form and preserves the body, stills qi and nurtures spirit. Though its phrases are plain and its principles unadorned, those who grasp its meaning shall propagate it widely. Essence, qi, and spirit are called the Three Numinous. Original essence and lustful essence are not two essences; original qi and the qi of respiration are fundamentally one qi. The heart is originally empty, yet nature has no dual substance. The great void is vast and bright—if you would transform essence, first guard your nature; if you would regulate qi, first empty your heart. In movement, nurture qi; in stillness, refine emptiness. Respond without acting, awaken without following.

Thus, through extreme emptiness and profound stillness, qi turns and spirit returns—not to be sought through merit and virtue, nor achieved through righteousness and ritual. If you practice righteousness, ritual, merit, and virtue, these are but embellishments of the dust. Embrace the origin, nurture simplicity, forget things and contain emptiness. In the midst of profound obscurity, true essence shall return of itself. Essence has no fixed abode; it dissipates through emotion. If essence does not follow desire, it fortifies the foundation of your numinous being. Through original essence it transforms into original mercury; through original qi it accumulates the bodily shell. The kidneys are the mansion where essence lodges; the heart contains the domain of original qi. Essence permeates the five viscera—if drowned in emotion, it becomes lustful; qi flows through the six bowels—if it departs the apertures, it is drawn in and exhaled.

If you do not know how to nurture qi, essence cannot be cultivated; if you do not know how to preserve essence, qi cannot return. When qi returns to the original sea, essence is preserved; when qi scatters through the six gates, essence flies away. Though the kidneys are the cavern where essence resides, it is spirit that moves essence. Thunder arises from the depths of water—yin harbors yang to form *zhun*; water moistens beneath the mountain—yang spreads through yin to form *meng*. Without knowing fermentation, fire dries and explodes; without understanding refinement, metal drowns and fails to ascend.

People of this world, blind and deaf, claim to see what they do not see, to hear what they do not hear. Deluded by fame and profit, they indulge in arrogance; dazzled by the five colors, they are ruined by the five sounds. Cultivate blood and refine essence to preserve your numinous root. The true marrow of the red tortoise transforms into *geng* and *xin*; the yellow sprout emerges from the earth to unite with *qian* and *kun*. The two qi of heart and kidney come and go, swallowing each other. The right kidney pertains to yin and is the seat of the *po*; the left kidney pertains to yang and is the seat of the *hun*. The lungs transmit the heart’s fluids to moisten the kidneys; the liver gathers original essence to nourish the heart. When the kidneys are cultivated, the tortoise retracts its head; when the heart is nurtured, the dragon conceals its scales. If spirit does not shift in countenance, essence is preserved; if essence does not scatter through desire, qi harmonizes.

Restrain the full belly to one, reveal the empty heart to the numinous. Refine it with gentle fire, nurture it with arid effort. Now soaring, now hidden; now forgotten, now preserved. Use it without exhaustion, guard it without congealing. Thus being and non-being give rise to each other, difficulty and ease complete each other. The tiger’s breast bears metal—when kidney qi is sufficient, liver qi is born. Through liver qi, the residual yin of the kidneys is severed, and kidney qi passing through the liver becomes pure yang. The dragon’s tally bears fire—when heart fluids prevail, lung fluids flourish. Through lung fluids, the residual yang of the heart is severed, and heart fluids passing through the lungs become pure yin. Within yin, refine yang; within yang, refine yin. Draw water from the kidneys, extract metal from qi. The nature of metal is heavy and fond of sinking—thus it moistens downward and readily leaks; the nature of fire is light and fond of rising—thus it flames upward and readily scorches. Use metal to restrain fire, the heavy to restrain the light.

After the winter solstice, yang ascends from the earth, and the earth withdraws its yin. Greater yin is withdrawn to become reverting yin; lesser yang is added to become yang brightness. Reverting yin is withdrawn to become lesser yin; yang brightness is added to become greater yang. After the summer solstice, yin descends from heaven, and heaven withdraws its yang. Greater yang is withdrawn to become yang brightness; lesser yin is added to become reverting yin. Yang brightness is withdrawn to become lesser yang; reverting yin is added to become greater yin. As the sun bestows its spirit upon the moon and the moon receives the sun’s essence, so too with withdrawal and addition—those of wisdom must understand. Use water to restrain fire, and fire shall have no fault of scorching wood; use fire to restrain water, and water shall have the merit of activating metal.

Still the heart and take seated meditation as your method—if the heart is not stilled, you shall be troubled by demons. Nurture qi and take reticence in speech as your duty—if reticence slackens, you shall be deluded by evil. Solidify your essence—not through the transformation of qi, or essence shall drown and bring harm...

Nurture your qi, yet without grasping the root of essence, and qi shall be difficult to manifest. Thus we know: essence governs qi, qi governs spirit, and spirit unites with emptiness—only then are the Three Powers accomplished.

Thereupon he spoke this gatha:
One is the root of Heaven and Earth,
All beings depend on its life-giving power.
From the One, the Three unfold all transformations.
Proclaimed as Heaven, Earth, and Human—
Human, the spirit among the ten thousand things.
The Three Powers reside within this body,
Yet what does this body treasure?
Its treasure is essence, qi, and spirit.

Earth was not yet split from yin,
Yet within it lay true yang.
Heaven was not yet split from yang,
Yet within it lay true yin.
Humans embody both yin and yang—
Why not refine your true nature?
The world, deluded, remains unawakened,
Abandoning the root to chase illusions.

I recall my own transformation in the womb,
Achieved through sudden severance.
Form merged with the body of emptiness,
Only then was I called "feather-transcended."

Pitying the world’s suffering,
I preach the Dao to the blind and deaf.
Yet the blind remain sightless,
The deaf still do not hear.
Living in vain, they die in vain,
Trapped in the wheel of karmic delusion.
If only they would trust and cultivate the heart,
I would guide them to ascend.

Soon the immortal writ shall descend,
Fish and dragons shall discern false from true.
Only when you awaken to Heaven and Earth’s principles
May you be called a true person.

The immortal master again addressed the assembly:
"This scripture I expound is the treasure of essence.
Whoever believes and receives it shall realize the true origin.
Where this scripture remains, those who cultivate the Dao in seclusion—
One thousand one hundred shall attain the fruit,
Five hundred more shall be summoned to verify immortal rank.
Each shall receive transmission
And ascend to the celestial capital,
All promoted in heavenly office.
Now still your hearts, regulate your qi,
Refine spirit, and nurture emptiness.
Based on your diligent practice,
I shall again memorialize on your behalf."

The assembly bowed their heads to the perfected master and withdrew with reverence.

**Chapter Seven: Qi Harmonizes with the Primordial Origin**

At that time, the immortal master spoke again:
"The Yellow Emperor’s admonition states: *'Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movements of Heaven.'*
These two phrases come from the *Yin Fu Jing*. Those who honor them may attain longevity.

Heaven and Earth transform through qi; yin and yang rise and fall, woven with warp and weft, cold and heat succeeding one another. Let me illustrate for you—listen carefully:

The path the sun traverses is called the *Yellow Way*. Threading across the celestial belly, bisecting the two poles, is the *Red Way*, which evenly divides the celestial body. At the cusp of spring and summer, yang reaches its peak and generates yin. The celestial motion quickens, its qi pure, thus five days make a *hou*, three *hou* make a *qi*, six *qi* make a season, and four seasons make a year. In one year, there are three hundred and sixty *hou*, where true qi gathers and coalesces. Within it lie eighty-four thousand harmonious breaths: forty-two thousand ascend to the yang position above, and forty-two thousand descend to the yin position below. Though Heaven is yang, it harbors true yin; though Earth is yin, it emits true yang.

At the winter solstice, qi arises from yang, a single breath ascending seven thousand *li*. Following this, six breaths ascend forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the yin position—thus the qi remains warm. Corresponding to the spring equinox, it ascends another six breaths, yang qi reaching its extreme, and the qi becomes scorching hot at the summer solstice. At the summer solstice, yin qi emerges from Heaven, a single breath descending seven thousand *li*. Following this, six breaths descend forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the yang position—thus the qi turns crisp and cool at the autumn equinox. Descending another six breaths, yin qi reaches its extreme, and the qi grows bitterly cold at the winter solstice.

Yin and yang intermingle, the two breaths succeeding one another. Within yang there is yin, which descends until it reaches the extreme of yang; within yin there is yang, which ascends until it reaches the extreme of yin. Yang and yin nurture one another, perpetually enduring since ancient times.

Humankind embodies the Two Modes; qi coalesces from father and mother. The heart encircles the Dipper’s pivot, form unites with spirit, Heaven holds the Dipper’s mechanism, and humans hold the heart’s axis. The heart has two cavities: the left *xuan* and the right *pin*, descending into the Sea of Contract and ascending to the *Xuan* Void. The cauldron of yin and yang is truly governed by the heart. Within yang’s yin, the pure sage and the deluded fool diverge.

Above the heart’s axis, the Celestial Origin presides; below it, the Terrestrial Origin presides. Flowing and transforming, they harmonize with the Two Modes. Heaven’s One generates water, which in humans is called *essence*; Earth’s Two generates fire, which in humans is called *spirit*; Heaven’s Three generates wood, which in humans is called *hun*; Earth’s Four generates metal, which in humans is called *po*; Heaven’s Five generates earth, which in humans is called *body*. The Five Phases merge into one, the Three Ultimates congeal and reside, the Two Modes nurture and transform, and the sea yields luminous pearls.

The kidneys are the palace of essence, yang within yin. Essence receives from yang; when gathered and numinous, it is called *po*. It follows the sun as the moon does—likened to humans, the *hun* nurtures the *po*. Qi receives from yang; when dispersed and spiritual, it is called *hun*. The moon’s substance receives from the sun—likened to humans, the *po* restrains the *hun*. Yin and yang nurture and transform, the two breaths’ inherent capacity. Heaven obtains qi and achieves completion; Earth obtains qi and flourishes; humans obtain qi and may attain longevity.

Preserve the true form, and form and spirit will naturally become numinous. Forget words and still thoughts, guard the blood and refine essence. Spirit refines qi, and qi conceals spirit. The true master of the Fiery Wheel sits enthroned in the Central Palace. Let the heart be as empty as space, and qi will naturally become numinous. The Yellow Sprout emerges from the earth—its wondrous principle must be fathomed.

Emptiness is free of dust and color; the Dao arises from the Qian Palace. Still the spirit and qi, nurture the root’s numinosity. The kidneys possess one hundred ninety-two strands of silk threads. Refine lead to return to *hong*, and *hong* transforms into spirit’s nourishment. From the radiant great sea, a red rooster takes flight.

Kidney qi transmits to the liver, liver qi transmits to the heart, and heart *hong* descends to unite—like the sun bestowing virtue, the moon spreading its light. Yang governs, yin receives, and the feminine and masculine require one another. Ever compliant with Earth’s principles, they bear Heaven’s proclamation.

Let the heart constantly govern qi, and qi will merge and essence transform. Let the heart constantly attend to breath, and spirit will abide while qi lingers. Above, refine *xuan* essence to replenish the brain; in the middle, refine primordial essence to replenish spirit; below, refine golden essence to replenish the kidneys. Above, regulate spirit; in the middle, regulate qi; below, regulate essence.

Essence is not essence—it is formed by qi. Qi is not qi—it is nurtured by spirit. If essence and qi crumble, how can spirit find peace? Preserving essence is called *ming*; guarding spirit is called *xing*. Qi belongs to the Yellow Matriarch, who regulates spirit and governs essence, binding them as three companions. Water and fire balance evenly—likened to a matchmaker harmonizing marriage.

The *Xuan* Pearl is produced and settled; fix the intent and gather the true. Heaven’s essence and Earth’s marrow, metal floats and wood sinks. Firelight illuminates metal, and metal’s qi floats in the void, ascending to the Purple Palace. The wall shatters the mountain pass, the River Chariot ascends and descends. The dog transforms and the chicken ascends; stripping and returning, obstruction and peace, crescent and full, darkness and light. Yin and yang wax and wane; the water of Kan and golden essence. Blood transforms into white cream, and the universe is established anew.

The Cinnabar Field surges with fire, true qi steaming and fuming. Cook lead and refine mercury—Wood Mother and Metal Duke. The two eights meet at *ren* and *bing*; the one and three refine at *jia* and *geng*. The pivot of *xing* and *ming*, the work of inversion—phoenix carriage and simurgh palanquin, jade hall and cinnabar palace. Plant millet in the sea of pearls, raise the red dragon from the deep pool. The earth’s thunder shakes, Heaven’s rain nourishes. Dragon lurks and tiger crouches; govern cold and warmth. From nothing, something arises—its principle wondrous, its mechanism profound. The six caves are free of dust, the three terraces gleam bright. Ten thousand spirits pay homage to the ancestor; a single qi returns to the root.

The Primordial Sovereign of the Great One dwells in the Mud Pill Palace, grasping her child qi and drawing in the numinous light to ascend. Unmoved by thunder’s roar or the blade’s edge, played by the flute without holes, strummed by the zither without strings."

Alas! When the heart overcomes the realm, one becomes immortal; when the realm overcomes the heart, one remains human. You must learn death before death comes, for life and death arise in every encounter. The world does not awaken—let me instruct you again and again.

If you shed your emotions and perceptions, qi will naturally be attained; if you guard your emptiness and numinosity, spirit will naturally become clear. When spirit clings to the realm, qi scatters; when spirit returns to its chamber, qi harmonizes. When qi penetrates the joints, it is like wind moving through mist; when qi flows through the meridians, it is like the sea roaring with thunder. When true qi is abundant, one is ever sated; when the heart’s qi is refreshed, dreams are clear. Sweat and tears cease as proof; gold and treasures manifest as accomplishment.

With exhalation and inhalation, dry mercury resists the invasion of cold and heat. Heavenly flowers scatter in profusion; auspicious qi swirls in abundance. Guard non-action, and qi transforms of itself; practice non-concern, and merit is achieved of itself. This can only be verified in the heart—do not seek confirmation through the eyes. If you observe with the eyes, the realm will be stained by demonic intrusion.

If the heart does not preside over stillness, the Dao cannot be stabilized; if qi does not circulate, the true cannot be preserved. When in movement one is unaware of movement, one transcends movement; when in stillness one is unaware of stillness, one emerges from stillness. Utter emptiness gives rise to clarity; utter clarity gives rise to luminosity. Emptiness and clarity lead to forgetting—shattering the void of space.

Again, a gatha is spoken:
In movement, move spirit and qi;
In stillness, still the heart and intent.
When the six viscera’s qi harmonizes,
How dare the Three Corpses linger?

Forgetting both, neither arises;
Regulate breath with true wisdom.
Preserve your essence and qi’s flourishing,
Then spirit may dwell within.

In daily life’s movement and stillness,
All are burdened by spirit.
When movement and stillness both are forgotten,
Refine spirit to abide in the world.

Sinking with things, drowned in drift,
Spirit is cast aside by the realm.
If you do not nurture essence and qi,
How can spirit find its dwelling?

Refining qi and refining essence,
Qi and spirit ever guide.
When qi gathers, form endures;
When spirit scatters, form is wasted.

To know the way of preserving spirit:
Do not let essence and qi part.
Ponder this again and again—
Lest you fall into the dark abyss.

When the Immortal Master finished expounding the seven ranks, a white crane cried in the sky, and golden light swirled around the chamber. This scripture commands all to keep it secret.

When the teachings are verified through our assemblies’ collective experience, only then may they be transmitted. Once the scripture is complete and published, it shall be left to transform all beings. Should one print and distribute hundreds of thousands or millions of copies, spreading them throughout the cosmos to propagate our teachings, I shall surely report this to the Supreme Emperor, and their name shall be inscribed in the Immortal Palace. Should one defile or destroy these scriptures, their crimes shall be recorded in the Black Register, and they shall forever fall into the Three Wretched Realms.

I embody Heaven’s decree to transform and deliver the benighted masses, rectify demons, and expound the Dao. By the grace of the Two Marshals, Ma and Guan, the merits of these scriptures are examined. Those who cultivate faith and insight shall surely ascend the immortal ranks and be guided to liberation; those who profane the sacred and slander the scriptures shall be secretly observed by celestial spirits, and their sins shall be indelibly recorded.

You who safeguard these texts must await the one who shall greatly propagate my teachings. Do not shrink from distance or hardship—attend and receive this wondrous Dharma.

When the Master finished his discourse, all present bowed in reverence and withdrew.

*(The above two ranks were recorded in Xinzhou.)*

**The Eighth Rank: Divine Transformation and Non-Action**

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning was in the Seven Jeweled Grove, expounding the esoteric principles of the Numinous Spring Elixir and the True One’s mysterious mechanism to the assembled immortals. From the grotto-heavens came hosts of immortals, the boundless sagely multitude, spirit maidens, and jade maidens, each bearing banners and canopies, all listening to the wondrous Dharma.

The Heavenly Worthy then ascended his jeweled throne, holding a ruyi scepter. He emitted a great radiance that illuminated the ten directions, all realms, the Brahma-palaces, golden immortals, great bodhisattvas, the hosts of the Three Realms, and the Eight Legions of Devas and Dragons. Each rode upon cloud chariots, filling the space before the assembly. By this light, the Nine Heavens became unimpeded, and the earth and sky were utterly bright. All beings—flying, walking, hidden, or lurking—were gathered and transformed.

Suddenly, a miasma of calamity and resentment from below arose and coiled around the Jeweled Grove, obscuring it without dissipating. The celestial hosts, filled with dread, prostrated themselves before the Dao and entreated the Dharma’s decree.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “This foul qi now chokes the Dao’s realm, for the people below are disloyal, unfilial, unrighteous, and unkind. They harbor jealousy, deceit, and cunning; they scheme with treacherous hearts, harm others for personal gain, and thus provoke the Nine Heavenly Patrols and the daily inspecting deities to report their transgressions. The Jade Emperor, enraged, has sent down plagues, locusts, and famines, causing the people to suffer alternating droughts and floods, that they might awaken to worldly dust, reflect, and reform. Yet the people, unaware, only grow resentful, slander the sacred, and rage against Heaven and Earth. Thus, this stagnant qi rises to the celestial court, and such ignorance only deepens demonic obstructions.”

The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct stepped forward, prostrated himself, and bowed in reverence. “Heavenly Worthy, your compassion shelters all beings. The world’s karmic delusions blind them—we beseech your mercy and deliverance.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “The officials of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways have witnessed the grave disasters across the Four Continents and pleaded with the Jade Emperor to pity and save the multitudes. He has already dispatched the Perfected One of Penetrating Wonder and Blessing to descend, expound the scriptures, and deliver the deluded. Yet the beings of the karmic sea remain obstinate, refusing to cultivate goodness, vainly seeking wealth and fortune, entangled in greed and attachment, mired in strife between self and others, and entangled in endless disputes. They regard the scriptures of admonition as mere scrap paper, and their karmic roots grow heavier by the day, making deliverance ever more difficult.”

Hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, all the celestial hosts prostrated themselves in the grove, weeping in sorrow. They entreated the Heavenly Worthy: “The children of the mortal realm are blinded by desire, tormented in life, and upon death, they fall into hell without end. We humbly implore your divine compassion and majestic transformation to issue talismans and absolutions, that Dao and qi may harmonize, and your sagely presence descend to extinguish all calamities.”

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “The world’s defilements are too entrenched for me to descend. Instead, I shall again send the Perfected Lord Lü to transform and deliver the multitudes. The deeds of good and evil in the human realm shall be reported monthly. Those who reform shall have their blessings increased and their descendants prosper; those who persist in evil shall be struck by misfortune, and their households shall perish. Thus shall Heaven’s judgment be made manifest, to admonish the floating dust of the world.”

The Perfected Lord Lü received the decree, bowed in gratitude for Heaven’s grace, and took leave of the precious grove. With the divine power of wisdom, he mounted a crane and drove a cloud-chariot. Arriving at Miaoyinding Village in Linjiang Prefecture, he saw from afar the Moonbright Hermitage, where Li Changpeng sat in meditation, cultivating the study of the True and Unwavering One. Thereupon, he manifested his form within the hermitage and instructed him to prepare the planchette. Hearing his master’s words, Changpeng burned incense and bowed a hundred times, then set out the sand-filled planchette. The Perfected Lord descended at once.

He recounted the earlier discourse and further addressed Changpeng: “By the Emperor’s command, I traverse the Five Mounds, the Four Seas, the Eight Wildernesses, and the Nine Provinces, spreading the teachings and expounding the scriptures, drifting through the turbid world to transform and deliver its people. Yet human hearts grow arrogant and heedless of past transgressions, deluded by illusions and mired in wrongdoing, coveting only worldly wealth while neglecting virtuous deeds. Though one or two may yearn for the Way, they are led astray by false teachers and fall back into the wheel of rebirth. I pity those whose hearts teeter on the brink, where Heaven’s principle remains obscured, the Dao unopened, and the dust of the world fills them first. Only when impermanence arrives do their forms return to the earth, their souls scatter in the sky, water and fire part, and they enter the four modes of birth, threading through the six paths. From kalpa to kalpa they fall, struggling to regain their original nature. None remain to teach them the refinement of spirit and return to emptiness.”

Upon hearing these teachings, Chang Peng bowed again before the master’s seat. "This disciple is fortunate to have met such affinity, blessed by your descent, Master. I humbly beseech you to impart the Way of refining spirit. May I embody its practice, and by your compassion, be delivered and saved."

The Perfected One replied: "Those in the world who study the arcane daily yearn for immortality, yet they do not cultivate their inherent nature, nor refine mercury and lead. They covet external phenomena, losing the true source in confusion, debating right and wrong, and clinging to unwholesome practices. They do not know that cultivating the heart *is* the Way. When the heart does not wander outward, the spirit naturally settles; when the spirit settles, qi harmonizes; when qi harmonizes, the elixir coalesces. Opening and unobstructing form the foundation; seeing one’s nature is the root. Present yet unobscured, it flows in and out like a gentle stream. The wondrous principle of the Great Void and the ceaseless Dao-qi interweave.

"Expansive discourse is inferior to nurturing simplicity; many arguments are not as good as embracing the origin. Radiant in all four directions, as if dwelling somewhere; steadfast in the Three Fields, securing my root. Preserve the horn, and life arises; guard the true, and numinosity manifests. Essence is the root of spirit; qi is the master of spirit; form is the dwelling of spirit. When spirit is overused, it collapses; when overworked, it perishes. What lives is spirit; what the form relies upon is qi. Being arises from non-being; form follows where spirit abides.

"Work diligently in the field of the heart, casting aside worldly concerns. Return to simplicity and restore purity; protect the true qi. Like a burning candle, when the wax is spent, the flame dies; like drawing water from a well, if the bucket leaks, the water drains. Eliminate passions and desires; let your aspiration rest in silence. Abide in serene stillness, and the movement of breath continues unbroken. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir may form, and the eyes gain luminosity, revealing my true self. After six years without leakage, the middle elixir may form, the original spirit gradually emerges, and the great Dao becomes manifest. After nine years without leakage, the great elixir is perfected. I ascend and soar of my own accord, my body joining the ranks of immortals.

"Those who master qi remain spiritually clear and do not die; their forms ascend to heaven. Those who are mastered by the world grow turbid in qi and perish; their bodies are lost in the springs. Know life, and you escape the suffering of death; study death, and you find the source of life. Not seeing within seeing is called numinous manifestation; clinging to seeing within seeing is called demonic entanglement. On exhalation, do not entangle with the ten thousand conditions; on inhalation, do not drown in desiccation or bias.

"Spirit is the child of qi; qi is the mother of spirit. Spirit and qi pursue one another; form and shadow follow. Once the womb-mother is formed, the spirit-child naturally abides. Constantly embrace your spirit to preserve your form. If the master is present, how can the house collapse? Tend to it regularly, patching leaks and blocking wind. The four great illusory bodies are but a sack of pus and blood—a filthy, turbid form—how can it ascend? Clinging to appearances and refining illusions wastes effort in cultivation.

"The true Way nurtures spirit; the false way nurtures form. Within, preserve life and destiny; without, go against worldly sentiments. Yin virtue subdues ghosts; yang virtue subdues people. When both virtues are complete, the fruition of the Way may be achieved. Sever ties to smoke and fire, extinguish the heart of greed and attachment. Cultivate life and destiny within; accumulate hidden merit without. In movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, remain in the stability of emptiness and numinosity.

"If, while sitting, the heart is driven by external things, such sitting is merely refining 'stubborn emptiness.' What is called extraordinary is the body beyond the body; what is called accomplishment is the shattering of empty space. The ancestral scriptures say: 'To know emptiness as not empty is called illumination.' To see without thinking, to attain without effort, spirit comprehends and intention aligns—one penetration unites all.

"Still and unmoving, this is the substance of the mysterious pass. Moved, it responds accordingly—this is the function of the mysterious pass. When the body does not move, qi is drawn; when the heart does not move, spirit is replenished. When spirit is subtle and qi gathers, this is called returning to the origin. Using stillness to govern stillness is called 'civil refinement'; using stillness to govern movement is called 'martial tempering.' Suddenly ceasing the ten thousand conditions is called 'forming the embryo'; embracing the origin and returning to emptiness is called 'hatching the embryo.'

"Do not cling to sounds or seek bodily benefit; do not cling to appearances or attach to things. Without clinging to the four directions, the mysterious pass may be attained! The true mechanism responds wondrously—speech and silence, seeing and hearing—within the square inch, clarity abides. Distinguish substance and function; body, heart, and intention unite. The three families gather together; emptiness and stillness, emptiness of heart—respond and resonate accordingly.

"The primordial essence of the prior heavens is empty, void, and formless. The way of replenishment belongs entirely to the Yellow Court. It is like a marionette: the strings pull, and the form moves. You must know that the mechanism of movement lies in the hand that holds it. When the hand embodies the true, you fully understand its operation and perceive things without delusion. Like a lotus floating on still water, when the treasure of life is formed, the pearl of nature shines brilliantly. Hidden and manifest support one another; being and non-being interweave.

"Spirit is fundamentally empty; the Dao is fundamentally still. Thus, emptiness is without obstruction; stillness is without desire. Preserve my life and destiny; observe transformation and know return. Within the cosmos, among the three powers, all forms accord with the Dao; all things contain numinosity. Generation upon generation, transformation upon transformation—seek within and understand for yourself. Follow the Way of heaven, and my heart does not cease. Act without contrivance; follow the Way of earth to bear all things. My body is still and does not grasp; it is the mechanism of heaven and earth’s opening and closing. The pivot of my heart’s movement and stillness—subdue body and heart, model heaven and earth.

"The Most High said: 'To honor life is to lighten death.' Only non-being surpasses valuing life. Destiny is burdened by the body and bound to life and death; nature is enslaved by the heart and subject to rising and sinking. Destiny is firm when the heart is empty; the Dao is hidden and nameless. Returning to round brightness and the origin, all kalpas are empty. When the body is stable, form is firm—firm form completes destiny. When the heart is stable, spirit is whole—whole spirit completes nature. When spirit is whole and the horn is firm, embracing the origin may be achieved.

"Severing thoughts is the essence of nurturing the fire; embodying emptiness is the work of refining the medicine. The Kun body and the Qian heart are the root of returning to life. Who guards the Flowery Pond? Who bears the Purple Palace? The double passes of the spine—able to descend and ascend—qi surges through the joints. Essence fills and spirit congeals; the valley of emptiness completes the four seasons.

"The Way of heaven and earth turns things without sentiment, penetrating unity through repeated emptiness."

The teachings of Yan [Hui] and Zeng [Shen], the coarse meal and water, the bent arm for a pillow—Confucius found joy therein. Ziyang said: *"The primal qi unfolds in creation, its true wonder boundless. Who presides over this? The work of the Uncarved."*

The deer circulates [qi] through the *weilu* to connect with the *Du* vessel; the tortoise circulates breath through the nostrils to connect with the *Ren* vessel. The crane unites through qi, the tortoise unites through spirit. Without reckless exertion, daily cultivation renews monthly—celestial stars and earthly tides form of themselves.

To guard the yang is to guard the *hun*; to guard the yin is to guard the *po*. Thus the perfected one refines the *hun* to merge with the *po*, wisdom arising from obscurity, supreme stability congealing the spirit. Golden form and jade substance arise from the completion of essence. When the great medicine ripens, the body becomes light as flight.

In leisure, celestial music—pure as bamboo’s song—wraps in swirling clouds of color, stepping steadily toward the Southern Palace. Once I received my teacher’s instruction and attained this immortal fruition.

The method of cultivation: build your elixir foundation, dig the well to seek lead, gather mercury to refine cinnabar. The stone foot’s clear spring—use no杂 impurities. One qi, two modes; the three powers shaped in the crucible. Choose renowned mountains, and good companions to aid your endeavor. Still, seek a high Daoist master to perform the rites and recite the scriptures: *The Jade Emperor’s Pivot*, *The Three Primordials of True Martial*, *The Northern and Southern Dipper Scriptures*. Recite the cavern chapters to dispel defilements and impure vapors.

At the outset of entering the chamber, change into fresh garments. Ancient immortals ascended, leaving their elixir wells as a testament. The altar’s construction and arrangement shall be instructed separately. Refine with precision and perseverance, embracing the root to return to emptiness.

This scripture endures in the world, revealing all celestial mechanisms. In silent, steadfast cultivation, the spirit ascends to the Purple Tenuity. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, the jade edict comes to bear you away.

Here now the gatha declares:
Preserve essence to guard the true—
the body at peace, free of desire.
Preserve qi to nourish the heart—
the heart still, cut off from things.
Preserve spirit to return to emptiness;
emptiness extreme, stillness profound.
Water flows and grows turbid;
water congeals and clears itself.
Movement and stillness belong to the heart—
when the heart is still, the Dao is bright.
Qi gathers like a fetus,
subdued within the mother’s womb.
After ten months, qi is released—
within the body, another body.
One morning it emerges,
parting from the mother.

Nowadays, those who refine the elixir
see black clouds veil the sky.
Without the wind of wisdom,
sun and moon are shrouded in haze.
One yin gives rise to anger;
one yang gives rise to desire.
Anger arises from qi;
desire blazes from essence.
Drawn by external objects,
they lose their north and south.
Ignorant of life and death,
all because of love and desire.
Suppress desire, halt thoughts,
curb anger, restrain the heart.
When the heart is at peace, qi harmonizes;
when qi harmonizes, spirit clarifies.
Embrace the origin, guard the One—
transcend the three realms’ emptiness,
unfettered and free,
the body ranked among heaven’s courts.
Not a thread clings,
all ten thousand miles shine clear.

The Perfected One again addressed Chang Peng:
“What I have now spoken is the *Cloudy Satchel of the Numinous Spring’s Cinnabar Edict*, the wondrous scripture of refining and transforming spirit and emptiness. To all who take refuge, it may be transmitted with a vow to heaven. If one encounters the unworthy, it must not be recklessly bestowed.”

"Together we ascend the Five Mounds, jointly perfecting the Eight Grades. Though wisdom illumines the cosmos, those of steadfast faith are few. The Youth of Crane City, named Qi Xu, deeply reveres my Way. He has gathered all my scriptures, universally uniting them as one, and has printed them to exhort others. In delivering the Xu lineage, his merit and realization are no small matter. Should he print and distribute hundreds of thousands of copies, spreading them throughout the world, across the Four Seas and Five Mounds, I shall petition the Heavenly Court on his behalf, elevating his name to the Upper Realms, and bestowing blessings through the Jade Unicorn. Wherever this scripture resides, calamities and obstacles shall not intrude, and the myriad spirits shall guard it in secret. If there are good men and faithful women who, day and night, comprehend, embody, and recite it, they shall ascend to emptiness in broad daylight, attain the sagely Dao, and avoid the netherworld’s judgment. Should any seek to destroy this scripture or extinguish its teachings, the city gods and village spirits shall investigate and report, and the Thunder and Fire Departments shall swiftly mete out retribution. The merit of this scripture is beyond measure—you must believe and receive it, and so invigorate the Xu tradition."

When the Master finished speaking, clouds drifted into the great void, incense wafted beneath jeweled canopies, cranes soared beyond the pavilion, auspicious mists filled the hall, and wondrous fragrance assailed the senses. Chang Peng bowed a hundred times in gratitude, believing, receiving, and vowing to practice. *The Eight-Grade Immortal Scripture* (Scroll Eleven), Preface.

**Postscript to the Engraved *Later Eight-Grade Scripture***
**Preface to the *Later Eight-Grade Scripture***

The *Former Eight-Grade Scripture* was expounded in Wuling and long since published in the world. The *Later Eight Grades* were expounded in Linjiang, but because the text contains answers regarding procreation and external elixirs, it strictly warns against reckless transmission to the unworthy, lest slander arise.

When Patriarch Lü manifested at Longsha, his intent was solely to teach people to refine the three medicinal substances—essence, qi, and spirit—to transcend birth and death and verify the fruit of Golden Immortality. Not a single word touched upon external elixirs or chamber arts, nor the heterodox teachings that deceive the people.

Yet if the warning against reckless transmission implies it should not be published, why then expound it? Thus, Xu Taiji and others chose to engrave and circulate it, recognizing that the dual cultivation of jade fluid and golden fluid, the simultaneous completion of nature and life, the departure from the Kan Palace and the Li Palace—these demand earnest study and profound reflection. Following the human path leads away from the Dao; reversing the flow to become an immortal truly grasps the One that perfects the myriad things. The Way inherently embraces both, and its techniques cannot be abandoned on one side.

As it is said: *"The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it; the inferior person hears the Dao and laughs loudly."* Let those who cultivate in this world not cling rigidly to words and texts, thereby breeding doubt and slander. Strive to be the diligent superior person; do not tread the path of the scoffing inferior. Only then may one read this *Later Eight-Grade Scripture*.

**Self-Preface to the Engraved *Later Eight-Grade Scripture***
Compiled by Liu Tishu, the Oblivious One of Yiling
Collated by son Liu Yincheng Qinghui and nephew Liu Yuncheng Qingxu
Revised by Huang Chengshu, the One Journey of Shaxian

How profound it is! To establish a vessel for crossing the world is to offer a guide for salvation...

To expound the profound mysteries of the scriptures is truly the Dharma-vessel that ferries one across the bitter sea. Moreover, the Great Dao of the Imperial Ultimate is possessed by all; those who seek it attain it, while those who abandon it lose it. A single truth, subtle and elusive, is set forth in these awakening texts. Those with affinity will treasure it as a supreme jewel, while those of shallow roots will treat it as mere wastepaper. Yet how many can truly comprehend and awaken?

Today’s scholars, donning tall hats and square robes, merely invoke the name of the Dao while flaunting their own abilities, falsely posing as lofty sages. They do not empty their minds, feel no shame in seeking instruction, and fail to seek the guidance of enlightened teachers. Instead, they cling to stale words on paper—how can they ever grasp the truth without the power of wisdom?

Thus, this *Eight-Grade Scripture of the Immortals* is revealed, its phrases plain and its principles unadorned, yet its subtle mechanisms fully disclosed. It clears the obstructions of later learners and points the path for those who cultivate the Real. If one embodies and practices it over time, one will naturally attain the numinous and transcend the mortal cage to ascend into the celestial vastness. Merely reciting it with the mouth, without putting it into practice—what benefit is there?

The *Former Eight Grades* has long been published in the world, while the *Later Eight Grades* remained hidden in Linjiang, secret and untransmitted. Now, disciples Xu Taiji and Wu Tailong, having formed a karmic bond, have donated funds to publish and circulate it throughout the cosmos. This is truly the affinity of future scholars and a great merit for the flourishing of our Dharma-gate!

Alas! In this world, the deluded are many, while the awakened are few. People mistakenly take illusory splendor for ageless joy, unaware of time’s swift passage or the brevity of life. With a single breath cut short, none know where they will go. The numinous essence enters another shell, transforming into all manner of strange beings. Even if one attains the highest rank and enjoys a thousand bushels of emolument, all is but the toil of dust—how can it compare to those who walk the path?

Let us exhort the virtuous: ponder the gravity of life and death, the swiftness of impermanence, the rarity of obtaining a human body, and the difficulty of encountering the true Dao. Arouse the mind of heroic vigor, exert the power of diligent progress, and contemplate this scripture day and night. Ingest this spiritual talisman, uphold these secret mantras, examine body and mind, and wash away the dust of defilement. Complete the human Dao and return to the original source.

Yet merely reading and reciting without penetrating the essence of life and destiny betrays the toil of my brush—what benefit is there?

Written on the fifteenth day of late spring in the year *yimao* of the Kangxi reign, at Yunji Pavilion.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Immortals on Cultivating Immortality, Verifying the Real, and Returning to the Elixir, Expounded for Warning and Transformation by Patriarch Lü, the Faithful and Protective*
**First Grade: The Primordial Flower of the Cavern Mystery, Ascending to the Origin**

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Dao was in the Great Brahma Heaven, upon the nine-tiered jeweled palace, seated upon the cloud-dragon throne. Fragrant vapors of jade incense curled around him as the true immortals of the Three Realms, the sages of the Yang Valley and Water Palace, and all the holy assemblies gathered to hear the Great Dao expounded.

Then, the Faithful and Protective True Lord, together with the wondrous Daoist perfected ones, raised their tablets and respectfully addressed the Lord: *"In the beginning, when the Primordial Chaos opened the heavens, it was born from the Great Void, the Great Ultimate, and the Great Transformation. From the profound obscurity, forms took shape. The light and pure floated upward, called the 'Heaven of Qian'; the heavy and turbid settled below, and the 'Earth of Kun' bore the weight of the myriad things. The two qi intermingled, and the human Dao was born. Once humanity came into being, the Three Powers took their places, and all transformations and nurturing depended upon the spirit. The spirit can transform, stirring like thunder. The sun and moon illuminate, the constellations and stars revolve, mountains and forests, grasses and trees, birds and beasts, flying and hidden creatures—all conditioned existence relies upon the spirit. The east shines to generate wood, the west illuminates to generate metal, the south moves with the Red Bird, the north nurtures the embryo of *ren*, and the center, *wu* and *ji*, also circulates in turn."*

The Lord of the Dao said: *"Excellent!"*

"Excellent! For what reason do you speak of these matters?"

Then the Crimson Elder of the South, together with the Perfected Lord of Sincere Protection, replied: "The supreme Dao is rarely encountered, and its profound words are seldom heard. In the great transformation of human life, if one fails to cultivate the Five Relationships, one drifts in the delusions of life and death, losing one’s original true nature. This is why one decays and falls into the dark netherworld."

The Lord of the Dao said: "Your compassion moves me to reveal these subtle teachings. You expound upon virtue and power, awakening understanding of what lies ahead. What you have spoken is indeed the sacred canon. The spirit can ascend and descend, wondrously harmonizing yin and yang, dispelling and gathering the central valley, effecting transformations in perfect measure.

At the central position, clouds and frost congeal. The Seven Mansions of the Azure Dragon rise from Fusang, called 'Jia Wood.' Together they unite with the west, where the 'White Tiger' takes its place. The 'Vermilion Bird' soars; the north is guarded by the 'Dark Warrior'; and 'Wu and Ji' accompany one another. The Five Phases intermingle, moved by a single impulse. Water is yin, fire is yang; the Hall of Light embodies true virtue, penetrating and linking the Three Directions—this is called the 'King of Medicines.'

Of late, the people below have indulged in greed and desire without restraint, losing their primordial origin. Their blood and qi are exhausted, sinews and bones wither, complexion fades and withers—all because they have lost their spirit. If one wishes to nourish the spirit, one must first nourish qi. If one wishes to nourish qi, one must forget speech. If one can forget speech, it is better still to cut off thoughts. Once thoughts are cut off, all depends upon the heart.

The heart is the function of the Dao, governing the entire body—nothing is greater than this. In refining the heart’s function, sight and hearing become unaware, joy and anger do not arise, emotions are forgotten, thoughts are severed, and body and mind are awakened. Seeing, one perceives no self; hearing, one perceives no self. Detached from all realms, one enters the wondrous gate.

The spirit has its goings and comings, its summonings and arrangements. This great Dao is entrusted to those of virtue."

Only you, O Faithful Protector, have accumulated merit upon merit, manifesting transformations across the dragon-swept sands to deliver all beings. In this world, those of sincere cultivation and learning are commanded to widely transmit your teachings, rescuing the drowned and lost, ensuring the great Dao shines brightly everywhere.

Thereupon, the Perfected Lord reverently heeded the Dharma-sound, and together with all the perfected ones, bowed in gratitude and withdrew.

**Chapter Two: The Rank of Forgetting Emotions**

The Faithful Protector Perfected Lord, receiving the decree of the Supreme Dao Lord, descended in the phoenix carriage with the assembled immortals, manifesting presence at the Moonlit Waters Hermitage by the river. Addressing the great assembly, he said:

"In this world, who among those who study and inquire can truly believe and accept? Things entangle the emotions, emotions delude the will, the heart cannot remain clear, the spirit cannot be preserved—adrift in the cycles of life and death, the nature and destiny tossed and lost, unable to turn inward, thorns filling the path.

Only when one can stabilize and cease does one become clear and still. If emotions abide nowhere, how can things move them? Observe the night’s dreams: like your daily activities, all sights and sounds are but illusory scenes. When the two evils do not invade, the earth congeals true numen; when true numen does not crumble, the will encircles like a fortress.

As the *Yi* says: *'Stopping at the back, one does not encounter the self; walking in the courtyard, one does not see others.'* This is inner not seeing outer, outer not seeing inner—when both inner and outer are forgotten, empty numen naturally appears. Forget things, forget emotions, and the supreme Dao may be illuminated.

When the will stirs without, emotions tug within; the will scatters, the spirit disorders, and through emotions, ruin and collapse follow. The heavens’ movement never ceases—how can emotions abide? Through autumn’s passage, killing comes; through spring’s passage, life arises. From the qi’s resonance, the myriad transformations are completed.

I once imparted the mechanism of refining the spirit. The Lad of Guangling, through sincerity, received it—eight chapters expounded to deliver the world’s delusions, yet in Yangzhou, pride and meagerness prevail. People act recklessly, extinguishing the teachings of sages and worthies, serving a world of deceit and falsehood. Those who initiate inquiry and reverence are outwardly criticized as wrong, merely inviting slander and, in turn, stirring dust-like doubts. To speak is inadvisable; more than a year has passed. Seeing your repeated pleas, where life and destiny are at stake, I expound this numinous text—you must awaken and uphold it. Transmit it through heart’s realization, not through thought’s pursuit.

Thought yields wisdom, but clinging to sounds and weighing thoughts breeds delusion and stupidity; awakening brings awareness. The Dao does not speak emptily—embrace the One and forget emotions. Inwardly observe and retrace your steps; in stillness, return to the Great Void. From the Void, return to the Great Ultimate—here lies the mechanism of transformation. Once wisdom and awareness are attained, responding to things, one is not deluded.

As the scriptures have said: *'The Dao’s utterance from the mouth is bland, without flavor. It pivots yin and yang—only return and observe!'* When emotions are forgotten and the will is stilled, the stilled will turns the heart to ashes; the ashen heart turns things to ashes; ashen things resemble stupidity—yet in this stupidity, the spirit lives, and where the spirit lives, the Dao resides.

In daily use, what arises is the mechanism. If the mechanism is not externally defiled, the nature stabilizes and emotions return. The world does not believe and accept, thus it matches fragmented terms: dragon and tiger, metal and wood, water and fire, snake and tortoise, yellow sprout and white snow, dark maiden and infant—all boil down to two words. Inverting right and wrong, forgetting what can be forgotten, the wondrous function transforms them. Do not let them become entangled—this is the mechanism of yin and yang."

The *Book of Documents* states: *"Heaven ordains its principles, correcting what is not of the heart."* When the heart refrains from wrongdoing, things naturally forget their passions. The *Rites* say: *"As thought arises, the mechanism’s work begins."* The Primordial Sovereign of Grand Unity commands the myriad spirits with awe; the general’s stern orders—who dares disobey? In defending cities or waging field battles, the orthodox and the extraordinary follow order. Like fire boiling the sea and sun, revolving Mount Kunlun, coalescing into a precious pearl, transformations swirl in mist—when water clears, the moon appears; tides respond as qi arises. To forget passion is to harvest; the wise attain understanding on their own.

The Most High said: *"The Dao assists the king, not by force of arms."* Arms are passion; when passion stirs, things expand—how can one rely on them? Reliance lodges passion; passion pursues things, and passion enslaves the spirit. If kings and lords can hold fast, the myriad things transform themselves. When transformation gives rise to desire, suppress it with nameless simplicity. If your passion does not arise, solitary yang returns; if your passion lingers, yang severs its continuity. Respond to things by forgetting passion, and the spirit opens of itself. Internally, the transforming mechanism operates, and celestial truth finds ease.

The world is lost in blindness, chattering ceaselessly. Spirit scatters among things; passion is ensnared by form. Things surge chaotically, like ten thousand mountains and a thousand valleys. The true path is lost, and one seeks detours and byways—the farther one strays from home, the deeper passion drowns and life is cast away.

The inner path of cultivation: passion does not touch things. Guard the feminine and retain the masculine; return from black to white. To forget yet not forget—this *not-forgetting* is the mechanism! What is forgotten is the thing; the mechanism quickens, and the aperture becomes numinous. When things are forgotten, life is restored. Grass and trees meet autumn: their colors fade, their blossoms fall, and yang spreads its moisture. The hexagram of the eleventh month corresponds to *Return*. In employing things’ mechanism, observe their apertures—steal their qi and return to your own wondrousness. To be used by things is the omen of ruin!

Observe the flourishing of things, examine their decay. Turn back and seek within—there lies the Dao.

The Perfected Lord further instructed: *"You who seek—how does cinnabar arise in reversal? How do humans arise in compliance? Though you study the Dao, you know the source’s correctness but not that the ten thousand streams all return to the source! To wish for human relations is to preserve the ancestral sacrifices. The patriarchs did not speak of this, for it concerns the path of return and reversal. Since compliance gives rise to humans, one is inevitably enmeshed in worldly affairs. When forms and colors fill the eyes, passion abides in things. Reversal and compliance scatter the spirit, and life is spent in vain. You earnestly seek procreation—how can you not have heard of the beginning in husband and wife, the principle of multiplication? Guard your primordial essence, forget the passions of things. Regulate that channel, master that flourishing. Orthodox and extraordinary follow order—refine qi and nurture spirit. When spirit moves, qi coalesces; above and below unite in harmony. Without supreme stability, commands are not obeyed. Blood must not lose its defense; essence must not lose its restraint. If I am full and the other empty, yin and yang both continue. Tides must keep to their signals; yang must adhere to its return. The fire that boils the sea enables birth and nurture. Ride the lead’s splendor, match the mercury’s quality—mercury and lead unite, the two breaths conform. Yin can retain yang; yang also clings to yin. The Dao of yin and yang begins with metal and water in harmony. What need is there for force? What labor of the heart? Silently conform to it, and skill lies in celestial completion.

Transfer the father’s spirit, seize the mother’s breath. When spirit and breath receive the tally, essence and blood govern themselves. Reverse this to refine within—observe and gather the essence, return it to your primordial breath, and you may be called an immortal. Spirit is sacred fire; fire is the medicine. When the medicine’s sprout arises, it resembles a bellows. You must refine with care: golden light blazes, coalescing into a precious pearl—yin and yang do not err.

Today’s blind followers see gold as gravel—how can one speak to them? You must stabilize and awaken on your own."*

At times during the assembly, disciples bow together in supplication: "By your grace, Master, awaken us—all transformations flow as one. The world transmits both inner and outer teachings, advocating their dual cultivation. When the inner elixir is refined, the outer also reaches completion. We beseech you, Master, to broadly bestow the profound mysteries within."

The Perfected Lord replied: "Through spiritual transformation and shedding the mortal coil, the inner elixir may be cultivated. Though the outer elixir may be compounded, how can it be attained without virtue? Broadly accumulate merit and conduct, universally aiding the flow of beings. Our Dao seeks reduction—when reduction reaches its limit, the elixir is refined.

In ancient times, the Celestial Master of Han bore witness by leveling grain prices; later, the Immortal Ge, refining and aiding the netherworld, distributed talismans and dispensed medicine, universally aiding the world, sustaining the perilous and upholding the fallen, relieving the distressed and bestowing kindness. Patriarch Xu of Jingyang likewise devoted himself to prior merit. When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, celestial spirits guard and protect, the elixir remains unassailed by demonic forces, and after ninety-nine refinements, one ascends in flight upon ingestion.

Ancient elixir wells and sites bear witness. Since you have inquired, how could I not speak? I shall continue this Dao within the chapters.

The Dao of the outer elixir, though involving action, truly distinguishes essence and function. Through function, essence is revealed; celestial nature is mutually bound. Refine lead to obtain lead, pan for gold in water. Initially one family, later divided into two natures—clad in coarse robes yet holding jade, the sun rises from the sea’s depths.

When the elixir first coalesces, the moon emerges at geng. Though likened to the moon, it is the true form of lead. The black soul does not wane; in broad daylight, gold is formed. Shedding the mortal to become immortal follows a clear path. Following the hexagrams and lines, distinctions are made between leaks and responses. Yin returns, yang revives, and the root of qi is divided. Yang refines and disperses; yin refines and congeals.

When the first yang arises, do not allow it to scatter and deplete. Plant yin to cultivate yang, and yang will arise of itself—this is called ‘true lead.’ Though your essence may be as radiant as Xi Shi, it truly nourishes the eastern household. Recognize the yellow sprout, and both inner and outer may be refined.

Now appended to the various chapters, ponder and resolve it yourselves."

**Chapter Three: Observing the Mind**

The Perfected Lord said: "Vast and undifferentiated, the primordial chaos is the supreme and most numinous. It nurtures heaven and earth, transforming the po and refining the hun. The heart is the abode of spirit, harmonizing yin and yang, governing all wonders, and responding to transformations without fixed form.

The Most High has said: *'The Dao is attained through the heart; the heart is illuminated through the Dao.'* Observe the Dao with the heart, observe the heart with the Dao. Hold the heart like a valley—responsive yet silent, embracing the Great Ultimate and circulating the Five Phases.

Mencius said: *'Benevolence is the human heart.'* One who embodies benevolence is invincible and thus transforms things. When things are transformed by it, the world returns to benevolence. Stabilize the heart to lodge the spirit; the spirit is preserved thereby. When the heart is settled, the spirit shines; when the spirit shines, things become obscure.

Still and unmoving—this is the essence of my heart. Responsive and immediately penetrating—this is the function of my heart. Extending knowledge to investigate things—this is the numinosity of my heart. Refining qi to transform spirit—first, one must cultivate the heart. Cultivating the heart means reducing desires; this is the root of the Dao. When the heart is tranquil and empty, the spirit responds naturally. The spirit’s response has no fixed abode; it responds to things and then returns, uniting with heavenly nature. Respond without attachment, lest one fall into existence. Those who speak of 'no-mind' fear trailing dust. When the heart is free of dust, dust does not arise.

The elixir is sought within the heart—how can one say there is no heart? If 'no-mind' is taken as the essence of the Dao, one may build inwardly but remain deluded by blank emptiness. The foundation of guarding the Dao is to empty the heart! When the heart is empty, things are empty; when things are empty, the heart is numinous.

Uphold the precepts, concentration, and wisdom to clarify the heart. Eat plainly and wear simple clothes to sever the yin of things. Know when to stop in fame and profit to restore harmony. Emotions give rise to things, and the heart alters them. Alteration becomes delusion, which clings to things and dust, entangling one morning and evening—ten thousand demons invade! The heart and spirit become inverted, disrupting one’s heavenly truth.

All manner of thoughts arising are called 'deluded mind.' When the heart is active, the spirit dies—hence the saying. If one speaks of 'deadening the heart,' how can the spirit be moved? The form will not follow transformation, becoming like a wooden puppet!

The heart is like a luminous pearl, round and radiant. Placed in a dish, it rolls freely without attachment. Still and free from desire, the spirit arises naturally. Guard the spirit without forgetfulness, embrace the origin to refine the form. When form and spirit are refined, the numinous returns to the Great Void.

Refining the heart is called 'yang'; clinging to things is called 'yin.' As the saying goes: *'If the slightest yin is not exhausted, one cannot become an immortal!'* You must awaken to this.

The heart is the mechanism of transformation, like the pivot of the Northern Dipper. Unstained by a single thing, one awakens to the mechanism. The body is small, but the heart is vast, equal to heaven and earth. Expand and fill it, and it can encompass heaven and earth. Break the barrel hoop, and you will perceive true emptiness.

Like a mirror reflecting things, when things depart, it becomes still. The original substance is inherently luminous, but it is deluded by things and cannot return to its source. The illness of the habituated heart: *'The human heart is perilous; the heart of the Dao is subtle.'* If the subtle governs the perilous, how can it not be dangerous?

Master Fan said: *'The subtlety of the single heart is assailed by a multitude of desires. How few are those who preserve it!'* The noble person preserves sincerity, overcoming thoughts with reverence. When the heavenly ruler is at peace, the hundred parts of the body follow its commands.

Drawing from ancient and modern discussions to align with the elixir classics: though a thousand rivers return to the source, the Dao does not differ in its discourse! The Dao is one, though its teachings vary; all ultimately return to goodness. A single room with a thousand lamps—nurturing qi and refining form—all lies within the heart!

When the heart is vast, the body is at ease—this is the sign of drawing the Dao. When the heart is still, the spirit is whole; when the spirit congeals, the nature appears. Water still, without waves, the moon’s reflection is undisturbed. When the heart stirs like water, it drowns in the current and becomes turbid. When the wind is calm and the waves are still, one’s heavenly nature remains unaltered. Stillness is like water, returning to the source and thus clear.

Conceal the spirit and nurture wisdom, master qi and store the numinous. Empty the heart to nourish the spirit, firmly grasp the root of the numinous. Abandon it, and it perishes; hold it, and it endures. The forms of heaven and earth, the numinosity of yin and yang—wondrously transforming the myriad things—value not giving rise to emotions!

If one can grasp heaven, what Dao would not be clear? It is only because of delusion by things that one becomes entangled. Refine the nature with the heart, preserve life with qi. Transforming the hun is called 'nature'; transforming the po is called 'life.' When emotions arise, return to nature; when nature arises, return to life. The mechanism of refining lead will be discussed in later chapters.

Sweet dew sprinkles the heart; when emptiness is extreme, it is perceived! Still the essence, qi, and spirit, and they will not be disordered. Forget things, self, and others to prevent gradual corruption. Be only precise and unified, holding fast to the center. Cultivate this, and your heart will naturally become numinous.

What does heaven say? Confucius said: *'Those who know me do so through the Spring and Autumn Annals; those who condemn me do so through the Spring and Autumn Annals.'* Attain the Dao and forget words—why should I linger here?

Illustrating the principles of yin and yang, embodying the inner and outer elixirs, borrowing the numinosity of the two qi—this is truly the gateway of the hun and po. When others invest with emotion, blood must flourish and qi overflow. When I unite with sincerity, essence must be firm and spirit resolute.

If essence controls qi, yang restrains one yin and gives birth to a girl—this is the Li trigram. If qi controls essence, yin embraces one yang and forms a boy—this is the Kan trigram. Spirit and qi belong to yang; without the two yin of essence and blood, they cannot abide. Essence and blood belong to yin; without the two yang of qi and spirit, they cannot be produced.

If the emotions and natures of man and woman do not align, those who give birth are few! Thus, essence arises from emotion, and blood flourishes through qi. When essence and blood congeal, they form the shape of an infant, completing the work of creation. The body relies on yin and yang, coagulating into an egg and transforming through the numinous work of the spirit.

If one can secure essence, nurture qi, and master the spirit, what worry is there of not giving life? The way of ceaseless generation begins with stilling the heart! Master the spirit without scattering it, and the union will be numinous. Follow this practice, and descendants may continue the lineage. Cherish the treasure of life and do not trifle with it!

The outer elixir’s watery lead contains the five colors. Before gold and water separate, it responds to the stillness of my heart."

When the numinous entity is born, the moon appears as a crescent, responding to the stirring of my heart. The movement of golden mercury corresponds to the hun-soul; the stillness of watery lead conceals the po-soul. Within lead, mercury is hidden—thus the po-soul conceals the hun-soul; when mercury emerges from lead, the hun-soul grasps the po-soul. The child steals the mother’s qi, gradually filling its form; the mother transmits qi to the child, gradually withering away. Through this cyclical theft and transmission, yin and yang mutually adhere. Heaven and earth sustain one another, seizing this creative power—termed "prior to heaven," unlike anything in the mundane world.

Sulfur, arsenic, saltpeter, cinnabar, and mercury—these mineral substances belong to the "posterior to heaven" realm. How can they be mistaken for the "prior to heaven"? Refining yin with yin, ten thousand elixirs will not succeed! The "prior to heaven" can transform the "posterior to heaven" into treasured use, but the "posterior to heaven" cannot transform the "prior to heaven" into the elixir’s efficacy. Just as the "prior to heaven" primordial qi, being non-action, can refine the "posterior to heaven" mortal body into sagehood, yet the "posterior to heaven" mortal body, bound by desire, cannot refine the "prior to heaven" primordial qi into truth.

Thus, the lead and mercury within the crucible are the very lead and mercury within the body. I possess a divine talisman to refine the medicine and transmit it to you. Inscribed in vermilion beforehand, each day you must reverently—whether at the hours of *yin* or *mao*—decoct the herbal medicine, then burn one talisman and ingest it. This will nurture the heart, dispel evil, refine qi, and preserve emptiness. The numinous work is unparalleled in the world; with prolonged practice, its efficacy will naturally manifest. Do not transmit this to the unworthy—guard it with care and reverence.

**Chapter Four: Cultivating the Stillness of Nature**
The Perfected Lord said: "The practice of stilling the nature is the essential means to preserve life. It revolves through emptiness and inverts life and death. Nature is bound to the heart; life is bound to the body. Lead-dragon and mercury-tiger—drive them down, raise the talisman. Forget emotions to nurture nature; empty the heart to nurture spirit.

The Most High said: *'Observe this body carefully—it comes from emptiness.'* Emptiness is nature. Nature is the true essence of the boundless and the numinous spirit of the great void. From the moment it receives form, it is called *nature*; from the Dao it receives life, thus it is called *life*. Zisi said: *'What is mandated by heaven is called nature; following nature is called the Dao.'* Therefore, one who can fully realize nature stands as an equal with heaven and earth! How can nature, life, and the Dao be three? The Dao is nature and life; nature and life are the Dao.

The mechanism of gathering and refining: nature resides at the edge of heaven; life lies at the bottom of the sea. The imagery of heaven and sea is but a metaphor! Essence and spirit are the foundation of nature and life. Thus, nature cannot stand without life, and life cannot exist without nature. When the heart is empty, nature is luminous; when life is secure, essence is born. Preserve sincerity and stabilize intention to fortify this root; cleanse thoughts and purify the heart to bathe this body.

The method of nurturing nature and the metaphor for preserving life: when nature returns to emptiness and stillness, the heart enters non-action, essence naturally transforms into qi, qi naturally transforms into spirit, and spirit naturally transforms into emptiness. People of this world have their nature enslaved by the heart, and their heart ensnared by things. Thus, when the illuminating heart remains still, it responds to ten thousand changes. In application, it moves; in its fundamental state, it remains still. The deluded heart is constantly in motion, giving rise to ten thousand thoughts; though its application may be still, its fundamental state is ever in motion.

Illumination returning becomes the Dao; delusion returning becomes things. When the heart departs from things, nature departs from dust. Thus, extinguishing the deluded heart, the celestial nature becomes true; without diminishing the illuminating heart, the celestial nature becomes pure. Life is bound to qi; nature is bound to spirit. Conceal spirit within the heart; gather qi within the body. When the heart is clear and thoughts scatter, one can know life; when thoughts cease and emotions are forgotten, one can fully realize nature. Emptiness enables the use of things; stillness enables the response to affairs.

Human nature is fundamentally good—so spoke Master Meng. When nature governs emotions, nature is settled and emotions are true. Illuminating the original state, one returns to life and reverts to the root. Directly realizing nature, one naturally realizes life. Those of shallow roots and meager capacity first cultivate life, then nature. Nature is the master of the body; the body is but a guest. The guest body nurtures this nature, yielding to it as master. When body and heart are unmoving, the tiger is subdued and the dragon descends. When emotions enter nature, this is called the homeland of the elixir.

Thus, the metaphor for refining nature is like tuning a zither’s strings: if too tight, the strings break; if too loose, there is no sound. To play the zither well, tension must be just right! Emotions arise from the heart; the heart arises from nature. The waves of emotion flow from the current of nature; nature is Kunlun. The numinous awareness of nature pervades all phenomena. To preserve it fully, see as if not seeing, hear as if not hearing, serene and without trace, ever still and ever clear. Unchanged by the passage of time, uncompeting with things, gathering and dispersing—all follow stillness! When rolled up and concealed, the numinous work unites with emptiness.

To know nature, first perceive its manifestations. In responding to a hundred matters, how can nature be obstructed? When settled and not deluded, this is called *yuan-shen* (original spirit)—the nature of the "prior to heaven." What is called *yu-shen* (desiring spirit) is the nature of the "posterior to heaven." The nature of the "prior to heaven" is the root of numinous light; the nature of the "posterior to heaven" is the form of material disposition. If the dispositional nature is absent, the original nature naturally appears. Abiding in the center and attaining harmony, desire cannot sway it; when desire cannot sway it, qi embraces the primordial. Primordial qi follows, spirit is clear, and qi is continuous.

Nature has no direction; life has no fixed position. Still the spirit and maneuver the strategy—these two will naturally meet. The virtue of the highest is non-action; it does not seek through observation. Yin and yang inwardly resonate, and one roams with heaven and earth. Thus, Mencius said: *'He who fully realizes his heart knows his nature; knowing his nature, he knows heaven.'* Nature arises from principle; life is preserved through nature. When nature is still and emotions are at ease, the heart of heaven is again seen.

Therefore, to investigate principle, fully realize nature, and reach life is like the timely rain that nurtures all things. Yao and Shun embodied nature, governing with hanging robes—governing through non-action, and the world submitted. All under heaven were settled, simply by following nature! For those who study and practice: if you can master the celestial nature, return to non-action, and unite with true emptiness, when emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, the spirit will manifest subtle workings.

The Dao encompasses heaven and earth—nothing escapes nature! Nature, oh nature! Only in stability and stillness. Without seeking encounters, without inner or outer—you must preserve it as the stem of your life."

The Qian Dao provides the origin, thus it can bestow life; the Kun Dao nurtures life, thus it can sustain it. Though it is said that essence and blood converge, in truth, they transform from emptiness into spirit. A woman must regulate her cycles so that blood flourishes; a man must consolidate his qi so that essence congeals—without a settled nature, who would not falter and collapse?

The female nature tends toward seclusion, her qi harmonious and spirit flowing, delighting in emotion; the male nature tends toward aggression, his qi restrained and spirit gathered, fortifying his heart. When tiger and dragon do not rampage, when ape and horse do not bolt—fearing stumbles and falls—all hinges on forgetting form!

Qi and timing follow their seasons, divisions adhere to their measures. The Yellow Dame guides the way, returning naturally to the nest. The tiger’s roar and dragon’s flute, the two qi unite in harmony; the turning of the celestial sphere reveals at once the workings of heaven!

Do not allow it to float, for floating scatters qi; do not allow it to sink, for sinking causes qi to fall. Follow nature in this, and yin and yang will arrive of themselves. Refine the spirit and secure essence—do not indulge in emotion. Curb desire to preserve the foundation, and practice will yield results!

Do not fear yang’s decline, but fear the division of emotion. When emotion scatters, spirit disperses, and essence follows in collapse. Thus, to preserve essence, one must first cultivate spirit. When spirit is firmly settled for long, essence too becomes steadfast and numinous.

The worldly do not understand, resorting to medicines for aid. If medicine is not inherently warming, how can yang attach? Yet they fail to see that when hot medicines enter the belly, qi scatters with the heat, and essence flees with the heat—how can this be the true Way? Such folly risks life itself. Those who study and practice must take heed and guard against it.

Within lead lies gold, within emptiness lies qi. Without knowing the mechanism of gathering, the gold scatters and is difficult to produce! Lead envelops metal and water, chaotic and unclear. When water is still, metal is born; when lead dissolves, mercury grows.

Those who settle their nature daily refine the gold so that water is exhausted. If not observed in time, though water may be exhausted, the gold will dissipate with it. Within lead, the solitary yang is the dragon, belonging to the true fire of Kan; within mercury, the solitary yin is the tiger, belonging to the true water of Li.

Yin presses, yang ascends—like the tiger descending as the dragon leaps forth, thus the moon emerges from the Geng direction. The dragon embraces the earthly net as the sun reaches the Wu position; the tiger emerges from the heavenly snare.

Deluded practitioners of the world refine lead into ash, calling it "withered lead," and use it to dry mercury. Little do they know that the golden qi within lead has already scattered—it is but dust and clamor! How then can it subdue common mercury and transform it into supreme treasure?

The song says:
*If you wish mercury to die,*
*First you must kill mercury.*
*If mercury does not die,*
*How can mercury be killed?*

What does this mean? The "mercury you wish to die" is the common mercury of the posterior heaven; the "mercury you must first kill" is the gold within the primordial lead. Lead is water, hence it is called "immortal mercury." After this immortal mercury forms the embryo, sheds its leaden body, and completes the nine transformations, its essence gathers and congeals—neither flying nor fleeing, like something dead when taken from the furnace. Common mercury, upon seeing it, dies at once.

Yet if the immortal mercury’s yin tally has not receded and its dross remains impure, there is still the danger of dissolution, flight, and loss—how then can it kill the common mercury of the posterior heaven? The worldly, ignorant of this, act recklessly and blindly, bringing ruin upon their households. How could they fathom the wondrous transformations of external alchemy!

**Cultivating Qi, Chapter Five**

The Perfected Lord said: "The Supreme has declared: *'Concentrate qi to attain suppleness, and you may become like an infant.'* The primordial qi unfolds the body, activated by spirit as its mechanism. Spirit is fire, and fire is the heart. If one pursues emotions and desires, fire follows qi in dispersion, falling into guest qi, where form is stirred and obscured. Wandering through many realms, one loses the original source, unable to master it, drowning in conditioned states.

If the scholar can turn inward, observing and stilling the self, abiding in unbroken continuity, guarding the breath of the embryo—grasping the movement of Heaven, one may circulate the myriad things. To 'cultivate qi,' as Mencius said, is the vast and unyielding *hao ran*. Nurture it directly without harm, and it fills the space between Heaven and Earth. This qi—how could it be dual? Following its path without cease, it transforms naturally. Thus, do not forget the heart, nor force its growth. Embody this refinement, and qi is attained and cultivated.

The body does not generate itself; that which generates the body is qi. Qi does not generate itself; that which generates qi is the Dao. The *Book of Changes* says: *'Not hastening, yet swift; not moving, yet arriving.'* The alchemical texts speak of the 'Three Passes'—one may know them, but how can one rely upon them?

Now, those who blindly cultivate, secluding themselves to refine qi, find their qi untransformed, and poisonous swellings follow. Observe Heaven: its movement never ceases. Spring generates, autumn gathers—this is the resonance of qi. To disregard Heaven’s movement and recklessly guess at human intention, sitting in meditation to gather spirit, grasping essence and ingesting qi—unaware that within stillness, the ten thousand dusts disturb and entangle. Closing the eyes to force tranquility, one drifts into delusion and dissolution. At the first sight of sensory forms, habitual thoughts arise again. Cultivating qi in this manner, hair gradually turns silver, and the complexion fades to yellow and withers.

Those who study the Dao must first preserve the body. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, let qi constantly guide spirit. When spirit departs, draw it back to secure the primordial root, returning to the heart’s aperture, circulating qi to govern essence. The *Scripture of Embryonic Breathing* says: *'The embryo is born from concealed qi; qi coalesces from the embryo's existence.'* Qi entering the body is called life; spirit departing from form is called death. Where spirit moves, qi moves; where spirit abides, qi abides. One who can master this finds spirit and qi naturally abiding.

To generate without possessing, to act without relying—within non-abiding, the true mechanism appears! With spirit guiding qi, only in stillness and emptiness, like a silkworm spinning its cocoon, qi is concealed within. Over time, it transforms into a moth. If one can conceal spirit, why would one not ascend?

When body and mind cling to illusion, one merely pays lip service. The true heart unmoved, true qi naturally stabilizes; intention not following conditions, spirit becomes numinous; the body not stirred by sensory forms, essence is preserved. Essence not generating sensory forms is preservation; qi not scattering to external things is stabilization; spirit not chasing conditions is numinosity. Qi not dispersing and transforming preserves form; if qi scatters and perishes, form immediately collapses. A lump of pus and blood—how can it have roots? With time, it putrefies, sinking into decay and dissolution.

Thus, qi is the master of form, bringing forth being from non-being. Returning to the origin, reverting to the primordial—embryonic breathing is the guard. Firmly abide in emptiness and non-being to nurture spirit and qi, returning the essence’s radiance, gathering its vital fluids. Following qi’s transformation, descending and ascending in turn. Heaven descends with yin; Earth ascends with yang. With dragon restraining tiger, tiger submits to dragon’s descent. Heaven’s heart and Earth’s kidneys—two qi mutually guiding. Dragon’s fire and tiger’s metal—two substances not running wild. In unbroken warmth and nurturance, without position yet with direction.

Qi harmonized, spirit harmonized; spirit harmonized, qi concealed. Concealed yet not indulged, it transforms into jade nectar, further transmuting into qi. Qi reaches the Three Halls—kidneys, heart, and the Hundred Meetings’ region. Qi descends, qi ascends—attaching to this as orientation. Do not seek with intention, for seeking inflames like fire; do not scatter with intention, for scattering dissolves like water.

Profound is the mechanism of the Dao—do not seek it through form! Seeking through form is not the path of the Dao. How subtle! How subtle! Silently recognize it; attain it through the Dao, not by clinging with the heart. Master Guan Yin said: *'Reverse the traces to unite with the Dao.'* The Sage Confucius said: *'Master the self to return to the body.'* Practicing thus, one understands the cultivation of qi.

Emotions returning to nature is reversal; husband singing and wife harmonizing is compliance. The flute has no sound until qi moves it; the embryo has no substance until qi coalesces it. In this human Dao, the union of two qi—do not separate from harmony, nor cling to intention. The Dao of the Elixir and the human Dao are but reversal and return.

To not lose the two qi, first regulate them. Qi continuous and unbroken, settled breath as control. First yin must yield, then yang arrives. Only when desire is full may one apply governance, subduing body and mind, not allowing reckless waste. Above, know Heaven’s timing; below, observe Earth’s principles. To align with Heaven’s mechanism, first choose the land’s advantage.

The body upright, the complexion radiant; the temperament gentle, the heart’s realm peaceful. With this foundation established, the foundation’s waters are reliable. Like excessive yang, fields and crops wither. A single morning’s rain is insufficient to restore them. If the soil is moist, crops flourish; if the soil is parched, crops wither. Morning and evening tilling cultivates the soil; abandoning it leads to desolation and ruin.

The transmitted methods speak of the *Renzi Pill*, the mechanism of Qian and Kun, the Dao of husband and wife. One who practices this may continue their descendants. But one must cultivate qi to return to the primordial. If qi is not cultivated, essence dissipates in chaos. Cherish spirit to guide qi, nurturing essence. Essence not expended externally, firmly guarded within. Guarding within without loss—this is the root of Heaven’s mandate.

Reversal leads to sagehood; compliance generates humanity. The *Book of Changes* says: *'The noble person cultivates it and finds fortune; the petty person defies it and meets misfortune.'* The body is formed by qi; qi nurtures the body. Yang is not born without yin; yin is not transformed without yang."

The mercury-dragon pertains to function, easily taking flight and becoming luminous; the lead-tiger pertains to form, readily concealing itself in obscurity. The dragon-mercury follows fire and scatters in transformation, relying on the tiger-lead to gather it with water; the lead-tiger hides in obscurity and lies concealed, depending on the mercury-fire to refine and extract it. This is what is meant by *"extracting lead and adding mercury"*—how could lead be extracted? Through prolonged refinement, it naturally returns. As yang endures and yin transforms into qi, lead does not wait to be extracted but becomes floating dust. What is called *"mercury can desiccate lead"* does not mean refining lead until it withers and mercury dies—rather, without extracting lead, lead extracts itself. As for *"adding mercury,"* from where is mercury added? Through prolonged refinement, it naturally reverts to form. As yin assists over time, yang receives it as substance, and mercury does not wait to be added but establishes its own foundation. This is what is meant by *"the mother can nourish the child"*—lead withers and mercury dries. Thus, without adding mercury, mercury adds itself. External alchemy is nothing more than the coalescence of these two qi in harmonious union. *Sixth Grade of Refined Lead.*

The True Lord said: "Lead is the foundation of life, governing within the body. When one’s nature is not purely authentic, it relies on this to perform the work. One must examine the qi and essence, gathering at the root’s sprouting. The elixir is born in the Northern Sea, corresponding to *Water Thunder Layer*; the medicinal seed is planted in the Southern Palace, matching *Mountain Water Mong*. The two qi interact and respond, and the myriad transformations arise therefrom. The true person lurks in the abyss, and only when companions are found do they follow. Kidney qi transmits to the liver, liver qi transmits to the heart, heart qi transforms into fluid, fluid gathers the essence of metal, the golden toad spits its radiance, the red serpent coils around it, the white tiger pursues things, the green dragon governs them. Lead essence has no fixed position, chasing emotions to find its corner; spirit knows no birth or extinction, yet perishes with things.

The heart is called the dwelling of spirit, the kidneys the abode of essence; the Yellow Court is the qi cavern, the names of the crucible and furnace. Threads and channels connect, steadfastly existing. Within the formed, seek the formless; through life, perceive nature, for nature is the cause of life. Within the formless, seek the formed; through nature, perceive life, hence it is called *empty the heart*. Nature is originally heaven-endowed, naturally completing itself; life is rooted in the numinous form, forging lead within the sea. Gather mercury in the heavens, moving the essence of lead; return to the midst of mercury, where essence arises from stillness and responds to movement.

Heart fluid moves fire, descending to commune with the kidney palace; kidney fire’s tranquil splendor, a single yang steams upward. Riding the qi’s ascent, following its spiraling path, the hundred bones are threaded through, spirit finds its refuge, essence gains its numinosity. As heaven sends down yin, at summer’s solstice it first stirs; from autumn to winter, yin descends to its extreme, then yang returns within the earth. Yang, long concealed, when qi fills to overflowing, bursts forth in motion, and the myriad things follow in birth. Heaven’s movement within is wondrous in its workings. Qi does not scatter outward but clings to the earth as root. The human body mirrors heaven and earth; with reverence, align within, and it may correspond.

Simply embrace tranquility, emptiness, and non-being, preserving the original true qi; guard spirit and essence in silence, and over time, it will naturally... If spirit abides in non-action, qi ascends and descends of itself. Thus, one must moderate diet, lest spirit be harmed; restrain lust and desire, lest essence be lost. When essence is still and spirit clear, qi follows the vessels’ passage, rising from the Northern Sea, gathered in the Southern Palace, returning to circulate through the Yellow Court, merging with the myriad spirits. With intention as the guide, ascend to the true void. Below the body lie the two kidneys; beneath the tongue, the two orifices. The Flower Pool’s divine water, the Purple Palace’s primordial lord.

The Most High said: *'The Flower Pool’s divine water descends to irrigate the numinous root.'* If you cultivate this, life may be long preserved. Do not cling to being, nor follow non-being. Preserve essence to transform qi, naturally congealing the spirit furnace. Spirit fire refines the turbid, essence’s splendor floats upward; the two qi unite, progressing from being to non-being. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, use it with earnest care; listen with the horns’ acuity, like a hen brooding her eggs, covering them with gentle warmth, feathers nurturing them to completion. At the inception of gestation lies the root of restored life.

Fire refines, water arises; yin descends, yang ascends. Heart fire belongs to yang, its fluid to yin; kidney water belongs to yin, its splendor to yang. As for the *Kan* trigram, yin envelops yang; as for the *Li* trigram, yang envelops yin. Thunder rises from water, yin contains yang; water flows from mountains, yang contains yin. Water seeks the earth, so the heart communes with the kidneys; thunder commands the heavens, so the kidneys commune with the heart. The mechanism of heart and kidneys gathers the two qi. To seek with heart and kidneys is to be burdened by things.

Spirit does not leave qi, qi does not scatter essence; when spirit, essence, and qi unite, one may attain longevity. If one can forge this lead, form and spirit are both complete: spirit soars to the upper realms, form abides in the human world. If one cannot preserve it, qi scatters and form is discarded, a mere sack of pus and blood, vainly awakening to cultivation. Fire too fierce harms the elixir; water too abundant yields no achievement. Yin and yang both gathered, intention and emotion deeply entwined. Let the other be empty, while I remain full. Emptiness can respond to things; fullness can propagate life. Plant the seed, and the sprout emerges; when earth is empty, things flourish. When channels are still and blood is empty, within three days, red flies fill the ground—how can spring’s work be seen?

Heaven’s mandate is proclaimed, yin rides while yang receives. Men, swayed by excessive emotion, are like ceaseless rain—recklessly bestowed without restraint, and living things rot! Women, inclined to stubborn nature, are like scorching drought—yet when water arrives, life revives abundantly. Blood receives essence, and the fetus’s bones form; essence imparts to blood, and the fetus’s flesh takes shape. Flesh and blood are fundamentally yin; bones and essence are fundamentally yang. Yin harbors the yang body; yang enfolds yin’s radiance. Men embrace yin; women hold yang. Blood transforms, bones endure—how can essence be ordinary? If one can reverse its course, the body will not perish.

All immortals preserve essence to reach the immortal realm. Indulging in desire, letting it blaze, the po scatters and the hun stretches—willingly becoming a ghost of the dust, vainly entering delusion. *'Do not shake your essence, do not labor your form.'* The words of the Most High—who heeds them? What I now expound is not for discussing lewdness, jesting with the flowers of romance—how could my heart be tainted by dust?

The grasses and trees of the world can yet regenerate; how can the human way not be upheld, treating life as so light? Cultivate the two qi within, accumulate hidden merit without; curb anger, restrain desire, nurture spirit, store essence. Practicing thus, what fear is there of not succeeding? When yang is deficient, supplement yang; when yin is disordered, regulate the channels. The methods of regulation and supplementation rely on medicinal aid.

I gather the world’s methods to embrace all living things, preserving and guarding them carefully—do not show them to the unworthy. Metal inherently gives birth to lead; entering water, it is not drenched, rising in response to *Layer*. Earth is born from metal; entering fire, it does not scatter, acting in response to *Mong*. The Northern Sea yields lead; the Southern Palace produces mercury. Rooted in water and earth, the two qi’s wondrous workings. When water dries, metal appears; the child departs the mother’s womb, seeking its kindred, responding to the summons and coming.

Foxes and hares are not horses; swallows and sparrows are not phoenixes. The foolish of the world recklessly meddle with metals and stones."

Refining gold depends on fire to transform its qi and substance; employing both civil and martial methods, one escapes the murky cave. Nurturing gold requires a crucible to cultivate the infant, combining gentle warmth to form the sacred embryo. A golden radiance envelops all, a jeweled moon hangs in the sky—within this vision lies the work of refining lead, ten months of transformation, the river chariot turning day and night. This principle is the foundation of mercury and lead, the method of refinement and nurturance; Pengzi nearly grasped it. The Celestial Treasury’s stipends, the immortals’ emoluments—without merit and conduct, how dare one presume to hold them! Should one escape heavenly censure, lightning execution awaits; stealthily seizing fortune leads to a hundred paths and a thousand detours. One may only hear of this, never forcibly pursue it; only when merit is complete and conduct perfected will one naturally encounter guidance.

**Entering Emptiness, Seventh Grade**
The Perfected Lord says: "To enter emptiness is to empty all realms, so that realms cannot disturb; to empty all forms, so that forms do not delude; to empty all desires, so that desires do not assail; to empty all things, so that things exert no agency. Empty the body, empty the mind, to refine the foundation of spirit; empty essence, empty qi, to return to the true mechanism. Whatever is seen or heard, observe it with emptiness. The foundation within emptiness is most subtle.

The Most High has said: *'There is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth. Silent and vast, it stands alone and unchanging, circulating without end. Vague and indistinct, in its indistinctness there are images; in its vagueness there are things. Dark and profound, within it lies essence.'* Within this void, the wondrous spirit is contained.

Yanzi said: *'The more I look up, the higher it seems; the more I delve, the firmer it becomes. Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind.'* The *Book of Changes* speaks of the 'Primordial Yang,' Buddhism of 'True Emptiness.' Within emptiness lies an aperture called the Supreme Ultimate. It cannot be named, yet truly arises from non-being. The Five Phases converge, the Seven Governors align as one.

The Most High said: *'See not, hear not; embrace the spirit in stillness. Without sound, without scent, its oneness resides within.'* When the heart subtly harmonizes, danger follows dust; yet in danger without danger, one may know the subtle. The principle of subtlety can conceal or soar; the sound of subtlety is like a flute played without holes, a zither without strings. The body of subtlety allows stones to converse, wooden horses to neigh in the wind. Cultivate stillness to its utmost to know its wondrous emptiness—empty yet not empty, subtlety lies in the aperture’s mechanism.

In daily use, it may be known: the ear hears with acuity, for within the ear lies the aperture’s wonder; the eye sees afar, for within the eye lies the aperture’s marvel—this is your spirit. Yet it is not the ear or eye’s wonder that is spoken of, but the spirit entering its aperture. Your heart’s aperture can gather the spirit, so the six gates do not wander, the seven emotions do not arise. Refine the spirit to return to emptiness, restore your numinous root. This root is not a root, but the spirit of things before birth. Only emptiness can transform; only transformation can spiritualize. The spirit beyond spirit is called true spirit. Scattered, it becomes qi; gathered, it becomes the real.

Zengzi spoke of 'one thread,' Yanzi of 'emptying thoughts.' The Buddhist scriptures say: *'For immeasurable kalpas, the root of birth and death—what is called "coming" is the essence within emptiness. The wonder of empty essence harmonizes with all principles.'* The sutras state: *'Seeing does not perceive me, hearing does not attain me; transcending all extremes, this is called the wondrous Dao.'*

People lose their spirit, vainly seeking to transform things, yet failing to recognize the mechanism of transformation, they are themselves transformed into things. Thus it is said: *'The child plays with its shadow, only to be played by the shadow; the madman mocks the statue, only to be mocked by the statue.'* Without clarity of true emptiness, what benefit can there be?

Within our bodies, the arising of joy and anger, the stirring of sorrow and delight, the misperceptions caused by things—these are our illnesses. Transform the body with emptiness, let the body follow emptiness’s transformation. What joy? What anger? What delight? What sorrow? Those who cannot empty themselves obstruct themselves with dust. Qi arises from the numinousness of sound, awareness from the numinousness of dreams. Within still emptiness, one does not engage the bodily form.

Entering emptiness to its utmost, one becomes as if in a dream, without sight or hearing—this is called the spirit’s return. For days on end, one is utterly merged, then the mechanism of wisdom stirs. Inner and outer become numinously clear, the body’s form is exchanged. The body emits five colors—this is shedding the yin foundation, like a dragon changing its bones, a snake shedding its skin. With long accumulation, one becomes unshaken, unmoved. One feels qi ascending, wind and rain rustling; the tongue moistened with sweet nectar, the nose flowing with jade pillars; the eyes emitting radiance, qi warming the cinnabar pool. Gradually, it rises again, a fierce wind tearing at the earth, steaming the mud pill. One becomes dazed, as if drunk, hearing the sound of rending silk in the abdomen, thunder roaring in the ears. Pain pierces bones and penetrates sinews, a thousand battles rage, ten thousand waves surge. Fire blazes throughout the body, rising and descending in crimson, flowing through the hundred bones, circulating through the entire being. Entering emptiness, harmony is achieved—this is recorded in the alchemical classics.

Having attained this verification, proceed further. The fire times of the celestial cycle enter the body from this point. After awakening from primordial chaos, heaven and earth are reestablished. The day of soaring flight will come—do not fail in your cultivation. Having now gained this, do not treat it lightly. In the world, there is no womb that cannot be a father, no birth that cannot be a mother."

The grasses and trees have life, each thing its own kind—how could the response of the *zhongsi* be false speech? There is a saying: *"Solitary yin does not generate, solitary yang does not complete."* Without yin, yang has nothing to adhere to, and that which adheres is qi; without yang, yin has nothing to follow, and that which follows is essence. Refine essence with emptiness, and essence becomes firm; refine qi with emptiness, and qi flourishes. Though essence congeals in the kidneys, if met with emptiness it generates without the affliction of lust; though qi governs the body, if met with emptiness it flourishes without the peril of partial desiccation. Qi flourishes in blood, spirit governs essence—guard emptiness to enact it, and this is the wondrous subtlety of true stillness entering emptiness. Though passions mingle, qi is employed with external contemplation; though bodies unite, spirit rests without hasty transference. When the man’s passion is joyous and the woman’s intent is glad, gather her yin water to strengthen the yang radiance. Await the flow of fluids, the panting of nasal breath—yang operates, spirit shifts, and qi enters the scrotum. In the world, there are those whose shared passions reach their peak, whose two qi are fragrant, and thus conceive twins—this is no anomaly.

The common man, deluded and ignorant, fails to restrain and moderate, exhausting essence in greedy desire. His complexion withers to yellow, his form withers externally, his spirit languishes within. Body and spirit emaciated, burdened by turbid dissipation—if one embraces essence and nurtures emptiness, curbs desire and awaits the proper time, not only will there be offspring, but life’s foundation will also endure. You, who encounter the world’s delusions, should take this as a warning: do not cast your pearl of treasure as a clod of mud! To share together in the realm of longevity—how could this not be beautiful? To perish for such greed—willingly become a lowly ghost!

Lead is refined in the nine cauldrons, each cauldron with its pivot. Within it lies lead—true and false diverge. Thirty *wen* hexagrams govern qi, seventy *wu* hexagrams consolidate the foundation. Within them, transformations arise, and all things are generated. Without the wondrous subtlety of warm nurturance, how could the minute apertures of emptiness harmonize? The gatherer gathers true lead, like the image of a pearl within the watery lead. Thus it is said: from the kidney’s palace, the embryonic spirit transforms, becoming the yellow sprout. Thus it is called *yugui*—mercury, the serpent, readily changes, but with lead it is repeatedly restrained and does not fly. Lead, the tortoise, readily dissolves, but with mercury it is harnessed and does not flee. Merely draw and replenish, as the verification of a water clock; return and repeat, like the moon’s waxing and waning. Though the lead is true, if not severed, without the fire’s crucible the form will not shine, and it cannot be succeeded by a child—how then could it be transmitted to a grandchild?

In the previous nine cauldrons, the embryo is shed, becoming the substance of true emptiness. Each cauldron is nurtured by the mother qi, and only then is it attained.

**Chapter Eight: Shedding the Embryo**
The Perfected Lord said: "When embryonic breathing is settled, the inner light becomes spirit. Harmony of qi responds, and extreme emptiness perfects the true. Within the indistinct and vague, qi fills and becomes spirit. The yang essence manifests its form, and suddenly one feels the body lightened—surpassing lineage and ancestors, ascending together. When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, a celestial decree descends. Mounting the wings of a flying crane, one’s name is listed among Penglai and Yingzhou.

The Most High has said: *'If one desires to cultivate the Dao, first one must abandon affairs, not cling to any single method, and the heart will abide constantly.'* Above the settled heart, all is open and unobstructed; below the settled heart, all is vast and without foundation." Mencius thus said: *"Great and transformed—this is called sagely; sagely yet unknowable—this is called spirit."* I admonish you on shedding the embryo: unite form with emptiness, recognize the profundity of stillness, and know the mechanism of non-action. Pierce the wondrousness of the three barriers, consolidate the enclosure of the Great Ultimate. With what is known, replace what is unknown; with what is recognized, replace what is unrecognized."

With what is heard, replace what is unheard;
with what is done, replace what is undone.
Before your birth, what single thing existed?
Since receiving life, you have been enslaved by form,
entangled in myriad obstructions—
love, desire, greed, and wrath.
Arrogance, extravagance, and pride
have taken root and transformed the heart.
The Confucians call it "selfishness,"
the Buddhists call it "net-like obstructions,"
the *Xian* call it "received karmic veils"—
the Buddhists also call it *received karmic veils*.
Abandon these at once,
for they are the roots of your burdens.
Originally, they were not yours—
things turn and passion is forgotten.
Sever these habitual tendencies
as a knife cuts lotus root:
one stroke, two halves,
not a single thread remains entangled—
unyielding resolve, fierce determination.
As if the body had never been born,
neither heart nor body truly exists—
what then could entangle you?
Awaken suddenly, loathe the world’s illusions:
the four great elements are but pus and blood,
like filth in a latrine—
the eye cannot bear to see,
the nose cannot bear to smell.
Only when this is severed in an instant
is it called *"comprehending the heart."*
Comprehending the heart, the burdens of qi dissolve;
the burdens of qi conceal the spirit.
When spirit submits and qi congeals,
abundant and free, it commands the numinous.
It splits open the primordial chaos,
filling the Great Clarity with light.
It overturns the ten directions,
shatters empty space.
A single staff props up heaven and earth;
a single bundle of the Infinite envelops the forms of Qian and Kun.
Bearing emptiness, bearing stillness,
neither death nor birth—
the sound of the宗 resounds across the eight wilds,
the spirit dwells in the Three Clarities.
Shedding the embryo, the spirit transforms;
refining and preserving the form,
the form remains in the world,
while the spirit transcends the Jade Court.
This is the supreme Dao,
aiding you to penetrate the real.
In years to come, when your practice is complete,
you will be lifted up in ascension.

No-thing originally arises from having-thing,
formed things originally adhere to the formless.
The formless gives birth to and nurtures the numinous essence—
father and mother unite to form a single nature.
Only because people of this age drown in desire,
they know not the work of gathering and refining.
Foolishly they cast their nature into the abyss of love,
while the resolute turn inward to observe the foundation of life.

This foundation is the father’s numinous qi,
while life is the mother’s knitting of the embryo.
The embryo’s spirit congeals, drawn from the Great Void—
first, one must refine the spirit with enduring patience.
Seize the golden essence and hold it fast,
and spring will naturally fill the courtyard steps.
To gather spring and face the scene, idly opening the heart—
fire’s dryness makes the elixir hard to bear.
The ten-month embryo’s talisman is warmed and nurtured,
within it, the method employs *zhun* and *meng*.
Each embryo’s transformation follows the same pattern—
one must nurture the nature with unbroken continuity.

After three years, the sage’s penetration silently transforms,
relieving the poor and aiding the distressed to cultivate merit.
The response to the eight trigrams is the original root—
the method carries the cinnabar script, advancing fire and retreating talismans.
How could this ever depart from yin and yang?
Yet people falsely speak of postcelestial methods,
ensnaring wealthy families in their nets.
How laughable—the foolish, lacking wisdom,
covet another’s high arts,
unaware that he claims kingship for himself—
would he ever cede his realm?

Only with a mother can there be a child,
but how can another’s mother compare to one’s own?
Heaven distinguishes prior and posterior, yet the matter is perverse—
not like ordinary silver, which is a postcelestial yin substance.
Cinnabar and mercury—how could their bodies be purely yang?
As soon as they meet the furnace fire, they scatter and fly.
Each person is deluded, losing their home—
without a mother, lead’s qi cannot form,
yet it is called the metal beneath the water.
Taking silver as the root of the mother,
all are deceived by the elixir masters.

That which has a mother yet lacks numinosity—
this is clearly expounded in the scriptures.
Leisurely observing the golden valley, carefully weighing the discussion,
this is the ultimate principle of external alchemy.
The master’s judgment is complete.

Then, heavenly fragrance filled the air, auspicious qi floated over the hermitage,
cranes cried beyond the clouds, rosy clouds reflected the courtyard curtains.
Golden flowers and jeweled radiance spread across the seat,
a myriad of wondrous signs startled and responded.

The villagers all bowed their heads in reverence, praising the rarity and expressing gratitude before withdrawing.

Six *Xijiangyue* verses—
the first two elucidate the Way of husband and wife,
the latter four illustrate the efficacy of external alchemy,
in accord with the preceding scripture, completing eight sections in all.
Let scholars ponder them repeatedly, and they will naturally gain insight.
Treasure and keep them secret, lest my earnest transmission be in vain.

The first section is the scripture’s text,
the seventh explicates the meaning of the first—
take care never to recklessly transmit them to the unworthy,
lest slander arise.
Beware! Beware!

**Heavenly Sovereign’s Esoteric Incantation**

Heaven-born cloud and dragon, the Dao ascends from the origin.
Fierce and upright qi, resplendent in the Great Clarity.
Assisting the true Dao, walking the path of rectitude.
Six Jia pervade the primordial, nine heavens transcend form.
Blessings and prosperity for descendants—
first, cultivate one’s own authenticity;
then extend to the Human Sovereign,
that all may revere long life.
Six Ding and nine *xuan* (mysterious forces),
the esoteric truth is perfected.
Revere it, and ultimate felicity shall be yours—
the August Heaven’s noble name.
Through enduring mastery of the Dao’s subtleties,
the body remains ever full.
Whoever hears these true words
shall unite with the Dao in truth.

*Hasten! Hasten!*
As the decree of the Original Celestial Worthy. **Secret Formula.**

**Three Circles atop the talisman are called "Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown"; nine circles within the talisman are called "Nine Revolutions Returning the Elixir," also known as "Nine Dragons Bearing the Sage." The true *qi* is the qi of the cinnabar field. When inscribing this talisman, one must draw upon the primordial *qi* and spread it upon the paper. Wait until the clear dawn, when spirit is lucid and *qi* is fresh, to inscribe it—only then will it be efficacious.**

**Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown—**
**Heaven is my canopy.**
**Nine Revolutions Returning the Elixir—**
**One *qi* makes the true person.**

Recite only these four lines. Consume it for one cycle of twelve years, and the body will become light, ascending in flight.

**Eight Immortals Longevity Decoction**
*Polygonum multiflorum* (soaked in rice-washed water until soft, peeled with a bamboo knife, steamed with black beans for the duration of three incense sticks, then sun-dried): ten parts
*Lycium chinense* root bark (washed with wine, sun-dried): eight parts
*Wolfiporia cocos* (outer skin removed, washed with wine, sun-dried): eight parts
*Panax ginseng* (pure and bright, best when shade-dried): four parts
*Rehmannia glutinosa* (washed in wine overnight, sun-dried): four parts
*Prepared Rehmannia glutinosa* (washed clean with wine, sun-dried): four parts
*Asparagus cochinchinensis* (soaked in wine for one to two hours, heart removed, sun-dried): four parts
*Ophiopogon japonicus* (soaked in wine for two hours, heart removed, sun-dried): four parts

**Jinlan Temple Annotation:** The above is the aforementioned medicinal formula.

The original text is arranged vertically from right to left, differing from the web layout. The above ingredients are to be chopped into small pieces, with *Lycium chinense* root bark and *Wolfiporia cocos* as the sovereign herbs. Additionally, *Polygonum multiflorum* (doubled in quantity) serves as minister and assistant. This elixir has circulated among mortals for many years! In the second year of the Zhiyuan era, it was transmitted to Feng Xuan of Wuyi and published for the world, though it had not yet been refined with talismanic seals. This talisman severs the Three Corpses; this elixir refines the Five Qi. With prolonged use, one may attain immortality. Avoid onions, garlic, radishes, and all beans.

**Wanzi Pill**
*Magnolia officinalis* (bark), *Panax ginseng*, *Cinnamomum* (heartwood), *Commiphora myrrha* (four parts each)
*Boswellia carterii* (three parts)
*Evodia rutaecarpa*, *Acorus tatarinowii*, *Bletilla striata*, *Ampelopsis japonica*, *Wolfiporia cocos* (one part each)
*Radix achyranthis bidentatae*, *Asarum heterotropoides* (five qian each)
*Angelica sinensis*, *Typhonium giganteum* (a small amount each)

Grind the above into powder, refine with honey into pills the size of red beans, and prepare them on a *renzi* day. Take ten pills each time. For men, it replenishes and benefits; for pregnant women, it ensures twins. Take on an empty stomach with fine wine—both husband and wife will find it excellent.

**Postscript to the Original Text of the Eight Grades of Scripture**
The solitary practice of the supreme Dao depends on transmission through worthy individuals. Yet such individuals are not easily found. Those favored by Heaven’s nurturing grace, who seek the great Dao in this world, are certainly not of shallow root or capacity. Nor can those lacking sincere faith or whose source is impure hope to reach its shores!

The exalted sages, in their vast compassion, deeply lament that people remain ignorant and unaware, their understanding of truth incomplete, leading to a turbid universe where the spirit’s radiance is obscured. Is it any wonder that later generations, while propagating its name, fail to grasp its essence, losing sight of the sages’ original intent to relieve suffering in this world and guide later learners?

Master Lü’s *First Eight Grades* of profound truth and authentic interpretation have long circulated, with many adherents. The *Latter Eight Grades*, however, remained hidden in Linjiang, concealed and untransmitted. Would our patriarch’s profound intent to propagate the teachings and deliver humanity be left in obscurity? This unworthy disciple, Xu Taiji, with utmost sincerity and devotion, has roughly grasped its meaning and practiced it diligently. One night, I dreamed of a Daoist in flowing robes, exuding the bearing of an immortal. Upon waking, I gained insight and immediately resolved to combine and engrave the *First and Latter Eight Grades of the Immortal Scripture*, inscribing them in stone to make them public and accessible to all seekers of the Dao.

Fortunately, my fellow disciple Wu Tailong generously offered funds to assist in this grand endeavor. I said, “This is to propagate the true teaching, awaken the world, and guide the people—how could I keep it private?” With reverence, I chose an auspicious day in the late spring of the *yimao* year, and together with fellow disciple Zhang Tailun, we respectfully commissioned the transcription at the Jade Emperor Pavilion in Wuchang’s provincial capital. We then ordered artisans to carve and distribute it widely.

Reciting a single phrase of its profound truth will rouse the deaf and blind of ages past from their ignorance; chanting several of its abstruse passages will guide heterodox and peripheral paths back to orthodoxy. Thus, the obscure becomes manifest, the hidden becomes clear, and all will recognize the path to guidance. May the study of life and destiny no longer fall into the abyss of illusion and groundlessness. May those of like mind take heed.

We, the unworthy, do not deeply understand literature but have recorded our intent in this postscript to the combined edition.

Written on the day after the full moon of the fifth lunar month in the *yimao* year of the Kangxi reign.

The numbers of Heaven, Earth, and humanity do not extend beyond five: Heaven has its five stars, Earth its five phases, humanity its five senses, the five natures it is endowed with, and the five relationships it engages in. These interact through mutual generation and mutual restraint, opposing yet completing one another—the application of the number five is vast indeed!

Thus, Patriarch Lü composed this exposition of the Five Grades. When the Heavenly Lord is at peace, the hundred limbs follow its command. He first sets forth *"Observing the Mind to Dispel Delusion"* at the head of the chapters, for once the deluded mind is dispelled, one may swiftly begin cultivation. Hence, it is followed by *"Laying the Foundation and Gathering the Medicine,"* for refining the medicine requires crucible and cauldron. Thus, it is followed by *"The Crucible and the Cauldron."* Lest one misunderstand the crucible and cauldron and stray into heterodox paths, all forms and appearances must not be clung to, so it is followed by *"Emptying Form and Voidifying Life."* When form and emptiness are both forgotten, the Yang Spirit emerges—almost beyond one’s self. One awaits this in stillness, and the work of immortal cultivation is complete. Thus, it concludes with *"Shedding the Fetal Body and Emerging in Yang,"* all of which is contained within the One Mind. Though there are five grades, they are truly derived from the One, just as the five phases arise from yin and yang, yin and yang from the Supreme Ultimate, and the Supreme Ultimate from the Ultimateless.

Its structure is meticulous, its meaning profound, encompassing the essential truths of the myriad volumes of the Daoist Canon. How could it merely expound the unexpounded mysteries of the *Eight Grades*? If one has no aspiration for the Dao, so be it; but if one aspires to the Dao, how can one not devote one’s whole heart to it?

**Preface to the Scripture of the Five Grades**
Half a *li* east of the North Wusheng Gate of Huicheng in Chu, there stands an abbey called *"Abode of Resting in the Real."* Backing onto mountains and facing a lake, it is surrounded by dense forests and towering bamboo. Few residents dwell nearby, and visitors rarely come. Though the abbey is not large, its seclusion and tranquility surpass those of other places—truly a fine retreat for immortals and perfected beings.

Formerly, outside the city walls lived a scholar named Fu, who from youth possessed a spiritual root and a wise nature. He deeply admired Patriarch Lü and, together with like-minded companions in the vicinity, formed a Lüzu Society to invoke the planchette. In the *jiwei* year of the Kangxi reign, the Patriarch happened to wander through the lands of Chu. Seeing purple qi floating in the sky, he knew a person of attainment was present and descended via the flying phoenix. At that time, those who took refuge under his teaching seat were mostly scholars, and it was hailed as a grand gathering.

Thereafter, he expounded the *Scripture of the Five Grades*, with Fu serving as his principal attendant. The Patriarch secretly imparted the essentials and recounted past causes. Fu attained sudden enlightenment upon hearing his words. Having fully understood his root nature, he served with even greater reverence. The Patriarch thus extensively elucidated the most subtle and profound mysteries, arranging the grades according to the numbers of the five phases and the five constants, and illustrating the diagrams based on the principles of the *He* and *Luo* trigrams.

The human mind is the master of the body, and deluded thoughts are the source of obstruction to the Dao. *"Observing the Mind to Dispel Delusion"* venerates the root; *"Laying the Foundation and Gathering the Medicine"* reveals the true practice; *"The Crucible and the Cauldron"* clarifies the elixir field; *"Emptying Form and Voidifying Life"* forgets form and appearance; *"Shedding the Fetal Body and Emerging in Yang"* signifies the completion of the sacred embryo—one must then be ever more vigilant. When merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled, one awaits the imperial summons to ascend.

Though the scripture is brief, its meaning is profound, encompassing the wondrous truths of cultivating the real. From the time of attending the exposition of the *Five Grades*, with the virtuous knowledge of Scholar Fu present, we were graced by Patriarch Lü’s compassionate bestowal of the precious raft, widely benefiting the multitude. If scholars revere and believe in it, ponder deeply, and diligently investigate, they may yet attain the Dao.

**Original Preface to the Scripture of the Five Grades**
Upon the completion of the grand ritual of the *Five Grades* at the Abode of Resting in the Real, the August Emperor of Trustworthy Protection deigned to say:

*"Formerly, in places such as Piling, I expounded the* Eight Grades *to exhaust principles and investigate sources, dispelling miasmic influences and rectifying qi, so that the great Dao shone anew and the ancestral teachings spread far. Now, in Ezhou, instructing my disciples and delivering beings from suffering, I expound the* Five Grades *to reveal the unexpounded mysteries of the* Eight Grades *and disclose the unspoken secrets of the* Eight Grades. *The precious raft has now fully unveiled the most subtle of subtleties, guiding one to the ultimate aim of the ancestral gate.*

*Moreover, the numbers of Heaven and Earth operate through generation and restraint in fives. The Daoists speak of ‘metal, wood, water, fire, and earth’; the Confucians speak of ‘benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust’; the Buddhists speak of ‘birth, aging, sickness, suffering, and death.’ The* Book of Changes *also states, ‘The five positions interact and each has its correspondence.’ This exposition of the* Five Grades *precisely accords with the principle of generation and restraint, the Dao of endless production.*

*You disciples must revere and uphold it, embodying compassion and never forgetting the bodhisattva mind. Reflect thrice upon this decree."*

The Emperor’s compassion for the Three Chu regions surpasses that for the Five Tombs a hundredfold. Respectfully recorded here to share with those of like mind.

**In Praise of the Five Grades Sutra**
*Eulogy by the Perfected Lord Yuchan*
With bowed head and reverent prostration, I pay homage to the Lord Fu You,
Who descends upon white clouds, riding a crane and phoenix.
Expounding the teachings, pointing the way through the ford,
With the resonant sounds of *leng*, *qie*, and *jia*,
Awakening all the blind and benighted.

*Eulogy by the Perfected Lord Dahuan*
The Venerable One, whose wisdom shines like the sun in stillness,
Serves as the eye of the world, our guiding teacher.
In the sea of suffering, he establishes bridges and ferries,
Thus at the gate of the Dao, he proclaims the secret scriptures.
When the *Udumbara* flower briefly blooms,
The withered sprouts of the spirit, nearly broken,
Are revived by the dharma rain flying through the clear skies,
Amidst crimson clouds, purple qi, and white mist.
All sounds fall silent as the voice of Heaven resounds;
Eyes closed, hearts stilled, we listen with raised ears.
The deluded thoughts of floating life dissolve,
And upon hearing the Dharma, our hearts brim with joy.
Cranes stand in formation, phoenixes and mandarin ducks leap,
While celestial music rings like the harmony of the heavens.
Illusory blossoms seem to scatter like heavenly flowers,
And the heart-sickness of the deluded is cured by the master’s healing.
Each word of the sacred text is a red elixir,
May all beings of the ten directions
Together realize the supreme awakening of the Golden Immortals.
At the end of the kalpa, immortals are born from the master’s mouth,
Whose majestic power and meritorious deeds defy description.
If we wish to repay the master’s kindness,
We must ferry countless beings across.

*Eulogy by the Perfected Lord Taishi Before the Emperor*
Heavenly Teacher and Master of Humans,
Great Sage Pure Yang,
The profound mysteries of the Dao’s mechanism rely on his proclamation.

Amidst the vast and bewildering bitter sea,
Adrift without a vessel or guiding light,
The Immortal One reveals the bridge and ford.
From the ninefold heavens, the thunderous proclamation resounds,
Expounding the Western Perfected One’s great deliverance,
Illuminating the profound and subtle mysteries of the Immortal Canon.
*First Chapter: Observing the Mind to Dispel Delusion*

At that time, the Venerable Sovereign of Orthodox Exposition,
Seeing the mortals below lost in delusion,
Their cunning and deceit like ghosts and goblins,
Their ferocity and malice like wolves and tigers,
Committing transgressions without end,
With the world thus afflicted—none more so than Chu—
In the autumn of the *jiwei* year,
The Supreme Emperor’s wrath was kindled.
He commanded the Deities of Transgression to survey the sins of the people,
And in accordance with celestial law, to decree their karmic retribution.
The number of beings destined for calamity was beyond reckoning.

Moved by great compassion, the Sovereign wept as he petitioned:
“The mortals below are not unwilling to cease evil and cultivate goodness,
To pursue fortune and shun misfortune.
Yet the supreme Dao remains obscure, and their reckless minds are unchecked,
Thus they indulge in chaotic thoughts and disordered actions,
Entangled in the net of karma, incurring the wrath of August Heaven.
Permit this servant to descend among them,
To silently awaken the benighted,
Clearly pointing out the secrets of cultivating body and nurturing nature,
The Way of preserving principle and restraining desire.
Thus may all beings easily awaken and comprehend,
Naturally dissolving delusive thoughts and taming their reckless minds.
Not only will they escape suffering’s bonds,
But if they persist unwavering in their practice,
They may ultimately ascend as immortals and attain Buddhahood.
I humbly beseech the Sacred Lord to grant this servant’s request.”

The Emperor’s virtue cherishes all life, and he gladly assented to the master’s plea.

As the master departed, the Perfected One Liu of the Left Palace bowed deeply and said:
“From ancient times to the present, immortals and buddhas,
Moved by compassion for sentient beings,
Have expounded countless wondrous dharmas,
Hoping that beings would hear, receive, and uphold them,
And thus avoid falling into the cycle of rebirth.
Yet beings refuse to believe and accept,
Instead heaping slander upon them,
Thereby increasing their descent into evil destinies,
Plunging into the great hells.
Though the Compassionate Venerable One possesses divine powers and vows,
Even if you had a thousand hands and eyes,
How could you alone rescue all the drowning in the world?”

The master replied:
“The scriptures and teachings expounded by the immortals and buddhas
Are profound in meaning and obscure in expression.
The beings of this defiled age are dull in faculties and shallow in wisdom,
Unable to comprehend them.
Moreover, the great Dao spoken by immortals and buddhas of past ages
Still contains secrets yet unheard.
Now, as I descend,
First, I shall clearly reveal the heart-method of sages and worthies,
And second, I dare to disclose the hidden essences of immortals and buddhas.
Though I may incur the crime of recklessly divulging heavenly secrets,
If beings can thereby ascend beyond suffering,
What regret could I have for my own demotion and descent?”

Hearing these words, the Perfected One was both grieved and overjoyed.

Thus, on the auspicious ninth day of the tenth month, the Divine Lord led the host of celestial deities, perfected immortals, and sagely assemblies to descend. Addressing his foremost disciples, he declared:

“All beings turn their backs on awakening and cling to dust, living in vain and dying in futility, scorched and boiled within the burning house, drowned and submerged in the sea of suffering. This arises because beings indulge in greed, anger, and delusion, self-mutilating their own nature, allowing guest-dust to obscure their luminous pearl and delusive clouds to veil the radiant sun of primordial sound. Thus they flow into the various destinies without hope of escape.

I regard all beings as my own children—how could I bear to see you sink into the wheel of rebirth and endure every kind of torment? Therefore, I shall expound the profound mysteries of immortals and buddhas. I shall act as the King of Physicians to cure the ailments of your hearts. Listen with focused minds, for I shall now instruct you:

All beings who seek longevity must embody the great Dao.
To embody the great Dao, one must first observe the mind.
The method of observing the mind is this:
The eyes must turn inward to see,
the ears inward to hear,
the nose inward to smell,
the tongue inward to taste,
the intent inward to contemplate.
When the spirit-light shines forth, immediately return its illumination;
when deluded thoughts arise, immediately return to awareness.
As the ancients said: *‘Fear not the arising of thoughts, only the delay in awareness.’*
When a thought arises, be aware of it; in awareness, it vanishes.
Thus, at the very moment a thought begins to sprout, do not allow it to branch further—turn the light inward to illumine, and the root of delusion will instantly perish.
The Daoist Layman Youxuan said: *‘Once sent forth, promptly draw it back; once returned, you must let it go.’*
The *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *‘The subtlest essential is first to preserve, then to forget. First preserve to empty the heart, then forget to expand its capacity.’* This is the supreme secret of the ancient sages.
Therefore, to extinguish all delusions, one must observe the mind.

The Buddha said: *‘Illuminating the five aggregates as empty, one transcends all suffering and distress.’*
Thus, when one delusion is illuminated, it becomes the truth of that delusion;
when one thought is awakened to, it becomes the bodhi of that thought.
The *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* states: *‘Hold the spirit-candle to illumine deluded passions, wield the sword of wisdom to sever craving and desire.’*
Once deluded passions are shattered, the spirit-candle may be forgotten;
once craving and desire are severed, the sword of wisdom may be set aside.
These are all methods of observing the mind.

Having understood the observation of the mind, one must then clarify the essence of the mind.
This mind, since time without beginning, is neither born nor destroyed, neither comes nor goes. It is utterly empty, utterly luminous, utterly true, utterly sincere—vast and boundless, clear and numinous.
It cannot be measured by existence or non-existence, nor perceived through form or appearance.
Trace it to the time before heaven and earth—none know its beginning;
investigate it after heaven and earth—none know its end.
Heaven and earth rely on it for their covering and bearing,
the sun and moon rely on it for their illumination,
the void relies on it for its vastness,
the ten thousand spirits rely on it for their transformations.
The sages of the Three Teachings teach people to cultivate the Dao—none other than cultivating this one mind.
When one is a being, this mind does not perish;
when one becomes an immortal or buddha, this mind does not increase.

The Buddha said: *‘The mind’s essence is thoroughly pure and all-pervading, embracing the ten directions. Its substance is like empty space, boundless and without limit—it is present here and now.’*
To move the mind is to deviate.
Alas! Beings do not recognize their original mind, mistaking the thief for their child, enslaving the master with the servant, burdening the real with the false. Thus they revolve in birth and death without respite, evoking profound compassion.”

The Immortal Master concluded his discourse.

At that moment, five-colored clouds enshrouded the chamber, auspicious hues swirling through the hall. Then the Venerable Buddha’s Disciple, Mo Lai Fo Zi, stepped forth from the assembly and extolled:

*“Expounding the sutras to cross kalpas,*
*Compassion as the heart’s core—*
*Where the flute’s notes fall, worldly dust dissolves.*
*Benevolence and mercy win reverence;*
*Immortals and buddhas alike hold in esteem.*
*Deliverance knows no hierarchy.”*

The True Buddha’s Disciple, along with the True Immortal Divine Kings, all rejoiced greatly, bowed in homage, and withdrew in faith.

**Chapter Two: Laying the Foundation and Gathering the Medicine**

Since the moment we gained this body, we have lost our nature and severed our life; the seven *po* spirits abandon their abode, the Three Corpses corrupt their dwelling, the Six Bandits clash in discord, and the Four Elements dissolve into illusion. The long-lived die young, the long-lived perish prematurely, the pure become sullied, the wise grow foolish—all having lost the *qi* of the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother, becoming wholly infused with the *qi* of ordinary fathers and mothers. Thus, in knowing only to eat and drink, we differ not from beasts with fur and horns!

Only the sages preserve their horns through the Dao and extend their lives through arts, stealing the boundless primordial *qi* to sustain their finite forms, shedding the *qi* of ordinary fathers and mothers to become wholly infused with the *qi* of the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother. Thus, refining nature and refining form, they effortlessly become buddhas or patriarchs.

Know this: before this body was born, with every inhalation and exhalation, *qi* connected to the mother. After birth, with every inhalation and exhalation, *qi* connects to heaven. If one can sit in stillness within the circle of non-action and non-delusion, turning the mind inward to illuminate, there will naturally arise—like lightning or dew—a spark of true yang, surging forth to enter the *xuan* pass, penetrating the long valley, ascending to the *niwan* palace, transforming into jade nectar. With a crystalline clarity, it descends into the five viscera, whereupon the *xun* wind is stirred, driving out all evil from the three passes and nine orifices, sweeping away all illness from the five organs and six bowels. One must then guide *qi* with spirit, stabilize breath with *qi*, letting inhalation and exhalation follow their natural movement. As the Great Ultimate and empty space merge into one, the foundation of the elixir is laid—like the spring *qi* germinating a seed, or the divine dragon nurturing its pearl.

Thus, the Perfected One of Purple Yang said:
*“The golden crucible’s broth stays warm,*
*The jade furnace’s ashes dispel cold.”*
For once the yang foundation is established, one must nurture it with intention and guard it with spirit. Hence it is said:
*“Fire cools when intent scatters;*
*Fire ignites when intent blazes.*
*Know to draw out yang from yin—*
*Fear not the medicine will not solidify.*
*Know the medicine saves the fire—*
*How could the golden elixir grow parched?”*

As for gathering the medicine, it begins with action, yet only by first knowing non-action can one achieve action. The *Nanhua Sutra* states: *“The essence of the supreme Dao is subtle and obscure.”* The *Daode Jing* says: *“Obscure! Obscure! Within it lies essence.”* This essence is most upright; true essence is the true seed, and the true seed is profoundly luminous. Though the true seed is luminous, one must apply effort to gather the medicine.

What, then, is the true seed? It may be called *“yang essence,”* *“xuan pearl,”* *“yellow sprout,”* *“true lead,”* or *“xuan-pin.”* Its names are myriad, beyond enumeration! All that has form and moves belongs to turbid dust—how could it compare?

Thus, Master Yunfang (the Perfected Lord of Cloud Chamber, styled Zhengyang) said:
*“The whole body is yin—*
*Where is the yang essence?*
*If yang essence can recognize its image,*
*Every image becomes luminous.”*

I have often said:
*“From the subtle and obscure arises the dim and vague,*
*From the dim and vague coalesces a mass.”*
This mass is *“true lead,”* called *“bodhi”* in Buddhism, *“the One Thread”* in Confucianism, and *“seed”* in Daoism.

If cultivators do not know the seed, they either become empty-handed wanderers or withered meditators, failing to return to the root! Those who follow side paths drift aimlessly, relying on their teachers’ transmissions yet lacking true guidance. They know only the narrowness of the *zi* hour, unaware of its breadth! If one knows the living *zi* hour, what fear is there that the medicine will lack the elixir?

Once the myriad spirits are harmonized, fierce dragons will inevitably wage battle. When the blood settles and the *xuan* yellow is determined—though the judgment remains uncertain, as male and female unite—amid the dim and vague, do not let it flee! This is what is meant by *“In stillness, movement arises; draw out true yang to replenish my true mercury. The *wu* earth can cause true lead to descend—seize the tender sprouts of the medicine and swiftly gather them into the high lane.”*

The Perfected One of Jade Void said: *“When true lead and mercury unite, the medicine forges vajra.”* Ancestor Chongyang said: *“The civil and martial fire phases are silently realized; the old and tender, floating and sinking, are carefully deliberated.”*

The Immortal Master concluded his discourse.

At that moment, sweet dew descended, and all the immortals bowed their heads in reverence. Then the Perfected Lord Jade Toad stepped forward, clasped his hands in salute, and extolled:

*"Parents of the Four Births,
Benevolent Sovereign Emperor,
You expound the elixir’s secrets and reveal celestial patterns,
Exhaling mist to inscribe auspicious clouds,
Shouting to disperse the swirling mists—
All travelers of the rosy clouds rejoice to hear!"*

The Perfected Jade Toad and all the immortals of the grottoes were filled with great joy. They commanded their disciples at the altar to receive the teachings with utmost reverence before withdrawing.

**Chapter Three: The Crucible and the Alchemical Furnace**

The furnace is the inverted moon, where the suspended embryo is named, where *xuan* and *pin* gather, where the infant coalesces, where the pearl-like grain forms, where the yellow sprout flourishes.

It is neither metal nor iron, neither jade nor stone, neither arsenic nor cinnabar.

The Yellow Court serves as the crucible, the qi family as the furnace. The hundred meridians intermingle and fill, the Three Origins harmoniously unite. Qian becomes the crucible and Kun the furnace, properly nurturing the immortal flower.

Moreover, without the ice soul in the crucible, yin fluids will not arise; without their arising, the spiritual root of the fire dragon will not grow. Without the jade *yong* in the furnace, yang qi will not be nurtured; without its nurturance, the life stem of the water tiger will be utterly severed.

Thus, the furnace possesses yang, by which ascent and descent are achieved; the crucible possesses yin, by which opening and closing are accomplished. With each ascent and descent, each opening and closing, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Golden Crow and Jade Hare, the celestial hun and earthly po, embrace and linger, refining the supreme treasure—neither dual nor singular—only then may one be deemed a celestial perfected!

As for the fire phases, they must lie in the work itself. Ignite the fire at the navel gate, circulate the water to the crown of the skull. When driving the river chariot, depart the sea of the coccyx in the mundane world and ascend to the celestial tower, moving to the valley of Kunlun.

Before obtaining the elixir, one must rely on martial fire to smelt it and the *xun* wind to fan it, carefully ensuring the fire does not burn amiss. Once the elixir is obtained, one must rely on civil fire to nurture it and divine water to moisten it. If it exceeds, diminish it; if it falls short, augment it—decisively ensuring the fire does not burn amiss.

Thus, the Perfected Lord Ziyang said:
*"Ten months of work,
Abiding in the faint and continuous breath,
Thirty thousand years of destiny
Lie within the comings and goings."*

The Perfected Lord Haichan said:
*"When the hexagrams complete their fire phases around the celestial circuit,
An infant is conceived, guarding the sea of cinnabar."*

At that time, the Perfected Lord Mo Ding stepped forward, clasped his hands in salute, and entreated:
*"The Great Dao is wordless, the supreme image formless.
Where there are words, they must be made manifest;
Where there is form, it must be made clear.
Let not the black wind arrive and cast one into the abyss of karmic dust."*

"What is the 'Dragon'? What is the 'Tiger'? What is the 'Crow'? What is the 'Hare'? What is the 'Hun-soul'? What is the 'Po-soul'? I beseech the Master to elucidate these numinous terms."

The True Master replied:
"The Li trigram’s sun is mercury; the earth of the *ji* stem is mercury. The Dragon dwells in water, its transformations boundless; it gives life and takes life, its power unfathomable—moving like clouds, raining like showers, swift as wind, thunderous as thunder. The Buddha has his poisonous dragon, the *xuan* has its candle dragon, the cave its fire dragon. To subdue the fire dragon is to accumulate cold mercury; to subdue it is to subdue the true fire within the heart. When the fire’s nature does not fly, mercury accumulates; when mercury accumulates, the Dragon lies hidden; when the Dragon lies hidden, the fire is pure; when the fire is pure, yin is extinguished; when yin is extinguished, true lead and true mercury unite, the true Dragon and true Tiger harmonize. Thus it is said: *'Without accumulating mercury, one cannot obtain lead; without subduing the Dragon, one cannot tame the Tiger.'*

The earth of the *wu* stem has no name; we forcibly call it the 'Tiger.' The Tiger is lead, the Kan trigram, dryness, and ferocity—consuming flesh and bone, harming life and destiny. The *Book of Changes* says: *'Wind follows the Tiger.'* It also says: *'Treading on the Tiger’s tail, it does not bite the man.'* If one can tame it with nurture and guide it with reverence, then the primordial is fulfilled and the Tiger subdued; when the Tiger is subdued, lead settles; when lead settles, mercury is emptied; when mercury is emptied, the Tiger’s spirit arises; when the Tiger’s spirit arises, the Dragon appears; when the Dragon appears, the Tiger soars; when the Tiger soars, the Dragon takes flight. Thus the True Man of No-Mind said: *'Facing circumstances without mind, a single qi returns to the root. Myriad spirits pay homage to the ancestor—profound and still, reverent and abiding, serene and soaring, continuous and unbroken—only then is it true cultivation!'*

As for the Crow and Hare—though the Dao has no Crow or Hare, they are named for the formless sun and moon, borrowing their images. The *Wulou* says: *'Mercury is taken from the Golden Crow’s heart-blood; lead is sought from the Jade Hare’s brain-essence.'* The *Wuzhen* says: *'First take heaven and earth as the crucible and vessel, then gather the Crow and Hare to refine the medicine.'* The True Master of Fire Dragon said: *'Within Kan is the Yellow Boy, named the Mercury Ancestor; within Li is the Dark Maiden, the family of lead.'*

Kan is the dry father: when dryness is in chaos, two yin revolve around it, with a single yang residing at its center as the Crow of Kan—able to fly swiftly, thus ascending and descending through yang to complete Kan. Li is the Kun mother: when Kun is in murky stillness, two yang encircle it, with a single yin residing in its belly as the Hare’s den—able to run swiftly, thus ascending and descending through yin to complete Kun. Thus the Radiant True Man said: *'Man and woman in separate chambers will never conceive; lead and mercury in separate furnaces will never form the elixir.'* The True Lord of Purple Emptiness said: *'I have the Yellow Dame, who guards the proper matchmaker.'* This guides the intent: intent draws the Yellow Boy from Kan to pair with the Dark Maiden in Li. When husband and wife unite, they transform into pure Qian—this is called *'taking from Kan to fill Li, restoring my primordial body.'*

The hun-soul and po-soul refer to yin and yang. The sage moves the hun-soul with the po-soul, thus attaining longevity; the common people are controlled by the po-soul over the hun-soul, thus meeting early demise. The hun-soul dwells in the eyes by day, the po-soul lodges in the liver by night—dwelling in the eyes enables sight, lodging in the liver enables dreams. Thus the sage is awake without dreams, while the common people dream without waking. Rather than dreaming within a dream, it is better to seek wakefulness within the dream. For the po-soul has essence, essence gives rise to the hun-soul, the hun-soul gives rise to intent, and intent generates the po-soul. The po-soul, hun-soul, Dragon, Tiger, Crow, Hare—two, yet one.

Thus the True Man of Longevity said: *'When the Dragon roars and the Tiger howls in the deep night, swiftly drive the river chariot without pause.'* The *Zhixuan* says: *'Rushing to the Sea of Qi is the Crimson Steed; flying into the Muddy Pellet is the White Crow'*—this *Zhixuan* is not the *Zhixuan* of the Divine Lord. Therefore I say: *'The celestial hun-soul gives birth to the White Tiger; the terrestrial po-soul produces the Azure Dragon. Transport the treasure to dwell in the Muddy Pellet, move the essence into the Upper Palace.'*"

When the Immortal Master finished expounding the scripture, phoenixes danced and simurghs soared as auspicious clouds filled the sky. All the immortals rejoiced. Then the Perfected Lord Mo Ding stepped forward, bowed in reverence, and offered this hymn of praise:

*"In the crescent-moon furnace, flames blaze bright—
Neither firewood nor charcoal feeds their light.
No external breath is drawn for blowing’s art,
Refinement lies in nurturing the inner spirit’s part.

The Dark Maiden rides the Dragon round the crucible’s rim,
The Metal Elder straddles the Tiger to the cauldron’s heart.
Over the Sea Field, cranes search for cold jade’s gleam,
In the Western Land, the Crow smelts Dui’s gold apart.

The method follows Zhun’s tone, adding Chou’s draw,
Rotating the altar’s work in cycles of ebb and flow.
The elixir, ninefold turned, shines like a pearl’s glow,
Its light illumines a thousand mountains where jade trees grow.

On Peng Isle, the touch of stone startles feathered guests,
In the dusty world, the teaching spreads to save the masses’ quests.
May I, life after life, hear the profound and arcane,
May all transformed beings embody the sagely heart’s domain.

May the deeply ill rise, white bones restored to breath,
With a shout, break the iron locks—ghostly souls ascend from death!"*

When the hymn of praise and vows was complete, all the immortals bowed and withdrew.

**Chapter Four: The Formless and the Empty**

*"Those who begin the cultivation of the True must temporarily extinguish worldly illusions. The bustle of mundane affairs and the hundred thoughts in turmoil—when first sitting within the round enclosure, settle the mind and conceal the breath. If the work does not circulate smoothly, blockages will arise in the joints, stagnation in the blood, and qi obstruction. Though one may return the light, the illumination will fall into emptiness; though one may lay the foundation, the foundation will lack elixir’s fullness. Fullness resides in the mysterious breast—when the Mysterious Female is unobstructed, every aperture relies on it, every cavity bears its function. All who wish to cultivate the True must depart from all suffering and vexation. At the time before the sun rises in the Yang Valley, this is called 'passing the gate between man and ghost.'"*

Dragon-Brow Immortal said: *"The Great Medicine is the root of the elixir—within the body, the hour of man and ghost."* At this time, one may:
breath settles of itself,
silent and still,
the ten thousand spirits grow tranquil,
following nature’s course.
Then jade nectar fills the mouth, alive and flowing;
with intent, swallow it down,
the Tower of Nine Chambers draws it upward,
through the palate’s hum, it gradually reaches the Central Cavern,
the Middle Stomach’s tube refines the divine radiance in an instant.
The ten thousand images grow still.
Part the legs to the kidneys,
the great toes’ wheels turn,
entering the Bubbling Spring, reaching the heels,
ascending the thighs,
the Tailbone joins the root,
passing the Kidney Hall,
the spine splits in two, conveying it to the shoulders.
The shoulders’ wheels turn,
from the cheeks to the back of the brain,
pouring into the Crown,
then descending to the Bright Hall, the upper palate’s ridge to meet it.
Circulating through the palms,
all converges and halts,
the Mysterious Breast comes to rest.
One revolution completes the turning;
once the turning is sufficient,
the Supreme Ultimate merges as one.
Each revolution follows thus,
after nine revolutions, the elixir is formed.
Let me turn and turn at will—
this lies in refining the form.
Refining the form has five methods:
golden liquor refines the form,
jade liquor refines the form,
Great Yin refines the form,
Great Yang refines the form,
contemplating the mind refines the form.
Only *"One"* is not transmitted—
*"One"* is called *"True Emptiness Refines the Form."*

The Lord of the Dao said: *"Set the body aside, and the body is cultivated; forget the form, and the form endures."*
The *Classic of Purity* says: *"Inwardly observe the heart—heart is no-heart; outwardly observe the form—form is no-form."*
No-form, form is empty;
no-heart, heart is empty.
Heaven and earth are empty,
the primordial is empty,
emptiness is empty,
hell is empty,
man and ghost are empty.
Let being and non-being alternate—
nowhere to pursue or grasp.
By this, one attains long years,
life’s span boundless.

Great Master Hongren said: *"One who moves the body is like moving a jar.
Stand outside the jar, and jar and body live;
enter the jar, and jar and body die."*
For only through emptiness can the perishing be reborn;
without emptiness, the living perish.
He also said *"Shatter empty space"*—
for this empty space:
before encountering the realm, it inherently possesses the body of shattering,
no need to set intent or seek further shattering of this empty space.
After encountering the realm, if the body of shattering is lost,
simply still the heart in darkness, restoring its shattered state.
These are all secrets of *"True Emptiness Refines the Form."*

The Fourth Patriarch said: *"All afflictions and karmic obstructions are originally quiescent and empty."*
The Sixth Patriarch said: *"The ordinary being is Buddha; afflictions are bodhi.
The prior thought deluded is the ordinary being;
the later thought awakened is Buddha.
The prior thought attached to the realm is affliction;
the later thought detached from the realm is bodhi."*
An ancient immortal said: *"If you can empty the illusory body, the Vajra will not destroy the self."*
The Perfected of Purple Yang said: *"Swallow one grain of the numinous elixir into the belly, and you will know your fate is not ruled by heaven."*
He also said: *"When karmic obstructions become quiescent and empty, even Yama will let me live."*
The trouble for people lies only in this body’s failure to be empty.

A sack of pus and blood, ever departing and returning, tossed through kalpas by the howling black winds. Thus did the ancient Buddhas and former immortals—those of true attainment—speak invariably of emptiness!

Now, in Ezhou, I expound to my disciples the profound and subtle, the luminous and boundless. The great Dao of immortals and Buddhas is revealed within this scripture.

You, my disciples, must believe, receive, and delve deeply, pulverizing the bodily form and smelting the void. Know that the great Dao is none other than true emptiness!

When a thought arises, it is illusory form; when a thought ceases, it is true emptiness. What is the visage of true emptiness? Like ice melted into still water.

The Immortal Master finished expounding the scripture. At that moment, auspicious qi soared into the sky, rare fragrance filled the chamber, and the assembled immortals bowed in reverence before withdrawing.

Then the Perfected of Jade Clarity stepped forth and praised:

Dead nature gives rise to living mechanism,
Guarding life in the hidden breath of the void.
In the end, not a single thing remains—
Stillness quiets ten thousand cares.

By emptying, the yellow sprout grows long;
By voiding, the true seed of wisdom.
Dragon and tiger harmonize and unite,
Male and female form their marriage.

To seize the cold jade spirit,
Seize this moment of yin-yang harmony.
Conceive a chaos-round,
Refine it in the indistinct and subtle.

Unbroken through cold and heat,
Silent and ever thus—
Split open the Taiji diagram,
Transcend the Four Greats within.

The golden body shines resplendent,
Luminous as heaven and earth.
The true secret of immortals and Buddhas—
Who knows the delight therein?

No thing can bind,
The Five Phases cannot restrain.
Attaining immortality is no second art—
Sage and human share the same qi.

The Master now bestows this teaching,
To widely deliver the benighted.
Bowing before the Dharma seat,
May all long uphold and preserve it.

**Fifth Stage: Emergence from the Womb as a Yang Being**

When the fire-tending is complete and the true embryo is ready to be born, the infant within the womb, nurtured long and full, reaches ten months and emerges from its sac. Rising from the Great Mystery into the Heavenly Valley, this is called the "True Person"—the so-called "Master"—whom the Buddha terms the "ādept" and the Daoists call the "infant," the "true seed."

When the infant undergoes the transition of womb and cauldron, piercing the Pass of the Great Mystery, splitting open the Gate of Dryness, the divine light surges forth with thunderous roars. Turning the body, it leaps out and dwells in the mysterious qi cavern, opening yet another chaos.

This cavern is the crucial pass for immortals to shed their womb and settle their breath, the place where the infant establishes life and destiny—a familiar realm, the natural path of return.

Once the Red Child is securely settled in the quiet domain, seated in the Dao sanctuary, one must guard and nurture it with utmost care. First, it is nourished by the yellow sprout of the Kun Mother; then, it gathers the generative qi of heaven and earth to feed upon. This resonance brings near and reveals far.

Within, the Red Child—with every breath, rise, and fall, every coming and going, every movement and stillness—acts with perfect spontaneity. One must observe the mind and eliminate delusion until, at the end of water and the limit of mountains, not a trace of guest-dust or affliction remains. Then, the tranquil and luminous true constancy becomes unobstructed and free. The infant within the mysterious aperture attains great peace.

Nurturing the infant is the foremost task of immortal cultivation. Do not let it be assailed by external conditions or disturbed by inner delusion. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, never forget it for a moment; in speech or silence, movement or stillness, never neglect it in the slightest. Like a dragon guarding its pearl or a mother cherishing her child, day and night, waking and sleeping, one must vigilantly protect it. Guard the Pass of Origin strictly, never allowing it to wander lightly forth, lest it lose its way upon departure and forget to return.

After years of maturation and nine years of cultivation, spiritual penetrations and transformations will naturally arise. The yang spirit emerges, true emptiness is realized, and the indestructible Vajra body is attained—a being coeval with heaven and earth.

Having ascended the immortal ranks and mingled with the mortal dust, one bestows the Dharma-milk, extends sincere devotion, draws in later learners, and universally ferries sentient beings. When the three thousand deeds are fulfilled and the eight hundred merits complete, a decree is proclaimed in the cinnabar script, and a white crane arrives to welcome. Borne by feathered chariots, golden light dazzles, rare fragrance wafts, celestial music resounds, the Xiang River maiden plucks her zither, jade maidens play their flutes. To the left, crimson tassels; to the right, rainbow banners. Ascending the golden palace, one returns together to the Primordial Azure.

The Immortal Master finished expounding the scripture.

The assembled immortals bowed their heads in reverence, all filled with great joy.

Then the Perfected Immortal Guiying stepped forward, hands clasped in solemn respect, and praised:
*"Expounding the scriptures to cross the kalpas,
grace pervades the ten directions.
All divine immortals and celestial youths,
in ranks aligned, with one voice extol.
Cranes dance and phoenixes soar,
purple qi suffuses the vast expanse."*

When the *Five Ranks* merits were accomplished, the disciples at the altar reverently thanked the Emperor’s grace, devoutly kowtowed to the True Immortals and Divine Kings, and withdrew in faith.

**Appendix: The Transmission of Master Fu**

Master Fu of the Hermitage of Perfected Rest was a native of Jiangxia. Simple and unadorned, he eschewed literary embellishment. Skilled in medicine, he loved the Dao and deeply admired Ancestor Lü. Dwelling outside Wu Sheng Gate, he befriended nearby companions—Chen Yuanfang, Du Guoxiang, Liu Jiuji, and others—with whom he formed a Lüzu Society to invoke the planchette. Half a *li* east of the city walls stood a hermitage named "Hermitage of Perfected Rest," facing Sha Lake and backed by Phoenix Mountain. When the waters rose, a thousand acres turned jade-green; when they receded, one could walk beneath the willows along the embankment to reach the hermitage. Fu and his fellow devotees often gathered there for refined assemblies.

Earlier, Ancestor Lü, wandering through Chu, saw purple qi illuminating the sky above the northeastern corner of the provincial capital and knew an accomplished one dwelt there. In the *jiwei* year of the Kangxi reign (1679), the Ancestor followed the congealed purple radiance and descended upon the planchette. Fu’s karmic roots from a past life were unknown even to himself, nor had the Ancestor revealed them.

One day, as the assembly gathered, Fu was reprimanded by the altar-monitoring Master Xiong for some matter. Fu accepted the rebuke without protest. Soon after, the Ancestor arrived and had not yet finished expounding the scriptures when he was summoned by the Supreme Emperor. The Emperor addressed the Ancestor: *"I have a Dao-companion, an ancient Buddha from the Western Heaven, who has come to the Southern Continent to ferry beings across for over eight hundred years. He now attends your planchette, yet your subordinates, unaware, have mistakenly punished him. Hasten to inform them."*

The Ancestor returned to the altar and severely rebuked Master Xiong, then secretly conveyed the essentials through the sand tray. Fu instantly awakened, though his realization remained unspoken. When he descended the hall to offer thanks, the Ancestor dared not accept his obeisance, ultimately receiving but a single bow.

Later, Fu entered samadhi and traversed the universe—now in celestial palaces, now in the Western Lands—his spiritual marvels too numerous to recount. Here are but one or two examples: A member of the assembly, childless, prayed to the Ancestor and bore a son. When the boy, several years old, fell gravely ill with smallpox, the family beseeched Fu in distress. He petitioned the Ancestor: *"Having already granted them a child, why now reduce the household to wailing?"* That very night, the Heavenly Marshal Wang appeared, seized the Smallpox Spirit, and struck him. By the next day, the boy had recovered and came to the altar to express his gratitude.

Furthermore, the *Seven-Rank Immortal Scripture of the Planchette Emperor* was expounded by Emperor Wen at the Supreme Emperor’s command, with the Ancestor assisting. After each rank was completed, it was sent to Fu for review. Noting that Emperor Wen had altered some of the original phrasing, Fu remarked, *"The original text was entirely fine."* Upon hearing this, Emperor Wen immediately deleted his revisions and restored the original. Such was the reverence Ancestor Lü and Emperor Wen held for him!

Fu once told others: *"The two Buddhas of the West have manifested as commoners in the southern countryside. Whoever is destined will encounter them."* He also said: *"In the future, more Buddhist scriptures will be expounded."* Thus, Han San and other Daoist companions urgently entreated the Ancestor to petition the Buddha to reveal them. The *True Pointers of the Chan School*, now transmitted, is the result.

Fu also stated: *"In the West lies a Golden Lotus Treasure Terrace, which one may ascend only after five hundred years."* The assembly at Hermitage of Perfected Rest all took him as their teacher, and even Han San often sought his guidance.

Later, during a severe drought in Fujian, Fu, moved by the suffering, projected his spirit to bring relief. The crops sprang to life, yielding a harvest. The Supreme Emperor, deeming him to have overstepped his authority, specially petitioned Baolin Monastery to transfer him to the Western Lands. Summoned back by the Buddha, he wrote a farewell poem before departing:
*"Eight hundred autumns since entering the Southern Realm,
scarcely a moment passed—
wife and children wept in a circle,
then he cast aside his brush and departed."*

Formerly, while his physical form remained, his investiture was not included in the scriptures. After his return to the West, however, other scriptures recorded his investiture, placing it after the proclamation of the Supreme Emperor, as follows:
*"The Great Heavenly Honored One of Silent Sovereignty."*

Han San, before ascending the palace, once convened a grand assembly in Qian and Chu, returning but once more. Whenever major gatherings occurred, the Ancestor commanded that memorials be prepared to convey sincerity. Today, his descendants continue to recite scriptures at Hermitage of Perfected Rest during sacred festivals without cease.

A Traveling Daoist remarked: *"How extraordinary was Master Fu’s coming and going! Descending from the Western Lands, he passed through several lifetimes and a thousand years, yet the Golden Lotus Treasure Terrace must await a transformation five hundred years hence before ascending—how distant it remains! Is this not what is meant by the ephemeral mayfly in heaven and earth, the fleeting dawn and dusk of antiquity and modernity? My friend Song Ticheng once followed Master Fu and observed that in life, he was utterly unassuming, no different from any other man. Yet therein lay his distinction!"*

**Preface to *The Supreme Three-Rank Dao of Qingwei, the Mysterious and Wondrous Canon of Unified Harmony, the Mahāyāna Sutra of Transcending Kalpas* (Lower Scroll)**

**Brief Preface to the Three-Rank Scripture**
I had never before studied the books of the Two Teachings [Daoism and Buddhism]. In the year *jiayin* [1614], I first obtained *The Three-Rank Scripture* as expounded by Ancestor Lü and read it with a deep sigh: *"Without this, I would have idly passed my life in vain!"* The scripture comprises three scrolls, every line composed in four-character verses. Even in longer passages, when divided, each segment remains a four-character phrase—like a boundless spring gushing forth wherever it flows, or the waters of the Yellow River, rising from the heavens, winding through a thousand bends, yet surging straight into the sea. Such a work could scarcely be the product of mortal effort. Its profound exploration of heaven and humanity, its synthesis of Confucianism and Buddhism, and its revelation of the Three Clarities within the human body—these are its most wondrous truths. Formerly, Master Song [Zizhen] prefaced *The Doctrine of the Mean*, saying: *"Among all the books of the former sages, none so clearly and thoroughly grasp the essential principles and unveil the profound mysteries as this."* I say the same of *The Three-Rank Scripture*.

**Preface to the Qingwei Three-Rank Scripture**
*The Three-Rank Scripture of Qingwei* was expounded by Ancestor Lü. Gu Xingshu, a scholar of Jiangxia, along with his fellow student Song Ticheng, and friends Wu Yishu, Qiao Yishu, and Gongshu, had long been close companions. They had often gathered to invite planchette divination and earnestly sought Ancestor Lü’s presence. As Xingshu was skilled in playing the zither, one day, as his melody neared its end, a transcendent descended. Upon inquiry, it was revealed to be Ancestor Lü. His poetic verses were ethereal, free from the dust of the world, and his brush moved as swiftly as flight. When tested with matters of verification, all present were astonished and convinced. Soon after, he issued a decree to expound *The Three-Rank Scripture*, which commenced at the upper chamber of the Song residence. At that time, those drawn by the Dao who arrived included the prefectural scholars Lu Sishu, Yu Shenshu, and Yelü Jinshu; fellow student Yang Chuanshu; the scholars of Hanyang, Fu Jingshu; the scholars of Jiangxia, Yin Youshu and Tongshu, along with their younger brother Weishu; and later, Lu Xunshu, Wang Zunshu, Ma Mushu, and An Yicheng, who all gathered to assist. As the Song residence proved too cramped, they relocated to the Qiao residence. However, the expounding of sacred scriptures was a weighty affair, and the cloud chariot’s majesty was solemn. The noise and dust of a private dwelling risked impropriety, so they selected a site for an altar in the northeast corner of the city, securing the former residence of Chen Taishi Dazhang of Xiling. Chen, being a relative by marriage to the Yin family, heard of the matter and joyfully offered his support, contributing the original funds to aid in the construction. Those who assembled at that time—such as An Hengshu, Li Wushu, Song Zhenshu, Wang Xingshu, Qian Nengshu, and Chen Chongcheng—all vied to donate, gathering labor and materials. Within a year, the halls and pavilions were completed in succession, known as *"The Three Palaces Embracing the Dao."*

When the upper scroll was being expounded, the regulations were not yet established. Only after relocating the altar to the palace were rules and precedents instituted: some served as officiants of the altar, some recited scriptures at the imperial altar, some managed memorials and petitions, some collated the meanings of characters, and some attended to incense, candles, and alms for the poor and destitute—all diligently fulfilling their duties. From the year *renwu* [1622] to *jiashen* [1644], the sacred text was finally completed. Two sets of woodblocks for printing were carved: one sent to Mount Wudang, the other stored in the palace. In the year *renchen* [1652], the printing was completed, and the celestial work was brought to fruition. Thereafter, the immortal scripture spread far and wide, and none failed to revere it as a model. After Prefect Sun Shoushu of Shangyuan, numerous others commissioned re-carvings in convenient formats.

Formerly, the Buddha told Śāriputra: *"Such a wondrous dharma is spoken by the Tathāgatas only when the time is ripe. It was not spoken before because the time had not yet come."* Confucius said: *"When the time is to stop, stop; when the time is to act, act. In movement and stillness, if one does not lose the proper time, the Dao will be luminous."* Truly, the expounding of scriptures by immortals and buddhas, and the establishment of teachings by sages, are never apart from the proper time. I fear that the names of the good and faithful who first undertook this work for *The Three-Rank Scripture* may fade into obscurity over the long passage of time. Thus, I have recorded these details in full to preface the scripture.

Respectfully composed by Huang Chengshu of Shayi, a Traveling Daoist.

**Decree of Appointment for Ancestor Lü’s Advancement to the Rank of Supreme Mystery**
The Lord of Myriad Celestial Stars, the Northern Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, by the command of the Primordial Beginning, decrees:
*"We regard you, the Pure Yang Daoist, Perfected Lü Yan, who has endured three thousand arduous practices and accomplished the ninefold mystery of merit. You have broadly extended your compassion to save beings from kalpas and universally ferried them across on the vessel of mercy; you have opened the transformation of awakening the world and frequently bestowed the precious raft of teachings. In the southeast, you have propagated the Dao and its methods, elucidating the secrets of prior heaven; in the region of Ying and Zhen, you have expounded scriptures and revealed the essence of the Supreme Ultimate. Now that this sacred task is complete, We hereby confer upon you this decree of honor: We specially advance you to the rank of True Sovereign of the Jade Clarity, where the Dao attains its ultimate non-action, and you are most mysterious and sagely, holding the balance of the ten thousand kalpas. As the Perfected of Universal Response and Transformation, you are the patriarch of the Three Teachings, the Supreme Mystery Vast Law Heavenly Worthy, the Perfectly Penetrating Literary Vimalakīrti True Buddha. Receive this appointment and redouble your efforts in the mystery of merit. We further bestow upon you this auspicious decree: We appoint your attendant, the Willow Banner of the Guardians of the Dao, to assist in your mysterious merit and attend to the expounding of sacred tasks. We advance and appoint you as the Left Assistant of Primordial Transformation, the Supreme and Unsurpassed August One, the Jade Pivot Right Minister, the True Lord of Vast Teachings. We further confer this decree of honor: We appoint your Supreme Dharma Protector, Ge Mingyang; We advance and appoint him as the Nine Heavens’ Propagator of Transformation, the Supreme Controller of the Five Thunders, the Overseer of Immortal Registers who examines merits and demerits for promotion and demotion, the Commander-in-Chief of the Dragon Kings who bring rain over rivers and lakes, the Divine Lord who assists in transformation and propagates the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Dharmas Penetrating the Mystery. These two ministers together aid in the work of Primordial Transformation. Alas! Perfected Lü, your merits are boundless, and your transformations extend to distant lands. May you further manifest the ancestral wind of virtue and power, and may you ever uphold the supreme rank of the mystery. Obey this decree!"*

**Preface to the Three Grades of the Qingwei Scripture**
*Compiled by Wuwozi Liu Tishu of Yiling; collated by his son Liu Yincheng and nephew Liu Yuncheng Qingxu; jointly proofread by Shaxian Yixingzi Huang Chengshu*

I have heard that the Great Dao is wordless, and the supreme words are without ornament. Words that are adorned with ornament are mere ornament, not the supreme words of the world; the Dao that is spoken is mere speech, not the supreme Dao of the world. The Dao originally has no use for words, and words originally have no need for ornament. Ornament serves to adorn words, and words serve to express ornament—what has this to do with the Dao? What purpose do words serve? What use is ornament?

Yet words without ornament cannot travel far; the Dao without words cannot be transmitted through the ages. To transmit the Dao, one must employ words; for words to be transmitted, one must rely on ornament. Ornament cannot be dispensed with, nor can words.

However, when words are adorned with ornament, and ornament proliferates into myriad sounds, the ornament loses its substance, and the words become hollow and empty, devoid of truth. To speak of the Dao with empty words is to obscure the Dao through speech; to adorn words with insubstantial ornament is to obscure the words through ornament. Thus, words cannot do without ornament, nor can the Dao do without words. What is detestable about words is speech that deviates from the Dao; what is detestable about ornament is writing that departs from the classics. If ornament departs from the classics, the supreme words are obscured; if speech deviates from the Dao, the supreme Dao is concealed!

Today, the Great Dao of the world is unclear, and a swarm of words has arisen. Those who cling to sects and schools, stealing names and titles, all employ absurd and baseless words, crafting abstruse and convoluted texts to adorn their vulgar and ignoble heterodoxies—impossible to fathom or refute. As a result, sagely teachings go unheeded, and the Great Dao is obstructed. I grieve deeply over this!

To refute heterodox teachings and propagate sagely words, to reject perverse conduct and defend the true Dao, one must rely on those who illuminate the Dao. Only those who have thoroughly grasped the essence of the Great Dao and penetrated the subtleties of supreme words can correct the errors of perverse speech with their words and rectify the wrongs of heterodox ways with their Dao. Who am I? Who am I?

How dare I shoulder such a task! Yet with the prevailing malady grown deep and the moral current daily declining, I have fortunately glimpsed but a fraction of this Dao—how could I not expound its subtle words to illuminate the Way, rather than allow the raging torrent of heterodoxies to swell ever stronger, leaving the Great Dao obscured? Though my words be crude and unadorned, insufficient to radiate the splendor of the supreme Dao, in spreading the imperial grace, regulating the mechanisms of transformation, and reversing the course of kalpas, they may yet offer some small aid.

Thus, in the year *renwu*, I chanced upon the summer solstice and descended upon the Han San Altar. There, I took my own humble discourse, harmonized the essential principles of the Three Teachings, and expounded this text to guide later learners.

I have peered into the origins of the Dao: at the first stirrings of the primordial, when the Supreme Polarity first divided, movement became yang and stillness yin. One yin, one yang—thus the Great Dao is named; root yin, root yang—from them the Five Phases arise. Only humans and things are shaped by the formless transformations. The principle of the Supreme Polarity, the essence of the Two and Five, intermingles and fuses—all transformations are wondrous thereby.

Confucianism follows this Dao, Daoism follows this Dao, Buddhism follows this Dao—how can they be divided? Grasping this purport, the Two are One, without rank or hierarchy.

Moreover, those who enter the world serve as the assistants of Heaven and Earth, establish destiny for all beings, uphold the moral order, and embody the heart of creation. Thus, those who transcend the world rely on these worldly ones for protection. Yet those who transcend the world unfold the primordial transformations, preside over kalpas, save and deliver the deluded masses, and adorn the supreme governance—so too do worldly ones depend on the transcendent to harmonize and regulate. They cannot be viewed in isolation, nor mocked, nor discarded. Why then erect barriers and raise banners, only to turn kin against one another?

The ancient sages and worthies transmitted secret texts—profound in their Dao, pure in their words, and wondrous in their phrasing—all of which I fall short of. Yet while each expounded their own path, none synthesized them into a unified discourse. Thus, I have gathered the essential principles of the Three Teachings to compose these words. Is this Dao? Is this literature? It is merely the discourse of one school.

You, scholars, who apply your minds to inquiry and directly perceive the wondrous Dao of the beginningless, may proceed from what my words have touched upon to seek what they have not; from the Dao that can be spoken, to awaken to the Dao that cannot. Do not merely regard my words as literature, nor view them as mere text. Do not merely seek the Dao through words, nor confine my Dao within language and script. May the most wondrous and subtle Dao flourish thereby, and all perverse conduct, licentious rhetoric, and heterodox teachings fade away without need for refutation. In clearing the thorns from the ancestral gate and sweeping the overgrowth from the Great Dao, shall not the merit be great? This is the original intent of my words, and the fundamental purpose of this teaching—may you scholars reverently uphold it.

**Hymn of Praise to the Three Grades of the Qingwei Scripture**
*In Praise of the Sage Lord of Zitong*

The Dao and Law wondrously subtle,
The Qingwei’s virtue and Dao revered.
Ten thousand words of profound truth reveal good causes,
Purple qi pervades the Great Axis.

Harmonious qi intermingles,
Wondrous principles flow from the Yellow Court.
The Lord of the Highest Clarity and Pure Void
Leaves this hymn to open the scripture:

The human body possesses three treasures—
Spirit, essence, and qi.
They give birth to Heaven, Earth, and humanity,
From the Limitless to the Supreme Polarity.

The postnatal returns to the prenatal,
One origin unfolds its wondrous threads.
Five virtues align with the Five Phases,
Five constants govern the five positions.

The Three Powers compose this,
The Three Teachings ultimately return to One.
Sever obstructions, expel the root thieves,
When emotions dissolve, the wondrous契 is revealed.

The Dao and Law of Heaven and Earth are wondrous,
Wondrously containing profound meaning.
The realms of Jade Clarity and Highest Clarity,
The Supreme Clarity’s wondrous gate is secret.

Its revelation enlightens gods and humans,
Cultivation has its stages.
Most wondrous are the words of the Dao,
Subtly dispelling the world’s ills.

Transforming all sentient beings,
Universally augmenting their benefit.

**The Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Three Grades of Qingwei, the Peerless and Mysterious Canon of the Great Vehicle for Deliverance from Kalpas, Volume One**

At that time, the Wondrous Primordial Vast Dharma Heavenly Worthy, in the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm, within the Qingwei Palace, together with the various Great Heavenly Worthies, the Limitless Divine Kings, and the Flying Celestial Great Saints, approached the seat of the Primordial Beginning. There, they reviewed the kalpas and examined the wondrous charts.

The Heavenly Worthy, pitying the sentient beings below whose evil karma was excessive and whose kalpic destiny was grave, sighed deeply. Then, with resolute demeanor, he stepped forth from the ranks, bowed reverently, and addressed the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, saying:

"Below, sentient beings are ruled by guest qi, erecting barriers and establishing factions, slandering and attacking one another. As a result, all the ignorant and foolish follow suit without restraint, so that successive kalpic calamities persist unceasingly. Your servant now wishes to expound subtle words repeatedly to enlighten the followers of the Three Teachings, that they may all understand the principle of different paths converging in the same destination. Perhaps then these beings will cease to create obstacles and slightly preserve the true lineage.

Moreover, those who cultivate the Dao err in clinging to stale doctrines, employing misguided and erroneous practices that confuse their numinous minds, ultimately losing their root. Your servant has now, in accordance with my own understanding, gathered and selected past teachings to compose the *Three Grades* of wondrous truths, serving as a single lamp in a pitch-dark room, that ascending as immortals or attaining Buddhahood may be realized in an instant of awakening. I humbly inquire whether this is the opportune moment to present it. May the sagely compassion descend a jade decree."

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: "Excellent! Excellent! As you have spoken, you now vow with such resolve to expound the Dharma widely for all beings—this is truly unparalleled, the supreme merit and virtue. I shall now expound for you; listen carefully.

All these beings cling to their fixed views. Only through repeated and detailed elucidation, guiding them with patience and care, can each being come to clearly understand the causes and conditions within. In accordance with your request, I shall send down to the lower realms those who are sincere and tireless in their efforts, who collaborate to achieve success. Thirty kinds of beings shall be delivered and attain the supreme wondrous fruit, ranked among the celestial hosts, sharing the same station as the Golden Immortals in the Great Veil. Those who exert themselves and render service shall each receive blessings, so that in the beginning they remain unstained, and in the end they bear no burdens, all attaining their desires as they wish. You must strive diligently in this."

Thereupon, in the year of *jiashen*, the Heavenly Worthy opened the altar and established the precepts, expounding the sacred scriptures to all disciples. The Heavenly Worthy said:

"Within the human body, there are only essence, qi, and spirit—these three are called the Three Treasures. All attainment of the sagely and the effortless arises from them. Though these Three Treasures originate from the postnatal, few understand their inconceivable nature. Even in the prenatal, none may lose them. To lose these Three Treasures is to be unable to embody the effortless, thus obscuring the prenatal.

What is meant by the prenatal? It is not merely the effortless, nor the effortless effort, nor the utmost non-effort, nor the non-effort of non-effort, but the non-non-non—only such non-non is the prenatal. Yet this prenatal pervades all things. With the prenatal, the postnatal arises. Every thing’s prenatal is the one prenatal; this one prenatal becomes the prenatal of each, and each distinct prenatal forms the postnatal. Once the postnatal is formed, the Three Treasures are obtained, and thus the human being is complete.

Now contemplate the Three Treasures:

The first is called *essence*.
What is essence? In heaven, it is the Milky Way, the radiance of the sun, moon, and stars, rain and dew, hail and sleet, snow and frost, and mist. On earth, it is water, rivers and streams, the vast seas, springs and wells, reservoirs and pools, the veins of mountains and marshes, and the marrow within stone. In humans, it is essence—the root of life and nature, the blood and flesh of the body, the gums of the teeth.

The second is called *qi*.
What is qi? In heaven, it is substance, form, and appearance, yin and yang, the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, their waxing and waning, the five-colored clouds, rosy clouds and mist, the dense and the ethereal, the heart of living things, transformation and nurturance. On earth, it is virtue and power, the foundation that sustains all, the stem of the myriad things, the origins of mountains and waters, generation and destruction, emergence and concealment, the rise and fall of worldly kalpas, the sprouting of buds and shoots. In humans, it is qi—the movement of the limbs, actions and bearing, voice and brightness, scent and hearing, the commands of the body, the threshold of life and death.

The third is called *spirit*.
What is spirit? In heaven, it is the pivot, the true sovereign, the silent operation, the numinous essence of the sun, moon, and stars, the wind that stirs all things, thunder and lightning, compassion and awe, the work of creation, the origin of living things. On earth, it is potential, contraction and expansion, the forms of the myriad kinds, mountains and rivers, tranquility and stillness, the stabilizing foundation, peace and benevolence. In humans, it is spirit—the light in the eyes, the thoughts of the heart, wisdom and insight, innate knowledge and ability, the embryo of cinnabar and mercury, the governor of essence and qi, awakening and realization, the origin of the bodily frame, the basis of longevity or early death.

Such are the Three Treasures—difficult to obtain. Since they are not easily gained, how can one fail to cherish and protect them? To protect and cherish them, the work lies in purity and stillness: do not agitate the essence, nor allow it to leak; abide in the original dwelling, truly thus and unchanging. In the span of a day and night, it circulates 360 degrees and returns to the original dwelling, unchanging and unmoving, serving as the resource for elixir and lead.

Yet what is called *essence* is all gathered by *qi*. If qi scatters outward, essence will dissipate. Thus, to secure essence, one must guard qi. How to guard qi? It is essential to be desireless, clear and empty, tranquil and still, without contrivance. What is called *qi* resides only within the square inch of the *xuan* pass. Nurture it with tranquility, always at ease; its qi will be vast and boundless, chaotic and undifferentiated, pervading without gap—thus, thus.

Only then, below, will it unite with essence without obstruction, merging like water and milk into one. The great elixir’s ingredients gradually become complete. Then, apply the fire and timing, enter the crucible, and achieve the work.

What is *fire and timing*? It is the spirit. For essence cannot be gathered without qi, and essence and qi cannot be moved without spirit. Thus, to secure essence and nurture qi lies in preserving the spirit. The work of preserving the spirit lies in cutting off thoughts: within, nothing arises; without, nothing enters. All omens are abandoned; silent and empty, one is serene and fused, utterly still and without cause. Preserve it thus, and the spirit abides in its palace.

What is the *spirit palace*? It is only the cinnabar palace. Once the cinnabar palace is secured, the spirit becomes still and focused, governing essence and qi to congeal the great elixir. Its form is like an infant, returning to one’s own appearance, with skin, hair, and body all perfectly complete. Then, one exits through the gate and roams the Three Realms. In a single breath, one traverses the ten directions without obstruction, at ease and self-content, beyond all conception.

Yet if one clings to this alone, without hearing the great Dao or encountering a true person, the three disasters will come to erode and consume."

Should one fail to awaken, all accomplishments crumble to naught.

What are the three disasters?
The first is the *"Gale of the Celestial Axis."* This gale is sharp as a blade, keen as an awl. It pierces the gate, and in but three moments, threads through every joint, straight to the *Yongquan* point. Limbs and body, hair and skin—all dissolve at once, unraveling into drifting filaments, adrift without anchor.

Yet even this gale cannot erode one who has attained such power.
Then comes the *"Poison Fire,"* rising from below, surging through the crown gate, scorching the viscera, searing the limbs, singeing hair and pores. In a single breath, all turns to ash.

Even this fire and wind bring no harm to one of such attainment—such mastery may indeed be called supreme.
But without hearing the Dao, the *"Five Thunders"* arrive, each leading their legions, clashing in mutual assault. Before the Dao is heard, in an instant, spirit scatters to the four directions, never to coalesce again.

Thus, the great Dao cannot be left unplumbed. Without plumbing the Dao, one cannot escape the three disasters! All Three Treasures become as naught.

Only the enlightened adept, knowing these words, takes up gourd and straw hat, traversing mountains and rivers to seek the perfected ones, that they may expound the great Dao and forever evade the three disasters.

Yet this great Dao is most difficult to speak of. Precisely because it is difficult to speak of, one must peer into the beginningless. The beginning of the beginningless, the utmost *wu* (non-being) of the beginningless, the *wu-wu* (non-non-being) of the beginningless—this is the *xiantian* (prior Heaven). The Dao of prior Heaven cannot be conceived or discussed. If it cannot be conceived or discussed, how can it be spoken of? Yet though it cannot be spoken of, it is spoken of. To whom is it spoken, and from what does it arise?

That which can be spoken of pertains only to *youwei* (deliberate action). What is *youwei*? It is to attain through *wu* (non-being). For this *wuwei* (non-action) is the beginning of *you* (being).

What is meant by *youwei*? How does one cultivate it?
To cultivate it, one must consult the *Heart Monarch*.
The *Heart Monarch* possesses great awakening.
Observe yin and yang, their movements and transformations:
Emulate the sun, modeling its firmness and motion;
Emulate the moon, mastering its waxing and waning.
Extending this to the four seasons, one grasps their cycles, silently aligning with the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate).
Tracing back to their origin, through such broad observation of all creation, one sits in profound stillness, where only the *ming qi* (luminous qi) remains, and in that stillness, it alone abides.

Then, within the heart, nothing remains—all that was nurtured, the great elixir congealed, the infantine self, is in communion with Heaven and Earth.
Yet one must widely seek the guidance of the perfected. Without encountering a true person to reveal the subtleties, the great Dao remains obscure. Even if some clarity arises, it is but skin-deep! The profound mysteries within remain unattained. Without grasping these mysteries, how can one claim to understand the great Dao?

Thus, the great Dao must be sought through true transmission.
This true transmission has its lineage. A single touch in the dark—suddenly, all becomes lucid. Once lucid, one penetrates the profound. Having penetrated the profound, one knows the great Dao.

To name this knowing is to have attained it. Attaining this utmost profundity, one may then abide in *wuwei*.
Yet even when mastery is achieved, one must accumulate merit:
Some perform three thousand deeds, some fifteen hundred, some a thousand, some five hundred—when such rounds are complete, each attains their rightful fruit.
After accumulating merit, one must then establish merit:
Some establish a thousand deeds, some eight hundred, some five hundred, some three hundred, some a hundred and fifty, some a hundred—when such merit and deeds are complete and fulfilled, each attains their rightful fruit.

Those of great merit and deeds attain great karmic fruits:
Some become golden immortals, ranked among the celestial hosts;
Some remain in the world of men, masters of the ten thousand dharmas;
Some dwell in the Three Isles, enjoying pure and tranquil blessings.

Those of lesser merit and deeds may still abide in the *Daluo* Heaven as *wuwei* immortals, carefree and joyous, or dwell in famous mountains, or wander the impure realms as patriarchs of the Dao.

Those of shallow merit and deeds remain among springs and stones, beyond birth and extinction, forever free from the three disasters.

Thus, though the hearing of the Dao may differ in timing, there is no distinction of difficulty or ease. The rightful fruit attained depends solely on one’s merit and deeds. Each accumulates merit and deeds according to their capacity and attains their corresponding fruit.

Yet to attain fruit, one must hear the great Dao.
To hear the great Dao, one must revere the Three Treasures.
Without the Three Treasures, long life cannot be secured.
With limited years, if one’s cultivation is not deeply rooted, one may never hear the great Dao in this lifetime. Without hearing the great Dao, what has been accumulated? All such accumulation is not of great merit. Without establishing grand works or fulfilling great deeds, to suddenly aspire to sagehood and attain the great Dao is as if one had gained nothing!

Observe those who enter the Dao: they hasten with urgency, as if fearing they may not succeed, seeking the perfected ones far and wide to expound the profound mysteries. They brave perilous obstacles without fear, endure hardships without trembling, face water and fire without dread, confront demonic obstructions without confusion, and undergo all manner of trials and tribulations without regret.

Through such sincerity, the perfected ones above are moved to reveal the essentials, enabling complete awakening without hindrance. Returning to seated meditation, they silently cultivate their profound practice, gazing upward and downward, penetrating the profound, yet never ceasing. Though mingling in the dust of the world—amidst bustling markets and crowded streets—they perform myriad deeds, establish myriad merits, yet reflect that such deeds and merits may still be shallow.

Thus, they make grand vows, performing boundless deeds, establishing boundless merits, wishing that through countless kalpas, all sentient beings—knowing and unknowing—may hear the great Dao and reach the other shore. Such merit and deeds may require a thousand or ten thousand kalpas, yet remain inexhaustible. Only when such merit and deeds are fully accomplished does one attain the supreme, reaching *wuwei*, the utmost *wu-wuwei* (non-non-action). In this *wuwei*, one is coeval with Heaven and Earth, never to perish with them.

For this Heaven and Earth are both of *youwei*—of deliberate action. Where there is action, there must be an end. Heaven acts, and so Heaven ages; Earth acts, and so Earth decays. The Perfected One is of *wuwei*—since they are of *wuwei*, how could they decay or age? Before Heaven and Earth existed, this Perfected One endured; once Heaven and Earth arose, this Perfected One emerged. Though Heaven and Earth decay and age, this Perfected One remains at peace. Subtle! Subtle indeed! Such a Perfected One—even I cannot name them. Yet when one reaches the ultimate, every person is thus. Why is this so? Because of the Prior Heaven.

This Prior Heaven is possessed by all. Yet though people have it, most remain benighted—why is this? Because alongside Prior Heaven, there is also Posterior Heaven. Once Posterior Heaven arises, the Six Roots follow. With the Six Roots come the Six Consciousnesses.

What are the Six Roots?
The first is the eye-root: through it, one beholds forms and appearances, giving rise to manifold thoughts, thus obscuring the Prior Heaven.
The second is the ear-root: through it, one hears sounds, giving rise to manifold thoughts, thus obscuring the Prior Heaven.
The third is the mouth-root: through it, one utters right and wrong, giving rise to manifold thoughts, thus obscuring the Prior Heaven.
The fourth is the nose-root: through it, one smells scents and odors, giving rise to manifold thoughts, thus obscuring the Prior Heaven.
The fifth is the tongue-root: through it, one savors sweet and bitter, giving rise to manifold thoughts, thus obscuring the Prior Heaven.
The sixth is the body-root: through it, one encounters realms and conditions, giving rise to manifold thoughts, thus obscuring the Prior Heaven.

These Six Roots are called the Six Thieves. To hear the great Dao, one must first eliminate the Six Roots. If the Six Roots are not eliminated, they give rise to evil consciousnesses.

How, then, are the Six Roots to be eliminated? There was once a realized person who knew the path of elimination: regarding all perceptions and encounters, the conditions of the senses, they dwelled nowhere. They saw without the eyes, heard without the ears, sealed the mouth and restrained the tongue, passing the day like a fool. They breathed through the heels, rendering the body useless. All movements were directed by spirit. Thus, though the Six Roots remained fully intact, they were as if nonexistent. With no Six Roots, how could evil consciousnesses arise? Without evil consciousnesses, how could one fall into evil destinies?

Freed from consciousness and destiny, one is without obstruction; being without obstruction, the sovereign of the mind abides in perfect peace. When this sovereign of the mind is truly unstained, one may then set up the furnace and cast in the Three Treasures, thereby conjoining the Great Elixir. In this refining, one employs the Water within Kan, sprays the Wind of Xun, and moves the Fire of Li, uniting the Three Treasures—these three become one, and the Great Elixir is accomplished.

Once the Great Elixir is formed, Dragon and Tiger submit, yin and yang settle into their places. Yet one must also seek the guidance of exalted immortals, receiving their secret and subtle instructions to verify the fruit. As for those of lesser attainment, ignorant of the cause, they recklessly engage in fabrication, manipulating and refining with all manner of heterodox arts, drifting ever further from the Dao! Such misguided efforts invite manifold demonic obstructions, provoking the wrath of Heaven above and violating the laws of men below.

Even those who withdraw into seclusion, dwelling in mountain springs and among rocks, knowing these principles and refining qi to calm the spirit, gathering the Three Treasures to forge the Great Elixir—if their guidance is not true, they will ultimately suffer the Three Calamities. Thus is the great Dao most difficult to speak of. If even such as these cannot escape, how much less the common multitude!

Unaware of the great Dao, they disregard the Three Treasures. The Six Roots blaze ever brighter, the Seven Emotions stand fully revealed, and they treat the Three Treasures as if they were not their own.

Within the human body, there are only essence, qi, and spirit:
If one does not cherish essence, squandering it at will—like a leaking vessel into which a ladle of water is poured, bringing no increase, gradually draining away—before a single breath has passed, not a drop remains.
If one does not cherish qi, letting it scatter recklessly—like a petal of incense placed in a red-hot furnace, left to burn, with coals added—before a single breath has passed, it is reduced to ashes.
If one does not cherish spirit, letting it dissipate wantonly—like a lone lamp set before the wind, left to flicker without shelter—before a single breath has passed, it is extinguished.

Perilous! Perilous indeed!

Losing these Three Treasures is to lose one’s life, to fall into evil kalpas, revolving endlessly in cycles without cease. For us sentient beings, this Dao is expounded. If there be a virtuous person who follows what I have said—whether retreating to deep mountains, dwelling in the dusty world, residing in a Daoist abbey, or constructing a thatched hut—refining these Three Treasures without laxity, then true persons will surely appear to reveal their essentials.

Yet these sentient beings, through the six roots, give rise to the six consciousnesses; through the six consciousnesses, the Seven Emotions arise. How would they know that the Seven Emotions delude and confound the original true nature? Once the original true nature is lost, the Seven Emotions rage wildly. Now, these Seven Emotions invariably gather around love. Why is this so? For love is the root of emotion. Without attachment to love, there would be no desire; without desire, what cause for joy? Without joy, what cause for aversion? Without joy or aversion, what cause for anger? Without anger, fear does not arise; without fear, sorrow and omen are cast aside.

Thus, know that love is the seed of all emotions. If one does not sever the root but forcibly restrains it, what is restrained are but its branches and leaves. Like torrential waters, surging and swelling, their force reaching the heavens—if the source is not blocked, if the flow is not cleansed, and one merely builds dikes at will, they will ultimately breach and drown all. Like raging flames, blazing and fierce, their heat piercing the nine skies—if the fuel is not withdrawn, if the path is not cut off, and one merely attempts to extinguish them at will, they will instead feed the fire’s might, and wherever they touch, they will swiftly subdue. Like ocean tides, vast and boundless, surging and swelling—this recedes as that rises, that subsides as this rages, with no end in sight. All that is summoned or provoked follows the heart, growing through causes and conditions.

Only the perfected person knows this seed’s origin, establishes great vows, and arouses a courageous mind. Wielding the sword of wisdom, they sever its roots and shoots, exterminate its vile kind, allowing the Seven Emotions no foothold to arise. For these Seven Emotions are a great barrier, and love and desire are the barrier’s key. Sever the key, seize the barrier, leap beyond its threshold, and with hands unbound, walk freely without obstruction. Illuminating the supreme Dao, one ascends to the ranks of the lofty immortals.

I grieve for sentient beings—because of this one love, they give birth to manifold demons, raise manifold obstacles, deluded and inverted from the moment they leave the womb until death, rarely awakening to remorse! Even if a noble person were to seize them by the ear and admonish them face-to-face, it would be like drumming to a deaf man or shining a light before the blind, with no effect. Alas! Alas!

Yet some grow reckless and absurd, vainly longing to hear the Dao, begging for longevity, studying immortality or Buddhism—like a blind scribe tracing the tip of a brush, like a butcher sharpening his blade to honor the gods, like a thief praying over a stolen casket for blessings. Though they may gain something, their excesses only deepen.

Yet if one truly wishes to hear the subtlest mysteries of the supreme Dao, without severing love and cutting off the Seven Emotions, it remains but empty delusion. I shall explain these causes and conditions to you—listen carefully.

How can these Seven Emotions be eradicated? The way to remove them lies in contemplating *non-self*. What is *non-self*? The self is not truly the self; this self is not the self—what then is there to love? Yet once there is a self, one clings to it as the self. Clinging to the self as the self, nothing is not the self; nothing is not this self. Without the self, nothing is loved; yet kingdoms are not mine, yet I love and perish for them; families are not mine, yet I love and perish for them. All things—those with sound and scent, form and color, every external object—are not truly owned, yet I perish for them, like flies chasing stench, like ants swarming fat, like bees battering at windows, drawn to the light, scraping and scrabbling, greedy and ravenous, rushing like a runaway cart, craving like a moth to flame, seizing and grappling, jostling like wild ducks, flocking to the reeds, never resting.

But consider: before this self existed, what was it like? One should feel a sudden emptiness. Not only this—time passes like a white colt flashing past a gap, like morning dew, vanishing in an instant. The self becomes nothing. If the self is not the self, what is there to love? I press my hand to my heart and laugh soundlessly. With this inquiry, how can love not be removed? Once love is removed, nothing remains unremoved. Desire, aversion, joy, sorrow, fear, anger, selfishness, attachment—all vanish with love in a single stroke.

Yet people cling to love like glue, like lacquer, scarcely able to break free. Drowning in love is like falling into a vast abyss, struggling to swim upward, lost in boundless depths. I grieve deeply and offer a precious raft to ferry the drowning, yet sentient beings have sunk too long—without a ladder to my boat, how difficult it is for them!

For your sake, I have a method. What is it? First, one must cultivate endurance. How to endure? By reflecting deeply and awakening sharply. I have heard of those in the past who enjoyed utmost wealth and honor, their chambers filled with children, their halls crowded with kin and friends, every luxury—embroidered silks and fine foods—arrayed before them, their high halls and broad mansions adorned with carved beams and painted pillars, delighting the eye. Yet in an instant, all vanished. What they loved, they held in their hearts—then came demonic obstacles: plaintive wails, tender pleas, dissuasion and slander, even tears and embraces, clinging to prevent their departure. But these noble ones turned away, unmoved, regarding it all as a shattered pot, casting it off like worn-out sandals. In the depths of remote valleys, in the silence of secluded places, they sat in stillness, unseen and unheard, ensuring not a single seed of emotion remained. Only then, with minds as vast and bright as the open sky, did they mingle again with the dust and clamor of the world, passing through myriad circumstances, observing myriad phenomena, moving freely among things. Only when utterly unstained did they seek the secret gate of the supreme Dao and cultivate the Three Treasures.

Yet in this cultivation, one must first eliminate emotion, and above all, master the heart. How to master the heart? I offer the milk of the Dharma—nourish yourself well with it.

What is mastering the heart? The heart is fundamentally pure, fundamentally still, vast and at ease—this is its true nature. In mastering the heart, one must return to this nature: pure as flowing water, utterly unstained; still as a deep gorge, utterly silent; boundless as heaven and earth, unfathomable in its depth.

At ease as the boundless desert, its limits unknown.
Such is this heart—utterly empty of things.
Now like dead ashes, now like still water:
dead ashes may be kindled, still water may reflect;
now like a bright mirror, where forms pass without trace;
now like bodhi, the root of the Dao.
The bright mirror must ever be polished, bodhi ever moistened;
the bright mirror’s gall chilled, bodhi’s heart-seal imprinted.
When gall is chilled, all things flee;
when the heart-seal is imprinted, all Dao arises.
I know as unknowing, I see as unseeing,
without ear, without eye, without thought, perception, or consciousness.
Thus empty, reaching the utmost void of non-being—
only then is this heart unshakable by things.
That which cannot be shaken is called “sitting in forgetfulness.”
Only when one can forget may the Dao be transmitted,
the passes penetrated, dragons harmonized and tigers tamed,
foundations laid and mercury refined.
If one merely forgets things, one may overpower them,
but cannot pacify them.
Should one seek the secret within the Dao,
it would not only be futile, but harmful.
Know this: to hear the Dao, first slay the ringleaders.
What are the ringleaders?
The seven emotions.
Above all, sweep clean their thieves’ den,
restore the original clarity, stillness, emptiness, and vastness,
lest the six thieves gain the slightest foothold.
Why say this?
To master the heart.

To govern this single heart by eliminating the seven emotions and nurture the Great Elixir with a unified heart—yet should one employ improper methods, not only would this obscure the Dao, but also blind one’s nature.

For what is called *nature* is bestowed by Heaven. Thus, those who govern the heart do so for the sake of this nature. If the heart must be governed, how could nature be blinded? Yet the cultivation of nature cannot be delayed. How then is nature nurtured?

This nature originally arises from the beginningless, stealing from the Supreme Ultimate. After the division of the postcelestial, postcelestial nature possesses both principle and qi. Principle divides into true and false; falsehood loses the original truth. Qi divides into pure and turbid; turbidity obscures what is inherently so. Once obscured and lost, it cannot be called "nature," but is termed "postcelestial."

As for that Supreme Ultimate, principle and qi are undifferentiated, without falsehood or turbidity—this is the nature of Heaven. As for the beginningless, it cannot be called nature, nor is it destiny. Neither nature nor destiny, how then can it be termed "nature"? Originating from the beginningless, know that the beginningless is neither nature nor destiny—it is the Great Void. A single seed-point, this seed-point is the root of the utmost. From it arises destiny, and thus nature is formed.

To nurture this nature is to nurture this seed. Yet this seed is dim and indistinct, subtle and obscure, without sound or scent, without shadow or form. Where then to begin? In applying effort to nurture it, the Way of nurturing first tends to the postcelestial. Postcelestial nature possesses principle and qi, pure and turbid, true and false—none can be treated equally. How then can it be nurtured? By governing and refining it, eliminating falsehood and clarifying turbidity. Yet eliminating falsehood is not easy, and clarifying turbidity is most difficult.

I pity sentient beings and point out this Way: begin here. How to begin? Only by purifying desirelessness. Desireless, it is true; true, it is without falsity; without falsity, it is pure. Pure, it can illumine; true, it can embody. How to illumine and embody it? When purity and truth reach their utmost, nothing is not illuminated. The clarity of illumination—what Dao cannot be embodied?

Yet how to eliminate these falsehoods and turbidities? In the lower realms of Jambudvīpa, falsehood and turbidity intermingle. I point the way: one must rise high, aloof from worldly entanglements, sitting cross-legged, seeing nothing, hearing nothing. This heart, pure and unstained, can then eliminate falsehood and clarify its inherent turbidity. Once turbidity is clarified, this heart is pure, and no defiling dust can contaminate it further.

Yet humans possess a heart, and thus this nature. With this nature, how can there be no emotions? Therefore, those who govern the heart must eliminate the five senses to remove the five hindrances, thereby illuminating the five natures and penetrating the five perils.

What are the five senses?

**First: The causeless sense.**
When one sits in stillness, all sounds cease, all forms vanish. The ears receive nothing, the eyes perceive nothing. Profoundly silent, utterly undifferentiated, dull and vacant, yet suddenly a thought arises—rampant and unrestrained, like a startled deer dashing forth. It overflows the lunar cavern, extends to the celestial roots, beyond restraint or rescue. Its harm to the Dao is most severe. Thus, those who study the Dao must first eliminate this sense. How to eliminate it? By eliminating falsehood and preserving sincerity.

**Second: The anticipatory sense.**
Before encountering circumstances or events, one should let go, allowing this heart to be limpidly clear and profoundly still. Clear and still—these are the roots of the Dao. Why then, without cause, generate thoughts before circumstances arise, stir before events occur? A hundred anxieties seize and wrestle, a thousand thoughts assail and disturb. When one actually encounters circumstances, engages with events, and responds to things, it proves otherwise. Even if one’s thoughts align with reality, they exhaust essence and labor the spirit, depleting qi most severely. How much better to be without sense, yielding to spontaneity.

Thus, those who study the Dao—if this sense is not eliminated, they cannot hear the Dao. To eliminate this sense, forget circumstances and abandon affairs, stilling this heart like the Great Void.

**Third: The sense of sound and form.**
What the ears hear, what the eyes see—beauty and ugliness, myriad attitudes. From my perspective, they are like dreams and illusions. Yet, failing to awaken, one clings to them, anticipating and scheming, restless and chaotic, bustling and confused. The original substance is obscured, its brightness dimmed. Like a fool, none can remain clear. How then to seek the great Dao? Better to perish utterly.

Thus, those who study the Dao must close their ears and dim their eyes, allowing the master within to remain ever vigilant. If this sense persists, it is called affliction. Affliction and delusion know no end. Restless and uneasy, the heart’s sovereign abandons its abode. It must be eliminated, leaving the spirit bright and clear, without cause or condition. Inner and outer are at peace, the ears become eyes, the eyes become ears. Even amid extreme sounds and forms, one sees nothing, hears nothing.

**Fourth: The sense of the past.**
Virtue and misfortune, regret and shame—emotions follow circumstances and are forgotten. What is gained or lost, what is weak or strong? The deluded do not know, entangling themselves in needless affairs. Hesitant and stagnant, the heart finds no peace. Confused and anxious, without cause they act madly. To embody the Dao thus is like sailing a cup on the Eastern Ocean, boundless and unsupported, dangling a single thread over an abyss of a thousand fathoms. Not only is attainment impossible, but it invites future calamity.

Thus, those who study the Dao must eliminate this sense, avoiding attachment and stagnation. Vast and boundless, all things transform—no false sense remains to confuse true awareness.

A single private awareness, self-proclaimed cleverness—thus one strays from the true Dao. How could one know that private knowledge harms the Dao most severely? Mired in obscurity, tossed and turned, one’s qi cannot stretch forth. This not only harms the Dao but truly severs one’s nature and life.

Therefore, those who study the Dao must eliminate this awareness. If this awareness is not removed, even if other senses are abandoned, one remains ignorant of true awareness. This great Dao is like a level road—without true awareness to tread it, one falls into side paths, left-hand ways, and branching trails. Amidst a thousand streams and a hundred schools, though the rod strikes and the shout resounds, few can repent and awaken; though a compass is given, none follow it again. To forget the four senses yet retain this one is to ultimately lose one’s very form—how can one not be warned!

I grieve for such scholars and thus expound these words: be still and serene, follow nature alone, and do not contrive or act, lest you lose your original state. What is this original state? It is the nature of this heart, the awareness within that nature—this is called true awareness. The awareness of true awareness is named right awareness; the awareness of right awareness is called great awareness. This great awareness is the primordial awareness, not dependent on calculation, not reliant on principle, free from intention, certainty, fixation, or self. Following one’s original truth, yielding to nature, it ascends to the Three Heavens and descends to the Nine Abysses, luminous in the beginningless, penetrating the endless.

Subtle! Subtle indeed! In Daoism, it is called sagely wisdom; in Confucianism, communion with the divine; in Buddhism, tranquil illumination—all are true awareness, right awareness, great awareness, primordial awareness. Awareness that is not this awareness is called deluded awareness. If deluded awareness is not removed, true awareness is obscured.

Yet to eliminate the five senses, one must also dispel the five obstacles. What are the five obstacles?

**First: The obstacle of demons.**
This demonic obstacle may arise from the heart, adhere to circumstances, be stirred by things, or belong to the body. When it arises from the heart, it takes the form of views of self and others, honor and disgrace, gain and loss, right and wrong, strength and weakness, fame and profit, and the desire to prevail. The spirit terrace is thus clouded, and one cannot attain liberation. When it belongs to the body, illness and suffering assail, hunger and cold assail, success and indulgence assail, joy and sorrow assail, sloth and indolence assail, and deception and entanglement ensnare, causing constant friction and conflict. When one encounters circumstances, there is fortune and misfortune—fortune seems easy, misfortune seems difficult. Entering the world is easy; leaving it is hard. Then, when one meets things, beauty and delight fill the eyes, pleasing the heart and gratifying the will, captivating the mind. Such demonic obstacles are inherent in all people. If those who study the Dao do not remove this obstacle, they will find it difficult to hear the Dao even in death. Yet even if this demonic obstacle is removed one by one, another arises—the obstacle of doubt, which one must not remain ignorant of.

What is the **obstacle of doubt**? The great Dao is easy to know, simple to practice. A true teacher’s single point is like a lamp in a dark room, bright and clear as a crystal vase. Alas! The roots of doubt take hold: when one person speaks of the Dao, a clamor of voices drowns it out, confusion arises, and one turns from right to wrong, allowing the false to disrupt the true. It is like standing atop a tall tree, only to fall into a dark ravine. How profound are the sage’s words: *"The valley spirit does not die; it is the gate of all wonders."* How vast is the sage’s Dao: *"Emptiness responds to causes, purity and tranquility are its essence."* Why indulge in divergent theories, letting them proliferate in chaos? This is the obstacle of doubt, self-inflicted distress. Pitiable is the one who does not awaken, ultimately falling into karmic entanglement.

I tell those who cultivate: you must follow a true teacher, not be misled by heterodox teachings or stray into side paths. Cultivate clarity, emptiness, tranquility, and stillness; nurture essence and spirit. The mysterious pass and the female gate, the Yellow Mother and the infant, yin and yang, water and fire, Kan and Li, Qian and Kun—all reside within the square inch of the heart. What use are all these names? When all forms vanish, how can doubt remain? If this obstacle is not removed, confusion will multiply.

Yet even if this obstacle is dispelled, another arises—the **obstacle of principle**, which harms the Dao even more. Each clings to partial truths, none attaining a comprehensive view. The Confucian obstacle lies in the real, the Daoist in the void, the Buddhist in emptiness.

Those obstructed by the real cling to their partial principles, treating illusory realms, illusory affairs, and illusory forms as truly existent. They exhaust their wills and labor their spirits, wearing out their bodies and depleting their qi, believing all this to be in accord with principle—unaware that such words are themselves obstacles. As for human life—*"benevolence, righteousness, kindness, wisdom, loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and chastity"*—these are all the vast qi of Heaven and Earth. To act upon them with sincerity is not to treat them as empty! Yet if one’s understanding is not comprehensive, clinging to partial principles, one falls into evil karma. The warmth of benevolence, the rigidity of righteousness, petty loyalty, and foolish filial piety are scorned even within the Confucian school—how much more so for those who study the Dao? Alas, the multitude of beings, obstructed by the real, constantly fall into the pit of fire, with none to awaken them.

I expound the Dharma for them: be still and reflect. The mind-seal of sages and worthies is to silently comprehend, thoroughly penetrate, and awaken without the slightest gap.

Those obstructed by the void cling to their partial principles, sitting rigidly in meditation, purifying dust and defilement, and even claiming, *"This is where the Dao lies!"* They do not seek secret teachings, nor nurture the Three Treasures. Though they speak of attaining emptiness, this is not the Dao! For this supreme Dao does not lie in the real, nor does it reside solely in the void. Only when emptiness and reality are harmonized does one grasp the mysterious essential.

Those obstructed by emptiness cling to their partial principles, ignorant of true nature, merely discoursing on emptiness. What they call emptiness is not true emptiness but a stubborn void. In the end, they remain ignorant of the original true suchness and freedom.

How muddled they are!

All these obstructions, failing to harmonize, give rise to disparate schools and divergent paths, where adherents turn against one another with scorn, viewing each other as irreconcilable as ice and fire. Confucians dismiss the Dao as hollow, Daoists dismiss Buddhism as empty, and Buddhists dismiss both Confucianism and Daoism—endless cycles of mutual reproach. They do not realize that though the teachings of heaven and earth are divided into three, they share a single root. It is only because of obstructive attachments to partial principles that they regard one another with division.

Alas! Alas!
Obstruction by the real leads to delusion, and delusion makes awakening difficult.
Obstruction by the void leads to desiccation, and desiccation leaves no substance.
Obstruction by emptiness leads to stillness, and stillness veers toward annihilation.

The sages of antiquity were real yet able to be void, void yet able to be real. They perceived emptiness as non-empty, and emptiness as having no fixed emptiness—this is the supreme Dao. Only when these are harmonized and grasped does one transcend obstructive attachments. Yet none understand this.

Students of the Dao, take heed!
If obstructive attachments to principles can be removed, one obstruction remains: the root of this obstruction arises from *texts*. This "obstruction of texts" is truly an obstruction of the mind. The five thousand secret words all stem from mysterious realization, yet when viewed merely as texts, their essence is lost. Failing to awaken, one falls into this obstruction, giving rise to all manner of heretical words and twisted doctrines—novel and pleasing, seeping into the heart and marrow, harming nature and injuring form.

Even the ancient perfected ones, in establishing true principles, often employed allegories: some spoke of *kan* and *li*, some of the furnace and crucible, some of the maiden, some of the infant, some of the dragon and tiger, some of yin and yang, some of the Mysterious Female, some of *wu*—all allegories. Those obstructed by texts engage in endless manipulation, unaware that the great Dao lies in essence, qi, and spirit! To nurture these Three Treasures is to nurture the seed. This seed is the root of all roots. All those teachings are but manifestations of this single qi; the origin of this qi is the seed itself. Recognize the seed, and the myriad doctrines—all become dregs. Feeding on these dregs, what purpose does it serve?

Thus, texts are not the true explanation of the Dao. To embody them is to cast all aside. Having cast aside texts, one must also beware of "lineage transmission." This lineage transmission is the very source of obstructions—examine it closely.

Seeking out perfected masters to receive their subtle guidance, if one fails to find the right teacher, the obstructions to body and mind may last a lifetime. For beginners, the Dao remains a vague dream. A single misstep in choosing a teacher, and one is taught heterodox ways—endless confusion, no hope of thorough awakening. Taking these as guiding principles, they follow them for life, their body and mind bound in confinement. Even if a true person points the way to correct awakening, their hearts may reject it, their bodies may turn away, clinging instead to superficial words. With falsehood selling falsehood, falsehood believing falsehood, all manner of obstructions arise.

Thus, students of the Dao must carefully select wise teachers to remove the obstructions of body and mind. Once this obstruction is eliminated, all others dissolve in turn. With all obstructions cleared, the numinous terrace becomes pure—then one may illuminate the wonders of the five natures.

What are the five natures?
The first is the nature of water,
the second is the nature of fire,
the third is the nature of wood,
the fourth is the nature of metal,
the fifth is the nature of earth.

The nature of earth is often turbid, and turbidity leads to thickness.
The nature of metal is often decisive, and decisiveness leads to resoluteness.
The nature of wood is often compassionate, and compassion leads to benevolence.
The nature of fire is often firm, and firmness leads to impatience.
The nature of water is often yielding, and yielding leads to dissipation.

Dissipation inclines toward indolence,
impatience inclines toward harshness,
benevolence inclines toward gentleness,
resoluteness inclines toward boldness,
thickness inclines toward obscurity.

Obscurity leads to foolishness,
boldness leads to chaos,
indolence leads to deceit,
gentleness leads to entrapment,
firm harshness leads to cruelty.

Thus, when the five natures are imbalanced, their efficacy lies in mutual regulation:
Yielding overcomes firmness,
firmness overcomes yielding.
Benevolence is tempered by resoluteness,
resoluteness is tempered by benevolence.
Earth’s obscurity lacks wisdom—clarity overcomes it.
If clarity fails to overcome it, the use of yielding is lost.

Yet these five natures originate from the five phases.
These five phases are all present within the human body:
The first is water, the virtue of the kidneys;
the second is fire, the virtue of the heart;
the third is wood, the virtue of the liver;
the fourth is metal, the virtue of the lungs;
the fifth is earth, the virtue of the spleen.

Life resides in the spleen,
qi is stored in the lungs,
the *hun* dwells in the liver,
the spirit resides in the heart,
the *po* is attached to the kidneys.

Thus, those who cultivate the body cultivate these five virtues to fully realize the five natures. However, the climates of the five directions differ, and endowments vary accordingly:
Those born with the nature of water tend toward yielding, and yielding leads to indolence.
Those born with the nature of wood tend toward benevolent foolishness, and foolishness leads to obscurity.
Those born with the nature of fire tend toward firmness, and firmness leads to harshness.
Those born with the nature of metal tend toward resoluteness, and resoluteness leads to obstinacy.
Those born with the nature of earth tend toward obscurity, and obscurity leads to ignorance—ignorance leads to separation, and separation leads to turning away from the Dao.

Yet these five phases all originate from yin and yang:
The nature of water is yin,
the nature of fire is yang.
Greater yang is wood,
lesser yin is metal.
Earth contains both qi but is essentially yin.

Yet water is yin but rooted in yang—thus the nature of water is inwardly bright and outwardly dark, outwardly yielding and inwardly firm.
Fire is yang but rooted in yin—thus the nature of fire is outwardly bright and inwardly dark, inwardly yielding and outwardly firm.
Wood is greater yang but born of yin—it bends and straightens: bending is yin, straightening is yang.
Metal is lesser yin but born of yang—it follows and transforms: following is yin, transforming is yang.
Earth is the qi of harmony and is true yin.

All four are attached to it, and thus their natures each lodge in their respective flourishing phases. Know that the five phases:
Their essence clings to heaven,
their substance is formed by earth,
their spirit is attached to humans.
Water is called wisdom—its form is the hidden dragon.

Fire is called propriety—its center is the crouching tiger.
Wood is called benevolence—it is named the Mother of Wood.
Metal is called righteousness—it is called the Duke of Metal.
Earth is called trustworthiness—its name is the Yellow Matriarch.

These five natures do not transcend the five phases, and these five phases do not depart from yin and yang. As for yin and yang, they are rooted in the Great Ultimate, and the extremity of the Great Ultimate is the Ultimateless. Thus, by illuminating the five natures, one may penetrate the five *xuan*.

How is this to be understood?
Through generation and restriction:
Water can generate Wood, and the Mother of Wood is preserved;
Wood can generate Fire, and the tiger is empowered;
Fire can generate Earth, and the root of life is secured;
Earth can generate Metal, and the Duke of Metal follows;
Metal can generate Water, and the dragon’s body ascends.

Yet without restriction, there would be no control.
Thus, Water restricts Fire, and the tiger’s ferocity is tempered;
Fire restricts Metal, and Metal does not flow;
Metal restricts Wood, and the Mother does not decline;
Wood restricts Earth, and Earth does not sink;
Earth restricts Water, and the dragon does not fly.

Generation gives way to restriction, restriction gives way to generation—generation and restriction, endlessly cyclic like a ring without seam. Only then are the five phases free from imbalance, the five phases interpenetrating, and the five natures complete. One who understands this truly fathoms the ultimate principle. Through this, the subtlety of the "five *xuan*" may be inwardly realized.

What are the five *xuan*?
Some call it the *Xuan of Heaven*,
some the *Xuan of Earth*,
some the *Xuan of Dharma*,
some the *Xuan of the Dao*—
all are collectively called *xuanxuan*.

Yet these five *xuan* do not transcend yin and yang, and this yin and yang do not depart from the five phases. Thus, by illuminating the five phases, one knows the five natures; having known the five natures, one penetrates the five *xuan*.

By penetrating the *Xuan of Heaven*, one knows the Way of Heaven, follows its spontaneity, and thus attains non-action.
By penetrating the *Xuan of Earth*, one knows the principles of Earth, follows its hardness and softness, and thus achieves interpenetration.
By penetrating the *Xuan of Dharma*, one knows cause and response, endlessly transforming, with no trace to measure.
By penetrating the *Xuan of the Dao*, one harmonizes the postcelestial with the precelestial; those who act and those who do not all grasp its subtleties.
By penetrating *xuanxuan*, from heaven above to earth below, the profundity of the Dao and its methods is boundless—nothing is unknown. To know yet be without knowledge, to be without knowledge yet know all, to know all yet truly be without knowledge—this is called attaining the Dao.

For those who study the Dao and wish to penetrate the five *xuan*, first illuminate the five natures. To illuminate the five natures, first remove the five obstacles, eliminate the five senses, sever the seven emotions, expel the six thieves, and purify the six roots. Only then can one penetrate them. Yet one must seek the guidance of a perfected master to reveal the subtleties within the *xuan*, thereby knowing how to lay the foundation, establish the furnace and cauldron, gather the Three Treasures, and restore one’s original nature.

Once the original nature is established, one traverses the three realms, bestows the Dharma-milk, and universally delivers the deluded. When the three thousand practices are fulfilled and the eight hundred merits accomplished, the rainbow banner and crimson tones will descend to welcome one, ascending to the Jade Palace to attest to the rank of a perfected being.

O all you learners, strive diligently in practice.

*Eulogy by the Jade Cauldron Perfected:*
The Great Dao is empty and void, all phenomena are insubstantial;
The precelestial abides within the postcelestial.
The Three Powers weave together past and present;
The Two Qi cyclically generate, parting the primordial chaos.
When the six senses are purified, the six paths are emptied;
The Three Spirits manifest, governing the Three Teachings.
Jade liquid and golden essence congeal into wondrous forms;
The cinnabar talisman and vermilion script reveal the *xuan* vault.
The precious grove’s subtle truths open the primordial beginning;
The numinous treasure’s subtleties propagate the Dao’s wind.
A single word proclaimed is like a thunderous shout;
The three seals unsealed awaken to the sameness of emptiness.
Vastly guiding sentient beings, a great canon is formed;
Through ten thousand kalpas of rebirth, one enters the scroll of emptiness.
The embroidered ridge’s jade blossoms contain wondrous understanding;
The green forest’s azure birds sing the lineage’s work.
Where the heart of heaven is seen, boundless vastness appears;
When the earth’s axis turns, the ten thousand dharmas are mighty.
The *xuan* origin’s true principle is fully revealed;
The Dharma drum resounds universally, awakening the deaf multitude.

*Central Scroll of the Great Vehicle Scripture of Salvation from the Kalpa, the Wondrous Canon of the Three Grades of the Pure and Subtle, the Ultimate of the Dao’s Profundity, the Concordance of the Xuan*

I have heard that heaven and earth are a single qi, intermingling and nurturing, giving birth to the ten thousand things. Among them, humans alone are numinous, possessing the fullness of principle, the correctness of qi, nobly endowed with celestial nobility, richly endowed with innate capacities, exalted above the ten thousand things, and the womb of all life. To lose this near-imperceptible essence is to forfeit one’s original nature, becoming unlike the ten thousand things and falling from one’s proper rank.

To preserve it is to become a sage; to maintain it is to remain human. To stabilize it is to become great; to transform it is to become spirit. In comparison with heaven and earth, the Three Powers are triply divided. Thus, know that this body is exceedingly difficult to obtain and exceedingly easy to lose—not only easy to lose, but once lost, forever lost, falling into the cycle of rebirth without a day of respite.

I, as one who practices the Dao, reveal the five *xuan*—listen carefully to their truth:
The azure of heaven, vast and all-encompassing, has form yet no form, has image yet no image. All these forms and images originally possess fixed colors—this is their reality. Yet when discussing form and color, they are indistinct and vague, truly without fixed image, empty and traceless—how void they are! Only the void is numinous; only the real can obscure. Void and real, real and void—transformation reaches the divine.

Thus, by penetrating the *Xuan of Heaven*, one knows the void and the real, without stagnation or coagulation, following its spontaneity. Circulating transformation at will, ceaselessly revolving, the Great Elixir is accomplished.

The Way of Earth is honest and profound, boundless and bright. Above it is void, below it is real—thus the ten thousand things are nurtured. Above it is real, below it is void—thus the ten thousand things return to their root. Void and real, real and void—abiding with heaven for eternity. Its essence is steadfast stillness; its function is flowing movement. Mountains reveal wondrous substance; water manifests its spirit. Substance bears things; spirit gathers numinosity. Without spirit, there is no substance; without substance, there is no spirit. Spirit moves, substance receives; substance moves through spirit. Void and real interpenetrate, wondrously uniting as one.

Learners of the Dao who thoroughly awaken to this principle harmonize hardness and softness, mutually generating void and real.

Thus, penetrating the celestial mystery and re-illuminating this cause, with Qian and Kun fixed in their positions, the Great Elixir is achieved.

As for the Dao’s mystery—it is not attained through mere discourse. If one takes it as real, what reality is not void? If one takes it as void, what void is not real? Should one attempt to speak of void and real, where does the real reside? Where does the void become manifest? The real within the void cannot be named as real; the void within the real cannot be called void. Real is not merely real, void is not merely void—yet nothing is not void and real, yet nothing can be said of void and real.

Subtle, oh so subtle! What cannot be called void is truly void; what cannot be called real is fundamentally real. Though one cannot speak of void and real, in truth, nothing lies beyond void and real.

Profound is the Dao’s mystery—without form or image, its depth unfathomable, its essence difficult to fathom. Thus, awakening to this mystery, the elixir completes its nine revolutions.

As for the method of this mystery, it is received through transmission from a master, originating in the mandate of heaven and flowing through the earth. Once the Great Dao is accomplished, its principles reach divine subtlety, transformations arise from the heart, and spiritual powers become unfathomable.

Heaven and earth are but a sack; sun and moon, a flask within. A mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru; the great chiliocosm, a hair’s tip. Wielding gold across the eight directions, the six directions are but dust. Now joined, now parted; now fleeting, now eternal; now hidden, now manifest—void and emptiness dissolve into obscurity. Commanding spirits and dispatching ghosts, thunder and lightning intermingle.

Call it void—what is not present? Call it real—what is not absent? Obtaining the mind’s response in the hand, mind and hand imprint upon each other. When the mind is no-mind, what does the hand gain? Not grasped by the hand, it moves with the heart—endless transformations, with heaven and earth as witness.

Subtle, oh so subtle! Endlessly generating, only by penetrating the Dao’s mystery can one attain this principle.

Thus, to penetrate the Dao’s mystery is to achieve the Way. Of its first mystery: no words can speak it, all thought and deliberation must cease. Subtle and elusive, it fades into the imperceptible, vanishing beyond sound and form. For a thousand, ten thousand kalpas, none have transmitted it.

Now, for the world, I expound this principle—you, my disciples, listen in stillness.

This mystery, of old, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke. I have secretly heard its teaching: from heaven above to the boundless multitudes, among them are perfected beings who delve ever deeper into mystery. Heaven is their steward, earth their attendant. All beings—seen and unseen—converge at the utmost limits. They govern the transformations of past and present without trace or track, presiding over kalpas without beginning or end.

The sacred cannot be made sacred; the numinous cannot be made numinous.
No-no-no-no—yet in no there is being;
Void-void-void—yet in void there is reality.
The sage gains nothing; the fool loses nothing.
Heaven abides at the center, yet heaven knows it not;
Earth bears its flow, yet earth does not recognize it.
All things reach their extremity, yet move unaware.
Its presence is not presence; its passing is not passing.
Such is its mystery—how can it be conceived? How imagined?
If one penetrates this principle, mystery upon mystery unfolds.

These five mysteries are not easily mastered. Those who study the Way must thoroughly investigate its meaning, cast aside all distractions, and delve in silent inquiry. Only then can understanding transcend, and dark enlightenment be uniquely grasped. Profound and subtle, one begins to perceive the original truth. Seeking the hidden key, cinnabar and lead are self-sufficient; furnace and fire require no external instruction. Yin and yang settle into place, dragon and tiger harmonize in exchange—no need for manipulation, for it arises naturally.

If this is not understood, the dust of the senses clings, the six roots seize control, the seven emotions blaze fiercely, and one falls into the burning house—how then can the subtleties of mystery be fathomed?

Now I reveal this teaching—who among you can awaken?
Then myriad divergent doctrines arise, factions divide, each clinging to one corner, turning to scorn and ridicule. At first, they grasp at principles, debating and exhorting; each holds to a single view, establishing theories and teachings. Though all claim to serve the Way, defending it left and right, their words may grow excessive, yet their intent to clarify the Dao remains sincere.

As the tradition drifts further, private corruptions multiply. They strike at one another, rallying factions, claiming to defend the Way—yet in truth, they defend themselves! Tracing their origins, all are outsiders to the gate.

Alas! Alas!

Such people—among the Confucians, they are rot; among the Daoists, they are thieves; among the Buddhists, they are offshoots of delusion—what difference do their muddled dreams make?

Yet do they not know that the Three Teachings originally sprang from one source? If one grasps this unifying principle, all distinctions may dissolve. Before Fuxi’s time, what divergence was there? When the Sage Confucius was born, the Most High manifested transformation, and their teachings resonated in mutual accord. As the Dao of human nature flourished, one path emerged outward, another inward.

The teaching of worldly engagement first upholds human relationships: the dignity of ruler and father, the loyalty of minister and filial piety of child, the fraternal affection of siblings, the shared Way of husband and wife, the procreation of offspring—thus the cosmos endures through the ages, nurturing all beings. Heaven and earth serve as complements, the transformative mechanism never fails, and creation is thereby assisted. If this teaching were obscured, the world would be deaf and blind for ten thousand generations. When the earth was full and the land abundant, at the dawn of primordial chaos, the world was indistinct, above and below lost their support—thus we know this teaching is the pillar of the Dao. Yet deluded about its origins, how could one even begin to discuss it?

Alas! This supreme teaching, long since distorted, now yields only the distinctions of success and failure, nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty, high and low, great and small, strong and weak, many and few, self and other. Bound by the snares of fame, profit, and temporal power, souls drift through the cycles of birth and death, trapped in endless inversion. Strife, plunder, and theft arise; deceit proliferates; a hundred schemes emerge to dupe the people. Treacherous heroes appear intermittently, muddying human relationships. They forge alliances through power, vie with one another through ability, unleash the blades of their tongues, and blur right and wrong. Debates rage back and forth; those of the same kind attack one another. Each raises its red banner, a single principle splintering into chaos. One view deems this right, another deems that right; those who agree flock together, those who differ mock. Without distinction or clarity, gain and loss, right and wrong, their essence and subtleties remain unfathomed.

Do they not know that within difference lies sameness, within sameness lies difference, and within both difference and sameness, further distinctions arise? Right and wrong intermingle, gain and loss diverge. They indulge their arbitrary opinions, heedless of reason. Even within the same teaching, they treat one another like sworn enemies, ceaselessly attacking, never at peace. Who among them remains impartial, their judgment unclouded? Alas! Who can awaken to these essential words? If even those of the same school are so treacherous, what of others?

Moreover, there is this saying: the corruption of the human heart begins with the corruption of writing. Those who study writing excel in externals; all their words are adorned with embellishment, their polished phrases fixated on outward display. A heart turned outward must neglect what lies within; a heart bent on pleasing others must forget itself; a heart set on transmitting to posterity forgets self-cultivation; a heart seeking victory forgets self-restraint; a heart boasting of breadth forgets to return to simplicity; a heart enamored of ornate beauty forgets to uphold sincerity. Craft and pretense grow daily, while the true essence withers.

Since the rise of writing, the principles of nature and destiny have grown obscure—can one not be wary? Can one not be cautious? I have heard it said: the patterns of heaven shine brilliantly in the Milky Way; the patterns of earth dazzle in the transformations of grasses and trees; the patterns of humanity gleam in resounding music and refined ritual. All emerge naturally, without contrived adornment. The highest writing is no writing at all; true writing arises from reality. Writing that arises from reality is the highest. Later generations produce much writing, yet it is as if there were none. Writing that is not writing, writing that is not truly writing—such writing is no writing at all.

What is even more lamentable is that, through the habit of writing, nothing remains unheard, yet what is heard is not what should be heard. They amass vulgar knowledge, boasting of their wild erudition. The most revered lack true writing; the most intimate lack true writing. All conduct is performed through writing, and craft and pretense arise. What is not loyalty or filial piety is made to appear so through writing; what is not friendliness or respect is made to appear so through writing. They indulge in the inner chambers, composing ornate speech. All their actions transgress propriety and abandon restraint. Adorning them with writing only deepens the corruption, leading to calamity—like the hammer of Zui or the decay of Lu—all are tainted. When substance is disguised with ornament, falsehood replaces truth; when simplicity is abandoned for artifice, machinations flourish. Beings lack constancy, becoming not only disloyal, unfilial, undutiful, unkind, and unrighteous, but worse. Fraud, theft, deceit, and pretense openly defy the law; cruelty and malice, whether fierce or cunning, secretly hatch venomous schemes. The ancient Way is lost, and people of this age remain unawakened. The river flows downward—none can turn it back.

Confucianism, having lost its substance, grows ever more tangled and false the further it spreads. Yet its followers remain unaware, forming societies and forging alliances, mutually praising one another while slandering others. They fabricate accusations against the Supreme, revile the Buddha, and curse the ancestors; they deny the existence of ghosts and spirits, mocking Buddhism and Daoism. The true teachings and orthodox lineages they dismiss as heterodoxy; the scriptures of immortals and the sutras of the Buddha they condemn as heresy. They claim that Daoism and Buddhism abandon human relationships—yet do they not know that such people not only abandon them but also bring calamity upon this world and its people? Why is this so? Because these Confucians are the people’s exemplars; if their standard is crooked, their shadow will be even more so.

Yet these are but petty Confucians, rotten and deluded. The great Confucians are not like this. The great Confucians see directly to the root, knowing that the Confucian Dao, the Daoist Dao, and the Buddhist Dharma share a single thread, with no division. Confucianism and Buddhism both originate from the Dao; the Dao is rooted in human nature, and nature in turn is rooted in Heaven. Heaven has no dual principles, and humanity has no Three Teachings. The division into three arose from later perspectives; tracing back to their origins, they are one without distinction. The great Confucians understand this and make no divisions. Each fulfills their Dao in their own way: serving their lord with loyalty, exhausting their allotted role; serving their parents with filial piety, exerting themselves to the utmost; brothers being friendly and siblings respectful, adapting to their station.

At the inception, husband and wife establish order to guard against licentiousness. In serving the spirits, sincerity is paramount; in governing people, benevolence is key. Love extends to plants and trees, kindness blankets insects and all creatures. Revering Heaven’s bright mandate, treading upon earth with caution, one remains without shame in solitude, humbly upholding virtue.

Those who understand the transformations of the Dao do not confine teaching to a single method; they merely discern right from wrong, refraining from reckless criticism—such are the sages and worthies. The Dao culminates in Heaven, serving as both sovereign and teacher. In grand governance and assisting creation, the positions of ruler and minister are fixed; father and son observe strict distinctions; the Way of friendship and respect is established among peers; the bond of brothers is unbroken; the Dao of husband and wife is upright, with yin and yang free from error.

Heaven and earth assume their positions, and the myriad things flourish in tranquility. Wind and rain are harmonious, cold and heat arrive in due season. Auspicious omens and blessings gradually appear, while inauspicious sounds and perverse qi dissipate. People and creatures enjoy benevolence and longevity—how do immortals and buddhas differ from this?

Born to honor the world, one ultimately returns to the Supreme Clarity, establishing the ultimate for heaven and humanity, enduring with heaven and earth.

The Buddhist teachings of the Pure and Subtle originated in the vast kalpas. Contemplating emptiness through emptiness, they attain the stillness of extinction. Long ago, there was a perfected one named Dipamkara, who arose in the middle antiquity and turned the great Dharma wheel, teaching and liberating countless beings, marking the flourishing of the Buddha’s transmission.

Later, a buddha appeared, known as Śākyamuni. Descending from the Tuṣita heaven, he incarnated in Jambudvīpa in the year of *Jiayin* during the reign of King Zhao of Zhou. In the western Indian kingdom of Kapilavastu, ruled by King Śuddhodana, the prince was born on the eighth day of the fourth month, adorned with thirty-two marks and eighty excellences. Due to his past vows, he renounced his kingdom to cultivate the Dao.

For six years on Snow Mountain, he engaged in intense meditation and ascetic practice. A magpie nested upon his head, vines pierced his shins, and on the eighth day of the twelfth month, upon seeing the morning star rise, he suddenly attained supreme enlightenment. Possessing the six supernatural knowledges and the strength of a great being, he opened the path for the future and continued the past, expounding the teachings in the western regions.

First at Deer Park, then in Jetavana Grove—where gold was spread upon the ground—the Buddha’s teachings flourished. For forty-nine years, his manifestations and teachings were manifold. At that time, bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, along with upāsakas and upāsikās, numbering in the thousands, all gathered to hear the Dharma, and none failed to attain liberation.

Among them was Śāriputra, foremost in wisdom, through whom the Buddha often expounded the essentials of the Dharma. There was also the great disciple Mahākāśyapa, who received the Buddha’s mind-seal and transmitted the Buddha’s true lineage. The Buddha personally bestowed upon him the prediction, making him the first patriarch. Another disciple, Ānanda, foremost in learning, after the Buddha’s parinirvāṇa, transmitted the Buddha’s scriptures, disseminating them among humanity. The present Buddhist canon derives entirely from his teachings.

Later came Bodhidharma, who with great spiritual powers in a single night subdued thirty-six places of heretical and external paths, making vast vows. From western India, crossing the Ganges’ sands, he arrived in Jambudvīpa, expounding the Dharma and propagating the teachings. The Chan school flourished, imparting secret instructions to those who attained sudden enlightenment, illuminating the mind and seeing their nature.

The Buddha’s Dharma is not extensive—all is swept away. A single word or phrase suffices to penetrate the original nature. All cleverness, knowledge, and learning are discarded; in profound silence, one nods in understanding of the essential principle. Awakening to the truth of causes and conditions, one realizes that where there is nothing, there is no nothingness, and where there is emptiness, there is no emptiness.

Inwardly observing this mind, it is like the vastness of space, like the moon reflected in a thousand rivers, like a mirror or a bubble, like fragrance within a flower. Thus, in this emptiness of emptiness, with nothingness of nothingness, there is nothing to grasp. The wonder of a single word is unobstructed and boundless. Before nothingness, there is no before; after nothingness, there is no after. Not through hearing or seeing, but in an instant of sudden transcendence, one lets go of all perceptions and knowledge, collapsing into self-oblivion.

Through causes and conditions, one attains the causeless; thus, the Chan school flourished. There were also many great Dharma masters through the ages, well-versed in the sūtras, vinaya, and śāstras, who drew from the great Dharma treasury. They elucidated and translated texts, uncovering their profound meanings, and transmitted them throughout the three thousand great thousand worlds and all of Jambudvīpa. For the sake of sentient beings, they expounded boundless causes, resolving afflictions and burning heat, transforming them into a realm of cool purity. They rescued beings from suffering and distress, delivered them from the peril of the burning house, saved wandering spirits from the hellish realms, and liberated the six paths, granting the joy of heavenly and human existence. Their benefits were immeasurable, and the Buddhist teachings prospered.

As the transmission endured, its essential meaning faded. Among the monastic community, few received the true transmission. They plagiarized from east and west, making language their foundation, engaging in verbal sparring and contests of wit. The so-called "Chan" was meant to expound profound mysteries and recognize one’s original face, without relying on superficial adornments. Yet if one examines its flaws, it harms later generations, causing them to lose the true lineage and burdening the host of beings.

Some, leaving their homes, enter into nothingness, drifting in vagueness, falling into wild-fox Chan, deluded and reckless, scolding buddhas and reviling patriarchs, yet posing as great teachers. Even worse are those who, utterly deluded, falsely transmit and inherit, passing on their errors in turn. The Tathāgata’s Dharma—what Dharma is there in all dharmas? To investigate the root, all dharmas are emptied. Texts are not established, yet not because texts are to be discarded—lest later learners, seeking within texts, lose their original nature. Thus, texts are abandoned. Yet who realizes that texts are difficult to entirely discard? Those who discard texts—have they ever followed the current? Clinging to texts, viewing them as texts, not relying on texts to fathom the Buddha’s secret essence, they lose the true lineage—this is the obstacle of texts, which harms the Dao!

Even more pitiful are those who, unaware that these sūtras are the Buddha’s mind-seal, transmit them among humanity to broadly expound the Dharma for sentient beings, enabling some to gain understanding. Even the dull and ignorant, who cannot comprehend, rely on these sūtras for repentance. The purpose is to inspire reverence in such beings, so that through daily recitation, they may eventually awaken, relinquish thoughts of life and death, cultivate virtuous deeds, escape the cycle of rebirth, or penetrate the profound and ascend to the supreme vehicle. It is not merely through recitation, without a repentant heart, that sins can be absolved.

Even when merely reciting with the mouth, one still gains benefit. For in that moment of recitation, great joy arises, and with resonant chanting, all beings—whether unseen or manifest, demons or alien kinds, lingering spirits or remnant offshoots—hear this sūtra and universally receive its sublime advantage, all attaining deliverance.

Yet it is not that merely reciting with the mouth, without a mind of receptivity, without a heart of reverence, without a heart of sincere faith, without a heart of exultation, without a heart of equitable benefit, without a heart of selflessness, truly constitutes sūtra-recitation or yields merit.

As the current flows downward, day by day it decays. All Buddhist scriptures are treated as mere means for clothing and food. Those who recite sūtras seek only empty words; those who chant sūtras respond with empty words. Because of these empty words, all beings belittle this sūtra, and the Buddhas’ Dharma comes to have no place of abiding.

Know that this sūtra possesses great liberation: like the *Guangling San*, it transforms all vexations; like the wish-fulfilling jewel, it transforms all afflictions; like the prajñā boat, it ferries the drowning; like the pāramitās, it generates all vital essences; like the lamp in a lacquered chamber, it illumines all darkness. Endowed with these and countless other benefits without measure.

Merely treating the text as empty words, skimming it carelessly—such is like chaff, of what use could it be? For this reason, the Chan school has swept all such aside. Turning the mind inward in dark contemplation, voiding both inner and outer forms, sitting in silent stillness, grasping the single point of inquiry, exhaustively probing its purport—there is a return to emptiness. Yet emptiness is no-emptiness; precisely because there is no emptiness does this purport become clear. As when one lights a torch in a dark room, nothing remains unseen, nothing fails to shine forth; no obstructions remain, and with no obstructions, the essence of mind is fully possessed, the celestial nature complete. One moves with heaven and earth, unconfined by things, not possessed by things. This is called *Brahman*—its sound pure and penetrating, uniting darkness and light. This is called Chan—its principle profound and subtle. When gods and humans fully fathom it, they become seeds of Buddha-bodhi. Just so, just so: such is the great intent of the Western advent. Thus is the Buddha-Dharma exhausted.

As for the Dao, it opened with the Primordial Beginning, revealing its secret purport, flowing forth in silent constancy, from which the Dao gave birth to the Dharma. The Dharma was transmitted as the *Lingbao*, manifesting boundless responses—golden precepts and jade statutes governing heaven and earth, commanding gods and humans. Yet among those multitudes of beings, none obtained the hearing of the Dao; the Dao-Dharma went untransmitted. Then the Most High descended in birth, exhibiting many divine marvels. His sacred mother bore him from beneath her left armpit, emerging from the womb’s numinous chamber beneath an auspicious plum tree. In an instant, his beard and hair turned white, and he took "Plum" as his surname. Though eighty-one years had passed since he left his mother’s womb, he appeared at the same time as the Sage of Ni Mountain and the Buddha of Snow Mountain, together becoming the three ancestral teachers of the teachings. A model for all humankind, he transmitted the Dharma without limit. His five thousand and more words, each a wondrous truth, were hidden among the annals of the historiographers, yet none grasped them. Purple qi came from the east; a blue ox crossed to the west. There was one, Shanshi, the Keeper of the Pass, who had long awakened to the true constancy but had not yet grasped its purport. Beholding these numinous traces, he knew an extraordinary person was near. Leaving his post, he pledged his sincerity, kneeling to the ground, bowing his head toward the seat, and begged for the teaching. The secret texts of the *Dao* and *De* were personally transmitted to him, passed down to later generations as the essential purport of the Dao. Entering or leaving the world, those who hear these words receive boundless benefit. Grasping its essential purport, they attain long life with heaven and earth, endure through all kalpas, transcend the destinies of the six paths, and ascend beyond the realms of humans and gods. Following the positions of heaven and earth, their years cannot be reckoned; they are one with heaven and earth yet do not share in their decline.

Then, in later propagation of the teaching, there were eighty-six transmissions, through which many perfected ones transcended to grasp the principle of constancy. The Dao-Dharma spread widely, becoming a ladder and ferry for all immortals. Those who awakened to it dwelt in the round harmony of the celestial sphere, in purity, emptiness, stillness, and tranquility. Penetrating to the root-source, they regarded all contrivances—manipulations and substitutions—as beneath their notice. They attained the true teaching, thereby rectifying gods and humans and reaping boundless fruit.

Later, the Dao was transmitted as the Gate of Purity and Stillness, yet none succeeded it. Thus arose the teachings of cultivating life: harmonizing yin and yang, exchanging water and fire, drawing from *kan* to fill *li*, piercing the gates of constancy, establishing the foundation and stirring the mercury, setting up the cauldron and kindling the furnace, refining qi and smelting essence, rousing the spirit and primordial origin, congealing the golden elixir, nurturing and gestating it, thereby receiving the numinous embryo and completing one’s true form. Through these postcelestial practices of every kind, one returns to the precelestial true body. Though this falls short of the Most High’s true essence of the *Dao* and *De*, it remains a correct Dharma-eye treasury of cultivation. Yet as its transmission grew distant and its branches multiplied, there arose all manner of heterodox byways and left-handed paths. Stealing fragments of its teachings, they fabricated perverse doctrines, clogging the true path. Some took true yin to nourish the cauldron’s lead, or true yang to augment the cauldron’s mercury; others practiced stealing yin to exchange for yang, inhaling moonlight and exhaling essence to aid its growth. Thus, wicked persons falsely attached themselves to these evasions, setting up cauldrons to harm others for their own gain. Even more outrageously, they committed all manner of evil deeds, cunningly deceiving the ignorant, leading them to fall into wicked arts, lose the true teaching, and forfeit their lives and natures, forever trapped in the wheel of rebirth—deeply pitiable indeed.

There were also those who, deludedly aspiring to the great Dao, knew these to be evil causes yet pursued right awakening without obtaining the true transmission. Seeking on paper, they took all stale words as the Dharma’s milk, mistaking chaff for nourishment. Thus, they sat in stillness, holding their breath and concentrating their spirit, adjusting the fire-timing between midnight and noon. Little did they know that the gate of constancy’s single true aperture remained unlocated—how could they pierce it? Attempting to raise water, they found water could not be raised; striving to lift true yang, they drew it from its original abode, never to recover it. Compared to mere dry sitting, which accomplishes nothing, their calamity was far more dire. Little did they know that the great Dao lies solely in purity and stillness—any contrivance breeds endless ills!

This great Dao originally resides in the Non-Ultimate, the root of the Supreme Ultimate. It generates yin and yang, creates and transforms the ten thousand things, nurtures and sustains living beings. Its functions are vast and boundless; its fundamental substance is thusness—formless and imageless, colorless and soundless, without scent, taste, or dharma. Because it is nothing that can be nothing, it requires nothing to be done. In purity, emptiness, stillness, and tranquility, it is unobstructed in its fundamental substance. Because it is unobstructed, it is undamaged; because it is undamaged, it suffers no loss; because it suffers no loss, the Dao-body is complete. Its fundamental substance is perfectly luminous; its wondrous functions manifest and operate, transforming in ways beyond measure. Responding without intention, it pervades darkness and light, contains heaven and earth, spans past and present, illumines all humankind. Without beginning or end, without large or small, it is nowhere absent, nowhere inactive. Emerging from being, entering non-being, it is the ancestral root of all things.

Thus, to trace the current is not as good as seeking the source. One who attains the source will thereby clarify the current. Though one may trace the current to reach the source, if the current is exhausted, the effort will only multiply complications.

Thus the perfected person expounds the teaching of purity and quiescence, revealing the true mystery within the Jade Chamber, with no other purpose. Solely pointing to the original source, they enable one to transcend from the mystery, sweeping away all else so that the Great Dao becomes luminous.

One who illuminates the Great Dao employs no deliberate mind, yet this mind is truly realized. Because it is without deliberate use, nothing is not attained, and in attaining nothing, there is nothing not penetrated. Through this all-penetration, one becomes a true person. Awaiting such a true person, the wondrous Dao unfolds.

Alas, the prevailing winds of the age gradually dilute its purity and dull its clarity. From these winds arise such people; from such people arise such teachings. Those who adhere to the Confucian teaching dismiss Buddhism and Daoism. Though they engage in debate, they merely discuss its branches, never fully grasping its origin. Thus, their refutations are often flawed and incomplete.

In their ultimate purport, Confucians speak of this life, this mind, this nature; Daoists do the same, and Buddhists likewise. In their initial endowment and reception, there is no difference. Only in their cultivation and attainment may there be divergence.

For Confucians, to be sincere is to first extend one’s knowledge, yet the extension of knowledge is fundamentally empty. Thus, one seeks it in things, making the investigation of things substantive. Once the nature of things is clarified, the original knowledge is thereby extended. With the substance of knowledge thoroughly penetrated, one is pervaded by luminous harmony. The governance of the five senses is as if illuminated, with no obscuration. The lord of the mind is at peace, and the Mandate of Heaven resides within me.

This nature and life are one across the Three Teachings. Not only Confucians can clarify their virtue; Buddhists do likewise. Yet their methods of cultivation differ according to their respective lineages.

The Buddhist teaching speaks of emptiness. Thus, the lesser śrāvakas, through their hearing, fall into the second level. Why is this so? Because the śrāvaka’s awakening plays with spiritual penetrations, attained through cleverness and insight. If such practices are misapplied, one easily strays onto other paths, losing one’s original nature. Even without misapplication, as one follows the tracks, one remains bound. In the Dharma of the Buddha, to be transcendentally and profoundly attuned, without the slightest attachment or hindrance, is not their ultimate purport. Thus, they sweep away all written words to seek the true essence alone. Once the true essence is thoroughly penetrated, the myriad transformations are all pervaded.

The śrāvakas’ investigation is none other than the extension of knowledge; their insight and realization are none other than sincerity and rectitude. When sincerity is achieved, clarity naturally follows—what need is there for the labor of extending knowledge? For the extension of knowledge belongs to the Dao, serving as the threshold between dream and awakening. Sincerity and rectitude distinguish between humans and ghosts. Once intention is sincere, one escapes the realm of ghosts and transcends to the state of humans and heavens. What use is there for the investigation of things and extension of knowledge? Thus, the Buddhist path of entry is swifter, while the Confucian method is more meticulous. Yet in their ultimate achievement, they are one and the same.

As for our Dao, it is fundamentally non-action, yet in its essentials, there is nothing it does not accomplish. Through contemplation and realization of the mystery, through broad observation and comprehensive inquiry, one investigates the original source. Once the original source is attained, nothing further need be done. In its method of cultivation, it also involves the extension and investigation of knowledge, though what is extended and investigated differs slightly from the Confucian approach. What is contemplated and realized is subtly akin to the Buddhist method. The dissimilar is not truly dissimilar; the similar is not truly identical. Yet when one traces their origins, what difference is there?

Thus, the Three Teachings stand like the legs of a tripod, each indispensable. Subtle or manifest, they are one without duality. Confucianism governs the world; Daoism aids the times; Buddhism, through its teaching, sustains this world and delivers sentient beings, universally fostering grand assemblies.

Since the beginning of time, all people have followed Confucianism, cultivated the Dao, and studied Buddhism. Who among them has attained sagehood or worthiness? Who has become an immortal or a Buddha, reaching the ultimate? Those who practice Confucianism don their Confucian caps and robes, appearing as Confucians, yet in truth are not. They amass vast learning and memorization, hunting for fame. They neglect the cultivation of their own conduct, and when turning inward in solitude, they bear much shame. With their minds obscured and the principle of sincerity utterly lost, measured against the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, what have they truly practiced? With arrogant ambition and lofty rhetoric, they constantly invoke the ancients, skillfully relying on their words. Yet in reality, they err greatly, losing their original nature.

These Confucians should awaken a mind of purity and quiescence, avoid falling into evil causes, relinquish notions of self and others, and fulfill their respective duties. They should embody their forms and recover their natures, faithfully practicing what they profess. Toward their lords, they should be loyal; toward their parents, filial; toward friends, loving and respectful; honest and trustworthy, never deceitful. They should approach the multitude with kindness and nurture all things with benevolence. Neither arrogant nor stingy, they should remain receptive and humble, not insulting the widowed or oppressing the helpless. Free from greed and licentiousness, they should not violate their original nature.

The true immortals of the Dao and the ancient Buddhas of Buddhism are no different. Such people alone can worship the gods, for the gods are none other than themselves; they alone can revere the Buddhas, for the Buddhas are their equals. Without artificial cultivation, the Dao-body remains eternally pure; without contrived realization, the Buddha-nature is perfectly luminous; without forced qi-nurturance, the Great Elixir forms naturally; without deliberate insight, the principle of Chan is authentically imprinted.

In heaven, they are heaven, revered by name; among humans, they are humans, universally honored and cherished. Abiding eternally in the Three Realms, their sacrifices are fragrant. For ten thousand generations, they are relied upon. The lineage of the Three Teachings, these great sages and worthies, are revered for all time. They move through yin and yang, governing heaven and earth. Above, they cover; below, they support, enduring without end. Whether called Buddha or immortal, whether Buddhist or Daoist, none do not revere and honor them. Neither born nor destroyed, without equal or peer, the patriarchs of the Three Teachings return to a single root.

You, my disciples, should faithfully receive and practice this.

**Eulogy of the Perfected One of the Jade Casket’s Wondrous Form**

The mystery thoroughly penetrated, the mystery’s mystery wondrous,
The Three Teachings return to one origin.
The Primordial Unity unfolds, revealing the ancestral wind,
The Dao’s law initiates the chaos of origins.
The myriad forms all empty,
The profound canon benefits without end.

The Three Grades of Pure Subtlety reach the ultimate mystery,
Contemplating the wondrous canon of the Great Vehicle,
The True Scripture for Crossing the Kalpa, Lower Scroll.

The Root of the Great Dao originates from the beginningless,
Giving birth to heaven and earth, to humans and all beings—
Nothing exists without it, nothing is without its presence.
At times it rests in stillness, its mechanism concealed;
At times it moves in action, its spirit in motion.
Emerging from being, entering non-being, it is the root of all transformations;
Entering the hidden, emerging into the manifest, it is the heart of creation.
The ancient is not ancient, nor is the present merely present.
Subtle, oh so subtle—it cannot be named,
Yet when named as the Dao, the name arises from man.

I have heard that in the distant past, before the Great Ultimate unfolded,
There was only primordial chaos, a single qi in undifferentiated fusion.
Yin and yang intertwined, in utter confusion,
Heaven and earth were inverted and disordered,
The Five Phases jumbled in disarray,
Qian and Kun lost their proper sequence,
Sun and moon lacked illumination,
Humans and beings melted away,
The world was submerged—now present, now absent,
Floating and sinking, vague and indistinct,
Drifting in turbid chaos, rising and falling without anchor.

At this kalpa’s turning, all the supreme sages—
Immortals, Buddhas, Perfected Ones,
Celestial emperors, divine lords,
Ancestral patriarchs, exalted venerables,
All vajra-like indestructible dharma-bodies—
Faced this cataclysmic convergence.
Moved by its devastation, their spirits gradually waned,
Form and spirit mutually transformed,
Failing to preserve their original truth.
Once lost, forever lost—
Their roots severed, their eons of austerities,
Their kalpas of good causes, all undone.
None remained to sustain existence.

Then arose a Most Perfect One, named Yuanshi,
Who, pitying this kalpic fate, displayed his mighty spirit:
He gathered all the Heavenly Kings, Indras,
Supreme sages, exalted Perfected Ones,
All ancestral lords, the roots of bodhi,
Every sacred and divine being,
And enclosed them within a millet grain, concealing it in a pearl.
Again, he gathered the primordial roots of the ten thousand qi,
Placing them within a single fingernail,
And offered them to the Most Perfect One, called Wuxiang.
He received them into his sacred orifices,
Passing through thirty thousand kalpas,
Enduring one great assembly,
Nurturing and cultivating them,
Feeding them with primordial qi,
Infusing them with divine essence,
Revolving them within the numinous womb,
Cherishing them with original intent.

From zi to chou, the great qi first congealed,
Primordial winds gradually stirred,
The original lord shaped and molded,
Until a single qi arose,
Floating upward in misty vapors.
Thus, the pure and light coalesced,
Forming a vast, swirling expanse.
Revolving without cease,
Passing through thirty thousand kalpas,
Ever turning, never halting,
Gradually refining and harmonizing,
This one qi shed its dregs,
Condensing into earth—
The heavy became turbid,
Binding the eight directions.
The coarse formed mountains and ridges,
The clear became flowing streams.
From these currents and peaks,
Mountains and rivers were smelted and transformed.

All things, the essences of the Five Phases,
Each took its refined essence,
Assuming form and appearance,
Scattered across the earth,
Gathering primordial qi,
Forever stabilizing Kun’s steadfastness.

Above, the vast heavens whirled and danced,
A single qi embracing and lifting,
Repeatedly condensing its essence.
Thus, the earth’s way endured through ancient ages,
Unshaken, standing opposite heaven,
Ever generating, ever transforming.
The upper bestowed, the lower complied,
Without end, without limit—
Now bearing, now completing,
An unbounded transformation,
Heaven and earth fulfilling their capacities.

From this interaction of heaven and earth,
Pan Gu emerged—this Great Most Perfect One.
Moved by the cosmos’ chaos and obscurity,
With qi’s mechanism still obstructed,
Creation’s nurturing difficult to enact,
He manifested a transformed body for this purpose.
In one day and one night, seventy-two transformations,
Assuming all kinds of forms, each resembling its kind.
Finally, his wondrous form perfected,
His body in perfect balance,
Head touching heaven, feet treading earth—
Thus was he named "human."
Attaining the rightness of principle,
The clarity of qi,
The subtlety of essence,
The numinosity of spirit,
He stood as one of the Three Powers,
The tripartite division of heaven, earth, and humanity.
Thus, all kinds—those born of heaven, earth, humans, and beings—
None were not modeled after him,
None lacked his numinosity.
Without this Most Perfect One, what cause would there be?

This Most Perfect One, upholding the teaching of Wuxiang,
Dwells in the Jade Clarity,
In the realm of the utterly ineffable,
Beyond thought or conception.
The realm of Qingwei presides over all—
The way of heaven, the way of earth,
The way of humanity, the way of demons,
The watery abyss, the hidden depths,
The six paths of rebirth,
The reckoning of kalpas,
The revolving of Qian and Kun,
The governance of heaven and humanity,
Immortals, Buddhas, Perfected Lords,
Demotion and promotion, transcendence and realization,
Karmic causes and effects,
The constellations Yushitige and Dahuoluo,
Acting without intention, transforming without effort.
From non-being without intention,
Thus non-action without action;
From non-action without action,
Thus formlessness without form.
No sound, no scent,
Without peer or equal,
No non-being, no dharma,
No non-name,
No attachment, no obstruction,
No non-emotion.
Through the inconceivable,
To the utmost non-being, the non-spirit.
From non-spirit,
Thus nothing is not illuminated,
Nothing is not encompassed,
Nothing is not enacted.
Transforming without fail,
Nurturing in perfect balance.

This is Yuanshi,
Dwelling in the Jade Clarity,
Serene and silent, governing past and present,
In pure emptiness and tranquil stillness,
Vastly absent, vastly present.
Nothing does he not embody,
No breath does he not generate.
Master of the sacred essentials,
All return to the Beginning of Azure.

His birth is in wood,
His completion in metal,
Endowed with the image of Li fire and Kan water’s obscurity,
Returning to the ultimate Wu earth,
With central harmony as sovereign.
Issuing the great divine incantation,
Harmonizing the six yin,
Yin still yet moving,
Yang at its extreme unfolds.
One yin, one yang,
The Five Phases gather their essence,
Wondrously uniting opening and closing,
Emptiness and space containing and congealing.

The five directions correspond to the Five Phases,
Each with its emperor,
Each residing in its heart,
Each overseeing its office,
Each wielding its spirit,
Each receiving sacred commands,
Each achieving its accomplishments.
All these imperial attendants,
Each has its charge,
To proclaim the primordial revolution,
To spread the August Benevolence.

Yet this Yuanshi,
With boundless bodies,
Crosses boundless kalpas,
Preserving and securing the primordial qi.
Submitting to the reckoning of fate,
Without intention, without insistence,
Wondrously attaining spontaneity.

This Yuanshi,
Dwelling in the Jade Clarity,
Wields boundless bodies,
Exhibits vast spiritual powers,
Dividing his form to respond and transform,
Each with its spirit,
Entering the human body,
Each residing in a single crown,
Each a Yuanshi,
Dwelling within,
As the master of the body,
As the ancestor of the ten thousand qi.

This human body,
Each receiving its portion—
The transformed bodies of Yuanshi,
Each displaying spiritual powers,
Utterly beyond the inconceivable,
Unassailed, unendangered,
Without birth, without extinction,
Without motion, without stillness,
The divine abode serene,
Pervading all without exception.
Thus, though kalpas turn,
Succeeding one another in endless succession,
This sacred governor remains undestroyed.
Each, according to its portion,
Divides and transforms its body,
Returning to Jade Clarity,
Reuniting with Yuanshi,
Neither increased nor diminished,
Restoring its wondrous form.

Thus know that Yuanshi
Governs the One Origin.
The One Origin divides and transforms,
Extending to the ten thousand images.
The ten thousand images, vast and manifold,
All return to the One Origin.
The One Origin transforms,
Without beginning or end,
Beyond thought or contemplation.
In utmost stillness, it moves—
Movement is thusness;
In utmost motion, it is still—
Stillness is thusness.
One motion, one stillness,
One stillness, one motion,
All movements and stillnesses,
Whether dividing or uniting,
Whether returning or departing,
Each possesses the form of Yuanshi.
Each by its form,
Each completes its wondrous body.
Each by its form,
Requires no gathering or withdrawal,
Each returns to its origin,
Reuniting as one,
While the form of Yuanshi,
Revered, dwells in Jade Clarity.

O subtle! O subtle!
This Jade Clarity,
A sacred realm of majestic adornment,
Within the Great Luo Heaven,
Utterly supreme,
Beyond all comparison,
Beyond all naming,
Utterly empty, utterly sacred,
At the summit’s peak—
Only those of adamantine,
Pure and wondrous bodies,
Utterly unsurpassable,
Through merit and ascetic practice,
Become the honored among the Heavenly Worthies,
The most revered perfected ones.
Gazing in hope, they strain to see,
Yet faint and indistinct, beyond reach,
Never to attain—
For none attain it,
Thus its sacred realm
Is subtle and unfathomable.

Yet through the turning of kalpas,
Cyclic and ceaseless,
All receive its endowment.
Thus the Five Elders,
Together with the sacred governors,
Ascend to Jade Clarity,
To receive its essential teachings.
There they behold Yuanshi,
Seated in Jade Clarity,
Upon a dharma throne of majestic adornment,
Rare even among the heavens.
None in all the dharma realms
Can equal it—
Vast, empty, and boundless,
Serene, tranquil, and free,
Seldom seen by any.
Suddenly, the heavens
Shine with five radiant hues,
And a mighty wind arises,
Turning like a wheel,
Circulating beyond the void.
This Jade Clarity
Transforms into countless millions,
Beyond measure.
These millions of heavens,
Each manifesting transformations,
A single Yuanshi,
Emitting wondrous sounds.
As one wondrous sound,
It pervades above and below.
The Heavenly Emperor and perfected ones
Expound the wondrous causes,
Dissolving calamities and assemblies,
Lifting beings,
Some escaping suffering,
Reaching the sacred capital,
To discourse on causes and conditions.

For these causes and conditions
Originate from the vast kalpas,
For the lords of the heavens.
Such subtlety
Cannot be conveyed in words—
Only in the practitioner,
Each according to their attainment,
Can the depths of Yuanshi be analyzed.
Profound is this realm,
All-encompassing, all-pervading,
With nothing beyond.
All heavenly beings,
Desiring to witness this excellence,
Must cease all thought,
Sit upright in stillness,
Cross-legged, concentrating the spirit,
Emptying all existence,
As if this body were not,
As if this mind were not,
Vast and boundless,
Like the edge of empty space.
Spirit at ease, qi at rest,
Cessation of activity in secrecy—
Then the wondrous realm
Opens from stillness.
All the sublime vistas of Jade Clarity,
Arrayed like stars in a go board,
Manifest in perfect clarity.

And this Yuanshi,
In its responsive transformations,
Sits in solemn stillness upon the dharma throne,
Manifesting all dharma images,
To commune with our spirit.
For this Yuanshi
Is the principle that gathers all,
The root to which the ten thousand qi return,
Utterly true, without delusion.
Only the undeluded
May perceive its spirit.

O subtle! O subtle!
Neither empty nor real,
As if present, as if absent,
Without ears, mouth, or nose,
Without sound, color, or taste,
Without thought, perception, or consciousness—
Only by attaining its subtlety
May one behold it.
Since the sacred teaching ceased,
None remain to speak of it.
Now I point the way
To the wondrous Dao of Jade Clarity.
Those who cultivate the Dao,
Must embody its profound source,
Cast aside all thought and deliberation,
Silently and sacredly awaken,
The heart not clinging to things,
With no-mind and no-intention,
Unravel the secret causes,
Merge in wondrous union.
At the midnight and noon hours,
Regulate the breath and qi,
All spirits subdued,
Inner and outer in primordial simplicity,
Gather all dharma images,
Returning them to nothingness,
Entering the pearl of the millet grain,
Observe all heavens and earth,
Manifesting all dharmas—
Sun, moon, and stars,
Mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams,
The ten thousand kinds, the countless species,
The great thousandfold world,
All forms and sounds,
Colors, appearances, and substances,
All are fully present.
Externally, appearances are pure and fine,
Each observer attains it according to their intent.
Exiting the utmost bounds,
Standing at the root of heaven,
Beholding all heavens and earth
As a single grain of millet—
All these forms and appearances,
Each manifest within the mote of dust,
Within the instant of a thought,
All are present,
Yet truly, none are present.
This sacred subtlety—
How could it be conceived?

Profound! O profound!
Who has fathomed its limit?
I have heard that Yuanshi,
In expounding this wondrousness,
Extends to non-action.
Observing emptiness as not-empty,
Emptiness is empty of emptiness;
Seeing existence as not-existence,
Existence is existence of all.
Only emptiness is not empty,
Yet truly empty;
Only existence is not existence,
Yet truly existent.
Is it existence? Is it emptiness?
Emptiness? Existence?
Existence within emptiness—
Existence does not make it existent;
Emptiness within existence—
Emptiness does not make it empty.
Emptying what is existent,
Existing what is empty—
This is true sacredness,
Sacredness beyond sacredness.
Dwelling within the heavens,
It is the root of heaven and earth;
Dwelling within humans,
It is the ancestor of the human body.

Those who cultivate nature and life,
Cultivators of the Dao,
Must cultivate this ancestral root.
When the ancestral root is complete,
The ten thousand qi congeal,
Qi returns to life,
Life governs nature,
Nature is qi, life is Dao,
Sacredness is truth, ancestor is root—
This is Yuanshi,
The wondrous Dao of Jade Clarity.

This wondrous Dao was transmitted by Yuanshi,
Yuanshi passed it down,
Returning to the essential mystery of sacredness.
This mechanism of sacredness,
Concealed within Jade Clarity,
In the Qingwei Palace,
Enclosed in a purple rosy brocade pouch—
Only true perfected ones,
Of profound capacity and weighty destiny,
With pure roots of the Dao,
May be permitted to hear it.

Thus, the Perfected One,
Whose Dharma-name is Lingbao,
Took pity on this lower realm,
Where beings had not yet heard this supreme sacred and wondrous Dao,
Passing through kalpas and lifetimes,
With no means of liberation or deliverance,
Until the very end,
Turning and revolving in the wheel of rebirth.
Thereupon, manifesting his Dharma-body,
In the Fragrant Grove Garden,
He expounded the sacred scriptures,
The golden precepts and jade statutes,
Transforming and harmonizing heaven and earth,
Delivering and elevating gods and humans,
Benefiting and rescuing all beings,
Saving and aiding lost souls.
These wondrous Dharma teachings,
Widely spread throughout Jambudvīpa,
Flowed into the impure realm.
Those who cultivate in accordance with this Dharma,
Transcend and realize the wondrous fruit;
Those who reverently follow the precepts,
Universally pervade the six destinies.

Yet these Dharma scriptures,
Are of the most refined and strict golden standard.
Cultivators who are not of pure body,
Not of pure mind,
Not of pure conduct,
Cannot fathom their sacred subtleties.
For this wondrous Dharma,
Transforms without end,
Even as numerous as the sands of the Ganges,
Cannot compare to it.

Above, it reaches the heavens,
Extending to the heavens beyond heavens,
To the Heaven of No Limit,
The Heaven of Sacredness,
Where there is no form,
And nothing can contain it—
Yet there is nothing that is not this Dharma.
Wherever it circulates,
Below, it reaches the earth,
Extending to the Fusang,
To the Valley of Yu,
And to places the earth does not bear—
There is nothing that is not this Dharma.
Flowing and circulating,
When released, it pervades the six directions;
When gathered, it retreats into secrecy.
Clouds may seem to exist, yet are not truly existent;
Emptiness may seem not to exist, yet is not truly non-existent.
Forms take shape as images,
Emptiness remains as emptiness—
Beyond thought and discussion.

What words can describe it?
It originates in the heart,
Responds without obstruction,
Appears without trace,
Departs without limit.
Seen, it cannot be seen;
Heard, it makes no sound.
Creation arises from me,
Heaven and earth serve as causes.
Causes and responses are unfathomable,
Calculations and numbers cannot be sought.

Subtle and wondrous!
Without past, without present,
Without equal, without peer,
Pure, empty, sacred, and mysterious—
No means by which to clarify.
Only this Perfected One,
With the supreme sacred Dao,
Expounded the supreme sacred Dharma,
Disseminating it throughout the universe.
Even the most foolish of men,
Upon hearing the sacred formulas,
All may practice accordingly,
With none who do not respond,
None who are not efficacious,
None who do not attain their wishes,
None who do not follow their hearts.

Thus, it is known that the wondrous Dharma
Is revered by all,
Submitted to by all,
Upheld by all.
Tracing its origin,
It arises from the utmost truth,
True and without falsehood.
All Dharmas return to the body;
With the body, one embodies the Dharma,
With the Dharma, one protects life.
Life perpetuates without end,
Each Dharma becomes spiritually efficacious.
The numinous transforms,
Extending to the causeless.
In Jambudvīpa,
He is the Dharma Master,
Revered by ghosts and gods,
Honored by gods and humans.
His teachings resound,
Commanding thunder and lightning,
Summoning wind and rain,
Rescuing all beings,
Driving away evil and binding demons,
Clearing the cosmos,
Rectifying human relationships,
Flourishing virtue and Dao.
Entering from non-being, exiting into being,
Each Dharma transmits in succession.
The supreme Dao is complete,
Virtue and conduct are profoundly lofty,
Meritorious deeds widely spread,
The spirit returns to Shangqing.

As for cultivators,
Who painstakingly delve into the sacred mysteries,
Nurturing qi and refining form—
There are demon kings,
Leading their retinues,
Who come to invade and disturb.
Yet by relying on this Dharma,
They subdue and reclaim evil spirits,
So that none dare insult,
And they penetrate the sacred darkness,
Without fear,
Without obstruction,
Without hindrance.
Thus, they can wholeheartedly
Refine qi and smelt the spirit.

Therefore, it is known that this Dharma
Protects all Dao practices,
None can exist outside it.

Yet this wondrous Dharma
Is that of the Lingbao Venerable,
Who in the Shangqing realm,
Personally received it from Yuanshi.
The sacred principles it contains
Are not easily obtained.
The Lingbao Venerable dwells
In the Shangqing realm,
Within the Yuyu Palace,
Holding in hand the sonorous sphere of the Great Ultimate,
Dividing yin and yang,
Transforming the odd into the even,
The even into the three,
The three into the ten thousand,
To the hundred million,
To the countless,
And from the countless,
Returning to a single odd,
Reverting to the Great Ultimate,
Without deficiency,
Without omission,
Without excess or remainder.
For this reason,
Gazing into the sacred subtleties,
He knows this supreme Dao,
Each dwelling within wondrous Dharmas.
What he sees,
Becomes this Dharma.
Thus, it is known that this Dharma
Is the marrow of the Dao.
To those who do not embody the Dao,
This Dharma is not transmitted.

Subtle and wondrous!
I once had the fortune to behold
The sacred realm of Yuyu,
Residing at the heart of heaven.
Its colors radiant,
Its forms luminous,
Its shape vast and empty,
Its body pure and clear.
Nothing it does not contain,
No principle it does not hold.
In profusion and confusion,
Myriad forms stand in abundance.
Still, there is nothing;
Yet nothing is not present.
Moving, nothing is not formed;
Yet truly, nothing is formed.
The thousand truths, the ten thousand lords,
Sages, immortals, and numinous beings,
Buddhas and bodhisattvas—
All are present therein.
Below, even the ordinary man,
The foolish and the unworthy,
Each possesses a Lingbao,
Supremely wondrous and sacred,
Limitlessly transformative,
A Dharma of utmost numinosity.
Yet, fallen into the later heaven,
They generate all manner of obstructions,
Obscuring the numinous terrace,
So that all
Wondrous Dharma transformations
Cannot be perceived.
Over time, they sink and become lost,
Increasingly losing their original truth.
Once the original truth is lost,
All Dharmas are submerged and ruined.

Alas! How lamentable!
One loss is total loss,
With nothing remaining.
Falling into the pit of fire,
Flowing and turning without end,
With the dull and the moving alike—
How can this not be tragic?

This Shangqing,
Possesses a realm of spiritual penetration,
Its scenery luminous and solemn.
All its adornments
Are resplendent and beautiful.
And the Yuyu Palace,
With its dignified and majestic forms,
Above hangs a floral canopy,
Encircled by five-colored clouds on all sides,
Radiating five-colored light,
Illuminating all the great thousand worlds,
All becoming five-colored.
Auspicious light shines brilliantly,
With nothing hidden.

Within it arises again
a subtle, wondrous fragrance,
transforming into misty vapors—
an atmosphere of harmony and radiance—
that spreads throughout the heavens and the earth,
pervading all places.
All heavenly beings and humans
feast upon this ethereal qi,
each fully sated,
none growing weary.

By this sublime spectacle,
the hosts of heaven and humanity
gather beneath it.
Suddenly, the sacred realm of Shangqing unfolds,
revealing towers and pavilions,
flowers of jade and pearls,
trees of jasper with branches of coral,
celestial birds and rare beasts,
each bearing a singular name,
beyond all description.

Again appear halls and pavilions,
terraces and towers,
shimmering in gold and azure,
resplendent with rosy clouds,
where all true sages,
ethereal lords, and lofty adepts,
adorned in star-crowned headdresses and sword-girded sandals,
circlets and jade pendants,
come and go,
each displaying their wondrous forms.

There are also the jade maidens of the heavens,
their hair bound in rosy clouds,
adorned in rainbow-hued robes and jasper ornaments,
each bearing a single mani jewel,
encircling the Way before them.
Suddenly appears the image of the Heavenly Worthy,
a divine figure of fierce and wondrous form,
each wielding sharp blades,
bows and arrows, spears and halberds,
manifesting three heads and eyes,
each capable of speech and sight,
transforming six arms,
each holding something different,
standing in a ring to guard and protect,
their transformations boundless.

All heavenly beings and humans,
gazing from afar,
cannot draw near,
lost in praise and wonder,
none differing in their awe.

This wondrous realm,
rarely glimpsed or heard of,
few can ever reach.
Most subtle and marvelous,
nearly beyond all description—
who would know that within it
lies yet deeper mystery?
To fathom its depths
is truly unfathomable.
The Great Ultimate embraces all,
all phenomena complete within it.

A single grain of millet
holds all worlds;
a single mustard seed
contains Mount Sumeru.

Within a single hair’s tip,
myriad Brahma-kingdoms stand;
within a single mote of dust,
all dharma-images appear.
From one aperture’s sound,
a hundred million voices arise;
from one pore’s qi,
a thousand myriad forms transform.

In an instant, sun and moon
wheel at will;
in an instant, wind and thunder
rage and roar unchecked.
Turning being into non-being,
tracing non-being back to being,
neither real nor illusory,
creation knows no fixed method.

These numinous treasures
emit the Great Wondrous Sound,
for all true lords,
opening the Daoist canon,
proclaiming boundless subtle dharmas,
transmitting the pure, non-dual rite.
Golden talismans and jade scripts,
precepts stern and strict,
secret transmissions,
the supreme mind-seal.
Golden writs and jade essence,
cinnabar and yellow wondrous hues,
the Limitless Profound Text,
passed on to gods and humans,
disseminated through the dusty world.
Following the precepts in cultivation and reverence—

Then the Heavenly Worthy,
in compassion, saves across kalpas.
Each, with what they have received—
the mind-seal of the Numinous Treasure,
the true transmission of the wondrous dharma,
the golden precepts and jade statutes—
descends to deliver the human realm,
encountering perfected beings,
of lofty virtue and power,
worthy of receiving it.

Thereupon, a jade altar is set,
with personal instruction given,
widely bestowed upon distant descendants,
flowing through later generations.
None dare disobey.
Moved by this compassionate heart,
each undertakes ascetic practice,
to propagate without end,
through thousands of myriad kalpas,
fortifying heaven and earth,
harmonizing yin and yang,
regulating primordial qi,
nurturing all beings,
benefiting both the hidden and the manifest,
transcending to attain immortality,
stabilizing the Five Peaks,
governing the Five Directions,
transforming even grasses and trees,
none differing in this.

This wondrous dharma—
when the Son of Heaven obtains it,
he establishes great peace and governance;
when the feudal lords obtain it,
they establish the foundation of harmonious rule.

When scholars and commoners obtain it, their persons become upright;
when birds and beasts obtain it, their natures become numinous;
when insects obtain it, they preserve their lives;
when grasses and trees obtain it, they fulfill their growth;
when mountains and rivers obtain it, they gather wondrous essence;
when lakes and seas obtain it, they store their spirit.
Those who cultivate the Dao, obtaining this supreme essential,
rightly assume their place among the Celestial Perfected.
Confucians who obtain it flourish in civil brilliance;
Buddhists who obtain it perceive the true nature of existence.
Even the insentient—soundless and formless—
obtaining this wondrous dharma, each awakens to its original cause.
The hidden and the manifest, the sinful multitudes who obtain it,
forever escape the wheel of rebirth.

Thus it is known: this wondrous dharma
is beyond thought, beyond imagination,
beyond speech, beyond indication.
Through me one observes things,
through things one observes principle,
through principle one observes number,
through number one observes heaven,
through heaven one observes the Dao,
through the Dao one observes dharma.
By dharma forms arise,
by forms shapes take form,
by shapes substance is constituted,
by substance names are given,
by names things come to be,
by things humanity arises,
by humanity teachings emerge.

Herein lies the Supreme Venerable One,
who established the Lingbao dharma,
setting forth a model for later generations.
Thus it is known: the wondrous dharma of the Shangqing true realm
unfolds the teaching of Dao and virtue,
boundless and infinite—
how subtle! How subtle!

This Supreme Venerable One
originated with the Primordial Beginning,
was transmitted through the Lingbao,
descended into the dusty world,
manifesting numinous marvels.
At the sacred birth,
in an instant all became radiantly clear—
every arcane word and script,
without need of master or guide,
each embodied its essential,
each grasped its subtlety.
Before the kalpas of vast eons,
all causes and conditions were each distinctly understood;
after the kalpas of vast eons,
all Daoist methods were each thoroughly penetrated.
Above, it reaches to heaven—
all that heaven bears,
every subtle mystery,
was each fully comprehended.
Below, it extends to earth,
even to the hidden and obscure—
every secret was each made plain.
In the midst, it governs human affairs—
human relationships and virtue,
rites and music, state governance,
measures and literature,
profound principles and subtle truths,
the essentials of the supreme Dao,
all great principles,
every fine detail in sequence,
were each mastered,
mind to mind in perfect resonance.

Then the Most Sagely One of Ni Mountain
deeply praised it as rare in past and present,
peerless in excellence—
a marvelous essence, a singular talent.
The Emperor observed its subtleties,
possessing great spiritual power,
boundless dharmic might.
Moved by compassion for all beings,
who seldom hear the great Dao,
like the deaf and blind,
with hearts obscured and wills benighted,
he expounded the numinous scripture,
the five thousand words in full,
propagating Dao and virtue,
purity and non-action,
the supreme essential truth.
Profound principles flourished,
teachings were fully established,
no precept left unaddressed.

Thereupon, a perfected one
was born in that era,
concealing himself among minor officials,
serving as the Keeper of the Pass,
his dharma-name Xi.
From birth he was numinous and extraordinary,
his wisdom surpassing all.
In a single breath,
a thousand truths became clear.
He mastered all scriptures,
delved deeply into their mysteries—
yet alas, no transmission occurred,
a single gap remained unbridged.

Then the Supreme Venerable One
radiated a great millennial light,
illuminating that place,
giving rise to this extraordinary man,
truly a vessel of the Dao,
worthy to receive this teaching.
Thereupon, he rode a green ox,
westward across the Han Pass.
At that time, the perfected one
sat in silent contemplation,
aware that a true one
was approaching from the east.
He arose, his long-held reverence stirring,
knelt by the roadside,
begging for the secret transmission.

The Supreme Venerable One,
knowing him to be the rightful recipient,
thereupon composed the *Dao De Zhen Jing* and bestowed it upon him.
At these words, the perfected one
suddenly awakened,
fully enlightened.
He obtained the untransmitted wondrous treasure of heaven and earth,
eternally bequeathing the supreme teaching,
spreading it without bound.
Thereupon, he composed the *Wenshi Zhen Jing* in nine chapters,
elucidating Dao and virtue.

The Supreme Venerable One,
having ensured the transmission of this wondrous Dao
and the establishment of the eternal teaching,
thereafter returned in a single breath
to the Great Clarity,
within the Great Crimson Palace,
becoming the ancestral master of the Dao.

This celestial palace,
within the realm of the Great Clarity,
serves as the gateway to the subtlest mysteries
for all heavens and earths.
Every Heavenly Worthy,
Indra and true lords,
sages, immortals, and Daoist adepts,
Buddhas and bodhisattva ancestors—
all receive confirmation of its mysteries from this heaven,
hearing this secret,
thereby entering the ranks of the Great Luo immortals.

This celestial palace
is the key to all mysteries.
Every sentient being,
every non-actional and supremely sagely one,
every divine perfected one—
if they wish to behold the wondrous forms of the Lingbao,
or aspire to ascend further,
gazing upon the sacred and majestic realm of the Jade Clarity,
must pass through this heaven,
traversing its subtle wonders,
perhaps then meriting a glimpse.

This Great Clarity
is the capital of immortals.
Among all its realms,
every sublime landscape,
light and scenery shift and vary—
rare blossoms and exotic flowers,
fragrant and resplendent,
dazzling the eyes,
seldom seen before.
There are mountains and hills, streams and valleys,
strange rocks and wondrous trees,
sacred cliffs and precipitous ravines,
housing rare birds and extraordinary beasts—
tigers striped and leopards patterned,
black qilin and white cranes,
azure birds and vermilion phoenixes—
each distinct in kind,
manifesting numinous marvels,
each presenting a unique spectacle.
Again, there appear cloud terraces and square patterns,
carved pavilions and ornate pillars,
crimson railings and painted balustrades,
streets of white jade,
paved with yellow gold,
five-colored precious stones
scattered across the ground.

Within, there are supreme true lords,
Heavenly Worthies and great sages,
feathered transcendents and yellow-crowned adepts,
golden lads and jade maidens,
each adorned in robes of five-colored clouds and mist,
strolling leisurely,
coming and going in carefree ease,
naturally joyful.
Further within are the cloud generals of the various heavens,
some riding dragons,
some driving red tigers,
each wielding precious weapons,
encircling and guarding the heavens.

At that time, the Supreme Venerable One
sat in silent contemplation,
offering no instruction.
Then the Five Emperors
knelt before him,
begging for dharma and teaching,
bowing in reverence,
daring not rise hastily.
The Supreme Venerable One’s compassionate countenance
suddenly brightened,
and he expounded the subtleties to the Five Elders,
sighing as he spoke:
“My supreme teaching
has long been set forth in a single scripture,
called the *Daode*,
bestowed upon Yin Xi,
transmitted through the world.
Those who uphold and practice it
ascend to the immortal Dao.”

At that time, the Five Emperors each addressed the Dao before him: “This *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Perfect and Tranquil*, is profound and far-reaching. Those of lesser capacity who cultivate the Dao rarely glimpse its mysteries. We humbly beseech your sagely compassion to reveal its essential subtleties.”

Thereupon, the Supreme Venerable One spoke to the Five Emperors: “This most true and wondrous subtlety of the Dao cannot be transmitted by speech; its essence must be grasped through the heart’s contemplation. If one seeks it merely in words, people will regard it superficially. Without proper transmission from a teacher, they will recklessly conjecture, often straying into side paths. Thus, I first speak of tranquility and non-action, gathering and withdrawing all that is stirred by the dust of delusion. Only then do I reveal the faintest traces of the Dao’s subtleties, guiding them toward gradual awakening and silent comprehension of the true mystery.

Now, as you repeatedly seek its essentials, I shall speak of it. Listen quietly, my children.

This Great Clarity dwells at the center of heaven, serving as its pivot, called the *Mysterious Pass*. From this heaven, heaven and earth are born, humans and all things arise. It existed before earth, and only with this heaven did qi begin to flow. In the beginning, when there were no forms, within this formless state, a single wondrous principle fermented primordial qi, thereby securing eternal preservation. Before and after heaven and earth, all heavens and earths, mountains and rivers, and living beings—without this heaven’s revolving transformations, the mechanism of qi would cease.

Thus, all immortals, buddhas, sages, and true lords, unless they penetrate this heaven, cannot perceive the sacred realm of Jade Clarity. This is what cultivators who have fulfilled the Dao and its virtue must urgently study.

In the past, while in the world, I observed heaven through myself and saw that my body, too, arose from the realm of the Great Clarity’s Mysterious Pass. This pass governs all qi, both prior to and following heaven and earth, dividing the boundaries of yin and yang, establishing the gates of water and fire. That which is not above must communicate with what is below; that which is not below must communicate with what is above. Only through this pass do above and below interconnect. Left unites with right, right with left—only through this pass. Then, returning to oneness, drawing yin to merge with yang, one must cross this pass; drawing yang to aid yin, one must cross this pass. All true waters cross the pass to aid fire; all true fires cross the pass to aid water. Water and fire, though distinct, emerge from a single source; yin and yang unite to return to the Supreme Ultimate. The ultimate divides into two, the two merge into one—all converge at this pass, with none surpassing it.

Yet this Mysterious Pass resides within the navel, neither above nor below, neither left nor right, neither front nor back, neither shallow nor deep. Gazing upon the interplay of the two qi, silently uniting spirit and essence, one begins from below and ultimately ascends above. It is neither empty nor solid, neither form nor sound. Form and sound both dissolve, its image and state defy description.

All cultivators should sit cross-legged, still their breath, calm their myriad thoughts, and subdue their primordial spirit. Internally, nothing disturbs; externally, no dust entangles. Let all—sentient and insentient, demonic obstacles that arise—be met with indifference. Even if words arise within, remain unmoved. Cast aside all distinctions, neither seeing nor hearing. In such tranquility, free from all conditions, one may silently move the essence of true primordiality. From the sea of qi, it ascends to the Great Clarity, and from the realm of the Great Clarity, it circulates throughout the body, all dharma realms, reaching the Upper Clarity within the Palace of Yu Yu. Passing through the mechanism of qi, it arrives at the Office of Inhalation and Exhalation, ascending to meet Jade Clarity, then descends again to the Great Clarity, within the Palace of Great Redness. There, it merges with all the Three Treasures and dharma objects, coalescing into a single realm, the Supreme Ultimate of primordial wonder. The foundation is laid in emptiness, embracing all retinues without omission.

Only then may one gather and withdraw the primordial spirit, dwelling within it. Each family’s retinue encircles and surrounds, like sitting within an iron citadel, entering a secluded chamber, ascending the highest peak, or plunging into a vast abyss—none can perceive it. These are the heavenly palaces. Further, radiant scenes appear for their delight, offering wondrous drinks of jade nectar and ambrosia for their nourishment. Auspicious light swirls on all sides, illuminating everything. In the realm of non-action, all true lords guide and escort, with fragrant flowers filling the path and all offerings in abundance. Thus, one ascends to the ranks of the Great Luo immortals.

This is the utmost essential, the ultimate subtlety, not easily attained. You, the Five Elders, must each protect those who cultivate, that they may attain the wondrous fruit of the true path.”

I once heard this most subtle and essential Dao, and understood that this body, this mind, this principle all originate from the Three Pure Ones. Thus, with the body one initially attains, one still follows the Great Purity to reach the Jade Purity realm. In this way, this body becomes no different from Heaven, and the wondrous Dao of the Three Pure Ones is drawn from within oneself, each fully possessed, with nothing lacking.

Yet this wondrous Dao was transmitted by the Most High, most refined and subtle, most profound and mysterious. Though widely proclaimed, beginners who lack a teacher’s guidance cannot apply themselves to it. Now, in this world, I broadly bestow the Dharma-milk, open the gate of expedient means, and reveal swift methods, expounding good causes for the Three Teachings, that later learners may practice according to the method. Though they may not fully grasp the subtleties of the utmost Dao, if they diligently practice, they may still attain something. Disciples, you must eliminate differences and the views of self and others, observe carefully, listen attentively, and generate no obstacles, that you may together realize this cause.

For within a person’s body, only essence, qi, and spirit are fundamental. Secure essence, nurture qi, and the mind and spirit will be at peace, preserving their subtle governance without loss or collapse. Yet the essential practice begins with purifying the six roots. Once the six thieves are subdued, the seven emotions have no cause. Without emotions or consciousness, there is no suffering; without suffering, there are no emotional thoughts; without emotional thoughts, there are no deluded minds. Only then does this mind become pure and non-active, like the great void—nothing is not present, yet it seems as if nothing exists. Because there is no "nothing," there is no obstruction; without obstruction, there is nothing not numinous. Only when numinous does it become spirit; only when spirit does it become penetrating. Penetrating without limit, one thus comprehends the profound and mysterious.

I instruct cultivators: first, one must master stillness. To attain stillness, one must be sincere; to be sincere, one must be reverent; to be reverent, one must be cautious. Be cautious of idle speech, idle movement, idle thoughts, and idle causes. When there are no idle causes, even amid chaos and clamor, there is no delusion. Without delusion, one is inwardly serene, focused on the One without distraction, thus preserving sincerity. By preserving sincerity, one returns to stillness; at the extreme of stillness, clarity naturally arises. Through clarity, one can act:

Confucians cultivate conduct, fulfilling all ethical norms without shame, thus entering virtue and aspiring to sagehood and Heaven.

Buddhists, through practice, contemplate emptiness and attain emptiness—not a dull emptiness—but seek the Buddha within the mind, using the mind to seal the Buddha. Mind is Buddha; Buddha is mind. Thus, they realize the Tathāgata, just so, just so.

Daoist adepts cultivate their conduct, first guiding their spirit to govern primordial qi, then using qi to gather essence. When essence is sufficient, all qi is sufficient; when qi is sufficient, all spirit is sufficient. When spirit suffices for qi, qi suffices for essence, and essence suffices for spirit, thus fully possessed, the Great Elixir is accomplished.

These Three Teachings, though distinct in approach, ultimately derive from the One Ultimate. Tracing their origins, they all return to the same source, not only beginning and ending in the Supreme Ultimate, but also in their practice: from knowledge to action, from reverence to sincerity, from sincerity to stillness, from stillness to clarity, from clarity to spirit. In this sequence, there is no division.

Yet Confucians often engage in the investigation of things, their teaching being substantive. Buddhists focus on still contemplation, illuminating the nature but not cultivating the life-force—thus their teaching is empty. Daoists, however, cultivate both nature and life, first securing the root, then exploring the profound essentials. They are not empty in their emptiness, nor merely substantive in their substance. Thus, their teaching unites Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, with nothing external to it. How supreme is the Dao! It stands from the beginningless, generates Heaven and Earth, humans and beings, governs the transformations of past and present, pervades the cosmos, enters the hidden and emerges in the manifest, delivers and elevates all beings. Whether Confucian or Buddhist, whether sage or worthy, whether Buddha or bodhisattva, all arise from this Dao, which is both two and one.

Even kings, dukes, generals, ministers, and rulers—if they cultivate this wondrous Dao, their fortune and prosperity flourish, governing the state and pacifying the people. If a sagely Son of Heaven cultivates this wondrous Dao, his reign endures long, extending boundlessly. How wondrous is this Dao! It propels the turning of kalpas, stabilizes the Earth, shifts the seasons, raises and lowers the two images, operates yin and yang, embodies the Supreme Ultimate, secures the Heavenly Root. It cannot be seen or heard, yet responds to changes and transformations—spiritlike in its spirit.

Cultivators who master the profound and subtle refine essence, qi, and spirit, establish their life’s origin, secure their original truth, and gradually awaken to their original nature, personally witnessing the natural. Then, accumulating three thousand eight hundred great and vast practices, they realize the Golden Immortal. Proceeding from the Great Purity, in purity and non-action, they receive the Dharma and sacred treasures, expounding the Jade Purity’s Primordial Beginning’s True One’s utmost Dao. Accumulating all manner of merits, performing all manner of practices, vowing to exhaust kalpas, establishing boundless and unequaled virtues—only when such meritorious deeds are complete do they personally receive the Jade Emperor’s decree, becoming a Great Luo Heaven’s supreme, non-active, utmost true subtle governor, titled Heavenly Venerable, coeval with Heaven and Earth.

How subtle and wondrous! Disciples, listen carefully to this decree, each clearly understanding the most subtle and profound Dao, its wondrous causes and conditions. Practice according to the method, generate great wisdom, without duality or doubt. Then, the ten directions’ utmost true supreme governors will silently protect you, all demon kings will bow their heads, and in the world, you will enjoy long life, or receive honor and emolument, attaining the highest ministerial rank, or dwell in famous mountains, carefree and joyful, with heavenly nobility and honor unmatched.

To expound this sutra for eternal transmission to later ages!

How supreme is the wondrous Dao! Its Dharma knows no equal, no peer. All beings, sentient and insentient, receive the blessings of this sutra.

*Eulogy by the Vast Transformation Perfected Lord:*
The treasure mirror’s Dharma aligns with the Void’s subtlety, never-before-attained;
The Primordial Sovereign’s transformations open the dark expanse.
Spiritual responses from the Nine Heavens unfurl the crimson dawn;
Myriad Dharmas return to their source, restoring the One Origin.
The profound mysteries of Dao and virtue transmit the symbolic teachings;
In the turbid, chaotic realm, the celestial heart is revealed.
The Supreme Clarity and Penglai’s marvels await vision’s grasp;
The vibrant, surging *pippala* turns the Dharma Wheel.
The subtle dawn ascends, vast and boundless;
Cloud-script congeals in emptiness, revealing the first azure.
Jade talismans are bestowed, swallowing the vast kalpas;
Transformations endless, the Jade Capital’s radiance shifts.
Orchid groves exhale fragrance as hills and valleys transform;
Bird-script seals the jade balance’s constancy.
Roots coil, binding the celestial root firmly;
Thirty-six palaces brim with spring’s essence.
True masters disclose the most subtle mysteries;
A single word’s causal link attains the supreme vehicle.

*Postscript to the Three Grades of True Sutra by Master Liu:*
I have often said:
The warp of Heaven, the weft of Earth—
together they weave resplendent, luminous scripture.

Within the ocean’s treasury lie river-sands—
they unfold the subtlest meanings of the *xuan*-mysteries.
Long has the Jade Bureau flung wide its gates;
between Heaven and Earth, *yinyun* qi suffuses all.
Behold! The Cowrie Scriptures are broadly translated,
the Three Vehicles’ words reach the utmost in raft and ferry.
From ancient times to now, the mind-seals of sages and worthies,
the lamp-transmissions of immortals and buddhas,
have been inscribed on metal and stone,
circulated on silk and bamboo.
Though they swell to five thousand forty-eight in number,
how could they ever exhaust the purport of the scriptures’ return?

Thus the immortal canons’ *xuan*-models,
radiant in the cosmos,
shine bright as sun and stars,
their luminous glory bathing above and below—
how could they be measured by candlelight or counted?
What need, then, to speak of grades?

Our Master, the Teacher of Emperors, Vouchsafing Blessing,
vowed the boundless vow to ferry all beings.
Manifesting a body, he expounded the Dharma,
universally saving the deluded multitudes.
With a heart of *prajñā*, he adapted to the times,
moved by the plight of the benighted below:
the common and foolish, daily more submerged,
daily deeper in perdition.
To this was added the raging torrent of heterodox ways,
wild and reckless fabrications,
ever more rampant.
As for the root-source of the Three Teachings,
not only was it left unplumbed,
but even mutual ridicule and attack arose.
The Way’s brambles grew rank,
the sages’ words were stifled and blocked.
Had not our Master, the Teacher of Emperors, Vouchsafing Blessing,
raised his arm and cried out,
throwing wide the path of awakening,
the culture of this world would have nearly fallen to ruin,
human hearts reduced to pulp.

In the year *renwu*, his crane-chariot descended to the mortal realm.
Alighting at the Xia Ford,
he gathered his disciples,
established the Three Altars,
and expounded the numinous chapters.
For over a decade he expanded the true transformation,
until the year *renchen*,
when he completed the celestial work
and entrusted its carving and printing.
These scriptures penetrate the Three Teachings’ essential purport,
their principles profound and far-reaching.
What was divided, he united;
what was dual, he made one;
what was obscure, he illumined;
what was doubtful, he clarified.
He revealed the secrets of Heaven and Earth,
greatly displayed the subtleties of past and present.
Truly a rare and wondrous text,
a most *xuan* treasure-talisman—
a bridge for late learners,
an awakening for posterity.
The power of its merit and virtue—
how could my brush ever exhaust its description?
How dare I presume to praise it!

Yet recalling these decades,
in all the affairs of the canon’s production,
I, Qiu, was humbly numbered among the attendants,
able to offer slight assistance,
running before and after,
ever graced with generous favor.
I drank the Dharma-milk,
feasted on the hearing of wondrous sounds,
and glimpsed but a ten-thousandth of this Way at the Master’s side.
This was the karmic opportunity of us disciples of the Three Altars.
Yet all was due to our Master, the Teacher of Emperors, Vouchsafing Blessing—
his tireless, unwearying exhortations—
that this great continuity came to be.

After the canon’s carving and printing,
our Master attained the supreme fruit of the Jade Clarity,
while his disciples received boundless blessings.
Only later did I come to regret:
in recent years, the practice has gradually waned.
Though widely disseminated, it was not for long.
There were those who, regarding this canon,
turned to Master Sun Shoushu of Jinling.
From early on, he had revered the *xuan* lineage,
long savoring the Dao’s station.
Having received my beneficence,
he gazed upon the vast scripture,
and joyfully bowed in delight.
He vowed to re-engrave it,
to broaden its circulation.
Yet he feared that the scripture’s solemnity,
with its strict precepts for reverent handling,
might prevent devotees from daily study and realization,
thus hindering the Master’s intent to universally bestow.
So he requested it be made into a simpler volume,
bound into fascicles.
The one who vowed to transcribe it with utmost sincerity
was Xie Kecheng of Shangyuan.
When the work was completed,
he entreated me to record its origins at the scripture’s end.

I reflect: the perfected one fathoms the divine and reaches transformation—
none can compare.
Thus his expounding of the ultimate words,
his vast exploration and wide-ranging search,
must be without limit.
Though the Dao’s profundity
has already been revealed in the depths of the hidden,
the text’s clear dissemination
still depends on those who harmonize the warp and weft,
who regulate and order.
For the *xuan* teaching’s fence and hedge,
this man of sincerity and faith
can stand for half the realm in the southeast.
Will not our Master, the Teacher of Emperors, Vouchsafing Blessing,
find some consolation in his boundless vow to ferry all beings?

We shall see these fascicles
spreading to the sea’s edge,
so that all beings may hear the essentials of the Way,
gaze upon the true source.
From the Three Grades’ one to two,
two to three,
three to ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand—
until in every person’s heart and eye,
this Three Grades, one canon, resides.
The power of its merit and virtue—
truly beyond measure or count!

Master Sun’s merit in propagating it,
and Master Xie’s effort in transcribing it—
will their blessings not endure with this canon forever?
I, Qiu, humbly partook of the honor of witnessing these events,
and dare to set down their beginnings and ends with my brush,
inscribing this at the volume’s close.
May those who hear of this in the world and in posterity

**A Brief Preface to the *Cantong Jing***

The exposition of the *Cantong Jing* began in the *guichou* year and was completed in the *jiwei* year, spanning seven years in all. Originally planned to be held in southern Qian, the initial collaborators—Li Kexiu, who returned to Yu; Tu Jingcheng, who retired; and others like Yao, Sun, and Hong, who dispersed—left only myself and Deng Dongyan to shoulder the task. Yet Dongyan was far away in Yunnan, so the first plan came to naught. We then petitioned to complete it in Hubei instead of Qian.

Among those who contributed to its progress, my nephew Yun Cheng bore the greatest effort. The details have been thoroughly recounted in Mr. Huang’s preface to the *Wupin Jing*. The preface to the *Wupin Jing* states: “The Patriarch Lü took pity on the Three Chu regions, a hundredfold more than on the Five Mounds!” Yet the Patriarch’s compassion in delivering the world was impartial, without distinction. However, while the *Bapin Jing* was expounded in various places, the Chu region alone received it again and again—first the *Wupin Jing* at Qizhen, then the *Sanpin Jing* and *Cantong Jing* at Hansan—all within or near Ezhou. Was this not because the Peach Blossom Spring’s mouth, Yueyang Tower, Yellow Crane Jetty, and other sacred sites abound there, long famed as haunts of immortals? The eight hundred leagues of Dragon Sands await their time to respond—surely that time is not far off.

In southern Yunnan, Du Yujing held this canon in the highest esteem, deeming it purer than pure and a counterpart to the Six Classics. How true!

Does not the world’s work truly rest upon karmic conditions? Long ago, the First Patriarch Bodhidharma crossed the sea to come east, for karmic conditions brought him to the Land of the Sinitic Realm. Later, he encountered Shenguang and transmitted the Buddha-mind seal. To this day, people know of the intention behind the Western Patriarch’s coming.

When Patriarch Lü expounded the *Cantong Jing*, people from several provinces suddenly gathered by karmic conditions to bring this great canon into being. Tracing its origins, it truly began with the Guizhou scholar Liu Qingxu, who in his youth followed his father on official travels to Chu. There he studied under Song Shinan—Shinan being the first disciple of Hansan—who, in the intervals between lecturing on the arts, spoke of Hansan’s Patriarch Lü’s Dao-ground, where the *Three-Pin Qingwei Jing* and the *Essential Canon of the Chan School* had been expounded. Qingxu heard and grew admiring. One day, he accompanied his teacher to pay homage to the Patriarch, who perceived his deep karmic affinity and bestowed upon him a name.

Before long, Qingxu returned to Qian. In the year *gui-chou* of Yongzheng’s reign, he encountered Liu Wuwo of Yiling, Deng Dongyan of Quyang, and Tu Jingcheng of Huanchuan in Bo. At that time, Li Kexiu of Zhongzhou, advanced in years and skilled in external matters, had also come to Qian. Hearing of Hansan’s name, all rejoiced. They asked Qingxu to lead the way, bringing Li Licheng and Deng Xincheng, and in the year *jia-yin* of the she-ti month, they paid homage to the Patriarch to present their request for the composition and expounding of the canon.

Ah! How extraordinary!

When Qingxu first followed his teacher to the palace, he never imagined such karmic affinity would arise. Upon returning south after the request for composition, the canon’s expounding did not come to fruition. The principal figures dispersed, save for Wuwo, whose resolve remained unshaken. He consulted Dongyan and once more dispatched Qingxu to earnestly invite the Patriarch to complete the work in Qian, journeying to Hubei. With joy, Qingxu set forth, undeterred by cold or heat, traversing back and forth over ten times. Thus, Li Benshu, Ding Cunshu, and Liu Wucheng, among others, joined in succession.

In the spring of *ji-wei*, the accumulated scriptures were finally completed, and the expounding commenced. At that time, Liu Qinghui initiated the work, while Qingxu ultimately brought it to fruition. That winter, Xincheng arrived from Yunnan to Hubei, and the *Cantong Jing* was already accomplished.

When the initial gathering took place in *jia-yin*, on the day the scriptures were begun, auspicious cranes danced in the clouds. By the time the canon was expounded, they once more soared and gathered. Such swift response was surely the result of sincere devotion.

I have often observed that while Lüzu’s Daoist sanctuaries in Ezhou are many, only Hansan’s has endured for decades without decline. This is because the founders’ sincerity laid the groundwork, and their descendants skillfully carried it forward, enabling these gentlemen to unite from thousands of miles away—could anything be more magnificent?

Though unworthy, I was fortunate to attend the Dharma assembly and was entrusted with the expounding. I rejoiced deeply that Qingxu’s initial sincerity never wavered, and that Wuwo and the others remained steadfast in their vows, achieving success together.

Alas! People dwell in different places, their paths diverging—even skilled diviners could not have foreseen this. Truly, what unfolds without deliberate design must be predestined by karma. Here, in the leisure of collating the complete work, I record the canon’s origins and conclusion, placing it at the scriptures’ outset. Though my words are coarse and unrefined, they serve to mark this gathering as no mere coincidence.

Respectfully inscribed by Huang Chengshu of Shayi, a humble practitioner.

**Preface to the *Cantong Jing* of the Divine Lord of Zitong**

Since the rise of the ancient classics, the term *jing* (scripture) has shone resplendently in the world. For the early sage-kings distilled the Way of human relations and daily conduct into teachings, awakening the world and guiding the people, so that all might daily progress in goodness and correction, attaining the highest order.

Later generations revered these as essential canons for governing the world. Yet it was not only the Buddhist and Daoist traditions that first coined the term *jing* to distinguish themselves and astonish the common folk. The scriptures of both schools, in fact, also enlighten the human heart and supplement royal governance.

Worldly scholars, failing to perceive this, assume they oppose the sagely Way and often mislead the ignorant masses, who drift with the current and recklessly mock them. When the Divine Lord Fuyou expounded this canon, he harmonized the Three Teachings in his words, united the Five Constants in his instructions, compiled the subtle sayings of the Four Masters, and gathered the threads of a hundred schools. Citing classics and drawing from broad inquiry, he clarified doubts and elucidated meanings, weaving them into a coherent whole. Its principles are both manifest and profound; its language, comprehensive and complete. It reveals secrets unspoken by the ancient sages and expounds truths unarticulated by buddhas and immortals. Truly, it is the Dharma-word of cultivation and realization, the essential canon for instructing the world!

How could its enlightenment of the human heart and supplementation of royal governance be insignificant? Those who study this canon must read its words, ponder its meanings, recite it morning and night, and daily advance in personal practice. Do not dismiss it as mere Buddhist or Daoist scripture, opposed to the books of sages and worthies.

Even in a village of ten households, there must be loyalty and trust! In this vast world, how could there be no discerning minds? If those deeply rooted in goodness, with keen insight and wisdom, practice this canon diligently and disseminate it widely, ensuring that every household understands and each person harbors the impulse toward virtue, then blessings will naturally abound without seeking. Its supplementation of royal governance and support of sages and worthies will rely significantly on this canon—how could it be merely a scripture of immortals?

Yet if one regards it as the sacred text revealed by the Most High or the essential Dharma expounded by the Divine Lord, treasures it without ever perusing it, or merely recites it mechanically while neglecting the Way of daily conduct and human relations, how could this fulfill the Divine Lord’s compassionate intent to awaken the world?

May those who read this canon reflect on my words.

**Eulogy Verses for the *Cantong Jing* (First Scroll)**

Unveiling subtleties and expounding mysteries,
Revealing the true and wondrous,
Converging the Three into One—words elucidate,
The Dao and virtue wholly encompassed.
Purifying karma and dissolving transgressions,
Broadly planting the causes and conditions of goodness.

**Eulogy Verses for the Opening of the Sutra’s Wondrous Gate**

The Great Dao is wondrously empty and nameless,
Dark and indistinct, yet possessing true essence.
The marvelous principle of the One Origin unites the Three Teachings;
At first, the primordial chaos divided, and images began to take form.
Solemn and profound, it proceeds directly from the nature of the heart-mind,
Where the roots of karma are cleansed, and the sprouts of goodness arise.
Through cultivation and realization, the meaning of the entire sutra is grasped,
And the Dharma-body, thus and unmoving, transcends the Supreme Vehicle.

Citing the sutra and drawing from the classics, we synthesize and compare,
Instructing and enlightening the deluded to awaken to their original school.
Know that the body’s forms and appearances belong to illusion;
The myriad dharmas are contained within a single word.
Once awakened, there is no need for excessive interpretation—
The turning of the sutra’s secret essentials is true mastery.
From this, the wondrous and wondrous is revealed,
And age after age, beings draw upon the Dao’s breeze.

The Most High revealed this to rescue the kalpa, dispel disasters,
Bestow blessings, resolve calamities, and safeguard destiny,
Enabling realization through the *Cantong Jing’s* wondrous sutra.

**Chapter One: The Origin of the Dharma Assembly**

In former times, the Vast Law Heavenly Worthy, having attained the Dao, before the Sacred Master of the True Yang, made a great vow to universally deliver all beings in Jambudvīpa. Thus, traversing the mortal realm, he composed the *Two Chapters on Pointing to the Wondrous*, elucidating the Way of refining mercury and lead. Yet the verses were profound and obscure, and worldly scholars failed to grasp the principle of inverting yin and yang or the work of "seeking heaven and digging earth." Therefore, he took the two chapters of wondrous text and concealed them in a stone chamber on Mount Qingcheng, awaiting those with true understanding.

Later, in Piling, he expounded the *Eightfold Scripture of Immortals*, which, compared to the *Pointing to the Wondrous*, was far clearer. However, the purport of "ascending and descending water and fire" and "infant boy and maiden girl," along with the discourse on "dragon and tiger, furnace and cauldron," were largely metaphorical. Unaware of this, people strayed into heterodox paths. Even the rare perceptive scholar often clung to the literal text, failing to comprehend the principle of "obtaining words while forgetting images" or "using intention to meet the intent."

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, often manifested in the region of Yi and Zhen, spreading transformation through flying phoenixes and broadly forming karmic connections. Whether the *Fivefold* or *Threefold* scriptures, he expounded them in succession, revealing the subtleties of the Great Vehicle, which never depart from the luminous awakening of one’s own nature. Thus, those who cultivate the truth could follow the text to practice the Dao—truly a compassionate and skillful means, fulfilling his original vow.

As the scripture’s circulation remained limited and few upheld it, while attending the Dharma-seat of the Primordial Beginning, he heard the discourse on the Most Wondrous, Supreme, Perfect, and True Dao. By chance, he observed that in the celestial division of Well and Ghost, baleful qi coiled in darkness. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, surveying the kalpa’s fate, sighed deeply. Just as he considered petitioning the Primordial Beginning to preach the Dharma for salvation, a Dharma-heir from the Heavenly Worthy’s lineage entreated him to descend via flying phoenix to Luodian.

The Heavenly Worthy, deeply committed to delivering beings, was moved by compassion. He implored the Primordial Beginning Honored One and the Jade Emperor, beseeching them to universally proclaim the Great Transformation in the miasmic and pestilential lands of the southern barbarians. Upon closer examination of the karmic conditions, it still pertained to Ezhu.

Thus, the Heavenly Worthy bowed before the Primordial Beginning’s seat and addressed him: "Your servant once requested to expound the wondrous transformation in Luoshi to save the beings of the final kalpa. Now, having examined the celestial cycles and the convergence of karmic conditions, it should be in the celestial division of Yi and Zhen. Your servant now requests to shift to the land of Chu, to propagate the wondrous work. Humbly, I pray for your compassion and mercy to grant this request."

Then the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy declared: "Is not what you have petitioned most excellent? I shall command those who renew life and perpetuate destiny to assist and support the primordial transformation. You must clearly expound it, eschewing stale words, so that even the simplest men and women may know to cultivate and reflect, return to the true Dao, comprehend and transcend birth and death, and escape the realms of suffering—this shall be your merit."

The Heavenly Worthy bowed in gratitude for the grace bestowed. From the Golden Towers of the Jade Capital, he mounted a five-colored auspicious cloud, with white cranes leading the way and azure dragons bearing his chariot. Heavenly blossoms scattered in profusion, and auspicious mists swirled as he, accompanied by the hosts of heaven and the immortals, arrived before the Jade Emperor’s throne to present his petition. Once more, the Jade Emperor, moved by his compassionate vow, granted permission to commence the exposition. Thereupon, with the assembled perfected beings and sagely worthies, he descended in spirit to the Ezhu sanctuary, where the Three Ways converged. For the celestial beings, the assembled disciples, and all present, he proclaimed the *Thirty-Two Chapters of the Most High’s Wondrous Scripture for Saving the Kalpa*.

**Chapter Two: The Essential Teachings of the Wondrous Dao**

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed the fourfold assembly: "What I now speak is solely of truth, unburdened by extraneous matters. Those who cultivate the Dao yet fail to grasp the root and merely pursue its branches—though they strive with utmost diligence—are like trees without roots; what benefit can there be? This root originates in the undifferentiated primordial *qi*: before heaven and earth divided, before sun and moon shone, in the chaos of Great Nothingness, there was no form, no name, no sound, no scent. Heaven received it and became heaven—where the four seasons proceed, cold and heat revolve, the sun ascends, and the moon waxes and wanes; clouds, mist, rain, dew, wind, thunder, lightning, and hail—all cycle through this *qi* without cease, day and night. Earth received it and became earth—where mountains stand firm, waters flow, bearing peaks without weight, containing seas without leakage. Without this singular *qi*, who would govern it?

Man, born of heaven and earth’s *qi*, inherits heaven’s *qi* as yang and earth’s *qi* as yin. Yang is vigorous, yin is compliant; the two *qi* alternate in motion, like a ring without end. The Confucians call it ‘the nature mandated by heaven,’ the Buddhists probe ‘the original face,’ and the Daoists inquire into ‘the state before father and mother were born’—all refer to this *qi*, wherein the principle resides.

The Most High said: ‘Before the image of the Lord.’ And again: ‘There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.’ From ancient times, buddhas, immortals, sages, and worthies cultivated body and destiny by this alone; in composing scriptures to bequeath to the world, they illuminated this alone. Yet in recent times, the common people, failing to return to the root, neglect personal practice and seek externally. Though they read all the sacred scriptures and exhaust the secret classics, they let their own single spark of primordial yang-true-*qi* dissipate unheeded, dying in ignorance—how deeply lamentable!

Now, for you gathered here, I shall reveal the essentials of cultivating the true: you must comprehend this pre-celestial singular *qi*, which is the ‘substance of the wondrous true.’ Yet this *qi* cannot be grasped through mere sitting in rigid stillness. Only in walking, standing, sitting, and lying—in every word and deed—must you subtly observe and recognize it. In every movement, its origin is unseen; in every stillness, its cessation is unseen. Vague and indistinct, its traces cannot be fathomed. By thus investigating its root and origin, you must strive for clarity. Then, suddenly, the original spark of yang-light will appear, naturally penetrating and purifying, illuminating the nature and heaven. The accumulated habits of ten thousand kalpas melt away in an instant; the great kalpa’s cataclysmic disasters cannot harm you. You shall share the years of heaven, consort with the sages, escape the wheel of rebirth, and roam freely at ease!

This *qi*, though without limit, becomes the Supreme Ultimate; it gives birth to heaven and earth, to man and all things. Within the human body, it resides in the Yellow Court, coursing through the hundred meridians. In its vastness, it encompasses the cosmos; in its minuteness, it is no different from a millet grain. Yet even a millet grain has form and shape, while this *qi* is so subtle as to be formless and traceless. Though the cosmos has bounds, this *qi* is so great as to pervade without gap. How profound! How ultimate! How exhaustive!

In my earlier *Treatise on Pointing to the Wondrous*, I already expounded this principle, yet few have grasped it. Now I reveal to the immortals and the true: the first step in cultivation must begin here. If you do not thoroughly comprehend this principle, even after kalpas of practice, it is but ‘having-activity’—and having-activity is having-leakage, far removed from the Dao. Only non-activity is without leakage, enabling you to unite in virtue with heaven and earth, and in brightness with sun and moon.

All you cultivators who aspire to comprehend the Dao and realize the true—without understanding this pre-celestial singular *qi*, how can you succeed?"

**Chapter Three: Revering Heaven and Earth**

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Those who study the Dao and seek to understand mind and nature must first know the origin from which mind and nature arise. All beings—human and otherwise—begin their lives through heaven bestowing their nature and earth bearing their form; thus, heaven and earth are called the Great Father and Great Mother. From ancient times, buddhas, immortals, sages, and worthies have all revered heaven and earth first. Though people differ in wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness, male and female, worthy and unworthy, all alike bear the high and tread the thick.

The degenerate customs of later ages fail to recognize that nature comes from heaven and life is ordained by fate. They indulge their minds at will, defy heaven, and violate principle, thereby incurring heaven’s judgment of their evil—some falling into poverty or lowliness, others into illness or early death. The foolish of the world do not examine themselves but blame their own karma on others: calling heaven unhelpful, they utter wanton complaints—this is called ‘resenting heaven.’ Feigning goodness, they covet what is not theirs—this is called ‘deceiving heaven.’ Acting wrongly in secret, they conceal it when discovered—this is called ‘obscuring heaven.’ Speaking of benevolence and righteousness, their hearts brim with thorns; believing heaven does not know and others do not perceive, they deceive—this is called ‘duping heaven.’ Facing the Three Luminaries, they lack sincerity and reverence, neglect dignity, and abandon awe—this is called ‘profaning heaven.’ When their own fate falters, they envy others’ wealth, resenting heaven as unjust—this is called ‘slandering heaven.’ Unenlightened in study, uncomprehending in scripture recitation, they recklessly criticize the ancients and mock the virtuous—this is called ‘belittling heaven.’ Even among the few who cultivate and reflect, who vaguely incline toward goodness, their good thoughts remain impure, their good roots unsteady, their good fruits shallow. Yet they crave blessings, recklessly summon monks and Daoists, repeatedly submitting memorials—this is called ‘defiling heaven.’

I now tell you cultivators: you must first revere heaven and earth. Yet this reverence is not flattering heaven to seek fortune. Upright people do not accept flattery—how much less heaven and earth! True reverence arises from constantly examining one’s own nature-heaven and ceaselessly scrutinizing one’s own mind-ground. If a word does not accord with heaven and earth, do not speak it; if an action does not accord with heaven and earth, do not perform it. With the luminous nature-heaven of our spirit, we look up to embody the profound heaven; with the tranquil mind-ground of our heart, we look down to observe the peaceful earth. As Master Ziyu said: ‘Preserve the mind and nurture nature to serve heaven.’ As the rites prescribe: ‘Hearing thunder, one fears; in the dead of night, one rises.’ This is called reverence and awe. But the vulgar of later ages, lacking true conduct, perform rituals with false gestures—this is merely ‘deceiving heaven,’ not reverence.

Yet mind and nature are difficult to understand; entering through reverence and awe, even in the darkest chamber, one feels as though heaven and earth’s divine luminosity shines above, ever observing. With such a mind, deviance cannot arise. When deviance does not arise, the mind’s sovereign is at peace, nature-heaven bright and clear. Body, speech, and thought naturally become pure. When the three karmas are pure, the six roots and six dusts can all be purified, and the foundation for entering sagehood is already established.

Yet one must not relax for even a moment, but constantly apply the work of cleansing. When the yin tally is fully dissolved and the yang spirit emerges, vast and silent, the celestial true radiates light. Seated in the heavenly court, hidden and manifest are unfathomable. This is called a buddha—though ‘buddha’ is but a forced name; this is called an immortal—though ‘immortal’ is but a forced term. Immortal or buddha? Sage or worthy? Though names vary, in truth they arise from one mind. Mind and nature—are they two or one? Mind, nature, and heaven share the same body, no different. This is called the Three Powers, united with the Dao as one.

Revering heaven and earth yields the most wondrous efficacy. Without reverence and awe, to speak of studying the Dao is mere demonic delusion. After the end of life, one will surely fall into evil destinies, forever losing the true Dao."

Having established reverence and awe in the heart, the Three Karmas may be purified. Yet these Three Karmas must be examined in each matter and scrutinized at all times to gradually achieve purity.

Take bodily karma, for instance: killing, stealing, and lust—regardless of wealth, status, or rank, all people possess these. What does "possess" mean? Consider the karma of *killing*: at its gravest, emperors wage war recklessly, generals slaughter surrendered cities, and civil officials treat lives as grass, executing the innocent without cause. Next, the powerful and wealthy indulge in unjust slaughter, butchers and brokers cruelly carve living beings. Even in small matters, such as harming insects at the start of spring or cutting down plants in their early growth—these are all readily visible forms of killing karma. Moreover, when common fools harbor grudges, they seek to annihilate their enemies. The moment hatred arises, the impulse to kill stirs, and Heaven records their sin in the ledger of slaughter, ensuring they receive the retribution of killing, with no escape. There are also those cunning clerks and officers who wield their pens to destroy lives, disregarding Heaven’s principles, perverting justice, and tormenting the innocent. Through such killing causes, killing effects are brewed, and karmic vengeance continues endlessly. The *Most High* said: "The Way of Heaven: it does not contend yet excels in victory, does not speak yet responds perfectly. Heaven’s net is vast and wide, loose yet never failing—how could there be no retribution?" Yet the ancient sages’ warnings against killing were but general admonitions; I now expound upon them in detail. You, all learners, if you purify the karma of killing, you embody the virtue of cherishing life, for all creatures, however humble, share the same body as we. From ancient times, sages and worthies have held compassion for all beings as their heart. To cherish life is to purify killing karma; when killing karma is purified, the primordial qi of Great Harmony resides within, and this heart communes with Heaven and Earth. What disaster would not vanish? What blessing would not increase?

Next is *stealing*. Even common men and women who retain a shred of shame would not willingly commit theft. It seems rare, yet what constitutes stealing? Must one rob in broad daylight or break in at night to be called a thief? Whenever officials embezzle state treasuries or take what belongs to others—be it a blade of grass, a flower, a sip of water, or a bite of food—it is called stealing! For if the thing is not one’s own and is secretly taken, deceiving others without their knowledge, it is theft. Thus, the sages of old took nothing not rightfully theirs, no matter how small, and were meticulous in caution—this was their principle. As for scholars and literati who plagiarize writings to seize empty fame and deceive the world, this is an even graver form of theft. Heaven detests such intent, and the spirits observe it. Eventually, exposure brings ridicule upon the scholarly community. This kind of stealing karma is widely committed yet seldom recognized, truly treacherous.

Next is *lust*. Lust is a transgression the world easily commits, and the powerful, wealthy, scholars, and literati are the worst offenders. From ancient scriptures and sagely teachings, warnings against lust are earnest and urgent. For lust’s evils are boundless: it ruins reputations, corrupts virtue, inflicts endless harm, and spreads the gravest poison. One need not engage in the act itself to be called lustful. Composing lewd words, crafting obscene tools, harboring a single lustful thought, or recounting a single lewd tale—all reveal that the root of lust remains unsevered. How many in the world, when faced with seductive beauty, can maintain an undisturbed heart, unstained by even a speck of dust? The Buddha once instructed his disciples: "When you see a woman of age, regard her as your elder sister; when you see a young woman, regard her as your daughter." By reverently guarding the heart and preventing its dissipation, even when the eyes encounter sensual forms, the heart remains detached from them. Mastering this, the root of desire is eradicated, and one avoids defilement.

Yet the root of these Three Karmas lies in the *heart*! The wealthy, powerful, scholars, and literati commit these transgressions most frequently. You, all learners, if you wish to purify bodily karma, must first purify the heart. Once the root of karma is removed, its sprouts will never grow again.

**Chapter Five: Severing Verbal Karma**

Having purified bodily karma, one must still guard against verbal karma. For verbal karma is more easily committed than bodily karma, and even lofty and enlightened individuals often fail to restrain it. "Speak not unless it accords with propriety"—this is the essence of self-mastery. Among the disciples of Confucius, only Yan Yuan, who thrice reflected on his faults like a flaw in a white jade scepter, earned the Sage’s singular praise. Even one as talented as Zilu, who excelled in eloquence, brought regret upon himself with a single ill-considered remark, damaging trust—how much more so for others? Once, the Tathāgata Śākyamuni led his disciples across the Ganges, where they saw fishermen hauling a massive fish with the heads of a hundred beasts. The disciples, unable to fathom the cause, asked the Buddha: "What vile creature is this, to bear such a form? Is it not strange?" The Buddha replied: "In a past kalpa, there was a monk who, relying on his eloquence, would argue with others, insisting on victory. If even slightly contradicted, he would fly into a rage, hurling insults and curses, calling others by the names of beasts. His maledictions harmed others but ultimately harmed himself, deepening his karmic debt and worsening his retribution. For ten thousand kalpas, he was trapped in icy hells, unable to escape—is this not tragic?" Hearing these words, the great disciples listened intently, admonishing one another, and vowed that all beings would forever sever verbal karma to avoid falling into evil destinies.

Verbal karma has four aspects: deceitful speech and frivolous talk are common among the clever, while divisive speech and harsh words prevail among the foolish and lowly. For example, scholars newly entered into the literati, monks barely versed in Chan teachings, Daoist priests with a smattering of breathwork—all boast and brag, indulging in arrogance, uttering grand words to deceive the world.

Those who study Confucianism declare, *"I have attained the essence of holding to the Mean!"* Those who follow Buddhism proclaim, *"I have realized the supreme One Vehicle!"* Those who practice the Dao boast, *"I have achieved the Golden Elixir and Returned Cinnabar!"*—all are gross delusions. Clinging to their own delusions, they further deceive others, remaining mired in perversity their whole lives, never awakening.

To hear their words, one might think them equal to buddhas and immortals, comparable to sages and worthies. Yet observing their conduct, one finds them steeped in obscurity, no different from the common rabble.

As for frivolous speech, men of letters are especially prone to it. Their poetry is lush and seductive, their literary flourishes exquisite, flaunting their talent while violating the gravest precepts. Some even compose heretical doctrines to bewilder the ignorant, corrupting virtue, ruining reputations, and undermining customs—all for the fleeting thrill of a sharp pen, heedless of the boundless calamities they unleash. Thus, the transgression of frivolous speech is deeply insidious, and its retribution most severe.

As for divisive speech, it is not only the province of petty rogues who wag their tongues, distorting right and wrong. Even foolish men and women engage in it, speaking of this to that one, and of that to this one, inverting truth and falsehood—this, too, is divisive speech. Scholars who wield sophistry to alter facts, court officials whose proposals shift with the wind, causing rightful discourse to be muddled and the worthy to be estranged—all engage in divisive speech. So, too, do false teachers who lack firm conviction, wavering between two sides, leading their disciples astray.

As for harsh speech, it belongs to the foolish who seize upon others’ faults, magnifying flaws, indulging in mockery and slander, flaunting their own strengths while exposing others’ weaknesses. Such acts provoke Heaven’s wrath, and the hidden punishments—like the karmic fish of the Ganges—are truly lamentable.

Yet these evil deeds are not merely warned against in the scriptures of buddhas and immortals, which vividly describe the retribution of hells and the tearing out of tongues. Even the Confucian classics admonish: *"Words may incite war,"* as recorded in the *Book of Documents*; *"Be cautious in speech,"* as taught in the *Odes*. *"What harm can the mouth do? It is the gate of disaster,"* inscribed in the *Three Seals*. The words of sages and worthies are most concise and direct, while the teachings of buddhas and immortals are exhaustive and clear.

Now, I shall further elucidate for you: all present here, and all future beings, must heed my words. Abide by the admonition of the *Three Seals*, restrain yourselves in silence, do not flaunt your talent or wield your tongue recklessly. Be reverent in speech, ever mindful of caution—exercising care before words are spoken, and reflection as they are uttered. Let no false speech arise, no frivolous words be spoken; guard against divisive speech and forever sever harsh words. Through such purification, you may cultivate your person, serve Heaven, and lay the foundation for advancing virtue—this is of utmost importance.

**Chapter Six: Guarding Against the Karma of Thought**

When the karma of speech is purified, yet all that issues from the mouth arises from the mind. All thoughts are born of the heart, and the heart is the master of the body—its restraint must be strict. If one does not habitually exercise caution, using righteousness to govern affairs and ritual to govern the mind, then wickedness will frequently sprout, and once arisen, it becomes difficult to subdue. Both the karma of body and speech will then fail to be purified.

The peril of the mind may be likened to a team of four horses—only through skillful control can they be prevented from running wild. Thus, the sages and worthies of old taught people to be vigilant in solitude. Only by being vigilant in solitude can the thoughts that arise be sincere and free from deceit, and the karma of greed, anger, and delusion find no opportunity to arise, thereby purifying the mind.

Yet what is called "greed" is not limited to those who abuse power to extort, crave profit insatiably, abandon the law for bribes, or indulge in endless corruption. Even merchants who ensnare profits in the marketplace through manifold monopolies, or the powerful who scheme to exploit others down to the last penny—all are called greedy. As the *Most High* says: *"Do not see what may be desired, lest the mind be disturbed; rare and precious goods hinder right conduct."* The *Book of Rites* states: *"In distribution, do not seek excess."* For once greed arises, one knows only self-interest and disregards others; good thoughts vanish, and evil karma takes root.

Yet greed takes many forms, which cannot all be enumerated. If what one covets is fame, the mind is ensnared, and one becomes obsessed with gain and loss, stopping at nothing. Should desires go unfulfilled, resentment flares against others, and greed transforms into anger. If what one covets is profit, the mind schemes to seize what others possess to sate its own desires, resorting to cunning and deceit worse than theft. As Master Ziyu said: *"Rising at cock’s crow, toiling ceaselessly for gain."* Even the followers of Robber Zhi—do they not become thieves?

If what one covets is sensual pleasure, beauty is pursued without restraint, indulgence knows no bounds, and shame and integrity are cast aside. The inner chambers fall into disorder, and greed transforms into lust. All such karmic acts of greed arise in the mind and manifest in action: some rely on power to intimidate others into submission, while others employ cunning schemes to bend others to their will. The karma of body and speech thus accumulates.

The harm of greedy karma unfolds endlessly across lives and transformations—how can one not fear it? Now, I shall dissect and clarify this for you, all you learners: you must vow to purify yourselves and cleanse your minds. Do not indulge in greed, lest you entangle yourselves in the realms of suffering.

The first is "anger." The harm of anger is like a raging fire—once ignited, its flames spread like a wildfire, impossible to extinguish or approach. The *Classic of Yin Convergence* says: *"Fire is born of wood, and disaster erupts swiftly."* Thus, the buddhas and immortals of old practiced forbearance to extinguish the fire of anger. The *Most High* says: *"The highest virtue is like water, which benefits all things without contention and thus approaches the Dao. The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong."* The *Book of Rites* states: *"Do not seek to prevail through cruelty. If one can be yielding and humble, not seeking to surpass others, how can anger arise?"* The worthies of the Confucian tradition—such as Yanzi, who did not contend, and Master Meng, who turned inward—all regarded anger as harmful to the Dao, obstructing merit and virtue. Thus, even when faced with unjust treatment or violent provocation, they accepted it calmly and did not engage in dispute.

The foolish of the world, when slighted by others, immediately plot revenge, often leading to feuds and attacks. At best, they exchange bitter words; at worst, they resort to blades and slaughter. A moment’s rage may bring ruin upon oneself and one’s kin. Thus, the karma of anger, lurking within, causes the karma of body and speech to rage outwardly. Yet the deluded, even unto death, remain unaware—how tragic!

The second is "delusion." Delusion does not mean utter ignorance or dull-witted obscurity. Rather, it refers to those who stubbornly cling to their own views, pursuing a single path without knowing the great Dao or comprehending true principle. Their minds are shrouded in perverse views, and they cannot awaken. Once delusion takes deep root, even if they encounter a perfected being who teaches them the true path, they refuse to repent. Such deluded ones are truly benighted.

There are also those of keen intellect who know full well that worldly affairs are illusory, that glory fades swiftly, and that all possessions ultimately return to emptiness. Yet their desires and attachments are difficult to sever. Though they strive to restrain themselves, they soon relapse into confusion, and right understanding cannot take hold. Like the bright sun obscured by clouds, their true nature remains hidden, and they wander in delusion their whole lives. Only when form dissolves and life ends do they regret their past—too late! Too late!

Of the karma of body, speech, and mind, purification varies in difficulty. The karma of body and speech manifests outwardly and is easier to examine. Those of clear principle may succeed in this. But the mind is hidden and not easily discerned, making it even harder to control.

To purify these three karmas is to fulfill the *Ten Virtues*. When the Ten Virtues are complete, one may ascend to heaven. To indulge in these three karmas is to commit the *Ten Evils*. When the Ten Evils prevail, one sinks into the realms of suffering. All you learners, be vigilant over these three karmas, that you may enter the Dao.

**Chapter Seven: Investigating the Nature of the Original Mind**
When the three karmas are purified, one must seek to understand the supreme Dao. The essence of the supreme Dao is difficult to express in words: it is formless yet gives form to all forms, imageless yet gives image to all images. It is voiced as sound yet is truly soundless; it is colored as hue yet is truly colorless. Vast and indistinct, it cannot be known by wisdom nor grasped by perception.

In its presence, nothing is without it; in its absence, even heaven and earth do not know it. If heaven itself does not know it, how much less can man?

Yet this Dao, when sought, appears as an empty vastness without trace; when embodied, it is truly real and not illusory. Heaven and earth abide by this Dao, and all beings abide by this Dao. It is empty yet able to be full; full yet able to be empty. From non-being it becomes being; from being it returns to non-being. Non-being and being, being and non-being—its principle is profoundly subtle, its meaning deeply mysterious. The Most High said: *"Subtler still, ever subtler."* Lord Wenshi said: *"That which cannot be spoken is not the Dao; that which cannot be spoken is the Dao."* Though the Dao has no name, we force a name upon it, calling it the Dao. Since it is named the Dao, how can it ultimately be unattainable? The *Book of Changes* says: *"One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao."* Zisi said: *"Following one’s nature—this is called the Dao."* For humans are born with one yin and one yang, and nature resides within our minds. The essence of cultivating the Dao, then, is to embody it within this interplay of yin and yang.

Yet the Dao is originally One, while teachings diverge in their paths, and practices differ in subtle ways. The Buddhist and Daoist traditions both esteem subtlety and emptiness, whereas the Confucian school emphasizes earnest practice. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: *"The benevolent see it and call it benevolence; the wise see it and call it wisdom."* This is the explanation for the division into three teachings. Though the substance of the Dao is empty, its function is real. Those who skillfully embody the Dao directly exhaust their nature and destiny, advancing ceaselessly. In a single moment of sudden clarity, all becomes thoroughly understood—this is the direct ascent, attainable only by those of the highest capacity. As for those of middling and lesser capacity, they must engage in earnest practice within the daily movements of activity and stillness. Only after deep cultivation and encountering an enlightened teacher does a single touch bring awakening—this is attaining the substance through its function. Proceeding from the lower to the higher, though the difficulty of the practice may differ, the realization of the Dao is ultimately the same.

If cultivators of the Dao, in moments of leisure when not yet engaged with external things, can preserve their minds in silent reflection, turning inward to observe, then the original substance of the Dao requires no external seeking. It is preserved in the mind and exists in one’s nature. Yet世儒, failing to examine closely, falsely condemn the emptiness and quiescence of Buddhas and immortals as contrary to the sagely learning. They do not realize that what is called "empty" is not entirely empty—it is empty yet able to be full. What is called "non-being" is not entirely non-being—it is non-being yet able to be being. As for the meaning of quiescence and extinction, it is quiescent yet luminous, extinguished yet ever-present. Observe the plants and trees: when they wither and fall, they seem empty, non-existent, quiescent, extinguished. Yet when spring arrives, they flourish anew as before. If not for the quiescent and empty substance hidden within, how could they grow lush and vigorous, unchanged from before? Thus we know that quiescence is not annihilation, and emptiness is not falsehood. Those who mistake the numinous substance of the Dao for falsehood and regard the constant quiescence and luminous awareness as desolation are gravely mistaken!

For the substance of the Dao is originally formless and nameless. In our practice of the Dao, we seek only the root. The Buddhist teaching is the same. Indeed, not only Buddhism and Daoism—even the ancient sages and worthies practiced in this way. Yet because those of middling and lesser capacity are many and cannot all be taught the supreme Dao, the teachings specifically point to daily conduct, providing guidance to follow.

All you learners, if you can embody this principle, investigate the root, and the branches will naturally be attained; understand the substance, and you will naturally reach its function. Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—all are united as one!

**Chapter Eight: Cultivating Virtue and Concentrating the Dao**

Those who study the Dao must cultivate virtue! For the Dao is the encompassing whole, while virtue has myriad expressions. It is like the four seasons: sprouting, growing, harvesting, and storing—each distinct, yet the Dao is a single, undifferentiated principle that runs through them, governing creation. Thus heaven and earth take the generation of beings as their heart, and the nurturing of the myriad things is heaven’s benevolence! Buddhas, immortals, sages, and worthies, in their boundless compassion, strive to ensure that every man and woman finds their proper place, universally benefiting all beings—this is nothing other than the virtue of benevolence!

Yet is the compassion of Buddhas and immortals different from the Confucian sense of commiseration? To desire for others what one desires for oneself, to share in their hunger and drowning, to vow to deliver all beings, to universally bestow the milk of the Dharma—is this not the same? The rites of seniority and precedence, order and sequence—are these not also observed in the fruitions of Buddhas and immortals, determined by their merit? The gradual and sudden teachings of the Great and Lesser Vehicles, the three thousand majestic observances, the eighty thousand subtle practices—are these not rites?

Where righteousness prevails, appropriateness and balance are key. Unyielding strength, sacrificing life for righteousness—Buddhas and immortals endure humiliation with steadfast resolve, and this too is righteousness. The virtue of wisdom governs withdrawal and concealment. Only by concealing can one be subtle and unfathomable! The wisdom of Buddhas and immortals is profound and far-reaching—this is called great wisdom, and thus none can comprehend it.

From these four virtues—benevolence, propriety, righteousness, and wisdom—arise the myriad practices, the boundless deliverance of beings, and the expedient means of joyful giving. They manifest as:
- **Benevolence**: revering teachers and the Dao, befriending good spiritual companions;
- **Propriety**: enduring humiliation without anger, maintaining purity and self-discipline;
- **Righteousness**: relinquishing attachments to study the Dao, liberating oneself from the cycle of birth and death;
- **Wisdom**: deeply understanding cause and effect, not deluded by past conditions, embracing the center and holding to oneness, unwavering in resolve, practicing earnestly to realize true attainment;
- **Trustworthiness**: thus heaven’s virtue is trustworthiness, running through the four seasons, and the qi of the four seasons, through trustworthiness, returns to its ultimate state.

Confucius said: *"A person without trustworthiness cannot stand."* For what is most valued in humans is trustworthiness. Since ancient times, the great sages and Buddhas have embodied all virtues before attaining the supreme fruit. Among the myriad virtues, **benevolence** stands foremost. Without first arousing compassion, merely seeking self-liberation is of no benefit to the world. Yet what is called "compassion" is not the indulgent, weak love of women and children.

For one must embody heaven’s heart and enact one’s own virtue—compassion then becomes true compassion, renunciation true renunciation. Grieving another’s suffering as if one endured it oneself; rejoicing in another’s goodness as if one possessed it oneself. The **"Four Immeasurable Minds"** must be practiced in truth, without seeking reward, without regret or retreat. The superior person, possessing all virtues, lives as an upright being and dies as an enlightened spirit; the diligent lesser practitioner secures the human form. Yet if even one virtue remains unculitvated, no evil will be left undone, and the three wretched destinies will stretch endlessly without hope of escape or deliverance.

Thus, cultivating virtue is the gateway to entering the Dao and the essential key to attaining perfection. From ancient times, no buddha, immortal, sage, or worthy has ever condensed the Dao without first cultivating virtue. Though the practices of virtue are many and its names vast, the Dao is but one principle—within its unity lie ten thousand distinctions; though virtues branch in myriad directions, within their differentiation they share a single root. Let all cultivate together—my words are no idle claim!

**Chapter Nine: The Sincere Practice of Heavenly Ethics**

Since the Dao cannot condense without virtue, and no virtue takes precedence over filial piety and fraternal duty, the Four Books of the Confucian sages establish these as their foundation. Even the governance of Yao and Shun achieved harmony only after the proper ordering of human relationships, and the efficacy of filial piety and fraternal duty reached its pinnacle therein!

Yet people differ in status—some noble, some base, some wealthy, some poor—but all must fulfill their duties according to their station as children. If, within the household, in matters of food and daily life, one knows only to provide sustenance but not love, or loves but does not revere, this cannot be called filial piety!

When King Wen was a crown prince, he paid daily homage to his father, King Ji, thrice inquiring of his attendants: "Is he well?" Hearing of his father’s well-being brought him joy; hearing otherwise filled him with dread, and he dared not rest at ease. Such was his love for his parents, arising from his innate nature—no one could surpass this single act! It is recorded in *The Book of Rites* and may be verified.

Yet today, when parents fall ill, many fail to attend them with utmost sincerity, to exhaust all efforts in medicine and care—how much less in other matters! The Sage Confucius composed the *Classic of Filial Piety* to elucidate the supreme virtue and essential Dao of the ancient kings, proclaiming its success before the Northern Dipper to instruct later generations. Scholars of this age study it from childhood, yet though they recite it, they do not practice it; though they expound upon it, they do not enact it. If this text, meant to transform the world and educate the people, is treated merely as words to be read and passed over, what benefit does it bring?

Moreover, the Way of filial piety is not confined to Confucian texts—even Buddhas and immortals speak of it earnestly. There has never been one who was unfilial to their parents yet attained the Dao and achieved perfection; nor has there been one who studied to become a Buddha or immortal yet neglected their parents.

The ignorant of this world, failing to examine the truth, falsely slander Buddhism and Daoism, claiming they abandon parents and sever love, cutting off ancestral sacrifices, and thus deeming them unfilial! They do not realize that since ancient times, Buddhas and immortals, having transcended worldly ties and realized truth, have liberated nine generations of ancestors—how could this apply only to their parents? The ancients regarded guiding one’s parents toward goodness as the greatest filial piety, and there is good reason for this.

The Sage Confucius praised Shun’s filial piety, declaring first: *"His virtue made him a sage."* For when a child possesses sagely virtue, his father is called a sagely father and his mother a sagely mother—what greater filial piety could there be? Yet later Confucians—are they sages or not?

Some fools of this world, whether relying on talent and learning or boasting of wealth and rank, display arrogance and disrespect before their own parents. Do they not realize that their talent, learning, wealth, and rank all derive from their ancestors and parents, accumulated through the practice of goodness? Failing to reflect on repaying their roots, they instead grow careless and contemptuous—how can the sin of unfiliality be evaded?

From ancient times, the sages’ utmost filial virtue was pure, sincere, and steadfast, perceiving what is formless and listening to what is soundless. Thus, they could move heaven and earth, stir wind and thunder, offer fragrant incense, and ascend the sacrificial altar. No greater manifestation of filial virtue exists than this!

As for monks and Daoists who leave their families, they too should reflect: their parents gave them life and reared them with boundless kindness, yet they cannot repay this debt; they cannot even provide the simplest sustenance. Therefore, they must steel their resolve, cultivate diligently, and seek to realize the Dao’s fruit, thereby repaying their roots. Only then may their parents’ wishes be fulfilled.

When it comes to teachers and elders, one should revere and obey them as one would one’s parents, for as heirs of the Dharma, they carry forward the lineage—this must not be neglected.

As for the ignorant, in their dealings with parents, they merely provide sustenance in life, mourn in death, and offer sincere sacrifices. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Rise early and retire late, do not disgrace those who gave you life."* This is the meaning.

If one’s family is prosperous, how could fine delicacies be spurned? If one’s family is poor, coarse fare should not be disdained. What matters is the sincerity of love and reverence—how can abundance or frugality make a difference?

As for Confucians, having studied the classics, they must understand the duty of filial piety! If they heed the admonition of *"cherishing the days"* yet neglect their parents in life, or recite the *"Blue Water Plants"* yet forget them in death, then even if they offer sumptuous sacrifices, it is but empty ritual; if they mourn at a hut by the grave, it is mere deception. Can heaven deem this filial?

As for siblings, they share the same qi and are like connected branches. The ancients compared them to hands and feet. The *Book of Songs* says: *"Though there are others, none are like those born of the same father."* How can the bond of fraternal love not be strengthened?

Moreover, a parent’s love for their children is unchanging—whether the child is worthy or unworthy, the love remains the same. Though siblings may differ in wealth, rank, or status, how can one’s love for them be diminished?

Thus, the story of sharing a blanket in winter has been admired through the ages, while the tale of boiling beans to harm a brother has been lamented by the wise. How can one not be cautious!

Even among monks and Daoists, there exists a fraternal bond. The younger should be treated with kindness and love, the elder with humility and harmony. Only by fulfilling this mutual respect can one benefit from virtuous companions.

If one relies solely on pride and harms one’s peers, one betrays the kindness of parents who gave life and loses the virtue of teachers’ and friends’ instruction. To be mocked by Confucian scholars—what greater fault could there be?

All beings! Embrace filial piety and fraternal duty, and practice them with diligence. With the root thus established, advancing in virtue and cultivating the truth will no longer be difficult.

**Chapter Ten: Exhausting Loyalty and Devotion**

Man is endowed with the finest essence of the Five Phases—without parents, how could he be born? Without a lord, how could he achieve? Yet the bond with parents is formed by Heaven, while the bond with a lord is formed by man. That which is formed by Heaven takes root in nature; that which is formed by man is based in righteousness. These two debts are equally weighty, with no distinction between them.

However, a child who understands the toil of parents will still think of repaying their origin, while a minister who serves the lord with unwavering devotion is rarely encountered. Do they not know that every salary and stipend is a gift from the lord? Every morsel of food and drink is an act of the lord’s grace. Above, it brings honor to ancestors; below, it shelters descendants. To fail in repayment and neglect the duties of a minister—how can one find peace?

As for the treacherous and deceitful, who usurp the lord’s authority and favor to expand their private influence, or who flatter and fawn to secure their position—heedless of the Dao of Heaven, unmindful of public opinion—they do not strive to fulfill their loyalty but only seek momentary glory. Yet in the end, they are pointed out by the entire court, and public judgment cannot tolerate them. Once their reputation is ruined and their person destroyed, disaster follows swiftly—how could regret avail then?

Thus, those who hold the position of tutor or mentor must, above, correct the lord’s faults and diligently fulfill their duty of assisting and admonishing; below, they must make the advancement of the worthy their task and harbor no envy or jealousy. Those who administer justice should uphold the law with fairness and equity, tempering severity with compassion to value the people’s lives. Those who oversee education must strive to transform customs and guide the people toward goodness through clear instruction. Those with official duties should attend to their tasks before receiving their emoluments, offering loyalty according to their station. Those who serve as inspectors should inquire into governance and tour the regions, observing and assessing with care. Those who hold positions in remonstrance must think of offering admonitions through humble means to stabilize the court’s order, presenting counsel and alternatives to strengthen the nation’s pulse.

When the lord has virtue, they should follow and enhance it; when the lord has faults, they should correct and remedy them. Better to be a loyal minister who speaks frankly than to indulge in obsequious flattery! If entrusted with border governance, they should rectify themselves and lead their subordinates, neither oppressing the people with harshness nor acting obstinately to ruin affairs, nor deviating from the Way to seek fame. If stationed in a military command, they should think of securing the borders, pacifying the state, and ensuring tranquility—consuming the lord’s salary while faithfully serving the lord’s affairs. Even if governing a single prefecture, overseeing a single province, or administering a single county, each should devote their heart and fulfill their duty.

They must not regard the people’s affairs as negligible, nor the people’s lives as insignificant. They must not curry favor with superiors to seek approval, nor indulge in greed and bribery to plunder the people’s livelihood. They should embody the lord’s heart, uphold the lord’s commands, extend the lord’s benevolence, and bestow the lord’s grace upon the land. Such are the model officials!

Thus, from ancient times, loyal and steadfast ministers have sacrificed themselves to uphold humanity, unwavering even in the face of peril. Their loyalty pierces the sun and moon; their righteous qi permeates Heaven and Earth. Their names are inscribed in history, and they are venerated for a thousand autumns.

As for scholars and commoners, though they may not receive official ranks from the court, the establishment of offices, the division of duties, and the promulgation of laws and regulations—ensuring that bandits cause no alarm and the people live in peace—are all the lord’s grace. Moreover, when accumulated debts are remitted, famine is relieved, the elderly are provided for, and the filial and chaste are honored—how can one not be mindful of this?

When the state levies regular taxes, they should pay them promptly; when the state undertakes projects, they should hasten to comply without delay. This, too, is a form of loyalty.

For loyalty and filial piety are the two fundamental principles in Heaven and Earth! Those who cultivate the Dao must endure kalpas of ascetic practice before attaining realization and fruition. Yet those of great loyalty and great filial piety, in a single flash of life’s light, ascend to Heaven! Even in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, those of the highest grade of rebirth are mostly the loyal and filial. Thus, the loyal and filial are honored by the court, recorded in historical annals, protected by the Dao of Heaven, and revered by spirits and gods.

In contrast, the disloyal and unfilial face public execution, suffer retribution from ghosts in the unseen realm, endure eternal ridicule, and sink forever into evil destinies—how vast is the difference! Therefore, plagues, warfare, floods, droughts, and famines are all brought about by disloyalty and unfiliality.

O all you learners! If you aspire to resolutely cultivate the Dao but do not honor the Way of the child and the minister, vainly hoping to attain realization—it is impossible!

The Heavenly Worthy having expounded these ten chapters, all the perfected immortals and true lords leapt for joy as one, praising and extolling with a single voice, chanting in verse:

O majestic, peerless Worthy,
Who saves the kalpa with boundless kindness,
Proclaiming the subtle and wondrous Dharma,
Revealing in full the true mystery of the Great Ultimate—
The principle of the One Origin,
The esoteric scriptures of the Three Vehicles,
Each word utterly lucid,
Each character profoundly deep.

The Great Dao is fundamentally ordinary,
Yet first the roots of karma must be purified;
Revere Heaven to manifest responsive grace,
Cultivate human relations and walk in truth.
By practicing good, one ascends to Heaven;
By doing evil, one sinks into perdition.
Human norms and the laws of things,
The Five Classics and the Three Books—
All converge in true realization,
Ascending as sages through the gate of mystery.
All beings possess Buddha-nature,
Their own nature holds numinous clarity.

May we board the great Dharma-vessel,
And not betray the sagely heart of compassion.
Wondrous indeed are the words of the Guide—
Through kalpas unnumbered, we shall ever revere and follow.

When the perfected immortals and true lords had finished this hymn, they gathered before the Heavenly Worthy’s seat, bowing their heads in reverence and gratitude. The divine generals and guardian spirits all rejoiced as one, marveling at what they had never before witnessed. Then dragons and cranes soared through the sky, clouds and mist scattered in radiant hues, while banners of jewels and crimson standards led the procession, escorting the phoenix chariot back to the supreme realm. At that time, all the disciples in attendance each bowed in gratitude, receiving the teaching with faith and vowing to put it into practice. Thus, the eulogy concludes.

With compassionate heart, You ferry the world—
O Vast-Dharma Compassionate Worthy,
You expound the Heavenly Dao and reveal human ethics,
Fulfilling nature through constant scriptures.
Loyal to lord and filial to parents,
May this endure through generations as admonition.

*Hymn of Praise to the "Scripture of Samādhi and Union" (Middle Scroll)*

With compassionate vessel, You universally ferry the lost;
With guiding hand, You lead the deluded multitudes.
The essential gate of the *xuan* realm holds decisive secrets,
Cutting through fragmentation to directly point to the original mechanism.
The Dharma-body is true suchness—
In study and practice, let there be no delay.

*Verse for Opening the Scripture*

Where Heaven’s gates open, golden immortals descend;
The phoenix chariot arrives once more at the Dharma-seat.
Within the foremost principle, wondrous truths are proclaimed;
In the profoundest *xuan*, the mysteries of *xuan* are spoken.

The Most High expounds to save kalpas, dispel disasters,
Bestow blessings, resolve calamities, protect destiny,
And verify truth through the wondrous *Scripture of Samādhi and Union*—
*Middle Scroll: Chapter Eleven, "Illuminating Principles and Resolving Doubts"*

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, reverently receiving the Jade Decree,
Had proclaimed the *xuan* texts in ten chapters.
Returning in the phoenix chariot to pay homage at the celestial throne,
He descended once more to the Dharma-seat.

Then the assembled host of immortals and sages—
Some riding azure simurghs, some mounted on numinous cranes—
Thronged the immortal retinue, advancing in ethereal steps,
Scattering jeweled blossoms as celestial music resounded in the sky.
Auspicious clouds wreathed about, and propitious qi suffused the air.

After the Heavenly Worthy had sat in tranquil repose for some time,
The perfected lords of heaven awaited the sound of the Dharma.

Then a perfected immortal from the left wing stepped forth from the ranks and addressed the assembly:
"In former times, the Heavenly Worthy, in the City of Flowers and Stones,
Expounded the precious teachings of loyalty and filial piety,
Citing the deeds of former sages and worthies to illuminate later generations.
Over ten thousand words were spoken in thorough and incisive detail.
Yet today, none recite them, and none follow them in practice.
The raging torrent swells ever higher, while the compassionate raft lies idle.
In my foolish understanding, this seems to offer no benefit to the Dao!"

Thereupon the Heavenly Worthy gave a deep sigh and said: "What words are these! What words are these! In former times, the Most High dwelt on Mount Jingshi and, together with the Five Elder Thearchs, expounded the scriptures of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the Nine Numinous [Treatises on] Long Life—over a million chapters in all. Later, descending in spirit to the capital of Shu, he discoursed at the Jade Bureau, his jade-like writings accumulating in abundance. To this day they circulate without decline. When Śākyamuni the Tathāgata preached the Dharma, his teachings filled the Three Baskets; the teachings were not of one vehicle, nor were the schools of one kind—how could all people be expected to practice them? The Most High has said: ‘My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice. Yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. For the preaching of the Dharma lies with me, while acceptance or rejection lies with others!’ Should I, because of the unevenness of people’s faith and indifference, alter my compassionate heart of salvation? Moreover, loyalty, filial piety, brotherly love, and fraternal duty are rooted in the endowment of nature and are called the constant norms of human relations. Yet the world’s customs daily decline, the true teaching does not flourish, the people do not believe in the Dao, and perverse qi brings calamity, resulting in inauspicious disasters, pestilence, and famine, which follow one upon another. What I now preach is precisely to assist and uphold royal transformation, reverse the course of the kalpa, save and deliver sentient beings, and enlighten the deluded multitude, with the hope that all may awaken and practice in accordance with reality. Furthermore, the heart of Heaven is benevolent and loving, desiring nothing more than that the people return to simplicity and recover their original nature. If all people turn toward goodness, if every family cultivates benevolence and reverence, if the world enjoys pure customs and harmonious qi brings auspiciousness—would this not be a flourishing age? If I were to adhere to the usual conventions of preaching, then the many scriptures I expounded in the past, elucidating their essentials, have already fully expressed their meaning! Consider the vastness of the cosmos: the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—people are not of one kind. How could all learn to become immortals? How could all learn to become buddhas? Thus, in the *Universal Gate Chapter* of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the thirty-two responses adapt the teaching to the roots of beings—there is indeed good reason for this! If there are those with a sincere heart to cultivate the Dao, I myself will expound and guide them, ensuring that they transcend worldly ties and attain the rank of highest perfected."

Thereupon the perfected lords of heaven leapt for joy, all exclaiming, "Excellent!" They fell silent, their minds gathered in profound stillness, awaiting the proclamation.

**Chapter Twelve: On Revering Teachers and Friends**

The Heavenly Worthy, seated in repose upon his jade terrace, addressed the perfected ones, saying: "In the three bonds of human life—beyond ruler and parent—the Way of the teacher is most venerable! Though the duties of subject and child are what people ought to fulfill, the distinction between right and wrong, the division between good and evil, if off by a hair’s breadth, will lead one astray by a thousand miles. One must be cautious in discerning the subtlest signs. Therefore, one must rely on an enlightened teacher to expound the principles of the Dao, to engage in discussion and mutual refinement, so that one’s conduct may be without error, and one may approach pure loyalty and pure filial piety, avoiding the faults of misleading one’s ruler or parents. The ancients, in advancing their virtue and cultivating their work, invariably sought out enlightened teachers as a resource for learning the Dao. Yet teachers and friends differ: there are teachers of vast learning, teachers of surpassing virtue, teachers of eminent reputation, and teachers who transcend the mundane. In former times, the Yellow Thearch studied under Guangcheng, Yao under Yinshou, Shun under Wucheng, King Wen under Yuxiong, the Most High under Rongcheng—even the Sage Confucius inquired about the rites, all had their teachers. The Most High has said: ‘I am not a sage; I am one who has learned and thus knows!’ From ancient times, sages, worthies, buddhas, and immortals have all, without exception, received instruction from teachers before awakening to the Dao. The Book of Documents says: ‘He who can find his own teacher will become a king; he who considers none his equal will perish. He who is fond of asking questions will be enriched; he who relies on himself will be diminished.’ If even emperors and kings are thus, how much more so ordinary people? The Most High has said: ‘He who trusts only in himself is not enlightened; he who considers himself always right will not be illustrious.’ It is because people trust in themselves and consider themselves always right that they become complacent with little and cannot humbly receive others. They do not know that no one is born with knowledge—it comes only through transmission from a teacher. Though the Three Teachings differ, reverence for the teacher is the same. Even in the practices of my own school, if one does not personally receive the oral instructions of a true teacher, then even if one is thoroughly versed in the alchemical texts, how can one truly know the practical work of getting started? Though one may exert the utmost effort, there will certainly be no accomplishment. Thus, in the Buddhist school, relying on a good spiritual friend is considered the joy of the bodhisattva’s practice. Master Zhaozhou traveled on foot for ninety years because the great matter was not yet clear, seeking a true teacher. As for friends, they assist in cultivating goodness. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘Two marshes joined in joy—noble persons use friends to discuss and practice.’ The *Book of Songs* says: ‘The stones of other hills can polish jade.’ When the ancients encountered principles they did not understand or meanings that were unclear, they would advance to inquire of their teachers and withdraw to consult their friends, ensuring that their accumulated doubts melted away like ice, and their cultivated practice flowed smoothly in accord with principle. In former times, the Completest Sage, Master Yan, though he could hear one point and understand ten, owing to his extreme quickness of comprehension, still asked those who could not about what they could not, and asked those with little about what they had little. For in his heart, he truly saw that the principles of the Dao are inexhaustible, and learning has no end, which is why he could inquire with such an empty and receptive mind. The foolish and deluded of later times are often self-satisfied, arrogant, conceited, and proud, unable to humbly receive good advice. Even when a learned elder is before them, they disdain to ask—how much less their friends? Thus, the upright become daily more distant, while the unprincipled become daily more intimate. Evil teachers and harmful friends, flatterers and sycophants, assist in wrongdoing and gather to form a degenerate class. The Way of teacher and friend has decayed—how lamentable! Even I, in former times, if not for the Supreme Yang Sage Teacher transmitting the heart-method, how could I have transcended the mundane and entered the sacred, attaining the rank of highest perfected? All of you, listen quietly: whether cultivating meditation or the Dao, whether aspiring to sagehood or worthiness, if you do not seek enlightened teachers and beneficial friends to sharpen and observe one another, it is like traveling north while heading south—you will only go farther and farther astray, and the Dao will be unattainable."

**Chapter Thirteen: On the Weighty Source of Transformation and Precepts**

Only after heaven and earth exist do the myriad things come to be; only after male and female exist do husband and wife, father and child, ruler and minister arise. Thus, husband and wife stand as the first of the constant human relations, the source of creation and transformation, the beginning of the human Way. When heaven and earth are in harmony, the two qi intermingle in profound union, the myriad things transform and mature, rain and sunshine arrive in due season, and all beings thrive. When husband and wife are in harmony, the man rightly takes his place abroad, the woman rightly takes her place within; one leads, one follows, and only then is the family Way rectified, procreation flourishes—how weighty is this!

Yet the Way of husband and wife bears consequences of the utmost gravity. Whether for the state in its vastness or the neighborhood in its smallness, order and chaos, rise and decline, all find their foundation here. Consider the origins: in the time of Yu, the union began at the Wei and Rui rivers; in the Xia dynasty, it commenced at Mount Tu; the rise of Shang and Zhou saw ruler and consort as one in virtue, rising at cock’s crow in vigilant reverence. When Wei’s lord was pierced by *Zhongfeng*, disorder ensued—there is indeed cause for this.

Since the beginning of heaven and earth, the Way of husband and wife has been esteemed. Yet the human Way originates with husband and wife; without ritual and righteousness to regulate it, it becomes dissolute; if regulation is not fitting, it becomes perverse. Thus, within the inner chambers, behind the bed curtains, one either errs through excessive intimacy or through discord—few attain the mean. The ancients, fearing over-familiarity, cautioned that spouses should treat one another as guests or friends; dreading discord, they likened them to the harmony of zither and lute. The *Book of Songs* praises *Xing Yu*, the *Book of Changes* extols feminine constancy—how can one not take heed?

When the sages composed the *Book of Changes*, the Upper Canon began with *Qian* and *Kun*, the Lower Canon with *Xian* and *Heng*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the one yin and yang; yin and yang are the one husband and wife. Thus, *Qian* is heaven and father, *Kun* is earth and mother. Yin and yang unite in virtue, and hardness and softness take form; one odd, one even—thus transformation arises. From this come the eldest son, middle son, youngest son, eldest daughter, middle daughter, youngest daughter—six children are born. As it is said: solitary yang does not generate, solitary yin does not grow. The Way of opening and closing, yang bestowing and yin receiving, finds its root here.

The Way of *Qian* is that the myriad things draw from it their beginning, for it governs heaven. The Way of *Kun* is that the myriad things draw from it their birth, for it complies with heaven. In the relation of husband and wife, it is likewise as with heaven and earth: the husband, with his firm and strong virtue, governs the wife; the wife, with her yielding and compliant virtue, submits to the husband. One governs, one submits—only then is the family Way accomplished, and sons and daughters born.

The Perfected Lord of the Primordial Beginning said: “One husband and one wife beget one child—their forms may unite; one husband and one wife beget many children—their forms may divide. In this mechanism of union and division lies the wondrous mystery of heaven and earth’s ceaseless generation and transformation, secretly enfolded within.”

Even in the gate of refinement, where lead and mercury are cultivated, water and fire ascend and descend, the analogy of husband and wife is drawn—only through the union of yin and yang can the sacred embryo be formed. Even in the Buddhist school, where form and emptiness are both forgotten, there is still the “wife of dharma-joy.” For all methods that assist the Way serve to inwardly strengthen body and mind, enabling one to become a sage or worthy, to perpetuate the Buddha-seed—just as the wife manages the inner affairs and assists the husband in establishing the household.

Thus, the *Book of Songs* begins with *Guan Ju*, the *Book of Documents* speaks of *Li Jiang*, the *Book of Rites* esteems the grand wedding, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* takes care in receiving the bride. The relation of husband and wife is no trivial matter.

If people can harmonize in marriage, the husband instructs his wife, the wife encourages her husband; they mutually urge one another toward goodness, learning the harmony of zither and lute, avoiding the resentment of *Gu Feng*, seeking together the joy of *Ju An*, and shunning the reproach of *Shuo Yin* and *Tuo Fu*. Then harmony among brothers, filial piety toward parents—all arise from this. But if a husband does not harmonize with his wife, if a wife does not respect her husband, then the qi of discord gathers in the household, utterly losing the proper source of transformation. How then can one hope for worthy descendants? How can one be filial to parents or fraternal to siblings?

As for those who indulge in the bedchamber, favor wife and children, and forget their parents—this is truly a corruption of virtue, abhorred by heaven and earth, detested by ghosts and spirits. Is this the meaning of leading and following?

**Chapter Fourteen: Preserving the True Origin**

The ancients established schools and academies to clarify human relationships, which are the principles of daily conduct. These principles are inherently present in human nature, neither extraordinary nor difficult to practice. Yet people regard them as commonplace and fail to earnestly put them into action. They do not realize that the great sages and worthies all advanced to their utmost heights by sincerely embodying the cardinal relationships and moral principles. Even in our tradition, it is said: *"To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the human Dao. If the human Dao is not cultivated, the Dao of immortality remains distant!"*

While the cardinal relationships and moral principles are indeed what people ought to fulfill, if one does not know how to cherish essence and nurture spirit to preserve the body, there will be no means to ward off illness and prolong life—this is not the Way of nurturing life. The *Most High* said: *"Seal your openings, close your gates, and you will not toil for a lifetime. Open your openings, indulge your affairs, and you will be beyond salvation."* Thus, one must be cautious in daily life and moderate desires. During extreme cold or scorching heat, violent thunder, fierce winds, sudden rains, or overcast skies; before the waxing moon, after the waning moon, at the dark and new moons; or when the seasons are unseasonable—one should avoid and abstain, safeguarding the body. Do not indulge desires to the point of losing essence, do not vent anger to the point of depleting qi, and do not overindulge in drink to the point of harming the spirit.

*Zi Yu* said: *"Guarding the body is the foundation of guarding."* The human body consists solely of essence, qi, and spirit. Essence and qi are water and fire, also called lead and mercury. Fire’s nature tends to flare upward, so it must be restrained to prevent dryness. Water’s nature tends to flow downward, so it must be guarded to prevent leakage. The *Scripture of the Elixir* says: *"Following the natural course makes one human; reversing it makes one immortal."* Water naturally flows downward, so reverse it to make it ascend. Fire naturally flames upward, so lower it to make it descend. Through this ascent and descent, yin and yang are inverted, achieving the state of *Completion*. Yet without tranquility, allowing things to unfold naturally without forced effort, this is not easily attained.

The *Immortal Guang Cheng* said: *"Be still, be pure; do not labor your form, do not agitate your essence—only then can you attain longevity."* Guard your inner self, close yourself to external distractions, for excessive knowledge leads to ruin. If inner visions do not arise, the mind does not stray outward, and spirit is stored within. If external distractions do not intrude, pathogenic qi cannot invade, spirit and essence remain intact, the hundred bones are harmonized, and one can nurture life and prolong years.

The *Most High* said: *"Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires—this is the essence of nurturing life."* As for excessive knowledge, though different from external temptations, it still disturbs the mind and depletes spirit and qi. Moreover, craving excessive knowledge precludes the practice of restraint, and the more one knows, the further one strays from the Dao. Thus, the *Sage Confucius* did not value extensive learning but warned against the distractions of companions. The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* states: *"The Dharma cannot be seen, heard, perceived, or known. If one seeks it through seeing, hearing, perceiving, or knowing, it is not the true seeking of the Dharma!"*

Therefore, those who skillfully nurture life do not leak inner awareness through the six senses nor become entangled in external phenomena. Abiding in profound clarity, they do not let worries, fears, afflictions, or delusions bind their minds. They guard their true origin within, ever fearful of its loss. The human body is like a tree: if it is rotten within, a single violent wind will break it. Thus, those who do not nurture life properly fear cold in winter and heat in summer. Water does not ascend, fire does not descend, so they cannot resist cold and heat, nor harmonize water and fire. How can one not delve deeply into the Way of nurturing life?

To nurture life, one must practice reversal, making water ascend and fire descend, so that the medicine blooms atop the mountain and the sun glows beneath the sea. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: *"Guard firmly the true within the true; in emptiness and tranquility, spirit comes of itself. Urgently guard the chamber of essence, do not leak it recklessly—closing and preserving it, you may live long."* How profound these words are! If one can guard the body with care while living in the world, illness can be warded off, years can be prolonged, and longevity may be attained.

**Chapter Fifteen: Cultivating Good Conduct**

In this world, one who knows how to guard the true origin within to nurture the body is like a steadfast tree, its true essence contained within, its root and trunk firmly established. Yet even with deep roots to strengthen the inner self, it is still vital that branches and leaves flourish externally to receive the nourishment of rain and dew. The human body is the same: though one knows how to guard essence and qi within, without vigorously cultivating good conduct to accumulate virtue externally, it is like a tree without branches—though alive, it cannot flourish. How then can it receive the nourishment of rain and dew?

The tradition says: *"To cultivate virtue, nothing surpasses nurturing."* "Cultivate" means to plant, and "nurturing" means deep cultivation. Thus, virtue should be planted and even more so nurtured. Virtue takes myriad forms, but prioritizing benefit to others and all beings comes first. In daily life, if one delights in righteousness and takes joy in giving, when others are in distress, one aids them with a compassionate heart. When one hears of another’s misfortune, one helps them with whatever means available. Where one’s strength permits, one assists them with flexibility. Where one’s strength falls short, one devises ways to help. When one sees others confused in principle or hindered in affairs, one gently guides them. One encourages the good and firmly dissuades the unvirtuous. In every thought, one acts for others; at all times, one seeks to be of benefit.

The *Most High* said: *"The wealthy give to others with wealth; the benevolent give to others with words."* Giving wealth is certainly a way to aid others, but giving words is a form of Dharma offering, rich in benefit and accessible to all. The reason people fail to do this lies in their attachment to the distinction between self and others, stubbornly clinging to it. Have they not read the words of the *Western Inscription*: *"The people are my siblings; all things are my companions"*? If one can realize that all people and things are one’s siblings and companions, then all things are one body—what good cannot be cultivated?

What virtue cannot be cultivated? The *Book of Changes* states: *"The noble person follows virtue, accumulating the small to reach the great."* Thus, the aspirations of the ancient sages—where the old find peace and the young are cherished—truly possess a capacity as vast as Heaven. Since antiquity, buddhas and immortals have regarded all beings as their own children. The Buddhist teaching says: *"All creatures, whether moving or still, possessing consciousness, are things within my own nature."* If one can embody the hearts of buddhas, immortals, sages, and worthies, and act to uphold goodness, even if one may not yet equal the sages and worthies, this heart becomes the foundation for becoming a sage or worthy. Even if one may not yet equal buddhas and immortals, one is already no different from them!

As for maintaining a heart that delights in goodness, how can one in ordinary times be entirely without fault? Yet knowing one has faults, one should swiftly correct them. The *Book of Changes* says: *"Returning from not far away, without great regret, is most auspicious."* Correcting one fault brings forth one good. As the saying goes: *"The person who practices goodness is like the grass in a spring garden—its growth is unseen, yet it increases daily."* For goodness is inherent in human nature, and its practice lies within oneself. One must only be earnest and sincere, neither chasing fame nor seeking reward. The *Most High* said: *"Supreme virtue is like a valley. Abundant virtue seems insufficient. Dwelling in depth, not in shallowness; dwelling in substance, not in ornament."* The *Book of Changes* states: *"The noble person thickens virtue to bear all things."*

The sages and worthies of old established themselves and thereby established others; they achieved understanding and thereby helped others achieve it. Buddhas and immortals, in attaining liberation themselves, also liberated others—just as Yangzi’s doctrine of self-interest was refuted by Mencius. Yet later Confucians, failing to examine closely, rashly slandered our Dao as the learning of Yang and Mo, unaware that our Dao is vast in compassion, liberating all without exception—only those who do not believe are difficult to liberate! How could Yangzi’s inability to benefit others compare to our Dao?

Moreover, those who cultivate the Dao must first plant virtue. Thus, the *Alchemical Classics* say: *"Without accumulating virtue and merit, one will encounter demonic obstructions at every turn."* If one practices goodness, the Way of Heaven will surely protect them, and the gods and spirits will look upon them with favor. The *Book of Documents* states: *"Doing good brings down a hundred blessings. If one does good yet receives no reward, their goodness must be impure."* Truly, there has never been a person who genuinely delights in goodness and does not receive reward. When good deeds are practiced long enough, blessings flow to descendants, and grace extends to later generations. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Receiving a hundred blessings from Heaven, great fortune descends upon you."*

If one inwardly preserves the true origin and outwardly upholds good conduct, remaining unwavering throughout life, yet fails to attain the Dao, such a thing does not exist.

**Chapter Sixteen: Strictly Distinguishing the True Confucian**

If there are beings who devote themselves exclusively to Confucian learning and do not pursue other paths, they should, as previously described, inwardly guard their body and mind while outwardly upholding virtuous conduct, first investigating the root. They must exhaustively study the principles of Heaven, humanity, nature, and destiny; and wholeheartedly explore the depths of benevolence, righteousness, the Dao, and virtue. They should cautiously guard the perilous human heart, preventing it from becoming unrestrained, and constantly awaken the subtle heart of the Dao, deeply nurturing it. They must ward off evil to eliminate wrongdoing and uphold reverence to establish sincerity. They should be loyal in self-discipline and practice reciprocity in treating others.

In advancing virtue, they emulate the *Inscription of Tang*, daily renewing and further renewing themselves. In cultivating learning, they follow the *Counsels of Gao Yao*, yielding in aspiration and diligent in practice. They cultivate themselves with humility and receive others with emptiness. Since learning and inquiry have no end, they must not rely on talent to be arrogant toward others. In examining themselves, they should always fear falling short and never gloss over faults with excuses.

They should constantly reflect on the limited scope of their vision, lest they bring shame to their bedclothes and shadow. Those who accumulate depth naturally radiate brilliance; the key lies in maintaining modesty, like Yanzi, who seemed as if he had nothing, truly empty. Those who begin near naturally see far; the key lies in living with restraint, remembering Zengzi’s poverty without sorrow and wealth without arrogance. They immerse themselves in the treasury of the Six Classics, thoroughly studying the Four Books. They read the books of sages, embody the hearts of sages, practice the deeds of sages, and become sages themselves.

They regard the joy of Yi Yin and Yao-Shun as something they must learn, and Mencius’ aspiration to follow Confucius as something they must emulate. This is truly the fundamental duty of a Confucian.

The character *ru* (儒) is composed of *ren* (人, person) and *xu* (需, need), signifying that above, it connects to the transmission of the learning of the ancient sages, and below, it enlightens later generations to inherit and carry forward the lineage. It is something the world truly needs.

As for history and other texts, they can enrich one’s knowledge, broaden one’s perspective, expand one’s thoughts, and enhance one’s talents and understanding. One should also extensively gather and select from them, discarding the dross and keeping the essence. If in doubt, set it aside; if certain, retain it. The ancients, though dwelling in a single room, could know the vastness of the world and the successes and failures of a thousand years—this was due to books.

However, Yangzi’s writings often contain dangerous and eccentric ideas. Xunzi’s theory of inherent evil already obscures the root! Only his chapters on governing the state have some value. The histories of the Six Dynasties often distort right and wrong according to the sages, yet one can still learn about the order and chaos of the world from them—this is also something Confucians should study carefully.

As for florid and seductive words, or books that do not benefit the body and mind, they are mere playthings that lead to the loss of aspiration—something the ancients warned against. One must be cautious!

The name *ru* (Confucian) does not merely refer to wearing the cap and robes of a Confucian. Even if one appears to be a Confucian, one must earnestly practice Confucian conduct and establish Confucian character. One should strive to be a true Confucian, not a false one; a comprehensive Confucian, not a narrow one; a great Confucian, not a petty one. Better to stand firm and guard the Dao of the sages like a fortress than to deviously follow worldly customs, becoming a hypocrite who corrupts virtue.

They should purify their hearts and conceal their depths, aspiring to the sages and worthies. They preserve principle and restrain desire to fully realize their nature and fulfill their destiny. When successful, they practice the Dao, remaining unassuming even in wealth, honor, and glory. When in adversity, they uphold it, unwavering even in secluded valleys and deep gorges.

This is the true scholar’s essential capacity, the very nobility of the literati’s character. In my early years, I too studied the Confucian arts, mastering the classics and histories, before later entering the Dao and attaining the rank of Celestial Immortal. Thus, though the Three Teachings differ in form, their principle is one. And what is that one? The *heart-mind*.

The Most High has said: *"Do not arise distinctions, do not arise attachments."* Mencius declared: *"The Way is one and nothing more!"* The sages of old and those who came after—their standard is the same. Yet vulgar Confucians cling to chapters and verses, failing to investigate the root; they merely grasp at names and appearances, forcing distinctions where none exist. Do they not see that in observing the qi-configuration of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight before they arise, the teaching aligns with the original face of both the Buddhist and Daoist gates? How could there be any difference?

Moreover, the Sage Confucius, founder of the Confucian tradition for all ages, has now attained the rank of Heavenly Emperor, honored even by the Buddha! Yan and Zeng, the Four Companions, hold illustrious ranks in the celestial palace; his three thousand disciples remain forever beyond the cycle of kalpas—is this not proof that to be a Confucian is to plant the seed of Buddhahood and immortality? Is not the true Confucian one with whom Buddhas and Immortals deeply resonate?

Where true Confucians exist in the world, I shall expound and guide them. What division is there between Confucian, Daoist, or Buddhist? *Secret Chapter Seventeen: The Barrier of the Mysterious Pass*

If there are sentient beings who weary of worldly entanglements, their hearts yearning for the *xuan* wind, their resolve set on liberation, desiring to illuminate the Dao of longevity and enduring vision, and to cultivate the work of refinement and return—then they must first recognize the single aperture of the *Xuan* Pass. Only thus can they engage in direct and immediate practice, avoiding the pitfalls of heterodox paths.

Yet this aperture lies hidden within the body, in the midst of emptiness and nothingness, utterly void and wondrous, neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose. Some point to the *Niwan* Palace, others to the navel’s interior, still others to the space between the kidneys—all such scattered teachings are false! Without encountering an enlightened teacher to transmit its truth, how could one ever know it?

The *Dan* classics say:
*"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a true teacher, do not idly guess!"*

For this aperture connects above to the heart and below to the kidney, serving as the essential passage through which the true breath comes and goes. Thus it is called the *Xuan* Pass, or the bellows’ key.

Those who cultivate the elixir gather and congeal the sacred embryo within this *Xuan* Pass. The Most High said:
*"Between heaven and earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
The more it moves, the more it yields."*

Truly, the mechanism of this true breath resembles the bellows of a furnace: once its rhythm is stirred, the meridians, protective *qi*, the hundred vessels, and the nine orifices of the entire body all rely upon it for their egress and return, ascent and descent. In the span of a day and night, it circulates through the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial orbit, its *qi*-mechanism ceaseless, its function inexhaustible.

It is also called the *Xuan-Pin*. The Most High said:
*"The gate of the *Xuan-Pin*,
This is the root of heaven and earth.
Subtly continuous, as if existing,
Its use is never forced."*

Now, *xuan* is yang; *pin* is yin. The *Heart Seal Scripture* says:
*"Exiting *xuan*, entering *pin*."*

For the true *qi* moves within, spiraling left and right, circulating day and night without cease. The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Opening the door is called *qian*,
Closing the door is called *kun*.
One opening, one closing is called change,
Unceasing coming and going is called penetration."*

This breath—one exhalation is an exit, an opening, an ascent, yang; in one exhalation, it connects to the root of heaven, thus called *qian*. One inhalation is an entry, a closing, a descent, yin; in one inhalation, it connects to the root of earth, thus called *kun*. The opening and closing of yin and yang, the transformations they enact—all arise from this single aperture of the *Xuan* Pass.

Subtle indeed! Subtle indeed!

Profound indeed! Wondrous indeed! Those who cultivate immortality must first cultivate this. Yet this single aperture is most empty, most numinous—dwelling at the center of Heaven and Earth, the meeting place of Metal Father and Wood Mother, the realm where Infant Boy and Maiden Girl unite, the locus where the Four Great Elements and Five Phases do not adhere. Here lies the return to the root and restoration of life; here the furnace is settled and the cauldron established—all depend upon this!

For its depth is dark and subtle, it is called *Xuan*; for it is an empty cavity within the void, it is called *Pin*. Though its names are many, its reality is one. If sought with intent, it seems elusive and formless, as though it were not; if sought without intent, the qi mechanism fills and pervades, as though it were not truly absent. Only by stilling the breath, severing the ten thousand conditions, and purifying the dust of thoughts—silently embodying it in neither clinging to existence nor non-existence—can one naturally attain it.

Once this pass is opened, within appears the formless true person, coming and going without cease, transmuting the mortal body into golden elixir. Then the work of laying the foundation and refining the self proceeds in due order, unimpeded. Yet the great principle of the Golden Elixir can only be mastered by those of the highest capacity; those of middling or lesser endowment may not yet be able to practice it.

Still, those who aspire to the Dao and cultivate the real—though their capacities vary in degree—if they remain truly devoted to the Way without wavering from beginning to end, then rank by rank they may transcend the dust and ascend to the real, and method by method they may prolong their years and extend their lives. Long ago, by the waters of Mian, I expounded the methods of cultivation for the Three Immortals of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, each in several dozen clauses. The *Heavenly Immortal* was aligned with the thirty-six celestial cycles, while the *Earthly Immortal* and *Human Immortal* corresponded to the twenty-four qi and the seventy-two seasonal nodes. Alas, those writings remain secretly preserved by the Mian waters and have not been transmitted to the world.

Yet those determined to study the Dao—whether dwelling constantly in temples and monasteries, reciting scriptures, or engaging in devotional practice, their minds free of worldly defilement—are fulfilling their fundamental duty as perfected beings. But those who merely don the yellow cap and feathered robes, blindly unaware of where the great Dao leads, ignorant of the essentials for transcending life and death—I fear that when impermanence arrives swiftly, before the halls of Yama and within the turning wheel of rebirth, no mere semblance of the Dao’s appearance will avail them!

Once the human form is lost, ten thousand kalpas may pass before it is regained. The common folk, ignorant of the great Dao, squander their human birth and blame their ignorance on never having known the path of cultivation. But if, having entered this Way, one fails to single-mindedly strive upward, to cultivate with earnest resolve—drifting carelessly, neglecting this life—it is as though they scorn the Dao itself. Sinking for countless eons, forever losing the human form—is this not cause for grief? Is this not cause for anguish?

All beings gathered here—each must awaken to the rarity of this human birth!

**Chapter Eighteen: Fire Times and Medicinal Substances**

The adept who cultivates the Dao, having grasped the Mysterious Pass, must understand medicinal substances. Now, the production of medicine has its source, and this medicine is none other than the discourse on lead and mercury. Lead is born in the West, the West belonging to *dui* metal, and metal is the mother of water. Mercury is born in the East, the East belonging to *zhen* wood, and wood is the mother of fire. With metal, one summons water; with wood, one summons fire—thus giving rise to *kan* and *li*.

Therefore, the Most High said: *"Know the mother, then know the child; having obtained the child, again guard the mother."* This is the meaning of knowing the source. Gathering is a gathering without gathering, for fire is the gathering. The *Alchemical Canon* states: *"When lead encounters *gui*, it must be swiftly gathered; when gold meets distant vision, it is no longer fit for tasting."*

The entry of medicine involves transformation, and the refinement of medicine involves fire times. Yet fire times are not uniform—they differ in civil and martial, before and after, slow and swift, and the sequential application of effort. The *Alchemical Writings* say: *"The perfected transmit medicine but not fire; since ancient times, few have known fire times."* It is not that they do not know, but that their single-minded movement is internal: at *zi* and *wu*, they withdraw and add. When the fire is fierce, they withdraw; when the fire is cold, they add. This adding and withdrawing is hidden and formless, subtle and imperceptible—unlike firewood and charcoal, tangible things that are easily known.

Now, for the sake of the world, I point out medicinal substances: though there are myriad names such as yellow sprouts, white snow, dragon and tiger, they all reduce to a single mercury and lead. Even mercury and lead are but different names, ultimately reducing to a single water and fire. The images of water and fire are taken from *kan* and *li*. The heart resides in the South as *li*, *li* being fire, wherein the original spirit dwells; the kidneys reside in the North as *kan*, *kan* being water, wherein the original *qi* dwells. True *qi* is transformed from true essence, and true essence is fused by true *qi*. True *qi* is the medicinal substance, and the original spirit’s true fire governs the medicinal substance of original *qi*.

Refining medicine requires a crucible and cauldron, which are also different names—namely, the ground of the Mysterious Pass, the hollow aperture within, which has the form of a furnace. Within the formless, there is form; within this state of seeming form and formlessness, the ascent and descent of water and fire is called "cooking and refining."

The Most High said: *"Nurture the formless, and form endures; guard the bodiless, and the body preserves its truth. Preserving truth in mutual embrace, one may endure long."* This is the great essential of fire times.

With spirit, move *qi*; with *qi*, guide essence. Silently follow the movement, body and mind at peace, attaining emptiness and guarding stillness, serene and without action. In moving *qi*, breath by breath return to the root—neither forgetting nor forcing. In applying effort, one wholly employs reverse cultivation, causing the original spirit to guard within and essence and *qi* to congeal. Refine essence into *qi*, refine *qi* into spirit, refine spirit to return to emptiness—emptiness and spontaneity—thus the sacred embryo is formed. Thereafter, nurture and nurse it, wholly employing stillness and silent protection.

Before the embryo is formed, one constantly uses martial fire to retreat the yin tally. Once the yin tally is fully retreated and the body of pure, unyielding yang is revealed, only civil fire is used to warmly nurture and securely preserve it, allowing it to rest peacefully within. Martial fire is like warfare; once the sacred embryo is formed, it is as if the world is at peace—only then should one lay down arms and cultivate civility. Where is there need for martial affairs?

The Most High said: *"Fine weapons are instruments of ill omen; when there is no choice but to use them, tranquility is supreme."* At this stage of practice, one should only guard tranquility, strictly avoiding forced growth. With long and thorough familiarity, when the time comes for the infant’s nurturing, it will naturally shed its embryo and undergo spiritual transformation, freely and unfettered. Abiding in a single chamber, one may roam the vastness of the four seas and nine continents; dwelling within the dusty world, one may ascend to the celestial rivers and boundless void.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"Excellence lies within, yet flows through the four limbs, manifesting in deeds—this is the height of excellence."* Mencius said: *"Radiance appears on the face, overflows the back, and extends to the four limbs, which need no words to be understood."* For when the returned elixir is attained, one reverts from old age to youth—this is no empty scene. As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: *"After expounding the scripture ten times, withered bones revive."* All this arises from such cultivation.

If one enters the Dao in middle age, the external medicine is already lost, and one must employ methods to extend life and replenish what later heaven lacks. Yet though true practice exists, if the prior heaven is incomplete, the sacred embryo will be difficult to form. If one’s will and resolve are firm, guarding spirit and *qi*, practicing breath regulation without ceasing day or night, even if one cannot achieve the shedding of the embryo, spiritual transformation, or transcendence into sagehood, the foundational work of refining the self will yield tangible results—one may abide in the world for long years, differing from the common stream.

The root of one’s being should, kalpa after kalpa, remain within the gate of cultivation, and the good causes and Dao conditions will not have been in vain. This is what is meant by "planting the seed early." If one desires long life, one must urgently begin cultivation and reflection early—lest in old age, regret comes too late!

**Chapter Nineteen: The Chan School’s Upward Path**

Once, when Śākyamuni Buddha expounded the Dharma, Mahākāśyapa and Śāriputra—both deeply versed in the study of longevity, well-versed in alchemical texts—each led their disciples to take refuge. Later, both received predictions of buddhahood. Divine Light turned to Dharma study and took refuge in Bodhidharma. The Fifth Patriarch of Huangmei was in a former life the Pine-Planting Daoist; Tánluán burned his immortal scriptures to cultivate the Pure Land. These are cases of entering Buddhism from the Dao. Master Xu the Perfected, in a past kalpa, was a śramaṇa under the Buddha Dīpaṃkara; later, under the tutelage of the Mother of Pǔshī Chén, he received the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir and ascended with his entire household. Lǐ Chángzhēn was initially a monk, blindly cultivating emptiness, but after receiving my guidance, he attained the realization of a celestial immortal. These are cases of entering the Dao from Buddhism. Dānxiá abandoned his official career to study Buddhism and later attained awakening. This is a case of entering Buddhism from Confucianism. Even I myself once studied Confucian learning, but after encountering the Sagely Master of Zhèngyáng, I received the profound and wondrous transmission—this is a case of entering the Dao from Confucianism.

From this, we see that the cultivation of buddhahood and immortality is not fixed from the outset; whether one studies the Dao or Buddhism depends entirely on the individual. If one’s vow is directed there, one engages in ascetic practice there; if one’s vow is directed here, one diligently cultivates here. Thus, those who devote themselves to Confucian learning should, as previously stated, strive to become sages and worthies. Beyond sages and worthies, there is nothing else to learn. If one cultivates the Dao of immortality, one should delve deeply into the work of returning and restoration, as well as the gate of recitation and upholding, seeking liberation from worldly entanglements. One should reflect: to be called a "Perfected One" is to fully embody this singular, non-dual truth, neither perishing nor arising. If even a trace of self-interest intrudes, it is not true perfection. What Heaven bestows upon us is originally complete; if even a hair’s breadth remains unfulfilled, it does not accord with the principle of fully receiving and fully returning. How can the term "Perfected One" be lightly claimed?

If there are beings who aspire to the Chan School, delight in the Buddha’s teachings, renounce love and leave the household life, they should cast aside worldly entanglements, resolutely seek the upward path, and, regarding the great essentials transmitted from the West, stake their lives in a single-minded effort to advance. If one can delve into the treasury of scriptures, exhaustively study their profound meanings, explore them day and night, and where understanding remains unclear, seek out a good spiritual friend for guidance and enlightenment—never presuming to rely on one’s own conjectures—then one may progress. In the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* "Entry into the Realm of Reality," Good Wealth visited fifty-three great spiritual friends, ultimately standing shoulder to shoulder with all buddhas—such was the magnitude of his vow!

Yet those who dwell within the abbot’s quarters or sit in the meditation hall, yet fail to dissolve the dust of the world or sever worldly ties, who remain unclear about their original true mind and mistakenly take the conditioned mind as their true mind—such a one spends their entire life groping through clouds and mist, striving to glimpse the clear, bright sky. How could it be possible?

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "When the mind arises, the myriad dharmas arise; when the mind ceases, the myriad dharmas cease." The conditioned mind arises in dependence on past sensory objects; it is born and perishes, and thus is a deluded mind. The deluded mind is illusory and without origin, while the true mind abides constantly, unmoving. In this degenerate age, many Chan practitioners fail to recognize the true mind. They follow their nature as it arises, taking the mind that responds to circumstances and engages with things as their original true mind, unaware of the need for vigorous cultivation. If one is willing, in the four dignified postures of walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, to examine this conditioned mind—where does its arising come from? Where does its cessation go?—and within the realm of birth and death, seek the unborn and deathless true mind, then one day, shattering the gate of delusion and perceiving the root source, one will know that illusion is immediately left behind. Without relying on expedient means, leaving illusion is awakening—there is no gradual progression. This resembles the Confucian practice of "restoring the self." For when one has mastered the self, one restores propriety; knowing how to leave illusion, one awakens to truth. There is no difference.

Yet to leave illusion and awaken to truth, one must rely on the work of precepts and samādhi. If one does not strictly uphold the precepts, the mind will be scattered and chaotic, pulled by circumstances, and unable to attain deep samādhi. By entering samādhi through precepts, the mind does not move recklessly; over time, as it gathers and restrains, becoming pure and unified, the true and constant mind naturally manifests. Thus, I have often said: "The true and constant must respond to things; in responding to things, one must not be deluded." This is precisely what I mean. Even in the Confucian tradition, Master Yán’s practice of the "four restraints" is a matter of upholding the precepts for body and mind—there is no difference.

If one can firmly uphold the precepts, reverently follow the Buddha’s words, seek self-liberation, and only then turn to the upward mechanism, can one make progress. If one does not rely on the precepts, or receives them but fails to uphold them, then even clarity of mind is unattainable—how can wisdom arise? The non-dual Dharma gate will not be thoroughly penetrated. Those with the aspiration to engage in Chan must exert themselves to the utmost in awakening.

**Chapter Twenty: Admonitions to Chan Practitioners**

To seek buddhahood, one must understand buddha-nature. This buddha-nature is received at the beginning of life; all people inherently possess it, and it is no different in sages and ordinary beings. Whether called the "Great Vehicle" or the "Supreme Vehicle," it refers to this nature. The nature itself is not dual, but the practices differ—this difference arises from the inequality of roots. Yet the inequality of roots stems from the clarity or turbidity of one’s qi-endowment. Thus, those of superior roots, upon hearing the teaching once, immediately understand and begin cultivation, and their practice and study come easily. Those of middling and inferior roots, compared to superior roots, find it harder to understand upon hearing, yet through arduous effort, they can eventually awaken—though it is more difficult than for those of superior roots.

While the three roots are indeed distinct, the work of cultivation also varies. Thus, in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra’s* stages of perfect penetration, there are over twenty different entry points. Even in the *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment’s* three contemplations, each contemplation has variations: single practice, dual practice, sequential practice, simultaneous practice, and so on.

The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s ten abodes, ten faiths, ten dedications, and the forty-one stages of mind likewise vary in depth and progression, each differing from the others. This is why one must delve deeply into sūtras and treatises and meticulously investigate their subtleties.

Though the Buddha rebuked excessive learning as inferior to cultivating the untainted, he also declared, *"Bodhisattvas constantly reflect on and widely study the teachings to augment their wisdom."* Thus, the Buddha did not entirely reject learning; rather, he likened it to a raft for crossing a river—once across, one need not cling to it. Therefore, neither clinging to sūtras and treatises in pursuit of the Buddha-Dharma nor abandoning them in pursuit of the Buddha-Dharma is correct.

If one merely seeks to engage in inquiry without studying the scriptures, why did the Tathāgata expound the Dharma for forty-nine years and, at the end, entrust the teachings to the Venerable Ānanda? To dismiss mastery of the vast canon as unnecessary while resting content with fragmentary understanding is but the way of those with little attainment yet great arrogance.

The ancients, in their exhaustive exploration of the teachings from India, clarified their essential principles. Without relying on treatises to elucidate sūtras or sūtras to reveal the Dharma, how could they have attained great awakening? Thus, Yongjia studied the *Vimalakīrti Sūtra* and awakened to the mind-essence; Tiantai recited the *Lotus Sūtra* and attained samādhi. Those recorded in the *Transmission of the Lamp* were mostly monks of exceptional talent and broad learning—never were there eminent monks of shallow insight and narrow knowledge.

Yet the Buddha’s teachings ultimately lead to the same source, though the expedient means are many. Thus, sūtras may teach sudden or gradual awakening, and vehicles may be great or small. Those of keen faculties may attain sudden awakening even within gradual teachings, while those of dull faculties may gradually comprehend even within sudden teachings.

The parable of the *"three beasts crossing the river"* illustrates the lower and middle roots, expounding the lesser vehicle. Yet the *"three carts leaving the burning house"* in the *Lotus Sūtra* reveals the sudden by way of the gradual, opening the expedient wisdom to manifest the one-vehicle of true wisdom. Thus, the Buddha-Dharma culminates in the *Lotus Sūtra*, which unifies the three vehicles into one. For this reason, the Buddha predicted Buddhahood for all his great disciples—regardless of gender, whether human or celestial, young or old. This is what is meant by *"filling the pit where one stands, filling the valley where one dwells"*—akin to the Confucian saying, *"Nothing exists without it; no time is without it."*

Though the Buddha-nature is no different in sages and ordinary beings, without exhaustive inquiry and awakening, how can one transcend the mundane and enter sagehood? When the Sixth Patriarch was a layman, he carried stones and pounded rice, enduring extreme austerities—how many since have practiced such rigorous discipline?

Beyond inquiry, there is recitation; beyond recitation, there is the Pure Land. Ever since Master Huiyuan established the assembly on Mount Lu, those who escaped saṃsāra through Buddha-recitation and were reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss have been recorded in the *Pure Land Biographies*. Those who awakened to the mind-essence through sūtra-recitation, as seen in the *Biographies of Eminent Monks*, are too numerous to count.

Yet worldly practitioners, when engaging in Chan, often disparage Buddha-recitation, unaware that the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta attained perfect penetration through Buddha-recitation, and that Samantabhadra, having personally witnessed the Tathāgata’s boundless light, received his prediction of bodhi and thus exhorted others. How could this be a lesser fruit?

Monastics may prefer recitation, in which case they should practice in accordance with the teachings, investigating the mind-essence within recitation. Those who favor the Chan school should sever all conditions and directly inquire into the ultimate, investigating the mind-essence within meditation. Those who favor the Pure Land should recite with the Buddha’s mind, single-mindedly and without distraction, investigating the mind-essence within Buddha-recitation. If the mind-essence remains unclear, one should exert utmost effort in inquiry.

Like a traveler returning home, one finds peace only upon arrival; like a light sail crossing a river, one feels joy only upon reaching the shore.

If one halts midway, drawing boundaries to confine oneself—how could one hope to transcend the mundane, when the mundane cannot be transcended? How could one hope to enter sagehood, when sagehood cannot be entered? Even the first fruit remains unattainable—how much more the four fruits? Even the first dhyāna remains beyond reach—how much less the four dhyānas? Such practice, pursued to life’s end, will never lead to thorough awakening, and the intent of the Western Patriarchs will surely elude one. These are the ones who, having stumbled beneath the robe, find recovery most difficult.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Convergence of the Three into One**

At that time, the assembly of immortals in the Dharma assembly rose from their seats and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Since ancient times, when sages and wise ones emerged and divine luminaries appeared, before the classics were composed, before the jade tablets were revealed, before the Sanskrit scrolls were written—never had we heard of Confucianism and Daoism as distinct names, much less Buddhism. Once literary teachings unfolded and canonical laws were established, they were bequeathed to the world, shining as brightly as the sun and stars. Yet from the middle ages onward, simplicity waned. People, ignorant of the Dao, became lost in the nature of the essence, blind to the ultimate principle. Only then did the three teachings arise together to open the eyes of the deaf and blind. Yet as their branches diverged, they grew ever more distant. As the saying goes: ‘Those whose Ways differ do not take counsel together.’ Han Yu said: ‘What enters is mastered; what departs is enslaved. To depart from one is to enter another—such is the force of circumstance.’ Now, if the three teachings are one and the same ultimate Dao, there should be no names for the three teachings. Yet since Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism are distinct, how can it be said that the three teachings share a single principle? In the end, within their sameness lies their difference. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to clearly expound this, that future generations may know their direction and avoid falling into doubt and obstruction.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “In the beginning, when the great chaos first parted, before writing existed, governance relied on knotted cords. Heaven displayed its signs—sun, moon, stars, clouds, and auroras—shining brilliantly above. The sages took these as models: observing the constellations to create characters, patterning after clouds to devise seal script, discerning bird tracks to form writing. They made books and contracts to benefit the people. At that time, even the name of Confucianism did not yet exist—how much less Buddhism or Daoism! Yet though the teachings had not yet been established, their fundamental structure was already complete. For from the numbers of the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* arose Fuxi’s drawing of the trigrams, and from the principles of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* and the doctrines of yin-yang and the five phases emerged the transmission of ‘holding to the center with single-minded purity’—the root of the three teachings. Moreover, the *Book of Changes* states: ‘One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao.’ The various chapters all speak of yin and yang—how could they differ? Furthermore, those who cultivate the elixir first clarify the ascent and descent of water and fire, and the *Uncrossed* and *Crossed* hexagrams—the *Book of Changes* had already spoken of these! The words of Qi Bo to the Yellow Emperor likewise begin with ‘Heaven’s One generates water.’ The secrets of the *River Chart*, when matched with lead and mercury, are what the Buddhists call the ‘golden immortal.’ Gold is the mother of water—this is none other than the generative numbers of the *River Chart*, originally one and the same principle. As for the Dao and Confucianism, their unity is even more evident. Is there an external sixty-four hexagrams in the practice of longevity? Fuxi’s trigrams began with the primordial—*Qian* to the south, *Kun* to the north. Only King Wen’s later heaven arrangement placed *Qian* in the northwest and *Kun* in the southwest. Those who refine the elixir, within *Qian* and *Kun*, establish the furnace and tripod, using later heaven’s medicinal substances to restore the primordial. Within that emptiness and void, a single stroke opens heaven. Would one call these ancient sages Confucians? Buddhists? Daoists?”

Only the sages of middle antiquity, perceiving that later generations could not embody the whole in its entirety, were compelled to divide it into the three teachings by name. Though their names differ, their principle is one and the same. Thus it is said: “A thousand or ten thousand generations ago, if a sage appeared, this heart and this principle were the same; a thousand or ten thousand generations hence, if a sage appears, this heart and this principle will still be the same.” Therefore, the Buddha, in the *Lotus Sutra*, declared: “After the Buddha Sun-Moon-Lamp-Light, there was yet another Sun-Moon-Lamp-Light; after the Buddha King of Majestic Sound, there was yet another King of Majestic Sound!” And not only this—even through endless future kalpas, the three teachings, though distinct in path, converge in return. This is not the private word of one man, but the common word of sages past and present.

Of old, the Supreme Sage, in calling Laozi “like a dragon,” honored him to the utmost—yet the Supreme Sage never rejected the Dao. The *Scripture of the Western Ascension* states: “My teacher, the ancient sage-kings of India, are there; I shall now depart.” Thus Laozi never rejected the Buddha. Moreover, Śākyamuni Tathāgata, in a past kalpa, served the Longevity Immortal as his teacher and, at the assembly on Vulture Peak, recounted hearing the *Lotus Sutra*, declaring it to his disciples—thus the Tathāgata never rejected the immortals. The sages of the three teachings, in this heart and this principle, were originally without difference. Precisely because they are without difference, there is no division.

In human learning, must one necessarily master all three teachings? If one awakens to the one source and thoroughly investigates and clarifies it within the nature of the heart, then whether one studies Confucianism, Buddhism, or the Dao, upon full awakening, one naturally grasps the principle of the three teachings as one source. Thus, the Confucian must be a true Confucian, the Buddhist a true Buddhist, the Daoist a true Daoist. What is “true”? It is to embody the principle of utmost sincerity with a heart of utmost sincerity, and to cultivate the practice of utmost sincerity—truly one, not two. Then the sage may be aspired to, the Buddha may be learned from, and the immortal may be approached.

The Buddhist scriptures say: “What is called ‘sentient beings’ is not sentient beings.” If one merely follows superficial traces, slandering one another, content to be a sinner among the three teachings, this is called “sentient beings.”

Thereupon, the assembled immortals, having heard this, bowed in reverence and praised it in verse:

The Heavenly Worthy, great in compassion,
Expounded the principle of the three teachings—
Heart and nature share one source,
Heaven and humanity accord with the wondrous intent.
Like a mirror reflecting the clear void,
Like the moon imprinted on still water,
It reveals and manifests the fundamental vehicle,
Providing roots for cultivation.
Whether Confucian, Buddhist, or Daoist,
What division is there between them?
Only when one attains the great perfect enlightenment
Can one comprehend these words.
May all sentient beings universally
Not allow doubts and obstacles to arise.

When the immortals finished reciting this verse, in that moment, heavenly flowers rained down, circling the seat thrice. They bowed and withdrew, receiving and upholding the teaching.

*Verses in Praise of the Scripture of Uniting the Three*
*Final Chapter: Praise*

The Dharma-word abides in profound stillness,
The great canon lies in mysterious depth.
By harmonizing with the transformations of primordial qi, it employs compassionate heart to unravel meaning and point the lost toward the ford,
Universally delivering all classes of beings,
Conjoining and penetrating the supreme vehicle.

*Verse for Opening the Scripture*
Incense clouds wafting, veiling the central heavens,
Sacred cranes gracefully circling the Dharma assembly.
The True Lord broadly proclaims the thirty-two [teachings],
Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian doctrines flow on forever.
The Most High expounds to save kalpas, dispel disasters, bestow blessings, resolve calamities, and safeguard destiny,
Verifying and contemplating the wondrous Scripture of Uniting the Three.

*Final Chapter: Preserving the Kalpa Through Virtue, Chapter Twenty-Two*
At that time, the Heavenly Worthy expounded the principle of the three teachings as one, transmitting secrets unspoken by former sages.

Having concluded the Dharma-seat, together with the assembly of immortals, they reverently proceeded to the Palace of the Pure Jade in the Heaven of Miro. After presenting their report, they withdrew to the Supreme Palace, nurturing their spirit and perfection. There, with the jade-palace immortals and the perfected ones of the Jasper Isle, they discoursed on the practices of pure cultivation and the Dao of the Great One embracing the primordial.

Amidst their discourse, he suddenly sighed, saying: "I observe that among the people of the lower worlds, the deluded are many, the awakened few; those who turn from the Way are many, those who walk it few."

Those who discourse on the Dao are many, yet those who attain it are few. No wonder then that water and fire, pestilence and plague, great calamities and flood disasters cannot be averted. If one wishes to reverse the course of the kalpa, one must comprehend the supreme Dao. To comprehend the supreme Dao, one must first cultivate the mind. Without employing the methods of mind-cultivation to transform and deliver them in myriad ways, how would those sentient beings know to advance or retreat?

"I shall not shrink from toil, but on Heaven’s behalf proclaim transformation and deliver the deluded masses."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy once more mounted a five-colored auspicious cloud and descended in spirit to Ezhu. At that moment, the forests had just shed their leaves, the metallic wind blew chill, the bright sun shone in the sky, cinnabar clouds streamed across the scene, the mountains stood in silent majesty, purple qi surged with radiance, and the assembly of immortals rejoiced, attending the Dharma-seat, eager to hear the essential teaching.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "I observe that within the divine continent of Shenzhou, far and near across Yu’s domains, all manner of unbalanced qi arise—now drought, now flood, now water, now fire, now locusts, now plague. Wherever calamity strikes, people remain unaware of the karmic causes of their retribution; instead, they grow ever more perverse, so that day after day, they cannot escape it.

"According to the Daoist scriptures, from *zi* to *yin* marks one minor kalpa; the twelve cyclical signs together make four minor kalpas; the accumulation of these minor kalpas forms one great kalpa. Thereupon, famine and scarcity arise, pestilence and plague emerge, warfare erupts, drought and flood recur, and prodigies appear. Or again, the sun and moon deviate from their courses, the stars lose their proper measure, mountains collapse, waters overflow, and famine follows famine—all manner of inauspicious events. Though these are said to be the workings of qi and destiny, they are in truth the result of human affairs.

"Thus, the ancients, when faced with calamity, were filled with awe and turned to cultivation, from the sovereign above to the myriad commoners below—none dared be negligent. When the ruler cultivates virtue without transgression, comets do not appear, and the sun and moon, though due to be eclipsed, remain uneclipsed. When officials maintain purity and self-discipline, locusts do not enter their borders, tigers cross rivers, and winds reverse to extinguish fires—such events are recorded in the historical annals, most clearly evident.

"In former times, there was a city whose inhabitants had all accumulated deep karmic offenses, and their number was due for slaughter. After the report was submitted by the Mountain and River Offices, the Celestial Emperor could not bear it. Raising his dragon countenance to observe from amidst the clouds, he saw only black qi and poisonous clouds, dense and unyielding over the city. In an instant, a single ray of auspicious light arose from a corner of the city, piercing straight to the Emperor’s throne. The Emperor said: ‘Excellent! This is the light of a filial son.’"

Since the city possessed this, its slaughter could be averted." Thereupon, the Celestial Emperor commanded the Star Lord of Greed and Wolf to take up his staff and go forth to protect it, and thus the entire city was spared from slaughter. This account is recorded in *The Record of Emperor Wen’s Exhortation to Filial Piety* and may be examined for verification.

Now, the slaughter of an entire city is the gravest of calamities, the most severe of disasters. Yet because of a single filial son, it was absolved—clearly, the power to avert disaster lies with man, not entirely with fate. As the Book says: *"Heaven-sent misfortune may yet be avoided; self-inflicted misfortune cannot be escaped."* This is its proof.

Today, when people encounter widespread celestial disasters, they fail to reflect and reform, fail to strive for goodness, and instead recklessly engage in perverse prayers. How misguided! Worse still, some indulge in extravagance and dissipation, pursuing what is of no benefit—this is defiance of Heaven! Master Ziyu said: *"Those who follow the Way of Heaven endure; those who defy it perish."* To follow is to align with the principle of Heaven, not to violate the Dao in pursuit of fortune.

The Book further states: *"Revere and emulate the August Heaven."* "Revere" denotes the utmost awe and reverence; "emulate" denotes steadfast trust and compliance. When disaster strikes, if one cultivates virtue and practices benevolence: a single household’s goodness may spare that household from calamity; a region’s goodness may resolve that region’s distress. If all sentient beings could deeply ponder and earnestly practice these words, advancing in goodness, then the Celestial Emperor may be moved, disasters may be averted, and distress may be lifted. Even long-accumulated transgressions and deep-seated impurities would disperse like clouds before a fierce wind or melt like frost beneath the blazing sun.

Beware of being deluded by malevolent shamans and perverse mediums, recklessly offering prayers beyond one’s proper station—not only will this bring no benefit, but it will only deepen one’s karmic offenses! Be vigilant in your conduct, steadfast in your good deeds, for this is the essential path to dispelling calamity and distress.

The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the great assembly, saying: "When Heaven’s qi is in disorder, it may yet be redirected; when stars deviate from their courses, they may yet be realigned. For the Dao of Heaven shifts in response to human affairs—thus in a person’s life, whether one is noble or base, wealthy or poor, obstructed or unobstructed, long-lived or short-lived, none is fixed. Through the utmost cultivation of virtue, the base may become noble, the poor may grow rich, the short-lived may attain longevity, and the obstructed may find passage. Yet for those steeped in extreme evil, the retribution is the reverse. Thus human gains and losses are governed by Heaven, for though human resolve may overcome Heaven’s decree, Heaven’s decree may yet overcome human resolve. Heaven and humanity interact and resonate—this principle is one.

The river is by nature flowing; by damming it, one may halt its course, yet its flow is the unimpeded passage of form and body. The abyss is by nature still; by breaching it, one may set it in motion, yet its stillness is the constraint of form and vessel. So too is it with humanity. When one has not yet attained enlightenment, one seems utterly incapable, utterly powerless—thus in action, one meets with disorder, suffering want, hunger, and the torment of a heart besieged by cares. Yet once enlightened, one may achieve deeds that order Heaven and Earth, startling the world and confounding custom. Yet this is still but one and the same person—no different in later days than in former. The obstruction lies in the constraints of time and fate. Yet wealth and nobility, poverty and baseness, cycle endlessly without cease.

The melon-grower at the Blue Gate was once the Marquis of Dongling—can wealth and nobility be relied upon forever? The man who attends court and assists in governance was once the drowsy lout mocked by others—can poverty and baseness be despised? Thus the sage embodies Heaven’s Dao and upholds Heaven’s workings: abiding in wealth and nobility without arrogance, dwelling in poverty and baseness without sorrow, delighting in Heaven and knowing fate, the heart vast as the Great Void. True qi courses through the four seasons, wisdom parallels the sun and moon. Such a one’s conduct harmonizes with Heaven’s virtue, and thus their destiny unfolds: adversity and prosperity follow in turn, decline and renewal alternate.

For the qi of Heaven and Earth does not remain in decline forever—when decline reaches its limit, renewal begins. So too with human affairs: prosperity does not endure unbroken, for when prosperity exceeds its measure, adversity follows. The Most High said: ‘The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow: what is high is pressed down, what is low is raised up; what is excessive is diminished, what is deficient is replenished.’ So too is it with the human Dao: fortune leans upon misfortune, misfortune harbors fortune. Who knows their ultimate end? Is there no constancy? The upright reverts to the strange, the good reverts to the ominous. Thus the human person and the Dao of Heaven are mutually reflective.

The *Yin Fu Jing* states: ‘Heaven’s nature is humanity’s nature; the human heart is the mechanism of change. Establishing Heaven’s Dao is to stabilize humanity. When Heaven and humanity act in unison, the foundation of all transformations is set.’ Therefore, those who aspire to sagehood or immortality must first grasp this principle of Heaven and humanity as one. Then ‘the cosmos rests in the palm of the hand, the myriad transformations arise from the body.’ One may thereby encompass the Dao of Heaven and Earth, assisting and harmonizing with their workings—this is the supreme principle of the highest vehicle.

Yet this principle of Heaven and humanity as one is the ultimate achievement of exhausting one’s nature and the consummate mastery of destiny. How can beginners attain it? They must only ceaselessly embody it within their own heart and nature. For the human heart inherently possesses Heaven’s principle: the human heart *is* the Heavenly heart. Heaven has the Great Ultimate; the human heart also has the Great Ultimate. Heaven has harmony; the human heart also has harmony.

Master Zisi said: ‘The Dao is not far from humanity. If one practices the Dao while distancing oneself from humanity, it cannot be called the Dao.’ For outside the human heart, there is no Dao; outside the Dao, there is no heart. Thus when one cultivates the Dao, one cultivates the heart; when one cultivates the heart, one cultivates the Dao. Is the Dao distinct? Is the heart distinct? Every person possesses this one heart—thus every person possesses their own Heaven. Every person shares this one heart—thus every person shares this Heaven, shares this Dao.

Yet worldly people, drowned in desires, obscure their Heaven and darken their hearts. They cannot seek the Heaven of the Imperial Chariot amid the extinction of sound and scent. Yet in the instant before a thought arises in our hearts, we are directly in communion with the profound and silent Heaven, breathing in unison—there is no separate principle of harmony beyond this heart. To seek union with Heaven apart from this heart is to propagate heretical teachings that deceive the people; it is not the true Dao.

Formerly, I once remarked, ‘A single alchemical technique may mislead people five hundred years hence.’ It was precisely for this heart that I dared not deceive myself to deceive Heaven, and thus I was guided by the sagely teacher to achieve perfection. Even now, in the flight of the phoenix and the transformations of the numinous, I am but employing this heart of compassion to act on Heaven’s behalf. If the hearts of all beings align with my heart, Heaven will surely bless them, and I too will witness it—then the supreme Dao may be attained."

The feathered kind numbers three hundred and sixty, with the phoenix as their chief; the furred kind numbers three hundred and sixty, with the qilin as their chief; the crawling kind numbers three hundred and sixty, with humans as their chief. Within the cosmos, the myriad beings are not uniform: flying and walking creatures differ, the numinous and the dull vary. Each follows its endowed nature, born and nurtured between Heaven and Earth. If one seeks to compare and make them the same, how could it be possible?

Not only among creatures—even the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the brilliance of the sun and moon, should cover and embrace all, should illuminate all. Yet Heaven does not fill the southeast, Earth does not fill the northwest; in the northernmost reaches of extreme yin, the sun and moon cannot shine. Thus Zisi said, *"Great as Heaven and Earth are, people still have regrets."* Qu Yuan asked, *"Where the sun does not reach, how does the Torch Dragon illuminate? Before Xihe has risen, how does Ruohua shine?"* Even with the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the brightness of the sun and moon, there are still insufficiencies—how much more so for humans?

Long ago, the Perfected King of Total Reality served as disciple to the Lady Ma Gu. The Lady told him, *"Since I began receiving guests, the blue seas have thrice turned to mulberry fields, and the waters of Penglai have grown shallow!"* Thus time passes in an instant, swift as a white colt flashing past a gap—no metaphor suffices. Wang Zhi’s axe-handle rotted while he watched, and a thousand years turned in a glance; the fisherman at the river’s mouth returned to find the ford lost. Within the Six Directions, all is illusion; every sentient being is but a phantom body. Through illusion one experiences illusion—strange transformations, wondrous changes. Since ancient times, none could exhaust their telling. If one pursues this to its ultimate end, even Heaven and Earth are but illusory transformations, destined for decay. Thus it is said: *"Sincerity is the beginning and end of things,"* and Heaven and Earth are but one thing among them. Only Heaven and Earth endure long—humans cannot match them! Yet even Heaven and Earth have no time of perfect flourishing.

Observe the sun and moon: the sun at noon begins to decline, the moon at full begins to wane. The Way of waxing and waning turns with the seasons. Observe the mountains and rivers: waters fill and overflow, earth fills and crumbles—the principle of collapse and overflow moves with things. Observe the hundred creatures: the morning mushroom knows not dusk or dawn, the cicada knows not spring or autumn—their natures, though subtle, differ. In the fourth month, a hundred plants flourish, grasses and trees luxuriate, yet the withered grasses die first—can this be explained? In the first month, thunder roars, and the fruits and grasses all split their husks, while peach and plum vie to bloom; when the warm south wind stirs, pomegranate flames grow more radiant, lotus fragrance fills the air, and peach and plum pale by comparison. At the first breath of the golden wind, white dew congeals, late chrysanthemums stir the reclusive heart, and water caltrop and lotus lose their scent. The clear pool’s green waters—where now are the lotuses of old?

Examine the four seasons: cold and heat alternate, flourishing and withering, growth and decay—none can be fully recorded! The inequality of things is the nature of things. One cannot force the walking to fly, nor compel the dull to be numinous—their natures are thus. When the Divine Lord of Nanhua spoke of making them equal, he did not mean to make things identical, but rather that in considering their beginning and end, their return to the root and restoration of fate, they are equal.

Thus the perfected person, taking lessons from afar in things and from near at hand in the self, knows that waxing and waning, growth and decay, are but the Way of cyclical replacement. Here abundance, there scarcity—there is no principle of perpetual flourishing. Therefore, one acts according to one’s station without desiring what lies beyond. Even in times of utmost flourishing, one must ever be wary of collapse. Thus, to occupy a high position without arrogance is to long preserve nobility; to dwell in abundance without extravagance is to long preserve wealth.

For this reason, the sages arranged the *Book of Changes*, placing *"Humility"* after *"Great Possession."* Only by being *"great"* and yet *"humble"* can one long preserve what one has—not only in times of perfect flourishing. Long ago, the Sage Confucius praised Wei Gongzi Jing for his skill in managing his household, simply because he knew contentment! The Most High said, *"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no danger—this is how one endures."* The Buddhist scriptures say, *"The contented, though poor, are rich; the discontented, though rich, are poor, and are ever pitied by the contented."* The *Odes* say, *"Neither envious nor covetous—what use is not good?"* For once discontent arises, greed is born; with greed, envy and desire grow strong, and one loses the Way of meeting circumstances—how much more so in times of perfect flourishing!

Thus, in times of flourishing, joy arises, and with it arrogance and extravagance. If even one matter goes against one’s wishes, sorrow arises, and with it anger. This is the inevitable path of mutual succession. In the vastness of the cosmos, across the expanse of past and present, are there none who have known perfect flourishing? I need not recount them all—take the eight Xis of Jin, the three ministers and five great officials: they were truly flourishing! Yet in but a few generations, their descendants were plowing the fields. Or take Fengyang of Tang, who restored the imperial enterprise, whose name is recorded in history, who reached the pinnacle of ministerial rank, whose court was filled with officials—truly flourishing! Yet in but a few generations, the mansions bestowed upon him belonged to others. Where now is that perfect flourishing?

Thus, the Way of flourishing lies only in guarding it with humility, dwelling in restraint, and preserving it with virtue. As for the reckoning of rise and fall, leave it to Heaven, accept it as fate. To wish for perfect flourishing without a single loss—this has never existed since ancient times.

The Dao’s transformation moves thus: from emptiness it transforms into spirit, from spirit into qi, from qi into form, and with form’s arising, the myriad things fill all! Yet why do they fill all? They are obstructed by the hindrances of form and qi. Within the human body, the eyes govern sight, the ears govern hearing. Their sight is clarity, their hearing is acuity—yet their forms differ, and their functions are distinct. Consider the fowl, a creature of feathers: by day it sees clearly, by night it is dim; the owl, too, is a feathered creature, yet by day it is dim, by night it sees clearly. Why do owl and fowl differ thus? They are bound by the hindrances of form and qi. Now observe emptiness: emptiness is not *being*, yet those who possess the Dao may tread upon emptiness. Observe metal and stone: metal and stone are not *non-being*, yet those who possess the Dao may pierce through them. Within the human body, the five senses and four limbs cannot interchange their functions, yet through the Tathāgata’s divine power, the eyes may perform the ears’ merit, the ears may perform the eyes’ merit. How is it that obstruction is transformed into communication? Through transformation. The Dao transforms without ceasing, and its spirit moves without limit.

Now consider the five phases: earth by nature restrains water, yet water in abundance may harm earth, turning it to sludge; wood by nature generates fire, yet fire in its fury may destroy wood, reducing it to ash. Their arising, their decay, their change, their transformation—all unfold thus. In change, being arises from non-being, yet not without cause; in transformation, non-being arises from being, yet not without cause. There are always conditions at work.

Long ago, when Śākyamuni expounded the Dharma, he employed manifold conditions and parables, and Kauṇḍinya and the others all awakened through conditions. When the *Lotus Sutra* completed its exposition of conditions, Pūrṇa and the others all received predictions of buddhahood. Not only the ancient sages and buddha-ancestors—even I, in a former life as the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, descended in spirit to the Lü family, and this, too, had its conditions. Had there been no prior causes, how could I have been born into that household? Later, when I encountered the Sagely Master of Correct Yang, who transmitted to me a scroll of the *Scripture of Salvation*, this, too, came about because the Sagely Ancestor, the Imperial Lord of Lesser Yang, had spoken of the conditions, and thus I was delivered. Moreover, the Sagely Ancestor was a man of Zhou, and it was only in the Han dynasty that he delivered Correct Yang—this, too, was because the Most High had commanded him to descend the mountain and await him at a critical juncture, delivering him to the immortal caves. The Sagely Ancestor, by virtue of delivering Correct Yang, realized the title of Imperial Lord of Lesser Yang of the Eastern Florescence’s Purple Palace. Later, the Sagely Master, by virtue of delivering me, realized the title of Imperial Lord of the Transmission of the Dao and the Perpetuation of the Ultimate. Had there been no conditions, how could they have met by chance across hundreds of years from Zhou to Han, and again from Han to Tang? Thus, in the vastness of the cosmos, without prior causes, one may miss the encounter even face to face; yet with prior causes, though separated by thousands of miles, distance is no obstacle!

Long ago, the First Ancestor of the Eastern Land received the command of the twenty-seventh ancestor of the Western Heaven: “Your conditions lie in the Land of the Sinitic Realm.” He crossed the sea and arrived in the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of Liang. When the emperor’s discourse failed to resonate, he withdrew to Shaoshi, where he sat in wall-gazing meditation for nine years. Later, he encountered Shenguang and transmitted to him the verse: “One flower opens into five leaves, and the fruit naturally ripens.” By the time of the Sixth Ancestor, the prophecy of one flower and five leaves was fulfilled—was this not the predetermination of conditions?

Even in my own propagation of the teachings in Piling and my retreat to various sacred sites, whether the conditions called for duration or haste, there was never an encounter without cause! Yet I, bearing the celestial mandate of the Jade Purity and Numinous Treasure, the divine tally of the Golden Towers of the Miro Realm, universally deliver those with conditions throughout the great thousandfold world. My heart of compassion aspires to deliver all beings, and thus in a single day I preside over three thousand assemblies—how could this be limited to one place alone? Yet though my vows are vast and deep, they depend upon prior cultivation. This is like “the nurturance of rain and dew, which cannot nourish a rootless tree.” Thus, minor conditions yield minor results, and major conditions yield major results. There has never been a good cause leading to evil conditions, nor an evil cause leading to good conditions.

Consider the altars I have established in the land of Chu—how many there have been! Moreover, from the Tang dynasty to the present, a thousand years have passed, and across the vastness of the maritime frontier, my altars number in the thousands and tens of thousands. Yet those who today favor my Dao are those who in former kalpas once upheld my causes. Those with deep conditions have deep causes; those with shallow conditions have shallow causes.

You, my disciples, are fortunate to gather here at this altar today—this is no accidental cause. Each of you should cultivate introspection, for this is the planting of good causes and the weaving of good conditions. If you can persevere in cultivation without retreat, until causes deepen and conditions ripen, you will realize the Dao and attain perfection—only then may you trust in yourselves.

Long ago, Śāriputra, in the time of King Brahmā Voice, was already a disciple in the former life of Śākyamuni Buddha. Through kalpa after kalpa, he never wavered in his devotion, and later, in Śākyamuni’s assembly, he became foremost in wisdom. You, my disciples, need only bring forth sincerity, deeply believe in conditions, and day by day nurture the sprout of goodness, that your virtuous karma may flourish. Take care not to be deluded, lest you stray onto deviant paths.

In the age of high antiquity, when primordial qi had not yet dissipated, sagely and wise rulers governed above, transforming the world below. All people possessed goodness and knew no evil. In the middle antiquity, as primordial qi had already dissipated, those who did evil grew numerous while those who acted virtuously dwindled. Thus, the sages established teachings through the numinous Dao, clarifying the consequences of good and evil, the principles of karmic retribution, and the cycle of birth and death, guiding people to turn toward goodness and amend their faults.

Yet the Confucians of this world, unaware that the Dao of Heaven delights in cyclical return—rewarding those who follow the good and punishing those who defy it with unfailing precision—dismiss the karmic retributions and numinous verifications spoken of by Buddhas and immortals as absurd and baseless. Some even claim that before the advent of Buddhism in China, there were no such things as "pestles pounding, mills grinding" in the hells. They do not realize that the agonies of hellish retribution are recorded in the classics of immortals, clearly verifiable—how could this be found only in Buddhist scriptures? Moreover, the birth of the virtuous in heaven and the suffering of the wicked in the three evil destinies are teachings explicitly set forth by the sages. Only because such matters belong to the unseen do people fail to witness them!

The Most High has said: *"The Way of Heaven contends not, yet excels in victory; speaks not, yet excels in response."* Can this truly be groundless? Even the Buddhist depictions of pestles pounding, mills grinding, and the manifold transformations of hell are but expedient means for those of dull capacities, who cannot be instructed by principle alone. Thus, the three evil destinies must be vividly illustrated to warn and awaken them. This is the Buddha’s compassion, an unavoidable necessity.

The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* states: *"The people of this land are stubborn and difficult to transform, so the Buddha speaks in stern terms to subdue them."* It does not mean that those who cultivate goodness will suffer the torments of pestles and mills! Therefore, for those of superior and middling capacities, the teachings focus solely on illuminating the mind and perceiving the nature, while regarding karmic retribution, they are merely cautioned against transgression.

Yet the principle of retribution is not only earnestly expounded by Buddhas and immortals—even in the Confucian classics, such records are too numerous to count! Take the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the great canon and law bequeathed by the ancient sages. The events it records occurred long ago, but their karmic consequences unfolded later. Within its span of two hundred and forty-two years, how boundless are the manifest retributions? Let us cite a few examples:

Duke Xiang of Qi murdered the ruler of Lu, yet when the people of Lu demanded justice, he shifted the blame onto Prince Pengsheng. Later, during the rebellion of Cui Zhu, the duke saw a boar standing upright and wept, crying, *"It is Prince Pengsheng!"* Terrified, he fled and met his doom. In Zheng, spectral omens foretold the killing of Duan the following year, and the event came to pass as predicted—was this not the settling of a grievance after death?

At the Assembly of Kuiqiu, Duke Huan of Qi first commanded: *"Do not replace the heir apparent; do not make a concubine your wife."* Yet he later favored six concubines as if they were proper wives. After his death, his five sons contended for the throne, his corpse lay unburied, and maggots swarmed beyond the palace gates—was this not the dire retribution for breaking his oath?

Duke Xian of Jin, in his cunning scheme to borrow a path to annihilate Guo, devised an utterly treacherous plot—yet Heaven repaid him with treachery in kind. He took Lady Li Ji as his consort, siring Xi Qi and Zhuo Zi; he destroyed a state and took its princess, harboring his enemy close, yet remained deluded and unaware! This led to the murder of Shensheng, the exile of Chong’er, and the flight of Huaihui, nearly bringing ruin to his kingdom. Could one truly claim that Heaven was oblivious to his scheming and deceit?

Yet when Wei Ke bound grass to repel the enemy, moved by his father’s dying command to marry off his father’s concubine, and repaid kindness in the netherworld—who could say that spirits and gods are entirely illusory? Nevertheless, Han Yu, the great Confucian, dismissed the *Zuozhuan* as exaggerated; Liu Zongyuan, a man of talent, also disbelieved many such accounts—how much more so those beneath them?

From ancient times to the present, examples of karmic retribution for good and evil abound. Lü Buwei, who presented his pregnant concubine to the King of Qin, scheming for his son to become emperor, saw his wish fulfilled when the First Emperor ascended the throne. Thus, the Qin dynasty bore the surname Lü instead of Ying—yet in the end, Buwei died by his son’s hand. Buwei’s cunning was great, but Heaven’s retribution was even more ingenious!

Chunshen Jun, who offered his pregnant concubine to the King of Chu, likewise desired her son to become king—yet he was ultimately murdered by that very concubine. Those who plot against others are in the end plotted against; those who harm others are in the end harmed. Disaster follows swiftly on their heels.

These are but retributions among humankind. As for the Qin general Bai Qi, who buried alive four hundred thousand soldiers at Changping, his soul has since fallen into the realm of beasts, with no end in sight! The Qin’s tyranny was matched by Bai Qi’s cruelty, who regarded hundreds of thousands of lives as no more than dogs and swine. The Dao of Heaven cherishes life—how fitting that he should endure such suffering, trapped for ten thousand kalpas without deliverance!

As for the accounts in unofficial histories and works like the *Ledgers of Merit and Demerit* and *Exhortations to Goodness*, whether derived from hearsay or witnessed firsthand, their events may be exceedingly strange, yet all are credible. They are not mere fabrications, absurd and baseless. For in the vastness of the cosmos, what is theoretically impossible often becomes reality—how could one dismiss it as false?

The *Book of Songs* says:
*"The thoughts of the divine are unfathomable,
How could one presume to mock them?"*
And again:
*"Heaven is ever manifest,
Ascending and descending, its officers ever watchful,
Its gaze fixed here daily."*
And again:
*"God is above you,
Let not your heart waver."*

All you disciples gathered here, when you hear of another receiving good reward for a virtuous deed, you should rejoice and think with admiration: *"Why am I not like this?"* Joy gives rise to emulation, emulation to the resolve to follow suit, and thus the heart of goodness arises. When you hear of another receiving ill reward for an unvirtuous deed, you should tremble with fear and ask: *"Might I too be like this?"* Apprehension leads to caution, caution to the dread of repeating such acts, and thus the heart of ungoodness is stilled.

As the saying goes: *"On seeing the worthy, think to equal them; on seeing the unworthy, turn inward and examine yourself."* If, upon witnessing goodness, you fail to encourage it; if, upon witnessing ungoodness, you fail to admonish it; if, upon hearing of good reward, you feel envy; or if, upon hearing of ill reward, you feel delight—such attitudes will only accumulate evil causes day by day, and the bitter retribution will fall upon yourself instead!

Beware of clinging to the one-sided views of pedantic scholars, dismissing the Buddha’s and immortals’ teachings on karmic retribution as untrustworthy, and regarding the sutras’ accounts of the cycle of birth and death, the hells, and the realms of suffering as mere fictions. To do so is to willingly plunge into ruin, and even in death, you will have no regrets!

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Manifest Proofs of Spirits and Deities**

In ancient times, when Kumārajīva was about to enter nirvana, he made a vow before the Buddha, saying: *"All the sutras and treatises I have translated faithfully follow the Sanskrit originals. If even a single word fails to accord with the Buddha’s intent, may my tongue be destroyed."* Thus, when his body was cremated, all who witnessed it saw his entire form consumed—only his tongue remained intact, radiant as a red lotus. To this day, the sutras and treatises he translated are revered by spirits and deities, cherished in the palaces of immortals and the peaks of the sea, guarded by dragons and heavenly beings, and offered incense and flowers. How could these be dismissed as deceptive falsehoods, bizarre theories, or unorthodox writings?

Yet the scholars of this world, confined by shallow and narrow views, raised in a single corner of the land, fail to grasp the principle that the Three Teachings share a common source. No sooner have their passions awakened than they drown in love and desire; before their marriages are even complete, their twilight years approach, and they do not recognize that the four great elements of their own bodies are empty—how then could they understand that all sentient beings before their eyes are but illusions? Deluded by falsehood and chasing after illusion, they recklessly mock and ridicule the scriptures of immortals and the teachings of the Buddha. They dismiss the Dao of good fortune for the virtuous and calamity for the wicked as unfounded, and scorn the doctrine of birth and death and the cycle of rebirth as unworthy of belief. In truth, their own nature remains obscured, their understanding clouded. Ask them to penetrate the mysteries of life and destiny, and they are utterly benighted; examine their devotion to ethical norms, and they are but perfunctory. Ashamed in the privacy of their chambers, abashed before the shadow of their own quilts—how then could they dare to call spirits and deities mere fictions and regard the Buddha and immortals as distant and unreal?

When Li Lu asked about *"serving the spirits,"* the Supreme Sage replied: *"If one cannot even serve men, how can one serve ghosts?"* This was meant as a practical admonition—nowhere did he deny the existence of spirits and deities. The Supreme Sage also said: *"Life and death are indeed matters of great weight!"* For though even the wise and sagely cannot escape the principle of life and death, the *Book of Changes* states: *"Tracing things to their beginning and returning to their end, one thus knows the Dao of life and death. Essence and qi become things; the wandering soul undergoes transformation—thus one knows the conditions of spirits and deities."* Essence and qi give rise to life when spirit arrives; the wandering soul brings death when the corporeal soul departs. Understanding these conditions, the principle of rebirth becomes clear.

Zhang Zai said: *"One who knows that death does not mean annihilation may be spoken to of nature."* The terms "life" and "death" derive from the physical body, not from the heart-mind or nature. For the body may decay, but nature does not. It is like the grasses and trees: though their branches and leaves wither, their roots remain in the earth, and when spring comes, they sprout anew. So too do humans: those who cultivate blessings are reborn in the heavens or among men, while those who commit evil deeds fall into the lower realms. If one claims that the principle of life and death leads to annihilation, then consider the words in the *Metal-Bound Coffer*: when the Duke of Zhou offered himself in place of the king, it is written: *"I, your filial and wise elder, am skilled in many arts and able to serve the spirits!"* If the Duke of Zhou’s prayers to the Three Kings were true, would they not contradict the annihilationist theories of worldly scholars? For if the Duke of Zhou had died in the king’s place, his form would have decayed and his spirit dispersed—even with his many talents, how could he still serve the spirits? And if the spirits themselves had already dispersed and perished, how could they have been served by the Duke of Zhou?

The rites of sacrifice were held in great esteem by the ancient sages. If one claims that spirits and deities are without substance, then the idea of *"offering humble food and drink to express filial piety to ghosts and spirits"* would be nothing but empty ritual. If one argues that sacrifice is merely descendants connecting with the qi of their ancestors, qi responding to qi to create resonance, then how does this explain the Son of Heaven’s sacrifices to the mountains, rivers, and great peaks, which are not his descendants? Could one say that Shun and Yu were the descendants of all the hundred spirits? Thus, though the Dao of spirits and deities is subtle and difficult to know, the principle of life and death is clear and readily apparent. The mechanism of their responsiveness is swifter than drum and drumstick; the retribution of rebirth turns like a wheel—most wondrously swift.

If there were no retribution for good and evil, no rebirth in hells or heavens, how would the Creator deal with the Most Sagely? Why would Heaven show partiality to Cao Cao alone? As for the *Declarations of the Perfected*, that book was a later forgery and is not to be trusted. If the principle of good fortune for the virtuous and calamity for the wicked were truly baseless, then those who cultivate themselves and strive diligently throughout their lives would fare worse than those who indulge their desires, pursue profit, and commit evil deeds, escaping punishment by mere luck. How could this be considered wise? The world’s customs grow ever more degenerate, and human hearts ever more insincere. Even when evil retribution is plainly visible before their eyes, they remain unmoved, unafraid of death—how much less would they believe in the hells and realms of suffering that await them after death! No wonder they live without knowing whence they came and die without knowing whither they go, drifting through life and death in vain, trapped in the cycle of rebirth without even realizing it.

Men of the world, cunning and calculating, assume that in the hidden depths of their hearts, when thoughts arise and intentions stir, the spirits and deities may not immediately know. Yet the Dharma-realm and the self-mind are not two separate things! The moment the self-mind stirs, even the ten directions and the three realms are fully aware. Thus, the *Doctrine of the Mean* begins by teaching the practice of vigilance and caution in solitude, instructing scholars that though spirits and deities may be subtle and invisible, unseen and unheard, the spirits and deities within our own minds cannot be deceived!

All you disciples gathered here must each arouse yourselves to diligent cultivation. Do not dismiss the cycle of birth and death as mere fiction, nor the retribution of spirits and deities as distant and unreal. Then the heart of vigilance will arise, good causes will gradually take root, and evil karma will gradually dissolve. Offering your bright virtue as incense, the spirits will surely receive it.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Dharma-Body is Non-Dual**

"The Dao of True Constancy resides within each person’s own body. In all human movement and stillness, speech and silence, this True Constancy manifests its wondrous function, responding to affairs and engaging with things without omission or error. The Confucians call it 'supreme sincerity without cease,' the Daoists call it 'attaining the nature of True Constancy,' and the Buddhists call it 'the true mind of constant nature'—their principle is one and the same.

Yet since the Dao is fundamentally true, it should be embodied without falsity; since the Dao is fundamentally constant, it should be sought with perseverance. If one fabricates existence from nothingness, fills emptiness with delusion, and allows false thoughts to scatter and disturb, one loses that which makes it true. If one acts intensely for a day and grows cold for ten, or shifts with every changing sight, one loses that which makes it constant. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth endures without cease; the Dao of the noble person stands firm without altering its direction.

This Dao of True Constancy is none other than the non-dual Dao of True Oneness in the *Jade Scripture* and *Pure and Still*. It gives rise to the ten thousand dharmas, hence it is called the 'Dharma-gate.' The *Book of Changes* says: 'When the completed nature is preserved and maintained, it is the gate of Dao and virtue.' For from this arise all principles, and thus it bears the meaning of a gate. Hence it is said: 'The One gives rise to the Two, the Two give rise to the Three, and the Three give rise to the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang.' What is the One? It is sincerity. From this, the Two Modes divide; from this, the Three Powers are established; from this, the ten thousand things are born and nurtured. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is undivided in its creation of things. Therefore, the unfathomable generation of beings—Heaven and Earth share this One, humans share this One, sages, worthies, Buddhas, and immortals all share this One, and the Supreme Emperor shares this One as well.

This Dharma-gate of True Oneness and Non-Duality is most spiritually precious and most pure. When the Primordial Beginning took his seat to expound the Dharma, he elucidated this One; when the Jade Emperor manifested his incarnate birth, he was rooted in this One; when the Universal Illumination cultivated the Dao in Fragrant Rock Mountain, he cultivated this One; and in attaining Buddhahood or emperorship, he fully realized this One.

Examining it through events: the Land of Radiant Strictness and Wondrous Joy was where the Supreme Emperor demonstrated his birth; Fragrant Rock Mountain in Universal Illumination was the place of true cultivation. Speaking in terms of the Dao: Radiant Strictness and Wondrous Joy is the adorned body of the person, while Fragrant Rock Mountain is the luminous ground of the mind. The Supreme Emperor’s renunciation of his kingdom to cultivate the Dao was like Śākyamuni, who abandoned the throne of the Brahmā King’s son and practiced austerities on Snow Mountain. Snow Mountain and Fragrant Rock both share the quality of purity.

Yet why does the Supreme Emperor’s cultivation in each kalpa always number 'eight hundred'? Let me explain: The first eight hundred kalpas of relinquishing the kingdom illustrate the Eight Abandonments. In the Buddhist path of the Six Perfections, almsgiving comes first. The next eight hundred kalpas clarify the transformation of the Eight Consciousnesses into the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, for without wisdom, there is no way to enter the Dao. The following eight hundred kalpas represent the Eightfold Noble Path, which is the ultimate correctness of the Six Perfections and the ten thousand practices. The final eight hundred kalpas of offering his own flesh and blood represent the Eight Liberations. For in earlier cultivation, one still clings to the notions of person and dharma; only upon offering his own flesh and blood does one forget both person and dharma. Thus, after three thousand two hundred kalpas, he attained the rank of Golden Immortal.

Yet when Śākyamuni attained Buddhahood, he had practiced for countless kalpas—how could the Supreme Emperor have done so in only three thousand two hundred? The 'three thousand' signifies transcending the Three Realms and comprehending the Three Vehicles; the 'two hundred' signifies the perfect interpenetration of the Two Truths—this is precisely the cause of attaining Buddhahood. Thus, the fruit accords with the cause: the Buddha is called the Great Awakened One and the 'Dharma King,' while the Supreme Emperor is also titled the 'Tathāgata of Awakened Sovereignty.' Yet with boundless compassion, he declines the Buddha’s rank and practices the bodhisattva path. Only after countless kalpas does he attain the position of Jade Emperor, his merit and power beyond conception!

The Jade Maiden’s body of purity is also identical to the Emperor’s—why? For the unity of one yin and one yang is called the Dao. The Jade Maiden cultivates all wondrous practices, cultivating this Dao; the Supreme Emperor universally emits divine light, illuminating this Dao. Thus, from the Jade Maiden’s body arises the fragrance of subtle and wondrous liberation, and the six destinies of beings all partake of its excellence.

Formerly, Śāriputra doubted whether the Dragon Girl could attain Buddhahood, arguing that the female body is defiled and subject to the Five Hindrances. Yet to attain Buddhahood in such a form is precisely to remain attached to form! For the Great Dao makes no distinction between male and female—it cannot be sought through form, sound, or appearance.

When the Jade Emperor emits light, it pervades boundless worlds, and Golden Immortals and bodhisattvas all arrive, scattering flowers and emitting fragrance—this illustrates that immortals and Buddhas share the same source, with no duality in principle! When Śākyamuni expounded the Dharma, his light shook the earth, and all the gods and Supreme Emperors gathered—it was just the same.

Yet the Supreme Emperor possesses boundless radiance, so why is it named only the Seventeen Lights? From ancient times, Buddhas and immortals in cultivating the Dao first arouse the Four Immeasurable Minds of kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, and only then reach the ultimate in spiritual transformation. Thus, the Emperor’s Seventeen Lights begin with the Light of Great Compassion and conclude with the Light of Invincibility.

Yet this luminosity is not entirely absent among beings—people possess it but obscure it themselves; sages and worthies possess it but may not fully realize it; only the Supreme Emperor fully embodies it to its utmost.

The Lord of the Highest Void and Pure Brightness Heaven is the eighth heaven of the Nine Heavens of Spirit Generation—how could he be unaware of the Jade Emperor’s affairs? Yet the Primordial Beginning Honored One still said to you all: 'Due to residual habits, you have not beheld the compassionate countenance of this Emperor.' This is because the residual habits of beings create heavy obstructions, preventing them from seeing their nature. Thus, he borrowed the words of the Heavenly Lord to teach people to sever their obstructions!

The essential method for severing obstructions is none other than arousing the mind of great compassion, for only compassion can deliver the world. Therefore, bodhisattvas contemplate liberating all beings without remainder, extinguishing their suffering and guiding them to nirvāṇa."

All doubts and delusions, disputes between self and others, greed and anger, arrogance and lust—these manifold obstructions are the very roots of the cycle of birth and death. The scriptures speak of "severing obstructions," which is what the Buddha calls "delivering beings," and what the Confucians call "mastering the self." The method of cultivation takes this as its foremost task. If one upholds this scripture, one who severs obstructions to dispel self-interest, quiets the mind to preserve correctness, remains free from arrogance and deceit, fulfills loyalty and perfect filial piety, and reverently submits to the Supreme Dao—such a one may be called a "Perfected Person of Orthodox Unity." It is not that one may claim the title of Perfected Person merely by reciting the words with the mouth. All of you in this assembly constantly recite this scripture; if you can eliminate and sever each of the obstructions described within it, striving until no obstruction remains to be severed, this is the ultimate achievement of embodying the Dao, the essential key to entering sagehood and transcending the ordinary!

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: An Exegesis on the Meaning of the Scripture**

The teachings of the Buddhist and Immortal traditions differ in their canons, and their methods of cultivation also vary in many ways. Yet in my observation, the purport of the *Jade Scripture* often aligns with the Buddhist sūtras. For instance, the scripture states: *"The ten-direction transformation bodies of the Jade Emperor all gather beneath the Primordial Beginning’s assembly, like boundless bright mirrors."* This is akin to Śākyamuni manifesting bodies in the ten directions and, when about to open the stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha, transforming the pure land three times to accommodate the buddhas of the ten directions, all of whom open the stūpa together. Again, *"The Heavenly Treasures and wondrous flowers offered by the Lord of Pure Brightness Heaven spiral and coalesce into a canopy"* is like *"In Vaiśālī, five hundred sons of elders each hold a seven-jeweled canopy to offer to the Buddha, who causes all the jeweled canopies to merge into one."* For if there were oneness without division, the divine transformations of the myriad phenomena could not be seen; if there were division without oneness, the wondrousness of the One Origin could not be seen.

As for Śākyamuni’s responsive manifestation, descending from the Heaven of the Seed People, according to the Daoist canon, Śākyamuni is also an emanation of the Jade Emperor—only those who have not fully explored the canon remain unaware of this. Thus, his demonstrated traces of birth and the divine transformations of his cultivation and realization are largely the same. The sole difference lies in the Five Directions’ proclamations.

For the Supreme Lord administers transformation and governance, overseeing the pacification of water and earth—matters distinct from those of the Buddha. Yet the Five Directions’ proclamations and the *Crimson Writ of Numinous Script* are said by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning to have arisen before the vast kalpas, at the inception of primordial chaos. The Two Modes await them to divide, the sun and moon await them to illumine. Consider this: before the Two Modes had separated, before the sun and moon had shone, where did this numinous script arise? Only by awakening to this may one be called thoroughly enlightened.

Yet people know that the Five Venerable Lords implored the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning to open the *Jade Casket* rituals and transmit the *Numinous Treasure* Dharma, without realizing that the scriptures refer to the Five Venerables to reveal that humans, endowed with the qi of the Five Phases, all return to the Origin. The *Jade Casket*’s numinous script resides within the nature of the human heart—who would claim the *Jade Scripture* merely recounts the deeds of the Supreme Lord and is not a text expounding the Dao?

All practitioners who, in accordance with the scriptures, first sever all obstacles and then follow the *Numinous Scripts of the Five Directions* to practice as prescribed, will, through prolonged devotion, naturally gain the protection of celestial perfected beings, with all demons restrained in form. The twelve bodies may thereby personally verify the thirty kinds of merit, which will arrive unbidden.

The only hindrance is that people fail to eliminate delusive conditions and purify karmic obstructions. If all thoughts truly cease and the myriad conditions suddenly still, then the dust-like evil karma will dissolve in accord with the mind. Merely reciting without cultivation remains a cause of leakage—this is not the meaning of the scriptures. Not only the *Jade Scripture*, but in reciting any scripture, one must comprehend it thus.

Today, those who revere the Dao are many, and those who gather to recite scriptures are not few. Some venerate the Three Primes, some worship the Northern Dipper, some follow Buddhist teachings, some admire the ways of immortals—varied as they are. Yet they know only the efficacy of averting calamities and transcending adversity, not the great fruit of learning the Dao and aspiring to immortality. Thus, those who recite scriptures are many, but those who understand them are few.

Let us now dissect and clarify the essential purport of the Three Primes. For instance, people know that on Cloud Terrace Mountain, there are these Three Emperor Lords who issue commands from their capital assembly. Judging by appearances, Cloud Terrace lies in the Northern Sea, and the capital assembly is where the Three Sages govern. Such an interpretation clings to the letter! The Three Sages’ intent to instruct the world is utterly lost.

Only by seeking the meaning does one realize that the Three Sages are one with the Supreme Ultimate, inseparable from the person’s own body. The so-called sea is the ocean of wisdom-nature; Cloud Terrace Mountain is the square inch of the heart-ground, and the clouds are the radiance of wisdom manifesting within the heart. The capital assembly is this body’s numinous and wondrous palace, the source of responsive adaptability. Master Ziyu said, *"All things are complete within me—what else could this be if not the capital assembly?"*

Moreover, the Upper Prime’s nine qi are the yang qi of nine: in conduct, they correspond to wood; in time, to spring. Thus, the Upper Prime’s birth in the first month rides the qi of spring. In constancy, they correspond to benevolence, and benevolence governs compassion and love—hence its function is to bestow blessings. In the human body’s generative spirits, they are the qi of the Embryonic Life Origin.

The Middle Prime’s seven qi are the yang qi of seven: in conduct, they correspond to metal; in time, to autumn. Thus, the Middle Prime’s birth in the seventh month rides the qi of autumn. In constancy, they correspond to righteousness, and righteousness governs decisiveness—hence its function is to pardon sins. In the human body’s generative spirits, they are the qi of the Ethereal Soul’s Life Origin.

The Lower Prime’s five qi are the yang qi of five: in conduct, they correspond to water; in time, to winter. Thus, the Lower Prime’s birth in the tenth month rides the qi of water. In constancy, they correspond to wisdom, and wisdom dispels obstructions—hence its function is to resolve adversities. In the human body’s generative spirits, they are the qi of the Corporeal Soul’s Life Origin.

These Three Primes, within the human body, govern the palaces of the Mud Pill, the Cinnabar Field, and the Cavern Chamber. Whenever a person conceives a thought, they immediately know it, for their numinous brightness is interpenetrating. Those who attain the Dao are all recommended by the Three Primes to serve as the Supreme Lord’s privy councilors, officials in charge of the retribution of good and evil, weighing the merits of cultivators, demoting or promoting immortals, and overseeing all spirits. Their merit is great, their authority weighty.

Yet though the immortal scriptures have long been transmitted in the world, and many uphold them, their purport has never been fully elucidated, leaving people unaware. Now, I do not begrudge revealing these secrets, offering earnest and incisive instruction, so that all may recite and uphold them according to the method. When my heart aligns with the Emperor’s heart, the Three Prime Emperor Lords respond in accord with the mind: prayers for blessings bring blessings, supplications to avert misfortune dissolve misfortune.

Formerly, Fada recited the *Lotus Sutra* until he had completed three thousand copies. One day, he visited the Sixth Patriarch, who asked him about the sutra’s meaning. Fada could not answer. The Patriarch said, *"Your name is Dharma-Penetrating, yet you have not penetrated the Dharma."* The Patriarch then expounded the Buddha’s insight, and Fada awakened on the spot. He presented a verse:

*"Three thousand copies of the sutra recited,
Yet Cao Stream’s single phrase was forgotten."*

The Patriarch said, *"Previously, your recitation was merely turned by the sutra; you did not turn the sutra. Only now may you be called a monk who recites the sutra!"*

All you disciples present here, and all sentient beings of the future, when reciting any scripture, must be able to turn the scripture and not be turned by it—then it will be well.

**Chapter Thirty: Revering the Sacred Teachings**

The ancients composed books and established teachings to instruct later generations. When their intent was not fully expressed and words could not make it manifest, they employed parables to elucidate their meaning, allowing people to grasp what lay beyond words and speech. The Buddhist sutras say, *"All those with wisdom must understand through parables."* Thus, the texts of the Three Teachings abound in analogies. Yet their implied meanings are profound and distant, and people often misconstrue them.

Take the *Book of Changes*, for instance: the sage established images to exhaust meaning, and the *Appended Judgments* clarified fortune and misfortune. But its analogies are subtle and far-reaching. For example:
- To warn against yang reaching its extreme above, where fullness cannot last, it says, *"The dragon soars on high—there will be regret."*
- To warn against yin reaching its extreme above, leading to conflict with yang, it says, *"Dragons battle in the wild."*
- Its blood is dark and yellow; to warn against indecision, it speaks of *"a cartload of ghosts."*
- To warn against failing to see things through to the end, where success is rare, it says, *"The fox wets its tail."*

The words of the sixty-four hexagrams are largely analogical. Had the supreme sage not composed the *Image Commentaries* to illuminate their meaning, how would later Confucians have understood them?

Long ago, Lord Wen Shi gazed upon a purple vapor moving from east to west and knew an extraordinary person was near. He then encountered the Most High, who composed the two chapters of the *Dao and Virtue*, unfolding its secret principles—embracing the vast and omitting nothing, however small. Yet much of what it says about governing states and deploying troops is couched in metaphor. Even the Buddhist sutras adorn the Buddha-land as the pure ground of the mind.

When the Most High speaks of governing the state, he refers to ordering this body and mind. Even his references to warfare are metaphors for battling and repelling the demons of yin, overcoming the harms of selfish desires. As the *Changes* says, *"In the shock of campaigning against Gui Fang, after three years, reward comes from a great state."* The *Classic of Yin Convergence* states, *"Cut off profit at its source, and military strength is tenfold; reverse the cycle of day and night, and it is a hundredfold."* The meaning is the same!

As for the passage in the sutra:
*"To gather it, first expand it;
To weaken it, first strengthen it;
To abolish it, first promote it;
To seize it, first give it."*

This is the natural workings of heaven’s movement—like the sun casting a final glow before setting, the year turning suddenly warm before the cold, a person rallying strength before death, or a lamp flaring before going out. There is no difference in principle! Yet this principle is the most difficult for people to grasp, hence it is called *"subtle illumination."* It urges people to foresee impending fortune or misfortune in such matters and to first examine their incipient signs.

Worldly Confucians, failing to perceive this, mistake it for the affairs of rival states and the tactics of vertical and horizontal alliances—is this not a gross error? It also says, *"To reconcile great resentment, there will inevitably remain residual resentment. How can this be considered good?"* This is a sharp rebuke for those who grow complacent in petty peace and forget long-term prudence. It aligns entirely with the *Changes*, which says, *"The noble person reflects on calamity and guards against it beforehand."* Take the case of Zhou and Zheng exchanging hostages, only to later become enemies—is this not clear proof?

Worldly Confucians attribute this to the affairs of Goujian and Wu, unaware that this sutra was composed before the enmity between Wu and Yue arose. To misinterpret its words on reconciling resentment as referring to Wu and Yue is a mistake!

Later, the teachings of the *Dao and Virtue* degenerated into the Legalist school, and the words of the Most High were misconstrued as schemes and deceit—is this not a slander? Long ago, the Supreme Sage inquired about ritual from the Most High. Upon leaving, he said to his disciples, *"I observe that Laozi is like a dragon!"* Even one as sagely as the Supreme Sage praised him as *"like a dragon."* Yet later Confucians, with their narrow views, disparage him—are they not inferior even to the Supreme Sage?

In the past, Shu Sun Wu Shu slandered Confucius, and Duanmu Ci reproached him for not knowing his own measure. Those who today attack the Most High and denigrate the *Dao and Virtue* are likewise merely ignorant of their own limits. In the end, this does no harm to the Most High.

Yet among the dozens of commentators on the *Dao and Virtue*—even the eminent Master Kumarajiva, whose talent and insight surpassed others—his commentary on the *Dao and Virtue* still faulted it for not discussing the mind. How much more so for the rest? However, the sutra’s words, *"Do not display what may be desired, so the mind will not be confused,"* precisely warn against the deluded mind and urge guarding the true mind.

*"The sage has no constant mind; he takes the people’s mind as his mind."* Does this differ from the ancient Buddha’s verse, *"The mind is fundamentally unborn; it arises due to conditions"*?

The Most High also said, *"Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos."* This does not refer to the essence of ritual as thin or chaotic. Loyalty and trust are the foundation of ritual; what the world calls ritual is merely the superficial trappings of form. The *Book of Documents* says, *"The offerings are abundant in ceremony, but the ceremony does not extend to the substance."* This is what is meant by the thinning of loyalty and trust.

Wang Mang was humble and deferential to scholars, yet he usurped the Han throne—is this not the beginning of chaos? The Most High’s words serve as a mirror for later generations! Yet worldly Confucians accuse him of abandoning ritual and righteousness—is this not excessive?

In the past, I read the *Dao and Virtue* and deeply lamented my inability to fully penetrate its meaning. Though there were many commentaries, from Master He Shang onward, each clung to a single perspective, and few could reveal its depths. Fortunately, since attaining the truth, I have daily discussed it with the assembled sages and only now have I grasped its wonders.

Today, in expounding this teaching, I have briefly explained a few points to you, my disciples here present. Do not imitate worldly Confucians, recklessly slandering without restraint. As for the sutra’s passages that remain unexhaustively clarified, each of you should comprehend them through their meaning, not being bound by words and letters.

If one merely clings to the written words without grasping the fundamental intent of the Most High in establishing this teaching, it is no wonder that phrases like "the absolute teaching is without sorrow" are so often misconstrued. The Buddhist school misinterprets it as "no learning," while Confucian scholars slander it as the abandonment of poetry and books—nearly equating those who follow the Way with beasts of burden! You, my disciples, must revere and trust my words, free from the slightest partial knowledge or biased views. Rely on meaning, not on language; rely on wisdom, not on mere cognition. Through such inquiry, you may pervade the scriptures of immortals, penetrate the treasures of the sutras, and find no contradiction with the books of the Confucians.

**Chapter Thirty-One: Revering the Stars and the Dipper**

Within the cosmos, human life is endowed with the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, formed from the essence and blood of father and mother. Regardless of wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, all possess a luminous, awakened nature—the seed of kalpas past—while their fate is truly bound to Heaven. Heaven’s seven luminaries govern all celestial bodies, ordering creation and serving as the master of the human body. Longevity or early death, prosperity or adversity, fortune or misfortune—none are beyond their measure.

Yet the seven luminaries depend on the Jade Pivot and Jade Balance to maintain their proper course, for the marvel of this pivot and balance turns the four seasons and governs the kalpas. Thus, the sage emperors of old first commanded Xi and He to observe the celestial patterns, scrutinize the Jade Pivot and Jade Balance, and align the seven luminaries. Later sages established divine teachings for transformation, giving rise to rites of revering the stars and worshipping the Dipper, as well as ceremonies to avert calamity and resolve misfortune. The *Jade Pivot Sutra* teaches: *"To escape the three disasters and nine perils, bow in stillness at night to the Northern Asterism."* The Most High, in the Shu capital, transmitted the *True Sutra of the Five Dippers* and the *Heart Sutra of the Dipper Mother*. Thereafter, those who devised rites for the Dipper’s altar numbered in the dozens. Yet each based their rules on where they perceived divine transformation and response, resulting in varying degrees of detail.

For instance, the method of *"Revering the Two Stars of the Three Primes"* is exceedingly concise, but people often find it too brief and few practice it. Works like the *Great Brahma Unifying Chapter* are overly verbose, lacking profound subtlety. The *Dipper Rites* expounded by Emperor Wen suit scholars but fail to benefit the common folk. Thus, the gates of Dipper reverence are many, and throughout the ages, those who cultivated reality and attained the Dao—ascending to immortality through Dipper rites—are beyond count.

Yet, surveying the treasuries of scriptures, the Buddhist rites of reverence surpass those of our tradition. Even the path of Sanskrit sounds is more esoteric than our own rituals. Thus, in the Chan school, there are those who practice and attain clarity of mind and vision of nature. As for the Dipper rites transmitted in the world, they consist only of bowing ceremonies, lacking secret oral instructions. I once composed a verse:

*Many are the gates to Dipper rites,*
*Yet all converge like a needle’s thread.*
*Silent and still, in profound quietude,*
*In darkness, one meets the Star Lords.*

*Within the altar’s hush,*
*Let no chaos intrude.*
*First from the Sea of Origin’s cavity,*
*Then ascend to Kunlun’s height.*

*The Dipper Mother’s and Jade Emperor’s decrees,*
*When fused, reach the supreme vehicle.*
*Thus is the Golden Elixir attained,*
*And the Infant formed in an instant.*

This Dipper formula has been transmitted for ages, yet none practice it. For people know only of the Northern Dipper in the Palace of the Jade Pivot, unaware that within their own bodies lies a Jade Dipper, which daily circulates through the entire form, flowing through the hundred vessels from midnight to the hour of the pig, never ceasing for a moment. Only those of superior insight first recognize their life-star’s Dipper, never departing from its movement within the body, and thus attain the Dao and achieve reality.

Yet this can only be spoken of to those of the highest capacity, for only they can practice it. Why is the Northern Dipper within the body? The White Jade Tortoise Terrace is the numinous terrace of the heart, and the divine Xiezhi’s precious seat is the heart’s spiritual transformation. The Jade Pivot’s treasury is the heart’s emptiness and numinosity, through which the five qi are mobilized! As the alchemical classics say: *"Why seek midnight at the edge of the sky? Within the body, the yang arises of itself!"* Thus, at midnight, when the first yang stirs, it is no different from the Dipper’s handle turning. At this hour, one who reverently worships the Dipper, riding the initial arising of yang, emulates Heaven’s ceaseless movement, and practices in accordance with meaning.

Now, for those who revere the Dipper, I proclaim a swift, essential, and secret method: Before the rite, fast and purify with utmost sincerity. At night, first enter the Dipper chamber, still all thoughts, and strike the teeth nine times. Stand upright, facing north, and bow in reverence. Envision the golden countenance of the Heavenly Mother descending from above, the Nine Emperors and Two Sovereigns standing to her left and right, and the assembled sages arrayed around. Empty all distractions and abide in silent concentration.

Then rise to perform the rites. The mind must be utterly focused, the spirit utterly still, the qi utterly solemn, the demeanor utterly dignified, the appearance utterly reverent, the voice utterly even, the tone utterly harmonious, the resonance utterly clear. Speed and slowness must follow measure, advance and retreat must follow rule, kneeling and bowing must follow rhythm, and rising and pausing must follow decorum. Whether at home, in a temple, alone, or in a communal gathering, all should proceed thus. Discipline body and mind, allowing no disturbance.

First bow to the august titles, then recite the Sanskrit sounds. Now, the Sanskrit sounds of the Dipper Mother, as found in the Buddhist and Daoist canons, number over a dozen, making them difficult to recite in full. Among those recorded in the treasuries, none are more essential than the *Heart Mantra*. You, my disciples, listen carefully, as I shall recite it:

The *Heart Mantra of the Dipper Mother* begins with *"Namo,"* drawn out slightly longer. Two Sanskrit syllables are rendered as two Chinese characters, yet chanted as one flowing sound.

The *Heart Mantra of the Northern Dipper* states:

Chant the characters beside the "mouth" radical in sequence, with *lo*, *ju*, *hong* following the same pattern. Exclude the "mouth" radical when chanting, with characters such as *na* and others following likewise. This is the *Great Brahman Heart Mantra of the Northern Dipper*, the hidden name of the great demon lords of the Three Realms. The Most High proclaimed it to instruct those who cultivate the true Dao. If one recites it without ceasing, all demon hosts will submit in awe, the hundred evils will flee, malevolent ghosts will be annihilated, and no calamity shall arise.

This Sanskrit sound is most wondrous and subtle, capable of curing all chronic and stubborn illnesses, and of averting all baleful stars and malignant influences. Should one’s life palace or fate be in disarray—whether afflicted by yearly misfortune, monthly calamity, clashes, conflicts, or punitive encounters—recitation of this mantra may dissolve and dispel them. The key lies in sincerity and reverence, for then the marvel of resonance will be most efficacious and divine.

The human face and head possess seven apertures, which inwardly correspond to the heart. The seven *zhen*-spirits of the *po* receive their vitality from the Dipper. Thus, the apertures of the Dipper originally connect with the apertures of the heart, and the human heart is none other than the celestial heart. Above every person’s head shines the Three Terraces and the Northern Dipper, which record their transgressions. For above the crown of every person’s head, there exists an inherent luminosity of self-nature—whether red, purple, yellow, or white—its hue varying. Only those of the Dao possess a light that is lofty and vast. Those who do good emit red or yellow light, while evildoers reveal black qi above their crowns, their nature-light obscured and unable to manifest. Thus, the Northern Dipper, observing the presence or absence of this light above their heads, determines the goodness or wickedness of each person. Yet this crown-light is known only to the divine; mortals remain unaware of it.

The method of worshipping the Dipper, though not equal to the refinement of the Golden Elixir, may still—if practiced alongside it—lead to liberation from the cycle of rebirth and attainment of immortality. Thus, the *Heart Sutra of the Dipper Mother* states: *"For those who refine the Great Elixir of Nine Returns and Seven Reversions, recitation of this mantra brings sudden awakening to the subtle barrier, the numinous light appears before them, and vitality naturally flourishes."* This is akin to the Buddhist practice of reciting *"Amitābha Buddha"* to seek rebirth in the Pure Land, both yielding wondrous fruition. Is this not a swift and joyous path to transcendence and realization?

*Chapter Thirty-Two: On the Unification of Cultivation and Attainment*

The Heavenly Worthy says: "What I now expound are the daily, constant classics—the essential Dao of cultivating truth and the stepping-stones to sagehood. They are neither abstruse nor recondite, nor do they contain anything strange or uncanny. The superior person may practice them, and even those of middling or lesser capacity will find nothing difficult in them. Yet though the matter is not inherently difficult, from the human perspective, it is ever deemed not easy. Long ago, Chan Master Wu Chao said of the words *'Refrain from all evil, practice all good'*: a three-year-old child knows them, yet a hundred-year-old elder cannot put them into practice. Precisely this—what is not difficult in itself—is what no one finds easy to do. As Gongsun Chou said: *'Lofty and splendid, it seems like ascending to heaven.'*

But for those who uphold these teachings, the first requirement is to generate the *'mind of right faith.'* Knowing that the three karmas must be purified, one is cautious in demeanor, circumspect in speech, and purifies through faith to its utmost. Knowing that heaven and earth must be revered, one rises at dawn without daring to jest or waver, and reverence gives rise to faith. In serving one’s lord, one should be loyal: steadfast in one’s duties, loyalty becomes the vessel of faith. In serving one’s parents, one should be filial: rising early with devotion, filial piety perfects faith. Through faith, husband and wife achieve harmony; through faith, kinship is deepened. In the way of friendship, profound faith fulfills human relationships. In following a teacher’s instruction, one reverently obeys with faith. Though ghosts and spirits are subtle, faith must not deceive them; though cause and effect are minute, faith must not treat them as false. The words of sages must not be slighted with faith; the teachings of buddhas and immortals must not be taken lightly with faith.

The second requirement is to generate the *'mind of steadfastness.'* Do not begin with diligence only to slacken in the end. Do not, upon seeing something different, think of changing course. Do not, fearing others’ ridicule, alter your original path. Do not, swayed by frivolous opinions, abandon your pure integrity. Do not, deeming good too small to be beneficial, fail to practice it. Do not, deeming evil too small to cause harm, fail to cast it aside. Do not draw boundaries to limit yourself. Do not advance sharply only to retreat swiftly.

The third requirement is to generate the *'mind of perpetuity.'* The *Book of Changes* says: *'If one does not maintain one’s virtue constantly, one may incur shame.'* Thus, a rope a thousand fathoms long can sever wood, and a stream a yard long can pierce stone—all through duration. As the saying goes: *'A trickle unceasing becomes a river; a hair’s breadth unremoved will require an axe-handle.'* Is this not the result of long perseverance? If one can generate these three minds—from beginning to end without interruption, ever mindful and unwavering—then bodily diligence and enduring effort will transform the dull into the enlightened and the weak into the strong. With this, entering the Dao is not difficult; with this, aspiring to immortality is not difficult! One may save the kalpa, dispel calamities, pray for blessings, resolve adversities, preserve life, prolong existence, realize truth, and attain sagehood—all through this scripture!

Yet this scripture gathers the essence of Confucianism and Buddhism, embodying the principles of the Three Teachings. Some pedantic scholars may falsely accuse my words of conflating Confucianism with Buddhism or Buddhism with Daoism, giving rise to ridicule or slander, for they do not comprehend the principle that the Three Teachings share a single source. Therefore, I have cited Confucian classics, Buddhist sutras, and Daoist scriptures side by side, uniting the three into one, to leave behind these instructions and admonitions. You, my assembled disciples, and all sentient beings of the world and future ages—if you can deeply believe my words, savor their meaning, and engage in true cultivation and realization, not only will my wish be fulfilled, but even the sagely heart of the August Emperor who expounds the Dao will not be disappointed."

Thereupon, the assembled immortals, having heard this, bowed their heads in reverence and praise, and recited a verse:

*"How wondrous!"*

The Great Preceptor of Primordial Origin
Expounds the grand canon of cultivating the true,
With a compassionate heart widely delivering all in the final kalpa—
The Dharma-wheel turns across the Ganges’ sands of worlds.

Its origin traces back to the primal chaos,
Where the Dao of Heaven shines bright and its principle most manifest.
Serving Heaven relies wholly on a reverent heart,
Loyalty and filial piety unfold from the mind’s core.

Brothers and kin share the same qi in mutual affection,
Husband and wife should harmonize the home, as the *Odes* esteem.
Trust and friendship embody the virtue of shared illumination,
Honoring teachers and revering the Dao are human relations’ norm.

The Five Constants, unmarred, form cultivation’s foundation;
Within, preserve the true origin, stabilizing essence and qi.
If one further accumulates merit and piles up deeds,
Doing good brings the greatest joy—this each must reflect.

The Three Teachings have ever sprung from one source,
For the nature of mind originally belongs alike to sage and fool.
Cease saying cause and effect lack evidence—
Has good or evil ever lacked its fortune or misfortune?

Evil brings its own calamity, good its own blessing,
Ghosts and spirits’ retribution unfolds layer upon layer.
The immortals’ scriptures and Buddhist sutras make this abundantly clear—
Do not imitate fools who, knowing no taboos,
Slander Buddhas and immortals with reckless tongues,
For the hells’ bitter retribution is the worst of destinies.

Those who awaken should swiftly change their strings and alter their course,
Following and believing the Heavenly Worthy’s words.
With fervent diligence, strive earnestly to cultivate—
Seek the Great Elixir’s Dao with wholehearted devotion,
And delve diligently into the jade-classics’ depths.
The work is not distant—it lies within the mind’s core.

I have heard the Transcendent Master’s profound teaching,
And unconsciously leap with joy in my heart.
May all beings in the final kalpa who wish to escape rebirth
Hold fast to these words,
Reciting and upholding them unceasingly, day after day.
When the nature of mind is realized, all matters are complete.

This scripture encompasses all the Daoist canons—
To transcend the mundane, only the mind’s practice suffices.
When practice perfects the wondrous truth, it becomes like a bright mirror,
Returning to the origin and restoring the One Supreme Ultimate.
Even if the void were shattered, what would remain?
In truth and emptiness alike, the Dao is but One.

Thereupon, the assembled immortals having finished their verses, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the gathered disciples:
“All of you, my children, should each follow these teachings and practice them, widely propagating them.”

The Heavenly Worthy having finished expounding the scripture, rose from the Dharma seat. Thereupon, celestial blossoms rained down, fragrant jade incense wafted through the void, phoenixes and cranes soared, and auspicious mists filled the chamber. The assembled disciples bowed their heads in reverence, received the teachings with faith, and withdrew to practice accordingly.

**Eulogy:**
The wondrous essence of the Three in One,
Encompasses all scriptures in its scope.
Tracing the source to its root, it points the way of practice—
Sincere and pure, one worships the stars.
Rescuing the kalpa, dispelling misfortune,
Far and near rejoice in ascending peace.

**Yixingzi’s Heart Mantra of the Dipper Mother**
The Heart Mantra of the Northern Dipper, expounded:

The Dipper Mother, a native of India during the Dragon Han Primordial Kalpa, transmitted Sanskrit mantras akin to those of the Buddha, all belonging to the Sanskrit sounds and script. As the people of the Eastern Land did not recognize Sanskrit characters, earlier masters and perfected ones transcribed them using Confucian characters. Yet these transcriptions, unlike Confucian texts, proved difficult to pronounce correctly. Often, the same sound was rendered differently—
for the Sanskrit tones are identical, while the annotated characters may vary slightly in length.
A "combined sound" refers to a single original Sanskrit character translated into two Chinese characters, yet still chanted as one continuous sound.

When Patriarch Lü later expounded this mantra, he revealed the Dipper Mother’s dharmic form, saying:
“She has four heads and eight arms, with the countenance of a celestial being. Clad in a celestial azure cloud-brocade Dharma robe, atop her head rests a golden pagoda of nine tiers. From its summit blooms the *manyu-pātāla* flower, called the ‘Flower of No Sorrow,’ whose hue surpasses the *udumbara* and whose fragrance is unmatched. Her two central hands form a mudra, while the other six hold: one the sun, one the moon, one a halberd with a banner inscribed in gold with ‘Supreme Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor,’ one a vajra, one a bow, and one an arrow. Seated upon a lotus throne, beneath her is a white jade tortoise dais. To its left and right stand the Heavenly Kings *Yufan* and *Miaofan*, attended by ten thousand sages and a thousand perfected ones.”

Here, for clarity in Sanskrit pronunciation and phrasing, the above account is appended.

**Preface to the *Hán Sān Yǔ Lù* (Record of Han San’s Words), *Complete Works of Patriarch Lü* (Volume 28)**
Of old, the Confucians had their *Yǔ Lèi* (Classified Sayings), and the Buddhists their *yǔ lù* (recorded sayings), wherein disciples recorded their masters’ answers to questions—every word and phrase cherished, lest they be forgotten, to aid in their studies. Yet few such works endure. The *Hán Sān Yǔ Lù*, though but commonplace words of daily use, fully embodies the profound and subtle Dao. For the Dao is complete within oneself, thus its teachings are intimate and savory. Its discourse resembles the *Yǔ Lèi* of the Luoyang and Min schools, yet no other preacher or lecturer could approach even a fraction of its depth.

The Emei Immortal Master remarked: “Each drop is sweet dew, seeping into the heart and spleen. What distinction is there between scripture and recorded sayings? Truly, these are words of wisdom!”

The recorders were: Gentleman Huang Chengshu, Gentleman Wu Yishu, and Gentleman Li Wushu.
The compilers were: Gentleman Sun Shoushu and my nephew Yun Cheng.
The continuator was myself, along with Gentleman Huang.

In recent years, in Qian (Guizhou), we gathered the accumulated teachings and scriptural expositions from Chu (Hubei), combining them with the earlier records into one volume. Yet the *Hán Sān Yǔ Lù* contains countless such sayings, most now scattered and lost, never fully compiled—what a pity!

**The *Hán Sān Yǔ Lù***

Patriarch Lü said:
“The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The Dao that cannot be spoken, yet is spoken, is called the *Dao-fu* (Enclosure of the Dao).
The Dao that cannot be practiced, yet is practiced, is named the *Dao-du* (Moth of the Dao).
Subtle! Subtle!
Before heaven and earth existed, where did the Dao reside?
Once heaven and earth came to be, where is the Dao found?
It enters the nine abysses, penetrates the nine heavens, encompasses the six directions, and revolves through the two poles.
The wise have no use for their brightness, the skillful no place to apply their strength.
With clumsiness, one conceals it; with foolishness, one guards it; with clarity, one contains it; with stillness, one nurtures it—then, with spirit, one illuminates it.
Thus, to reach the utmost in spirit, one must nurture it.
To attain nurturance, one must contain it.
To achieve containment, one must first have steadfastness.
The more steadfast the guard, the deeper the concealment.
Only through concealment can one guard it; only through guarding can one contain it.
When nurturance is complete, the spirit becomes unfathomable.
Yet this great Dao truly lies in non-action.
It cannot be called void, nor can it be called real—void and real alike are the supreme Dao.
When lesser scholars hear these words, they mock their profundity.
What recourse is there against their mockery?
Those who know not the void—how can they embody the real?
Those who know not the real—how can they embody the void?
Clinging to traces without transformation, grasping at forms in pursuit,
some practice unlawful arts, veering into heterodox paths,
stuffing their chests with delusions, failing to awaken to the Great *Tai Xu*.
How could they know that the subtle and profound lie not apart from the lord of the heart?
The cunning play with deceit, seeking shortcuts for swift attainment;
the clever flaunt their private knowledge, imagining divergent paths to the realm of truth.
Thus they devise all manner of alchemical and refinement techniques, drifting ever further from the Dao!
Though they may speak of subtle words to seek the heart’s truth,
if true effort is lacking, it is but empty talk—how does it touch the Dao?

You, my disciples, must bring forth utmost sincerity, eradicate self-interest, and let cunning and cleverness perish.
With clumsiness, conceal it; with foolishness, guard it; with clarity, contain it; with stillness, nurture it—then, with spirit, illuminate it.
Over time, as familiarity grows, the Great Elixir will form, and you will share the merit of the highest sages!
But if profit and desire remain unabandoned, the ego unremoved,
and you recklessly discuss the great Dao, you will only create obstacles.
That lesser scholars do not practice this is deeply lamentable!”

The Dao—I cannot know it, nor can I speak of it.
Since I cannot know it, my knowledge is of no use;
since I cannot speak of it, my words are of no use.
My knowledge is of no use, for there is nothing to know;
my words are of no use, for there is nothing to say.
Since there is nothing to say, there is truly nothing to be said;
since there is nothing to know, there is truly nothing to be known.
Yet if one still seeks to know where nothing can be known,
what one knows are but the Dao’s peripheral branches;
if one still forces words where nothing can be said,
what one says are but the Dao’s superficial layers.
Subtle indeed! Subtle indeed!
Form yet no form, image yet no image.
It cannot be known, yet nothing is not known—this is true knowing.
It cannot be spoken, yet nothing is not spoken—this is the ultimate word.
Without knowing, without words, the Dao is thus realized.
If the Dao is thus realized, what more is there to say?
What more is there to know?
No knowing, no knowing; no words, no words—this is the wondrous Dao.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Sincerity begets clarity; clarity begets sincerity.
The wondrous secret of the Golden Elixir—
a single, unbroken, and steadfast essence.
Nurture your spirit,
in purity, stillness, emptiness, and silence.
Vast and undifferentiated,
never forget your original face.
Mountains green, waters clear—all share the same principle.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

For those who study the Dao, first cultivate qi.
If qi is coarse, the heart becomes restless;
if the heart is restless, courage swells;
if courage swells, human desires run wild;
if desires run wild, the heart of Dao is unsettled;
if the heart of Dao is unsettled,
all manner of evil causes and conditions converge.
Thus, cultivating qi is the essential work of entering the Dao.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

The Great Dao is utterly impartial, its workings subtle and wondrous.
Even those burdened by form and qi may awaken and comprehend.
Yet if one indulges in self-interest and cunning,
obstacles arise, and confusion deepens.
To penetrate that single point of the pass—
the Three Treasures are but husks;
to break free from the thousand layers of entanglement—
the six senses are but karmic bonds.
Turn sharply back—
the vast sea stretches on, yet one reaches the other shore;
act swiftly—
the boundless void clears, and the azure sky appears.
Only knowing to fret over the body’s future,
heedless of compounding errors!
Striving to build foundations for descendants,
like oxen and horses toiling,
accumulating grave transgressions in the mortal world,
amidst clashing blades and spears.
Know this: a hundred years is but a fleeting span—
how can the body endure for a thousand ages?
Best to rein in the mind-steed and heart-ape,
and apply effort to subdue the dragon and tame the tiger.
If one does not focus the mind,
all polishing is in vain;
even if one recites scriptures daily,
it is but wasted breath!
From here, each must seek the upward path—
do not remain lost in the common. Strive on,
for I shall not speak again.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Master Xiao Xiu-shu admonished:
“A boundless expanse—where is the shore?
Where is the place of death?
You fear you cannot reach that place of death!”

"What use is abandoning the body? Better to seek the True Person at this very moment! Barren Chan is of no benefit—you must first sit in stillness for three months, passing a hundred days and nights here. Only then may you see how it is, and only then can you reach that place of death.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Master asked Liu Shou-shu, “Can you grasp even one or two points from my words? Then speak of one or two.”

Shou-shu replied, “Is it the Primordial?”

The Master answered, “The One is not the Primordial. Has the Primordial ever been confined to the word ‘One’? Since the first stroke cleaved the heavens, it has already fallen into the lesser vehicle. Do you also understand the meaning in my writings? Speak of it in terms of skin and flesh.”

“Strip away the skin and flesh, and the bones and marrow appear.”

The Master further asked Shou-shu, “Explain the meaning of emptiness and fullness!”

Shou-shu replied, “Emptiness is the Primordial.”

The Master said, “Where does the Primordial stand?”

“This is the foundation of the Primordial, not the Primordial itself. Only when essence, qi, and spirit are set aside does the Primordial arise. Refining the Three Treasures is the work of the posterior heaven—when one reaches the Primordial, such efforts are no longer needed! The Primordial is a state of utter forgetfulness and nothingness, where not even a trace of thought can intrude. The moment a single thought arises, it is no longer the Primordial!”

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

"If any among you remain unclear, present a question on a single point."

Wu Yishu responded, "When first beginning practice, how should this heart-mind be employed?"

The Master answered, "At the very outset, this heart-mind must be singular, its attention fixed upon the crucial pass. Once practice has begun, however, one attains its subtleties. Then this heart-mind must be empty, with no object of attention. Such is the secret of the Great Elixir—thus, thus!"

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

The Master asked, "After the Infant is formed, what stage has been reached?"

At that moment, Shoushu mistakenly replied, "That is not what I asked you!"

"After this formation, what stage is attained?"

"After its formation, one has already departed from the posterior heaven and glimpsed the time of the Primordial—do you understand? The Primordial is non-doing. Once the Infant is formed, it is the Primordial, and one must practice non-doing. If the heart-mind does not reach the state of utter forgetfulness, thoughts will arise at the slightest touch—this is not non-doing! If it is not non-doing, the Three Calamities will arise."

Shoushu asked about "the principle of movement and stillness." The answer was: "Without movement, there is stagnation; without stillness, there is chaos. In every movement and every stillness, what is precious is spontaneity! Yin and yang are the spontaneity of movement and stillness. The cyclical progression of the four seasons is also the spontaneity of movement and stillness. As for the Supreme Ultimate, it is the spontaneity of movement reaching its extreme and turning to stillness, and stillness reaching its extreme and turning to movement. Only the Non-Ultimate is without movement or stillness!"

Shoushu further inquired about the teachings from the *Three Grades*, seeking guidance from the lofty perfected ones. The answer was: "How could the Infant, once formed, still not comprehend the state of utter emptiness? However, once the Infant is formed, one must not hastily allow it to leave its dwelling. It may be nurtured for ten or twenty years, or even thirty or fifty years—only then is it permissible. As for the method of nurturing, it lies solely in non-doing. Otherwise, it will be difficult to escape the Three Calamities! You disciples may cross-reference my words with this text."

The Great Dao is nameless, the Great Dao is formless.
Seek it in the midst of nearness and distance,
Attain it between intention and non-intention.
Forget the self, forget things,
Without sound, without scent.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Our gate is vast, our precepts most strict;
Our Way is impartial, our commandments most solemn!
Those who follow the dharma-bridges of our gate,
Who uphold the precept-practices of our teaching,
Must make heart and mouth as one.
With the Dao-mind firm and true,
Retire to secluded dwelling,
Uninvolved in worldly affairs,
Free from self-imposed toil and disturbance,
Loosening bonds and casting off fetters.
Do not seek glory only to invite disgrace,
But strive to abandon the perverse and return to the upright.
Abide in the feminine, nurture the primordial,
And the Dao will attain true stability.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

To the monks of Ling Shan Monastery, it was asked:
"Where lies Ling Shan?
Do you know the dharma-gate of your own tradition?"

"Neither bound to place nor confined by thought—
Ling Shan is not within the city,
nor in the Western Regions,
nor even within the heart!"

"Do you dwell in the place of Ling Shan?"
"Dwelling in Ling Shan, yet not knowing Ling Shan!"

"Where then does Ling Shan dwell?"
"Within white jade light, pavilions appear—
Dust upon dust, realm upon realm, vain to pursue.
In the tip of a brush, mountains and rivers lie vast—
Where else may Ling Shan be cherished?

Speak not idly, make no contrivance:
Before your eyes, fragrant blossoms and jade candles—
All is the Western Paradise."

"I shall tell you—listen well!
Your gate is fundamentally empty; my Dao even more so.
Empty of what is empty—what is there to investigate?
Know this: this Dao emerges from one source,
returns to one cave.

Seeking life in stacks of old paper—
how different from a fool recounting dreams!
Thus, my Dao attains perfection in non-attachment of mind;
your gate exalts non-attachment to phenomena.
Yet to know non-attachment to phenomena
is still to harbor mind.

Why not empty this mind as well?
Would that not be most excellent!

Of late, Chan monks and seekers of learning—
how do they differ from those who toil in side gates,
wasting spirit in vain?
No true fruit is borne!

I tell you: ancient Buddhas and immortals of old
all applied effort in the real!
Had the Snow Mountains lacked six years of ascetic practice,
how could the sight of a star evoke a smile?

Today’s cultivators merely sit upon meditation cushions,
repeating one or two phrases—
the dregs of wild foxes’ spittle—
indulging in reckless thought!
The simple and sincere pass their lives in emptiness;
the sharp-tongued and clever sport nimble jaws.
They fabricate a few phrases of ‘mouth Chan,’
deceiving later students with sermons and Dharma halls,
thus corrupting the ancestral gate of the ancient Buddhas.
Alas! Alas!"

Such matters are self-evident to the enlightened, yet obscure to the benighted. Even within our own Daoist tradition, those who speak endlessly of "cultivation" fill the world—yet how many truly grasp the principle of emptiness and fullness? You have entered my gate solely to become a vessel of the Way. If you serve with sincere reverence, you will find your own path to mastery—no need to blindly endure another’s painful blows!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

When the spirit is not empty, it grows rigid and inert, like a stagnant canal. If it does not decay, it will soon turn foul in color and taste. Only through emptiness does it remain unobstructed; unobstructed, it clings to nothing, flowing freely and vividly as an empty valley: a single cry echoes, and a chorus answers. Thus, the human spirit must be empty yet undying—only then can one penetrate the profound secrets of the mysterious pass and attain the wondrous transformations of spiritual communion.

From ancient times to the present, those who study the Dao have achieved the coalescence of the infant and the manifestation of the yang spirit—yet all ultimately prove useless! They fail to comprehend the meaning of *"the valley spirit does not die."* The five thousand words of the *Daodejing* distill their subtlety into this single phrase. What profundity lies in mere "refining nature and refining form"? They are but dregs!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Someone asked about "water and fire, Kan and Li."
I replied: "What is water? What is fire? What are Kan and Li? If you say, *'The sun and moon are the great elixir forged by heaven and earth,'* then ponder this: what are the sun and moon? Let me clarify for you.

The sun is the Great Yang, yet within the Great Yang resides a single speck of yin essence. Without this speck of yin, the sun’s warmth would fail to nurture life, scorching all things to ruin. The moon is the Great Yin, yet within the Great Yin lies a single spark of yang qi. Without this spark of yang, the moon would have corporeality but no spirit, unable to illuminate the world. Thus, though the moon is pure yin, it does not depart from yang.

The sun and moon, divided into yin and yang, with yang uniting with yin and yin intermingling with yang—all arise from the qi of heaven and earth, intertwined and harmonized. Therefore, Daoists model the elixir upon the sun and moon, take heaven and earth as their furnace, yin and yang as their firing times, and the primordial Great Ultimate as the original essence of the self.

The meaning of Kan and Li is the same. Why speak not of Qian and Kun but of Kan and Li? Qian is solitary yang, Kun is solitary yin; solitary yang cannot generate, and solitary yin cannot grow. Thus, Daoists do not refer to Qian and Kun as the *head of the elixir*, but to Kan and Li.

Within Kan, a single yang resides amid two yins—yin envelops yang, yielding the power of generation. Within Li, a single yin resides amid two yangs—yang envelops yin, yielding the capacity to accomplish. Therefore, Daoists first employ Kan and Li to align the primordial elixir, then extract the single yang from Kan and merge it with the single yin within Li, transforming it into pure Qian and restoring the original primordial state.

Yet people only know Kan as water and Li as fire, taking their interaction as the secret of the elixir—unaware that it is nothing other than the single qi of the self. Qi possesses both yin and yang; the unenlightened fail to distinguish their intermingling. Thus, those who study the Dao must first discern the boundaries of yin and yang, then borrow from one to supplement the other.

Essence and spirit are not separate from qi—hence Daoists speak not of *essence and spirit* but solely of *qi*."

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Someone asked, "How does one distinguish yin and yang qi?"
I replied: "In detail: the clear is yang, the turbid is yin; exhalation is yang, inhalation is yin; ascent is yang, descent is yin; above is yang, below is yin; left is yang, right is yin; heart qi is yang, kidney qi is yin; liver wood is yang, lung metal is yin. In summary: the entire human body is yin, save for a single speck of yang essence!"

Another asked, "Where does this speck of yang essence reside?"
I replied: "This is the true seed of immortality and Buddhahood, the true face, the true lifeline. Such matters are not to be lightly discussed."

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Someone asked about the essential meaning of *xing* (nature).
I replied: "Before heaven and earth existed, this *xing* already was. With this *xing*, there came this *qi*. Thus *xing* is the heart-mind of heaven and earth, and *qi* is the body of heaven and earth. How could there be *xing* without *qi*? Or *qi* without *xing*? Yet in heaven and earth, one cannot speak solely of *xing*, nor solely of *qi*. If one says heaven and earth are nothing but *xing*, then what are the high and the low? If one speaks of heaven and earth only in terms of *qi*, then what governs their ceaseless movement, their balance without collapse or fall? Thus when speaking of heaven and earth, one can only say *Dao*. In this way, both *xing* and *qi* are encompassed.

Man receives the *qi* of heaven and earth to be born. With this *xing*, there comes this *qi*; with this *qi*, there comes this form. Without this *qi*, the form dissolves. But without this *xing*, what would govern the *qi*? *Qi* is like a dwelling, *xing* like its master. Once you find the master, there is no need to inquire further about the dwelling. Thus to see *xing* and clarify the heart-mind, there is no need to speak further of refining *qi* or cultivating form.

For beginners, however, who have not yet recognized the dwelling, how can they know the master? Thus to seek the master, one must first visit the dwelling. Once the dwelling is found, one will naturally encounter the master. Yet there are those who find the dwelling but do not recognize the master, or whose master does not respond. This is why I sweep away all else to reveal the *xing* of heaven as the highest aim.

But for beginners, one must first preserve the form. If one does not investigate the vital mechanisms, nurture *qi*, and refine the form, then when the dwelling collapses, the master will have no place to stand. For those disciples who seek a swift path, once my *Three Grades* is completed, follow its methods in practice: the form will be stabilized, the *qi* made whole, and *xing* revealed. Without the labor of nine cycles, the infant spirit will naturally emerge, with wondrous transformations beyond measure."

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Stillness of sound is not as good as stillness of body; stillness of body is not as good as stillness of heart-mind. When the heart-mind is still, all sounds are forgotten; when the heart-mind is still, all sounds are silenced. If the heart-mind is not still, even if one sits in meditation all day, hearing no sounds, the heart-mind has already entered the midst of a myriad sounds and cannot attain a moment of clarity.

Thus those who cultivate the Dao must first cultivate the heart-mind. To begin cultivating the heart-mind, one need not be in a quiet room—it is precisely amid the bustle of activity that one can make an effort, testing the movement and stillness of the heart-mind. If one who cultivates the heart-mind does not start from the midst of activity but seeks only in stillness, then when encountering movement, the previous stillness of the heart-mind will unknowingly be lost. Moreover, when in life is there ever a truly still day? It is best to silently simulate stillness amid the tumult and clamor.

In daily life and eating, one should follow conditions as they come, without deliberate contrivance, lest the heart-mind of the Dao be disturbed."

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Generally, those who cultivate the path do not go beyond cultivating the heart-mind, which governs essence, *qi*, and spirit. The worthy who aspire to sagehood do not go beyond this heart-mind; Daoists who study immortality do not go beyond this heart-mind; Buddhists who seek Buddhahood do not go beyond this heart-mind. The sages of the Three Teachings, in transmitting their teachings to later students, have taught nothing but the cultivation of this one heart-mind.

The heart-mind is the Supreme Ultimate, containing both movement and stillness. Before movement arises, it is the primordial; after movement begins, it falls into the posterior. Thus in utmost stillness, emotions and perceptions are extinguished, and one is truly in the state of the Limitless. But the more one moves, the further one strays, and all guest dust becomes thieves through the six senses.

Thus whether Confucian, Daoist, or Buddhist, though they establish different schools, none depart from the heart-mind in their teachings. My own practice lies in gathering the Three Treasures to form the numinous embryo and opening the five mechanisms to explore the secrets of the Three Pure Ones. Yet in tracing its origin, it all comes down to this heart-mind.

If the heart-mind is not still, it is not empty; if not empty, it is not numinous; if not numinous, it is inert and dull, no different from external things. How then can one form the numinous embryo and complete the Great Elixir?

The Most High taught that the root of practice is clarity and stillness—guarding the feminine, closing the self, and letting the empty valley give birth to spirit. A thousand words, ten thousand phrases, all teach nothing but the cultivation of the heart-mind. All the manipulations and techniques are the inventions of later generations, ever more contrary to the Dao and ever further from it.

Now, in expounding this text, though I dare not claim to have fully revealed the subtleties of the Great Dao, I speak from the heart-mind, uniting the Three Teachings in a single return. May later students not mistake the source of the Dao, and may they not be left without a starting point. Perhaps this may offer some small benefit."

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

The *Three Grades* is a wondrous text I leave to the world, a Dharma-eye for the Three Teachings, encompassing immortals, Confucians, Buddhists, and Daoists. There is no need to seek another path—this alone is the bridge. Alas, in this vast universe, there are none who inquire of the Dao, for they do not know to study it closely.

If there are those of sincere seeking, with pure karmic roots and firm Dao-qi, what need have they for a teacher? At the utterance of a word, they will awaken. One may know that the merit of this text is equal to the *Jade Scripture*. Even the Heavenly Sovereign would treat it with reverence. Thus its circulation and wide dissemination will bring boundless blessings, penetrating earth and heaven, and all will receive its benefits—not merely to pass through the calamities of an age."

Moreover, by widely cultivating good affinities, one may rely upon this text to transcend and realize liberation across ten thousand kalpas—truly a sacred writ for the salvation of the world and all future generations. You must not regard it lightly or treat it as common.

The perfected one does good as the great void does: upon passing, it dissolves without residue.
The worthy one does good through diligent effort, unwavering over time, and may thus attain utmost sincerity.
The middling one does good as bubbles or illusions do: now arising, now vanishing, now appearing, now concealed.
The lesser one does good only for blessings, yet when turned inward, the heart knows this is not so.

You, my disciples, heed these words:
Cultivate your minds and intentions, and do not indulge in greed or delusion.
Examine yourself and take responsibility; be sincere and steadfast.
Follow my teachings, and you will naturally attain your time.

---

Good arises from the heart, and so does evil.
When the heart does good, do not seek karmic reward.
When the heart does evil, likewise do not invoke karmic retribution.
For to seek karmic reward is to plant the root of evil.

If one performs one good deed, or ten, or a hundred, and secretly thinks, *"Will Heaven reward me?"*—should no reward come, they will deem good deeds futile and abandon them.
If one commits one evil act, or ten, or a hundred, and secretly thinks, *"Will Heaven punish me?"*—should no punishment come, they will deem evil harmless and abandon repentance.

When one wishes to do good, they must not do good *as* good; if they see it as good, their heart is not truly good. What they do as good resides solely in the heart.
Examine your heart: if an act harms neither human feeling nor principle, it is good; if it harms either, it is not.
Good and evil need not manifest in deeds—a single good thought is inexhaustibly good!
A single evil thought is inexhaustibly evil!

Thus, the method of seeking goodness lies in turning inward to the heart. When the heart is still, wisdom’s light arises of itself—what need is there for other schemes?

---

The heart of the Dao must be firm; the heart of cultivation must be sincere. If it is neither firm nor sincere, external demons will entangle you, and even if you have affinity with the Dao, obstacles will multiply.

---

On the qin, Xun Qiao was instructed in forbearance:
*"The Way of the qin is replete with wondrous subtleties!
When playing, the heart must be still and vast, the qi harmonious and peaceful, the fingers at ease.
Detach from the body, from things, from circumstances—even from the qin itself.
Silently extend this heart to merge with the great void, and whatever your fingers play will become the sounds of primordial antiquity!
If you merely perform new tunes to please the ear, the music becomes decadent and wanton—far removed from the true Way of the qin."*

Bodily illness may be cured by medicine, but the sickness of the heart is difficult to heal. External demons may be subdued, but inner demons are hard to control. If one mistakenly believes in heretical words, delusions arise at once; from delusions spring causes, and from causes arise obstacles. When obstacles persist unchecked, demonic forces take form. Once demons long abide in one’s dwelling, they toss and toy with it, inducing dreams and fantasies, confusion and disorder—now stirring wrath and resentment, now inciting curses, now defaming the true Way, now indulging in perverse doctrines. In great matters, one may lose one’s home; in small, one may destroy one’s nature. Even if one awakens to repentance, soon delusion returns, and such cycles have no end.

I pity sentient beings and act as the King of Physicians, healing their heart-sickness and subduing their inner demons. When the sickness of the heart is cured, bodily illness vanishes; when inner demons are purged, external demons cannot invade. If one does not attack the heart, the illness penetrates to the region between the heart and diaphragm. When demons blaze within, external demons become glaringly manifest. You all should reflect in stillness—thus may you attain goodness together.

Only through forging in fierce flames does one become iron-willed; only by leaping from deep waters does one emerge as a hidden dragon.

Within this gate, one must achieve liberation in all matters and yield a step in all encounters—only then is one a vessel of the Dao. If even a trace of self-view clings or a shred of pride lingers, how can one enter the Dao?

Between heaven and earth, a human life is but a mayfly’s span! Not only ordinary mortals—even the immortals and buddhas of past, present, and future are no different. Yet while life is bounded, spirit knows no bounds. Viewing heaven and earth through my life, my life is but a mayfly; viewing heaven and earth through my spirit, heaven and earth are but a mayfly.

Alas! I see this mayfly: each day it lives and dies, each day it transforms. Gathered across ten thousand years, all is but this one life and death, this one transformation. People know the mayfly’s birth but not its death; they see its death but not its transformation. I see this mayfly—heaven and earth share its beginning and end.

Day is the mechanism of movement: all things move, and I move with them. Night is the mechanism of stillness: all things rest, and I rest with them. In this alternation of movement and stillness, waxing and waning with all things, lies the natural qi-mechanism of heaven and earth, the ceaselessly generative Dao.

Yet世 people often turn day into night and night into day, violating the natural qi-mechanism of heaven and earth, defying the principles of human life, and severing themselves from the power of transformation. Thus, rise with the day and rest with the night; consolidate essence and nurture spirit. Compete not with things, reduce desires, and purify the heart. Knowing stillness and restraint, one may hope for longevity.

My Dao takes "clarity, stillness, and emptiness" as its foundation, "longevity and deathlessness" as its urgency, "aiding others and benefiting beings" as its heart, and "carefree ease" as its desire. Many in remote mountains and secluded valleys yearn for this, yet alas, lacking a true teacher’s guidance, they waste their years in vain. Below them, the multitudes of the impure realm vie for fame at court and profit in the marketplace, drowning in the sea of desire and topsy-turvy in the river of attachment. Though they clearly fear death and seek life, they recklessly covet wealth and forget their lives. They overlook the gate of true awakening without entering, and see the swift and expedient path without walking it. Truly astonishing! Truly pitiable!

Someone asked: "Now, let us speak of this character ‘heart-mind.’ Do you all possess a heart-mind? And if you do, where does it reside?"

There were those who answered, "I do not know."

The reply came: "Excellent! Excellent! It is precisely in these three words, ‘I do not know.’ ‘Not knowing’ means ‘no heart-mind toward objects.’ Just as at this moment, your heart-mind is here. When the moment passes and you encounter another circumstance, your heart-mind is there—so elusive and intangible, how can you know where it abides?

The *Dao*-heart-mind is awareness. Awareness is knowing; knowing is not-knowing. Not-knowing is non-action; non-action enables action, and through action one may attain non-action. Non-action is the original substance of precelestial existence. If the original substance is non-action, then how can the original face be known? Thus, ‘not knowing’ is true knowing! You have nearly spoken to the subtlety of it!"

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Someone asked: "When a person has awareness, that is the heart-mind. The heart-mind’s comings and goings have no fixed abode—where, after all, does it reside?"

One answered: "The heart-mind abides before the sage."

The reply came: "Alas! The reason people fail to attain the true *Dao* is that they have a heart-mind! That their heart-mind has somewhere to abide! As you say, ‘The heart-mind is before me’—this heart-mind then clings to my form. Once it clings to my form, your heart-mind is no longer your heart-mind, but mine! How can my heart-mind become yours? Thus, the perfected person has no heart-mind—not that there is no heart-mind, but that the heart-mind is like the great void, without any abode. You must understand: if the heart-mind has no abode, then what is this heart-mind? It is said: the heart-mind is like the great void, yet the great void is not mere inert emptiness.

At Huangmei, one who ‘acts without abiding yet gives rise to the heart-mind’ could suddenly awaken. Now I have dissected and clarified this—why are you all still so benighted?

To shatter empty space—is this so or not?
Before the unclinging, what doubt remains?
Like stars at dawn, the sky grows bright—
The shadow falls on the cold pond, faint and dim."

Alas, all sentient beings!

I declare to you: consider this flower—untouched by defilement, its fragrance and hues resplendent. Once stained, it sinks into the mire; yet if one preserves its celestial purity, its scent and essence remain pristine and distant. I grieve for sentient beings, expounding the wondrous Dharma, that they may steadfastly follow these words, embody their form and restore their nature. Just as planting lotuses in fire is to seek coolness amid heat, do not, like burying blossoms after rain, inter their innate radiance in vain.

If you trust this, springs will surge from rock crevices, flowing into the great sea; if you do not, groping for doors in a darkened chamber, you shall find no exit. Let others doubt as they will—this old Daoist seeks only to save the world. Wait and see how their endings unfold, and you will know these words are not false.

In all things, one must keep the gaze lofty and the heart vast: receive favor as if startled, endure humiliation with forbearance, measure as boundless as the sea, heart as the great void. Thrones and riches, if they are mine to accept, I accept without deeming it glory; a single bowl or gourd, if mine to refuse, I refuse without deeming it affectation. The sages of old possessed the world yet did not cling to it, casting it aside like worn-out sandals—how could their hearts ever be swayed by wealth or poverty, honor or disgrace?

Yet most today are ensnared by such thoughts, bound to the heart-mind and unable to transform. If one day high rank and lavish emoluments were bestowed upon them, I know not what manner of creature they would become. Are they not the obstinate, petty men of this world?

Those among ordinary people who can comprehend the Dao are not few, yet though they know it, they fail to put it into practice—thus the Dao remains obscure in the world! Now, when one speaks of seeking the Dao, what words can the Dao offer? There is but one method: proceed step by step, without idle thoughts, without straying into side paths. To "lay the foundation" or "refine mercury" is all empty fame! The Dao abides in heaven and earth, advancing with the four seasons.

Heaven and earth have day and night,
Sun and moon wax and wane.
If one can harmonize yin and yang,
A single principle gathers within the cosmos.

Yet within it lie all manner of sufferings,
Each demanding dissolution into the boundless.
The five senses guide the nine orifices,
The six thieves lure the seven emotions.

Above, one ascends to the thousand-fathom peak;
Below, one plunges into the hundred-fathom abyss.
Dragons churn the vast sea’s waves,
Tigers roar and ten thousand peaks topple.

By what method can this be governed?
Wield the sword to sever the roots of karmic hindrance,
Bind demons and fetter spirits,
Slay ghosts and dispel malevolent vapors.

In cultivation, sweep the dwelling clean,
And the Yellow Court becomes pure and still.
Bright as the moon in the azure sky,
Vivid as clouds atop the mountain ridge.

Forget scheming, forget appearances,
Be without self, without name.
A mass of true and ultimate principle—
All lies in guarding the empty and numinous.

The meaning of giving life to a body, explained from the very beginning:
Ten months of pregnancy, with the agony of childbirth;
Three years of nursing, with ceaseless care and toil.
Illness, pain, itching—before the child speaks, the mother already worries;
Coming and going, rising and resting—before the body moves, the heart is already mindful.
Seeing the child laugh or cry, she is moved to sorrow or joy;
Watching its first steps, she is struck with alarm or delight.
She endures hunger to feed her child,
Bears cold to clothe her son.

Longing for the child’s success, her eyes grow weary with waiting;
Yearning for its marriage, her heart finds no rest.

Some brave wind and rain to establish a foundation;
Others surmount peril and hardship to renew their ancestral enterprise.
Day after day, they toil without rest—all for the sake of posterity;
Deep into the night, their hearts remain troubled—all for their children’s sake.
How could one ever repay such boundless virtue?
As children, if we wish to requite our parents’ kindness,
we must exhaust our strength and devote our hearts,
never faltering in filial devotion, ever sincere and reverent.
We should provide them with warm food and clothing to nourish their bodies,
speak softly and gently to gladden their hearts,
obey their wishes and attend to their every inclination.
As the ancient saying goes:
*“To see what is unseen, to hear what is unspoken—
only then is one truly filial.”*
Yet if, at life’s crucial junctures, we fail to do our utmost,
and instead merely perform rituals, make offerings,
or aid the poor and needy—
though we accumulate a hundred thousand acts of goodness,
it all amounts to nothing.
To neglect the great moral bond is to be worse than birds and beasts.
In life, one is despised by others;
in the state, one is beyond the law’s tolerance.
Above, the gods grow wrathful;
below, the spirits turn hostile.
One may be struck by flood, fire, plague, or malevolent spirits—
disasters inescapable.
Worse still, lightning may shatter the corpse, reducing the body to ashes,
unclaimed by earth or flame.
Such retribution—how can one not fear it?

Plowing shallowly, one cannot expect a bountiful autumn harvest.
How can mere numbers suffice as proof?
Lose your heart, corrupt your conduct—
though fate may grant wealth and rank, you remain base.
Cultivate your heart, nurture your nature—
even if fate is adverse, brighter days will come.

The admonition to Song Zhen Shu states:
*“If your strength is truly sufficient for good,
why exhaust yourself as an ox or horse for your descendants?
The savor of officialdom,
the treacheries of the world,
the storms of human sentiment—
you have witnessed them all.”*

The苦海 is boundless, yet to turn one’s head is to reach the shore.
Look at those who toil in ceaseless pursuit—
at the end of their feasts, they may not part well.
Plain pickled greens and simple rice are no less than fine meats,
coarse cloth and hempen shoes can match embroidered silks.
Only if you rein in when spurred, rest when at ease,
will you find inexhaustible enjoyment!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

As a father, one must not be overly indulgent,
nor excessively harsh.
Only with a worthy father can there be a filial son;
only with a kind father can there be an obedient son.
How many in ancient times became accomplished without teaching?
How many acted rightly without urging?
How many embodied their father’s heart and carried on his will without learning?
Let fathers take heed.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

The admonition to Wu Yishu states:
*“There are no unfilial immortals in heaven!
You must return to serve your parents, sit in quietude, and hold your tongue.
Do not fritter away the years in the bustling marketplace!
The perfected one has no fate, for he has no self.
Embody these words.”*

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

You, my disciples, must not be overly self-serving, nor seek only your own gain; neither be excessively stern, nor excessively indulgent.
Those who follow my teachings, I shall not reject;
those who turn from my teachings, I shall not pursue.
Those who embody my intent, Heaven shall surely bestow blessings upon them;
those who secretly defy my instructions, Heaven shall surely bring calamity upon them.
To speak of the Dao and virtue with one’s lips while harboring deceit in one’s heart—
though you may deceive others in the light, how can you deceive the gods in the dark?
In sum: maintain integrity in solitude, feel no shame before your shadow beneath the quilt, and advance without cease.
Thus may you aspire to sagehood, thus may you partake in the workings of Heaven and Earth.
Those petty concerns of wealth, rank, and longevity—how can mere fate ever govern them?
Let my disciples take heed.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Now that you have returned to my teachings, you must undergo a thorough cleansing, a profound awakening.
For those who cultivate blessings yet encounter misfortune, I shall answer their cries and deliver them;
for those who accumulate evil and refuse to change, I shall silently correct them.
Wu Yishu, in his conduct, has long practiced hidden virtues:
though his parents did not show him deep affection, he served them with ever-greater filial devotion;
though his brothers were not always harmonious, he never wavered in fraternal duty.
In his dealings with others, he bears a heart of warmth; in his approach to the world, he holds a spirit of sincerity.
He understands the principles of Chan and upholds them in silence;
he also grasps the subtleties of my Dao and embraces them deeply.
Compared to those whose words belie their actions, who parrot hearsay without true understanding—how vast the difference!
Thus do I rejoice in him.

Wu Yishu is steadfast in his nature, his heart free of deceit.
In his conduct and interactions, he leaves no trace of impurity, adapting to circumstances and speaking as the moment demands.
His mind is as boundless as the heavens and earth, as fluid as clouds drifting and mists dispersing.
Moreover, he sets his aspirations high, breaking free from the cage of worldly constraints—truly a man of resolve!
Thus do I rejoice in him.

Yet both of you must continually examine and refine yourselves, advancing step by step.
Do not fall behind, do not descend—then all shall be well!
Beware lest my words lead you to slacken or grow reckless, lest you squander a most promising future.
Ponder this deeply, and stand in awe of it.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

In this human life, nothing is more fearful than wavering.
If one can act with resolute decisiveness, what Dao cannot be heard? What immortality cannot be hoped for?
Yet I fear that though my words are earnest, your conduct may still betray them!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Alas for those sentient beings who commit so many unrighteous acts:
Disloyal and untrustworthy, unkind and ungenerous.
Some as sons are undutiful, some as elder brothers unfraternal, some as younger brothers irreverent, some in friendship insincere.
In their own conduct, they harbor much secrecy, treachery, and cruelty; in their dealings with others, they lack righteousness, benevolence, wisdom, and courage.
They seize the flesh and blood of others to fatten their own bodies;
They destroy the lives of others to nourish their own forms.
They show no reverence for Heaven and Earth or the spirits, but lightly heap upon them scorn and contempt;
They hold the sacred scriptures and canonical texts in no esteem, but recklessly revile and denounce them.
They utter curses and maledictions, consort with the wanton and the wicked, commit many evils, and indulge in licentiousness and defilement.
The divine bureaus record their deeds, weigh their gravity, and impose punishments accordingly:
Some suffer the calamities of war, flood, fire, or pestilence;
Some endure the miseries of hardship, adversity, lowliness, or disgrace—each reaps what they have sown, their retribution measured by their deeds.

If you enter my gate, be loyal to your lord and filial to your parents,
Reverent to your elder brothers and fraternal to your younger,
Let your heart and mind be sincere and free of deceit,
Conduct yourself with uprightness and kindness in all dealings.
Bathe and fast to reverently worship Heaven, Earth, and the deities;
With wholehearted devotion, recite and complete the scriptures of the Great Treasury.
Should there be one who endures the severance of love and desire,
Who seeks the supreme Dao,
I shall transform my form to guide them,
Appearing in dreams or encounters, whether seated or walking,
That they may early grasp the essentials and cultivate the golden immortal’s path.

If not, yet you heed my teachings and apply them earnestly in the world,
With unblemished goodness and no arising of evil thoughts,
Should you seek great fortune, I shall bestow it;
Should you seek long life, I shall grant it;
Should you desire worthy sons and virtuous grandsons, or abundant success and renown,
If you persist in cultivation without slackening, beginning and ending with constancy,
I shall raise you to the Southern Palace, where you may wander carefree in joy,
And in time ascend to the rank of upper immortals,
Forever free from the dust’s defilement, beyond the reach of calamity.

My words make clear the tally of merit and transgression, the certainty of karmic retribution.
You, my disciples, listen with wholehearted attention and return to uphold them:
Do not linger in complacency or carelessness,
Do not grow indolent or seek ease,
Do not defy the true teachings,
Do not follow perverse doctrines.
Let each walk their own path, each pursue their own merit.
If you are truly sincere and steadfast in observance, you shall naturally obtain auspicious blessings.
Understand this well, and stand in awe of it.

Merit in saving the world lies not in magnitude, nor in quantity—only in the uttermost sincerity of the heart. Even if you save but a single insect or cherish a single plant, acting within your capacity, boundless merit shall accrue.

Hearken, all you disciples, to the decree of this solemn admonition. From this day forth, each of you must awaken with urgency!

Be loyal and filial without shame as child or subject; be reverent and sincere, that the Dao may shine forth. To be human yet lacking in kindness and grace, to treat others without generosity and benevolence, to profit oneself at another’s expense, to take life to sustain one’s own, to worship spirits without reverence, to recite scriptures without faith, to begin with zeal yet falter in the end, to appear sincere while harboring deceit, to measure strength against peers, to divide fellow practitioners into "us" and "them," to resent the virtuous or conceal one’s faults—all such thoughts that dwell in partiality and inequity, all such stances that lack uprightness and magnanimity, though common among the mediocre, mark one as a transgressor against the moral order.

Each of you must reflect deeply in solitude. If any of these faults reside in you, correct them swiftly. Harness sincerity and reverence to rein in the wandering mind, and rely on the divine to dissolve transgressions and errors. Whether performing a single good deed to relieve another’s hardship, uttering a single kind word to untangle another’s grievance, or lending an arm to steady one on the brink of peril—let each act be as it may. For those with parents, exert every effort in devoted service; for those with siblings, uphold fairness, harmony, and goodwill in your dealings.

By such conduct, what begins as effort will gradually become second nature, and you may ascend into the realm of sages and worthies

A steadfast resolve must anchor the human heart, for once it wavers, one cannot apply it to the path of uprightness and luminous clarity. Instead, one clings stubbornly to private views, rejects wholesome counsel, manipulates with cunning schemes, contends over strength and weakness, divides self from others, and refuses to tame the reckless mind, allowing it to unify with the upright and luminous—thus creating self-contradiction. Though such a person may occasionally perform a minor good deed, the heart is the great root; if the root is flawed, what benefit do small virtues bring? Those afflicted by this failing must exert themselves to reform it thoroughly. Let no private cleverness prevail, no partial views persist. Purify the depths, free from obstruction and attachment. Bare your heart and courage, become a person of uprightness and luminous clarity, and act accordingly. With every step, ascend ever higher, and wherever you go, all shall prosper. Seek it within yourself, exhausting only your sincerity. The thousands of sages, the ten thousand sages—all converge in the One. A single moment of awakening brings boundless blessings.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

I laugh at those multitudes: their devotion to the Dao flickers like bubbles on water! Their pleas for mercy burn like flames! Why not redirect this fervor toward devotion to the Dao? Then, without striving for blessings, blessings will grow of themselves; without seeking merit, merit will expand of itself; without pursuing profit, profit will spread widely. What need is there to ask for it?

With my boundless compassion, I guide and lead, wishing only to ferry all beings to the other shore. Yet if people come without accumulated sincerity, they regard this as mere play. Better to bar the gate entirely than to have them enter the Dao only to falter in the end. Some are diligent at first but slacken later; others are lax at the start but strive afterward. May the diligent never grow weary, and may the lax rouse themselves to effort—then all shall be well! Disciples, you must redouble your sincerity from this point on. The slightest slackening, and transformation through teaching becomes impossible.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

In solitude and shadow, conduct yourself as though under the scrutiny of divine clarity. How much less, then, when standing before the gods, dare you act with abandon! The transgressions of beings arise from a single moment of recklessness, which, left unchecked, swells into madness and rebellion, ensnaring them in the web of sin. How can one not take heed!

In the pursuit of the Dao, value gentleness above all, and hold forbearance in the highest regard. If one can remain tranquil and refrain from contention, the benefits shall not be slight. Not only will this leave no cause for shame before others, but even when proclaimed before ghosts and spirits, none shall fail to receive its witness with favor.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

In all undertakings, one need not inquire into others’ right or wrong—what matters is inward reflection. If my conduct is beyond reproach in every respect, I must still reproach myself for my inability to move others toward reform and goodness, and deeply shame myself for failing to guide the foolish and obstinate. Even if I have fully realized the Dao and feel no unease before others, when faced with those who do evil, I must still meet them with softness and engage them with harmony. To turn even one evildoer toward goodness is a deed of the greatest merit. Even if they have sunk deeply into depravity, lost all sense of shame, and hardened in their wickedness—making transformation difficult—still, I must treat them with kindness. In short, I must fulfill the Dao with reverence and sincerity, neither overbearing nor servile, standing firm in the mean. In all encounters, I must respond with an empty and receptive heart: then, even the most unruly will, in time, come to hold me in awe and dare not indulge their recklessness. What external humiliation need one fear? What demonic obstacle could possibly threaten?

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Good arises from a single thought, and evil likewise from a single thought. In the hidden and subtle moments of solitude, the division between good and evil is made. Even those who do evil were once close to the nature of goodness. But through a single moment of carelessness, they drift into recklessness, and in the end, across countless kalpas, they cannot awaken their original bright nature. Violent and unrestrained, they stop at nothing, provoking the wrath of the gods and incurring heavenly retribution from which there is no escape. Thus, I pity these lost souls with a heavy heart and spare no effort in expounding the Dharma to them with compassion. From this day forward, when you observe the karmic consequences of their evil deeds, you must hold a heart of mercy, not one of delight; you must hold a heart of vigilance, not one of emulation. Then, your resolve to turn from evil will be strengthened, and your commitment to goodness will grow firm.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

This impure world of ours passes like a fleeting shadow in the crack of a door! Once a misstep is taken and time slips by, regret comes too late. The midnight temple bell rings—awaken with a start! All the schemes, the tricks, the clever ploys of the past—so many illusions. What was done in dreams seemed so wild and perverse. If you do not swiftly purify your heart and begin anew as a good person, striding toward the heavens on the path of virtue, you will sink ever deeper into filth, falling into the苦劫, from which escape is difficult even after countless lifetimes. Moreover, calamity will extend to your descendants, bringing ruin across generations. For evil has its time of fulfillment, and retribution differs only in its swiftness or delay. If one does not awaken, is this not a pity?

In this world, good deeds are endless to perform; meritorious acts are endless to establish. The sages and worthies, the higher their virtue, the humbler their hearts—seeing goodness, they feel they can never reach it; gazing upon the Dao, they feel they have yet to perceive it. Though they have accomplished many great works and built many merits, their hearts still feel a sense of insufficiency. How much more so when their goodness and merits remain incomplete—how could they dare to be arrogant and self-important? The ancients said: *"Fullness invites loss; humility brings gain."* This is the Way of Heaven. If the Way of Heaven is thus, can the Way of Man be otherwise?

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

A person who does good becomes a good person; one who does foul deeds becomes an evil person. Whether one becomes good or evil, whether one takes two different paths—it all hinges on that single point: the heart!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

People say that in all things, there is fate and there is destiny.

Yet the sages say: *"The perfected person possesses the learning of establishing destiny, and thus takes the workings of creation as their own—how could fate constrain them? How could numerical destiny confine them?"* As for those who, though they have not a single good deed or virtuous trait in their lives, yet do not lose their prosperity, emoluments, or nobility, this may stem from the accumulations of their ancestors or the cultivation of their past lives. Nevertheless, if evil deeds persist without cease, the root from which descendants enjoy wealth and nobility will be severed. If one’s personal blessings and grace extend only to oneself, then they will be diminished or revoked in accordance with one’s conduct. Are the words of the Most High on karmic retribution mere deceptions?

Strive, all of you, to do good deeds, each examining and cultivating yourselves, and do not betray this old heart’s earnest concern!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Good and evil each bear their own karmic consequences. If doing good brought no evident effect, then why bother with goodness? If committing evil incurred no fault or blame, then why not indulge in great wickedness? Reverence for the divine is not pursued for the sake of reward; it lies in offering sincere devotion and faith. This heart itself is the seed of goodness—no need to await results, for results will surely come.

I have studied the various classics, which speak emphatically of the merits of reciting scriptures—these are not empty words. For in reciting scriptures: a single moment of sincerity suffices to dispel all past delusions; a single hour of goodness already marks a great departure from former wrongs. To cast off delusion and preserve sincerity, to reform wrongs and follow goodness—who could say there is no karmic retribution? Yet it is lamentable: a moment of sincerity may, with the next thought, turn to arrogance; an hour of goodness may, in the next instant, be abandoned for wrongdoing. In such a case, how can one summon Heaven’s blessings and invite good responses?

Thus, the sacred scriptures and worthy traditions of antiquity, the Buddhist sutras and Daoist registers, all employ fine words to inspire the hearts of those who do good, urging them ever onward in virtue, so as to guide and welcome auspicious qi. It is not that mere recitation of scriptural words—without sincerity or reverence, with the mind wandering and thoughts frivolous—can erase transgressions and secure blessings! Only when the heart is wholly devoted to reverence, unwavering from beginning to end, is it truly good.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

The method of writing the classics is uniform in size and proportion, balanced in weight, with the left side solid and the right empty, and lengths aligned. If the brush precedes the intent, the characters will lack unity; if the intent precedes the brush, the calligraphy will be fitting. Where there is form, return to emptiness; where there is emptiness, make it substantial. Hasty or forced brushwork loses both balance and wonder. Follow my words: without striving for skill, proceed with reverence and correctness, and let vigor be your aim. Do not favor coquettish postures; let strength and tension press forward. Better slow than rushed—always wield the brush with dignity.

*Further Records of Master Han’s Three Teachings*

I often observe that those in the world who claim to pursue the Dao seek nothing more than divine immortals to guide them, or they study the refinement of cinnabar and mercury, or the practice of absorbing yin to supplement yang, all in hopes of attaining longevity and preserving wealth and status. As the saying goes: *"A hundred thousand strings of cash at the waist, riding a crane to Yangzhou"*—such are their aspirations. Yet few truly cherish or yearn for the pure emptiness, the quiescent extinction, the ever-abiding great Dao. Few exhibit the unwavering resolve of one who *"loves beauty with unshakable devotion,"* as the classics describe. Even those who have long studied the Confucian path hold the gates of Buddhism and Daoism in contempt!

Yet now, some among you—having begun with Confucian learning in youth, later donned the cap and sash of office, and now govern the people—still thirst for the wind of immortality, earnestly seeking the assembly of true dragons upon the sands. This must not be dismissed lightly! Know this: the Dao is entered through sincerity. From one sincere act, extend it until nothing remains insincere, and the Dao is no longer distant. Thus, the scriptures say: *"Before cultivating the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the Dao of humanity. If the Dao of humanity is not cultivated, the Dao of immortality remains far indeed!"*

What, then, is the cultivation of the Dao of humanity? The great Dao is fundamentally empty yet substantial, filling the cosmos. Only by embodying the Dao in action can one’s heart-mind expand to encompass all things. Vast, it embraces heaven and earth; within its scope, all beings—sentient and insentient—reside. This is the Confucian ideal of *"bringing peace to the old and care to the young,"* the Buddhist vow to *"liberate all beings,"* and the Daoist practice of *"expedient guidance"*—all arising from this single heart-mind.

Yet one must also delve deeply into the roots of wisdom and innate nature, constantly turning inward to illuminate the self, questioning the heart: *"Does this action accord with the Dao? Does that action not?"* In serving the people, let not a single duty go unfulfilled. This is the essence of the Confucian *"assisting transformation and nurturing life,"* the Buddhist *"radiance of inherent nature,"* and the Daoist *"forgetting form to merge with emptiness."*

Thus, the Great Compassionate Guanyin once manifested as a magistrate to expound the Dharma, and the Most High Laozi served as the Archivist of Zhou. Those in office are not barred from pursuing the Dao of purity and emptiness. If you can follow my words, conducting every affair with utter sincerity—sincerity in benefiting the people, that they may receive its blessings; sincerity in fostering culture, that customs may become pure and beautiful; sincerity in self-discipline, that governance may be free of harshness; sincerity in cultivating the Dao, that essence may be preserved and spirit guarded—then the paths of immortals, Buddhas, and Confucians need not be sought outside a single heart-mind.

My profound hopes for you lie in embodying the Most High’s heart of cherishing life, the Buddhist spirit of compassion, and the sages’ teachings of *"gathering without hoarding"*—not merely to bring luster to my own gate.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

For all who study the Dao, the essence lies in single-minded devotion. Silently activate the subtle mechanism, inwardly illuminate with a tranquil heart-mind, attain emptiness and preserve stillness, harmonize with the world while remaining untainted—thus wandering through life while embracing the One in self-cultivation. Let no stray thoughts arise, nor covet fame or profit. Forget the heart within, forget the form without; guide qi with the heart-mind, unite spirit with qi, merge with emptiness through spirit, until nothing remains to be forgotten, returning to the pristine, tranquil, and effortless Dao of the Great Void.

To comprehend this is to *"understand"* the Dao; to diligently practice it is to *"walk"* the Dao. As for the methods of the Southern Palace, though called orthodox, they do not constitute the great Dao of liberation from birth and death, of transcending the world through non-action. Thus, the Most High said: *"Purity and stillness are the norm of the world."* And again: *"Preserving spirit and securing qi are the roots of longevity."*

As for talismanic writing, though not the true gateway of the One, many are drawn to it. Some scholars, even at life’s end, may have their refined essence attach to others, revealing the learning they cultivated in life. But external alchemy—furnaces, crucibles, mercury, and lead—are nothing but deceptions that delude the people. The foolish who are deceived by such things are beyond counting. Never has an immortal used these to liberate the world.

In the past, Zhengyang transmitted to me the art of transmuting base metals into gold, but I feared it would mislead later generations. Through this single thought of discernment, I was delivered and ascended as an immortal. Now, what you have requested of me—I deeply lament it!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Scholars born into this world—who among them can remain rooted in one corner? Thus, a man’s life is meant to embrace the four directions as his aspiration. Yet what is truly meant by this aspiration for the four directions? It is to seek the Dao and follow a teacher: Confucian scholars carry their satchels a thousand *li*; those who study Buddhism or strive for immortality wear through straw sandals. Until their learning is complete and the Dao is realized, they will not rest!

Later generations, however, chase after fame and profit, scrambling for power and influence—some as traveling officials, some as wandering scholars, some as distant merchants—all driven by the pursuit of name and gain. There are also those who crave landscapes and mountains, undeterred by hard travel, even abandoning aged parents with white hair. Yet such far journeys remain confined within the bounds of the four directions.

The true person, however, roams the spirit through the void, covering a thousand or ten thousand *li* in a single breath, traversing the six directions and the Three Mountains in an instant. Departing, none know where they go, as their spirit wanders the cosmos; returning, none know whence they come, as they settle back into emptiness and stillness. Only such wandering can be called the ultimate journey.

Across the vast seas and heavens, how few—scarcely one in a hundred—can attain this!

The Pavilion of Descending Virtue and Forbearance addressed the assembly, saying:

"Thirty years ago, I descended in spirit to the shores of E, alighting my carriage here to sow the good causes of the *Three Grades*, gathering a grand assembly of ten thousand karmic connections. Upon this very ground, the foundation of this pavilion was laid to inaugurate the great enterprise. Later, I moved to the tower of the Song family, first bestowing the name *Encompassing the Three*, then relocating to the residence of Master Qiao to complete the upper scroll of the immortal canon.

Now, in retrospect, it all seems but the affair of yesterday! Yet the fruition of my transformative work owes entirely to your assistance, and to the tireless devotion of those who first undertook the task. Though the great work is now accomplished and all have received vast blessings, my heart remains ever mindful of those initial disciples. Feeling their labors have not been fully requited, I linger still within these halls, reluctant to vanish without a trace—such is the reason."

With a heart moved by worldly compassion, I spare no toil or trouble. Lingering still in the dusty realm, I do so solely to embody the heavens’ virtue of cherishing life above

The character *Dao*—this single word—is the secret mechanism of heaven and earth, the essence of yin and yang. It establishes the axis of the cosmos, unfolds transformation through the ages, most subtle and hidden, formless and nameless. It gives rise to the images of creation, roots the myriad things. At its inception, the primordial chaos was divided by the Great Potter’s Wheel—Buddhahood is this Dao, immortality is this principle, and the sagely wisdom of the Confucians admits no distinction. Tracing its origin, all spring from the Jade Purity; branching into streams and diverging into schools, each of the Three Vehicles opens a teaching, each founds a gate. What is solid is the principle of the Confucians; what is empty is the Chan mind. Emptiness and solidity, the two and five congeal into essence, preserving nonbeing while guarding being. Vast and indistinct, dimly discerned—it dwells within the navel wheel, ever more elusive, its aperture wondrous and hard to find. Above, it reaches the lunar cavern; below, it treads the root of heaven. In leisure it comes and goes, ever still, ever pure. What is solid is thus; what is empty abides forever. Divergent paths converge on the same track, returning to the undifferentiated. The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao. One forgets one’s person; I forget my self. To forget even forgetting is true forgetting—this is called true forgetting, beyond all comparison.

Those of discernment first establish sincerity. With sincerity comes clarity; with clarity, form manifests. Manifesting within and without, the great Dao may then be practiced.

Practicing the Dao admits no division of difficulty or ease, for it is wholly pervaded by sincerity.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

In this age, spirit-writing has spread widely, and many follow its currents. Yet within it, true and false inevitably intermingle, and gatherings dissolve as readily as they form. Most take those who speak of fortune and misfortune as genuine, and those who compose poetry and verse as worthy of assembly. Yet at this altar where I have presided over the flying phoenix for decades, I have never swayed others with omens of good or ill, nor have my disciples sought responses through the mechanisms of blessing or calamity. Though no striking words or texts may be observed, there is much in ritual, music, dignity, and decorum to cultivate. Thus, it remains constant and unchanging, ever renewing with time—far removed from those gatherings that flicker in and out, startling the world with their spectacle.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Some fear that my gate harbors strange sights and strange sounds, enough to unsettle others. Yet when I observe myself, I find nothing so extraordinary in what I hear or see! But I wonder: are the things others hear and see truly strange? Or are they not?

For if they are not strange, then they are merely ordinary—and the term "ordinary" encompasses much. Human life, standing on earth and beneath heaven, amounts to nothing more than clothing oneself to be clothed, eating to be fed, daily rising and resting—nothing out of the ordinary! This is what "ordinary" means.

Humans possess the five senses and four limbs, all endowed with eyes that see and ears that hear, faculties of perception and clarity—these are shared by all, nothing strange here! From childhood through elementary learning, to maturity and the understanding of human relations, all efforts—from cultivating the self to ordering the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world—follow the teachings of the former kings and the conduct of the sages, aiming to reach the realm of sageliness and worthiness. Yet all this stands firmly within the central Way, utterly ordinary, nothing strange!

Then there are the two paths of Buddhism and Daoist transcendence: one clarifies the nature to its source, seeking liberation from birth and death; the other refines nature and spirit, aspiring to longevity. Though their claims may seem fantastical and unverifiable, and their practitioners elusive and hard to examine, when viewed through the lens of the ordinary, neither Buddhism nor Daoist transcendence abandons the fundamental nature in their cultivation. Neither do they stray from the central guard to speak of subtleties. The roots of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness are never absent from their thoughts; the practices of yielding, reverence, and mutual respect are never neglected in their conduct. Thus, one who is filial to parents may be called a filial immortal; one who is loyal to their lord may be deemed a loyal transcendent. Extending this principle, all who fulfill their roles and exhaust their ethical duties are seeds of immortality and sprouts of Buddhahood! Even without aspiring to transcendence or Buddhahood, they naturally attain it.

The reason lies in the three teachings taking different paths yet converging in the Supreme Ultimate, without division into sectarian gates. In my *Three Ranks* canon, this principle is thoroughly elucidated with great precision. Yet petty scholars of the world, entirely ignorant of this unifying truth, recklessly criticize and slander it. I do not question the nature of their thoughts, but merely smile at their pedantry and rigidity!

When people come seeking the Dao, whatever they may hear or see—even if I do not fully comprehend it—I do not regard it as strange or extraordinary. Even those of great discernment, if they truly turn to my gate, should view it as nothing more than an ordinary affair, for only then do they embody the demeanor of a true adept. Since their hearts are earnestly devoted to my Way, I teach them only the great Dao—and the greatness of the Dao amounts to nothing more than these two words: "ordinary."

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

My gate is vast, harboring compassion and kindness within the boundless, radiating light within the indistinct. All who sincerely pledge their faith, without doubt, will inevitably experience divine resonance. Yet if one regards me as dispensable or negligible, I cannot respond to their demands for immediate answers—the unfathomability of spiritual thought and principle confirms this.

If one can serve parents with love and respect, treat elder siblings with harmony and deference, engage friends with sincerity and trust, conduct oneself in the world with fairness, cultivate the self and overcome selfishness, and honor ethical duties and fundamental principles—then one stands daily before my face and hears my words. In the silent communion between us, I naturally affirm them.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

To understand the death of the living, why not observe the life of the dead? The death of the living is commonly seen as the exhaustion of one’s allotted span. Yet regarding the life of the dead, some say, “Death is but rebirth.” Others claim, “Death is unfathomable—how can its rebirth be certain?” Still others assert, “There is no evidence for life after death.” Such debates are endless, unaware that the ancients declared, “The meaning of life and death is vast!” In truth, it cannot be casually explained.

By right principle, humans receive life by inheriting the qi of yin and yang, taking form through the clear and turbid qi. Their coming is vast and indistinct, like the morning sun rising in the east. People see only the sun’s ascent—how can they witness its true emergence from Fusang, or know whether it is real or not? In death, the qi retreats into darkness, the body withers away, like the western sun plunging suddenly below the horizon. People see only the sun’s descent—how can they behold its true setting at Yanzi, or know whether it is real or not?

Thus, those who grasp principle concern themselves only with the body presently before them, acting with unwavering sincerity. Whether in life or death, they simply accept what is right. Destiny may be known, but not spoken of; fate has its limits, yet it is better to abide by it. The great scholars clarify life and death before their own existence, comprehending them through insight; they follow life and death after their own existence, returning to reality and embracing emptiness. Their subtlety is profound beyond measure—none of this can be spoken of by ordinary people.

The world speaks of seventy-two ritual forms for the Dipper, yet thirty-six of these conceal its true essence—all else serves merely to transmit teachings through ceremonial observances. Little do people realize that the rite of worshipping the Dipper is not only abundant in my tradition’s liturgical teachings but also widely practiced in the Tathāgata’s school, where celestial rites abound. Though their categories differ, the central scriptures of the Buddhist canon surpass Daoist liturgy in excellence, for they possess the sounds of Sanskrit and include methods of spiritual attainment, profound and wondrous.

Even among the Chan school, some use this practice to perceive their nature and illuminate their mind, like a single lamp of wisdom casting light everywhere, leaving no corner unillumined. In this dark chamber where no flame has yet been kindled, all remain as figures of black lacquer, unable to see one another’s faces. But when suddenly a torch appears, the space above and below becomes utterly transparent, its radiance shining in all directions—such joy is beyond compare. Likewise, those who worship the heavens, though dull and ignorant, if their sincerity is steadfast and their devotion unwavering, following the Sanskrit teachings and performing the rites with faith, may one day awaken in clarity, all attaining enlightenment. Just as when our Tathāgata beheld the morning star and laughed, holding up a flower to the assembly—so too is this truth.

Know then that the divine sounds of Sanskrit possess the six supernatural powers, unmatched in their efficacy; their merit and power are truly beyond discourse. Even the secret manuals of my esoteric tradition, revered by the highest immortals and celestial lords, are held in veneration, observed in accordance with the celestial cycles of heaven and earth. Yet if one’s roots are not fully ripened or their cultivation uneven, they may not easily receive the sacred teachings of the Supreme Perfected’s *Lingbao Taiwei* liturgy.

For the Dipper is the lord of all stars, dwelling among the celestial worthies; its vows are deeply rooted, its compassion vast, its Dharma boundless. Even the nine grades of fruition cannot fathom its depths. The five Dipper scriptures transmitted are all liturgical texts, each containing hidden mysteries not revealed to lesser practitioners. Unless one is a vessel of the Nine Heavens, they shall not hear these words. Yet one may still study these liturgical forms, cultivate with utmost sincerity, and pray with earnest devotion, following the meaning in practice—each will experience divine responses in their own way: some may witness the descent of the Purple Palace, others the silent manifestation of arm or face; some may see celestial flowers scattering, others the display of immortal offerings, all unfolding as desired and fulfilling every wish.

The superior practitioner, aspiring to immortality, may thereby escape suffering; the middling practitioner, making prayers, shall see all their wishes granted. Even the smallest karmic rewards from such supplications are but minor fruits! Those who attain great wisdom and great liberation through this practice are beyond counting. Still others, having personally received the true arts of the *Wei* and *Ling* from the Three or Five Perfected, transcend ordinary cultivation to dwell in the supreme truth—all by virtue of this power. Just as those who recite “Amitābha Buddha” and are received into the Eight Meritorious Pools, transforming into lotus blossoms, so too is this subtle and wondrous. As the sacred scriptures say: *“Though foolish, they shall become enlightened; though weak, they shall become strong.”* So it is with those who worship the heavens.

Where there is no supreme truth to be grasped, that is the supreme truth. Within the formless, the forms first arise—only to ultimately return to formlessness. Marvelous indeed!

The character "scripture" (*jing*) is fundamentally meant to teach people to uphold constancy without change, ever reverent and ever awed. The profoundly wise contemplate it and inwardly sense its resonance; those of middling capacity regard it and know what to guard against; even the common folk, upon knowing it, all feel reverence and fear. Thus, when I establish teachings to instruct others, this single character contains manifold admonitions—it is no mere pretense of language or text to dazzle the eye.

Yet the essence of such admonition lies first in "gathering the heart-mind." When the heart-mind is alert, then whether revering the gods or serving others, one acts as though in their presence, ever respectful and ever cautious, vigilant at every moment, diligent all day long. In approaching the divine, one must be especially circumspect. From the smallest matter to the greatest, from a single task to a hundred—gather the heart-mind within the breast and never let it stray. Gradually, through practice, it will attain purity, and in time, the heart-mind will have its master, so one does not dare to grow reckless, brash, or wantonly unrestrained.

This method of gathering the heart-mind is the guiding principle of my foundational teachings, the governing force of my scriptural expositions, and the very essence of what I have always called the wondrous truth of cultivating immortality or Buddhahood! As for those of the lowest capacity, even if they cannot inwardly grasp profound mysteries or align with the distant spirit, when confronted with these regulations, they should at least, in serving Heaven and revering the gods, exercise some restraint—taming this wild and unruly monkey-spirit to prevent its rampancy. Yet such people, in their daily lives, utterly neglect the study of gathering the heart-mind, merely indulging in habitual tendencies, vainly giving free rein to desires. Their ignorance burns fiercely, their consciousness is hard to discipline, and in all things, they act wantonly, forming deep-seated habits of reckless and unrestrained conduct. Enmeshed in the delusions of the mundane, they do not awaken to the thunderous voice of warning. Thus, in their approach to the divine, they behave with reckless abandon, transgressing propriety and overstepping bounds—conduct for which they cannot even answer to themselves.

Such people are called "the unprincipled" in human relations, "the insolent and arrogant" in worldly affairs, "the unworthy" in Confucian teaching, "those who defile the pure rules" in the Buddhist tradition, and in my Dao, "the mad and perverse." What value do they have? The word *jing* means reverence—without reverence, why speak of scripture? Scripture teaches people through the heart-mind—if the heart-mind is scattered, why establish scripture? Only when scripture seals the heart-mind does the heart-mind become the essence of scripture. Scripture is not merely entrusted to language and text.

Alas! I cannot help but feel sorrow for them.

In all matters of serving the divine, one faces the numinous with solemn reverence, as though the gods were present before one—whether to the left or right, awe and deference must prevail. Not only must attire be impeccable, but one’s bearing must also be upright; with vigilant reverence, every movement of hand and foot should be composed. In morning rites, prostrations, and invocations, the ritual forms must be measured, the demeanor unhurried and refined, the gravity in accord with the proper sequence.

When the exalted deities turn their gaze upon one’s central place, their scrutiny is severe—one dare not slight them. Such reverence and awe resemble a subject’s devotion to a sovereign, where every propriety must be observed. Yet in the service of superiors or the audience with a ruler, there may be those whose reverence is not born of true sincerity. But if the heart harbors awe, no pretense of devotion can arise.

Serving the divine, however, surpasses even the reverence due to a sovereign, for the gods’ radiance is resplendent, their responsiveness swift—breath and echo move in unison, so immediate that one cannot but feel awe, cannot but dare to feel awe. This is due to the gods’ manifest presence, which defies all measure.

Those who approach with the intent to serve the divine must already align their hearts with reverence—how could they dare to jest, to trifle, to act irreverently, treating the sacred as child’s play? Though I possess little worth, once the heart is set on serving the divine, whether the gods exist or not, one must fully devote one’s heart and fulfill one’s rites.

If this Way remains obscure, how can one be human? How can one serve the divine? Between gods and humans, resonance arises from sincerity—sincerity moves Heaven, and Heaven’s virtue is fragrant. A thousand rites and a hundred forms all hinge upon the heart; whether the heart is true or false depends on one’s own resolve. To exhaust one’s loyalty is to be true in substance; responding to things with sincerity, one cultivates understanding, refines the self, orders the family—all extending from the heart. The governance of peace and harmony rests upon utmost sincerity; all participation in creation and nurturance stems from this root.

O you disciples, strive diligently in this practice!

The difficulty of wielding the planchette is no ordinary matter—some achieve it through celestial endowment, others through human effort.

To become a planchette medium requires innate wisdom, a penetrating intelligence, a nature harmonious in qi, and a heart and spirit serene and detached—at odds with the ways of the world. One must have long cultivated good faith, never deceiving others, never chasing externals, reverent and single-minded, embodying tranquility, ever cautious and vigilant, unwavering and unhesitating, free from doubt or deceit. Only then can heart and hand respond in unison, spirit and person merge as one, and divine insight flow unimpeded, never obstructing the will of the gods.

Those who naturally embody stillness and ease, whose intent is gentle and harmonious, effortlessly refined—these are the "heaven-made" mediums. Those who progress from novice to mastery through disciplined cultivation, attaining perfection only after rigorous refinement—these are the "human-effort" mediums. In all cases, the foundation lies in daily sincerity, where words and deeds are never careless, and one’s inner disposition aligns with the divine. When the moment arrives, one must gather spirit and concentrate qi, still the heart and calm the nature, so that qi abides and spirit abides, the mechanism is fluid and the heart is nimble—this is the essence.

For the planchette medium serves as the vessel for the divine; any flaw in speech, any lapse in conduct, any trace of vanity, deceit, or doubt—these the gods reject. If they reject the person, how can they dwell within? Even in the midst of practice, if the mind wanders outward, if the seven emotions arise, if one wavers in doubt or falters in diligence, the divine mechanism is obstructed, and the connection cannot endure. This is why true planchette mediums are rare, why those who serve *my* transmission are rarer still, and why those who can expound scriptures and preach the Dharma are the rarest of all.

My work of enlightenment begins with finding the right vessel: one whom the gods may possess must also possess virtue and spiritual roots. Thus, the term "planchette medium" is not lightly spoken.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

In the prime of youth, one must first discipline the nature—this is the foundation of virtue, and it cannot be cultivated without warmth and generosity.

Thus, what the Confucian tradition calls "preserving the mind and nurturing nature" is precisely what my tradition terms "refining qi and refining spirit." Those who study the Dao must first learn not to live, but to die; if they cannot die, how can they attain life? Concealing the mechanism of life within the aperture of death—this is for each person to realize for themselves. Otherwise, the more one seeks life daily, the more one hastens toward death. This is the profound subtlety of the Way of perpetual generation. Do not be swayed by habitual defilements or deluded by worldly dust. A single spark of enlightenment in a person is like a torch kindled in a dark room, instantly illuminating all—do not squander your wisdom on useless pursuits.

Truly, being entangled in mundane affairs is an inescapable part of human nature. Yet you differ from the common crowd and should not cling to vulgar perceptions. Though I now offer you manifold confirmations, I cannot augment what is absent nor diminish what is present. Even if I wished to reshape your destiny, how could I alter what is already fixed? Today, I speak to you with this hope: that you may awaken to the truth that "all conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows."

You need only follow your allotted path and abide in the present, seeking to realize the wondrous fruit to come. Then, when the day arrives for me to expound and unfold the teachings, it will suffice to awaken your inherent wisdom—this will be the fruition of seventy years of gathering karmic conditions. From now on, you must gradually shed worldly burdens, cast off secular attachments, undertake a thorough rectification, and gather your spirit, awaiting the ripening of conditions. Then you may assist me in expounding the teachings, bringing boundless benefit to all.

Moreover, in your past lives of cultivation, you would have long since attained perfect penetration and swift realization!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Having taken refuge in my tradition, you must embody my intent. Let reverence govern your mind, and harmony guide your dealings with others. Do not exalt yourself with arrogance, nor display haughtiness toward all things. Even if alluring temptations surround you, recall the steadfastness of Master Xia Hui, who remained unmoved. Though others may subject you to unjust treatment, you must emulate the noble person who reflects thrice and finds no fault.

Do you not know the words of the *Book of Zhou*: "August Heaven shows no partiality—it aids only those who possess virtue"?

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

When my disciples lead their families to take refuge, it may seem an expression of sincerity toward the Dao. Yet many of you assume that merely receiving a Daoist name constitutes refuge—how far this is from its true meaning! You do not understand that "refuge" (*gui*) means taking the Dao as your return, while "dependence" (*yi*) means taking the Dao as your sovereign master and relying upon it.

Only when you faithfully accept and practice the teachings, uphold the precepts, avoid transgressing the rules of the Daoist community, and maintain the moral order of human relations—only when your mind is upright, your sincerity unwavering, and your actions aligned with principle—can you truly embody the meaning of refuge and be called one who has taken refuge. If you seek only a Daoist name to fulfill your notion of refuge, it is utterly meaningless! How much more so for those women and children who lack understanding and insight!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

If you aspire to follow my Dao, you must cultivate reverence and faith, grounding all things in their fundamental essence.

If you willingly abandon yourself, you will daily sink into the filthy and base; if you can act with unyielding vigor, you will daily ascend to the lofty and luminous. As for nurturing essence and fostering purity, harmonizing nature and regulating emotions—this fundamentally depends on possessing the learning of self-cultivation and serene stillness, and preserving a mind of emptiness and profound obscurity, only then can you achieve success! If you fail to restrain yourself, you will daily grow coarse and superficial; the failure to connect with the spirit is a minor matter, but the karmic retribution for transgressions is most severe!

To Hong, the Sincere and Earnest:

Have you also heard of my doctrine of "Encompassing the Three" (*Han San*)? Since the primordial bifurcation of the Two Modes, the Three Powers have been distinguished. Yet heaven possesses the Three Lights to illuminate all things, and earth possesses the Three Teachings to sustain the human heart. However, as people differ in their endowment of qi, the Buddhist canon speaks of the Three Vehicles, the elixirs of immortality are ranked in Three Grades, and even the Confucians acknowledge differences in the upper, middle, and lower qualities of qi. Tracing back to their origin, their allotment was uniform, fundamentally belonging to the One Qi, and containing within it the One Principle. Thus, though the Three Teachings are distinct, they emerge from a single source. If you penetrate the principles of the Three Teachings and perceive no difference between them, you will naturally return to the essence of the Supreme Ultimate!

The Supreme Ultimate is precisely what is called the "Primordial One Qi" (*xian tian yi qi*). From it, the Two Modes were divided, and the Three Powers were distinguished. As for the Three Teachings, they are but tributaries and divergent streams of the Supreme Ultimate; in their origin, they are nothing other than the One Principle. Therefore, my altar was specifically named "Encompassing the Three," for it unites the Three into One, and within the One Dao, it embraces the Three Teachings!

In the practice of our school, there are both heterodox and orthodox methods: the heterodox speak of techniques for prolonging life and extending years, while the orthodox discourse solely on the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir is what the Buddhist Dharma calls "perfectly luminous awakened nature." It is neither metal nor stone, yet metals and stones cannot compare to its firmness; it divides into yin and yang, yet yin and yang cannot capture its subtlety! Its numinous responsiveness is boundless, its spiritual transformations beyond comparison. Cultivate it, and the inch-field and foot-dwelling can attain longevity; a hundred years, a thousand years, can be perpetually preserved. Those methods of medicinal substances, fire times, the two eights and one catty, the midnight and noon withdrawals and additions, the ascent of water and descent of fire—these are but peripheral words! In truth, to exhaust the essence of nature and life, to subdue the deluded mind, the Dao is right before your eyes! In my earlier *Pointers for the School*, I once revealed this meaning to instruct others.

Some say in admonition to those who study the Dao:
*"Grasp well the hairless fierce tiger!"*
This hairless fierce tiger is the heart-mind.
What the heart-mind does is called intention—
intention is what the *Pointers for the School* calls the "Yellow Dame,"
in the human body, the "Spleen-Earth."

Water below is hard to ascend;
fire above is hard to descend.
When intention becomes utterly single-minded,
qi naturally follows.
Thus a cinnabar formula says:
*"The Yellow Dame leads and draws into the center."*
For metal is the mother of water,
wood the mother of fire.
With this Eastern King and Western Queen united,
they give birth to the two—water and fire, male and female.
Yet only through intention’s refining and tempering
can accomplishment be achieved.
Thus another cinnabar formula says:
*"Originally through Wu and Ji as matchmakers,
husband and wife come to rightful joy."*
Though the cinnabar classics abound with such names and forms,
all are provisionally established.
If this heart-mind is subdued and settled,
then all becomes empty.
The Most High said:
*"A Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
a name that can be named is not the constant name."*

Just as the intent to "contain the Three" implies—yet the Three cannot be named, what then is there to contain? If containment itself cannot be named, how can the Three be distinguished? Thus the One is the Three, and the Three is the One. One who awakens to this Dao is a true cultivator.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

The original heart-mind and nature remain unenlightened, thus karmic entanglements bind one to the endless cycle of rebirth. This kalpa not yet exhausted, another arises; evil retribution not yet dissolved, karmic debts mount anew. The longer one sinks, the deeper one drowns! In the boundless netherworld, no path leads out; through endless years, when shall one ascend?

The human body is hard to obtain, rebirth in the Pure Land harder still. Keen senses and bright eyes are the virtue of Heaven’s bestowal; ample clothing and food are the merit of past-life cultivation. Wealth, fame, and honor cannot be forcibly seized! Longevity or early death, poverty or prosperity—none come by mere luck!

If one fails to repay the grace of Heaven and Earth above or the kindness of nurture below, one trivializes life and forgets its root, already incurring immense transgression! Worse still, some disrupt moral order, corrupting the very foundation, scheming with cunning and deceit, treating others with cruelty and malice. They show no reverence for the Three Lights, scorn the Three Teachings, defile the human realm, and lose their original nature. In life, they suffer grievous illness and die untimely; in death, they cannot escape hell’s punishments and are cast into the underworld. Are not such multitudes pitiable?

Know this: the path to heaven lies in a luminous heart-mind. Let go today, and today all is empty; turn back tomorrow, and tomorrow all is resolved. One laughs at life’s fleeting dream—who can seek truth within it? One sighs at the world’s countless illusions—who can find reality amid the void?

While alive, they knew no reflection; in death, their souls are benighted! Clinging to ephemeral things, where does their original spirit reside? Lamenting to earth and heaven, who pities their cold grave? Once they lose their human form, sinking through ten thousand kalpas with no escape—is this not terrifying?

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Since time immemorial, people have lost their true nature, failing to take refuge in the Three Treasures, seeking only to nourish the illusory body. Yet the illusory body is false and will decay. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, however, is everlasting and undying—neither born nor destroyed.

But this "Golden Elixir" is not like the heterodox paths that burn cinnabar and refine mercury, deluding the world and deceiving the people, driving them to ruin their families and waste their fortunes, achieving nothing while bringing harm. The immortals’ elixir is the cultivation of the heart-mind. Everyone possesses this Golden Elixir—only they refuse to refine it, thus remaining trapped in the cycle of kalpas, forever without liberation!

One must vow with fervor, first repenting past transgressions and taking refuge in the Three Treasures. In Buddhism, the Three Treasures are the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; in Daoism, they are the Dao, the Scriptures, and the Master. Though the names differ, the principle is one. From this moment on, devote yourself to the Dao, and you may realize the pure Dao-body.

Awakening lies in the heart-mind alone. When the heart-mind is like the vast emptiness, unobstructed and free, one who awakens can liberate themselves. Otherwise, sinking through countless kalpas, even boundless compassion cannot save them!

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Since ancient times, all must die. Yet some die before their past-life good roots have ripened; others die before their evil karma has manifested. Some, practicing Buddhism or Daoism, change course midway, leaving their good fruits unripened while their evil karma grows, and thus they die. Others, though wicked all their lives, repent at life’s end—this single thought of remorse can transform their fate, turning them toward goodness and the true Dao.

Thus, in this life, disparities in gender, wealth, poverty, longevity, or early death are not Heaven’s arbitrary distinctions but the natural consequences of one’s own good and evil! If in past lives one delighted in goodness and the Dao, and in this life does the same, heavenly blessings will come, and heaven’s gates open. If not, the path to heaven is barred, with no entrance, and hell’s retribution offers no escape!

First, one must arouse the "mind of faith." By venerating the Three Treasures, one can dissolve kalpas of transgressions, emerge from the sea of suffering, and realize the Great Dao of immortality. Second, one must arouse the "mind of repentance." Repent for kalpas of ignorance, failing to cultivate the original heart-mind and nature, which have been obscured by ignorance and afflictions, sinking into the ghostly realms. This mind of repentance generates boundless merit—like polishing a mirror: once dust is removed, its body shines brilliantly.

Thus, life and death have their root in the heart-mind. To seek immortality, one must honor goodness. Goodness is the foundation of fortune; evil is the harbinger of misfortune. All good and evil arise from the heart-mind! A single good thought is like fertile soil yielding fine grain—nurtured, it flourishes, and the harvest is bountiful. A single evil thought is like clouds veiling the sky—sunlight dimmed, its radiance fades. Yet if one awakens and reforms, it is like wind scattering the clouds: the sky clears, and emptiness shines resplendent!

The nature of the Dao-cultivator is empty and luminous—just so. People ignorant of the true method of cultivation dismiss it as beyond the reach of foolish mortals—how could they ever practice the Dao?

How could the Dao’s root lie elsewhere, apart from one’s own heart-nature? If there were another Dao to cultivate, all buddhas and immortals would be deceiving the world. In truth, to cultivate the heart-mind is to cultivate the Dao. Let one but repent and cultivate oneself with wholeheart, and the Dao is not far off!

Listen to the recitation of scriptures: though their words and phrases be many, they all reveal this one heart-mind. The heart-mind is fundamentally firm, strong, centered, and upright, pure and refined, without a trace of selfish human desire. What is human desire? It is whatever each person craves—wealth or rank, sensual pleasure or fine food—all the manifold greedy and deluded thoughts, all called “desire.” Once this desire sprouts, one strays from celestial nature, becoming lost in illusion and chasing falsehood, descending through countless stages. Thus it is no longer called celestial nature but human desire. Moreover, each person’s desires differ, each unique, not the principle of great unity, not the heart-mind of perfect impartiality—hence they are called “selfish.” From now on, simply remove this selfish heart, eliminate deluded thoughts, and let the entire body shine with light, restoring celestial nature—then the Dao is near at hand! If one awakens to this nature in an instant, that is the great Dao of the Golden Elixir. Daily investigating one’s original nature, one naturally attains liberation from the realm of suffering.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

At the beginning of human life, there is only this one nature, nothing else. This nature is the primordial qi of precelestial origin. Heaven attains clarity through it; earth attains tranquility through it. Humans receive the clear and tranquil qi of heaven and earth to form their bodies, and thus there arises the division of yin and yang, purity and turbidity.

Yet this qi of heaven and earth originates in the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial qi of precelestial origin; because heaven and earth are born from it, it is called “precelestial.” In humans, this qi is called “nature.” Before a person is born, this single speck of true nature enters the mother’s womb, where it takes form through the father’s essence and the mother’s blood. Yet this essence and blood also arise from the clear and tranquil qi of heaven and earth. Once there is essence and blood, form appears, and from the formless realm of pure yang’s original emptiness, one falls into the realm of form. Thus the precelestial qi becomes mixed and formless.

As the *Laozi* says: “Descending from the root, flowing to the branches, it gives birth to the myriad things.” This is what is meant. While still in the mother’s womb, hidden in formlessness, nature and life are as yet undifferentiated. But with the first cry at birth, the vast, luminous, and expansive body of the Great Void is shattered. At that moment, nature is revealed, and life follows, giving rise to the inequalities of poverty and prosperity, long life and early death. Yet the nature itself is fundamentally good.

After birth, the light of nature becomes hidden and unseen, and thus it is called “heart-mind.” Yet nature is the substance of the heart-mind, and the heart-mind is the function of nature. The two are divided like heaven and earth: nature is called “celestial nature,” and the heart-mind is named “the field of the heart-mind.” As for the function of “intention,” it falls to a third stage, flowing ever further, ever more distant, ever more lost—what is meant by “water flowing from Kunlun is no longer clear.”

Once there is form, there arise the disparities of the five senses, the four limbs, the hundred bones, and the six roots. As the *Laozi* says: “Within non-thing, there is thing; within non-being, there is being.” This is precisely what is meant. Only immortals and buddhas deeply comprehend this principle and directly investigate their original nature. Thus the immortals’ “seven reversals and nine returns” are merely refining the emotions to return to nature—returning to nature is what the *Laozi* calls “returning to the root and recovering life.” And the myriad methods of Buddhism are nothing but cultivating and illuminating this nature!

Since time immemorial, humans have been deluded by the nature of ignorance, losing the true source. How can this ignorance also be called “nature”? It is like the vast ocean: both the deep sea and its surging, unfathomable waves are called “sea.” The waves are of the same water as the sea; one cannot say the deep sea is water while the waves are not! If the waves calm and the surges cease, the sea’s clear and tranquil body is restored. If one can subdue the heart-mind, eliminate deluded thoughts, and return the emotions to nature, then the true origin of the Supreme Ultimate, the entire body of creation, will unite with heaven in virtue and with the sun and moon in brightness!

Thus the sages’ practice of “enduring nature” is enduring this ignorance, and my school’s practice of “refining nature” is refining this ignorance. Yet the root of transgression lies in mistakenly identifying the physical body as the self, making all manner of calculations to nourish this body. Though clothing and food may fill the mouth and body, one still feels it is not enough.

Therefore, in the *Laozi*’s scriptures, the first teaching is the method of cutting off obstacles, instructing one not to give rise to greed and anger: greed leads to actions that harm others for personal gain, while anger breeds envy of others’ possessions and resentment of one’s own lack, leading to blame and grievance against heaven and others—sins that accumulate day by day. When the celestial bureaus examine one’s deeds and the earthly courts reduce one’s blessings, and when the great reckoning arrives, one must let go and depart.

Where do all the wealth and emoluments of a lifetime go?
Before the Mirror of Karma, every deed is revealed in truth.
Though one had a mouth on every limb, none could explain—
Only then does one regret the misguided use of the heart-mind in the past.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

In the past, when expounding the classics and discussing scriptures, divine dragons appeared at Longsha: the *Eightfold Scripture* was revealed in Piling, costing tens of thousands; later, to greatly revive the ancestral teachings, the *Fivefold Scripture* was proclaimed, costing thousands more. When propagating the Three Teachings and expounding the *Pure Subtlety Canon*, the scale was somewhat reduced, amounting to over a thousand. Later, when expounding Chan Buddhism, guided by the Buddha’s compassion, all was done frugally to hasten completion. Thus, in all the past expositions of classics and discussions of scriptures, there has never been a lack of great generosity.

Yet as the world’s customs decline and few cherish the Dao, all later teachings and expositions have been scaled to the times and circumstances, avoiding excessive expense. Now that I have taken up this duty, the merit is no small matter. I do not seek to make do with meager means out of stinginess, but rather out of consideration for the modest salary of an official, which leaves little surplus. Thus, I act with frugality—not to slight the sacred teachings, disrespect the revealed texts, or defer to others. Still, the ritual implements required must not be skimped on; the rites are of great importance and demand solemn dignity. Moreover, when unfolding the numinous scriptures, the assembled immortals and attendant deities are no trifling matter—moderation is most fitting.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

Managing the rites while also accumulating recitations of the scriptural treasury is no easy task. Yet you must instruct all disciples well, lest their sincerity scatter or their initial diligence slacken—only then will there be benefit. I spare no effort in guiding you, for I truly wish you to embrace the Dao with earnest faith, arising naturally. This alone is merit. If you can serve the Dao with unwavering devotion, resonance will arise everywhere: blessings will come unbidden, and recompense will abound without seeking. The response between heaven and humanity is swifter than an echo—strive on, my disciples.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

This borderland is barren, its people impoverished, and it has just endured disaster. As a parent to the people, you must cherish them as you would an infant, attending to their every pain and distress with care. Share in their joys and sorrows—this is the duty of a just official. Heaven cherishes life above all, and nothing is weightier than the people’s lives! Those who govern must not only exercise caution in punishment; if they fail to instruct and transform the people, fostering a sense of shame, it is their failing. If they merely cultivate a hollow reputation for broad compassion while allowing rewards and punishments to blur, actions to be misplaced, and the people to lose all reliance—leaving them helpless—this is an even graver failing! When redressing grievances and resolving disputes, deciding cases on a single word; when sparing lives or condemning them, ruling on the finest detail—utmost care is required, and negligence is unforgivable! The ancient worthy officials, like the father of the Duke of Literary Loyalty, earned blessings for their descendants, as the historical records attest. Their merit arose from a heart devoted to preserving life, thereby accumulating boundless good. You must embody this principle of forbearance: cherish the people’s lives, nurture their strength, bestow kindness, and guide them with righteousness. Govern with impartiality, and your blessings will be vast and enduring.

※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※　　　※

The Book of Documents states: “The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality—it ever aligns with the good.” Simply set your heart on goodness, be loyal to the sovereign and compassionate toward the people. For the Miao and Yi tribes, the ignorant and the foolish, govern with authority and soothe with kindness, balancing firmness and gentleness. The *Book of Songs* says: “Neither too rigid nor too yielding, governance flourishes, and all blessings converge.” If you cultivate such a heart and act accordingly, Heaven will surely protect you! Your wishes will naturally align with your heart, and all you seek will be fulfilled. Heaven will not oppose you—how much less will people or spirits?

The children of the frontier commanderies suffer greatly from poverty and hardship; they deserve particular care and compassion. In rooting out hidden wrongs, one must proceed with caution and prudence. The people of the borderlands are quick to embrace civilization, yet also quick to resist it—all depends on the balance of kindness and authority.

*Postscript to the Record of Han San’s Discourses*

What need has the Dao of words? The Dao cannot be spoken. Why then five thousand characters? For the Dao that pervades the cosmos has already distilled its essence in the transmission at the Pass! What need is there for even a single word beyond this?

Yet since its westward crossing, its moral influence has gradually waned. Later doctrines, like the clamor of reed pipes and drums, have mostly taken the remnants of the Five Thousand Words and spat forth their own drivel. As time passed, later generations have gathered this spittle only to spit it back, turning it into a war of tongues—each side attacking the other—far more bewildering and chaotic than the original din.

Our Most Revered Imperial Preceptor, moved by compassion for the deaf and blind, has sounded the bell and rung the clapper to awaken them—no less than the Blue Ox crossing again, raising his voice in urgent cry. Thus, he established the altar at Ezhou, opened the Jade Bureau to scatter golden sands, and expounded the *Mahāyāna Three Grades True Sutra*, expanding what the Five Thousand Words contained and releasing it, gathering what the Five Thousand Words dispersed and uniting it. He fully revealed its subtle meanings, penetrated its true essence, imprinted the sages’ minds, and harmonized the Dao of immortals and buddhas—creating anew a radiant scripture for the world!

In the intervals of expounding the canon, he would occasionally discourse on profound principles or examine passages, all for the sake of the world’s moral order and the human heart. Within these teachings, he exhorted the cultivation of human relationships and the refinement of mind and nature—every word, every character, sufficient to awaken one’s original nature and enlighten later learners. Truly, it is a bridge for saving the world and a raft for ferrying others across.

Those who once basked in his presence privately recorded his words, treasuring them in their collections but failing to circulate them. Now, fortunately, Master Sun of Jinling, while publishing the *Three Grades Sutra* in a convenient format, has compiled these records into a single volume, titled *Record of Han San’s Discourses*, to be printed alongside it as an appendix.

In truth, the Master deeply deplored the obstacle of written words, for they obscure wisdom and delude the foolish, harming the human heart. They incite falsehood and confuse truth, endangering the moral order. If not urgently corrected, the confusion of truth and falsehood will perpetuate the cycle of spittle without end. Though this *Record* may seem a mere remnant of the *Three Grades Sutra*, is it not the very essence of that spittle?

With the Master’s spittle, he awakens the world’s spittle—each drop a sweet dew, seeping into the heart. Those of true nature will savor its essence within the spittle! What then is the difference between scripture and record?

Let the world take it as a record if they wish, as a remnant of the *Three Grades* if they prefer—even as the *Three Grades True Sutra* itself, if they so choose.

This is the record.

Respectfully inscribed on the mid-spring day of the yimao year by Wang Zhen, disciple of the Manifested Perfected One.

*Preface to the* Complete Works of Patriarch Lü: *On Cultivating Truth and Transmitting the Dao*

Of old, the sixteen characters of the Yu Court served as the ancestral transmission of the heart-mind. Thereafter, the transmission of the Kong lineage was confined to a single thread in one word. If this be so, then the transmission of the Dao surely requires no further elaboration.

Yet Zengzi said, "The Master’s words on human nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard." The *Doctrine of the Mean* records many of Confucius’ sayings not found in the *Analects*, suggesting that teachings on nature and Heaven were once detailed but later concealed and not transmitted.

It is said that Patriarch Lü received the Dao from the Perfected Sovereign of Zhengyang, who, with the words "lest I mislead those five hundred years hence," had already perfected his three thousand meritorious deeds—how forthright indeed! Yet upon reading the *On Cultivating Truth and Transmitting the Dao*, one finds the principles of Heaven, humanity, nature, and destiny expounded in exhaustive detail, with intricate repetitions, a far cry from the sixteen characters of the Yu Court or the single thread of the Kong lineage. What then is the reason for this?

The *Collection* was transmitted to Shi Jianwu of Huayang, who, having passed the imperial examinations during the Yuanhe era of the Tang, retired to Mount West in Hongzhou, vowing never to serve in office. He once wrote a poem: *"Qi is the elixir of longevity, the heart its guide; / When qi and spirit know their course, the master becomes immortal."* From this, one may discern his cultivation!

When Patriarch Lü wandered to Mu, he saw Shi’s aspiration for the rosy clouds and bestowed upon him the Great Dao of the Returned Elixir. Thus did the *Collection* come to be transmitted. However, in those days of oral instruction, there must have been secret oral formulas too sacred to commit to writing—what was called "mouth-to-mouth transmission, unrecorded in text"—which are now lost to us.

The original text contained many errors; those that were corrupt or mistaken have been corrected here, while the rest remain unresolved. The eighteen chapters are divided into two scrolls.

**On True Immortals (I)**

Patriarch Lü said: When a person is born, how may they dwell in peace without illness, remain robust without aging, live without dying? By what Dao can this be achieved?

Master Zhongli said: Human life begins when father and mother unite, and the two qi converge, forming the embryo from essence and blood. After the Great Beginning comes the Great Substance: yin receives yang to generate life, and qi follows the transformation of the fetus. After three hundred days, the form is complete, and the numinous light enters the body, separating from the mother. After the Great Simplicity, there is already ascent and descent, and the Yellow Sprout grows. After five thousand days, the qi is full, its measure naturally reaching eighty-one zhang. At fifteen, one is called a "youthful lad." At this time, yang is half within yin, comparable to the light of the eastern sun. Beyond this, one loses the primal yang, dissipates the true qi, and with qi weakened, illness, aging, and death follow.

Foolish in life, one harms their own numinous light; wicked in a lifetime, one erodes their allotted years. Thus, in future lives, bodies differ in rank, lifespans vary in length, and after birth comes extinction, after extinction rebirth—endlessly deluded, life after life they fall, losing their form to other species, their spirit to alien shells. The root-nature of the utmost truth no longer returns to humanity; they revolve in the byways of samsara, forever without liberation. If they encounter a true immortal or perfected being who absolves their karmic retribution, they may shed their skin and shell to regain a human form. Yet they remain in stupor and ignorance, accumulating merit over a hundred kalpas to ascend to the Land of Blessing, still not free from hunger, cold, and lingering suffering. Gradually, they rise, their form slowly restored, yet they dwell among slaves and servants in lowly stations. Should they repeat past transgressions, they will, like a ball rolling down a board, re-enter the byways of samsara.

Patriarch Lü said: Born in the Central Kingdom, fortunate to live in an age of peace, with clothing and food sufficient and time not yet lost—those who love find peace, while those who resent fall ill; those who covet live, while those who fear die.

Today, having the honor to meet Your Reverence face to face, I bow again and again to implore: considering the gravity of life and death, dare I hope for an exposition of the principle of freedom from illness and death, that this poor scholar may receive instruction?

Patriarch Zhong said: If one wishes to escape the wheel of rebirth and avoid entering the shells of other beings, ensuring that the body remains free from the sufferings of illness, old age, and death—standing firm beneath heaven, embracing yin while holding yang—then one must be human. As a human, one should not become a ghost; among humans, one cultivates to become an immortal; among immortals, one ascends to become a celestial.

Patriarch Lü said: When a person dies, they become a ghost; when the Dao is accomplished, they become an immortal. Immortals are of one rank—why then speak of ascending from immortality to become celestial?

Patriarch Zhong said: Immortals are not of one kind. Those purely yin without yang are ghosts; those purely yang without yin are immortals; those with mixed yin and yang are humans. Only humans may become ghosts or immortals. If in youth one does not cultivate but indulges in passion and desire, they fall ill and die to become ghosts. If one awakens and cultivates, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood, shedding the mortal form to become an immortal—immortals have five ranks, and the Dao has three degrees of accomplishment. Cultivation lies with the individual, while attainment follows one’s allotted portion.

Patriarch Lü said: You speak of "three degrees of accomplishment" in the Dao and "five ranks of immortals"—what does this mean?

Patriarch Zhong said: The three degrees of accomplishment are the distinctions between minor, intermediate, and major attainment. The five ranks of immortals are ghost immortals, human immortals, earthly immortals, divine immortals, and celestial immortals—all are immortals, yet not equal. Ghost immortals do not depart from ghosts; human immortals do not depart from humans; earthly immortals do not depart from earth; divine immortals do not depart from spirits; celestial immortals do not depart from heaven.

Patriarch Lü said: What is meant by "ghost immortals"?

Patriarch Zhong said: Ghost immortals are the lowest of the five. They transcend within yin, their spirit-images unclear, their names absent from the ghostly registers, unrecorded in the three sacred mountains. Though they do not enter the wheel of rebirth, they struggle to return to Penglai or Yingzhou, ultimately finding no refuge but to reincarnate in borrowed vessels. Such is their fate.

Patriarch Lü said: By what arts and through what efforts do such ghost immortals attain this state?

Patriarch Zhong said: Those who cultivate yet fail to awaken to the great Dao, seeking swift attainment, become like withered wood, their hearts as dead ash. Their spirit and consciousness turn inward, their will undivided. From deep meditation, they project a yin spirit—a ghost of pure clarity, not a being of pure yang. Because their will remains fixed in yin clarity, they are called ghost immortals. Though termed immortals, they are in truth ghosts. Many followers of Buddhism who practice to this point claim to have attained the Dao (in their tradition, those who truly master it are called *golden immortals*), which is truly laughable.

Patriarch Lü said: What then are "human immortals"?

Patriarch Zhong said: Human immortals are the second lowest of the five. Cultivators of the Dao who do not awaken to the great Dao may grasp one method within the Dao, one technique within that method, and with steadfast faith and unwavering resolve, persist without deviation for a lifetime. The qi of the five phases harmonize and unite, their form and substance stabilized, the eight perverse influences unable to harm them. They enjoy good health with few ailments—this is called a human immortal.

Patriarch Lü said: By what arts and through what efforts do such human immortals attain this state?

Patriarch Zhong said: Those who cultivate may initially hear of the great Dao. Yet burdened by heavy karma and meager blessings, beset by demonic obstacles, they abandon their original intent, settling for minor attainment. Their practice bears fruit, but they remain fixed for life, unable to progress, their methods unchanging with the seasons. Those who renounce the five flavors—how would they know of the six qi? Those who forget the seven emotions—how would they know of the ten precepts?

Those who practice rinsing and swallowing (pron. *yàn*) mistake it for the art of exhalation and inhalation; those who cling to sexual arts deride purity as foolishness. Those who delight in wresting qi from things rather than from heaven and earth refuse to abandon grain; those who prefer visualization to draw the essence of the sun and moon refuse to practice daoyin. Sitting alone in breath-holding—how would they know of spontaneity? Bending the body and straining the form—how would they recognize non-action? Those who absorb yin by taking women’s qi differ from those who shrink the golden turtle; those who nurture yang by consuming women’s milk differ from those who refine the elixir. Extending this by analogy, such methods are countless, yet all belong to the Dao. Unable to embrace the great Dao in its entirety, they settle for one method or one technique within it, achieving success and peace, prolonging life—this is what is called a human immortal.

There is another class: those who delight in fleeting moments, weary of perseverance, practice carelessly, err in timing, and disrupt their days. Instead of prolonging life, they invite illness—such cases abound in the world.

**Patriarch Lü said:** What is meant by an "earth immortal"?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** An earth immortal stands halfway between heaven and earth, possessing the talent of an immortal. Failing to awaken to the great Dao, they halt at minor attainment. Though their progress is not outwardly visible, they achieve longevity and dwell in the world without dying—this is an earth immortal.

**Patriarch Lü said:** How does one begin the path to becoming an earth immortal?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** First, one must grasp the principle of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, and the numbers of the sun and moon’s generation. Within the body, one employs years and months; within the day, one employs hours and moments. First, recognize the dragon and tiger; next, pair Kan and Li. Distinguish the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source, discern the early and late of the qi’s seasons. Gather the true One, observe the Two Modes, array the Three Powers, divide the Four Images, distinguish the Five Movements, stabilize the Six Qi, assemble the Seven Treasures, order the Eight Trigrams, and traverse the Nine Provinces. With the five phases inverted, qi is transmitted from mother to child, and fluids circulate between husband and wife. The Three Fields are reversed, the elixir is refined through firing, and forever anchored in the lower field. The body is tempered to dwell in the world, achieving immortality and becoming a land-bound immortal—this is called an earth immortal.

**Patriarch Lü said:** What is meant by a "divine immortal"?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** A divine immortal is one who, weary of dwelling in the dusty world, persists in cultivation without cease. Their joints interconnect, lead is drawn and mercury added, refining golden essence to the crown; jade liquid returns as the elixir, tempering form into qi, and the five qi ascend to the origin. The three yang gather at the crown, merit is fulfilled, and form is forgotten—the fetal immortal transforms spontaneously. Yin is exhausted, yang is pure, a body exists beyond the body, and one sheds the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal. Transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood, they bid farewell to the mundane, returning to the Three Mountains—this is called a divine immortal.

**Patriarch Lü said:** What is meant by a "celestial immortal"?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** When an earth immortal, weary of dwelling in the dusty world, persists in cultivation without cease and achieves liberation, this is called a divine immortal. When a divine immortal, weary of dwelling on the Three Isles, transmits the Dao among humans, accumulating merit in the Dao above and conduct among people below, their merit and conduct fulfilled, they receive the celestial writ to return to the Grotto-Heavens—this is called a celestial immortal. Once a celestial immortal, if weary of dwelling in the Grotto-Heavens, they may assume office as an immortal official: the lower are water officials, the middle are earth officials, and the upper are celestial officials. Having rendered great service to heaven and earth and great conduct through past and present, they are promoted through the ranks, serving in the thirty-six Grotto-Heavens before returning to the eighty-one Yang Heavens; having served in the eighty-one Yang Heavens, they return to the realm of the Three Pure Ones—void, spontaneous, and natural.

**Patriarch Lü said:** Ghost immortals are surely beyond pursuit, and celestial immortals are not yet dared to be hoped for. Might I hear of the methods for human immortals, earth immortals, and divine immortals?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** Human immortals do not transcend minor attainment; earth immortals do not transcend intermediate attainment; divine immortals do not transcend major attainment. These three levels of attainment are, in truth, one. Employing methods to seek the Dao—the Dao is not difficult. Employing the Dao to seek immortality—immortality is also quite easy.

**Patriarch Lü said:** From ancient times to the present, those who cultivate life have not failed to seek longevity or ascension as immortals. Yet why do so few achieve longevity or ascension?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** Their methods do not align with the Dao. Overly reliant on extensive learning and forced memorization, they cling to minor techniques and side doors, yet still succumb to illness and death, falsely claiming "corpse liberation" (*shijie*, pron. *jiǎ*), misleading the world and mutually praising one another, thereby obscuring the great Dao. Even those with sincere faith and steadfast resolve, who practice diligently for years, ultimately see no results, their seasons passing into the Yellow Springs. Alas!

**On the Great Dao, Part Two**

**Patriarch Lü said:** What is meant by the "Great Dao"?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** The Great Dao is formless and nameless, unasked and unanswered. Vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all measure. It cannot be known, nor can it be practiced!

**Patriarch Lü said:** From ancient times to the present, those of profound understanding first study the Dao, then attain the Dao, then master the Dao, then perfect the Dao. They leave the dusty world for Penglai Isle, ascend to the Grotto-Heavens, rise to the Heaven of Yang, and finally ascend to the Three Pure Realms—all are those who have perfected the Dao. Yet today, Master, you alone say the Dao cannot be known or practiced. Does this mean the Dao remains hidden from us?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** In truth, I have concealed nothing of the Dao. But those in the world who claim to follow the Dao possess only the name of loving it. They hear of the Great Dao yet lack faith; they have faith yet lack perseverance. They change their minds by evening from what they resolved in the morning, forget what they sit to do the moment they stand. They begin with diligence but end in slackness. Thus, I say the Great Dao is difficult to know and difficult to practice.

**Patriarch Lü said:** What is the principle behind the Dao being difficult to know and difficult to practice?

**Patriarch Zhong said:** Because minor techniques and side doors yield quick results, they are passed down endlessly, and even at death, practitioners remain deluded. This has become a common custom, corrupting the Great Dao. Some practice fasting, some abstain from grain, some gather *qi*, some rinse and swallow, some leave their wives, some forsake flavors, some meditate in *dhyāna*, some maintain silence, some visualize, some absorb *yin*, some ingest *qi*, some uphold purity, some calm the mind, some cut off thoughts, some open the crown, some retract the genitals, some sever desires, some read and recite, some refine through fire, some regulate breath, some practice *daoyin*, some exhale and inhale, some take and replenish, some give alms, some make offerings, some perform acts of salvation, some retreat to mountains, some recognize their nature, some remain unmoving, some uphold precepts. The minor techniques and side doors are too numerous to recount.

As for those who gather the essence of sun and moon, seize the *qi* of heaven and earth, fix their minds and thoughts in hopes of congealing cinnabar, or exhaust their bodies in pursuit of liberation—if they take in more than they release, it may cure illness; if they consider it true "embryonic breathing," cutting off thoughts and forgetting speech, it may nurture their nature; if they mistake it for the *qi* of the Great One or the "unfailing golden spear," the "reversed flow of the Yellow River," it is but a lesser method for preserving life. To make the body like withered wood and the mind like dead ashes is but a minor art of gathering spirit. Alas! Why do those who follow the Dao, past and present, cling so stubbornly to these misguided pursuits?

Swallowing saliva as medicine—how can one attain the workings of creation? Gathering *qi* as elixir—how can it be made to abide? Calling the liver a dragon and the lungs a tiger—how can they unite? Taking *kan* as lead and *li* as mercury—how can they be refined and replenished? Watering through the four seasons in hopes of growing the yellow sprout; fixing the mind unwaveringly to seek the great medicine; mistaking years and months, wasting days and disrupting hours. Without knowing the root of the five phases, how can one comprehend the creative transformations of the Three Powers? Seeking branches and plucking leaves, they mislead later generations. Thus the Great Dao grows ever more distant and neglected, while heterodoxies arise and become custom, losing the original intent of the early masters. This is truly due to learning from hearsay and street-corner talk, mere oral transmission, passing finger gestures to the ignorant, teaching one another in succession, until they descend into the springs below—it chills the heart.

Not that I do not wish to expound the Great Dao, but the world’s people bear heavy karma and meager fortune, disbelieving in the celestial mechanism, prizing wealth over life, content to become lesser ghosts.

Master Lü said: "The lesser methods and side doors are now understood. As for the Great Dao, may I hear of it?"

Master Zhong said: "The Dao originally has no questions; questions originally have no answers. Yet when the true source divides, the great simplicity scatters. The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three. The One is essence; the Two is function; the Three is transformation. Essence and function do not depart from yin and yang; transformations all arise from their union. Above, middle, and below are arrayed as the Three Powers; heaven, earth, and humanity share in the one Dao. The Dao gives birth to the two *qi*; the two *qi* give birth to the Three Powers; the Three Powers give birth to the five phases; the five phases give birth to the myriad things. Among the myriad things, none is more numinous or noble than humanity. Only humanity can fathom the principles of the myriad things and fulfill its own nature. To fathom principles and fulfill nature to the point of destiny, to preserve life in its entirety and merge with the Dao—this is to stand firm with heaven and earth, sharing their longevity."

Master Lü said: "Heaven and earth endure eternally, spanning millennia without end. Human life lasts a hundred years, and even seventy is rare. Why is the Dao so near to heaven and earth yet so distant from humanity?"

Master Zhong said: "The Dao is not distant from humanity; humanity distances itself from the Dao. The reason it distances itself from the Dao is that it does not know the method of nurturing life. The reason it does not know the method is that its lesser practices fail to recognize the proper time. The reason it does not recognize the proper time is that it does not grasp the mechanism of heaven and earth."

**On the Mechanism of Heaven and Earth, III**

Master Lü said: "What is meant by 'the mechanism of heaven and earth'? May I hear of it?"

Master Zhong said: "The mechanism of heaven and earth is how heaven and earth employ the Great Dao, ascending and descending without cease, acting tirelessly to attain their enduring firmness. They have never lightly revealed it to humanity."

Master Lü said: "How does heaven and earth’s employment of the Dao constitute their 'mechanism of operation'? How does their 'mechanism of action' manifest? How does operation begin? How is efficacy seen?"

Master Zhong said: "Once the Great Dao divides and takes form, form gives rise to number. Heaven embodies the *qian* Dao, taking the One as its essence, light and pure above—what it employs is yang. Earth embodies the *kun* Dao, taking the Two as its essence, heavy and turbid below—what it employs is yin. Yang ascends and yin descends, mutually uniting. *Qian* and *kun* act without departing from the Dao, their beginnings timed, their efficacy manifest in due course."

Master Lü said: "Heaven embodies the *qian* Dao, employing yang. Yang governs ascent—how then does it unite with earth? Earth embodies the *kun* Dao, employing yin. Yin governs descent—how then does it unite with heaven? If heaven and earth do not unite, how can yin and yang merge? If yin and yang do not merge, how can *qian* and *kun* act? If *qian* and *kun* do not act, though there be a time for beginning and a day for efficacy, how can the Great Dao be attained?"

Master Zhong said: "The Dao of heaven takes *qian* as its essence and yang as its function, accumulating *qi* above. The Dao of earth takes *kun* as its essence and yin as its function, accumulating water below. Heaven’s enactment of the Dao is *qian* seeking (*suo*) *kun*. At the first seeking, it produces the eldest son, the eldest son called *zhen*; at the second seeking, the middle son, the middle son called *kan*; at the third seeking, the youngest son, the youngest son called *gen*. Thus heaven unites with earth, *qian* Dao seeking *kun* Dao to give birth to the three yang. Then earth’s enactment of the Dao is *kun* seeking *qian*. At the first seeking, it produces the eldest daughter, the eldest daughter called *xun*; at the second seeking, the middle daughter, the middle daughter called *li*; at the third seeking, the youngest daughter, the youngest daughter called *dui*. Thus earth unites with heaven, *kun* Dao seeking *qian* Dao to give birth to the three yin. The three yang unite with the three yin, and the myriad things are born; the three yin unite with the three yang, and the myriad things are completed. The union of heaven and earth fundamentally arises from *qian* and *kun* seeking one another, operating within the Dao. *Qian* and *kun* seeking one another give birth to the six *qi*; the six *qi* unite to divide the five phases; the five phases unite to give birth to and complete the myriad things.

When the *qian* Dao descends, the three seekings conclude, and its yang ascends again, yang concealing yin within, returning above to heaven. When the *kun* Dao ascends, the three seekings conclude, and its yin descends again, yin concealing yang within, returning below to earth. Yang concealing yin—its yin does not dissipate, and is called true yin. When true yin reaches heaven, it is born through yang, so when yin descends from heaven, can yin be without yang? Yin concealing yang—its yang does not perish, and is called true yang. When true yang reaches earth, it is activated through yin, so when yang ascends from earth, can yang be without yin? Yang concealing yin—its yin does not dissipate, and returns to earth; yin concealing yang—its yang does not perish, and returns to heaven."

Revolving in endless cycles, its movement ceaseless. When their union never strays from the Dao, this is how they endure, steadfast and enduring. Master Lü said: The mechanism of heaven and earth moves within the Dao, thus attaining longevity—this is the workings of heaven and earth. Yet man, though endowed with intelligence and a nature inclined toward purity, may aspire to follow the Great Dao: in small measure, to enjoy peace and prolong life; in moderate measure, to attain immortality; in great measure, to shed the mortal form and ascend as an immortal. How then does one apply this work, moving the Great Dao to activate the celestial mechanism, thereby also achieving enduring steadfastness and eternal existence through the eons?

Master Zhong said: The Great Dao is formless, taking form through what it bestows; the Great Dao is nameless, acquiring names through what it possesses. Heaven and earth receive it and call it the *qian* Dao and *kun* Dao; the sun and moon receive it and call it the yang Dao and yin Dao. When man receives it in the court, it is called the Dao of ruler and minister; in the inner chambers, the Dao of husband and wife; in the village, the Dao of elder and younger; in the school, the Dao of friends; in the household, the Dao of father and son. Thus, all that appears externally is pervaded by the Dao.

As for the union of father and mother: the father’s yang advances first, while yin follows behind, true *qi* meeting true water. The fire of the heart and the water of the kidneys unite, refined into essence. Once this essence is released, encountering the mother’s yin, water advances first, cleansing the useless places; encountering the mother’s yang, blood advances first, received before the womb. Essence and blood form the embryo, containing true *qi*, entering the mother’s womb. Over days and months, true *qi* transforms and shapes the person, just as heaven and earth follow the Dao, *qian* and *kun* seeking one another, giving rise to the three yins and three yangs. True *qi* is yang, true water is yin. Yang conceals water within, yin conceals *qi* within. *Qi* governs ascent, and within *qi* lies true water; water governs descent, and within water lies true *qi*. True water is true yin, true *qi* is true yang.

True yang follows water in its descent, like *qian* seeking *kun*: above is *zhen*, in the middle is *kan*, below is *gen*. Comparing this to man, taking the center as the standard, from above to below: *zhen* is the liver, *kan* is the kidneys, *gen* is the bladder. True yin follows *qi* in its ascent, like *kun* seeking *qian*: below is *xun*, in the middle is *li*, above is *dui*. Comparing this to man, taking the center as the standard, from below to above: *xun* is the gallbladder, *li* is the heart, *dui* is the lungs. Once the form is complete and the term is fulfilled, the child departs from the mother.

After birth, primordial yang resides in the kidneys. From primordial yang arises true *qi*, and true *qi* ascends to the heart; from true *qi* arises true fluid, and true fluid returns to the origin. Ascending and descending in cycles, if nothing is depleted, one may naturally prolong life. If one knows the timing without error and regulates withdrawal and supplementation with precision, one may naturally attain longevity. If one practices without weariness and cultivates without cease, yin will be exhausted and yang purified, allowing one to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood. This is the profound principle of the celestial mechanism, a matter not transmitted through the ages.

If you hold faith without hesitation, regard fame and profit as shackles, love and affection as enemies, avoid illness as one fears death, guard against losing the body to another shell, and contemplate the escape of the spirit into other forms—then, with a mind of purity, you must first sever the root, preventing the loss of primordial yang and the dissipation of true *qi*. When *qi* is abundant, the hun-soul is free of yin; when yang is robust, the po-soul contains *qi*. In ascent and descent, one takes heaven and earth as the model; in waxing and waning, one follows the sun and moon.

**On the Sun and Moon, Fourth Discourse**
Master Lü said: The principles of heaven and earth are now roughly understood. Can the celestial movements and conjunctions of the sun and moon be compared to man? I wish to hear of this.

Master Zhong said: The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth; the Great Dao is nameless, moving the sun and moon. The sun and moon are the essences of great yang and great yin, silently recording the degrees of heaven and earth’s union, aiding in the work of generating and completing the myriad things. Rising and setting in the east and west, they divide day and night; moving north and south, they determine cold and heat. Unceasing in their cycles, cold and heat spur one another on. Within the po-soul, the hun-soul is born; within the hun-soul, the po-soul is born. Advancing and retreating in due time, they do not stray from the reckoning of *qian* and *kun*; coming and going with measure, they do not err from the timing of heaven and earth.

Master Lü said: Rising and setting in the east and west to divide day and night—how is this so?

Master Zhong said: When the primordial chaos first divided, darkness and light settled into place. The forms of heaven and earth resemble an egg; the six directions converge at the center, round as a sphere. The sun and moon rise and set, moving above the heavens and below the earth. Above and below, east and west, they revolve like a wheel. When the sun rises in the east and has not yet set in the west, it is day; when it sets in the west and has not yet risen in the east, it is night—this is how the sun’s rising and setting divide day and night. The moon’s rising and setting differ from the sun’s. It receives its po-soul in the west and its hun-soul in the east, shining its light by night while its hun-soul is concealed by day. Over days and hours, it rises and sets, moving from west to east. At first, within the po-soul, the hun-soul is born, appearing like a drawn bow, its light shining in the west at early night. Next, the po-soul contains half the hun-soul, corresponding to the first quarter, its light shining in the south at early night. Then, the po-soul is full of the hun-soul, facing the sun, its light shining in the east at early night. Next, within the hun-soul, the po-soul is born, appearing like a broken mirror, its hun-soul concealed in the west at early day. Then, the hun-soul contains half the po-soul, corresponding to the last quarter, its po-soul concealed in the south at early day.

Next, the hun-soul is full of the po-soul, facing away from the sun, its po-soul concealed in the east at early day. This is how the moon’s rising and setting divides day and night.

Master Lü said: "The south-north movement determines cold and heat—why is this?"
Master Zhong said: "After the winter solstice, the sun rises at the initial fifty *fen* of *chen* and sets at the final fifty *fen* of *shen*. From this point onward, its rising and setting shift from south to north, reaching the summer solstice as its limit. After the summer solstice, the sun rises at the final fifty *fen* of *yin* and sets at the initial fifty *fen* of *xu*. From this point onward, its rising and setting shift from north to south, reaching the winter solstice as its limit. From south to north, from winter to summer, cold transforms into heat. From north to south, from summer to winter, heat transforms into cold. The summer day is the winter night; the winter day is the summer night. After the winter solstice, the moon rises from north to south, corresponding to the summer day. After the summer solstice, the moon rises from south to north, corresponding to the winter day. This is how the sun and moon’s movement determines cold and heat."

Master Lü said: "The mechanism of Heaven and Earth, the ascent and descent of yin and yang—it is no different from a person’s cultivation. If the sun and moon’s rising and setting, their cyclical movements and conjunctions, can they be compared to humans?"
Master Zhong said: "The mechanism of Heaven and Earth lies in the ascent and descent of yin and yang. One ascent, one descent—Taiyi generates itself, generation and completion following one another in endless cycles, never deviating from the Dao, thus attaining longevity. Those who cultivate the Dao, if they take Heaven and Earth as their model, may likewise achieve immortality and never die. If compared to the sun and moon’s cyclical movements and conjunctions, it is merely the moon receiving the sun’s hun-soul, transforming yang into yin. When yin is exhausted and yang is pure, the moon’s brilliance becomes flawless, dispelling the dark po-soul like the sun’s radiance illuminating the earth below. At this time, it is like a person’s refinement—using qi to perfect spirit, shedding the mortal form to ascend as an immortal, forging a body of pure yang."

Master Lü said: "For those who cultivate the Dao and uphold its principles, in applying the principles of Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang ascent and descent, and the sun and moon’s essence in conjunction—where should one begin?"
Master Zhong said: "First, emulate the mechanism of Heaven, using the principle of yin-yang ascent and descent to unite true water and true fire, refining them into the great elixir, eternally guarding the *dantian*, enduring through eons without death, and matching the lifespan of Heaven and Earth. If weary of the mundane world and continuing one’s practice, one should then take the sun and moon’s conjunction, using yang to refine yin so that yin does not arise, and using qi to nourish spirit so that spirit does not scatter. The five qi gather at the origin, the three flowers converge at the crown, cutting ties with the vulgar world to return to the Three Isles."

Master Lü said: "If one’s merit and verification deeply grasp this purport, the only concern is missing the proper timing!"
Master Zhong said: "The ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang conjoin once a year. The sun and moon’s essence come and go, conjoining once a month. A person’s qi and fluids conjoin once a day and night."

**On the Four Seasons, Fifth Section**

Master Lü said: "Regarding the conjunctions of Heaven and Earth and the sun and moon—can you explain their timing in years, months, days, and hours?"
Master Zhong said: "There are four types of seasons: For a human lifespan of a hundred years, from one to thirty is the time of youth and vigor; from thirty to sixty is the time of maturity; from sixty to ninety is the time of old age; from ninety to a hundred, or even a hundred and twenty, is the time of decline—this is the first type, the seasons within the body. If one takes the twelve earthly branches as a day, five days as a *hou*, three *hou* as a *qi*, three *qi* as a *jie*, and two *jie* as a season, then the seasons are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. When the season is spring, yin contains half of yang, its qi transforming cold into warmth—this is the time of spring. When the season is summer, yang contains yang, its qi transforming warmth into heat—this is the time of summer. When the season is autumn, yang contains half of yin, its qi transforming heat into coolness—this is the time of autumn. When the season is winter, yin contains yin, its qi transforming coolness into cold—this is the time of winter. This is the second type, the seasons within a year.

If one begins with *lü* in the middle of the pitch pipes and *lü* in the middle of the pitch standards, then in one month of thirty days, there are three hundred and sixty *chen*, three thousand *ke*, and one hundred and eighty thousand *fen*. From the new moon to the first quarter, yin contains half of yang; from the first quarter to the full moon, yang contains yang; from the full moon to the last quarter, yang contains half of yin; from the last quarter to the dark moon, yin contains yin. This is the third type, the seasons within a day and month.

If one takes sixty *fen* as a *ke*, eight *ke* and twenty *fen* as an hour, and one and a half hours as a hexagram, then the hexagrams determine the eight directions, and their proper divisions are the four positions. From *zi* to *mao*, yin contains half of yang, with *taiyin* giving rise to *shaoyang*; from *mao* to *wu*, yang contains yang, with pure *shaoyang* giving rise to *taiyang*; from *wu* to *you*, yang contains half of yin, with *taiyang* giving rise to *shaoyin*; from *you* to *zi*, yin contains yin, with pure *shaoyin* giving rise to *taiyin*. This is the fourth type, the seasons within a day.

That which is hard to gain yet easy to lose is the season within the body. That which departs swiftly and returns slowly is the month within the year. That which is fleeting as lightning, swift as a spark struck from stone, is the *chen* within the day. Days accumulate into months, months into years—years and months pass in haste, time flies swiftly. Yet one remains ensnared by the pursuit of fame and profit, the restless mind unchecked, bound by affection for children and grandchildren. Even if one turns back to the Dao, alas, age has advanced and qi has declined, like spring snow or autumn flowers—only a fleeting glimpse remains."

As the evening sun and morning moon, their light cannot endure long. For those who follow the Dao, what is hardest to attain is the season within the body. Bright sun and gentle breezes, a hundred flowers in bloom, waterside pavilions and lofty towers, refreshing winds and carefree moments, moonlit conversations and snowy-day drinking—indulging in endless pleasures, they fritter away their fleeting emotions. Even if one turns back to the Dao, one is already bound by illness like a broken boat yet to cross the river—who would not seek rescue? A leaky roof repaired once over, who could bear to abandon all thought of mending it again? For those who follow the Dao, what is idly wasted is the season within the year. The cock has not yet crowed, yet stepping out the door feels too late; the street drums resound everywhere, yet returning home seems too soon. Greed and delusion—when will they ever pause? Vain thoughts and endless worries—gold and jade fill the hall, yet when illness strikes, what can withstand it? A single glance at children and grandchildren, and with one breath gone, who can take their place? Day and night unceasing, yet the world does not awaken. For those who follow the Dao, what is most lamentable is the *chen* within the day.

Master Lü said: "The season within the body, the season within the year, the season within the month, the *chen* within the day—all are seasons. Yet the Venerable Master singles out the season within the body as hardest to attain, and the *chen* within the day as most lamentable. Why is this?"

Master Zhong said: "For those who follow the Dao, youth is hardest to attain. In youth, the root and origin are whole and firm, and all things are easily accomplished—with just a thousand days, great achievement is possible. For those who follow the Dao, middle age is also hard to attain. In middle age, cultivation begins with replenishment and completion, then proceeds to progress in practice. First, one returns from old age to youth; later, one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood. If one does not awaken in youth or reflect in middle age, one may turn to purity of mind only after disaster strikes, or aspire to the subtle and tranquil only after falling ill. In old age, cultivation begins with rescue and protection, then moves to replenishment, and only then to the lesser-perfection method, accumulating merit to reach the middle-perfection. With the middle-perfection method, merit accumulates only to the point of returning from old age to youth and refining the form to abide in the world. Yet the five *qi* cannot ascend to the origin, the three yang cannot gather at the crown, and shedding the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal remains unattainable. Thus, what is hardest to attain is the season within the body."

Master Lü said: "The season within the body is indeed hard to attain. But why is the *chen* within the day most lamentable?"

Master Zhong said: "A single day for a person is like a month for the sun and moon, like a year for heaven and earth. The Great Dao gives birth to heaven and earth, which take their positions, separated by eighty-four thousand *li* above and below. After the winter solstice, yang within the earth ascends. For each *qi*, fifteen days pass as it rises seven thousand *li*. After one hundred eighty days, yang ascends to heaven, and the Supreme Ultimate generates yin. After the summer solstice, yin within heaven descends. For each *qi*, fifteen days pass as it descends seven thousand *li*. After one hundred eighty days, yin descends to earth, and the Supreme Ultimate once more generates yang. Thus it cycles endlessly, operating without cease, never straying from the Dao, and so heaven and earth endure in their movement.

The sun and moon take form, each with a circumference of eight hundred forty *li*. After the new moon, the six within gives rise to the nine. For each day, twelve *chen* pass, and the *hun* within the *po* advances seventy *li*. After fifteen days, one hundred eighty *chen* pass, and the *hun* within the *po* advances eight hundred forty *li*. After the full moon, the nine within gives rise to the six. For each day, twelve *chen* pass, and the *po* within the *hun* advances seventy *li*. After fifteen days, one hundred eighty *chen* pass, and the *po* within the *hun* advances eight hundred forty *li*. Thus it cycles endlessly, operating without cease, never straying from the Dao, and so the Great Dao is made firm and all things are nourished.

Among all things, the most numinous and noble is the human. Between a person’s heart and kidneys, above and below are separated by eight *cun* and four *fen*. The ascent and descent of yin and yang are no different from those of heaven and earth. Within *qi*, fluid is born; within fluid, *qi* is born. *Qi* and fluid generate each other, following the same path as the sun and moon. Heaven and earth seek each other through *qian* and *kun*, and yin and yang ascend and descend, exchanging once a year without straying from the Dao—thus after one year, there is another year. The sun and moon generate each other through *hun* and *po*, and their essence and brilliance come and go, exchanging once a month without straying from the Dao—thus after one month, there is another month.

Yet for humans, though the exchange occurs within a single day and night, they do not know the time of exchange, nor the method of gathering and refining. When it is time to reduce, they do not know how to supplement; when it is time to increase, they do not know how to gather. When yin exchanges, they do not know how to nurture yang; when yang exchanges, they do not know how to refine yin. They do not understand reduction and increase within the month, nor do they practice cultivation within the day. Thus, after a year passes, there is no new year; after a day passes, there is no new day. Sleeping in drafts and dampness, braving heat and cold, unwilling to cultivate, they willingly invite illness. Idly passing the hours, they sit and await death."

Master Lü said: "Those who follow the Dao are not unaware that the years pass in vain, that the months slip away, that illness clings to the body, and that the limit of death approaches. Yet because they do not know the method of refinement or the time for practice, yin and yang exchange amiss, and the timing of their cultivation is imprecise."

Master Zhong said: "Within the body, use the year; within the year, use the month; within the month, use the day; within the day, use the *chen*. For the *qi* of the five viscera, the month has its waxing and waning, the day its advance and retreat, the *chen* its exchanges. As the *qi* moves through the five phases, it transmits through the six periods. Metal, wood, water, fire, earth—arranged without error. East, west, south, north, center—generated and completed by number. Refine essence to generate true *qi*; refine *qi* to unite with the yang spirit; refine spirit to unite with the Great Dao."

Master Lü said: "What is meant by 'the *qi* of the five viscera'? They are metal, wood, water, fire, earth. What is meant by 'the positions of the five phases'? They are east, west, south, north, center."

"How does one achieve mutual generation and completion, with exchanges occurring at their proper times? When does one gather and refine? I wish to hear this explanation."

Master Zhong said: "Once the Great Dao divided and gave birth to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth separated and arrayed the Five Emperors: in the East is the Azure Emperor, who executes the spring mandate, initiating yang within yin to make the myriad things grow; in the South is the Vermilion Emperor, who executes the summer mandate, ascending yang within yang to make the myriad things flourish; in the West is the White Emperor, who executes the autumn mandate, initiating yin within yang to make the myriad things mature; in the North is the Black Emperor, who executes the winter mandate, advancing yin within yin to make the myriad things perish. Each of the four seasons lasts ninety days, with the Yellow Emperor presiding over the final eighteen days of each season. Thus, in spring, one assists the Azure Emperor in engendering life; in summer, one follows the Vermilion Emperor in nurturing growth; in autumn, one aids the White Emperor in bringing fruition; in winter, one restrains the Black Emperor to enforce severity. The Five Emperors govern in turn, each ruling seventy-two days, totaling three hundred sixty days to form one year, assisting Heaven and Earth in executing the Dao.

The Azure Emperor’s offspring are *jia* and *yi*, *jia-yi* being the wood of the East; the Vermilion Emperor’s offspring are *bing* and *ding*, *bing-ding* being the fire of the South; the Yellow Emperor’s offspring are *wu* and *ji*, *wu-ji* being the earth of the Center; the White Emperor’s offspring are *geng* and *xin*, *geng-xin* being the metal of the West; the Black Emperor’s offspring are *ren* and *gui*, *ren-gui* being the water of the North.

Manifest in time as symbols: wood is the Azure Dragon, fire the Vermilion Bird, earth the Curved Array, metal the White Tiger, water the Dark Warrior. Manifest in time as living things: when *yi* and *geng* unite, in spring there is the elm, green and white, preserving the colors of metal and wood; when *xin* and *bing* unite, in autumn there is the jujube, white and red, preserving the colors of metal and fire; when *ji* and *jia* unite, at summer’s end and autumn’s beginning there is the melon, green and yellow, preserving the colors of earth and wood; when *ding* and *ren* unite, in summer there is the mulberry, red and black, preserving the colors of water and fire; when *gui* and *wu* unite, in winter there is the tangerine, black and yellow, preserving the colors of water and earth. By analogy, one may infer the countless manifestations of the Five Emperors’ exchanges in time and their generation in things."

Master Lü said: "The Five Phases operate in time as such, but how do they function within a person?"

Master Zhong said: "Only in humans: the head is round and the feet square, bearing the image of Heaven and Earth; yin descends and yang ascends, possessing the mechanism of Heaven and Earth. The kidneys are water, the heart is fire, the liver is wood, the lungs are metal, and the spleen is earth.

In terms of mutual generation among the Five Phases: water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water. The generator is the mother, the generated is the child. In terms of mutual conquest: water conquers fire, fire conquers metal, metal conquers wood, wood conquers earth, earth conquers water. The conqueror is the husband, the conquered is the wife.

Speaking in terms of mother and child: kidney *qi* generates liver *qi*, liver *qi* generates heart *qi*, heart *qi* generates spleen *qi*, spleen *qi* generates lung *qi*, lung *qi* generates kidney *qi*. Speaking in terms of husband and wife: kidney *qi* conquers heart *qi*, heart *qi* conquers lung *qi*, lung *qi* conquers liver *qi*, liver *qi* conquers spleen *qi*, spleen *qi* conquers kidney *qi*.

The kidneys are the husband of the heart, the mother of the liver, the wife of the spleen, and the child of the lungs; the liver is the husband of the spleen, the mother of the heart, the wife of the lungs, and the child of the kidneys; the heart is the husband of the lungs, the mother of the spleen, the wife of the kidneys, and the child of the liver; the lungs are the husband of the liver, the mother of the kidneys, the wife of the heart, and the child of the spleen; the spleen is the husband of the kidneys, the mother of the lungs, the wife of the liver, and the child of the heart.

The heart’s internal manifestation is the pulse, its external manifestation is complexion; its gateway is the tongue. It is subdued by the kidneys and driven to serve the lungs—such is the principle of husband and wife. It flourishes with the liver and wanes with the spleen—such is the principle of mother and child.

The kidneys’ internal manifestation is the bones, their external manifestation is the hair; their gateway is the ears. They are subdued by the spleen and driven to serve the heart—such is the principle of husband and wife. They flourish with the lungs and wane with the liver—such is the principle of mother and child.

The liver’s internal manifestation is the sinews, its external manifestation is the nails; its gateway is the eyes. It is subdued by the lungs and driven to serve the spleen—such is the principle of husband and wife. It flourishes with the kidneys and wanes with the heart—such is the principle of mother and child.

The lungs’ internal manifestation is the skin, their external manifestation is the body hair; their gateway is the nose. They are subdued by the heart and driven to serve the liver—such is the principle of husband and wife. They flourish with the spleen and wane with the kidneys—such is the principle of mother and child.

The spleen’s internal manifestation is the viscera, nourishing the heart, spleen, liver, and lungs; its external manifestation is the flesh; its gateway is the lips and mouth. Its breath regulates the ebb and flow. It is subdued by the liver and driven to serve the kidneys—such is the principle of husband and wife. It flourishes with the heart and wanes with the lungs—such is the principle of mother and child.

This is how the Five Phases within a person mutually generate and conquer, forming husband and wife, mother and child, transmitting *qi* in waxing and waning—all manifest herein."

Master Lü said: "The heart is fire—how can fire descend? The kidneys are water—how can water ascend? The spleen is earth, and earth at the center supports fire to flourish; does it not then conquer water below? The lungs are metal, and metal above, when near fire, is damaged—how can it generate water?"

The generating phases alternate in succession, while the conquering phases remain intimately bound and immutable—thus do the Five Phases inherently damage and restrain one another. What is to be done?

Master Zhong said: The Five Phases return to their origin, where a single *qi* draws them forth. Primordial yang ascends to engender true water; true water transforms to engender true *qi*; true *qi* transforms to engender the yang spirit. At first, the Five Phases are fixed in their positions, forming one husband and one wife.

The kidneys are water, and within water lies metal—metal being the mother of water. At the outset, one must recognize the metal within water. Water naturally resents earth, yet after gathering the medicine, earth must return to water.

The dragon is the emblem of the liver; the tiger, the spirit of the lungs. The yang dragon emerges from the Li palace; the yin tiger arises from the Kan position.

When the Five Phases proceed in sequence, *qi* is transmitted from mother to child—from *zi* to *wu*, this is called "yang born within yang." When the Five Phases are inverted, fluid circulates between husband and wife—from *wu* to *zi*, this is called "yang refined within yin."

Yang cannot be completed without yin, yet in the end, there is no yin that does not perish. Yin cannot be generated without yang, yet in the end, when yin is exhausted, longevity is attained.

Master Lü said: The Five Phases arise from the single *qi* of yin and yang. What is meant by "single *qi*"?

Master Zhong said: The single *qi* is this: when father and mother unite, their essence and blood transform to form the body. The kidneys generate the spleen; the spleen, the liver; the liver, the lungs; the lungs, the heart; the heart, the small intestine; the small intestine, the large intestine; the large intestine, the gallbladder; the gallbladder, the stomach; the stomach, the bladder. Thus does yin, through essence and blood, transform to form the body. Yet yang resides only at the very beginning of generation—a single point of primordial yang lies within the two kidneys.

Now, the kidneys are water, and within water there is fire. When fire ascends, it becomes *qi*; as *qi* rises, it pays court to the heart. The heart is yang; when yang unites with yang, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin. Thus, accumulated *qi* engenders fluid; fluid descends from the heart and, as it flows downward, returns to the kidneys.

The liver is the mother of the heart and the child of the kidneys, conveying the *qi* of the kidneys to the heart. The lungs are the wife of the heart and the mother of the kidneys, conveying the fluid of the heart to the kidneys.

The ascent and descent of *qi* and fluid resemble the yin and yang of heaven and earth. The transmission between liver and lungs is like the alternation of the sun and moon.

Each of the Five Phases has its number, yet in their union and generation, primordial yang and the single *qi* are fundamental. Within *qi*, fluid is born; within fluid, *qi* is born.

The kidneys are the root of *qi*; the heart, the source of fluid. When the numinous root is firm, in the midst of vagueness and obscurity, true water arises spontaneously within *qi*. When the heart’s source is pure, in the midst of profound darkness, true fire arises spontaneously within fluid.

From fire, recognize the true dragon; from water, discern the true tiger. When dragon and tiger unite, they transform into the yellow sprout. When the yellow sprout is conjoined, the great medicine is formed—this is called the "Golden Elixir." Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, it is called "immortality."

Master Lü said: When the Golden Elixir is accomplished and one sheds the body to ascend as an immortal, returning to the Ten Isles—this is well understood. But what is meant by the "yellow sprout"?

Master Zhong said: It is the true dragon and the true tiger.

Master Lü said: What are the "dragon and tiger"?

Master Zhong said: The dragon is not the liver—it is the yang dragon, which emerges from the true water of the Li palace. The tiger is not the lungs—it is the yin tiger, which arises from the true fire of the Kan position.

**On Water and Fire, Chapter Seven**

Master Lü said: For one who attains long life, the Golden Elixir is refined.

To refine the Golden Elixir, first gather the yellow sprout.
To obtain the yellow sprout, one must secure the dragon and tiger.
The true dragon emerges from the Li palace, the true tiger arises from the Kan position.
Within Li and Kan lie water and fire—what are water and fire?

Master Zhong said: In the body, when speaking of "water," it encompasses the Four Seas and Five Lakes, the Nine Rivers and Three Isles, Hua Pond and Yao Pond, Phoenix Pool and Heavenly Pool, Jade Pool and Xuan Pool, Yuan Abyss and Lang Garden, divine water and golden waves, nectar and jade springs, yang suet and white snow—such names cannot be fully enumerated.
When speaking of "fire" in the body, there are sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and civilian fire.
The three fires take primordial yang as their root, generating true qi. When true qi gathers, peace is attained; when true qi weakens, illness arises. If true qi is dissipated and primordial yang lost, primordial yang exhausted, pure yin prevails, and the primordial spirit departs the body—this is called "death."

Master Lü said: Within the human body, a single point of primordial yang ignites the three fires. The three fires arise amid the multitude of waters and yin, easily dissipated yet difficult to kindle. If yang is weak and yin abundant, fire scant and water plentiful, one swiftly declines and cannot attain long life—what is to be done?

Master Zhong said: The heart is the sea of blood, the kidneys the sea of qi, the brain the sea of marrow, and the spleen and stomach the sea of water and grain—thus are the "Four Seas." The five viscera each possess fluids governing their positions—east, west, south, north, and center—thus are the "Five Lakes." The small intestine, two zhang and four chi in length, curves nine times up and down—this is the "Nine Rivers." Below the small intestine lies the "Yuan Abyss"; such is its explanation. The head is the "Upper Isle," the heart the "Middle Isle," the kidneys the "Lower Isle"—within the Three Isles lies the "Lang Garden." "Hua Pond" resides below the Yellow Court, "Yao Pond" emerges before the Cinnabar Gate, "Xuan Pond" connects above to the "Jade Capital," "Heavenly Pool" directly pierces the inner courtyard, "Phoenix Pool" lies between the heart and lungs, and "Jade Pool" is within the lips and teeth. Divine water arises within qi, golden waves descend from heaven, and where the red dragon dwells, "nectar" and "jade springs" naturally appear. Only after the fetal transformation does one witness "white snow" and "yang suet." Watering at the proper time nourishes the blazing fire—first called "jade liquid," then "golden liquid," both of which can return the elixir. With measured withdrawal and addition, aligning with the bath, first the "middle field," then the "lower field," both can refine the form. Jade buds and golden blossoms transform into a body of yellow and white; ghee and sweet dew refine into wondrous fragrances—such are the efficacies of "water." As for the civilian fire ascending to assist kidney qi in generating true water, and kidney fire ascending to merge with heart fluid in generating true qi—on a small scale, they subdue demons and dispel illness; on a grand scale, they refine the body and forge the elixir. Employing the celestial cycle, fire arises to incinerate the body; restraining the yang pass, it returns to refine the medicine. Distinguishing the terrain of the Nine Isles to nurture the yang spirit, burning away the burdens of the Three Corpses to eliminate yin ghosts—ascending, it strikes through the Three Passes; descending, it dissolves the Seven Po. Refining form into qi, one becomes light and soars like flight; refining qi into spirit, one sheds the fetal husk like a molting cicada. Such are the efficacies of "fire."

Master Lü said: At first, I heard your instruction and feared that scant fire and abundant water would lead to swift decline. Now, having listened to your profound discourse, I see the wondrous efficacies of water and fire. Ultimately, how does one transform this so that the few can overcome the many, and the weak can become strong?

Master Zhong said: When the two eights of yin dissipate and the nine threes of yang grow, the radiant Golden Elixir can be accomplished in days. With seven returns and nine reversions, the fetal immortal naturally transforms. True qi resides in the heart, and the heart is the source of fluid; primordial yang dwells in the kidneys, and the kidneys are the sea of qi. The bladder is civilian fire—without civilian fire, it cannot be employed, yet the bladder is also the repository of fluids. If one fails to grasp the celestial mechanism and fathom the mysterious principle, even those who uphold the Dao will struggle to achieve transformation and cannot escape illness and death.

Master Lü said: What is meant by transformation, where yang grows and yin dissipates, the Golden Elixir is accomplished, and the fetal immortal naturally transforms?

Master Zhong said: The heart and kidneys in the human body are separated by eight cun and four fen—this mirrors the fixed positions of heaven and earth. The generation of qi and fluid from the Supreme Ultimate mirrors the union of yin and yang. The twelve hours of a day mirror the twelve months of a year. The heart generates fluid, yet not of itself—it is because lung fluid descends that heart fluid flows. The fluids of husband and wife descend from above to return to the lower field—this is called "the wife returning to the husband’s palace." The kidneys generate qi, yet not of themselves—it is because bladder qi ascends that kidney qi flows. The qi of mother and child ascends from below to pay homage to the middle origin—this is called "the husband returning to the wife’s chamber." Liver qi guides kidney qi upward to reach the heart. The heart is fire; when the two qi merge, they steam the lungs. Lung fluid descends from the heart, originating from the heart’s generation of fluid. As this fluid arises from the heart without dissipation, it is called "true water." Lung fluid transmits heart fluid downward to the kidneys. The kidneys are water; when the two waters merge, they moisten the bladder. Bladder qi ascends from the kidneys, originating from the kidneys’ generation of qi. As this qi arises from the kidneys without dissipation, it is called "true fire."

True fire emerges from within water—dim and indistinct, yet within it lies a thing: invisible when sought, unattainable when grasped. True water arises from within fire—profound and obscure, yet within it lies an essence: glimpsed but not detained, detained but not held.

Master Lü says: The kidneys are water; from water, qi is born—this is called "true fire." But what is the *thing* within fire?
The heart is fire; from fire, fluid is born—this is called "true water." But what is the *essence* within water?
The thing within fire and the essence within water—having no form to seek, even if sought, they are hard to obtain; and even if obtained, what use are they?

Master Zhong says: The ancient perfected ones who attained the Dao did not depart from the union of these two things, which transform into the yellow sprout. When the count is fulfilled and the embryo complete, the great medicine is formed—these are the true dragon and true tiger.

**Chapter Eight: On the Dragon and Tiger**
Master Lü says: The dragon is the image of the liver; the tiger is the spirit of the lungs.
Yet this fluid born from heart-fire is true water, and within this water—profound and obscure—lies the hidden true dragon. Why does the dragon not reside in the liver but emerge from the *Li* palace?
And this qi born from kidney-water is true fire, and within this fire—dim and indistinct—lies the concealed true tiger. Why does the tiger not reside in the lungs but arise from the *Kan* position?

Master Zhong says: The dragon is a yang thing—ascending and soaring in the heavens, roaring to summon clouds, receiving moisture to nourish the myriad beings. In imagery, it is the Azure Dragon; in direction, *jia-yi*; in substance, wood; in season, spring; in the Dao, benevolence; in the hexagrams, *Zhen*; and among the five viscera of the human body, the liver.
The tiger is a yin thing—running upon the earth, howling to summon wind, gaining mountains to overawe the hundred creatures. In imagery, it is the White Tiger; in direction, *geng-xin*; in substance, metal; in season, autumn; in the Dao, righteousness; in the hexagrams, *Dui*; and among the five viscera of the human body, the lungs.

Now, the liver is yang yet resides in a yin position. Thus, kidney qi transmits to liver qi, moving as mother and child—water generating wood. When kidney qi is sufficient, liver qi is born; once liver qi is born, it severs the kidney’s residual yin, and pure yang qi ascends.
The lungs are yin yet reside in a yang position. Thus, heart fluid transmits to lung fluid, moving as husband and wife—fire restraining metal. When heart fluid arrives, lung fluid is born; once lung fluid is born, it severs the heart’s residual yang, and pure yin fluid descends.

The liver pertains to yang; in severing the kidney’s residual yin, one knows that when qi passes through the liver, it becomes pure yang. Within pure yang qi lies the hidden true unity of water—dim and formless—called the "yang dragon."
The lungs pertain to yin; in severing the heart’s residual yang, one knows that when fluid reaches the lungs, it becomes pure yin. Within pure yin fluid lies the carried true yang qi—profound and unseen—called the "yin tiger."

Qi ascends and fluid descends, inherently unable to merge. Yet within qi lies the true unity of water, which sees fluid and unites with it; within fluid lies the true yang qi, which sees qi and gathers with it.
If, during transmission, one applies the method to restrain it—preventing kidney qi from scattering and gathering the true unity of water within qi, and preventing heart fluid from dissipating and harvesting the true yang qi within fluid—then mother and child meet, gazing fondly upon each other. Daily, a grain of millet grows; after a hundred days, the medicine’s power is complete without flaw. After two hundred days, the sacred embryo hardens; after three hundred days, the immortal fetus is perfected—its form like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. This is called the "elixir medicine," eternally anchoring the lower field, preserving form and abiding in the world, enduring eons of long life—this is the earthbound immortal.

Master Lü says: Kidney water generates qi, and within qi lies the true unity of water—called the yin tiger, which sees fluid and unites with it.
Heart fire generates fluid, and within fluid lies the true yang qi—called the yang dragon, which sees qi and unites with it.
Things gather by kind, beings assemble by group—this is the natural principle.

When qi is born, fluid also descends; does not the true unity of water within qi follow the fluid downward to transmit through the five viscera?
When fluid is born, qi also ascends; does not the true yang qi within fluid follow the qi upward to emerge from the *Chonglou*?
True water follows fluid downward—the tiger cannot unite with the dragon.
True yang follows qi upward—the dragon cannot unite with the tiger.
If dragon and tiger do not unite, how can the yellow sprout arise?
Without the yellow sprout, how can the great medicine be formed?

Master Zhong says: When kidney qi is born, it is like the sun emerging from the sea—mist and dew cannot obscure its light.
Fluid descends like a parted curtain—how can it withstand the qi?
When qi is robust, the true unity of water naturally flourishes.
When heart fluid is born, it is like the severe sky slaying beings—breath cannot resist its cold.
Qi ascends like a jade screen—how can it withstand the fluid?
When fluid is abundant, the true yang qi may be strong or weak—its certainty is uncertain.

Master Lü says: Qi and fluid are born each in their time. When it is the time for qi to be born, if qi is abundant, the true unity of water naturally flourishes. When it is the time for fluid to be born, if fluid is abundant, the true yang qi also flourishes.
Yet why is their flourishing or decline not assured?

Master Zhong says: Kidney qi is easily dissipated—what is hard to obtain is the true tiger.
Heart fluid is hard to accumulate—what is easily lost is the true dragon.
The ten thousand volumes of elixir classics discuss nothing beyond yin and yang.
Within these two matters of yin and yang, the essence is nothing but dragon and tiger.
Among those who uphold the Dao, perhaps one or two in ten thousand understand.
Some are widely learned and well-versed, knowing the principles of dragon and tiger, yet do not recognize the time of their union or the method of their harvesting.

Thus, the accomplished scholars of past and present, though they cultivate with white-haired devotion, attain only minor accomplishment, prolonging life for generations but never hearing of transcendence—this is because they cannot unite dragon and tiger in copulation or harvest the yellow sprout to refine the elixir.

**On the Elixir, Ninth Discourse**

Master Lü says: The principles of dragon and tiger are already known—may we now hear of the "Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir"?

Master Zhong says: That which is called "medicine" can cure illness. All illnesses are of three kinds:
When one lies in drafts or dampness, endures heat or cold, overworks or overindulges, eats or fasts untimely, and suffers irregular discomfort, this is called *affliction*—an illness of the seasons.
When one refuses cultivation, indulges the passions, scatters original yang, and depletes true qi, growing aged and withered, this is called *aging*—an illness of the years.
When qi is exhausted and the body hollow, the hun-soul fades and the shen-spirit scatters, a long sigh escapes, the four elements lose their master, and the body lies in the wilds—this is called *death*, an illness of the body.

Now, seasonal illness arises as spring, summer, autumn, and winter cycle through cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. When yang is excessive and yin insufficient, it must be treated with coolness; when yin is excessive and yang insufficient, it must be treated with warmth. The aged tend to cold, the young to heat; the stout have excess phlegm, the emaciated excess accumulations. Men’s illnesses arise from qi, women’s sufferings stem from blood. One supplements the deficient and reduces the excessive, preserves the weak and diminishes the surplus—mild cases with acupuncture and moxibustion, severe cases with medicinal decoctions. Though irregular discomforts and seasonal afflictions may arise, entrusting them to a skilled physician who prescribes remedies according to the ailment will ensure recovery.

But how is the illness of aging to be cured?
And how is the illness of death to be treated?

The ancient masters of medicine who could purge the intestines and replenish the flesh—who could restore youthful complexion to wrinkled faces and white hair—remain incomprehensible to all! The ancient masters of medicine who could replace the crown of the head and extend the limbs—who could preserve one’s shadow and abide in the world to attain longevity—remain incomprehensible to all!

Master Lü said: "Irregular discomforts and seasonal afflictions may arise, but with a skilled physician and renowned remedies, they can certainly be cured. Yet how is the illness of decrepit old age to be treated? And how is the suffering of qi’s exhaustion and life’s end to be remedied? Are there no medicines for these?"

Master Zhong said: "All illnesses fall into three categories. Seasonal afflictions heal themselves with herbal remedies. For bodily illnesses and the ailments of age, there are two types of medicines: the first is the *Inner Elixir* (内丹), and the second is the *Outer Elixir* (外丹)."

Master Lü asked: "What is the *Outer Elixir*?"

Master Zhong replied: "In ancient times, the Most High Primordial Lord transmitted the Dao to the world, expounding the principles of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the proper cycles of the sun and moon. Since then, elixir scriptures have filled the world, and people have come to hear of the Great Dao. The Venerable Guangcheng taught the Yellow Emperor, who, in the intervals of governing, practiced the method diligently, yet after a long time saw no results. Guangcheng then revealed that between the heart and kidneys lies true *qi* and true water, and between *qi* and water reside true yin and true yang. When combined, they form the great medicine, comparable to the hidden treasures within metals and stones.

Thus, in the Kongtong Mountains, he took the inner method as his guide and refined the great elixir. Among the eight minerals, only cinnabar was used, from which mercury was extracted; among the five metals, only black lead was used, from which silver was drawn. Mercury corresponds to the yang dragon, silver to the yin tiger. The heart’s fire is like cinnabar’s redness, the kidneys’ water like lead’s blackness. The yearly fire follows the seasons, never deviating from the strategies of heaven and earth; the monthly fire adjusts its additions and subtractions, naturally distinguishing the proper balance of civil and martial. A three-tiered furnace was erected, each tier nine inches high, square on the outside and round within, gathering the *qi* of the eight directions and aligning with the seasons of the four times. The golden crucible, containing lead and mercury, is no different from the fluids of the lungs; sulfur serves as the medicine, harmonizing with the numinous cinnabar, comparable to the Yellow Dame.

After three years, the lesser accomplishment is achieved, and its ingestion can eradicate all illnesses. After six years, the middle accomplishment is attained, and its ingestion can naturally prolong life."

After nine years, the great accomplishment is achieved, and its ingestion allows one to ascend and move freely, stretching one's arms to traverse thousands or tens of thousands of miles. Though one may not return to Penglai, one will not perish even in the great kalpas of the mortal world.

Master Lü said: "Since ancient times, many have practiced alchemy, yet few have seen success. Why is this?"

Master Zhong replied: "There are three reasons why alchemy fails. First, those who cannot distinguish the authenticity of medicinal materials, who do not understand the subtleties of fire timing and adjustment, may reduce the most precious substances to smoke and ash in an instant, wasting time and effort without achievement. Second, though the medicinal materials may be fine, if one does not know the fire timing—or knows the fire timing but lacks the materials—the two will not align, and no accomplishment will be achieved. Third, though the materials may be excellent and the fire timing appropriate, with no miscalculations in years, months, or days, and with precise additions and subtractions at the proper times, the *qi* may be sufficient and the elixir formed, yet if one’s external conduct is lacking, the elixir may transform into a transcendent crane and soar into the void, leaving no means to ingest it—thus failing in the end.

Moreover, medicinal materials are the essence and fruit of heaven and earth’s purest *qi*, while fire timing is the art of cultivation by which immortals attain the Dao. In the time of the Three Sovereigns, the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir, and only after nine transformations did it succeed. After the Five Emperors, the Primordial One refined the elixir, and only after three years did it succeed. By the Warring States period, baleful *qi* congealed in the sky, corpses filled the fields, and things could no longer receive the purest *qi* of heaven and earth—thus the world lacked medicinal materials. Even those who had obtained the proper methods fled calamity and died in mountain valleys. Though some alchemical formulas and immortal arts may have been recorded on bamboo and silk, they decayed over time, and the world no longer possessed them. Had medicinal materials existed in the mortal world, the First Emperor of Qin would not have sought them on the islands of the sea. Had elixir formulas existed in the mortal world, Wei Boyang would not have delved into the *Book of Changes*.

Yet some, through extensive learning and strong memory, have misled later generations, causing countless families to be ruined without a single success—seeking externally has thus been a grave error.

Master Lü said: "The principles of external alchemy originate from Guangchengzi, who took internal practices as his model. Even if one achieves success, it requires nine years to complete. Moreover, medicinal materials are difficult to obtain, and elixir formulas are hard to come by. In the end, one may only ascend but not transcend the mundane to enter sagehood, nor return to the Ten Isles."

Dare I ask about the internal elixir—may I hear of it?

Master Zhong said: "External elixirs are not without use. For those who follow the Dao but awaken late in life, their foundational roots may not be deeply established. The kidneys are the root of *qi*; if the root is not deep, the leaves will not flourish. The heart is the source of fluids; if the source is not clear, the flow will not be long. Thus, one must rely on the five metals and eight minerals, accumulating days and months to refine the three grades, each with three ranks—this is called the 'Nine-Rank Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir.' It assists in connecting the true *qi*, refining the form to abide in the world, and ascending lightly as if flying.

Yet if one cultivates the internal practice, recognizing the time of union and knowing the method of gathering, the fetal immortal will be accomplished, and transcendence may be achieved in days. Those who fail to comprehend this cling to external elixirs, adding fire and extending time, hoping through ingestion to ascend to the celestial realms—truly laughable!

Since they do not investigate the source of external elixirs, I shall now expound in detail the principles of the internal elixir. The medicinal materials of the internal elixir arise from the heart and kidneys—something all people possess. The medicinal materials of the internal elixir originally reside in heaven and earth, and heaven and earth manifest them daily. The fire timing follows the cycles of the sun and moon, and the refinement emulates the harmony of husband and wife in union. When the sacred embryo is formed, true *qi* is born; within *qi* there is *qi*, like a dragon nurturing its pearl. When the great medicine is completed, the yang spirit emerges; beyond the body there is a body, like a cicada shedding its husk. This internal elixir fundamentally arises from the union of dragon and tiger, transforming into the yellow sprout, and when the yellow sprout is achieved, lead and mercury are distinguished.

**On Lead and Mercury, Tenth Chapter**

Master Lü said: "The internal elixir does not transcend dragon and tiger. The tiger is born in the Kan palace—it is the water within *qi*. The dragon emerges from the Li palace—it is the *qi* within water. External elixirs take mercury from cinnabar, likening it to the yang dragon, and silver from lead, likening it to the yin tiger. Yet lead and mercury are external elixirs—how then do dragon and tiger unite to transform into the yellow sprout? And how, once the yellow sprout is achieved, are lead and mercury distinguished? What, then, are lead and mercury in the context of the internal elixir?"

Master Zhong said: "That which embraces the quality of Heavenly One and stands as the chief of the five metals is black lead. Lead gives birth to silver, and lead is the mother of silver. That which receives the *qi* of the great yang and stands as the chief of all minerals is cinnabar. Cinnabar gives birth to mercury, and mercury is the child of cinnabar. What is difficult to extract is silver from lead; what easily scatters is mercury from cinnabar. When silver and mercury combine, refinement naturally produces the supreme treasure. Such is the principle of lead and mercury as seen externally.

Yet regarding internal practice, ancient and modern discussions vary. Taking the most profound explanations, it begins at the moment of parents’ union, when essence and blood merge, enclosing true *qi*, entrusting the substance to the mother’s womb—a palace of pure yin—hiding the spirit within the unseparated yin and yang. After three hundred days, the fetus is complete; after five thousand days, the *qi* is sufficient.

In terms of the five phases, the human body is fundamentally essence and blood—water comes first. In terms of the five viscera, essence and blood form the physical image—the kidneys come first. Within kidney water, concealed from the moment of conception, lies the true *qi* of the parents. This true *qi* is hidden within the internal kidneys of the person—this is what is called lead. The kidneys govern *qi*, and within *qi* lies the true water of the One—this is called the true tiger, and this is what is meant by silver within lead.

Kidney *qi* transmits to liver *qi*, and liver *qi* transmits to heart *qi*. The heart *qi* reaches the Supreme Ultimate and generates fluid; within this fluid is the *qi* of true yang—this is what is called cinnabar, the fluid of the heart. What is called mercury is the *qi* of true yang within the heart’s fluid. Accumulated *qi* and fluid form the fetal sac, conveyed within the Yellow Court. With precise fire timing, the fetal immortal naturally transforms."

Thus, lead and silver merge with mercury, refined into a treasure.

Master Lü states: Among the five metals, silver is extracted from lead; within the eight minerals, mercury emerges from cinnabar. Placed in the crucible and paired with medicinal elixirs, mercury naturally becomes cinnabar, and silver naturally becomes treasure. Yet how is silver drawn from the lead within? How is mercury drawn from the cinnabar within a person? How does mercury become cinnabar, and how does silver become treasure?

Master Zhong says: Lead is originally the true *qi* of the parents, merged as one, pure and indivisible. After form is established, it is concealed within the kidneys. The two kidneys face each other, their *qi* ascending together—this is called the primordial yang *qi*. Within *qi* lies water—this is called the true water of the One. Water ascends with *qi*; when *qi* abides, water abides; when *qi* scatters, water scatters. Water and *qi* are like mother and child, never parting. The discerning see only *qi*, not water. If this true water of the One unites with the heart’s true yang *qi*, it is called the dragon and tiger mating to transform into the yellow sprout, which becomes the great medicine. The material of the great medicine is fundamentally the true water of the One as its embryo, internally containing true yang *qi*—just as the parents’ true *qi* once formed the fetal sac from essence and blood. After three hundred days of cultivation, the embryo is complete, *qi* is full, form is perfected, and spirit arrives. Separating from the mother, form and spirit unite, and union gives birth to form.

For those who uphold the Dao, kidney *qi* merges with heart *qi*. Within *qi* is concealed the true water of the One, bearing true yang *qi*. When *qi* unites with true water, it forms an embryo like a millet grain, nurtured without depletion. First, yin retains yang; then yang is used to refine yin. *Qi* transforms into essence, essence into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, cinnabar into the golden elixir. Once the golden elixir is achieved, true *qi* arises spontaneously. Refining *qi* into spirit, one attains liberation, riding the fire dragon out of the twilight realm and mounting the dark crane to enter Penglai.

Master Lü says: When form unites with form, union gives birth to form; when *qi* unites with *qi*, union gives birth to *qi*. The count does not exceed three hundred days. After the division of form, how do the differences between male and female arise? What is the color and luster of one’s own cinnabar?

Master Zhong says: When the forms of father and mother unite, the father’s essence enters first, and the mother’s blood follows. If blood envelops essence, a girl is born—a girl is inwardly yang and outwardly yin, resembling the mother, for blood lies externally. If the mother’s blood enters first and the father’s essence follows, essence envelops blood, and a boy is born—a boy is inwardly yin and outwardly yang, resembling the father, for essence lies externally. What is called "blood" originates in the heart and lacks true yang *qi*. What is called "essence" originates in the kidneys and contains true yang *qi*—this is the root of mercury, the true water of the One. Harmonized, it enters the Yellow Court. Lead broth is used to boil it, and mercury water to refine it. Without mercury, lead cannot activate the true water of the One; without lead, mercury cannot transform into pure yang *qi*.

Master Lü says: Lead resides in the kidneys, generating primordial yang *qi*. Within *qi* lies the true water of the One, invisible to the eye. When lead obtains mercury, and mercury possesses true yang *qi*, this true yang *qi* refines the lead. Lead’s *qi* flourishes, activating the true water of the One, enabling it to ascend. Yet mercury is fundamentally true yang *qi*, the true water of the One forming the embryo, conveyed to the Yellow Court. This is the dragon and tiger mating, yin and yang in balance. It is also refined with lead broth. If yin is excessive, it dissipates true yang—how can the great medicine form, and *qi* generate *qi*?

Master Zhong says: When kidney *qi* enters heart *qi*, *qi* at its peak generates fluid. Within fluid lies true yang *qi*, uniting with the true water of the One—this is called "the dragon and tiger mating." Daily, it grows to the size of a millet grain, called "the great medicine of the golden elixir," conveyed to the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court lies below the spleen and stomach, above the bladder, north of the heart and south of the kidneys, west of the liver and east of the lungs. Above is clear, below is turbid; externally, it corresponds to the four directions. Its capacity is two *sheng*, its pathways connect to the eight waters. The medicine obtained resides within it day and night. If medicine is gathered but fire is not applied, the medicine will dissipate and cannot abide. If fire is applied but medicine is not gathered, yang within yin cannot abide, merely activating kidney *qi* to strengthen and warm the lower origin. If medicine is gathered at the proper time and fire is applied in due measure, one must first borrow *qi* from lead to apply fire, solidifying the great medicine and permanently anchoring it in the lower field—this is called "the method of gathering and supplementing." Refining mercury to supplement the cinnabar field prolongs life and extends years, making one an earthly immortal. If medicine is gathered and primordial lead is drawn from it, golden essence flies behind the elbow. After drawing lead, mercury must be added; without adding mercury, one merely returns essence to replenish the brain—how can true *qi* arise? If true *qi* does not arise, how can the yang spirit be achieved? After adding mercury, lead must be drawn; without drawing lead, one merely refines mercury to supplement the cinnabar field—how can cinnabar transform? If cinnabar does not transform, how can the golden elixir be achieved?

**On Drawing and Adding, Chapter Eleven**
Master Lü says: Gathering medicine relies on the water within *qi*; applying fire borrows the *qi* within lead. Ultimately, lead is drawn to complete the great medicine, and mercury is added to supplement the cinnabar field—what is the principle of "drawing and adding"?

Master Zhong says: In ancient times, the supreme sages transmitted the Dao to the world. The people of the distant past were simple and unadorned, profoundly ignorant—unable to hear of the great Dao.

The principles of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent lie in the interplay of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat. With seasons fixed in their cycles, the year’s divisions are set, revolving endlessly without straying from the Dao—thus heaven and earth endure forever. Likewise, the ebb and flow of the sun and moon’s essence follow the rhythm of dawn, fullness, waning, and newness, their rising and setting unerring. A month’s course complete, their motion ceaseless, never deviating from the Dao—thus the sun and moon endure forever.

Yet as cold gives way to heat and heat to cold, people fail to grasp the principle of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent. As the moon waxes full and wanes, then waxes again, they do not comprehend the sun and moon’s cyclical exchange. Indulging endless desires, they fritter away their finite time. Wealth and splendor—what are they but adornments for life’s fleeting dream? Love and sorrow—what do they amount to but debts carried into the next life? The song not yet faded, suffering arrives; fame and fortune still fresh, youth has already departed. Greed for wealth and goods deludes them into believing they will last ten thousand kalpas; love for children and grandchildren makes them hope for reunion in the next life. Ceaseless craving, vain dreams of immortality—yet they dissipate their primal yang, lose their true *qi*, and only when illness clings to the body do they finally relent; only when the great limit arrives do they at last let go.

The true immortals and supreme sages, pitying their endless rebirth and shared descent into ruin, longed for people to awaken to the great Dao. They began by expounding the principle of heaven and earth’s yin and yang ascent and descent, then drew parallels to the sun and moon’s ebb and flow of essence. Yet still, people failed to grasp the celestial mechanism or fathom its mysteries. Thus, they compared inner medicine to outer medicine, spoke of the impassive to explain the sentient: the impassive is metal and stone—outer medicine; the sentient is *qi* and fluid—inner medicine. The vastness of heaven and earth, the brightness of the sun and moon, the externality of metal and stone, the internality of *qi* and fluid—once gathered, they must be added; once added, they must be drawn. The principle of drawing and adding is the root of creation itself.

After the winter solstice, yang ascends from the earth, and the earth draws out its yin. Greater yin is drawn to become reverting yin; lesser yang is added to become yang brightness. Reverting yin is drawn to become lesser yin; yang brightness is added to become greater yang. Without this, how could cold shift to warmth, warmth to heat? After the summer solstice, yin descends from heaven, and heaven draws out its yang. Greater yang is drawn to become yang brightness; lesser yin is added to become reverting yin. Yang brightness is drawn to become lesser yang; reverting yin is added to become greater yin. Without this, how could heat shift to coolness, coolness to cold? Thus, the ascent and descent of heaven and earth’s yin and yang transform the six *qi*—this is the proof of drawing and adding.

As the moon receives the sun’s spirit, the sun alters the moon’s soul: in the first fifteen days, the moon draws out its soul while the sun adds its spirit, until its essence is exhausted and its light illumines the earth. Without this, how could the new moon become the first quarter, the first quarter become the full moon? The moon gathers yin soul, the sun gathers yang essence: in the next fifteen days, the sun draws out its spirit while the moon adds its soul, until its light fades and its yin soul is complete. Without this, how could the full moon become the last quarter, the last quarter become the dark moon? Thus, the sun and moon’s essence cycles through nine and six—this is the proof of drawing and adding.

From ancient times, true immortals and supreme sages knew what people cherish most: freedom from illness and long life. They refined metal and stone into the great elixir. They also knew what people desire most: gold and silver. They transmuted lead and mercury into supreme treasures. Their intent was for people to grasp the principle. Even impassive metal and stone, with fire times unerring and drawing and adding precise, can extend years and prolong life. How much more so with one’s own sentient body, its true yang *qi* and original unity’s water—knowing the time of union, understanding the method of gathering, accumulating day by day, month by month, *qi* within *qi*, refining *qi* into spirit, to achieve transcendence—would this not be an attainable feat across all ages?

Yet since the teaching of outer medicine arose, though ancient and modern sages have expounded it for the world to hear, people still fail to awaken. Deceiving themselves and others, they extract mercury from cinnabar, use mercury to transmute lead, dry lead to fix mercury, employ mercury to transform copper—heedless of their lives, vainly seeking wealth, mutually praising one another under the guise of loving the Dao, when in truth they love profit and crave alchemical gold and silver. They do not realize that the discourse on lead and mercury is a metaphor for inner work.

**On the River Chariot, Chapter Twelve**
Master Lü says: What is meant by the "River Chariot"?

Master Zhong says: In ancient times, a man of aspiration and wisdom observed floating clouds veiling the sun and conceived the idea of harnessing yin to craft a canopy. He saw fallen leaves drifting upon the waves and devised a vessel to bear objects—thus the boat was born. Watching tumbleweeds swept by the wind, ceaselessly turning, he withdrew to fashion the chariot. Now, the chariot as an object embodies the image of Heaven and Earth in its canopy and axle-tree, its wheels and hubs likened to the sun and moon. The perfected Daoist draws analogy from the chariot: though it travels upon land and turns across the earth, today we speak of the "River Chariot"—and therein lies its meaning.

Within the human body, yang is scant while yin abounds; the places of water are manifold. The chariot thus takes its intent from conveying and transporting, for the river governs the image of abundant yin. Therefore, this River Chariot does not run upon the earth but upon the water—now descending, now ascending, now advancing, now retreating. It is harnessed within the Eight Jewels and gallops through the Four Seas. Ascending to Heaven, it enters Kunlun; when the crossing is achieved, it rushes down to the Phoenix Tower. It carries primordial yang straight into the Palace of Li; it bears true qi in a winding path to the Mansion of Longevity. Traversing the Nine Provinces without pause, patrolling the Three Fields without rest—when dragon and tiger unite, it commands the Yellow Maid to drive into the Yellow Court. When lead and mercury first part, it entrusts the Metal Lad to convey them into the Golden Gate. A thousand streams of Jade Spring are transported in but half a day’s work; a single flask of Golden Liquor, once conveyed, is accomplished in an instant. Without this chariot’s conveyance, the Five Phases could scarcely take form; without this chariot’s conveyance, the single qi could never intermingle.

Working in accord with the seasons and in harmony with time, one must borrow this chariot to convey, then and only then may results be seen. Nurturing yang and refining yin to establish the work, one must borrow this chariot to convey, only then may error be avoided. Before Heaven and Earth are purified, if yin and yang still alternate, it is the work of this chariot. Before the cosmos is complete, if blood and qi still circulate, it is the work of this chariot. From without to within, it conveys the pure qi of Heaven and Earth to draw forth the primordial yang of one’s own palace. From mortal to sage, it conveys the true qi of yin and yang to replenish and refine the primordial spirit of one’s own body. Its merits cannot be fully recounted.

Master Lü says: The River Chariot possesses such wondrous functions—may I ask, what is the principle of the River Chariot? In the human body, what substance constitutes it? Once obtained, how is it employed?

Master Zhong says: The River Chariot arises within the true water of the North. The kidneys store true qi, and the true qi generates the upright qi—this is called the River Chariot. Its workings are rarely heard of in past or present; true immortals guard it as a secret and do not speak of it. It is like Qian seeking Kun to engender Kan: Kan is fundamentally water, water is the essence of yin, and yang, having sought yin, carries yin back to its place, passing through Gen, Zhen, and Xun. By yang seeking yin and thereby drawing yin, it conveys yin into Li, where it receives yang and is born. Thus, this River Chariot conveys yin into the Palace of Yang.

Then, like Kun seeking Qian to engender Li: Li is fundamentally fire, fire is the essence of yang, and yin, having sought yang, embraces yang and returns to its place, passing through Kun, Dui, and Qian. By yin seeking yang and thereby drawing yang, it conveys yang into Kan, where it receives yin and is born. Thus, this River Chariot conveys yang into the Palace of Yin.

Then, gathering the medicine upon the Nine Palaces, one obtains it and descends into the Yellow Court. Drawing lead from beneath the Winding River, one conveys it upward to ascend into the Inner Court. Jade Liquor and Golden Liquor are the Reverted Elixir—through conveyance, one may refine the form, causing water to ascend. Sovereign Fire and People’s Fire refine the form—through conveyance, one may ignite the elixir, causing fire to descend. The Five Qi Ascending to the Origin are conveyed each in their time; the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown are conveyed each on their day. When spirits gather and demons multiply, conveying true fire to incinerate the body extinguishes the Three Corpses, and they flee. When the medicine is perfected and the sea runs dry, transporting the Elixir of Rosy Clouds to bathe, one enters the water without ripple. Such are the workings of the River Chariot.

Master Lü says: The River Chariot, being the upright qi of the North, turns endlessly, bearing and loading yin and yang, each achieving its fulfillment—yet the work it performs is not uniform. I beg you, Venerable Master, to expound in detail.

Master Zhong says: The Five Phases cycle in revolution, endlessly returning—silently aligning with the art of inversion, when dragon and tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout, this is the "Lesser River Chariot." The Flying Golden Essence behind the elbow, returning the essence to the Mud Pill Palace, drawing lead to augment mercury and form the Great Medicine—this is the "Greater River Chariot." Dragon and tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout; lead and mercury unite to form the Great Medicine. True qi is born, and the Five Qi ascend to the Central Origin; the yang spirit is perfected, and the Three Spirits transcend into the Inner Court. The Purple Gold Elixir is completed, ever like a pair of black cranes in flight; the White Jade Mercury is settled, steadfast as a fire dragon leaping forth. A myriad golden rays envelop the mortal frame with radiance; a single jade tree displays fresh blossoms in resplendence. Now emerging, now entering—emerging and entering at will; now departing, now arriving—departing and arriving without hindrance. Conveying spirit into the body, one merges with the flow of the age.

Transcending the mundane to become an immortal transcendent—this is called the "Purple River Chariot." These three chariots, named for the upper, middle, and lower stages of achievement, refer to the verification of their effects, not to be confused with the Three Vehicles of Buddhist teaching—the Goat Cart, Deer Cart, and Great Ox Cart.

From the Daoist perspective, beyond the River Chariot, there are three further chariots: when fire is gathered and the mind directs the will to attack illness, it is called the "Messenger Chariot"; when the hexagram *Jìjì* (既济) descends from above, yin and yang unite in proper harmony, water and fire coexist, and within stillness the sound of thunder is heard, it is called the "Thunder Chariot"; if the mind is enslaved by external phenomena, nature is dragged by emotion, and true yang qi scatters outward in response to sensory objects without cease, leading over time to weakened qi and depleted vitality, resulting in aging, or if the Eight Evils and Five Epidemics invade, returning true qi becomes difficult, and original yang cannot resist—aging and illness culminate in death—this is called the "Broken Chariot."

Master Lü said: When the Five Phases are inverted and dragon and tiger unite, the Lesser River Chariot has already begun its course. When the Three Fields reverse and return, and the golden essence flies behind the elbow, the Greater River Chariot is about to begin. When will the Purple River Chariot be attained?

Master Zhong said: The cultivator of the Dao, having heard the Great Way and encountered an enlightened teacher, comprehends the principles of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the cycles of the sun and moon’s movement. First, yin and yang are matched; next, water and fire are gathered and dispersed; then medicine is gathered and fire is applied, mercury is added and lead is withdrawn—thus the Lesser River Chariot begins its course. When the golden essence behind the elbow enters the crown, the Great Medicine of the Yellow Court gradually forms, striking through the Three Passes to ascend directly into the Inner Court, gathering what follows and refining what precedes, supplementing above and tempering below—then the Greater River Chariot begins its course. Only after the Golden Liquid and Jade Liquid are refined into the Returned Elixir, and the body is refined, and qi is refined, and spirit is refined, and spirit merges with the Dao—only then is the Dao accomplished. Emerging from the mortal to enter immortality—this is called the Purple River Chariot.

**On the Returned Elixir, Chapter Thirteen**
Master Lü said: Refining form into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit to merge with the Dao—this begins with the Returned Elixir. What, then, is the "Returned Elixir"?

Master Zhong said: The term *elixir* does not refer to color; red and yellow cannot produce it. The term *elixir* does not refer to taste; sweetness and harmony cannot compose it. The elixir is the Cinnabar Field. There are three Cinnabar Fields: the upper is the abode of spirit, the middle is the palace of qi, and the lower is the region of essence. From essence, qi is born—qi resides in the middle elixir. From qi, spirit is born—spirit resides in the upper elixir. True water and true qi unite to form essence—essence resides in the lower elixir. All who uphold the Dao possess these three elixirs. Yet qi is governed by the kidneys and has not yet ascended to the Central Origin; spirit is stored in the heart and has not yet transcended into the Upper Court. Though essence’s radiance cannot return to unite, the three elixirs ultimately remain useless.

Master Lü said: Within the mysterious lies further mystery. All people possess a destiny, but within destiny there is no essence—this is not one’s own qi, but the original yang of one’s parents. Without essence, there is no qi—this is not one’s own spirit, but the original spirit of one’s parents. Essence, qi, and spirit are the treasures of the Three Fields. How can they be constantly maintained within the upper, middle, and lower palaces?

Master Zhong said: From the kidneys, qi is born, and within qi lies the True One’s water. If water returns to the lower elixir, essence nourishes the numinous root, and qi is naturally generated. From the heart, fluid is born, and within fluid lies the correct yang qi. If qi returns to the middle elixir, qi nourishes the numinous source, and spirit is naturally generated. Gathering the numinous into spirit, merging spirit into the Dao, returning to the upper elixir—only then is transcendence achieved.

Master Lü said: There are upper, middle, and lower Cinnabar Fields. *Return* means that which has gone forth finds its way back. The principle of the Returned Elixir is profound and subtle—pray, explain it in detail.

Master Zhong said: There is the Lesser Returned Elixir, the Greater Returned Elixir, the Seven-Return Elixir, the Nine-Transformation Elixir, the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir, the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir, the elixir that returns the lower elixir to the upper, the elixir that returns the upper elixir to the middle, the elixir that returns the middle elixir to the lower, the elixir that returns yang to yin, and the elixir that returns yin to yang. Not only do their names differ, but their timing and methods of practice vary as well.

Master Lü said: What, then, is the Lesser Returned Elixir?

Master Zhong said: The Lesser Returned Elixir originates from the lower origin—the lower origin is the master of the Five Viscera and the root of the Three Fields. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water—since they generate one another, their timing is not amiss. When it is time to generate, the ungenerated is drawn forth, like a mother’s love for her child. Fire restrains metal, metal restrains wood, wood restrains earth, earth restrains water, water restrains fire—since they restrain one another, their measures are not lost. When it is time to restrain, the unrestrained is supplemented, like the union of husband and wife. Qi and fluid circulate in an endless cycle. From *zǐ* (子) to *wǔ* (午), yin and yang are generated; from *mǎo* (卯) to *yǒu* (酉), yin and yang pause. In the span of one day and night, the cycle returns to the lower elixir once—this is called the Lesser Returned Elixir. Those who uphold the Dao gather medicine and apply fire within this process to complete the lower elixir—this is the reason.

Master Lü said: The Lesser Returned Elixir is now understood. What, then, is the Greater Returned Elixir?

Master Zhong said: Dragon and tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout; lead and mercury are withdrawn and added to form the Great Medicine. In the Palace of the Dark Warrior, the golden essence just arises; beneath the Jade Capital Mountain, true qi begins to ascend. The River Chariot courses over the ridge, irrigating the Jade Liquid along the central thoroughfare.

From the lower elixir field it ascends to the upper elixir field; from the upper elixir field it returns once more to the lower. What follows arises from what precedes, and when the cycle is complete, this is called the Greater Returned Elixir. Those who uphold the Dao within this process rouse dragon and tiger to soar as golden essence, nurture the immortal embryo to generate true qi, and thus complete the middle elixir—this is the reason.

Master Lü said: The Greater Returned Elixir is now understood. What, then, are the Sevenfold Returned Elixir and the Ninefold Cyclic Elixir?

Master Zhong said: The generative and consummative numbers of the Five Phases total fifty-five. Heaven one and Earth two, Heaven three and Earth four, Heaven five and Earth six, Heaven seven and Earth eight, Heaven nine and Earth ten. One, three, five, seven, nine are yang, totaling twenty-five; two, four, six, eight, ten are yin, totaling thirty. Beginning with the kidneys: water one, fire two, wood three, metal four, earth five—these are the generative numbers of the Five Phases, three yang and two yin. Beginning with the kidneys: water six, fire seven, wood eight, metal nine, earth ten—these are the consummative numbers of the Five Phases, three yin and two yang. Within the human body, the Dao of the generative and consummative Five Phases is fully present: water is the kidneys, and the kidneys hold one and six; fire is the heart, and the heart holds two and seven; wood is the liver, and the liver holds three and eight; metal is the lungs, and the lungs hold four and nine; earth is the spleen, and the spleen holds five and ten. Each organ possesses both yin and yang: yin flourishes at eight and doubles at two, so when qi reaches the liver, the residual yin of the kidneys is exhausted; when qi reaches the heart, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin, for two resides in the heart while eight resides in the liver. Yang is exhausted at nine and flourishes at one, so when fluid reaches the lungs, the residual yang of the heart is exhausted; when fluid reaches the kidneys, the Supreme Ultimate generates yang, for one resides in the kidneys while nine resides in the lungs. Those who uphold the Dao first conjoin dragon and tiger, gathering the heart’s true yang qi—the true yang qi is the heart’s seven. Seven returns to the middle origin and enters the lower elixir field, nurturing the immortal embryo, then returns to the heart—this is called the Sevenfold Returned Elixir. When the two and eight of yin are dissolved, true qi is generated and the heart is without yin, thus severing two; when the Great Medicine is complete, the liver is without yin, thus severing eight. Once the two and eight of yin are dissolved, the three and nine of yang may flourish. The liver, having severed yang, assists the heart, so the liver’s qi of three flourishes. Seven having returned to the heart to sever the lung’s fluid, the lung’s nine turns to assist the heart, so the three and nine of yang flourish—this is the Ninefold Cyclic Elixir.

Master Lü said: The Sevenfold Return refers to the heart’s yang returning to the heart and residing in the middle elixir; the Ninefold Cycle refers to the lung’s yang, originally born from the heart, turning and returning to the heart, also residing in the middle elixir. The Sevenfold Return and Ninefold Cycle are now understood. What, then, is the mutual exchange of golden fluid and jade fluid, the upper, middle, and lower fields interacting, yin and yang reciprocating to return the elixir?

Master Zhong said: Former worthies and ancient sages often spoke of lung fluid entering the lower elixir field as the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir, and heart fluid entering the lower elixir field as the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. This discourse is not without subtlety, yet it does not fully reveal the profound mechanism. The lungs generate the kidneys through metal generating water, but when metal enters water, how can this be called a returned elixir? The kidneys restrain the heart through water restraining fire, but when water enters fire, how can this be called a returned elixir? Golden fluid is lung fluid; lung fluid forms the embryonic sac, containing dragon and tiger, safeguarding and conveying them within the Yellow Court. As the Great Medicine nears completion, it is drawn from behind the elbow, and the lung fluid soars to enter the upper palace, then descends to return to the middle elixir, from the middle elixir returning to the lower elixir field—thus it is called the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. Jade fluid is kidney fluid; kidney fluid ascends with original qi to pay homage at the heart, accumulating to become metal-water, raising to fill the Jade Pool, dispersing as jasper blossoms, refining into white snow. If it is received from the middle field to enter the lower elixir field, when medicine is present, it bathes the immortal embryo. If it is ascended from the middle field to enter the four limbs, refining the form transmutes the mortal bones. Neither ascending nor receiving, it circulates endlessly—thus it is called the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; within yang resides the true one of water, and this water ascends with yang—this is the elixir of yin returning to yang. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born; within yin resides the true yang of qi, and this qi descends with yin—this is the elixir of yang returning to yin. Nourishing the brain and refining the crown returns the lower to the upper; achieving balance and irrigation returns the upper to the middle; firing the elixir and advancing the flame returns the middle to the lower; refining the body and incinerating the form returns the lower to the middle. The Five Phases are inverted, the three fields return and repeat, mutually exchanging until the form is refined into qi, qi is refined into spirit. From the lower elixir field it transmutes to the middle, from the middle to the upper, from the upper it transmutes to exit the Heavenly Gate, discarding the mortal frame to enter the ranks of sages and immortals—only then is the work of three transmutations complete, ascending from below without further return.

**On Refining the Form, Fourteenth**

Master Lü said: The returned elixir is now understood. May I hear the principle of "refining the form"?

Master Zhong said: In human life, form and spirit are exterior and interior. Spirit is the master of form, and form is the dwelling of spirit. The essence within form generates qi, and qi generates spirit; fluid generates qi, and within qi fluid is generated—these are the mother and child within form. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water; qi transmits between mother and child, and fluid flows between husband and wife—these are the yin and yang within form.

Water transforms into fluid, fluid into blood, blood into essence—this is yin receiving yang to generate life. Should yin and yang fall out of harmony, then tears, mucus, saliva, and sweat issue uncontrollably, and yin loses its generative power. Qi transforms into essence, essence into pearl, pearl into mercury, mercury into cinnabar—this is yang receiving yin to achieve completion. Should yin and yang fall out of harmony, then sickness, aging, death, and suffering arise, and yang cannot be generated.

Without yin, yang cannot be generated; without yang, yin cannot be completed. Can a follower of the Dao cultivate yang without cultivating yin, refine the self without refining the substance? At the moment one’s form receives qi, it is the balanced union of father’s and mother’s true qi, where essence and blood coalesce into the embryo, lodged within the mother’s pure yin. Within yin, yin is generated; through form, form is shaped. Once the fetus is complete and qi is full, this stately six-foot frame is entirely yin—all but a single point of original yang.

If one desires long life without death, one must refine the form to abide in the world, enduring kalpa after kalpa. If one desires to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, one must refine the form to transform into qi, so that a body exists beyond the body.

Master Lü said: Form is the image of yin, and yin possesses substance. To make the substantial into the insubstantial, to transform form into qi and transcend the mortal frame to enter the rank of sages—this is the supreme method of refinement. By preserving qi within form and nourishing form with qi, one may achieve minor blessings of peace and longevity, or greater ones of preserving form to abide in the world. The aged return to youth, the youthful maintain their countenance for eternity. Three hundred and sixty years become a single year, thirty-six thousand years a single kalpa, thirty-six thousand kalpas a single great kalpa. In this vast expanse of kalpas, the passage of years becomes immeasurable, yet one endures as long as heaven and earth—this is the verification of refining the form.

May I hear of the workings of this alchemical mechanism that yields such verification?

Master Zhong said: The human form is completed in three hundred days within the womb. After birth, qi is full in five thousand days. Five feet and five inches constitute the fundamental frame, corresponding to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. Should there be variations in size, they are measured proportionally to ensure harmony. Above the heart lies the Nine Heavens; below the kidneys, the Nine Earths. From the kidneys to the heart is eight inches and four fen; from the heart to the first ring of the *chonglou* is eight inches and four fen; from the first ring of the *chonglou* to the crown is eight inches and four fen. From the kidneys to the crown spans two feet, five inches, and two fen. The original qi fills this measure in a single day and night, cycling three hundred and twenty times. Each cycle traverses two feet, five inches, and two fen, totaling eighty-one zhang of original qi—corresponding to the pure yang number of nine nines.

The distance between heart and kidneys aligns with the celestial and terrestrial proportions. From the kidneys to the crown spans two feet and five inches, further conforming to the pure yang number of five fives in the Five Phases. Thus, original qi follows the breath outward: when exhaled, the constructive and defensive qi circulate freely. The upright qi of heaven and earth responds to the seasons and nodes, now uniting, now parting, extending without limit. When inhaled, the qi enters, and the channels and collaterals open wide. Each exhalation and inhalation embodies the true qi of heaven, earth, and humanity, coursing before the Twelve Stories. One departure and one return constitute a single breath. In a day and night, a person takes thirteen thousand five hundred breaths.

Dividing them: thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations, each expelling one’s own original qi from within; thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations, each drawing in the upright qi of heaven and earth from without. If the root is firm and original qi unharmed, then between exhalation and inhalation, one may seize the upright qi of heaven and earth. Refining qi with qi, it disperses to fill the Four Great Elements. The clear becomes constructive, the turbid defensive, all flowing unimpeded. The vertical channels and horizontal collaterals all attain ease. Cold and heat cannot harm, toil and hardship cannot trouble. The body is light, the bones strong, the qi fresh, the spirit clear—eternal life is preserved, and one remains forever unaging.

Should the root be unstable, essence exhausted, and qi weakened, then above, original qi leaks away; below, the foundational palace is unnourished. The qi of heaven and earth that is inhaled flows out in abundance. The eighty-one zhang of original qi dwindles through nine nines, no longer belonging to oneself but instead seized by heaven and earth. How then can one seize the upright qi of heaven and earth? As yin accumulates and yang wanes, qi weakens and illness arises; when qi is spent, death follows, and one falls into the cycle of rebirth.

Master Lü said: How can original qi be prevented from dissipating, so that by refining the form, one may seize the upright qi of heaven and earth and endure through great kalpas?

Master Zhong said: To achieve victory in war, one’s troops must be strong; to ensure the people’s peace, the nation must be prosperous. The "troops" are the original qi. When deployed internally, they dissolve the yin of form and substance; when deployed externally, they seize the qi of heaven and earth. The "nation" is one’s own body. The tangible aspects of the body are abundant and ever-sufficient; the intangible aspects are firm and never lacking. Though ten thousand gates stand open, not a single loss is feared; should a single horse stray, many losses may befall. Whether advancing or retreating, one refines the substance and burns the body; whether ascending or descending, one nourishes yang and dissolves yin. The time to scorch heaven and earth arrives in due course—how can the refinement of qi and fluid lack daily vigilance?

Refining the form with *jade fluid*, riding the armored dragon to ascend and soar, white snow fills the dusty flesh. Refining the form with *golden fluid*, pursuing the thunder chariot to descend, golden light fills the chamber. Master Lü said: The principle of refining the form is now roughly understood. What are the *golden fluid* and *jade fluid*?

Master Zhong said: Refining the form with *golden fluid* causes the bones to glow golden, the body to radiate golden light, and golden petals to manifest spontaneously in the void. This is the Five Qi converging at the origin, the Three Yangs gathering at the crown—the moment one transcends the mortal frame, the day the Golden Elixir is fully realized.

When refining the form with *jade fluid*, the flesh becomes suffused with *yang*-butter, the body resembling jade trees, jasper blossoms, and jade buds—transforming the mortal frame so that radiance shines upon others. Riding the wind, one soars freely, the form becoming qi. For those who uphold the Dao, though they may know the method of the Returned Elixir, the work of refining the form is no small matter.

When the *jade fluid* returns as the Elixir, the Embryonic Immortal ascends in the upward movement, while the River Chariot transports it through the Four Great Elements. It begins with the liver: when the liver receives it, light fills the eyes, and the eyes become dark as lacquer. Next, the heart receives it, and the *spirit-fluid* is born daily, the fluid becoming white snow. Then the spleen receives it, and the flesh becomes smooth as congealed fat, all scars vanishing. Next, the lungs receive it, and the nose detects celestial fragrance, the complexion restored to youth. Finally, the kidneys receive it, returning once more to their original palace: within the ears, the sound of strings and pipes is ever heard, and at the temples, the color of gray hair is forever banished. Such is the refining of the form with *jade fluid*.

As for refining the form with *golden fluid*, it begins with the Returned Elixir yet unreturned, meeting the *Lord Fire*—this is called *Completion*. Once the Elixir has returned and rises again, it contends with true *yin*—this is called *Refining the Substance*. Earth inherently overcomes water, but when the *golden fluid* resides in earth, it causes the Yellow Emperor to turn his light back, uniting with the Great Yin. Fire inherently overcomes metal, but when the *golden fluid* resides in fire, it causes the Red Child to share the furnace, spontaneously generating within purple qi. Fire arises within water, *yin* dissolves within *yang*, the Golden Elixir transforms within the Yellow Court, and the *yang*-spirit is refined amid the Five Qi: in the liver, green qi surges; in the lungs, white light emerges; in the heart, red radiance appears; in the kidneys, black qi ascends; in the spleen, yellow light gathers. The Five Qi converge at the Middle Origin, ascending from the *Lord Fire* to transcend the Inner Sanctum.

The *yang* within the *yin* of the Lower Origin—its *yang* without *yin*—ascends and gathers in the Spirit Palace. The *yang* within the *yang* of the Middle Origin—its *yang* without birth—ascends and gathers in the Spirit Palace. The great medicine of the Yellow Court, with *yin* exhausted and pure *yang* remaining, ascends and gathers in the Spirit Palace. The Five Fluids converge at the Lower Origin, the Five Qi converge at the Middle Origin, and the Three Yangs converge at the Upper Origin. Once the convergence is complete, the merit of three thousand is fulfilled: now cranes dance atop the crown, or dragons soar within the body. Only the resounding music of pipes is heard, and immortal blossoms scatter in profusion. The Purple Court lingers, true fragrance is richly redolent, and the three thousand merits fulfilled—one is no longer a mortal of the dusty world. As a single stick of incense burns away, one becomes a guest of Penglai and Yingzhou, transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood, shedding the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal.

**Discourse on the Convergence at the Origin, Fifteenth***
Master Lü said: The principle of refining the form is now understood.

What is meant by "Convergence at the Origin"? Might I be permitted to hear of it?

Master Zhong said: When the Great Elixir nears completion, the Jade Fluid returns as the Cinnabar, and one bathes the Embryonic Immortal. Once true qi is born, it carries the Jade Fluid upward to transform the mortal bones—this is called "refining the form with Jade Fluid." Later, when the Golden Radiance flies up from behind the elbow and the River Chariot enters the Inner Court, ascending from above to the middle, then descending from the middle to below, the Golden Fluid returns as the Cinnabar. Refining the Golden Sand with this, the Five Qi converge at the Origin, and the Three Yangs gather at the crown—this is "refining qi to become spirit," not merely "refining the form to abide in the world."

The Convergence at the Origin is known to few, past or present. Should one know of it, sages and worthies do not speak of it. For this is the method of true immortals’ great accomplishment, the subtle mechanism hidden by Heaven and Earth, the esoteric matter of the Three Clarities, the profound principle beyond words and images, the wondrous truth of no-question and no-response. I fear that if your resolve is not steadfast, your study not single-minded, your heart not tranquil, and your inquiry not earnest, careless speech may instead increase my transgression of leaking sacred secrets, to the mutual benefit of none.

Master Lü said: First, one awakens to the true immortals and recognizes the great Dao. Next, one knows the seasons and comprehends the celestial mechanism. One distinguishes the true origins of Water and Fire, knows that Dragon and Tiger do not arise from liver and lungs, examines the great principle of withdrawal and addition, and discerns that Lead and Mercury are not Kan and Li. The art of inverting the Five Phases has already been instructed; the mechanism of the Three Fields’ reversal has again been expounded. One thoroughly understands the principle of returning the Cinnabar and refining the form, and deeply knows the art of longevity and deathlessness. Yet the origin of transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood, the Dao of shedding the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal, lies in refining qi to converge at the Origin. As for the Convergence at the Origin, I dare to offer a brief explanation of its essentials.

Master Zhong said: The Dao is originally formless. The Great Primal reveals simplicity; the Upper Clarity and Lower Turbidity merge as one. Once the Great Primal divides, the primordial chaos first separates into Heaven and Earth. Within Heaven and Earth, the five directions—east, west, south, north, and center—are arrayed. Each direction has its own Emperor, and each Emperor has two children: one Yang and one Yin. The two qi generate and complete each other, dividing into the Five Phases; the Five Phases generate and complete each other, establishing the Six Qi, thus forming the Three Yins and Three Yangs.

Extending this principle to human conception: at first, essence and qi are one. Once essence and qi separate, the two kidneys are born first. The left kidney is the Yang Kidney, which ascends qi and transmits it upward to the liver. The right kidney is the Yin Kidney, which receives fluid and transmits it downward to the bladder. The Yang and Yin Kidneys arise from Nothingness, transforming Nonbeing into Being. They are the true qi of father and mother, received in the realm of pure Yin. Thus it is said, "The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Yang and Yin Kidneys." The Gate of the Yang and Yin Kidneys may be compared to the root of Heaven and Earth. The Yang and Yin Kidneys are the two kidneys; from them arise the Five Viscera and Six Bowels in their entirety.

Among them:
- The liver is Wood, called Jia and Yi, comparable to the Azure Emperor of the East.
- The heart is Fire, called Bing and Ding, comparable to the Vermilion Emperor of the South.
- The lungs are Metal, called Geng and Xin, comparable to the White Emperor of the West.
- The spleen is Earth, called Wu and Ji, comparable to the Yellow Emperor of the Center.
- The kidneys are Water, called Ren and Gui, comparable to the Black Emperor of the North.

At the beginning of human life, there is no form or image, only one Yin and one Yang. Once the fetus is complete and the intestines and stomach form, the Six Qi divide, merely the Three Males and Three Females. One qi moves the Five Phases, and the Five Phases move the Six Qi.

First, one recognizes Yin and Yang: within Yang there is Yang within Yin, and within Yin there is Yin within Yang. Next, one recognizes Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, each containing Water within Fire, Fire within Water, Water within Metal, Metal within Wood, Wood within Fire, and Fire within Earth. These five interact and unite, so the two qi divide into the Six Qi, and the great Dao scatters into the Five Phases.

After the Winter Solstice, when one Yang arises in the earth of the five directions, all Yangs are born. One Emperor presides over its seasonal command, while the other four Emperors assist. For example, when the command of spring has been issued, if the Black Emperor does not withdraw its command, cold cannot transform into warmth; if the Vermilion Emperor does not prepare its command, warmth cannot transform into heat.

After the Summer Solstice, when one Yin arises in the heavens of the five directions, all Yins descend. One Emperor presides over its seasonal command, while the other four Emperors assist. For example, when the command of autumn has been issued, if the Vermilion Emperor does not withdraw its command, heat cannot transform into coolness; if the Black Emperor does not prepare its command, coolness cannot transform into cold.

At the Winter Solstice, Yang arises from the earth to converge qi at Heaven. At the Summer Solstice, Yin arises from Heaven to converge qi at earth. Those who uphold the Dao must deeply investigate this principle.

Between the sun and moon, when one Yang first arises, the qi of the Five Viscera converge at the Middle Origin. When one Yin first arises, the fluids of the Five Viscera converge at the Lower Origin. The Yang within Yin, the Yang within Yang, and the Yang within the midst of Yin and Yang—these Three Yangs ascend to converge at the Inner Court of the Heart Spirit, returning to the Heavenly Palace. All these are the Convergence at the Origin.

Master Lü said: When Yang arises, the Five Qi converge at the Middle Origin; when Yin arises, the Five Fluids converge at the Lower Origin. If the Yang within Yang, the Yang within Yin, and the Yang within the midst of Yin and Yang converge at the Upper Origin—though some know of this practice, how can one transcend and escape the dusty world?

Master Zhong said: If the primordial Yang qi, at the time when one Yang first arises, ascends to converge at the Middle Origin, all people are like this. If accumulated qi generates fluid, and at the time when one Yin first arises, descends to converge at the Lower Origin, all people are like this. If one practices in this manner, few can achieve transcendence.

If one wishes to transcend the mortal and enter the sacred, to shed the physical form and ascend as an immortal, one must first achieve the union of Dragon and Tiger to form the Great Elixir. Once the Great Elixir is formed, true qi is born. When true qi is born, one employs the months within the year to determine waxing and waning; the days within the month to fix the affairs of the celestial stems; and the hours within the day to establish the count of breaths. Nurture Yang with Yang, ensuring no Yin lingers within Yang; refine Yin with Yang, ensuring no Yang scatters within Yin.

In general: in spring, the liver flourishes while the spleen weakens; in summer, the heart flourishes while the lungs weaken; in autumn, the lungs flourish while the liver weakens; in winter, the kidneys flourish while the heart weakens. For humans, the kidneys are the root, and in every season, the spleen flourishes while the kidneys weaken—only the kidneys suffer depletion across the four seasons, which is why people often fall ill. In general: when Jia and Yi govern the liver, guard against the spleen’s qi failing to circulate; when Bing and Ding govern the heart, guard against the lungs’ qi failing to circulate; when Wu and Ji govern the spleen, guard against the kidneys’ qi failing to circulate; when Geng and Xin govern the lungs, guard against the liver’s qi failing to circulate; when Ren and Gui govern the kidneys, guard against the heart’s qi failing to circulate. When one qi flourishes, another weakens; when one organ waxes, another wanes—this is why people often fall ill.

In general: the heart’s qi sprouts in Hai and is born in Yin, flourishes in Si, and weakens in Shen; the liver’s qi sprouts in Shen and is born in Hai, flourishes in Yin, and weakens in Si; the lungs’ qi sprouts in Yin and is born in Si, flourishes in Shen, and weakens in Hai; the kidneys’ qi sprouts in Si and is born in Shen, flourishes in Hai, and weakens in Yin. The spleen’s qi follows the liver in spring, the heart in summer, the lungs in autumn, and the kidneys in winter. People, unaware of daily practice, do not comprehend the times of flourishing and weakening—this is why they often fall ill.

When the three Yangs of the day, month, and hour converge, refine Yang to prevent Yin from arising; when the three Yins converge, nurture Yang to prevent it from scattering. Moreover, once true qi is born, use the pure Yang qi to refine the qi of the five viscera, exhaling without ceasing, and in one movement of the original nature, ascend to the Heavenly Pool. First, with the kidneys free of Yin, the Nine Rivers are without waves; next, with the liver free of Yin, the Eight Passes are forever sealed; next, with the lungs free of Yin, metal and fire share the same furnace; next, with the spleen free of Yin, the Jade Gate does not open; finally, as true qi ascends, the four qi converge into one. Even if the Golden Fluid descends, a cup of water cannot overcome the fire of kindling. Water and fire envelop each other, merging into one, entering the Spirit Palace. Settle the breath, gaze inward, focus the mind without distraction—spirit and consciousness become wondrous. In stillness, one constantly hears music, as if in a dream yet not a dream, as if in a realm of emptiness and nothingness. The scenery and landscapes are unlike the dusty world, their splendor and beauty surpassing the mortal realm—pavilions and palaces, jade-green tiles wreathed in mist, pearls and silks, fragrant incense forming ranks.

At this time, one transcends the Inner Court, and the Yang spirit gathers to return to the Upper Cinnabar, refining the spirit into immortality to merge with the Great Dao. With one strike at the Gate of Heaven, the Dharma Body appears enveloped in golden light. Amidst the depths of blossoming flowers, seated in the mortal form, one traverses the void as if walking on level ground, a thousand miles no farther than an outstretched arm. If one chooses to return, re-entering the original body, spirit and form unite, and one’s longevity equals that of heaven and earth. If one wearies of the mortal world and lodges in a mortal womb, returning to the Ten Isles, at the Purple Mansion of the Supreme Subtle True Lord, one verifies one’s origins, confronts one’s name and surname, and assesses the depth of one’s merit and conduct. Attaining residence on the Three Isles, one roams forever beyond the wind and dust—this is called transcending the mortal and shedding the mundane.

Master Lü said: Refining the form only preserves one’s life in the world; refining qi is what enables ascension as an immortal. People who fail to grasp the profound mechanism, practicing fetal breathing without the Elixir, forcibly retaining it in the abdomen, may accumulate cold qi and fall ill or stir false Yang and invite disease. Though they cultivate in hopes of longevity, such delusion only leads to illness. They do not realize that once the Fetal Immortal is achieved, true qi is born; true qi is born, and fetal breathing arises naturally; fetal breathing refines qi, and refining qi gives birth to spirit.

Yet in refining qi, one must examine the months within the year, the days within the month, and the hours within the day. Sit upright in a quiet chamber, free from scheming and distractions. At this time, all lingering thoughts and attachments must be dispelled. If idle thoughts persist unceasingly, wisdom leaks, and the will to ascend as an immortal remains unsettled—what is to be done?

Master Zhong said: The union of Dragon and Tiger has its proper time, and practice has its proper method. Follow the time, practice the method, seek the Dao through the method—success will come swiftly, as easy as turning one’s palm. From ancient times to the present, those who have attained understanding close their eyes and still their minds, entering the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, relying on inner contemplation to stabilize the spirit and consciousness.

**On Inner Contemplation, Sixteenth**
Master Lü said: May I hear the principle of "inner contemplation"?
Master Zhong said: The methods of inner contemplation and sitting in forgetfulness, of visualization and concentration, have been adopted by some sages and rejected by others. One fears the mind-monkey and intent-horse, ceaselessly restless, lest external things erode one’s resolve, and no image arises from the void. Thus, one makes the ears unhearing, the eyes unseeing, the mind unconfused, and the intent undisturbed—visualization, inner contemplation, and sitting in forgetfulness are indispensable!

Alas, the ignorant and unlearned do not know the time of union, nor the method of practice. They merely hope for success through visualization, forming the Elixir within intent, extracting medicine from thought, snorting and swallowing, yearning for the tangible sun and moon or the formless heaven and earth, retaining them in the abdomen and mouth—this is truly child’s play!

Thus, the enlightened adepts and extraordinary individuals, upon abandoning sitting in forgetfulness and visualization, declare: "Wealth gained in dreams cannot sustain use! Drawing cakes on the ground cannot sate hunger!" Empty within emptiness, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water—ultimately, no achievement is possible.

Yet there is merit to be found, for the heart is easily stirred, and intent is difficult to subdue. On auspicious days and favorable hours, one may gather and refine. Though one knows the realm of clarity and stillness, the heart is enslaved by affairs, and resolve is swayed by emotions. Even the slightest deviation separates one from heaven and earth; though years and months accumulate, no progress is seen—this failure lies in a chaotic heart and a reckless intent.

The keen observer focuses on the beauty of paintings and fails to see Mount Tai or Hua. The attentive listener attends to the sounds of strings and bamboo but does not hear thunder. If even the minor functions of the ears and eyes are thus, how much more so when the singular heart roams the six directions, encompassing all things? At the moment of seizing the time and applying the method, can one do without visualization and inner contemplation to bring it to fruition?

Lü Zu asked: "What, in broad terms, is meant by 'visualization and inner contemplation'?"
Zhong Zu replied: "When yang ascends, one visualizes many things: as man, as dragon, as fire, as heaven, as clouds, as cranes, as the sun, as horses, as chariots, as mist, as carriages, as flowers, as qi—all such inner contemplations and visualizations correspond to the image of yang’s ascent.

When yin descends, one visualizes many things: as woman, as tiger, as water, as earth, as rain, as tortoises, as the moon, as oxen, as springs, as mud, as lead, as leaves—all such inner contemplations and visualizations correspond to the image of yin’s descent.

The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior—since these names exist, their images must also exist. The Five Peaks and Nine Provinces, the Four Seas and Three Isles, the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden, the river chariot and layered towers—calling forth their names and comparing their categories cannot be fully described. All are established as images within the void to stabilize the spirit and consciousness.

Before the fish is caught, the trap must not be discarded; before the hare is captured, the snare must not be absent."

The rear carriage moves only after treading the tracks of the one before; the great vessel once completed must serve as the model for those to follow. Thus, the method of inner contemplation must never be abandoned in practice. It cannot be clung to indefinitely, nor can it be severed even for a moment. If thoughts are cut off and no images arise, this is true thought; true thought is true emptiness. In this realm of true emptiness, one gradually ascends toward the real and departs from the dim crossroads—this is the path of transcendence.

When laying the foundation and beginning anew, progress can be made day by day. Then, visualization may be employed. Moreover, as one daily diminishes for the Dao, entering the realm of the subtle and formless, the method naturally simplifies, relying entirely on inner contemplation.

Master Lü said: "When the Dragon and Tiger unite in mating to pair yin and yang, what is the visualization like?"
Master Zhong replied: "At first, in their union, yin and yang are paired to stabilize Kan and Li. The visualization is this: the Nine August True Men lead a small boy in red robes upward; the Nine August True Mothers lead a small girl in black robes downward. They meet before the Yellow Chamber, where an old woman in yellow receives them, following the rites of a mortal couple, joyful at their union. The girl descends, the boy ascends, as in mortal partings. When this is complete, the old woman holds an object shaped like a red tangerine and casts it into the Yellow Chamber, where it is caught in a golden vessel. This boy is Qian seeking from Kun, his yang returning to its original place, yang carrying yin to rejoin its homeland. This girl is Kun seeking from Qian, her yin returning to its original place, yin embracing yang to rejoin its homeland. This is Kan and Li exchanging, yin and yang paired in union.

If in raging flames, one sees a black tiger ascending; if in surging waves, one sees a red dragon descending. The two beasts meet and battle before a towering pavilion. The vermilion gates swing open, and within swirling mists, a king gestures amid a sky ablaze with fire, above which towering waves rise. Fire surges and falls, mists fill heaven and earth. The dragon and tiger coil and entwine, entering a golden vessel, descending into the Yellow Chamber, as if placed within a casket.

This is the visualization of the Dragon and Tiger mating to transform into the yellow sprout.

Master Lü said: "Pairing yin and yang through the Dragon and Tiger’s union in inner contemplation is now understood. But what of the visualization for ‘advancing the fire to refine the elixir’?"
Master Zhong replied: "The visualization is this: a vessel like a tripod or cauldron, yellow or black, shaped like a wheel, with the Azure Dragon to the left and the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird before and the Dark Warrior behind. Beside it stand two ministers in purple robes, bowing and holding jade tablets; attendants stoke the fire beneath the vessel. Then a king in red robes rides a red horse, driving fiery clouds from the sky, raising his whip and shouting, fearing the fire is too small or the flames too weak. The flames blaze fiercely, pressing against the heavens, but the celestial gates do not open. The mists descend again, swirling fourfold. The people, vessels, cauldron, king, and ministers are all enveloped in crimson flames, gesturing and calling to one another, competing to advance the fire. The water in the vessel, though without vapor, seems congealed; the pearl within the water, though without light, seems radiant.

This is the visualization of advancing the fire to refine the elixir.

Master Lü said: "Does inner contemplation and visualization end with gathering the medicine and advancing the fire, or does it follow each method and each stage?"
Master Zhong replied: "Clouds and thunder descend, mists and vapors rise. Sometimes heavenly flowers rain down, auspicious winds and propitious qi arise beneath the palace halls; sometimes immortal maidens and jade women ride colorful phoenixes and auspicious simurghs, descending from the azure heavens. In golden platters, they offer jade dew and rosy nectar to the king.

This is the visualization of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir reaching completion.

If the Dragon and Tiger drag a chariot through fire, surging upward through the Three Passes—each pass guarded by countless soldiers and officials in armor, fearful of the intruder—first the Dragon and Tiger charge but cannot break through; then the great fire burns them open. They ascend Kunlun without pause, halting only at the Heavenly Pool. Or three cranes soar through the Three Heavens, or a pair of butterflies enter the Three Palaces. Or within five-colored clouds, a small boy in red robes is borne past the Celestial Gate; or a golden chariot and jade carriage carry a king beyond the Three Realms.

This is the visualization of the ‘Flying Golden Essence behind the Elbow’ and the ‘Great River Chariot.’

Then a red-robed messenger rides a chariot, traveling in sequence: from Ji Province to Yan Province, from Yan to Qing, from Qing to Xu, from Xu to Yang, from Yang to Jing, from Jing to Liang, from Liang to Yong, and from Yong back to Ji. East, west, south, and north—all converge at Yu Province, where they pause before continuing. The treasures gathered are gold and jade; the tasks accomplished are solidification and stagnation. A single official transmits the decree, and the Nine Provinces are harmonized. Cycling endlessly, the movement never ceases.

Or journeying through the Five Peaks, beginning with Mount Heng; or sailing the Five Lakes, beginning with the Northern Lake. Or heavenly decrees summon the Five Emperors, or royal commands appoint the Five Lords.

This is the visualization of the returning elixir.

Then pearls and jades scatter upon the earth; or rain and dew nourish all things; or the sea tide fills the hundred rivers; or yang arises and stirs the ten thousand beings; or fire blazes across heaven and earth; or mists and dew fill the cosmos.

This is the visualization of refining the form.

Then, like a crane leaving its nest, or a dragon emerging from its cave; or the Five Emperors ascending to heaven, or five-colored clouds rising; or riding a cinnabar phoenix through the azure void; or in dreams ascending the celestial thoroughfares; or as heavenly flowers fall in profusion, immortal music resounds, golden light swirls, and one enters the splendor of palaces and halls."

Such are the visualizations of audience at the Origin.

After audience at the Origin, one no longer engages in visualization—this is called "inner contemplation."

Master Lü said: "Inner contemplation of the mysterious principle differs from the previous methods. May I hear of it?"

Master Zhong said: "Those who cultivate the Dao from ancient times to the present have not grasped the celestial mechanism. At the outset, they fail to follow the method in practice, seeking swift liberation. They take in much and expel little, practicing embryonic breathing, stilling the mind, closing the eyes, and engaging in inner contemplation. Yet they only attain quiescence and manifest a yin spirit, becoming a clear and numinous ghost rather than a pure yang immortal.

True immortals and sagely beings, in gathering the medicine and advancing the fire, in withdrawing lead and adding mercury, in returning the elixir and refining the form, in audience at the Origin and merging the qi, have spoken in earnest and in detail, fearing only that the world would not awaken. Yet they have paid little heed to inner contemplation. Little do they know that the method of inner contemplation is the method of yin-yang transformation, the moment of change between immortality and mortality. Those who uphold the Dao must not slight or underestimate it.

Moreover, the preceding matters—union occurs at set times, practice follows established rules. If one can carefully observe discipline and steadfastly adhere to the timing and method without the slightest deviation, success will be seen in due course. But this inner contemplation has no fixed time, no set rules. Secluded in a profoundly quiet chamber, day and night one sits upright in reverent stillness, recognizing the yang spirit and driving out the yin ghosts.

Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years before transcending the inner court; the World-Honored One stilled his mind for six years before emerging from the cage of the mundane. Thus, inner contemplation is truly a difficult matter.

At first, from above to below, the purple river chariot is carried into the celestial palace. Who would not admire the wealth and honor of the celestial palace? Coming and going, one encounters splendor and extravagance—things unseen by ordinary people—all of which become manifest. Those who uphold the Dao, having long maintained purity and ease in solitude, when their merit is complete, readily accept such pleasures: towers and pavilions adorned with pearls and jade, female musicians playing sheng and huang, rare delicacies and fine foods, exotic grasses and wondrous flowers, scenes and vistas bright as day. If one does not awaken, one may mistake this for truly having arrived at the celestial palace, unaware that it is one’s own inner court, taking the illusory for the real. Lingering without exit or entry, one becomes trapped in the gloomy thoroughfare, the form abides in the world, and one cannot shed the body to become a spirit immortal. Before reaching the celestial palace, one remains in inner contemplation.

Yin ghosts and external demons arise from thought, and from thought arise illusory realms, forming demonic armies. Those who uphold the Dao may thus become wild and dissolute, falling into heterodoxy, or even losing their bodies to external paths, ultimately failing to achieve immortality. For the three corpses and seven poisons desire a person’s death to indulge in their own pleasures, while the nine worms and six thieves torment a person’s peace, leaving no place of refuge.

**On the Seventeenth Difficulty: Demonic Obstacles**

Master Lü said: "Through inner contemplation, the yang spirit is gathered; through refining the spirit, one transcends the inner court; by leaping upward, one exits through the celestial gate, directly ascending to the sagely ranks. Having exited and entered, coming and going without error; whether near or far, all is precise. If one wishes to remain in the world, spirit and form unite; if one wishes to ascend as an immortal, one roams afar to Penglai and the Isles of the Blessed. All this is achieved through inner contemplation to attain liberation. But how are yin ghosts and demonic obstacles to be subdued, so that those who uphold the Dao may ascend as immortals?"

Master Zhong said: "Those who uphold the Dao must first establish steadfast resolve. Matters of affection, profit, fame, and all worldly toils must not sway their great aspiration. Next, they must arouse a bitter resolve, enduring hardship and solitude. All realms of emptiness and purity must not alter their original intent. If one is determined to achieve great completion, one may only attain middling completion; if one is determined to achieve middling completion, one may only attain lesser completion. Moreover, those who do not recognize the great Dao find it difficult to fathom the celestial mechanism. Practicing minor methods, they often favor heterodox paths. Years and months pass in vain, no merit is seen, and in old age, they re-enter the cycle of rebirth. This leads later seekers of the Dao to regard longevity as a delusion and liberation as empty words. Often they hear the Dao but do not awaken, encountering circumstances that stir the mind, losing their resolve to external things, and ultimately failing to escape the nine difficulties and ten demonic obstacles."

Master Lü said: "What are the 'nine difficulties'?"

Master Zhong said: "Before the great medicine is complete, one struggles to endure cold and heat—throughout the year, one needs clothing. Before true qi is born, hunger and thirst remain—each day, one requires three meals. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the pressing need for clothing and food—this is the first difficulty.

Furthermore, with heavy karmic conditions from past lives, one must repay them in this existence. Even when stealing moments in the floating world, one fears the constraints of high halls and the reluctance to abandon revered parents. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the hindrance of elders—this is the second difficulty.

Moreover, those one loves—parents—and those one cherishes—wife and children—impose the shackles of affection and the fetters of emotion, increasing daily. The fiery household and the cart of sorrow never cease. Even with a mind of purity, one struggles to resist the clamor of the world. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the entanglements of love and affection—this is the third difficulty.

Furthermore, possessing the wealth of ten thousand households or the rank of the three highest ministers, the restless mind refuses to rest, and the greedy heart fears insufficiency. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the entanglements of fame and profit—this is the fourth difficulty.

Moreover, in youth, one refuses to cultivate, and in old age, one laments in vain. Qi weakens and illness arises, yet the stubborn heart does not awaken. Fate is thin and calamity strikes, suffering already endured in this life. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from misfortunes arising on all sides—this is the fifth difficulty.

Furthermore, eager to seek a teacher, one fails to discern the true from the false. Some may have eloquent speech, others an ancient and virtuous appearance. At first, one believes they have encountered a lineage of immortals, only to later realize they are mere opportunists. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the constraints of blind teachers—this is the sixth difficulty."

Moreover, blind teachers and reckless companions falsely point to side doors, plucking branches and leaves, never achieving true accord. Petty techniques and heterodox teachings vie in mutual instruction. They know not: the sun and moon do not emerge, but when they do, their great radiance allows all with eyes to see; thunder does not rumble, but when it does, its mighty crash allows all with ears to hear. Yet they, with the dim glow of a firefly’s light and the croaking of well-frogs, flicker and chirp—how could they ever align? Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the divergence of doctrines—this is the seventh difficulty.

Furthermore, what is done in the morning is abandoned by evening; what is sat for is forgotten when standing. Delighted for a moment, they grow weary of perseverance; beginning with diligence, they end in indolence. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the slackening of will and intent—this is the eighth difficulty.

Moreover, within the body, years are lost; within the year, months are lost; within the month, days are lost; within the day, hours are lost. In youth, fame and profit remain unforgotten in the heart; in old age, children and grandchildren constantly occupy the mind. The span of years is limited—do not say, "This year has passed, so I shall wait for the next"; the affairs of life are boundless—do not say, "Today has passed, so I shall wait for tomorrow." Today does not guarantee tomorrow, and old age will never regain youth. Those who uphold the Dao suffer from the wasting of years and months—this is the ninth difficulty.

Only by avoiding these nine difficulties can one truly uphold the Dao. If even one or two remain, all effort is in vain and success unattainable.

Lü Zu asked: "Now that the nine difficulties are known, may I hear of the so-called 'ten demons'?"
Zhong Zu replied: "The ten demons fall into three categories: first, 'external and present'; second, 'dreams and sleep'; third, 'inner vision.'

When the eyes behold a profusion of blossoms, the ears hear the strains of reed pipes and strings, the tongue savors sweet flavors, the nose delights in rare fragrances, the emotions feel at ease, and the spirit soars—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, these are the demons of the six thieves.

When jade towers and jeweled pavilions, painted beams and carved rafters, pearl curtains and embroidered drapes, orchid chambers and aloeswood canopies, coral strewn upon the ground, and halls filled with gold and jade appear—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, this is the demon of wealth.

When golden saddles and jeweled steeds, lofty canopies, lordships of ten thousand households, envoys bearing banners and flags, households clad in purple, and boots and tablets filling the hall appear—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, this is the demon of nobility.

When drifting mists, warm and languid sunlight, violent winds and heavy rains, thunderclaps and lightning flashes, the resounding strains of pipes and strings, or weeping and sorrow appear—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, these are the demons of the six emotions.

When relatives face hardship, family members suffer calamity, children fall ill, parents pass away, brothers scatter, or wives and concubines part—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, this is the demon of love and attachment.

When one is cast into boiling cauldrons, falls from high ridges, is harmed by venomous creatures, poisoned by toxins, encounters insurmountable perils on the road, or dies by legal decree—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, this is the demon of suffering and adversity.

When the Ten Grounds stand in radiance, the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor, the Four Spirits and Seven Luminaries, the Five Peaks and Eight Kings appear in solemn dignity, circling and soaring—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, these are the demons of sages and worthies.

When clouds gather with troops and horses, blades gleam like frost, spears and halberds clash, bows and arrows are drawn, and fierce battles erupt—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, this is the demon of blades and warfare.

When immortal maidens and jade women array themselves in rows, pipes and strings resound, rainbow skirts are raised in unison, and pairs of crimson sleeves vie to offer golden goblets—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, this is the demon of female musicians.

When many beauties of dazzling charm, adorned in rich attire, feast by night in orchid pavilions, their jade forms clad in light silks, their alluring and haughty demeanors vying to pair—if such sights are not recognized for what they are, this is the demon of female beauty.

Though these ten demons arise, it is the failure to recognize them that matters. Once recognized, they take hold; once they take hold, they are grasped. This is why the Dao is not attained. For those who uphold the Dao, if external and present phenomena are neither recognized nor grasped, the heart does not retreat and the will does not waver. In dreams and sleep, if such visions are neither recognized nor clung to, the spirit does not stray and the soul does not scatter. During inner vision, when such sights appear, one must discern their emptiness or reality, distinguish truth from falsehood, and not drift with the waves or mistake thieves for one’s own kin. Then, igniting the true fire of samadhi to burn the body, with a single sweep, the demons scatter. Employing the Purple River Vehicle, one transports one’s own yang spirit, ascending from the inner court to the celestial palace—only then may liberation be sought.

From ancient times to the present, those who love the Dao, though their hearts may be pure, often falter before external circumstances, rarely escaping the ten demons and nine difficulties. They bear only the empty name of loving the Dao, never witnessing its true fruition. Some may renounce worldly toil, dwell in seclusion, and aspire to the Mystery Gate, yet if they cannot fully overcome the nine difficulties or may succumb to one or two of the ten demons, they do not fail to attain the Dao entirely. Within the Dao, they may achieve middling or minor success; among immortals, they may become human or earthbound immortals. But if all demons and difficulties are eradicated, step by step ascending through verified signs, uniting inner vision with the yang spirit, they may swiftly return to the Three Isles.

**On Verification, Eighteenth**
Lü Zu said: "Aversion is illness, yet those who love the Dao seek freedom from illness and enduring peace. Fear is death, yet those who love the Dao seek immortality and eternal life. While the world’s people dwell in the mundane, those who love the Dao aspire to ascend as immortals and wander beyond the material. While the world’s people remain on earth, those who love the Dao seek to transcend the elixir and enter the grotto heavens. Thus, they willingly endure hardship, endure poverty and lowliness, roam their minds in the carefree and unadorned, and conceal their traces in the wilderness and desolate places. Persisting in their practice, they know not the depth of their merit, the exchange of methods, or the timing of transformation and change."

**On Verification, Eighteenth (continued)**

Lü Zu asked: "After commencing cultivation, what is the sequence of verification?"

Zhong Zu replied: "Those who苦心志行持 yet see no fruition do not suffer the Dao’s betrayal—rather, they who follow the Dao without a luminous teacher receive no true method. Those who依法行持 yet see no fruition do not suffer the Dao’s betrayal—rather, they who follow the Dao know not the proper timing, and thus fail to succeed.

If one meets a luminous teacher and obtains the method, practicing the great method in accord with the time, how could verification not manifest?"

Lü Zu asked: "Does the 'method' have a fixed number? Does the 'time' have a fixed number?"

Zhong Zu replied: "The method comprises twelve divisions:
1. Harmonizing yin and yang,
2. Gathering and dispersing water and fire,
3. Conjoining dragon and tiger,
4. Refining the elixir,
5. Flying golden essence behind the elbow,
6. Returning the jade liquid elixir,
7. Refining the form with jade liquid,
8. Returning the golden liquid elixir,
9. Refining the form with golden liquid,
10. Facing the origin to refine qi,
11. Inner contemplation and exchange,
12. Transcending and parting the form.

As for the 'time,' it follows the yearly ascent and descent of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, the monthly cycles of the sun and moon’s movements, and the daily divisions of the four cardinal directions, eight trigrams, ten heavenly stems, twelve earthly branches, one hundred ke, and six thousand fen. When these are apportioned according to the method, from the first day onward, the sequence of verification proceeds without the slightest deviation until one sheds the mortal form and ascends as an immortal.

At first, lewd and deviant thoughts cease entirely; external conduct is cultivated alongside practice. During the gathering of medicine, golden essence fills the body, the mind’s illusions vanish, and yin ghosts are slain.
Next, the heart channel surges upward, and sweet liquid fills the mouth.
Next, yin and yang strike and clash, and at times, the sound of wind and thunder is heard within the abdomen.
Next, the hun and po are unsettled, and dreams are often filled with fearful and startling visions.
Next, the six bowels and four limbs may develop minor ailments, which heal without treatment.
Next, the cinnabar field grows warm, and one’s appearance becomes refined and elegant.
Next, in a dark room, the eyes emit a divine radiance.
Next, in dreams, one is mighty and brave, untouched by harm, uncheated by others, or as if embracing a returned infant.
Next, the golden gate and jade lock seal firmly, ending nocturnal emissions and leakage.
Next, a thunderous roar sounds, the joints connect, and startled sweat flows in all directions.
Next, the jade liquid is simmered and rinsed, congealing into su.
Next, the numinous liquid forms a paste, gradually repelling foul odors, filling the mouth and belly.
Next, the dusty bones grow light, the spirit chamber transforms, and one outpaces galloping horses, moving as if in flight.
Next, facing circumstances without attachment, all cravings cease.
Next, true qi enters things, enabling the cure of others’ illnesses.
Next, inner contemplation becomes luminous, free from obscurity.
Next, both eyes become as dark and bright as lacquer dots, wrinkled skin smooths, and black hair regrows; even the aged retain a youthful countenance.
Next, true qi gradually fills the body, and one feels perpetually sated, eating little yet drinking wine without limit, never appearing drunk.
Next, the body glows with radiance, the spirit and qi become refined and graceful, the sacred elixir generates flavor, the numinous liquid emits fragrance, and true fragrance and rare tastes linger between mouth and nose, perceptible to others.
Next, the eyes see autumn down at a hundred paces.
Next, old scars and blemishes on the body naturally fade, and tears, saliva, and sweat no longer appear.
Next, the embryo is complete and qi is full, ending the need for food and drink.
Next, the inner will is pure and lofty, merging with the Great Void; worldly passions and attachments vanish, the nine worms are eradicated below, and the three corpses die above.
Next, the hun and po no longer wander, ending dreams; the spirit’s brilliance and clarity transcend day and night.
Next, yang essence forms the body, the spirit’s abode is fortified, and the four limbs are unharmed by cold or heat.
Next, life and death can no longer interfere; sitting in forgetfulness and inner contemplation, one roams the divine immortal realm of Huaxu, where towers of jade maidens and resplendent beauty surpass anything in the mortal world.
Next, when merit is complete and conduct is fulfilled, karmic retribution manifests; the Three Clarities secretly bestow the true register, and one comprehends the transformations of yin and yang, foresees human affairs, and perceives disasters and blessings in advance.
Next, the eyes grow weary of worldly dust and refuse further entanglement; dwelling in purity and stillness, the embryonic immortal appears, and a body exists outside the body—this is the divine sage.
Next, true qi becomes pure yang, and exhalations can dry external mercury.
Next, the embryonic immortal constantly desires to soar, and auspicious light arises in the bedchamber.
Next, in stillness, music is heard at times.
Next, when facing ordinary people—even the wealthy and noble—their bones and vulgar bodies emit a foul stench.
Next, the spirit’s radiance can transform, and one’s bearing becomes as graceful as a jade tree; rare fragrance emanates, suffusing the golden hue.
Next, wherever one goes, divine spirits naturally appear to pay homage, obeying commands as if by one’s own will.
Next, in stillness, gazing outward, purple mist fills the eyes, and golden light envelops the body.
Next, within the body, a fire dragon suddenly flies or a dark crane arises—these are the numinous spirits shedding the mortal bones and transcending the vulgar, called *transcendence*.
Next, after transcendence, colored clouds swirl, auspicious qi abounds, heaven rains rare flowers, dark cranes fly in pairs, rare fragrance scatters, and jade maidens descend to bestow celestial scriptures and purple decrees. Once complete, the attire of an immortal—crown, robes, and all—is fully prepared; the dignity of the regalia, the attendants before and behind, are beyond enumeration. Welcomed and guided, one returns to Penglai, where in the Purple Palace, one pays homage to the True Lord of the Grand Tenuity. After verifying one’s native village, name, and assessing the merit of one’s conduct, one resides in the Three Isles as a *True Person and Immortal*.

Lü Zu said: "Today, I have been specially favored by the venerable teacher, who has revealed the profound principles of the abstruse and the celestial mysteries—far beyond mere clarity of ears and eyes or refinement of spirit. This decrepit body now has a refuge and will not share the fate of the dust and earth."

Yet to know is not necessarily to practice, and to practice is not necessarily to attain. Considering the gravity of life and death and the swift passage of time, though one may grasp the wondrous principles, without cultivation and adherence, one will ultimately fail—no different from one who remains ignorant. I humbly ask: at the moment of transmission and convergence, what is the method of practice? How does one begin? How does one apply effort?

Zhong Zu replied: I possess the *Lingbao Bifa*, comprising ten scrolls and twelve divisions, which contains six essential teachings: first, the *Golden Edicts*; second, the *Jade Scriptures*; third, the *True Origin*; fourth, the *Analogies*; fifth, the *True Instructions*; and sixth, the *Essentials of the Dao*. It encompasses the great Dao, drawing parallels to the Three Clarities. It takes the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang as its model, and the ebb and flow of the sun and moon’s essence as its standard—truly the purport of the Five Immortals and the paradigm of the Three Perfections. I shall select an auspicious day to transmit it to you.

*Commentary on the "Qiaoyao Song" and "Qinyuan Chun" (Scroll Thirty-One)*

**Preface to the *Complete Works of Patriarch Lü’s "Qiaoyao Song" and "Qinyuan Chun" Annotations***

The Dao of Patriarch Lü is that of "dual cultivation of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life)." All his poetic works expound this principle, yet the two chapters—*"Qiaoyao Song"* and *"Qinyuan Chun"*—particularly grasp the essential framework, concise yet luminous, succinct yet comprehensive. They speak more of *ming* and less of *xing*, and later generations have followed this emphasis, thus labeling it the "Southern School." Yet *xing* precedes *ming*; I say that "nurturing *xing* to extend *ming*" is one and the same. Once *xing* is realized, *ming* naturally follows—how can *ming* be realized without first realizing *xing*? The *"Qiaoyao Song"* concludes by revealing the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*, while the *"Qinyuan Chun"* opens with refining the self to await the proper moment—its intent is thus evident. Yet those who annotate the *"Qiaoyao Song"* elaborate on *ming* while neglecting *xing*, and those who annotate the *"Qinyuan Chun"* variously interpret it as pertaining to *xing* or *ming*, much like the saying: "The benevolent see benevolence; the wise see wisdom." In truth, the text encompasses all without omission—one need not exalt one while suppressing the other, nor should one embrace one while discarding the other.

Having surveyed the complete corpus of Daoist texts, I found one commentary on the *"Qiaoyao Song"* and two on the *"Qinyuan Chun"*, and thus compiled them into a single scroll. Compiled by Liu Tishu of Yiling, styled Wuwozi; edited by his son Liu Yincheng, styled Qinghui, and nephew Liu Yuncheng, styled Qingxu; collated by Huang Chengshu of Shaxian, styled Yixingzi.

**Preface to the Annotations on the "Qiaoyao Song"**

The *"Qiaoyao Song"* expounds the great Dao of the union of yin and yang. The Dao originally has no name, yet our patriarch Laozi forcibly named it the Dao. This Dao is the Dao of the "Golden Elixir and Returned Cinnabar." Humans are born endowed with the essence and blood of Heaven and Earth; in infancy, their original essence (*yuanjing*), original qi (*yuanqi*), and original spirit (*yuanshen*) are undivided and wholly pure. As they mature, the four gates—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—lead them astray, and their singular true nature is deeply stained by form, sound, fragrance, flavor, touch, and dharmas. Day after day, year after year, original essence transforms into generative essence, original qi into breath, and original spirit into discursive thought. The original qi disperses, making it difficult to recover primordial purity.

The patriarchs of past ages, moved by compassion, bequeathed teachings and established doctrines, recording in alchemical classics the methods for repair and restoration. When essence is depleted, it is replenished with essence; when qi is depleted, it is replenished with qi; when spirit is depleted, it is replenished with spirit. Thus, when humans decline, they are restored by humans, just as when trees wither, they are revived by earth. Therefore, the method of repair and restoration returns to the root and recovers *ming*. What is recovery? When essence is not leaked, it becomes a deep root; when qi is whole, it becomes a firm stem; when spirit is complete, it achieves wondrous union. If one can preserve these three, they become the lifelong medicine.

Yet in this world, those who are ignorant of the Dao are many, while those who understand it are few. Even among those who know, few grasp it in full. Instead, they become self-important, clinging to their own abilities, discoursing on Heaven and Earth, and setting themselves up as teachers. Such people ruin themselves. Thus, the *"Wuzhen Pian"* states: *"Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire times, it is all in vain. All depends on the power of cultivation; the slightest deviation prevents the elixir from forming."* It also says: *"The true essence of scriptures and songs is expounded, yet the fire times are not committed to writing. To know the oral instructions that reveal the mysterious, you must discuss them in detail with immortals."* And again: *"All things return to their roots; returning to the root and recovering ming ensures longevity. Few comprehend the constancy of returning to the root; reckless actions often invite misfortune."*

Therefore, the patriarchs earnestly exhort later learners: do not be reckless, nor waste time. When a single breath fails to come, regret is too late! It is better to turn back early and seek the oral instructions of an enlightened teacher. Without doubt, accept them directly, and cultivate this matter with a firm foundation. Obtain the medicine, obtain the elixir, temper it for ten months, shed the mortal coil, and undergo spiritual transformation. The ten kinds of elixirs are indispensable—not one can be lacking.

The above are but general remarks, earnestly admonishing the wise to awaken. Having seen Patriarch Lü Chunyang’s *"Qiaoyao Song"*—its meaning profound, its words incisive, encompassing the great Dao of the Golden Elixir, the three vehicles of the great Dharma, and the ten kinds of returned cinnabar—I could not put it aside, sighing without end. Though I have not yet attained the Dao, I do not conceal Heaven’s treasure. Thus, I have taken the oral instructions on the Golden Elixir personally transmitted by our patriarch and annotated the *"Qiaoyao Song"* verse by verse, clarifying its beginning and end. Though my words are shallow and my scholarship crude, the principle remains unblemished. This is not for the wise alone, nor is it beyond the grasp of the unlearned. I place this preface at the start of the scroll—heed it well and be cautious.

In the eighth year of the Zhengtong era, the cyclical year *guihai*, on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, this was inscribed by Qian Daohua, the Master Without Blemish of Jade Peak in Gusu.

*Annotations on the "Qiaoyao Song"*
Composed by Qian Daohua, the Master Without Flaw of Jade Peak in Gusu

A drifting wanderer at the end of Han, in the Tang realm—
Thus the *"Qiaoyao"* defies all measure.
Through the unbounded—vertical and horizontal, inverse and direct—
In stillness, non-action; in motion, form.

The Master’s surname was Lü, given name Yan, style Dongbin, with the Daoist name Pure Yang. His ancestral home was in Yongle Town, Zhaoxian Village, Pucheng County, Hejing Prefecture of the Western Capital (present-day Pucheng County, Pu Prefecture). Born into an official family, he entered the world in the fourteenth year of the Tianbao era of the Tang, on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, at the *si* hour. At twenty, he remained unmarried. After passing the imperial examinations, he encountered the Perfected Lord Zhongli of True Yang, who transmitted to him the great Dao. Having completed his cultivation, he composed this *"Qiaoyao Song"*, declaring himself *"a drifting wanderer at the end of Han, in the Tang realm."*

*"Qiao"* means to deliberate—if one’s conduct is not straightforward, it may be *"qiao-ed."* *"Yao"* refers to the lines of the hexagrams, the principle of yin and yang intermingling, the dynamics of stillness and motion, advance and retreat. The worldly, deluded and ignorant, find it difficult to fathom.

*"Vertical and horizontal, inverse and direct"*—whether proceeding vertically or horizontally, in reverse or forward cultivation, all lies within one’s grasp, freely directed. *"Inverse"* refers to the sevenfold-returned elixir, the later-arising method; *"direct"* denotes the way of obtaining the medicine, the great elixir of dragon and tiger, the earlier-gathering method. *"Unbounded"* means that when one’s refinement is perfected, there is no constraint, nor any carelessness or error.

*"In stillness, non-action"*—when entering samadhi, the inner medicine and inner elixir coalesce as the spirit is stabilized and the mind fixed. All entanglements dissolve; the heart guards the elixir field within, the body like withered wood, the mind like dead ashes. One awaits only the first stirring of yang within the body, the union of heart and kidney, the inner husband and wife, when essence and nature merge as if in the great void. Thus it is said: *"A thousand sages seek his traces in vain—his whole being hides within the great void."* Upon emerging from samadhi, heart and kidney return to their places, and one feels two or three drops of clear spring water descending into the Yellow Court. As the ancients said: *"When yin and yang have consummated their union, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court."*

*"In motion, form"*—this is the principle of yin and yang, inverse and direct. One guards against danger, weighs risks, knows when to advance or retreat, discerns ascent and descent, distinguishes host and guest, ensuring no error in either. Without disturbance in motion, without desiccation in stillness—this is the foremost task in elixir refinement, hence it is stated first.

He drinks wine, he eats meat—
Yet holds fast to rouge and flowers, cutting off lust.
He practices Chan, sings lewd songs of rouge and powder—
While upholding precepts, his belly ever full of wine and meat.

The true cultivator values not the fasting of the mouth, but the fasting of the heart. *"Fasting of the mouth"* means abstaining from wine and meat; *"fasting of the heart"* means cutting off lust. If one’s nature and life are clear, and lust is severed without transgressing the precepts, what need is there to abstain from wine and meat? Thus the Patriarch said: *"He drinks wine, he eats meat."*

Rouge and flowers are the domain of lust—how much more to *"hold fast"* to them! Yet the adept, though beautiful sights may appear before his eyes, remains undisturbed in heart. Moreover, in the refinement of the returned elixir, there is the joy of the union of infant and maiden—how could he still crave the filth of rouge and flowers? Thus the Perfected Master, refining within, forever severs the dust of desire. His pure and tranquil heart abides in desire yet is not desirous, dwells in the world yet is not stained by it. Temporarily resting in the ground of freedom from defilement, he shall realize the body of the Dharma King.

*"Practicing Chan, singing lewd songs of rouge and powder"*—Chan is the practice of purity, while rouge and powder are the words of lust; the two are incompatible. Yet he who practices Chan while singing such songs—scripture says: *"A lotus blooms in fire—how rare! To practice Chan amid desire is equally rare."* Thus the Immortal Master, practicing Chan and singing lewd songs, forgets all appearances. Moreover, he wishes the world to recognize that his resolve is firm, his footing steady. There is no harm in blending with the world’s radiance.

Concealing his actions, silently refining, strictly guarding the root of life, meticulously upholding the precepts of his nature—what need is there to abstain from wine and meat?

Form is medicine, wine is emolument—
Amid wine and form, unbound.
Only through flowers and wine did he awaken to longevity—
Drinking wine, wearing flowers, gods and ghosts weep.

*"Form is medicine"*—within the maiden of sixteen, there lies the treasure of true gold, the medicinal substances of hun and po. *"Wine is emolument"*—destined by past causes, it also aids the flourishing of the Dao. *"Drinking wine all day without intoxication, wearing flowers without losing them"*—thus amid wine and form, there is no constraint.

The Master said: *"Now that I have attained the Dao and become an immortal, it is through flowers and wine that I achieved long life and enduring vision."* By drinking wine and wearing flowers, refining the self and upholding the heart, he committed no error. The six thieves and the three corpses’ ghosts naturally vanished, no longer able to run rampant—hence *"gods and ghosts weep."*

Do not break precepts, do not transgress lust—
Breaking precepts sinks the true suchness of nature.
Transgressing lust destroys the treasure of long life—
Only those who attain it are men of the Dao’s power.

*"Do not break precepts, do not transgress lust"* echoes the earlier *"holding fast to rouge and flowers, cutting off lust."* The foolish and deluded of the world, unaware of refining their own bodies, break precepts and transgress lust. Like a lamp extinguished when its oil is spent, or a man perishing when his marrow is exhausted, many have harmed their bodies and lost their lives. They know only to abstain from killing and stealing, unaware that the true theft and murder occur within—stealing the original yang qi, killing one’s own nature and life. Yet they remain unguarded, sinking into the river of love, their true nature obscured, mired in lust and desire, destroying the treasure of long life—how can they become immortals?

To grasp the method of cultivation, one must rely on the oral instructions of an enlightened master—refining the self, stabilizing the mind, obtaining the medicine, and securing the elixir. Thus attaining long life and enduring vision, the power of the Dao grows firm and strong. Hence it is said: *"Only those who attain it are men of the Dao’s power."*

**Men of the Dao’s power—**
**True idlers—**
*Wine is a fine friend, flowers a companion.*
*Seeking the true man in the willow lanes and flower streets—*
*The true man is but playing in the flower streets.*

Men of the Dao’s power are those who have completed the cycles of elixir-refinement, attained the Dao, and gained its strength—great beings of virtue. *"Wine is a fine friend"* refers to the earth of Kun, the southwest where companions gather, allowing one to drink the immortal wine of no-rice. *"Flowers are companions"* denotes the paired numbers of seven-six, two-seven, nine-two, nine-six—kindred spirits who may join as companions.

Thus, those of great practice enter without hesitation into brothels, taverns, flower streets, and willow chambers, performing the work of refining the self. Hence it is said: *In the willow lanes and flower streets, one may seek the true man.* The true man is indeed found playing in the flower streets.

*Plucking flowers, wearing them, drinking the wine of long life—*
*In the scene of non-action, the Dao naturally flourishes.*
*Let the deluded masses mock and scorn—*
*The immortal flowers and immortal wine are the immortal realm.*

*Plucking flowers, wearing them, drinking the wine of long life*—for the Dao cultivator, having received the master’s oral instructions and begun the work, the furnace must be precisely calibrated in weight and measure, without the slightest error. One must proceed in proper sequence: first, on the third day, the moon emerges at Geng; next, on the eighth day, the moon reaches Ding.

Afterward, on the fifteenth day, the moon reaches Jia. During the work, first use the yang sword to sever the flower’s stem, then with the yin sword drink the wine of long life. One must also know that at the time of the full moon, the water source is clear or turbid, the metal and water arrive in season, and the true man is precisely in position. Plunge into the Yellow Chamber’s earthen crucible, where in the ordinary scene, all entanglements are shed, and one enters non-action—then the true Dao naturally flourishes. The deluded masses of the world, hearing of using the cauldron to refine the great elixir, all mock and slander, deeming it unworthy of pursuit. Thus the immortal master said: *“Let the deluded masses mock and scorn—the immortal flowers and immortal wine are my immortal realm.”* Let the scholar ponder this.

*To this realm, no common guest—*
*Within the joyous cave, boy and girl gather flowers of all seasons,*
*Flower upon flower, the elixir of long life is formed.*

For the Dao cultivator, having gathered the elixir and entered the Central Palace, arriving at this true realm, one is no ordinary worldly guest but truly a seed of immortality. Within the Yellow Chamber, the boy and girl unite in joyous union. One must then temper the fire for ten months, followed by one month of total refinement and one month of spirit emergence—hence the year-long work of the four seasons, *“constantly gathering flowers of all seasons within the cave.”* The internal and external fire-work and qi-cycles must be flawless, so that the embryo of spirit may congeal and transform, called *“flower upon flower, the elixir of long life is formed.”*

*The elixir of long life—pluck the heart of the flower,*
*Layer upon layer, the flower’s pistils bloom in spring splendor.*
*Men do not grasp the principle within the flower—*
*A single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.*

Fearing later students might not understand, the immortal master reiterated emphatically: The elixir of long life must be gathered from the three treasures of the upper crescent within the jade crucible, where jade pistils and golden blossoms unfold in orderly, layered spring radiance. Many in the world blindly cultivate without grasping the principle within the flower, making attainment of the Dao difficult. If by past good fortune one encounters a true master who reveals the celestial mechanism step by step, it is like a pauper gaining treasure, like the sick obtaining medicine, like a prisoner granted pardon, like the dead restored to life—worth more than ten thousand taels of gold. Even if one possessed ten thousand taels, they would eventually be spent, but having obtained this true method, its wondrous use is inexhaustible.

*Give thanks to heaven and earth, feel gratitude for the empty void—*
*To have met the immortal master is to meet one’s ancestors.*
*Whispered in the ear, the profound and wondrous instruction,*
*Raised to the first peak of Penglai.*

After attaining the Dao, the immortal master sighed in gratitude for the protection of yin and yang, heaven and earth, and the empty void, having met the True Yang Emperor Lord, who was like an ancestor. The Emperor Lord whispered in his ear, transmitting heart-to-heart the oral instructions of the golden liquid returning elixir, lifting him to the first peak of Penglai. This refers to the upper crescent crucible, hence the metaphor of the first peak. Let the scholar examine this carefully.

*The first peak is an immortal thing,*
*Where only golden blossoms and jade pistils arise in the indistinct.*
*Mouth to mouth, the transmission leaves no written record—*
*One must possess a firm spiritual root and marrow-bones.*

The first peak refers to the White Tiger of the Dui Palace of the same kind. Within this thing, only golden blossoms and jade pistils are produced, capable of generating the indistinct. The ancestral masters dared not commit it to bamboo and silk, requiring only oral transmission. To attain the Dao, one must also possess marrow-bones of a firm spiritual root, for only then can the great medicine of the golden elixir be accomplished.

*Firm marrow-bones refine the spiritual root,*
*Petal upon petal, peach blossoms in the cave’s spring.*
*Sevens of the White Tiger nurtured in pairs,*
*Eights of the Green Dragon total one catty.*

The lines on firm marrow-bones refer to the great elixir of Dragon and Tiger, the great medicine of the golden elixir, which can refine one’s spiritual root—this is the Green Dragon. The third line refers to the work of refining the self with fire, requiring the exchange of crucibles for refinement, which may be called the spring breeze and fluid essence within the cave of petal-like peach blossoms. The “sevens of the White Tiger” refer to the two-sevens crucible for refining the great elixir. If one obtains eight taels of true gold from the upper crescent White Tiger and half a catty of true mercury from the Green Dragon, the two eights combine to form one catty of the great medicine. The medicine of the eight-eights Green Dragon can also assist the yin path.

*The true parents deliver to the original palace,*
*Wood Mother and Metal Father, their natures inherently gentle.*
*Within the twelve palaces, the toad’s radiance appears,*
*Moment by moment, the earthly soul descends and the celestial soul arrives.*

The true parents refer to the great medicine of the golden elixir, this supreme treasure delivered to one’s original palace. Wood Mother and Metal Father are wood-mercury and metal-lead, their natures harmoniously united. Guarding the Central Palace’s earthen crucible, within the twelve hours, circulate the fire and retreat the tally, likened to the appearance of the toad’s radiance in moonlight. Moment by moment, firm resolve is needed to guard the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit, sublimating them within the cinnabar field, like the union of husband and wife—never to be parted even for an instant. Only then can the sacred embryo congeal, and the Dao be accomplished.

*When lead is first achieved, mercury is first born,*
*Within the jade crucible and golden tripod, not yet refined.*
*One husband and one wife unite with heaven and earth,*
*One boy and one girl join with Qian and Kun.*

“Lead is first achieved” refers to gathering the three true essences of the upper crescent’s moon spirit into one’s cinnabar field, called the initial achievement. To restrain one’s true mercury, the mercury is like the beginning of new life. One must then refine it in the jade crucible and golden tripod, the two qi intermingling, like the union of husband and wife, following the principle of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. The union of male and female, the ordinary proceeding and the sage reversing, aligns with the Dao of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing. Only by not losing this fire-work can the elixir’s head congeal.

*Geng must be born, Jia must be born,*
*When Jia and Geng are born, the Dao begins to sprout.*
*Pluck the root of heaven and the marrow of earth—*
*The white snow and yellow sprout naturally grow.*

To generate *Jia* is to allow the *qi* of *Jia*-Wood’s mercury-fire in the East to give rise to the metal-water of the White Tiger in the West. When *Jia* and *Geng* are born, it is the dragon swallowing the tiger’s blood and the tiger inhaling the dragon’s essence, the two *qi* arising and the sprout first germinating. Day by day it grows, ever new and ever renewing.

The gathering is the turning mechanism of the Dipper’s handle. The "root of heaven" is one’s own single entity, taking the "marrow of earth" from within that other entity. If one achieves this—first gathering, then arising—ascending and descending, warming and nurturing, with fire-work unerring and unlost, then white snow and yellow sprout will naturally grow to maturity, congealing within the cinnabar field, as a man conceives a child.

*Lead must be born, mercury must be born,*
*When mercury and lead are born, they are refined in one place.*
*This is not the union of essence and fluid—*
*It is the essence of heaven and earth, the sun and moon’s true power.*

That lead must be born means the *qi* of true metal at the waxing crescent enters one’s cinnabar field to generate true mercury. When lead and mercury give rise to each other, they are refined together in the earthen crucible. All bones are ordered, and all spirits obey the command. This refining is not the lustful union of desire but the natural process of heaven and earth, the true essence of the sun and moon—a treasure of *qi* without form.

When the Yellow Dame makes a perfect match,
Timing must be exact, the oral transmission passed down.
The eight trigrams and three primals rely entirely on mercury,
The five phases and four images cannot be without lead.

The Yellow Dame is the true earth spirit of *Wu-Ji*, the spleen’s deity, the intent of the two persons. If the two *qi* are harmonious and metal and wood are not estranged, they will swiftly unite in perfect harmony, merging into one, congealing without dissolution. To gather the elixir’s medicine, one must rely on the true master’s oral instructions, the subtle and wondrous timing without error. Only then can accomplishment be achieved; without the true instructions, one will instead incur great harm.

The eight trigrams are *Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Li*, *Kun*, and *Dui*. The three primals are the three vehicles and three mysteries of the Dao. That all relies on mercury means that in refining the fire-work of the self, one must ensure true mercury is without flaw, entirely dependent on mercury’s steadfastness.

The five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth: *Jia*-Dragon in the East, *Bing*-Phoenix in the South, *Geng*-Tiger in the West, *Ren*-Tortoise in the North, and the intent-earth of the Yellow Dame at the center. These four images and five phases are the bodies of self and other, the two *qi* of dragon and tiger, yin and yang, water and fire. Only by seeking the true unity of lead can the great work be accomplished.

*Lead gives rise to mercury, mercury gives rise to lead,*
*Seizing the power of heaven and earth’s transformations.*
*In the profound and obscure, life arises from the indistinct,*
*From the indistinct, a mass congeals.*

That lead gives rise to mercury means using lead to restrain mercury; that mercury gives rise to lead means mercury and lead harmonize. Thus it is said, "Seizing the power of heaven and earth," the transformations of yin and yang, lead and mercury. The profound and obscure are the two entities of yin and yang; life arising from the indistinct is true lead and true mercury, the sun’s spirit and the moon’s essence. From the indistinct, a mass congeals—yin and yang’s two entities, refined and congealed without dissolution. This is the principle of mutual consumption and the fire-work, where the divine elixir of the central palace may congeal into a mass.

*Nature must be empty, intent must be focused,*
*Do not let the monkey and horse wander carelessly.*
*When the flower’s dew first opens, beware of disturbance—*
*Lock it in the earthen crucible, do not withdraw or add.*

That nature must be empty means an empty mind. That intent must be focused means letting go of all concerns, not clinging even to the slightest, tightly guarding the central yellow chamber with single-minded devotion. Do not let the monkey and horse wander carelessly means the cultivator of the Dao must lock the heart-monkey and tether the mind-horse, not allowing them to roam freely.

When the flower’s dew first opens, beware of disturbance means that once the elixir enters the abdomen and true mercury is subdued, it is like the first opening of a flower’s dew—easy to gather but also easy to scatter. One must be vigilant against any disturbance. The practitioner must work diligently, subduing the heart and severing thoughts, without the slightest negligence, guarding life with care, embracing and protecting the cinnabar field until the divine elixir congeals. Thus it is said, "Lock it in the earthen crucible, do not withdraw or add."

In the jade crucible, the civil fire refines,
Within the twelve hours, only guard the One.
At this time, the Yellow Way unites yin and yang,
The three natures return to the original palace without leakage.

In the jade crucible, the civil fire refines refers to the Dao of refining form with jade liquid, nurturing with the civil fire, the moment of the *Ditian Tai* hexagram’s bathing. The cultivator, within the twelve hours, must focus the mind on the One, intent fixed on the cinnabar field. From *zi* to *si*, the six hours of kindling the fire; from *wu* to *hai*, the six hours of withdrawing the tally. Yin and yang unite, water above and fire below. The three natures of metal, water, and fire are preserved as one, gathered into the original palace without leakage. Only then can a man conceive a child, a husband become pregnant.

When *qi* moves, the true fire refines,
Do not let the *xuan*-pearl leave the sacred hall.
Add to the fire-work with caution against danger—
The *ninth of the first* is the hidden dragon, not to be refined.

When *qi* moves, the true fire refines means closing the breath to circulate true *qi* internally, the fire-work of fetal breathing, not allowing the *xuan*-pearl of lead and mercury to wander, lest the congealed elixir scatter again. For when the inner elixir enters the abdomen, it is like clouds and mist. True *qi* circulates within, refined by true fire, the union of heart and kidney, not to be separated even for a moment.

The external crucible’s fire-work, in its withdrawal and addition, must be guarded against danger with utmost care, lest negligence bring harm upon oneself. One seeks to refine the elixir for longevity, but if it is lost at this stage, one will instead shorten life—this must be avoided. At this time, the key is to understand the internal and external fire-work, the sequence of the *Zhun* and *Meng* hexagrams, without error. From *zi* to *si*, the six hours of kindling the yang fire; from *wu* to *hai*, the six hours of withdrawing the yin tally. Thus it is said, "The *ninth of the first* is the hidden dragon, not to be refined"—this is the fire-work of nurturing.

The ebb and flow of fire, the transformation of the *daogui*—
Across the great earth, yellow sprouts grow in abundance.
Within the reckoning of the Five Phases, one yang arises;
The twenty-four *qi* array the feast of pearls.

The adept, knowing only the ebb and flow of internal and external fire-work without the slightest error, first obtains the elixir of the *daogui*, which transforms into yellow sprouts and coalesces into the pearl of the elixir. This occurs within the reckoning of the Five Phases, where the Great One contains the true unity of *qi*, the seed serving as the origin of the elixir. Thereafter, ten months of fire-work are applied, one month for total refinement, and one month for the emergence of spirit. The twenty-four *qi* of the year’s method augment the power of the divine medicine—thus it is said, “The twenty-four *qi* array the feast of pearls.”

When the fire is sufficient and the reckoning complete,
The medicine is then formed—
Soon come the cries of dragons and the roars of tigers.
Of three leads, only one lead is attained;
The golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to manifest their form.

If the adept achieves the full reckoning of internal and external fire-work, the divine elixir coalesces, and within the body, the union of husband and wife naturally gives rise to the cries of dragons and the roars of tigers. Yet in gathering the three grades of the great medicine’s origin, only one lead is truly received and employed—like tasting the flavor of the golden fruit or immortal peach, its transformations and manifestations possess inconceivable spiritual potency. With the fire-work of nurturing unerring, the infant emerges—this is no ordinary birth for a man.

Reinstall the furnace, reestablish the crucible—
Riding the tiger, mounting the dragon, one departs the mortal realm.
As the essence of the sun first appears and the radiance of the moon congeals,
The two eights unite in *ren* and *bing*.

In the method of refining the elixir, if one possesses great root and capacity, having accomplished the great elixir, the elixir is moved into the upper cinnabar field. A wondrous furnace is then set anew, dragon and tiger unite, essence and radiance congeal, and the two bowstrings’ *qi* are realigned, uniting *ren*-water and *bing*-fire. With water and fire in harmony, the marvel of the re-created divine elixir arises. As the *Four Hundred Characters* states: “In a year, a child is born; each one may ride the crane.”

Dragon-mercury coalesces, tiger-lead forms—
A journey of but a foot to Penglai.
The lead of *kun* and the mercury of *qian* are the ancestors of the golden elixir;
Dragon-lead and tiger-mercury are most spiritually efficacious.

In the initial refinement of the golden liquid’s returning elixir, dragon-mercury and tiger-lead are essential as the ancestral foundation of the elixir. In the fire-work of nurturing, dragon-lead and tiger-mercury are likewise required—this is the method of gathering what was previously received, most crucial for the spiritually efficacious fire-timing. The scholar should seek a true teacher and not squander a lifetime in vain.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
Fifteen for gold’s reckoning,
Water’s number is the same.
Before the furnace, fix the weights—
Five parts water, with some to spare.
These two are taken as true,
Gold’s weight as in the beginning.
The second is thus excluded,
Fire and two accompany it.
The three substances contain and receive one another,
Their transformations like spirits in form.

Grasp this principle, and the Dao is then accomplished—
Thirty thousand divine dragons guard the crystal.
The timing is set, the days and hours clear;
Devotion lies solely in intent and reverence.

If one of great cultivation comprehends the principle of the golden liquid’s great returning elixir and the method of immortals begetting immortals, the Dao may be fully realized. The crucible is reestablished, with gold as the embankment—thus it is said, “Thirty thousand divine dragons guard the crystal.” One must also clarify the timing, focus the mind in vigilant attendance, and understand the principle of gold generating fifteen ounces of water. The fourteenth chapter of the *Cantong Qi* is most explicit; knowing this is the detailed Dao of “drinking the *daogui*.”

When black lead has passed and pure truth is gathered,
A single clash settles great peace.
The three vehicles transport treasures of pearls,
Delivering them to the precious treasury, naturally spiritually efficacious.

If one knows the fifteen ounces of gold and how much water it generates, the true principle must be understood. When the black lead has passed and the water’s source is utterly pure, within it true gold generates two parts water—this alone is truly usable. By method, it is gathered, and the bellows and furnace are securely sealed. The clash must settle into great peace, and the three vehicles of the three grades of the great elixir are employed to transport it into the central palace’s treasury. The ten thousand spirits obey commands, and without being spirit, it naturally responds as spirit.

Heavenly spirits protect, earthly deities welcome—
The union of *qian* and *kun*, the essence of sun and moon.
At the tiger’s roar, the dragon emerges from its cave;
Phoenixes fly and phoenixes dance, issuing from the golden city.

Heavenly spirits protect, for my true mercury seeks true lead. Earthly deities welcome, for their true lead seeks my true mercury. Only when the two intentions harmonize can yin and yang unite in fusion. One must know the moment when the tiger’s roar signals the arrival of true lead, swiftly commanding the azure dragon to emerge from its cave, wielding the flying spirit-sword to gather it. The *qi* of phoenixes enters my earthen crucible within the golden city to form the elixir.

Cinnabar matches, mercury settles—
A cascade of red radiance arrays the Great Clarity.
Along the pool, golden light bursts forth;
Mercury-fire flows crimson into the imperial capital.

Cinnabar matches: within the human body, accumulated essence transforms into mercury, and when mercury endures and solidifies, it becomes cinnabar, which pairs with true lead to form the origin of the elixir. Mercury settles: the mercury of the lower bowstring, eight ounces evenly balanced, completes the pound of the great medicine. Thereafter, the transformations within the body resemble red radiance rising on all sides, arrayed within the Great Clarity. Then, the true lead of the furnace-fire reverses its flow, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, like golden light enveloping the body. Mercury-fire flows as pearls, descending into the golden chamber and yellow room, entering the imperial capital.

Dragon and tiger unite, externally maintaining fullness—
The saintly walks, the spirit flies within the precious vase.
In a single hour, the golden elixir is accomplished;
Ascending to the golden gate, purple clouds arise.

That tiger and this dragon, the *qi* of the two bowstrings, unite in the fusion of water and fire, contending and maintaining fullness. The transformations of spiritual potency, the saintly walking and the spirit flying, occur within the body’s precious vase. In a single hour, the origin of the elixir coalesces above, ascending to the golden gate of the Mud Pill Palace and the purple court, where true *qi* is reborn, circulating throughout the body without obstruction.

The immortal peach ripens—pluck and partake,
As the myriad transformations pay homage, heaven and earth rejoice.
With fasting and vigil, await the birth of the solitary Yang;
Then advance to circulate the Zhou Tian, aligning with the *Can Tong* principle.

When the immortal peach ripens, the nine-six cycle of the *xuan* pass is complete, the moment when metal gives birth to water and clarity arises—this is the peach’s ripening. It is time to act, to enter the chamber and apply effort to gather it, placing it within the earthen crucible. The myriad transformations pay homage, the body’s alchemy naturally unites, like husband and wife in joyous union. If one seeks this treasure, one must first establish an altar, purify the mind, and maintain fasting and vigil. As the solitary Yang is about to arise, metal births radiant water; when its source becomes utterly clear, seize the moment to act, advancing to align with the *Can Tong* principle. Within a single hour, the golden elixir is assured—once attained, it is eternally possessed.

Align with the *Can Tong* principle to refine the golden elixir;
Water and fire steam through the hundred passes.
Nurturing the embryo for ten months, the divine elixir coalesces—
How could a man’s pregnancy be a trivial matter?

To *align* (*can*) is to match the body of heaven and earth’s transformations, the pivotal moment when the two—lead and mercury, the *qi* of self and other—resonate. To *unite* (*tong*) is to employ the mutual completion of like kinds, merging the workings of Yin and Yang’s alchemy. Only by deeply understanding this principle can one grasp the workings of refining the golden elixir. Rising and falling through the *Tun* and *Meng* hexagrams, water and fire steam through the hundred bones, opening the hundred passes. Nurturing with inner and outer fire, after ten months the embryo is complete and *qi* is full—thus a man gives birth to a child, a husband becomes pregnant. How could this be a trivial matter?

The inner elixir is accomplished, the outer elixir is achieved;
Within and without connect, harmonizing in joyous union.
Together they form a single purple-golden pill—
Transforming and soaring, enduring as heaven and earth.

The inner elixir’s accomplishment lies in the central palace’s earthen crucible, where the divine elixir is nurtured. The outer elixir’s achievement comes from obtaining the externally derived golden elixir, the two merging to form a single cinnabar-red golden pill. With the fire’s work connecting them, harmonizing and uniting, the sacred embryo takes shape, the infant manifests. Transforming and soaring, enduring through heaven and earth’s ages, one becomes a true person.

The elixir entering the abdomen is no ordinary matter—
The Yin form is stripped away, transmuting into pure Yang.
Ascending in flight, transcending as a guest of the Three Clarities,
With name fulfilled and merit complete, one reaches the heavens above.

Through deep cultivation, the elixir enters the abdomen, uniting within and without, unlike the common world. Day by day, the Yin form is stripped away, transmuting into a body of pure Yang. Ascending in flight, transcending, one becomes a guest of the Three Clarities. Only when merit is complete and the Dao is perfected does one’s name reach the heavens above.

A guest of the Three Clarities, riding the jade tones of the phoenix chariot,
Together they mount the phoenix, soaring into the Great Void.
Such carefree joy and bliss—
Roaming the three realms, most pure and wondrous.
Above the Great Void, the perfected cultivator,
Bright and complete, without a single thing.

The guest of the Three Clarities refers to one who has accomplished the golden fluid’s great return elixir and perfected the Dao. Riding the phoenix chariot of jade tones, they enter the Great Void and the celestial rivers, roaming the three realms in carefree ease. This is the perfected cultivator, bright and complete in the great Dao, without a single thing to encumber them.

Without a single thing, only the Dao manifests—
From the five directions emerges the true person’s visage.
Immortal boys and girls welcome with colored clouds,
In the Palace of Five Lights, the true decree is transmitted.

Without a single thing means the perfected one has emptied all entanglements. Unattached to phenomena, only the eternal Dao is clearly manifest. The true *qi* of the five viscera, each revealing its original color, emerges from the five directions as the true person’s visage. At this stage, with merit complete and the Dao perfected, the infant appears, a body beyond the body. Immortal boys and girls welcome them to the Penglai Three Isles, to the Palace of Five Lights, where the true official decree is transmitted, and their name is recorded in the immortal register.

"Voice-hearers" are those who learn by hearing the Dharma from a teacher and attain awakening; "Pratyekabuddhas," also called "solitary awakened ones," are those who awaken to the twelve nidānas and attain the Dao—these are the two vehicles. The true decree is transmitted, speaking of profound matters—
It is merely the true lead refining mercury’s essence.
Voice-hearers and Pratyekabuddhas dissolve like frost;
External paths and asuras recoil in shock.

After attaining the Dao and receiving the true decree, one transmits the daily practices and methods of cultivation. The Dao of the true one speaks of the profound matters of refining lead and mercury. If voice-hearers and Pratyekabuddhas hear this, they dissolve like frost; external paths and asuras, upon learning of the dual cultivation of man and woman, recoil in shock. Thus it is called the hard-to-believe Dharma.

Touching dry bones, they instantly take form—
Trusting the Dao, the ladder to heaven is as level as one’s palm.
The nine generations of ancestors attain liberation—
Who would envy the fleeting glory of wealth and honor?

One who can cultivate the true Dao, firmly establishing the foundation, obtaining the medicine and the elixir, is like touching dry bones and instantly restoring their form, becoming an immortal of eternal life. Thus one trusts the sagely Dao. The three-inch ladder to heaven is possessed by all, present before one’s eyes, as level as the palm of one’s hand. After attaining the Dao, the nine generations of ancestors all achieve liberation. As for the world’s wealth and honor, they are but morning dew—who would envy them?

Seek the resolute, find the worthy—
Together they stabilize the furnace and crucible, transforming the mortal embryo.
If one is stingy with wealth or hoards treasures,
Ten thousand immortals will refuse to come.

The ancient immortals, cultivating and refining, received the true oral instructions and authentic methods from their teachers. They required both wealth and Dharma to succeed. If one lacks resources, one must wander the four seas, seeking true and resolute individuals, wise and worthy talents. Mutual trust and alliance, swearing oaths before heaven and earth, they stabilize the furnace and crucible together, obtaining the medicine and the elixir, mutually accomplishing the work. This is the other providing wealth while I provide the Dharma—wealth and Dharma equally offered, without distinction.

If one is greedy for wealth, stingy with treasures, and miserly,
Even the highest immortals and transcendent beings will refuse to depend on or join them—hence it is said, *"Ten thousand immortals will refuse to come."*

The cultivator of truth does not speak carelessly—
For every careless word, Heaven will deduct ten thousand kalpas of dust-like eons,
The Way remains unfulfilled,
And from the seven orifices, blood will gush forth.

The immortal masters, moved by deep compassion,
Fearing that worldly minds remain deluded and unwilling to believe or practice,
Utter this solemn vow to earnestly exhort later learners:
*"I am a cultivator of truth, unlike the common and vulgar,
I dare not speak even a single word falsely to deceive the world.
If I utter even one careless word to mislead later generations,
I shall incur Heaven’s punishment—
Ten thousand kalpas of dust-like eons without attaining the Way,
Afflicted with grave illness, blood gushing from the seven orifices."*
The immortal masters make this solemn vow, so fervent is their desire to deliver others!
How can learners not take heed!

The impoverished adept makes a resolute vow—
Determined to lift and guide all worldly beings,
To join together in the immortal assembly of Penglai,
Where the torments of the mortal realm never cease.

The immortal masters, calling themselves "impoverished adepts,"
Make their vows with utmost sincerity,
Resolved to raise and lead all ordinary folk,
To enter the path of eternal life,
To gather in the immortal assembly of Penglai,
And become the seed of immortality.
Yet if one does not believe, sinking into the river of desire,
Drifting into the sea of craving,
Trapped in the cycle of rebirth,
Within the mortal realm’s fiery pit,
Enduring ceaseless torment.

The worldly life is brief—ponder this well—
While within the cave’s realm, heaven and earth endure, sun and moon stretch long.
With steadfast resolve and苦心, in three to five years,
Across a hundred thousand myriad kalpas, life knows no bounds.

Worldly beings, failing to attain the true Way,
Live scarcely a hundred years, and even seventy is rare.
All must inevitably face death.
Knowing life is short, they yet willingly await death,
Refusing to turn toward the Way.
But if, in the quiet of dawn’s pillow,
One reflects alone—
That the ancient immortals and all buddhas were once human, too,
And through cultivation achieved transcendence—
Then one should swiftly take up the task,
Seek the oral instructions of an enlightened master,
And practice the immortal method of long life and deathlessness.
Following the master’s guidance,
With unwavering resolve and苦心,
One refines the great returning elixir of golden fluid.
When merit is complete and the Way perfected,
One becomes an immortal,
And across a hundred thousand myriad kalpas,
Life endures as boundlessly as heaven and earth.

When the sacred Way is realized and true constancy revealed,
Tigers and rhinos, blades and weapons can no longer harm,
Water and fire, dragons and serpents bring no injury—
Clapping hands in the celestial palace, one laughs with joy.

These practices are truly wondrous—
Yet when entrusted to others, who would accept them?
Foolish disciples cling to desire and wealth in death,
So immortals refuse to bestow their light.

The true and ultimate Way does not discriminate—
How could it favor high or low, rich or poor?
Even princes and nobles, if they seek the Way,
Must first shed worldly splendor, temper their sharp edges,
And sever the tangle of distractions.

If anger remains unremoved and pride unchanged,
One falls into the sea of birth and death, trapped in the wheel of rebirth.
Though gold and jade pile mountain-high,
They are but worldly treasures, destined to fade—
Not the eternal treasure of long life.
Immortals regard them with cold laughter, unworthy of notice.

Fame is not true nobility—only the Way is supreme.
From sage to sage, from worthy to worthy, the lineage endures,
While those who wear gold at their waists, ride proud steeds,
Are but fleeting as dust in a sunlit crack.

Dust in a crack, sparks from stone—
Why fix the heart on such fleeting things?
Yet they endure in bitter torment, unmoved by calls to return,
Striving for profit and fame like a boiling cauldron.

Stone-sparks—like the fire struck from stone, the human body is not meant to last. Yet the common folk, lost in delusion, drown daily in the turbid flow of worldly toil. From dawn to dusk, their karmic consciousness drifts in boundless confusion, the Eight Sufferings searing them without end. Thus do the Immortal Masters, through countless scriptures and discourses, urge cultivation. But worldly beings, burdened by heavy karma and deep transgressions, refuse to turn back. They vie for profit and fame like a boiling cauldron, willingly enduring torment—truly, they are the walking dead.

Like a seething cauldron, they sink forever,
Lost in the Way, deluded by truth, their karma rooted deep.
Yet if one levels the thorns in the heart,
The celestial mechanism may then be revealed.

Worldly folk cling to the snares of the mundane, rushing to and fro like a bubbling pot, never at rest. Thus they lose the Way and stray from truth, drowning in the sea of karma. This is the retribution of past lives and present sins—so deep are the roots of their transgressions that returning to primordial truth becomes impossible! Only those with the bones of immortals and the affinity for the Dao, upon hearing the teaching, awaken at once. They level the brambles in their hearts, steel their resolve, and vow unwaveringly to attain the Way, never wavering or regretting. To such as these, the celestial mechanism of creation is revealed in full, the subtle oral instructions carefully transmitted, that they may cultivate and realize the fruit of celestial immortality, resolving the great matter of life and death.

The mandate must be transmitted; the nature must be awakened—
Entry into sagehood, transcendence of the mundane, lies in your own hands.
Few tread the path to the Three Pure Ones,
While many jostle at the gates of the beastly realms.

The Immortal Masters solemnly clarify the great matter of the life-foundation—this is no trifling affair. One must steel the heart, make a blood-oath, and pledge before the highest sages and worthies, devoting the heart and swearing to heaven before transmission. Thus, the mandate must be passed by a master. The nature must be awakened: the teaching directs one to directly investigate the original source, truly contemplate and verify, clearly perceive one’s own nature, and radiate light through the body. Thus, the nature must be awakened by oneself. Only through the dual cultivation of nature and life can one succeed, entering sagehood and transcending the mundane—all through one’s own cultivation and realization. Yet alas, worldly folk refuse to believe and accept, turning away from cultivation. They cling only to the seven emotions and desires of the world, willingly falling into the ranks of the beastly, unable to escape. Hence it is said: *Few tread the path to the Three Pure Ones, while many jostle at the gates of the beastly realms.*

To the worthy and good, heed this warning—
Do not yearn for worldly ties.
The mechanism of nature and life must be guarded well.
If either is lacking, no fragrance will bloom;
Clinging to the waves of worldly dust, you will lose the path.

The Patriarchs repeatedly exhort the worthy and virtuous: do not long for worldly ties—love for wife and children, greed for profit and fame. Only the mechanism of nature and life is worth guarding; do not neglect or doubt it. You must cherish life and seek liberation from the suffering of birth and death. If you cultivate only one and neglect the other, it is like a withered branch—no fragrance will bloom, no flower or fruit will form. Clinging to the waves of worldly dust, you will lose the true gate of the great Way.

To cultivate nature alone, not life—
This is the foremost illness in cultivation.
To cultivate only the ancestral nature, not the elixir—
For ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit will struggle to enter sagehood.

The Immortal Elders, in their compassion for later learners who take the wrong path, do not know the true Way. They cling to emptiness and non-action, abandoning wives and children, retreating to the mountains to cultivate, sitting in stillness until the heart turns to ash, blindly practicing without insight—mistaking this for seated meditation. Such foolish ones suffer from the foremost illness in cultivation. The poison runs deep; even the finest physicians and miraculous medicines cannot save them, and they are fated to die. Like those iron-spined Arhats who reach the Pratyeka-buddha stage, attaining a thousand years of samadhi, they may project a yin spirit but cannot enter sagehood! Without cultivating the golden elixir, the true Way cannot be achieved.

According to the Buddhist sutras, the first fruit, Srotāpanna, is called the "Stream-Enterer," having already entered sagehood. By the fourth fruit, Arhat, they are said to fly and transform, abiding in longevity, moving heaven and earth. The Pratyeka-buddha vehicle surpasses the Arhat, though it is slightly inferior to the Bodhisattva vehicle—entering the realm of sages but not yet perfected. As for those who fully awaken to the principle of true emptiness and the nature of the heart, life is encompassed within it, and they are called the Greatly Awakened Golden Immortals. Thus did the Perfected Zhang Ziyang say: *"I have attained the secret not transmitted by Bodhidharma or the Sixth Patriarch."* Therefore, Lord Fu You expounded the *Eight Grades* and *Three Grades* sutras, profoundly illuminating the principle of the unity of the Three Teachings. Yet he feared that worldly folk would only know how to cultivate nature and not life, failing to reach the stage of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to attain life. Hence, he earnestly warned them. If one entirely denounces the Buddhist Dharma, knowing only how to cultivate nature and not life, how does this align with the verse Lord Fu You presented after his awakening at the encounter with Huanglong: *"Ever since I met Huanglong, I realized my past efforts were misdirected"*? Later learners must not misunderstand this!

To master the life-school but neglect the ancestral nature—
Like a mirror stand without a precious mirror.
To live as long as heaven and earth, yet remain a fool—
Holding the reins of family wealth without true control.

Some learn the oral instructions of the life-foundation from the Immortal Masters, clinging to partial views. They cultivate the life-foundation firmly but do not awaken the ancestral nature, failing to see their original face. This is like having a mirror stand without a bright mirror. They do not know the wisdom of the nature-school, the way of transformation, transcendence, spiritual projection, and samadhi. Though they may live long, they lack wisdom—like a fool in the world who possesses a fortune of ten thousand gold but has no mastery over its wondrous use.

When nature and life are dually cultivated, steadfast and true—
Riding the Dharma-boat across the vast waves of the ocean’s depths,
Seizing the dragon’s head alive and whole—
Only then will you know the master craftsman’s skill is no empty boast.

The cultivator, having thoroughly investigated and awakened to the nature, refines the inner medicine, resolves the root of life, gathers the elixir’s essence, harmonizes and nurtures it. The inner and outer fires are flawless, without deficiency, danger, negligence, or loss.

Thus in dual cultivation, morning and evening alternate—*zhun* and *meng*—advancing and gathering, twofold in function, truly steadfast and true. Just as riding the Dharma-boat across the vast waves of the ocean’s depths, one transcends the three disasters and eight difficulties, the nine perils and five sufferings, seizing alive the green dragon’s head within the sea. Only in this true realm does one realize that the ancient master craftsman’s skill was no empty boast, no false semblance, nor devoid of true efficacy. Even if one were to grind one’s bones to powder and shatter one’s body, it would be difficult to repay the profound grace of the ancestral masters. Later learners should heed this well and not squander their time in vain.

*Qin Yuan Chun* Annotations
By Zixu Liaozhenzi Xiao Tingzhi Yuanrui

The Sevenfold Return Elixir.
Fire’s generating number is two, its completing number seven.
*Return* means ascending from below; *revert* means descending from above.
Some say: wood is three, metal four, their sum seven—hence "sevenfold return," a fine interpretation.
For metal and wood are the parents of water and fire, the ancestral roots of the Five Phases, the foundation of the reverted elixir.
To take "tears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and marrow" as the sevenfold return is a grave error!
Master Yunfang’s verse says:
*"Seven yin substances all in vain—
If these you take as elixir-seed,
How then ascend to Jade Capital’s domain?"*
The *Purple Court Classic* states: *"What use are seven yin things?"*

The reverted elixir has many names: Great Elixir, Inner Elixir, King’s Flask Elixir, Crimson Snow Elixir, Radiant Cinnabar Elixir, Dragon-Tiger Great Medicine, Ninefold Divine Elixir, Sovereign of the Cosmos, Divine Talisman White Snow, Tortoise Essence Phoenix Marrow, Hare Marrow Raven Liver, Primordial Essence—yet all are but the conjoining of true lead and true mercury, never mere common lead or mercury, nor mineral, herb, or any substance with form.
Mercury is ninefold true mercury; lead is sevenfold true lead.
Only these two are the true qi of Heaven and Earth, the purest essence of sun and moon.
Externally, they mirror the images of Qian and Kun; internally, they align with the workings of creation.
They give life and take it, become tiger and dragon, embodying profound meaning as they act as husband and wife, continuing the ancestral line as father and son.
Once these two flavors are understood, their dual natures must be known:
Through the matchmaker, male and female harmonize; through the mother, descendants grow.
The sages’ utmost secret—steadfast and true—
For elixir-cultivators, one must seek it within oneself alone!

First, one must refine the self and await the proper time.
The Dao is not far from man—common folk use it daily yet remain unaware!
Refining the self is the way of refining form: splitting open the primordial chaos, cleaving the vast obscurity, gathering the essence of the true one, embracing the primordial qi to lay the foundation of the elixir.
One cannot force transformation with unsuitable elements, as the *Cantong Qi* states:
*"Swallows do not birth phoenixes,
Foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Kindred types yield results with ease;
Unrelated kinds defy all art."*
The Master of Golden Flower Grotto replied to the Mount Taishi adept:
*"Accumulate the yang soul, dissolve the yin soul,
With yang soldiers drive back yin bandits.
The eight trigrams intermingle, the Five Phases clash,
Return to the root and restore life—
The elixir blazes forth as essence refines form.
Not mere cinnabar or stone—
Some mistake refining the self for refining earth."*
His words are also fine, for the medicine arises in the southwest, the Kun earth.

The crucial point is knowing the time—if the moment is lost, by what seasonal sign does Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things? By what means does the qi of yin and yang give birth to dragon and tiger?
Between the waxing and waning of the moon lies the creative power of the timely moment; at the union of Kan and Li lies the work of the instant.
In this subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction.
When the first true yang stirs, the midnight hour lingers long.
*"The cosmos rests in your hand,
The ten thousand things arise within your body."*
The Master of Piling said: *"To refine the elixir, seek not winter’s advent—
Within the body, the first yang stirs of itself."*
Within the timely moment lies the work of the hour; within the instant lies the work of the moment.
The lead cauldron glows warmly, its light piercing the curtain.
The cauldron is the crucible of creation’s lead; *warmly* means the fire must not falter—only through gentle nurturing does the elixir form.
As the Master of Piling said: *"Keep the golden crucible ever warm with broth,
Let not the jade furnace grow cold with fire’s neglect."*
The curtain is the eyes—Master Yunfang has the line: *"Close the door, lower the blind, silently observe."*
Where the work is applied, the divine radiance shines brilliantly, penetrating the curtain.

Creation’s forces contend, dragon and tiger unite.
When creation’s forces contend, the dragon’s cry summons clouds, the tiger’s roar stirs wind.
One must make the water-tiger seize the fire-dragon, so they may unite.
The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says:
*"Lead-dragon ascends, mercury-tiger descends—
Drive the two, let them not escape."*
If the fire is applied untimely, tiger and dragon fail to unite, lead and mercury scatter and flee.
Master Ziyang’s verse says:
*"The white tiger of Western Mountain rages wild,
The green dragon of Eastern Sea defies all bounds—
Seize them with both hands, make them still,
And fuse them into a lump of purple frost."*
Seizing them with both hands means only to ensure their union, that they may congeal into treasure.

Advancing the fire’s work at the Cowherd and Weaving Maid.
Fire is the true essence of the Great Yang—it has a name but no form.
Thus the *Cantong Qi* states: *"Having obtained true lead, true fire is still elusive—
How lightly can one speak of it?"*
Why does fire arise within water?
Kan belongs to water, yet within Kan lies true yang—this is true fire.
When dragon and tiger unite, metal and wood merge, then true fire blazes at their center.

The work of advancing the fire involves methods of hardness and softness, civil and martial, with precise measures and standards. At the double-eight threshold, the six-one seal ensures stabilization. Following the hexagrams and lines, tracing the clepsydra’s flow, resolving *Zhun* and *Meng*, discerning *Pi* and *Tai*, distinguishing the two crescents, discerning the new and full moons—from *Fu*’s beginning to *Kun*’s end, from dawn’s rise to dusk’s cessation—thus do yin and yang unfold and retract, metal and water harmonize.

Should the fire’s timing falter, with unseasonable rains or droughts, scorching heat in deep winter, or bitter frost in midsummer, the Metal Palace will see cinnabar and mercury fall into discord. Within the crucible, locusts swarm; the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon seethe; the Kan man and Li woman flee. All this arises from misapplied fire, causing the numinous mercury to scatter. As it is said: *"The slightest deviation invites regret and loss; a hair’s breadth of error prevents the elixir’s formation."* How can one not be cautious?

The Cowherd and Weaving Maid at the *Wei* position mark the time for this work. By the Winding River’s banks, one sees the moon’s radiance, flawless and bright, with a crow in flight. The human small intestine, coiled nine times in twelve bends, is called the Winding River. The moon governs the medicine’s function—its flawless purity marks it as the supreme treasure. The crow in flight signifies yin containing yang.

Liu Haichan’s verse says:
*"How often has the crow alighted in the osmanthus bough?"*
And again:
*"Crow flies, hare stirs not."*
An ancient poem reads:
*"A crow flies into the hare’s palace."*
All express this same meaning.

At that moment, one drinks the *daogui* of one’s own making.

When proceeding with the work of union, one begins by gathering from the earthen crucible and drinking it. Thus *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *"Drink the* daogui*, recognize the earthen crucible—only then may one speak of the* daogui*'s subtleties."* And who would believe that a child is nurtured from nothingness? The Way of Returning Elixir is none other than generating being from non-being, gradually gathering and refining until the sacred embryo is formed—transforming the insubstantial into substance, nurturing the infant to completion. Master Zi Qing’s verse says:
*"How many times the world has made men laugh—
A man, too, may conceive a child.
When one’s own essence and blood unite in congress,
The husband and wife within the body—how wondrous!"*

Discern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source. *The Scripture of Purity* states: *"Heaven is clear, earth is turbid; man is clear, woman is turbid. Clarity is the source of turbidity."* There is no other reason: yang is clear, yin is turbid. The light and clear floats above—this is true mercury; the heavy and turbid sinks below—this is true lead. A single thing with two uses—how could one not distinguish clearly the Way of clarity and turbidity, ascent and descent?

Wood and metal are separated by distance. Wood resides in the east, in the positions of *jia* and *yi*; in form, it is the Azure Dragon; in the hexagrams, it is *Zhen*, the eldest son of *Qian*, mother of fire, wife of metal, the maiden in blue, the green-eyed one, the Azure Dragon of the Eastern Sea, the sap of wood. Metal resides in the west, in the positions of *geng* and *xin*; in form, it is the White Tiger; in the hexagrams, it is *Dui*, the youngest daughter of *Kun*, mother of water, husband of wood, the youth in white, the white-haired elder, the White Tiger of the Western Mountains, the essence of metal. Separated by the positions of *mao* and *you*, they have no means of meeting—only by entrusting the Yellow Dame as matchmaker may they become one. Master Zi Yang said: *"Wood and metal are separated, with no cause to meet—
They must rely on a go-between to draw them together."*
Only then does wood generate fire, metal generate water, and water and fire share the same abode—thus metal and wood unite! Without a teacher’s guidance, this matter is difficult to know.

The great medicine of the Golden Elixir has been transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. The *Sacred Writ of Jade Casket* has led eight or nine out of ten scholars astray. The oral instructions of sagely teachers have been passed down heart to heart through the ages. Without heart-to-heart transmission and oral teaching, even with the talents of the Three Heroes or the wisdom of the Ten Sages, no amount of conjecture will enable one to proceed and form the sacred embryo. As the saying goes:
*"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a bright teacher, do not guess in vain.
For the Golden Elixir has no oral formula—
Where then shall you form the numinous embryo?"*
Liu Haichan’s verse says:
*"This Way is manifest—
Why then do you recklessly speculate?"*

The Way of the Golden Elixir is truly difficult to know without encountering a true teacher. The essentials of the Dao are subtle, the celestial mechanisms profound. *"The Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth;
The Great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon;
The Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad things.
I know not its name—perforce I call it the Dao."*

*"Vast and obscure, within it there is feeling;
Vague and indistinct, within it there is substance.
Invisible when seen, inaudible when heard,
Untouchable when grasped—
From nothingness it generates being.
The celestial mechanisms are profound,
The mysteries unfathomable."*

*The Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: *"Heaven has five thieves—those who see them prosper.
Those who know and cultivate them are called sages!"*
Unless one thoroughly understands yin and yang and deeply penetrates the workings of creation, how can one cleave open primordial chaos, gather the root of heaven and earth as parents, and lay the foundation for the great elixir? Split asunder the vast expanse, take the pure essence of yin and yang as the foundation of the great Dao, assemble the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images. Gather the Three Flowers atop the head, so that the single qi does not darken; direct the Five Qi to return to the origin, so that the yang soul does not scatter. Roam freely in the boundless obscurity, come and go within the indistinct and vague, move and transport, shift the spirit to the yang abode. When the work is complete and conduct perfected, one attains the rank of celestial immortal.

Moreover, the Way of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir has but one gate—how could it be mentioned in the same breath as lesser side methods? Begin swiftly, for even now it is too late. Of the thousand scriptures and ten thousand treatises, none speak of the initial work of proceeding—only oral instructions transmit it. At the outset, one moves the bellows and keys of qian and kun, gathers the *daogui* of kan and li, and gathers the spirit of the entire body into the Heavenly Valley. There, one nurtures it, so that spirit and qi return to their root—this is called *"returning wind to merge, tightly securing the root."* This is the Way of guarding the True One. *The Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says: *"The spirit chamber’s upper and lower crucibles—
Transformation lies in your hands."*
Thus the Perfected of the Orthodox One discoursed on the sword of the green snake, and the Old Man of Western Shu attained the subtleties of the golden hammer.

Lü Dongbin called it the "fire staff," while Kongtong of Qingcheng said the sword is not the Dao. These all exhaust traces and signs, dissecting without foundation. Without the initial work of proceeding, mere discourse on the Golden Elixir will never succeed! An ancient song says: *"The sage discerns the intent of Creation’s work— / Hands grasp sun and moon, placing them in the furnace."* *The Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: *"The cosmos lies within your hands, / The myriad things are born within your body!"*

To study without encountering a true master is to meet no one; to meet one without diligence is to remain a lesser ghost. Laozi said: *"The superior person, hearing the Dao, practices it with diligence— / The immortal’s path can only be cultivated by humans."* An ancient saying goes: *"Immortals are but mortals made."* Know that the wheel of rebirth turns swiftly, and karmic retribution is inescapable. Wealth and honor are but fleeting schemes. Proceed with haste—even now it is too late.

The path to Penglai relies on the fulfillment of three thousand deeds, then one strides upon the clouds to return. The three isles of Penglai are the immortal mountains upon the sea. Within the human body, too, there are three isles of Penglai: the crown is the Upper Isle, the heart the Middle Isle, and the kidneys the Lower Isle. Master Zi Qing’s poem says: *"Within the human body lies a Penglai of its own."* The three thousand deeds are the count of *"nine years embracing the One."* When the nine years of work are complete, some may divide their form and scatter their shadow, or move between existence and non-existence; some may ascend in lightness to wander afar, hidden or revealed at will; some may exchange their bones to become immortals, roaming the isles of Penglai; some may be summoned by the Supreme Unity to dwell in the Central Continent—each according to the depth of their merit and conduct.

*The Kiln’s Unfired Song* says:
*"When nine years of work are fully passed,
The form remains in the world, unaware of spring.
Suddenly the Heavenly Gate shatters at the crown—
A true person emerges with great spiritual power,
And immortals come to offer their congratulations."*

*The Seal of the Unity of the Three* states:
*"When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected,
One conceals oneself to await the time.
The Supreme Unity then summons,
Relocating one to the Central Continent.
When merit is complete, one ascends,
Receiving the register and the chart."*

Master Peng’s commentary says:
*"The Supreme Unity True Lord is the overseer of inner refinement.
When mortals first attain the Dao, their names are engraved on golden tablets,
And in this continent, they receive the register and chart,
Thus gaining ascension."*

*Linwu Shanren Quanyangzi Yu’s commentary on "Spring in Qin Garden"*

The Sevenfold Return Elixir.
Seven is the number of fire. In the method of elixir refinement, one first casts the red into the black to generate the medicine. Once the medicine is obtained, fire is then applied to refine the black into red, thereby forming the elixir—hence the name "Sevenfold Return Elixir." This does not refer to the seven hours from *yin* to *shen*. As Zhang Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"The Metal Duke is originally the son of the Eastern House,
Sent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and take form.
Recognize and call him home to nurture in your dwelling,
Pair him with the Maiden of Cinnabar to forge kinship."*

This is the meaning. For the practitioner, one must first refine the self and await the proper time. The *Li Sao: Yuan You* says:
*"Do not disturb your soul with clamor,
For it will naturally align.
The singular qi is most numinous—
Preserve it in the midst of night.
Be empty to await it,
Before all action."*

This is what it means to refine the self and await the time. The key lies in withdrawing the gaze and returning the hearing, remaining utterly still, concentrating the spirit in the Great Void, without a single stray thought. After a moment, the spirit enters the qi, and qi unites with spirit—then the true breath naturally settles, and numinous clarity arises, all within the span of an instant. As Shao Kangjie’s *Xiantian Yin* says:
*"If asked about the precelestial, there is not a single word,
Yet postcelestial work requires effort."*

The method of the elixir is the same. Gathering the medicine in the precelestial is nonaction; applying fire in the postcelestial is action. They cannot be treated as one and the same.

**The First Stirring of Yang**
Bai Ziqing’s *Zhuyu Ji: Dansui Ge* says:
*"To refine the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice—
Within the body, a single yang naturally arises."*

But how does one know when the single yang stirs within? It is in the instant between breaths, when *xun* opens and the heart awakens—that fleeting moment of indistinctness. At this time, one fans the bellows and stokes the fierce fire, so that true lead emerges from *kan*, and the river chariot does not dare to linger, carrying it to the summit of *qiaoqiao*. Only then can it become the Return Elixir. As Shao Kangjie’s *Huanghu Yin* says:
*"In the indistinct, yin and yang first transform,
Swirling and coiling as heaven and earth begin to turn.
Amidst this, a fleeting radiance appears—
How can mere words capture the work?"*

Without penetrating insight into the transformations of yin and yang, who could comprehend this?

**The Endless Night of the Midwatch**
The midwatch is the midnight hour of *zi*. The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* says:
*"Embracing the primal in the Void and Danger,
One disseminates essence at the hour of *zi*."*

It also states:
*"Between the dark and the new moon,
The tally aligns and moves at the center."*

This refers to the moment before midnight on the thirtieth day, the threshold between the dark and the new moon. If applied to a single day, then every night before the hour of *zi* is this threshold, not limited to the midnight of the thirtieth day. The *Wuzhen Pian* says:
*"The sun and moon meet once every thirty days,
Exchanging time for days—this is the divine work."*

Its meaning is clear. The *lou* (water clock) has both inner and outer aspects. Internally, it is the breath’s exhalation and inhalation. As Xue Zixian’s *Fuming Pian* says:
*"This heart is like embers beneath chaff,
In silent sitting, one hears the dripping of the water clock."*

Externally, it is the actual water clock. Some may question the *Wuzhen Pian*’s line:
*"Know that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace,
Do not seek solitude in the deep mountains,"*

unaware that in the mountains, lamps and water clocks are hard to come by. Others may object, citing Chen Niuwan’s *Cuixu Pian*:
*"If one says the water clock is unreliable,
They have not grasped the mystery—no medicine will form."*

Yet it also says:
*"Gaze at the sundial by day, watch the water clock by night."*

How contradictory! In the early stages of refinement, when skill is not yet mastered, one may err, so an external water clock is necessary to mark the proper time. But once skill is perfected and the elixir field is seeded, essence arises at its appointed hour, and the spirit knows the time. Even in sleep, one awakens without needing to be roused—what need is there for a water clock then? "Endless night" describes the unbroken continuity of its dripping. Within the body, this is the ceaseless flow of true breath—let it not falter, just as the water clock’s flow is unbroken.

**The Warm Lead Cauldron, Light Piercing the Curtain**
The cauldron is the lower elixir field. As the hour of *zi* approaches, yang qi subtly stirs below, hence the warmth. The curtain refers to the eyes—lowering the gaze resembles a drawn curtain. When the elixir field holds medicine and yang qi rises, it penetrates the space between the brows, casting light. This is like a candle in a room: the light shines through the window, but the brightness is not from the window—it is from the candle. Some, upon first witnessing this, may marvel in astonishment, but if the heart stirs and the spirit scatters, how can the elixir be achieved?

**The Rushing of Creation’s Forces**
"Rushing" refers to the end of *kun* and the beginning of *fu*. At this moment, a jade chime sounds, and the twin caves open. The *Fuming* says: "Both sides ascend together, sharing a single pound." This is the time.

**The Mating of Tiger and Dragon**
The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.
They feed upon each other, mutually devouring."*

In elixir-making, the key is for heart and breath to depend on each other, so that qi gathers and spirit congeals, mating to form the medicine. Chen Chaoyuan’s *Yuzhi Shu* says:
*"If the yellow and black do not mate,
How can yang fly from beneath *kan*?"*

Thus, only when yin and yang mate and the elixir field holds medicine can fire be applied.

**The Fire Phase of Ox, Dipper, and Rooftop**
Ox, Dipper, and Rooftop are the directional markers of the fire phase within the body.

The fire-phase practice begins at *zi* and initiates movement at *yin*, just as heaven’s living things take form in the womb at *zi* and emerge at *yin*. The *Cantong Qi* states: “It begins in the northeast quarter of *Ji* and the Dipper, then revolves rightward, spewing forth the wheel and spitting out the sprout.” The *Cuixu Pian* says: “There is a path where mother and child part at birth—its marvel lies in the tail of *Ji*, the Dipper, *Niu*, and *Nü*.” This shares the same purport. Some interpret *Niu*, *Dou*, and *Wei* as “still perilous,” citing the *Wuzhen Pian*: “Grasped in both hands, it is called dead,” to elucidate this point—another valid explanation.

At Qujiang, the moon’s radiance appears pristine. The *Cuixu Pian* says: “On the southwest path, the moon’s radiance is bright; the great medicine returns, born from this place. I recall an ancient poet’s line: *At Qujiang’s banks, the magpie bridge spans.*” The ancients took the small intestine’s nine coils and twelve bends as Qujiang, while later adepts identified it as the space between nose and mouth—both interpretations hold. Yet *Cuixu* further clarifies its meaning through the southwest path, rendering it profoundly clear. The southwest corresponds to *kun*, and *kun* is the abdomen. When the medicine arises in the elixir field, yang qi ascends, alighting upon the eyes and emitting light. Thus, from the eyes to the navel, the entire path gleams with empty whiteness, luminous as the moon’s radiance.

There is a crow in flight. This “crow in flight” signifies the union of heaven and earth within the body, the merging of *kan* and *li*, as the two qi intermingle in harmony, coalescing into a single dewdrop that flies and alights in the elixir field. Chen Xiyi’s *Zhixuan Pian* says: “A crow in flight enters the osmanthus palace.” The *Cuixu Pian* states: “The red lotus holds its pistil; the dewdrop congeals into jade, flying into the flower pool as pearl after pearl.” The *Yujihuanyuan Pian* says: “One who comprehends this principle will see a single drop fall into the Yellow Court.” Bai Ziqing’s verse reads: “Now that I’ve pierced the golden crow’s mystery, it flies into the jade toad’s cavern.” All express this same meaning. At that moment, one naturally imbibes the *daogui*.

Medical texts speak of the "square-inch spoon" and the "blade’s tip," referring to the merest speck—nothing more than the corner of a knife’s edge. The phrase "imbibes it oneself" means traversing the Three Palaces, descending into the mouth, which aligns with the *Wuzhen Pian*’s "shedding the embryo to enter the mouth, the body attains sagehood." The principle is one and the same.

Some may doubt: if the embryo has already been shed, why does it re-enter the mouth? They thus assume the elixir comes from without, swallowing external substances, straying far from the Dao. Yet does not the *Cuixu Pian* say: *"Gather it, refine it—not for a moment’s pause; a single qi, vast and boundless, courses through the Three Passes. The Three Passes’ ceaseless flow draws forth a white meridian, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace. Above the Mud Pill, the Purple Gold Crucible; within the crucible, a lump of purple gold, transmuting into jade nectar that streams into the mouth, its fragrance and sweetness suffusing the tongue."* Could this ever come from outside oneself? Who would believe that a child is nurtured from nothingness?

The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is utterly simple and effortless, generating being from non-being, nurturing the infant within. Saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood—these may serve as stepping stones, but they are not the elixir’s treasure. Scholars, confined by narrow views, cling to preconceived notions and refuse to delve into the elixir texts. Even if a true adept seeks to enlighten them, who would believe?

The *Cuixu Pian* states: *"A marvel that draws laughter time and again—now even men can conceive! Their own essence and blood unite; within the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed!"* For "husband and wife" are but alternate names for yin and yang—no true couple exists. Yet some, fixated on the notion of "mending bamboo with bamboo," insist on "supplementing man with man," turning to the perverse arts of the Three Peaks. How could they ever trust that the Golden Elixir is a path of pure non-action, generating being from non-being?

Thus, clinging to action gives rise to being from non-being, while non-action emerges from within being—each proceeds in its proper sequence. Distinguishing the purity of the water’s source has already been discussed. One view holds: *"Heaven is pure, earth is turbid—such is creation."* Another: *"Draw the pure, discard the turbid—unceasingly refine."* Now, regarding the "purity of the water’s source," let us examine the term "water source." As the *Yi* says, *"Heaven’s One generates water,"* whose position lies in the north, where the eight waters converge—hence the name "water source." The *Cuixu Pian* declares: *"Urge the hundred meridians to return to the source."* This is its meaning.

Above is pure; below is turbid. Initially, above and below intermingle as one. Over time, they gradually settle, gradually clarify—once pure, the supreme medicine arises within. Liu Haichan’s *Huánjīn Piān* speaks of *"water congealing into amber,"* which is this very process. As for the notion of "retaining the pure and discarding the turbid," that is another matter.

In my commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, I wrote: *"In form, it resembles ash and earth, like dust settling on a bright window."* This has been explained in detail.

**Wood and Metal in Separation**
Within the body lies a single substance, divided into two: the floating is Wood, the sinking is Metal. One to the east, one to the west—hence their separation. If the Dipper’s handle is skillfully turned, driving them to circulate above and below like the flowing of the Celestial River, then Wood’s nature yearns for Metal, Metal’s essence clings to Wood, and punishment and virtue unite without barrier.

Some claim that crossing the gaze of the two eyes at the center achieves the union of Metal and Wood. This is one interpretation, yet according to the *Cantong Qi* and *Wuzhen Pian*, the separation of Metal and Wood lies within, not without. Without a teacher’s guidance, how could one ever grasp this? The *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true adept, do not force guesses."* For the elixir texts often employ metaphors to clarify principles or establish symbols to convey meaning—names and terms vary, leaving scholars who read them abruptly with nothing but a sense of vast, unfathomable distance.

Consider the Five Agents: sometimes called Metal and Wood, sometimes Metal and Earth, sometimes Water and Fire, sometimes Metal and Fire, sometimes Metal and Water, sometimes Water and Earth. The mind and eye grow dizzy—truly, it is not easily known.

**The Subtlety of the Dao’s Essentials**
The essentials of the elixir path are two: union and fire progression. Though they follow a sequence, they are but a single effort. Xiao Zixu’s *Jindan Dacheng Ji* speaks of *"the marvel of work within moments"*—how subtle, how profound! The celestial mechanism runs deep.

The celestial mechanism refers to the midnight *zi* hour, the moment when yang first stirs. As the celestial mechanism approaches, if one can activate their own mechanism to align with it, then heaven and human unite in simultaneous arousal, inner and outer correspond, and the elixir coalesces. Though it is said that within a single day’s twelve hours, every juncture of union may serve, the ancient immortals invariably chose the midnight *zi* hour—when yang first stirs—because at that time, the great yang stands precisely in the north, and the qi in the human body reaches the *Weilü* Pass, thus resonating with heaven and earth. This is what is meant by "stealing from heaven and earth, seizing the workings of creation"—only at this moment is it so. By the *chou* hour, the Great Unity has already shifted, and the qi in the human body has passed the *Weilü* Pass. By the *yin* hour, the great yang has already risen above the earth, and the qi in the human body has passed the Kidney Hall—neither may be used. The *Yuzhi Shu* states: "In refining the elixir, one must kindle the fire in accord with the yang qi of the *zi* hour—only then is the fire truly ignited. If the fire is kindled at any other time, it remains incomplete." These words exhaust the matter.

"To begin swift cultivation is already too late.
*Begin* refers to the moment of refinement and firing. Gather the spirit of the entire body into the Heavenly Valley Cavity—yet do not let it stray, for this is no mere act of grasping. Some cling to the phrase *begin* and take it to align with the *Wuzhen Pian*’s line, 'Seize with both hands and make it die,' thus straining to clench their fists, or covering their ears and nose, or rubbing their waist and abdomen, or pressing the thumb into the palm, or prodding the navel with the middle finger—is this not labor in vain?

*Swift cultivation is already too late* means that time flies swiftly, and one must cultivate without delay. The path to Penglai is trodden only when three thousand deeds are complete, walking alone upon the clouds to return.

*Three thousand deeds complete* refers to nine years, or three thousand days. Within these three thousand days, one must accumulate virtue and amass good deeds, never straying from the Dao for even a moment in the twelve hours. As Liu Xugu’s *Huandan Pian* states: 'To perfect the great elixir requires three thousand days; its wondrous work must not falter in the twelve hours.'

In the alchemical method, the embryo forms in a single instant, the work proves efficacious in a hundred days, the embryo matures in a year, and the deeds are complete in nine years—each stage has its measure. There is no principle by which one may meet a master today and become an immortal tomorrow. Know that in one year, there is minor attainment; in nine years, a great transformation. First, the qi is transformed; next, the blood; then the vessels; then the flesh; then the marrow; then the sinews; then the bones; then the hair; and finally, the form. After nine years and nine transformations, the yin qi is refined away, and pure yang is achieved. Only then may one leave the world behind, stand alone, and ascend as an immortal on feathered wings.

Have you not read the *Youji Jixian Zhuan*, which records Chen Chaoyuan’s admonition to the world: 'Those who perform good deeds will surely enjoy blessings; those who accumulate hidden virtue will see their descendants flourish. To not waste the things of heaven, to not indulge in theft or lust, to not destroy the true teaching—these are good deeds. To save the dying and aid the wounded, to rush to others’ distress, to never conceal or harm—these are hidden virtues. Without good deeds or hidden virtue, the paths of evil will find no barrier!'

Chaoyuan’s words were spoken for the common folk—how much more do they apply to those who seek immortality! Generally, to cultivate the Dao of immortality, one must first cultivate the Dao of humanity. If the Dao of humanity is not cultivated, the Dao of immortality remains distant.

Have you not also seen the *Wuzhen Pian*’s lines: 'The great medicine is cultivated with ease or difficulty; know that it depends on me, yet also on heaven. Without accumulating deeds and cultivating hidden virtue, demons will arise at every turn to obstruct the path.'

How can scholars use the saying 'my fate is in my own hands' as an excuse and not treat the accumulation of deeds as urgent?

Alas! With three thousand deeds, one becomes an immortal of the Great Veil; with eight hundred deeds, one becomes a guest of the Great Veil. Let our fellowship strive for this!"

The Great Medicine is none other than essence, qi, and spirit;
Its pivotal mechanism lies wholly in Master Qinyuan Chun’s profound grasp of Pure Yang’s intent,
Who exhaustively expounded the subtle workings for all to know.

On the fifteenth day of the fourth month in the yiwei year of the Yuanzhen era,
Wang Zhuzhong of Sanshan respectfully inscribed this with incense reverence.

**Preface to the Reprinted *Lingbao Bifa***

In my youth, I was already enamored of the true Dao, secretly immersing myself in alchemical texts. Recently, a friend from Yuzhang arrived, bringing me a copy of *Lingbao Bifa*. Some say it originated from a family collection in Sichuan. I burned incense and began to read. Though I have not yet fully grasped its profound mysteries, the realms of humans and heavens have become vaguely clear to me. I now understand that Ancestor Zhongli distilled the secret subtleties of the *Lingbao Sutra* and transmitted them to Ancestor Lü to deliver the world—both practiced it diligently, distilling the vast into the essential, thereby attaining self-cultivation.

Now, sharing it with like-minded friends, I am deeply delighted and thus seek patrons to publish it for the benefit of all virtuous people. Yet some may say: "Ancestor Zhongli once stated that this scripture links the eight trigrams with the twelve hours, with its essence in *Gen*; the three fields cycle repeatedly, with their crux in the *Niwan*; the initial practice begins with swallowing qi and rinsing saliva as metaphors, but the true qi and oral instructions rely on direct transmission, not mere words." After reading it several times, I find the oral instructions for cultivation detailed and exhaustive. Though its words are veiled, its Dao shines forth.

Master Yichuan said: "The human mind is most agile, shifting in myriad forms. There has never been one who, doing nothing, could empty-mindedly guard it. Beginners, unaware of the method of restraint, must immerse themselves in the words of sages, letting principles delight the heart, so that the celestial mechanism flows smoothly—one cannot rigidly hold or forcefully guard." This aligns with the Buddhist teaching of illuminating the mind with reciting the Buddha’s name as its core. In our Most High’s thirty-six revered scriptures, the sacred titles of the Celestial Venerables are repeatedly invoked—how could this be in vain?

Mencius said: "Those with roots are like this; this is what they take." As for the meaning of the eight trigrams and three fields, it is rooted in a day having four seasons and a heart containing the five phases. Moment by moment, one can seize the *qi* of heaven and earth as medicine for the body. At the *Gen* trigram’s hour, it is even more abundant. The *Niwan* is the palace of spirit and the source of *qi* and essence—it must not be neglected. If one can preserve and practice this, they will witness the yellow sprout grow and the embryo form, the millet grain mature and the spirit ascend—thus fulfilling the great man’s work.

I wish to explore this together with all readers of *Lingbao Bifa*. This serves as the preface.

Written in the spring of the *Jimao* year, the fifth year of the Guangxu reign of the Great Qing, on an auspicious day at the Dawn Window Mountain Studio of White Bamboo Slope by Gu Tan’s Luo Yuan and the clamorous De Wen.

**Original Preface to *Lingbao Bifa* (II)**

The Dao cannot be transmitted through words nor recorded by names. Since ancient times, those who ascended as immortals or attained the Dao have not been few. I, aspiring to follow the ancients, have long cherished the great Dao. Unexpectedly, war arose, and the times grew perilous. Initially seeking refuge, I wandered rivers and lakes, mountains and valleys. Retreating, I recognized my nature and focused my mind, dwelling only in purity and tranquility.

Having studied alchemical texts and consulted Daoist friends, I found they spoke only of minor techniques for nourishing life, not the grand Dao of true immortality. Then, in the stone walls of Zhongnan Mountain, I obtained the *Lingbao Sutra* in thirty volumes: the upper section, *Golden Decrees*, composed by the Primordial Beginning; the middle section, *Jade Records*, written by the Primordial Sovereign; and the lower section, *True Source Teachings*, transmitted by the Most High. Together, they comprise thousands of characters.

I rose early and retired late, pondering deeply, and realized: within yin there is yang, within yang there is yin—this is the natural ascent and descent of heaven and earth; within *qi* water is born, within water *qi* is born—this is the principle of heart and kidney communion. By comparing these images, the Dao is not far from man.

Matching *Jia* and *Geng*—only then is the golden elixir verified;
Drawing from *Mao* and adding to *You*—naturally, the fire timing is flawless.
Red lead and black lead—thoroughly refined, they do not form the great medicine;
Golden liquid and jade liquid—only at the end do they become the returning elixir.
From nothing to being—once warlike intentions are set aside,
From below to above—gradually entering the realm of the subtle and serene.
Extracting lead and adding mercury—causing the two eights of yin to dissolve;
Refining bones and forging form—enabling the nine threes of yang to grow.
The source of water, clear or turbid—distinguished at the moment of *Jiji*;
The inner landscape, true or void—recognized in the state of *Zuowang*.

The profound subtleties of the mysterious mechanism are difficult to fully express. Yet the wondrous principles of *Lingbao* can be used to enter sagehood and transcend the mundane.

The comprehensive teaching of the Three Vehicles is titled *The Complete Methods of Lingbao*. The sacred words of the Great Dao must not be hoarded by one individual, and so they are transmitted to the esteemed Dongbin. Once the Dao is attained, do not conceal it; rather, bequeath it to those who come after. Preface by Zhongli Quan, the True Man of Zhengyang.

**Lesser Vehicle: Methods for Peace and Longevity (Volume One)**
**First Gate: The Union of Yin and Yang**
*(Yang Embryo and Yin Breath, True Embryonic Breath, Union of Kan and Li)*

The Jade Scripture states: The Great Dao is formless—sight and hearing cannot perceive it; the Great Dao is nameless—measurement and calculation cannot fathom it. It gives rise to form through the Dao, and through form, names are established. The greatest of these names are Heaven and Earth. Heaven embodies the Dao of Qian, accumulating qi to cover what lies below; Earth embodies the Dao of Kun, supporting substance to bear what lies above. Between the covering and bearing, the distance between above and below spans eighty-four thousand *li*, where qi and substance cannot interact. Heaven, through Qian, seeks Kun and returns to the center of Earth, its yang carrying yin upward; Earth, through Kun, seeks Qian and returns to the center of Heaven, its yin embracing yang downward. In this ascent and descent, the Dao is enacted, and thus Heaven and Earth endure.

The True Source states: Between Heaven and Earth, what is close to the above is yang. From above to below, forty-two thousand *li* constitute the "Yang Position." What is close to the below is yin. From below to above, forty-two thousand *li* constitute the "Yin Position." Once form and name exist, they cannot escape measurement. Consider one year: four seasons, eight solar terms, twenty-four qi, seventy-two pentads, three hundred sixty days, and four thousand three hundred twenty hours. Twelve hours make a day, five days a pentad, three pentads a qi, three qi a solar term, two solar terms a season, and four seasons a year. The year begins with the Winter Solstice. At this time, yang ascends from Earth. Each qi lasts fifteen days, ascending seven thousand *li*. Three qi form a solar term, forty-five days in total, with yang ascending twenty-one thousand *li*. Two solar terms make a season, ninety days in total, with yang ascending forty-two thousand *li*, precisely reaching the center between Heaven and Earth, where yang converges with the Yin Position. At this time, yang is half within yin, its qi warm, corresponding to the Spring Equinox. Beyond this, yang ascends into the Yang Position, truly gaining qi to rise. Similarly, forty-five days later is the Beginning of Summer. After another forty-five days comes the Summer Solstice. At the Summer Solstice, yang ascends, totaling eighty-four thousand *li* to reach Heaven, where yang is within yang, its qi hot. Accumulated yang generates yin, and one yin arises within two yang. Beginning with the Summer Solstice, yin descends from Heaven. Each qi lasts fifteen days, descending seven thousand *li*. Three qi form a solar term, forty-five days in total, with yin descending twenty-one thousand *li*. Two solar terms make a season, ninety days in total, with yin descending forty-two thousand *li*, reaching the center between Heaven and Earth, where yin converges with the Yang Position. At this time, yin is half within yang, its qi cool, corresponding to the Autumn Equinox. Beyond this, yin descends into the Yin Position, truly gaining qi to descend. Similarly, forty-five days later is the Beginning of Winter. After another forty-five days comes the Winter Solstice. At the Winter Solstice, yin descends, totaling eighty-four thousand *li* to reach Earth, where yin is within yin, its qi cold. Accumulated yin generates yang, and one yang arises within two yin. After the Winter Solstice, one yang ascends again as before. This circulation continues endlessly, ever returning to its beginning, never deviating from the Dao. At the Winter Solstice, yang is born, ascending to return to Heaven; at the Summer Solstice, yin is born, descending to return to Earth. At the Summer Solstice, yang ascends to Heaven and one yin arrives; at the Winter Solstice, yin descends to Earth and one yang arrives. Hence, they are called the "Summer Solstice" and "Winter Solstice." Yang ascends above, passing the Spring Equinox to enter the Yang Position, departing the Yin Position; yin descends below, passing the Autumn Equinox to enter the Yin Position, departing the Yang Position. Hence, they are called the "Spring Equinox" and "Autumn Equinox." After the Winter Solstice, as yang ascends, yin does not cease to descend; the descending yin is merely residual yin within yang, dissipating within the Yang Position. Even if it descends to its position and encounters ascending yang, its qi is exhausted. After the Summer Solstice, as yin descends, yang does not cease to ascend; the ascending yang is merely residual yang within yin, dissipating within the Yin Position. Even if it ascends to its position and encounters descending yin, its qi is exhausted. The ascent and descent of yin and yang, above and below, do not exceed eighty-four thousand *li*, and their coming and going cannot escape three hundred sixty days. Through the four qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, one discerns yin and yang; through the eight solar terms of yang’s ascent and yin’s descent, one understands Heaven and Earth. Measuring this with the mechanism of Heaven, one may grasp the remnants of the Great Dao. If relying on mere oral and aural learning to weigh the Dao of Heaven and Earth, how can one fathom it through calculation?

For analogy: The Dao gives birth to the myriad things, and Heaven and Earth are the greatest among them; humans are the most spiritually endowed. Humans correspond to Heaven and Earth: the heart is likened to Heaven, the kidneys to Earth; the liver is the Yang Position, the lungs the Yin Position. The distance between heart and kidneys is eight *cun* and four *fen*, analogous to the space between Heaven’s covering and Earth’s bearing. Qi is likened to yang, and fluid to yin. The *zi* and *wu* hours correspond to the Summer and Winter Solstices; the *mao* and *you* hours correspond to the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes.

A single day mirrors a full year; the eight trigrams of a day correspond to the eight solar terms. At the *zi* hour, qi arises within the kidneys; by the *mao* hour, it reaches the liver. The liver being yang, its qi flourishes, ascending into the yang position—analogous to the Spring Equinox. By the *wu* hour, qi arrives at the heart, where accumulated qi generates fluid—comparable to the Summer Solstice, when yang ascends to Heaven and yin begins to stir. At the *wu* hour, fluid arises within the heart; by the *you* hour, it flows to the lungs. The lungs being yin, their fluid abounds, descending into the yin position—analogous to the Autumn Equinox. At the *zi* hour, fluid returns to the kidneys, where accumulated fluid engenders qi—comparable to the Winter Solstice, when yin descends to Earth and yang begins to stir. This cycle repeats endlessly, its movement ceaseless, like the revolutions of the sun and moon, neither diminishing nor waning, thus ensuring longevity.

The true secret states: The Dao of Heaven and Earth is attained in unity—only humans possess this capacity. Yet having received form from father and mother, and form giving rise to further form, one drifts ever farther from the Dao. After the fetus is complete and qi is full, the six desires and seven emotions dissipate original yang and scatter true qi. Though qi and fluid naturally generate one another, they cannot ascend and descend as in Heaven and Earth. With each exhalation, original qi departs; with each inhalation, original qi enters, drawing in the qi of Heaven and Earth—yet once taken in, it cannot be retained, and with the next exhalation, it departs again. The qi of one’s own palace is instead seized by Heaven and Earth, so that scattered qi scarcely generates fluid, and scant fluid scarcely generates qi.

When qi is at its peak, employ the *mao* trigram daily: for qi, take in more and release less, forcibly retaining it within the abdomen. Thus, what naturally ascends from below does not escape, and what enters from without lingers briefly. The two qi converge, accumulating to generate the fluids of the five viscera, replenishing the origin ever more abundantly. With daily practice over time, results will appear and persist.

The essential Dao states:
To meet the eldest son of yang’s lord,
One must take in more and release less—
Let the children contend among themselves,
Then seek the true one when the time is past.
This is the method of accumulating qi to generate fluid, and accumulating fluid to generate qi, the art of harmonizing qi and fluid in mutual generation. In practice, no more than a year is needed to seize the achievement; take three hundred days in a year as the term, and results will appear within ten days. With increased food and drink, illnesses vanish.

The head and eyes become clear and sharp, the heart and abdomen feel empty and light; strength increases while fatigue diminishes, and at times the sound of wind and thunder arises within the belly. The remaining signs are too numerous to record.

Explanation states: The "eldest son of yang’s lord" is the *gan* seeking the *kun*, like qi ascending upward. The "son" is qi, rising from the kidneys; the "daughter" is fluid, descending from the heart. Their contention is the interplay of above and below. Closing the qi generates fluid, and accumulating fluid generates qi, balancing the two. When the time is past, true water is naturally obtained.

Direct Explanation states: This is the initial step, taken during the *mao* hexagram when yang rises and qi flourishes. One inhales more of heaven and earth’s upright qi and exhales less of one’s own original qi. Thus, the two qi converge, qi accumulates to generate fluid, and abundant fluid generates qi—this is the method of matching yin and yang, the mutual generation of qi and fluid.

**Gathering and Dispersing Water and Fire (Second) [Taiyi Containing True Qi, Minor Refinement of Form, Heavenly Youth Never Aging]**

The *Jin Gao* states: The so-called Great Dao is lofty yet without superior—look up to observe it, and above it there is no above, nor can its beginning be seen. The so-called Great Dao is lowly yet without inferior—look down to examine it, and below it there is no below, nor can its foundation be seen. It has no predecessor at its inception, nor can its front be seen; it has no end at its conclusion, nor can its rear be seen. Within the Great Dao, heaven and earth are born; heaven and earth possess the forms of high and low. Within heaven and earth, there are yin and yang; yin and yang possess the numbers of beginning and end. Rising and falling, looking up and down, one may fathom its mechanism; beginning and ending, measuring and calculating, one may grasp its principle. Through this, the Great Dao may be known.

The *True Source* states: From the positions of heaven and earth above and below, one knows that heaven and earth have high and low; from the cycles of yin and yang’s beginning and end, one knows the before and after of the heavenly Dao. Heaven and earth do not depart from their numbers, and their numbers conclude in one year; yin and yang do not lose their proper timing, and their timing divides at the eight nodes. At the winter solstice, one yang is born; at the spring equinox, yang is half within yin. Beyond this, pure yang prevails and yin is exhausted. At the summer solstice, yang reaches its great extreme and one yin is born; at the autumn equinox, yin is half within yang. Beyond this, pure yin prevails and yang is exhausted. At the winter solstice, yin reaches its great extreme and one yang is born, rising and falling as before. Though the cycles of above and below, beginning and end cannot fully encompass the Great Dao, they do not depart from its essence. To understand the Great Dao, one must take heaven and earth as a model and carefully examine the proper timing of yin and yang.

Analogy states: Compare the heart and kidneys to heaven and earth, qi and fluid to yin and yang, and one day to one year. In daily practice: the *gen* hexagram corresponds to the *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) node in a year; the *qian* hexagram corresponds to the *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) node in a year. Within heaven and earth, that which is closer to the lower is yin; from below upward, forty-two thousand *li* is called the yin position, where yang is born at the winter solstice and ascends. At the time of *Lichun*, yang rises within the yin position at twenty-one thousand *li*—this is when yang struggles to overcome yin. Within heaven and earth, that which is closer to the upper is yang; from above downward, forty-two thousand *li* is called the yang position, where yin is born at the summer solstice and descends. At the time of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), yin descends within the yang position at twenty-one thousand *li*—this is when yin struggles to overcome yang. At the time of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), yang ascends upward, sixty-three thousand *li* from the earth and twenty-one thousand *li* from heaven—this is when yang attains its position and yin is cut off. At the time of *Lidong*, yin descends downward, sixty-three thousand *li* from heaven and twenty-one thousand *li* from the earth—this is when yin attains its position and yang is cut off. Within a year, *Lichun* corresponds to the *gen* hexagram (the *chou-yin* hours) in a day. Kidney qi transmits downward to the bladder, weak within the fluid—this is the time when yang qi struggles to ascend. Within a year, *Lidong* corresponds to the *qian* hexagram (the *xu-hai* hours) in a day. Heart fluid descends, about to return to the origin and re-enter the kidneys—this is the time when yin flourishes and yang is cut off. People suffer from disharmony between yin and yang, with yang weak and yin abundant, hence illnesses are many.

The *True Formula* states: When yang rises at spring’s beginning, from below upward, it does not take long for yang to be half within yin (the *gen* hexagram’s *chou-yin* hours, when qi is weak). When yin descends at winter’s beginning, from above downward, it does not take long for yin to be half within yang (the *qian* hexagram’s *xu-hai* hours, when qi disperses). Such is the Way of heaven and earth. Yet for people: during the *gen* hexagram when qi is weak, they do not know the method of nurturing qi; during the *qian* hexagram when qi disperses, they do not understand the principle of gathering qi. Day and night, with the six desires and seven emotions, they dissipate original yang, causing true qi to weaken; losing true qi, true fluid does not generate. Thus, they cannot attain the longevity of heaven and earth. Therefore, the ancients practiced *zhun* in the morning and *meng* in the evening, using these two hexagrams daily to achieve long life in the world.

*Morning Zhun*: This takes the meaning of one yang below, bent and not yet extended. For oneself, one nurtures and extends it, preventing dissipation. *Evening Meng*: This takes the meaning of a child seeking me, turning toward brightness and abandoning darkness—yin seeking yang. For oneself, one obscures and then illuminates, preventing loss. Thus, at sunrise, one should use the time of the *gen* hexagram to nurture original qi. Do not let profit and fame disturb the heart, nor let likes and dislikes interfere with the mind. Don a robe and sit quietly to nurture qi; cut off thoughts and forget emotions, gently performing guiding exercises. Alternate the hands and feet, stretching and contracting three to five times, so that the qi of the four limbs arises together, internally preserving original qi to ascend and pay court to the heart palace. Or swallow saliva once or twice, rub the head and face twenty to thirty times, and exhale the stagnant, turbid qi accumulated through the night.

With prolonged practice, the complexion becomes radiant and lustrous, the skin smooth and glowing (the *gen* hexagram nurtures original qi). Furthermore, at sunset, one should use the time of the *qian* hexagram to gather original qi. Enter a chamber and sit quietly, swallowing qi and retracting the external kidneys. Swallowing qi draws the heart’s fire downward; retracting the external kidneys gathers the bladder’s qi inward (the *qian* hexagram gathers original qi). Thus, upper and lower unite, the fire of kidney qi converges with the three fires to become one, warming the lower elixir field. Without fluid, gather qi to generate fluid; with fluid, refine fluid to generate qi—this is called "gathering fire," also named "Great Unity," containing true qi. The morning practice of swallowing saliva and rubbing the face, alternating hands and feet in stretching, is called "dispersing fire," also known as "minor refinement of form."

The essential Dao states:
*Petals wither, leaves fall in late autumn—*
*The jade-like one grows weary of ascending the perilous tower.*
*To achieve harmony between ruler and people,*
*At the feast’s end, frequently gather and withdraw.*

This means drawing the heart’s qi downward and gathering the bladder’s qi inward, preventing dissipation so they unite with kidney qi to connect with the *kan* hexagram. The newly generated qi in the sea of qi must begin at the start of winter, and practice continues until results appear. The regimen need not exceed a year to yield accomplishment; a full year of three hundred days is the term, with results visible in ten days: the countenance glows, the skin becomes plump and radiant, the cinnabar field grows warm, urination decreases, the four limbs feel light and strong, the spirit is clear and refreshed, and chronic ailments and long-standing illnesses all vanish. If one cherishes time and practices tirelessly, even within the work of harmonizing yin and yang, slight results may appear. This method is then incorporated into daily practice, adding the *gen* hexagram’s work and briefly applying this technique. The three origins of the *qian* hexagram take effect, and practice continues until results manifest (the three origins are *qian*, *gen*, and *zhen*).

Explanation:
The line *"Petals wither, leaves fall in late autumn"* likens human qi to the fading light of dusk, where yang qi scatters and fails to ascend—hence the weariness of ascending the perilous tower. The "tower" refers to the twelve-storied tower. The heart is the ruler’s fire, the bladder the people’s fire. Swallowing qi and retracting the external kidneys unites the heart’s qi with the external kidneys’ qi as one—this is harmony. "Feast" refers to swallowing, "withdraw" to retracting. The morning practice is unbroken, for this method is the foundation.

Direct Explanation:
The *gen* hexagram’s yang qi is subtle, so one gently performs guiding exercises, stretching and contracting, swallowing saliva, and rubbing the face to disperse fire throughout the four limbs and nurture original qi. The *qian* hexagram’s yang qi scatters, so one swallows the heart’s qi and retracts the external kidneys to unite with kidney qi, merging the three fires into one to gather original qi. Thus, gathering and dispersing water and fire strengthens the root and solidifies the foundation.

**Third: The Union of Dragon and Tiger**
*(Absorbing and replenishing the elixir, nurturing the immortal embryo—true husband and wife meet in the harmony of water and fire, qi unites while form remains distinct)*

The *Golden Edict* states: When the Great Origin first divided, there was the Great Beginning; within the Great Beginning, there was the Great Void; within the Great Void, there was the Great Emptiness; within the Great Emptiness, there was the Great Substance. The Great Substance is the clear and turbid essence of heaven and earth. Its form is like an egg, its color dark and yellow—within the Great Emptiness, it is but a single thing. When yang ascends to heaven, it reaches the Supreme Ultimate and generates yin, which in profound obscurity embraces yang and descends; when yin descends to earth, it reaches the Supreme Ultimate and generates yang, which in boundless vastness bears yin and ascends. With each ascent and descent, yin descends and yang ascends—heaven and earth follow the Dao, and the myriad things are born and completed.

The *True Source* states: Heaven is like an overturned basin, where yang, upon arrival, struggles to ascend; earth is like a slab of stone, where yin, upon arrival, struggles to enter. At the winter solstice, yang within the earth ascends; at the summer solstice, when it reaches heaven, its yang attains the Supreme Ultimate and generates yin. The reason yin arises is that yang emerges from within yin, rising from the earth. In a state of indistinct confusion, qi contains water, though this water has no form. When the summer solstice reaches heaven, accumulated qi transforms into water—this is "yang attains the Supreme Ultimate and yin is born." At the summer solstice, yin within heaven descends; at the winter solstice, when it reaches earth, its yin attains the Supreme Ultimate and generates yang. The reason yang arises is that yin emerges from within yang, issuing from heaven. In profound obscurity, water contains qi, though this qi has no form. When the winter solstice reaches earth, accumulated water generates qi—this is "yin attains the Supreme Ultimate and yang is born."

Metaphorically: compare the body’s exterior to the Great Emptiness, the heart and kidneys to heaven and earth, qi and fluids to yin and yang, and the hours of *zi* and *wu* to winter and summer. The *zi* hour corresponds to the *kan* hexagram, when qi ascends from the kidneys; the *wu* hour corresponds to the *li* hexagram, when fluids generate in the heart. When kidney qi reaches the heart, it unites with the heart’s qi, and the Supreme Ultimate generates fluid. The reason fluid arises is that qi comes from the kidneys, and within qi lies true water, though this water has no form. When the *li* hexagram reaches the heart, it connects with the heart’s qi, and the Supreme Ultimate thus generates fluid. When heart fluids reach the kidneys, they unite with kidney water, and the Supreme Ultimate once more generates qi. The reason qi arises is that fluids come from the heart, and within fluids lies true qi, though this qi has no form. When the *kan* hexagram reaches the kidneys, it connects with kidney water, and the Supreme Ultimate thus generates qi. This can be likened to yang ascending and yin descending, reaching the Supreme Ultimate and mutually generating. The generated yin and yang conceal water within yang and qi within yin.

The *True Oral Instructions* state: Qi generated in the kidneys contains true water; fluids generated in the heart contain true qi. True water and true qi are the true dragon and true tiger. When yang reaches heaven, it struggles to ascend, and the Supreme Ultimate generates yin; when yin reaches earth, it struggles to enter, and the Supreme Ultimate generates yang. Such is the principle of heaven and earth. Humans cannot compare to heaven and earth because the six desires and seven emotions, stirred by external things, scatter original yang and lose true qi.

When kidney qi of the *Li* trigram ascends to the heart, the spirit and consciousness settle inwardly, the breath enters slowly through the nose and exits gently, continuous as if present—then the mouth fills with saliva, which is swallowed down. Naturally, kidney qi and heart qi unite, and the Supreme Ultimate generates fluid. When heart fluid of the *Kan* trigram descends to the kidneys, joining kidney water, naturally heart fluid and kidney qi unite, and the Supreme Ultimate generates qi. As true qi clings to fluid and true water clings to qi, fluid and true water are originally conjoined, thus fluid contains true qi and qi contains true water. Mutually intermingling and descending together, this is called the "union of dragon and tiger." If the firing times are without error and the withdrawal and addition are fitting, after three hundred days the true embryo is nurtured, forming the great elixir—the foundation of refining the body, burning the form, ascending to the origin, and transcending.

The *Essential Instructions* state:
*When primal qi first returns to the original movement,*
*True yang is about to reach the Li palace—seize the true dragon and true tiger.*
*The Jade Pool’s spring waters flow abundantly—*
*Beware lest primal qi leak away, true water escape beyond the body.*
*If qi scatters, fluid is hard to generate; if fluid is scant, true qi is absent.*
*When qi and water fail to unite, how can the great elixir form?*

At such times: within the year, use the months, beginning at the winter solstice; within the day, use the hours, taking the *Li* trigram as the appointed time. If one embraces the Dao in later years, with foundational vitality unstable, and self-assesses as depleted and deficient, with insufficient qi—then ten years’ depletion requires one year of practice to replenish, called "gathering and replenishing the returning elixir." Once replenishment reaches the required measure, cease this method, now called "water and fire in mutual aid," which can extend life and increase longevity—this is termed a "human immortal," its efficacy beyond full recounting. If replenishment is complete, sweet saliva arises in the mouth, the heart’s afflictions vanish of themselves, passions and desires are stilled, the hundred bones are free of illness, and the spirit’s radiance appears unseen, the eyes at times flashing like lightning. Beginning on the winter solstice, carefully regulate the method, and after three hundred days the true embryo is delivered—this is called the "immortal embryo."

Explanation: Externally, the noon hour is the *Li* trigram; the sun is true yang. In humans, the heart is the *Li* palace, and original yang is the true dragon. The true tiger is the water within the kidneys; the true dragon is the qi within the heart’s fluid. The mouth is the Jade Pool, and saliva is spring water.

Direct Explanation: When primal qi first returns to the original movement, take the winter solstice as the beginning—this is the *zi* month. When true yang is about to reach the *Li* palace, take the *Li* trigram as the appointed time—this is the noon hour. The true dragon is the qi within the heart’s fluid; the true tiger is the water within kidney qi. When qi and water unite, this is called the "union of dragon and tiger."

**Refining the Elixir and Cultivating the Medicine (Fourth)**
*(Firing Times, Small Celestial Cycle, Gathering Spirit and Nurturing Qi, Gathering Qi and Nurturing Spirit, Refining Yang and Nurturing Spirit)*

The *Golden Edict* states: Heaven and earth are the forms of the great Dao; yin and yang are the qi of the great Dao. Cold, dampness, heat, and coolness are qi within form; clouds, mist, rain, and dew are images within qi. Earth’s qi ascends, rising as clouds and dispersing as rain; heaven’s qi descends, scattering as mist and condensing as dew. When accumulated yin is excessive, dew becomes rain, frost, or snow; when accumulated yang is excessive, mist becomes smoke, clouds, or rosy clouds. When yang lies hidden within yin, yang qi fails to ascend, striking and clashing to generate thunder; when yin lies hidden within yang, yin qi fails to descend, congealing to form hail or sleet. When yin and yang fail to unite, they oppose each other, generating lightning; when yin and yang are mismatched, their chaotic union produces rainbows. Accumulated true yang forms spirits, adorning the heavens as stars; accumulated true yin forms shapes, strengthening the earth as soil and stone. The greatest of stars are the sun and moon; the most precious of soil and stone are gold and jade. Yin and yang manifest in tangible forms: above as the sun and moon, below as gold and jade.

The *True Source* states: Yin cannot generate without yang; yang cannot complete without yin. Accumulated yang becomes spirit, adorning the heavens, and the greatest are the sun and moon—the sun and moon are true yang, completed by true yin. Accumulated yin becomes form, strengthening the earth, and the most precious are gold and jade—gold and jade are true yin, generated by true yang. *(Practice in the xū and hài hours; gather the medicine in the Li trigram; advance the fire in the Qián trigram.)*

Analogy: True yang is likened to the true qi within heart fluid; true yin is likened to the true water within kidney qi. True water cannot generate without true qi; true qi cannot complete without true water. True water and true qi, compared to the *Li* trigram, harmonize above the heart and below the lungs, like mother and child clinging to each other, husband and wife loving each other. From *Li* to *Duì*, when the *Duì* trigram’s yin is flourishing and yang is weak, this is like the moon’s last quarter, gold and jade in darkness—useless. The sun and moon are completed by yin, their measure full to generate brightness; gold and jade are generated by yang, their qi full to form treasure. Gold and jade become treasure because their qi is sufficient, and yang is added; the sun and moon generate brightness because their measure is full, and spirit is bestowed. This is like advancing the fire in the *Qián* trigram, refining yang without decline. Fire increases in measure, and yang is born anew.

The *True Instructions* state: When the dragon and tiger unite in the *Li* trigram, this is called "gathering the medicine." When the time reaches the *Qián* trigram, qi and fluid are about to return to the origin, arising above the bladder, below the spleen and stomach, before the kidneys, behind the navel, to the left of the liver, to the right of the lungs, to the right of the small intestine, and to the left of the large intestine. At that time, spleen qi is flourishing and lung qi is abundant, while heart qi is cut off and liver qi is weak. True qi originally comes conjoined with yang qi; when yang qi is weak, true qi has nothing to cling to, and effort is spent in vain on gathering and uniting. At this moment, the spirit and consciousness must be inwardly guarded, the breath continuous, the belly slightly drawn in, and when the navel and kidneys feel intense heat, gently release and lightly restrain.

While the navel and abdomen have not yet grown hot, tightly restrain; as warmth gradually arises, maintain constancy, allowing the will to roam freely to fill heaven and earth—this is called "restraining the Yang Barrier to refine the elixir," ensuring qi does not ascend so as to secure true water. Passing through the spleen palace, it follows the breath to be transported into the life palace and the Yellow Court. As qi and fluid undergo transformation, they change with the seasons into essence; essence transforms into pearl, pearl into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, cinnabar into gold—this is called the "Golden Elixir," and its merit is no small matter.

The essential Dao states: Gathering the medicine must rely on the Jade Hare (the heart’s qi for gathering medicine, the Jade Hare’s kidney water); their union must be aided by the Yellow Matron. When they meet in Yongzhou (the *Qian* trigram), a single yang melody is played—this is the daily practice paired with medicine-gathering.

For those in later years seeking to remedy the tenfold depletion, this method is called "refining mercury to replenish the cinnabar field." Once the replenishment is complete, one returns to the daily practice of gathering medicine in the *Li* trigram and refining it in the *Qian* trigram by restraining the Yang Barrier. In spring and winter, gather more and refine less—one part *Qian* to two parts *Li*, doubling the effort. In autumn and summer, gather less and refine more—one part *Li* to two parts *Qian*, doubling the effort. Adjust according to the season’s flourishing qi; the efficacy of gathering and refining precedes all, enabling longevity and dwelling in the world as a human immortal.

Once replenishment is sufficient and results are verified, proceed with care in practice. After one hundred days of gathering medicine, the medicine’s power is complete; after two hundred days, the sacred embryo solidifies; after three hundred days, true qi is born, and the immortal embryo is perfected. Only when the medicine’s power is complete should the fire be increased in measure—this is called "fire timing." After the sacred embryo solidifies, the fire timing increases to the measure of the Small Celestial Cycle—this is called the "Small Celestial Cycle." Once the embryo is rounded and true qi is born, the fire timing increases to the measure of the Great Celestial Cycle—this is called the "Celestial Cycle Fire Timing." Gathering medicine to unite dragon and tiger, refining medicine to advance the fire—this is called "entering the Dao."

One must dwell in seclusion, the mind fixed on inner contemplation, neither allowing inner visions to escape nor outer distractions to enter. Like a woman nurturing a fetus or a dragon tending its pearl, even in eating, sleeping, waking, or speaking, one should act like an infant or a maiden in a chamber, ever fearful of loss or harm, the heart never straying from the Dao for even a moment.

Explanation: The medicine is the true qi of the heart; the hare is the true water of the kidneys; the Yellow Matron is the true fluid of the spleen. Harmonizing qi and water, they enter the Yellow Court. Yongzhou refers to the *Qian* trigram; restraining the Yang Barrier refers to the flanks and abdomen.

Annotation: The above is the secret to peaceful longevity, the four gates of the Lesser Vehicle, pertaining to human immortality.

The Middle Vehicle’s method for attaining immortality and avoiding death comprises three gates (Volume Two):
*Elbow-Behind Flying Gold Essence, Fifth*:
[Returning essence to replenish the brain, rousing the river chariot, uniting dragon and tiger, drawing lead and adding mercury, reverting age to youth]

The *Golden Edict* states: The ascent and descent of yin and yang do not transgress the bounds of heaven and earth; the revolutions of the sun and moon lie beyond heaven and earth.

East and west govern the sun’s rising and setting to divide day and night; south and north mark its coming and going to determine cold and heat. Day and night unceasing, cold and heat alternating, days accumulate into months, months into years. The accumulation of days into a month arises from the spirit (*hun*) concealed within the lunar essence (*po*) and the lunar essence concealed within the spirit. The accumulation of months into a year arises from the *lü* tones emerging within the *lü* and the *lü* emerging within the *lü* tones.

The sun and moon revolve to align with the mechanism of heaven and earth, never departing from the reckoning of *Qian* and *Kun*. Though the generation and completion of the myriad things lie in yin and yang, creation also relies upon the sun and moon.

The *True Source* states: The form of heaven and earth resembles an egg; within the six directions, its roundness is like a sphere. The sun and moon rise and set, revolving above one heaven and below one earth. Above and below, east and west, they circulate like a flying wheel. Rising in the east and setting in the west, the sun travels the Yang path; rising in the west and setting in the east, the moon travels the Yin path. Within a single day, they divide day and night. After the winter solstice, the sun rises from the south and moves northward. After the summer solstice, the sun rises from the north and moves southward. Winter’s night is summer’s day; summer’s night is winter’s day. Within a single year, they determine cold and heat.

The sun and moon each span 840 *li* in diameter. Four *chi* make one *bu*, and 360 *bu* make one *li*. Eight *ke* and twenty *fen* make one *shi*; twelve *shi* make one day. One month consists of thirty days, totaling 360 *shi*, amounting to 3,000 *ke* and 180,000 *fen*.

Now, Yang follows *Qian*, its number being nine; Yin follows *Kun*, its number being six. The spirit is born within the lunar essence at dawn. Since nine does not pair with six, three days later the spirit begins to grow within the lunar essence. In one day and night—100 *ke* and 60 *fen*—the spirit advances 70 *li* within the lunar essence. Over six days and nights, it advances 420 *li*, at which point the spirit fills half the lunar essence, known as the "first quarter." Another six days and nights advance it 420 *li*, totaling 840 *li*, filling the lunar essence entirely. With Yang full in the Yin position, this is called the "full moon."

Beginning on the sixteenth day, the lunar essence grows within the spirit. In one day and night—100 *ke* and 60 *fen*—the lunar essence advances 70 *li* within the spirit. Over six days and nights, it advances 420 *li*, filling half the spirit, known as the "last quarter." Another six days and nights advance it 420 *li*, totaling 840 *li*, filling the spirit entirely. With Yin full in the Yang position, the moon retains residual light because six does not exhaust nine. Three days later, the lunar essence fills the palace, known as the "dark moon."

After the new moon, nine emerges within six; before the dark moon, six emerges within nine. Though the reckoning is not yet complete, the next cycle begins in due course. Days accumulate into months, months into years.

In terms of months, the six *lü* and six *lü* tones begin with six, exhausting the six positions. Six times six is thirty-six, the completion number of Yin. In terms of days, five days make one *hou*, and seventy-two *hou* comprise the number eight times nine. At the double ninth, reckoning begins with nine, exhausting the six positions. Six times nine is fifty-four, the completion number of Yang. One six and one nine together make fifteen. Fifteen is the number of one *qi*. The twenty-four *qi* correspond to the eight nodes, revealing the proper ascent and descent of yin and yang.

One six and one nine, multiplied by four, yield the four seasons. Each season totals ninety, and four times nine is 360. Transformed, this becomes the Yang number 216 and the Yin number 144, together totaling 360 to complete the celestial revolution.

As an analogy: the ascent and descent of yin and yang within heaven and earth resemble the method of harmonizing the qi and fluids of the heart and kidneys. The revolution of the sun and moon beyond heaven and earth resembles the practice of *Elbow-Behind Flying Gold Essence*. The union of sun and moon is the method of advancing fire and reducing it. The ascent of Yang and descent of Yin differ not from the spirit and lunar essence of the sun and moon. The sun’s departure and moon’s arrival differ not from the qi and fluids of the heart and kidneys.

After the winter solstice, the sun rises at the *yi* position and sets at the *geng* position, with forty *ke* of daylight. Moving from south to north, over nine days it rises in the east and sets in the west, advancing sixty *fen* in total. By the spring equinox, day and night equalize, continuing until the summer solstice, when daylight reaches sixty *ke*. After the summer solstice, the sun rises at the *jia* position and sets at the *xin* position, with sixty *ke* of daylight. Moving from north to south, over nine days it rises in the east and sets in the west, retreating sixty *fen* in total. By the autumn equinox, day and night equalize, continuing until the winter solstice, when daylight returns to forty *ke*. The division of *ke* between day and night follows this pattern of advance and retreat from south to north.

After the new moon, on the third day the spirit is born within the lunar essence. By the sixth day, they balance, and after another six days the spirit is complete, its number being nine. After the full moon, the lunar essence is born within the spirit. By the sixth day, they balance, and after another six days the lunar essence is complete, its number being six.

At the summer solstice of the year and the sixteenth day of the month, one employs the method of the *Li* trigram, corresponding to the *wu* hour of a person. At the winter solstice of the year and the new moon, one employs the method of the *Kan* trigram, corresponding to the *zi* hour of a person. The proper ascent and descent of yin and yang in heaven and earth, the principles of spirit and lunar essence in the sun and moon, are all reckoned by number, their union orderly and their revolution unerring. Though the daily use of the heart and kidneys’ qi and fluids, the liver and lungs’ spirit and lunar essence, follows a sequence, how can there be no adjustment over months and years?

The *True Formula* states: When Yang is born in the *Kan* trigram, it is precisely the *zi* hour, neither beginning nor end. When the kidney qi meets the liver qi in the *Gen* trigram, before their union, sit upright in a quiet chamber, dressed and holding the fists, knees crossed. Tuck in the abdomen, then rise slightly, thrusting the chest forward and tilting the head back. Close the double gates of the spine, and gently move the elbows backward once or twice. Stretch the waist, and from the *Weilü* point, let the qi rise like fire, ascending from the waist to gather at the spine. Take care not to open the gates; when the heat is strong and the qi robust, gradually open the gates of the spine and release the qi to pass through.

Still facing upward, press the back of the head firmly backward to close the upper gate; take care not to open it. Once the heat becomes extreme and the qi robust, gradually open the gate to let the qi ascend into the crown, thereby replenishing the *Niwan* and the Sea of Marrow. Only when the body can endure cold and heat is this the foundation of longevity. Next, employ the method of *Returning the Elixir*.

As before, thrust the chest forward, stretch the waist, and close the *Jiaji* gates. Crouch and then extend; if the fire in the waist does not rise, sit in quiet meditation and repeat the method until the fire is kindled. Begin at the *chou* hour and continue until the end of the *yin* hour, at which point one may stop. This is called *"Elbow Fluid Flying Golden Essence"* and also *"Drawing Lead,"* whereby the qi of the kidneys generates the qi of the liver.

Moreover, the human spine has twenty-four vertebrae: from the bottom upward, the first three correspond to the internal kidneys; from the top downward, the last three are called the *"Celestial Pillar."* Above the Celestial Pillar lies the *"Jade Capital."* Below the Celestial Pillar, opposite the internal kidneys and above the *Weilü* point, are eighteen vertebrae, among which is the *"Double Gate."* Nine above and nine below—after one hundred days of steadfast practice, the qi traverses all eighteen vertebrae to enter the *Niwan*.

This must be performed precisely at the hour of the *Kan* trigram’s solitary Yang, known as *"Elbow Behind Flying Golden Essence."* The *Li* trigram governs the gathering of medicine, the *Qian* trigram the stoking of fire to refine the medicine, and the *"Restraining the Yang Gate."* After the first hundred days, the *Flying Golden Essence* enters the brain; with a single surge through the three gates, it ascends directly into the upper palace of *Niwan*, beginning with the *Kan* trigram and concluding with the *Gen* trigram.

When the *Li* trigram gathers medicine, the qi of the heart and kidneys unite, and the qi of the liver naturally arises from the qi of the heart. Once the two qi become purely Yang and the eight measures of Yin dissolve, they steam the lungs, causing the lung fluid to descend. Enveloping the true qi, it grows daily to the size of a millet grain before entering the *Yellow Court*, at which point it is called *"the material of the Inner Elixir."* Only after a hundred days without error is the medicinal potency complete.

Whenever the *Li* trigram gathers medicine, observe the timing with ever-greater precision. For the *Qian* trigram’s stoking of fire to refine the medicine and restraining the Yang Gate, begin with the *Dui* trigram and conclude with the *Qian* trigram. After another hundred days, the *Elbow Behind Flying Golden Essence* proceeds from the *Kan* trigram to the *Zhen* trigram. When the *Li* trigram gathers medicine, follow the previous method, coordinating it with practice from the *Kun* to the *Qian* trigram. After two hundred days without error, the Sacred Embryo solidifies. The method of restraining the Yang Gate concludes with the *Kun* to *Qian* trigrams. After another full hundred days, the *Niwan* is replete, and one reverts from old age to youth, no longer resembling ordinary people.

Once the medicine is gathered and the Embryo Immortal perfected, true qi is born—round as a pellet, its color like a red tangerine—forever abiding in the *Cinnabar Field* as an earthbound immortal. After three hundred days, cease gathering medicine at the *Li* trigram and restraining the Yang Gate at the *Kun* trigram, then proceed with the *Jade Fluid Returning Elixir* method. Thus, beginning after the Winter Solstice is called *"practicing the work."* After three hundred days, the embryo is complete, the qi full, the Inner Elixir achieved, and true qi born.

This method alone constitutes the *"Inversion of the Five Phases"* and the *"Reversal of the Three Fields."* Before practicing the work, one must first harmonize Yin and Yang, ensuring the mutual generation of qi and fluid until verification is achieved. Next, gather and disperse Water and Fire, securing the root and medicine so that qi flows while fluid abides, verified before proceeding. Then, unite the Dragon and Tiger, refining the elixir through gathering, replenishing, and returning, forging Lead and Mercury until verification is achieved. Once the count of *"ten depletions and one replenishment"* is fulfilled and qi and fluid mutually generate, verification is achieved.

The above practices belong to the Lesser Vehicle, sufficient for prolonging life and enhancing longevity. Only after replenishment is complete and firmness verified may one proceed: select the month of the Winter Solstice within the year; the day of *jiazi* within the month; and the hours of the *Kan*, *Li*, and *Qian* trigrams within the day to begin. For the first hundred days, proceed from *Kan* to *Gen* and from *Dui* to *Qian*. After two hundred days, proceed from *Kan* to *Zhen* and from *Kun* to *Qian*.

All such practice must be conducted in a secluded chamber within a tranquil dwelling, far from women and girls, where the sounds of chickens and dogs are unheard, foul odors do not enter the nose, the five flavors do not pass the lips, the seven emotions and six desires are severed, and diet—whether in quantity, temperature, or degree—is measured. Even in waking and sleeping, one must guard against loss. If practice is not diligent, the Way will be difficult to achieve! After three hundred days, observe the results.

A direct explanation states: This is the method of the *"Three Origins,"* namely: the *Kan* trigram’s *Flying Golden Essence*, returning the Lower Field to the Upper Field; the *Li* trigram’s gathering of medicine, returning the Lower Field to the Middle Field; and the *Qian* trigram’s restraining of the Yang Gate, returning the Middle Field to the Lower Field. This is also called the *"Reversal of the Three Fields."*

The *Essentials of the Dao* states: *"The sun and moon traverse the* Fu *trigram (midnight); crouch and rise for several days to open the gates, greedily hastening toward Yangzhou for assembly (the* Li *trigram’s union); the six palaces’ fire fills the Golden Field (the* Qian *palace)."*

An explanation: *"The sun and moon traversing the* Fu *trigram"* refers to the hour of solitary Yang—at the daily level, the *zi* hour; at the yearly level, the Winter Solstice—what was meant by selecting the day within the month and the hour within the day. The *"crouch and rise"* method was described earlier; *"several days"* refers to the fixed hundred days for opening the gates, first the middle gate, then the upper gate. *"Greedily hastening toward Yangzhou for assembly"*—*Yangzhou* corresponds to the heart in the human body, to the *wu* hour in the day, and to the *Li* trigram. *"Assembly"* refers to the union of true Yin and true Yang, hence *"gathering medicine."* *Qian* represents the six palaces; *"fire"* is qi. Restraining the Yang Gate gathers qi, using lung qi as Metal to descend to the kidneys’ *Cinnabar Field*, hence *"fire fills the Golden Field"*—this is practicing the *Qian* trigram to restrain the Yang Gate and gather fire in the Lower *Cinnabar Field.*

A direct explanation: *"The sun and moon traversing the* Fu *trigram"* refers to the *jiazi* hour of the Winter Solstice. *"Crouch and rise for several days to open the gates"* means crouching the abdomen and rising the body to kindle fire, opening the gates after a hundred days.

From *Kan* to *Gen*, this is the method of flying golden essence. The *"assembly at Yangzhou"* refers to gathering medicine from the *Li* trigram, the union of Yin and Yang. When fire fills the six palaces of the *Cinnabar Field*, the *Qian* trigram restrains the Yang Gate, gathering lung qi in the Lower Field—this is the path from *Dui* to *Qian*.

On the road to Zhongnan, mountains appear:
*"Rising the body, passing the Three Gates again and again,
Greedily gathering at Yangzhou for assembly—
How could it compare to the maiden burning heaven?"*

Explanation: *"Zhongnan"* refers to the Sage’s hidden intent in the *Middle Son*—the *Middle Son* is the *Kan* trigram. *Gen* is the mountain, the *Gen* trigram. The flight of golden essence halts at the *Xun* trigram, the time of the two-hundredth day of practice. *"Rising the body, passing the Three Gates again and again, greedily gathering at Yangzhou for assembly"* has been explained before. *"How could it compare to the maiden burning heaven?"*—the *maiden* is the *Dui* trigram, and restraining the Yang Gate only ceases at the *Qian* trigram.

From Yanzhou to Xuzhou,
*"Rising to walk, wearing out cart and ox—
For love of the assembly across the Nine Provinces,
Fire enters Yongzhou in the southwest."*

Explanation: *Yanzhou* is the *Gen* trigram; *Xuzhou* is the *Xun* trigram. The flight of golden essence begins at *Gen* and halts at *Xun*. *"Rising to walk, wearing out cart and ox"*—the *cart* is Yang, the *ox* is Yin, signifying the single qi of the spinal column flying into the *Mud Pill*. The *Nine Provinces* correspond to the heart in the human body and to the *wu* hour in the day, the same as the earlier gathering of medicine. The *southwest* is the *Kun* trigram; *Yongzhou* is the *Qian* trigram. Restraining the Yang Gate ceases from *Kun* to *Qian*, the time of the three-hundredth day of practice.

Direct Explanation: This is the three-hundredth day of practice, the method of flying golden essence, beginning at *Gen* and halting at *Xun*. The assembly of the *Nine Provinces* gathers medicine as before, while restraining the Yang Gate ceases from *Kun* to *Qian*. This is the daily practice, called the *"Three Origins Method"*:
- Flying golden essence into the brain, the Lower Field returns to the Upper Field.
- Gathering medicine, the Lower Field returns to the Middle Field.
- Burning medicine to advance fire, the Middle Field returns to the Lower Field.

This is the *"Three Origins Practice"*, the method of the *Middle Vehicle*—already an Earth Immortal. The signs of verification appear as follows:
At first, one dreams frequently with startling palpitations; the four limbs and six viscera, if afflicted, heal without treatment. In a dark room with eyes closed, a circular radiance like a canopy surrounds the body. The *Golden Gate* and *Jade Lock* are sealed firmly, preventing dreams and leakage.

With a thunderous peal, the joints become interconnected. In dreams, one may embrace an infant and return, or soar freely in flight. The eight pernicious qi cannot invade; the heart’s realm is cleansed, cutting off all passions and desires. Inner vision grows luminous yet unobscured. By day, the spirit’s radiance is clear and refined; by night, the Cinnabar Field warms of itself. All these are signs of having obtained the medicine.

Once the signs are verified as correct, one must diligently regulate practice and, following the previous method, add three hundred more days—then the Embryonic Immortal will be complete. Only after the embryo is perfected may the subsequent practices be undertaken.

**Sixth: The Jade Fluid Returns as Cinnabar**
*(Jade Fluid Refines Form • Bathing the Embryonic Immortal • Minor Return Cinnabar • Major Return Cinnabar • Sevenfold Return Cinnabar • Ninefold Cyclic Cinnabar)*

The *Jade Scripture* states: True Yin and True Yang mutually engender and complete one another. That which manifests above is accumulated Yang forming spirit—within spirit lies form, and that which adorns the heavens is the sun and moon. That which manifests below is accumulated Yin forming shape—within shape lies spirit, and that which adorns the earth is gold and jade. The essence of gold and jade lies hidden within mountains and rivers; their refined and radiant qi floats above. Exchanging brilliance with the sun and moon, grasses and trees receive it to become auspicious omens, while birds and beasts obtain it to become extraordinary species.

The *True Source* says: When Yang ascends to heaven, the Supreme Ultimate generates Yin—Yin is insufficient while Yang is abundant, thus accumulated Yang gives birth to spirit. When Yin descends to earth, the Supreme Ultimate generates Yang—Yang is insufficient while Yin is abundant, thus accumulated Yin gives birth to form. Above, the sun and moon; below, gold and jade. True Yang possesses spirit; True Yin possesses form. Their qi intermingle, shooting upward and downward, filling heaven and earth with light—thus the preciousness of gold and jade arises from this.

Know then that when the qi of gold and jade congeals in the void, it becomes propitious vapors and auspicious clouds; when it enters the earth, it transforms into sweet springs and magic mushrooms. People who receive it become heroes; birds and beasts who obtain it give birth to marvels. Though the essence of gold and jade is born from accumulated Yin’s form, it embraces the qi of True Yang, further influenced by the sun and moon formed from accumulated Yang’s spirit. The downward irradiation of True Yin and True Yang causes treasures to coalesce.

This may be likened to: accumulated Yin forming shape, yet inwardly embracing True Yang to become gold and jade—just as accumulated medicine embraces True Qi to become the Embryonic Immortal. When the qi of gold and jade enters the earth and becomes sweet springs and magic mushrooms, it is like the Jade Fluid returning to the Cinnabar Field. When the qi of gold and jade congeals in the void as propitious vapors and auspicious clouds, it is like qi refining form and substance.

Whenever the qi of gold and jade surges into the heavens, it rises with ascending Yang; whenever it enters the earth, it descends with settling Yin. Since it follows the ascent and descent of Yin and Yang, it naturally possesses the four seasons. Thus, one may return fluid to the Cinnabar Field and refine form with qi, adjusting according to the four seasons—transforming day by day.

The *True Oral Instructions* state: After verifying the effects of gathering and replenishing, choose the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day. Practicing in three periods: after one hundred days, the medicine’s power is complete; after two hundred days, the Sacred Embryo solidifies; after three hundred days, True Qi is born, and the Embryonic Immortal is perfected. Diligently regulate practice, adding time according to the seasons. Only after completing the full three hundred days may one proceed with the method of returning cinnabar and refining form.

In all cases, when using the *Gen* trigram, fly the golden essence into the brain, stopping at the *Xun* trigram—this refers to flying the golden essence after three hundred days. Cease gathering medicine with the *Li* trigram and restrain the Yang Gate with the *Kun* trigram. Only the *Dui* trigram is used to begin restraining the Yang Gate, stopping at the *Qian* trigram. Having ceased the *Li* trigram, add the swallowing method to refine form.

The swallowing method: With the tongue, stir between the upper palate and the two cheeks. First swallow the foul and turbid saliva, then retract the tongue tip to fill the Jade Pool, allowing Jade Pool fluid to generate. Swallow without rinsing.

- During the three months of spring, when Liver Qi is abundant and Spleen Qi is weak, use the *Li* trigram for the swallowing method each day.
- During the three months of summer, when Heart Qi is abundant and Lung Qi is weak, use the *Xun* trigram for the swallowing method each day.
- During the three months of autumn, when Lung Qi is abundant and Liver Qi is weak, use the *Gen* trigram for the swallowing method each day.
- During the three months of winter, when Kidney Qi is abundant and Heart Qi is weak, use the *Zhen* trigram for the swallowing method each day.
*(Flying the golden essence does not interfere with swallowing.)*

During the four seasonal months, when Spleen Qi is abundant and Kidney Qi is weak—since Kidney Qi is the root source, it weakens in all four seasons—during the last eighteen days of each seasonal month, use the *Dui* trigram for the swallowing method daily, combining it with the previous swallowing method. Only in autumn, cease the practice of the *Gen* trigram and use solely the *Dui* trigram swallowing method.

For the above swallowing method, first follow the previous method to swallow. If saliva does not generate between the teeth and the Jade Pool, simply fill the upper and lower mouth with the tongue, close the Jade Pool, draw in the cheeks, and swallow emptily—this is the method. Swallow only qi, for within qi there is naturally water.

Swallowing qi: in the first year (thirty-six to forty-nine times), then the next year (eighty-one times), and the following year (one hundred eighty-one times)—these are the signs of verification, the method of the Jade Fluid returning as cinnabar. Practicing for no more than three years, irrigating the Cinnabar Field, bathing the Embryonic Immortal, True Qi grows ever more abundant.

If practicing this method of the Jade Fluid returning as cinnabar, after three hundred days of nurturing the inner cinnabar, True Qi is just born. When the *Gen* trigram flies the golden essence, striking through the Three Passes to reach the Mud Pill Palace, one should then practice the method of the Golden Fluid returning as cinnabar: from the crown’s center, let a stream of golden water descend to return to the Yellow Court, transforming gold into cinnabar—this is called *"Golden Cinnabar."*

When practicing the Golden Fluid returning as cinnabar, choose a secluded chamber where wind, sunlight, and ordinary people cannot reach. Burn incense, stack the palms, and sit cross-legged. First crouch the body, then rise. As soon as fire arises, sit upright, cutting off thoughts and forgetting emotions. Inwardly observe with precision: the *Gen* trigram flies the golden essence into the crown. Slightly raise the head and tilt the neck back, allowing the neck below to feel like fire. Then nod the head forward, lower the head and curve the neck, retract the tongue tip and press it against the upper palate.

Above flows the pure, cool water, its flavor sweet and fragrant, ascending to pierce the crown’s gate and descending to connect the hundred vessels. From the nose arises naturally the scent of true fragrance; upon the tongue, too, an extraordinary taste. Without rinsing, swallow it down to return to the Yellow Court—this is called *"Golden Fluid returning as Cinnabar."*

Through spring, summer, autumn, and winter, regardless of the hour, only after the golden essence has flown into the brain, proceed with this method in sequence: from *Gen* to *Xun* and no further. For the evening’s *"Restraining the Yang Pass"* method, proceed from *Dui* to *Qian* and no further. In practicing this method, strictly regulate each step beyond what came before—only then may success be attained. Ultimately, this practice refines the form to abide in the world, achieving longevity and deathlessness, yet it cannot transcend the cycle of existence.

The essential teaching of the Dao states:
*Recognize the root and stem of the Five Phases,*
*Then you will know the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.*
*Drink several cups of nectar,*
*Intoxicated, return to wander the Moon Palace.*

Explanation:
*"Recognize the root and stem of the Five Phases"* refers to inverting the Five Phases’ mutual generation and restraint, employing the trigrams at different times to perform the swallowing method. Only then will you understand how spring, summer, autumn, and winter shift the proper hours.
*"Nectar"*: Jade Fluid.
*"Moon Palace"*: The Cinnabar Field.
*"Intoxicated return"*: Swallowing in abundance.

Gazing eastward toward Fusang before dawn breaks,
Rear ascends while front swallows without cease—
Steeds gallop through the cosmos in fiery flight,
The eldest son reaches only Yangzhou.

Explanation:
*"Gazing eastward toward Fusang before dawn breaks"*: Before the sun rises, the time of the Gen trigram.
*"Rear ascends"*: Flying golden essence.
*"Front swallows"*: Jade Fluid returning as elixir.
*"Steeds gallop in fiery flight"*: Jade Fluid refining the form.
*"Wandering the cosmos"*: Filling the four limbs.
*"Eldest son"*: The Zhen trigram.
*"Reaches only Yangzhou"*: The Li trigram.
The refinement of form through Jade Fluid begins with the Zhen trigram and ends only at the Li trigram.

Direct Explanation:
Jade Fluid is the essence of the kidneys. When it ascends to the heart, the two qi merge and pass the Towering Stairs, filling the Jade Pool—this is called "Jade Fluid." If swallowed from the middle field into the lower field, it is called "returning elixir." If it ascends from the middle field into the four limbs, it is called "refining the form," though in truth it is the same substance.

Here, after three hundred days of gathering the medicine, the count is complete and the embryo perfected, while the flying golden essence diminishes by one trigram, and the Yang Barrier is restrained as before. The gathering of medicine ceases, and the swallowing method is added, adjusting with the four seasons.

This pertains to the method of refining the form. After employing the trigrams, refinement of the form is incorporated, beginning with the Zhen trigram and culminating at the Li trigram, without fixed years, months, or days—continuing only until signs manifest:
The body’s complexion becomes radiant, the spirit’s qi refined and graceful;
Gradually averse to foulness, it purges mouth and belly;
Worldly passions and attachments dissolve of themselves.

The true qi nears fullness, and one feels perpetually sated; though little is eaten, wine may be drunk without limit. The mortal bones have already transformed, altering the spirit’s perception. Walking or galloping on horseback, the body moves as if flying. The eyes gleam like polished lacquer, the flesh resembles congealed lard; dark hair regrows, wrinkled skin smooths anew, and the aged forever retain a youthful visage. Gazing upward a hundred paces, one discerns the autumn down; across the body, old scars and blemishes naturally vanish. Tears, saliva, and sweat no longer appear. The sacred elixir generates flavor, the numinous fluid exudes fragrance. Between mouth and nose, true fragrance and rare savor constantly arise. Rinsing with saliva yields a buttery essence, capable of curing others’ illnesses. The entire body transforms into white ointment.

All the above are signs of the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir’s refinement of form. Once these signs manifest, cease practice. Proceed with disciplined effort, following the method in accordance with the seasons to advance further.

**Golden Fluid Returning Elixir (Seventh Stage)**
*(Attached: Golden Fluid Refinement of Form, Igniting Fire to Incinerate the Body, Golden Flowers, Jade Dew Great Completion, Yellow and White Method)*

The *Golden Proclamation* states: Accumulated Yang forms spirit; within spirit lies form. Form arises from the sun, and the sun from the moon. Accumulated Yin forms shape; within shape lies spirit. Spirit arises from metal, and metal from earth. That which follows Yin and Yang in arising and vanishing is the light of sun and moon—its radiance born of the child, its reckoning rooted in Qian and Kun. That which follows Yin and Yang in ascending and descending is the qi of metal and jade—its vitality born of the seasons, its timing rooted in Heaven and Earth.

The *True Source* says: The light of sun and moon employs nine after dawn and six before dusk—six and nine being the numbers of Qian and Kun. The qi of metal and jade ascends in spring and summer, descends in autumn and winter—ascending and descending in accord with Heaven and Earth’s seasons. Metal is born of earth, jade of stone, stone of earth—thus manifesting in form below. Within the sun dwells the Golden Crow, within the moon the Jade Hare; the moon awaits the sun’s soul to shine—thus manifesting in spirit above.

By analogy: Sun and moon correspond to qi; kidney qi to the moon, heart qi to the sun. Metal and jade correspond to fluid; kidney fluid to metal, heart fluid to jade. The so-called *Jade Fluid* originally ascends from kidney qi to the heart, uniting with heart qi. The two qi merge, passing the *Double Towers*, the mouth sealed so that saliva fills the *Jade Pool*. Swallowing it is called *Jade Fluid Returning Elixir*; ascending it is called *Jade Fluid Refinement of Form*. This fluid originates in the kidneys and is born in the heart—akin to the saying that stone arises from earth, and jade from stone.

The so-called *Golden Fluid* arises when kidney qi unites with heart qi without ascending, steaming the lungs. The lungs, as the *Flowery Canopy*, enshroud the two qi. Drawing lung fluid from the *Lower Field* at midday, it ascends from the *Weilü* cavity, called *Flying Golden Essence Entering the Brain*, replenishing the *Mud Pill Palace*. Descending once more to the *Lower Field* is called *Golden Fluid Returning Elixir*. After returning to the *Lower Field*, it ascends again, suffusing the entire body. Rising once more is called *Golden Fluid Refinement of Form*—this, too, aligns with the saying that metal is born of earth.

For those refining form and flying the Golden Essence, practice must occur in a quiet chamber, strictly shielding from wind and sunlight. From afar, burn incense and secretly invoke the Three Pure Ones and Supreme Sages: *"This disciple wishes to abide long in the world, transmitting and practicing the Great Dao, propagating and teaching others. First, I shall personally practice the method of refining form, desiring to become unafraid of cold or heat, abstain from grain, and transcend beyond Yin and Yang."* After the incantation, proceed with swallowing.

The *True Formula* states: Behind the body, the *Weilü* cavity is called the *Lower Pass*; the spine’s sides, the *Middle Pass*; the back of the brain, the *Upper Pass*. Begin flying the Golden Essence to unblock the Three Passes. The kidneys correspond to earth, the heart to heaven—ascending to the crown corresponds to the Nine Heavens. Jade Fluid refinement of form, from heart to crown, unblocks the Nine Heavens. After three hundred days, the great medicine is complete, the immortal embryo perfected, and true qi generated. Rising forward follows the old path of Jade Fluid refinement of form; rising afterward follows the old path of flying Golden Essence. Golden Essence and Jade Fluid, in practice, manifest signs.

Commencing from the Kan trigram, rise once to the crown. Lightly cover both ears with the hands, inwardly observe as prescribed. Gently swallow the saliva, then press the tongue against the teeth, sealing the *Jade Pool* below, awaiting the descent of fluid from the upper palate before swallowing. After swallowing, rise again, culminating at the Gen trigram. In spring and winter, rise once and swallow; in autumn and summer, rise five times and swallow. For each swallow, in autumn and summer, do not exceed fifty counts; in spring and winter, do not exceed one hundred counts. After swallowing, rise forward to suffuse the head, face, four limbs, and fingers until the qi is abundant, then cease. Rise and ascend again, culminating at the Li trigram. Thereafter, rising and swallowing saliva is called *Golden Fluid Returning Elixir*. After the elixir returns, rising forward again is called *Golden Fluid Refinement of Form*. From the Gen trigram onward, refine form until the Li trigram. Restrain the Yang Barrier at the Dui trigram, ceasing at the Qian trigram. Rising afterward to the crown, then descending, is called *Golden Fluid Returning Elixir*. The qi of the Golden Elixir rising forward, from below to above, is called *Golden Fluid Refinement of Form*. When the form manifests jade-like trees and golden flowers—if practicing the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir before reaching the *Lower Origin*, and both forward and backward movements arise—this is called *Fire Igniting to Incinerate the Body*, a stage of Golden Fluid Returning Elixir and refinement of form. Since both forward and backward movements arise, completing the incineration requires strict discipline, unwavering resolve, and ceaseless effort until signs manifest.

The *Essential Dao* says:
*Rise afterward, close the ears all night;*
*Drink golden waves in timely accord, feasting until reaching Qingzhou before halting.*
*At sunset, listen again to the Yang song.*

Explanation: *"Rise afterward, close the ears all night"* refers to practicing the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir. One must guide the fluid and fly the Golden Essence, striking the Three Passes in one motion. As soon as the qi rises, swiftly cover both ears with the hands. The ears are the gates of kidney waves; this prevents kidney qi from leaking outward, ensuring it enters the brain.

When "drinking golden waves in timely accord," once the qi enters the brain, immediately follow the previous method: nod the head, curve the neck, and withdraw the tongue’s tip to press against the upper palate. A clear, sweet fluid will appear, possessing wondrous efficacy—its sweetness like that of honey. At the *Gen* trigram, swallow the flying Golden Essence once, halting only upon reaching the *Zhen* trigram. *Qingzhou* is the *Zhen* trigram. *Sunset* is the *Dui* trigram. "Listen again to the Yang song" means to restrain the Yang Pass from the *Dui* trigram until reaching the *Qian* trigram. In daily practice, use the *Li* trigram; there is no need to gather the medicine.

"After drinking, through the night the fire arises; first ascending, then lifting, the incineration of form is not bound by years or months." Within the day, Heaven and Earth naturally exist. Explanation: This secret is the method of refining form with Golden Fluid. "After drinking, through the night the fire arises" refers to practicing the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir according to the previous method, refining form at the *Gen* trigram—this is the arising of fire. "First ascending, then lifting" means flying the Golden Essence to ignite the fire. During the refinement of form with Jade Fluid, first the Golden Essence rises before and behind to enter the crown, then the Elixir returns, ascending again to refine the form—this differs from the method of refining form with Golden Fluid. When the flying Golden Essence ignites the fire to enter the crown, immediately refine the form by rising forward. When both forward and backward movements arise, it is called "incineration of form." When the fire arises to practice the Returning Elixir, one must follow the seasonal adjustments in quantity. This method is not bound by years, months, days, or hours; it requires only strict discipline, unwavering focus, and seclusion from the world. "Within the day, Heaven and Earth naturally exist" means that before noon, one refines *Qian*, and after noon, one refines *Kun*. In terms of the human body, the abdomen is *Kun*, and the back is *Qian*. Refining *Qian* before noon means flying the Golden Essence from behind to rise forward and refine the form. Refining *Kun* after noon means restraining the Yang Pass from the *Dui* trigram until reaching the *Qian* trigram.

Direct Explanation: The Golden Fluid is the fluid of the lungs. When it contains the Dragon and Tiger and enters the Lower Field, the Great Medicine is about to form—this is called "Golden Fluid." Drawing it from behind the elbow to enter the brain, descending from the upper abdomen to the Lower Field, is called "Returning Elixir." Rising forward again to fill the four limbs, ascending from below, is called "refining form," also known as "refining form into qi." This must be practiced after the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir has refined the form and signs manifest. One should maintain strict discipline and seclusion, burning incense while practicing this method. After the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, refine the form and restrain the Yang Pass in succession. Only after a year or more can one achieve the incineration of form, which is the refinement of form at the *Kan* trigram. In terms of the human body, the abdomen is *Kun*, and the back is *Qian*. Incinerating the form before noon refines *Qian* with Golden Essence; after noon, it refines *Kun* by restraining the Yang Pass. Refining *Qian* ascends from below, with both forward and backward movements arising. In winter and summer, practice the *Jiji* method every three or five days to prevent excess. This ensures the Golden Elixir remains moist—swallowing it amid the arising fire of incineration. Cease only when signs manifest: the inner will becomes pure and lofty, merging with the Great Void; the hun and shen do not wander, banishing dreams and sleep. The Yang essence forms the body, the spirit’s abode becomes firm, and one fears neither cold nor heat through the four seasons. The countenance transforms, and bearing shifts. Even when facing ordinary people, though they may be wealthy or noble, one detects only foulness. When merit and practice are complete, the Three Clarities’ true registers are secretly transmitted. The changes of yin and yang, the fortunes and misfortunes of human affairs—all can be foreknown by the spirit. Gazing upon the dusty and mundane, the heart severs all worldly realms. True qi fills the body, and one abstains from food and drink; extraordinary qi emanates. The golden hue of immortal flesh rivals jade. Wherever one goes or stays, the local spirits naturally appear, obeying commands as if by one’s own will. The true qi becomes purely Yang, capable of refining external mercury.

The above describes the signs of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir and the subsequent refinement of form with Golden Fluid. These are the secrets to attaining eternal life without death.

The Middle Vehicle’s Three Gates pertain to Earth Immortals.

**The Three Gates of the Great Vehicle: Transcending the Mundane to Enter Sagehood**
*Scroll Three*
**Chapter Eight: Refining Qi to Attain the Origin (Transcending the Inner Court, Refining Qi into Form, Purple Gold Elixir, Refining the Yang Spirit, Gathering the Three Flowers at the Crown)**

The *Golden Edict* states: When the primordial qi first divided, the Great Dao took form and established the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes were fixed, the Great Dao acquired names and divided into the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors ruled different lands, each guarding a direction. The five directions held distinct qi, each governed by a child: the Azure Emperor’s children, *Jia* and *Yi*, received the nine qi of Heaven’s true Wood virtue; the Vermilion Emperor’s children, *Bing* and *Ding*, received the three qi of Heaven’s true Fire virtue; the White Emperor’s children, *Geng* and *Xin*, received the seven qi of Heaven’s true Metal virtue; the Black Emperor’s children, *Ren* and *Gui*, received the five qi of Heaven’s true Water virtue; the Yellow Emperor’s children, *Wu* and *Ji*, received the one qi of Heaven’s true Earth virtue. From the one qi, the true arose; from the one true, one cause emerged from Earth. Thus, the myriad things are born and completed in Earth, and the Five Phases are generated and completed in the One. The Dao of true origin is born from the one qi.

The *Jade Book* says: One, three, five, seven, nine—the Dao divides and acquires numbers; Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—the Dao transforms and acquires images; East, West, South, North, Center—the Dao arranges and acquires positions; Azure, White, Red, Yellow, Black—the Dao scatters and acquires substances. Numbers return to the numberless, images revert to the imageless, positions reach the positionless, substances return to the substanceless. To desire the Dao’s numberlessness, do not divide it—then it is numberless. To desire the Dao’s imagelessness, do not transform it—then it is imageless. To desire the Dao’s positionlessness, do not arrange it—then it is positionless. To desire the Dao’s substancelessness, do not scatter it—then it is substanceless. Numberlessness is the Dao’s source; imagelessness is the Dao’s root; positionlessness is the Dao’s truth; substancelessness is the Dao’s subtlety.

The *True Source* says: Once the Dao’s source divided, it descended from the root and flowed to the branches.

One who awakens to its truth cultivates truth through truth—within true, the outer naturally responds as true! One who recognizes its subtlety creates subtlety through subtlety—within subtle, the outer naturally responds as subtle! Heaven and Earth attain the Dao’s truth, yet their truth remains unmanifest, thus they cannot escape having position. Heaven and Earth attain the Dao’s subtlety, yet their subtlety remains unmanifest, thus they cannot escape having substance. With substance, images may be sought; with position, numbers may be deduced. Within Heaven and Earth, amid the myriad things, none is more noble than humankind. Just as Heaven and Earth possess images to be sought, one knows their substance is qi and water; just as Heaven and Earth possess numbers to be deduced, one knows their positions are distant and near. Examining this closely, the Dao is not far from humanity.

For analogy: Heaven and Earth have the Five Emperors, just as humans have the five viscera. The Azure Emperor rules *jia-yi* Wood—*jia* is yang, *yi* is yin—corresponding to the liver’s qi and fluids. The Black Emperor rules *ren-gui* Water—*ren* is yang, *gui* is yin—corresponding to the kidneys’ qi and fluids. The Yellow Emperor rules *wu-ji* Earth—*wu* is yang, *ji* is yin—corresponding to the spleen’s qi and fluids. The Red Emperor rules *bing-ding* Fire—*bing* is yang, *ding* is yin—corresponding to the heart’s qi and fluids. The White Emperor rules *geng-xin* Metal—*geng* is yang, *xin* is yin—corresponding to the lungs’ qi and fluids.

The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter differ, yet the flourishing of the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys follows their months. The *True Formula* states: During the three months of spring, the liver’s qi flourishes. When the liver flourishes, the parents’ true qi, following the celestial movements, resides in the liver. If encountering a Wood day (*jia-yi*) or an Earth day (*wu-ji*, *chen-xu-chou-wei*), at the hours of *chen-xu-chou-wei*, kindle fire in accordance with the time to refine the spleen’s qi. On other days, during the *dui* trigram hours, diminish Metal to deplete the lung’s qi—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *kan* trigram hours, kindle fire in accordance with the method to refine the kidney’s qi. During the *zhen* trigram hours, enter the chamber, inhaling more and exhaling less; breath-holding is best, prolonged closure secondary. Count to one thousand breaths as the measure. At that time, visualize inwardly as prescribed, allowing the mind to darken and the eyes to close—azure light will naturally appear. Gradually ascend the body to enter the *Niwan* palace, from *yin* to *chen* to fill the *zhen* trigram. *(One thousand breaths or more is especially excellent; the goal is for each breath to gradually become faint. If the breath halts, do not continue counting.)*

During the three months of summer, the heart’s qi flourishes. When qi flourishes, the parents’ true qi, following the celestial movements, resides in the heart. If encountering a Fire day (*bing-ding*) or a Metal day (*geng-xin*), during the *dui* trigram hours, kindle fire in accordance with the method to refine the lung’s qi. On other days, during the *kan* trigram hours, diminish Water to deplete the kidney’s qi—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *zhen* trigram hours, kindle fire in accordance with the method to refine the liver’s qi. During the *li* trigram hours, enter the chamber and practice as before—crimson light will naturally appear. Gradually ascend the body to enter the *Niwan* palace, from *si* to *wei* to fill the *li* trigram. *(One thousand breaths or more is especially excellent; the method is as described above.)*

In autumn’s three months, the lung’s qi flourishes. When the lung’s qi flourishes, the parents’ true qi, following the celestial movements, resides in the lung. If encountering a Metal day (*geng-xin*) or a Wood day (*jia-yi*), during the *zhen* trigram hours, kindle fire in accordance with the method to refine the liver’s qi. On other days, during the *li* trigram hours, diminish Fire to deplete the heart’s qi—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *xun* trigram hours, kindle fire in accordance with the method to refine the spleen’s qi. During the *dui* trigram hours, enter the chamber and practice as before—white light will naturally appear. Gradually ascend the body to enter the *Niwan* palace, from *shen* to *xu* to fill the *dui* trigram.

In winter’s three months, the kidney’s qi flourishes. When the kidney’s qi flourishes, the parents’ true qi, following the celestial movements, resides in the kidney. If encountering a Water day (*ren-gui*) or a Fire day (*bing-ding*), during the *li* trigram hours, kindle fire in accordance with the method to refine the heart’s qi. On other days, during the *chen-xu-chou-wei* hours, diminish Earth to deplete the spleen’s qi—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *dui* trigram hours, kindle fire in accordance with the method to refine the lung’s qi. During the *kan* trigram hours, enter the chamber and practice as before—black light will naturally appear. Gradually ascend the body to enter the *Niwan* palace, from *hai* to *chou* to fill the *kan* trigram.

Explanation: In spring, refine the liver for a thousand breaths, and blue-green qi will emerge. During the last eighteen days of spring, one need not practice as before; simply abide by the method of settled breathing, sitting in stillness all day to nurture the spleen and refine one’s true qi. Only then, during the *kan* trigram hours, kindle fire to refine the kidney, lest the true qi be depleted. In summer, refine the heart for a thousand breaths, and crimson qi will emerge. During the last eighteen days of summer, one need not practice as before; simply abide by the method of settled breathing, sitting in stillness all day, refining as before. Only then, during the *zhen* trigram hours, kindle fire as before. In autumn, refine the liver for a thousand breaths, and white qi will emerge. During the last eighteen days of autumn, one need not practice as before; simply abide by the method of settled breathing, sitting in stillness all day, nurturing and refining as before. Only then, during the *xun* trigram hours, kindle fire as before. In winter, refine the kidney for a thousand breaths, and black qi will emerge. During the last eighteen days of winter, one need not practice as before; simply abide by the method of settled breathing, sitting in stillness all day, nurturing and refining as before. Only then, during the *dui* trigram hours, kindle fire as before, until yellow qi forms a radiance, and one silently observes myriad Daoist paths encircling the body.

The method of settled breathing does not lie in forcefully holding or tightly closing the breath. Rather, it should be continuous as if present, employed without strain. From existence, one enters non-existence, allowing it to abide naturally. The method of gathering the medicine involves holding the saliva and clasping the hands to press the heart, ensuring the true qi does not scatter.

When entering the chamber, one must close the door in a secluded and quiet dwelling, far from chickens, dogs, women, and all disturbing influences. The eyes should be slightly open, just enough to discern objects. Avoid drafts and direct sunlight, and ensure no sounds intrude from either side. One should empty the heart and still all thoughts, casting aside all worldly concerns. Both internally and externally, one must be utterly serene, allowing nothing to disturb the mind. For the yang spirit is newly gathered and the true qi only just congealed, one must tend to it as a newborn, not yet mature. Morning and evening, burn incense, kneel, and bow in reverence: first to Heaven, second to the Heavenly Immortals, and third to the Earthly Immortals. After completing these three bows, sit in stillness, forgetting all scheming, and proceed with this method. One must also follow the preceding method step by step to witness its effects. If one mistakes this for the Dao itself, one may labor in vain and never achieve success, merely allowing the yin po to leave the body and become a ghostly immortal.

The essential teaching of the Dao states: In practicing this method, one is not bound by years, months, days, or hours. Simply follow the preceding method until signs of verification appear, and then cease. The qi will manifest naturally, but one must be diligent and unwavering, forsaking all external affairs. Remain in the chamber, focus the mind, and gauge the proper times. Employ two pure yang youths or cultivate a bond with disciples, engaging in mutual exchange and support for a thousand days to complete one cycle of qi. One gains tenfold in one hundred days, and in five hundred days, the qi is complete. One may then practice inner observation, gather the yang spirit, and merge with the celestial spirits. Refining the spirit to unite with the Dao, one enters sagehood and transcends the mundane.

The verification of refining qi lies in feeling the body utterly at ease, often ascending as if borne aloft. The elixir’s light penetrates the bones, and an extraordinary fragrance fills the chamber. Next, in stillness, one gazes outward to see purple clouds filling the eyes. Looking downward from the crown of the head, a golden light envelops the body—strange and wondrous signs of verification are too numerous to record.

**Inner Observation and Transformation (Ninth Section: Gathering the Yang Spirit, Heaven-Scaling Fire, Exchanging Mortal for Immortal, True Emptiness, the Celestial Realm of Huaxu)**

The *Golden Edict* states: The Great Dao has no form; it dwells within qi. The Dao is vast beyond all bounds, containing nothing. The Great Dao has no function; it operates through things. Its depth is unfathomable, and its principles are beyond investigation. Speaking of the Dao in terms of form, it begins to have distinctions of inner and outer. Speaking of the Dao in terms of function, it establishes the foundation for observation and perception. Observing the inner without observing the outer, nothing external remains unexamined, and the inner becomes clear. Observing the spirit without observing the form, no aspect of form is left unperfected, and the spirit becomes visible.

The *True Source* states: With one heart, observe the myriad things, and the myriad things are not said to be excessive. With the myriad things disturbing the one qi, the one qi is not said to be insufficient. When the one qi returns to the one heart, the heart cannot be seized by things. When the one heart moves the one qi, the qi cannot be enslaved by methods. When the heart’s source is clear and penetrating, one illumination shatters ten thousand illusions, and one forgets the existence of things. When the qi’s struggle is firm and strong, ten thousand stimuli are stilled in a single breath, and one forgets the existence of methods. Thing after thing, no thing remains—thus returning to the original image. Method after method, no method remains—thus preserving the true self-attained reality.

This analogy states: From images, forms arise; from forms, names are established. With names, one infers their numbers; with numbers, one grasps their principles. Yet the loftiest and most empty is beyond all things and cannot be compared. The only possible comparison is to one who cultivates and refines. The seasons proceed without error, and accomplishments follow in order.

The qi of harmony congeals and does not disperse. The true nature of utmost emptiness is tranquil and free from striving. The spirit unites with the Dao, returning to spontaneity. At this moment, taking non-mind as mind—how then can one speak of responding to things? Taking non-thing as thing—how then can one speak of employing methods? True joy abounds, and one forgets the existence of one’s own body. Gradually entering the Dao of non-action, one reaches the realm of the imperceptible and inaudible, becoming a guest who enters sagehood and transcends the mundane.

The true formula states: This method accords with the Dao, resembling the principle of visualization as commonly described, or like the moment when a Chan monk enters samādhi. One should choose an auspicious site to establish a chamber, kneel in reverence, burn incense, sit upright with legs crossed, let the hair down and robes loose, clench the fists to retain spirit, and close the eyes to still the mind. Before noon, gently raise the body to kindle the fire and refine the qi. After noon, slightly gather the body to gather the fire and forge the elixir. Regardless of day or night, with spirit clear and qi harmonious, joy arises naturally. If sounds are heard during meditation, do not listen; if visions appear, do not acknowledge them, and the external phenomena will disperse of their own accord. Should one acknowledge these phenomena, demonic obstacles will only intensify. If demonic obstacles do not recede, swiftly lean the body slightly forward, then straighten the waist; afterward, slightly arch the chest without straightening the waist. After a brief pause, the fire will rise high before and behind—do not move the body. This is called "firing the body." When the fire subsides, demonic obstacles will disperse beyond the frame, and yin evil will not enter the shell. Repeat this two or three times.

One should visualize all between heaven and earth as a blazing fire. Once the fire subsides, all is cool and clear, leaving nothing behind. Yet one sees carriages and horses, song and dance, canopies and silken banners, wealth and splendor, crowds of joyous people forming ranks and processions. Five-colored clouds ascend, as if ascending to the celestial realm. Upon arrival, one beholds towering pavilions amid verdant peaks, courtyards stretching endlessly, pearls and gold scattered ungathered upon the ground, gardens and pavilions, flowers and fruits, pools and terraces beyond count. Suddenly, rare fragrances arise on all sides, and the sounds of music and revelry fill the air. Guests and friends fill the seats, a feast of land and sea is laid out, laughter and conversation abound, all celebrating great peace. Precious treasures are exchanged as gifts. At this moment, though these are not the armies of yin ghosts or demons, one must not regard them as auspicious events.

For those who cultivate the true, having renounced worldly affairs and willingly embraced solitude—whether concealing themselves by rivers and lakes or withdrawing to secluded corners—all thoughts and emotions are severed, and every action is governed by precepts. After enduring hardship and experiencing freedom, once the work is accomplished and the method established, one may witness such splendor. Yet if one does not recognize these as demonic illusions but instead believes they have truly arrived in the celestial palace, unaware that shedding the mortal form occurs within the celestial palace atop one’s own head, and thus becomes attached, taking these visions as reality, failing to apply the method of transcendence—then the yang spirit will remain trapped within the body, and the immortal embryo will not transform. One may emerge above the dark paths to become a terrestrial immortal, merely attaining longevity without death, yet unable to shed the mortal frame and ascend as an immortal, returning to the Three Isles to become a celestial being. This is truly lamentable.

Disciples must consider that though transcendence is difficult, it cannot be neglected. The essential teaching states: There is no inexhaustible method, for it has already been reduced to its essence.

**Chapter Ten: Transcending and Shedding the Form**
*(Emerging and Entering the Form, Immortal Shedding the Mortal Frame, Transcending the Mundane and Entering Sagehood)*

The *Golden Edict* states: The Dao is fundamentally non-being; to speak of it as being is not the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally empty; to speak of it as substantial is not the Dao. Since it is formless, neither questioning nor responding can reach it; since it is imageless, neither seeing nor hearing can grasp it. If one takes the mysterious and subtle as the Dao, the mysterious and subtle still cannot escape the burden of question and answer. If one takes the imperceptible and inaudible as the Dao, the imperceptible and inaudible still cannot avoid the burden of seeing and hearing. If even the imperceptible and inaudible, the mysterious and subtle, are not the Dao, then the Dao is beyond all knowing.

The *Jade Scripture* states: Its coming has a beginning, yet who knows the beginning of the great Dao? Its going has an end, yet who knows the end of the great Dao? Though there is an "above" beyond the highest, who knows that the great Dao’s above has no limit? Though there is a "below" beneath the deepest, who knows that the great Dao’s below has no end? The Dao, unfathomable and nameless, arranges ranks and distinctions according to what beings attain. The Dao of non-action cannot be fully explored.

The true formula states: To *transcend* is to rise beyond the mortal frame and enter the rank of sages. To *shed* is to cast off the mundane embryo and become an immortal. It is the spirit entering the qi-embryo, the qi completing the true nature. Only when prior efforts have borne verification at every step should one reside in a chamber of purity to enter the realm of the imperceptible and inaudible. Inwardly observe and recognize the yang spirit, then kindle the fire to subdue demons, firing the body to gather qi. The true qi ascends to the celestial palace, and the shell becomes utterly pure, leaving nothing behind.

One should choose a secluded dwelling, abide by inward observation, and after the three bows are completed, sit upright without rising or adjusting the posture. Close the eyes and still the mind. When stillness reaches its utmost, the body seems to float in empty space. Spirit and qi drift freely, difficult to restrain. In silent inward observation, clarity shines unobscured. Mountains and rivers appear resplendent, pavilions faintly discernible, purple qi and crimson light swirling in formation, auspicious simurghs and colorful phoenixes singing like reed pipes. The wondrous scenes and splendor may be called the true delight of the pot, the separate realm of the grotto-heaven—carefree and at ease, utterly unaware of the burdens of the dusty world.

At this moment of true emptiness, the qi transforms of its own accord, without need for methods or adherence to time. If one sees green qi emerging from the east, with the sounds of reed pipes and drums, banners, carriages, and horses appearing left and right, front and back, in countless numbers—then suddenly, red qi emerges from the south, white qi from the west, black qi from the north, and yellow qi from the center.

The five qi converge and coalesce into iridescent clouds, while joyous music resounds in a clamor, and blissful qi radiates warmth. Golden lads and jade maidens support and escort one’s self, or one rides a fiery dragon, mounts a dark crane, straddles a colorful simurgh, or bestrides a fierce tiger, ascending into the void. From below to above, wherever one passes, pavilions and temples stretch beyond description, while divine officials and spirits defy enumeration. Arriving at another place, ten thousand rows of female musicians stand in array, and officials form ranks like the court of an earthly emperor, with sages and worthies all in attendance.

At this moment, one sees all as if no one else exists, riding upward until reaching a gate where guards stand solemn and inviolable. On all sides, officials and female musicians linger with reluctance, yet ultimately, one cannot pass through the gate. Canopies cover one’s face as one descends from above, returning to the former dwelling. Such ascents and descents occur countless times without weariness—this is the method of harmonizing the spirit to exit the shell. With days of accumulated practice, one ascends in a single bound to the celestial palace and descends in one motion to the original place. Up and down, there is no obstruction, as if ascending from below to above. It may resemble climbing a seven-tiered pagoda or ascending a three-story jade tower: at first, one climbs step by step, and upon reaching the seventh tier, one must not look down, lest the spirit be startled and cling to the body, refusing to depart. Once atop the seventh tier, one closes the eyes and leaps as if in sleep or waking—there is a body beyond the body. Its form resembles an infant, with fresh and radiant skin, its spirit luminous and bright. Looking back at the former body, one sees nothing of it, only what appears as a dung heap or withered wood, evoking endless shame and disgust. Yet one cannot immediately abandon it and wander far, for the spirit’s departure is not yet perfected, and the sagely qi has congealed to form it. One must re-enter the original body, coming and going freely, roaming at will. At first, one may take but one or two steps, then two or three *li*. With days of accumulated practice, one may stretch forth like a warrior, traversing a thousand or ten thousand *li*. The form and spirit grow robust, and courage becomes unshakable. Only then may one entrust the mortal frame to the great mountains and rivers, dwelling beyond the comings and goings of the world, no longer equaling the common folk. When one’s conduct is complete, one receives the celestial writ, riding simurghs and phoenixes, straddling tigers and mounting dragons, traveling east and west to enter the Purple Palace. First, one meets the True Lord of the Grand Tenuity, then resides on the lower isles. To ascend to the grotto-heaven, one must transmit the Dao and accumulate merit among mortals, receive the celestial writ, and ascend to the grotto-heaven as a celestial immortal.

Few in ancient or modern times have succeeded in this practice. Some, lacking sufficient merit, seek swift attainment and thus pursue this path; others, though their merits remain unproven, merely engage in quiet sitting, hoping for transcendence. If residual yin spirits do not disperse, they may become ghostly immortals, unseen by others, coming and going without fixed abode, ultimately forced to seize mortal bodies and be reborn as humans. Or, if one’s comings and goings are unskilled and without method, departing and returning without means to re-enter the original body, the spirit may wander without destination—this is the sitting transformation of Buddhist monks or the corpse liberation of Daoist adepts. Thus, in practicing this path, one must first ensure that prior merits are verified and appropriate, then select a secluded place to build a chamber, far from all foul and putrid things, noxious vapors, passing sounds, and the allure of women. Not only do these disturb the true qi, but the spirit itself grows weary of them. If one exits and re-enters, entering without exiting, then form and spirit become wondrous, attaining the lifespan of heaven and earth, enduring through eons without death. If one enters and exits, exiting without re-entering, it is like the cicada shedding its husk, transforming the spirit to attain sageliness. This is transcending the mundane and shedding the vulgar, becoming a true person and immortal, dwelling beyond the dusty world on the isles of the Three Mountains.

The essential Dao states: "The inexhaustible Dharma has already ceased and stilled."

The above are the secrets of transcending the mundane and entering sageliness, belonging to the Great Vehicle’s three gates of celestial immortality.

*Scripture of the Nine Grades of Immortals* (Scroll Nine)

**Preface to the *Collected Scriptures: Scripture of the Nine Grades of Immortals***

I am a *jinshi* of the Tang dynasty. From past lives, I have been devoted to the Dao, and by the grace of Master Zhengyang, I was led into the Zhongnan Mountains and initiated into the Mystery Gate. From that moment, I vowed to ferry all sentient beings across. Once this great vow was uttered, regret came too late.

I have heard that the highest mysteries of Heaven and Earth are boundless in their wondrous workings. Heaven is lofty, Earth profound—mystery begets mystery. The Three Teachings share a single principle, yet deluded mortals fail to grasp it. The Void gives birth to the formless, and from there, one returns to the origin.

By the grace of Master Zhengyang, I was transmitted the Golden Elixir. After twelve years, I ascended and paid homage before the August Emperor. Moved by compassion, the Emperor commanded me to descend to the mortal realm and universally deliver the deluded. Yet the deluded remained unmoved, so I manifested in person and left behind the *Scripture of the Eight Grades of Immortals*: two scrolls in Guangling, two in Jinling, two in Piling, and one each in Linjiang and Xinzhou—eight in total.

Later, by imperial decree, I descended again to the Jishui River to open the hearts of mortals. Still, they remained ignorant, so I bestowed upon them the oracle of the planchette. In the year *wuzǐ*, I was commanded to compile the *Scripture of the Nine Grades of Immortals* and the *Precious Repentance Sutra for Extracting the Heart*. Though five regions had received the eight scrolls, one was missing. Later, Pan Yanjǐ of Huaiyang completed the ninth, along with the *Precious Repentance*.

The Jade Writ was bestowed upon the Azure Spirit Perfected, who retrieved it from the Jishui River to guide sentient beings into the Dao. One must revere Heaven and Earth, sovereign and parents, and teachers, and uphold benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust.

To disrespect Heaven invites thunder, lightning, and torrential rains that drown all in chaos. To disrespect Earth brings corpses to the waters, their bodies manifesting as ducks and geese. To be unfilial to parents ensures that neither Heaven nor Earth will tolerate you, and you shall suffer for ten thousand kalpas. To be disloyal to the sovereign brings ruin to the state and deceit to the ruler, and you shall later sink into the depths. To disregard the teachings of your master is to invite the cycles of Heaven and Earth, from which awakening is nearly impossible to escape.

That which Heaven decrees as human nature cannot depart from principle. To depart from principle is to stray from the Dao. Only when principle and the Dao are practiced in harmony does one fulfill human propriety!

Righteousness (*yì*) is to revere Heaven and Earth, honor one’s superiors, and avoid the Five Transgressions. Propriety (*lǐ*) is to uphold integrity, shame, modesty, and a sense of honor—neither losing respect among one’s village nor among the common folk—revering Heaven, honoring Earth, being filial to parents, and compassionate to the young. Wisdom (*zhì*) is the highest wisdom of the formless and unified *qi*, the middle wisdom of serving the state, and the lower wisdom of human relations. Trust (*xìn*) is to be true to Heaven and Earth, true to the state, true to one’s kin, and never break faith with the young. These are the bonds of human relations.

Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—I open the eyes of the deluded, lead them out of the mundane, and guide sentient beings into the Mystery Gate. First, revere Heaven, and Heaven will send down auspiciousness, for Heaven is pure. Revere Earth, and Earth will bring forth the myriad things, for Earth is at peace. Naturally, a hundred plants will sprout, and the five grains will flourish.

In human relations, one must cultivate good thoughts, avoid the gates of hell, escape the paths of delusion, depart the mundane, ascend the path of awakening, penetrate the Great Dao, emerge from the sea of suffering, and illuminate the formless. Through gradual refinement, one may transcend and join the ranks of immortals.

This preface to the *Scripture of the Nine Grades of Immortals* was left by me personally. The disciples of the Returning to Truth Assembly, Zhen Zhang, Zhao Shan, and others, in the year *jiǎwǔ*, vowed at the White Crane Abbey to carve and publish the immortal scriptures.

If mortals seek the Dao, let them not speak of the distance of a thousand miles—with sincere hearts, how can the ten thousand *li* to Zhongnan be called far? Those who request my immortal scriptures shall see all their endeavors succeed and all their fortunes align.

The nine numinous talismans sweep away demons, eradicate the roots of calamity in the human realm, and guide one into the wondrous gate of Heaven and Earth. Uphold human relations with benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. Have faith in the Dao, and above, refine your essence and spirit.

The Three Teachings all possess these truths—there is no room for doubt or hesitation. To print the scriptures is to print the heart; to carve the scriptures is to carve the Dao. Once the human Dao is accomplished, the immortal Dao may be achieved! How could one not find contentment between Heaven and Earth, preserving this for the deluded of later generations?

Above, it is unfathomable in its literary grace; below, it does not stray from propriety. To have one’s name inscribed in the immortal register, to have nine generations ascend to Heaven—how could this not be joyous!

I, now ranked among the immortals, have personally penned this.

**The Ninth Scroll of the *Scriptures of the Mysterious Origin of the Most High***

At that time, the Great Emperor of Pure Yang was in the Heaven of Tuṣita, the Palace of Pure Emptiness. Seated in full-lotus, holding a *rúyì*, he sat in serene silence. The divine immortals of the myriad heavens, the thunder and fire departments, the city gods and village altars—all stood in solemn attendance.

The Great Emperor spoke: "By the decree of the August Emperor, I have traversed the nine continents to universally deliver the deluded, propagate the Great Dao, and lead all to right awakening. Yet for the sake of sentient beings, who remain deluded and unenlightened, I have now proclaimed the eight scrolls of the immortal scriptures: one in Guangling, two in Jinling, three in Piling, four in Xinzhou, and five in Linjiang—eight in total, serving as a bridge for the world.

Of the multitude of sentient beings, only one or two in a hundred believe, while those who slander are beyond counting. By the Emperor’s command, embodying the virtue of cherishing life and the benevolence of universal salvation, I earnestly admonish and clearly expound. Yet sentient beings are as deaf and blind, provoking the wrath of the August Emperor. Disasters of flood, fire, blade, and warfare, plagues and locusts, have left people with no means to live. Fathers and sons, brothers, husbands and wives, flesh and blood—all are scattered and lost.

The deluded remain unrepentant, instead harboring resentment. Witnessing such obstinacy, I am deeply moved with pity. Thus, I tirelessly descend into the dusty mortal realm, manifesting in countless forms to expound the Dao and deliver beings from the roots of suffering. Yet sentient beings, ignorant of the profound mysteries, speak and act recklessly, slandering the Dao and its teachings.

Though I do not reproach them, I redouble my efforts to awaken them. But sentient beings, ensnared by profit, desire, and emotional attachments, have forgotten their original nature. They are disloyal, unfilial, unkind, undutiful, unjust, deceitful, untrustworthy, and unrighteous."

Only seeking advantage for oneself, heedless of the harm left for others; ever pursuing warmth and fullness for oneself, unmindful of lord, kin, or brothers. The widowed, orphaned, solitary, and bereft—one callously poisons and harms them. Defying the sages and worthies, scorning the people of heaven. Major transgressions go uncorrected; minor virtues remain undone. Idle chatter, seductive speech, harsh words, and double tongues. Such manifold karmic obstructions cast one into pits and snares, yet still one fails to awaken to the gravity of life and death, to the swiftness of impermanence. Once fallen into the wheel of rebirth, the human form is hard to regain. The three evil destinies and six paths lead to the Avīci hell—though one may seek to repent and reform, to whom can one turn for deliverance?

In the boundless realm of suffering, only the Dao can uplift. Pure and true, empty and luminous, it abides in the vastness of the great void, free from the distinctions of self and other—only then can one perceive the Primordial Ultimate. Yet sentient beings remain benighted, as if dreaming, as if drunk. Drunkenness may yet pass, dreams may yet be awakened from—why then do sentient beings remain so utterly oblivious? The Dao is before their very eyes.

The Three Teachings share one insight: the Confucians call it "holding to the center," the Buddhists call it "emptiness within," while in our Dao, it is simply "guarding the center." Thus, the Confucians "preserve the heart and nurture nature"; the Buddhists, "illumine the heart and perceive nature"; while in our Dao, we "cultivate the heart and refine nature." In cultivating the heart, loyalty and filial piety are perfected, and none—lord, kin, or brothers—are left unsuited. In refining nature, one abides in contentment and endures humiliation, neither exposing others' faults nor flaunting one's own strengths.

In governing the state and ordering the family, only impartiality and uprightness prevail. Reverence moves the Lord on High, and water and fire cannot encroach. Bandits and thieves vanish; illness and plague do not arise. The sword is forever stilled; fathers and sons reunite, flesh and blood remain unsevered. Precious grains and fine ears flourish; timely winds and seasonable rains come. Blessings and prosperity abound; calamities and omens dissolve. The nation enjoys eternal peace; the people dwell in constant joy.

Heed my words: cultivate truth and enter the Dao, that together we may ascend the other shore and transcend life and death. Once, in Guangling, they slandered our great Dao, mocked the Lord on High, reviled immortals and cursed buddhas, disparaged sages and rejected worthies—thus bringing down destruction. Though I could not save them, I deeply pitied their fate. Therefore, I journeyed to the Huai and the sea to ferry those lost in the ford of delusion.

Let sentient beings take heed: strive to do good, lest you err to your own ruin. The sins you amass will be as mountains—beware, beware! Turn from evil and practice the Way.

The Master of Pure Emptiness knelt and kowtowed, saying: "By what name is the Dao known? I humbly beseech Your illumination, that all sentient beings may awaken and find the path to the gate."

The Great Emperor replied: "A profound question indeed! Listen with utmost attention, purify your heart and still your thoughts."

All the celestial immortals and divine spirits bowed in reverence before the vermilion court. The Great Emperor radiated a great light, the Three Flowers gathering at his crown, the Five Qi returning to their origin. For the celestial palaces, the thunder-fire citadels, and the earthly altars, he expounded the Dao, saying:

"That which establishes Heaven and Earth and nurtures the myriad things is called the Dao.
That which illumines the sun and moon and generates the Five Phases is called the Dao.
That which is more numerous than the sands of the Ganges is called the Dao.
That which alone shines, solitary and without peer, is called the Dao.
That which opens the primordial chaos and returns to the primordial vastness is called the Dao.
That which seizes the workings of creation and transcends life and death is called the Dao.
That which abides in the lowly and filthy yet is supremely noble is called the Dao.
That which dwells in darkness yet attains the utmost brilliance is called the Dao.
That which enters the tiniest speck of dust is called the Dao.
That which encompasses Heaven and Earth is called the Dao.
That which moves from being into non-being is called the Dao.
That which enables one to become a buddha or an immortal is called the Dao.

*'The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.'*

Every word of my scriptures conveys the profound truth. You must contemplate them carefully, proclaim them widely to the world, and awaken the deluded multitudes."

Then he spoke this gatha:

Great indeed, most wondrous is the Dao,
Giving birth to Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things.
Filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust—
These are the great canons for humanity.
Strive in practice, never grow lax,
For when the root is firm, the Dao is born.
Swords and weapons shall never bring calamity,
Water and fire shall never assail.
Tigers shall slumber in the southern mountains,
Dragons shall return to the northern seas.
You must master the spirit and guide the qi,
Refine the qi to cultivate the true essence.
Essence transforms into spirit, returning to emptiness,
And leads you to worship the Supreme Clarity.
Transcending the Three Realms,
Beyond the Five Phases of the world,
Each step summons wind and clouds,
Each word startles ghosts and spirits.
When the heart is pure and limpid,
Nine generations of ancestors ascend.
Heed well my words—
Within this lies the Great Dao."

When the Great Emperor finished speaking the gatha, all the celestial generals, divine marshals, and immortal disciples rose in reverence, filled with boundless joy.

The Great Emperor said: "My scripture in eight fascicles has been transmitted in the world for ages, yet few have widely believed in it. Now, Pan Yangji of Shanggu wishes to propagate its profound mysteries, to widely transmit the Great Dao, and to receive and circulate the scripture. Wherever this scripture resides, all the celestial immortals, divine generals, the thunder and fire departments, city gods, and village altars shall naturally provide protection."

All the celestial generals bowed in assent and withdrew.

Praise says:
To save the kalpa and prolong the sun and moon’s days,
To return the soul and restore life to the Purple Cloud Realm—
The floating net’s precious canopy joins with the vast primordial harmony,
The wondrous Dharma’s radiance defies all measure.

The Boundless Great Dao,
The Primordial Dharma King—
A single pearl of treasure lies at the center,
Expounding the Dharma and emitting auspicious light.
Universally unfolding the golden scriptures,
All sages bow to the Void Sovereign—*(repeated line)*
