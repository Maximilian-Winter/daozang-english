# 黄帝阴符经注（唐李筌）

**Yin Fu Jing** *(Attributed to the Yellow Emperor)*

Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp its operations—exhausted is the task.
Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them flourish.
The five thieves dwell within the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s workings;
the cosmos lies in the hand, all things spring from the body.

Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism;
establish Heaven’s Dao to govern humanity.

When Heaven unleashes its killing intent, stars shift in their courses;
when Earth unleashes its killing intent, dragons and serpents rise from the land;
when humanity unleashes its killing intent, Heaven and Earth invert;
when Heaven, Earth, and humanity unite in intent, the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.

Nature has skill and clumsiness, which may be concealed.
The nine orifices’ malice lies in the three vital passages—
movement and stillness are within reach.

Fire arises from wood; when calamity strikes, it conquers;
deceit arises in the realm; when its time comes, it collapses.
To know this and refine it—this is called the Sage.

Heaven, Earth, and all things are thieves;
all things are humanity’s thieves;
humanity is the thief of all things.

The three thieves harmonized, the Three Powers secure.
Thus it is said:
Eat in season, and the hundred bones align;
stir the mechanism, and all transformations rest.

Humanity knows its spirit as spirit, yet does not know
how the unspiritual becomes spirit.

Sun and moon have their numbers, great and small have their limits—
from this, the Sage’s work arises, and divine clarity emerges.

Its thieving mechanism—none under Heaven cannot see it,
none under Heaven cannot know it.
The noble one who attains it preserves himself;
the petty one who attains it risks his life.

The blind excel in hearing, the deaf in sight.
Sever one source of profit, and tenfold troops are needed;
three reversals of day and night, and ten thousand troops are needed.

The heart is born from things, dies from things—the mechanism lies in the eyes.
Heaven, though without favor, gives rise to favor;
swift thunder and fierce winds—all respond in blind obedience.

Supreme joy leaves excess, supreme stillness is austere.
Heaven’s utmost selfishness becomes the utmost public good.
Life’s decree rests in *qi*.

The dead are the root of the living; the living, the root of the dead.
Favor arises from harm, harm from favor.

The foolish take Heaven’s patterns as sacred wisdom;
I take the timing of things as the philosopher’s pattern.

**Commentary on the *Yin Fu Jing*** *(Tang Dynasty)* — **Li Quan**

**The Chapter on the Daoist Immortals Embracing Unity**

Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp its practice—this is all.
Thus Heaven has five *accomplices* (贼), and those who perceive them flourish.

*Annotation*: The Yellow Emperor discerned the *accomplices’* timing (机), ascending in broad daylight.
The Shang and Zhou dynasties grasped the *accomplices’* divine verification (验), using the lesser to subdue the greater.
Guan Zhong understood the *accomplices’* temporal trust (信), uniting the feudal lords nine times.
Fan Li seized the *accomplices’* urgency of affairs (物), conquering the South.
Zhang Liang obtained the *accomplices’* merit of favor (功), defeating mighty Chu.

The five *accomplices* reside in the heart, manifesting in Heaven.
The cosmos lies within the grasp; ten thousand transformations arise from the body.

*Annotation*: Man lives by the five flavors, dies by the five flavors.
Each flavor has its master—harmonizing them brings life, opposing them brings destruction.
Prolonged indulgence accumulates *qi* that corrupts the five viscera, nearing annihilation.
Thus mortals cannot complete their natural lifespan—because their indulgence in life is excessive.

Hence, the Supreme Dao is insipid, embryonic breathing without taste.
The arts of the immortals number a hundred, yet their essence lies in embracing unity and holding the center.
The arts of the maiden number a hundred, yet their essence lies in returning essence and refining *qi*.
The arts of the Golden Elixir number a hundred, yet their essence lies in divine water and the Flowering Pool.
The arts of governance number a hundred, yet their essence lies in purity and self-transformation.
The arts of war number a hundred, yet their essence lies in stratagem and counter-stratagem.

These five arts—when rolled up, are hidden in the heart, concealed in the spirit;
when applied, they pervade Heaven, nourish Earth.
The cosmos in an instant lies within human grasp;
the flourishing and withering of all things arise from the body.

The Yellow Emperor attained this, first securing the Three Palaces, then governing the myriad lands—
when the tripod was complete, he rode the dragon and ascended to Heaven.

Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism.
Establish the Dao of Heaven to determine humanity.
When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, stars shift their lodges;
when Earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land;
when humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse.
When Heaven and humanity unleash together, the foundation of ten thousand changes is set.

*Annotation*: Great chaos and disorder, war, flood, drought, and locusts—these are Heaven’s killing mechanisms.
Yu the Great and Shun tilled the fields, Yu of Xia rescued the drowned, the Shang dynasty imprisoned the Xia on Tai, the Zhou imprisoned the Shang at Youli, the Han founder was a market warden, and Wei Wu was a beggar—
all were not born to royal station, yet they seized Heaven’s killing mechanism and rose from obscurity to rule.

The virtuous man lingers in the wilds, the petty man holds office, powerful ministers wield authority, and the people yearn for chaos—
this is humanity’s killing mechanism.
Tang overthrew Jie, Wu of Zhou attacked Zhou, Xiang Yu beheaded the infant Hujia, and Cao Wei deposed Emperor Xian—
these were seizing humanity’s killing mechanism.

To overturn nobility into lowliness, to reverse lowliness into nobility—
this is like Heaven and Earth reversing.
When Heaven and humanity’s mechanisms unite, the logic of success and failure is inevitable.
Ten thousand changes, a thousand transformations—
the sage follows them to establish his foundation.

Skill and clumsiness in nature can be concealed.

*Annotation*: When inner desire does not emerge, it is called *opening* (启);
when external evils do not enter, it is called *closing* (闭).
Inner opening is its mechanism.
Mysterious as *yin*, unmoving as a mountain—
the nature of skill and clumsiness makes it impossible for the idle to glimpse.

The nine orifices’ evils lie in the three essentials, which can be moved or stilled.

*Annotation*: Two leaves covering the eyes cannot see Tai Mountain;
two beans blocking the ears cannot hear thunder;
a single pepper touching the tongue cannot speak.
If all nine orifices are corrupted, they are insufficient to discern changes.
Yet in the three essentials—spirit, heart, will—
when the mechanism stirs but has not yet manifested, the spirit follows it.
When the mechanism portends completion, the heart plots it.
When the mechanism erupts and action follows, the will decides it.

When the mechanism stirs, it moves with the vigor of *yang*.
The Five Peaks cannot steady its corners, the Four Seas cannot bind its threads.
When the mechanism is still, it aligns with the virtue of *yin*.
The wise cannot manipulate its glory, deep spies cannot fathom its schemes,
Heaven and Earth cannot seize its timing—what then of mortals?

Fire arises from wood; when disaster strikes, it conquers.
Treachery arises from the state; when the time comes, it collapses.
To refine this knowledge is to be a sage.

*Annotation*: Fire arises from wood—when fire erupts, wood burns;
treachery arises from the state—when treachery matures, the state falls.
Wood harbors fire unseen, fire begins in formlessness;
the state harbors treachery unseen, treachery begins without sign.
Only the most sagely cannot refine body and conduct to prevent the treacherous fire from igniting.
Thus the state has no armies without soldiers, no calamities without cause.

With Ji Zi fleeing and bound in deerskin, Shang Rong imprisoned while Sheng Shu wept—
the chapter on enriching the state and securing the people.

Heaven’s creation and Heaven’s destruction are the Dao’s principle.
Heaven and Earth are thieves of the myriad things;
the myriad things are thieves of humanity;
humanity is thief of the myriad things.
The three thieves each have their due, the Three Powers each their place.

*Annotation*: Heaven and Earth, in generating the myriad things, steal their vigor and decay;
the myriad things, in serving humanity, steal humanity’s arrogance and excess;
humanity, in mastering the myriad things, steals their destruction.
All proceed naturally.
When the three thieves act rightly, the Three Powers fulfill their roles in turn.

Thus it is said:
Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize;
stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations settle.
Humanity knows the spirit’s spirit, yet does not know how the unmanifest spirit manifests.

*Annotation*: All have sainthood, yet none value the sage’s folly.
Having seen their sainthood, then perceived their folly, then seen their sainthood again—
thus the *Book of Documents* says:
Exclusive reliance on cleverness brings failure;
exclusive reliance on obscurity brings contradiction.
One clarity, one obscurity—this is what the multitude bears.

Yi Yin was a tavern keeper, Tai Gong a butcher, Guan Zhong a leatherworker, Bai Li a soup vendor—
in times of decline, all were deemed unremarkable.
Yet when they met Tang, met Wen Wang, served Duke Huan, or served Duke Mu,
their Dao saved the living, their deeds shaped the cosmos—
and all were deemed supremely extraordinary.

The sun and moon have their cycles, the great and small have their fixed measures;
thus arise the sage’s deeds, thus emerge the divine’s luminosity.

Their theft—*it is the subtle mechanism*.
None beneath the heavens can see it, none can know it.
The **gentleman** who grasps it, steadies his own **Dao/Way**;
the **petty man** who grasps it, risks his life recklessly.

*Annotation*: The **Lord of the Season** (Ji Zhōu) was humbled by the world, yet none saw the mechanism of his rise, nor knew its source.
The **Hegemons and Kings** (Bàwáng) opened their realms by this mechanism, yet none knew the mechanism of their rise, nor knew the source of their rise.

The **gentleman** who seizes this mechanism, acts in accordance with Heaven and aligns with humanity, thereby steadfastly preserving his own **Dao/Way**.
The **petty man** who seizes this mechanism, provokes war and indulges in martial folly, thereby lightly discarding his own life.

The *Book of Changes* (Yì) says:
The **gentleman** perceives the mechanism and acts accordingly—he does not wait for the day to end.
It also says: *He who knows the mechanism, his wisdom is divine*.

The mechanism—easy to perceive, yet difficult to grasp;
near at hand, yet distant in insight.
**The chapter on "Strong Armies and Strategic Triumph"** (Qiángbīng Zhànshèng Yǎnshù):
The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.
Seize one source of advantage, and the army’s power multiplies tenfold;
three reversals of day and night, and the army’s power multiplies ten thousandfold.

*Annotation*: Human ears and eyes are divided by the heart and completed by the spirit.
When the heart is divided, the mechanism lacks precision;
when the spirit is perfected, the mechanism becomes subtle.
Thus, Shī Kuàng (the blind musician) blinded his eyes yet sharpened his ears,
and Lí Zhū (the sharp-sighted) sealed his ears yet clarified his vision.
To rely on one source of advantage while countering it within the heart,
and to act upon circumstances, perceiving the mechanism—this ensures tenfold success.
To ponder three reversals, to experience day and night,
and to think before acting—this ensures ten thousandfold success.

The heart is born from things, yet dies from things;
the mechanism lies in the eyes.

*Annotation*: The most immediate mechanism in the world belongs to the heart and eyes.
The heart can perceive and reveal, the eyes can see the mechanism.
When Qín Shǐhuáng (First Emperor of Qin) toured the east to Huàijī,
Xiàng Yǔ (Item羽) saw his mechanism and his heart was stirred by things,
telling Xiàng Liáng (项良): *"He can be taken and replaced!"*
When the Jin army had fully assembled at Huái-È (淝水),
Chí Jiān (苻坚) said: *"Seeing his mechanism, my heart dies from things,"*
telling Chí Róng (苻融): *"That is a mighty foe—why is his force so slight?"*
Thus one knows that the heart’s life and death lie in things,
and the mechanism of success and failure is revealed in the eyes.

Heaven’s nature is without favor, yet great favor arises.
Swift thunder and fierce winds—none escape their sway.

*Annotation*: Heaven’s heart has no favor, yet all things have hearts,
and they attribute favor to Heaven.
Excessive joy leads to dissipation, excessive stillness to sternness.
*Annotation*: Joy becomes extravagant, stillness becomes upright and restrained.

Dissipation dulls the spirit, sternness clarifies it.
The spirit is the source of wisdom—when the spirit is clear, wisdom shines.
Wisdom is the repository of the heart—when wisdom is just, the heart is balanced.
None can reflect in flowing water, yet all can reflect in still water.
Because it is clear and even, a clear spirit and tranquil intent
can then discern the emotions of things.

The **sage**, not indulging in supreme joy nor resting in supreme stillness,
dwells between tranquil spirit and harmonious joy—this is called *guarding the middle* (shǔ zhōng).
Thus, benefits cannot seduce him, nor can music and beauty unsettle him;
eloquent speakers cannot persuade him, nor can clever men move him,
nor can the bold intimidate him.
He foresees calamity beyond the heavy gates,
and contemplates disaster within the distant void.

Heaven will not oppose him, let alone the deceitful strategies of war.

Heaven’s supreme partiality yields universal fairness.
*Annotation*: The **Dao/Way** of Heaven nurtures all things without neglecting even the smallest—
the gnarled tree, the tiny worm, the great eagle, or the humble wild duck.
Great and small, long and short—each finds its place, the height of partiality.
Clouds move, rain falls, thunder and lightning, frost and dew—
life and death are meted out with equal measure, the height of fairness.

The **sage** follows Heaven and models Earth,
nourishes the myriad people, and discerns their toil and suffering—
the height of partiality.
He issues righteous decrees and implements laws like symbols—
the height of fairness.

Sūn Wǔ (孙武) said:
*"View your soldiers as beloved children, and you can die together;
treat them like infants, and you can cross deep ravines with them.*
Loving yet unable to command is like a spoiled child.
Thus, govern them with **virtue/power** and discipline them with force.

The art of capturing lies in **qi**.
*Annotation*: The tortoise devours the python, the falcon strikes the crane,
the yellow weasel feasts on the tiger, the flying squirrel severs the monkey,
the toad and leech drain the fish, the wolf and dog bite the heron,
the *yǔrén* (余甘) tames gold with gentleness, and the *hèchē* (河车) harnesses its power.
Endless transformations yield jade, and *xiónghuáng* (雄黄) changes into iron.
There are woods that do not burn and stones that float on water.
When beasts, birds, trees, and stones obtain their **qi**, they can subdue the greater with the lesser—
how much more so when **Heroes** obtain their **qi**,
and cannot then fail to purify the world and command the cosmos!

Life is the root of death; death is the root of life.
Favor arises from harm; harm arises from favor.

*Annotation*: Those who scheme for life must first face death before attaining it;
those who practice death must first experience life before embracing it.
The *Mìguànzǐ* (鹖冠子) said:
*"Without death, there is no life; without separation, there is no completion."*
Sūn Wǔ said:
*"Drive him to the brink of death, and then he will live;
bring him to the edge of destruction, and then he will survive."*
Wú Qǐ (吴起) said:
*"On the battlefield, where corpses stand—
those who must die will live, those who cling to life will die."*
Favor is the source of harm; harm is the source of favor.
Wú Shù (吴树) bestowed favor upon Yuè (越), yet harm emerged;
Zhōu (周) established harm against Yīn (殷), yet favor arose.
Death and life, favor and harm—
they intertwine in opposition.

Fools attribute Heaven and Earth’s patterns to the **sage’s virtue/power**,
while I discern the **wise’s virtue/power** in the patterns of time and things.

*Annotation*: When auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes soar,
sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, the rivers do not overflow nor the seas surge,
the sun and moon eclipse, the five stars stray, the seasons disorder,
day turns to night and night to day, mountains collapse and rivers dry,
thunder strikes in winter and frost falls in summer—
fools take these as Heaven and Earth’s chaotic mechanisms.

Yet when **virtue/power** is tranquil and settled,
its light reaches to the four quarters,
and the **gentleman** of clear wisdom and refined **virtue/power**
can unite the nine clans.
The six ministries and three affairs are without conflict,
all grains flourish, and the myriad people prosper.
When a **foolish ruler** and **wicked ministers** prevail,
laws and decrees are inconsistent,
heavy taxes and harsh governance blind both above and below,
and the **noble and lowly** alike are deceived.
Noble kin and favored ministers grow arrogant and extravagant,
indulging in wine and music, towering halls and ornate walls,
while the people scatter and flee,
longing for chaos and blaming the ruler above.

「I regard this moment’s **Dao/Way** and **qi** as the means by which **order and chaos** unfold.

Where others see **foolishness** as **sageliness**,
I see **sageliness** in not being **foolish**;
Where others see **strangeness** as **sageliness**,
I see **victory** in not being **strange**.

*Note:* The hearts of the **virtuous and wise** are profound and wondrous, beyond measure.
The traces of **Yu the Nest-Dweller** are observed by some,
Yet when **yin** shifts without fixed pattern,
When **self-moving mechanisms** turn endlessly without limit—
How could the **wise** ever be **deceived**?
To judge the heart by its traces is the act of a **fool**.

Thus it is said:
*"To sink in water or plunge into fire,
Is to court one’s own destruction."*

The **Dao/Way** of **Nature** is tranquil,
Thus Heaven and Earth and all things **thrive**.
The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth is **pervasive**,
Thus **yin** and **yang** prevail.
When **yin** and **yang** mutually advance,
Their transformations follow **harmony**!

Therefore, the **sage** knows that **Nature’s Dao/Way** cannot be defied,
And so aligns with it to govern.

The **Dao/Way** of utter stillness
Is beyond the reach of **laws** and **calendrical measurements**.
Yet there are **strange instruments**—
These give rise to the **ten thousand phenomena**.
Within the **sealed cycles of ganzhi** (天干地支),
**divine mechanisms** and **hidden arts** are concealed.
The **techniques** of **yin** and **yang** prevailing
Are clearly revealed through the **phenomena**!

*The Yellow Emperor’s* **Yinfu Jing** *Commentary* [Tang] Zhang Guo
*The Yellow Emperor’s* **Yinfu Jing** *Preface*
The **Yinfu** has existed since the Yellow Emperor,
Indeed, the **sage** embodies the **Dao/Way**’s mechanisms in accordance with Heaven.
The *Classic* states:
*"Those who grasp the **mechanism** thrive through ten thousand changes and grow ever stronger,
Even reaching the rank of **king**.
Those who lose the **mechanism** decline through ten thousand changes and grow ever weaker,
Even to the point of **ruin**."*

Later, **Yi** and **Lu** (伊吕) obtained its **fading remnants**,
Yet still managed to rescue the **living beings**—
What then of the **sage**?

Its text is **concise**, its meaning **profound**.
Though there are many **earlier sages** who annotated it,
Their interpretations **conceal** and **reveal** in turn.
Later scholars struggle to master it,
And even those who claim a preference
Are like climbing to Heaven without a ladder.

In recent times, **Li Quan** (李筌)
Falsely attributed his work to **demonic sorcerers**,
And recklessly composed annotations,
Merely drawing on human affairs,
Far from **harmonizing** with the **source**’s essence.
He does not blush to peer into **insignificant traces**,
Yet boldly presents his **shallow insights** as profound.
If **lowly men** secretly glimpse them,
They would boast of having grasped Heaven’s **mechanisms**.

Alas!
Though I am **your humble servant** and **foolishly ignorant**,
I have always believed otherwise.

The morning I wished to hear the **Dao/Way**, and the evening I would die without regret.
By chance, in the **藏外** *(outer Daoist canon)*, I obtained *The Yinyu Transmission* (*Yinyu zhuàn*), unknown whose era it came from.

Its words and logic are **profound and boundless** (玄邈),
Like **sealing** (契) the **nature of the Way** (自然).
Thus I compiled it and appended my own annotations,
Hoping that future **virtuous men** (君子) would not lose the **Dao/Way’s essence** (道旨).

The **Yellow Emperor’s Yinyu Scripture** (黄帝阴符经) states:
*"To observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven, to grasp Heaven’s actions—this suffices.
To observe the **Dao/Way** of Nature—there is nothing to observe.
One does not observe it with the eyes, but with the heart.
The heart is deep and subtle, yet sees nothing it cannot perceive,
Thus it can illuminate Nature’s **virtue/power** (性).
This **virtue/power** (性) is deep and subtle yet able to illuminate—
This is what is called ‘**Yin**’ (阴).

To grasp Nature’s actions—there is nothing to grasp.
Thus one does not grasp it with the hands, but with **mechanisms** (机).
**Mechanisms** (机) are flexible and unrestricted, yet can **seal** (契) Nature’s **principles** (理).
Only when flexible and able to **seal**—
This is what is called ‘**Fu**’ (符).
To illuminate with the heart, to **seal** with **mechanisms**—
Thus the meaning of ‘**Yinyu**’ (阴符) is complete.*

Li Quan took **Yin** (阴) as ‘**darkness**’ (暗),
And **Fu** (符) as ‘**harmonization**’ (合),
Using this text as a preface—
How **blind** (昧) his understanding was!

Thus Heaven has **five thieves** (五贼), and those who see them prosper.
The **five thieves** (五贼) are: **fate** (命), **phenomena** (物), **timing** (时), **achievement** (功), and **spirit** (神).

The *Transmission* (传) says:
*"The **Dao/Way** of the **Sage** (圣人) is vast yet does not neglect the minute,
And refined yet does not conceal its flaws.
Thus, when dwelling in peace, they follow the **Dao/Way** and manifest **virtue/power** (德) to transform it,
And when encountering peril, they employ **strategic means** (权) and unleash **mechanisms** (机) to rescue it.
Their purpose is to rectify Heaven and Earth,
Their plan is to benefit all mankind.
Thus, using **great righteousness** (大义) to eliminate harm in the world,
Using **great benevolence** (大仁) to promote benefit in the world,
Using **ultimate correctness** (至正) to redress injustice in the world,
Using **absolute impartiality** (至公) to curb private interests in the world—
The schemes that **invert scripture yet harmonize the Dao/Way** (反经合道) have five names,
Which the **Sage** (圣人) **transmutes** (禅) and calls ‘**thieves**’ (贼).
Yet the world relies on them—
Then they are called **virtue/power** (德).
Thus, the **thief** of **fate** (命) is such that people know of Heaven yet not its **thief**,
Hence the Yellow Emperor replaced the Flame Emperor.
The **thief** of **phenomena** (物) is such that people know of Heaven yet not its **thief**,
Hence Emperor Yao replaced Emperor Zhi.
The **thief** of **timing** (时) is such that people know of Heaven yet not its **thief**,
Hence Emperor Shun replaced Emperor Yao.
The **thief** of **achievement** (功) is such that people know of Heaven yet not its **thief**,
Hence Great Yu replaced Emperor Shun.
The **thief** of **spirit** (神) is such that people know of Heaven yet not its **thief**,
Hence Tang of the Shang overthrew the Xia dynasty.
King Wu of the Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty.
Thus, those who see them prosper—
This is the natural way of prospering.
The Duke of Zhou took the **thief** of **fate** (命) as **strategic means** (用味),
Using it as an allegory.
Li Quan did not comprehend—
He took the Yellow Emperor’s **thief** of the **fate** (命) of a maiden
And the daytime ascent of a vapor as wrongdoing.
The **five thieves** (五贼) lie within the heart,
Their application lies in Heaven;
The universe lies within the hands,
And ten thousand transformations arise from the body.
The *Transmission* (传) says:
*'The establishment of **virtue/power** (德) is clear,
The use of **mechanisms** (机) is subtle.
When unleashed from within, it is seen without—this is all.*
How could it mean **wielding arms to create banditry and chaos** (称兵革以作寇乱)?
To see its **mechanisms** (机) and grasp them,
Even if the universe is vast,
It does not depart from the **palm and fingers** (掌握),
Much less its smaller aspects!
To know its **spirit** (神) and embody it,
Even if myriad things abound,
They cannot escape one’s **chest and mind** (胸臆),
Much less their fewness!
Nature’s **creative transformations** (造化) and their **force** (力) belong to me—
Is this not **grand** (盛)?
Is this not **great** (大)?
Li Quan and others took the **five thieves** (五贼) as the **five flavors** (五味),
Saying that following them leads to **immortality** (神仙) and **non-death** (不死).
This is the **most egregious distortion** (诬) of the **Dao/Way**!

Heaven’s **nature** (性) is **humanity** (人),
And the **human heart** (人心) is **mechanisms** (机).
To establish the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is to **settle** (定) **humanity** (人).
The *Transmission* (传) says:
*'**Humanity** (人) refers to Heaven’s **nature** (性),
**Mechanisms** (机) refer to the human heart.'*
**Human nature** (人性) is originally **profound and naturally harmonious** (玄合),
Thus the **Sage** (圣人) can embody the **five thieves** (五贼).

When Heaven unleashes the **killing mechanism** (杀机), dragons and serpents rise from the land;
When **humanity** (人) unleashes the **killing mechanism** (杀机), Heaven and Earth **reverse and shift** (反复).
The *Transmission* (传) says:
*'Heaven’s **mechanisms** (机) expand yet do not produce life,
Heaven’s **mechanisms** (机) relax yet do not cause death.
Heaven has **expansion and relaxation** (驰张), its use has **flaws and virtues** (否臧).
When expanded, the **killing mechanism** (杀威) takes action;
When relaxed, the **killing mechanism** (杀威) vanishes.
The **mechanisms** (机) of **humanity** (人) are likewise.
Heaven uses **qi** (气) as its **威** (威),
And **humanity** (人) uses **virtue/power** (德) as its **mechanisms** (机).
In autumn and winter, the **Yin qi** (阴气) is severe and congealed—
This is Heaven’s **expanded killing mechanism** (张杀机),
Thus dragons and serpents fear and **hibernate** (蛰伏).
When winter passes and spring arrives, **Yin** retreats and **Yang** grows—
This is Heaven’s **relaxed killing mechanism** (驰杀机),
Thus dragons and serpents rejoice and **awaken** (振起).
Heaven has **cold and warmth** (寒暄),
And **virtue/power** (德) also has **cold and warmth** (寒暄).
When **virtue/power** (德) and **punishments** (刑) are strict and orderly,
This is the ruler’s **expanded killing mechanism** (张杀机),
Thus the lowly fear and submit.
When **virtue/power** (德) and **punishments** (刑) are **imbalanced** (偏),
This is the ruler’s **relaxed killing mechanism** (驰杀机),
Thus the wicked rejoice and **run wild** (驰骋).
Rank has **high and low** (尊卑), mirroring Heaven and Earth,
Thus it is said:
*"When Heaven unleashes the **killing mechanism** (杀机), dragons and serpents rise from the land,
And banditry and chaos originate;
When **humanity** (人) unleashes the **killing mechanism** (杀机), Heaven and Earth **reverse and shift** (反复),
And the **high and low** (尊卑) are thus **overthrown** (革)."*
The Duke of Zhou, Zhuge Liang, and others,
When they **slaughtered thousands** (杀人过万),
Great winds and tempests arose, and the day darkened as night—
They took this as Heaven and Earth **reversing and shifting** (反复),
But their error was profound.

Heaven and **humanity** (人) **harmonize virtue/power** (合德),
And ten thousand transformations rest on a **foundation** (基).
The *Transmission* (传) says:
*"Heaven dispenses **mechanisms** (机) of calamity and fortune above,
And the ruler moves **mechanisms** (机) of benefit and harm below.
Thus those with **virtue/power** (德) prosper through ten thousand transformations,
And reach the heights of kingship;
Those without **virtue/power** (德) decline through myriad changes,
And meet their end in ruin.
Thus it is said: Heaven and **humanity** (人) **harmonize virtue/power** (合德),
And ten thousand transformations rest on a **foundation** (基).
This is the **naturally so** (自然而然)."*

**Nature** (性) has **skill and clumsiness** (巧拙),
Which can be **concealed** (伏藏).
The *Transmission* (传) says:
*"The **nature** (性) of the **Sage** (圣人) is **skilled** in applying wisdom,
Yet **clumsy** in exerting strength.
When in adversity or peril, they **plot with the Dao/Way** (谋道) to aid it;
When facing the **strong and the clever** (强与明), they **conceal righteousness** (伏义) to retreat.
This is essential for **governing the state** (理国),
And likewise for **employing military force** (用师).
The **evil** (邪) of the **nine orifices** (九窍) lies in the **three critical points** (三要),
Which can be **activated or stilled** (动静)."*

*«The Transmission* says:
The **use** (用) of the **nine orifices** (九窍) lies in the **three critical points** (三要) as the **mechanism** (机).
The **three critical points** (三要) are **mechanism** (机), **emotions** (情), and **nature** (性).
To **govern** (则) **mechanism** (机) is to have all things **settled** (安);
To **govern** (则) **emotions** (情) is to have all things **perverse** (邪);
To **govern** (则) **nature** (性) is to have all things **upright** (正).
Thus, the **Sage** (圣人) **activates** (动) to **conceal emotions** (伏其情),
**stills** (静) to **preserve nature** (常其性),
And **delights** (乐) to **fix mechanism** (定其机).
The **petty man** (小人) does the opposite, hence the following passage:
*"Duke of Zhou* (太公) **established** (为) the **three critical points** (三要) as **ears, eyes, and mouth** (耳、目、口);
*Li Qun* (李筌) **established** (为) the **heart, spirit, and will** (心、神、志), all **ignoring mechanism** (忘机).
Both **lost** (俱失) the **true meaning** (正意) of the *Yin Fu* (《阴符》).

Fire **arises** (生) from wood, yet **disaster** (祸) **strikes** (发) and must be **overcome** (克);
Treachery **arises** (生) from the state, yet **opportunity** (时) **strikes** (动) and must be **exploited** (溃).
To **know** (知) this and **refine oneself** (修炼) is called being a **Sage** (圣人).
*The Transmission* says:
*"Wood’s **nature** (性) is **still** (静),
Yet when it **moves** (动), fire **arises** (生).
If one does not **perceive** (觉) the fire’s **flourishing** (盛),
It will **burn** (焚) its own essence.
Similarly, **human nature** (人之性) is **still** (静),
Yet when it **moves** (动), treachery **arises** (生).
If one does not **perceive** (觉) treachery’s **completion** (成),
It will **disrupt** (乱) the state.

The **clear-sighted** (明者) see **others’ weaknesses** (彼之隙) to **set their mechanism** (设其机),
The **wise** (智者) know **others’ flaws** (彼之病) to **harness advantage** (圆其利),
Then the people of the world—**they** (彼) are **foolish** (愚), **I** (我) am **Sage** (圣).
Thus, the **living** (生者) claim to have **secured life** (得其生),
And the **dead** (死者) claim to have **secured death** (得其死).
**Non-action** (无为) yet **nothing is left undone** (无不为),
This is the **principle** (理) of **attaining the Dao/Way** (得道).

**Heaven’s creation and destruction** (天生天杀) is the **principle** (理) of the Dao/Way (道).
Heaven and Earth are the **thieves** (盗) of **ten thousand transformations** (万物);
Ten thousand transformations are the **thieves** (盗) of **humanity** (人);
Humanity is the **thief** (盗) of **ten thousand transformations** (万物).
When the **three thieves** (三盗) are **properly aligned** (既宜),
And the **Three Powers** (三才) are **settled** (既安).
*The Transmission* says:
*"Heaven and Earth **transform** (化) **ten thousand things** (万物) through **yin-yang qi** (阴阳之气),
Yet **ten thousand things** (万物) do not **know** (知) their **theft** (盗).
**Ten thousand things** (万物) **nourish** (飨) **humanity** (人) with **good and evil flavors** (美恶之味),
Yet **humanity** (人) does not **know** (知) their **theft** (盗).
**Humanity** (人) **controls** (制) **ten thousand things** (万物) with **advantage and harm** (利害之谟),
Yet **ten thousand things** (万物) do not **know** (知) their **theft** (盗).
The **three thieves** (三盗) **mysteriously unite** (玄合) in the **human heart** (人心),
And the **Three Powers** (三才) **remain still and follow** (静顺) the **principle of Heaven** (天理).

**Food** (食) is **obtained** (得) only at its **time** (时), yet **one’s body** (终身) **never fails to heal** (无不愈);
**Mechanism** (机) is **activated** (动) only when **ready** (然后), yet **all things** (庶类) **never fail to settle** (无不安).
If **food** (食) is not **taken at its time** (得其时),
Or **mechanism** (机) is not **activated when ready** (动其机),
Then **ruin and extinction** (灭亡) are near.
Thus it is said:
*"To eat at its time, the hundred bones are **regulated** (治);
To move with mechanism, ten thousand transformations are **settled** (安).*

**Humanity** (人) knows its **spirit** (神) and **spirit** (神) is **manifest** (神),
Yet does not know how **spirit** (神) **manifests** (所以神).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The people of their time do not know that **theft** (盗) is **theft** (之为盗),
Only saying that **spirit** (神) can **manifest** (能神).
*Ghost Valley Master* (《鬼谷子》) says:
*"When **both sides** (彼此) are **unaware** (不觉), it is called **spirit** (神).
This is the **refinement** (功) of **subtlety** (微) **achieved** (着矣).
Li Qun did not understand this passage’s **unified meaning** (意通三盗),
But **separately** (别) used **Sage** (圣人) and **foolish man** (愚人) as **analogies** (喻),
How **erroneous** (谬) is this!

The **sun and moon** (日月) have **fixed measures** (数),
And the **great and small** (大小) have **set distinctions** (定).
From this, **Sage’s great deeds** (圣功) **arise** (生),
And **spirit and clarity** (神明) **emerge** (出).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The sun and moon have **fixed standards** (准), **cyclical movements** (运数);
The **great and small** (大小) have **set distinctions** (定), **ruler and subject** (君臣).
To **observe Heaven’s time** (观天之时),
To **examine humanity’s affairs** (察人之事),
To **grasp humanity’s mechanism** (执人之机),
Then the **Sage** (圣) **achieves great deeds** (得以功),
And **spirit and clarity** (神) **emerge** (得以明).

When the **heart is tranquil** (心冥) and **principle is united** (理合),
This is the **best of stillness** (安之善).
Li Qun **mistakenly took** (以) **calculating cycles** (度数) as the **sun and moon** (日月),
And **remaining portions** (余分) as the **great and small** (大小),
Saying that **spirit-qi** (神气) can **generate Sage’s great deeds** (生圣功) and **spirit and clarity** (神明),
How **greatly mistaken** (错谬) is this!

As for their **theft of mechanism** (盗机),
No one under Heaven can **see** (见) or **know** (知) it.
The **noble man** (君子) who **attains** (得) it **preserves himself** (固躬),
The **petty man** (小人) who **attains** (得) it **risks his life** (轻命).
*The Transmission* says:
*"Their **theft** (盗) is **subtle** (微) yet **movement** (动) is **clear and broad** (甚明博),
Their **actions** (行) are **extremely mysterious** (极玄妙).
The **noble man** (君子) who **uses** (用) it—
When **prosperous** (达), he **saves all under Heaven** (兼济天下), **Duke of Zhou** (太公) being such a one.
When **impoverished** (穷), he **perfects himself alone** (独善一身), **Master Kong** (夫子) being such a one.
Is this not the **ability to discern advantage** (择利) with **great precision** (审)?

The **petty man** (小人) who **uses** (用) it—
Then he is **bewildered by fame** (惑名) and **loses himself** (失其身).
Is this not **Zhong the Great Officer** (大夫种)?
To **gain advantage yet lose righteousness** (得利而亡义),
Is this not **Li Si** (李斯)?
Is this not the **failure to uphold the Dao/Way** (信道) with **sincerity** (笃)?

The **blind** (瞽者) are **good at hearing** (善听),
The **deaf** (聋者) are **good at seeing** (善视).
To **cut off advantage at its source** (绝利一源), **military force** (用师) is **tenfold** (十倍).
To **return three times** (三返) **day and night** (昼夜), **military force** (用师) is **ten thousand-fold** (万倍).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The blind are **good at hearing** (善于听),
**Forgotten** (忘) of **colors** (色) and **attentive** (审) to **sounds** (声),
Thus they **achieve great acuity** (致其聪).
The deaf are **good at seeing** (善于视),
**Abandoning** (遗) **ears** (耳) and **fixing on eyes** (专目),
Thus they **achieve great clarity** (致其明).
Hence they can **perform the deeds of ten thousand troops** (能十众之功).
To **move three times** (三而行) within **one day** (一昼之中),
This is how they **reach** (所以至).
To **think three times** (三而思) within **one night** (一夜之中),
This is how they **refine** (所以精).
Thus they can **command ten thousand troops** (用万众之人).
Li Qun did not know that **military force** (师) is **troops** (众),
But **mistakenly took** (以为) it as **military strategist** (兵师),
This is **error** (误).

The **heart** (心) **arises** (生) from **things** (物) and **dies** (死) from **things** (物),
And **mechanism** (机) lies in the **eyes** (目).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The heart has **love and hatred** (爱恶) **emotions** (之情),
**Things** (物) have **flaws and merits** (否臧) **uses** (之用).
The **eyes** (目) **observe** (视) and **discern** (察) them **externally** (于外),
The **heart** (心) **responds** (应) and **judges** (度) them **internally** (于内).
If **good** (善), then **follow** (从) and **act** (行) upon it;
If **not** (否则), then **withdraw** (违) and **stop** (止).
This is how they **encourage virtue** (劝善) and **punish evil** (惩恶).
Li Qun **mistakenly took** (以) **Item羽’s** (项羽) **lack of mechanism** (昧机) as the **heart arising from things** (心生于物);
And **Fú Jiān’s** (符坚) **perception of mechanism** (见机) as the **heart dying from things** (心死于物).
He **completely failed** (殊不知) to grasp **flaws and merits** (有否臧之用).

Heaven’s **greatest self-interest** (至私) **generates** (生) **greatest public use** (至公).
*The Transmission* says:
*"Heaven’s **natural principle** (自然之理) is **subtle** (微) yet **unknowable** (不可知),
This is the **greatest self-interest** (至私).
Yet when **treacherous omens** (凶象) **appear** (见) as **Heaven’s warnings** (咎征),
**Humanity** (人) can **take heed** (儆戒) and **cultivate virtue** (修德).
When **thunder and fierce winds** (迅雷烈风) **stir** (动) **humanity** (人),
**Humanity** (人) can **fear** (恐惧) and **attain blessings** (致福).
This is how **greatest self-interest** (无恩) **generates** (生) **greatest public use** (大恩).
Li Qun **mistakenly took** (以) **Heaven and Earth’s lack of benevolence** (天地不仁) as **greatest public use** (大恩),
And **ten thousand things returning to Heaven** (万物归于天) as **bewildered** (蠢然).
This **greatly diverges** (殊背) from the *Yin Fu*’s **original meaning** (本意).

*The Transmission* says:
**The greatest delight is nature’s excess** (至乐性余),
**The greatest stillness is nature’s restraint** (至静性廉).
*"When **emotions** (情) are **unreleased** (未发), it is called **the Middle** (中);
To **guard the Middle** (守中) is called **constancy** (常),
Then **delight attains its purpose** (乐得其志) and **nature has excess** (性有余).
When **nature is tranquil and constant** (性安常), it is called **self-sufficiency** (自足);
Then **stillness attains its purpose** (静得其志) and **restraint is constant** (廉常足).
Li Qun **mistakenly took** (以) **excessiveness** (奢) as **delight’s nature** (乐性),
And **restraint** (廉) as **stillness** (静),
How **contrary** (殊乖) is this to the **supreme Dao/Way** (至道)!

Heaven’s **greatest self-interest** (至私) **becomes** (用) **greatest public use** (至公).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The **natural principle** (自然之理) is **subtle** (微) yet **unknowable** (不可知),
This is the **greatest self-interest** (至私)."*»

「The **greatest self-interest** (至私) of **Nature’s function** (自然之功) is **manifest yet unalterable** (明而不可违), the **greatest public use** (至公) of the Dao/Way.

The **Sage** (圣人) embodies it thus. Li Qun cites *The Art of War* (《孙子》):
*"To treat soldiers as one’s own beloved children, they can be made to die together with you."* (视卒如爱子，可以之俱死)
Why so? **The principle of capture lies in qi.** (擒之制在气)
*The Transmission* says:
*"To capture beings, one uses qi; to control them, one uses strategy. Why rely on brute force of great or small?"* (擒物以气，制之以机，岂用小大之力乎？)
**Duke Zhou** (太公) said:
*"Is it by great or small force that one controls the other?"* (岂以小大而相制哉？)
Li Qun fails to grasp **the principle of capture** (擒之义), misapplying it to **wild beasts** (禽兽).
His annotations cite instances like *the tortoise devouring the snake* (玄龟食蛇), *the yellow-bellied beast preying on the tiger* (黄腰啖虎), etc.—how lamentable!

**Life** (生) is the root of **death** (死), and **death** is the root of **life**.
**Harm** (害) gives rise to **favor** (恩), and **favor** gives rise to **harm**.
**Life** is what people cherish, for it is **profoundly beneficial to the body** (厚于身).
Yet **excess** (太过) leads to **the Dao/Way’s ruin** (道丧), and **death** (死) comes naturally.
**Death** is what people abhor, for it **damages the affairs of life** (损于事).
**Clarity** (至明) preserves the Dao/Way, and **life** (生) is naturally secured.

**Favor** (恩) is the **principle of fortune** (福理) reaching others,
**Harm** (害) is the **principle of calamity** (祸乱) reaching others.
To **harm oneself** (损己) is to **benefit others** (物之所益)—
thus, **harm** (害) gives rise to **favor** (恩).

Li Qun cites *The Art of War* (《孙子》) on warfare as **life and death** (生死),
and **Ding Gong** (丁公) and **Guan Zhong** (管仲) on **favor and harm** (恩害).
How strange! The **foolish man** (愚人) regards **Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles** (天地文理) as **Sagehood** (圣),
while I see **the Sagehood in adapting to time and things** (时物文理) as **philosophy** (哲).
Others consider **planning** (期) as **Sagehood** (圣),
but I consider **not planning** (不期) as **Sagehood** (圣).

*The Transmission* says:
*"Observe the **Heaven’s movement** (天之运) through the four seasons,
and **Earth’s transformation** (地之化) of all things—
to know all yet **conceal knowledge** (蔽之以无知),
to **bestow small favors** (小恩于人) while **nurturing oneself** (蒙自养),
is the way of the Sage."*

To know the **four seasons’ course** (四时之行) and **all things’ generation** (万物之生)
is to grasp **Nature’s spontaneity** (自然).
Thus, the Sage **resides in the Middle** (以中自居).

Hence it is said: *"Death and life lie within me alone."* (死生在我而已矣)
**Human death** is like **drowning in water** (沈水自溺) or **burning in fire** (投火自焚)—
**self-inflicted annihilation** (自取灭亡).

To **govern a state with the Dao/Way** (理国以道) lies in **reducing its affairs** (损其事).
To **command an army with strategy** (理军以权) lies in **abolishing its weapons** (亡其兵).
Thus, **without the mechanism of death** (无死机), there is **no death** (不死).
What can **ghosts and spirits** (鬼神) do to me?

The Sage **cultivates oneself** (修身) to **secure one’s family** (安其家),
governs a state (理国) to **pacify the world** (平天下),
by **establishing the mechanism of life** (立生机).
To **remove one’s deathly nature** (去其死性) is the **mechanism of life** (生之机).
To **eliminate the mechanism of death** (除死机) and **harness life’s vitality** (取其生情) is the **mechanism of death** (死之机).

Li Qun **does not comprehend Heaven’s Dao/Way** (不天道),
yet he **tests Heaven’s Dao/Way** (验天道) with the **foolish, the Sage, and those who embody the Dao/Way yet remain ignorant** (体道愚昧之人).
His error is **most grievous** (失之甚也).
Hence it is said: *"Drowning in water, burning in fire—self-inflicted annihilation."* (沈水入火，自取灭亡)
The annotation is **already made above** (注在上矣).

**Nature’s Dao/Way is supremely still** (自然之道静),
so **Heaven and Earth and all things are born** (天地万物生).
*The Transmission* says:
*"Nature’s Dao/Way **acts without action yet nothing remains undone** (无为而无不为).*
**Movement and stillness both attain their nature** (动静皆得其性)—
this is the **supreme stillness** (静之至).
Stillness **establishes Heaven and Earth** (能立天地),
**generates all things** (生万物),
**spontaneously and naturally** (自然而然)."

**Yi Yin** (伊尹) said:
*"Supreme stillness **does not know how it generates** (不知所以生).*
**Heaven and Earth’s Dao/Way is subtle** (浸), so **yin and yang prevail** (阴阳胜).
*The Transmission* says:
*"**Subtle** (浸) is **refined** (微).*
**Heaven and Earth’s Dao/Way** is **embodied yet applied subtly** (体着而用微),
**adapting and transforming** (变通) to **return to the norm** (归于正)—
this is the **gradual refinement of subtlety** (微之渐)."

**Gradual refinement of subtlety** (微渐) allows **yin and yang to be distinguished** (分阴阳),
**to complete the four seasons** (成四时).
This is **ultimate strength and ultimate compliance** (至刚至顺).
**Yin and yang** propel each other,
and **transformation proceeds in harmony** (变化顺).

*The Transmission* says:
*"The Sage **adapts and transforms** (变化) in **harmony with yin and yang’s mechanisms** (顺阴阳之机).*
**Heaven and Earth’s positions** are **naturally established** (自然),
so the Sage **follows Nature’s spontaneity** (因自然而冥之),
**harnesses its benefits** (利自然而用之),
and **nothing escapes Nature’s Dao/Way** (莫不得自然之道).

Thus, the Sage **knows Nature’s Dao/Way is unalterable** (不可违),
and **controls it accordingly** (因而制之).
The annotation is **already made above** (注在文上).

**Supreme stillness** (至静) **transcends all measure and reckoning** (律历所不能契).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The Dao/Way’s **supreme stillness** (至静), though **measured and regulated** (律历) may **follow and control** (因而制之),
**cannot conform to its inner essence** (不能叶其中)—
this is the **beastly ignorance** (鸟兽之谓).*

Here are **wondrous instruments** (奇器),
which **generate all phenomena** (是生万象).
**The Eight Trigrams and the Heavenly Stems-Earthly Branches** (八卦甲子) hold **divine mechanisms and mysterious concealments** (神机鬼藏).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The **Eight Trigrams’ shifting transformations** (八卦变异之伎) **emanate from this** (从是而生).
Above, it **manifests all phenomena** (则万象),
below, it **encompasses all mechanisms** (则万机).
Use the **Eight Trigrams to embody Heaven** (体天),
use the **Nine Categories** (九畴) to **model Earth** (法地).
**Correlate them with climate and qi** (参之以气候),
**thread them with Heavenly Stems-Earthly Branches** (贯之以甲子),
**penetrate them with divine mechanisms** (达之以神机),
**conceal them in guileful strategies** (闭之以诡藏)—
**the wondrous and deceptive sway of Nature** (奇谲之荡自然).

The **art of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之术)
is **clearly expressed in the symbols** (昭昭乎进乎象).
*The Transmission* says:
*"The **art of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之术)
**consistently operates subtly yet never deviates from its root** (恒微而不违乎本).
**Clarity’s truth is trustworthy** (明之信可明),
so it **penetrates the refined and luminous symbols** (能通乎精曜象矣)."»
