**The Supreme Mystery of the Great Ultimate: A Transmission of the Daoist Heart-Mind**
*By Master Ningyang of the Qing Dynasty*

**Illustrated Explanation of the Ren and Du Meridians**

The *Ren* meridian arises below *Zhongji*, ascends through the pubic hairline, follows the inner abdomen, passes *Guanyuan*, reaches the throat, pierces the center to rise upward, enters the brain through the cavity, and terminates at *Yinjiao* (the seam between the lower gums). It is the sea of the Yin meridians.

The *Du* meridian originates at the *Shu* point of the lower extreme, ascends along the spine, rises to *Fengfu*, enters the brain atop the crown, follows the forehead to the bridge of the nose, where the *qi* penetrates the center, descends through the cavity into the throat, and terminates at *Yinjiao* (the seam between the upper gums). It is the sea of the Yang meridians.

Thus, when the teeth meet, the tongue presses against the palate, uniting the *Du* and *Ren* meridians. The *Ren* meridian enables women to conceive and nurture; the *Du* meridian governs and regulates the sea of meridians.

The ancient immortals said: *"The deer circulates *qi* through its tailbone, opening the *Du* meridian, thus living a thousand years without death. The tortoise draws breath through its nose, opening the *Ren* meridian, thus attaining longevity and enduring life."* If one can unblock these two meridians, all meridians will flow freely.

*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: *"All arises from the heart’s circulation of the celestial meridian; day and night, preserve it, and you shall attain long life."* The celestial meridian is the Yellow Path of our body, where breath comes and goes—this is the *Ren* and *Du* meridians.

**The Five Grades of Immortals**

Humans receive the *qi* of the Two Modes and assume the form of the Four Great Elements, yet their endowments differ, and their wisdom varies. Without assessing the depth of their root capacity or the sharpness of their awakening, upon hearing but a single phrase, they aspire to immortality or Buddhahood without the slightest merit—is this not self-deception?

Immortals are of five grades—celestial, terrestrial, spiritual, human, and ghostly—depending on the swiftness of their encounter with the Dao and the nature of their practice.

**Celestial Immortals** are those who, through countless kalpas of cultivation, possess innate spiritual roots and wisdom. Born into virtuous families, they enter the Dao in childhood, receiving the supreme teaching from a perfected being. They take heaven and earth as their crucible, the sun and moon as water and fire, abiding in pure stillness and naturalness. Their inner and outer elixirs are refined, transcending the Three Realms and shattering the cage of existence. These are they who lean upon heaven to surpass heaven.

**Terrestrial Immortals** are those of unwavering faith and resolute action, who renounce the mundane in their prime. They study the Dao, comprehend the mechanisms of creation, and understand the principles of life. Through the refinement of elixirs and the ingestion of longevity herbs, they preserve their form and dwell in the world, walking as immortals upon the earth. These are they who rely upon earth to become earth.

**Spiritual Immortals** are born with the bearing of immortals, embodying great loyalty and filial piety. They accumulate merit and virtue from youth, yearning for the Dao and wearying of worldly dust. Dwelling in sacred mountains and blessed lands, they refine essence into *qi*, *qi* into spirit, and spirit into emptiness. First, they cultivate the Jade Fluid, then refine the Golden Elixir. When Yin is exhausted and Yang is pure, they transcend the ordinary and enter sainthood, dividing their form and transforming *qi*, roaming freely and at ease. These are they who refine spirit to return to spirit.

**Human Immortals** are humble and self-disciplined, kind and harmonious with others. In middle age or later years, free from the snares of fame and profit, they forget emotions when facing circumstances. They circulate *qi* to extend life, withdraw lead and add mercury, extract from *Kan* to fill *Li*, practice exhalation and inhalation in due time, and perform daoyin exercises with rhythm. Their bodies and minds are at peace, illness is dispelled, and years are prolonged. These are they who borrow humanity to aid humanity.

**Ghostly Immortals** are of mediocre nature, ignorant of the great Dao. Clinging to a single phrase, they still the mind to prevent distraction, yet their awakening arises from the stirring of consciousness. Some observe fasts and precepts, their bodies like withered wood, their hearts like dead ashes. In deep meditation, they may project their Yin spirit, and after death, their essence and spirit do not scatter. They can seize rebirth or possess another’s body. These are they who, being purely Yin without Yang, never escape the realm of ghosts.

Disciples of the Dao should neither cling nor lean to one side. Ascend the hall and enter the chamber, progressing gradually from shallow to deep. The supreme Dao is not distant—diligence will lead you there.

The *Elixir Scripture* says: *"Repairing a broken house is easy; reviving withered medicine is not hard. Only know the method of return, and gold and treasure will accumulate like mountains."* Truly, these words are so.

Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—speak of it.

In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—never depart from this. Depart from this, and you have already erred. This is the Great Dao, with reverent mindfulness as its foundation. Reverence is the wondrous beginning and end of profound learning: with spirit guiding qi, returning it to the qi cavern, never to be parted from even for an instant. Guard against the demon of sleep, ever maintaining clarity to preserve it. Should a single thought stray, spirit leaves the cavity, and the elixir will not form.

**Walking: Step Upon the Level Path**
In all movement, do not rush or run; you must proceed slowly, step by step, with spirit attending within. If you walk too hastily, prolonged movement harms the sinews, and the elixir cannot form.

**Standing: Concentrate Spirit in the Great Void**
When standing, do not let the mind wander, drifting in thought; you must inwardly direct the gaze, concentrating spirit in the Celestial Valley, Mud Pill Palace, or Great Abyss. Should wayward thoughts arise, spirit strays and qi scatters; prolonged standing harms the bones, and the elixir will not form.

**Sitting: Regulate Breath in Unbroken Continuity**
When seated in meditation, sit upright and composed, maintaining silence as your guard and softness as your practice. Know stillness as if dull, caution as if inarticulate, subtlety as if clumsy—self and world both forgotten. With wholehearted focus on the center, turn the light inward; the body must not move, for movement causes the tiger to flee, essence to scatter, lead to fly, and spirit to fail to enter qi. The mind must not waver, for wavering causes the dragon to bolt, qi to disperse, mercury to escape, and qi to fail to enter spirit. Concentrate spirit and forget form, reaching the state of forgetting forgetfulness; then body and mind attain supreme tranquility, sagely wisdom becomes perfectly luminous, and the radiance of wisdom shines in emptiness, uniting with the Dao.

In regulating the breath, begin with intention, but in time it becomes natural—calm, unhurried, and gentle. The breath must not be coarse, for coarseness causes the medicine to fly. Human primordial qi resembles that of Heaven and Earth: with each inhalation, celestial qi descends; with each exhalation, terrestrial qi ascends. Exhale to the root, inhale to the stem; exhalation makes the dragon chant and clouds arise, inhalation makes the tiger roar and winds stir. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath, during which qi traverses a lunar cycle. If but a single breath is stilled, it encompasses a year’s seasonal changes. Let the true nature of the numinous spirit follow qi, breath regulated and even, until there is no breath at all—congealing golden liquid to form the millet-grain elixir. If, in rigid sitting, thoughts scatter and spirit strays from qi, prolonged sitting harms the flesh, and the elixir will not form. As the scripture says: *"Three years of toil, ten thousand kalpas of bliss."*

**Lying Down: Sink Spirit into the Secluded Valley**
The Secluded Valley is the Earthly Belly. The primordial spirit dwells in the head by day and in the belly by night; the mechanism lies in the two eyes. When sleeping, lie with the head to the east, never on the back with limbs outstretched. You must resemble a dragon in hibernation: one hand beneath the head, one hand grasping the heel, lying on the side with bent legs, waist curled, eyes closed. Inwardly gaze upon the qi cavern, sinking spirit into the Secluded Valley, wholeheartedly guarding within, like a hen brooding her eggs—maintaining clarity even in sleep. If you lie on your back with limbs outstretched, mouth open and gasping, spirit wanders and qi scatters; prolonged lying harms qi, and the elixir will not form.

In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—let this be your constant focus, unwavering from beginning to end. Only then can attainment be achieved. The slightest deviation, and all prior effort is lost. As the scripture says: *"The three treasures—ears, eyes, mouth—seal them, let nothing pass. The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming, guarding the center."*

**Oral Instructions on the Golden Liquid and Returning Elixir: Revealing Heaven’s Mechanism**
In cultivation, nothing is more precious than forgetting words and guarding the One. Forgetting words prevents qi from scattering; guarding the One prevents spirit from departing. The One is the Supreme Ultimate, the southwest quarter—its subtlety lies in the union of Kun and Fu, an endless cycle. Spirit conceals itself in Kun (knowing the white, guarding the black), and numinous clarity naturally arises. Kun is the sixfold union, the six days. With steadfast stillness, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born; beneath the six unions, a single yang revives—this is the seventh day of Heaven and Earth’s radiant return.

Why? Lead and mercury arise from the One. The One is the origin of the Five Phases, the great reckoning number fifty-five. Subtract five to represent the Five Phases, then subtract one to represent the Supreme Ultimate—this is the One. The remaining forty-nine is divided into the Two Modes and Four Images to generate the hexagrams. The sages and immortals knew the One as lead and mercury, so they embraced the One and cultivated for forty-nine days, until yang qi revived beneath the five yins—a single yang stirring, the meeting of earth and thunder where the Heavenly Root appears. For when the earthly branch Hai reaches its end, at the first moment of Zi, return begins—the hexagram Fu reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth! Thunder within the earth is Fu: thunder is firm yang, earth is yielding yin. With firm yang beneath yielding yin, Fu is called the primordial qi. From the stillness of the Supreme Ultimate, yang is born. With wholehearted devotion, sever all scattered thoughts to seek the primordial qi. You must surrender your will to return to emptiness, for emptiness is where primordial qi is born. Thus it is said: primordial qi arises from emptiness. Emptiness does not mean annihilation or stillness; it is dwelling in the midst of dim obscurity, all six pulses stilled, true breath naturally abiding. In the great stillness of chaos, numinous clarity naturally arrives.

The oral instruction says: *"If you ask about the primordial, it is nothing; for the postnatal, you must work diligently."* Alas, people are stained by the seven emotions, entangled by karmic burdens, forming postnatal spirit rather than the wondrous primordial. Once postnatal obscuration arises, the primordial heart is veiled. Daoist cultivators lower the inner screen, seal the mouth (the Dui trigram), regulate nasal breath, restrain tongue qi, attune ear resonance, and close the valley passage. The Four Images harmonize and return to emptiness, stilling body, heart, and intent. Gather postnatal spirit and return it to the crucible of creation, uniting with qi. Ever vigilant, moment by moment centered, with long practice comes mastery.

When spirit returns to the golden crucible, the Mysterious Female establishes its foundation, capable of generating true qi. True qi transforms into true lead. Only when essence, qi, and spirit are complete does the work begin to take effect.

A minor stillness of one hundred days, a medium stillness of two hundred days, a great stillness of three hundred days. First, test the minor stillness: the spirit-light pierces through the inner screen, a crescent moon hangs in the southwest quarter, like the moon appearing at Geng on the third night—this is the initial manifestation of metallic qi. A single point of warm qi within Kan rises to strike the heart’s sovereign; with intent, guide it downward, passing through the tailbone gate, along the yellow path, over the jade pillow, ascending to the mud-pill palace, roaming the nine palaces, then descending from the upper palate. At first, it descends as a gentle warmth, like trickling water, fragrant as clarified butter, sweet as ambrosia. With the eyes, escort it; with intent, welcome it. Entering the crucible, it suffuses the four limbs—exquisite delight resides within. This is the wondrous union of minor Kan and Li.

Only now does one realize the merit of stillness. With redoubled resolve, the work advances beyond prior efforts—stillness upon stillness. When medium stillness arrives, one enters the realm of nothing-whatsoever. Sun and moon halt their motion, the celestial pivot ceases turning. In profound obscurity, the mechanism of Heaven’s Root stirs. The Kun palace resounds like thunder, the abdomen cracks like rending silk. The bladder burns with fire, the two kidneys simmer like boiling water. With spirit-breath, sink and return to the sea-bottom, gently circulate, piercing through the Three Passes. True qi, like swift thunder and raging fire, silently rises, coursing through the Six Voids. Suddenly, it soars to the mud-pill palace—wind stirs in the moon’s cavern, a radiant orb wells forth between the brows, transforming into jade liquid, cool as ice shavings, refreshing as peppermint. Descending the towering mansion, it is sent to the earthen cauldron—this is the second stage of obtaining the medicine.

Silently revolve the celestial orbit: at midnight, conduct yang fire for two hundred sixteen breaths, obtaining eight ounces of lead; at noon, withdraw yin tally for one hundred forty-four breaths, refining half a catty of mercury. When the celestial orbit’s count is complete, the fourth stage reveals further wondrous uses. At this time, spirit and essence unite like joyous lovers, soul and spirit cling like mother and child. With single-minded focus, guard this state—termed “when emotion returns to nature’s beginning.” Only then is it called the Returned Elixir, the wondrous union of great Kan and Li, the jade liquid Returned Elixir.

Cyclic and endless, it revolves without cease. Today, jade liquid enters the crucible; tomorrow, jade liquid regenerates in due time. The practice remains as before, unbroken. How splendid the scene—inexpressible in full. It arises naturally, yet I know not how it comes to be.

At this stage, the nine orifices are securely sealed. With ever-increasing dedication, the six senses attain great stability. Only when one seizes the great kalpa’s reckoning of heaven and earth does the seven-day return of heaven and earth occur. When great stillness arrives, within the vast and indistinct, one sees the sun emerging in the Geng phase, gradually growing round, suspended in the midheaven. Soon, a radiant red sun rises, ascending into the moon, uniting with it to form a luminous red orb—this is the wondrous union of true lead and true mercury, the sun and moon conjoined as one.

Then, inhale the red light through the nose—this is the spirit’s concealment in the Void-Danger cavern. Stir the wind of Xun, and the two qi harmonize along the yellow path. The Three Flowers merge in the primordial palace, metal and wood naturally unite, dragon and tiger naturally submit. Instantly, heaven and earth become clear and bright, free of clouds, revealing only a millet-grain pearl suspended in the Northern Sea, its light blazing like a torch.

Silently revolve the celestial orbit, completing the fire tally. Golden liquid flows like ghee, shaped like a millet grain, ascending to the mud-pill palace, resembling an ice pearl. Suddenly, a single drop falls into the earthen cauldron—this is the wondrous union of Qian and Kun. All mechanisms are thereby stabilized, all transformations thereby determined. From this single millet grain’s sprouting arise the countless kalpas of a thousand million eons.

This millet grain gradually grows as large as a star, its color deepening to ochre. Only through stabilizing the mechanism is the mechanism established; transformation arises from the mechanism. One mechanism gives rise to ten thousand transformations—truly, the formless millet pearl becomes the embodied real.

As the *Canticle* says:
*"Golden sand enters the five viscera,
Mist scatters like wind and clouds.
Steaming, it reaches the four limbs,
Complexion bright and lustrous."*

With this golden liquid adhering to the body, the ten-month fire work remains unbroken. Breath by breath, return to the root; ceaselessly, like a thread unspooling. Like a hen brooding her egg, like a dragon nurturing its pearl—mindfulness abides here without cease. Thoughts must not arise; if they do, fire blazes. Intent must not scatter; if it does, fire cools. Ensure neither excess nor deficiency, holding the mean in operation and rest. Daily, practice the two hexagrams: morning as Tun, evening as Meng.

Thus it is said:
*"Six hundred rounds of fire timing,
Each round meets the same."*

When the elixir fire ignites, store it between the brows—a black orb of true water enters the crucible, and the heat naturally subsides. After ten months, the infant manifests. Transfer the spirit, change the crucible, regulate the spirit to exit the shell—proceeding step by step, the sacred embryo appears, its wonders boundless.

**Signs of Verification Within the Body**

In stillness, suddenly the nose detects rare fragrances, the tongue wells with sweet springs. Above, one sees heaven; below, hell. Red clouds swirl above the crown. The eyes flash with lightning-like clarity. The ears hear celestial music, the nose flows with jade pillars. One may witness dragon and tiger in harmony, sun and moon conjoined; or see the viscera clearly, the body enveloped in golden light. Cold springs descend into the mouth—swallow them into the elixir chamber, do not spit them out, for this is the elixir. Or true qi from the kidney hall arises, piercing the mud-pill palace above and the bubbling spring below. The ears hear the thunder of a thousand drums, ten thousand roars, like a hurricane tearing the earth. Above and below glow red, the celestial fire ignites, the whole body aches, penetrating bones and sinews. The four limbs and eight vessels course with flow, the brain feels split by an axe, the bones as if shattered.

At times, one may remain unconscious for three to five days; or hear the speech of celestial beings, the mind’s ground opening wide—mountains and rivers of the earth become as clear as one’s own palm, celestial patterns and earthly veins understood, past and future made plain. A radiant glow fills the chamber, rare fragrances permeate all directions. Suddenly, one’s nature leaps beyond the bodily form, finding the four great elements foul and putrid—this is the sign of spirit’s departure, and one must swiftly draw it back. After a thousand days of practice, spiritual mastery becomes effortless: a single day’s hundred meals leave no satiety, a hundred days without food bring no hunger; wine cannot intoxicate, cold and heat cannot assail. Upon witnessing these signs and proofs, one must redouble diligence and effort, striving straight toward the supreme realm.

**Oral Instructions for the Yang Spirit’s Emergence**
Since ancient times, immortals and sages have emerged in spirit by no other wondrous method: it is one’s own original spirit, refined by golden elixir, nurtured for ten months, qi replete and spirit numinous, that casts off the womb and emerges—body beyond body, its light illuminating the nine heavens. Gathered, it takes form; dispersed, it becomes qi. The yin spirit cannot divide or transform its shape, but the yang spirit may manifest in myriad billions, now hidden, now revealed, its transformations boundless. It walks beneath sun and moon without shadow, passes through metal and stone without hindrance; a thousand or ten thousand miles are traversed in an instant. Past and future are known in full—this is what is meant by “sagely yet beyond knowing, called spirit.”

When the crown first opens, it feels as though the brain is split by a great axe—do not be alarmed. Choose an auspicious day on the yellow calendar, when the sky is cloudless and the four qi serene, and emerge toward the *kai*, *xiu*, or *sheng* directions. Upon first emergence, spiral left and right, turning to regard the spirit chamber. Only when the nine nines are complete may one distribute the qi of the five viscera and five sprouts within the body, arraying them in midair to transform into five-colored auspicious clouds. The spirit ascends and enters these clouds.

At times, heavenly demons and heterodox paths manifest in a hundred guises, seeking to lure the spirit away. Should it be ensnared even once, it will not return, entering the realm of heavenly demons—ending only in seated transformation. One must single-mindedly guard the yang spirit’s golden light as the core; the illusory scenes ahead will then recede of themselves. Draw the original spirit back to the central palace, merging and re-emerging until it appears before you, identical to one’s own form. Do not release it lightly, for upon glancing back at one’s own corpse, it will seem no more than dung, foul and loathsome. Return it once more to the spirit chamber. Only when comings and goings are thoroughly mastered may one proceed: first a single step, then back to the central palace, practicing the nine nines. Then two steps, returning and repeating the nine nines. Proceeding thus—four, five, ten, a hundred steps—each time returning to complete the nine nines. Then a *li*, three *li*, five, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand *li*, practicing until flawless. After a year or five, one may enter the grotto-heavens to refine the spirit and return to emptiness.

**Refining the Spirit and Returning to Emptiness**
After three years of pure spiritual practice, draw the yang spirit back into the mud-pill palace. No hunger, no thirst, no cold, no heat—transcending the three realms, liberated from the five phases. Forgetting spirit and merging with emptiness, the yang spirit enters the formless, perceiving only a realm of luminous clarity. Spirit and great emptiness become one body, sun and moon share a single light; the cosmos lies within, the ten thousand transformations follow the heart. One’s spirit and qi fill heaven and earth, pervading all without exception. Above and below are one sky; in an instant, ten thousand miles are traversed. Mountains and rivers of the great earth are illuminated at a glance, drifting like clouds in the vast sky, floating like a boat on the four seas—alone beyond all things. Ten thousand spirits are one spirit, ten thousand qi are one qi; in every place, everywhere, is my spirit. Gathered, it forms; dispersed, it becomes qi—this is the indestructible golden body through ten thousand kalpas.

As the saying goes:
*A thousand rivers hold a thousand moons,*
*Ten thousand miles without clouds are ten thousand miles of sky.*

Alas! A thousand sages sought its traces in vain—
The whole body is hidden within the great emptiness.
If one does not forget spirit and merge with emptiness,
one may manifest a hundred or a thousand spirits—
but how could one pervade the cosmos?
