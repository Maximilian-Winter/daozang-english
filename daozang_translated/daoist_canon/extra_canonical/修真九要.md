**Preface to the Nine Essentials of Cultivating the Real**

Cultivating the Real is the greatest matter under heaven, and also the most difficult. Precisely because it is so vast and so arduous, the ancients called it the rarest of all things in the world. This matter cannot be pursued by those who do not profoundly understand the workings of creation, who do not thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, who lack an enduring and unchanging resolve, or who do not proceed step by step. Later generations of learners, not inquiring into what this matter truly is, seek to attain the Dao before ever studying it, and aspire to become immortals before ever learning to be human. No wonder those who cultivate the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain it are as rare as unicorn horns.

From youth, I admired the Dao, but having never encountered a true master, I could not distinguish right from wrong. Thus, I wandered in confusion and nearly came to harm. Fortunately, I met my teacher, the Elder of Kan Valley, and caught the faintest scent of his fragrant breeze. Only then did I realize my past errors and come to see that most Daoists in the world are likewise mistaken. Therefore, following my teacher’s intent, I have distilled the essential principles of cultivating the Real into nine precepts, calling them the *Nine Essentials of Cultivating the Real*. This method progresses from the shallow to the profound, ascending from the lowly to the lofty, serving as a ladder for beginners. Whether studying or practicing the Dao, if one follows these nine essentials in order, one will ultimately attain deep mastery and self-realization, and be able to discern blind teachers from enlightened ones, and deviant paths from the true Way. Even if one cannot accomplish this rarest of all things under heaven, one may at least come to know that such a thing exists, and thus avoid passing through life in vain.

Written on the ninth day of the ninth month in the year *wuwu* of the Jiaqing reign (1808), by Liu Yiming, the Realized One of Simplicity and Cloud-Dwelling, in his Hermitage of Ease.

**The First Essential: Seeing Through Worldly Affairs**

Alas!

Alas!

Life in this world is but a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow—its hundred years pass in an instant. When impermanence arrives, even mountains of gold and silver cannot buy back a life; filial sons and worthy grandsons cannot share one’s sorrows. If one does not prepare early, at the critical moment one will be flustered and panicked, and King Yama will show no mercy. Once the human form is lost, one sinks into the abyss for ten thousand kalpas. Those with aspiration for the Dao must urgently break through this barrier, only then will the great thoroughfare open before them. Otherwise, with worldly attachments unsevered and deluded thoughts of attaining the Dao, though the body may have left the household life, the mind has not. Every action and movement remains bound to worldly affairs; every step and pause is but a transaction in human sentiment. Not only can one not attain the Dao, one cannot even hear of it—what value then is there in leaving the household life? Countless learners throughout the ages have trodden this path. Thus, though those who study the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, those who realize it are as rare as unicorn horns.

*Wuzhen pian* says: “I ask you: though gold be piled high as Mount Tai, can impermanence be bought off?”
*Liaodao ge* says: “First lay down all worldly affairs, then delve deeply into the principles.” These words show that worldly matters are all illusory, while the matter of life and destiny is most real. To know the real, one must first abandon the false. Why? Once one clings to the false, the mind is enslaved by it; when one thing is false, all becomes false. Day by day, one drifts farther from the Dao, and is no longer one who cherishes life and destiny. Failing to cherish life and destiny, one clings to emptiness and unreality, passing the years in vain, growing old and dying—what benefit is there in that?

Of old, Lü Dongbin was awakened by a single dream and all his thoughts dissolved at once; Mazu realized the truth of death and attained the Dao most swiftly. This is because they first saw through worldly affairs before cultivating the real. Thus, their realization of the Dao and attainment of truth came more easily than for others. Moreover, leaving the household life to cultivate the Way is originally predicated on seeing through worldly affairs. If one has not seen through them yet forces oneself to leave the household life, it is a mere empty name, lacking substance. One seeks to ascend to heaven but instead falls to earth—this is to court failure. Is it not a waste of effort?

I urge learners, whether householders or renunciates, if they wish to discern the great matter of their own lives, to first thoroughly examine worldly affairs. Examine them again and again, until they are found utterly devoid of flavor. Only then will one know that all conditions are empty, and the matter of life and destiny is paramount. From this point, one may strike out with a single stroke all the false and illusory affairs outside the self. With feet planted firmly on the ground, one seeks teachers and visits friends, advancing with courage and vigor, forgetting the body for the sake of the Dao. Naturally, one’s sincerity will move heaven, and the patriarchs will secretly lend their aid—then true beings will come to guide one.

**The Second Essential: Accumulating Virtue and Cultivating Conduct**

*Wuzhen pian* says: “Without cultivating conduct and accumulating hidden virtue, one will constantly encounter demonic obstacles.” Thus, accumulating virtue and cultivating conduct are the essential tasks of those who cultivate the Dao. To speak of the Dao while abandoning virtue is heretical and deviant, a heterodox path—how far astray it is!

Therefore, the sages of antiquity first clarified the Dao; the worthies of antiquity first accumulated virtue. There has never been one who became a sage without clarifying the Dao, nor one who became a worthy without accumulating virtue. Thus, to aspire to sagehood, one must first aspire to worthiness; to attain the Dao, one must first accumulate virtue. Dao and virtue are employed together, with inner and outer mutually aiding each other—thus the learning and practice of sages and worthies are achieved.

The Dao is a matter for oneself; virtue is a matter for others. Cultivating the Dao has limits, but accumulating virtue is boundless. From ancient times to the present, even after immortals, buddhas, gods, and sages have attained the Dao, they must still harmonize with the world and accumulate merit and conduct, waiting until three thousand merits are complete and eight hundred deeds are fulfilled before receiving the celestial decree. Moreover, the great Dao of the Golden Elixir is envied by gods and ghosts; only those of great loyalty and filial piety can know it, and only those of great worthiness and virtue dare transmit it. Even if one forcibly transmits it to those who know it, gods and ghosts will be displeased and inevitably send down calamities in secret, cutting short their lifespan. This not only brings no benefit but harms them.

Since receiving the teachings of the Immortal of Kangu Valley, I have embraced the spirit of great impartiality. Whenever I encounter those of aspiration, I wish to guide them. Occasionally, I may hint at the essentials and observe their subsequent progress. Before long, they become self-satisfied and complacent, unable to delve deeper, and eventually grow lax over time, their resolve and spirit entirely lost. Their stinginess, greed, and afflictions exceed those of ordinary people. Several individuals before and after have all been like this. Alas!

Such individuals must be those whose ancestors lacked virtue and who themselves lack conduct, thus beginning with diligence but ending in laxity, losing the true essence and becoming irredeemable. Due to my own carelessness, I have spoken indiscreetly to the unworthy and repeatedly encountered demonic obstructions. Fortunately, no great harm was done, and the true treasure was not stolen away. Having learned from this, I thereafter held my tongue, no longer daring to lightly reveal the subtleties of the Dao. One must await those of great capacity to whom the entire treasury may be entrusted.

Worldly learners, upon entering the gate, regard immortality as an exceedingly easy matter, deceiving and exploiting the ten directions while remaining ignorant of taboos. They never reflect that every thread and grain is the blood and sweat of the ten directions, that every sip and bite is the toil of sentient beings. Some ensnare others with empty Chan phrases; some use false Daoist methods to amass wealth; some employ alchemical arts to swindle. Their schemes are countless. One day, they will owe a tenfold debt—how will they ever repay it? The ancients said, *"Whether they have horns or not, one thing is certain: they all have tails."* Must this not refer to such people?

Those with aspiration in this Dao must place utmost importance on virtue and conduct, establishing their own integrity. Do not act in confusion and ruin your future prospects. What is virtue? It is to show compassion to the elderly and pity the poor, to cherish orphans and pity widows, to dispense medicine and offer tea, to repair bridges and mend roads, to aid the imperiled and rescue the distressed, to value righteousness over wealth, and to widely practice convenience for others. What is conduct? It is to endure hardship for the benefit of others, to diligently perform menial tasks, to bestow virtue without expecting reward, to harbor no grudges against those who wrong you, to make no boast of your merits, to fear no difficulties, and to act without hesitation when righteousness calls.

Those who accumulate virtue and establish conduct, the longer they persist, the greater their strength. Their virtue subdues gods and ghosts, their character transcends the common, and when a superior person sees them, they are immediately recognized. The Great Dao is within reach. Otherwise, if one accumulates no virtue and cultivates no conduct, yet vainly hopes to attain the Dao, even if they encounter a superior person, they may conceal their faults and feign goodness, believing they can deceive others. Little do they know that others see through them as clearly as if their lungs and liver were exposed.

There is yet another class of unprincipled individuals who commit every kind of evil, carousing in taverns by day and frequenting brothels by night, their mouths preaching morality while their hearts harbor the thievery of Robber Zhi. They harm others for personal gain, their misdeeds bizarre and countless. Instead of repenting, they complain of their own lack of fortune and affinity, slandering the alchemical classics as nothing but deceit. Truly, they are seeds of hell, destined for rebirth in lower realms. Even to be human again would be beyond their reach—how then could they ever aspire to immortality?

Alas! Virtue pertains to one’s conduct in the world; the Dao pertains to the transmission of immortality by a master. Without accumulating virtue, how can one cultivate the Dao? If worldly affairs cannot be managed, how can the Dao of immortality be achieved? Should one not reflect deeply on this?

**Exhausting the Principles as the Third Essential**
The *Shuogua Zhuan* states: *"Exhaust the principles and fully realize your nature to reach destiny."* From this, we know that the study of fully realizing nature to reach destiny depends entirely on exhausting the principles to determine right and wrong. If one thoroughly exhausts the principles, then nature can be preserved, destiny can be secured, and one may directly enter the supreme and utterly true realm. If one’s grasp of the principles is vague, then destiny is difficult to cultivate, nature is difficult to comprehend, and one will ultimately face the regret of having wasted their life in vain.

Today’s learners blindly leave the household, blindly study the Dao, and blindly cultivate practice. If they are muddled in life, how can they attain clarity in death? What are nature and destiny, that one should act so recklessly?

The Dao of the Golden Elixir encompasses the Dao of heaven and earth, usurps the Dao of creation, and is most revered, most noble, most divine, and most wondrous—far from easy to comprehend. Yet learners do not consider what their own nature and destiny truly are, nor do they discern the meaning of the ancestral masters’ teachings. They eat their fill all day without applying their minds, vainly hoping that a few words of insight will enable them to attain the Dao. By day, they wander and idle; by night, they sleep soundly. They dismiss the alchemical classics as useless words and the master’s writings as mere tricks to deceive people. Those who falsely claim to possess the Dao mislead others with errors, and those who vainly hope to achieve truth lead the blind with blindness. Even among the few sincere learners, most merely glance superficially, never deeply applying their thoughts to exhaust the true principles.

The ancients also said, *"If one seeks true meaning on paper, then everywhere would be Great Luo Immortals."* This was spoken specifically for those who do not seek a teacher, not to imply that the alchemical classics and master’s writings are useless. Later generations, misunderstanding the ancients’ intent, often use this as an excuse to ignore the scriptures entirely—a grave mistake.

The words of the immortal perfected are not uttered carelessly; every character and phrase conceals wondrous meanings. They expended immeasurable effort, like an old woman’s kindness, to create stepping stones for later generations and to leave guidance for the teaching. Yet some revile and slander them—how can their sin be spoken of? Even the actions of later superior persons and worthies remain within the bounds set by the ancients. Upon close examination, they may not surpass the ancients. If today’s "superior persons" do not deceive learners, then it is clear that the immortal perfected of old did not mislead later generations.

I urge those with aspiration to take the ancients’ teachings, study them meticulously, and seek a teacher’s decisive guidance. Only when one connects past and present without the slightest doubt may one proceed with practice. Beware of relying on your own cleverness and dismissing others, and do not blindly follow the clamor of the crowd, allowing others to mislead you. As for learners who are illiterate, they must still discern true meaning in common speech. For within common speech lies the Great Dao—it is only that people do not reflect deeply.

Take, for example, phrases like *"lacking dignity,"* *"lacking human form,"* *"having a knack,"* *"being at ease,"* *"being topsy-turvy,"* *"adapting to circumstances,"* *"responding to opportunities,"* *"extracting gold from sand,"* *"creating something from nothing,"* *"barely surviving,"* *"selfish and unyielding,"* *"reckless,"* *"disregarding one’s life,"* *"knowing only oneself and not others,"* *"visiting three households is not as good as guarding one,"* *"treating others with courtesy will yield returns,"* *"knowing only one thing and not the other."* These expressions reveal profound celestial mechanisms. Why not take one or two as a starting point for awakening, pondering them day and night?

Though the great principles remain obscure, as understanding gradually unfolds, one draws nearer to the Dao—thus the years are not spent in vain. This study of investigating principles is open to all, regardless of wisdom or folly; if one’s efforts remain unbroken, enlightenment will come with time. Yet what one awakens to may be merely private insights, and one must not rashly act upon them. Should one encounter an enlightened teacher, one must thoroughly examine matters from beginning to end, pursuing clarity until true knowledge and penetrating insight align with the heart and hand—only then can one avoid error.

If one knows the former but not the latter, the latter but not the former; if one knows yin but not yang, yang but not yin; if one knows the essence but not its function, or its function but not the essence; if one knows action but not non-action, or non-action but not action; if one perceives the primal barrier yet does not recognize the arising of the elixir, or knows the elixir arises but not its maturity; if one knows the formation of the cinnabar but not its ingestion, or the conception of the embryo but not its liberation; if one knows the civil refinement but not the martial tempering, or the martial tempering but not the civil refinement; if one knows the yang fire but not the yin tally, or the advancement of fire but not its restraint; if one knows the gentle nurturing but not the withdrawal and addition—then the slightest deviation leads to an error of a thousand miles, and true attainment remains unattainable.

Moreover, yin and yang have inner and outer aspects, the Five Phases possess truth and falsity. The work of cultivating nature and life proceeds in two stages, with the prior and posterior heavens distinct. There is truth and falsity, truth within falsity, falsity within truth, truth within truth, and falsity within falsity. If these mechanisms are not thoroughly investigated, practice will not reach completion; if they are not clearly discerned, cultivation will not succeed.

Thus did Ancestor Lü fail thrice in completing the returned elixir, only to perfect his work upon obtaining Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine*; and Purple Clarity endured the peril of midnight wind and thunder, requiring renewed cultivation to resolve the matter. If even these two elders—leaders among immortals—faced unforeseen setbacks from the slightest obscurity, how much more so for others? Scholars must reflect deeply upon this.

**The Fourth Essential: Seeking a True Master**
The ancient immortals said: “Without a master’s guidance, even the gods and immortals in heaven would have no abode.” The *Awakening to Reality* also states: “Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without encountering a true master, do not rashly speculate.” Truly, the study of nature and life demands transmission from a master—it cannot be known through reckless conjecture or private inference. Formerly, Daoguang attained sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration, yet knew this was not the supreme endeavor; later, meeting Apricot Grove, he fulfilled the Great Dao. Shangyang, having received the secret of “following the督,” dared not rest content but still sought out Green City to perfect the firing times. Sanfeng toiled for over a decade on Mount Song without gain, until the guidance of Immortals Zheng and Lü revealed the great matter. Even mundane minor arts and humble skills rely on a master’s transmission to be understood—how much more so the great affair of nature and life, which cannot be grasped without a teacher?

For the Dao of nature and life is the art of stealing yin and yang, seizing the workings of creation, reversing life and death, twisting the mechanisms of qi, and aligning with the prior heavens so that heaven itself does not oppose it—a path unfathomable to ghosts and spirits, unreadable by milfoil and tortoise. Those who attain it ascend instantly to sagehood and cross directly to the other shore. It is the greatest affair in the world, and the most difficult. Without a sage-master whispering the secrets into one’s ear, how could it be known?

Yet there are three thousand heterodox paths and seventy-two grades of elixir methods, where the false harms the true and the counterfeit disrupts the genuine. Who is the blind master, and who is the enlightened one? Distinguishing them is most difficult. Yet discernment is also easy. Generally, a superior person emerging in the world carries an extraordinary self-regard, strikes a unique chord, avoids indiscriminate associations, does not flatter the world, shuns factions, seeks no fame, relies not on talent, pursues no profit, deceives no one, and avoids eccentricity. Every word and utterance benefits the world’s moral order; every action and pause greatly aids the sagely teachings. Greed, anger, delusion, and attachment are all absent; intention, necessity, obstinacy, and self are wholly transformed. Their noble character is beyond all others; their spirit is free and untrammeled, unattainable by the common crowd. If they occasionally guide aspirants, they first subject them to a thousand trials and a hundred refinements to test their authenticity. Only when they find flawless white jade will they deign to reveal the slightest hint. If the seeker proves unworthy, they dare not lightly disclose the celestial mechanism. This is what makes an enlightened master.

As for blind masters, they turn nothing into something, emptiness into fullness, refusing to reflect on their own errors while teaching others the wrong path. Some point to men and women as yin and yang; others take grains as the millet-pearl; some regard furnace fire as external elixir; others refine heart and kidneys as internal elixir; some take visualization as spirit-congealing; others practice midnight-noon circulation as withdrawal and addition; some turn the windlass as the celestial cycle; others mistake dull emptiness for non-action; some regard qi-circulation as action; others take forgetting form as cultivation of stillness; some refine sleep as retreating yin; others ingest sulfur as advancing yang; still others shun the five grains to seek longevity. Such examples are too numerous to count. These sorts of people lack merit and virtue, fail to establish moral integrity, don monastic robes while carrying money pouches, wear clerical crowns while harboring serpentine hearts. They fixate on wealth and status, forget the Dao in hardship, drink wine and eat meat without regard for the blood and sweat of the ten directions, ruin their reputations and betray the teachings, heedless of sinking into hell for ten thousand kalpas. In their movements, they scheme only for money; in their actions, they fret solely over food and clothing. A single bow, and they take disciples; a cup of tea or a meal, and they transmit the Dao. Borrowing the gateways of sages and worthies, they deceive themselves and the world; pilfering the words of immortals and buddhas, they fabricate monstrosities and conjure demons. They care only for their own warmth and fullness, heedless of others’ life or death.

If students listen to their words without examining their conduct, mistaking them for the enlightened, they will inevitably fall into the net and harm their nature and life. Once deluded by their words and mistaking the false for the true, the knot becomes inextricable. Even if a lofty immortal or sage-master wishes to lift them up, there will be no opening to enter. Countless Daoists in the world have suffered this calamity. Among the black-robed and yellow-robed, who has not wandered east and west, accumulating a few cases and a few sayings? Yet if one judges others by mere verbal eloquence, then everyone is a buddha, each one an immortal. But ask: among the thousands upon thousands who study the Dao, how many have attained it? Generally, sages and worthies are rarely seen, immortals and buddhas are seldom met—precisely because they are rarely seen and seldom met that they are called superior persons. A superior person stands out from the crowd, rises above the common throng—how could mere verbal eloquence make one a superior person?

In those years, my master secretly imparted a touchstone to test the quality of a person’s character. When encountering a cultivator, test them with wine, sex, wealth, and temper. If they remain unmoved, they are surely no ordinary person. Further, question them with the *Awakening to Reality* and the *Uniting the Three*—if they respond fluently, they are an enlightened master. This method has been tested repeatedly, never failing. I now offer it to all fellow seekers.

**The Fifth Essential: Refining the Self and Laying the Foundation**
The *Spring in Qin Garden* states: “The sevenfold returned elixir lies within a person, but one must first refine the self and await the time.”

The *Awakening to Reality* states: “To refine the ninefold cyclical elixir, first refine the self and master the heart.” The Dao of true refinement holds that returning the elixir is easiest, while refining the self is most difficult. Without refining the self, to seek the returned elixir is utterly impossible. The returned elixir is like the beams and pillars of a house; refining the self is like its foundation. Without laying the foundation, the beams and pillars have nowhere to stand; without refining the self, the elixir cannot coalesce. Once a disciple receives the master’s oral instructions, they must urgently refine the self. When refinement is thorough, at the moment of tending the furnace, all flows smoothly, responding to the heart’s intent—lead and mercury unite, nature and emotion harmonize, and there is no risk of gaining only to lose again.

Since birth, humans have exhausted yang to generate yin, losing the primordial and relying on the acquired. The original endowment of youth is no longer ours. Compounded by a hundred worries that disturb the heart and ten thousand affairs that weary the body, essence leaks, spirit dims, and qi decays, rendering this illusory form like a cracked pot or shattered urn. A broken pot cannot hold water; a body in decline cannot contain the elixir—it is the same principle. Thus, though the acquired is but a borrowed vessel, it is not the material for the returned elixir. Yet before the elixir is returned, one still depends on it for success, and it must not be damaged. The ancients said: “Without this dreamlike illusion, how could the great task be accomplished? Once the great task is done, what use is this dreamlike illusion?” They also said: “Fear not the absence of the primordial true seed, only the lack of abundant acquired radiance.” When the acquired is full, the primordial can be restored; when the primordial is restored, the acquired can be transformed. How can the work of refining the self and laying the foundation be taken lightly?

What is refining the self? To curb greed and desire is refining the self; to secure the yin essence is refining the self; to subdue the demon of sleep is refining the self; to endure hardship for others’ benefit is refining the self; to rouse worldly toil is refining the self; to focus the heart’s effort and wholly abandon worldly affairs is refining the self; to advance with courage and take the Dao as one’s duty is refining the self; to tread firmly and exert effort at every step is refining the self; to remain unswayed by wealth or poverty, unmoved by honor or disgrace, unbroken by power or force is refining the self; to cloak jade in coarse cloth, to be profoundly wise yet appear foolish, to be supremely skillful yet seem clumsy is refining the self. The practices of refining the self are many, but they all converge on the absence of self. Laozi said: “My greatest affliction is that I have a self; if I had no self, what affliction would I have?” When refining the self reaches the point of no-self, one transcends the body yet preserves it. The acquired becomes stable, the foundation firm, and the primordial true yang returns, merging into oneness. “The primordial qi, the acquired qi—whoever attains them is ever in a drunken haze,” and within an hour, the elixir is complete.

If one hastily performs a moment’s work in refining the self, the acquired will not be secure, and though the primordial may be near, it will not belong to me. For when lead arrives, mercury fails to greet it; when Kan comes, Li does not receive it; it arrives, but I am not prepared. Alas! When laying the foundation, one must use the bellows; when refining the self, one still needs true lead. Refining the self and laying the foundation—how can these be easy matters?

**The Sixth Essential: Harmonizing Yin and Yang**
The Dao of true refinement is the Dao of the golden elixir; the Dao of the golden elixir is the Dao of creation; the Dao of creation is the Dao of yin and yang. The *Book of Changes* states: “The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.” It also says: “Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things are transformed into harmony; male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things are born.” Thus, solitary yin does not generate, and solitary yang does not grow—only when yin and yang harmonize can life flourish. The Dao of the golden elixir is solely about gathering the primordial true unity of qi. This primordial qi is formless and imageless, invisible, inaudible, and intangible—it arises from emptiness and nothingness. The sage embodies the real to manifest the void, and the existent to manifest the nonexistent. The real and existent are true yin and true yang; the void and nonexistent are the qi of the waxing and waning crescents. The qi of the crescents is the primordial qi, and without the union of yin and yang, it cannot take form.

To cultivate the great Dao of the golden elixir, there is no other method apart from this yin and yang. Yet yin and yang are not uniform—if one mistakes the false for the true, labor is in vain, and harm outweighs benefit. One must discern carefully. The yin and yang of male and female are the yin and yang of the mundane world; the yin and yang of heart and kidney are the yin and yang of the illusory body; the yin and yang of sun and moon are the yin and yang of heaven and earth; the solstices are the yin and yang of the year; the new and full moons are the yin and yang of the month; midnight and noon are the yin and yang of the day; the second and fourth solar terms are the yin and yang of an hour. None of these are the yin and yang of the golden elixir.

The yin and yang of the golden elixir take one’s own domain as yin and another’s as yang; oneself as Li and the other as Kan. The single yin within Li is true yin, and the single yang within Kan is true yang. To “take from Kan to fill Li” is to seek true yang with true yin and to nourish true yin with true yang. Moreover, yin and yang are further distinguished as internal and external: the internal yin and yang, moving in sequence, pertain to matters after birth—these are the acquired and the human Dao; the external yin and yang, moving in reverse, pertain to matters before birth—these are the primordial and the immortal Dao. Neither internal nor external yin and yang bear the forms of male and female; they are neither form nor emptiness, yet both form and emptiness; neither existence nor nonexistence, yet both existence and nonexistence. If one clings to the forms of form and emptiness, existence and nonexistence, they are not the true traces of true yin and true yang.

Having grasped yin and yang, one must harmonize them to perfect equilibrium—neither excess nor deficiency, neither bias nor deviation, neither haste nor delay, neither presence nor absence, neither attachment nor detachment, neither impatience nor timidity. At times yang moves and yin follows; at times yin stirs and yang responds. Sometimes yang is employed within yin, or yin within yang; sometimes yin is borrowed to preserve yang, or yang used to restrain yin. One may draw upon the internal yin and yang to assist the external, or employ the external yin and yang to supplement the internal. When internal and external unite in the Dao, the Golden Elixir coalesces spontaneously from emptiness. Taking and ingesting it, one attains longevity and immortality.

The *Cantong Qi* states: *"Like kinds readily yield their efficacy; unlike kinds defy skillful work."*
The *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"The inner medicine is akin to the outer; when the inner flows, the outer must likewise flow. The elixir-head unites with its kindred, nurtured through twofold cultivation."*
Zhang Sanfeng observes: *"In the world, yin and yang—male paired with female—beget sons and grandsons, generation after generation. Proceeding in sequence yields the mortal; reversing the course yields the immortal—all hinges on this single inversion."*
The Dao of harmonizing yin and yang is fully encompassed herein.

**Seventh Essential: Discerning the Fire-Times with Clarity**
The ancient scriptures declare: *"The sage transmits the medicine but not the fire; the fire-times have ever been known to few."* Thus, while the medicines may be readily understood, the fire-times are most difficult. Though the medicines are hard to find, once a true teacher points them out, their reality becomes immediately evident, requiring no further search—hence their ease of recognition. As for the fire-times, they encompass civil refinement and martial tempering, initiation and repose, internal and external, before and after, moments and measures, urgency and restraint, cessation and sufficiency. Each stage possesses its own fire-time, and every step its corresponding fire-time—endlessly shifting, to be applied in accord with the moment, that precision may be achieved. A hair’s breadth of error leads one astray by a thousand miles. Thus, they are most difficult.

What is *fire*? The divine work of forging and refining.
What is *time*? The moment of application.
The moment of application lies in the primal chaos just before its division into yin and yang; the divine work of forging unfolds where heaven and human unite, where being and nonbeing dissolve.

There are external fire-times and internal fire-times.
The external fire-time gathers the Five Agents and harmonizes the Four Images;
The internal fire-time involves bathing, nurturing, guarding against peril, and averting danger.
Though the inner and outer medicines are identical, their fire-time applications differ greatly. Without a true teacher, how could one know them truly?

Gathering the Five Agents and harmonizing the Four Images is to steal the generative vitality of heaven and earth, to pilfer the ancestral qi of yin and yang, to turn the Dipper’s handle and revolve the celestial pivot, to open the Gate of Kun and seal the Gate of Gen. Its subtlety lies in the moment when, beneath accumulated yin, the solitary yang returns. At this time, one’s virtue merges with heaven and earth, one’s clarity aligns with the sun and moon, one’s sequence accords with the four seasons, and one’s fortune harmonizes with spirits and gods. This is what is meant by *"a year has but one month, a month but one day, a day but one hour."* Only in this hour—easily lost, difficult to find, easily missed, hard to encounter—does one either enter the path of life or the path of death. The sage, seizing this hour, moves the talismans of yin and the fires of yang, piercing the celestial root and boring into the lunar cavern, shattering the primordial chaos to grasp the millet-like pearl, reversing the seventy-two seasonal pivots, seizing the vital qi of the twenty-four solar terms. Here, water and fire intermingle; metal and wood converge; lead and mercury unite; life is established and destiny secured; one emerges from death into life. If this hour passes, yin and yang separate, the true retreats while the false takes charge—already fallen into the postnatal, it is no longer usable.

As for the fire-times of the elixir:
*"By the winding river’s bank, the moon’s radiance gleams"*—the fire-time for generating the medicine;
*"When the wind’s signal arrives, seek the root"*—the fire-time for gathering the medicine;
*"When the two medicines are truly born of water, if one waits for the third, it cannot be advanced"*—the fire-time for maturity or tenderness;
*"When lead encounters the birth of gui, swiftly gather; when gold meets the full moon’s distance, it is unfit to taste"*—the fire-time for urgency or restraint;
*"Suddenly seeing the dragon appear in the field, one must fiercely refine and urgently temper; only hearing the tiger’s roar enter the den, one should reverse course and act contrarily"*—the martial fire-time;
*"Slowly guard the medicine furnace, observe the fire-time, simply settle the spirit and rest in naturalness"*—the civil fire-time;
*"Before refining the Returned Elixir, refine it urgently; once refined, know when to cease"*—the nurturing fire-time;
*"Only after the fire’s power is harmonized does the yellow sprout gradually grow"*—the fire-time of elixir completion;
*"Entrust the mind with care, diligently protect and sustain, watching the fire-time within the furnace take flight"*—the fire-time for preserving the elixir.
These are all fire-times of the Returned Elixir.

As for the fire-times of the Great Elixir, they possess distinct subtleties:
*"Receiving qi auspiciously, guard against misfortune upon completion"*—the fire-time for embryo formation;
*"For seven days, the primordial chaos dies and revives; all depends on the companion’s regulation of water and fire"*—the fire-time for consolidation;
*"Return it to the earthen crucible, firmly sealed; next, let the flowing pearl be matched"*—the fire-time for nurturing the embryo;
*"Use lead, but not common lead; once true lead is used, it too is discarded"*—the fire-time for withdrawal and addition;
*"Do not toil ceaselessly at the elixir furnace and river chariot; the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath naturally endure"*—the fire-time for bathing;
*"Within a single day, the twelve hours—wherever the intent reaches, all may be done"*—the fire-time for averting danger;
*"The infant is a vessel of true qi; after ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the sage’s foundation"*—the fire-time for embryo completion;
*"When the host of yin is entirely stripped away, the elixir ripens, leaping from the mortal cage to live ten thousand years"*—the fire-time for shedding the embryo.
These are the fire-times of the Great Elixir from beginning to end.

Moreover, there are the fire-times for both internal and external use:

*"When common folk seek celestial matters, they must employ worldly wealth"*—the fire-time within the fire-time of gathering the medicine;
*"In the crescent moon furnace, jade buds arise; in the cinnabar tripod, mercury levels"*—the fire-time within the fire-time of congealing the elixir;
*"On the seventh day, yang revives at the head, merging with the myriad spirits in wondrous function"*—the fire-time within the fire-time of embryo formation;
*"Neither being nor non-being stands; self and other all dissolve into emptiness"*—the fire-time within the fire-time of shedding the embryo.

Herein lies the secret of the fire-times for both internal and external elixirs.

Within these, there are yet finer subtleties and profound mysteries, which depend on spiritual illumination and reside in the practitioner. They adapt to the moment, transcending transmission through written words.

**The Eighth Essential of External Medicine for Completing Destiny**

*The Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"Cease all cunning pretense in your efforts; recognize the deathless method of the other household."*
*Yuanduzi* says:
*"The qi of prior Heaven comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness."*
It is called "the other household" and "emptiness and nothingness"—thus we know it is not a thing produced by one’s own body. Upon reaching this point, all heavens and men should be astonished and doubtful.

Heaven, through yin-yang and the Five Agents, transforms and generates the myriad things, giving them form through qi. Humans receive Heaven’s correct qi, becoming the most spiritually endowed of all beings. Wherever this qi exists, so too does this principle. Qi is destiny; principle is nature. Nature and destiny are what Heaven bestows. Heaven first grants them, and Heaven ultimately reclaims them—this is the inevitable course of things. If one contends with Heaven using the ephemeral substances of the postnatal body, one remains entirely within the workings of creation. How then can one escape its bounds? Without the Dao of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, the vain hope of preserving nature and destiny is utterly without foundation.

The Dao of the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir is the Dao of prior Heaven. The Dao of prior Heaven encompasses Heaven and Earth, moves yin and yang, and holds the outer mechanism of Heaven and Earth. Thus it can resolve life and death, avoid the cycle of rebirth, depart the mortal dust, and enter the sage’s foundation. Yet this mechanism, though distant as a thousand miles, is as near as a footstep. Alas, people refuse to recognize it earnestly, growing ever more distant and estranged, never turning back, thus forfeiting their nature and destiny. If there are determined scholars who exhaustively investigate its true principles, suddenly shattering their doubts, resolutely letting go, and directly transcending to the other shore, then the resplendent Golden Elixir may be accomplished in a single day—no need to wait three years or nine cycles.

Yet while the elixir’s completion is easy, its cultivation is most difficult. Without the Dao of extending destiny through the interplay of the insubstantial and substantial, the transformations of yin and yang, and the arts of longevity, the Golden Elixir will not form. The Dao of extending destiny through the arts is the Dao of seizing Heaven and Earth’s power of creation, stealing the mechanism of yin-yang’s ebb and flow, reversing life and death, and wielding the Dipper’s handle—it is the Dao of prior Heaven that Heaven itself does not oppose.

*The Yin Fu Jing* states:
*"Its mechanism of theft—none in the world can know it, none can see it."*
*The Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"It begins with effort, which people find hard to perceive; only when it reaches effortlessness do the multitudes begin to understand. Though they see effortlessness as the essential wonder, how could they know that effort is the root?"*

Since humans lost the prior Heaven after its dispersal, true yang has been deficient. Though the form may be male, within it is all yin. If one clings to the self in cultivation, one merely works with tears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and bodily humors—with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent—with the Seven Emotions, Six Desires, Five Aggregates, Eight Consciousnesses, Three Corpses, and hundred acupoints. Thus yin supplements yin—how can destiny be connected? How can the elixir be connected?

Thus the *Cantong Qi* states:
*"When a hen hatches her own eggs, the chicks are not whole."*
This is the proof.

What the alchemical classics call "external medicine" refers to the fact that one’s own true yang has scattered outward, no longer belonging to oneself but lodging in another household—hence the name "external." Deluded people, misunderstanding the words "other" and "external," variously guess it to mean sexual yoga with women, the Five Metals and Eight Stones, Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, clouds and mist, grasses and trees, or other tangible things. Little do they know that the true Great Medicine is neither form nor emptiness, neither being nor non-being. It is the primordial qi before the separation of the Primordial Chaos, the original benevolence before Heaven and Earth divided. In its natural course, it generates humans and things; in reversal, it makes immortals and buddhas.

The sage, using the method to pursue and gather it, congeals a single grain of millet-pearl within an hour, called the Yang Elixir, also known as the Returning Elixir, the Golden Elixir, or true lead. With this true lead, one touches one’s own yin mercury, and like a cat catching a mouse, in an instant the dry mercury congeals into the sacred embryo. This is the origin of the name "external medicine."

Let us elaborate in detail:
*"The medicine emerges from the southwest, the Kun position—how can one seek the Kun position apart from the human?"*—external medicine;
*"On the third day, Zhen produces geng; by the winding riverbank, the moon’s radiance gleams"*—external medicine;
*"In the golden tripod, cinnabar holds mercury within; in the jade pool, silver first descends into the water"*—external medicine;
*"Take the solid from the Kan position in the heart, and transform the yin within the Li palace in the abdomen"*—external medicine;
*"In the crescent moon furnace, jade buds arise; in the cinnabar tripod, mercury levels"*—external medicine;
*"When the qi of Kan and Li harmonize, the yellow sprout naturally grows"*—external medicine.

Yet if the medicine is originally external, how can it be generated within? If the medicine belongs to another, how can it become one’s own?

The classics say:
*"When the Five Agents follow their natural generation, the dharma-realm is a fiery pit; when the Five Agents are inverted, the great earth becomes seven treasures."*

Wood by nature gives birth to fire, yet here fire reverses to generate wood; metal by nature gives birth to water, yet here water reverses to generate metal. Within metal, wood, water, and fire lie the two earths of wu and ji, harmonizing the four images to align with the Five Agents. As one qi operates, it recomposes into a single Supreme Ultimate. When the fire’s work reaches its day, it refines into a single grain of utmost yang elixir. Taking and ingesting it, one attains longevity without death, sharing spring with heaven and earth, vying in radiance with sun and moon—this is what is meant by *"a single grain of golden elixir swallowed into the belly, only then does one know my fate is not ruled by heaven."*

Alas! Ten thousand taels of gold cannot purchase it, yet it is freely given to all at the crossroads. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas—most revered, most precious. Those who attain it ascend to sagehood in an instant, not awaiting future lives or later ages, but gaining the spiritual powers of buddhahood in the present. Why then would one not delight in cultivating virtue and practicing the Dao?

**Internal Medicine: The Ninth Essential for Cultivating Nature**
The *Daodejing* states: *"With desire, observe its apertures; without desire, observe its wonders."* These two lines encompass the beginning and end of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, the essential key for learners past and present. Without external medicine, one cannot transcend yin and yang; without internal medicine, form and spirit cannot both attain perfection.

Those of superior virtue cultivate internal medicine, and external medicine is thereby complete; those of lesser virtue cultivate external medicine, and internal medicine only then takes shape. External medicine is the gradual method; internal medicine, the sudden. External medicine elevates one beyond the mundane; internal medicine leads one to sagehood.

*"With desire, observe its apertures"* refers to external medicine—usurping the workings of creation, matters of the illusory body. *"Without desire, observe its wonders"* refers to internal medicine—the study of illuminating the mind and seeing nature, matters of the dharma-body. If one attains external medicine but neglects internal medicine, one remains but *"a fool whose lifespan equals heaven and earth,"* as Lü Zu warned. Moreover, the great elixir is difficult to obtain as external medicine; once external medicine is in hand, it becomes internal medicine. The sacred embryo takes form, and the work of the *Yin Fu* lies precisely here.

The *Cantong Qi* states: *"The three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth—close and seal them, let nothing pass. The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the center."* This is what is meant by *"without desire, observe its wonders."*

*"Without desire, observe its wonders"* is the Dao of non-action, yet non-action does not mean the lifelessness of withered wood or cold ash, nor the absence of all affairs. Within it lie the labors of morning *zhun* and evening *meng*, the extraction of lead and addition of mercury, the vigilance against danger and the safeguarding of the sacred embryo. Thus the Five Agents are fused and yin-yang transformed, until Dao and method are both forgotten, being and non-being dissolve, frost descends in the tenth month, and a body arises beyond the body. Knowing the future by understanding the past, one returns to the realm of true suchness and great awakening—this is what the buddhas and patriarchs call the *"treasury of the true dharma-eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana,"* the supreme vehicle of the Great Dao.

Yet if one attempts this practice before completing the cultivation of life, the root remains unstable, hollow and insubstantial, never tempered in the great forging furnace. Even if one attains the nature of true suchness, a single leak will invite the peril of *"casting off one body only to enter another."*

Later generations, misunderstanding the intent behind the ancients’ words, often dismiss the principles of nature as insignificant. But I ask: among the learners of this world, how many truly comprehend the mind of nirvana? How many truly perceive the nature of true suchness? The mind of nirvana, the nature of true suchness—pristine and bare, utterly unadorned, perfectly round, radiantly luminous, penetrating heaven and earth—cannot be grasped by the postnatal mind of human emotions and temperament.

The ancients also spoke of *"cultivating nature without cultivating life, leaving the yin spirit of ten thousand kalpas far from sagehood,"* a warning specifically for those who cultivate nature without first cultivating life. But if one has already completed the cultivation of life, how can one not cultivate nature? Without cultivating nature, one remains rigid in responding to phenomena, possessing wealth but no authority. Without cultivating nature, though the illusory body may be liberated, the dharma-body remains bound. Without cultivating nature, one may attain longevity but not freedom from birth. Without cultivating nature, though one may understand the beginning of the incarnate life, the state before birth remains incomplete.

The work of internal medicine in cultivating nature is of the utmost importance. All infinite endeavors culminate here—how could one slight nature? I urge those who seek the Dao: before cultivating nature, first hasten to cultivate life; after completing the cultivation of life, hasten to complete the cultivation of nature. Employ both yin and yang, cultivate both nature and life. Proceed from effortful action to effortless non-action, until being and non-being dissolve, the void is shattered, and one enters the realm of neither birth nor extinction. Then the work of the cultivator of truth is complete.
