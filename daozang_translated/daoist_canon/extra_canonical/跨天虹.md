(...previous text missing...) she stepped out of the room and turned past the courtyard, only to see Madam Qu and Old Lady Pu standing there in a daze. You-sheng, catching sight of them, was startled and hurried back to his study to sleep.

Madam Qu and Old Lady Pu took Chao-yun back to the chamber and asked, “What did the young master say?” Chao-yun dared not conceal anything and recounted the whole affair from the beginning. Old Lady Pu was so enraged that she beat her chest and stamped her feet, wailing, “Such a trifling matter—yet it has ruined my daughter!” She wept without cease, tears and snot streaming down.

Madam Qu said, “I told you earlier to cry out when the time came. Why did you not make a sound?” Chao-yun replied, “I wanted to, but the young master stuffed his sweet, honeyed tongue into my mouth, so I couldn’t call out at all.”

Just then, Xiao-chuan walked over and asked, “What is this about?” Madam Qu repeated Chao-yun’s words to him. Xiao-chuan said, “If that’s the case, she’s clearly no fool of a woman. Tomorrow, I’ll speak with him.”

Madam Qu said, “This was our fault—what does it have to do with him? But on the sixth, he must perform the wedding rites. If he refuses, we’ll have to discipline him properly to vent our anger.” After grumbling resentfully for a while, they all retired to bed. (The rest is omitted.)

Meanwhile, You-sheng, on account of Chao-yun, stayed for several days in a row. Each evening, he would wait until the second or third watch before retiring to sleep.

He thought to himself, *"If Chao-yun’s parents find out about our affair, they will surely show their displeasure. If they don’t know, why has she stopped coming? There is great cause for suspicion. Tomorrow, I must ask her in private to set my mind at ease."*

The next afternoon, he saw Chao-yun alone by the side gate. Glancing around to ensure no one was near, he approached and asked, *"Chao-yun, why didn’t you bring tea this evening?"*

Chao-yun replied, *"Mother found out. Even my dowry isn’t safe."*

Upon hearing these words, You-sheng needed no further thought to understand her meaning. He smiled and said, *"If fate is so unkind, what cruel destiny is this!"*

That night, he went straight to bed, pondering, *"I must not hesitate. I should leave tomorrow. If I delay further, I’ll be trapped in their scheme. Of all plans, fleeing is the best."*

At the fifth watch, he dressed, slipped out of his room, and hurried through the back gate, escaping without a trace.

Upon returning home, his parents had not yet risen. He went to his room, gathered his bedding and silver, and instructed Qin-si to carry them. Without even bidding his parents farewell, he hired a small boat and set off for Wangzhou. (The rest is omitted.)

Meanwhile, Xiao-chuan rose early in the morning and sent Pu Yi to summon the cooks and arrange for opera performances, making the household bustle with preparations.

After a flurry of activity, Pu Yi’s wife rushed in, flustered, and announced, *"We’ve been robbed last night!"* The back gate was wide open, but nothing in the house was missing. After searching everywhere, they realized only one thing was gone—the son-in-law.

They quickly reported this to Xiao-chuan. Knowing You-sheng had fled home, Xiao-chuan sent Pu Yi to fetch him.

Pu Yi arrived at the Lu residence and said to Tian-cheng, *"My master sends his regards and requests the young master’s presence today to perform the wedding rites."*

Tian-cheng replied, *"Since he came to your house that day, he has not returned."*

Just then, the gatekeeper entered and told Tian-cheng, *"The young master knocked at the door before dawn, had Qin-si carry his luggage, and left—I don’t know where."*

Tian-cheng relayed this to Pu Yi, who took his leave and returned to report to Xiao-chuan.

The household was left utterly disheartened, their anger so fierce it nearly cost them their lives—needless to say more.

Meanwhile, You-sheng had traveled all the way to Hangzhou. Delighted by the sights of West Lake, he lingered for several days, reluctant to leave. Yet fearing his parents might send someone to pursue him, he knew he must flee farther. Crossing the river, he traversed mountains and ridges, enduring hardships on the road. After half a month’s journey, he reached Jiangxi and took lodging at an inn. Thinking himself far enough from home, he decided to settle and find a place to stay, where he could devote himself to his studies.

Just then, another traveler entered the inn, seeking a room. As the hour was late and no vacant chambers remained, he was shown to share You-sheng’s room. The two clasped hands in greeting.

You-sheng asked, “May I inquire your honorable name and hometown?”

The man replied, “This humble one is Yan Zhen, a native of Wu-men.”

You-sheng likewise introduced himself, revealing they were fellow townsmen.

“What brings you here, sir?” You-sheng asked.

Yan Zhen said, “My elder brother, Yan Yue, is currently the prefect of Ji’an. His yamen lacks staff, so he sent me home to recruit a private secretary. And what brings you here?”

You-sheng replied, “A friend of mine serves as magistrate in Ji-shui. He invited me to join his staff, but en route, I received word that he had returned home for mourning. Thus, I’ve been delayed here.”

Yan Zhen asked, “Would you consider joining my brother’s yamen?”

You-sheng demurred, “I fear my meager talents would be unworthy of your brother’s guidance.”

Yan Zhen, however, found his speech refined and his demeanor uncommon—clearly a learned man. Hoping to spare himself the trouble of returning home, he invited You-sheng to accompany him. He called for the innkeeper to prepare wine and a dish, and the two drank together. Their conversation flowed so smoothly that they soon became fast friends.

The next day, Yan Zhen settled You-sheng’s bill, and the two hired sedan chairs and horses to set off for Ji’an.

After You-sheng’s departure, Chao-yun pined for him day and night, falling ill for a year. Her once rosy complexion and jadelike beauty withered into a skeletal semblance. Medicines and prayers brought no relief. As death approached, she told her mother, “I fear I won’t recover. There’s a handkerchief with a poem in my trunk—please be sure to bury it with me.”

Pu Yi and his wife hurriedly searched the trunk and found the handkerchief, which they handed to their daughter. Chao-yun gazed at it, her sorrow redoubling. In an instant, her eyes closed forever—her fate no different from Qiao-qiao’s.

It so happened that their spirits, unwilling to let You-sheng go, lingered on. In the underworld, they met by chance, and both proved to be his creditors of karmic debt. Kneeling before King Yama, they tearfully recounted You-sheng’s faithlessness and inconstancy, longing to return to the living and reunite with him.

The King consulted the Register of Marriages and saw that Lu Shi-shan’s predestined bonds with Qiao-qiao and Chao-yun Feng had already been fulfilled—no reunion was possible. Furthermore, he discovered that Lu Shi-shan was originally fated for early success in the imperial examinations, but for abandoning his wife without cause, the Heavenly Court had revoked his prospects. Hearing this, the two women collapsed in grief.

King Yama said, “Though your allotted lifespans are not yet exhausted, you have already departed your bodies and cannot return to life. I shall permit you to wander as unrestrained spirits in the mortal realm until your natural lifespans end, at which time you will be summoned for judgment.”

Thus, their forms dissolved into the wind, and they left the underworld, making their way to Ji’an Prefecture.

*Enemies bound in past lives,
In this life, enemies still they become.*

This aside, let us return to Pu Xiao-chuan. Having raised this daughter, he had endured endless frustration. His son-in-law had fled without a trace, and keeping his daughter at home offered no resolution. Yet if he arranged another marriage and the son-in-law returned, complications would arise. As he and Qu-shi wrestled with their dilemma, word came that Chao-yun had died.

Xiao-chuan said, “We should hold a funeral for Chao-yun as if she were our daughter, keeping it secret from the Lu family.”

Qu-shi asked, “And what of Da-qiao?”

Xiao-chuan replied, “I have a relative named Kong Fang who borrowed three thousand strings of cash from me to open an inn in Ji’an Prefecture. We can send Da-qiao to live with him. Once the situation cools, we can arrange another match—wouldn’t that be tidy?”

Qu-shi sighed, “But she’s been by my side since childhood. How can I bear to part with her?”

Xiao-chuan said, “Circumstances leave us no choice.” He informed Pu Yi and his wife, who saw no better option. They then reported to the Lu family that their eldest daughter had died, and the funeral rites were carried out. Lu Tian-cheng and his wife came to mourn, believing it to be true.

Poor Chao-yun—whether alive or dead, she was made to take the blame. After the forty-nine days of mourning had passed, Xiao-chuan dispatched his steward, Pu Zhong, and his wife to prepare travel funds and luggage. They accompanied Da-qiao to Kong’s household.

Pu Zhong first entered to deliver the letter. Upon reading it, Kong Fang invited his niece inside, where they exchanged formal greetings. He then prepared a chamber for her to reside in. Kong Fang immediately instructed a matchmaker to seek a marriage prospect for her. Yet this "unsellable stock" found no takers anywhere—after more than forty or fifty proposals, not a single one succeeded. Several more years passed with no suitor in sight, and the matchmaker’s enthusiasm waned, just as Da-qiao’s own desire to marry gradually faded. Truly:

*When fate denies a heavenly match,*
*The red phoenix star shines on another’s house.*

Meanwhile, Lu You-sheng had served as a private secretary in Prefect Yan Yue’s yamen for five years, amassing a comfortable sum. He changed his name to Yan Yu and accompanied the prefect to his new post, where he sat for the imperial examination. One day, news arrived that the emperor had summoned Prefect Yan to the capital. Yan wished to bring You-sheng with him, but You-sheng thought, *"I have not returned to take the examinations for many years, and my scholar’s status has long lain fallow. If I go now, won’t I lose both opportunities? Better to wait two more years—if I pass the provincial examination, I can marry a beautiful wife. Then, returning in glory, I will achieve both goals at once. Would that not be ideal?"* He wrote a letter and entrusted it to Prefect Yan to deliver home. Renting a private residence, he settled in to focus on his studies.

It so happened that the seventh day of the seventh month arrived, when households everywhere prayed for skill by threading needles. You-sheng mused, *"Today is Qiao-qiao’s birthday. Were I at home, I would surely raise a toast to celebrate with her. But now, separated by distance, we cannot meet even in haste."* Tears welled in his eyes.

He then composed a poem on the spot:

*"Two hearts apart, each sheds its stream of tears,
Vainly the Herd-boy calls from heaven’s frontier.
The Weaving Maid’s millennial grief won’t fade,
Nor can the fairy’s Qixi sorrow be allayed.
The embroidered bower’s rain-cloud passion burns bright,
The gauze window’s wind-moon longing drifts like night.
Far as Wu Mountain, the Silver River flows—
Heartbroken, autumn’s sorrow Song Yu knows."*

As he finished reciting, the door creaked open. Who might be coming? The next passage will reveal all.

**Chapter Three, Third Tale: The Handsome Scholar’s Ghostly Matchmaker**

Now, You-sheng looked up as the door opened and saw a woman of about thirty. He quickly rose, stepped forward, and bowed, asking, *"Madam, to which household do you belong? What brings you here?"*

The woman replied, *"This old one is surnamed Wei. I’ve come, perhaps presumptuously, to propose a match for you, sir."*

You-sheng said, *"I am deeply grateful for your kindness. However, I have resolved to marry only a woman of both talent and beauty."*

Wei replied, *"I’ve arranged countless matches and never once misled a family’s child. This young lady is of age and as lovely as a flower. If you marry her, how will you repay me?"*

You-sheng said, *"If she is as you say, I will certainly reward you handsomely."*

Wei smiled, rose, and took her leave. You-sheng asked where she lived, and she answered, *"Under the third archway east of the main street."*

After parting, Wei went straight to the Kong household to act as matchmaker for Daqiao. Kong’s wife said, *"I’ve turned down dozens of proposals for my daughter, as none suited me. But if Wei speaks of this one, it must be a fine match."*

Wei said, *"This Master Yan is exceptionally talented—a learned scholar of our time."*

Kong, knowing he was the prefect’s guest and thus a man of influence, immediately agreed.

The next day, You-sheng visited Wei and said, *"Regarding yesterday’s discussion, I must see the young lady in person to set my mind at ease."*

Wei replied, *"That can be arranged."* She then accompanied You-sheng to a grand household, where she asked him to wait while she went inside. After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, two maids emerged, supporting a young woman who glided forward with graceful steps. She approached the hall, bowed to You-sheng, stood briefly, then turned and followed Wei back inside.

You-sheng, his spirits lifted and heart delighted, watched her until she passed through the inner gate before turning his gaze away. Unnoticed, she had dropped a handkerchief, which You-sheng picked up. Fearing someone might see, he hastily tucked it into his sleeve without examining it closely.

Wei emerged, and they set off. Along the way, she asked, *"Does the young lady meet your approval?"*

You-sheng replied joyfully, *"She is truly a woman of the highest refinement. But how much is the betrothal gift?"*

Wei said, *"She doesn’t care about the gift—only that you marry into her family."*

You-sheng said, *"That can be done."* They parted, and he chose an auspicious day to send the betrothal gifts and complete the marriage.

On the wedding day, You-sheng dressed in his finest, and the procession arrived. He boarded the sedan chair and was carried to the Kong household. After the nuptial rites, Wei took her leave.

You-sheng entered the bridal chamber and saw his new wife. Startled, he thought, *"Why does she not resemble the woman I saw before? There must be some mistake."* He pulled her close, scrutinizing her carefully, and suddenly erupted in fury, shouting, *"Where did this monstrosity come from!"*

*"The woman I met the other day was a lovely girl of seventeen or eighteen—you’ve switched her out to deceive me! I’ll take this to court!"*

Hearing the commotion in the bridal chamber, Kong Fang hurried over to inquire. After listening to You-sheng’s account, he said, *"When did anyone come to see my daughter? Where did such a story come from?"*

You-sheng replied, *"That matchmaker, Madam Wei, brought me here. Two maidservants escorted out a woman as beautiful as a flower or jade—how could this be her?"*

Kong scoffed, *"You must have seen a ghost! There was no flower-like beauty for you to meet."*

*"Absurd!"* You-sheng cried. *"On the day we met, the woman even left behind a handkerchief—I kept it here. Look!"* He rushed to his trunk, retrieved the handkerchief, and handed it to Kong. Kong took it and saw fine, fly-head script upon it. When You-sheng took it back to read, he exclaimed in shock, *"How strange! This is the handkerchief I gave to Zhaoyun—why was it with that woman? We only need to ask the matchmaker to get to the truth."* He urged Kong to go with him.

Kong, struck by his strange words, also wished to find the matchmaker and question her. The two men, dazed with frustration, stepped out the gate. When they reached the foot of the third memorial archway, they saw only an expanse of empty ground—where had the house gone? The matchmaker, too, had vanished. They stood dumbfounded, staring at the vacant lot. *"How strange! How strange!"* they muttered. Asking the neighbors, each one said there had never been a matchmaker named Wei; this empty ground had served as an execution ground for autopsies ten years prior, so no one had built a house there. The father and son-in-law gazed at each other in bewilderment, unable to make sense of it, and returned home dejectedly. They told the household what had happened, and all marveled at the strangeness of it.

You-sheng sat in his room, turning the handkerchief over and over, pondering for a long while, but could grasp nothing. He had no choice but to set it aside and put it out of mind. Yet now that he had married this woman, his situation was neither settled nor resolved—he would have to flee again to escape this ordeal. He did not sleep all night, and as soon as the fifth watch arrived, he opened the door and slipped away. Unfortunately, the innkeeper spotted him and reported it to Kong. Kong immediately sent three or four young servants to pursue him. They caught up with him halfway, dragged him back, and brought him before Kong and his wife.

The couple was furious. *"With things as they are,"* they said to You-sheng, *"why did you leave without a word? Are you going to abandon our daughter and leave her to a lifetime of regret? That is no way for a gentleman to act!"* You-sheng hung his head in silence.

Kong knew that Da-qiao’s first husband had already fled, and now seeing this one attempt to leave as well, he feared he would depart and never return—another unresolved matter. Without further argument, he pushed You-sheng into the chamber and locked the door. Every window, pillar, and wall was secured tightly, and meals were passed in through a rotating tray. Such arrangements made it impossible to escape, even with wings. You-sheng sat in the room like a caged ape or a captive crane, with no means of flight. With no other choice, he endured in silence, passing the days in reluctant submission.

Kong thought to himself, *"My son-in-law is no criminal—how can I keep him imprisoned here? Better to let Da-qiao enter his room at dusk and leave at dawn. That way, he won’t have to see her unsightly face, and they may yet share a bed. Perhaps the young man will change his mind."* Yet You-sheng’s resolve was even firmer than that of the steadfast man Liu Xia-hui. No matter how she lay beside him, he remained unmoved, not making the slightest sound. After a few days, even Da-qiao refused to enter. This was the true measure of You-sheng’s devotion to talent and restraint from desire, which made him so unyielding.

Unexpectedly, Kong Fang’s fortunes took a turn for the worse. One night at the third watch, a clamor arose outside the door—robbers, their heads wrapped and faces covered, smashed through the tiles and forced their way in with torches and cudgels. Startled, You-sheng had nowhere to hide. Finding nothing of value after a thorough search, the bandits bound him and scorched his body with burning straw, demanding he reveal where his treasures were hidden. Unable to endure the torment, You-sheng at last said, "The treasure is in the upper floor at the rear." The robbers dragged him along as their guide. Having only just arrived at the Kong residence, You-sheng was unfamiliar with the layout, yet the bandits drove him forward with blows, stick after stick, until they reached the rear tower. There, they ransacked chests and overturned trunks, gorging themselves before departing. Fearing pursuit, they hauled You-sheng two or three *li* away before releasing him. He fled for his life, stumbling and staggering, collapsing in a daze only to scramble up and run again. Then, one of his shoes slipped off. As he groped about in the dark, he failed to find it but instead felt a heavy bundle, likely left behind by the robbers. He tucked it into his sash and hesitated: *"If I return, they will surely lock me in that room again. If I do not, I have no lower garments—what will I do when dawn comes?"* Just as he despaired, the moon began to sink, and the cock crowed at daybreak. Soon, the sky lightened. With no other choice, You-sheng crouched down and sat upon the ground. The locals, seeing this strange sight, gathered around in a circle, demanding his story. Growing weary of their questions, he suddenly spotted a young servant pushing through the crowd. The boy cried out, "Master, put these on!" You-sheng looked up—it was none other than the lute attendant. Hearing that his master had been seized, the boy had guessed he would be released partway, half-dressed. After the robbers left, he had taken a few garments and set out before dawn to search. By chance, he had come upon You-sheng in this very place. Dressed at last, You-sheng conferred with the boy: "Let us not return. We shall find another place to stay." The attendant replied, "But all our belongings are there—how can we abandon them?" You-sheng said, "What are belongings worth? If we go back, they will lock me in that room again. When will I ever see freedom? The imperial examinations are near. Let us go to the provincial capital, find lodging, and study for a time. After the exams, we can decide what to do next." The boy objected, "We have no traveling money—how can you take the exams?" You-sheng told him of the silver he had stumbled upon. Delighted, the attendant followed his master, and along the way, they purchased bedding. By the time they reached the provincial capital, the preliminary exams had already passed, but You-sheng was selected as a *yicai*—a candidate who had missed the main examination—and granted a place. He awaited only the three sessions of the provincial exam. After a few days, the first session arrived. You-sheng prepared himself and entered the examination hall. The sky was still dim, and the examination papers had not yet been distributed. He lowered his head and feigned sleep for a moment. Suddenly, a group of clerks shouted, "The names are being called in the hall—go, go at once!" Without explanation, they seized him and dragged him forward. Above, the names were read one by one. When the eighteenth name, Lu Shishan, was called, You-sheng stepped forward to answer. There, seated in the place of honor, an official declared, "You abandoned your wife without cause. The Celestial Court is displeased and has revoked your future prospects." Before You-sheng could explain, the clerks hustled him out.

You-sheng seized the clerk and demanded, "Why call my name only to reject me?" The clerk replied, "That venerable official oversees which candidates pass or fail." Before You-sheng could press further, the afternoon had already slipped away. He submitted a blank examination paper. By dawn, the list of successful candidates was posted—his name absent once more.

"You-sheng sighed, "This year’s failure stems from that dream’s misfortune. I shall wait another three years; if I still fail next time, I will reconsider." Time passed swiftly, and soon it was autumn examination season again. Heaven’s justice was manifest—once more, he fell beyond the tail of Sun Shan. Turning to Qin Si, he said, "Two failures leave me no face to remain here. I shall cast aside this *xiucai* status, pack my belongings, and return home." That very day, he settled his rent and set out on his journey.

Along the way, he mused, "That dream in the examination hall was indeed strange. This time, upon returning, I shall first reconcile with the Kong family, then bring my wife back with me, and later fetch Lady Pu to return her intact to her family." Just so:

The bitter sea knows no bounds—
Turn your head, and the shore is near.

This very thought of his had already startled the Day-Officer of Merit, who reported it to the Celestial Emperor. Thus, his prospects for official rank held seven or eight parts of promise. But this is a matter for later.

Meanwhile, after the bandits had departed, Kong Fang and his wife crawled out from beneath the bed. Taking stock of their household silver and valuables, they found a full three to five thousand taels missing, and their son-in-law gone as well. In one stroke, they had lost both person and property, and their bitterness knew no bounds. They could not but report the theft to the authorities in hopes of apprehending the culprits. Yet as the saying goes:

Robbed, then hounded by officials—
Sorrow upon sorrow.

They fell into a deep melancholy, which soon turned to illness. Fever and chills racked Kong Fang, and within days, he passed away with a final offering. His wife followed soon after. Da Qiao mourned them more grievously than if they had been her own parents. After observing three years of filial mourning, she performed all rites for their burial.

A once-prosperous household, now bereft of its two central pillars, tottered and collapsed. Though Da Qiao was of age, she had never married, and as a young woman, she could hardly keep the household in order. She could only leave matters to drift. One day, she thought, "I am already of such an age, yet master of none. Twice betrothed, and both husbands turned to empty promises. I no longer hope for any good fortune. I shall pack my things and return to see my parents one last time, then shave off these locks and take up the monastic life." She called upon the Pu couple to discuss the matter. They assented, and Da Qiao made ready. Hiring a carriage, the three set out on their journey homeward. But of this, no more.

Meanwhile, Lu Yousheng made his way toward Ji’an Prefecture. Upon arriving at the Kong residence, he found the courtyard desolate, nothing like its former bustle, and grew deeply perplexed. Hurrying to ask an old man across the way, he said, “How fares the Kong family of late?” The old man replied, “After the bandit raid, the couple both perished, and the house was sold to another.” Yousheng asked, “What of their daughter? Where does she live now?” The old man said, “She moved away three days ago.” Yousheng pressed, “Where did she go?” The old man answered, “No one knows for certain.”

Hearing that the Kong family had been utterly ruined and his wife’s whereabouts were unknown, Yousheng felt a profound sorrow. With Qin Si at his side and nowhere to turn, he could only plan his return journey and press onward. By the time they reached Yushan, the hardships of the road—wind and frost—had taken their toll, and he fell gravely ill. They took lodging at an inn to rest, calling a physician to treat him. Yet his condition worsened day by day, his illness nearly fatal, and his purse empty as a gourd. Qin Si, frantic, approached the innkeeper to negotiate, offering to sell herself to cover the costs of her master’s funeral. The innkeeper said, “If you leave, who will attend to the gentleman?” Qin Si replied, “Let us first draw up the contract. Once my master’s fate is known, I will go without delay.” The innkeeper said, “That will do. Go speak with your master, and I will find a buyer for you.”

Qin Si then told Yousheng of the arrangement. With tears in his eyes, Yousheng said, “Matters have come to this; there is no other way. But I have burdened you with my troubles, and your kindness is too much to bear.” So saying, he wept again.

Qin Si said, “Master, do not grieve too deeply. This is but a temporary measure. If you should recover your silver, you may always redeem me.” As the two spoke, the innkeeper approached the window and called, “Brother Lu, come, I have news for you.” Qin Si stepped outside. The innkeeper said, “I have found a buyer, though they will offer only four taels of silver.” Qin Si replied, “Our need is urgent; we must accept.” The innkeeper went to finalize the agreement, and the sale was set for the following day.

The next day, Qin Si accompanied the innkeeper to the buyer’s home, where the contract was signed and the silver exchanged. Returning to the inn, she arranged for the physician and medicine. Truly:
Medicine cures not the doomed,
Buddhas save only the destined.

After three or five days, Yousheng’s condition began to improve. By the time the full moon arrived, his strength had returned. He said, “My illness has passed. You should go to your new master’s home now.” Qin Si bid him farewell and departed.

Now, Qin Si’s new master was named Chen Yan. His father, Chen Guozhu, served as Educational Commissioner of Shaanxi. As the journey was long, he had not brought his family with him. His mother, née Qian, oversaw her son’s studies. The boy was already fourteen. Upon arriving at the Chen household, Qin Si kowtowed and paid her respects to her mistress and young master, then met the kitchen staff and the master’s brothers. She was smooth and agreeable in her conduct, winning everyone’s favor. Even Master Chen, knowing she had sold herself to save her former master—a loyal servant—treated her with respect and never lorded his authority over her.

One day, a letter arrived from Commissioner Chen. The letter first urged the hiring of a tutor for his son, with great earnestness. Qin Si, having read it, said to the young master, “The master’s letter speaks of hiring a tutor. Why not invite my former master? He would be an excellent choice.” The young master replied, “How can you be certain of his scholarship? You speak too lightly!” Qin Si said, “Though I know little of his learning, I do know that when he was at home, he entered the academy at twelve and became a government student at sixteen. Later, he served as a private secretary in Ji’an Prefecture. Before he could return home for the examinations, he was promoted to government student while in office. From this, I gather he must know how to compose essays.”

The young master smiled and said, “If that is so, I shall write an invitation for you to bring him here to share some wine.” He then penned a note reading “awaiting your instruction this very day” and had Qin Si deliver it.

Qin Si arrived at the inn and, presenting the note to his former master, explained the circumstances. Overjoyed, the scholar tidied his robes and cap, wrote a return card, and went to pay his respects. As soon as he entered the door, Master Chen rushed out to greet him in stockinged feet, showing the utmost courtesy. Once seated as host and guest, they exchanged pleasantries. After tea, they discussed ancient prose and contemporary examination essays, conversing at length with unflagging enthusiasm, every word sharp and incisive. Master Chen listened and said, “Your enlightened discourse has given me much to ponder—my mind, once blocked, now feels suddenly opened.” The scholar replied, “You flatter me.”

That evening, a feast was laid out, and the two raised their cups in toast, drinking until the night grew late before parting. The young master then invited the scholar to stay the night in the study. The next day, he informed his mother of his wish to engage the scholar as a tutor, and she gave her consent. The young master prepared gifts of introduction and, inviting the scholar to take the seat of honor, bowed four times and □□ the contract of employment. From that day on, the tutor took up his post—no more need be said of this.

Meanwhile, Da Qiao had set out on his journey home. Finding overland travel arduous, he hired a passenger boat and sailed down the Yangtze. After several days, a storm whipped the river into towering waves, making further progress impossible, so the boat moored at the foot of Mount Dagu. Unexpectedly, at the second watch of the night, a band of river pirates swarmed aboard, binding master and servants—three in all—and casting them into the water. The pirates made off with all the chests and belongings, stripping the vessel bare before scattering. Truly:

Without the bone-piercing chill of winter’s frost,
How could plum blossoms fill the air with fragrance?

Had Da Qiao not endured this peril, how could he and his wife have later risen to such honor and prosperity?

This concludes the fourth tale of Scroll Three.

**Fifth Tale of Scroll Three**
*The Plain Maiden Thrice Fulfills Her Marriage*

Now, the waters beneath Mount Dagu were part of the Yangtze’s mighty current—where countless souls had vanished without a trace, who could ever account for them? Yet Da Qiao’s fate was not yet sealed. She drifted until she neared a moored vessel, where the boatman spied her and cried, “A woman is floating downstream! Quick, save her!” The crew rushed to action—some with poles, others into the water—and hauled her aboard. Though she clung to but a few breaths of life, the official in the cabin ordered the boatwoman to cut her bonds, change her clothes, and let her rest awhile before summoning Da Qiao inside to recount her story.

Da Qiao told of her parents’ origins, her betrothals to Zhang and Li, and how she had been waylaid by pirates. The official sighed repeatedly, “Pitiful, pitiful!” Then, eyeing her closely, he saw a face so plain that none would find her pleasing. “Now grown to such an age, still a maiden of a good family, cast adrift here—if I do not lift her up, she will surely become a ghost of the gutters.” Turning to Da Qiao, he said, “Marriage comes sooner or later as fate decrees. You must not be hasty. I shall take you as my daughter for now. Stay by my side until I find a husband of talent and looks to match you, then send you home.”

Da Qiao rejoiced, “My lord, you have given me life and will secure my future. Even if I repaid you with jade rings and bound grass in the afterlife, it would not suffice for a fraction of your kindness.” She drew a chair forward, “Father, please be seated while your child kowtows in gratitude for your rebirth of me.” The official sat without hesitation, watching her bow before rising to take his proper seat.

The next day, he hired two maids to attend Lady Da Qiao. Who was this official? None other than Chen Guozhu, father of Chen Yan—the same Chen Yan who had engaged Lu Yousheng as his tutor—now serving as Education Commissioner of Shaanxi, en route to assume his post. Da Qiao’s fortune had led her to this lifesaving benefactor, who would later bestow upon her wealth and honor. Alas, poor Master Pu and his wife had already been swallowed by the river’s fish, a pitiable fate indeed.

Upon taking office, Commissioner Chen governed with pristine integrity. Yet his unyielding nature and refusal to curry favor with superiors led to his impeachment by the provincial inspector after three years. Demoted to Prefect of Fuzhou, he set out for Fujian with Da Qiao in tow. Once settled, he sent for his family.

Meanwhile, Chen Yan—though dull-witted—had flourished under his tutor’s guidance. Their days passed in poetry and prose, their bond as close as flesh and blood, until three autumns had slipped by. One day, news arrived of his father’s demotion to Fuzhou Prefect. Though dismayed, Chen Yan took solace in the proximity of the post, where he could bring his aged parents and young siblings to share in his prosperity. Soon after, the messengers arrived, and he prepared to depart. Lu Yousheng sought to resign and return home, but Chen Yan pleaded so earnestly that he relented and accompanied them.

Upon reaching Fuzhou’s borders, porters, sedan chairs, and horses awaited. They entered the yamen, where the young lady paid her respects to her mother. Commissioner Chen recounted Da Qiao’s story to his wife, who exclaimed, “A daughter of such years, and you left her unmarried in Shaanxi for three years?” Chen replied, “She was born and raised in Wu. She must wed a man of her homeland so her parents may one day reunite.” His wife agreed, “That makes sense.”

That evening, a feast was laid, and Commissioner Chen invited his son’s tutor for conversation. Father, son, and teacher drank together. After several rounds, Chen remarked, “My son was once so unruly, but thanks to your guidance, his speech and manners have improved.” Lu Yousheng demurred, “Not at all. Your son is remarkably quick-witted, grasping ten things from one. I, long out of practice, fear I am unworthy to be his teacher. I hope you will not hold me accountable.” They exchanged tales of their journeys, discussed history and literature, and did not part until the night had deepened. The next day, the young master and his tutor resumed their studies in the rear garden.

This occurred in early March, when the peonies were in full bloom. Miss Da Qiao, accompanied by three or four maidservants, entered the rear garden to admire the flowers. As she turned past the study, she unexpectedly came face-to-face with Lu Yousheng. He quickly retreated into the study. The maidservants followed their mistress as she wandered among the blossoms, enjoying herself to the fullest before returning.

Unbeknownst to her, Lu Yousheng had torn a hole in the paper window and secretly observed her, thinking: *"Though this young lady is adorned with pearls and jade, she has not a trace of beauty. No wonder, at her age, she remains unwed—what a pity her youth is thus wasted."* His gaze followed her until she passed through the garden gate, and only then did he turn away. With a sigh, he murmured, *"Miss, your suffering is no different from mine. I, Lu Yousheng, possess both talent and looks, yet today I too am alone. If one were to judge fairly, your solitude in the women’s quarters would not be amiss."*

Indeed:
*Though beauty and plainness differ in form,*
*Two lonely lamps burn in separate chambers.*

This fleeting thought, born of a moment’s whim, should have been dismissed at once—yet unbeknownst to him, his heart became ensnared, and day and night, the young lady lingered in his thoughts, stirring endless melancholy. Reflecting on his past, he reproached himself: *"In my youth, I lacked all resolve. My parents arranged my marriage to the Pu woman—though plain in appearance, she was my bride under the nuptial candles. Why did I flee? Later, I took the Kong woman as wife, and that might have sufficed. Why, within a year, did I refuse to share her bed? It was those bandits who abducted me from home—I hardened my heart and never returned. Had they not taken me, perhaps I might have relented. Now, nearing forty, I remain alone. Had I known this desolation awaited me, I would have bitterly regretted my stubbornness long ago. Truly:
*One misstep undoes the whole,*
*Leaving the board in ruin.*

My parents, now past sixty, cannot have me by their side. The fates of those two women—whether wed or widowed—I know not. Chaoyun and Qiaoqiao, unseen for twenty years, must have aged by now."*

As these memories surged through his mind, tears flowed like a spring, and he could not stifle his sobs. After weeping for some time, exhaustion overtook him, and he rested his head upon his arm. Suddenly, two women entered the room, saying, *"We have come at your honor’s remembrance to attend upon you."* Lu Yousheng looked up—it was Qiaoqiao and Chaoyun. Overcome with shame, he tried to retreat, but it was too late.

Qiaoqiao reproached him: *"Sir, how could you be so heartless? Had you heeded my words, you would not be in this state today."*
Yousheng replied: *"I was foolish—twice deceived by others."*
Qiaoqiao said: *"Now, your destined bride is a lady of noble birth. If you repeat your past mistakes, you will never know marital bliss."*
Yousheng answered: *"I understand, I understand."*

Then Chaoyun seized him, saying: *"Master, why did you... [text missing] ...on that matchmaking visit? [text missing] ...from the book chest and handed it to Chaoyun [text missing]."* Qiaoqiao then recounted the tale of their matchmaking efforts to Yousheng. He exclaimed: *"From your words, it seems you two have become ghosts of the Yellow Springs!"* Realizing they were indeed spirits, they fell silent, then vanished like the wind. Yousheng rushed to search for them, but no trace remained. Convinced they were ghosts, he cried out in alarm—only to awaken from the dream.

He searched for the handkerchief, but it too had vanished. Reflecting on past events, he realized it had all been the work of ghosts. Though he had long treasured the handkerchief, harboring a secret dread, he now understood its origin and sighed deeply. But no more of this.

In truth, Qiaoqiao and Chaoyun had died with grievances unaddressed and wrongs unrighted, so their spirits sought to bind him to the plain woman as his wife. Though fate had decreed this union, it was their intervention that had brought it to pass. Their first attempt at matchmaking had failed, and fearing he might yet escape, they had resorted to this dream. But when Yousheng exposed them, they dissolved into the wind and departed. Thereafter, their allotted time in the mortal realm ended, and they appeared before King Yama. Finding no grave transgressions in their past lives, and recognizing their twenty years as wandering souls had greatly benefited the Pu woman, the king decreed they would be reborn from her womb as heirs to the Lu family, destined for extraordinary prosperity and honor. But this is another matter.

As for Lu Yousheng, upon waking from the dream, he surmised the noble lady must be Master Chen’s daughter. Overjoyed, he thought: *"To wed her would make my twenty years of wandering worthwhile."* From then on, he fixated on the young lady, neglecting his studies and losing his appetite, falling into a languishing lovesickness. He sighed: *"The young lady endures solitude in her secluded chamber, while I, Lu Yousheng, bear the loneliness of a wandering scholar. Heaven! Why not bind our feet with the red thread and let us grow old together? Then we would both have a place in this world. Yet there is a difficulty: Master Chen is a stubborn man—how could he consent to marry his daughter to a drifting stranger like me? Even if he agreed, the lady might not willingly wed a mere tutor. And even if both consented, I have no means to approach them, nor can I ask another to propose on my behalf. To speak for myself would be improper, and if the old man refused, I would only invite humiliation, making things awkward between teacher and student. In truth, she is a lady of high birth, and I am a learned scholar. If I do not scorn her plainness, and she does not scorn my poverty, then marrying me would not be beneath her."*

After endless deliberation, he concluded the matter was impossible—he could only *"quench his thirst by gazing at plums."* Meanwhile, the imperial examination was announced, and Master Chen’s son, wishing his tutor to assume the Chen surname and accompany him to the provincial exam, had Yousheng change his name to Chen Chong. Both entered the examination hall and performed admirably: the tutor ranked first in the preliminary round, while the young master placed third. Both were approved to proceed to the next stage.

When the autumn examination arrived and the three sessions concluded, the master ranked beyond the eightieth place, while Master Chen’s son passed as the [missing characters]... dividing host and guest. First, as a nephew by age; second, as one who had passed the exams alongside his adoptive son; and third, as Master Chen had long harbored the intention to betroth his eldest daughter, Daqiao, to the master—on that day, Daqiao did not appear to greet him. Master Chen and his wife took the seats of honor, the master facing west, the young master facing east, and all drank merrily until thoroughly intoxicated. The following day, they inevitably had to meet with fellow graduates and the chief examiner, remaining occupied for a full month before finding leisure.

One day, Master Chen said to his wife, “I have long wished to betroth Daqiao to the master. Now that he has passed the exams, we must not miss this fine opportunity.” His wife replied, “But our daughter is plain and past her prime. What if the master finds her unsatisfactory?” Master Chen said, “We shall marry them first and deal with matters afterward.” That very day, he visited an acquaintance, one Ke Bing, and asked him to act as matchmaker. Ke Bing agreed and promptly called on Yousheng to propose the marriage of Master Chen’s daughter. How could Yousheng, who had long yearned in vain, refuse when Master Chen now condescended to the match? He readily assented. An auspicious day was chosen, and the betrothal was sealed with a silk thread. The wedding took place at the Chen residence.

On the night of the wedding, after the nuptial rites were completed and they retired to the bridal chamber, Yousheng embraced Daqiao’s fragrant shoulders and, holding a silver mirror, examined her face. He sighed and said, “My fate, my fate!” Daqiao replied, “My sweetheart, my sweetheart!” Yousheng chuckled and stepped away. Daqiao, angered, said, “I only called you that out of affection, not wishing to refuse your sentiment. Why do you mock me?” Yousheng replied, “I was not laughing at you, nor was I addressing you. I was only lamenting my own fate.” Daqiao grew even more furious: “You wandered destitute, and it was my brother who gave you shelter. Now, thanks to my father’s official post, you passed the exams. I am a lady of high birth, adorned with jade and pearls—am I not worthy of you, a mere provincial graduate? And yet you dare complain of fate?” With that, she burst into loud sobs.

Yousheng repeatedly pleaded and cajoled, but her sobs only grew louder. As she wept, she cried out, “You clearly find me ugly and mean to flee! If you leave, I’ll have my father submit a memorial against you, strip you of your rank, and take your life!” With that, she wept anew. Flustered, Yousheng feared that Master Chen and his wife might overhear, which would be mortifying. He quickly dropped to his knees and said, “My lady, forgive this first offense—I will never again dare to offend your noble countenance.” He then used his sleeve to cover her gaping mouth, a full foot wide.

Seeing his earnest efforts, Daqiao finally fell silent and asked, “What exactly is this lament of yours about fate? Tell me everything. If you utter a single falsehood, you’ll kneel until dawn.” Yousheng replied, “At eighteen, I resolved to marry a peerless beauty. Unluckily, my father betrothed me to Pu Xiaochuan’s daughter, who was hideously ugly. After the wedding ceremony, I fled. Later, I married Kong Fang’s daughter—equally repulsive—and again left without a word. Now, having wed you, my lady, whose beauty is refined and wholly to my liking, this sigh was only because fate decreed I should marry a lady of noble birth. How could I wed such extraordinarily ugly women? Is that not my fate?”

Hearing this, Daqiao could not suppress a smile. She helped him to his feet and said, “Your fate is my fate.”

“When I first married a man named Lu Shishan, I fled after the wedding ceremony. Later, I married Yan Yu, and again I fled. Now that I’ve wed you, sir, I feared you too would run away—so I only answered you with such hesitation.”

Yousheng replied, “From what you say, that Lu Shishan was me, that Yan Yu was me, and this Chen Chong who has married you today is also me. Could it be, my lady, that you are none other than the daughter of the Pu family and the young lady of the Kong household?”

Daqiao said, “I need not hide it from you: that daughter of Pu Xiaochuan was I, that Kong Fang’s beloved A’ai was I, and this young lady who has married you today is also I.”

Yousheng said, “I thought there could not be two such women in the world—it was always you. Truly, the bonds of predestined affinity are not to be defied.” The two laughed and jested for a while, then undressed and retired to bed.

Their words had only just crossed, and now they must make amends beneath the covers. One was a maiden past her prime yet still blossoming, the other a long-deprived virgin no longer young—what need for modesty, what cause for refusal? Hand in hand, they embraced the clouds and grasped the rain, ascending at once to the heights of Gaotang. By this time, Yousheng cared not for the plainness above, savoring only the delicacies below. Yet his heart still harbored a lingering regret—not that anything was amiss, but that the two of them had squandered twenty years of romance, crawling and scrambling in vain, only to end as husband and wife after all.

That night’s joy need not be told. The next day, when they spoke with Master Chen, all marveled without end.

Meanwhile, before any others could reach the capital, only Prefect Yan managed to send a letter, revealing their whereabouts. Thereafter, all word from them vanished. Fortunately, Yousheng later fathered a daughter, nicknamed Daier—meaning "a daughter in place of a son"—who had now reached sixteen. By Heaven’s grace, the couple at last had someone to fill their home, sparing them the loneliness of old age.

One day, as they sat idly in the hall, a man suddenly approached with joy written across his face. Dropping to his knees, he cried, “Father, your son has narrowly escaped death—today I return!” Tiancheng, his aged eyes blurred, peered closely before seizing him in an embrace. “My child,” he wept, “you abandoned me for twenty years—how I have longed for you!” Grief and joy surged together, and tears streamed unchecked. Inside, Xiaoshi heard the old man’s sobs and, unaware of the cause, hurried out with their daughter. Seeing them, Yousheng knelt and bowed deeply. The three embraced, weeping bitterly—only Daier, confused, slipped away.

Tiancheng turned to her: “This is your elder brother, gone for twenty years and only now returned. Come, greet him.” Daier curtsied twice before them, and the four sat down. After such long separation, words could hardly suffice. Yousheng recounted his success in the imperial examinations and his marriage to the daughter of Pu Xiaochuan. His parents rejoiced, sending servants to fetch his luggage from the boat and escort his bride ashore. Qin Si, who had been given in adoption to Master Chen, returned as well, accompanied by a maidservant for the journey.

Tiancheng then dispatched a messenger to inform the Pu family. Before long, Pu Xiaochuan and his wife arrived. With the bride now present, incense and candles were lit throughout the hall. Yousheng and his wife bowed anew before the ancestral shrine, then paid respects to both sets of parents. A grand reunion feast was laid out, and joy overflowed. Between cups of wine, they took turns recounting the past twenty years—laughter erupting at moments of happiness, tears flowing at tales of hardship.

At this moment, only Pu Xiaochuan and his wife flushed with deep embarrassment—having once claimed their daughter was dead, how could she now be here? Though the Lu family made no mention of it, they felt profound shame in their hearts. That evening, the feast ended in full merriment.

The next day, Yousheng inquired after Qiaoqiao and Chaoyun, only to be told they had died seventeen or eighteen years prior. Overcome with grief, he mourned their loss, reflecting on the love they had shared—now vanished without a trace. Little did he know that Qiaoqiao and Chaoyun had gone to the Pu household to continue the ancestral line! All this was predestined karma, a debt from past lives, where separation and reunion unfolded as if guided by unseen hands.

A year later, Master Chen’s term of office ended, and he traveled to the capital with his son for the imperial examinations. Passing through Suzhou, they paid a visit to Lu Tiancheng. Yousheng promptly prepared a banquet. As they drank, the conversation turned to Master Chen’s son’s marriage. Yousheng offered his sister in place of his own son as a match, and Master Chen agreed, saying to Tiancheng, “The journey was rushed, and I have not prepared betrothal gifts—what is to be done?” Tiancheng replied, “My son has long received your familial kindness; what need is there for formalities?”

The next day, Master Chen sent a messenger bearing a golden *ruyi* scepter and a silver tripod as tokens of betrothal. After lingering for several days, they set off together for the capital to take the examinations. When the spring imperial exams concluded, both passed as *jinshi* of the third rank and were appointed magistrates, awaiting their official seals. Master Chen was reassigned as a maritime commissioner, and upon their return, Yousheng arranged his sister’s marriage. All assumed their posts in honor.

Later, Yousheng’s two sons both passed the highest examinations, and he and his wife lived to the age of ninety. Their descendants flourished for ten thousand generations, proving that the affairs of the world—what man does not strive for yet comes to pass, what he does not seek yet attains—are all the work of Heaven and fate, not within mortal power. Reflect upon this and take heed. *End of the First Tale in Scroll Four.*

The Moon Palace’s Chang’e Suffers Calamity

*Poem:*
Beneath the bright moon, wind still in wild clouds’ span,
Wine in hand, I sing, delighting in nature’s plan.
Worldly affairs are but a game of chess,
Hold fast to the true Dao, and face the heavens’ span.

When the Dao of Heaven is not upright, wind and rain miss their season, and human life meets with disaster and hardship. When the Dao of the Ruler is not upright, governance falls into disrepair, and the people grow cunning and deceitful. When the Dao of Man is not upright, the inner chambers are not kept in order, and the household teems with perversity and falsehood.

In the time of Emperor Yao, there were twenty years of great floods; in the Zhou dynasty, frost fell in the sixth month; in the Han, a white rainbow pierced the sun; and in the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, locusts swarmed across the land—these were all signs of the Dao of Heaven being askew.

As for the Dao of the Ruler being askew, consider the First Emperor of Qin, who destroyed the six states and unified the realm. Had he been diligent and vigilant, cultivating virtue and practicing benevolence, his dynasty might have endured for ten thousand generations. Instead, he heeded the words of alchemists and journeyed beyond the seas in search of immortals.

At that time, a Daoist in a yellow cap, seeing the First Emperor on his eastern progress, prostrated himself by the roadside. Boasting of his immortal arts, he performed wondrous transformations, each more marvelous than the last. The First Emperor, half-believing, half-doubting, said, “As I am on my eastern tour, I have no leisure to receive your teachings. When I return to the capital, I shall send for you to speak with me at length.” The Daoist took his leave, then mounted a wisp of white cloud and drifted away.

Seeing such strangeness, the First Emperor regretted missing the immortal before him and cursed his futile journey beyond the seas. He hastily sealed Mount Tai and returned to the capital. There, the Daoist was already prostrate outside the palace gates. The eunuchs announced his presence, and the emperor summoned him into the palace. Seated in conversation on profound matters, the First Emperor held him in great esteem.

When asked of his whereabouts, the Daoist replied, “This poor Daoist roams from Cangwu to the Northern Sea in an instant—how could I have a fixed abode? The threshold of the Jade Purity Palace in Heaven was once inlaid with sandalwood, catalpa, and nanmu, adorned with the Eight Treasures. But over the years, it has rotted away. I wished to recast it in solid silver to endure forever and enhance its splendor. I wonder if Your Majesty would deign to approve this humble sincerity and generously fulfill this great vow?”

The First Emperor said, “How much could a threshold cost? But I must know its length, width, and height to calculate the amount.” The Daoist replied, “I have already measured it: eleven feet long, two feet wide, and one foot high. It will require thirty-six thousand taels of silver.”

The First Emperor immediately ordered eunuchs to deliver the sum from the inner treasury. He summoned many silversmiths and set a deadline of five days to complete the work. They carved dragons, phoenixes, flowers, birds, water ripples, and cloud patterns into it, crafting it with utmost skill.

The First Emperor asked the Daoist, “How will such a heavy threshold ascend to Heaven?” The Daoist replied, “Do not trouble Your Majesty with such concerns. This poor Daoist will return in five days to collect it.”

Sure enough, on the fifth day, a white crane flew into the palace, took the threshold in its beak as lightly as a reed, and soared into the sky. The First Emperor gazed after it for a long time, watching it vanish into the clouds. All in the palace were astonished, declaring that the Son of Heaven’s great fortune had brought about this wondrous encounter. The First Emperor, too, believed it was his own virtue and power that had wrought this marvel, and all praised him without end.

Who could have known that five years later, the Daoist would disguise himself in commoner’s garb and take a piece of silver to a silversmith’s shop to be melted down? The silversmith recognized the dragon and phoenix carvings as resembling those made in the imperial palace. He exchanged the silver but secretly followed the Daoist and reported him to the county authorities. The magistrate dispatched many constables to arrest him.

When the Daoist saw the crowd approaching, he realized their intent. With a twist of his body, he sank into the earth. The constables searched all around but found no trace of him. Only when they dug beneath a large tree did they see a foot of clothing protruding from the ground. The magistrate, knowing him to be a demonic Daoist, ordered pig and dog blood to be poured from above. As they dug, the Daoist stood stiff in the earth, the silver threshold at his feet.

They seized him, bound him with ropes, and pried open the threshold. A hundred men strained to drag it out, and together they escorted him to the First Emperor. By imperial decree, the Daoist was sentenced to death by slow slicing, and the silver threshold was carried back into the palace and returned to the inner treasury. This was a case of the people’s cunning and deceit.

Now, let us speak of a tale where the Dao of Man is not upright. During the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty, in the region of Suian County, Yan Prefecture, Zhejiang, there lived a *jinshi* named Guo Lin, styled Xiangong. He had served as prefect of Yanzhou in Shandong but was then observing the mourning period for his parents at home. His wife, née Yuan, was fifty years old and had borne him one son and two daughters. Their son, Guo Zongxian, was nineteen and had already passed the county examinations. Their eldest daughter was sixteen, with the childhood name Zhenzhu, and their younger daughter was twelve, called Zhangzhu.

Miss Zhenzhu was born with a refined and elegant temperament, her joy and anger never showing on her face. She favored plain tea and simple meals, and preferred to wear unadorned white garments. If even a hint of bright color touched her person, she would be restless until she removed it. With such a disposition, one might well imagine her bearing to be naturally extraordinary.

Her mother, seeing her in such attire, would often jestingly call her "Chang'e." One day, during the Mid-Autumn Festival when osmanthus blooms were in full splendor, Master Guo and his wife were in the hall admiring the moon and flowers—moonlight shimmering in their cups, fragrance wafting over their mats. After several rounds of wine, Master Guo sighed, "Today the jade heavens are spotless, the crystal vase radiant and clear. Only the Moon Palace lacks Chang'e to open its gates and dance in rainbow-hued robes."

Hearing the word *Chang'e*, his wife assumed he was calling for their eldest daughter and promptly instructed a maid, "Summon the eldest young lady." The maid entered the embroidered chamber and escorted Miss Zhenzhu to the steps below. Lady Yuan smiled, "Chang'e has arrived." Master Guo fixed his gaze upon his daughter—her plain white garments set off her flower-like countenance, her graceful bearing akin to a jade maiden. Turning to his wife, he remarked, "Though our daughter resembles Chang'e, alas, we have no Guanghan Palace to house her."

Miss Zhenzhu then stepped delicately into the hall. After exchanging courtesies, she sat beside them. The three shared several cups of wine until the moon began its westward descent. The feast was cleared, and they retired to their chambers.

That night, Master Guo mused, "Our daughter possesses such beauty, so like Chang'e—why not build a Moon Palace in the rear garden to keep her there? Then we might seek a zhuangyuan son-in-law to marry her, and our family’s prestige would shine even brighter." Indeed:
*Plucking osmanthus in the moon to welcome immortal guests,*
*The world gazes in awe at the zhuangyuan’s cloud-borne glory.*

Master Guo pondered this all night. The next morning, after washing and dressing, he strolled to the rear garden, surveying the grounds. Finding the space too cramped for his vision, he muttered, "We’ll need ten acres of open land to do this properly. Best to choose a site outside the city." He then took two servants, boarded a small sedan chair, and traveled several *li* beyond the city walls to a secluded spot. There lay a vast, level expanse, surrounded by mountains on all sides—a most refined setting. Master Guo sent men to inquire about the landowner and purchased the plot at a fair price.

Construction began without delay. After spending five or six thousand taels and a full year of labor, the palace stood complete—truly magnificent. It was just before Mid-Autumn when one beheld:
*A pristine edifice spanning the sky, the Silver River gleaming bright.*
*Eaves carved high, needing no painted adornment;*
*The winding terrain, graced by celestial blossoms.*
*Music and pipes resounded, invoking the spirit of the Moon Goddess;*
*Laughter and chatter mingled, half-echoing the zither of the Xiang Consorts.*
*Bright stars glowed like mirrors arrayed;*
*Cool sleeves fluttered as morning tresses were dressed.*
*Perfumed waters flowed free of grease;*
*Orchids exhaled their icy, fragrant breath.*
*White clouds drifted from the bridal chamber,*
*Layered snow adorned the pale walls.*
*Osmanthus petals scattered golden grains,*
*Toad-light exhaled jade-like mist.*
*Though likened to jasper towers and jade halls,*
*It was fit only for moon maidens and fairy consorts.*

When the Moon Palace was finished, Master Guo had a plaque mounted above the gate inscribed: *The Hall of Vast Cold and Emptiness*. Miss Zhenzhu, with her simple and elegant adornments, lent the place a sparse charm. He assigned several households of servants and a dozen maidservants to attend her, then sent her to reside in the palace. There, she spent her days climbing hills, gazing upon waters, admiring the moon, and enjoying the flowers.

One evening, as dusk fell with a bright moon and sparse stars, the wind still and clouds at rest, Miss Zhenzhu ascended the Tower of Soaring Skies to admire the moon. By the second watch, a foul wind suddenly arose outside the window, shaking the grass and trees. Soon, crows scattered and cuckoos cried in disarray, while foxes howled and gibbons shrieked—all manner of malevolent spirits converging in chaos. Before Miss Zhenzhu could retreat to her chamber, a white-browed tiger leapt onto the terrace, pounced upon her, and carried her off in its jaws. The maidservants nearby were struck with terror, their souls scattering in fright. They hurriedly alerted the steward, and the household rushed to the scene—only to find their young mistress gone.

In a panic, they lit torches and scoured the mountains, but found no trace. That very night, they hastened back to the city to inform Master Guo and his wife. Overcome with regret, Master Guo reproached his wife, "Our fine daughter—we compared her to Chang'e, yet now she has vanished from the Moon Palace, gone who knows where." His wife, in turn, blamed him: "Such a grown girl should have stayed by our side! Who asked you to build this soul-snatching Moon Palace, sending her to her doom?" The two lamented bitterly, then followed their servants to the palace outside the city, where they wept in sorrow. They sent men to search the mountains for her remains, intending to bury them, but after days of fruitless searching, they had no choice but to abandon the effort. Master Guo and his wife offered a skyward lament before gathering their servants and maids to return home. Truly:
*In the Moon Palace, none to keep her company—*
*Chang'e weeps, carried off by a tiger’s jaws.*

Beyond the mountain lay the Lan□ region, where a woodcutter named Jin lived. He and his wife, both elderly, had no children. One day, while selling firewood in the market, they encountered a boy of about six, dressed in fine, resplendent clothes. His bearing was dignified, yet his eyes darted about in confusion, tears streaming as he wandered lost. Old Jin took him home, treating him as an adopted son, and named him Jin Yu.

Fearing the boy might learn of his parents' origins and one day return home, Old Jin moved his family deep into the mountains, over a hundred *li* from the market town. He also forbade the boy from speaking freely before others, so that none in the mountains knew his true background, and all took him for their own son. Later, when Old Jin and his wife passed away, Jin Yu continued the firewood trade, and by then he was nearly ten years old.

One morning, he rose early to gather firewood. A gloomy wind moaned, and a thick white mist clung to the ground. As he rounded a bend in the mountain path, he heard faint sobbing from a tiger pit—a woman’s voice. Jin Yu stepped forward to look and saw a woman of breathtaking beauty, her hair adorned with pearls and jade, wailing to the heavens. "Save me! Save me!" she cried. Jin Yu thought, *"If I rescue such a woman, she might marry me—or at the very least, those pearls and jewels on her head would be my reward."* Quickly, he removed the wooden cover from the pit and untied the ropes, but the pit was several *zhang* deep, making it difficult to devise a way out. After a moment’s thought, he took the rope from his carrying pole, untied it, and lowered it down. The woman grasped the end and climbed up with ease. Once out, she bowed deeply to Jin Yu four times. Just as he was about to ask her story, the woman leapt into the air with a sudden bound and transformed into an old tiger, roaring away. Jin Yu was so startled he tumbled to the ground in a heap. When he looked again, the tiger had vanished without a trace. Puzzled, he returned to his firewood gathering.

But let us set aside Jin Yu’s musings for now and explain the tiger’s origins. In the mountains of Lan□, at the precipice of □ Mouth Cliff, there lived a Daoist named Xiao Daoyan. He had resided there for years, nourishing himself on pine needles and cypress berries, cultivating his *qi* and refining his primordial essence, his practice nearly perfected. One day, a demonic impulse seized him, craving the taste of human brains. Sitting in meditation on the cliff, he thought, *"I must transform into a tiger to obtain such fare."* By chance, he came upon a temple where a tiger pelt lay hidden beneath the Buddha’s altar. He took it and donned it, then recalled the *Three Transformations of the Yellow Weasel* incantation from the *Seven Lots from the Bookcase of the Clouds*. With a rustle, he became a ferocious tiger, his heart swelling with savagery. He prowled the mountain valleys, devouring anyone he encountered. The terror spread through the region, and the people lived in dread. The local authorities dispatched hunters to dig pits and set traps across the mountains.

That day, the tiger emerged from the mountains only to fall into a pit. There, he transformed into a woman. Just then, he encountered a woodcutter, who rescued her from the snare. The Daoist, ever mindful of the life-saving kindness like gold and jade, took pity on the woodcutter’s solitary existence and sought to find him a fine match. Coincidentally, Master Guo the Immortal was building a Moon Palace for his daughter to reside in, and the Daoist, moved by this impulse to repay virtue, carried the Pearl Maiden away in his jaws, intending to make her the woodcutter’s wife. Yet, unaware of the woodcutter’s dwelling, he first placed the maiden in his cave. Then, reciting the skin-shedding incantation, he reverted to his Daoist form to seek out the woodcutter’s home—this need not be recounted here.

Meanwhile, the maiden, dragged over five or six mountain ridges by the tiger, was so terrified her limbs turned limp, her chest barely holding a thread of breath. The Daoist boiled water, took a calming elixir, and poured it into her mouth. Gradually, she revived and regained her senses. Realizing she had been carried off by a tiger, she was fortunate not to have been devoured. Slowly rising, she looked around and saw a stone bed, stone stool, stone table, and stone hearth within a stone chamber—all seven necessities of a household were present, as if it were a small home. The maiden thought, *"Why has this tiger brought me here? I should leave this cave and find my way back to my Moon Palace."* But outside the cave, ancient trees stood with cawing crows, a desolate wind howled through the ravine, and no human trace could be found—only wolves and jackals roamed. The maiden hesitated, unable to endure the hardship, and returned to the cave, weeping bitterly. Soon, hunger gnawed at her. Noticing a faint gleam in a basin, she went to the hearth, lit a fire, and cooked rice. Choking back sobs, she ate a bowl and sat there.

Just then, the Daoist returned, carrying meat from a river deer and other game. Entering the cave, he set down his burden and saw the maiden. Only then did she realize this was the abode of a Daoist cultivating the Way. Stepping forward, she bowed and said, *"I am the daughter of Prefect Guo. A tiger carried me here—I beg you, Master, to send me back, and I will reward you with gold and silk."* The Daoist replied, *"That can be arranged. Let this poor Daoist first inquire about your residence, and then I shall escort you home."*

The Daoist said, *"Pray allow the young lady to stay a few more days. Only, this deep mountain offers neither food nor bedding fit for a lady’s use—pray forgive this poor Daoist’s inadequacies."* The maiden replied, *"There is a reason. An unmarried man and woman dwelling alone in these secluded hills may invite suspicion, like the proverbial melon patch or plum tree beneath which one dares not adjust one’s hat."* The Daoist said, *"The young lady is mistaken. This poor Daoist has cultivated in bitter austerity for over thirty years, on the verge of attainment—how could I harbor such impure thoughts and ruin a lifetime’s work? The young lady need not worry."*

The Daoist then turned and left. The maiden thought, *"This Daoist treats me with such courtesy and respect—he likely harbors no designs. I shall observe his behavior tonight to set my mind at ease."* The Daoist went outside the mountain and fetched a reed screen, dividing the stone cave into two courtyards: the maiden within, the Daoist without. When evening came, they took their supper, and the maiden lay down fully clothed. Beyond the screen, the Daoist sat beneath the lamplight, gnawing and crunching with such vigor that the sounds of swallowing and chewing grated on the ear.

The maiden quietly stepped down from her stone bed and peered through a gap in the reed screen. There, the Daoist was gnawing on a human head. Terrified, her heart pounded like a startled deer, her soul nearly fled her body. She knew her own flesh would soon be devoured, yet the situation left no choice—summoning her courage, she watched for some time. She saw... (text missing) ...eating... pounding the skull with his fist...

**Chapter Four, Second Tale: "The Divine Incantation Turns Illusion to Reality"**

Pearl Maiden, seeing the Daoist’s savagery, trembled with fear and lay back down. She thought, *"If this Daoist does not violate me tonight, there may yet be hope of returning home."* Then she reconsidered: *"If he is truly a tiger, I am but prey in his jaws—how could he ever let me go?"* She tossed and turned, sleepless through the night: *"I shall see what tomorrow brings to know my fate."*

At dawn, the Daoist entered to greet the maiden and saw that the wild game offered the day before remained untouched. He took it away. Soon after, he returned with a basket of melons and fruits, placing them in the kitchen before departing again. The maiden, seeing the produce, forced herself to eat a few pieces. That evening, she watched once more, though with less apprehension.

For half a month the maiden pleaded with the Daoist, saying, *"I have been away from home these fifteen days, and my longing for my family is unbearable. I beg you, Master, send me home. The reward I promised shall not be withheld."* The Daoist replied, *"This poor Daoist has already inquired beyond the mountains—Master Guo’s estate lies a month’s journey from here. Lacking travel funds, I have delayed your return."*

The maiden thought, *"I arrived but a single night ago—how could it now be a month? This is clearly the Daoist’s trickery."* She entreated him again and again to send her back. At last, the Daoist recounted the full tale: how he had fallen into a trap, how the woodcutter had saved him, and how he now sought the maiden’s hand in marriage.

The maiden said, *"If that is so, why not send me home to speak with my parents? A proper match through a formal proposal—what could be better?"* The Daoist shook his head: *"Impossible! How could your father ever consent to wed his blossom-like daughter to a woodcutter?"* He urged her to be patient, promising that once he had found the man, all would be well.

The maiden wept bitterly, pleading with tears and snot, but the Daoist remained unmoved. With no other recourse, she returned to her chamber, wondering how he would proceed. Before she knew it, another month had passed.

She thought, *"This Daoist is so strange—why does he don a tiger’s pelt and chant a spell to transform? I’ve grown familiar with the incantation, but he hides the pelt each day, and I’ve never been able to seize it."* One morning, the Daoist rose early and left. The maiden went to the cave’s entrance and searched all around until she spotted the tiger pelt in a stone chamber above. She dragged over a stool, climbed up, and pulled it down, overjoyed.

She donned the pelt, recited the spell, and with a leap, her body surged with strength. Flourishing her might, she let out a roar—mountains trembled, trees shook, and with a flick of her tail and a toss of her head, she bounded out of the cave.

She thought, *"If I return home now, my parents won’t recognize me. Besides, the city offers no place for me. Better to visit the Moon Palace first and decide later."* Crossing several ridges, she saw towering pavilions and lofty terraces and thought, *"This must be my homeland."*

With a single tiger’s bound, she leapt to the gate. There she saw the courtyard desolate, the plants and trees forlorn—nothing like the palace of old. The maiden butted her head against the door, and it swung open at once. □□□ she slunk inside, gazing all around in sorrow, overcome with grief.

After a while, she thought, *"Why not shed this pelt now, return to my human form, and send word to my parents to fetch me home? What could be better?"* She shook herself vigorously, but the fur clung fast. Enraged, she cried, *"If I cannot cast off this tiger’s hide, I’ll remain a beast for life, abandoning my flower-like beauty to drift away like the eastern current—what am I to do?"* She let out a deafening roar, claws slashing, fangs bared, charging wildly about until the Moon Palace was torn askew in an instant. With head hung low and spirits broken, she returned to the mountains. No more of this shall be told.

Meanwhile, word spread among the households at the foot of the mountain that the Moon Palace of Immortal Guo had collapsed, and all came to see the spectacle. The broken rafters and shattered balustrades were casually gathered by the crowd, who carried them away. Unbeknownst to them, Immortal Guo had already learned of the matter and dispatched his servants to retrieve the debris. Seeing the people hauling and tugging at the remnants, the servants seized several and detained them at the home of Village Head Huang to be sent to the authorities. There, they were first subjected to private flogging, their cries of agony filling the air as they pleaded for mercy.

Just then, a Daoist priest passed by the door and, hearing the mournful wails, entered to investigate. Among the captives was the very woodcutter who had once rescued him from a pit—someone he had sought for over a month without success, only to encounter him here by chance. Stepping forward, the priest addressed the steward: *"Esteemed patrons, though I may not know the proper decorum, I humbly beg a word with you."* The crowd replied, *"Master, you are a venerable elder of this place. Speak freely. Tomorrow, we may call upon you to bear witness."* The priest said, *"I care not for the others, but this young man is my nephew, who chops wood for a living to support my old age. Today, in a moment of folly, he has offended you. I offer this modest gift in hopes of your forgiveness."* With that, he presented a five-tael ingot of gleaming silver. The crowd accepted it gladly.

The priest thanked them and turned to lead Jin Yu away, but the others held him back: *"We appreciate your generosity, but we’ll spare him the flogging. Tomorrow, he must still be sent to the magistrate."* The priest pleaded repeatedly, but they refused. Jin Yu pulled the priest aside to a secluded spot and asked, *"Master, what connection do we share that you would spend five taels of silver to save me?"* The priest replied, *"Never mind that now. I’ll explain later. But if they won’t release you today, what can be done?"* Jin Yu said, *"If you can secure my freedom, I will be indebted to you for life and death."* The priest pondered for a moment and then said, *"Very well. Tomorrow morning, when you see a tiger approaching, the crowd will surely scatter in fear—but you must not move. I will handle the rest."* Jin Yu agreed, and the two parted ways. Truly:

One bestows kindness, yet the recipient knows not gratitude;
One bears resentment, and the heart never forgets.
Behold how fortune and misfortune descend—
For kindness and grudges alike have their destined reckoning.

This aside, let us return to Miss Pearl. Upon returning to the mountains, she thought: *"That wretched Daoist’s skin I now wear—who knows how frantic he must be? I’ll go to the cave’s edge and listen to what he says."* She made her way to the entrance and saw the Daoist inside, devouring flesh and gnawing bones. With each bite, he sighed repeatedly: *"How strange! How strange! That young lady has vanished without a trace!"* Miss Pearl stifled her laughter.

After finishing his meal, he went to the stone chamber to retrieve the tiger pelt—only to find it gone. He stomped his feet, beat his chest, and wailed without end: *"This was my lifeline! Now that it’s lost, how shall I not starve?"* Then, muttering to himself, he said: *"Even if I perish, it’s no matter—but what of that woodcutter? I promised to go to Squire Huang’s home tomorrow morning to save him. Without this pelt, how can I keep my word to my benefactor?"* With that, he wept again.

Miss Pearl, having heard all clearly, made her way directly to Squire Huang’s gate to wait.

Just then, the household was gathered inside for breakfast. Miss Pearl leapt into the main hall—before the crowd could scatter, they tumbled into a heap. Only Jin Yu remained still, his heart as clear as a mirror. She seized him in her jaws, bounded twice in tiger-leaps, and sprang to the cave’s edge. The cave door was still shut, the Daoist inside sighing without cease. Miss Pearl set Jin Yu down, then rammed her head against the door several times before withdrawing to the side.

Hearing the commotion, the Daoist threw on his robe and opened the door—only to find a corpse stretched stiff before him. Steadying his gaze, he recognized the woodcutter he had vowed to save the day before. Overjoyed, he hurriedly boiled water, ground a *dingxin* pellet into powder, and mixed it into the brew. Jin Yu gradually revived. The Daoist helped him inside, seated him in the cave, and asked how he had come to be there. Jin Yu recounted all, leaving the Daoist deeply astonished; the account aligned with his own words, though he said nothing of it.

The Daoist then revealed how he had fallen into the trap, transformed into a woman, and been rescued by Jin Yu—how he had intended to give Miss Pearl to him in marriage—and told him everything. Only then did Jin Yu understand the strange events of the past, now made clear at last. After sharing a midday meal, he bid farewell and returned home, but no more of that need be told.

As for the servants and local constables who had witnessed Jin Yu being devoured by the tiger, they gathered their companions and entered the city to report the matter to the authorities. The magistrate, having heard their account, ordered twenty strokes of the rod and dismissed them. But this, too, need not be recounted.

Meanwhile, upon hearing the Daoist’s words, Miss Pearl thought to herself: *"If what the Daoist says is true, then this man is my husband. Just now, when I looked at him closely, his bearing was imposing, his features broad and open—truly the son of a noble house. Though he gathers firewood now, he is certain to rise in the world. If I marry him, so be it. But there is one matter: this pelt I wear is difficult to shed, and my belly aches with hunger, with nothing to eat. Why not go and sit in the woodcutter’s home, display a bit of divine power, fill my stomach for the moment, and secure a future for myself? Then we may become a fine couple—would that not be splendid!"*

She went straight to his door, flung it open, and sat inside. When Jin Yu arrived at the threshold and saw the door wide open, he assumed thieves had broken in. He checked all around but found nothing missing. Turning to the room, he saw *that thing*—his eyes bulged like marbles, his mouth gaped like a winnowing basket, and he bolted outside.

He thought: *"I recognize this old creature—it was the one who rescued me this morning and took me to the Daoist’s home. Has it returned now to demand thanks? Or did it not devour me earlier and has come to claim its reward? This is most perplexing. Let me take another look."*

The young lady, seeing Jin Yu, nodded her head repeatedly. Jin Yu leapt in fright and bolted out again. Just then, a neighbor’s dog happened to pass by. He seized it and tossed it before the tiger, saying, “Brother, here’s a modest offering—may it fill your belly. Now go your way elsewhere.”

The dog, terrified, rolled onto its back, yelping incessantly. The young lady sniffed at its body, then turned her head away. Jin Yu rejoiced, “Good, good! This tiger is a vegetarian—it won’t eat dog meat, let alone human flesh!” Emboldened, he stepped closer, reaching out to scratch her head and gauge her reaction. But he quickly withdrew his hand, thinking, *“Hold on! This is no time for recklessness. As the saying goes, ‘Who dares scratch an itch on a tiger’s head?’ With no plan in sight, I suppose I must leave her be.”*

He went to the kitchen to boil water and prepare a meal. The tiger followed to the stove, smacking her lips and wagging her tongue, as if begging for food. Jin Yu filled a bowl with rice and set it on the ground. The tiger licked it clean in an instant. He served her more, and after she finished, she sat there as before. Jin Yu ate his supper, lit a lamp, and retired to bed. The tiger walked to the bedside, lowered her head, closed her eyes, and settled down to sleep as well.

In his dreams, Jin Yu saw a woman as lovely as a flower or jade approach his bed. He asked her who she was. She replied, “I am the daughter of Prefect Guo. Fate has bound us together, and I have come to share your pillow in secret.” Recalling the Daoist’s words from earlier that day, Jin Yu embraced her warmly, undressed, and lay down with her. The two indulged in utmost delight, entwined like *mandarin ducks*, holding each other close, and drifted into deep slumber.

When he awoke, the woman was gone—only the tiger’s head lay beside his pillow. A cold sweat broke out all over his body, and he hurried to the inner side of the bed to sleep. The next day, he was utterly bewildered. That night, the woman returned in his sleep, exhausting every pleasure of the pillow, and made Jin Yu vow that neither would marry another. At that moment, he would have agreed to anything—even surrendering his life—so he readily consented, swearing a thousand oaths by her side.

When he rose the next morning, Jin Yu thought, *“This is clearly the tiger’s doing, bewitching my heart. I must steel my resolve and keep my distance.”* As soon as the tiger left the house, he hastily gathered his bedding and clothes and fled in haste.

*Truly:*

Falling blossoms long to follow the flowing stream,
Yet the flowing stream, heartless, clings not to the flowers.
Who knows where the tiger went in pursuit—what follows shall naturally unfold in detail.

**Chapter Four, Third Tale**
*The Daoist’s Bloodstains Restore True Nature*

Now, the maiden Pearl, having become Jin Yu’s dream-wedded wife for two nights, was deeply enamored. When the woodcutter failed to return by evening, she set out the next day in search of him. Little did she know that Jin Yu was staying at a friend’s house; as he stepped out the door, they came face to face. Overjoyed, the maiden wagged her head and tail, following him inside. The household, seeing the tiger approach, panicked and raised a clamor. Jin Yu said, “Do not be alarmed—this tiger is my domesticated one, and she eats only the purest vegetarian fare.” The crowd found this strange and gathered to watch. Indeed, she was as gentle as a human. When they offered her meat or fish, she refused, but if tofu or wheat gluten were placed before her, she devoured them as if they were butterflies. Soon, word spread through the village, and people brought vegetarian dishes to see the tiger. Eventually, the tiger grew weary of eating.

After a month or so, the villagers grew accustomed to her presence, and the tiger found little left to eat. Jin Yu thought, *“This place is too sparsely populated to sustain us both. Better to travel elsewhere and seek our fortune.”* They journeyed to Jinhua, where he hid the tiger in a mountain valley. Disguising himself as an immortal, he boasted, *“I can subdue tigers to bring peace to the land. All I require is a donation of a hundred taels of silver to build a thatched hut. If patrons are willing to contribute, I shall ride the tiger here for all to see.”* The crowd replied, *“If you truly ride the tiger here, we will gather the silver for you—and we ask that you teach disciples to guard against future tiger threats.”*

Before long, Jin Yu returned, riding the tiger. At first, the people were terrified, but seeing the tiger so docile, they collected the silver and presented it to him. Jin Yu then rode the tiger back into the mountains. Along the way, he mused, *“This trade is far better than chopping wood. It seems this tiger owed me a debt in a past life—by day, she earns me silver, and by night, she is my wife. Now that this place has grown accustomed to the sight, I shall travel to other provinces to amass more wealth and become a rich man.”* Gathering his belongings, he led the tiger onward, earning money along the way.

After a year of wandering, they reached Chuzhou. With several hundred taels of silver and heavy luggage, he found long travel inconvenient and rented a house there to settle. But of this, no more need be said.

The Daoist, now bereft of his tiger skin, had no choice but to remain in the cave, subsisting on meager fare, his endurance nearly spent. Venturing beyond the mountains, he found nothing to eat, and hunger left him weak and emaciated, his waist limp and his belly hollow. He thought, *“Last year, I wished to save that woodcutter, but without my tiger skin, I could not go to his aid. Then another tiger dragged him away, preserving my reputation for keeping my word—surely that young lady had donned my skin and transformed. Now I must search these mountains until I find her, and beg her to return it to me, lest I starve to death.”*

Staff in hand, he wandered from peak to peak, asking everyone he met about such a strange affair. Those who heard his tale kept it close to heart, and when they saw the Daoist inquiring after the tiger’s whereabouts, they knew at once where it might be found—three mouths agape, each a foot wide. His search led him at last to Chuzhou, where, by chance, he came upon the tiger sitting before a household’s gate with Jin Yu.

The Daoist said, *“Miss Guo, why are you here? You’ve left me in dire straits.”* Seeing him, the tiger trotted to his side and sat, as if in affection. Jin Yu, recognizing the Daoist, stepped forward to bow and thank him for his past rescue. The neighbors, unaware of the full story, gathered to question them, and the Daoist answered as he went along. Jin Yu then invited him to a tavern for wine. The two sat down, and the server brought them cups. They drank several rounds.

The Daoist turned to the tiger and said, *“Miss Guo, I kept you well in my grotto, intending to find this gentleman Jin to arrange your marriage—why did you don this tiger’s pelt and behave so recklessly? A young lady of your standing, transformed into such a beast—what becomes of your dignity?”* The tiger gazed at him with brimming tears, its body trembling violently. The Daoist understood it could not shed the pelt and was thus feigning distress.

Jin Yu addressed the Daoist, *“Master, I do not comprehend a word of what you say. Pray, enlighten me.”* The Daoist recounted the young lady’s history and the matter of the tiger’s skin in full. Jin Yu exclaimed, *“No wonder, when I shared my dwelling with this tiger, a woman of exquisite beauty came to my bed each night. Now, if you would but help her shed this fur, my gratitude would know no bounds.”*

The Daoist replied, *“I could remove it from my own body, but how am I to strip it from hers?”* After pondering a moment, he asked, *“Does the woman still come at night?”* Jin Yu answered, *“Not a night passes without her.”* The Daoist said, *“Then we must proceed thus.”* Jin Yu pressed, *“What is your plan, Master?”* The Daoist replied, *“Let us finish our wine and discuss it at your home.”*

The two drank several more cups before the Daoist rose. Jin Yu settled the bill, and they departed. Once home, the Daoist told Jin Yu, *“I shall teach you the incantation for shedding the pelt. When she arrives tonight, you must instruct her in it.”* That night, Jin Yu taught the young lady the incantation.

The next morning, a rattling sound arose from the tiger’s throat. With a roll upon the ground, the tiger pelt fell away. The young lady rose, straightened her robes and sash, and stood as a woman of beauty surpassing even Chang’e. Overcome with joy, Jin Yu smiled at her and said, *“Now you shall come every night—”*

She blushed but made no reply. The Daoist then urged Jin Yu to act as matchmaker for the couple, and they renewed their vows with fresh wedding rites. The Daoist, having secured the tiger pelt upon himself, recited the divine incantation, leapt through the gate, and vanished into the depths of the mountains.

Little did they know that misfortune was fated for those mountains. With this creature now among them, none—man, woman, young, or old—who crossed its path escaped being devoured. Within half a year, the mountain’s beasts and the village’s people were all consumed. As its hunger grew, it took on human and demonic guises, luring prey into its jaws with ever greater cunning. Truly:

*A tiger in the marketplace is no true tiger,
A man in the mountains is no true man.
The world’s upended fortunes arise
From the collapse of rightful judgment in the home.*

This thread shall be set aside for now.

Meanwhile, Master Guo the Immortal, still grieving the loss of his daughter to the tiger and the strange events in the Moon Palace, felt deep melancholy. Some days later, a letter arrived from the capital. He opened it to find that his former classmate, Zhang Cunshu, had been newly appointed Minister of Personnel. Knowing Guo’s mourning period had ended, Zhang had sent the letter to cordially invite him to the capital to assume a new post. Overjoyed, Guo wrote a reply, dispatched the messenger, and began preparing his luggage for the journey. Within a month, he arrived in the capital and called upon Minister Zhang.

After the formalities, Zhang said, *“My elder brother’s lofty retreat and joy in the clouds mark you as a dragon among men. I, in my humble role as Minister of Personnel, pale in comparison to the likes of Du and Zheng—truly, I am ashamed.”*

Guo the Immortal replied, *“Your Excellency’s rank is as high as the Northern Dipper, your talents as towering as the Central Terrace. In this era of peace and order, you are well-placed to record worthy names in the imperial archives. Your Excellency’s wisdom and magnanimity mirror the heavens, and your promotion of the able without regard to seniority—”*

Hearing these words, Zhang sensed Guo’s willingness to return to office and said, *“Your esteemed name has long rested in my records. That is why I sent for you—”*

Guo feigned modesty before taking his leave. The next day, he returned the visit, and they discussed his appointment. The imperial decree soon arrived, and the Ministry of Personnel confirmed his post as Prefect of Fuzhou. Guo bade farewell to Minister Zhang and departed the capital. His journey home was uneventful, and upon arrival, he made preparations for his new office. Choosing an auspicious day, he set out for his post and arrived within a month.

After offering incense and opening the yamen to receive petitions, we shall set aside the account of Guo the Immortal’s governance—pure as flowing water—and turn instead to his son, Guo Zongxian. After a year in office, Guo had sent his son home to prepare for the imperial examinations. The young master returned to the prefecture after passing the preliminary trials and was en route back when, passing through Chuzhou, he encountered dark clouds gathering and thunder crashing. Unable to proceed, he said to his steward, *“The wind and rain rage together—let us take shelter in this temple.”*

Entering the temple gates, he looked up to see it was dedicated to the Great Exorcist Emperor. Guo bowed four times and sat upon the prayer mat, waiting for the rain to cease. But the storm only worsened, continuing unabated until dusk. He asked his steward, *“How far is the nearest inn?”*

*“Over ten li,”* the steward replied.

*“We shall have to stay here for the night,”* Guo said. He instructed the temple keeper to prepare the evening meal. After eating, they settled in for the night.

By the second watch of the night, Guo saw before the hall a glimmer of golden blades and the glint of iron armor. A majestic deity stood beside him and said, *“Guo Zongxian, heed my words:*
*At the filial widow’s weeping grave,*
*Three thousand arrows must be smeared with dog and boar blood at Xu and Hai.*
*To learn the cause of the luminous pearl’s fate,*
*Watch for the message where water meets the flying fowl.”*

With that, the young master awoke with a start, exclaiming, *“How strange, how strange!”* His steward, now awake as well, said, *“Just now I clearly heard Lord Guan recite a quatrain to you, though its meaning is far from clear.”* The steward replied, *“I too heard something in my sleep, but not a single word remains in my memory.”* Guo then recited the lines one by one. *“Exactly so, exactly so,”* the steward confirmed.

Guo pondered the verses for some time, unaware that dawn had already broken. After eating breakfast and thanking the temple keeper, they set out. Along the way, Guo mused, *“‘Arrows smeared with Xu and Hai’—surely that means coating them in the blood of pigs and dogs. But ‘the filial widow’s weeping grave’—could it mean shooting arrows at a dutiful woman?”* He then thought, *“‘To learn the cause of the luminous pearl’s fate’—‘luminous pearl’ must refer to a jewel. Ah! How strange—my younger sister’s name is Pearl, and she was devoured by a tiger. Could this place hold the key to her fate?”* The last line, however, remained beyond his understanding.

Still lost in thought, he realized they had already arrived at the inn’s gate.

The party dismounted. At midday, a group of hunters rushed past the inn’s gate. Guo asked the innkeeper, *“Who are these people, and why are they in such a hurry?”* The innkeeper replied, *“They’re all hunters. That tiger must have appeared again up ahead—they’ve gone to drive it off.”* Guo asked, *“Why would a tiger venture into a town?”* The innkeeper said, *“Sir, it’s a long story. This tiger is fearsome—it can take the form of man or ghost, and it’s devoured everyone in the mountains. Now it’s starting to prey on those in the town. The other day, our neighbor Wang Xiao’er was gathering firewood at the foot of the mountain when he came upon a child weeping. Thinking the boy had lost his way, he tried to lead him home. But after no more than a few steps, the child spun around, leapt, and transformed into a tiger, dragging Xiao’er off to eat him. The villagers gave chase, but it vanished without a trace. Later, a woman came running in terror, wailing, ‘My son Xiao’er was carried off by a tiger!’ She wept and wailed, searching for his bones and asking after him. Before anyone could answer, the woman herself turned into a tiger and seized two men in its jaws. The crowd scattered in panic. Now every household is on edge, and no one dares let down their guard. Even as you sit here speaking with me, sir—who’s to say you’re not the tiger in disguise? These days, we’re all wary of strangers.”*

Guo listened and thought to himself, *“The verses from the deity in my dream were clearly instructing me to rid this place of this ancient scourge.”* He said nothing of this but told his steward, *“We’ll stay here for a day or two before moving on.”* He then sent the steward into town to purchase bows and arrows, while he asked the innkeeper to procure pig and dog blood to coat the arrows. He fashioned thousands of blowpipes, filling them with the blood, and strapped a waist knife to himself. His servants carried the blowpipes and bows as they entered the mountains.

There, they came upon an old grave overgrown with ancient trees and creeping moss. On the offering stone lay three or five bowls of food, and beside the grave sat a woman of about twenty, dressed in mourning, weeping bitterly to heaven and earth. Guo thought, *“This woman is tending a grave, yet there are no incense sticks or paper money.”* As he drew nearer, he saw that the bowls contained dried venison and gibbon stew. Recalling the innkeeper’s words from the day before, he signaled his servants to make ready.

The woman, seeing Guo approach, rose and bowed to him. He returned her greeting.

The woman said, “I am most unfortunate, having lost my husband early. Before his death, he left me these words: *‘After I am gone, if on the day you sweep my grave you should meet a young man, offer yourself to him in marriage.’* Today, I am fortunate to have met you, a noble gentleman, and your presence matches my late husband’s words. I invite you to my humble home, that we may be joined as husband and wife.”

Guo replied, “This is preposterous! How can we arrange such a matter here in these wild mountains?” The woman stepped closer, her lips moving and tongue flicking, her form beginning to twist into that of a tiger. Guo hastily ordered his servants to loose their arrows. They fired the blood-tipped blowpipes in a flurry, and the woman was struck by seven arrows, her body streaming with foul blood as she leapt wildly into the air. The tiger’s pelt slipped from her, but she could not fully shed her human guise. Guo commanded his steward to bind her with ropes, then took the tiger skin and carried it to the market. The crowd gathered like ants, and the townsfolk pressed their hands to their foreheads in gratitude, thanking Guo for ridding them of this evil beast.

Guo said, “This demon cannot be left for even a moment. Quickly, take her into the city and deliver her to the authorities for punishment.” The men, weary and hungry, said, “Let us first stop at the inn to eat and drink before we go.” Guo entered the inn and took the seat of honor. The waiter set out dishes, and after the meal, the men settled the bill. Just then, a woman inside the inn, hearing the commotion outside, lifted the curtain and poked her head out to look. She and Guo locked eyes, and she quickly withdrew. A servant exclaimed, “Sir, that is the young lady—how has she come to be here?”

Guo said, “She does resemble her, but it may only be a coincidence.” The woman then stepped forward and cried, “Oh, brother! Why are you here?” Guo looked closely and saw that it was indeed—

**Book Four, Case Four: The Woodcutter’s Encounter Leads to Reunion**

Guo, accompanied by his retinue, wrote a formal report and sent a servant to present it to the prefect. The prefect ascended the hall, subjected the woman to severe torture, and extracted a full confession. Without delay, she was taken to the crossroads and beheaded as a public warning. The tiger skin was awarded to Guo as a token of honor. He then dispatched a servant to the inn to settle the bill and gather their belongings, before setting off with Miss Pearl toward his post in Fuzhou. *[The rest is omitted.]*

Meanwhile, Xiao Daoyan sat upon Iron-Beak Crag when suddenly his body was wracked with excruciating pain, as though scalding oil poured upon his crown. With a great cry, he opened his eyes to find himself surrounded by grass grown three feet deep. Xiao Daoyan thought, “A moment’s wayward thought summoned the demonic, and unknowing, I sat with eyes closed, committing two years of transgressions. Reflecting on all that came before and after, I am struck with dread. Could this have been but a dream of my soul—did I truly bring harm to the living?” He descended to villages and towns, questioning every passerby, tracing the path of his visions, and found all to match his dream in every detail. Returning to the mountain, remorse weighed heavily upon his heart: “Having harmed thousands of living beings, how can I attain true fruition? Below this Iron-Beak Crag lies an abyss of ten thousand fathoms—let me cast myself into it, shattering body and bone to atone before Heaven.” With that, he leapt. Yet midair, a wisp of white cloud bore him aloft, and he ascended in broad daylight. Only then did Xiao Daoyan realize that those mauled by the tiger had met their destined end: “Heaven merely borrowed my form to bring their fates to pass—it had naught to do with me.” Free and at ease, he departed.

Later, that tiger skin would bring about the reunion of a golden couple, but that is another tale.

As for Miss Pearl, thanks to the Daoist who had stripped the tiger skin from her, she and Jin Yu were wed. Though Jin Yu had savings, they earned no interest, and day by day their wealth dwindled. Thus, they opened a tavern before their home. One day, Jin Yu went to collect debts outside the city and returned at dusk to find Miss Pearl gone. Questioning the neighbors, he learned that her elder brother had taken her away. Jin Yu thought, “She once told me her father was a prefect and her brother a scholar. If only I knew where they had taken her, where could I even begin to search? We were wed without matchmaker or betrothal gifts—even if I found them, what could they return to me? Perhaps Miss Pearl will not forget my kindness, and we may meet again someday.” He wept day and night, but of this, no more need be said.

Meanwhile, Master Guo Zongxian, having captured the tiger demon, recovered his sister, and obtained the tiger skin—three strokes of unexpected fortune—set off for home with his retinue. Along the way, he pondered the depth of Lord Guan’s verse, its meaning only revealed in hindsight. The final line, *water’s edge, a chicken flies*, hinted at the character for “wine,” and indeed, his sister had been found in a tavern. The prophecy’s precision filled him with joy. Only Miss Pearl grew dismayed, for she had assumed her parents lived nearby and that she would reunite with them briefly before returning home. Yet after ten days of travel, they still had not dismounted. “Had I known the parting would be so distant,” she lamented, “I would have at least bid my husband farewell and secured our trunks.” Lost in hesitation, she scarcely noticed their arrival at the prefectural gate. Guo entered the yamen with his sister, and their parents, overcome with grief and joy, embraced their daughter. Miss Pearl recounted her encounter with the tiger in the Moon Palace, while Guo described the scheme by which he had captured the beast. Their parents marveled at the tale.

Now, there was a censor of the Ministry of Justice named Zhu Jinchen, whose wife, née Tao, had passed her fiftieth year. They had two sons and a daughter: the elder son, Zhu Yu; the younger, Zhu Jue. When Zhu Jinchen had first been appointed, he was assigned to serve as a judicial commissioner in Qingzhou. En route with his family, they were scattered by bandits, and Zhu Yu’s whereabouts became unknown. At the time, Zhu Jue was of marriageable age, and Magistrate Guo had betrothed Miss Pearl to him. The six rites were complete, the three matchmakers had done their work, and only the wedding date remained to be set. Then, a man and his wife approached, saying, “If... then how could I...?” Miss Pearl had pleaded with her parents repeatedly... and at last devised a plan to extricate herself from the predicament.

---

One evening, Miss Pearl feigned a sharp pain in her heart, crying out incessantly. Her mother, alarmed, asked what ailed her. She replied, “This is the old affliction from my time as a tiger—it will only cease if I cover myself with the tiger skin.” Her mother immediately draped the skin over her, and Miss Pearl’s cries of pain subsided. From then on, she kept the skin with her at all times.

When the wedding day arrived and the bridal sedan had come, Miss Pearl dressed herself in full finery. Her mother placed the tiger skin inside the sedan as a cushion. Miss Pearl stepped into the sedan, and Magistrate Guo saw her off as she was carried to the Zhu residence. Once there, she donned the tiger skin and recited the divine incantation. Just as the master of ceremonies began the rites and the guests lifted the sedan curtain, Miss Pearl leapt out in a bound, transforming into a tiger with several great strides before vanishing through the main gate. The guests scattered in terror, exclaiming in astonishment. Magistrate Guo, beside himself with rage, could only stare blankly at the others. Unwilling to reveal the truth, he followed their lead in feigning bewilderment, calling off the feast and ordering his sedan to return to the yamen. The guests dared not press him to stay and took their leave.

Zhu Jinchen fumed, “This is clearly Magistrate Guo deceiving me! I must draft a memorial to impeach him and vent my anger.” The guests replied, “One can feign many things, but how could one feign a tiger?” Zhu pondered this and, finding no recourse, let the matter drop.

Meanwhile, Miss Pearl, having escaped the Zhu residence, leapt over the city wall and fled with the speed of the wind. Within days, she arrived in Chuzhou. There, she shed the tiger skin and returned to her own doorstep. Jin Yu, seeing her from the shop, rushed out to greet her with unbounded joy. Once inside, Miss Pearl recounted all that had transpired. Jin Yu said, “Your devotion is most rare, my lady. But I am a man of humble station—how can I be worthy of the daughter of a prefectural governor?” Miss Pearl replied, “Since we pledged our lives to each other, what matter high or low?” Truly, there is no joy like returning home after a long absence. That night, their happiness need not be described.

As for Magistrate Guo, upon returning from the ill-fated wedding, he was nearly driven to his death by fury. His wife, seeing their daughter once more transformed into a tiger and gone, wept inconsolably. Their son said, “Do not grieve, my parents. It would be best to send the whole household to Chuzhou to inquire at the wine shop. Perhaps she, unwilling to remarry, has returned to her original husband—who can say?” They immediately dispatched a servant, who traveled without incident until he reached the wine shop. There, he asked the owner about Miss Pearl. Hearing this, she emerged from within and summoned the servant inside. She inquired after her parents’ well-being and all that had occurred since their parting, and the servant dutifully recounted everything. Miss Pearl then ordered the kitchen to prepare a meal for him, and the next day, she sent him home.

Upon his return, the servant reported all that had transpired. Magistrate Guo, left with no other choice, conferred with his wife and decided to send their son with servants to bring their daughter home, that their family might be reunited and she might be spared the hardships of poverty. His wife was overjoyed, and they summoned Guo Zongxian to inform him of the plan. The young master set out at once. Upon arriving at Jin Yu’s home, he was received by his sister, and Jin Yu came to greet his brother-in-law with every courtesy—needless to say.

The next day, Guo Zongxian relayed his parents’ wishes to the couple. Jin Yu promptly settled the affairs of the wine shop, forgoing all debts, packed their belongings, and hired porters and horses for the journey. Their departure need not be recounted here.

Meanwhile, Zhu Jinchen, having learned of Miss Pearl’s origins, prepared to welcome her home within days. He dispatched many servants and attendants to intercept her along the way. Sure enough, as Guo Zongxian’s procession returned with their carriages and horses, Zhu’s steward blocked their path and seized Jin Yu and Miss Pearl, carrying them away. The young master and his retinue gave chase, following them all the way to Zhu Jinchen’s gate, where they saw the two being taken inside. Guo Zongxian, at a loss, hurried home to report what had happened.

Magistrate Guo said, “Do not panic. If your sister submits to him, then so be it.”

Should she refuse, he will revert to his tiger form and flee—then we may demand our people back from him and see how he answers!" With their plan settled, no more was said of the matter.

Meanwhile, the servants had already concealed Miss Pearl in a bedchamber and written a calling card, sending Jin Yu to the county yamen with orders for the magistrate to execute him at once. The servants brought Jin Yu before the magistrate, who ascended the bench and received the card. After hearing the account, the magistrate summoned Jin Yu and asked, "Are you called Jin Yu?"

Jin Yu replied, "This humble one was originally named Zhu Yu. I recall my father’s name was Zhu Jinchen. He was once appointed judicial commissioner of Qingzhou Prefecture. When my family traveled to assume his post, we were set upon by bandits. It was night, and everyone fled in panic. I became lost in the region of Yanzhou Prefecture, where a family named Jin took me in and raised me—hence my name, Jin Yu."

The magistrate asked, "How old were you then?"

"Six years old. I am now twenty-three."

The magistrate found his story perplexing and thought, *"This old Zhu is causing trouble again—demanding I take the life of his own son!"* He summoned the steward and inquired further. To the steward, he said, "Seventeen years ago, did your master encounter bandits?"

The steward pondered a moment before replying, "Yes. Seventeen years ago, my master was appointed judicial commissioner of Qingzhou. While traveling with his family to Zhejiang’s Yanzhou Prefecture, our eldest young master disappeared. We assumed he had fallen into the river and drowned."

The magistrate pointed to Jin Yu. "Do you recognize this man?"

The steward rubbed his eyes and studied him closely. The face bore a resemblance. He cried out, "Could this be our young master Zhu?"

Jin Yu also recognized the steward as Zhu En and exclaimed in surprise. Zhu En rushed forward and embraced him. The magistrate then ordered the steward to take Jin Yu home to his father.

Zhu En returned with Jin Yu—*(text missing)*—long-lost kin, separated by fate, for which none could be blamed. Only the sacred verses of the Demon-Quelling Emperor had foretold all that came to pass.

Before the words were finished, the moon had crossed the western gallery, and dawn broke in the east. The feast dispersed. Truly:

*What once was a tale of demonic woe,*
*Now blooms as a bond of joyful matrimony.*

Thereafter, Zhu Yu and his two brothers engaged a tutor and studied diligently, ultimately becoming men of renown. They passed the imperial examinations and ascended to official ranks, serving in the Bureau of Appointments. Pearl was ennobled as a First-Rank Lady, while Guo Zongxian and Zhu Juan also passed the provincial examinations and entered public service. Both families were blessed with descendants for generations, their official stars shining brightly.

As for the tiger pelt, the young lady cherished it like Pearl herself, regarding it as a treasure for protection. Yet after being stored away for three years, when retrieved, it resembled a mangy dog—its hide and fur split apart. Truly a priceless gem turned worthless, not even a single coin’s value, becoming a laughingstock for later generations. Indeed:

*To see the strange and not be strange,*
*The strange will of itself decay.*

Earlier, a tale was told of the unrighteousness of Heaven’s Dao; later, another of the unrighteousness of the ruler’s Dao. This chronicle, however, recounts a story of the unrighteousness of human Dao giving rise to strange occurrences within a household.

Had Pearl’s parents regarded their daughter with ordinary affection, she might have lived in obscurity. Why, then, was she likened to Chang’e, building a vast Moon Palace deep in the mountains, only to encounter a sorcerous rogue, ensnared in his web? Fortunately, after years of hardship, she did not fall into the hands of wicked men. This, too, was predestined by the threads of fate, destined to reunite in a most wondrous way.

The union came about by chance, yet was wondrously preordained. This telling may seem too far-fetched—Su Dongpo once said: *"Let it be spoken idly, let it be heard idly."* So be it.

**Chapter One, Volume Five: The Fisherman Dwelling by the River**

*Verse:*
A bee’s sting may yet be cured with medicine,
But a woman’s jealousy knows no remedy.
Since ancient times, how many bearded men
Have bowed low before the curtains, humbled by silken sashes?

Among the mindless creatures of heaven and earth, even those harboring venom strike only when provoked, relying on claws and fangs to defend themselves—this is their nature, not malice. Yet a woman’s heart is a realm of divine transformation, ever more cunning, concealing filth where none would think to look, inflicting the cruelest harm. This is deliberate malice—how could its venom not surpass that of vipers and scorpions?

These words come from one who has suffered great injustice at a woman’s hands, venting the grievance of a wrong unredressed. For women are by nature yin and yielding: yin restrains yang, softness overcomes hardness. Thus even the most unyielding of men find their edge dulled before a woman, their brows meekly lowered. A wise woman, encountering such a man, responds with humility and courtesy, exceeding all caution. When both adjust like water to vessel, their harmony is perfect—this is a woman of virtue.

But an unworthy woman feigns airs, plays the coquette, and indulges her whims. The slightest dissatisfaction sends her into fits—refusing food and drink, raging day and night. She must have the last word, the final logic, and even then, she seeks parting verses, compares him to some distant fool, only then falling silent.

There was once a woman who, disdaining her husband’s poverty, turned her heart elsewhere and sang a different tune. The phoenix crown inlaid with eight treasures, the cloud-patterned robe woven in five colors—finery she wore with ease—she cast aside without a thought. What a pity!

This was none other than Cui, wife of Zhu Maichen of Burnt Axe Mountain, who despised her husband’s poverty and his livelihood of selling firewood. At forty-nine, her patience worn thin, she took up another’s lute, seeking mere warmth and fullness. Such is the fickleness of women, their hearts as shifting as willow catkins, lacking steadfastness. Yet it was also the fault of a household without discipline, allowing a meddling nun to sow discord and breed this calamity.

Some say: *"This woman was born under the Iron Broomstar—had she not left, Zhu Maichen would have remained impoverished forever, with no hope of prosperity."* Though such is the talk of men, the true principle is to endure hardship with one’s husband.

These old tales need not be retold.

Now let us speak of a woman most venomous—one who deceived the eyes of all, secretly conspired with monks, and brought about her husband’s death, only to meet a fate far more wretched than that of Cui. Her wickedness was twice as great.

This tale unfolds in the Zhide era of the Yuan dynasty, in Fushun County, Sichuan. There lived a scholar named Zhang Yong. His father, Zhang Lü, had been a man of considerable wealth, but both parents passed early, and the young man neglected all livelihood. For years he lived idly off his inheritance until his fortune was squandered. His wife, née Liu, styled Chunniang, was a woman of humble birth—fiercely cruel, diligent only in eating and sloth. Zhang Yong, lured by her modest dowry, and her father, drawn by his scholar’s status, sealed the match. Yet within a month of marriage, discord arose—though we need not dwell on such trifles.

At the time, the land had only just begun to recover from the chaos of the *jie ding* uprisings, when suddenly famine struck. What a dire season it was!

Silkworms reared, fields must still be sown—
No rest for young or old, the whole household worn.
Then came the plum rains, day after day,
And all the level plains stretched bleak and gray.

The deluge was fiercer than the floods of primordial times. The Dragon Gate’s waterfall became a plain; hills and mounds turned to yawning chasms. For two full months the waters raged before the skies cleared. Yet even then, the millet was lost, the floods unyielding—farmers craned their necks in despair, helpless to act. Only by early autumn did the waters recede.

Fearing tax shortages, the county magistrate toured the countryside to urge the people to till the land. Households toiled with all their might, reclaiming eight or nine parts of the drowned fields. As the shoots lengthened and greened, the farmers rejoiced, their hopes rising. But Heaven, it seemed, was bent on disaster, and the people’s fate was sealed. When they needed rain, the skies poured; when they needed sun, the heavens withheld it. So it went at summer’s end and autumn’s dawn—jewels and pearls of rain, they called it. The ditches and gullies might have drawn moisture from the rivers, but instead, the land grew parched. Bamboo leaves and banana fronds turned ashen; fish scales in the streams exhaled a ghostly mist. By then, there was no water to draw, and the fields cracked under the sun. Dragonflies swarmed, and all hope of harvest faded.

In such times, the rich hoarded grain, while the poor wailed in despair. Truly:

At home, the cauldrons gathered dust, and the hearths stood cold, their smoke long since vanished. Cries of despair filled the roads, sighs echoing through every lane. This was the work of a malevolent sun, the blight of the drought demon—half the fields drowned in floods, the rest withered by drought. Grass roots and tree bark became treasures, while a single drop of water from the ditches was as precious as nectar. The people starved until smoke seemed to rise from their mouths, their faces sallow as withered greens.

The local officials submitted reports of the famine, and the emperor, well aware of the people’s plight, read the memorial with a heavy heart. He ordered grain distributed to relieve the starving. All officials, whether in office or retired, were ranked by grade and required to donate a portion of their salaries to the relief effort.

But let us turn from the emperor’s benevolence to Zhang Yong and his wife, who faced this famine in dire straits. Liu Chunniang spent her days in a frenzy, demanding wine and food regardless of whether there was any to be had. If her wants went unmet, she would wail and weep, her tantrums unending. One day, Chunniang was quarreling with her husband, insisting he find some profitable trade. Zhang Yong was a scholar—unable to bear even light burdens, let alone heavy ones—what business could he possibly manage? Their argument escalated until blows were exchanged.

Just then, an old man passed by their door. Seeing the couple fighting, he stepped inside to mediate. This old man was none other than their former neighbor from three years past, who had since moved to the riverside after his business failed, now making a living as a fisherman. He had only one child, a daughter of twelve or thirteen. Honest and sincere, he was known to all as Yang Laoshi. Seeing the couple’s bitter quarrel, he entered out of lingering affection for their past friendship and tried to calm them.

This intervention would set in motion a chain of events:
The monkey’s death in Chu doomed the forest,
The city gate’s fire scorched the pond’s fish.
A disaster would unfold, nearly sending one soul to the Yellow Springs, leaving the west wind to bear its regret.

But that is a tale for later.

Now, Yang Laoshi stepped inside to find the couple no longer locked in blows but seated, tallying grievances one by one, their sobs unceasing. At the sight of him, they turned like plaintiff and defendant before the magistrate—each hurling accusations, pouring out grievances—until Yang Laoshi’s ears could bear no more. Breaking in, he counseled, “Good wife, in these lean years when livelihoods are hard-won, you and your husband ought not quarrel but discuss matters calmly and seek some trade. Even a pint or half-pint of rice in the pot will see you through. As the old saying goes, ‘After famine comes plenty.’ These days, even scholars turn their hands to business—nothing strange in that.”

Yang Laoshi’s advice to seek work struck precisely the mark with Liu Chuniang, who brightened at once. “Uncle Yang, Auntie Yang—you elders speak sense! As the saying goes, ‘A thousand strings at home are not so good as a daily penny earned.’ Better to bring in a little to feed the family than sit idle at home, staring at each other’s faces like this. What sort of life is that?” Zhang Yong, hearing Yang Laoshi also urge him toward trade, began to entertain the notion, though as a man of letters, he hesitated over what sort of work would suit him. Instead of voicing his own doubts, he turned the question to Yang Laoshi: “How has business been for you lately?”

“Fairly good,” Yang replied, “but with no one to help, an old man like me feels lonely by the river.” Chuniang seized the opening: “If you’re alone, why not let my husband assist you? Would you agree, Uncle?” Yang demurred, “That would be fine, but can your husband bear such hardship?” Chuniang sighed, “What choice do we have? The dawn’s first light brings only the clatter of an empty basket—where is the coin to be found? If we could catch a few fish to sell, it might ease these bitter days.” Yang hesitated, “Though you speak so, I cannot answer without knowing your husband’s thoughts.”

Zhang Yong thought to himself, *"If I refuse my wife’s earnest plea, she will surely unleash her thunderous wrath. Better to agree for now and find another solution later."* Turning to Yang Laoshi, he said, “That will do.”

Seeing her husband consent, Liu Chuniang’s face lit up with joy. She bustled inside to brew tea for Yang Laoshi. Zhang Yong and Laoshi exchanged pleasantries and caught up on recent news. Soon, the tea arrived, and the two men shared a cup before agreeing to choose an auspicious day to start their work by the river. All three parted in high spirits, bidding each other farewell with cheerful words.

Now, as for Liu Chuniang—when she was young and still in her parents’ home, her father, Old Liu, was already past fifty and had struggled to have a son. His only child was this daughter. By the time she reached ten, her parents’ love for her was extraordinary. Their family was quite wealthy, and they cherished her as if she were a luminous pearl or a jade of priceless worth. They never scolded her, not even a word, nor did they ever lay a hand on her. Whatever she desired—wind or rain, fine food or fine clothes—was hers. Even the daughters of humble families could not compare to her, let alone the sons of nobles.

One day, as Old Liu held her on his lap, stroking her affectionately, he sighed and said, *"What a pity she is a girl. If she were a son, our family line would continue, and in the future, there would be someone to stand by my coffin and weep, or to make a show of mourning at my grave. But a daughter belongs to another family—raising her is ultimately in vain."* As he spoke, a few tears of sorrow fell.

Just then, a vegetable vendor from across the street entered. That morning, he had weighed out his greens for Old Liu but had not yet been paid. Now, in the afternoon, he returned with his thirteen-year-old son to collect the money. As they stepped inside, they saw Old Liu cradling his daughter, tears in his eyes. Unsure of the reason, father and son stood silently at the door, watching.

Old Liu was the first to speak. “What do you need?”

The vendor replied, “Master Liu, we’ve come for the money from this morning’s vegetables.”

Old Liu quickly called his daughter inside and asked her mother for some copper coins to pay the man. Chuniang hurried in, but in her haste, a golden earpick fell from her hair. Old Liu did not notice, but the young boy was quick-witted. He promptly picked it up and handed it to Old Liu.

Old Liu was startled. “This earpick belongs to my daughter—how did it end up in your hand?”

The boy answered, “It fell from her head just now as she went inside.”

Old Liu took the earpick and studied the boy’s face closely. His features were refined—clear brows, bright eyes, white teeth, and rosy lips. The only flaw was his tattered clothing; if he were dressed in finer garments, no one would have guessed he was the son of a vegetable vendor.

Old Liu asked the vendor, “Is this your son?”

“Yes,” the man replied.

Old Liu asked, “How old is he this year? What is his name?”

The vegetable vendor replied, “He is thirteen this year, and his name is Wunan.”

Old Liu asked, “Why was he given such a name?”

The vendor answered, “When he was small, a fortune-teller said he would face many hardships, so we named him thus. If he were adopted by another family, he might avoid them.”

Old Liu, seeing the boy’s refined features and having just returned the golden earpick, felt nine parts out of ten of fondness for him. He asked, “If you were to have him adopted, what kind of family would you prefer?”

The vendor said, “Adoption is best with a childless family. If they already have a son, the adopted child would be treated half as a son and half as a servant—carrying books, holding umbrellas, enduring scoldings and beatings, and never valued. But if the family has no son, adopting him to continue the ancestral line, they would naturally cherish and care for him. They would send him to school in his youth, arrange his marriage when he grows up, and ensure he learns a trade to secure his future.”

Old Liu said, “For example, a family like ours—would you trust us?”

The vendor exclaimed, “Oh! How could we ever aspire to the honor of your esteemed household, Master Liu?”

Old Liu replied, “That is not what I mean. When arranging marriages, one considers whether families are well-matched in status, but for adoption, all that matters is whether the child appears capable of growth, and whether the adoptive father is honest and dependable. Wealth or poverty does not matter—it can still be settled.”

The vendor said, “Your household is certainly suitable, Master Liu. I only fear my son is not fortunate enough.”

Old Liu said, “You need not be so modest. If you are truly willing, tomorrow is the fourteenth, and the day after, I will visit Blind Li at the east end to divine a reading. We can finalize it then.”

Overjoyed at Old Liu’s words, the vendor dared not refuse and immediately said, “Master Liu, it is settled.”

Both families had made up their minds, awaiting the judgment of the gods to confirm the outcome. Chunniang, who had been standing nearby with the copper coins for some time, only handed them over once their conversation ended. The vendor took the coins, expressed his thanks, and left.

Old Liu placed the earpick back into Chunniang’s hair, then went inside with her to tell their mother about the matter. Old Mrs. Liu was overjoyed upon hearing the news, but no more of that need be said.

As for the vegetable vendor, he was none other than the younger brother of Blind Li the diviner—Li San. Li San was eager to have his son adopted by the Liu family but feared an unfavorable divination might ruin such a fine opportunity, which was hard to come by. The next morning, he hurried to inform Blind Li, explaining in detail Old Liu’s intention to adopt a son. He instructed, “If he comes to ask for a divination, do everything you can to ensure it goes well. Once my son is adopted, I will repay you generously in time.”

Blind Li replied, “That will be no trouble at all.”

Now, on the fifteenth day, Old Liu fasted, bathed, and took his divination fee to Blind Li’s divination shop to seek a reading. Once the formalities were complete, the blind man took up the divination tube, shook it several times, and drew out the hexagram—*Shi He* (䷫), a single yin line meeting five yang lines. According to the *Book of Changes*, this signified: “*Shi* means encounter; one yin meeting five yang suggests a woman’s virtue is not chaste.” Such was its omen, generally inauspicious for the matter at hand.

Yet Blind Li, having received his brother’s earlier entreaty, told Old Liu: “*Shi* means encounter. The character *shi* (䷫) combines *nü* (女, woman) with *hou* (后, behind), foretelling great fortune ahead—an encounter with good people.” Old Liu, now convinced, paid the divination fee, bowed in thanks, and returned home. There, he discussed the matter with Old Mrs. Liu, and after settling on an auspicious date, they proceeded to adopt a son.

Li San made all the necessary preparations, enlisting an elderly neighbor as a witness, and brought his son to the Liu household. Upon entering, the boy first paid respects at the family altar and ancestral shrine, then bowed to his adoptive parents. Even Chunniang, as his sister, exchanged formal greetings with him. A feast was laid out, and all parted in high spirits.

From then on, the family had new clothes made for him. On a day deemed joyful, they sent him to school to study, giving him the name Liu Zhangtai. Having known hardship before, he now embraced his good fortune, devoting himself wholeheartedly to his new life. He treated his parents and sister with utmost respect, and all were pleased. The bond between brother and sister grew especially close. His parents cherished him as if he were their own flesh and blood, seating him at the same table, walking beside him, and showing no distinction in their affection.

In the *Nei Ze* chapter, it is written: when a boy reaches seven, he must no longer share a seat or meals with girls; after eight or nine, upon turning ten, he is to leave home for his tutor and reside outside. Know that the words in books always hold profound reason. Yet how many households today understand this principle? Carelessly and without discernment, they conceal countless transgressions and let many slip through unnoticed. Even when parents become aware, they dismiss it as a family disgrace not to be aired, and so they cover it up.

From the moment one is born, is there anything not first seen with one’s own eyes before it is understood? Is there any matter not first spoken of by others before it is grasped? Yet the stirrings of youthful desire are different. Young imps, though untaught, somehow grasp its subtle intricacies. Chunniang was now ten—an age of knowing and yet not knowing. Unavoidably, she would listen at the bedside to her parents’ intimacies, finding them intriguing, assuming such things were common knowledge and permissible for all. Within less than a year, she and Zhangtai began exchanging sly glances, their eyes speaking volumes. At first, they remained close in their parents’ presence, but gradually, their boldness grew. With mutual understanding, they sought out secluded spots, where their trysts became as effortless as reaching into a pocket for a trinket.

Their parents, noticing their absence, would merely call them back without suspicion. Unaware, they allowed the two to carry on, until at last, the pair began engaging in acts as intimate as grinding navels to share breath.

One day, Mother Liu sewed a white silk skirt for Chunniang, and no sooner had she put it on than she and Zhangtai slipped away to the rear garden to amuse themselves. They did not return until two full watches had passed. Their mother scolded them a few times, then let the matter drop. After the evening meal, the family retired to their rooms. As Chunniang approached the bed and began to remove her skirt, Mother Liu took it from her to fold. But in the lamplight, she was truly startled by what she saw:

Dots like rouge freshly dyed,
Scattered as peach and apricot blossoms adorned.
The young scholar’s greedy heart,
The fair maiden’s tender shyness—
In one morning’s chaos,
Powder faded, fragrance vanished.
Clearly, the fragrant bud had been crushed,
Its jade-like petals bruised by dew.

Mother Liu, bewildered by the stains on the skirt, grew flustered. The truth of the matter would soon be revealed.

**Book Five, Second Tale: The Alluring Seductress Embraces the Monk**

Mother Liu questioned Chunniang, “Daughter, have you developed sores or boils down there? Why didn’t you tell your mother?”

Chunniang replied, “No, I haven’t.”

Mother Liu called her daughter to the lamplight, pulled open the skirt, and demanded, “Then what is *this*?”

Chunniang looked and saw:

Peach blossoms on the verge of fading,
Seeming to drift onto her cheeks;
Fresh buds just unfurling,
Gradually blooming upon her face.
Her moth-like brows knit in distress,
Her whole body as if seated on pins and needles;
Her phoenix eyes dazed and lost,
Her heart fluttering like a startled fawn.
Her complexion unsettled,
Her words hesitant and vague.
Her face resembled a fruit vendor’s stall—
Patches of green, clusters of purple—
Yet she could not utter a single word in reply.

Mother Liu, at that moment, felt like an earthworm in the field, her belly filled with mud. She thought, *“Has my daughter’s maidenhead been taken? If not, where did this bloody stain on the skirt come from?”*

By then, Zhangtai had heard every word clearly but feigned sleep, remaining silent. Mother and daughter fussed and chattered, then finally went to bed.

That night, Mother Liu pondered the matter carefully, never suspecting Zhangtai. The next morning, after Zhangtai had left for school, she barred the door, took up a thick piece of firewood, and made Chunniang kneel before her for questioning. Chunniang, believing such matters were permissible, saw no harm in confessing and recounted everything without hesitation.

Upon hearing this, Mother Liu was so enraged she nearly died. Instead of beating her daughter, she collapsed to the ground, wailing and weeping uncontrollably. Just then, Old Man Liu returned, only to find the door shut and his wife sobbing inside. He hurriedly called for it to be opened and asked what had happened. Mother Liu told him of their daughter’s scandalous affair.

Old Man Liu, upon hearing this, stormed to the school, dragged Zhangtai back, and was about to beat the wretched boy to death. Mother Liu intervened, “Wait! Spare him this once.” She pulled her husband aside and whispered, *“Don’t beat him too harshly. If he flees in fear, we’ll only suffer the stench of the Li family’s disgrace. If the neighbors find out, the truth will spread—what face will we have left? Remember: household shame must not be aired.”*

"All this stems from our own lack of vigilance—we cannot blame him alone. Let us wait a few more days, find some pretext, and send him back." Old Man Liu followed her advice and allowed Zhangtai to return to his studies as before.

Now, Zhangtai knew the affair had been discovered, but after the storm of fury passed, he dismissed it from his mind. Old Man Liu, however, sought a way to provoke him. Yet Zhangtai was dutiful and respectful to his mother, leaving no fault to exploit. Thus, Old Man Liu devised a plan and consulted Mother Liu, saying, *"Do this and this."* She replied, *"That makes sense."*

Old Man Liu hurried out and summoned a fortune-teller, secretly giving him several coins of silver to follow the plan. As soon as the man entered, Old Man Liu deliberately had Zhangtai stand before him to listen. The fortune-teller first arranged Old Man Liu’s four pillars of destiny and read his fate. Then he calculated Mother Liu’s eight characters. Finally, he asked for Zhangtai’s year, month, and day of birth.

After casting Zhangtai’s fate, the fortune-teller thought, *"These few coins are easily earned. This destiny is one of utter ruin—doomed to punishment and crime."* He slapped the table and sighed, *"What a wretched fate! What a wretched fate!"*

Old Man Liu feigned alarm, though his heart secretly rejoiced. He asked, *"Why do you sigh, Master?"* The fortune-teller replied, *"Who is this young man?"* Old Man Liu said, *"My own son."* The fortune-teller said, *"Forgive my bluntness—I speak only what the calculations reveal, without concealment."* Old Man Liu said, *"A gentleman asks about misfortune, not fortune. Who needs flattery?"* The fortune-teller said, *"This young master’s fate is called 'Tiger Seated in the Hall,' scattering his family’s bones. He should not remain at home. After another year, when his败运 arrives, not a single relative will survive, and his family’s wealth will be reduced to nothing."*

Old Man Liu asked, *"What if he were adopted out?"* The fortune-teller said, *"Adoption would make no difference. His fate is burdened by two layers of the 'Flowery Canopy.' If he were to leave home and become a monk, he would spare his kin harm and might even rise in the future."* These few words sent a chill down Zhangtai’s spine, unaware of the scheme.

When the fortune-telling was done, Old Man Liu paid the fee, and the fortune-teller departed. Without delay, Old Man Liu went to see the vegetable vendor Li San. He embellished the fortune-teller’s words about his son, recounting them in full, and insisted on returning the boy. Seeing Old Man Liu’s earnestness—appearing beyond reconciliation—Li San reluctantly agreed.

Old Man Liu returned home, called Zhangtai aside, and explained the situation. He gave him his usual clothes and belongings, then personally escorted him back to Li San, restoring him like a flawless jade returned. This matter, though seemingly without plan, was executed with precision—clean and leaving no trace.

Now, Old Man Liu’s household was rid of this burden. As for Zhangtai, since his first taste of intimacy with Chunniang, though his outward appearance had suffered, he had not yet reached the true realm of bliss. Yet his heart was deeply attached. Unexpectedly, after returning home for four or five days, he fell gravely ill with lovesickness. The sickness was severe—his form withered, his complexion wan, medicine ineffective, prayers unanswered.

Seeing his son in such a state, Li San went before the gods and vowed: *"If this child’s life is spared, I will offer him to the Buddha’s gate as a monastic disciple."* This was not Li San’s own vow but one prompted by Old Man Liu’s earlier recounting of the fortune-teller’s words.

After two or three months, the illness indeed abated, and Zhangtai narrowly escaped death. Once he had regained his strength, Li San sent him to Pipaji Temple to become a monk, giving him the dharma name Jingkong.

Later, Chunniang married Zhang Yong, and both her parents passed away. The vegetable vendor Li San also died. After leaving home, Zhangtai studied scriptures under his master and lived in peace. When his master entered nirvana, Zhangtai succeeded him as abbot, managing affairs with ease.

Yet he had one flaw: the sight of wine and meat was as vital to him as life itself, and the sight of women made him forget his own life. The temple’s young monks took turns keeping him company, while the alluring courtesans outside the small gate lingered in succession. Truly:

*Within the empty gate, he cultivated the Dao,*
*Yet in the realm of wind and moon, he idled away.*

As for Zhang Yong, he had initially met Jingkong because his wife’s family was acquainted with him, and he often invited the monk to recite scriptures. When they spoke of their childhood, they addressed each other as brother and sister. Jingkong would visit often, sharing tea and idle conversation before leaving with refined decorum.

One day, Zhang Yong was not at home when Jingkong arrived. Chunniang sat with him for a while. This monk was a ravenous ghost in matters of desire, a worm gnawing at the bottom of wine cups. Seeing no one around—and recalling their past intimacy—he boldly began to press close, rubbing against her.

*"Sister,"* he asked, *"do you remember what we did in the back garden?"* Chunniang smiled faintly, lowering her head in silence. Generally, a virtuous woman, when faced with a reckless man, would rebuke him sharply at the slightest impropriety, making it clear she was untouchable. But Chunniang’s smile, though wordless, had already written her consent.

Jingkong embraced her, making countless shameless advances. Chunniang feigned resistance: *"Stop this. If someone comes, it won’t be proper."* Jingkong quickly scanned the surroundings—no one was in sight. Turning back, he knelt on both knees, begging his "sister" for favor.

*"Your brother-in-law has been gone a while,"* Chunniang said. *"He’ll likely return soon. Better come another day."* Before she could finish, Zhang Yong appeared at the door. Chunniang, sharp-eyed and quick, gave Jingkong a push. *"Your brother-in-law is here."*

Jingkong hastily sat down. Zhang Yong entered, exchanged a bow, and sat. After some dull pleasantries, he took his leave.

Chunniang had set her heart on the monk, but with her husband always at home, she found no opportunity to arrange matters. Thus, she nagged and quarreled, insisting he go out to do business. Unluckily, this year of famine left them short of food and clothing, making her demands all the more pressing. When Yang Laoshi’s words aligned with her wishes, she chose the next day to send her husband fishing by the river.

Zhang Yong went to Yang Laoshi’s home, fetched his casting net, and set off together. As fate would have it, his luck ran ill with Zhang Yong—business was poor, and the fish he caught barely covered their daily meals. His distress need not be told.

Meanwhile, the county magistrate, following an official decree from his superiors, distributed ten thousand *hu* of grain to relieve the people of the county. The proclamation spread through the city. Zhang Yong saw it and returned home to tell his wife, *"The government is aiding the poor. Tomorrow, I must go to the city to claim grain."*

*"You should go,"* Chunniang replied.

The next day, □□□□□□□□□, he arrived at the county office, where crowds surged forward, each vying to be first—what a commotion! Zhang Yong thought, *"Now is no time for refined manners. I must use my strength to push through; the early bird gets the worm."* With that, he spread his arms and shoved with all his might. The scene was almost comical—he sent the crowd tumbling to either side. Why? Because in this famine, people were so starved they had no strength left; the slightest push sent them sprawling. Zhang Yong rushed forward and claimed five *sheng* of grain before heading home.

On his way, he came upon two sturdy men locked in a brawl, trading punches and kicks without end. Zhang Yong hurried forward to mediate, but they paid him no heed. Only after they had fought to exhaustion did he ask, *"What are you two fighting over? Tell me."*

One man stepped forward and said, *"Old sir, you wouldn’t understand."*

This wretched scoundrel—ten years ago, when my wife wanted to burn incense at the Eastern Peak Temple, she borrowed a foot-binding strap from my woman, and he still hasn’t returned it. When I asked for it back, he claimed my wife gave it to him as a keepsake. Does that sound reasonable to you?"

Zhang Yong turned to the man and said, "You’re in the wrong. Borrowing a foot-binding strap and not returning it, then calling it a keepsake—what nonsense!"

The other man stepped forward and countered, "Old sir, you’ve only heard his side. This dog of a cuckold—seven or eight years ago, when his wife was on her monthly courses and had no grass paper, she came to my house and borrowed one hundred and fifty-eight sheets. When I asked for them back, he denied it outright, even vowing, *'May I wipe pus and blood with what I borrowed from you!'* Now you see—what he says sounds right to him, and what I say sounds just to me. Even Zhang Yong was left speechless as the two lunged at each other again.

Zhang Yong said, "If you keep fighting like this, what if one of you ends up dead? That would be no small matter!" He forced himself between them and urged, "Stop fighting, both of you. Let me mediate."

The two men ceased their brawl and listened as Zhang Yong pronounced his judgment.

Zhang Yong said, "You only want five *sheng* of rice from him—if he gives it to you, will you let the matter rest?"

The man replied, "Exactly. If I get my five *sheng* of rice, I’ll spare him."

Zhang Yong said, "What if I repay the five *sheng* of rice on his behalf? How would that suit you?"

The two men said, "We’re just collecting a cold debt—how could we trouble you, old sir? We won’t take your rice. In this famine year, death is all around us—let’s just fight to the finish!"

They lunged at each other again, but Zhang Yong held them back with all his strength, and they did not strike. After repeated pleas, he finally persuaded them to accept his five *sheng* of rice. The man took it, expressed his gratitude, and left.

After walking half an arrow’s distance, the two men suddenly turned back and asked, "We’re grateful for your kindness, but we never learned your honorable name. We’ve returned especially to ask, so we may repay you in the future."

Zhang Yong said, "This humble one is named Zhang Yong, and I live in Anle Village to the east."

The three exchanged bows and parted ways.

Meanwhile, Spring娘 had seen all the neighbors who went to redeem grain return—except her husband. Alone, she could only lean against the gate and wait. Little did she know that this Master Zhang had also risen at dawn to redeem grain in the city and had not returned until the afternoon. As he walked, he thought, *"I acted out of kindness and gave away my rice to settle their quarrel. Now that I’m going home, how will I explain this to my wife? Can I just say I gave it away?"* After some reflection, he muttered, "That’s it—that’s it."

Zhang Yong thought, *"I’ll just say it was stolen."* As the saying goes:
*"Between husband and wife, speak but three parts of the truth—
Never bare the whole of one’s heart."*

Having settled on his plan, he returned home with ease. The moment he stepped inside, he feigned anger, pounding the table and stamping his feet, wailing, "The five *sheng* of rice I redeemed—it was stolen!"

Spring娘 was utterly dismayed. She shed a few tears alongside her husband, then went to borrow a *sheng* of rice from the neighbors. Just as she was about to head to the kitchen to prepare the meal, two men hurried over. Upon seeing Zhang Yong, they exclaimed, "Many thanks! Many thanks! Such a disturbance—such a disturbance!" They bowed repeatedly, ceaseless in their gratitude.

Fearing his wife would notice, Zhang Yong quickly pulled them aside and blinked furiously. The two paid no heed. Spring娘, watching from behind the door, saw everything clearly. She stormed out, demanding, "What’s with all this sneaking around? If you’ve something to say, speak plainly!"

The two men replied, "Madam Zhang, we fought over the rice, and your husband kindly gave us his to settle the matter. That’s why we’ve come to express our gratitude—we’ve nothing to hide."

Upon hearing this, Spring娘’s eyes flashed with fury, her gaze sharp as she raged, "He said it was stolen—so he gave it to you instead!" She cursed him without end: "Dog turtle! Dog cuckold!" The two men, sensing the storm, realized they’d been deceived. "We’ve overstepped with our courtesy," they muttered, begging forgiveness as they made their exit.

Spring娘 had long harbored disloyal thoughts, and now, over the matter of the rice, she regarded her husband as a stranger, cursing him through half the night. Zhang Yong, knowing he was in the wrong, offered not a word in reply, merely retiring to bed in sullen silence. The next day, he went to the riverbank as usual.

Now, in a nearby village lived a young man named Zhang Zhen’er. A fire had once consumed his home, reducing all his family’s possessions to ashes. Later, both his parents passed away, and Zhen’er wept for three days and nights until his eyes bled dry, leaving him completely blind. When he came of age, his relatives took turns sheltering him—one household offering a meal, another a place to stay—barely keeping him alive. But with this year of famine, even those kin, struggling to feed themselves, could no longer care for him. Blind and helpless, he could only await death. After two days without a drop of water or a morsel of food, Zhen’er thought, *"This life is surely beyond saving. Better to drown in the river than starve in a ditch—at least then I’ll follow the noble path of Qu Yuan."* In a daze, he groped his way to the riverbank, wept for a while, and was about to leap into the current.

Yet, as the saying goes, heaven aids the righteous in their darkest hour—where there seems no hope, deliverance arrives. (Of how his grievances were later avenged and he attained wealth and honor, we shall speak later.) Just as Zhen’er stood at the brink of life and death, a man suddenly seized him around the waist. *"Young man, why do you seek death in the river? If you have suffered some injustice, tell me."* Zhen’er struggled but could not break free, so he stood still and said, *"I have no grievance—only that with this famine, I can bear the hunger no longer and must end my life."* The man replied, *"You don’t seem like one of low character. Have you no kin to aid you in your hardship?"* Zhen’er answered, *"Once, there were those who helped, but now, with this year of scarcity, who would still care for me?"* The man asked, *"And how did you lose your sight?"* Zhen’er said, *"When my parents died, I wept for three days and nights until my eyes bled dry, and I became blind."* The man said, *"Then you are a filial son. Judging by your circumstances, you have nowhere to turn. Would you come with me to my home?"*

Zhen’er said, *"Do not mock me. I am one who can eat but cannot work—what use am I to you?"*

The man replied, *"My household consists of only my wife and me. I go out on business, and there is no one at home to tend to the doors and yard—nothing more than that. I need no labor from you."*

Hearing the man’s words as sincere—*"Surely he is not deceiving me"*—Zhen’er bowed his head and knelt, saying, *"If you, Father, would save me, you would be my reborn parents. I would take you as my adoptive father."* The man hurried to lift him up, took his hand, and they returned together.

Now, who was this man who saved him? It was Zhang Feng, the good-hearted soul who did not fear his wife’s scolding and who had urged her to give away the rice.

Along the way, they exchanged commonplace talk about residence, origins, and names. Zhang Feng rejoiced, saying, *"We were of the same family five hundred years ago. There is no need to change your name or surname—just call yourself Zhang Zhen’er."*

Before they knew it, they had reached his doorstep. Chun Niang saw her husband bring home this strange guest and was secretly vexed. She quickly asked about his origins. Zhang Feng told her of his attempt to drown himself in the river. Chun Niang feared any eyesore, especially one who might interfere with Jing Kong’s visits, but seeing that he was blind, she grudgingly allowed him to stay, intending to deal with the matter later.

Zhang Zhen’er bowed to his adoptive mother and settled into his new life, content to pass his remaining days in peace—no more mention of him.

Now, Jing Kong, seeing that Zhang Feng was absent, visited daily, indulging in frivolous amusements without pause. One day, Zhang Zhen’er stood at the door when Jing Kong arrived. Zhen’er heard him and asked, *"Who are you?"* Jing Kong did not answer but rushed inside with a loud noise. Zhen’er shouted, *"Who dares to barge in like that? Could it be a thief?"* He waved his hands about, groping and calling out without stopping.

Jing Kong saw Chun Niang and asked, *"Who is this?"*
She replied, *"He is your own flesh-and-blood nephew."*
Jing Kong said, *"I’ve never seen you pregnant, nor have I seen you give birth—how did you suddenly raise such a grown son?"*
The two laughed.

Chun Niang then told him Zhen’er’s story in detail, and Jing Kong understood at last. When Zhen’er heard his mother and Jing Kong speaking playfully, he realized they were familiar with each other and fell silent.

Chun Niang called Zhen’er inside to meet his uncle, but instead sent him back to sit at the door while the two carried on their usual mischief.

As for Jing Kong’s visits, Chun Niang had kept them secret from Zhen’er, but this time fate had brought them together, leaving her no choice but to reveal the truth. Afterward, whenever Zhen’er heard the sound of his voice, he would call out in greeting.

For over ten days, though Zhen’er’s eyes could not discern forms or colors, his ears grew sharp in recognizing voices and tones, and he began to suspect the truth. One day, he said to Chun Niang, *"Our father is not at home, and it is thanks to my uncle that he comes daily to oversee matters. If he finds no one around, why not move in with us? We could rely on each other."*

Chun Niang said, *"Your words may make sense, but my uncle is a monk—living together would be improper in appearance."*

Zhen’er replied, *"We are blood relatives. What fear is there of others’ gossip?"*
Chun Niang gave no clear answer.

Zhen’er’s words were deliberate, meant to provoke a reaction and test her secrets. Chun Niang, unaware, occasionally let slip careless words that gave her away, and Zhen’er remembered them all.

The next day was Chun Niang’s birthday. Jing Kong brought fish and meat, brewed fine wine, and toasted her. After they ate for a while, he sent Zhen’er to warm the wine in the kitchen, then led her into the bedroom, where they indulged in their licentious pleasures like King Xu of Chu and the enchantress of Mount Yu.

Zhen’er warmed the wine and carried it to the hall, but saw no one seated at the table. Instead, he heard from the inner chamber sounds like those of a leprous toad croaking wildly on the Third Day of the Third Month, or an old man of seventy or eighty suffering from phlegm-fire, wheezing and gasping without end.

Hearing this, Zhen’er was deeply vexed—
*"One with boundless lust, yet fears no death,
One with unwavering loyalty, yet dares not live."*

「Pounding his chest and stamping his feet, Zhen’er exclaimed: *“What brother and sister! Clearly a wanton woman and a lecherous monk! My father was a man of upright virtue—now he must endure this shameless harlot’s disgrace in our home.”* He hastily set down the wine flask, then rushed to the kitchen, seizing a cleaver: *“Let me slay these two, to avenge my father’s honor!”* Just as he prepared to step out, he paused, reflecting: *“I am blind. If I enter the chamber with this knife, and they catch sight of me first, I’ll only bring greater shame upon myself. All things must be weighed carefully—never rashly.”* He left the cleaver behind and walked out again.

Chun Niang and the monk then took their seats. Chun Niang asked Zhen’er: *“When did you bring this wine flask?”*
Zhen’er replied: *“While you two were in the chamber.”*
Chun Niang’s face flushed crimson as she glanced at the monk.

Jing Kong interjected: *“It was just when I had hurriedly relieved myself moments ago.”*
With feigned excuses, the two drank a few cups in disorder before departing.

Meanwhile, Zhang Fei spent the day fishing but caught nothing. As dusk fell and mist hung thick in the air, the fish—unaware of the nets—swam in a few. After several attempts, he found that nighttime yields three times the profit of daytime. Thus, he stayed out every night.

Seeing her husband’s habits now settled into a strict routine—never late or early—Chun Niang also deduced Zhen’er must have noticed the deception. So they agreed: at dusk he would return home, at dawn he would leave, both to share the bed and to mock Zhen’er’s blind ignorance. This scheme was cleverer than Liu Bei’s six expeditions against the Qin or Zhuge Liang’s seven captures of Meng Huo, achieving two ends at once—yet it was not a good thing.

But fate was capricious that very night. Zhang Fei fished until the third watch, yet not even a single tiny shrimp darted into his nets. Both grew weary and intended to return home when suddenly, the river revealed:」

The waters rolled in crystalline waves, where the sound of drums and bugles seemed to echo in the distance; the white surges stretched endlessly, their sight like snowflakes drifting amid dancing clouds. A jade disc and golden ingot—ah, the moon hung high in the sky! A fiery red wheel—behold, the sun emerged from the sea. Its radiance dazzled the eye like a pearl freshly plucked from its shell; its brilliance pressed upon the soul as if a gem from another mountain.

A rare spectacle of clarity unfolded before them, a sight so extraordinary that even a thousand years of reflection could scarce match its splendor.

**Chapter Five, Tale Three: The Celestial Mirror’s Fleeting Bond of Strange Affection**

As it happened, Yang Shengshi and Zhang Fei had gazed upon it for quite some time when Zhang Fei exclaimed, *"Oh no! It’s approaching the shore—we must hurry away!"*

Yet this thing, which had seemed terrifying from afar, now appeared quite ordinary when near. A round, glowing light gradually drifted into the net.

Yang Shengshi said, *"It’s in your net!"*

Zhang Fei squinted and saw the net’s four dangling claws suddenly grow heavy—his catch weighed it down. He rushed to pull it free, but the net wouldn’t budge an inch!

The two men could only step into the shallows and together lift it up. And what do you think it was?—it turned out to be:

The hairpins undone, she still gazed upon it,
Her silk robes half-changed, yet lingered there.
It was but a diamond-patterned treasure-mirror—
Both men rejoiced beyond measure.

Yang Shengshi said, *"Zhang sir, this is your fortune—
This mirror fell into your net. Take it home
To let your wife enjoy it."*

Zhang Fei replied, *"Nonsense! We share this life together—
The mirror must be split equally between us."*

Yang Shengshi said, *"To divide it in two,
We’d need saws and chisels to force it open."*

Zhang Fei said, *"Not so! Tomorrow we’ll sell it in the market,
And split the coins fairly."*

Yang Shengshi agreed, *"As you wish, as you wish.
Carry it home now—we’ll settle the rest tomorrow."*

Zhang Fei looked—this thing was heavy indeed.
He struggled, then stared in stunned silence.

Yang Shengshi said, *"Why not turn the mirror over,
Thread the net’s rope through its handle,
And sling it on your back? Wouldn’t that be easier?"*

Zhang Fei followed his advice—it worked perfectly.
With lantern in hand, he returned home.
Yang Shengshi, too, packed up his net and went.

---

While Springnian and Jingkong were in tender embrace, suddenly they heard a frantic knocking at the door in their slumber. Springnian said, *"At this hour, my husband surely would not return—why does the sound resemble his?"*

In haste, she roused Jingkong, who hurriedly dressed and went to open the door. There, in the darkness, one figure slipped in, another slipped out—swift hands made quick work of it.

But who would have thought it was Zhang Fei, holding a lantern bright as snow, while Springnian opened the door. Before she could employ her *moving-star-changing-moon* trick or Jingkong could recite his *subduing-dragon-taming-tiger* mantra, they were forced to crouch behind Springnian.

Zhang Fei set down the mirror, then searched for his old shoes—his feet were damp. He found them behind Springnian, but in the shadows saw only a shaven head.

Zhang Fei asked, *"Who is this?"*
Springnian, unable to conceal him, was pushed aside. A closer look revealed Jingkong the Monk, his robe still half-drawn, a novice’s shaven head exposed at his waist.

Zhang Fei, his fury rising from the depths of his heart, his malice welling from the edge of his courage, seized him and shouted, *"You monk! To break into a man’s home at this unholy hour—whether for lechery or theft, I’ll strike you dead on the spot!"*
Springnian pleaded weakly, *"We are siblings—what lechery? What theft?"*
Zhang Fei struck her twice with his palms, knocking her senseless.

Zhang Fei called for his son, but the boy slept on, unaware. In a rage, Zhang Fei dragged the monk to the doorstep, intending to raise the alarm.

Seeing the situation was desperate, Springnian resolved, *"No turning back now—let’s finish this and spare ourselves the shame of others’ mockery."* She and Jingkong loosened their grip, then wrapped Zhang Fei’s head in a quilt, smothering him. They tied the rope that bound the mirror around his throat and, with both their strength, pulled tight.

Alas! A man of noble virtue, who had always aided the weak and rescued the troubled, now lay lifeless—his fate no grander than a *Southern Slope* dream.

The two discussed where to dispose of the body. Jingkong said, *"Let’s bury him in a muddy pit."*
Springnian replied, *"That’s not clean enough. If traces of him are found later, it could bring us grave trouble. Better we carry him to the riverside and toss him to the fish—his bones will vanish, and the deed will be done cleanly."*
Jingkong agreed, *"Most wise, most wise."*

Without delay, he rushed into the room to dress properly, and the two lifted Zhang Fei with all their might, heading toward the riverbank. Soon enough, they reached the water’s edge, and with a splash—he was gone into the *Water Crystal Palace*.

By now, it was the fourth watch of the night. The white dew glistened, the water’s surface rippled, yet lo and behold, a dark, tangled mass floated toward them. It bore Zhang Fei away.

Springnian and Jingkong, seeing this, thought it was a great fish devouring him. Overjoyed, they returned home.

The two conferred, *"The deed is done, and no one knows a thing."*
They feigned calling for the boy, but he still slept.

Jingkong said, *"What if the neighbors question us? How shall we answer?"*
Springnian replied, *"That’s no matter. We’ll say we went fishing with Yang Shengshi and never came back. In a day or two, send the boy to ask after him. Then, we’ll create a ruckus ourselves—plant the story deep in his mind, and the matter will be settled."*
Jingkong agreed, *"Most wise."*

Before she could finish speaking, the rooster crowed at dawn, and the sky brightened. In a hurry, they left the house.

「You speak of the countless fishes in the river—where do they come from to meddle in such trifling matters?
Know this: Zhang Fei is a man of noble virtue who rescues the lost and sends them to the river. Today, he meets with this great misfortune, yet the heavens secretly protect him.
This creature is none other than the **Golden-Armored Divine Man** (*Jīnjiǎ shénrén*), bearing him away.

As it is said:
*"The Void holds its own divine oversight,
The boundless azure sky brooks no deceit."*

Setting aside this matter for now—

Now comes the tale of a certain **Qíqí Prime Minister** (*Zǎixiàng*), whose authority was resplendent and whose life was one of extravagant splendor. At over fifty years of age, he still had no son, only a daughter, **Lady Luànxiāo** (*Niǎoshì*), named **Luanling** (*Luànlíng*), who was twenty-eight in years. She was skilled in calligraphy and literature, and equally adept in needlework and feminine arts. Truly, she possessed the **rapturous beauty of a fish sinking in water, a wild goose alighting** (*Chén yú luò yàn zhī róng*), and the **grace to eclipse the moon, shame the flowers** (*Bì yuè xiū huā zhī mào*).
She spent her days drinking wine among the blossoms, composing poetry beneath the moon.

One day, the spring breeze was gentle and the air stifling, so the young lady put away her embroidery and, accompanied by her maid **Xiangchun** (*Xiāngchūn*), strolled leisurely in the rear garden.
Xiangchun supported the young lady as she walked, her **golden lotus feet** (*Jīnlián*) moving with measured elegance, her **jade ornaments** (*Yùpèi*) chiming softly, until they emerged through the side gate.
Indeed, the garden presented a scene of unparalleled beauty, and they marveled at it greatly.

How did they see it? [How was it beautiful?]」

The garden was a riot of red and green, its spring splendor nearing its ninetieth day.
Jade leaves dripped emerald dew, and blossoms floated their fragrance—
the scene alone could not be captured in three strokes of the brush.

Peach and plum trees, lush and radiant, seemed to have been painted by frost descending to scatter crimson rain,
their petals dusting the verdant moss.

Swallows chattered, orioles sang—
their voices, when heard, were like reciting the *Bright Moon Odes*,
then improvising on the *Kuan-ku* and *Zhui-qi* melodies,
their highs and lows blending into a harmonious chorus.

Pavilions and terraces stood in staggered splendor,
towers and galleries curved in elegant folds.
Willows swayed as if asleep, flowers laughed in the breeze,
waters shimmered with refined grace, mountains wore their deep green.

It rivaled the *Golden Orchard* of Jia Yi,
yet did not fall short of the *Afang Palace*’s elegance.

This garden’s beauty was boundless—
its splendor could not be fully described nor exhaustively depicted.

The young lady, confined in her secluded chambers,
paused upon seeing such a vision,
her heart yearning to wander farther—
to find a place where she might be fully content.

Gazing afar at the distant garden’s charms,
she asked, *“What place is that?”*

Xiangchun replied, *“This is the inner garden; that is the outer garden.”*

The young lady said, *“If the inner garden is so splendid,
then the outer garden must be even more wondrous.
We have long wished to see it—
let us venture out for a glimpse.”*

Xiangchun answered, *“The inner garden is already forbidden by the master,
not allowing the young lady or even the servants to frolic outside—
the outer garden is beyond reach.”*

The young lady declared, *“It does not matter.
Only—do not let the master find out.”*

Xiangchun’s heart also longed to see the garden, though she spoke otherwise—her feet had already walked many steps alongside the young lady.

Before long, they reached the outer garden. The two paused to take it in: though its vistas were broader than the inner garden’s, it was desolate and forlorn. After gazing for some time, the young lady turned to leave.

Xiangchun said, *“Since the young lady wished to come, let us linger awhile longer.”*

For the young lady, a delicate maiden of secluded life, accustomed to the bustle of jade and silk, this vast wilderness—even under the radiant sun, when flowers and willows vied in splendor—felt hollow and empty. A chill sorrow seized her, and she longed to return.

Then, from behind a too-lake stone, a crimson glow emerged. The young lady hastily called Xiangchun to look, but Xiangchun replied, *“There’s nothing there.”*

Gradually, the young lady made out its form and cried, *“That’s clearly a Buddha or deity!”* Her face paled, her feet rooted to the ground, her lips moving soundlessly as she collapsed.

Xiangchun, panicked, dared not abandon her to fetch the mistress, yet could not carry her back. She cradled the young lady as she wept. After struggling, the young lady’s breath faltered.

Xiangchun, overcome, wailed aloud. Just then, an aged gardener hauling water in the garden heard the cries and rushed over. Seeing the young lady unconscious on the ground and Xiangchun sobbing beside her, he hurried to report to the mistress.

Soon, a crowd of maids and servants, along with the mistress herself, gathered. All stood stunned. The mistress called repeatedly, but there was no response. After weeping, she struck Xiangchun severely, and seven or eight men carried her inside, placing her on the bed. They summoned the physician in haste, administered medicine, and prayed to the gods, but her body remained icy. Fortunately, her spirit still flickered like a dying flame, unwilling to depart. Her kin kept vigil day and night, watching helplessly for her return to life.

*(Here, the tale pauses—leaving the young lady’s fate unspoken.)*

Now, as for Chunniang: after that night when she lost her husband, she waited three or five days before visiting Yang Laoshi’s home to inquire after him. Upon entering, she changed her expression and said, *“My master has been gone four or five days—why did you keep him here?”*

Yang Laoshi, struck like thunder from a clear sky, stammered, *“Your master went fishing last night and pulled up a mirror in his net. He took it home and hasn’t returned these days—I was just about to go fetch him.”*

Chunniang scoffed, *“Have you seen him? You two fished together—if he’s not here, I’ll demand answers from you.”*

Yang Laoshi protested, *“A man six feet tall—how could he hide?”*

Chunniang pressed, *“You mentioned a mirror—did you kill him for it?”*

Seeing her hostile demeanor, Yang Laoshi, furious and wronged, pounded his chest in despair. Chunniang then collapsed onto a stool, weeping. His daughter tried to console her, urging her to stay for tea, but Chunniang refused and left abruptly.

Yang Laoshi, unsettled by her words, frantically sent men to search, but found no trace.

Chunniang’s scheme was cunning: if neighbors questioned him, she could frame Yang Laoshi. If no one spoke of it, she could let the matter drop. From then on, she lived freely with Jingkong, reveling in their daily companionship—whether in spring or winter, night or day—her heart at ease.

Yet her indulgence proved her undoing. After ten days of illness, she finally rose to dress, using the mirror her husband had brought back to arrange her hair. The mirror was extraordinary: its surface clear as crystal, revealing the coward’s heart; its glow ethereal, summoning celestial lovers.

At first, Chunniang admired her reflection, her spirits lifting as she applied powder and adorned her hair. But soon, a dark radiance obscured her face. Before her stretched strange mountains and rivers, twisted pines and gnarled cypresses. Nestled in the valley stood grand pavilions and halls, while tigers, leopards, and wolves prowled menacingly below.

Chunniang, transfixed, forgot her hair. Her gaze locked on the mirror, tracing every detail. Then, from within the halls emerged a figure—tall and imposing, his beard broad and unkempt, his hair tied in a topknot, his chest bare. He strode forward, and Chunniang, both startled and delighted, murmured, *“This old man—I’ve never seen him before. Let me study him closely.”*

「Only then did she see that one after another, they all emerged from behind. Chunniang’s heart raced, and she hastily stepped away. But lo, seven or eight figures stood in a line within the hall, sending Chunniang’s soul into flight—she had nowhere to hide. Glancing furtively, she found them all staring at one another in silence, speechless.

Among them, a woman stepped forward. Chunniang, with trembling resolve, approached and bowed respectfully, asking, *“Esteemed Lady, where have you come from?”* But none answered. She quickly called for her servant, yet he was not at home. Just as she was at a loss, a black-faced figure clad in golden armor and helmet emerged from behind, his right hand gripping a bronze hammer, his left hand bearing a *Zhang Fei* [張飛]—disheveled hair, grimy face—driving Chunniang back until she could no longer stand, then striking her with a single blow.

Chunniang realized her husband had come to claim her life, and so she could only submit to his fate. The moment she was struck, she collapsed in a swoon upon the ground.

The celestial beings and this armored deity all vanished into the mirror’s depths. Chunniang did not revive until afternoon, when she recounted this bizarre tale to Jingkong [靜空]. He listened with a mix of disbelief and skepticism, but set the matter aside for now.

Speaking of the Heavenly Matchmaker, the *Yuelao* [月老], tasked by the Jade Emperor to oversee mortal pairings, was just beneath the moon examining his ledgers. He found that Miss Luanxiao [鸾绡] was destined to be married to Zhang Fei of Fushun [富顺], a union of high and low, yet their bond lacked a proper foundation—fearful that they might grow old in regret. Thus, he dispatched the armored deity to grant her the *Mosheng* [摩仙] Magic Mirror, which would serve as their path to union.

But alas, Zhang Fei’s past life harbored lingering resentments yet unresolved. Upon receiving the mirror, he stirred up trouble, and suddenly faced a cruel fate. The Heavenly Matchmaker seized this opportunity: first, he had the armored deity capture Zhang Fei’s soul, binding him to Miss Luanxiao’s destined union.

Then, he sent the Flower God to fetch Miss Luanxiao’s spirit, bringing her to the Heavenly Matchmaker’s court. There, the two souls were matched in verification.

Now, the pair knelt before the Heavenly Matchmaker’s desk. He expounded on the principles of fate and the critical juncture of their union. They bowed in gratitude and rose, stealing glances at each other for a moment.

The Heavenly Matchmaker then ordered the mirror to be retrieved and entrusted to Zhang Fei for safekeeping. Turning to Miss Luanxiao, he said, *“When you gaze into this mirror, you will see your destined partner—your union for a hundred years.”* With that, he restored their vitality and sent them on their way.

It was as though the verse declared:

」

The fate of husband and wife is fixed and cannot be altered—
Forced schemes are all in vain.
Five hundred years ago, we once met face to face,
Our union recorded in the Book of Destiny.

Now Zhang Fei’s soul returned, the noose about his neck loosened—
Like a man clutching a great tree trunk, cast to the riverside,
Yet found himself in another place.
Looking up, he saw his body stranded on the sandbank.

Hastily dragging himself through mud and water to the shore, he sat down.
He bitterly reflected on the treacherous husband and wanton wife who had plotted his death,
Gritting his teeth in fury, then weeping sorrowfully for a while.
*"Heaven take pity,"* he thought, *"and spared my life.
Now night falls, and I have no hope of survival—
I might as well end it all and drown myself in the river."*
Choking back sobs, he wept again.

This very weeping stirred the debt of five sheng of rice—
A kindness unpaid, a virtue unrequited from the year before.
Suddenly, two men appeared, striking gongs and singing as they approached.
Hearing his cries, they shouted, *"Who are you, weeping here?
Could you be a spy?"*
Zhang Fei replied, *"I am a wronged man."*
The two demanded, *"Speak quickly!"*
Zhang Fei recounted his name, his family, and the schemes of the adulterous wife and lecherous monk.

The two were astonished. *"By your account, you are our greatest benefactor!"*
Zhang Fei asked, *"May I know your honored names?"*
One said, *"I am Shi En, and he is Bu De."*
Zhang Fei protested, *"You must be mistaken—I have never shown you kindness nor repaid virtue.
Why do you claim me as yours?"*

Shi En explained, *"Do you recall last year, when we two fought over rice?
You mediated and settled our quarrel. Since that day, we have been bound as brothers—
As close as flesh and blood. But in these hard times, we turned to banditry in the mountains.
Today, we were on patrol when we encountered our benefactor.
Come with us to the mountains, and we shall repay you properly."*
Only then did Zhang Fei believe their words.

The two seized his hand and dragged him along. Only then did they realize his entire body was soaked with water, so they hastily each stripped off a garment from their own backs and exchanged them with him.

Zhang Fei said, *"If I go to the mountains, what if your lord does not welcome me? Where shall I find refuge?"*

Bu De replied, *"No need to worry. Our lord is a man of righteousness and generosity, lacking only in learning. If he gains a friend like you, he will surely yield this position to you."*

Shi En added, *"Not only will he yield it to you, but he will also avenge your wrongs for you!"*

At the words *"avenge your wrongs"*, Zhang Fei’s joy knew no bounds, and he followed the two up the mountain without hesitation.

---

**Not to be digressed.**

Now, let us speak of Miss Luan Liang, who had fainted. Her parents stood vigil by her bedside. On the following day, she suddenly awoke with a start, calling out, *"Zhang Fei! Zhang Fei! Bring me the Magic Moon Mirror!"*

Her parents called to her repeatedly, and though she barely drew breath, they forced warm broth into her mouth. Soon, her limbs grew warm, and she moved again, calling out for her mother.

Her parents were overjoyed, raising their fists and bowing in reverence to heaven and earth. They brought her food, and within three or five days, she had fully recovered. She recounted her wandering soul’s ordeal to her parents.

The Prime Minister Kui Kui immediately dispatched orders across the land, posting proclamations throughout the realm: *"To whoever presents the Magic Moon Mirror, my daughter shall be given in marriage."*

He also sent several capable officials in disguise to secretly investigate the matter. This was no small affair, and within months, the news had spread far and wide.

---

As for Jing Kong, upon hearing these words, he personally went to the city to examine the proclamation. His thoughts churned: *"My younger sister has a mirror. If someone emerges from it, it must surely be the Magic Moon Mirror. If I obtain this mirror, I can present it to Prime Minister Kui Kui and win his daughter—like a flower in full bloom—as my wife. That would be far superior to this shaven-headed nun who beats monks!"*

Thus, he returned home, not telling anyone of his plan, and resolved to trick her into giving it to him before deciding what to do next. As he walked, his mind was filled with schemes, and soon he reached the doorstep, entering to see Chun Niang.

But Chun Niang had already learned the reason for his return and had pondered it thoroughly. Jing Kong had not yet spoken when she said, *"Brother, I have a windfall fortune for you."*

Jing Kong asked, *"What windfall? Share some with your brother."*

Chun Niang replied, *"Of course, there will be some for you."* Then she spoke of the mirror: *"If you obtain ten thousand pieces of gold, I will sell it to you."*

Jing Kong struck the ground with a wooden stick, stunned for a moment, before saying, *"Who has that much silver to sell? Even if I had ten or twenty taels, it would be enough."*

He spoke idly for a while.

---

After three or four days, Jing Kong thought, *"If I want to trick her into giving me the mirror, it is utterly impossible. The common saying holds true: a thousand requests are not as good as a single theft."*

When he saw Chun Niang cooking in the kitchen, he slipped into the room, rummaging through the chests and boxes—no trace of the mirror could be found. Then he realized Chun Niang knew its value and had hidden it in some secret recess, unknown to all.

Jing Kong searched for a long while without success, so he lay down on the bed and burrowed beneath it. But Chun Niang came upon him, just as the monk was crawling under the bed like a dog, which filled her with dread.

Chun Niang quietly seized a door bolt and struck him forcefully across the waist. The monk writhed in agony, quickly retreating from beneath the bed, unable even to stand straight. He collapsed to the ground, cursing, *"Thieving harlot! Why such a cruel blow!"*

Seeing him in such distress, Chun Niang raised the door bolt again to strike him down.

Jing Kong, desperate, lunged back beneath the bed to avoid her. After two watches, the pain subsided.

Chun Niang, knowing his intent to steal the mirror, asked, *"What are you doing crawling under my bed?"*

Jing Kong replied, *"If you allow me to crawl on your bed, why not allow me beneath it?"*

Chun Niang said, *"Now, not even the bed is permitted to you."*

Jing Kong, embarrassed, forced a grin. *"But I must crawl a little."*

He grabbed her hand and pulled her onto the bed, intending to make amends with her through carnal union.

Chun Niang turned away in disgust and violently shook him off.

Jing Kong, seeing no progress in his words, flew into a rage and said, *"You dare treat me with the same tactics you used for Zhang Fei! You will not get away with it!"*

Upon hearing this, Chun Niang grew furious and declared, *"You black-hearted bald beast! You have defiled me with your touch, and you took my husband’s life. Now you have allied with this bald rascal—how could there ever be a happy ending for us? You had better leave at once!"*

She pushed him away with force.

Jing Kong, enraged by her shove, felt a fire burn within him—clearly, she meant to sever all ties. He seized Chun Niang and threw her to the ground, beating her soundly before storming off. Such is the fickle nature of the wicked: what once was deep affection now turned to bitter enmity. Few grasp this cruel logic.

To understand Chun Niang’s betrayal: her affair with the monk was but a fleeting lapse. Once entangled, she could not break free. When her husband was away, she seized the chance for stolen moments—never with intent to harm him. Fate intervened when Zhang Fei returned unexpectedly, forcing her into a desperate ploy to hide their shame. Later, after her husband’s death, Jing Kong clung to her like a spouse, never leaving her side—yet soon, even his presence grew repulsive.

Worse still, their intimacy became grotesque: the monk, coy and simpering, would press his shaved pate against her face, rubbing it like a child’s toy. If his head was freshly shorn, it might pass—yet even the slightest stubble grew unbearable. And when they coupled, he ravaged her like a starving tiger or a ravenous hawk, leaving her to endure it, again and again.

「Now each day, as he performs his duties, the monk grows ever more reckless—turning his weapons against his own side, surrendering his armor, and submitting letters of capitulation, leaving himself utterly disgraced. Jing Kong could no longer bear the sight of it.

Compared to her own husband, who was a man of letters, this monk’s heart was as coarse as a butcher’s, utterly lacking the tenderness one might show to a delicate flower or a cherished lover. Thus, their daily interactions had changed drastically from before: now distant and indifferent, she let him come and go without a trace of affection.

Every night, when the fifth watch came, she would wake from a dream, her morning *qi* clear, her conscience stirring. She thought of her husband, innocent and wronged, sent to the Yellow Springs, his corpse scattered and lost—then tears of repentance and remorse would well up.

She wanted to reject the monk, yet dared not make a scene. Today, seizing this opportunity, she would quarrel fiercely and drive him away.

Though Jing Kong harbored such thoughts, she still did not dare to sever ties outright. Yet with this mirror in hand and this fortune at her disposal, she feared that if the monk remained, he might secretly strike at her from behind or demand his share when she sought official favor. So she nursed a grudge, plotting in her mind.

She reasoned: *With this wealth, I could marry a proper husband—a man of honor and upright virtue*—and establish a dignified household. To spend my days guarding this shaved pate would be shameful before old acquaintances and neighbors.

These were wicked and cunning thoughts, ones no decent person would conceive. And the monk was no better—he sought only to use this mirror to rise to great wealth and power, then treat her as a stranger, as incompatible as ice and fire. If he still stole glances at her, she would cut off all paths to him, and he would never dare return, even if it cost him his life.

At first, without a wife, he had treated her like a treasure beyond price;」

When the time came and he stayed long by her side, his greed awoke as well. This was the thought of a wicked man who, having gained one hill, covets another—needless to say.

Little did they know that this quarrel, born within their own walls, would stir up trouble: a false blind boy discerned the truth, while a true filial son sought vengeance for his father. To see how their tongues would bring forth calamity, one must turn to the next account, which shall satisfy the reader’s curiosity.

**Chapter Five, Episode Four: The Blind Boy’s Clever Vindication of the Wronged**

As Zhang Zhen’er sat by the hearth, straining to hear the two quarreling, his sharp ears caught every word with perfect clarity. The next day, he fashioned a crude staff and made his way to a relative’s home, where he begged them to draft two petitions, which he tucked away before hurrying to Huanglong Temple to confront Jingkong.

Just then, Jingkong stood at the temple gate, engaged in conversation with someone. Upon seeing Zhen’er, he called out, *“Nephew, what brings you here?”* Hearing Jingkong’s voice, Zhen’er stepped forward and bowed, but fearing eavesdroppers, he fell silent again.

Jingkong, wary of what he might say, seized his arm and pulled him into his own quarters, demanding, *“What business do you have here?”*

Zhen’er replied, *“Your nephew has come to warn you, Uncle. Yesterday’s altercation was overheard by neighbors, and they’re saying you plotted to kill my father. The local constables are preparing to report you.”*

Jingkong’s hands trembled as he considered his options. After a moment, he told Zhen’er, *“I have no choice now. Tomorrow, I’ll file a petition first, accusing your mother of killing her husband.”*

Zhen’er protested, *“If you do that, Uncle, you’ll clear your own name—but at my mother’s expense.”*

Jingkong scoffed, *“Let her suffer! What matters is my own reputation?”*

Zhen’er pressed for details about his father’s death, and Jingkong recounted them all.

After speaking for some time, Jingkong saw Zhen’er out of the temple gates. Upon returning home, Zhen’er was seized by alarm.

Chunniang asked why, and Zhen’er replied, *“Just now, as I walked to the gate, I heard people on the east say that Zhang’s wife plotted to kill her husband, and on the west, they said that Liu Chunniang had strangled her old man. I asked, ‘How do you know this?’ The crowd answered, ‘Your mother hanged herself with a noose and dumped the corpse in the river.’”*

Upon hearing this, Chunniang’s face paled—every word matched what had been said. She had no way to deny it, pleading desperately for Zhen’er to devise a plan to avert the disaster. Zhen’er feigned hesitation, but Chunniang’s frantic entreaties and tears broke him. She collapsed at his feet, sobbing.

Zhen’er quickly lifted her up and asked, *“Mother, do you still wish to have any dealings with that uncle of yours?”*

Chunniang spat, *“That wretch? What dealings could there be? He dishonored my daughter, and now he’s taken your father’s life! I’d tear him limb from limb and drink his blood to avenge this wrong!”*

Zhen’er said, *“Then we must file a petition first—accusing him of murdering Father. That way, we can shield Mother from blame.”*

Chunniang agreed, *“That makes sense.”*

Zhen’er then questioned her in detail about her father’s death. Chunniang, though unprompted, recounted the events in the same way Jingkong had described them.

The next day, Zhen’er handed a petition to Chunniang to submit, while Jingkong also filed his own. The magistrate, reviewing the two conflicting accusations—one claiming murder, the other conspiracy—suspected foul play. He immediately issued an order, summoning both accusers for interrogation.

Before long, they were both brought in. After recording their statements, both parties defended their claims with seemingly sound reasoning.

The magistrate asked, *“Are there others in your household?”*
Chunniang replied, *“Only a blind man remains at home.”*

The magistrate then had Zhen’er brought in for interrogation. As soon as Zhen’er entered the hall, he remained silent and instead handed up another petition—accusing *both* of them. The magistrate understood at once and ordered the two original accusers to confess.

The pair pushed blame back and forth, refusing to take responsibility. The magistrate then had Jingkong beaten with a *jiāgùn* (夾棍), striking him fifty times, and Chunniang was tortured with a *zānzi* (拶子), enduring thirty blows of the *guòchuán dīng* (過船釘). Unable to bear the pain, they finally confessed to the charge of *delinquency* (奸).

As for the murder, there was no corpse nor weapon—so the magistrate could not convict them. He released the torture implements and ordered them to be re-examined the next day. The three were then driven out together.

When they reached a secluded spot, Chunniang turned to Jingkong and said, *“We’ve been framed by Zhen’er. Now that matters have come to this, we’ve confessed to the *delinquency*, but the murder we cannot admit. If they torture us again, we’ll have to pin it on Yang Laoshi.”* The two agreed on their plan.

The next day, at the re-examination, when the magistrate threatened torture once more, they both immediately implicated Yang Laoshi. The magistrate issued an arrest warrant on the spot. Yang was brought in, beaten with the *jiāgùn*, and forced to confess—claiming he had been drowned in the river.

The magistrate then ordered their imprisonment and sentencing. A pair of *shuānglián jiā* (雙連枷) was fitted upon the *delinquent monk and wanton woman*, and they were paraded through the four city gates as a warning. *(This concludes the tale of Chunniang’s unjust suffering.)*

Now, as for Zhang Feng—after encountering Shi and Bu at the riverside, the two led him up the mountain. Upon meeting the bandit chieftain, Zhang Feng quickly bowed in greeting. The chieftain, whose name was *Niǎoshān Dàwáng* (鳥山大王), was surprisingly refined, with none of the brutishness typical of bandits. Seeing Zhang Feng kneel, he hurriedly helped him up and said, *“You are a man of righteousness. Today, after such misfortune, take comfort and stay here—I shall avenge your wrongs and clear your name.”* He then had a seat prepared for Zhang.

After tea, a feast was set before him in welcome.

The two men struck up an instant friendship, forming an unbreakable bond, and Zhang Feng was immediately appointed as military strategist.

Zhang Feng was a man of cunning—with the chieftain’s approval, he forged proclamations and wrote out arrest warrants, which delighted the bandit lord. After more than a month had passed, the chieftain dispatched several dozen henchmen to Zhang Feng’s home to seize the two individuals and subject them to interrogation.

The henchmen, having received their orders, disguised themselves as common folk. After traveling several days, they arrived in the district of Fushun. Inquiring after Zhang Feng’s residence, they waited until dusk before forcing their way inside. Searching the house thoroughly, they found no monk or woman—only an old blind man asleep by the hearth. They seized him roughly and demanded, *“There was a monk and a woman here—where have they gone?”*

The blind man, startled awake, struck his head in confusion and stammered, *“The monk and woman were put in stocks.”*

*“There’s no one here,”* the henchmen snapped.

*“They were put in stocks in the city,”* the blind man replied.

*“Zhang Feng clearly said they were outside the city—how could they be inside?”* One of them struck the blind man across the face, jolting him fully awake. He heard them mention Zhang Feng and, bewildered, asked, *“What did you just say about Zhang Feng? Have you seen him?”*

The henchmen recounted Zhang Feng’s background to him. Only then did the blind man realize they were bandits and, fearing for his own role in the affair, told them what he knew.

*“If that’s the case,”* the henchmen mused, *“how shall we report back to the chieftain?”*

One suggested, *“We’ll just take this blind man with us.”*

The blind man pleaded, *“I was about to turn against those two myself! If you take me, their punishment will be lighter!”*

The henchmen hesitated, at a loss for tangible proof, deliberating for some time.

The blind man saw that the torches in their hands had already burned out. The henchmen were thrown into disarray, unable to devise a plan. One said, *“Brothers, don’t panic! Let me tell you a story.”*

The others replied, *“When? Tell us a story!”*

The man said, *“If I tell you a story, we’ll have torches.”*

Hearing this, the henchmen had no choice but to listen attentively. The man began:

*“In the Three Kingdoms era, Guan Yunzhang, along with the two ladies, Lady Gan and Lady Mi, surrendered to the Han and stayed in an inn. Cao Cao sent someone to deliver gifts—all were prepared, except for candles, of which there was only one. This was because Cao Cao saw that Guan was alone escorting the two widows, so he devised this scheme. But who knew that Guan was a man of extraordinary wit and foresight! When he saw the candle’s flame was about to gutter out, he ordered the demolition of every wall in the inn, then set the bamboo slats ablaze, burning through the night. This is called the **‘strategy of torches’**—*fénliáo zhī cè*. Now, we have no torches, but there are walls all around us. Why hesitate?”*

The henchmen, upon hearing this, immediately sprang into action, tearing down countless walls and binding them into torches. As they demolished a wall partition, a round object tumbled out. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be a mirror.

Zhang Zhen’er heard it was a mirror and said to the crowd, *“Your Excellencies need not trouble yourselves—this mirror was obtained by my father while fishing. You may take it to him, and it shall serve as proof of my words.”*

The henchmen carried the mirror away and left. *(No further mention of this.)*

Now, as for Zhang Zhen’er, upon learning of his father’s fate, he thought: *“If I do not go to demand justice from them for my father’s life, how can Yang Laoshi ever be avenged? Now, I shall play the part of a beggar, and on my back, I shall bear a yellow cloth banner with the words ‘vengeance for my father’ written upon it, seeking retribution along the streets.”*

To his surprise, his business thrived. You ask why? It was because of the bold sign he bore—everyone said he was a filial son, and copper coins and grains of rice poured in, allowing him to earn enough for abundant food and clothing.

One day, as he wandered to a desolate place, he saw three men who called out to him, *“You seek vengeance for your father—now, we have come to take you to your death!”*

Zhen’er asked, *“Who are you?”*

The three replied, *“We are officials sent here.”*

Zhen’er said, *“I am precisely seeking justice—then let us go together.”*

The three retorted, *“If you go with us, you will surely die. It would be better if you did not seek vengeance, and we would let you escape alive.”*

Zhen’er declared, *“My father died unjustly, and today’s grievance, even if I must brave boiling water or tread fire, I will not refuse. I will avenge this wrong, and then I may die in peace.”*

Seeing his unwavering filial devotion, the three men, though they tested him with their words, found no way to sway him. They then said, *“Your filial heart is indeed sincere, but your eyesight is unclear, making it difficult for you to act. We have eye medicine here—let us apply it and open your eyes.”*

Zhen’er rejoiced, *“If this is so, I shall see the light of day!”*

The three men applied the medicine to his eyes, and they opened. Zhen’er looked closely and saw that they were three **Dao/Way** masters. He quickly bowed his head to the ground in reverence, knocking his forehead against the earth seven or eight times.

When he rose, the three had vanished. Zhen’er was both astonished and overjoyed, thinking, *“It must be the Three Officials of Heaven, moved by my filial piety, who have come to rescue me.”*

He then discarded his crutch and walked freely, feeling unbounded joy. *(No further mention of this.)*

Meanwhile, Yang Laoshi suffered these hardships in prison, unable to see his loved ones. His household had only a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old daughter, delicate and tender, left alone at home. Fortunately, the neighborly Madam Wang came to keep her company.

Yang Laoshi spent his days in prison without thought of returning home. Unexpectedly, Zhang Zhen’er’s eyesight became clear, and his begging business prospered. He first delivered the earnings to the prison, waiting for Yang Laoshi to eat before he himself partook, doing this daily without fail. If there was any extra silver or money, he used it to buy firewood and rice for his father’s daughter.

Truly, one man sustained two lives. *(No further mention of this.)*

Now the bandits returned to the mountain with the mirror, reporting to the Great King. They then went to see Zhang Feng, explaining the matter. Zhang Feng took the mirror and placed it in his room, then **rested there for the night**.

He saw many immortals entering in procession, gazing at the mirror in bewilderment, unable to fathom it. After pondering through the night, the next day he told the Great King of Bird Mountain, who rejoiced, saying:

*"Based on your words, this must surely be a treasure. Now the Prime Minister Qíqí has dispatched men to sketch likenesses and search the land—whoever presents the Magic Mirror of the Immortals shall be granted the princess in marriage. Why not present this mirror and seek fortune and honor? If you remain here in the mountains forever, there will be no end to it. Though I speak plainly, it is only for your own good."*

Zhang Feng reflected in silence. The visions he had seen in the Hall of the Moon Lord matched these events, so he agreed. The two decided their plan, and the next day sent two bandits to carry the mirror, packing supplies. The Great King of Bird Mountain gave fifty taels as parting gifts, prepared a farewell feast, and personally escorted them to the ten-li pavilion. They clasped hands—*(text ends here)*.
