*Abstract*

(We, your) ministers respectfully note: *Laozi’s Explanations in Brief* in two fascicles was composed by Zhang Erqi of the present dynasty. Erqi’s *Punctuated Commentary on Zheng Xuan’s Notes to the* Ritual Records *has already been recorded. Those who have explicated the* Dao De Jing *are numerous, but they often become entangled in convoluted interpretations, creating obstructions of their own. In this compilation, Erqi alone sets aside all such distractions and briefly elucidates its general meaning. In his preface, he states: “As I perused the original text, whenever I encountered passages that remained unclear, I would occasionally venture my own conjectures, adding a word or two in the gaps between punctuation marks. Thus, the great meaning becomes as clear as a plow turning the earth, far removed from the myriad commentaries. If one cannot read it, then one simply does not read it—no further desire is needed.”

He also appended a postscript, recording a dialogue: “Someone asked Master Zhu [Xi], ‘If the Dao can be spoken, then should it be explained?’ Zhu replied, ‘If the Dao could be spoken, it would not be the eternal Dao; if the Name could be named, it would not be the eternal Name.’ Master Zhu never explained Laozi in his lifetime. Had he done so, this would have been his method—indeed, it could be called the method for explaining all texts. The essential point lies in not clinging to explanations while seeking them; returning to the text itself, one explains this book with this book alone.”

Thus, the primary aim of this work is to immerse oneself in the original text and grasp its inherent principles and flavor. It avoids the speculative and deceptive discourses of others, nor does it touch upon the arts of alchemical elixirs or transmutation. Clear and concise, it is well-suited for reference and consultation.

**Preface to *A Brief Explanation of the Laozi***

The *Laozi* elucidates the Dao and virtue, aiming to cultivate the self and extend its principles to all under heaven—its intent differs from those who abandon worldly affairs and forsake conventional ethics. Earlier scholars, in examining its origins and evolution, have often debated its doctrines, yet none dispute its emphasis on tranquility and non-contention. Some admirers seek to elevate it above the Six Classics, which is untenable; yet to dismiss it outright as akin to the teachings of Buddhism or the arts of immortals would also be excessive.

Commentators proliferate, each striving for novelty and distinction, interpreting the *Laozi* through the lens of their own preconceptions—no longer the *Laozi* of the Western Zhou’s Archivist, so that the true *Laozi* seems nearly lost. It is like water: steeped with tea, it becomes bitter; mixed with sugarcane, sweet; blended with vinegar, sour; salted, salty; infused with tangerine, orange, ginger, or cinnamon, it takes on their flavors. To claim that water’s taste is inherently thus would be to misrepresent water itself.

This summer, I chanced upon this text, but my eyesight, much weakened, made close reading arduous. I could only skim its main passages, and where meaning eluded me, I ventured my own conjectures, adding a few words between lines and punctuation. Yet the overarching principles suddenly became clear, and upon revisiting the various commentaries, I found I no longer wished to read them—nor even could.

I laughed at myself, thinking: *The poor man sips water and scorns the complexity of fine wines—how can he be expected to appreciate the full range of flavors in the world?* Nevertheless, even after satiation, a rinse of the throat and cleansing of the teeth may yet find some use in this.

Thus, I have recorded and preserved these notes, calling them *A Brief Explanation*.

*Written on the day after the full moon of the fifth month in the summer of the jiyou year of the Kangxi reign (1669) by Zhang Erqi of Jiyang.*

**A Brief Explanation of the Laozi, Volume One**
*By Zhang Erqi of Jiyang*
**Part One**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things. Thus, always without desire, observe its mystery; always with desire, observe its manifestations. These two emerge together yet differ in name. Together they are called the profound. Profound and yet more profound—the gateway to all mysteries.

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The eternal Dao cannot be spoken. If the eternal Dao cannot be spoken, can it then be named? The name that can be named is not the eternal name of the Dao. That which cannot be named is the very beginning of Heaven and Earth. Only after Heaven and Earth exist does the namable arise. This namable is truly the mother from which the myriad things are born. The Dao’s movement from nonbeing to being is thus.

Therefore, the sage who embodies the Dao constantly embodies its nonbeing to observe its mystery, without departing from being to observe its manifestations. Being and nonbeing serve as each other’s substance and function—there is fundamentally no duality, only differing names. Nonbeing is indeed profound, yet being is also not mere trace; together they are called the profound. But "profound" does not suffice to exhaust it—it is profound and yet again profound. Within this double profundity, all principles are complete. Is this not the gateway to all mysteries?

The Dao that can be spoken aligns with the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s "Dao that can be followed"—it is what people may follow in their conduct. Some punctuate "always without desire" and "always with desire" as separate phrases, taking "desire" to mean intention or emotion. They say: when without intention, observe the mystery of the Dao; when with intention, observe its manifestations. I contend that when one has desire, one is not without desire, and when one is without desire, one is not with desire. How then can one speak of "always without desire" and "always with desire"? Thus, the phrase should be punctuated after "nonbeing" and "being."

"Manifestations" (徼) are like the borders of a frontier—the furthest extent of things. Master Zhu said: "It resembles a boundary, the point where things connect." For when things reach their limit, there must be something that follows. Examples include the following chapter’s "beauty and ugliness" and "goodness and its absence." Only by paying attention to these points can one properly handle affairs. Su Ziyou said: "Anything distant and without limit must appear profound in color. Thus, Laozi often uses 'profound' to signify the ultimate."

Master Zhu said: "Profound means deep and remote, verging on darkness—where all mysteries reside."

This chapter is the guiding principle of the entire work. Hereafter, whenever speaking of the Dao’s essence, observe its mystery—the eternal Dao, the nameless. Whenever speaking of its application in affairs, observe its manifestations—the non-eternal Dao, the named.

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, its absence arises. Thus, being and nonbeing give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low incline toward each other; sound and voice harmonize with each other; front and back follow each other. Therefore, the sage practices nonaction in affairs and teaches without words. The myriad things arise without refusal, are born without possession, act without reliance, and succeed without dwelling. Precisely because they do not dwell, they do not depart.

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, they will vie to claim it, and beauty will no longer be true beauty. When all know goodness as goodness, they will compete to attach themselves to it, and goodness will no longer be true goodness. Originally beauty, yet it becomes ugliness; originally goodness, yet it becomes its absence. If one knows the reason beauty becomes ugliness and goodness becomes its absence, and handles them accordingly, then beauty will be truly beautiful and goodness truly good.

The mutual generation of beauty and ugliness, goodness and its absence, follows this cyclical principle. Thus, being and nonbeing give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low incline toward each other; sound and voice harmonize with each other; front and back follow each other—all are like this. Therefore, the sage, knowing this, practices nonaction in affairs and teaches without words. The myriad things arise before him, beauty and ugliness intermingled, yet he never refuses. He gives life to and nurtures the myriad things without claiming possession, governs affairs without relying on his ability, and when his work is complete, he does not dwell in it. Precisely because he does not dwell, his achievements endure and do not depart. In this way, beauty is not known as beauty, goodness is not known as goodness—yet beauty and goodness are thereby preserved.

This chapter’s first half exemplifies what was earlier called "observing its manifestations." At the furthest extent of beauty lies ugliness; at the furthest extent of ugliness lies beauty—this is true of all such pairs. Thus, what follows is observing manifestations to attain mystery.

Do not exalt worthiness, so the people do not contend. Do not prize rare goods, so the people do not steal. Do not display what is desirable, so their hearts are not confused. Therefore, in the sage’s governance: he empties their minds and fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions and strengthens their bones. He constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire, so that the knowledgeable dare not act. By acting through nonaction, nothing is left ungoverned.

If the ruler exalts worthiness, the people will distinguish themselves and contend for fame. If he does not exalt worthiness, they will not contend. If the ruler prizes rare goods, the people will compete for profit and even resort to theft. If he does not prize rare goods, they will not steal. If the ruler displays what is desirable, the people will desire it and their hearts will be confused. If he does not display what is desirable, the people’s hearts will not be confused.

The nature of the people is thus. Therefore, in the sage’s governance: when it comes to ornate matters, he ensures tranquility; when it comes to simple and unadorned affairs, he ensures fulfillment—this is emptying their minds and filling their bellies. When it comes to contentious tendencies, he ensures they are blocked; when it comes to self-reliance, he ensures it is esteemed—this is weakening their ambitions and strengthening their bones. He constantly keeps the people without discriminating knowledge and without covetous desire, and ensures that the clever dare not employ their private cunning to disrupt his governance.

What he practices is simply following the people’s nature without interference. Thus, nothing under Heaven is left ungoverned.

The four terms—mind, belly, ambition, and bones—are all metaphors.

The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible. Profound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things. It blunts its sharpness, unties its tangles, softens its light, and merges with the dust. Deep! It seems to endure. I do not know whose child it is—it resembles the ancestor of the gods.

The Dao is empty and utterly without form, yet its use adapts to the myriad things without limit. None can exhaust its fullness. Profound! It resembles the ancestor and master of the myriad things. Those who embody the Dao must blunt their sharpness and not contend, untie the tangles of things without disturbance, soften their light and not dazzle, merge with the dust of things without severance. Deep and still, it seems to endure. I do not know whose child it is—it appears to precede even the gods.

Shao Bian notes: The two instances of *qi* (其) in the upper passage refer to oneself, while the two in the lower refer to others. The words *huo* (或, "perhaps"), *si* (似, "resembles"), *yan* (言, "speaks"), and *xiang* (象, "image") all refrain from asserting definitively—this is the subtlety of observing the constant and formless. Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs. The space between Heaven and Earth—is it not like a bellows? Empty yet never exhausted, the more it moves, the more it brings forth. Much speech hastens exhaustion; better to abide in the center.

Heaven and Earth never bestow private favor upon things; they simply allow the myriad things to live and die of themselves, regarding them as straw dogs used in sacrifice—adorned when presented, not out of love; discarded after use, not out of hatred. All is as it naturally is. The Sage’s relation to the hundred clans is likewise without private favor; he follows the natural tendencies of the people without harming them, letting life and death, giving and taking proceed as they will, while he remains without intent. Is not the space between Heaven and Earth like the bellows of a smith? The bellows is empty within yet never exhausted; the more it moves, the more qi it emits. Heaven and Earth’s generation of the myriad things is just like this—what need is there for private favor? To understand Heaven and Earth is to understand the Sage. The Sage’s way of governing the people likewise has its own emptiness that never exhausts—this is what is called the center. Abiding in it suffices. Why exhaust oneself with much speech?

Jiao Shi comments: *Qu* (屈) means "pent-up," the sense of being restrained and unable to extend. The final two lines seem forced, as if making a separate point. Wang Chunfu suggests that Laozi, fearing later generations would misconstrue the straw-dog analogy, added this sigh—an interpretation that carries weight.

"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and enduring, it seems to persist; its use is never strained."

The valley spirit does not perish with things—this is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female is whence Heaven and Earth arise—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Those who study the Dao embody this alone. Subtle and enduring, it seems to persist—not as persistence, but as persistence. Its use responds to things without strain—this is the use of the useless.

Jiao Shi says: The valley is a metaphor for its emptiness and capacity to receive, receiving without possessing. Subtle and wondrous, beyond measure, it is called the valley spirit. The female gives birth to the myriad things, as in the earlier chapter’s "mother." Calling it the mysterious female conveys its profound, unfathomable nature.

Xue Juncai says: *Pin* (牝) should be read like *bi* (匕) to rhyme with the preceding line. The phrase "the gate of the mysterious female" is an interpolated gloss, rhyming with the following line.

Su Shi says: Calling it the valley spirit describes its virtue; calling it the mysterious female describes its function. The female gives birth to the myriad things yet is called "mysterious"—this means it gives birth without revealing how it gives birth. This elaborates the opening chapter’s theme. "The valley spirit does not die" is what was called the constant Dao. "The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of Heaven and Earth" is what was called the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth. "Subtle and enduring, it seems to persist"—this is the subtlety of observing the formless. "Its use is never strained"—this is the subtlety of observing the boundary. "Heaven is eternal, Earth everlasting. The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and everlasting is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can long endure. Therefore the Sage places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead; sets himself aside, yet finds himself preserved. Is it not because he is without self-interest that he can achieve his self-interest?"

Heaven is eternal, Earth everlasting. The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and everlasting is that they give life to things without claiming it as their own—thus they can long endure. If Heaven and Earth were to claim their life as their own, they would be but one thing among things—how could they be eternal and everlasting? Therefore the Sage dwells in softness and lowliness, fundamentally placing himself behind, yet finds himself ahead. Without desires or demands, fundamentally setting himself aside, yet finds himself preserved. Is it not because his heart is without self-interest that he achieves his self-interest? His being behind and preserved follows inevitably from principle and circumstance.

"The highest good is like water. Water benefits the myriad things without contention, dwelling in places all others shun—thus it is near the Dao. In dwelling, it favors the lowly; in heart, it favors the profound; in giving, it favors benevolence; in speech, it favors trust; in governance, it favors order; in affairs, it favors ability; in movement, it favors timeliness. It is only because it does not contend that it is without blame."

The highest human good resembles water. Water’s nature is to benefit the myriad things without contention. People all prefer the high, yet it alone descends to dwell in places all others shun—thus it is near the Dao. The highest good in a person: in dwelling, it favors the lowly, finding no place that is not secure—like water flowing, stopping in hollows. In heart, it favors the profound, still and unfathomable—like water’s emptiness and silence. In giving, it favors benevolence, nourishing and benefiting all things—like water’s moisture sustaining all life. In speech, it favors trust, never forsaking its course—like water flowing through peril without fail. In governance, it favors order, cleansing impurities and leveling high and low—like water washing away filth and balancing disparities. In affairs, it favors ability, adapting in myriad ways—like water dissolving hardness and penetrating the minute, reaching everywhere. In movement, it favors timeliness, ever-changing—like water avoiding the high and seeking the low, flowing without stagnation. Possessing all these virtues and yet able to refrain from contention—only because it does not contend is it free from blame in the world. This is why the highest good resembles water.

"To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping. To measure and sharpen it cannot be long preserved. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can keep them. Wealth and nobility breed arrogance, leaving one’s own fault behind. When merit is achieved and fame established, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven."

To cling and fill is not as secure as ceasing. To measure and sharpen is to fail to recognize that sharpness cannot be long preserved. When gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them—what use is filling? Wealth and nobility breed arrogance, leaving one’s own fault behind—what use is sharpness? One should follow the Dao of Heaven alone: when merit is achieved and fame established, withdraw. To have yet not possess—this is not what is called filling. To act in accord with principle—this is not what is called sharpness.

The various editions often interpret this as "holding to fullness and measuring sharpness." "Carrying the hun-soul and embracing the one—can they not be separated? Concentrating qi to attain softness—can one be like an infant? Cleansing and purifying profound vision—can it be without flaw? Loving the people and governing the state—can one do so without action? The gates of Heaven open and close—can one remain receptive? Understanding the four directions—can one be without knowledge? Giving life and nurturing, giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, growing yet not dominating—this is called profound virtue."

When the heart is enslaved by things, the hun and po souls separate. For one who carries the hun-soul within the po and embraces the one—can they constantly guard and not part? When the heart manipulates qi, qi becomes disordered. For one who concentrates and guards their qi to attain softness—can they be as pure as an infant? When private attachments are not exhausted, the spirit is obscured. For one who cleanses and removes the dust of the world to achieve profound and boundless vision—can it be without flaw? When the body is already governed and one governs others, loving the people and governing the state—can one sit in clarity and principle without action? The gates of Heaven open and close in response to changing affairs—can one act as the receptive and not as the assertive? Having thoroughly understood the principles of affairs in all four directions—can one remain obscure as if without knowledge? If one can do this, then for the people of the world, one gives life and nurtures, gives life yet does not claim possession, acts yet does not rely on effort, grows yet does not impose one’s will to dominate—this is the virtue that is deep, far-reaching, and difficult to name.

Master Zhu said: The hun is yang, moving; the po is yin, still. The hun is fire, two; the po is water, one. Thus it is said, "Carrying the hun-soul and embracing the one—can they not be separated?" This means applying the hun to the po, using movement to guard stillness, using fire to press upon water, using two to guard one, and not allowing them to separate. It is like a person mounting a chariot and being carried upon it: the hun is at peace, the po is clear, fire does not scorch, and water does not overflow. This is truly the essential formula for long life and enduring vision.

"Profound vision" is the vision of the wondrous and the subtle. "The gates of Heaven" refer to the heart’s opening and closing, the heart’s movements and transformations.

"Thirty spokes share one hub—it is in their nothingness that the use of the chariot lies. Clay is shaped to form a vessel—it is in its nothingness that the use of the vessel lies. Doors and windows are cut to make a room—it is in their nothingness that the use of the room lies. Thus, being is for the sake of benefit, nothingness is for the sake of use."

Thirty spokes share one hub—it is where there is no hub that the use of the chariot lies. Clay is shaped to form a vessel—it is where there is no vessel that the use of the vessel lies. Doors and windows are cut to make a room—it is where there is no room that the use of the room lies. The reliance on nothingness is like this. Therefore, the principles of the world all have being for the sake of benefit and nothingness for the sake of use. Without being, nothingness has no benefit and the substance of use is lost. Without nothingness, use has no benefit and the mechanism of benefit is obstructed. Nothingness cannot exist without being, and being cannot exist without nothingness.

"The five colors blind the eyes. The five tones deafen the ears. The five flavors dull the palate. Racing and hunting madden the heart. Rare goods hinder conduct. Therefore, the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—thus he discards that and takes this."

The eyes are for seeing colors; the five colors dazzle the eyes and blind them. The ears are for discerning sounds; the five tones overwhelm the ears and deafen them. The mouth is for tasting flavors; the five flavors satiate the mouth and dull it. Hunting for amusement, racing without cease—these madden the heart. Goods are for practical use; coveting what is hard to obtain hinders conduct. Is this not the harm of greed? That which pursues externals without satiety is the eyes; that which is content within and easily satisfied is the belly. Therefore, the sage is for the belly’s easy satisfaction, not for the eyes’ insatiable desires—thus he discards external pursuit and takes internal contentment.

"Favor and disgrace are like surprise; value great trouble as you do your body. What does it mean, 'Favor and disgrace are like surprise'? Favor is inferior—gaining it is like surprise, losing it is like surprise. This is what is meant by 'favor and disgrace are like surprise.' What does it mean, 'Value great trouble as you do your body'? The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. When I no longer have a body, what trouble do I have? Therefore, one who values their body for the sake of the world can be entrusted with the world. One who cherishes their body for the sake of the world can be entrusted with the world."

The enlightened of old regarded favor and disgrace as equally surprising, valuing great trouble as they did their own bodies.

What does it mean, "Favor and disgrace are like surprise"? People invariably consider favor superior and disgrace inferior. If one knows that disgrace arises from favor and favor precedes disgrace, then favor is inherently inferior. Thus, gaining it is like surprise at the impending disgrace, and losing it is like surprise at the possibility of avoiding disgrace.

What does it mean, "Value great trouble as you do your body"? The reason I have great trouble is that I possess my own body. If I possess my body, love for it becomes excessive, and the gains and losses of the world all become troubles. If I can place my body after others and treat it as external, this is not possessing it. Not possessing it, life and death, honor and disgrace can be unified—what trouble remains? Extending this further, one who does not possess their body will not consider gaining the world as honor and thus values their body for the world. Such a person is truly one to whom the world can be entrusted. One who does not possess their body will not live for themselves but live for others, cherishing their body for the world. Such a person is truly one to whom the world can be entrusted.

Valuing is heaviness; difficulty is weight. Look for it and it cannot be seen—this is called "subtle." Listen for it and it cannot be heard—this is called "rare." Grasp for it and it cannot be held—this is called "minute." These three cannot be exhaustively questioned, so they merge into one. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Endless and unceasing, it cannot be named, returning again to nothingness. This is called the form without form, the image without thing—this is called "elusive and vague." Meet it and you cannot see its beginning; follow it and you cannot see its end. Hold fast to the ancient Dao to master today’s being. To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.

Look for it and it cannot be seen—thus it is named "subtle." Listen for it and it cannot be heard—thus it is named "rare." Grasp for it and it cannot be held—thus it is named "minute." These three names are all forced designations, for in truth they cannot be exhaustively questioned, so they merge into one. All things with form have brightness and darkness, but this has neither brightness above nor darkness below—no form to seek. Endless and unceasing, it passes and continues in daily use. Though it seems there is something to name, in truth it cannot be named, returning again to nothingness. This is called the form without form, the image without thing—this is called "elusive yet graspable as being, vague yet not graspable as nothingness." Seek it in advance and you cannot know whence it comes; pursue it afterward and you cannot know where it ends. Existing since antiquity, it is called the Dao. One who holds fast to the ancient Dao to master today’s affairs, though dwelling in the present, can know the beginning when there was nothing—this is called the lineage and essence of the Dao.

The entire passage extols the wonder of the Dao’s essence. The ancients who were good as scholars were subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—so deep they could not be known. Precisely because they could not be known, one can only forcefully describe their demeanor: hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter; cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides; solemn, as if a guest; melting, as if ice about to thaw; simple, as if uncarved wood; open, as if a valley; turbid, as if muddy water. Who can make the turbid clear through stillness? Gradually it becomes clear. Who can make the tranquil enduring through movement? Gradually it comes to life. Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness. Precisely because they are not full, they can remain worn yet not newly made.

The ancients who were good as scholars were subtle, wondrous, profound, and unfathomable.

Perfected is it—so deep it cannot be grasped or known. Precisely because it cannot be known, one can only forcefully describe its demeanor: hesitant, as if fording a river’s peril; cautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides; solemn, as if a guest without laxity; melting, as if ice dissolving without obstruction; simple, as if uncarved wood’s weightiness; open, as if a valley’s empty receptivity; turbid, as if muddy water’s obscurity. The bearing of great virtue is thus—so subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating that it ultimately cannot be grasped or known. How did the scholars of old attain this? Only by making the turbid clear through stillness, gradually; making the tranquil enduring through movement, gradually. Nowadays, people all clamor to be bright, thinking themselves clear—who can make the turbid still and slowly clarify? They all vie to be first, thinking themselves alive—who can remain tranquil, enduring, and not recklessly move, moving only to respond and gradually come to life?

Generally, those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness. When full, the heart is not empty, and the Dao cannot be preserved. Only by not being full can one remain at ease in weariness, not seeking renewal. Thus, in stillness, one gradually clarifies; in movement, one gradually comes to life. The realm of subtlety, wonder, and profound penetration may be aspired to and attained. To be worn yet not newly made is to be turbid; to remain tranquil and enduring is to be at peace. This fully expresses the marvel of great virtue and reveals the path to entering it.

Attain utmost emptiness; guard absolute stillness. As the myriad things arise together, I observe their return. Things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life’s mandate; returning to life’s mandate is called constancy. Knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune. Knowing constancy allows all-embracing capacity; capacity leads to impartiality; impartiality leads to kingship; kingship leads to Heaven; Heaven leads to the Dao; the Dao leads to enduring. One’s body will not be imperiled.

Attaining utmost emptiness, guarding absolute stillness—when the myriad things arise before me, I do not act with them but observe their return. The arising of the myriad things is profuse, yet I see their return: they do not appear profuse but each returns to its root. When things return to their root, nothing can disturb me—this is called stillness; this is called returning to life’s mandate. Life’s mandate is the natural state of my existence. Returning to this natural state, there is neither movement nor stillness—it is called constancy alone. Those who know constancy are not mere scholars of subtlety, wonder, and profound penetration; thus it is called illumination. Not knowing this constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune. Knowing constancy, good and evil are both forgotten—what cannot be embraced? With capacity, one universally covers all without partiality—what is not impartial? Impartiality allows one to be a ruler of the people and a king. Kingship is not yet the ultimate; it harmonizes with the Heaven that precedes the myriad things, the Dao that precedes Heaven. When humans unite with the Dao in body, they can endure, and their bodies will not be imperiled.

This exhaustively speaks of the efficacy of emptiness and stillness. The entry point lies in observing return—observing return is the "observing subtleties" of the first chapter.

The highest rulers—those below merely know they exist. The next are those the people draw near to and praise; the next are those they fear; the next are those they revile. When trust is insufficient, there is distrust. Hesitant, they value their words. When tasks are accomplished and affairs settled, the common people all say, "We are naturally so." [Some versions read: "The highest rulers—those below do not know they exist."]

The highest rulers in times of great governance—those below merely know they exist. The next are those the people draw near to and praise; the next are those they fear; the next are those they revile. Why does it descend to the point of revilement? Because the rulers’ trust is insufficient, so the people lack trust and come to revile them. When the people lack trust, what use are many words? Unlike the highest rulers, who are hesitant and value their words, not speaking lightly, the people receive their blessings in obscurity. When tasks are accomplished and affairs settled, the common people all say, "We are naturally so," unaware of who brought it about—thus, those below merely know they exist.

When the great Dao is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness appear; when great falsity arises, the six relations are not harmonious, and filial piety and compassion emerge; when the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.

When the great Dao prevails, the people do not know of benevolence and righteousness. When the great Dao is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness appear. When people originally forgot simplicity, those with wisdom emerged, priding themselves on their discernment—thus, people competed in cleverness, and great falsity arose. When the six relations were harmonious, filial piety and compassion were not conspicuous; people were all filial and compassionate. Only when harmony was lost did filial piety and compassion emerge. When the state was well-governed, loyal ministers were not seen; all ministers were loyal. Only when the state was in chaos did loyal ministers appear.

Cut off sageliness, abandon wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Cut off benevolence, abandon righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion. Cut off skill, abandon profit, and there will be no thieves. These three are insufficient as cultural adornments, so let them have something to belong to: manifest simplicity, embrace the uncarved, reduce self-interest, diminish desires.

When sageliness and wisdom are esteemed, people vie in cleverness and suffer from overwork—cut off sageliness, abandon wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold. When benevolence and righteousness are prized, people chase after names, and filial piety and compassion decline—cut off benevolence, abandon righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion. When skill is used to control, and profit is used to boast, people become greedy and deceitful, even turning to theft—cut off skill, abandon profit, and there will be no thieves. These three are mere cultural adornments, insufficient in themselves, so let them have something to belong to: manifest simplicity, embrace the uncarved, reduce self-interest, diminish desires to approach the governance of non-action.

This chapter closely corresponds to the previous one.

Abandon learning, and there will be no sorrow. Between "yes" and "alas," how much difference is there? Between good and evil, how much distance lies? What people fear cannot but be feared. Wild and boundless—it has not yet reached its end! The multitude are joyous, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending a terrace in spring. I alone am tranquil, without sign, like an infant who has not yet smiled; weary, as if with nowhere to return. The multitude all have more than enough, while I alone seem lacking. My heart is that of a foolish person—so muddled! The common people are bright; I alone am dim. The common people are sharp; I alone am dull. Vast, as if obscure; still, as if without abode. The multitude all have purpose; I alone am stubborn, like a rustic. I alone differ from others, valuing the nourishment of the Mother. [Jiao Shi says: "怕 is the ancient form of 泊, meaning stillness."]

When people abandon the learning of worldly names and forms, they have no sorrow from distinctions and calculations. Such as "yes" and "alas," "good" and "evil"—what the worldly learn is to differentiate these. From my perspective, between "yes" and "alas," how much difference is there?

Between good and evil, how great is the distance? Simply let it be—what need is there for learning, what need for sorrow? Yet what others fear, I too cannot but fear; I dare not treat it with neglect. However, following principle and observing measure, beyond this the heart holds no concern. How vast and boundless is this heart—its limits are nowhere to be found.

What others delight in, I have never indulged as pleasure. While the multitude revels, radiant as if feasting on grand sacrifices or ascending a terrace in spring, I alone remain still, without sign of desire, like an infant who has not yet smiled. Fear and joy alike cannot burden me; I only feel my heart drifting, as if with nowhere to return, unshackled from private attachments. The multitude all have more than enough, while I alone seem lacking, unclinging to possession. My heart is that of a foolish person—so muddled! The common people are bright, as if knowing; I alone am dim. The common people are sharp, intent on distinctions; I alone am dull. Vast, as if obscure; still, as if without abode. The multitude all have purpose; I alone am stubborn, like a rustic. In this state of carefree unconcern, how can I be thus?

While others rush to learning, I alone sever myself from it, returning to the origin of all things to nourish myself. The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao. The Dao as a thing is only vague and elusive: elusive, yet within it there are images; vague, yet within it there are forms. Profound, obscure—within it there is essence. Its essence is utterly real, within it there is trustworthiness. From ancient times to the present, its name has never departed, by which we may observe the origins of all things. How do I know the nature of these origins? By this.

The appearance of one of abundant virtue is to follow only the Dao. What is the wonder of the Dao’s essence? The Dao as a thing is only vague and elusive—it cannot be seen. Though unseen, within its elusiveness there are images, within its vagueness there are forms, within its profundity and obscurity there is essence. Its essence is utterly real and not false, within it there is trustworthiness that may be relied upon. This is the Dao. From ancient times to the present, its name has never departed, by which we may observe the origins of all things. How do I know that the origins of all things are observed through the Dao? Precisely because the Dao’s essence is vague, elusive, profound, and obscure—unchanging and indestructible—thus all things pass through transformation with it, while the Dao alone remains constant.

Wang Chunfu says: "阅 means to experience." All things under heaven, all that issues from the Dao, are included. Wang Fusi says: "阅 means that which emerges from the gate, each counted one by one. The Dao is like a gate—all things pass through it."

That which is bent becomes whole, that which is crooked becomes straight, that which is hollow becomes full, that which is worn becomes new, that which is little attains, that which is much confounds. Therefore the sage embraces the One and serves as the model for the world. He does not display himself, and so is enlightened; he does not assert himself, and so is distinguished; he does not boast of his achievements, and so has merit; he does not exalt himself, and so endures. It is only because he does not contend that no one in the world can contend with him. Is what the ancients called "that which is bent becomes whole" an empty saying? Truly, wholeness returns to it.

All things follow this principle: that which is bent may become whole, that which is crooked may become straight, that which is hollow may become full, that which is worn may become new, that which is little may attain, that which is much may be confounded. This is the unchanging pattern of growth and decline. Therefore the sage merely embraces the One and does not seek more, serving as the model for the world. He does not display his enlightenment, and so is enlightened; he does not assert himself to seek distinction, and so is distinguished; he does not boast of his achievements, and so has merit; he does not exalt himself, and so endures. This is the way of non-contention. Only because he does not contend does no one in the world contend with him. If one were to say there is still contention with him, how could the ancients’ saying that "that which is bent becomes whole" be an empty word? The trouble lies only in one’s inability to bend. If one bends, truly wholeness returns to it—the principle of things cannot be denied.

Few words are natural. A whirlwind does not last the morning; a sudden rain does not last the day. Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth. If even Heaven and Earth cannot make them last, how much less can man? Therefore, those who act in accordance with the Dao become one with the Dao; those who act in accordance with virtue become one with virtue; those who act in accordance with loss become one with loss. One who is one with the Dao, the Dao also delights in attaining; one who is one with virtue, virtue also delights in attaining; one who is one with loss, loss also delights in attaining. When trust is insufficient, there is distrust.

If one speaks rarely, following nature without concern, this is sufficient. A whirlwind does not last the morning; a sudden rain does not last the day—who brings these about? Heaven and Earth. If even Heaven and Earth cannot make such things last long, how much more difficult is it for man to contend with others through his own cunning and intelligence? Therefore, those who act in accordance with the Dao do not do so: when they encounter the Dao, they forget it in the Dao; when they encounter virtue, they forget it in virtue; when they encounter loss, they forget it in loss. It is merely a matter of few words, of following nature. One who is one with the Dao, the Dao delights in attaining; one who is one with virtue, virtue delights in attaining; one who is one with loss, loss delights in attaining. It is because all people, wise and foolish alike, live in harmony with it that this trust exists. If trust were insufficient, no matter how many words one used to contend, there would still be distrust. How greatly to be valued is the sufficiency of few words and naturalness!

One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm; one who takes long strides does not walk far. One who displays himself is not enlightened; one who asserts himself is not distinguished; one who boasts of his achievements has no merit; one who exalts himself does not endure. In the Dao, these are called "excess food and redundant conduct"—things that others may detest. Therefore, one who has the Dao does not dwell in them.

One who stands on tiptoe to be taller cannot stand firm; one who takes long strides to walk faster cannot walk far. Those in the world who display themselves to seek enlightenment, assert themselves to seek distinction, boast of their achievements, or exalt themselves—how are they different? In the Dao, these are like leftover food or redundant conduct—things that others may detest. Therefore, one who has the Dao does not dwell in them. *Jiao Shi says: "行 in 赘行 should be 形, as the ancient characters are interchangeable."*

There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth. Silent, empty, it stands alone and does not change, it moves in cycles and does not weary. It may be considered the mother of all under Heaven. I do not know its name; I style it "Dao"; forced to give it a name, I call it "great." Great means it flows ever onward; flowing ever onward means it is far-reaching; far-reaching means it returns. Therefore the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them. Man models himself on Earth; Earth models itself on Heaven; Heaven models itself on the Dao; the Dao models itself on nature.

There is a thing born before Heaven and Earth, yet we know not whence it first arose. As a thing, it is silent and empty, standing alone without peer, enduring through ancient and modern times without change, circulating through the ten thousand beings without ever wearying. The ten thousand things arise from it without exception—it may be called the mother of all under Heaven. I do not know its name; I style it "Dao"; forced to give it a name, I call it merely "great." Its greatness lies in transforming without possessing—this may also be called "flowing onward." Its flowing onward is all-encompassing without boundary—this may also be called "far-reaching." In a single thought, seeking it, one finds it—this may also be called "returning." Flowing onward, far-reaching, returning—these together complete its greatness.

Thus the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them. Should one not reflect on how to preserve this greatness? To preserve it, one must model oneself on Earth’s capacity to bear all without exception. Beyond Earth is Heaven—one must model oneself on Heaven’s capacity to cover all without exception. That which gives birth to Heaven and Earth is the Dao—one must model oneself on the Dao’s capacity to give birth to all, to bring all to completion without exception. The Dao is fundamentally nature; to model oneself on the Dao is merely to model oneself on its naturalness. The last four sentences speak from a human perspective; if one clings to their wording, they become difficult to comprehend.

The heavy is the root of the light; stillness is the lord of restlessness. Therefore the sage, though traveling all day, does not part from the baggage train. Though dwelling in splendor, he remains detached. How could a lord of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly before the world? To be light is to lose one’s root; to be restless is to lose one’s lordship.

In all things, the heavy commonly supports the light—thus the heavy is the root of the light. The still commonly governs the restless—thus stillness is the lord of restlessness. Therefore the sage, traveling all day, does not part from the baggage train, holding fast to the heavy to avoid losing the light. Though dwelling in splendor, he remains detached within it, holding fast to stillness to avoid losing his lordship. How could one who rules ten thousand chariots gallop recklessly through the world’s trifles? To be light is to lose what makes one a root and have nothing to rely upon. To be restless is to lose what makes one a lord and have nothing to govern.

The baggage train serves as a metaphor for not straying from one’s foundation; "splendor" refers to palaces, terraces, and pavilions—metaphors for positions of honor.

The good traveler leaves no tracks; the good speaker leaves no flaws; the good reckoner needs no counting rods; the good locker needs no bolt yet cannot be opened; the good binder needs no rope yet cannot be untied. Thus the sage is always good at saving people, and so leaves no one behind; always good at saving things, and so leaves nothing behind. This is called inheriting enlightenment.

Therefore the good person is the teacher of the not-good; the not-good person is the resource of the good. If one does not value one’s teacher or cherish one’s resource, though wise, one is greatly deluded. This is called the essential subtlety.

The good traveler leaves no tracks because they travel as they ought. The good speaker leaves no flaws because they speak as they ought. The good reckoner needs no counting rods because their reasoning must reach its mark. The good locker needs no bolt yet cannot be opened because they grasp the essential. The good binder needs no rope yet cannot be untied because all share the same desire.

The sage possesses these virtues and thus always governs people by means of people. This is the goodness of saving people, so each person finds their place and none are abandoned. The sage always entrusts things to things. This is the goodness of saving things, so each thing fulfills its nature and none are discarded. This is called skillfully employing one’s enlightenment to govern people and things.

All people under Heaven, whether good or not, are encompassed within this. The good person is the teacher of the not-good; the not-good person is the resource of the good. Knowing them as teachers, one values them; knowing them as resources, one cherishes them. Thus in dealing with the good and the not-good, each finds their proper place. This is what it means to save people without abandoning anyone.

If one does not value one’s teacher or cherish one’s resource, though one may consider oneself wise, one is in fact greatly deluded. This teacher and resource—between them lies the essential subtlety of saving people, which depends on skillful use.

"Inheriting enlightenment" means to transmit and apply one’s own enlightenment to people and things.

One interpretation likens it to the "enveloping" of a robe—using one’s enlightenment with subtle density. "Knowing the male but guarding the female, one becomes the world’s valley-stream." As the world’s valley-stream, constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of an infant. "Knowing the white but guarding the black, one becomes the world’s model." As the world’s model, constant virtue knows no flaw, returning to the formless limit. "Knowing glory but guarding disgrace, one becomes the world’s valley." As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fully realized, returning to uncarved simplicity.

When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; the sage employs it to become the leader of officials. Thus, great governance does not sever. Though one may know the male and employ its strength, one guards the female and takes softness as primary—placing oneself in lowliness to become the world’s valley-stream. As the world’s valley-stream, constant virtue embraces and does not depart, returning to the selfless state of an infant. Though one may know the white and employ brightness, one guards the black and takes obscurity as primary—constantly humbling oneself to become the world’s model. As the world’s model, constant virtue knows no flaw, returning to the formless limit. Though one may know glory and exalt oneself, one guards disgrace and takes retreat as primary—containing impurity to become the world’s valley. As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fully realized, returning to undifferentiated simplicity.

Simplicity cannot be named as a single vessel; when it scatters, it becomes vessels, each merely the guardian of one office. The sage employs it so that vessels revert to simplicity, not serving as officials but as the leader of officials. Thus, governing the world with the great Dao does not involve the petty art of cutting and dividing.

The character *shi* (式) has been variously interpreted; in my humble opinion, since *xi* (溪, valley-stream) and *gu* (谷, valley) are borrowed usages, *shi* likely refers to the crossbar of a chariot—a device for measuring time, also called *shi*. Just as one aligns oneself to it without intent, so too does the sage act.

Those who seek to take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel and cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Thus, things may proceed or follow, exhale warmth or blow cold, be strong or weak, bear or destroy. Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extremity.

Those who seek to take the world through action or control—I see they will not attain it. Why? The world is originally a weighty vessel of spiritual power and cannot be forcibly shaped by one person’s private wisdom. Those who act upon it will ruin it; those who grasp it will lose it. Thus, among the world’s things, some advance while others follow, some exhale warmth while others blow cold, some are strong and competitive while others are weak and self-preserving, some bear and complete while others collapse and destroy. Their natures differ, and their choices vary; to impose one will upon them is difficult. Therefore, the sage follows their natural course without imposing intent, merely removing excess, extravagance, and extremity—nothing more. Why must there be further action?

Those who assist a ruler with the Dao do not use military force to dominate the world, for such affairs rebound. Where armies march, brambles grow; after great wars, years of famine follow. The good warrior achieves results but does not dare to seize strength. Achieve results but do not boast; achieve results but do not vaunt; achieve results but do not be arrogant; achieve results out of necessity; achieve results but do not force it. Things in their prime inevitably age—this is called "not following the Dao." Those who do not follow the Dao perish early.

Those who assist a ruler with the Dao do not use military force to dominate the world, for warfare tends to rebound. Where armies camp, brambles grow; after great wars, years of famine follow. The harm of warfare is thus—how can it be used to assist a ruler in dominating the world? What is called "skillful use of arms" lies in decisive action alone, not daring to seize strength. How does one achieve results? Achieve results without boasting; achieve results without vaunting; achieve results without arrogance; achieve results out of necessity; achieve results without forcing it. The principle of fullness and emptiness in the world is that all things in their prime inevitably age. Using arms to seize strength is called "relying on prime and not following the Dao." Those who do not follow the Dao perish early—how can they remain strong for long?

Master Jiao said: "Acting out of necessity is difficult." The five instances of *er* (而, "but") following "achieve results" should be read as *yu* (于, "in"). Others may achieve results there, but I alone achieve results here.

Fine weapons are inauspicious tools; some detest them, so those with the Dao do not dwell with them. The noble person values the left in residence but the right in warfare. Weapons are inauspicious tools, not the tools of the noble person. When used out of necessity, tranquility is paramount. Victory is not glorified; those who glorify it delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their aims in the world. Auspicious affairs value the left; inauspicious affairs value the right. The deputy general stands on the left; the supreme general stands on the right—this is to treat it as a funeral rite. When many are killed, one weeps with sorrow; when victorious, one treats it with funeral rites.

Fine weapons are inauspicious tools; some detest them, so those with the Dao do not engage in such affairs. The noble person values the left in residence but the right in warfare, contrary to the noble person’s Dao. Thus, weapons are inauspicious tools, not the tools of the noble person. When used out of necessity, tranquility is paramount. In victory, one does not glorify it; to glorify victory is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their aims in the world. Auspicious affairs value the left; inauspicious affairs value the right—this is the established ritual. The deputy general stands on the left; the supreme general stands on the right—this is to treat it as a funeral rite. How grave is the inauspiciousness of warfare! When many enemies are killed, one weeps with sorrow; when victorious, one treats it with funeral rites. How grave is the lack of glory in victory and the lack of joy in killing! Tranquility means calm and quiet.

The Dao is eternally nameless. Though simplicity is small, the world does not dare to treat it as a subject. If lords and kings can guard it, the myriad things will naturally submit. Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew; people do not command it, yet it distributes evenly. The beginning of governance involves names; once names exist, one must also know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like rivers and valleys flowing into the Yangtze and sea.

The Dao takes namelessness as its constant, and can only be called "uncut wood" (朴). This uncut wood is level, rare, subtle, and minute—one might call it small. Yet though small, the myriad things all arise from it, all emerge from it. What does it not govern? How could the world dare to treat it as a subject? If lords and kings can guard it, the myriad things will naturally submit. The harmony of qi brings it about that heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew; the abundance of their virtue ensures that people do not wait for commands but distribute evenly. Such is the effect of guarding the uncut wood.

For lords and kings to guard the uncut wood is simply to guard that which is eternally nameless. Only then can one establish names. Ritual, music, governance, and punishment all arise from this. Yet one must not pursue the branches and forget the root. Once names exist, one must also know when to stop and not exceed. Seek no excess. Simply return to the nameless uncut wood to stabilize it. Knowing when to stop in this way is how one avoids peril and danger.

Why is this so? The Dao’s presence in the world is like rivers and valleys flowing into the Yangtze and sea. Rivers and valleys take the Yangtze and sea as their destination; the world takes the Dao as its destination. The only fear is that rulers may not know to guard this uncut wood.

He who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened.
He who conquers others has force; he who conquers himself is strong.
He who is content is rich; he who acts with vigor has will.
He who does not lose his place endures; he who dies yet does not perish lives long.

To know the right and wrong of others is called wisdom; to know one’s own gains and losses is called enlightenment.
To overcome others is called force; to overcome one’s private desires is called strength.
To be content and seek nothing is called wealth; to practice the Dao without ceasing is called will.
Amid endless transformations, to know one’s place and not be changed by them is called endurance.
The change between life and death is vast, yet he who does not perish even in death is called long-lived.

Wisdom and enlightenment, force and strength, are spoken of in contrast between inner and outer.
Wealth and will are spoken of in contrast between action and knowing when to stop.
Endurance and long life are spoken of in contrast between not changing in life and not perishing in death.
Not losing one’s place, not perishing in death—all are effects of guarding the constant Dao.

The great Dao flows everywhere; it can be to the left or right.
The myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse. Its work is accomplished, yet it does not claim credit.
It nurtures the myriad things yet does not act as their master. Always desireless, it may be called small.
The myriad things return to it yet do not know their master; it may be called great.
Thus the sage never acts as great, and so accomplishes greatness.

The essence of the great Dao is that it flows everywhere, able to be to the left or right. If one grasps for it as one, it cannot be obtained. The myriad things rely on it to live, yet it never refuses. Once the work of giving life is done, it does not name itself as having done so. It nurtures the myriad things yet does not act as their master. In its constant desirelessness, its rarity and formlessness, it may be called small. Yet the myriad things return to it without knowing their master; in its capacity to contain all without limit, it may be called great. The wonder of the Dao’s essence is like this. Thus the sage who embodies the Dao never considers himself great, and so accomplishes greatness.

The great image draws the world to it; they come without harm, at peace and secure.
Music and bait may make travelers stop, but when the music ends and the bait is gone, they depart.
The Dao’s utterance is bland, seemingly without flavor. Looking, one finds it insufficient to see; listening, one finds it insufficient to hear. Yet in use, it cannot be exhausted.

To hold the great image and govern the world is to have the world all come to you. The world comes, yet you have done nothing to harm them, so all who come are at peace, secure, and content. Such is the function of the great Dao. As for making music and setting out bait to await visitors, travelers may stop, but when the music ends and the bait is gone, they will leave. The Dao’s utterance is bland, seemingly without flavor. Looking, one finds it insufficient to see; listening, one finds it insufficient to hear. Yet when used, it cannot be exhausted. How can it compare to music and bait?

Lu Xisheng said: "The great image is the Dao." Su Ziyou said: "The Dao is neither being nor non-being, hence it is called the great image." Music and bait are metaphors for petty favors that please things.

If you wish to contract it, you must first expand it.
If you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it.
If you wish to abolish it, you must first raise it.
If you wish to take it, you must first give it.
This is called subtle clarity.
The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong.
Fish cannot leave the depths; the state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others.

The waxing and waning of heaven’s Dao, the rise and fall of human affairs—all have their inevitable tendencies. If you wish to contract it, it must first have been expanded. If you wish to weaken it, it must first have been strengthened. If you wish to abolish it, it must first have been raised. If you wish to take it, it must first have been given. This principle is extremely subtle, yet truly clear—hence it is called subtle clarity. In general, the soft can overcome the hard, and the weak can overcome the strong. This principle can be used for self-cultivation or self-preservation—it is like a fish’s deep abyss. This principle can also be used to manage calamities or become a calamity—it is like the state’s sharp instruments. Fish cannot leave the depths; if they leave, they become prey. The state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others; if shown, they may be stolen and cause immeasurable harm.

The Dao is eternally non-action, yet there is nothing it does not do.
If lords and kings can guard it, the myriad things will transform themselves.
If, in their transformation, desires arise, I will stabilize them with nameless uncut wood.
The nameless uncut wood will also have no desires. Without desires, through tranquility, the world will right itself.

The essence of the Dao is fundamentally non-being, yet in application, it is being. Thus it is eternally non-action, yet there is nothing it does not do. If lords and kings can guard this Dao, in governing the world they too will act through non-action. The myriad things will transform and submit to this governance of non-action. Once transformed, if desires arise to generate cleverness, I will stabilize them with nameless uncut wood. Moreover, this nameless uncut wood will also have no desires. Reaching this point in guarding the Dao, one can be said to have no desires at all and truly be tranquil. How could the world not return to desirelessness and right itself?

The *Laozi Shuo Lue*, Scroll II
By Zhang Erqi of Jiyang

---

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it lacks virtue.
The highest virtue practices non-action and does not act for any purpose.
The lesser virtue acts and acts for a purpose.
The highest benevolence acts yet does not act for any purpose.
The highest righteousness acts and acts for a purpose.
The highest propriety acts, yet when none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises.
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises.
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao, the origin of folly.
Therefore, the great man abides in substance, not in superficiality;
in reality, not in ornament.
Thus, he discards the latter and embraces the former.

The highest virtue does not claim possession of virtue—thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue strives to hold fast and not lose its virtue—thus its virtue is incomplete and lacks true virtue.
The difference in their inner essence is as follows:

The highest virtue does nothing, not because it deliberately refrains from action,
but because it follows the natural course of virtue, with nothing left undone and no need for action.
The lesser virtue, however, must act—
deliberating before achieving, striving before accomplishing.
It cannot but proceed through action.
Their manifestations differ in this way.

Virtue is the name for the Dao embodied in a person.
As for those whose virtue is partial and renowned, there is the highest benevolence,
the highest righteousness,
and the highest propriety.

The highest benevolence serves its master through love and cannot remain without action. Yet when it acts, it arises from the heart’s spontaneous impulse—truly, it does not act through deliberate effort. The highest righteousness serves its master through appropriateness and cannot remain without action. When it acts because it deems something appropriate, this is action with a purpose.

The highest propriety adorns emotions with ritual forms. When emotions accumulate within, propriety is used to express them. Yet the elaborate details of ritual are not what the multitude can necessarily follow. When one performs ritual and none respond, one may raise an arm and force compliance—this is not merely action but compulsion. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, propriety follows. All descend from the Dao through five stages before reaching propriety.

Propriety is formality. When formality prevails, emotion declines. Propriety is deference. When deference meets no response, strife arises. Is propriety not the thinning of loyalty and trust, the harbinger of chaos? Those who claim foresight shine with external brilliance, boasting outwardly while neglecting what lies within. Excessive scrutiny exhausts the mind; excessive cleverness breeds confusion. Is foresight not the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly? Thinness gives rise to chaos; superficiality leads to foolishness. Therefore, the great person dwells in thickness, not thinness; abides in substance, not superficiality—thus rejecting external wisdom and propriety in favor of the Dao and virtue.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
Spirits attained the One and became numinous;
Valleys attained the One and became full;
The myriad things attained the One and came to life;
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world.
Their attainment was one and the same.

If heaven had nothing to make it clear, it would fear splitting;
If earth had nothing to make it tranquil, it would fear erupting;
If spirits had nothing to make them numinous, they would fear fading;
If valleys had nothing to make them full, they would fear drying;
If the myriad things had nothing to make them live, they would fear perishing;
If lords and kings had nothing to make them the standard and esteemed their high position, they would fear toppling.
Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root; the high takes the low as its foundation. Therefore, lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy." Is this not taking the humble as their root? Is it not so?

Thus, accumulating many humble parts makes something noble, just as assembling wheels, shafts, axles, and a canopy makes a carriage. Without the humble, there is no nobility. If one seeks to accumulate many carriages, there will be no carriages. Lords and kings must forget their nobility, forget their loftiness, only then can they become the standard for the world. Do not desire to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone—excessive distinction is unnecessary.

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
Spirits attained the One and became numinous;
Valleys attained the One and became full;
The myriad things attained the One and came to life;
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world.
Though heaven and earth, things and people differ, their need to attain this One is the same.

If heaven had nothing to make it clear, it would fear splitting;
If earth had nothing to make it tranquil, it would fear erupting;
If spirits had nothing to make them numinous, they would fear fading;
If valleys had nothing to make them full, they would fear drying;
If the myriad things had nothing to make them live, they would fear perishing;
If lords and kings had nothing to make them the standard and merely occupied positions of high nobility, they would fear toppling—how grave this is! The One cannot but be attained.

How do lords and kings attain the One? It is simply by not esteeming themselves, not exalting themselves. The noble takes the humble as its root; the high takes the low as its foundation. How can one esteem or exalt oneself? Therefore, lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy," using humble terms to name themselves. Is this not refusing to esteem themselves and taking the humble as their root? Is it not so?

The power of the world arises from uniting many humble parts to form nobility, just as a carriage is formed by assembling wheels, shafts, axles, and a canopy. Without the humble, there is no nobility. If one seeks to accumulate many carriages, there will be no carriages. Lords and kings must forget their nobility, forget their loftiness, only then can they become the standard for the world. Do not desire to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone—excessive distinction is unnecessary.

Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao. The things of the world are born from being; being is born from non-being. When people do not outwardly chase but inwardly return, they enter the beginning of the Dao. Reversion is the movement of the Dao. Those who possess the Dao do not compete with things but naturally abide in weakness. Weakness is the function of the Dao. Why is this so? Because all things in the world are born from being, and being is born from non-being. Non-being is the natural state of the Dao. Reversion means abandoning being and tending toward non-being. Moving from being toward non-being is called the movement of the Dao. When one becomes one with the Dao, even stillness cannot be named—how much less movement? Weakness means being without departing from non-being. Not departing from non-being is called the function of the Dao. If one investigates its essence, it is also nothingness alone.

The highest scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.
The middling scholar, hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt.
The lowest scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs loudly at it.
If it is not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.
Therefore, the established sayings state:
The bright Dao seems dim;
The advancing Dao seems to retreat;
The level Dao seems uneven;
The highest virtue seems like a valley;
Great whiteness seems sullied;
Abundant virtue seems insufficient;
Established virtue seems lax;
True substance seems to change;
Great squares have no corners;
Great vessels are late in completion;
Great music has a faint sound;
Great images have no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Yet only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.

The highest scholar, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.
The middling scholar, hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt and cannot necessarily practice it.
The lowest scholar, hearing the Dao, laughs loudly at it.
If it is not laughed at by the lowest scholar, it would not be the Dao. Why is this so? The ancients who established sayings said:
Those who clarify the Dao do so by clarifying themselves alone, not competing with the world—thus, the bright Dao seems dim.
Those who advance the Dao do so by advancing themselves alone, not competing with the world—thus, the advancing Dao seems to retreat.
Those who level the Dao are at peace with all things in the world. Though not what others can attain, they appear similar to others.
The highest virtue does not claim possession of virtue—thus, it is lowly like a valley.
Great whiteness does not depart from defilement to be white—thus, it seems sullied by the dust.
Abundant virtue does not consider itself abundant—thus, it always seems insufficient.
Established virtue is diligent in cultivating its nature and simple in its interactions with things—thus, it appears careless and lax.
True substance follows nature and wanders without attachment—thus, it appears inconstant and changing.
Great squares are inwardly upright and conduct themselves without ostentation—thus, they show no corners.
Great vessels are late in completion—their completion cannot be hastened.
Great music has a faint sound—its sound cannot be heard.
Great images have no form—their form cannot be contained.
This is beyond the calculations of middling and lowly people—how could they not ridicule it?

The essence of the Dao is hidden and difficult to see, without anything to name it. When it manifests in things, only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing all things. Though all things receive its gifts, they do not know it—it is fitting that the lowest scholars laugh at it.

The Dao gives birth to the One;
The One gives birth to the Two;
The Two give birth to the Three;
The Three give birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang;
The qi of the void harmonizes them.

What people dislike are "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy," yet kings and lords use these as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet benefit, or benefited yet diminish. What people teach, I also teach: "The strong and overbearing do not meet their natural end." I will take this as the father of my teaching.

The Dao gives birth to the One;
The One gives birth to the Two—this is the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The Two give birth to the Three;
The Three give birth to the myriad things—this is the named mother of the myriad things.
The myriad things all bear yin and embrace yang;
The qi of the void harmonizes them.
Who is it, if not the Dao, that gives them birth and brings them to completion?

What people dislike are "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy," yet those who devise names make kings and lords use these as their titles, wishing them to remain noble without forgetting their lowliness, exalted without forgetting their humility. Thus, things may be diminished yet benefit, or benefited yet diminish—this is what humility and fullness bring upon themselves. What the ancients taught, I also take as my teaching: "The strong and overbearing do not meet their natural end." Are these not those who, seeking to benefit themselves, instead bring great harm? I will take this saying as the foundation of my teaching.

In this chapter, the phrase "the qi of the void harmonizes them" seems to follow the idea of "bestowing and completing," yet the meaning below does not connect—perhaps there is a textual error, but it is impossible to know. Commentators all force interpretations.

The Dao refers to the Principle; the One refers to qi; the Two refers to yin and yang; the Three refers to yin, yang, and the qi where they converge—this is the "qi of the void" mentioned below. "The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang; the qi of the void harmonizes them" further explains how the Three give birth to the myriad things. This discussion of "giving birth to the One" and "giving birth to the Two" differs from that of the Confucians. Only Li Xizhai’s commentary on this chapter is somewhat clear and worth savoring.

The softest in the world gallops through the hardest;
Nothing enters where there is no space.
I thereby know the benefit of non-action.
The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain them.

Only the softest in the world can gallop through the hardest and command it. Only nothingness can enter where there is no space and reach everywhere. I thereby know the benefit of non-action. Non-action is what is called the softest, nothingness—what can it not gallop through? What can it not enter? Yet the teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain them. This is a lament for their rarity.

Which is dearer, fame or life?
Which is greater, life or wealth?
Which is more harmful, gain or loss?
Thus, excessive love incurs great cost;
Hoarding much invites heavy loss.
Know contentment and avoid disgrace;
Know restraint and avoid danger—
Thus can one endure long.

Those who pursue fame know fame but not life—do they consider which is dearer, fame or life? Those who covet wealth know wealth but not life—do they consider which is greater, life or wealth? Those who pursue fame and covet wealth know only gain and not loss—do they consider which is more harmful, gain or loss? Thus, those who love excessively will strive and incur great cost; those who hoard much will be plundered and suffer heavy loss. Only then do they realize that fame is a burden to life, and wealth is a thief to life—that gain is a greater harm than loss. As for the noble person, knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing restraint avoids danger—thus can one endure long.

The greatest perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible;
The greatest fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless.
The greatest straightness seems bent;
The greatest skill seems clumsy;
The greatest eloquence seems inarticulate.
Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.
Purity and stillness set the world right.

Those who achieve great perfection in virtue do not perceive their own perfection and always see themselves as flawed—thus their use is inexhaustible. Those of great talent and full capacity do not consider themselves full and always see themselves as empty—thus their use is boundless. Those who act with great straightness follow principle and do not contend with things—thus they seem bent. Those of great skill act without contrivance and do not engage in carving or polishing—thus they seem clumsy. Those of great eloquence rely on inherent principle and do not argue with words—thus they seem inarticulate. This is the virtue of purity and stillness. Now, the qi of cold and heat are unavoidable for embodied beings, yet restlessness can overcome cold, and stillness can overcome heat—so internally overcoming the external, how could one who embodies purity and stillness not be taken as the world’s standard?

When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields;
When the world loses the Dao, cavalry horses breed in the suburbs.
No crime is greater than indulging desires;
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment;
No fault is greater than coveting gain.
Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is always contentment.

When the world follows the Dao, there is nothing to contend over, and warhorses are retired to fertilize fields. When the world loses the Dao, strife arises daily, and cavalry horses breed in the suburbs. Why is this? No crime is greater than indulging desires—indulging desires and displaying them to others invites theft. No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment—not knowing contentment and seeking more is the root of chaos. No fault is greater than coveting gain—coveting others’ possessions is where great evil converges. Even a commoner who harbors these faults will suffer them; how much more so for lords and kings who do so—hence cavalry horses breed in the suburbs. Thus, if one knows the sufficiency of one’s portion and is content, there will be no lack. Without lack, there will be no contention.

Without stepping outside, one knows the world;
Without looking through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus, the sage knows without traveling,
Names without seeing,
Achieves without acting.

Without stepping outside, one can know the world—the world as world does not require stepping outside to be known. Without looking through the window, one can see the Way of Heaven—the Way of Heaven as the Way of Heaven does not require looking through the window to be seen. If one does not understand the world and the Way of Heaven as they are and seeks them externally, stepping outside to know—how much can one know? Looking through the window to see—how much can one see? Even if one exhausts all one knows and sees in seeking them, the farther one goes, the less one knows. Thus, the sage’s knowledge of the world does not come from seeking in the world; the sage’s vision of the Way of Heaven does not arise from seeing the Way of Heaven. Knowledge does not lie outside; vision does not lie outside—thus one does not need to travel to know, does not need to see to name. Moreover, one need not act to achieve—such is the sage’s embodiment of the Dao’s function, its ultimate expression.

To learn is to increase daily;
To practice the Dao is to decrease daily.
Decrease and further decrease,
Until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
Thus, to govern the world, one always does so without interference;
When there is interference, it is insufficient to govern the world.

Those who learn seek knowledge and thus desire daily increase. Those who practice the Dao return to the root and thus desire daily decrease. To decrease is to eliminate desires and forget principles, decreasing further until one reaches a state of non-action. When practicing the Dao reaches non-action, one can entrust things to their own nature, respond without fixed direction, and leave nothing undone. Thus, the ancient sages who governed the world and transformed it set it right by always doing so without interference. When there is interference, the doer will fail, and the holder will lose—how can this suffice to govern the world?

Non-interference is non-action. As the *Kaiyuan Commentary* states, it is like embracing transformation. The sage has no constant mind but takes the minds of the people as his own. Those who are good, I treat with goodness; those who are not good, I also treat with goodness—thus virtue is perfected in goodness. Those who are trustworthy, I trust; those who are untrustworthy, I also trust—thus virtue is perfected in trust. The sage, dwelling in the world, is ever vigilant, blending his heart with the world. The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.

The sage has no constant mind but only takes the minds of the people as his own. The people all desire their ruler to approve of their goodness and trust their sincerity. The sage, toward those among the people who are good, treats them with goodness; even toward those who are not good, he also treats them with goodness—thus his virtue is complete in goodness. Toward those among the people who are trustworthy, he responds with trust; even toward those who are untrustworthy, he also responds with trust—thus his virtue is complete in trust. The sage, dwelling in the world, is ever vigilant, fearing that the world may forget goodness and abandon trust. Therefore, he blends his heart with the world, regarding all equally without distinction. The people, meanwhile, fix their ears and eyes upon one another, observing and judging, each with their own right and wrong. The sage treats them all as children—seeing their right, he does not rejoice; seeing their wrong, he does not anger. Such is the sage’s taking the minds of the people as his own.

*Vigilant* means fearful. "Emerging into life, entering death: those who belong to life are thirteen; those who belong to death are thirteen; and those whose lives lead them to the realm of death are also thirteen. Why is this? Because they overindulge in the pursuit of life." It is said that those who skillfully nurture life do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers when traveling on land, nor do they avoid weapons when entering battle. The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn; the tiger finds nowhere to place its claws; weapons find nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they are without the realm of death. Of all transformations in the myriad things, none is greater than...

If life and death are but emergent phenomena—emerging into life, then entering death—then, by rough calculation, among the people of this world, those who should attain life and thus belong to the living are but three in ten; those who should meet death and thus belong to the dead are but three in ten; and those who, while believing themselves alive, in truth move ever toward the realm of death are also three in ten. Why, when they take life as their aim, do they instead hasten toward death? Because they overindulge in the pursuit of life. The more lavishly they cherish life, the more urgently they rush toward death. Thus it is said: they seek life yet arrive at death. In sum, none of these are those who skillfully nurture life. It is said that those who skillfully nurture life do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers when traveling on land, nor do they avoid weapons when entering battle. The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn; the tiger finds nowhere to place its claws; weapons find nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they are without the realm of death. That which is called the realm of death is the body itself. Only when one does not cling to the body, regarding life as but a temporary lodging and not cherishing it, can one be said to be without love for life—who then could bring about one’s death? Such is the one who skillfully nurtures life.

Most commentaries interpret "emerging" as manifesting from non-being into being, and "entering" as returning from being to non-being. To be "without the realm of death" means that the original nature remains eternally present. The Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them; things take form, and circumstances bring them to completion. Thus, the myriad things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor are not conferred by any decree but are ever spontaneously so. Therefore, the Dao gives them life, nurtures them, rears them, fosters them, ripens them, nourishes them, and shelters them. It brings them to life yet does not claim possession; it acts yet does not rely on its acts; it leads yet does not dominate. This is called profound virtue.

That which stands before all things is the Dao. It is the origin of the myriad things. Thus, all things are born of the Dao. When the Dao operates, it becomes virtue—this is the qi of yin and yang. It is the source upon which all existence depends. Thus, all things are nurtured by virtue. When qi gathers, things come into being, and only then do forms become visible. Therefore, things give form to it. Once things take form, their forms interact with the forms of other things, engaging and contending to create circumstances, and only then are the substance and function of things complete. Thus, circumstances bring them to completion. The forms of things are but the manifestations of what the Dao has given life to and virtue has nurtured. The completion of circumstances is but the fulfillment of what the Dao has given life to and virtue has nurtured. Therefore, the myriad things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue—how could these depend on anything external? They are inherently and eternally so of themselves. Thus, the Dao endlessly gives life to things and nurtures them, and further rears them, fosters them, ripens them, nourishes them, and shelters them. Its merit in relation to things is thus, yet all occurs spontaneously. It gives life yet does not claim possession; it acts yet does not rely on its acts; it leads yet does not dominate. How could this be named or fathomed?

The world has a beginning, which may be taken as the mother of the world. Once one has attained the mother, one may thereby know her children. Once one knows the children, one must return to abide by the mother. Thus, one may endure to the end without peril. Block its openings, shut its doors, and to the end of life one will not toil. Open its openings, meddle in its affairs, and to the end of life one will not be saved. To perceive the small is called clarity; to abide in softness is called strength. Use its light, return to its clarity, and leave no disaster for the self. This is called practicing the constant.

The world has a beginning, which may be taken as the mother of the world—this is what one must embody and attain. Once one has attained the mother, one may thereby know her children, and nothing will remain unexamined or unaccomplished. Yet one must not pursue the branches while forgetting the root. Once one knows the children, one must return to abide by the mother. Only then can one endure to the end without peril. How does one abide by the mother? By blocking its openings and shutting its doors, so that to the end of life one labors not, yet merit is spontaneously achieved. Otherwise, if one opens its openings to seek accomplishment in affairs, one will remain in peril to the end of life, with no salvation. Can one fail to return and abide by the mother?

That which is seen yet cannot be seen is called the small. To perceive this unseen is called clarity. That which is guarded yet has nothing to guard is called softness. To guard this unguardable is called strength. Use the light that is outwardly manifest, then withdraw it and return to the inherent clarity of the root. Do not let it stray outward without return, lest disaster befall the self. This is called practicing the constant Way and merging with it as one.

All this speaks of embodying the Dao. The terms "beginning" and "mother" both refer to the Dao; "children" refers to the myriad things. To know the small and guard the soft is to abide by the mother. "Small" and "soft" echo the earlier chapter’s words on the subtle and imperceptible, the language of the Dao’s mystery. "Practicing" (袭) is like the *Zhongyong*’s "inheriting the earth and water" (下袭水土).

Were I to possess even a little knowledge, in walking the great Way I would fear only deviation. The great Way is very level, yet the people prefer byways. The court is excessively adorned, the fields are excessively overgrown, the granaries are excessively empty. They wear embroidered robes, carry sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth. This is called the boastful thievery of the lead reed—how far is this from the Dao!

Were I to possess even a little knowledge, in walking the great Way there would be nothing unknowable or impassable. Yet I would fear only ostentation, for it inevitably leads to losing the Way. The great Way is very level, fundamentally easy to follow, yet the people always prefer byways. What does this preference entail? Observe their court—excessively adorned, their governance—burdensome. Observe their fields—excessively overgrown, their granaries—excessively empty. Their fundamental occupations are abandoned. Instead, they wear embroidered robes, carry sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth—corruption flourishes. Great villains arise, and petty thieves follow. This is called the lead reed’s boastful thievery, the prelude to a chorus of discord. Truly, how far is this from the Dao!

What is well established cannot be uprooted; what is firmly embraced cannot slip away. Thus, descendants will continue their ancestral sacrifices without cease. Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes genuine. Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring. Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes prosperous. Cultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal. Therefore, observe the self through the self, observe the family through the family, observe the village through the village, observe the state through the state, observe the world through the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this.

What is well established cannot be uprooted; what is firmly embraced cannot slip away. Transmitted without end, even to descendants, ancestral sacrifices continue without cease. That which is called well established and firmly embraced is nothing other than skillfully cultivating virtue. To cultivate virtue: cultivate it in the self, and with the self rectified, one’s virtue becomes genuine; cultivate it in the family, and with the family ordered, one’s virtue becomes abundant; cultivate it in the village, and with the village transformed, one’s virtue becomes enduring; cultivate it in the state, and with the state governed, one’s virtue becomes prosperous; cultivate it in the world, and with the world at peace, one’s virtue becomes universal. This is why it cannot be uprooted or slip away. How does one know whether virtue has been cultivated or not? Observe the self through the self, the family through the family, the village through the village, the state through the state, the world through the world—nothing more. How do I know the world is thus? By this.

The passage on observing the self is unclear in detail.

One whose power is profoundly embedded is like a newborn babe: no venomous creature stings it, no fierce beast seizes it, no grasping bird of prey snatches it. Though its bones are weak and its sinews soft, its grip is firm. It knows nothing of the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of its essence. It cries all day without growing hoarse—such is the perfection of its harmony. To know harmony is to know the constant; to know the constant is to be enlightened. To seek to augment life is to court calamity; to let the heart direct the qi is to invite violence. When things reach their prime, they age—this is called not following the Way. What does not follow the Way perishes early.

One whose power is profoundly embedded is like a newborn babe: no venomous creature stings it, no fierce beast seizes it, no grasping bird of prey snatches it—all these are responses to profound power. Though its bones are weak and its sinews soft, its grip is firm. It knows nothing of the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of its pure qi. It cries all day without growing hoarse—its mind unmoved, its qi perfectly harmonious. To know this principle of perfect harmony is to know the constant Way; to know the constant Way is to attain perfect enlightenment. Knowing harmony, knowing the constant, and holding fast to them without loss—this is how one whose power is profoundly embedded may be likened to a newborn babe. Otherwise, not knowing that life cannot be augmented, one seeks to augment it, thereby inviting misfortune and courting calamity. When the heart commands the qi with a will to dominate, this is called failing to remain weak and instead forcing strength. When things reach their prime, they must age. To rely on strength is called not following the Way; what does not follow the Way perishes early. How vastly different is this from one whose power is profoundly embedded!

The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise. Block the openings, shut the doors, blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, soften the glare, merge with the dust—this is called mysterious sameness. Thus, one cannot be drawn near, nor kept at a distance; cannot be benefited, nor harmed; cannot be honored, nor debased. Therefore, such a one is esteemed by all under heaven.

The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise. Those who know the Way block the inner outlet and close the outer gate, blunting their own sharpness, resolving the entanglements of things, softening their own brilliance, and merging with the world’s dust—this is called forgetting self and other, blending inner and outer, and attaining mysterious sameness with the Way. How can one rely on words? Those who have not attained mysterious sameness may align with this but differ from that, or align with the beginning but not necessarily with the end. When they align, they draw near, benefit, and honor; when they differ, they distance, harm, and debase. The one who has attained mysterious sameness does not align with anything—how then could there be anything called difference? Thus, one cannot be drawn near, nor kept at a distance; cannot be benefited, nor harmed; cannot be honored, nor debased. Therefore, such a one is the most esteemed under heaven.

Govern the state with uprightness, deploy troops with craft, and win the world through non-action. How do I know this is so? The more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the people become; the more sharp tools the people possess, the more troubled the state grows; the more cunning the people, the more strange things arise; the more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear. Therefore, the sage says: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.

To govern as a ruler, govern the state with the upright Way, deploy troops with craft and change, and win the world through non-action. How do I know that the world can be won through non-action? I have observed: the more taboos there are in the world, the more people lose their livelihoods and the poorer they become; the more the people rely on sharp schemes, the more the state is dazzled and grows troubled; the more people abandon fundamental work for clever tricks, the more useless and strange things arise; the more laws and decrees are made to control people, the more thieves and bandits multiply. All these arise from the ruler’s excessive meddling. Knowing that excessive meddling harms the world, one knows that non-action is sufficient to win it. Therefore, the sage says: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves. This speaks to how non-action is sufficient to win the world.

*(Note: The character "■〈峻，血代山〉" is here rendered as "its organ stirs," following the context of "essence" and "qi.")*

When governance is broad and unconstrained, the people are simple and honest; when governance is exacting and meticulous, the people are lacking and deficient. Misfortune!—fortune leans upon it; fortune!—misfortune lurks within it. Who knows their ultimate outcome? Is there no standard? The standard reverts to the strange, goodness reverts to the ominous. The people’s confusion has lasted long indeed. Therefore, the sage is square but does not cut, sharp but does not pierce, straight but not unrestrained, bright but not dazzling.

When a ruler’s governance is broad and unconstrained, the people are simple and know kindness; when governance is exacting and meticulous, the people are lacking and grow estranged. Broad governance may seem to yield nothing from the people, yet the people respond with simplicity; exacting governance may seem to gain much from the people, yet they respond with deficiency. People see misfortune and think it fortune’s support; they see fortune and think it misfortune’s hiding place. Who truly knows their ultimate outcome? When those who implement exacting governance believe they act with uprightness, over time, uprightness reverts to the strange, and goodness reverts to the ominous. The harm of exacting governance is thus: people grow accustomed to immediate small fortunes and overlook distant misfortune—this has lasted long indeed. Therefore, the sage is square but does not cut, sharp but does not pierce, straight but not unrestrained, bright but not dazzling—abandoning exacting governance and embracing the broad. Uprightness that does not become strange, goodness that does not become ominous—this is the attainment of the Way.

*(Annotations: "奇" means strange; "妖" means ominous or monstrous; "刿" means to pierce; "割" means to cut.)*

In governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. Only through frugality can one be said to practice early compliance. Early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of power. With the repeated accumulation of power, there is nothing one cannot overcome; with nothing one cannot overcome, no one knows one’s limits; with no one knowing one’s limits, one can possess a state. Possessing the mother of the state, one can endure long. This is called having deep roots and a firm foundation—the Way of long life and enduring vision.

In governing people, one should not seek to complicate affairs; in serving heaven, one should not seek to expend resources—both should be like frugality. Frugality means restraint, emptiness, and stillness. Only through frugality can one not wait for the appearance of misfortune before early compliance with the Way. Early compliance with the Way is the repeated accumulation of power within oneself. With the repeated accumulation of power, one will be invincible in all affairs; being invincible in affairs, the measure of one’s power remains unknown. With the measure of one’s power unknown, one can possess a state. Possessing a state means possessing the root that nurtures it—this is the mother of the state. This allows for long-lasting governance and peace without calamity. This Way, applied to life, is the Way of deep roots, firm foundation, long life, and enduring vision. Therefore, in governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.

Han Feizi said: The common people employ their spirit with restlessness; restlessness leads to great expenditure—this is called extravagance. The sage employs their spirit with stillness; stillness leads to minimal expenditure—this is called frugality. He also said: One who knows how to govern people maintains a tranquil mind; one who knows how to serve heaven keeps their apertures empty. A tranquil mind ensures virtue does not depart; empty apertures allow harmonious qi to enter daily. Every word becomes savorable.

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish—through the Dao one oversees the world, and its ghosts do not act as spirits. It is not that its ghosts lack spirit; their spirit does not harm people. Since their spirit does not harm people, the sage likewise does not harm people. As neither harms the other, virtue converges upon them. [Jiao Shi notes: "Cooking should not involve adding fire."]

Those who govern a great state must not be troubled, just as cooking a small fish must not be stirred. Governing through the Dao alone suffices. If the ruler truly oversees the world with the Dao, ghosts will remain silent, at peace in obscurity, and not act as spirits. It is not that the ghosts lack spirit; though they possess spirit, they do not become malevolent to harm people, appearing as if they lack spirit. Nor is it that their spirit inherently does not harm people; the sage’s governance also does not harm people. Harmony beckons harmony, so spirits do not harm people. The sage does not harm people—this is the work of the sage’s virtue. As neither harms the other, virtue converges upon the sage.

The word "亦" should be read carefully: it traces back to the original meaning of "neither harms the other," referring to both the sage and spirits not harming people, not to people and spirits not harming each other.

A great state is the lower reaches, the confluence of the world, the female of the world. The female constantly overcomes the male through stillness, and through stillness, it remains below. Thus, if a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state’s allegiance; if a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state’s patronage. Therefore, some humble themselves to gain, while others humble themselves to be gained. A great state desires nothing more than to nurture others; a small state desires nothing more than to serve others. When both attain what they desire, the greater should act with humility.

A great state is the lower reaches of small states, the meeting point of the world—this is the female of the world. The female, as a creature, constantly overcomes the male through stillness and remains below. Knowing the way of the female, one knows the way of the great state. Thus, if a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state’s heart and becomes its refuge. If a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state’s heart and becomes its charge. Some humble themselves to gain others; some humble themselves to be gained by others—such are the benefits of being the female. Observing the nature of great states, they desire nothing more than to nurture others; small states desire nothing more than to serve others. If a great state can humble itself to win a small state, and a small state can humble itself to win a great state, both attain what they desire. Thus, the greater must not rely on its size but should act with humility—how much more so the smaller?

The Dao is the hidden essence of the myriad things, the treasure of the good, and the refuge of the unvirtuous. Fine words can earn respect; noble conduct can elevate one above others. Why abandon those who are not good? Thus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, even if one presents a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao. Why was this Dao valued in antiquity? Was it not said: "Seek to obtain, and those with faults can be spared"? Thus, it is esteemed under heaven.

The Dao is the hidden essence in which the myriad things find peace, the treasure by which the good govern body and world, and the refuge on which the unvirtuous rely for self-preservation. How do we know it is the refuge of the unvirtuous? Even if a person is not good, should they possess a fine word, it can earn them respect; should they have a noble deed, it can elevate them above others. If those who are not good repent and seek the Dao, why would they be cast aside? The Dao is the refuge of the unvirtuous to this extent. Thus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed because the Dao exists, and people are drawn to it. Even if one presents a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses, it is truly not as valuable as sitting and advancing this Dao. Why was this Dao valued in antiquity? Was it not said: "Seek to obtain, for it is the treasure of the good; spare those with faults, for it is the refuge of the unvirtuous"? Thus, it is esteemed under heaven.

Act without acting, undertake without undertaking, savor without savoring. In great and small, much and little, repay resentment with virtue. Resolve difficulties when they are easy; achieve greatness when it is small. The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy; the great affairs of the world must arise from the small. Therefore, the sage never acts as if something is great and thus can accomplish greatness. One who makes promises lightly will lack trust; one who treats things as easy will encounter many difficulties. Therefore, the sage treats things as difficult and thus ultimately encounters no difficulty.

What the sage does is non-action; what they undertake is non-undertaking; what they savor is non-savoring. They regard the great as small and the much as little. They repay resentment with virtue, resolve difficulties when they are easy, and achieve greatness when it is small. For the difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy, and the great affairs of the world must arise from the small. Therefore, the sage never waits for something to become great before acting and thus can accomplish greatness. As for the common people, those who make promises lightly will later find it difficult to fulfill them and lack trust in their affairs; those who treat things as easy will later encounter many difficulties. Therefore, the sage treats affairs as difficult and thus ultimately accomplishes them without difficulty. [Jiao Shi notes: "为 means 'to act'."]

Wang Chunfu said: "事 refers to the conditions of action; 味 refers to the principles and subtleties of things; 作 means 'to arise'."

When it is peaceful, it is easy to maintain; when it has not yet shown signs, it is easy to plan; when it is fragile, it is easy to break; when it is subtle, it is easy to disperse. Act before it comes into being; govern before it becomes chaotic. A tree as wide as a person’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout; a nine-story terrace rises from a pile of earth; a journey of a thousand li begins with a single step. Those who act will fail; those who grasp will lose. Therefore, the sage does not act and thus does not fail; does not grasp and thus does not lose. The people’s undertakings often fail when nearly complete. Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure in affairs. Therefore, the sage desires what others do not desire and does not value rare goods; learns what others do not learn, and returns to what the common people have passed over. Thus, they assist the self-so of the myriad things and do not dare to act. [Jiao Shi follows the *Han Feizi* version, which reads 恃; here, we decisively follow the other editions.]

Observe how a tree of great girth grows from the tiniest shoot; a nine-story terrace rises from a mound of earth; a journey of a thousand li begins with a single step. Is there anything that does not begin small and end great? Should one not act when things have yet to arise and govern when disorder has yet to emerge? To act and to govern—how should one proceed if not by following the self-so of things?

Affairs of the world often fail when there is forced action, and loss follows when there is stubborn attachment. The sage does not act and thus does not fail; does not grasp and thus does not lose. This is how they are able to act before things arise and govern before disorder emerges.

Yet it is not only the beginning that demands caution. The people’s undertakings often fail when nearly complete. If one can be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure in affairs. Therefore, the sage desires what others do not desire and does not value rare goods; learns what others do not learn and returns to what the common people have passed over. All this is to assist the self-so of the myriad things and not dare to act.

[The following several sentences of the sage appear disconnected from the preceding text—could this be a misplaced slip?]

Those of old who were skilled in the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people but to make them simple. The people are difficult to govern because they possess too much knowledge. Thus, to govern the state with knowledge is the state’s bane; to govern the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing. Knowing these two paths is also a model. To know the model is called profound virtue. Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching; it moves contrary to things and thus attains great compliance.

Those of old who were skilled in the arts of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people and make them clever but to make them simple, to rid them of cunning and return them to purity. The people are difficult to govern because they possess too much knowledge. If I govern the state with knowledge, the people will respond with knowledge, and deceit will deepen, leading to great disorder—this is the state’s bane. Only by resting in non-action and not governing with knowledge will the people, not knowing or recognizing, comply with my governance—this is the state’s blessing. Knowing this as blessing and that as bane, one attains the model for governing the state. This is called profound virtue. Profound virtue as virtue is deep and far-reaching; though it moves contrary to the tendencies of things, only thus can there be peace above and below, attaining great compliance.

The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel in humbling themselves. Thus, the sage, wishing to be above the people, speaks as if below them; wishing to lead the people, places himself behind them. Therefore, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands before them, they do not find him harmful. Thus, the world delights in pushing him forward and does not grow weary of him. Because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him.

The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel in humbling themselves. Thus, the sage, wishing to be above the people, must speak as if below them; wishing to lead the people, must place himself behind them. Therefore, though the sage dwells above, the people do not suffer his weight; though he stands before them, they do not find him harmful. Not only do they not find him burdensome or harmful, but the world delights in pushing him forward and does not grow weary of him. Because he excels in humbling himself and does not contend, none in the world can contend with him.

Laozi’s flaw lies here. Su Ziyou said: “The sage does not wish to be above or lead the people; it is only after placing himself below and behind that his Dao inevitably leads and precedes.” Such embellishments are not his original intent. Many literati who explain Laozi and Buddhist texts are of this sort.

The world all says: “My Dao is great and seems unworthy.” Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it were worthy, it would long since have been small. I possess three treasures, which I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world. With compassion, one can be brave; with frugality, one can be expansive; not daring to be first in the world, one can become the vessel of leadership. Now, if one abandons compassion and seeks only bravery, abandons frugality and seeks only expansion, abandons the last and seeks only the first, this is death. With compassion, one will triumph in battle and stand firm in defense. Heaven will save them and protect them with compassion.

The world all says: “My Dao is great.” Yet others see it as if it were nothing, unworthy. Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it had worth, it would long since have been small. I possess three treasures, which I constantly treasure and hold fast. The three treasures are: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to be first in the world—these are what the world calls unworthy. Yet with compassion, one brings fortune to others and removes calamity, acting without doubt, and thus can be brave. With frugality, one accumulates abundance and ensures ample use, and thus can be expansive. Not daring to be first in the world means harboring no harm toward things, and thus people delight in pushing one forward, enabling one to become the vessel of leadership. The benefits of these three treasures to the world are thus. Now, if one abandons compassion and acts only with bravery, abandons frugality and indulges in expansion, abandons the last and delights in being first, this is what people detest—it is the way of death. How does this compare to knowing what to treasure?

Let us speak of the effects of compassion. If those above fully practice the Dao of compassion, the people will draw near and devote their lives to protecting their superiors. In battle, they will triumph; in defense, they will stand firm. This is Heaven’s intent to save such a person. Thus, by opening their hearts with compassion, they gain the people’s protection. People know that such a person protects others with compassion, but they do not realize that it is truly Heaven’s intent to save them through compassion. Then are those who harm the people for their own gain not doomed by Heaven?

One skilled in being a knight does not rely on martial prowess; one skilled in battle is not roused to anger; one skilled in defeating enemies does not contend; one skilled in employing others places himself below them. This is called the virtue of non-contention; this is called employing the strength of others; this is called matching Heaven—an ancient ultimate.

One skilled in being a knight does not exalt martial valor; one skilled in battle is tranquil and not roused to anger; one skilled in defeating enemies does not engage in contention; one skilled in employing others places himself below them. Possessing these skills is called the virtue of non-contention; it is called being able to employ the strength of others; it is called being able to match the Dao of Heaven—this is the ultimate principle since ancient times.

There are words on the use of arms: “I dare not be the host but act as the guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.” This is called marching without marching, raising arms without arms, wielding weapons without weapons. There is no greater disaster than underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasure. Thus, when opposing armies meet, the one that grieves will triumph.

Those who use arms say: “I dare not initiate conflict as the host but respond as the guest; I dare not advance an inch to seize what others have but would rather retreat a foot to preserve my own share.” This is using arms while maintaining the mindset of non-use—marching as if there were no ranks, raising arms as if there were no arms, wielding weapons as if there were no weapons. With such a mindset, how could there be fault in using arms? The greatest disaster for a state is underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy nearly results in losing one’s treasure. Thus, when two armies oppose each other, the one that grieves for the dead and does not delight in killing will triumph.

My words are most easy to know and most easy to practice, yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. Words have their origin, affairs have their master. It is only through ignorance that I am not known. Those who know me are rare—thus I am esteemed. Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

My words are most easy to know and most easy to practice, yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. Why is this? Words have their origin, affairs have their master. Only when one knows their origin and master can this be called knowing, and only then can one see how to practice. It is precisely because they do not know the origin of words or the master of affairs that, though they hear my words, they ultimately do not know me. Those who know me are rare—this is why what lies within me is esteemed. Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade. How could this be something others could know?

To know yet not presume to know is excellence; not to know yet presume to know is a flaw. Only by regarding this flaw as a flaw can one avoid falling into flaw. The sage is without flaw because he regards flaw as flaw—thus he is without flaw.

When the people do not fear authority, then great authority arrives. Do not constrict their dwelling, do not oppress their livelihood. It is only by not oppressing that one avoids oppression. Therefore the sage knows himself but does not display himself, cherishes himself but does not exalt himself—thus he discards that and embraces this.

When the people do not fear punishment and authority, they will inevitably violate the law, and great authority will arrive. The reason the people do not fear authority is that their dwelling is constricted and their ambitions grow vast, their livelihood is oppressed and their desires multiply—thus they fall into death without concern. Each person has their proper place: be careful not to constrict their position, be careful not to oppress their resources. The people’s hearts have no constant—they follow what those above guide. Only when those above do not first oppress their own livelihood will the people likewise not oppress theirs. If those above favor extravagance, delight in wealth and abundance, how can the people’s ambitions be settled? Therefore the sage knows himself but does not display himself to impress others, cherishes himself but does not exalt himself above others—thus he discards the habit of constant competition and novelty and embraces tranquility.

To be brave in daring leads to killing; to be brave in not daring leads to life. These two may bring benefit or harm. What Heaven detests—who knows the reason? Thus even the sage finds this difficult. The Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory, does not speak yet excels at response, does not summon yet comes of itself, is unhurried yet excels at planning. Heaven’s net is vast and wide—though it seems loose, nothing escapes.

Some use rigidity and force, being brave in daring, and thus inevitably cause killing. Some use softness and retreat, being brave in not daring, and thus can preserve life. These two may bring benefit or harm—all know they are not the same. To be brave in daring is what Heaven detests. Who knows the reason it leads to killing lies here? Thus, though the matter of bravery and daring concerns even the sage, he still finds it difficult, for he truly knows it is what Heaven detests. The Way of Heaven never contends with people, yet in the end nothing is not overcome. It never speaks, yet excels at responding to human affairs. It does not wait to be summoned yet arrives of itself in daily use, unhurried and at ease, as if forgetting others, yet excels at planning the success or failure, fortune or misfortune of all things. Heaven’s law is vast like a net—though it seems loose and wide, nothing is ever lost. The awesomeness of the Way of Heaven is like this. Once one violates what it detests, how can one escape?

The people do not constantly fear death—why use death to frighten them? If one could make the people constantly fear death and execute those who act strangely, who would dare? There is always an executioner who kills. To kill in place of the executioner is like hewing in place of the master carpenter—those who hew in place of the master carpenter rarely avoid injuring their hands.

The people’s nature does not originally fear death. Why, then, do those above use death to frighten them? If one could make the people constantly fear death and execute those who act strangely, who would dare to act strangely again? Yet killing does not cease, for one knows the people do not truly fear death. Thus those who rely on punishment to govern can now turn back. Moreover, when the people have crimes, there is always an executioner who kills them. If one acts on personal likes and dislikes to kill, this is killing in place of the executioner—like hewing in place of the master carpenter. Those who hew in place of the master carpenter rarely avoid injuring their hands. The executioner is the law. The sage establishes laws based on Heaven’s judgment—one cannot lightly weigh them with private intent. Those who abolish the law and act on emotion are warned.

The people starve because those above consume too many taxes—thus they starve. The people are difficult to govern because those above act excessively—thus they are difficult to govern. The people disregard death because they pursue life too fervently—thus they disregard death. Only those who do not make life their pursuit are wiser than those who value life.

The people starve because those above consume too many taxes—consuming many taxes exhausts the people’s strength, thus they starve. The people are difficult to govern because those above act excessively—acting excessively multiplies the people’s cunning, thus they are difficult to govern. The people disregard death because they pursue life too fervently—pursuing life fervently leads to insatiable greed, thus they disregard death. Only those who do not make life their pursuit: if above, they do not take excessively or act excessively to burden those below; if below, they do not dare to resist the net or commit crimes to trouble those above—are wiser than those who value their own lives.

In life, people are supple and weak; in death, they are rigid and strong. In life, plants and trees are soft and fragile; in death, they are withered and dry. Thus the rigid and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life. Therefore, when arms are strong, they are not victorious; when wood is strong, it is felled. The strong and great dwell below; the soft and weak dwell above. From this, one can know what to discard and what to adopt.

In life, people are supple and weak; in death, they become rigid and strong. In life, plants and trees are soft and fragile; in death, they become withered and dry. Thus the rigid and strong are companions of death; the supple and weak are companions of life. Therefore, when arms are strong, they are defeated; when wood is strong, people fell it. All things that are strong and great commonly dwell below; the soft and weak commonly dwell above. From this, one can know what to discard and what to adopt.

Is not the Way of Heaven like drawing a bow? The high is pressed down, the low is lifted; the excessive is reduced, the insufficient is supplemented. The Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to supplement the insufficient. The way of man is not so—it reduces the insufficient to offer to the excessive. Who can take from the excessive to offer to the world? Only one who has the Dao. Therefore the sage acts but does not rely on it, accomplishes but does not dwell on it. Does he not wish to display his worth?

Is not the Way of Heaven like drawing a bow? When one draws a bow, the high is pressed down to lower it, the low is lifted to raise it. The Way of Heaven reduces the excessive and supplements the insufficient—its governance is of the same kind. The Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to supplement the insufficient, but the way of man is not so—it reduces the insufficient to offer to the excessive. Who can take from the excessive to offer to the world’s insufficiency? Only one who has the Dao can do this. Therefore, the sage acts but does not rely on his actions, accomplishes but does not dwell on his achievements. Does he not wish to avoid displaying his worth? Perhaps this is how one can reduce the excessive and supplement the insufficient.

Master Jiao said: When a bow is relaxed and the archer lowers his body, the grip rises and the tips point downward; when the bow is drawn and the archer raises his body, the grip lowers and the tips rise. This is pressing down the high grip to make it descend and lifting the low tips to make them ascend. The Way of Heaven reduces the excessive as if pressing down the grip to make it descend, and supplements the insufficient as if lifting the tips to make them rise.

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing can surpass it in attacking the hard and strong, for there is nothing that can replace it. Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak overcomes the strong. Though none in the world do not know this, none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says: "One who bears the disgrace of the state is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain; one who bears the misfortune of the state is called the king of all under heaven." These words seem contrary, for the world regards disgrace as shame and misfortune as calamity. How could they know that the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong? These are the true words that accord with the Dao.

To reconcile great resentment, there must remain residual resentment—how can this be considered good? Therefore, the sage holds the left tally and does not demand from others. Thus, one with virtue governs by the tally, while one without virtue governs by the tax. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it constantly bestows on the good.

If a man harbors great resentment and I seek to reconcile it, there will inevitably remain resentment that cannot be overcome. If one acts with intention to do good, one’s reach is limited—how can this be considered good? Therefore, the sage has no fixed intent toward things, like holding the left tally and awaiting others to come. When their tally matches his own, he does not go forth to demand from them. Thus, one with virtue does not calculate or contend—this is called governing by the tally. One without virtue fears inequality and measures gains and losses—this is called governing by the tax. Reconciling great resentment is also governing by the tax, and thus cannot be considered good. The Way of Heaven is the same: it shows no partiality toward men, yet what it bestows is always with the good. This is the good man’s own attainment—how could it be that Heaven constantly seeks the good to bestow upon them?

The *Record of Rites* says: "One who offers grain holds the right tally." The commentary explains: "A tally is a single document written in duplicate and separated. The right half is written first as the honored copy." This means that when offering grain, one must first present the right tally to the recipient. From this, we know that the left tally is held by the one who controls the goods, while the right tally is held by the one who seeks them. Thus, holding the left tally means awaiting others to come and match it before giving, without going forth to demand from them. "Governing by the tax" refers to those who calculate and measure gains and losses.

Let there be small states with few people. Though they have tools and weapons, let them not be used. Let the people value their lives and not migrate far. Though there be boats and carriages, let there be no occasion to ride them; though there be armor and weapons, let there be no occasion to display them. Let the people return to knotting cords and using them. Let them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states may be within sight of one another, and the sounds of their chickens and dogs may be heard, yet the people may grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

I wish that those who are now lords would each be content with their small states and few people, not seeking to increase them. Let those who are their people each be content with their lot. Though they may have the talents and tools of ten or a hundred men, let them not seek to employ them. Let the people value their lives and not migrate far in pursuit of profit. Though they have boats and carriages, let there be no occasion to ride them; though they have armor and weapons, let there be no occasion to display them. Let them forget their cunning and return to knotting cords. Let each find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Let them be inwardly sufficient and outwardly without desire, so that even neighboring states may forget one another. Though the sounds of chickens and dogs may be heard, and the lands be very near, the people may grow old and die without ever visiting one another. If this is so among the near, how much more among the distant? If there is no visiting, how much less will there be contention? Such is the governance of non-action.

Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. Good words are not eloquent; eloquent words are not good. The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise. The sage does not accumulate. Having acted for others, he has more; having given to others, he has greater abundance. The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm; the Way of the sage acts and does not contend.

Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. Good words are not eloquent; eloquent words are not good. One who knows the Dao is not broadly learned; one who strives for broad learning does not know. Let us briefly describe the Way of the sage: the sage’s sageliness lies in having no accumulation for selfish ends, thus he constantly acts for others. Having acted for others, he has more; having given to others, he has greater abundance. The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm; the Way of the sage acts and does not contend. The Way of the sage is simply the Way of Heaven.
