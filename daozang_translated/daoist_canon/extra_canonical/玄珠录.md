**Record of the Mystic Pearl**

The dharmas of the ten directions may all be spoken of.
Yet all spoken dharmas are illusory and false;
even the unspoken dharma is illusory in contrast to this falsity.
If spoken dharmas are false, then the unspoken is also false.
Since all these are equally false, where then is the true?
Yet if all these false dharmas are in truth real,
why were the former called false?
Because speech arises, and thus falsity is spoken.
Why then is truth spoken?
Because speech arises.
And why does speech arise? To reach that which is beyond.
Why must that be heard? To penetrate the mind.
And why penetrate the mind? To attain the Dao.

All things are born bearing the Dao,
all things undergo change and transformation,
yet the Dao itself knows no change or transformation.
Thus, movement does not depart from stillness.
Since things bear the Dao, when things differ, the Dao also differs—
this is the Dao’s response to things.
Press a seal into clay: though the clay bears countless impressions,
the original seal’s characters do not diminish.
Though the original characters do not diminish,
they can imprint many clays,
and the characters in the clay are identical to those of the original seal.
Thus it is said: “Having given to others, one possesses even more.”

The Dao is nowhere absent; all belongs to the Dao’s response.
If one takes the responsive as real,
then where it does not respond should not exist—
yet if it responds, that response is dead.
If one takes the unresponsive as real,
then where it responds, the unresponsive is dead.
Where then is the Dao?
If one takes the ultimate as real,
then both the possible and the impossible are the Dao.
If one takes it as unreal,
then both the possible and the impossible are not the Dao.

The Dao resides between realm and wisdom,
it abides between knowing and unknowing.
Trace the thread of inquiry, and one attains perfect rectitude.
The true nature of rectitude unites in virtue with emptiness.
Through emptiness, it can give rise and cease,
yet it neither arises nor ceases.
The Dao pervades all things, and thus things are the Dao.
Since things arise and cease, the Dao also arises and ceases.
If things are contingent, then the Dao is entirely things.
If the Dao is eternal, then things are entirely impermanent.

The sutra states: “Unable to distinguish the false from the true,
how does one practice the true Dao?”
Answer: When the realm is exhausted and practice is complete,
this is called the correct Dao.
Expanding the mind to pervade the realm,
emerging from wisdom to rely on the other—
when the other is fully encompassed,
it becomes the great body.
Once the great body is established,
the small self dissolves,
and together with the small self,
it merges with the realm’s divisions.

Always take the mind-Dao as the agent,
and the realm-body as the object;
agent and object interact.
When the dharma-realm is perfectly complete,
agent and object each cease,
and the true essence remains eternally still.

Question: The sutra says, “The Dao is intertwined with sentient beings.”
How are they the same or different?
Answer: The Dao and sentient beings are both the same and different,
both eternal and impermanent.
Why?
The Dao and sentient beings arise interdependently—thus they are the same.
Sentient beings arise and cease, while the Dao neither arises nor ceases—thus they are different.
Different dharmas do not occupy the same place,
and their names do not depend on one another.

Objection: If names do not depend on one another,
how can they be called “same,” “different,” “eternal,” or “impermanent”?
Answer: Since each dharma has no comparison and no cause,
how can it have a name?
If one allows names to exist,
it is clear that one dharma has two names.
If one allows names to be absent,
it is clear that one dharma has no name.
Answer: I merely forcefully apply names,
and thus they come to exist.
Though forced, in that moment of forcing,
it is both same and different, both eternal and impermanent.
When forgotten, in that moment of forgetting,
it is neither same nor different, neither eternal nor impermanent.
The true nature of this dharma
is neither forced nor unforced,
neither eternal nor impermanent.
How can names be forcibly established in the nameless?

Answer: To enter silence is difficult.
If this dharma were definitively silence,
there would be no one in the world who forces speech.
Yet if there are those who force speech,
then silence is not truly real.
Further answer: It is precisely because silence is seen
that within it, all forced speech is seen.
Since silence is originally absent,
it is clear that forced speech is also absent.

The treatise states: “The nature of the Dao and the nature of sentient beings
are both identical to spontaneity.”
Sentient beings are born bearing the Dao—
are sentient beings the Dao?
Answer: Sentient beings are born bearing the Dao,
but sentient beings are not the Dao.
Why? Because they are not the Dao,
they must cultivate and practice.
Objection: If sentient beings are not the Dao,
yet through cultivation attain the Dao,
then the Dao is attained outside the self.
Sentient beings are not originally so—
how can one speak of attaining the Dao through cultivation?
Sentient beings have an impermanent nature,
and thus through cultivation they attain the Dao.
The Dao has no impermanent nature,
and thus it responds to sentient beings’ cultivation.
Sentient beings do not name themselves—
it is through the Dao that they first gain a name.
The Dao does not name itself—
it is through sentient beings that it gains a name.
If names arise through dependence,
it is clear that within the Dao there are sentient beings,
and within sentient beings there is the Dao.
Thus, sentient beings are not the Dao.
Yet through cultivation, the Dao is attained—
thus the Dao is not sentient beings.
Since it responds to sentient beings’ cultivation,
the Dao is therefore sentient beings,
and sentient beings are therefore the Dao.
When arising, they arise simultaneously;
when forgotten, they are forgotten simultaneously.
The true nature of this dharma
is neither arising nor forgetting,
nor is it neither arising nor forgetting.
Enter equality and abide in it—
the practitioner realizes it.
When principle is attained, abide in it;
within abiding, when forgetting is present, observe;
within observation, when penetration is attained, abide.

The Dao and sentient beings are mutually dependent.
If there are sentient beings, there is the Dao;
if there are no sentient beings, there is no Dao.
Sentient beings and the Dao share the same essence,
sentient beings and the Dao both follow the same course—
why then establish teachings and exclusively urge sentient beings to cultivate?
If sentient beings attain the Dao,
they attain the Dao apart from cultivation.
If the Dao responds to sentient beings,
the Dao is apart from what is practiced.
The sutra does not permit attachment—
how then can there be cultivation?
What is called cultivation
is a name established on the basis of delusion.
Since deluded dharmas are not real,
the teachings are all dregs.
Why cling to teachings and speak of cultivation?
Thus, the Dao, sentient beings, and teachings—
all three cannot be obtained.

Since the three cannot be obtained, they are also not mere emptiness.
Neither united nor separate, thus is the true reality.
Sentient beings and the Dao do not depart from one another.

When among sentient beings, the Dao is hidden and sentient beings appear;
when in the state of attaining the Dao, the Dao appears and sentient beings are hidden.
Only their concealment and revelation differ—
not a distinction of existence or nonexistence.

Thus, when the Dao has not yet manifested,
one cultivates to dispel its concealment;
when sentient beings have not yet receded,
one relinquishes the three poisons to dispel their revelation.
If sentient beings recede,
the Great Dao becomes perfectly unobstructed,
and perfect unobstruction is the reception of bliss.

When the Dao is concealed,
sentient beings are all afflicted,
and affliction is suffering.
Avoiding suffering and desiring bliss,
one teaches to dispel through cultivation.
Once cultivation is realized,
one departs from cultivation and further departs from teachings—
wherever one abides, there is liberation,
provisionally named "profound truth."

The Dao constantly follows birth and death,
accompanying them without separation.
Though sentient beings are born, the Dao is not born;
though sentient beings die, the Dao does not die.
If sentient beings die, their Dao unites with death;
if sentient beings are born, their Dao unites with birth.
Only when birth departs from death and constantly unites with the Dao
can there be "thus" or "not thus."
If death could unite with the living,
then there would be no Dao;
if birth could unite with the dead,
then there would be no Dao.
The Dao is neither "thus" nor "not thus"—
thus one knows the Dao is constant.
Birth and death are not constant,
yet beyond birth and death there is no separate Dao,
and beyond the Dao there is no separate birth and death.

Birth and death and the Dao do not abandon one another,
nor have they ever truly merged.
Because birth and death are constant,
they cannot be merged;
because they are not abandoned,
they cannot be separated.

Entering sameness, one follows sameness to enter contemplation;
through contemplation, one attains penetration and abides.
When abiding, if one forgets, one contemplates again.
Contemplation does not hinder abiding,
nor does abiding hinder contemplation.
Contemplation abides in abiding,
and abiding abides in contemplation.
Abiding and contemplation are neither one nor two,
yet both one and two—
entering sameness, one contemplates and abides again.

If all dharmas arise,
there is nothing that does not arise.
Arising belongs to sentient beings—
how could the essence of the Dao ever arise?
If all dharmas are forgotten,
there is nothing that is not forgotten.
Forgetting belongs to sentient beings—
how could the essence of the Dao ever be forgotten?
The true nature of the Dao
is neither arising nor forgetting.
From what do arising and forgetting arise?
The Dao does not pervade arising and forgetting—
how then can it be named the Dao?
How can arising and forgetting be named?
Only through arising and forgetting is the true nature known,
and only through the true nature are arising and forgetting recognized.
Completion occurs in a single instant,
and cessation occurs in a single instant.

Entering sameness, one compares brightness and darkness:
though they arise and cease, they have never abandoned emptiness.
Though emptiness abides constantly,
it has never abandoned brightness and darkness.
Brightness and darkness arise and cease,
but emptiness does not arise or cease.
Emptiness contains brightness and darkness,
yet brightness and darkness are not emptiness.
Only brightness, darkness, and emptiness—
emptiness is also brightness and darkness.
Brightness, darkness, and emptiness
have never been one, nor have they ever been two;
they are both one and two,
yet neither one nor two—
entering sameness, one abides thus.

One constantly takes what is known as one’s own body,
and what knows as one’s own mind.
Knowing, seeing, and the like are the Dao that can be spoken of;
the emptiness of knowing and seeing is the true Dao.
Knowing and seeing without limit is the great body;
seeing semblances is like striking the eye,
hearing semblances is like the great ear.
Recognizing what is known is the great mind;
the emptiness of the great mind is liberation.
Liberation is the exhaustion of the mind’s outflows,
and the exhaustion of the mind’s outflows is the exhaustion of the body’s outflows.
Yet the body’s outflows are not nonexistent—
in this state, the essence is constantly empty.

The one who contemplates and what is contemplated
both belong to the mind,
and both belong to the realm of objects.
Mind and realm of objects,
each abiding in its own place, do not come or go—
from where then do they arise?
If one awakens to the non-arising of arising,
one attains stability of mind.

All sentient beings who seek the Dao
must extinguish knowing and seeing.
Only when knowing and seeing are completely extinguished
can the Dao be attained.
Though knowing and seeing naturally cease after the death of sentient beings,
why exert painful effort to cultivate,
forcibly extinguishing knowing and seeing?

Explanation:
Death is not freely chosen;
at the time of death, one dies by another’s agency.
After death, knowing and seeing cease—
this cessation is also by another’s agency.
When the next life arises,
birth occurs by another’s agency.
Knowing and seeing arise with birth,
thus the body is bound,
and the Dao is not attained.
If, while the body has not yet ceased,
knowing and seeing are already absent,
then at the time of future birth,
one will naturally not receive rebirth.
Without birth, there is no knowing and seeing—
thus liberation is attained.

Praise:
Death is not freely chosen;
after death, there is another birth.
If knowing and seeing extinguish the self,
then by the self, there is no future birth.
The body’s burdens must be resolved first.
When all existences within the body are empty,
that emptiness is also empty,
and the mind roams the heavens.
When both emptiness and existence are empty,
the mind is without attachment.
Guiding and restraining people,
one follows their beginnings and ends.
Why is this?
Because people and the cycle arise together.

Objection:
Where does this cycle reside?
The cycle of people does not increase—
how then can there be a cycle?

Answer:
Observe this cycle carefully—
it does not lie outside the cycle of people,
yet this cycle exists.
The cycle is neither sound nor form—
ultimately, all is empty.
Practitioners should know
that knowing is the same as not knowing.
Who would there be to know?
In this state, there is neither non-knowing
nor the existence of knowing.
It is also said:
If there is knowing, then there is the name "not knowing."
Knowing is fundamentally nonexistent—
there is no such thing as "no not-knowing."
Originally, there is no knowing in the mind;
only when facing objects does knowing arise.
The mind is not without knowing—
without objects, there is no knowing.
This is also true of firewood and fire.
Thus it is said:
The impermanent can be made permanent,
and the permanent can be made impermanent.
Because of the presence or absence of objects,
there is knowing and not knowing;
without the presence or absence of objects,
there is neither knowing nor not knowing.
With knowing, there is not knowing;
there are things one does not know.
Without knowing, there is no not knowing—
there is nothing one does not know.
Thus it is said:
What the body sees—
old kingdoms, old capitals—
gazing upon them brings joy.
How much more so the return to the city of the nature and essence of no-knowing!

Then it is wondrously clear!

When the mind faces objects, mind and objects arise together;
if objects do not disturb the mind, it is the mind that deludedly arises.
The mind does not arise of itself—it arises because of objects.
Without the mind, objects do not arise of themselves;
without objects, the mind also does not arise of itself.

What can be spoken of is the provisional Dao;
the constant Dao is the true Dao.
If one abides in these,
this constant will indeed become provisional.

Why?
The constant alone abides in constancy and does not pervade the provisional,
thus this constant faces the provisional,
and so its constancy becomes provisional.

Utterances arise and emerge into the world—
speaking of constancy is also speaking of the provisional.
Since constancy and provisionality are originally nonexistent,
there is also no non-constancy or non-provisionality.

If among the manifold words,
one observes their subtleties through speech,
if one awakens to the emptiness of manifold words,
one observes their wonder without desire.

Substance and function are not the same—
why?
Substance is not function,
function is not substance.

Observe carefully:
when substance moves, it becomes function,
and that function is indeed substance;
when function ceases and returns to substance,
that substance is function.

Preserve them, and there are four;
forget them, and there is not one.

Among the inexhaustible dharmas under heaven,
none surpass being and non-being.
Within all being and non-being,
none surpass constancy and annihilation.

What is born does not exceed the four kinds of birth;
where birth resides does not exceed the great Dao.

Not only is the provisional Dao provisional,
the constant Dao is also provisional;
not only is the constant Dao constant,
the provisional Dao is also constant.

All arise through mutual dependence,
yet their arising is no arising;
they also perish through mutual dependence,
yet their perishing is no perishing.

Views of emptiness and views of existence
both reside within the one mind.
If this mind is also nonexistent,
where then would views of emptiness and existence reside?

All mental states and their meanings
are likewise so.

Therefore, when the mind arises, all dharmas arise;
when the mind ceases, all dharmas cease.
If one realizes the mindless,
there is certainly no arising, nor any ceasing.

In the constant, there are four truths:
one is constant, two are not.
To equalize them is to fall into the one;
without equalization, the one is not seen.
The Dao is both equalization and non-equalization.

Abandon sageliness and discard wisdom,
from the ordinary attain sageliness—
this sageliness still faces the ordinary.
When one is in the ordinary,
it has long since departed with the ordinary;
since the ordinary has departed, sageliness also departs.

When both ordinary and sagely are forgotten,
there is no wisdom and no benevolence,
few desires and return to the Dao.

Question: If abandoning sageliness has led to sageliness,
may one be permitted to abandon it?
For one who has not yet attained sageliness,
how should one dispel the abandonment?

Answer: We speak only of one who has attained sageliness,
not of one who has not.
One who has not attained has no sageliness—
how can one speak of no-sageliness?

The great Dao responds to nature,
yet this nature is not visible.
The natures of foolish and wise beings—
both natures are not visible.

Because they are not visible,
they can unite with the utmost mystery.
Since they are not two through kalpas,
they are called "the same."

It is also said: This too is inadmissible.

The great Dao embodies truth;
it has never not been the Dao.
Sentient beings embody illusion;
they have never not changed.

Through kalpas and distant realms,
they are called different.

The great person grasps the mysterious root,
responding to things without mind, yet penetrating.
To know the penetration of the great Dao
is called the great person.

Though the great Dao differs,
there is nothing that is not great—
thus it is called the mysterious root.

The great Dao follows the mysterious and quiescent.
Those who still the mind—
this is called quiescence.
Those who do not still it—
this is called non-quiescence.

Clearly knowing that within one place,
there is quiescence and non-quiescence;
those who arouse the mind—
this is quiescence and non-quiescence;
those who do not arouse it—
there is no quiescence and no non-quiescence.

These four phrases—
the great Dao is within them.

It is also said:
Activity is movement,
non-activity is quiescence.
Only when stirred does it move;
without stirring, it is naturally quiescent.

Only in movement is there quiescence,
only in quiescence is there movement.
Simply take movement—
movement within quiescence;
simply take quiescence—
quiescence like movement.

Though movement and quiescence differ,
true nature emerges from one.
Though true nature is one,
it is not bound to movement or quiescence.
Though movement and quiescence are two,
true nature is not bound—
this is like mud and seal.

If one brings the quiescent mind to movement,
though moving, the mind remains constantly quiescent;
if one brings the moving mind to quiescence,
though quiescent, it remains constantly moving.

To always have stability is to break the prior;
to always have the prior is to break stability.

When opposed, they alternately conceal and reveal;
when united, concentration and wisdom are both complete.

Within one mind and one thought,
all perfectly unites past and present.

Thus, one thought and one movement
are neither short nor long;
one speck of dust, one world—
neither large nor small.

Therefore, the sage in the present
can speak of ancient matters—
all by tracing texts in reverse to attain their truth.

Thus, present texts speak of ancient matters:
what was in the past can be practiced,
what was not in the past cannot be practiced.
Hence it is said:
The Jade Calendar emerges into the world,
encompassing and returning all principles.

Question: How can today’s mind
think of ancient matters?
How can ancient matters
be said to reside in today’s thoughts?

If ancient matters are in the present,
then the past is known to be not past;
if today’s mind is in the past,
then the future is known to be already come.

If one says the future is fixed,
how can the present know the past?
If one says the past is fixed,
how can the past truly remain in the present?

Since today’s mind thinks of ancient matters,
and ancient matters are tied to today’s mind—
clearly, within one mind and one thought,
it contains the past and also contains the present.

Because of this past and present,
one mind cannot be obtained;
because of this one mind,
two minds cannot be obtained.

Thus, it is neither one nor two,
can be one and can be two,
is being and is non-being,
has no non-being and no being.

Because it is being,
take being to traverse it;
because it is non-being,
take non-being to traverse it.

Abandon non-being and enter the Dao—
take being to traverse it;
abandon being and emerge into the world—
worldly dharmas arise and perish;
abandon the world and enter the Dao—
the nature of the Dao has no arising or perishing,
past and present appear boundlessly.

Hence it is said:
Vastly, all defilements are purified,
penetratingly, one reaches the Great Clarity.
The world is not a permanent abode—
the mysterious capital is the old capital.

Question: Within a single thread, are there five notes?

Answer: There is the nature of the five notes.
When the silk is not yet made into a string,
there are no five notes within the silk,
nor is there nature within it,
nor any interconnection of forms.

When the silk becomes a string,
plucking it produces the form of sound;
when not plucked, the nature of sound remains—
these two existences interconnect.

Thus it is known that within a single thread,
there is being and there is non-being;
its inherent nature
is neither being nor non-being.

If one seeks to break being,
the nature of sound within the silk is not being;
if one seeks to break non-being,
the nature of sound within the silk is not non-being.
Since it is neither being nor non-being,
it cannot be broken.

Question: The silk has no sound, yet plucking it produces sound;
the cart has no ox, yet whipping it makes it move—
how are these two non-beings the same?
The silk has nature, and its nature is eternally present;
the silk has sound, yet sound arises and ceases—
how are these two beings the same?

Answer: Each has its two beings and two non-beings,
mutually dependent and interconnected,
thus being and non-being are each the same as defilements.
When sentient beings cultivate and attain the sage’s Way,
they see that at the moment of attaining the Way, there are no defilements.
Yet when one examines the moment of attaining the Way,
where do defilements reside?
From whom is the Way obtained?

It is also said:
Observe carefully—
defilements have no place to hide,
yet there are no defilements.
Clearly knowing defilements are extinguished,
the Way has no other source;
yet those who attain the Way
clearly know the Way arises.

If one accepts this as fixed,
all are subject to arising and ceasing.
The Way is not superior,
nor are defilements inferior—
why then苦苦 seek to extinguish defilements
and strive to reach the Way’s ground,
when the Way and defilements ultimately leave no remainder?

Further answer: Speaking of the Way and the self,
the essence of the Way is fundamentally thus—
up to now, it has never given rise to defilements.

Further answer: Ultimately thus,
up to now, it has never been extinguished—
why then speak of the Way and defilements,
falsely claiming arising and ceasing?

What is this?
Carefully observing these four,
they are ultimately unassailable,
for within this Dharma,
there is no remainder and no lack.
If one claims the four are eternal,
they do not pervade the Dharma;
if one speaks of the one and the infinite,
it is clear they do not encompass all.

If one claims they can encompass all,
then the four are not real.
How then to understand this?

Answer: The four are mutually contradictory,
arising and ceasing do not occur simultaneously.
Dwelling in one, the other three are negated;
dwelling in two, there is no fear.
Applying one to all—
why would multiplicity not be the Way?
There is one, and there is many;
thus there can be one and there can be infinite.
Thus there can be being and there can be non-being;
thus there can be constancy and there can be cessation;
there can be superiority and there can be inferiority.

In the true nature of the Great Way,
there is no superiority nor inferiority,
no being nor non-being—
whom then does arising and ceasing expel?
Since nothing arises or ceases,
it is said that the Way’s ground and defilements
ultimately leave no remainder.

When practitioners walk the Way,
they should uphold the correct mind,
without losing the true nature.

Question: Whose nature is this nature?
Whose mind is this mind?

Answer: It is still the four propositions.
The mind is also the nature of all dharmas.
Without the four propositions, there is no mind;
without all dharmas, there is no nature.
If there is being, it exists simultaneously,
pervading the Dharma-realm without limit;
if there is non-being, it ceases simultaneously,
fearing even the most subtle would be utterly exhausted.

Here, there is nothing to be said—
it is forcibly named the Great Way.
The supreme Way is eternally mysterious and still;
speech is not its truth.
Yet to transform sentient beings,
it is forcibly spoken of.

Speaking of the four propositions,
the Way responds accordingly—
once the response arises,
it becomes the four illnesses.
Yet the arising of propositions
does not occur simultaneously:
responding to one, the other three are negated.
Sometimes the first arises while the other three have not yet come;
sometimes the last arises while the other three have already departed.

Yet the arising of one
depends on the three—
when these three are negated,
one also does not stand alone.
At the very moment of one,
the three have long been forgotten;
when the three are forgotten, one is also forgotten.

Question: Why does the Way arise in speech only to be negated?

Answer: Because sentient beings have arising and ceasing,
thus arising is negated by ceasing,
and ceasing is negated by arising.
In the true nature of the Great Way,
there is no nature and no cessation.

Dwelling in this ground and speaking of the four propositions,
they are called the four propositions.
When the mind abides here,
there are originally no four propositions.
Since the four propositions are absent,
the mind is also absent—
only then is it called the Great Four Propositions:
mind, Great Way, true nature, and true reality thus.

Question: Earlier it was said that dwelling in one negates the three,
and arising in four negates the three—
why not arise in just one?
If one has superiority and inferiority,
why not select the essential?
If one has no superiority or inferiority,
why traverse the three?

Moreover:
If one word suffices,
there is no need to arise in three;
if four words suffice,
these three should not be negated.
Why arise in four only to negate three?
Why traverse three to retain one?

Answer: Among the four propositions, there is no superiority or inferiority.
Since sentient beings have not awakened,
one word is insufficient,
thus four words are provisionally employed.
The four propositions do not occur simultaneously—
traversing one, the other three are always negated;
when the three are negated, one is also negated—
how could it be limited to three?

Question: These four propositions are the true Dharma of arising and ceasing—
why does the Way dwell within them?

Answer: The Way is nowhere absent,
eternally present in the four propositions.
Wherever it dwells is non-being—
the four propositions are not the Way.

Further question: The four propositions contain being—
why must being arise from being?
The four propositions contain non-being—
why must non-being extinguish non-being?

Answer: Within the four propositions, there is being,
yet arising cannot be obtained;
within the four propositions, there is non-being,
yet extinction cannot be obtained.
This is natural arising,
this is natural ceasing—
not arising from one who arises,
not ceasing from one who ceases.
Here, there is only thusness,
not arising nor ceasing,
nor not-arising nor not-ceasing.

Yet these four propositions have been spoken of before,
thus though negated, they do not equate to the time before speech.
Thus the awakened abide in the world having once awakened.

Thus, though returning, it does not equate to the unenlightened.
Once true nature is attained, it is never stained by the mundane—
hence it is said: the singular nature does not alter.

All myriad things each possess the four propositions.
Within the four propositions, each has its mind.
Mind after mind is not distinct—
pervading them as one, thus it is named the Great One.
It may also merge obscurely into one.
Seeking mind through the four propositions,
one finds that mind is but the outer skin—
even to the point where neither skin nor mind remains,
this is called the Great One.

It is likened to the plantain:
peeling away its layers to seek the heart,
one finds that the heart is but another layer—
peeling until neither layer nor heart remains,
this is called the True One.

Thus it is said: the nearer one approaches, the farther from reality.
If one attains the boundless, the non-other reality,
this is called the True One.

Seeing without seeing, seeing the formless—
for where there is no form, there is no seeing;
so too with no-thought.
Guarding the one breaks the knowledge of one.
Though guarding, it merges with sleep—
as when one concentrates intently,
eyes closed to envision, eyes open to retain,
thus obtaining the use of inner and outer.

The Way has never been four,
for its nature is one;
the Way has never been one,
for it pervades the four things.
Both one and four,
neither one nor four—
when the true reality arises from their midst,
it is named the True One.
The True One is but a borrowed term.
Only because the Dharma does not speak
do we see the spoken Dharma.
If the Dharma were spoken,
we would again see the unspoken Dharma—
distant yet mutually dependent,
each revealing the other.
Within them lies hidden measure,
fore and aft in accord.

From ancient times to the present,
if this is not,
there is no hidden measure;
from ancient times to the present,
if this is,
there is hidden measure.
Thus we know being and non-being oppose,
past and present differ in age—
only in the symbol’s central truth,
the one and four images,
do they converge in true nature,
naturally so.

What transformation awaits its cause to change?
Though grasses and trees lack knowledge,
their falling fruit meets birth and death;
though the true Way lacks knowledge,
its falling fruit is ever-abiding.
Here, though lacking knowledge,
there is the perception of non-knowledge.
Without mind, there is no knowing;
without eye, there is no seeing.
This knowing is not mind—
thus it knows the unknowable;
this seeing is not eye—
thus it sees the unseeable.
Hence it is said: to know the unknowable
is the pivot of the Way.

Know that within the three times,
all three are empty.
The three times are:
one half already gone,
one half yet to come,
with no interval remaining between—
thus all are empty.

Understanding the emptiness of the three times
is like a lamp.
When about to extinguish the lamp,
does one see the lamp at the moment of extinction?
If at extinction the lamp is seen,
then extinction has not yet come;
if at extinction the lamp is not seen,
then the lamp has already passed;
between extinction and non-extinction,
where does its nature stand?
Between past and future,
there is but a name without substance—
thus we know the three times are empty.

Empty, therefore without self;
without self, what love remains?
Having no attachment,
it is one with the Way.
One with the emptiness of the Way—
thus it is called love of the Way.
Empty yet one with self—
thus it is called the Way’s love.
The essence of the Way is truly empty,
yet not identical to emptiness.
Emptiness can only empty,
it cannot respond to things;
the essence of the Way, though empty,
can empty and respond to things.

Question: Can the Way respond to things—
can things attain the Way?
If things attain the Way,
should they not abide upon attaining it?
Why then do they receive further birth?
If things are not the Way,
what is cultivated is but an external path.
Things can never attain the Way,
so why employ cultivation?

Answer: Because sentient beings are impermanent,
they must rely on cultivation.
The Way is impermanent—
when sentient beings cultivate, they attain it.
Sentient beings do not attain it by themselves,
but through the Way they first attain.
The name of the Way does not arise by itself,
but through sentient beings it arises.
When it arises, it arises all at once—
nothing fails to arise;
when forgotten, it is forgotten all at once—
nothing fails to be forgotten.
Superior and inferior arise simultaneously—
where then are Way and things?

Though sentient beings arise, the Way does not arise;
though sentient beings cease, the Way does not cease.
When sentient beings arise, the Way first arises;
when sentient beings cease, the Way also ceases.
If one allows for selflessness,
then from the beginning the Way was attained, not I;
if one insists on self,
then from the beginning the Way was attained, not I.

Before sentient beings arose, the Way was already present—
this Way is not my Way,
it is solely the ancient Way.
The Way I now attain
meets the essence of the ancient Way—
thus the ancient Way is the present Way,
the present Way is my Way.
Why?
Through kalpas without end,
only the one Way of wisdom exists.
When attained by sentient beings,
it is the private Way of sentient beings—
merely the floating Way of the many,
responding to the private and named the private Way.

To break names:
pointing to bamboo as water,
pointing to emptiness as bamboo—
thus at one moment it is,
at another it is not.
To break essence:
following the transformations of sentient beings’ perceptions,
one sees being and non-being differently.
Sometimes seeing emptiness where there is being,
sometimes seeing being where there is emptiness—
this is breaking essence.

Observing names and dharmas as existent,
sometimes they merely change without emptying—
as when seeing an ox change into a horse,
one says it is a horse,
not an ox,
yet it is not replacing the other in name.
If one person attains pure perception,
all dharmas are also pure;
if the multitude do not attain it,
all dharmas are also defiled.
Clearly knowing it is still defiled,
the pure is pure again,
the defiled is also being,
the formless is also the absence of dharmas.

The essence of perception is eternal and pure;
its function is change and sentient beings.
Sentient beings cultivate change to seek the unchanging,
cultivate function to return to essence—
this is the death of the perceptual function,
not the death of the pure true essence.

Abiding in fundamental reality,
not receiving empty names—
when empty names come,
each returns to its emptiness.
If reality comes to take,
I receive the one;
if emptiness comes to take,
I receive the two;
if one comes without speech,
abiding in reality, only the one is obtained.
