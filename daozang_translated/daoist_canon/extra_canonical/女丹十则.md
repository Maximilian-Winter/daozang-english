*Ten Principles of Female Alchemy*
*Recorded by the Ancient Mother of Xiangyi of Golden Flower Mountain*
*Edited and Revised by Chen Yingning*

**Reader’s Notice:**

1. This book bears no author’s name, and the old attribution to the "Ancient Mother of Xiangyi of Golden Flower Mountain" is crude and shallow. Though the author may not have wished to use their real name, why fabricate a sacred title? Thus, it has been omitted from this edition.

2. Though the book is titled *Ten Principles*, the fifth and sixth principles are largely identical in content, while the tenth is overly vague, rendering its separate inclusion unnecessary. For these three sections, substantial revisions and abridgments have been made to spare the reader undue tedium. Other sections have also been edited or condensed. Should scholars compare the original with this edition, they will recognize the necessity of these revisions—not as meddlesome interference, but as reasoned improvement.

3. Beyond the main text, all appended annotations are my own. Readers are urged to pay close attention, for these commentaries are the fruit of decades of experience, unlike the careless, baseless assertions one often finds in others’ writings.

4. The appended *Kun Formula* is not definitively attributed to Sun Buer, though its prose is concise and admirable. As for Fu Jinquan’s annotations, they are regrettably cluttered with metaphors, which may hinder comprehension. The origins of the terms "Yellow Sprout" and "White Snow" at the end of the text are explained in detail in my notes—readers should study them carefully.

5. Since ancient times, fewer than thirty texts on female alchemy containing true methods have been preserved in this land. One cannot expect to find many more. Scholars must read them all to grasp the fundamentals, then seek teachers and fellow practitioners for hands-on cultivation. Only then may success be hoped for. Beware of half-understanding and self-satisfaction.

**First Principle: Nurturing the True and Transforming Qi**

*(Yingning notes: In Daoist practice, oral instructions are paramount—whether a text’s prose is refined or crude matters little. Some works may suffer from flawed theories, awkward phrasing, shallow insights, or superstitious admixtures, all of which may invite disdain and cause even their authentic oral instructions to fade into obscurity. This is deeply regrettable. In compiling this book, I aim to guide women of above-average learning. Had I merely transcribed the original texts, I might have drawn ridicule from the cultivated. Thus, I have distilled their essence, excised their flaws, and though the result may not be entirely pure, it is far more presentable than the originals.)*

Female cultivation differs from that of males. In men, yang descends and dissipates; in women, yang ascends. Men possess a rigid constitution; women, a yielding one. Men preserve the yang essence of the dantian, preventing its external leakage. Over time, they employ the true fire within the body to refine essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness, thereby attaining the Dao. Women, being of yin constitution, must transform the spiritual marrow of the breasts to alter their qi quality. Through prolonged refinement, the red naturally reverts to white, and blood transforms into qi. Once blood has become qi, they too employ the fire talisman to advance and retreat, enabling qi to revert to pure yang and the Dao to return to its true state.

Thus, in their initial work, women first refine their physical form before refining their original essence—a reversal of the male path, which begins with refining original essence before the physical form.

What is meant by *nurturing the true*? The human heart is easily swayed; if constrained within, it grows restless. Therefore, the first step teaches the method of nurturing the true, which naturally alleviates restlessness, harmonizes the four limbs, and prepares one for further progress.

During daily seated practice, one must mobilize the qi mechanism within the dantian and sea of blood, directing it toward the mind’s inner chamber. There, a wisp of clear qi emerges from the sea of blood. With prolonged focus, this qi stirs and, following its own momentum, soars upward to the niwan. It then descends, and at this moment, one subtly guides it with intention, following its movement from the niwan down the *chonglou*. Here, intention must not be forced, lest the body be harmed. Instead, allow the qi to descend naturally from the *chonglou* to the space between the breasts, where an empty cavity resides. After prolonged concentration, if movement arises, proceed as before. Within forty or fifty days, the qi will penetrate, blood will transform into qi, and the red will revert to white. At this stage, the primordial elixir manifests, and the heart of the Dao becomes sincere.

If one persists in quiet abiding, unwavering in morning and evening, and diligent at all times, how could the great elixir fail to coalesce, or the female immortal remain unrealized? This is the first step in female cultivation. If one attains its most profound and wondrous state, all subsequent work will advance from this foundation.

Students, take heed.

*(Yingning notes: When the qi descends from the niwan, the text first says, "subtly guide it with intention," then warns, "do not use intention." So, is intention to be used or not?)*

Should intention be used or not? At this stage of movement, it lies between the intentional and the unintentional. To follow its natural course, one says, "Do not use intention." Yet it cannot be left unattended, hence one says, "Guide it subtly with intention."

**Second Principle: The Nine Cycles of Refining Form**
Refining form means regulation and nurturance. Blood and fluids, belonging to yin and yang, congeal and reside below, stored in the Sea of Blood and the womb, transformed at the summit of the Five Skandhas Mountain. They irrigate the entire body, nourishing the hundred vessels, circulating without cease, overflowing through the meridians, only to become dregs and be discarded. After two hundred and forty ke and thirty double-hours have passed, the refined essence re-emerges, the primordial transforms form, and it is retained for the sustenance of life. This is what is meant by the pure qi ascending to the breasts, while the turbid qi flows downward as stagnation—the pivot where mortals and immortals diverge. Thus, in female cultivation, one must first discern the pure from the turbid to refine the true form.

How is form refined? While seated, employ the spirit’s mechanism to move, waiting until the mouth is filled with fluid. Gently rinse several times, allowing it to settle and clarify. Then, draw in pure qi through the nose, swallowing it along with the jade-like fluid, descending past the Tower of Jade into the Crimson Palace, down to the Yellow Chamber, and halting at the Sea of Blood in the Pass of Origin. After a brief pause, circulate it from the Sea of Blood to the Tailbone, ascending along the Spine’s Ridge to penetrate the Crown Gate and enter the Mud Pill Palace. From there, descend again to the space between the breasts and rest. After a long pause, let the fluid transform into qi—this is one cycle. Repeat this three times for a total of three cycles. Once complete, use both hands to rotate the breasts thirty-six times. Then, cup them and gently guide them to the center, moving downward to the Sea of Blood, and repeat the process as before. One session consists of three cycles, and three sessions yield nine cycles in total.

If a woman is serene, dignified, deeply rooted, and of profound capacity, practicing this for no more than a hundred days will refine her form, and the path to longevity will open. From here, further progress may be sought, and the great elixir will be within reach.

**Third Principle: Applying the Fire and Talisman**
Men refine the medicine first, then the form. Women refine the form first, then the medicine. Their physical constitutions differ, so the order of practice varies. Female cultivators should follow the previous instructions diligently. When, in the Sea of Blood within the Elixir Field, the qi mechanism warms, a wisp of pure qi will naturally surge upward to the Heart Chamber and reach the breasts. At this moment, one must not stir a single thought. Continue the practice as before, and the qi will naturally descend again, returning to the Sea of Blood. By this time, the qi mechanism has stirred, true qi has arisen, and the yin of red blood has transformed into the yang of white qi. If the fire and talisman are not applied, the qi will revert to red blood, the white will turn back to red, and all effort will have been in vain.

At this stage, one must use true fire to refine it and true talisman to respond to it. When the talisman arrives and the fire is sufficient, the qi will congeal. At this moment of congealment, a distinct phenomenon arises. If not clearly explained, the application of fire and talisman may err, risking harm to the primordial elixir. Practitioners must memorize this carefully and not forget.

If this step is misapplied, not only will prior efforts be wasted, but future practice will be difficult, and there may even be harm to body and life, with the risk of blood collapse. Take heed: when the qi returns to the Sea of Blood, though it emerges from the blood, it is not blood itself. Like a traveler returning home in disguise, even family and wife may not recognize them—how could they be as before? Thus, as it descends, the Sea of Blood must feel like a fish drawing in water. At this time, the four limbs grow languid as if drunk, and the bliss is akin to the union of husband and wife, an ecstasy beyond restraint.

*(Yingning notes: Some say the bliss felt in the body at this moment surpasses that of the union of man and woman manyfold. For certain women, naturally cold in temperament, who encounter weak men, there may be no pleasure at all in such encounters. But in the practice of Daoist cultivation, a woman—though alone, with a pure heart and few desires, seated in quiet meditation—if she harmonizes the yin and yang within her body according to the method and enters the most profound and wondrous state, will encounter extraordinary phenomena. The bliss is beyond words. While men practicing quiet cultivation may sometimes experience blissful phenomena, compared to the degree of bliss in women, it is but two or three parts out of ten. This pertains to the physiological differences between men and women, not something that can be forced by human effort.)*

Upon reaching this stage, one must firmly maintain control and under no circumstances indulge in laxity. With a single thought, concentrate and guard the Central Palace, allowing it to gather for a long while—naturally, it will surge upward to breach the passes, ascending into the Mud Pill Palace and transforming into Jade Nectar. Then, with intention, guide it downward past the Tower of Multi-Storied Chambers, halting between the two breasts. Employ the method of congealing qi to blend it, ensuring it gathers without dispersing. With prolonged practice, one will naturally return to the root and restore the original state, thereby connecting with fetal breathing. Once fetal breathing is established, the Dao of immortality may be attained in a matter of days. Women cultivators should mutually encourage one another in this pursuit.

**Fourth Principle: Silent Circulation of Fetal Breathing**
For women cultivators who diligently follow the preceding oral instructions with wholehearted devotion, true qi will naturally grow day by day, and blood will transform into fluid, flowing from between the breasts to circulate through the hundred vessels, nourishing the entire body. This fluid, born of blood’s transformation, must be constantly warmed and nurtured by internally circulating the primordial harmonizing qi, so that it may stabilize the Central Field and serve as the foundation for transcendence.

What is meant by "internally circulating the primordial harmonizing qi"? It refers to breath that arises from and is stabilized within the center. In women’s cultivation, having obtained Jade Nectar, one must employ this qi to congeal it, ensuring the fluid does not dissipate and may instead coalesce into the Reverted Elixir. During this internal circulation, the movement neither adheres to nor departs from the mouth and nose—though it bears the name of breathing, it possesses no form of breathing. Why is this? It borrows the function of breathing to fulfill the meaning of breathing.

For the breathing of the mouth and nose belongs to the postnatal realm, while internal circulation pertains to the prenatal. At this stage, emphasis is placed on the prenatal, not the postnatal. Prenatal breathing has a name but no form, and as the postnatal breath of the mouth and nose naturally rises and falls, so too does it. With prolonged practice, each breath returns to the root, and the qi of respiration no longer depends on the mouth and nose. Thus, fetal breathing is achieved, and the Dao of immortality is not far off.

*(Chen Yingning’s note: The original text did not clearly explain this stage of practice. Fearing that later learners might struggle to comprehend it, I have endeavored to simplify it. I have revised and abridged much of the original text to make it more accessible.)*

At its subtler turns and finer points, the transmission must come through a master’s oral instruction and direct guidance. The disciple must also inwardly grasp and spiritually comprehend it, personally verifying it within their own body. With deep and prolonged practice, the moment will come when all falls naturally into place. Should one suddenly achieve thorough penetration, they will spontaneously align with the marvels of the Dao, and need no longer be rigidly bound by written words.

**Fifth Principle: Broadening Meritorious Conduct**

If a woman can quietly cultivate the supreme Dao, having refined the jade-fluid returning elixir, recognized her prenatal visage, and stabilized her fetal breathing practice, she must then rely on external conduct to nurture the root of the Dao. Only thus can she avoid external deficiencies while internally receiving support. She should serve her parents-in-law with utmost filial devotion, interact with others with sincerity and kindness, show compassion to orphans and widows, relieve suffering and aid the poor, respect her teachers and elders, and live in harmony with her neighbors. Her movements should not be frivolous, her speech not arrogant. All her actions should conform to principle and propriety, so that her qi and disposition become naturally harmonious. Without seeking meritorious conduct, it will establish itself.

*(Chen Yingning’s note: This section has been greatly abridged; what remains is sufficient.)*

**Sixth Principle: Resolute Commitment and Steadfast Practice**

If a female cultivator of the Dao can find an enlightened teacher, grasp the oral instructions, refine her character, and vow to devote herself to practice with unwavering perseverance, then the attainment of immortality may be realized in due time. Yet the nature of women is often fickle and mutable; when faced with adversity, it is difficult to ensure that her original resolve will not falter. She may be led astray by misleading paths, adopting perverse or biased views, thereby squandering all prior efforts and sinking into the sea of karmic suffering—alas, how lamentable!

Though many in the world transmit the Dao, those who receive its true transmission are rare, and many err, misleading both themselves and others. Here, the oral instructions of *Nüdan* are clearly expounded to guide those of karmic affinity. May they leap free from the sea of delusion, reach the other shore, and ensure that no jade-like soul is shattered in the Yellow Springs, while the rosy-cheeked gain the art of preserving their youth. If this is maintained without loss, boundless joy shall be theirs—how could this not be a cause for celebration?

The precepts are as follows:
1. **First Precept:** Honor and serve one’s parents-in-law.
2. **Second Precept:** Uphold integrity and uprightness.
3. **Third Precept:** Be cautious in speech.
4. **Fourth Precept:** Exercise care in conduct.
5. **Fifth Precept:** Revere the teacher and honor the Dao.
6. **Sixth Precept:** Maintain an unchanging resolve.

*(Chen Yingning’s note: Four-fifths of the original text has been omitted as it is of no great importance. As for the six precepts, though each was originally accompanied by explanations, these have not been included, for their general meaning is already clear.)*

**Seventh Rule: Cultivating the Original Spirit**
The practice of women is swifter than that of men. In the female elixir method, from nurturing the true to embryonic breathing, the greater part of the work is already accomplished—unlike the male practice, which requires many additional steps to reach the stage of spirit regulation. Thus, once the work of nurturing the true and embryonic breathing is complete, the female method proceeds directly to external cultivation. When external conduct is sufficiently refined, one may then undertake the work of refining and regulating the spirit. For during prior refinement, blood has already been transformed into *qi*, and this *qi* may now be transmuted into spirit. At this juncture, if one does not temper the temperament and supplement it with external conduct, there is a risk that the spirit may fail to stabilize, leading to the loss of all prior progress. One must adhere strictly to the precepts, observe the methods with discipline, and polish the mind until it becomes like a block of crystal—refined again and again, polished without cease, until inner and outer are immaculate, transparent within and without, the form empty and free of the slightest dust. When this stage is reached, a radiant, numinous, and transformative mechanism will naturally arise, illuminating the cavity within. In deep meditation, one neither eats nor hungers, neither moves nor speaks. At this time, a guardian must be present to prevent startling disturbances, lest the spirit be harmed or demonic influences intrude, which would cause grave harm. Women who have reached this point must remain vigilant, avoiding any misstep. Day and night, someone must keep watch. If her breath ceases entirely and her complexion remains unchanged—whether for a day or two, five or seven days, or even ten—she must not be disturbed. Only when her breath returns faintly and the light of her spirit begins to emerge may one call to her in a low voice. After she emerges from meditation, her food, clothing, and comforts should be provided as she wishes. Companions of the same path must remain constantly attentive, guarding her until the spirit has fully departed the body, at which point the danger will have passed.

**Eighth Rule: Moving the Spirit Beyond the Shell**
The female path proceeds from yin to yang, and when yang reaches its apex, the spirit becomes whole. Yet even when the body is as pure as an ice vessel and the spirit as clear as autumn waters, the spirit must not be allowed to linger too long within. Thus, when the melon ripens, it falls of its own accord; when the spirit is perfected, it naturally departs. At this time, one should employ the method of spirit projection, guiding the spirit beyond the body. However, the departure must not be too swift, nor should the initial excursions be overly prolonged, lest the spirit become lost and unable to return. The spirit should be withdrawn back into the body, moving in and out, beginning nearby and gradually extending farther. One must not be reckless; only when the spirit is fully matured may it be allowed free movement. Once mastery is achieved, there will be no fear. Yet the work of spirit projection requires careful consideration. Before the yang spirit emerges, its nature is utterly still, and the practice remains governed by the rules of nurturing the true. Only when the spirit is perfected does this stage conclude. After the yang spirit has emerged, its nature becomes dynamic, no longer resembling the prior phase of cultivation. One must then employ the method of liberating the spirit, allowing it to become luminous, unobstructed, and freely active. Whether wandering mountains and rivers or responding to circumstances with transformative manifestations, one should seize opportunities to perform meritorious deeds. When merit is complete and the work is fulfilled, there will come a day of ascension.

**Ninth Rule: Awaiting Ascension**
When the female elixir is perfected and a body of pure yang is cultivated, one is unbound and moves freely. Yet one must broadly perform virtuous deeds and plant good roots, never allowing the freedom of spirit projection to lead to neglect of the Dao’s fruition. One must not recklessly reveal the marvels of creation, nor deviate from the uprightness of heaven’s principle through perverse conduct. Such transgressions will surely invite retribution. Instead, one should subtly apply one’s powers to protect the nation and save the people. When merit and conduct are complete, high sages and perfected beings will naturally come to deliver one to ascension—ascending to the Golden Gates, receiving imperial decrees, and dwelling eternally in the celestial palace, where boundless joy awaits.

But why must female immortals await deliverance? Though their weak constitution has been refined through internal practice into a yang body, the residual yin essence has not yet been fully dissolved. They lack the final stage of returning to emptiness and have not fully mastered the wondrous transformations of heaven and earth. Thus, they cannot transcend the world on their own, for their bodily form remains insufficiently firm. This differs from the male body, which, when refined into an indestructible vajra form and the work of returning to emptiness is complete, becomes suffused with the radiance of spirit, filling heaven and earth. Therefore, men need not await deliverance to attain the Dao and achieve perfection, personally attending the Celestial Emperor and roaming the Penglai Isles.

*(Chen Yingning’s note: I cannot endorse this theory. I record it here merely as it stands. If a woman truly possesses great wisdom, great power, and great liberation, then at the pinnacle of her practice, she will advance further—seeing form and emptiness as non-dual, self and other as forgotten, her original nature radiant and transcending all beginnings. Only then will she realize that the mundane world and celestial palace are equal in suffering and joy, that yin and yang, though named differently, emerge from the same source. The ten directions and three realms do not lie beyond the Gate of the Mysterious Female; immortals, buddhas, and sentient beings all seek sustenance from the Mother. At this stage, what need is there to speak of awaiting ascension? "Emerge from the same source," "the Gate of the Mysterious Female," and "seek sustenance from the Mother" are phrases from Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*, each containing profound meaning.)*

**Tenth Rule: Attaining the Dao and Achieving Perfection**

The value of cultivation lies in transforming the mortal frame into a sacred vessel—without this, one remains no more than a frog at the bottom of a well, forever bound to the sea of karmic suffering, unable to escape the cycles of rebirth or transcend the turning of kalpas. If a woman in the world can maintain a heart unstained by even a speck of dust and a qi unbroken by a hundred setbacks, following her teacher’s oral instructions and cultivating in secret day and night, she may attain the fruit of the supreme vehicle in as little as three to five years. Why, then, should anyone shrink from such a path?

*(This passage has been substantially revised, as it consisted of empty rhetoric.)*

**Appendix: The Kun Formula**
*By Sun Bu’er, the Pure and Primordial Sovereign*
*Collated by Fu Jinquan, the Unitary Master*

True transmission has its secrets—true transmission has its secrets.
Women embody the yielding virtue of *kun*, yet within true yin resides true yang, making their cultivation comparatively effortless. The key lies in applying effort within *you* ("being"). *You* is the beginning of *wu* ("non-being"); from *you* to *wu* is the station of true yang. Though these two lines emphasize the work of *ming* (destiny/life-cultivation), they unite *xing* (nature) and *ming* in one, forming the foremost pivot of the *kun*-Way.

The first line requires returning to *wu* within *you*; the second, generating *you* within *wu*.
One must understand *geng* and *jia*—let the Confucian scholars expound upon this.
*Geng* and *jia* clarify the entry point for *ming*-work.
*Geng* is metal, the tiger; *jia* is wood, the dragon. *Geng*-metal is the foundation of refinement, while *jia*-wood constantly fears its restraint—yet within restraint lies the germ of life. Alchemists delight in seeking life within death: when the *geng*-tiger descends, the *jia*-dragon rises; in their descent and ascent, the mechanism of creation and destruction is embedded, and the principle of inversion becomes ever more real. Knowing this moment of creation and destruction, of inversion, one applies the method to sever the dragon’s head and lead the tiger by its tail, ensuring the dragon does not summon clouds nor the tiger stir winds. When wind and clouds subside, the sky clears and the moon shines bright; when dragon and tiger are subdued, nature and emotion harmonize. Returning to the furnace to refine, the millet-pearl is immediately formed—no method of preserving life surpasses this.

The word "know" implies quiet observation and vigilant guarding. When the wind threatens to rise, one must seize the tiger; when rain is about to fall, one may sever the dragon—neither too soon nor too late, striking at the opportune moment to forge and temper. Without understanding this principle, one has no means to learn the Dao. Only by integrating it with the study of the classics can one avoid falling into emptiness.

Beneath the study of the *Doctrine of the Mean*, one attains the turning phrase—this is seeing the Dao. The principles of governance must be investigated, the nature-school thoroughly penetrated; one cultivates both nature and life, joining yin and yang. The elixir path is contained within the *Book of Changes*. The *Tuan* says: "Supreme is the primal power of Kun! All things rely upon it to come into being." Kun belongs to old yin; when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born. Following heaven, it gives life to humans and creatures; following the self, it completes the Dao and realizes the true. Carefully examining where true yang arises within Kun, one knows where the true One is produced within the body. Seeking and securing this One, the treasure of life is made whole.

The work of nature is the beginning and end of entering the Dao. If one does not thoroughly penetrate nature, this treasure cannot abide constantly. It must be like the autumn moon in serene meditation, unstained by the slightest dust. When the beginning of no-beginning is already clear, and the non-empty emptiness is all-pervading freedom, then nature and life are dually cultivated, yin and yang joined.

One must teach others to discern keenly between being and non-being, not to squander a heart full of ardor. Yin and yang are precisely being and non-being. One must attend carefully to the treasury of scriptures: in three days, the coming of true yang and the going of true yin will both be orderly. The head of the incoming dragon may be severed, the tail of the departing tiger retained. When the two qi intermingle in harmonious union, the dharma-body is formed. Otherwise, one merely exhausts heart and blood—how can one refine and cultivate?

The mechanism lies before one’s eyes; qi is drawn forth from here. Above is the heavenly valley, below the spring cave. Fix attention on these two places without the slightest deviation. At the critical moment, it is essential to begin with the eyes and initiate intent, with intent initiate qi, with qi condense spirit, with spirit refine the true. Communing with heaven and earth, there is nowhere it does not work. If the heavenly valley does not grow warm, qi does not ascend; if the bubbling spring does not grow warm, qi does not descend. One must direct the eyes and intent to focus, applying effort above and below to guide it. Fix attention on the two cavities without the slightest error. Practicing at midnight and noon, over time one becomes proficient, then proceeds to refinement. Timely realization and diligent cultivation will naturally yield yellow sprouts and white snow.

*(Yingning’s note: "Yellow sprouts and white snow" are originally proper terms in external alchemy. Here, they are used as metaphors for internal alchemy. On this point, I cannot refrain from speaking. Consulting the *Secret Formula of Golden Medicine* by the Ancestor of Fuli in Chapter Seven: "Purple powder like frost, yellow sprouts filling the room." Xu the True Man’s *Stone Casket Record* in the *Purple Mother Treatise* says: "One crucible of cinnabar can be ingested; long ingestion reverses yang and changes the bones, reversing yang and changing bones to become an immortal. It requires divine talismans and white snow. Great indeed is the divine talisman, true white snow—it revives the dead and brings Xu Jia back to life." Also, the *Stone Casket Record* in the *Luminous Roundness of the Divine Chamber Treatise* says: "Each and every grain, true pearls red; red blossoms and purple veins give birth to the golden lord. When the golden lord, water, and earth combine, refining yields yellow sprouts that become white snow. Purple sand and red powder drift about; drifting about is the green dragon’s cream. When red powder is scarce and the white tiger aged, refining yields dragon’s cream and tiger’s brain. In the Hall of Longevity, it is the wish-fulfilling jewel. To transmute ten thousand taels of gold is nothing—it can transmute the feeble old man to eternal youth." Observing the above, red blossoms, purple veins, yellow sprouts, white snow, red powder, and purple sand—these terms all refer to tangible substances produced in the external alchemical furnace. They have these forms, can be seen with the eyes, held in the hands, and swallowed into the belly, hence called the golden elixir. Later cultivators, failing to receive the true transmission—or even if they did, guarding it as a secret and not daring to make it public—transformed it so that the coalescence of essence, qi, and spirit within the human body was called the golden elixir. This already deviates from the ancient immortals’ methods, though there are still traces to seek. In a second transformation, they further appropriated Buddhist terms like true suchness, perfect enlightenment, and the wondrous mind of nirvana, as well as Confucian terms like the Ultimate of Non-being, the Supreme Ultimate, heavenly principle, and innate knowledge, all indiscriminately applied to the golden elixir. Thus, later students of immortality fell into a fog, utterly bewildered, growing ever more confused. The art of transmuting mercury into gold, which the Chinese would not disclose, has been lost and later discovered by foreigners. The medicine of immortality, which the Chinese dare not acknowledge, may yet be seized first by outsiders. For a nation of five thousand years, the most ancient civilization, and a race of four hundred million civilized people, to forget their heritage and seek the Dao in foreign lands—how lamentable!)*
