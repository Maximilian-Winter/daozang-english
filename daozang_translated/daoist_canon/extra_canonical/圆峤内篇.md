*Daoist Poems on the Method of Gathering the Heart for Self-Consolation*
*Editor’s Preface*

*The* Fanghu Waishi *(Outer History of the Square Flask)* is the title of works by Lu Qianxu of the Eastern Lineage. *The* Yuanqiao Neipian *(Inner Chapters of the Round Peaks)*, then, is the title of works by Li Hanxu of the Western Lineage. Thus was established the opposing stance of East and West, and thus too was the Dao of their shared inheritance determined. The Western Star (Lu Qianxu’s alternate name, Lu Xixing, also called Chang Geng) and the Western Moon (Li Hanxu’s courtesy name, Tuanyang, also called Li Xiyue) illuminated one another, their radiance resplendent—how could this be mere chance?

Yet within the Daoist lineages, all know only of the *Fanghu Waishi* in circulation, while none are aware of the publication of the *Yuanqiao Neipian*. Why is this? For no other reason than that disciples and compilers of the Western Lineage failed to grasp the original intent behind the Patriarch Li’s writings. Lacking systematic organization, each piece bore its own title, and so the overarching name *Yuanqiao Neipian* was entirely submerged, its traces all but lost.

Master Chen Yingning, the late president of the Daoist Association, wrote prolifically with profound insight, yet even he was not immune to the irony of "seeking the ox while riding it," lamenting in his works *Daoqiao Tan* (*Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures*), *Sanche Mizhi* (*Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*), and *Yuanqiao Neipian* that they had never been published and that he had not even seen a manuscript. The eminent scholar Li Daoshan, in his *Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu*, likewise noted: "(The Patriarch) received the mandate of the Three Perfected Ones and composed *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures of the Most High*, *Elucidations on the Scripture of the Great Cavern Elder Immortal*, and two commentaries on *The Song of the Rootless Tree*... all of which were published. However, *The Inner Chapters of the Round Peaks*, *The Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures* remain unpublished." Alas!

Little did they realize the principle of correspondence between the two works—external alignment and internal alignment as inevitable complements. I racked my brains, exhaustively studying the classics, yet could not reconcile the discrepancy. Given the full title’s symmetry of inner and outer, how could it be that a monumental work of such grandeur had vanished without a trace, never to be published? Reluctantly, I turned again to *Hanxu Mizhi* (*Secret Essentials of Hanxu*, a volume in the *Eastern Daoist Cultivation Library*). By chance, while poring over the preface to *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures of the Most High*, I grasped the key. The preface was written by the Three Recluses of Mount Shu, who concealed their true names. It reads:

"One day, while wandering among Daoist temples, I came upon several volumes of the *Yuanqiao Waishi* (initially intended to parallel the Eastern Patriarch’s *Fanghu Waishi* and thus also called *Outer History*; later revised to *Inner Chapters* for symmetry, though it is the same work). Among them was *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures*, with the commentary on the *Daode Jing* being the most exhaustive. Appended was *Xuntu Jiu Ceng* (*Nine Layers of the Path*). Though brief, these few words suffice to reveal its essence and resolve the enigma."

I then examined the preface by Master Pure Yang, which states:

"Hanxuzi was a transcendent talent... Upon hearing the teachings, he immediately gained insight and, roused by his own abilities, composed the *Yuanqiao Waishi* as a counterpart to Lu’s work. Thus, where Lu has *Xuanfu Lun* (*On the Subtleties of the Mysterious*), this work has *Daoqiao Tan*; where Lu has *Jiuzheng Pian* (*Seeking Rectification*), this has *Xuntu Shuo* (*Discourse on the Path*). Most wondrous of all is the commentary on the *Daode Jing*, which serves as an eternal beacon, titled *Donglai Zhengyi* (*Eastern Advent of Right Meaning*), on par with Lu’s *Nanhua Fumo* (*Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence*)."

Reading this, I could not help but clap in admiration, for at last the truth became clear. Thus, I have compiled the Patriarch Li’s various works into a single volume.

Herein it is rightfully titled *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao*, fulfilling the long-cherished wish of Patriarch Li. Some say that the Western Patriarch Li Xiyue was the reincarnation of the Eastern Patriarch Lu Xixing. In the *Records of Spiritual Resonance* shown to me by Li, he himself did not deny this. Thus, history may cycle, human nature may reappear, and images may repeat. Reading the "Three True Poems" in the *Eastern Advent of Right Meaning*, how can one not marvel at the wonder!

Among them, Lu Xixing’s poem reads:
*"A single commentary can unlock the profound mysteries of the Dao,
Once more the purple qi arrives from the East.
Strumming the zither, playing the flute—a true scholar,
Expounding the Dharma, discoursing on sutras—a master of eloquence.
I dwell in Square Pot, gazing upon the vast sea,
You ascend Yuanqiao, overshadowing Penglai.
Today, seated together by the riverside pavilion,
Reciting the *Nanhua*, we laugh at our own folly."*

Is this praise for Li? Or self-aggrandizement? For two men—or one? The ancient Buddhas manifest in countless forms; Zhuangzi’s coffin was split once, twice, thrice. This startled the courage of the Tian clan of old—where now is the Prince of Chu?

My aspiration is to emulate the Three Recluses: I shall carry only this commentary on the *Daode Jing* and the *Ninefold Layer* chapter, singing long songs among cliffs and valleys, their echoes drowning the clouds over the streams. I shall forget my name and age—this is my preface.

**Volume One: Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures**
By Changyi Mountain Recluse Li Hanxu
Collated by Chen Yingning of Wanjian

**Reader’s Guide to *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures***

1. The author of this work is surnamed Li, named Xiyue, styled Hanxu, and also known as Tuanyang. A native of Leshan, Sichuan, he attained the Dao in the bingchen year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing dynasty.

2. In China’s tradition of immortals’ Dao, there were originally two schools: the Southern and Northern. The Southern School began with Zhang Ziyang of Tiantai, Zhejiang, and the Northern School with Wang Chongyang of Zhongnan, Shaanxi. By the Jiajing era of the Ming, Lu Qianxu wrote the *Outer History of Square Pot*, greatly expounding the subtle Daoist winds, and was known as the Eastern School. The author of this work, Li Hanxu, was collectively regarded as the Western School. The Western School’s lineage transmission bears nine characters: *The Western Dao is universal; the great river flows east; the sea and sky are boundless.*

3. Zhang Ziyang received the elixir method from an extraordinary figure in Chengdu but did not disclose his identity. At the same time, Wang Chongxi encountered Liu Haichan, who transmitted the oral formula of the Golden Elixir. Chongxi once remarked that no Daoist in the world could comprehend it except Zhang Pingshu. Thus, Lu Yanfu concluded that Ziyang must have also received transmission from Haichan. Haichan was a disciple of Zhongli Quan, the True Man of Zhengyang, and a fellow student of Lü Zu. Wang Chongyang’s collected works also refer to *"Zhengyang as ancestor, Pure Yang as master, Haichan as uncle."* From this, it is evident that the Southern and Northern Schools share a common origin. Furthermore, Lu Qianxu of the Ming claimed to have met Lü Zu at the Grass Hall by the Northern Sea and personally heard the subtleties of the Dao. Li Hanxu of the Qing also encountered Lü Zu at a Chan monastery on Mount Emei, who secretly imparted the original sound. Thus, the four schools—Southern, Northern, Eastern, and Western—may all be considered transmissions from Lü Zu.

4. The Northern School’s practice emphasizes tranquility. Yet among the Seven Perfected, Liu Zu was renowned for cultivating in brothels, unlike the desolate sitting of the True Man of Everlasting Spring. The Southern School’s oral formulas emphasize yin and yang. Yet among the Five Ancestors, Bai Yuchan was ordained from childhood, wandering as a cloud and water for life, unlike the Chan master Daoguang, who returned to lay life. In expounding Daoist texts, Lu’s works are refined and pure, while Li’s are complex. In explaining the *Human-Primordial Elixir Method*, Lu’s account is simple, while Li’s is intricate. From this, one may see that while the Dao is the same, methods may differ in skill. Though methods may align, oral instructions may vary in simplicity or complexity. It is for the scholar to harmonize and comprehend them, not to impose self-limitation.

5. Zhang Ziyang attained the Dao during the Xining era of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, approximately 830 years before the founding of the Republic. Wang Chongyang attained the Dao during the Dading era of Emperor Shizong of the Jin, approximately 740 years before the Republic. Lu Qianxu attained the Dao during the Longqing era of Emperor Muzong of the Ming, approximately 340 years before the Republic. Li Hanxu attained the Dao during the Xianfeng era of the Qing, approximately 60 years before the Republic.

6. Li Hanxu’s works include *Annotations on the Thirteen Classics of the Supreme*, *Annotations on the Daoist Ballad of the Rootless Tree*, and the compiled and edited *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*, all of which have long circulated widely. Only *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures*, *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao* remain unpublished, and even the manuscript of *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao* has not been seen. Now, *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures* and *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles* are published first to satisfy the longing of those devoted to the Dao.

7. This book is a hand-copied manuscript from the collection of Mao Fuchu of Fujian, personally brought to Shanghai by Deng Yucang of Liancheng, Fujian, who entrusted its collation and publication to me. The costs of typesetting, printing, binding, and paper were jointly advanced by Deng Yucang and Zhang Zhuming through arrangements with the Alchemical Scripture Engraving Society. Only now can this work meet its readers—Mao, Deng, and Zhang have rendered no small service.

8. This book has been corrected by me in approximately several dozen places, all of which were errors from successive transcriptions.

The errors herein lie merely in whether the phrasing is coherent or not, not in whether the theories are sound or flawed. The implications are relatively minor, so there is no need to compose a separate collation record, lest it occupy excessive space.

9. At the time, Master Deng urged me to extract the essential points of this book for the benefit of readers. In my humble opinion, terms long customary in alchemical scriptures—such as *li* and *kan*, mercury and lead—are all figurative expressions. They may refer to the heart and kidneys, to spirit and *qi*, or even to male and female; it rests with the reader to delve deeply and grasp their meaning. Were one to insist on equating a given term with a specific entity, opinions would diverge along lines of wisdom and folly, and disputes over right and wrong would never cease. I fear this might inadvertently narrow the book’s scope of application, contravening the original intent of dissemination—better to leave it be.

10. The most illuminating phrase in this book is “the other household.” For instance, Chapter Three states: *“To nourish my own mercury, one must employ the true lead of the other household.”* Chapter Five says: *“In inner refinement of the self, one uses the lead of the other household to nourish the mercury of my household. In inner cultivation of the self, one likewise uses the lead of the other household to nourish the mercury of my household.”* Chapter Eight declares: *“This lead is not the lead of returning elixir; it is the true fire of the other household.”* Chapter Ten observes: *“When the original root leaks away, essence, *qi*, and spirit all fall into the postnatal. If one cannot seek it within oneself, one must seek it in the other.”* Chapter Seventeen notes: *“Original essence resides in my household; true essence resides in the other household.”* Chapter Eighteen states: *“The embodiment of supreme virtue, amply endowed by Heaven, need not seek it in the other household—hence it is called the Heavenly Origin.”* Chapter Twenty-Five says: *“I direct a speck of yin-fire essence to plant within the other household.”* And Chapter Twenty-Nine explains: *“Gathering and refining means gathering the yang lead of the other household to refine the *qi* of the child-pearl in my household.”* From the examples above, the references to “the other household” are indeed thorough. Yet precisely how to interpret these two words remains open to inquiry. If “the other household” refers to the *qi* within the kidneys, then those who refine only the spirit in the heart are mistaken. If it refers to the Great Void beyond the body, then those who refine only the spirit in the heart are likewise mistaken. If it refers to a partner of the opposite sex, then solitary practitioners devoted solely to meditation are mistaken. Readers must focus on these profoundly subtle points to truly perceive the Way in all its manifestations.

Written on the birthday of the Hundred Flowers in the mid-spring of the *dingchou* year of the Republic of China (1937), by Chen Yingning of Wanjiang, at the Abode of Myriad Wonders in Shanghai’s western outskirts.

**Preface by Zhang**
My late great-uncle, Master Jingchuan, was fond of cinnabar arts, originally intending only to cultivate *qi* and refine his nature. As his understanding of the Dao deepened, he grew ever more inspired and diligent. He cherished every book on this path, preserving them all. Some were printed editions, others hand-copied—countless volumes, all sources of daily delight. In the late spring of *xinhai* (1931), as his final hour approached, he summoned my elder brother, Bochun, and said: *“What I have always loved are these few books on the Dao. When I die, take care to preserve them. In ten years, someone will come to claim them—do not begrudge them.”*

Before the appointed time arrives, do not lightly neglect cultivation. This is my final testament—pray do not forget it!”

Though still a child, I too once heard these words. After my elder brother passed away, my younger brother Zhongkuan aired the books, and some, already gnawed by insects, had gone unnoticed. By chance, I came upon them and intended to make a fresh copy to serve as a future master text. Just as I began, my friend Liu Xuanfu paid a visit. Seeing the books, he asked, “Are you also tending to the Dao?”

I explained my purpose, and he exclaimed, “Excellent! This endeavor of yours. I, too, have long cherished these books, though none have guided me in correcting their errors. Now, seeing your late uncle’s original copies—all distilled to essentials, refined from the obscure to the luminous—I am so delighted I cannot contain myself. Might I borrow a copy to transcribe? And if I make an extra one to share your labor, how would that be?”

I had originally wished to keep them private, but recalling my uncle’s words—that when someone came to claim them, they should be handed over without hesitation—how could I begrudge lending a single copy, especially when he offered to transcribe an additional one as a gift? This volume is his transcription. From now on, the preservation of these books—is this not the aid of Xuanfu? And if Xuanfu indeed perfects his learning—is this not the fulfillment of the “ten years hence”? My uncle began it, my friend completed it, and I sit to enjoy the fruits—could anything be easier?

Thus, I set down these beginnings and ends to record them.

Respectfully inscribed by Zhang Richang of Meigao.

Should any virtuous man or faithful woman, moved by good intention, undertake to publish and disseminate these two works—*Talks on the Dao’s Apertures* and *The Secret Essence of the Three Vehicles*—though they themselves may not cultivate in this life, may the Patriarchal Sovereign of Blessed Instruction and the Perfected Lord of Benevolent Teachings, in the life to come, guide them through manifold means, patiently enlighten them, and lead them to renounce the mundane and enter the Dao, escaping the sea of suffering and ascending the ranks of immortality. Should anyone study these two books in depth, pondering their subtleties and putting them into practice, the two Patriarchs will surely uplift them in secret, even in this very life. Though they may not attain the rank of Great Golden Immortal, they shall certainly be spared the torments of rebirth.

Those who print and distribute these two books to fellow seekers, illuminating the great path and sparing them from heterodox and demonic ways, shall see their nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and their descendants shall never bear offspring of evil or lust.

Respectfully added by Zhang Richang of Meigao.

**Chapter One: Admonition to Fellow Practitioners**

Deep in the night, seated in meditation—tranquil and natural.
On a rope bed or bamboo couch, cross-legged at the fifth watch.
Having sat, one rises again, at ease and content.
Thus, what has been attained is recorded by lamplight, and I say to my friends:

When the night’s qi is clear and the breath is regulated, the spirit abides.
If one regulates as it is regulated, one avoids the pitfall of dull emptiness.
If one abides as it abides, one avoids the trap of clinging.
At such a time, neither forgetting nor forcing—seeming to forget, seeming to retain.
Silent yet alert, perfectly round and luminous.
Water naturally clears, fire naturally arises, spirit naturally merges, qi naturally converges, wind naturally aligns, the cart naturally moves, withdrawal naturally withdraws, advance naturally advances, addition naturally adds, retreat naturally retreats.
Only because this wondrous attainment is uniquely grasped does one wield control as if by heart—drowsiness naturally departs, distraction naturally gathers.
Could anything be more joyous?

Yet to shun the lamp and feign sleep—I cannot bear to see it; it rests with your own discipline.
To lean on the desk and pretend wakefulness—I dare not partake in it; it rests with your own faith.
To close the eyes and indulge in thoughts—I cannot know it; it rests with your own elimination.
Those who succumb to drowsiness in the clear night are not diligent in this practice.
Those who fall into distraction in the clear night are not devoted to this practice.
Lacking diligence and devotion, one betrays the profound hopes of the Patriarchs.
Our Dao is most wondrous and mysterious; those afflicted by such faults must amend them.

**Chapter Two: Dialogue on Opening the Passes**

Several friends asked Tuanyangzi:
“Your discourse on nothingness may be called pure, authentic, and lucid—opening the apertures of the gateway. Yet I do not understand why the Sun Tao school holds that ‘opening the passes and expanding the apertures’ should occur *before* foundation-laying, while Master Qianxu claims the ancient immortals never spoke of it, and now it has arisen. They further say, ‘Adding a snake’s leg is superfluous; a steed’s bones are priceless. The peril of the Great Dao lies in such men.’ Thus, they deem ‘opening the passes and expanding the apertures’ contemptible. Since you share the same teacher, I beg you to explain.”

Tuanyangzi replied:
“Alas! What Master Qianxu spoke of was not contempt, but lament for those unfortunate ones who have lost their primordial purity, compelling them to resort to such minor techniques. The virtue of the lower grade is effortless, not sought through scrutiny. A child whose primordial qi remains unbroken may cultivate purity and attain the immortal embryo without need of return or reversal—why open the passes? Thus, this is deemed a peril to the Great Dao. It is akin to the lament of the Most High: ‘When the Great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise.’

Yet our generation takes saving others as its merit. Of those who transmit these teachings, how many retain the purity of childhood? Thus, expanding the apertures and opening the passes serve to unlock the mystery and clear the path, while returning to the origin and reverting to the root aid our kind and restore the true body. For those who begin the Dao in middle age, as long as they concentrate the spirit with method, regulate the breath with measure, and when the yin heel qi stirs, draw it into the crucible—neither forgetting nor forcing—then when the postnatal qi arises, they refine it again. The true mechanism will move of itself. Seizing its movement to guide it, one need not force the opening, for the pass opens naturally; one need not force the expansion, for the aperture expands naturally. Once the true qi ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, the path of the River Cart may be traversed. All occurs of itself, naturally.

Seizing the moment between movement and stillness, one gently stokes the fire, driving it past the Tailbone Pass and reversing its flow to the Heavenly Valley. Naturally, essence is refined into qi, irrigating the Three Palaces. Thereafter, having obtained the wondrous medicine from without, one captures and restrains the true qi of the body, causing it to congeal without scattering. Then, in mutual affection and longing, like a dragon nurturing its pearl or a hen brooding her egg, the warmth unbroken, they settle together in the Yellow Court, coalescing into a cinnabar orange—this is called the ‘inner elixir.’ Thus, the work of the first stage is complete, the marvel of longevity attained, and the Way of preserving the form perfected.”

Upon hearing this, the friend rejoiced and said, “Without your words, I would have nearly lost myself in longing. Though we are not quick of wit, we shall withdraw and cultivate accordingly.”

**Chapter Three: An Exegesis on the Postnatal Methods**

Of old, the postnatal methods were divided into only two stages: laying the foundation and refining the self. Yet Master Tao Cuncun further observed, “If a cultivator of the Dao does not first open the passes before hastily speaking of laying the foundation and refining the self, it is like scratching an itch from outside the boot—of no benefit whatsoever.” Thus, he divided the postnatal sequence into four stages: opening the passes, laying the foundation, obtaining the medicine, and refining the self.

Fearing that others might harbor doubts, I have composed this to clarify: the ancient division into two stages represents the broad outlines of the postnatal path, while the present division into four stages delineates its finer progression. Opening the passes clears the way for laying the foundation; obtaining the medicine supplies what the foundation requires; and refining the self completes the work of laying the foundation. Though four stages are now distinguished, they remain two in essence, and those two are ultimately one.

As the ancients said, “Subtle details and fine points cannot be transmitted except by a true teacher, nor spoken of except by a worthy disciple.” Though laying the foundation and refining the self do not belong to the highest alchemy, their finer stages exceed even what Master Tao described. The *Cantong Qi* states, “The inferior virtue practices it without ceasing.” Precisely because it does not cease, one perceives its many stages.

Divergent teachings abound, and differing views arise, but all depend on the practitioner’s capacity for synthesis. The Perfected Sun Jiaoluan said, “Those who cultivate the body must first employ the crucible to open the passes.” He also said, “The crucible is the numinous father and numinous mother.” Why are the numinous father and numinous mother called the crucible? Because the parents who give birth to immortals and buddhas differ from ordinary parents, and so they are named the numinous father and numinous mother of the postnatal crucible.

The numinous father and numinous mother unite in reverse flow, whereas ordinary parents join in forward motion to sustain life. The method of reverse flow is constant from beginning to end. Once the crucible is established, spirit and qi intermingle, and accumulation deepens. As accumulation deepens, vigor surges. When vigor surges, the passes expand. When the passes expand, the path of reverse circulation opens, and the route of the River Chariot is traversed.

Yet moving the River Chariot is not the same as opening the passes. Opening the passes relies on postnatal true qi, while the River Chariot relies on postnatal metal and water. When the work reaches the stage of the River Chariot, the daily tasks of laying the foundation and refining the self become indistinguishable.

Qianxu said, “With ceaseless circulation and irrigation, over time it becomes perfectly refined. Qi fills the Three Fields, and above and below harmonize. This is what is meant by ‘constantly allowing qi to surge through and penetrate the joints, naturally filling the valley spirit with essence.’”

I have often called the study of the postnatal path “nurturing the self.” If one carefully examines my words and fathoms its comprehensive stages, the Way of prolonging life and preserving the body will be attained.

What is nurturing the self? The *Cantong Qi* states, “Within, nurture the self in tranquil emptiness.” This is the essential teaching of the postnatal path. The self is one’s inherent nature, the primordial spirit. Within refers to the inner realm, the state of emptiness. In emptiness, there is constant tranquility and peace; only when at peace can one deliberate, and only when tranquil can one respond.

Yet to still the spirit, one must regulate the breath with measure. One exhalation and one inhalation are called a single breath. It must follow its natural course, yet not be left entirely to its own devices. Zhuangzi said, “The true person breathes from the heels.” The heels signify unbroken continuity, an unceasing, subtle presence. Qi penetrates the Bubbling Spring, flowing without interruption.

My teacher said, “Let the inner breath follow the outer breath, and the outer breath follow the inner breath, breath after breath following breath after breath.” This is the subtlety of following the heels. When the inner breath exhales, the outer breath inhales; when the inner breath inhales, the outer breath exhales. Inner and outer breaths, reversing and aligning, generate one another. With measured opening and closing, a wondrous spontaneity arises, requiring no forced effort.

The ancients said, “If one asks how to begin laying the foundation, first understand the mysterious pass of the bellows.” To know the inner breath is to know the bellows. The alchemists say, “Exhale without passing the throat; inhale to return to the root.” This refers to the inner breath. How could mouth and nose breathing prevent it from passing?

Once the breath is regulated, one must also concentrate the spirit. Concentrating the spirit means remaining utterly still, inwardly illuminating the body. Yet this concentration of spirit and regulation of breath are not two separate practices. Regulating the breath gathers the spirit; gathering the spirit awakens awareness; awakened awareness generates qi; and qi, thus generated, is inwardly gathered and stilled. The golden crucible daily fills, primordial yellow and true lead unite, true qi surges into the heart, and is drawn to the Tailbone Pass. With a single thrust, the Three Passes open, the path of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl is revealed, and the Silver River may be drawn.

Yet the Way of nurturing the self is vast indeed. It encompasses regulating the breath, concentrating the spirit, gathering qi, and piercing the passes, while also including the work of laying the foundation and refining the self.

Shangyang said, “Treasure essence and enrich qi—this is nurturing the self. Face circumstances without attachment—this is refining the self.” Nurturing the self aids refining the self from within, while refining the self eliminates external distractions to nurturing the self. To refine the self without nurturing the self makes the elixir foundation difficult to complete. To nurture the self without refining the self makes the mercury nature difficult to stabilize. Together, nurturing the self and refining the self are one and the same Way.

Yet to nurture one’s own mercury, one must employ the other family’s true lead—the prior-heaven within the postnatal, the metal and water within the postnatal, the state of having qi without form. When true lead first arises, it steams between the two kidneys, and one immediately mobilizes the River Chariot to refine it, ascending from the Tailbone Pass to the Heavenly Valley, pouring sweet dew to return to the Yellow Court, sprinkling and irrigating the Three Palaces, using lead to restrain mercury. When qi transforms into fluid and retreats the yin tally, the flowing pearl no longer escapes.

When fluid transforms into qi and advances the yang fire, the River Chariot rises once more.

Moreover, refining one’s nature and cultivating the mind, externally eliminating worldly distractions, dwelling concealed amidst the marketplace, harmonizing one’s light with the vulgar—thus both body and mind become settled, and the inner mercury solidifies. Only then may one seek the eight ounces of prior-heaven to pair with the half-catty of postnatal, and the Reverted Elixir may be attained.

**Chapter Four: Laying the Foundation and Refining the Self**

Laying the foundation and refining the self—these two are one. Yet there are minor and major foundations, external and internal refinement of the self. One must not be ignorant of this.

What is the minor foundation? Drawing primordial yang into the inner crucible, sustaining embryonic breathing, then generating the postnatal medicine and performing the jade refinement. This is what the Sun Tao school calls "once the foundation is laid, one dares to obtain the medicine; once the inner medicine congeals, one dares to refine the self."

What is the major foundation? Nurturing the spirit pearl to produce external lead, with metal and water flowing abundantly, diligently practicing the marvels of the Celestial Cycle to complete the work of perfecting one’s nature. This is what the *Collected Explanations* refers to as "opening the passes to pave the foundation’s path, obtaining the medicine to supply the foundation’s needs, and refining the self to conclude the foundation’s work."

Internal refinement of the self concerns the work of the River Chariot and the jade fluid’s efficacy—this is the *Can Tong Qi*’s discourse on "internally nurturing the self." External refinement of the self means all phenomena are empty, not a speck of dust clings—this is the ancient teaching of "forgetting emotions when facing circumstances."

In essence, internal refinement is the major foundation, and the major foundation is nurturing the self. Nurturing the self still aids internal refinement, and internal refinement still requires external refinement. All elixir scriptures interweave the three and five, their words differing but their substance the same. Thus I say: laying the foundation and refining the self are one and two. May scholars skillfully comprehend this.

**Chapter Five: Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self**

I previously stated that nurturing the self is the internal aid to refining the self, while refining the self removes the external disturbances to nurturing the self. This was provisionally distinguished for clarity, not to imply they are unrelated.

Yet there are indeed differences. External refinement of the self begins with refining in the face of circumstances, which differs from internal refinement and even from external nurturing of the self. Why? External refinement of the self refines the heart-mind to stabilize it. When the heart-mind is settled, the body is settled; when the body is settled, sensual desires cannot sway it, nor can wealth and profit dazzle it. Only then can true mercury be preserved, and the elixir’s foundation secured.

As for internal refinement of the self, it shares similarities with internal nurturing of the self. In elixir scriptures, refining the self means smelting mercury into cinnabar. Master Tao says: "Refining the self is not mere empty refinement." Shangyang says: "Cultivating the elixir is easy; refining the self is most difficult." The self here refers to the true fire of one’s mercury. One must first refine this true fire, subdue this true dragon, and command it at will, preventing it from bolting—only then can one subjugate the white tiger and obtain the true gold of the supreme treasure. Thus refining the self originally involves effort.

This effortful refinement of the self is internal refinement of the self, which is also internal nurturing of the self. Internal refinement of the self uses the other family’s lead to refine one’s own mercury, causing them to restrain and generate each other. Internal nurturing of the self also employs the other family’s lead to nurture one’s own mercury, enabling them to support and guard each other. Hence their shared meaning.

**Chapter Six: Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self**
*(This chapter transmits the oral teachings of the Western School, renaming "laying the foundation" as "nurturing the self"—though the name differs, the principle remains the same.)*

Nurturing the self and refining the self form a continuous practice. Nurturing the self means treasuring essence and enriching qi—this is laying the foundation. Refining the self means forgetting emotions when facing circumstances—this is completing one’s nature.

Must refining the self precede nurturing the self, or does nurturing the self first supply refinement? When essence and qi are cultivated, the earth of the self grows ever more solid and thick—hence the character *foundation* (基) is derived from earth (土). Thus laying the foundation is nurturing the self. When emotions and circumstances are tempered, the heart-mind of the self grows ever clearer and undying—hence the character *nature* (性) is derived from heart (心). Thus completing one’s nature must begin with refining the self.

Though nurturing the self requires essence and qi, essence is guarded internally while qi comes from without. To strengthen one’s guard, one must employ the self; to await its arrival, one must employ the self. The Way of nurturing the self thus demands tranquility as its work.

I distinguish two paths for nurturing the self: self-nurturing and mutual nurturing. Mutual nurturing pertains to essence and qi; self-nurturing pertains to tranquility.

Though refining the self occurs amidst emotions and circumstances, emotions are inwardly attenuated while circumstances are outwardly emptied. When one is naturally content, the self must have something to delight in; when one is unburdened, the self must have something to uphold. The Way of refining the self thus demands both movement and stillness.

I distinguish two aspects of refining the self: internal refinement and external refinement. External refinement is harmonizing one’s light with the vulgar; internal refinement is smelting mercury into cinnabar.

A gatha says:
*To know the true path of cultivation,*
*First practice these two endeavors.*
*Clarifying nurturing and refining the self,*
*Helps one better read the immortal scriptures.*

The *Scripture* states: "The inner heart should be alive; the outer heart should be dead." To enliven the inner heart, one must internally nurture the self. To extinguish the outer heart, one must externally refine the self. This is how I elucidate internal nurturing and external refinement of the self.

**Chapter Seven: The Postnatal Sequence**

After the initial foundation, the postnatal serves as the marvelous function. Yet there is a postnatal that can be used, and one that cannot. The unusable postnatal does not even deserve the name—being utterly yin and turbid, it is unworthy of mention. Here, I discuss only the usable postnatal in sequence:

First, the postnatal;
Second, the prior-heaven within the postnatal;
Third, the prior-heaven;
Fourth, the prior-heaven within the prior-heaven.

The postnatal is the qi of the Yin Heel Vessel, the root of human life, which, when first stirred, becomes primordial essence. The practitioner strikes the bamboo to summon it, drawing it into the inner crucible, where it naturally refines essence into qi and opens the passes. This qi surges through the five viscera, suffuses the hundred bones, coils through the meridians, and returns to the Cinnabar Field. With concentrated spirit and regulated breath, one awaits the movement of the mechanism. When the mechanism stirs and the flute sounds, a single thread ascends—this is the prior-heaven within the postnatal. It is gathered with the sword, tuned with the zither, circulated with the River Chariot, and sealed in the Yellow Court—this is the work of refining the self with jade liquid. With long and thorough practice, body and mind become steadfast; only then does one enter the chamber and approach the furnace to seek the prior-heaven. This prior-heaven is the primordial ancestral qi. First, one establishes the furnace and crucible by setting the true yin and true yang—kindred, sentient substances—each weighing eight ounces. Using the true qi of this furnace and crucible as a dharmic image, one revolves it through the celestial cycles to lure out the prior-heaven and immediately seize it. In less than half a quarter-hour, it coalesces into a single grain, adhering to the crucible—this is the lead mother, called the external elixir. The prior-heaven within the prior-heaven is so named because yang is born within lead, and the curtain’s light shines through. One gathers this most true yang qi to capture and subdue the essence-qi of one’s own body—this is what is meant by “When gold returns to the original nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir.” Thereafter, one nurtures and stabilizes it, daily revolving the yin tally and yang fire. By nurturing and fostering it, it transforms into the substance of golden liquid. Swallowing it into the five viscera is called the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. After ingestion, it coalesces into the sacred embryo. With ten months of work complete, the yang spirit manifests. Beyond the reach of the five phases, one is titled a true immortal. To further ascend, one faces the wall for nine years—this is called refining the spirit to return to emptiness. Facing the wall means that within the moment, a ten-thousand-fathom cliff stands before one, untouched by worldly dust—it is not merely sitting facing a wall. The nine years refer to the nine revolutions. With the work of nine revolutions deepened, one attains a hundred million transformation bodies.

**Chapter Eight: The Inner and Outer Medicines**

The inner medicine serves to complete one’s nature; the outer medicine is needed to complete one’s destiny. For the practitioner to fulfill nature and destiny, one must first cultivate the inner medicine and then the outer medicine. This inner medicine is half a catty of mercury; this outer medicine is eight ounces of lead. One must first gather the outer medicine to capture the inner medicine. This outer medicine is the qi of the kidneys; this inner medicine is the essence of the heart. The postnatal work concludes here. As for establishing nature and destiny, one must first rely on the inner medicine to plant the outer medicine. This inner medicine is mercury within cinnabar; this outer medicine is lead within water. One must first refine the outer medicine and then the inner medicine. This outer medicine is the qi of the elixir mother; this inner medicine is the sacred embryo. The prior-heaven work concludes here. Yet one must understand the dual use of inner and outer: which is the medicine, and which is the elixir? The inner elixir is true mercury, the earth of the self, which returns to the gate of *li*; with time, it is refined into wondrous cinnabar. The outer elixir is true lead, the earth of *wu*, concealed in the door of *kan*; with time, it manifests as beautiful golden blossoms. To congeal the inner elixir, one must first use lead to restrain mercury—this lead is not the lead of the Returned Elixir but the true fire of the other household. To refine the outer elixir, one must first use mercury to welcome lead—this lead is not the lead of the congealed elixir but the one qi of the prior-heaven. Thus, congealing the elixir differs from returning the elixir. Congealing means coagulation: taking the qi of the other household to coagulate the qi of one’s own household. The transformation occurs within the postnatal crucible, inseparable from the celestial fire-tending, and only then can one succeed. Returning means restoration: gathering the gold of *dui* to restore the gold of *qian*. The transformation occurs within the prior-heaven crucible, requiring the union of kindred yin and yang to achieve completion. Congealing the elixir completes the inner elixir; returning the elixir employs the outer elixir. The inner elixir is the yin elixir—mercury is originally yin within yang. The outer elixir is the yang elixir—lead is yang within yin. The earthly origin is the outer elixir, whose salvific and bestowing functions are all directed toward others. The human origin is the inner elixir, whose principles of nature and destiny are all directed toward the self. There is more one must know: the inner elixir is the inner medicine, yet the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is also called the inner medicine because its transformation occurs within. The outer elixir is the outer medicine, yet the Golden Elixir is also called the outer medicine because its transformation occurs without. This is the great elixir that encompasses both inner and outer. There is also what one must know: the outer elixir is the outer medicine, yet there is an outer medicine that has not yet become an elixir. When the great *kan* and *li* intersect, the River Chariot revolves, transforming qi into liquid, which descends to the Yellow Chamber—this is also called the outer medicine, though it has not yet become an elixir. The inner elixir is the inner medicine, yet there is an inner medicine that has not yet become an elixir. When one establishes the prior-heaven foundation, the Crimson Palace transforms liquid, which flows back to the primordial sea, and the liquid reverts to qi—this is also called the inner medicine, though it has not yet become an elixir. This is the work of purity and quiescence that encompasses both inner and outer. The distinctions between elixirs and medicines are fully recorded here for the learner’s benefit.

**Chapter Nine: The Resemblance of Medicinal Substances**

In the teachings of the prior-heaven and postnatal, the medicinal substances have layers that closely resemble one another, differing only in scale. Now, I will discuss those that resemble each other. The postnatal *kan* and *li* serve to lay the foundation of the elixir; the prior-heaven *kan* and *li* serve to establish the foundation of the elixir. The postnatal lead and mercury serve to congeal the minor elixir; the prior-heaven lead and mercury serve to return the great elixir. Three years of refining the self serve to complete one’s nature; nine years of facing the wall serve to complete one’s destiny. The postnatal *kan* and *li* refer to the union of original spirit and original qi to lay the foundation of the elixir, generating the minor medicine. The prior-heaven *kan* and *li* refer to the union of true yin and true yang to establish the foundation of the elixir (that is, the elixir mother), generating the great medicine.

Postnatal lead and mercury refer to the golden crucible refining the generated medicine—this medicine is external lead. The river chariot transports and restrains the flowing pearl—the flowing pearl is internal mercury. When lead and mercury constrain each other, the minor elixir is congealed. Prior-heaven lead and mercury refer to the union of like yin and yang to form *wu* earth—*wu* earth is external lead. Harmonizing the fire timing with *ji* earth—*ji* earth is internal mercury. When lead and mercury meet, the great elixir returns. During the refinement of the minor elixir, the abdomen feels warm and intoxicated. Then, borrowing the *zi-wu* cycle, one gradually gathers and congeals, causing lead to subdue mercury, forming yin cinnabar. After the great elixir congeals, the furnace glows with enduring redness. Then, borrowing the external furnace’s talismanic fire, diligently increasing and decreasing, one causes lead to dry and mercury to manifest, forming yang cinnabar.

Refining the self to complete one’s nature means nurturing yin cinnabar. Internally, one treasures essence and enriches qi; externally, one faces the mirror and forgets emotion—thus both body and mind are firmly established. "Three years" signifies the meaning of "three months without deviation." Facing the wall to complete one’s destiny means nurturing yang cinnabar. One must ensure both form and spirit are wondrous, truly shattering the void—thus transformations become boundless. "Nine years" signifies the meaning of the "ninefold great return."

**Chapter Ten: Mutual Nourishment of the Three Treasures**
The *Xinyin Jing* states: "The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence." These are the supreme treasures of cultivation. Their ceaseless generation and transformation mutually nourish one another—this is elucidated for the scholar. Practicing the Dao of reverse cultivation transforms essence into qi, and qi into spirit. Practicing the Dao of sequential cultivation generates spirit from qi, and qi from essence.

One asks: Why reverse refinement? Since the original root leaks, essence, qi, and spirit all fall into the postnatal. If one cannot seek them within, one must seek them without. Seeking them without is reverse refinement. Essence transforming into qi means this essence, residing in the yin heel vessel, reversely enters the purple palace to be refined—thus it transforms into qi. Qi transforming into spirit means this qi, residing in the yang furnace, reversely enters the yellow court to be refined—thus it transforms into spirit.

Though this reverse refinement begins with essence, the sequential refinement begins with spirit. The two have a mutual necessity and do not conflict. To reverse-refine original essence, one must first concentrate the spirit. When spirit is concentrated, qi gathers; when qi gathers, essence is generated. For when spirit and qi unite, they naturally produce celestial essence. This essence is the water of the celestial one, *ren* in *kan*, also called mother qi or external essence. The practitioner uses mother qi to cultivate child qi, and external essence to replenish internal essence—this is the work of like kind. Child qi is heart qi. Internal essence is heart essence. Postnatal cultivation proceeds from external to internal, so one must first refine the external medicine to return to the internal medicine.

There is also the principle of spirit transforming into essence, and essence into qi. This refers to the crimson palace transforming fluid, which flows back to the original sea, the fluid then transforming into qi, later transported by the river chariot. There is further the principle of qi generating essence, and essence generating spirit. This refers to white clouds ascending to court, sweet dew descending, drawing out the yang of *kan* to replenish the yin of *li*.

Excellent indeed! The words of Immortal Tao: "Knowing the internal but not the external, one cannot open the passes. Gathering the external but not the internal, one cannot secure the root." Those who embody this understand the wondrous mutual nourishment of essence, qi, and spirit.

**Chapter Eleven: The Five Passes of Refining Practice**
Elixir methods divide into three passes: refining essence, refining qi, and refining spirit. Yet the depths of cultivation truly exceed these three. If the stages are incomplete, one risks skipping levels. Let us now discuss them.

The first pass refines essence, requiring the crucible. One unites original yellow to copulate, transforming the golden crow to ascend—thus essence transforms into qi. The second pass refines qi, requiring clarity on *zi-wu*. One draws out the yang within *kan* to replenish the yin within *li*—thus qi transforms into spirit. Both foundation-laying and elixir-returning employ such methods, differing only in the scale of medicine, crucible, and furnace.

As for the Dao of refining spirit, there are three passes: first, refining spirit to complete one’s nature; second, refining spirit to complete one’s destiny; third, refining spirit to return to emptiness. Refining spirit to complete one’s nature is the Dao of refining the self with jade fluid. Lead subdues mercury, congealing the elixir foundation. Internally, true fire is unceasing; externally, the *zi-wu* cycle gathers and congeals. Thus mercury is refined into yin cinnabar. Refining spirit to complete one’s destiny is the Dao of refining form with golden fluid. Lead returns to restrain mercury, congealing the fetal infant. Internally, true fire glows enduringly; externally, yin and yang are applied, daily increasing and decreasing. Thus mercury is dried into yang cinnabar.

Refining spirit to return to emptiness ascends further, uniting with the Dao in truth. One moves the spirit to the upper courtyard, sits upright with a tranquil mind, directly merging with the great void to universally illuminate the great thousand worlds. Thus the Dharma body is perfected, the śarīra radiates light, and emanations respond boundlessly. As the saying goes: "Children and grandchildren, a hundred thousand myriad transformations." At this stage, responding to the moment to establish merit, the body returns to the Three Purities, and the Dao transcends the nine ancestors.

**Chapter Twelve: The Stages of Medicine Production**
Medicines have three stages: first, emerging from non-being into being; next, entering from being into non-being; finally, producing being from non-being.

Emerging from non-being into being refers to postnatal lead fire. Though generated externally, it is formless and without substance—this is the initial arising of golden qi. Entering from being into non-being refers to sending it to the western region.

Though cultivated from within, it is utterly empty and void—this is the cavernous yang realm of Kun’s domain.

Producing being from non-being corresponds to the union of Kan and Dui. The primordial qi of the precelestial arises from the formless. From formlessness, wondrous form is born; from insubstantiality, numinous substance is generated. Seek it in the second watch, unite it in the fourth watch, and the golden elixir is accomplished, the sacred embryo congealed, the nurturing complete, and the yang spirit manifests.

Disciples often fail to distinguish between "emerging from non-being into being" and "producing being from non-being," which differ by ten thousandfold. Thus, I have set forth this explanation to clarify.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Stages of Medicinal Refinement**

Medicines have three stages: first, taking the external medicine to refine the internal medicine; next, using the internal medicine to cultivate the external medicine; finally, consuming the external medicine to unite with the internal medicine.

Taking the external medicine to refine the internal medicine refers to the work of laying the foundation and refining the self. This external medicine pertains to the refinement of the lesser medicine, the stage of refining essence into qi.

Using the internal medicine to cultivate the external medicine pertains to the work of the Qian-Kun crucible and vessel. This internal medicine is the true mercury at the moment of dispersing essence and sowing the seed.

Consuming the external medicine to unite with the internal medicine refers to welcoming the lead to refine the mercury, the work of the mother recognizing the child. This external medicine is the great medicine. Seized suddenly, it induces profound intoxication; possessed eternally, it bestows longevity. Harmonized and firmly sealed, it becomes the sacred embryo. When the work of nurturing is complete, it becomes the sage—this is the moment when the great man’s merit is accomplished and his name established.

Someone asked Tuanyang: “Master Shangyang said, ‘The internal medicine completes nature to congeal the elixir; the external medicine completes life to return the elixir.’ Thus, disciples should first refine the internal medicine before proceeding to the external. Why then does Yingchanzi claim that ‘one must begin with the external medicine before turning to the internal’?”

Tuanyang replied: “You conflate the postcelestial external medicine with the precelestial external medicine, regarding both simply as ‘external medicine.’ Yet the postcelestial external medicine precedes *gui*, while the precelestial external medicine follows *gui*. Though their names are the same, their realities differ. Clinging to the letter and fixating on appearances—this is the common flaw of those who lack the master’s oral transmission.”

Thus, I set forth this three-tiered exposition to elucidate the matter.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Two Kinds of Cinnabar**

In the study of the postcelestial, one governs mercury with lead to form cinnabar. This cinnabar is the treasure of the sevenfold return, utterly pure and flawless—the Lesser Returned Elixir.

In the study of the precelestial, one extracts lead to augment mercury, forming cinnabar. This cinnabar is the supreme treasure of the ninefold transmutation, its golden radiance enfolding the body—the Greater Returned Elixir.

**Chapter Fifteen: Spirit and Qi, Nature and Life**

The postcelestial Dao pertains to spirit and qi. The precelestial Dao pertains to nature and life. Though nature and life resemble spirit and qi, they are in truth far removed. Thus, the *Mirror for Ingredient Entry* states: “It is nature and life, not spirit and qi. The lead of the watery realm is but a single flavor.” These words merit deep reflection.

Disciples who grasp this distinction should complete the postcelestial with spirit and qi, and complete the precelestial with nature and life. Why is this? That which nature commands is called life—these two are originally one. This is the heart-method of establishing life.

The *Awakening to Reality* says: “Different names arise from the same source, yet few know this; both are profoundly profound, the essential mechanism.” Here, life is the differing name, while nature is the shared source. Lead is the differing name, while mercury is the shared source. Thus, the lead of the watery realm is but a single flavor. This single flavor—lead—originates from the single flavor of mercury.

The *Daodejing* states: “Through non-desire, observe its mystery; through desire, observe its aperture.” Observing mystery and observing aperture—this is the profoundly profound mechanism. One should attain utmost stillness and desirelessness to observe its mystery, which is the work of stabilizing nature. Yet when the time arrives and the mechanism stirs, the primordial True Unity qi emerges from emptiness—indeed, there is an aperture.

Though these two bear different names, both originate from the Supreme Ultimate, which is their shared source. By observing the non-being, one attains the mystery, gaining one profundity. By observing the being, one attains the aperture, gaining another profundity. Profound beyond profundity—nature resides herein, and life resides herein.

Nature originates from Heaven’s mandate, while life originates from the fulfillment of nature. Heaven forms things through qi, yet principle is also bestowed. Thus, mandate is conferred upon human nature, hence it is said: “What Heaven confers is called nature.” Humans create things through principle, and qi begins to arise. Thus, life is established through nature, hence it is said: “Fulfill nature to attain life.”

In Heaven, principle emerges from qi; in the Dao, qi emerges from principle. When principle emerges from qi, qi is prioritized. This qi is the harmonious, transforming qi of primordial chaos. Humans receive this qi to form their bodies, after which principle has a dwelling—thus, this qi is to be prized.

When qi emerges from principle, qi is again prioritized. This qi is the primordial True Unity qi. Yin receives the yang radiance, and within the lead seed, another yang arises—thus, this qi is even more prized. The Dao of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir cannot be accomplished without this single lead qi; those who recognize this treasure it.

**Chapter Sixteen: Direct Pointers to the Precelestial**

The precelestial transcends the postcelestial, being the most primordial and original, the root and the source—it is the venerable designation of the singular qi. Yet this precelestial qi has three aspects, and the term “precelestial” has two meanings.

What are these two meanings? The first precedes Heaven. The second originates from Heaven.

That which precedes Heaven is earlier than Heaven, the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth. This qi encompasses the form of primordial chaos, initially called Supreme Non-Being. Before Heaven and Earth divided, this qi already existed. This is its precedence over Heaven—hence, it is called precelestial. This is the first aspect.

That which originates from Heaven arises from Heaven, the precelestial that generates humans and all things. This qi contains the image of harmonious fusion, latent within the Great Void. Before humans and things were produced, this qi already existed. This is its origination from Heaven—it is also called precelestial. This is the second aspect.

As for the precelestial that generates immortals and buddhas, it encompasses both preceding meanings. This qi emerges from emptiness, called the Supreme Unity. The Golden Elixir relies upon it to be completed—termed the Ancestor, the Origin, the Embracer of Reality. It may be likened to the precelestial that precedes Heaven and the precelestial that originates from Heaven, forming three corresponding aspects. Thus, it is also designated as precelestial.

The elixir scriptures of past sages, whether speaking of the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth or the precelestial that generates humans and things, are without exception metaphors for this precelestial that generates immortals and buddhas.

Should one inquire about the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth, Tuanyang replies: This precelestial is born of the Supreme Ultimate. As the *Classic* states: “There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Nameless, it is forcibly called the Dao.” It is the ancestor of all phenomena, the origin of the two great powers—without form, without shape, without sound, without scent. Initially, it is profoundly obscure, beyond the reach of the Five Agents. Yet again, it is faintly discernible, the qi arising naturally. When clarity and turbidity separate, and the Dark and Yellow distinguish themselves, then Qian and Kun settle into position, and Heaven and Earth become manifest.

Should one inquire about the precelestial that generates humans and things, Tuanyang replies: This precelestial is governed by Heaven and Earth. One becomes three, and three become one. The one is qi; the three are essence, qi, and spirit. All living beings are forged through these three-in-one.

In speaking of essence, it is the essence of the Two and Five. In speaking of qi, it is the qi of yin and yang. In speaking of spirit, it is the spirit of emptiness. The spirit of emptiness interacts with the qi of yin and yang. The essence of the Two and Five is co-generated with the qi of yin and yang. Its qi is numinous—hence, it is spirit. Its qi is wondrous—hence, it is essence.

Above coiling and below bounding—this is qi, and within it lies the spirit and essence of Heaven and Earth. Humans receive this qi to be born, which is then called the primordial qi of Heaven. Yet this qi may be clear or turbid, firm or yielding. Those who receive the firm become male; those who receive the yielding become female. Those who receive the clear become wise; those who receive the turbid become dull.

Before father and mother unite, this qi abides in profound stillness. When father and mother engage in union, this qi descends to its inception. As essence and blood intermingle and the embryo is fully formed, this qi already pervades the womb in undifferentiated unity. At this time, there is no spirit—qi serves as spirit. At this time, there is no essence—qi serves as essence. When qi is concentrated and securely contained, it is essence.

This is the primordial qi, primordial essence, and primordial spirit—the precelestial endowment for human birth. If a youth encounters a master and receives the method, preserving this purity through cultivation, they may aspire to become a Daoist immortal of non-action.

There is also true qi, true spirit, and true essence—the precelestial foundation for internal alchemy. If scholars fail to recognize the true mechanism, they will have no starting point and cannot attain this supreme treasure.

Now, the precelestial: it cannot be used when seen, and cannot be seen when used. It is what alchemists seek through emptiness and stillness, refining the real by means of the provisional, generating being from non-being. At this stage, the Way of three, two, and one naturally divides and unites.

Spirit becomes the spirit beyond spirit; essence becomes the essence of utmost essence; qi becomes the true unity of qi—these are the three. The spirit beyond spirit is spirit in its most spiritual form—this is the nature of the Dragon. The essence of utmost essence is essence refined to its purest—this is the essence of the Tiger. These are the two. As for the true unity of qi, it is the true lead for completing life, uniting the Dragon and Tiger’s nature and temperament into one, called the Mother of the Elixir—this is the one.

Ingesting this true unity causes the Three Corpses and Five Thieves to flee, filling the six palaces of the body with eternal spring. How could this compare to the qi, essence, and spirit of birth? How could it be approached by the postcelestial qi, essence, and spirit?

The postcelestial consists of the qi of breathing, the spirit of thought, and the essence of intercourse—three things that can be heard, seen, measured, and inferred. These serve the body after birth, hence they are called postcelestial.

When a person is in the womb, there is only a single point of primordial qi, with no qi of breathing. Only after ten months, when the fetus is complete and leaves the mother’s body, does it borrow the orifices of mouth and nose to externally absorb the harmony of Heaven and Earth—thus the origin of breathing qi. From this, the spirit of thought also arises, relying on this qi to enter. It lodges in the body as a temporary abode, seizing the dwelling to reside within. This spirit is the seed of karmic rebirth, arriving first at birth and departing first at death, ceaselessly abandoning the old and seeking the new.

When an infant first emerges, its initial cry subtly reveals the suffering of rebirth. As it is nurtured and grows, the acquired spirit takes control, emotions and desires entangle, and the primordial qi gradually dissipates. Even the qi of breathing never ceases for a moment—how tragic!

As for postcelestial essence, it is not brought at birth nor taken at death. Only as the body’s primordial qi gradually fills and overflows, reaching fifteen years of age, does yang reach its peak and yin begin to grow, yin lengthening as yang wanes. This causes the undifferentiated qi to transform into the passions of intercourse. Intercourse involves both union and sensation—with union and sensation, there is essence; without them, there is none. This essence is compelled by desire and transformed from qi and blood.

There are also those who lose essence through dream-induced sensations or dream intercourse, which occurs when qi and blood are unstable and the kidney’s gate cannot retain it. This is the essence of intercourse.

I urge those who study the Dao to seek only the precelestial and not the postcelestial, so that the supreme medicine may be obtained. Even if one does not dare to immediately pursue the highest grade but instead builds the foundation and refines the self, one must refine primordial essence into primordial qi, and primordial qi into true lead, making the postcelestial precelestial to complete the half-pound of postcelestial substance. Then one may seek this supreme precelestial.

**Chapter Seventeen: On Spirit, Qi, and Essence**

The *Heart Seal Scripture* states: "The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence." These are the wondrous substances of internal alchemy. The most exalted among them are primordial spirit, primordial qi, and primordial essence—true essence, true qi, and true spirit.

What is primordial? The precelestial. What is true? Also the precelestial. The primordial precelestial is born of the imperial descent—this is the celestial primordial of youth. The true precelestial is accomplished through the great Dao—this is the human primordial of our kind.

If one cannot cultivate the celestial primordial, must they not rely on the human primordial?

Some may ask: "The celestial primordial is how Heaven and Earth, through yin-yang and the Five Phases, transform and generate beings, forming shapes with qi and endowing them with principle. The qi that gives life to humans is primordial qi. Before father and mother unite, this qi abides in profound stillness. When father and mother engage in union, this qi descends to its inception. The Confucians speak of 'Heaven giving birth to the multitudes, with things and patterns'—this refers to it. This qi is most numinous; being numinous, it has spirit, which is primordial spirit. This qi is most clear; being clear, it is utmost essence, which is primordial essence.

Before the embryo is formed, there is only primordial qi within, with no postcelestial breathing qi. Only after ten months, when the form is complete and the mouth and nose exist, does it follow the mother’s breathing to externally absorb the great harmony of Heaven and Earth. The karmic yin spirit also relies on this breathing to enter. Thus, the postcelestial spirit and qi are both complete, and the infant immediately cries upon birth. Fortunately, the mouth cannot speak, the eyes cannot smile, and there is no knowledge or perception. The primordial qi remains undifferentiated, without thought or deliberation, rendering the yin spirit useless."

The primordial qi relies on the primordial spirit for mutual nourishment. By the age of sixteen, when spirit is complete and qi is full, yang reaches its peak and yin arises, giving birth to postcelestial generative essence. Desire-fire blazes, and the yin spirit indulges its will. Thus, those of youthful purity and supreme virtue, if they encounter a teacher, may preserve their celestial primordial body through pure cultivation, becoming effortless celestial immortals. Once postcelestial forces take hold, the primordial recedes.

One might ask: If the celestial primordial is so easily cultivated, why not take children into the mountains to realize fruition, making them immortals at once? The answer: A fine question! Heaven and Earth generate humanity to establish the Dao of Heaven and enact the virtue of Heaven. Therefore, those who inwardly preserve perfection need not refrain from outwardly fulfilling their human destiny, thereby expanding their creative transformation. Otherwise, though the immortal Dao may flourish, the human Dao will surely wane. Thus, after following the natural course of human life, the method of reversing birth to become an immortal is emphasized. This is the great Dao of the human primordial—how it nurtures all things without omission, encompassing Heaven and Earth without overstepping.

The key lies in recognizing this essence, qi, and spirit.

Someone asks: "What is the difference between primordial spirit and true spirit?"
Answer: The primordial spirit is turbid and indistinct. The true spirit is bright and luminous. One lies hidden in chaos, without light; the other, refined through tempering, becomes useful. Confucians speak of "tranquility, stability, and the ability to contemplate"; Buddhists, of "entering deeply into the great prajñā"; Daoists, of "supreme stillness generating wisdom." This true spirit is perfect knowing and perfect awareness. Thus, even children may cultivate purity, while ordinary people must engage in quiet refinement to attain the true spirit of the perfected.

Another asks: "What is the difference between primordial essence and true essence?"
Answer: Primordial essence resides in my domain; true essence resides in the other’s domain. That in my domain is the undifferentiated qi of the Crimson Palace, accumulated over time to generate numinous fluid. That in the other’s domain is the vigorous qi of the Flowery Pond, what the *Awakening to Reality* calls the "primary essence." On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, when metal qi is full and water’s tide arises, it precisely aligns with the true signal of the two equinoxes. If cultivators recognize this essence, drawing it in with a single breath, they may instantly attain celestial immortality—it is no ordinary thing.

Another asks: "What is the difference between primordial qi and true qi?"
Answer: Primordial qi is what children receive from Heaven—what is called the qi that forms the body, increasing with the years. True qi, however, is not like this. The primordial, original ancestor arises from within emptiness and nonbeing. Only with the oral instructions of a true teacher, first establishing the cauldron and vessel of qian and kun, harmonizing the true dragon and true tiger, and uniting true yin and true yang, does it coalesce into the mother of lead in half a double-hour. Yang born within lead becomes true qi. Thus, Heaven uses primordial qi to generate humans and things, while the Dao uses true qi to generate immortals and buddhas. The human primordial method of refining qi seizes the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth—no easy feat.

Upon hearing Master Tuanyang’s discourse on the human primordial’s refinement of qi to seize Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation, someone asks about the difference between the celestial primordial and the human primordial. Tuanyang replies: Listen, and I will tell you. "What Heaven commands is called nature"—principle emerges from qi: this is the celestial primordial. "Fully realizing nature to reach destiny"—qi emerges from principle: this is the human primordial. Supreme virtue is effortless, not seeking through observation, a practice of purity and stillness—this is the celestial primordial. Inferior virtue acts, its function unceasing, the path of return—this is the human primordial. Those of supreme virtue receive Heaven’s bounty in abundance, yet still engage in pure cultivation. They must refine primordial qi and primordial spirit into utmost clarity and emptiness, transforming them into perfect equanimity and perfect awakening, only then fully realizing the principle of the celestial primordial. Thus, the celestial primordial is not a ready-made matter for those of supreme virtue. Those who take supreme virtue as the celestial primordial do so because their original self remains unharmed, naturally close to the celestial primordial.

Those of inferior virtue are the most numerous among people, so the wondrous truth of return is taught first. They must forge yin elixir and yang elixir into a single mass, refining them into supreme nonbeing and supreme emptiness, only then fully realizing the Dao of the human primordial. Thus, the human primordial is not the ready-made body of inferior virtue. Those who take inferior virtue as the human primordial do so because their own and others’ brilliance is manifest, hence it is called the art of the human primordial.

The original body of supreme virtue is endowed with both nature and destiny. The wondrous function of inferior virtue fully realizes both nature and destiny. Yet both rely on a single qi for transformation. Thus, humans attain the primordial true unity of qi to become immortals, just as Heaven bestows yin-yang and five-phase qi to become human. The elixir path seizes the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth because it is one with the Dao of Heaven.

**Chapter Eighteen: Further Discussion on Essence, Qi, and Spirit**

In the original body of supreme virtue, essence, qi, and spirit are all called "primordial," for what is received from Heaven is abundant, and there is no need to seek from the other’s domain—hence it is called the celestial primordial. In the practice of inferior virtue, essence, qi, and spirit are all named "true," for what is taken from humanity is plentiful, and it cannot be sought from one’s own domain—hence it is called the human primordial. Yet in this human primordial practice, there are wondrous subtleties of gathering the primordial and secret mechanisms of seeking the primordial. Thus, those who use humanity to return to Heaven gather primordial essence to supplement primordial qi, refine primordial qi to nourish primordial spirit, and refine primordial spirit to become true spirit—then the postcelestial work is complete. Using true spirit to generate true qi, using true qi to seek true essence, seizing true essence to form true lead—then the primordial work is complete. When one returns to the origin and embraces the primordial to guard the One, it becomes entirely identical to the practice of supreme virtue.

Those who cultivate inferior virtue but do not reach the realm of nonaction, or embrace supreme virtue but do not investigate the mystery of nonaction, cannot ingest the celestial primordial or attain the rank of celestial immortal.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Order and Reversal of Nature and Life**
The principles of nature and life possess both order and reversal. The ordered completion of nature and life is bestowed by Heaven, wherein one encompasses two. The reversed completion of nature and life is cultivated by man, wherein one unites two. That which encompasses two—qi is endowed with principle, and when qi and principle merge, nature and life become wholly integrated. That which unites two—water is raised to extinguish fire, and when water and fire interact, nature and life endure forever.

What Heaven commands is called nature; within life resides nature—this is ordered completion. Mencius spoke of form and appearance as Heaven’s nature, for what is commanded possesses this form, and thus possesses this nature. Innate knowledge and innate ability are both lodged within the commanded form. To fully realize nature is to reach life; within nature, life is cultivated—this is reversed completion. The perfected person plants the life-treasure with the fire of spirit, for what is realized in nature possesses this spirit, and thus possesses this life. In response to stimuli and summons, all arises from the radiance of the spirit within nature.

Now we know that supreme virtue is pure and still, preserving the way of ordered completion to congeal the immortal embryo—this is Heaven perfecting man. We also know that inferior virtue returns and refines the way of reversed completion to congeal the sage embryo—this is exhausting man to unite with Heaven. Let those who study the Dao understand this.

**Chapter Twenty: The Mysterious Pass of the One Aperture**
The mysterious pass of the one aperture is born from emptiness and nothingness. It does not reside among the five viscera or six bowels, nor anywhere in the limbs. Speaking of its name: this pass is a wondrous mechanism, hence it is called the *mysterious pass*. This aperture is the place where all methods return to the One, solitary and without counterpart, hence it is called the *one aperture*. In a single phrase to encompass it: it is the *center*.

The center lies between above and below, yet it does not lie between above and below—for it is both dead and alive. What is dead? To take the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field as this center is dead. What is alive? To concentrate spirit and gather qi, revealing this center, is alive. In dead terms, it is called the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field. In living terms, it is reckoned as the mysterious pass of the one aperture. Thus it is said: born from emptiness and nothingness. The true mechanism is directly revealed. Those who attain it must keep it secret.

---

**Chapter Twenty-One: Further Discussion of the Mysterious Pass**
The mysterious pass is the numinous radiance where spirit and qi unite. When first glimpsed, the mysterious pass flickers without constancy. When first entered, it is indistinct and without support, for spirit and qi have only just merged and cannot yet solidify. Only when their embrace becomes pure and familiar, and the heart dies without departing, does one begin to recognize that within the mysterious pass, self and other are forgotten, and even spirits and gods cannot fathom it. (Beyond this, one cannot evade impermanence.) Here, it is utterly pure and undifferentiated, serene and soaring. Within this, the mysteries transform endlessly, beyond description. No wonder its names are many—each person’s perception differs. Each names it according to their vision, and titles it according to their use. Ancient immortals kept it secret and unspoken; only after receiving the transmission with the touch of a hand to the crown could one be taught. Even then, their instructions amounted to no more than: it is neither heart nor kidney. I say it is also not the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field. Now I reveal it further—let those who recognize it keep it secret.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Method of the Two Apertures**
In the alchemical tradition, there is one cavity, and this cavity has two apertures. Its center is hollow, while its two ends are perforated, hence it is called the *cavity of two apertures*. The master’s transmission—“mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture”—refers precisely to this realm. It is the place where the Conception and Governor Vessels merge, where yin and yang converge, the land where the Crow and Hare come and go.

Within the one cavity and two apertures lies the method of practice—this method is most profoundly mysterious. The *Triple Concordance* states: “When the upper is closed, it is called *having*; when the lower is closed, it is called *nothing*. *Nothing* serves the upper, where the power of spirit resides. This method of the two apertures also requires the qi of metal.” These few lines exhaust the method of practice.

Upper and lower are Heaven and Earth. *Closed* means dark union. *Having* and *nothing* are the wondrous apertures. *Called* refers to naming and describing. One above, one below—all are concealed within this cavity. Whether *having* or *nothing*, all reside within this cavity. When one attains emptiness and preserves stillness, at the time when Heaven and Earth darkly unite, one may observe its wonder. The wondrous *having*—though indescribable, it may be named, hence it is called *having*. This is what is meant by: “In the profound and obscure, there is essence; within it, there is sincerity.” To observe the aperture through *nothing*—the aperture of emptiness and nothingness—though describable, it cannot be described, hence it is called *nothing*. This is what is meant by: “Within it, things return to no-thing.”

*Nothing* serves the upper—not as an empty return, but as the true lead of the primordial. This is what Laozi spoke of: “The form of the formless, the image of the imageless. One meets it but does not see its head; one follows it but does not see its rear.” In the elixir method, *nothing* serving the upper is to return *nothing* to *having*. What is meant by *serving*? Who offers reverence? Who presents the offering? When the power of spirit humbly resides above, its qi naturally returns—*returning* is *serving*. The only fear is that above, there is no power of spirit. *Above* refers to the region above the Yellow Court; *power* refers to the power of humility and softness. This is what the *Token* meant by: “Reversal is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue.”

To attain emptiness, one employs the Dao; to seek lead, one employs virtue. Virtue acts, while the Dao does not—one must not fail to understand this method. The two apertures are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the place where the golden elixir is transformed and born. If one knows and practices the method of pursuit and absorption within the one cavity and two apertures, then both gates open. Only then does metal return to nature, and one may be called *returned elixir*. Thus it is said: “the qi of metal also requires it,” and so on. *Requires* means it requires this method of absorption.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Root-Foundation of the Mysterious Female**

Those who cultivate the Mysterious must, whether refining the Great Elixir or the Lesser Elixir, quietly nurture the Valley Spirit to establish their root-foundation. The Valley Spirit is the name for the primordial, empty, and numinous—it is our original nature. Where is it nurtured? In the Mysterious Female.

Master Shangyang said: “The Mysterious Female consists of two things. Without these two, how could the myriad things come to be?” For *xuan* (玄) is Heaven, and *pin* (牝) is Earth—this is already evident in the first hexagram of the *Book of Changes*. Thus, the one aperture of the Mysterious Female is truly the source of all generation and transformation. How could one who enters the Dao fail to seek this source of generation and transformation? This source of generation and transformation is precisely the aperture of the Mysterious Female.

Some cite the words of Lord Lao: “The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female.” But why do they also take the Valley Spirit to be the Mysterious Transformation? The answer is: by borrowing the Mysterious Female of emptiness and nothingness to nurture the Valley Spirit of emptiness and nothingness, they thus name the Mysterious Female after the Valley Spirit. This is the meaning of naming according to function.

Moreover, there is further explanation: *The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: “This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is formed by the union of Qian and Kun. It is called the Cavity of Spirit and Qi, within which lies the essence of Kan and Li.” Thus, the Mysterious Female not only nurtures spirit but also nurtures qi. Now, when spirit and qi merge, the Mysterious Female appears. Therefore, one must concentrate spirit and gather qi, allowing the two to intermingle, only then can the circle of Qian and Kun be formed. Within this lies the function of inversion. Why? That which congeals from above downward is spirit. As the noble body of Mysterious Heaven performs the humble bow of Earthly Female, above and below intermingle harmoniously, and qi and spirit unite.

The *Dao De Jing* says: “The union of all under Heaven is the Female of all under Heaven.” For this aperture lies at the center, hence it is called the union of all under Heaven; within it lies the Way of softness, hence it is called the Female of all under Heaven. When speaking of the Female Way, the Mysterious Way is also implied, thus it is called the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female is one Qian and one Kun, one firm and one yielding. Without this, spirit would be strong and qi would be strong, opposing and separating from each other. Therefore, it is said: the male descends to the female, spirit descends to qi, inverting and uniting, yin and yang mating. Only then do spirit and qi meet, and the root-foundation is established. Otherwise, spirit remains spirit and qi remains qi, qi remains qi and spirit remains spirit. If spirit does not obtain qi, there is nothing to supplement spirit. If qi does not return to spirit, there is no function to nurture spirit. How could one hope for the original spirit to abide long?

Moreover, if spirit dwells in the Crimson Palace, the Crimson Palace becomes the bright hall of governance, and all knowledge, perceptions, and disturbances will disturb it. Only by congealing it in the Yellow Court can sounds and thoughts cease—this, too, is not without its quiet nurturing. Thus, *Awakening to Reality* says: “To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root-foundation. When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber, a single luminous pearl will never depart.”

The Valley Spirit is the most empty and numinous mercury-nature. True essence is the purest and most tender lead-emotion. The root-foundation is the place where mercury welcomes lead to forge the Golden Elixir. The Golden Chamber is the Yellow Room. As it is the place where gold returns, it is called the Golden Chamber. When metal-lead and wood-mercury merge, only then is a luminous pearl formed. The luminous pearl is a grain of Golden Elixir, as large as a millet seed. When metal returns to nature at the outset, it may be called the Returned Elixir. Once obtained, it is eternally possessed, hence it is said to “never depart.”

I have often said that this poem by Ziyang directly reveals the true formula of the ages, applicable to both the precelestial and postcelestial. What I have explained pertains to the precelestial. Even from the postcelestial perspective, one must first seek the Mysterious Female to lay the foundation of the Elixir. For the Valley Spirit relies on it to stand, and true essence also relies on it to return. Nurture the Valley Spirit with the Mysterious Female, and nurture true essence with the Valley Spirit. Spirit is cultivated by essence to strengthen the original, and essence is transformed by spirit into qi.

The *Triple Concordance* says: “Inwardly nurture the self, abiding in stillness and emptiness.” It also says: “The nature-master resides within, establishing the barriers.” From this, we know that the essential task of cultivating the body is to first nurture the Valley Spirit in stillness as the root-foundation.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Direct Indication of the "Center"**

The *Dao De Jing* says: “Much speech hastens exhaustion; it is better to guard the center.” To recognize this center is to possess the seed of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas. Otherwise, there is no ground for cultivating the Dao, and with every step, one falls into the demonic pit.

What is this center? It is the Mysterious Pass. The *Triple Concordance* says: “In movement, do not lose the center,” and “Float and wander, guarding the compass of the center.” Both refer to this.

Immortal Tao said: “The center is not the middle among the four directions or above and below. The Confucians speak of the center as the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise; the Daoists speak of the unmoving thought as the Mysterious Female; the Buddhists speak of neither thinking of good nor thinking of evil, and in that very moment, ask: ‘What is the original face?’—this is the true center.”

The wondrous state of the center naturally nurtures the self, congeals spirit, enters the chamber to return the Elixir, and even transcends the womb to achieve spirit-transformation—all depend on this. Therefore, those who first enter the Dao must recognize this center to have a path of ascent.

In ancient times, Celestial Master Wen Shi asked the Most High: “What chapter contains the essentials of cultivating the body?” The Most High replied: “It lies in deeply rooting and firmly establishing, guarding the center and embracing the One.”

Let me now attempt to expound on these words. At the outset of practice, the learner must firmly hold the sinews and bones, fiercely battle the sleep demon, seal the senses and lower the curtains, detach from all delusive thoughts, and turn the light inward to illuminate the three cavities. These three cavities are the Yellow Court, the Sea of Qi, and the Cinnabar Field.

Yet though one turns the light inward to illuminate the three cavities, one must neither fix the mind upon them nor let it wander among them. Only then does spirit settle within, breath follow its natural course, and all distinctions dissolve into utter oblivion, leaving no trace or sign. This is precisely what the *Classic* means by “desireless, observe its mystery.”

At the moment of perfect emptiness and quiescent guarding, when spirit congeals and qi unites, an unexpected realm may suddenly emerge from the compass of awareness—boundless without, infinitesimal within—whereupon the Mysterious Pass appears. This is what the *Classic* means by “desiring, observe its aperture.”

Further examining the *Contract*, it states: “Closing above is called *having*; closing below is called *not-having*.” I submit that these “above” and “below” both lie concealed within the character *center*. Yin and yang course within it; Kan and Li ascend and descend between them, merging above and below into its midst. Thus, when the upper is closed and the lower sealed, the mechanism remains subtly secure. Within the Great Void, the primordial qi moves alone—hence *not-having*, which is also the purport of observing mystery. When the lower is closed and the upper sealed, the hidden remains unseen. Yet within the profound obscurity, essence abides, and within it, a sign exists—hence *having* and *desiring*, all residing in the subtleties of the Mysterious. Therefore, the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass is variously called the aperture of having and not-having, the upper and lower crucibles, the cauldron of yin and yang, or the cavity of spirit and qi. All derive from this, and all are subsumed within the One Center.

The Master commented: “To study the Dao, study the Dao—first one must grasp its mystery. Without grasping its mystery, one cannot glimpse its aperture. To glimpse its aperture, one must hear the Dao.” I and Tuanyang shared a knowing smile.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: A Direct Explanation of Medicinal Substances**
What are medicinal substances? Shangyang said: “This medicine arises from within things.” Medicines are of two kinds: lesser medicine and greater medicine, corresponding to the Dao’s division into prior-heaven and posterior-heaven. Posterior-heaven medicine is lesser medicine, used for forming the elixir. Prior-heaven medicine is greater medicine, used for returning the elixir. Posterior-heaven medicine is formless and without substance yet truly exists; prior-heaven medicine has form and function yet is truly non-existent.

Posterior-heaven true lead discards *gui* and selects *ren*, concealing yang within yin to generate being from non-being. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “How could the three primals and eight trigrams depart from *ren*?” The three primals are the three treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. *Ren* is born of Heaven’s One, residing before *zi*, the origin of the first yang. Both *ren* and *gui* dwell in the northern Kan, where water pertains to yin. *Ren*-water is yang within yin; *gui*-water is yin within yin. Moreover, *ren* and *gui* are stems, while *hai* and *zi* are branches. To seek true lead, one must take the heavenly stems as primary and the earthly branches as secondary, for heaven precedes earth.

In essence, *ren* signifies only the primal meaning—the beginning without thought or deliberation, the moment before movement returns to stillness. *Zi*, by contrast, is the time of knowing and awareness, the threshold between stillness and movement. *Gui*-yin is not used, and *hai*, not yet free of yin, is also not used. This is the method for seeking lesser medicine.

Prior-heaven medicine is otherwise: it is produced in Kun and sown in Qian, generating non-being from being, seeking the other from the self. When Qian-metal enters Kun, it is called “metal within Kun.” Kun truly becomes Kan, called “metal within water.” Kan resides in the north, while Dui in the west is its neighbor, so it may be said to lodge in Dui. It is not sought in Qian, for Qian is the place of sowing. It is not sought in Kun, for Kun is the place of containing the primordial. It is not sought in Kan, for though Kan contains yang, it remains hidden within water, its qi-mechanism not yet revealed. It is sought directly in Dui, where lead produces yang and the metal manifests—like the moon’s third day, emerging from the *geng* direction.

Thus, Kan-water is the river’s source, and Dui-metal is the medicinal substance. It is not that Qian, Kun, Kan, and Dui are arrayed within the body; rather, all is a matter of generating non-being from being, seeking the other from the self. I move a single drop of yin-fire’s essence, sowing it within the other’s household, thereby generating yang within lead. When yang-qi stirs, it is gathered and returned, then sown within my own womb-palace to form the true person. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “Relying on Kun’s position, the body is formed; sown in Qian’s household, the palace of mutual resonance.” The sowing in Qian is the initial planting; the sowing in Qian’s household is nurturing. If Cui and Zhang were to rise again, they would surely affirm this humble interpretation.

The mechanism of sowing lead to obtain lead is thus. Yet the method of sowing lead must lie between the sequence of *ding* and *ren*, then the effects of Zhen and Dui may take their turn. My teacher’s oral instructions are all contained herein. The true mechanism of inner and outer medicines is now laid bare. Those who grasp these words are thrice blessed—do not treat them lightly.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Discerning Lead and Mercury**
The spirit within the heart is called mercury-nature; the essence within the heart is called mercury-fluid. Gathering mercury-nature in the Yellow Court and congealing mercury-fluid in the Purple Palace produces dragon-mercury, which is true mercury, the inner elixir, the yin elixir, and the posterior-heaven half-catty.

The qi within the body is called lead-essence; the essence within the body is called lead-flower. Observing lead-essence in the Kan Palace and gathering lead-flower at the Dui Gate produces tiger-lead, which is true lead, the outer elixir, the yang elixir, and the prior-heaven eight-ounce mother.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: A Direct Explanation of the Crucible**
In the elixir method, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible, and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances. Taking from Kan to fill Li, metal first returns. Kun’s form has six segments, its body fundamentally empty.

At the extreme of earth’s yin configuration, one yang returns to restore. Qian’s form has three continuous lines, its body entirely solid. Within heaven’s flourishing yang configuration, one yin suddenly arises. Between heaven and earth, the solid cannot contain things, while the empty can receive. Thus, one borrows Kun’s emptiness to conceal its solidity and first casts Qian’s solid into its emptiness. The method’s workings are thus, yet one must also understand the transference of metal to distinguish the maturity of the medicine. From the prior-heaven Qian-metal concealed within Kun’s position, at this moment yin contains yang. Though it resembles the one within Kan, the form lies hidden beneath water, secret and unrevealed. Only when metal appears within water—like the moon rising in the west at Dui—does it become usable metal. Harvested in the span of one talisman, this is precisely the time of having qi without substance. Taking from Dui is like taking from Kan; producing from Dui is like producing from Kun. Yet without the radiance of Qian-father’s essence, this great medicine cannot be produced. Though it serves as host, I become the guest. While it seeks to ascend, I descend instead. Guest and host rise and sink, all operating within the crucible. Only then does one realize the crucible’s design lies in its emptiness.

Master Tao says: “Within the crucible, originally there is nothing. After the two-sevens’ period, moved by Qian-father’s radiant essence, yang qi first stirs. Within the Qian crucible, originally there is also nothing. At the time of harvesting, receiving Kun-mother’s yang-lead, the golden elixir begins to congeal. All is created ex nihilo. The term ‘crucible’ merely borrows this as a vessel to hold things.” His words are most profound, hence recorded here.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Qian, Kun, Li, and Kan**
Prior-heaven is Qian and Kun; posterior-heaven is Kan and Li. Yet prior-heaven has Qian and Kun while also containing Kan and Li. Posterior-heaven has Kan and Li while also containing Qian and Kun. What is the reason? Prior-heaven as Qian and Kun means primordial yang remains unbroken in youthful purity, internally possessing Qian’s image with yang firmly established, externally possessing Kun’s image with yin firmly established—hence called prior-heaven Qian and Kun. Posterior-heaven as Kan and Li means that in middle age, primordial yang has departed, Kun envelops Qian’s yang to form Kan, and Qian envelops Kun’s yin to form Li—hence called posterior-heaven Kan and Li. Prior-heaven having Qian and Kun while also containing Kan and Li means using Qian and Kun as the crucible and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances. Posterior-heaven having Kan and Li while also containing Qian and Kun means employing Kan and Li in subtle work to restore Qian and Kun’s original body.

There is more to know: the substance refined in posterior-heaven’s self-cultivation is called prior-heaven Kan and Li, referring to taking from Kan to fill Li to form the Jade-Fluid Returned Elixir. The substance refined in prior-heaven’s return to the origin is also called prior-heaven Kan and Li, referring to transforming Kan into Li to produce the Golden-Fluid Returned Elixir. Both prior-heaven and posterior-heaven’s taking from Kan are called prior-heaven, differing only in whether the medicine comes from another or is planted in one’s own field.

In my humble opinion: prior-heaven Qian and Kun are the celestial medicine, just as posterior-heaven Kan and Li are the human medicine. A youth who receives the method and meets a teacher sits guarding Qian and Kun to attain the Dao. Once fallen into posterior-heaven, Qian and Kun are renamed the crucible.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Subtle Work of Harvesting and Refining**
Harvesting and refining means gathering the other’s yang-lead and refining the qi of one’s own child-pearl. Yang-lead is earth’s po, for it is concealed within the extreme yin outside, hence called earth’s po. When obtained during self-refinement, it can control one’s mercury-nature and transform it into cinnabar. As the *Awakening to Reality* says: “Simply use earth’s po to capture mercury-sand”—one need only know how to harvest and refine.

What is harvesting? Harvesting with non-harvesting. What is refining? Refining with non-refining.

What is non-harvesting harvesting? Dragon at ease, tiger at rest, guarding the feminine without masculinity. In the month of the winter solstice, its qi begins to rise. The spirit immediately follows its ascent, reversing into the crucible, drawing it in—this is non-harvesting harvesting.

What is non-refining refining? When it is in my home, the medicine itself is fire. After prolonged fusion, its yin naturally transforms. Yang then grows accordingly, accumulating in the furnace and naturally circulating—hence called non-refining refining.

Yet one must concentrate the spirit to await it, then harvest it. Regulate the breath to guard it, then refine it. When essence is entirely transformed into qi, the abdomen becomes full, and the inner elixir can be formed.

**Chapter Thirty: The River Chariot’s Subtle Essentials**
The River Chariot is the essential method of moving the medicine after obtaining it, not the method of imagined transference. It is the fire-timing of advancing and retreating at midnight and noon, the closing of yin and yang, the ascending and descending of internal and external, the natural fire of heaven and earth. From the foundation-building stage onward, after the golden crucible is full, regulate the inner breath and concentrate the inner spirit. When spirit and breath depend on each other, wind and fire merge. Suddenly, the spiritual sprout sprouts, and the qi-mechanism stirs. I then activate the River Chariot to refine it, causing it to move from below to the rear, entering through the Governing Vessel, flowing backward to the Celestial Valley, and returning to the Central Palace—this is the proper procedure after obtaining the medicine.

Alas, later generations lacking true transmission often fall into imagined transference, moving emptily back and forth—what benefit is there? Only because few attain subtle realization do immortals’ teachers find it difficult to explain. Now I shall attempt to clarify: its subtlety lies in intent guarding within and spirit driving without. Yet since this explanation exists, skeptics abound.

The reason is that the true spirit is the true intent—how can they be divided in two places? Presiding within while also presiding without, how can one fulfill two roles alone? This doubt is inevitable. Yet one must know that when the spirit guards the inner court, it values concentration, not movement. Movement necessarily employs intent.

The marvel of the celestial cycle lies in its external movement being effortless while its internal governance is laborious—thus the internal governance must be borne by intent. It is like a person sitting before a lamp: the shadow appears on the wall, and as the body moves, the shadow moves with it. Speech arises within the room, and sound flows beyond the walls—words uttered, sound follows. Intent is like the body and speech of the spirit; the spirit is like the shadow and echo of intent. There has never been a case where they do not see or hear each other. Therefore, when intent calculates within, the spirit naturally moves without—though two, they remain one. Moving within is moving without; one need not attend to it, for they naturally know each other.

Why is this so? True intent resides at the center, directing breath to respond within and without—this is inherently knowing the internal. Yet as true intent flows, piercing barriers and crossing the crown, there is a subtle mutual awareness. Is this the spirit? Is this intent? Does this spirit return to this intent? Master Wu said: "There is a subtle intent of mutual knowing"—this is precisely it. I do not know how spirit and intent transform their forms or divide their presence, nor how they coordinate within and without. To claim ignorance is true knowledge.

I simply submit to my intent and regulate my inner self: here, qi stirs; there, qi ascends. Here, wind moves; there, wind carries. Here is intent; there is spirit. Spirit and intent—divided yet undivided. One feels that the guardian within manages household affairs, while the driver without ascends to the heavenly gate, yet knows not how this subtle intent of mutual awareness arises.

Profound, oh profound! Riding the immortal raft, drifting on the Silver River, paying court to the azure vault, returning to the Yellow Court—mechanism smooth, spirit flowing, bliss unbounded. Day after day in circulation, morning after morning in passage, qi surges through the hundred joints, infusing the three palaces. Only then does the obtained medicine avoid idleness and waste, and true qi grow ever more abundant.

Alas! The world’s people, oblivious to the river chariot’s essence, toil in vain with laborious transference, exhausting their minds.

Should the true transmission not be expounded in detail,
No matter where you seek, your search shall be in vain.

**Chapter Thirty-One: On the True Heart**

The Dao of the Golden Elixir values the attainment of true spirit, true qi, and true essence, for only then can the work of creation be accomplished. Yet without employing the true heart, one cannot obtain this true essence, true qi, or true spirit.

The true heart resides in the moment before discriminating thoughts arise, before human desires intermingle, before the sprouts of yin qi are tainted. The wondrous Dao of cultivating the body begins with settling into stillness. For the student whose refinement of the self remains impure, only this practice can yield results. It is what strategists call striking when the enemy least expects, attacking when they are unprepared.

When the mind-ground momentarily clears, I seal the Three Treasures, concentrate the spirit, and regulate the breath. Inner thoughts do not stray outward; outer thoughts do not intrude. At this time, before desires arise, effort yields immediate effect. Seizing the moment before the spirit of consciousness is employed, one may perceive the true spirit. Seizing the moment before turbid qi stirs, one may nurture the true qi. Seizing the moment before lustful essence scatters, one may await the true essence.

With single-minded devotion, one attains utmost emptiness and abides in profound stillness, thereby recognizing the mysterious pass. This is the foremost principle of dual cultivation of nature and life. How wondrous is the function of the true heart!

If, however, one waits until affairs, interactions, laughter, speech, or eating stir the mind’s mechanism before attempting to restrain it, the inner heart will already be stirred, and杂念 will have arisen. If I suppress them and they cease, it is fortunate. But should they cease only to rise again, or be driven away only to return—each attempt to expel them only multiplying their number—then one faces a formidable foe. Closing the eyes, one wages war between heaven and humanity; touching the heart, one finds a field of ruin. The heart is defeated. What then can be done?

Generally, beginners cannot compare to those long detached from worldly ties, who forget emotions when facing circumstances. Those who suddenly awaken to emptiness are indeed of superior wisdom, while those who gradually awaken to their nature are not of inferior rank. The student need only seek the true heart as the starting point. Though their refinement of the self may be incomplete, they may still enter the gate of stillness, provided they grasp the true heart whenever it appears.

This true heart may arise at dawn, at dusk, or at any hour within the twelve. One must recognize and seize it for oneself. Though this teaching may seem novel, it is not truly so. Moreover, it benefits beginners and harmonizes with the ancient alchemical classics without contradiction.

If one gradually cultivates thus—guarding the true at all times, embracing the true each day, never failing to perceive it—then through gradual progress one attains constancy. Over time, purity and stillness become complete, and the work of refining the self is naturally encompassed. Is this not grand?

Thus, when the mind-ground is momentarily clear, it is a precious opportunity for practice, a golden moment, a wondrous state. May one treasure it as if a single instant were worth a thousand gold.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Direct Exposition on the Heart and Spirit**
*(Including the Method of Breath Regulation)*

The heart is the master of the entire body; the spirit is the supreme medicine of the three grades. One must discern whether heart and spirit are two or one.

Laozi said: "The human spirit delights in clarity, but the heart disturbs it. The human heart delights in stillness, but desires drag it away. Thus, constantly dispelling desires, the heart becomes still of itself. Clarifying the heart, the spirit becomes clear of itself."

Lu Qianxu said: "The method of regulating the breath begins with regulating the heart. The method of concentrating the spirit begins with regulating the breath." This is the bridge of sages, immortals, and buddhas, the path by which we enter virtue.

Those who begin to study the Dao must gather their thoughts and return to stillness. In movement and rest, sitting and lying down, all must reside within the cavity of the chest, for only then can the guarding of stillness be steadfast.

For the mind with thoughts is the deluded heart; the mind without thoughts is the true heart. If one can collect their thoughts in daily life and return them to their proper place, they can focus their mind in the moment and solidify the foundation of entering samadhi. As the sages said: "Knowing where to stop, one attains stability; with stability, one attains stillness."

When the heart is still, the breath is easily regulated. The subtler the heart, the more refined the breath. When the breath is regulated, the spirit returns. Thereupon, one further stabilizes the spirit, concentrating it within the qi cavity.

The heart, then, is also called spirit. Why? The heart resides in the Crimson Palace. When stirred, it becomes thoughts; when stilled, it returns to being the heart. Returning the still heart to the chamber of spirit, it becomes spirit. Spirit is without thought, without worry, without action—yet within non-action, all actions are possible; within non-use, great use is concealed. This is the supreme medicine of the three grades.

When concentrating the spirit, one must ensure it remains dependent on the breath. Do not let the spirit chase the breath, nor let it manipulate the breath. Chasing the breath scatters the spirit; manipulating the breath agitates it. Simply allow the breath to move naturally, following its own rhythm. Thus, the spirit becomes ever more concentrated.

When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, the spirit has grasped the mechanism of qi. The qi first breaks through primordial chaos—motionless, yet responsive and interconnected. Is this not the active practice of the Daoist cultivator?

**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Wondrous Function of Spirit and Breath**

Spirit is fire; breath is wind. To comprehend the mysterious mechanism of wind and fire, one must properly settle spirit and breath.

The spirit should be inwardly luminous yet silent; the breath should rely on true qi, flowing continuously. Simply stabilize the spirit without chasing the breath. It is like gathering fire in a furnace while drawing wind through bellows. The wind fans the flames, making them burn brighter, and the metal naturally melts. Thus, the wind comes to assist the fire—it is not the fire pursuing the wind.

Yet within this lies a subtle mechanism: to ensure the bellows’ qi blows with focused intensity, the wind pipe must press close to the furnace, allowing it to pass through the regulator. Only then can it fan the furnace’s flames, deepening their azure hue.

When the practitioner gathers spirit and collects qi, it is like fire melting metal. When the breath blows into the Kan (Water) trigram, it is like guiding the pipe close to the furnace, creating the momentum of wind aiding fire. As the furnace’s fire blazes, yang radiance surges. At this moment, spirit is qi, and qi is the elixir—just as fire forges iron red-hot, and red-hot iron is itself fire. This is what Qiongguan Weng meant by “fire is the elixir, the elixir is fire.” When fire and elixir merge, the Golden Elixir is instantly formed. If the breath does not blow inward but merely plays at the throat and nose, it is like the pipe not pressing close to the furnace. Is this not laughable?

**Chapter Thirty-Four: Further Discussion on Spirit and Breath**

When the breath is still, the spirit returns. The method of gathering spirit relies on regulating the breath. When the spirit is settled, the breath rests. The method of regulating the breath also relies on gathering the spirit. For when spirit is preserved in emptiness, the internal breath truly exists. Thus, the breath lingers because of the spirit, and the spirit remains because of the breath. Spirit and breath are balanced, neither fully present nor absent—one does not know whether spirit is breath or breath is spirit. Wind fans the fire, and fire burns with the wind. They sustain and intertwine, so that one does not know whether wind is fire or fire is wind. When the practice is fully refined, there is truly something beyond description in words.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: The Wondrous Use of Qi and Breath**

Cao Yuanjun said: “I tell you all the truth: the root of life has always resided in the true breath.” Why is the true breath the root of life? Because the postnatal breath harmonizes with the prenatal breath, and the prenatal breath is the true qi within the body, stirred by the breath into gentle ebb and flow. At this time, is it the breath moving? Or is it the qi moving? When the breath moves, the qi moves as well—neither is distinct. The breath contains qi, hence it is called the “misty true breath.” The qi contains breath, hence it is called the “bellows of true breath.” When the true breath moves, true qi is born; when true qi arrives, the root of life is born. The root of returning to life, the source of nurturing life, the treasure of protecting life—all truly lie in the true breath.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Wondrous Use of Spirit and Intention**

Spirit values concentration, as the *Cantong Qi* says: “Abide in tranquility and emptiness, inwardly illuminating the body.” Spirit is not intention, as it is said: “To inwardly illuminate the Mysterious Pass, one must employ true intention.” I have heard Chongxu say: “True intention is the right awakening within emptiness.” Qianxu said: “To infuse above and below, the primordial spirit must operate within.” The primordial spirit’s operation is the primordial spirit’s right awakening. One cannot say that the primordial spirit is true intention—they differ in substance and function. For in profound stillness and non-action, the spirit governs and moves in quietude. In composed elegance, intention manages affairs without confusion. Thus, spirit is the lord of the elixir, and intention is its emissary. Spirit and intention truly differ in substance and function. Since they differ in substance and function, they are two. Yet because function arises from substance, they may also be regarded as one. However, there is a further point: to cultivate true intention, one must nurture primordial qi. True intention arises from extreme stillness, thereby perfecting one’s wondrous use. This is what the Dao calls “constantly responding, constantly still,” what the Confucians call “being at ease before contemplation,” and what the Buddhists call “wisdom arising from samadhi.”

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Further Discussion on Spirit and Intention**

At the beginning of sitting with lowered eyelids, spirit and intention need not be distinguished. But when movement and stillness alternate, then spirit and intention part ways. Sometimes one should guard the Central Palace with spirit, and it will not do to substitute intention. This applies when attaining emptiness, preserving stillness, and observing return—such as at the moment of tending the furnace. Sometimes one should guard the Central Palace with intention, and it will not do to lead with spirit. This applies when capturing lead, restraining mercury, and wielding the Celestial Stem—such as during the alchemical union. Why? Spirit is non-action, while intention is action. Spirit is non-action yet all-accomplishing; intention is action with purpose. Spirit is the spirit of intention, and intention takes spirit as its true origin—spirit governs stillness. Intention is the intention of spirit, and spirit takes intention as its right awakening—intention enables movement. To nurture primordial spirit, one must take “no thought” as the foundation, thereby achieving non-action and all-accomplishment. Shangyang’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* says: “The true person lurks in the deep abyss, responding with no thought. Floating and wandering within the compass, employing with no thought. Breathing in harmony, achieving with no thought. The three natures unite, entering with no thought.” The use of no thought is not limited to this. To activate true intention, one must first refine the self, thereby achieving action and purposeful action. Qianxu’s *Jiuzheng Pian* says: “Refine the self to seek lead, welcoming it with the self. Draw fire into the crucible, sending it with the self. Smelt and bathe, guarding it with the self. Warm and nurture, completing it with the self.” The wondrousness of the self’s earth is also not limited to this. Ah, spirit! Ah, intention! They run through the entire process of Golden Elixir cultivation, never to be parted for even a moment. There are other wondrous uses, but they all depend on the practitioner’s own inquiry. I have merely compiled these teachings to open the way.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Debate on Attaining Immortality**

The ancients said: “The highest establish virtue, the next establish merit, and the next establish teachings—all three are immortal.” To preserve the immortal spirit is the Dao. The three are also immortal because they assist the Dao. Benevolent virtue is the substance of the Dao, and humble virtue is its function. Universal salvation is the substance of the Dao, and self-cultivation is its function. As for teachings, they are the record of merit and virtue, the writings that convey the Dao.

Thus do they contend together for immortality.

Now, what decays is common, and what does not decay is sagely. That by which one may contend for immortality lies in having nothing to contend for, yet also in having something to contend for. Having nothing to contend for, one places oneself last and paradoxically becomes first; one softens one’s resolve and yet overcomes the rigid. Having something to contend for, one displays the beard and brows of a man, the backbone of a true hero, the boldness of a champion, and the ferocity of a great soul. Not contending with others for a fleeting moment, one contends with them for all eternity.

Confucius said: “When it comes to benevolence, one does not yield even to one’s teacher.” The teacher fears precisely that the disciple may fail to contend—merely collapsing into cowardice. A former Confucian master said: “The qi of dawn’s clarity and the spirit of the still night differ not at all from those of the sages. If one can expand upon this, even Confucius and Yan Hui would not surpass them.” The Śākya tradition states: “In the stillness of able benevolence, how does one differ from Śākyamuni? In the profound practice of prajñā, how is one distinct from freedom itself?” Daoist texts say: “Did Gautama arise from the earth? Did Zhong and Lü descend from heaven?” All these contend for the Dao and do not necessarily yield to those who came before. Let the aspirant take heed!

The myriad truths and ten thousand sages fundamentally do not begrudge others contending for the Dao.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: On Retiring After Success and Fame**

The *Daodejing* states: “To retire after success and fame is the Way of Heaven.” I hold that the Way of Heaven is also the Way of humanity, and likewise the Way of self-cultivation. Heaven’s success and fame lie in the flourishing of growth and fulfillment; as the seasons turn and beings are nurtured, the heavenly Dao retreats and withdraws, concealing itself in winter’s reign. Such is the Way of Heaven. For humans, success and fame lie in utmost loyalty; having achieved merit, one retires with courage, and having attained fame, one conceals oneself—thus do heroes follow the example of Master Red Pine. Or, success and fame may lie in perfect filial piety: the mutual nourishment of will and body is the merit, and the universal praise of the clan is the fame. When parents reach a hundred years, the filial child’s duty is complete; one retires to preserve life—such is the Way of humanity. For the alchemist, attaining emptiness and guarding stillness is merit without merit; the profound and indistinct is fame without fame. When the return is accomplished, the sacred embryo is formed, and fame is attained, one retires to the ancestral aperture, embracing the One and returning to emptiness—such is the Way of elixir cultivation. Those who comprehend this should reflect on its resonance with virtue and human nature.

**Chapter Forty: On the Unity of Immortal and Buddha Cultivation**

The dual cultivation of nature and life is the essential principle for becoming an immortal, attaining buddhahood, or achieving sagehood. Some claim that Buddhists cultivate nature, Daoists cultivate life, and Confucians govern the world, each with distinct paths—yet this stems from a shallow understanding of their fundamental principles.

In my view: Buddhism emphasizes nature, yet within it lies a special transmission beyond the teachings. It is not that life is absent, but rather that it is spoken of in secret. The emphasis on nature is intended to enable one to establish life through nature, expanding the capacity of nature to illuminate the ten directions without boundary. Daoism emphasizes life, yet within it lies a true transmission within the teachings. It is not that nature is unmentioned, but rather that it is discussed sparingly. The emphasis on life is intended to enable one to comprehend nature through life, securing the root of life to endure through ten thousand kalpas without end.

If the cultivation of nature is perfected yet the external cultivation of life is neglected, true nature will be difficult to preserve, ultimately remaining in empty stillness—how then can one encompass the realms of sand and dust? If the cultivation of life is thorough yet the internal cultivation of nature is incomplete, true life may be preserved, but only the physical body is maintained—how then can one attain spiritual penetration of the three realms?

Only Buddhism possesses a special transmission beyond the teachings, enabling one to establish life through nature, so that the Land of Ultimate Bliss becomes ever more luminous and empty. Only Daoism possesses a true transmission within the teachings, enabling one to comprehend nature through life, so that the Heaven of Great Purity becomes ever more transcendent. Thus, immortals, buddhas, and sages—all engage in dual cultivation, not single cultivation.

When Śākyamuni entered deep meditation, his crown was pierced and his knees were transfixed. When Mahākāśyapa expounded the true meaning, he caused the flagpole of the monastery to topple. What do you make of this?

Master Lü said: “To cultivate nature alone without cultivating life is the foremost illness in spiritual practice.” Master Ziyang said: “Even if you fully awaken to the true suchness of nature, you will still have to discard one body only to enter another. How much better to cultivate the great medicine as well, and swiftly transcend the leaky to become a true person.” These examples may be taken as one corner from which the rest may be inferred.

When prajñā is practiced profoundly, the five aggregates are all empty. When the elixir matures and the great return is achieved, one faces the wall for ten years. At sixty, the ears are attuned; at seventy, the heart follows its desires. Only then are nature and life both perfected, ascending together to the realm of emptiness and transcendence—thus do immortals, buddhas, and sages all attain fulfillment.

The *Song of Enlightenment* by the First Patriarch Bodhidharma states:
*“The three teachings share one method,
Do not regard them as two.
Nature and life must be cultivated together,
So that heaven and earth do not decay.”*

Why, then, must one engage in disputes?

Moreover, there is this further point: the transmission of the three teachings remains unknown to their followers. If they understood this, they would not contradict one another. Each should simply fulfill its own Way and return to the Dao.

Now, suppose there were a master of the great Dao who addressed the three teachings, saying: “The three teachings are the three pillars of my Way. Though divided into three, they are united as one. The Dao cannot be divided, for then it would lack transformation; the Dao cannot be united, for then it would lack a governing principle. Thus, the three pillars establish its ultimate expression.

The Buddhist and Daoist teachings speak of nature while silently transmitting life; the Daoist and immortal teachings transmit life while silently transmitting nature. The Confucian teaching takes the bearing of worldly responsibilities as its urgent task. Nature is rarely spoken of, life is even more seldom mentioned, and both nature and life are cultivated in silence. As a result, the descendants of the three traditions, each adhering to their ancestral lineage, have become specialized schools. They stir the heavens and shake the earth, debating right and wrong, opening boundless realms of contention. When Buddhists attack Daoism, they employ marvelous strategies of overturning emptiness. When Daoists attack Buddhism, they employ divine insights of pointing directly to reality.”

When Confucians attack Buddhism and Daoism, they produce inexhaustible essays and endless sophistry. Yet how could they know that all these are but branches of the Dao? Since the Dao divides into three, how could there be no divergence in its offshoots, no distinction between the heterodox and the orthodox? Why, then, do they not contemplate the root but instead debate the branches?

To regard nature as encompassing life is one current; to regard life as encompassing nature is another; to merge nature and life into one is yet another. These three currents are all currents of the Dao. In their return to the non-being, they are one.

A gāthā says:
Blowing out the bright lamp to play games,
Who knows they strike their own kin?
If I speak of those who attack one another,
It is but scattered blossoms dusting your body.

*Volume Two: Secret Teachings of the Three Vehicles*
By Changyi Mountain Man Li Hanxu
Collated by Chen Yingning of Wanjian

**Reader’s Guide to *Secret Teachings of the Three Vehicles***

1. The author of this book, Li Hanxu, is commonly known as the Western School. Though its main principles do not exceed the scope of the *Triple Unification* and *Awakening to Reality*, having formed its own school, it must possess distinctive features not found in other alchemical classics. Scholars should discern these differences.

2. As practitioners’ efforts progress in stages and their levels vary in depth, the text introduces the theory of the three "river chariots." The first river chariot refers to the first stage of practice, the second to the second stage, and the third to the third stage. However, the path of circulating the river chariot remains singular, without divergence. Do not mistakenly assume there are three separate paths.

3. In the sections on the three river chariots, there may be instances of excessive description or inappropriate analogies. Readers should not cling to the literal meaning or force interpretations.

4. The *Mind-Collecting Method* in the appendix is particularly essential. If one studies it carefully, one will surely benefit.

5. The *Daoist Songs, Poems, and Miscellaneous Writings* also contain subtle meanings. If readers can draw connections and extend understanding, it would be most excellent.

6. This book is an old manuscript, transmitted for over eighty years without ever being printed. Aside from the three chapters on the river chariots, other sections—such as the *Mind-Collecting Method* and *Daoist Songs*—were not originally titled separately nor properly attributed under the *Secret Teachings of the Three Vehicles*. Their arrangement was also disordered. Here, two appendices are newly designated, and the text has been reorganized for the reader’s convenience.

7. Previous alchemical works were composed either to seek external protection or to instruct disciples, not for universal salvation or posterity. Thus, they need not be comprehensible to all, and in fact, precautions were taken to prevent universal understanding. Hence, cryptic terms and obscure names abound, leaving readers bewildered, unsure of their meaning. Often, the intended meaning is concealed, and the truth is obscured. This is why no Daoist practitioner fails to lament the difficulty of reading alchemical classics.

8. If the meaning of this book remains unclear, one should seek answers in *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries*. If *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries* still eludes comprehension, one should consult the *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*, as they can mutually illuminate one another.

**A Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu**

The Perfected One was a native of Changyishan in Lijiahe, Leshan County, Jiading Prefecture, Sichuan. Born on the fourth day of the eighth lunar month at the hour of *yin* in the *bingyin* year of the Jiaqing reign (1786), his mother dreamed, at the moment of his birth, of a Daoist priest entering her home cradling a golden book in his arms; upon waking, she found the Perfected One already born. He was the second of three brothers, with his elder and younger siblings both becoming Daoist priests. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright, and in his youth, he entered the county academy as a scholar. Skilled in the zither and fond of poetry and wine, at the age of twenty-four, he encountered the Patriarch Lü but did not recognize him.

Later, afflicted with a blood-wasting illness, he followed his mother’s command to convalesce in Emei County, where he met Master Zheng Pushan. Master Zheng, a man of the Kangxi era, was a senior disciple of the Perfected Sun, whose personal name was Jiaoluan. Sharing lodgings with him for treatment, the master said, “Minerals, plants, and herbs can only address symptoms. To cure the root, one must employ the wondrous medicine of one’s own body—only then can true solidity be achieved.” Upon hearing this, the Perfected One felt as though awakening from a dream and immediately bowed in reverence, taking refuge under the master. Zheng then transmitted oral instructions, urging, “A great kalpa is approaching; you must swiftly cultivate to save the world. Moreover, you will have a primordial master among the Perfected.”

Later, on Mount Emei, he encountered the Patriarchs Lü and Zhang in a monastic hall. His original name was Yuanzhi, styled Pingquan. The Patriarch Lü changed it to Xiyue, styled Hanxu, with an alternate name Tuanyang, secretly imparting the original sound. After several years of secluded cultivation, he achieved the Golden Elixir. The Three Masters reappeared, exhorting him to hasten in writing books to save the world.

In obedience to the command of the Three Perfected Ones, he composed *Annotations on the Thirteen Classics of the Most High*, *Elucidations on the Scripture of the Great Cavern’s Old Immortal*, and two commentaries on *The Rootless Tree*, collectively titled *Fifteen Daoist Discourses*, also known as *Essentials of Preserving the Body*. He edited and revised the Patriarch Lü’s chronicles, sacred traces, alchemical classics, and salvific texts, naming the collection *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain*. He compiled the complete works of the Patriarch Zhang, titling it *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*. His own writings, including *Ninefold Refinement of the Heart*, *Scripture of the End of Literature*, and *A Treatise on the Postcelestial*, were all published. Additionally, he authored *Inner Chapters of Rounded Peaks*, *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries*, none of which were published.

In the first month of the *bingshen* year of the Xianfeng reign (1856), I visited his abode at Changyishan and beheld his compassionate countenance, which appeared no older than thirty. After taking leave, the master ascended on the eighth day of the fifth lunar month at the hour of *yin*, with an extraordinary fragrance filling the sky for seven days. On that same day at the hour of *mao*, his immortal form manifested at Ziliujing. Following his ascension, his miraculous traces were too numerous to recount in full.

The master had two sons: the elder pursued Confucian scholarship, while the younger tilled the land. His eldest brother had three sons, the eldest of whom, at eleven years old, was intelligent, kind, and filial—qualities the master often praised with admiration. Though his disciples were many, only Zhou Daochang of Jiangxi achieved the Great Elixir, while several others attained the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. My virtue being meager and my karmic affinity shallow, I served the master but briefly. Here, I have merely outlined what I personally witnessed.

Respectfully recorded by his disciple Li Daoshan of Qiaoyang, Jianning County, Fujian.

The Three Chariots refer to three types of *heche* (River Chariots). The first is the circulation of *qi*, which is the *xiaozhoutian* (Small Celestial Cycle) of firing at *zi* and *wu*; the second is the circulation of essence, which is the *yuye heche* (Jade Fluid River Chariot) for warming and nourishing with water; the third is the simultaneous circulation of essence and *qi*, which is the *dazhoutian* (Great Celestial Cycle) of refining precelestial gold and mercury, the Sevenfold Returned Elixir, and the Ninefold Returned Great Elixir. These Three Chariots all rely on the true spirit and true intent to govern their course. If one can comprehend the secret principles of the Three Chariots, then essence, *qi*, and spirit—these three treasures—will be perfectly complete, and the Three Immortals of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity will be attained.

The first River Chariot, the practice of circulating *qi*, is for opening the passes and laying the foundation, obtaining the medicine and congealing the elixir. Its sequence begins with nurturing the true breath within emptiness. Collect the mind, regulate the breath, close the eyes, and preserve the spirit. Stillness upon stillness, purity upon purity. Let go of all things, forgetting the entire body. In utter chaos and profound obscurity, when the work reaches this point, it is like winter in the heavens, when the myriad things flourish and each returns to its root; like night in the sun’s course, when the water clock sinks deep and each quiets its heart. This is the time of no-knowledge, no-perception. Yet who knows that in this moment of no-knowledge and no-perception, the first yang revives—just as winter gives birth to spring, or night turns toward dawn? Suddenly, one is startled: though no smoke is present, it seems as if there is smoke; though no *qi* is present, it seems as if there is *qi*. From the lower *dantian*, it steams up to the heart’s palace, awakening one as if from a dream. This moment of initial awakening is called the *huo zishi* (Living Zi Hour). Swiftly activate the first River Chariot to gather and circulate it; delay, and this formless *qi* will transform into something tangible. This *qi* is called *renqian* (Watery Lead), the postnatal, or the yang fire—hence it is said, “At the *zi* hour, advance the yang fire.” What does advancing the yang fire mean? The practitioner must abruptly turn the newly awakened heart, shifting it past the lower Magpie Bridge to the position just before the Big Dipper. This is the true secret never to be transmitted lightly. Move it to the *weilu* (Coccyx Pass), guarding it without disorder. In an instant, the true *qi* warms gently, passing through the two apertures at the tip of the coccyx, penetrating the spine, ascending to the *yuzhen* (Jade Pillow), and drilling into the *niwan* (Mud Pill Palace). The ancient immortals said: *“Through the double passes of the spine to the crown gate—this is the most revered path in cultivation.”* This is what they referred to. Fools, not understanding the circulation of *qi*, immediately press the tongue to the upper palate to receive the sweet dew. Alas! How laughable and pitiable—all due to not having received proper instruction. Know that in the practice of circulating *qi*, one can only guide the *qi* into the throat. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *“Ingest the mysterious *qi* to attain longevity.”* Thus, this yang fire *qi* is purple-black in color and is called the *xuanqi* (Mysterious Qi). The method of ingestion requires oral instructions to send it into the *qi* pipe. Otherwise, if it enters the food throat, where can the foundation of the elixir be established? One must guide this yang *qi* down the *qi* throat to the *xuanying* (Mysterious Throat), where it transforms into the water of sweet dew. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *“The Mysterious Throat’s *qi* pipe receives the essence talisman.”* This is what it means. The *xuanying* is also called *xuanyong* (Mysterious Obstruction), for when a person’s *qi* reaches this point, it becomes obstructed. Common folk, ignorant of this mystery, expect the *qi* to transform into divine water upon reaching the *niwan*, swallowing it like tea. I fear that even a single drop entering the *qi* pipe would cause unceasing coughing. How could water, a tangible substance, enter the *qi* pipe? Thus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *“Exhaling the clear and inhaling the mysterious, the two *qi* shine—if you encounter this, you will ascend to the Milky Way.”* This means the clear *qi* emerges from the *dantian*, while the mysterious *qi* enters the *xuanying*, the two *qi* transforming into one another. When the *qi* transforms into water, it showers the heart’s palace and returns to the Void Cavity. Treasure and nurture it—this is the foundation-laying. After laying the foundation for a long time, the accumulation deepens, and there comes a moment when, while sitting in stillness as usual, something suddenly emerges from the *dantian* with a sound like thunder and a radiance like lightning—this is the precelestial medicine within the postnatal. Immediately apply the first Chariot to circulate it to the *niwan*, where it first transforms into liquid. Ingesting it, one obtains the *yuye dantou* (Jade Fluid Elixir Head). This is the beginning of obtaining the medicine and congealing the elixir. Thereafter, the work must be continuous and unbroken, deepening the root and securing the stem. This is the subtlety of fully nurturing the elixir; for further details, see the explanation below.

The second River Chariot, the practice of circulating essence, is for drawing out the lead from Kan (Water) and restraining the mercury of Li (Fire), refining one’s nature. Previously, after circulating *qi* for a long time, one obtained the minor medicine and congealed the elixir head. Thereafter, the internal breath flows naturally and effortlessly, firmly guarding the *dantian*. Each morning, while sitting or lying in clarity, the elixir rises to the heart’s palace like a soft ball of cotton. It must be gathered back into the Void, vanishing without a trace, to prevent its loss. The secret says: *“When the spirit returns to the body, the *qi* naturally follows.”* This is precisely that moment. As the embrace deepens over time, suddenly the *dantian* feels like spring water newly born, rippling and flowing. Guard the natural internal breath, refining and tempering it. The water suddenly transforms into hot *qi*, flowing from the inner sides of both hips to the *yongquan* (Bubbling Spring). The spirit must focus on the heels, the true breath following—this is what is meant by *“the true person’s breath reaches the heels.”* After a short while, when the *yongquan* settles into stillness, return the heart to the *weilu*, silently guarding and awaiting. Suddenly, one senses something at the *weilu*—soft like cotton, like a steamed bun, like a mass of *qi*, heavy and sluggish, difficult to move. Immediately adjust the internal breath, concentrate the mind single-pointedly, and intensely refine it. Then, a stream of hot liquid surges from the *weilu*, slowly passing through the spine and surging up to the *niwan*. Only then is it called the Yellow River flowing backward, the canal reversed in its course.

This type of river chariot is what the *Dadong Jing* calls *"harnessing essence to reach the Mud Pill Palace,"* and what Ancestor Lü describes as *"transporting essence into the upper palace"*—it is not the same as circulating *qi*. Within the Mud Pill Palace, the sound of rushing water resonates, and after a long while, the water’s sound ceases, and the spirit rests within it. After maintaining this for a short time, press the tongue upward against the palate, hold the breath in the nose, clench the jaw tightly, brace both hands against the seat, and tilt the head back to face the empty beam. Wait until the golden liquid fills the tongue, then hold the nasal breath without exhaling. With a single gulp, it flows into the windpipe, descending the twelve-tiered tower of the *chonglou*, and the divine water irrigates the Flowery Pond.

This Flowery Pond is unknown to most. Some say it lies beneath the tongue’s root, others claim it is the lower *dantian*—both are incorrect. This Flowery Pond resides between the two breasts, called the upper *qi* sea, separated from the *xuanying* by a single layer. As Bai Yuchan states: *"The Flowery Pond lies precisely within the qi sea."* When the water fills the Flowery Pond, it flows without being retained. Reaching the Crimson Palace, the heart-ground becomes cool and clear. Settling into the Yellow Court, the heart-fire attains supreme stillness. This is called *"drawing lead to restrain mercury, guiding the tiger to subdue the dragon."* Once the two trigrams are united, they circulate endlessly—this is the work of refining the self with jade liquid.

Yet this jade liquid cannot be produced daily; one must first apply the earlier *qi*-circulating practice. After several cycles, it may arise once. When one reaches the stage where jade liquid flows continuously, the Yellow Center becomes pervaded with principle, the skin grows lustrous, the heart-monarch rests in leisure, and the nature-body shines with radiance. Facing circumstances, one forgets emotion; in desire, one transcends desire. Living in the world yet apart from it, the true intent becomes unshakable, the sword’s edge keen. Round and full, luminous and bright, red and pure, gleaming and sharp—this is the time when self-refinement is perfected.

Here, one may proceed to the three chariots’ work, as the following section will explain.

**The Third River Chariot**
This involves circulating the primordial essence-*qi*, which the alchemists call *"mercury welcoming lead,"* the return of passion to nature, the work of seven reversals and nine returns. Once self-refinement is perfected, the mercury-nature becomes spiritually responsive, advancing and retreating freely, the feminine and masculine adapting to change. Only at this stage can one undertake the great work of return and restoration.

The seven reversals and return of the elixir begin by taking the already-formed mercury-nature and calling it the inner elixir. Then, entering the chamber and sitting in a circle, one conceals the inner elixir within the hollow void. Above resembles *Qian*, below resembles *Kun*; the nature-side pertains to being, the life-side to non-being. First, one must enter non-being from being, then generate being from non-being.

Its image resembles *Qian*’s essence sown into *Kun* the Mother, where *Kun* fills its belly and becomes *Kan*. *Kun*’s essence stirs from *Qian* the Father, where *Qian* empties its heart and becomes *Li*. Once *Qian* and *Kun* are arrayed, they are called the crucible (the wondrous aperture of being and non-being). The dual functions of *Li* and *Kan* manifest through this.

At the moment of entering non-being from being, all is silent and still—heart dead, spirit preserved. Soon, one’s own consciousness transforms into things that startle or entice, testing the inner spirit. Then, the demonic generals of the heavens take form as good or evil figures, further testing the inner spirit. If undisturbed by any of these, the primordial spirit remains serene.

After a time, a single yang qi arises—like the return of one yang beneath *Kun*’s yin. I then exhale a yin from *Qian*’s palace to welcome it (kidney qi ascending, heart fluid descending, all by nature’s course), called *"mercury welcoming lead,"* or *"the great exchange of Kan and Li,"* or *"the ebb and flow of inner and outer yin-yang."* Once this flow is established, the Celestial Maiden Taiyi, accompanied by Qiu Lan, presents the feminine sword, plucks it, and sets it as the elixir’s foundation—this is the seven-reversal returning elixir.

With the elixir’s foundation laid, spirit and qi harmonize. The single yang gradually grows into *Dui*, and the *Kan* male transforms into the *Dui* female (this is the time of metaphors like *"the moon at Geng,"* *"the moon on the Western River,"* or *"the crescent moon"*). Because of these two characters, *Dui* and *female*, alchemists call it the *"first essence"* or *"heavenly water"* (a classification by analogy—fools who practice blindly do so because they have not met a true teacher).

When the alchemist gathers this first essence, it is called *"drawing passion back to nature."* After five thousand forty-eight days, when it returns to the Yellow Way, it resembles the full moon of the fifteenth night, with metal and water in perfect roundness. Within the human body, this is the time when the primordial essence and qi surge in abundance.

At this stage, the practitioner must swiftly activate the great river chariot, transporting it to the Mud Pill Palace. Soon, a sweet fluid descends into the throat, as large as a sparrow’s egg or grape, neither musk nor honey, yet exquisitely fragrant—this is the nine-return golden liquid great elixir. When the Daoist ingests this golden liquid, it is then called *"lead entering mercury,"* *"metal merging with wood,"* *"the posterior heaven returning to the prior heaven,"* and *"the infant meeting the maiden."*

When the infant and maiden meet, they are nurtured day and night. Over time, the organs become visible, inner and outer radiance shines, and within, a true one appears, resembling oneself—this is the infant and maiden giving birth to another infant. One who attains this infant must quietly cultivate and cherish it, moving it from the Valley of Spirit to the Heavenly Valley. Then, one may transcend form, ascend to the assembly of immortals, and merge with the Dao.

*Method for Gathering the Heart*
Written by Li Hanxu of Changyi Mountain

Chen Yingning of Wanjian’s Collated *Method for Gathering the Heart* – Preface in Verse

The *Method for Gathering the Heart* unfolds plainly and directly,
Heaven rejoices, free from blame or reproach.
Year after year, tirelessly driving the river chariot,
The heart seems laborious yet is truly at ease.

Last night, the spirit soared to pay homage to the Upper Perfected,
Who sealed me as the Great Perfected of the Teachings of Goodness.
The Dao recounted my affairs of four hundred years,
Three playful descents into the red dust.

Clasping the golden elixir, I alone savor its delight,
Yet I share with the assembly of immortals in silent riddles.
Awakening, I first stir the heart of compassion,
And with my own hand inscribe the *Record of the Jade Ring*.

Distinguishing neither good nor evil, wise nor foolish,
All must gather the heart and sit in emptiness.
Only by entering profound obscurity does one behold the Dao—
The very first step is the finest effort.

*Fundamental Practice in the Method for Gathering the Heart*

The Dao of nurturing life takes true breathing as its root.
As Cao Wenyi said: *“I shall tell you gentlemen the truth:
The stem of life has always resided in true breathing.”*
These are indeed essential words.

The initial practice begins with quieting the heart,
Then sealing the mouth,
Then regulating the breath (when the heart is still, the qi is level—
The unregulated regulation is supreme).

Once the nasal breath is calm and harmonious,
Close the eyes and inwardly observe,
Directing the spirit to the root of the kidneys, below the Yin Bridge meridian
(Before the Valley Gate, behind the scrotum).
After a short while, lift the heart-breath upward into the Cavity of Emptiness
(Behind the navel, before the waist, between the heart and kidneys—
Do not cling rigidly to this location).
Rest the spirit and settle the breath,
Taking naturalness as the guiding principle.

If the heart is too severe, it burns—
One must follow its natural course: this is the civil fire.
If the heart is too scattered, it chills—
One must guard its natural state: this is the martial fire.
The civil and martial fires refine and temper,
Their wondrous application enduring from start to finish.

When the inner breath is even and balanced,
Neither forget nor force it.
At this moment, the heart is like empty space:
With breath as its companion, it is not empty;
With breath as its follower, it is not void.
Between non-emptiness and non-void,
Stillness upon stillness,
Purity upon purity.

The breath flows ceaselessly,
The heart-spirit silently.
At this point, release all things,
Forget both self and others—
This is called *boring into profound obscurity*.

Within profound obscurity, there is qi,
A single spirit alone awakens—
This is true breathing.
When true breathing manifests,
It warms the heart with a melting, tingling sensation.
One must press it back into the Cavity of Emptiness within the body’s chamber,
Accumulating and layering it,
So that the stem of life grows and yang qi naturally lengthens—
Only then can one open the passes and circulate the qi.

Concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath
Are the fundamental practices.
Concentrating the spirit means gathering the already-cleansed heart and entering within.
When the heart is not yet clear, do not close the eyes inwardly.
First, encourage and urge oneself,
Drawing it back,
Cool and serene,
Then gather it into the qi cavern—
This is called *concentrating the spirit*.

Sitting in emptiness,
Neither leaning nor tilting—
This is concentrating the spirit in the void.
Regulating the breath is not difficult:
When the heart-spirit is still,
The breath follows naturally.
I merely guard and follow it,
Illuminating it with the spirit’s light—
This is regulation.

Directing the breath of the Yin Bridge
To meet the heart’s breath within the qi cavern—
The spirit resides within the qi,
Silently focusing on the primordial sea.
Without union, they unite of themselves;
Without contact, they connect of themselves—
This is called *spiritual union across the body’s divide*.

Guard one’s nature, preventing dispersion.
Preserve the spirit, avoiding dullness,
Thus entering profound obscurity and subtle indistinction.

When the spirit halts below the navel, it is called *concentrating the spirit*.
When the qi returns below the navel, it is called *regulating the breath*.
Spirit and breath interdependent,
Guarding their natural purity—this is *not forgetting*.
Following their natural purity—this is *not forcing*.
Neither forgetting nor forcing,
In silence and softness,
The breath becomes lively and the heart at ease.
Employ the *boring* technique,
Taking emptiness as the heart’s dwelling,
And profound obscurity as the spirit-breath’s homeland.

After two or three attempts,
Clarifying again and again,
Suddenly, heart and breath forget each other,
Spirit and qi merge—
Unawares, yang stirs in a flash of enlightenment.

*Miscellaneous Discussions on the Method for Gathering the Heart*

A disciple asked: *“The secret of the Three Vehicles has been fully revealed—
Does this not risk heavenly reproach?”*
Hanxu replied: *“I dare not defy heavenly reproach,
But hope that people may reform and renew themselves.
In all practice, one must first discard the human heart
And seek the heart of the Dao.
Set aside ordinary breathing
And seek true breathing.
Then stabilize spirit and qi,
And bore into profound obscurity.
None of these stages can be omitted.
How could one who enters my Dao remain a petty person?”*

*“In all practice, boring into profound obscurity is the most difficult task.
Yet the primordial qi arises from emptiness—
Only with true profound obscurity
Does true emptiness exist.
Alas! First difficulty, then attainment—
One must be willing to relinquish the whole self.
In the past, I spent seven or eight years in the grotto-heaven
Learning to bore into profound obscurity,
And only then gained a slight grasp.
Today’s learners advance swiftly but retreat just as fast—
How can they enter the Dao?”*

A disciple asked: *“Master, you transmit the Dao so freely—
If an inferior person obtains it and fails in practice,
Will they not turn and revile you?”*
Hanxu replied: *“Without the ridicule of inferior persons,
How could the greatness of my Dao be seen?
The Great Dao first requires purifying body and mind,
Regulating spirit and qi.
At its deepest, one must be able to release all things
And bore into profound obscurity.
Only with such true effort
Will true efficacy appear.
Those who lack effort yet vainly seek results
Will forever remain without them.
Why be troubled by their revilement?”*

A disciple asked: *“As you describe it, can even evil people learn the Dao?”*
Hanxu replied: *“Yes.
I shall recite the admonition:
*‘All that came before is like yesterday’s death.
All that follows is like today’s birth.’*
Refrain from all evil,
Practice all good—
Then one can transform hell into heaven,
And change black qi into crimson light.”*

I possess a three-word formula for those who cultivate the Dao: diligence, sincerity, and constancy—none may be lacking. Yet though one be diligent and sincere, the ultimate outcome must rest in constancy. Confucius said: *“A man without constancy cannot even be a shaman or physician—how much less can he grasp the Dao?”* Confucian scholars study literature and arts, setting years—even a decade—as their term. How could the refinement of mind and tempering of qi require less than the reading of books or writing of essays?

Sincerity is the supreme yin image: in the *Book of Changes*, it is the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, it is *tathatā*. Mencius said: *“There has never been one who was perfectly sincere yet unmoved. Without sincerity, none can move others.”* When “movement” is spoken of in contrast to “stillness,” we know sincerity is a yin image. The Dao of Confucius’ school exalts perfect sincerity as spirit-like, and perfect spirit as ceaseless—both are the great essence and great function of stillness. Thus, entering stillness with sincerity stills the heart without disorder; entering concentration with sincerity fixes the heart without wavering; guarding the center with sincerity keeps the center without bias; entering profound obscurity with sincerity unobstructedly penetrates the subtle. Diligence is the foundation of learning, and in the Dao, there is an even deeper “diligence within non-diligence.” Nurturing the breath of spontaneity, settling the mind of spontaneity, acting without acting, and acting yet not acting—what is called *“subtly continuous as if existing, its use never exhausted”* is truly the utmost of diligence.

To subdue the demon of sleep, one must employ diligence. Racing incense and seated meditation that exhaust the spirit are misapplications of diligence. Those skilled in refining sleep sleep yet do not sleep, do not sleep yet remain watchful—effort naturally continues unbroken, and spirit and qi naturally increase. Staying up through the night instead invites the sleep demon. The *Cantong Qi* says: *“Sleep and wakefulness ever embrace; vigilance discerns presence and absence.”* Mastering this formula, one remains naturally clear and unwavering.

A disciple asked: *“Master Lu Qianxu said: ‘The union of yin and yang is the Most High’s most secret teaching.’ May we hear its formula?”*
I replied: The union of yin and yang is the root of supreme yin and the foundation of profound obscurity. Only by boring into profound obscurity can one achieve this union. I advise first refining within emptiness—stillness upon stillness, concentration upon concentration—until there is no self, no other, not even “nothingness.” Naturally, one enters profound obscurity, and without seeking union, union occurs spontaneously, giving birth to supreme yang from within supreme yin.

The method of union differs between pre-heaven and post-heaven. Pre-heaven union establishes life through nature; post-heaven union unites spirit with qi. Thus, the *Mirror for Ingredients* says: *“It is nature and life, not spirit and qi. The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor.”* Pre-heaven has but a single name; post-heaven distinguishes essence, spirit, intent, qi, hun, po, nature, and emotion. In pre-heaven, refining one suffices—all are present. The key is to extract true yang through union.

The five viscera in the human body have their fixed positions—none may be shifted. Daoists speak of *“inverting Qian and Kun, Kan and Li,”* but how could the heart be moved downward or the kidneys upward? Not so. What is inverted is the spirit and qi within the heart and kidneys: the heart’s spirit descends to meet, the kidneys’ qi ascends to rise. When spirit and qi invert, even the physical heart and kidneys seem inverted, and the formless Qian and Kun likewise invert. Through inverted exchange, a single yang is born within Kun to form Kan, and a single yin is born within Qian to form Li. The Li maiden and Kan youth exchange, like the Dui maiden of the west joining the Zhen youth of the east. South and north shift to east and west, water and fire transform into metal and wood. Metal’s emotion and wood’s nature become the White Tiger and Azure Dragon. When the dragon unites with the tiger, it is like the maiden embracing the infant; when the tiger unites with the dragon, it is like the infant embracing the maiden. In essence, these are the two of nature and life. Within life is nature, within nature is life—two yet one. Thus, Master Ziyang said: *“Zhen and Dui are not east and west; Kan and Li are not south and north.”* One may now comprehend this.

Confucians and Daoists cultivate qi differently. Nurturing the qi of spontaneity can preserve life; nurturing the qi of vastness can embrace both life and death. From ancient times, the resolute and humane—those who risked danger to fulfill their mission or died to perfect their humanity—did so. When cultivating this qi, it is purely the heart of principle, filling the cosmos. Thus, Mencius said: *“This qi is supremely great and firm. Nurtured with uprightness and unharmed, it fills the space between heaven and earth—it is born of accumulated righteousness.”*

Daoists cultivate qi by preserving their true nature, neither waiting for danger to retreat nor death to hide. They are the *“noble ones who act upon perceiving the moment, not waiting for the day’s end”* spoken of in the *Book of Changes*. In the Daoist initial practice, one must nurture the qi of spontaneity. What is this qi of spontaneity? The *Book of Changes* says: *“This qi is supremely small and soft, bending yet nurtured without harm. It gathers within emptiness—born of accumulated essence.”*

The Daoist elixir of return is also the qi of vastness. Once attained, it too can face danger to fulfill a mission or die to perfect humanity. Since ancient times, this has been called *“knife liberation,”* possessing unfathomable marvels and inexplicable transformations, distinct from Confucianism. Some, after death, reappear elsewhere with youthful features, traveling as immortals—this is the accomplishment of the returned elixir, a body beyond the body. The perfected who attain the Dao live as immortals and die as immortals, whether leaving their forms behind or ascending through liberation.

The humane can attain stillness—living long, dying long—like Master Zeng preserving his body or Yan Yuan’s brief life. There are five failures on the Dao: some taste and depart; some superficially admire its name; some begin diligently but end in slackness; some, with stubborn natures yet uninitiated, rashly slander its profundity; some, of dull disposition, remain deaf to calls and blind to awakening. There are three attainments on the Dao: those who know it may become spirit-people; those who love it may become perfected people; those who delight in it may become supreme people.

**Postnatal Sequential Exposition Concludes (Volume Three)**

I have written commentaries on the *Dao De Jing*, *Huangting Jing*, *Dadong Jing*, and *Wugen Jing*, all expounding the function of the prenatal, not the gateway for beginners. To journey far, one starts nearby; to ascend high, one begins low. Without clarity on the postnatal sequence, it is like aspiring to become a *jinshi* or *hanlin* without first passing the *maocai* or *xiaolian* examinations. Thus, I composed *Postnatal Sequential Exposition* as the path of entry, comprising nine stages:

1. Gathering the mind
2. Seeking qi
3. Congealing spirit
4. Expanding the apertures
5. Opening the passes
6. Laying the foundation
7. Obtaining the medicine
8. Coalescing the elixir
9. Refining the self

The Most High said: “Nobility takes humility as its root; height takes lowliness as its foundation.” Postnatal cultivation is the Way of the humble and lowly. Humility is what the master calls *“speaking of the unsightly.”* Lowliness is what the *Scripture* calls *“taking from below.”* To nurture the elixir’s foundation, essence and qi are treasured as jewels. In practice, one must first gather the mind inward, taking the center as the pole, harmony as the principle, spirit as the substance (stillness), and intention as the function (wisdom).

Seeking qi begins with the yinqiao vessel, where it is lively and fluid, neither seen nor heard. Harmony is the work of concentrating qi to softness, embracing spirit in stillness. From stillness wisdom arises; seated illumination returns to its origin. Mating primordial essence generates primordial qi, and expanding the apertures to open the passes becomes effortless.

Primordial essence is the yinqiao meridian’s daily-generated human qi. The practitioner must seek the qi’s active locus and unite it with stillness—this is called the union of spirit and qi. When spirit and qi unite, male and female essences mate, and the true seed is transformed. The true seed is the postnatal crucible’s true qi. The postnatal crucible is where primordial spirit and primordial qi conjoin, hence named the *spirit-father* and *spirit-mother*. When this qi is refined from the crucible, one must congeal the spirit, soften the intention, and use softness to restrain hardness, naturally entering one’s inner crucible. Harmonize, regulate, forge, and refine it, concealing it within the cinnabar field, breathing within the void—this is called the *life-stem* or *embryonic breathing*.

Suddenly, within the inner crucible, something surges forth, leaping and bounding, hissing and puffing, ascending through the thrusting vessel to the heart’s palace—this is the moment of expanding the apertures. When its force is potent, transform spirit into intention, guide it out from the coccyx, striking the three passes to soar to the mud-pill palace—this is opening the passes. Once the passes and apertures are open, proceed with the work of self-nurturance and discuss laying the foundation.

Laying the foundation means drawing their qi and blood to replenish one’s spirit. Though spirit may be robust, fearing its instability, one uses *ren lead* to restrain it. *Ren lead* is born of the union of the two qi. The qi of the *kan* palace is earthly qi; the qi of the *li* palace is heavenly qi. When heaven and earth conjoin, chaos swirls, misty and dense, coalescing into the *Cavern of the Void*. Within the Cavern of the Void, a qi is born—this qi is *ren lead*, the moment of obtaining lead.

Lead’s nature is qi without substance, thus it is clear and ascends. Upon reaching Kunlun, direct the gaze upward so spirit and qi rest in the crown. After a time of congealment, yang reaches its peak and yin arises. Then, press the tongue against the upper palate, regulate the breath, and after prolonged contact, sweet nectar descends like cold springs, drop by drop. Though not abundant, swallow it down the *heavy tower*, sending it with intention to the yellow court. Strangely, a sound like crashing waves arises—one realizes celestial sweet dew is not easily obtained. Descending into the yellow court, it coalesces into the inner elixir.

Thereafter, one must sever desire while in desire, transcend dust while in dust, forget essence amid circumstances, refine lead to subdue mercury, expel the three corpses and five thieves, and dissolve the six desires and seven emotions. Bones and qi become golden essence; skin and flesh turn to jade. Then, inner celestial mechanisms align with outer human affairs—no deliberation, no insistence, no rigidity, no self. Accumulate merit, refine qi, and nurture spirit; as things arise and events occur, the mind’s realm naturally radiates light. Meeting scenes with the heart, the wisdom-sword cleaves through dusty obstructions. Cultivating merit in the human realm, one’s name resounds in heaven. Feasting on celestial emoluments, one enjoys boundless longevity.

At this stage, embrace simplicity and guard integrity, vigilant against peril and danger. Heaven and humanity unite in manifestation; the myriad transformations settle their foundation. Spirit is eternally firm; qi returns to the void—this completes the work of self-refinement. Beginners must first gather the mind, seek qi, congeal spirit, expand the apertures, open the passes, lay the foundation, obtain the medicine, coalesce the elixir, and refine the self—these nine stages are the gateway to the Dao. Once entered, yin and yang return to unity, and there is no going without return. Exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny, one moves from effort to effortlessness, from striving to spontaneity—there has never been a case where the golden elixir failed to form.

**Volume Four: Record of Following the Path**
*(Conclusion of the Scripture on Ninefold Heart Refinement in the Great Dao of Human Primordiality)*
*Handwritten by Hanxuzi, Master of the Purple Radiance Grotto*

**(Discourse on Ninefold Heart Refinement)**

**First Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the unpurified heart. The unpurified heart teems with delusive thoughts and wandering musings. Delusive thoughts arise from craving and desire; wandering musings spring from unawareness. When practitioners sit in meditation, though they may wish to banish worldly concerns, no sooner are delusive thoughts dispelled than wandering musings arise anew. The method lies in *zhi* (cessation) and *guan* (contemplation), through which they may gradually dissolve and refine. *Zhi* means to cease at the space behind the navel’s hall and before the Gate of Life, slightly below its center, where there is a circle of emptiness and void. The heart ceases there and inwardly contemplates, its illumination shining within the void, guarding the qi. It is bound within the compass and square, moving between the circle and the square, each breath returning to the root, uniting with the natural workings of creation. Immovable as a mountain, it establishes the primordial foundation of purity and stillness. From this, a single thread of heart-light connects with a wisp of true qi, merging in profound vastness, tranquil and at ease—this is the initial work of refining the heart and nurturing qi.

**Second Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart in samādhi. Previously, the single thread of heart-light connected with the wisp of true qi; if it could penetrate directly into profound obscurity, it would naturally emerge through the Mysterious Aperture. Yet the heart in samādhi is not steadfast, often swayed by the *shishen* (discriminating spirit), causing heart and qi to separate, and the original face remains unseen. The method lies in the moment when heart and breath interdepend: extinguish all knowing and awareness. The heart abides within qi yet knows it not; qi envelops the heart yet is not perceived. In a state of misty fusion, they become one—this is the work of refining the heart to unite with qi.

**Third Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the returning heart. Previously, in misty fusion, they became one; beneath the heavy yin, a single yang returns—this is called the heart of Heaven and Earth, the Mysterious Pass. At this moment, essence, qi, and spirit all reside in the primordial, the initial separation of the primordial chaos, undivided into true essence, true qi, and true spirit—yet this *is* true essence, true qi, and true spirit. If the heart can remain unmoving, one may immediately gather and circulate them. Yet, encountering sights unseen and sounds unheard, with wondrous scenes before one, one is at a loss; the heart stirs and falls into the posterior heaven, and essence, qi, and spirit separate. The method lies in the moment the Mysterious Pass first appears: immediately tread the fire-clouds, proceed to the *weilü* (coccyx), steady the heart, soften the breath, strike the iron drum to pass the Three Barriers, and rest upon Kunlun—this is the work of refining the heart to advance qi.

**Fourth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the withdrawing and storing heart. Previously, treading the fire-clouds and passing the Three Barriers, heart and qi followed and entered the *nīwán* (Mud Pill Palace). Yet within the *nīwán* Palace, if the *shishen* stirs, the qi chills and congeals, failing to transform into true water, sprinkle, and irrigate the Three Palaces—all prior efforts are lost. The method lies atop Kunlun’s summit: still the heart and abide in quiescence, merging with qi. The qi then transforms into sweet nectar, descending from the upper palate. Curl the tongue to receive the dew, swallow and guide it, pouring the heart into the *jiàngōng* (Crimson Palace), the *huángtíng* (Yellow Court), and the *yuánhǎi* (Primordial Sea), the sound of its passage resonating all the way down. Wait again for the appearance of the Mysterious Pass—this is the work of refining the heart to obtain qi.

**Fifth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart for foundation-laying. Previously, entering the *nīwán* and returning to the qi cavern, the path of the River Chariot is established. From this, proceed with single-minded devotion, day and night without rest—how can the foundation fail to form within a hundred days? Yet if there is laxity or desire, with starts and stops, the elixir foundation will not solidify. Foundation-laying gathers essence and unites spirit; if effort is not diligent, essence and spirit remain scattered—how can one prolong life and serve the Dao? The method lies in following the *zǐ-wǔ* (midnight-noon) cycle, daily drawing and adding, extracting from *kǎn* (Water) to fill *lí* (Fire), accumulating gold to solidify the abdomen—this is the work of refining the heart to accumulate qi.

**Sixth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart to complete nature. Previously, with the River Chariot turning and essence gathered to unite spirit, the numinous root is replete. From this, heart-fluid descends and kidney-qi ascends—this is the union of *kǎn* and *lí*. In profound obscurity, there is a sign, vast as the tide: half is water-qi, misty as fog; half is cloud-qi—this is the initial stirring of metal and water, the stage of refining the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir. If the heart is not single-minded, the task of completing nature remains unfinished. The method lies in the moment when metal and water first arise: from the cinnabar field, they divide and descend to the *yǒngquán* (Bubbling Spring), instantly converging at the *weilü*. Harmonize the true breath, stir and dance it, so it surges upward to the Heavenly Valley; trickling down, it falls into the Yellow Court. Thus, irrigating daily, the heart-ground becomes cool and clear. Blood transforms into cream, intent congeals into earth, and within earth, mercury is born. Mercury’s nature is round and luminous, unchanging in encounter with things—like a spirit-sword in hand. Mencius said, “He who exhausts his heart knows his nature.” Daoists call this the Yin Elixir or Inner Elixir—this is the work of refining the heart to illuminate nature.

**Seventh Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-illumined nature. Previously, the River Chariot of metal and water was called “inner refinement” by the immortals. At this stage, there is still the work of outer refinement. By uniting outer with inner, the true heart gathers and does not scatter. Though the inner body is illuminated, mercury’s nature is prone to flight; though inner refinement is achieved, the Yin Elixir is easily corrupted. If preservation is not pure, the heart-nature is extinguished once more. The method lies in blending the emptily luminous heart and the wondrously existent nature with cinnabar and earth, planting them in that domain.

That domain is empty, yet I fill it with substance; that domain is nonexistent, yet I bring it into being. Casting the existent into the nonexistent, infusing the substantial into the void. The dead heart remains unmoved, and in an instant, the primordial qi emerges from the formless. The first period manifests as one Yang, akin to *Zhen*. The second period manifests as two Yangs, akin to *Dui*. At the moment of the second period, it is precisely the time to conjoin the Elixir. From that side issues a thread of true qi—its metaphor is the tiger born from water. From this side descends a speck of mysterious radiance—its metaphor is the dragon emerging from fire. The two, dragon and tiger, meet in union; nature and destiny intermingle in mutual resonance. A great battle ensues, as though heaven and earth were plunged into darkness, and both body and heart become utterly still.

Suddenly, the three Yangs stir into motion, akin to *Qian*. Like tides, like fire, like mist, like smoke, like thunder, like lightning, like snow, like blossoms—within the body, the Yang lead shines brilliantly. I then wield the sword, grasp the seal, tread the *gang*, pace the *dou*, rousing the primordial harmony. With fierce firing and extreme refinement, it pierces the Three Passes and ascends to the *Niwan*, every pore of the body opening—unlike the earlier Jade Liquid River Chariot. Swallowing and ingesting it, the primordial governs the acquired; nature and destiny merge into one—this is the Great Return. Nature pertains to fire, its number seven. Destiny pertains to metal, its number nine. Returning to the origin and reverting to the source, thus is revealed the seven-return, nine-reversion, and the Golden Liquid Great Elixir. Henceforth, lead comes to restrain mercury, the heart remains ever luminous, and mercury ceases to waver. This is the work of refining the heart to preserve spirit.

**Eighth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-subdued heart to enable communion with spirit. Previously, the seven-return, nine-reversion, with lead restraining mercury, has stilled the heart. Yet it must be warmed and nurtured, so that the qi within the body wholly transforms into spirit, and the spirit within the body can roam beyond. Thus, taking the twelve months of the year, excluding the *mao* and *you* months for bathing, the remaining ten months are for advancing and retreating—hence the term "ten-month nurturing," not implying ten months of effort. Otherwise, though the heart is stilled, it remains inert. Refining and forging it, the numinous heart becomes daily more apparent. Numinous, it moves; moving, it transforms; transforming, it transfigures—thus arises the phenomenon of spirit departing, no longer deluded by worldly sentiments. This is the work of refining the heart into spirit.

**Ninth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-numinous heart to return it to emptiness. Previously, the work of nurturing ran deep, and the spirit, having emerged, is no longer confused. Following the heart’s desire, all is fitting; treading upon clouds and mist, traversing the isles of the sea—such is the joy attained. Yet if the numinous heart is not empty, it cannot embrace the ten thousand existences. Thus arises the necessity of refining emptiness. Refining emptiness, the heart’s vastness expands, and the myriad existences all become nonexistent. A single qi of pure emptiness spirals between heaven and earth. It is I, yet not I; it is emptiness, yet not emptiness. Though the world may perish, only emptiness remains indestructible. Though the cosmos may obstruct, only emptiness knows no hindrance—thus the spirit fills the void, and the Dharma pervades the realms of the sands. This is the beginning and end of heart refinement; nothing surpasses it.

The immortals take Laozi as their patriarch. In his dealings with the world, Laozi never contended with others. Outwardly, he relinquished glory and splendor; inwardly, he cultivated longevity. Serene, harmonious, settled, and still—non-action in accord with nature. Yet in non-action, all the world’s heterodox arts, restless clamor, bizarre and strange conduct, cunning schemes, and tumultuous deceits are not of Laozi’s teaching. To say "natural" is to act and move in accord with feeling and reason, flowing with the transformations of creation. Abiding in the center without bounds, contemplating emptiness without form. Attaining emptiness and preserving stillness, deeply concealed yet seemingly vacant. Neither flaunting the extraordinary nor establishing the peculiar, thus the histories call him an ancient reclusive gentleman. The *Daodejing*’s five thousand words draw upon ancient sayings to establish its discourse. It may be applied to governing the world and cultivating the self. Though we, in our daily reading of the *Daodejing*, may not grasp its profound meaning, in our hearts and conduct, we secretly aspire to emulate it. In the depths of mountains and secluded valleys, two or three like-minded companions keep company, wandering amidst mist and clouds, staff in hand, singing of the sagely transformation—unaware, unknowing, following the patterns of the Emperor on High, using this as a means to conceal our inadequacies.

One day, while visiting a Daoist abbey, I came upon several volumes of the *Yuanqiao Waishi*, which expounds the learning of extending life without straying from Laozi’s Dao. Among them was the *Thirteen Classics with Annotations*, all works of Laozi. The commentary on the *Daodejing* was the most refined and detailed. Appended at the end was the *Nine Layers of the Path*, even more accessible and plain. I inquired of a Daoist priest, "Who is the Master of the Tree’s Shade?" He replied, "A recluse among farmers." Thus, I sought the master at Juanshan, and he deemed me a kindred spirit to [Xu] You and [Ni] Qian. He imparted to me the true mechanism. Upon returning, I had the *Thirteen Classics* printed and placed in bookshops to manifest the master’s compassionate intent. Additionally, copies of the *Daodejing* and *Nine Layers* were printed and distributed to Daoist and Buddhist temples.

This book is concise in length yet complete in true instructions. For our small circle, it is convenient to practice and study, fulfilling ourselves and others—does not its potential lie herein? Reflecting on the master’s words about accepting disciples, each of us, following the Daoist lineage, established names for ourselves beyond the worldly realm, like streams and rivulets flowing into the great river. Zixia received teachings from Huiweng, and we, as his successors, share a deep connection. Alas! Among the affairs of heaven and earth, those like us few fools neither need nor are able to contend.

At seventy, Daoyu’s years have grown long; Daosheng, too, nears the threshold of old age; and Daohe is no longer young. What joy can there be within these mountain forests? Only that we bear this single commentary on the *Daodejing* and this single chapter of the *Nine Layers*, singing long songs among cliffs and valleys, our voices echoing through the clouds over the streams—each forgetting our surnames and ages.

In the month of *Nánlǚ* during the *Dūnyīn* year of the Daoguang reign, inscribed by the Three Recluses of Mount Shu.

**Preface by Master Pure Yang**

The *Daodejing* of Lord Lao teaches "non-action as action." The *Zhengyi* commentary elucidates "non-doing as doing." The Dao Ancestor transmitted it; his descendants expounded it, making the Great Dao ever clearer. Then there is one called Hanxuzi, a transcendent talent: golden script entered his dreams, and he was born into a family beneath the trees. His lineage, dwelling in Juanshan, has long transmitted purity and sincerity. That he was endowed with a jade scepter was only fitting.

From childhood, he possessed extraordinary insight; in maturity, he cultivated the mysterious. Once he read the *Fanghu Waishi*, he secretly aspired to ascend to truth and enter transformation, standing beside Master Lu at my side. Hearing of him, I sought him out, assuming the guise of a mountain Daoist. I brought Qianyu with me to observe his resolve. He dwelt in seclusion on the eastern slopes of Mount E, serene and taciturn, indifferent to glory and profit, often contenting himself with a single qin to express his will.

After we met, we kept company for years. I often spoke to him of the profound mystery, and he grasped it instantly. Thereupon, he exerted his talent and composed the *Yuanqiao Waishi*, a counterpart to Master Lu’s work. Thus, where Lu has the *Xuanfu Lun*, he has the *Daoqiao Tan*; where Lu has the *Jiuzheng Pian*, he has the *Xuntu Shuo*—all works of pure truth. Yet his most wondrous achievement is his commentary on the *Daodejing*, which serves as an eternal lamp for all ages. He titled it *Donglai Zhengyi*, standing equal to Master Lu’s *Nanhua Fumo*. These two masters may truly be called those who excel in discoursing on Laozi and Zhuangzi.

In annotating this scripture, there are five faults and three virtues. The five faults are: leaning toward governance of the world, the first; leaning toward cultivation of the self, the second; or knowing the Dao encompasses both self and world yet failing to align one’s words, ultimately straying into side paths, the third; not recognizing that the supreme Dao’s practice requires first pacifying the people and enriching the state to achieve non-action—if one begins by discussing stillness, it will inevitably drift into emptiness, the fourth; not recognizing that the supreme power of virtue demands returning to the root and restoring life to be deemed "having action"—if one begins by discussing sagehood and divinity, it will inevitably resemble mere hymns of praise, the fifth.

What are the three virtues? Harmonizing inner and outer, the commentary distinguishes primary and secondary, further revealing the scripture’s vast meaning—this is the first virtue. Connecting the lineage’s sprouts and veins, filling gaps and ensuring coherence, so the scripture’s meaning flows unimpeded—this is the second virtue. With true realization in the heart and no Zen obstructions in speech, enabling the scripture’s meaning to shine forth—this is the third virtue.

I have long lamented that the *Daodejing*’s essence remains obscure in the world, wishing to take up my brush and annotate it. Yet to this day, I remain unsatisfied. Now, seeing Hanxu’s work, which possesses the three virtues and avoids the five faults, had it appeared a thousand years earlier, other commentators would have had no need to annotate it, and Daoists would not have had to speak further.

Thus, I joyfully undertake its evaluation and annotation, storing it in the famous mountains and transmitting it to scholars of aspiration. The purpose of this evaluation is also to borrow the true meaning of this commentary to supplement what I have not annotated, revealing it through these annotations.

**Poem on the *Donglai Zhengyi***

Master Huiweng’s preface sets the critique,
His own preface further opens the gate to virtue.
Again, we see purple qi arriving from Guanzhong,
Directly beholding the flourishing descendants of Li’s lineage.
Wishing to guide later generations to share the same path,
Able to make the primordial Dao ever more revered.
How many commentators lack such a work?
The treasure case is long guarded, enshrined on Kunlun.

**Another Poem**

One commentary can unlock the Dao’s profundities,
Once more, purple qi arrives from the east.
A true scholar, plucking the qin and playing the flute,
A great debater, expounding the scriptures and discoursing on the Dao.
I dwell in Fanghu, gazing upon the azure sea,
You ascend Yuanqiao, pressing down Penglai.
Today, seated together by the river pavilion,
Reciting the *Nanhua*, we laugh at our own folly.

**Another Inscription**

The Dao resides in the body though the self dwells in clouded mountains,
Profound and potent, the spirit’s qi is most majestic.
Writing books beyond the isles of Qingdao and Yanchi,
Quelling the flames of the cinnabar field in tranquil stillness.
People call him the Great Abbot,
I playfully dub him the Old Man of the Great Wall.
Relying on this commentary to fence the *Daodejing*,
All scriptures’ words resonate in harmonious realization.

—Respectfully inscribed by the Heavenly Immortal Bai Qiongguan.

**Commentary on the *Daodejing* (*Dongyan Zhengyi*)**
Purified and bathed in reverence, the Master of Purple Radiance Grotto of Yuanqiao Mountain, Hanxu Sheng, annotates.
Proofread and published by the Dao-following disciples Zhu Daosheng and Li Daoyu at Yueyang Tower.
**Chapter One**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
That which is called the Dao—
inwardly, it governs the self; outwardly, it governs the world,
the Dao of daily use and constant practice.

The Dao’s hidden subtlety cannot be spoken,
yet its manifest signs can be spoken.
Encompassing both manifest and hidden,
it is at once most vast and most minute—
thus the Dao is no ordinary Dao.

The name in the realm of the Limitless cannot be named,
yet the name within the Supreme Ultimate can be named.
Born of the Limitless, the Supreme Ultimate,
it is both still and moving—
thus the name is no ordinary name.

**Supplementary Note:**
What all people follow is called the Dao.
That which can be spoken is what can be described.
The Dao that is not ordinary—this is the Great Dao.

To depict its form is called naming.
That which can be named is what can be likened.
The name that is not ordinary—this has no fixed name.

“Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
Named, it is the mother of the myriad things.”
Nameless—this is the Limitless.
Named—this is the Supreme Ultimate.
From non-being to being,
truly, there is no fixed name.

In the primal undifferentiated state of the Limitless,
there were no omens, no forms,
no sounds or scents to which it could be likened—
thus the Dao is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
After the Supreme Ultimate divides,
there is generation and nurturance,
evidence of creation to be observed—
thus the Dao is the mother of the myriad things.
The “myriad things” refers to all under Heaven and Earth.

Before Heaven and Earth existed, this Dao already was—
giving birth to Heaven, to Earth, to humanity, to all things,
as if a great father and mother.
By speaking of the mother, the father is implied.

“Always without desire, observe its mystery;
Always with desire, observe its manifestations.”
(*Manifestations* here meaning *apertures*. The *Yongle Encyclopedia* omits the character *gu* [故]; one edition omits *chang* [常].)

Mystery is the nameless thing—thus it congeals,
observed in constant stillness.
Manifestations are the named thing—thus they move,
observed in constant response.
Without desire, with desire—
constant stillness, constant response.
Observe the nameless through desirelessness,
observe the named through desire.
The Daoist alchemists take the Mysterious Pass as the aperture of being and non-being—
this is their source.

These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names,
together called the Mysterious.
Mysterious within the Mysterious—
the gate of all wonders.

The “two” are the mystery and the aperture.
Being arises from non-being—thus they emerge from the same source.
Non-being transforms into being—thus they bear different names,
yet though different, they remain the same.
The aperture of being and non-being—both are one Mystery.
Observing its mystery through desirelessness, one attains one Mystery.
Observing its aperture through desire, one attains another Mystery.
The two Mysteries return to the one Mystery.
The Mysterious encompasses all wonders—
the gate of all wonders lies herein.

**Chapter Two**
(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Nurturing the Self” chapter; Peng’s edition calls it the “Excellence” chapter.)

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises.
Thus being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low incline toward each other (high as above, inclining as reversal),
Sound and echo harmonize,
Front and back follow one another (the character *xing* [形] in the phrase is rendered as *jiao* [较] in Wang Bi’s commentary).

*Yi* [已] means cessation, or departure (*Guangyun*).
Beauty and ugliness are most opposed.
Knowing beauty as beauty, ugliness must cease.
Goodness and un-goodness are most distant.
Knowing goodness as goodness, un-goodness must depart.

Our innate celestial truth is all beauty and goodness.
Only after being stained by the desires of the posterior world
do ugliness and un-goodness arise.
Yet one cannot but rid oneself of human desire
and seek the celestial truth.

Only by taking emptiness and numinosity as essence,
transformation and movement as function,
can being arise from non-being, non-being from being;
first difficulty, then ease;
long shapes short, short shapes long;
high and low reverse;
like seeks like, as sound answers sound;
the child races behind,
then the noon sun descends before.

This is the Dao of governing the self.

Thus the sage engages in “non-action,”
enacts the teaching of “non-words.”
The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them,
gives life yet does not possess,
acts yet does not rely,
accomplishes yet does not dwell.
Only by not dwelling does he not depart.

This continues the above discussion of governing the self.
The sage’s governance of the self is the work of non-action.
The sage’s teaching of the self is the teaching of non-words.
Engaging in it to seek his will,
acting to attain his heart’s intent.
The myriad things arise in multitude, looking to him,
awaiting the sage’s ordering—
yet the sage does not refuse.

How could he merely not refuse?
He has the merit of giving life to the people,
yet the sage does not consider it his possession.
He has the merit of governing,
yet the sage does not rely on it.
When great works are accomplished,
he retires to rest—
like the Yellow Emperor visiting Dao on Mount Kongtong,
like Emperor Shun wearying of toil and ascending his throne.
Later generations’ heroes and worthies,
accomplishing great deeds and boldly retiring—
all do not dwell.

Not dwelling means not clinging.
Only by not clinging to merit
does one again seek the Dao of governing the self.
Guarding the self without departure,
one becomes a perfected person.
Governing the self can govern the world;
perfecting oneself can perfect others—
thus it is.

Who says Laozi’s Dao entirely upholds quiescence and extinction?

**Chapter Three**
(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Pacifying the People” chapter; Peng’s edition calls it the “Non-Action” chapter.)

Not exalting worthies prevents the people from contending;
not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing;
not displaying what may be desired keeps the heart from disorder.
Thus the sage’s governance:
empties their minds,
fills their bellies,
weakens their ambitions,
strengthens their bones.
Ever keeping the people without knowledge, without desire—
so that those with knowledge dare not act.
Acting through non-action,
then nothing remains ungoverned.

The closing passage of the previous chapter spoke of the sage governing the world, accomplishing merit yet not dwelling in it, returning to seek the Dao of governing the self. Yet even in the sage’s governance of the world, this Way of governing operates not by exalting worthiness and ability to compete with the people—thus the mind for fame is already dimmed, and the people do not contend. Not prizing goods and wealth to vie with the people—thus the mind for profit is already severed, and the people do not steal. Not displaying what may be desired and desiring it—thus the mind for desire is already eliminated. The people’s hearts, being thus, are not disordered; the sage’s heart, being thus, is also not disordered. The excellence of governing the world all stems from the excellence of governing the self. Thus the sage’s governance of the self, though non-action, leaves nothing ungoverned.

Fame, profit, and desire all absent,
one guards the center to empty the mind.
Fame, profit, and desire all purified,
one nurtures qi to fill the belly.
Moreover, the will and qi harmonious and gentle,
weakness is employed;
the bones’ texture firm and unyielding,
strength is embodied.
Thus one’s self remains tranquil and indifferent,
at peace with the world in non-affair.
Therefore the people, too, are without knowledge, without desire,
embracing their pristine simplicity—
so that those with wisdom in the world cannot act,
nor dare to act.
Such is the sage’s governance through non-action.

**Chapter Four**
(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “No Source” chapter.)

The Dao is empty, yet its use is never exhausted.
Profound indeed, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
It blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles,
softens their glare, merges with their dust.
Deep and still, it seems ever present.
I know not whose child it is—
it appears before the image of the Lord.

The sage’s Way of non-action lies entirely in emptiness and its application.
*Chong* means emptiness.
The Dao employs emptiness as its function;
its capacity embraces heaven and earth, the state and the family,
yet never appears full—
abysmally it resembles the primal ancestor of the myriad things.
It blunts the world’s sharpness without harm,
untangles the world’s knots without labor,
for its emptiness dissolves sharpness and entanglement.
It harmonizes the world’s brilliance without obscuring,
merges with the world’s dust without defilement,
for its emptiness forgets brilliance and dust.
Only its empty essence is perceived,
constantly abiding in its tranquil nature—
seeming to exist, yet truly without existence.
Ask whose child it is, and none can say;
its name appears before the image of Heaven’s Lord.
This is what is called the beginning without beginning,
the first of the first, the heaven before Heaven.

**Chapter Five**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Emptiness in Use” chapter; Peng’s version titles it the “Guarding the Center” chapter.)*

Heaven and earth are not benevolent—
they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
Heaven and earth have no intention of benevolence;
they merely meet the needs of the myriad things.
And the myriad things each fulfill their own needs,
each serve their own use.
This non-benevolence is in truth the utmost benevolence.
If they waited to be benevolent before nurturing life,
then every single thing would require heaven and earth to bestow favor in order to live—
this would inevitably lead to insufficiency.
Only by not providing beasts with their straw
do beasts eat straw on their own.
Only by not feeding dogs for men
do men feed dogs on their own.
Thus the measure of benevolence becomes even more vast.
Straw dogs are mentioned,
yet fruits, vegetables, fowl, and swine can be inferred.

The sage is not benevolent—
he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.
The sage, in harmony with heaven and earth,
also allows the hundred clans to each fulfill their own nurturance,
each nurture themselves—
this is what is called “accomplishing through non-action.”

Between heaven and earth,
is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
the more it moves, the more it yields.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
better to guard the center.

Heaven and earth, the sage,
do not create sustenance for the myriad things or the hundred clans,
yet the myriad things and the hundred clans naturally obtain their sustenance.
This is due to the body of emptiness at the center,
its capacity for universal nurturance.
Heaven and earth are divided into two realms,
and between these two realms lies a vast emptiness—
like a bellows without a bottom, a flute with open passages.
Qi flows back and forth, acting without contrivance,
thus emptiness can contain all things without exhaustion.
Its center holds all, moving silently,
ever expanding its full capacity—
inexhaustible within.
Heaven and earth do not speak,
nor does the sage.
If they spoke excessively,
words would have limits,
and limits could be exhausted.
Thus it is better to guard the center alone.

**Chapter Six**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Forming Images” chapter; Peng’s version titles it the “Valley Spirit” chapter.)*

The valley spirit does not die—
this is called the mysterious female.
The gate of the mysterious female
is called the root of heaven and earth.
Subtly continuous, it seems to exist;
its use is never exhausted.

The sage guards the center to govern the self,
for the center has the power to nourish the valley spirit.
The valley spirit is the original nature.
*Gu* (valley) suggests emptiness;
*shen* (spirit) suggests numinosity.
When the nature’s body is empty and numinous, it is not obscured.
Not obscured means it does not die.
Yet why is the valley spirit also called the mysterious female?
*Xuan* (mysterious) refers to heaven;
*pin* (female) refers to earth.
When heaven and earth unite, the mysterious female is formed—
within it lies a vast emptiness.
Confucians call it the subtle and hidden,
a realm of neither seeing nor hearing.
Buddhists name it *that*—
a truth beyond good and evil.
The sage governs the self
by borrowing the empty mysterious female
to nurture the empty and numinous valley spirit.
Thus the valley spirit’s name is given to the mysterious female—
this is naming according to function.
One *xuan*, one *pin*—
one *qian*, one *kun*.
Confucius said: “Are *qian* and *kun* not the gates of the *Yi*?”
The *Cantong Qi* states: “*Qian* and *kun* are the gates of the *Yi*.”
The so-called “two apertures method,”
where metal and qi mutually assist,
is precisely this gate of the mysterious female.
Yin and yang come and go within it;
*kan* and *li* unite within it.
It is the chamber where male and female unite,
the place where the sun and moon exchange light.
The sage inverts it to make it the gate of life;
ordinary people use it in sequence, making it the door of death.
The union of earth and heaven is no other than this.
Thus it is also called the root of heaven and earth—
the root where heaven and earth mutually reside.
The root of heaven and earth
is the place of returning to the origin and reverting to the primordial,
the realm of refining qi and transforming spirit.
“Subtly continuous, it seems to exist”—
this is the cultivation of the valley spirit,
natural fetal breathing.
“Its use is never exhausted”—
this is the external furnace’s regulation,
natural alignment with the fire.
“Not exhausted” means not labored.

**Chapter Seven**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Concealing Brilliance” chapter; Peng’s version titles it the “Selflessness” chapter.)*

Heaven is eternal, earth enduring.
The reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring
is that they do not live for themselves—
thus they can live long.
Therefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,
sets himself aside and finds himself preserved.
Is this not because he is without self-interest?
Thus he can achieve his self-interest.

Heaven is eternal, earth enduring—
this is the Way of long life.
Yet the reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring
is that they are still when closing, active when opening,
still when gathering, active when dispersing,
generating life abundantly,
covering and bearing all without self-interest—
only then do they attain this long life.
If heaven and earth were self-interested in their life,
the lives of things would not flourish,
and heaven and earth would harm their harmony.
The natures of things would not be upright,
and heaven and earth would damage their centers.
The harm to the myriad things
is the harm to heaven and earth.
Only by not being self-interested in their life,
but taking the lives of all beings as their own life.

The ceaseless generation of all beings *is* the long life of heaven and earth—thus they attain long life. The sage emulates heaven and earth. Therefore, in nurturing life, the sage is yielding and weak, seemingly placing the self last to seek life. Yet by gradual filling and fulfillment, in truth he places the self first to obtain life. By guarding the center to control the exterior, he seems to cast life aside as if without life. Yet by first forgetting and later preserving, he preserves his life to possess life. All this arises from not privately possessing the Way. Thus the sage’s tranquility and simplicity restore the people’s nature to purity and goodness. The sage’s longevity brings the people’s lives to fullness and longevity. The great Way is without self-interest—yet in this, the sage appears to possess life for himself. The absence of self-interest becomes his self-interest—this is the ultimate.

**Chapter Eight**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the "Transforming Nature" chapter; Peng’s version titles it the "Supreme Virtue" chapter)*

The supreme virtue is like water.
Water benefits the myriad things without contention,
dwelling in places others disdain—
thus it nearly approaches the Way.
In dwelling, it is good at lowliness;
in heart, it is good at depth;
in association, it is good at kindness;
in speech, it is good at trust;
in governance, it is good at order;
in affairs, it is good at ability;
in action, it is good at timing.
Only by not contending does it avoid blame.

The Way values humility—
by descending, it ascends—
hence it is called "supreme virtue."
This supreme virtue is compared in power to water.
Water’s goodness lies in benefiting the life of all things,
making them all sufficient without contention.
Yet water’s nature flows downward,
often dwelling where others disdain.
Though people may despise it,
ultimately water suffers no harm.
It benefits others without claiming merit,
taking weakness as its aspiration—
thus water nearly approaches the Way.

The goodness of human nature should resemble water’s goodness.
Holding to a humble nature,
all actions become good.
Without a contentious heart,
one chooses dwelling in good places,
conceals the heart in good depth,
associates with good kindness,
delights in good trust,
governs with good order,
handles affairs with good ability,
and acts in good timing.
In every place and circumstance,
one is yielding, good, and non-contending.
Only by not contending does one avoid resentment and blame.
Compared to water, which others may still despise,
humans can descend yet ascend—
thus they surpass the Way in subtlety,
transcending even water in spirit.

**Chapter Nine**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the "Moving the Unyielding" chapter; Peng’s version titles it the "Holding Fullness" chapter)*

To hold and fill it—
know when to stop.
To shape and sharpen it—
it cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall,
none can guard them.
When wealth and nobility breed arrogance,
one invites one’s own misfortune.

*To hold*: to obtain.
*To shape*: to probe.
Once one has obtained qi,
to harbor the desire for fullness
is the beginning of loss—
thus it is better to stop.
When one probes one’s treasures
and suddenly harbors a keen, sharp intent,
this is the omen of certain decline—
thus it cannot be long preserved.
If one should stop yet does not,
is it not like gold and jade filling the hall,
which none can guard?
If one should preserve yet does not,
is it not like wealth and nobility breeding arrogance,
inviting one’s own misfortune?

This is the way of humans.
To withdraw when achievements are complete and fame is attained—
this is the Way of heaven.

Moreover, consider the Way of heaven:
Heaven does not speak of achievement or fame,
yet takes the flourishing of generation and growth as its achievement and fame.
When things mature and their time comes,
heaven and earth withdraw and shift.
Concealing themselves in winter’s season,
they nurture the yang life to come.
What does humanity observe in the Way of heaven?

**Chapter Ten**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the "Ability" chapter; Peng’s version titles it the "Mysterious Virtue" chapter)*

Can you carry your *po* and embrace the One without separation?
Can you concentrate your *qi* to attain softness, like an infant?
Can you cleanse and purify your mysterious mirror without flaw?
Can you love the people and govern the state without action?
Can you open and close the gates of heaven without the feminine?
Can you comprehend the four directions without knowledge?

To generate and nurture,
to generate without possessing,
to act without relying,
to lead without dominating—
this is called mysterious virtue.

*To carry*: as a cart carries a load.
*Nourishing*: as in the *ying* and *wei* [nutritive and defensive qi].
*Wei* pertains to yang, while *ying* pertains to yin.
*Ying-po*: the yin *po* [corporeal soul].
Some say *ying* is *po*—
to take *ying* as *po* is a mistaken interpretation.
One must understand that when speaking of the yin *po*,
the yang *hun* [ethereal soul] is already within it.
On the fifteenth day of the eighth month,
the *hun* fully infuses the moon’s *po*,
and the moon becomes full, purely yang.
The sage, at this moment,
employs the river chariot to carry it,
and the yang metal becomes his own—
as the scripture says, “Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete.”
Having obtained the One,
one will not lose the One.
The sage carries the *po* and returns,
embracing the One to dwell—
thus the earth’s *po* captures the cinnabar mercury.
Therefore, can one not separate from it?

In the tenth month, warm cultivation—
the inner fire is natural.
With warmth constantly present,
the infant embryo grows.
The sage concentrates *qi* to attain softness—
this is the inner fire.
Thus can one be like a nurtured infant.

*Mysterious vision* is inner observation.
To cleanse and purify the mysterious mirror
is to observe inwardly in clarity and stillness.
Inward observation in clarity and stillness
leaves the heart without flaw or burden—
this is what is meant by:
“Observe emptiness as empty,
and emptiness itself is empty.
When the object of emptiness is gone,
even ‘no emptiness’ is gone.
When ‘no emptiness’ is gone,
profound stillness remains.”

To love the people is to pacify them;
to govern the state is to enrich it.
Only when the people are at peace and the state is prosperous
can one practice governance without action.
In cultivating the self,
stabilizing essence is pacifying the people,
and sufficiency of lead is enriching the state.
Refining the self stabilizes essence;
returning the elixir suffices the lead.
Only after refining the self and returning the elixir
can one practice the Way of embracing the One without action—
it is the same.

In cultivating the self,
guarding the feminine is the work.
In regulating spirit and nurturing the embryo,
one cannot but guard the feminine.
Yet when the gate of heaven is broken through
and the yang spirit moves in and out freely,
opening and closing at will—
can one then be without the toil of guarding the feminine?

In cultivating the self,
knowledge is disturbance.
When the sage’s body is perfected,
the spirit of knowledge transforms
into right enlightenment.

So clear and luminous that the four directions are unimpeded—can one then be without knowledge?

Moreover, there is the further work of begetting the child and producing the heir, the exchange of the crucible and the division of the embryo. There is the capacity to accumulate blessings and virtue, to establish merit and aid the world. Yet though one begets, one does not possess that which is begotten—emptiness shatters into dust. Though one acts, one does not rely on that action—compassion is vast and boundless. The heart that protects the state and blesses the people persists for a thousand kalpas, ten thousand kalpas, ever thus, yet does not boast of heavenly dominion. This is truly called the mysterious virtue.

**Chapter Eleven**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Uselessness”; Peng’s edition titles it “The Chapter of Utility.”)*

Thirty spokes share one hub;
where it is empty, there lies the use of the cart.
Clay is kneaded to make a vessel;
where it is empty, there lies the use of the vessel.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room;
where it is empty, there lies the use of the room.
Thus, what is present serves as advantage,
while what is absent serves as use.

The thirty-six spokes of the wheel mirror the movements of the sun and moon. Yet the hub lies at the very center of the cart, through which all axles pass. Hollow within, with spokes converging without—thus the hub is fundamentally empty, yet therein lies the use of the cart.

*Shan*: water mixed with earth.
*Zhi*: sticky clay, the material of bricks and tiles.
When clay is first shaped, there is no vessel. But once kneaded and fired, it becomes the use of a vessel. A room gains light through doors and windows; without them, it is as if there were no room. Once carved and adorned, it becomes the use of a room. Thus, what is present serves as advantage, while what is absent serves as use. Being arises from non-being—this is generally the case.

**Chapter Twelve**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Restraining Desire”; Peng’s edition titles it “The Chapter of the Belly.”)*

The five colors blind the eyes;
the five tones deafen the ears;
the five flavors dull the palate;
riding and hunting madden the heart;
rare and precious goods corrupt conduct.

Therefore, the sage attends to the belly, not the eyes—thus he discards the one and embraces the other.

*Shuang*: loss.
*Kuang*: recklessness.
Rarities and treasures are things all men contend for. Thus, carrying valuables invites harm even while traveling. The damage wrought by colors, sounds, flavors, hunting, and goods is such that the sage holds them in contempt. He guards his inner treasure and scorns external things—thus he discards the one and embraces the other.

---

**Chapter Thirteen**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Disdaining Shame”; Peng’s edition titles it “The Chapter of Honor and Nobility.”)*

Favor and disgrace are like alarm;
regard great calamity as you would your own body.

Favor is like alarm—thus one must deeply conceal the jade.
Disgrace is like alarm—thus one must firmly establish the root.
This is the image of a mind roused and a will striving.

Regard the body as noble—thus one delights in the Dao and rests in glory.
Regard calamity as the body—thus one harmonizes light and silences slander.
This is the method of embracing the origin and guarding the true.

What is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm”?
Favor is base—gaining it is like alarm, losing it is like alarm. This is called “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”

“Favor is base” means that glory is ever shifting, always subject to decline—thus gain and loss cannot be relied upon. Gaining it is like alarm, losing it is like alarm: whether gaining or losing, one remains vigilant and strives without cease. This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”

What is meant by “regard great calamity as you would your own body”?
The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body. Once I have no body, what calamity could I have?

Thus, one who values the body as the world can be entrusted with the world;
one who cherishes the body as the world can be entrusted with the world.
This passage expounds on valuing calamity, first clarifying that having calamity must lead to being without calamity.

Yet the cause of great calamity lies in the present form of the body—thus calamity may befall it. But once the shell is shed and the spirit preserved, calamity cannot touch it. Or if one remains in the world while concealing true qi within, veiling one’s light and obscuring one’s traces—what great calamity could disturb such a one?

Thus, one who esteems the body and regards it as the world’s entrusted charge, who does not dare to slight this body of a thousand gold pieces, can be entrusted with the world. This is the lesson Huang Shigong imparted to Zhang Liang. One who preserves the body and regards it as the world’s reliance, who does not reveal his rare and transcendent talents, can be entrusted with the world. This is the admonition Zhang Jiuling gave to the Earl of Ye.

He who excels at preserving the body excels at governing the self.
He who excels at governing the self excels at governing the world.
Confucius said: “The hibernation of the dragon and snake is for the sake of preserving the body. Making use of things to secure the body is for the sake of exalting virtue.” The noble man conceals his talents within, awaiting the proper time to act—what disadvantage could there be?

**Chapter Fourteen**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Praising the Mysterious.”)*

The invisible is called "even"; the inaudible is called "rare"; the intangible is called "subtle." These three cannot be exhaustively questioned, so they merge into one. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—returning to nothingness, this is called the form without form, the image without image, the state of vagueness. Meeting it, one does not see its beginning; following it, one does not see its end. Holding to the ancient Dao, one governs the present being. To know the ancient origin is called the discipline of the Dao.

The realm of the unseen and unheard is the Gate of Rarity and Evenness. The Gate of Rarity and Evenness is where nature and emotions reside. Evenness conceals nature; rarity conceals emotion. Thus, it is unseen and unheard. Yet the true intent moves between them, intangible when grasped—hence named "subtle." These three cannot be divided or exhaustively questioned, so they should be blended into one, allowing the three to meet. Above and below correspond to "closing above and closing below." Neither bright nor dark, it is as if existing yet not existing. "Vast and boundless" means caution and reverence, like closing above and below, existing yet not existing. Cautious of what one does not perceive, its beginning and end cannot be named. Vague and indistinct, within it there is something—returning to nothingness. This is what is called the form without form, the image without image. Without form or image, this is the state of vagueness. The truth of vagueness has no beginning or end—is this not the primordial qi? The ancient Dao is the original substance. The present being is its current function. Though ancient and present differ, one may hold to the ancient to govern the present, from non-being to being. To know what precedes the primordial origin and extend it to what follows is called the discipline of the Dao. Recording years, months, days, hours, even a single tally or moment—all are disciplines of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifteen**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Manifesting Virtue”; Peng’s version titles it “The Chapter of Preserving Fullness.”)*

The ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—too deep to be known. Precisely because they could not be known, one can only forcefully describe them: cautious as if crossing a river in winter, vigilant as if fearing neighbors on all sides, dignified as if a guest, yielding as if ice about to melt, simple as if uncarved wood, open as if a valley, merged as if turbid.

Who can, within turbidity, wait for clarity through stillness? Who can, in tranquility, await life through prolonged movement? Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness. Only by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.

From ancient cultivators, knowing this subtle and profoundly penetrating Way of governing the self—so deep it cannot be fathomed—they dared not recklessly seek to understand it. Even when describing it, they could only forcefully do so. The seven "as if" phrases in this chapter are all descriptive words. What they describe are scenes and images. Who can, within heavy turbidity, patiently await its light clarity? Who can, with tranquil and simple spirit, long await its gradual arising? Waiting and awaiting, one dares not seek excess. Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—this is not seeking excess. Only by not seeking excess can one uphold constancy. Not creating anew avoids contradicting the true Dao.

Wei Boyang said: *"At the furnace, fix the weights precisely; five parts water are in excess. Taking these two as true, gold outweighs its original state. The third does not enter, and fire accompanies both."* This is the Way of not seeking excess and upholding constancy. Could Cloud Teeth Master’s *Triple Concordance* also embody the *Daodejing* of the Supreme One without creating anew?

---

**Chapter Sixteen**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Returning to the Root”; Peng’s version titles it “The Chapter of Emptiness and Stillness.”)*

Attain utmost emptiness; guard deep stillness. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. All things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to destiny. Returning to destiny is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune. Knowing constancy brings acceptance; acceptance brings impartiality; impartiality brings kingship; kingship brings heaven; heaven brings the Dao; the Dao brings enduring. To the end of one’s days, one will not be imperiled.

"Attain" means to place. "Emptiness" is an empty vessel. "Utmost" means fulfilling its Way. "Guard" means to reside. "Stillness" is non-action. "Deep" means careful and unwavering. "The myriad things arise together" means all things have a beginning. "I" is the master of all things. "Observe" means to await. "Return" means to revert.

The cultivator places the primordial spirit within the empty vessel, thus obtaining its Way. Having obtained the Way, one should reside in a quiet, inactive place, carefully and unwaveringly preserving it. Awaiting the empty vessel’s generation of things, one then awaits their return to the root. Thus, going forth and returning, life transforms and spirit becomes luminous. Knowing this, the Way of seven returns is complete.

The myriad things flourish abundantly and arise together, moving from non-action to action, from action back to non-action, still able to follow the mechanism of transformation in their comings and goings. Thus, spring’s birth, summer’s flourishing, autumn’s gathering, winter’s storing—withering and falling, they return to their root. Things return to their root, moving and then still—hence called stillness. Stillness means returning to nothingness and reverting to creation—hence called returning to destiny. Returning to destiny, one knows the true constancy of the Way. Constancy in stillness can constantly respond. Serene, it becomes profoundly clear—hence knowing constancy is called illumination.

People of the world, not knowing the true constancy of the Way lies in returning to the root and destiny, engage in reckless endeavors, sinking into the forms and names of action, depleting their spirit. Thus, reckless action brings misfortune.

Should one not, then, know constancy? Knowing constancy, one attains capacity. Capacity: to contain the public. Public: greatness. Kingly: nobility. Heaven: reverence. The Dao: the ultimate of emptiness and nothingness. It is to say, containing one’s origin within stillness, one can thereby magnify creation and enter the realm of the most sagely and spiritual, returning to the truth of utmost emptiness and nothingness. Embodied in emptiness and nothingness, one endures unharmed. "No body": nothingness—with spirit but no form, water and fire cannot harm, metal and stone cannot destroy, tigers and rhinoceroses cannot devour, blades and weapons cannot sever. What peril could there be?

**Chapter Seventeen** *(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this "The Pure Wind Chapter"; Peng’s version calls it "The Supreme Chapter")*

The supreme,
The people below merely know of its existence.
The supreme: the sage. The sage dwells above the multitude, hence called "supreme." Some say "supreme" refers to the highest principle—this too is valid.
The sage engages in non-action;
Practices the teaching without words;
Does not boast of ability, so the people do not contend;
Does not covet profit, so the people do not crave;
Does not indulge desire, so the people are not disordered.
Without contention, craving, or disorder, the supreme possesses these, and the people below possess them as well.
"Know of its existence" refers to the people below.

Next,
They draw near and praise him;
Next,
They fear him;
Next,
They revile him.
When trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.
Thus, he values his words.
When his work is accomplished and affairs are settled, the hundred clans all say, "We are naturally so."

The next level is the successor to the Dao.
The supreme Dao accomplishes through non-action and governs without speech.
The next cannot practice non-action or refrain from speech, so they draw near with affection and praise to inspire transformation.
Yet the next, unable to inspire through affection and praise, must rely on laws and decrees to awe and subdue.
And the next, unable to awe and subdue through laws, must employ cunning and artifice to control.
When the Dao descends to cunning and artifice, the wind has already declined—what remains is not worth observing.

Thus, he returns to the root of trust in the heart.
When the ruler values trust, the people dare not but respond with sincerity.
When the ruler’s trust is sufficient, the people speak with true feeling.
When trust is insufficient, the people will be untrustworthy.
Yet the sage must govern through trust.
Valuing words means speaking with caution.
When the ruler personally practices substantive governance, moving with ease and inspiring trust, the people submit without proclamations—thus, he must be circumspect in his commands.
When his work is accomplished and affairs are settled, the hundred clans, unaware and unknowing, follow the celestial pattern, all saying, "We are naturally so."

*My humble observation:* The meaning of this chapter can be applied to governing the world and to cultivating the self.
The highest virtue is cultivated through purity and stillness; the six senses are all settled, practicing non-action without contrivance.
The next is cultivated through love and reverence, moved to penetrate and connect, practicing non-action yet with contrivance.
Yet the next relies on legal discipline to control.
And the next employs cunning and scrutiny—what is called "artifice," the way of action with contrivance.
None surpasses trust in subtlety. Trust pertains to earth; in the elixir of golden cinnabar, from beginning to end, the wondrous function lies purely in the intent of earth—all is naturally so.
Profound indeed are these words, applicable to governing the world and to cultivating the self.

**Chapter Eighteen** *(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this "The Shallow Customs Chapter"; Peng’s version calls it "The Great Dao Chapter")*

When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.
When wisdom and intelligence arise, there is great deceit.
When the six relations are disharmonious, there is filial piety and compassion.
When the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.

Here the chapter speaks of the Way of governance—its flourishing and decay—yet it also reveals the principle of self-cultivation. Let us consider both aspects.

First, the affairs of non-action give rise to policies of kindness and grace, just as the loss of the primal undifferentiated state gives rise to the work of return and restoration. When clarity and artifice are employed to scrutinize and seek, the feelings of the people become ever more deeply concealed—just as when cunning and mechanism are used to probe and extract, the medicinal substances grow ever more adept at mutual concealment.

Within the court, filial piety and compassion serve to harmonize the disharmony of the six relations, just as entering the chamber to cultivate serenity serves to still the restlessness of the six senses. When the state has loyal ministers, they serve to rescue it from benightedness and chaos—just as when the Mysterious Gate holds true gold, it serves to rescue from decline and exhaustion.

Then it laments the pristine and unadorned governance of the ancient age, and the cultivation of the highest virtue through non-action—how distant its wind has become, how long it has been lost.

**Chapter Nineteen**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this "The Return to Simplicity Chapter"; Peng’s version calls it "The Three Abandonments Chapter")*

Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.
Abandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or robbers.
These three, as mere ornament, are insufficient—thus they are made to belong to something greater.

Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce selfishness, diminish desire.

*Abandon* means "great" or "ultimate."
When ultimate sagacity does not employ wisdom, the wind is wholly honest and unadorned, and the people gain manifold benefit.
When ultimate benevolence does not employ righteousness, customs become wholly harmonious, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.
When ultimate skill does not scheme for profit—those who scheme for profit are all followers of cunning and mechanism—if the ruler is without cunning, the people are without thieves.

Sagacity is insufficient in wisdom, benevolence is insufficient in righteousness, skill is insufficient in profit.
These three—sagacity, benevolence, and skill—are like having substance without ornament.
In their primal, undifferentiated state, the Way is one and the wind is uniform; thus the people are each made to have their proper place, following nothing but their essential reality.

Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce selfishness, diminish desire—
the ornament of the people is also insufficient, yet it is beautiful.

**Chapter Twenty**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this "The Different Customs Chapter"; Peng’s version calls it "The Abandonment of Learning Chapter")*

Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow.
Between "yes" and "ah," how great is the distance?
Between good and evil, what is the difference?
What others fear must not be feared.

To abandon learning is to be complete in the Dao and replete in virtue.
When the Dao and virtue are complete, what sorrow can there be?
When the sage regards the multitude, it is as if "yes" is too direct and "ah" is too flattering.
Good is lovable and evil is detestable, yet one does not know how far apart they truly are.
The sage has no sorrow, and thus no fear.
What others fear is the difficulty of abandoning learning—
how can one fear what others fear and not seek to abandon learning?
Thus it is said: "What must not be feared is fear itself."

Vast indeed, it has no end!
The multitude bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
as if ascending the springtime terrace.
I alone am tranquil, without sign or omen,
like an infant who has not yet learned to smile;
adrift, as if with no place to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
while I alone seem to have lost everything.
I have the heart of a fool—how muddled!
The common folk are bright and clear,
while I alone am dim and dull.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
while I alone am dull and obscure.
Vast, as if dark;
still, as if without place to abide.
The multitude all have their uses,
while I alone am stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
and value feeding on the Mother.

The great Dao of prior Heaven is like the unopened state of primordial chaos—it accomplishes without action, governs without speech.
Thus the multitude all attain the transformation of simplicity and thickness, bustling in mutual peace and joy.
They share in the nourishment of its virtue, as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice.
They wander within its realm, as if ascending the springtime terrace.
Even the customs of Huaxu cannot surpass this.
The sage says: I alone am bland and tranquil, utterly without sign or omen, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.
*Adrift*—riding the Dao, thus it is called "adrift."
Ascending and descending, circulating within—ceaselessly moving, as if with no place to return.
Thus the multitude all have ground to seek, while I alone, in this state, seem to have left the world and stand apart.
Then the multitude are all wise, while I alone seem foolish—yet this is the great skill that appears clumsy.
Vast, like the darkness of heaven and earth; fleeting, like the boundless coming and going.
From this perspective, the multitude all have their uses, while I alone am dim and dull, drifting like one foolish, stubborn, and coarse.
Others do not share my way, and I too differ from them.
A single grain of yang elixir, called the Mother Qi—I alone seek and feed upon it to attain longevity.
That the multitude do not equal the sage is like the distance between "yes" and "ah," between good and evil.
Is this not why the sage alone proclaims the abandonment of learning?

**Chapter Twenty-One**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this "The Empty Heart Chapter"; Peng’s version calls it "The Vast Virtue Chapter")*

The bearing of vast virtue follows only the Dao.
As for the Dao as a thing—only vague, only indistinct.
Indistinct, vague—within it there are images.
Vague, indistinct—within it there are things.
Dark, profound—within it there is essence.
Its essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity.
From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart,
through which it surveys the origins of the multitude.
How do I know the origins of the multitude are thus?
By this.

*Vast* means "empty" or "great."
The vessel of the most empty and greatest virtue can contain wondrous things, thus the great Dao enters therein.
As for the Dao as a thing—vague and indistinct, without fixed form.
Speaking of its departure from nature, it is originally without image.
Now indistinct, now vague—what is without image seems to have image.
Now vague, now indistinct—what is without thing has already become thing.
Some say *indistinct, vague* rhymes with *image*.

"Vague and indistinct" rhymes with "thing."
Yet the sage in establishing words inverts the order of characters—this itself embodies the inversion of the Dao’s method.
"Indistinct, vague" is the original image of nature.
"Vague, indistinct" is the thing nature plants: with male below and female above, they unite to form essence—a single thing, yet truly two things conjoined.
Thus, in the upper phrase there is image; in the middle phrase, thing; in the lower phrase, essence.
The structure of the phrases again embodies the Dao’s method.
Essence arises when the fire of nature descends to illuminate and evoke response, thereby revealing the hidden emotion of *Kan*. Yet it is subtle and profoundly unfathomable, hence called "dark, profound."
The essence within this darkness is true essence.
To obtain true essence, one must know true sincerity.
Thus, within it there is first sincerity—vast as the surging tide, fluid as melting ice.
The cultivator, awaiting the first arrival of this sincerity, precisely when it is essence, must then subdue and seize it.
With not a moment’s delay, the golden immortal is within reach.
It is called true gold, the primary meridian, true water, spirit-water, true lead, lead-qi, white tiger, tiger-qi—yet it does not depart from true essence.
Therefore, from ancient times to the present, the name of this true essence cannot be discarded by any scripture.
Thus, by observing the truth of this one thing, one surveys the principles of the myriad things—none but revere this primordial qi.
"Surveying the origins of the multitude" means examining the beginnings of all things.
Hence it is also said: "How do I know the origins of the multitude are thus? By this."

**Supplementary Note:** The fourfold repetition of "within it" in this chapter reveals the single aperture of the mysterious pass—the gateway of the great Dao. To refine lead and obtain the elixir, one need not look beyond this.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "The Chapter of Benefiting Through Humility"; Peng’s version titles it "The Chapter of Complete Return")*

To yield is to be whole,
to bend is to be straight,
to be hollow is to be filled,
to be worn is to be renewed,
to have little is to gain,
to have much is to be perplexed.
Therefore the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for the world.
Not displaying oneself, one is illuminated.
Not asserting oneself, one is distinguished.
Not boasting, one achieves merit.
Not priding oneself, one endures.
Only by not contending does the world have nothing with which to contend against one.
The saying of the ancients, "To yield is to be whole"—was this empty talk?
Truly, wholeness returns to it.
"To yield is to be whole" means reduction becomes increase.
"To bend is to be straight" means softness overcomes hardness.
"To be hollow is to be filled" means humility receives benefit.
"To be worn is to be renewed" means decay heralds return.
"To have little is to gain" means knowing sufficiency avoids disgrace.
"To have much is to be perplexed" means greed and desire lead to delusion.
These are the words of the ancients before the Most High, speaking of the essential Dao of cultivating the self.
Thus, when the sage governs the world, he must embrace the One as the model for all under heaven.
To embrace the One is to not display oneself, not assert oneself, not boast, not pride oneself.
Wang Bi’s commentary aligns these four phrases with "To yield is to be whole," but this interpretation is misguided, for *illuminated*, *distinguished*, *enduring*, and *achieving merit* are intrinsic explanations of their respective phrases.
Someone asked: "Why does the ancient saying again cite 'To yield is to be whole'?"
I reply: The Most High invokes the ancients’ words on cultivating the self to introduce the principles of the world, hence saying, "Was this empty talk?" If one can reverently guard sincerity in the One, then the world will surely return wholly to this model.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "The Chapter of Emptiness and Nothingness"; Peng’s version titles it "The Chapter of Spontaneity")*

Rare words arise spontaneously.
Thus, whirlwinds do not last the morning,
nor do torrential rains last the day.
Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth.
If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,
how much less can man?
Therefore, those who engage in the Dao:
the Dao-aligned merge with the Dao,
the virtue-aligned merge with virtue,
the lost merge with loss.
Those who merge with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them.
Those who merge with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them.
Those who merge with loss—loss delights in obtaining them.
When sincerity is insufficient, there will be those who do not trust.
"Rare words" means no sound, and also no action.
For those who enter the Dao, non-action and spontaneity are the foundation.
With non-action, there is supreme tranquility; with spontaneity, there is constant progress.
Otherwise, like whirlwinds and torrential rains—though brought about by Heaven and Earth—they cannot endure long.
How much less can man?
Thus, all who follow the path of the Dao, cultivating virtue and practicing the Way, must be spontaneous to unite with the Dao and virtue.
"Loss" means non-action; acting through non-action naturally attains the affairs of non-action.
The Dao, virtue, and loss all delight in this spontaneity and non-action.
When trust and conduct are insufficient, there must first be those who do not trust spontaneity.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "The Chapter of Suffering and Grace"; Peng’s version titles it "The Chapter of Tiptoeing and Striding")*

One who tiptoes cannot stand,
one who strides cannot walk.
One who displays himself is not illuminated,
one who asserts himself is not distinguished,
one who boasts achieves no merit,
one who prides himself does not endure.
In the Dao, these are called: "leftover food, redundant conduct."
Some beings detest them, thus those with the Dao do not dwell in them.
"Tiptoeing" means gazing upward.
"Striding" means rushing forward.
Tiptoeing raises the head and cannot stand long.
Striding strains the feet and cannot walk long.
Displaying oneself, asserting oneself, priding oneself, boasting—all belong to those who do not trust spontaneity and ultimately achieve nothing.
In terms of the method of practicing the Dao, this is like eating too much or walking too far—one cannot cultivate.
Compared to a dog, overfeeding causes illness.
Compared to an ox, overwork causes exhaustion.

Thus it is said: some beings detest them—how much more so would humans? Therefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell in such states.

**Chapter Twenty-Five** *(Heshang Gong’s version titles this "The Chapter of Primordial Image"; Peng’s version, "The Chapter of Primal Chaos")*

There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before heaven and earth.
Silent, oh! Empty, oh! Standing alone without alteration, circulating without exhaustion—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
I do not know its name; I style it "Dao," and by force name it "Great."
Great means passing, passing means far-reaching, far-reaching means returning.
Thus the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great.
Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them.
Humans emulate earth, earth emulates heaven, heaven emulates the Dao, and the Dao emulates spontaneity.

Chaotically formed—unbroken, nameless.
The primordial qi of vast chaos, indistinct and without name.
Nameless, it is that which is born before heaven and earth.
Silent: pure. Empty: void.
Standing alone in the realm of purity and emptiness, unchanging in its true constancy—nothing but this chaotic formation.
One thing circulates, pervading the ten thousand things without peril—thus it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.

Since the dawn of creation, the Ancestor of the Dao has known that before the primordial chaos, there existed this Mother-qi.
Heaven, earth, humans, and the ten thousand things—all are gestated within the womb of this Mother-qi.
When asked its name, not knowing, we first style it with the character *Dao*.
*Dao* combines *shou* (head) and *chuo* (movement)—that which moves and generates before heaven and earth.
Forced to name it, we call it *Great*.
*Great* combines *yi* (one) and *ren* (person)—that which emerges before the multitude of things.
From this, through myriad ages, it has been called the Great Dao.

Great, it goes everywhere—above to Qian, below to Kun, passing and leaving you behind.
Passing, it reaches everywhere—north to Kan, west to Dui, far and yet attaining.
This Dao, when exhausted, must return.
Perhaps emerging from Zhen, aligning with Xun, manifesting in Li, completing in Gen.
Great indeed! The Dao, with heaven, earth, and the king, together form the four greats within the realm.

Without the Dao, heaven would not be known—heaven is great.
Without heaven, earth would not be covered—earth is great.
Without earth, the king would not be borne—the king is also great.
The king occupies one of them, standing foremost among the people.
As lord of humanity, the king does not depart from the human.
Humans stand upon earth, thus emulate earth.
Earth lies beneath heaven, thus emulates heaven.
Heaven lies within the Dao, thus emulates the Dao.
The Dao attains its subtlety in spontaneity, thus emulates spontaneity.

**Chapter Twenty-Six** *(Heshang Gong’s version titles this "The Chapter of Weighty Virtue"; Peng’s version, "The Chapter of Weighty Stillness")*

Weight is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness.
Therefore, the noble person travels all day without departing from the balance of weight and lightness.
Though there be splendid sights, they dwell in serenity, transcending.
How could one who rules ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly before the world?
Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler.

Weight is water; lightness is fire.
Fire is born within water—thus weight is the root of lightness.
Stillness is stability; restlessness is wisdom.
Wisdom arises from stability—thus stillness is the ruler of restlessness.

Observe the noble person whose talent and virtue are equally weighty: though traveling all day, they do not depart from the balance of weight and lightness, seeking to apply it with ease.
Though there be splendid sights, they dwell in serenity, transcending, not allowing splendor to disturb their stillness.
Alas! The master of the Crimson Palace, honored as one who commands ten thousand chariots—how could they suddenly treat their person lightly before the world, forgetting all?
They wholly fail to uphold weight to nurture lightness, wholly fail to guard stillness to govern restlessness.
I fear that a single impulse of lightness loses the true water within the worthy—fire then has no root.
Fire is born of water; water is fire’s function—thus it is called "minister."
A single impulse of restlessness loses the true stability within the heart—wisdom then has no ruler.
Wisdom arises from stability; stability is wisdom’s master—thus it is called "ruler."

**Chapter Twenty-Seven** *(Heshang Gong’s version titles this "The Chapter of Skillful Application"; Peng’s version, "The Chapter of Essential Subtlety")*

The skillful traveler leaves no wheel tracks,
the skillful speaker utters no flaw or blame,
the skillful reckoner needs no counting rods,
the skillful closer uses no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened,
the skillful binder ties no cord or knot yet cannot be undone.

Thus the sage is ever skillful in saving people—
therefore no one is abandoned.
Ever skillful in saving things—
therefore nothing is abandoned.
This is called inheriting clarity.

Therefore the good person is the teacher of the ungood,
the ungood person is the resource of the good.
If one does not value one’s teacher,
if one does not cherish one’s resource,
though wise, one is greatly deluded.
This is called essential subtlety.

"Leaves no wheel tracks"—the natural river chariot;
if there were tracks, it would be forced visualization and transference.
"Utters no flaw or blame"—the natural ancestral transmission;
if there were flaws, it would violate the宗旨.
"Needs no counting rods"—the natural fire timing;
using rods would be rigid adherence to hexagrams and strategies.
"Cannot be opened"—the natural inner restraint;
if it could be opened, it would be mere pretense of closure to the senses.
"Cannot be undone"—the natural coagulation;
if it could be undone, it would be forced aggregation.

Thus the sage abides in the constant goodness of the natural,
establishing oneself and establishing others—
all people may be esteemed.
Perfecting oneself and perfecting things—
all things may be contemplated.

Inheriting illumination means using prior awakening to awaken later awakening, with the heart transmitting in succession to arouse enlightenment—this is what is called inheriting illumination. Thus the good person fully illuminates the luminous virtue; even the unvirtuous person, by drawing near, also partakes of luminous virtue. The unvirtuous person, unaware of self-reflection, is seen by the good person, who then reflects inwardly. They alternately take each other as teachers, alternately rely on each other. If one does not regard mutual reliance and mutual teaching as precious and beloved, then self-proclaimed cleverness, though possessing wisdom, is still like profound delusion. The essential subtlety of self-cultivation lies nowhere beyond this.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "Returning to Simplicity"; Peng’s version titles it "Constant Virtue")*

"Know the masculine, guard the feminine,
and become the world’s stream."
Becoming the world’s stream,
constant virtue does not depart,
returning to the state of infancy.

This passage holds two meanings, both of which cultivators of the body should know and uphold.

First: the masculine emits, the feminine transforms.
As the *Cantong Qi* states:
"The masculine yang spreads its dark emanation,
the feminine yin governs the yellow transformation."
Knowing this, one can emit and act;
guarding this, one can transform and nurture.
When feminine and masculine interact,
metal is concealed within water,
and in turn water generates its metal.
When the metal qi is sufficient, the tidal signal arrives—
its force like a canal stream.
Flowing backward and ascending,
it becomes the world’s canal stream.
Yet though it is a canal stream,
with yang fire advancing and yin tally arriving,
the constant virtue of returning to the root and reviving life cannot be abandoned.
Thus it returns to the earthen cauldron to nurture the fetal infant.

Second: the masculine returns, the feminine conceals.
As the *Wuzhen Pian* says:
"Within the masculine, the feminine nurtures the sacred embryo."
If discussing the principle of generating things,
when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises—
this is the feminine harboring the masculine.
If discussing the practice of nurturing things,
when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises—
this is the masculine harboring the feminine.
When the masculine harbors the feminine,
having obtained the masculine’s return to conjoin the elixir,
one must further rely on the feminine’s concealment to warm the elixir.
Its force is like a ravine—
flowing from above downward,
descending into the stream.
Thus the way of guarding the feminine
is like the world’s ravines,
possessing flow and return.
This is the true, constant primordial virtue,
which cannot depart from its place.
Returning to the stream
is like returning to the Yellow Court.
Returning to the state of infancy
means entering stillness to nurture the sacred embryo.

"Know the white, guard the black,
and become the world’s model."
Becoming the world’s model,
constant virtue knows no error,
returning to the boundless.

Here the sage exhausts the principles of feminine and masculine
and reveals their subtleties,
again borrowing color imagery to discuss them.
The white is metal essence;
the black is water’s foundation.
Metal essence is the masculine yang,
spread into the feminine to generate it.
Before this essence existed,
the Kun mother’s body was originally empty.
Through exchanging radiance with the Qian father,
Kun became replete and formed Kan.
Once the Kan form was complete,
the moon emitted the Dui trigram—
this is called metal within water.
Metal within water
truly relies on the Kun mother’s nurturance to form,
hence it is called the mother qi.
As the *Wuzhen Pian* says:
"Extracting the white from the black makes the elixir mother."
The mother qi possesses white light,
called yang light.
When yang light appears,
one moves one’s own mercury to welcome it—
this is the "second phase of seeking the medicine."
When both correspond,
the two eights of the same kind,
captured in one moment,
refined into yang elixir—
this is the elixir mother.
Yet its transformation occurs externally,
so the elixir mother counts only as external medicine.
The practitioner uses external medicine to cultivate internal medicine,
using mother qi to subdue child qi.
Within the elixir mother,
yang lead is produced—
one then harnesses the river chariot to transport it,
reversing its course back to the original palace,
concealing it in the earthen cauldron.
With the four phases harmonized
and the three families in joyous union,
this moment of bliss attains immortality.
Though the method’s workings are thus,
knowing the white must first involve guarding the black;
guarding the black enables knowing the white;
knowing the white still requires guarding the black.
Within this lie three layers of marvelous function,
sufficient to serve as the world’s model.
If one can practice accordingly,
then natural constant virtue will know no error.
Having no error,
one can return to verify the boundless
and refine spirit to return to emptiness.

Knowing the white must involve guarding the black:
yang enters within yin.
Guarding the black enables knowing the white:
yin produces yang within.
Knowing the white still requires guarding the black:
spirit returns and qi conceals.
The principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things
are all thus.
Hence it serves as the world’s model.

"Know glory, guard disgrace,
and become the world’s valley."
Becoming the world’s valley,
constant virtue is thus fulfilled,
returning to simplicity.

When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels;
the sage employs them,
then becomes an official or leader—
thus great governance does not sever.

Following the world to become human is a glorious matter.
Reversing the course to become immortal is a disgraceful matter.
Yet one should know the glory of becoming human
and guard the disgrace of becoming immortal.
The study of constant disgrace is the study of cessation.
Emptying the heart and nurturing qi,
one becomes like the world’s empty valley.
Able to contend for the world’s empty valley,
then the constant virtue of attaining emptiness and guarding stillness
is thus fulfilled.
With constant virtue fulfilled,
one returns to verify primordial simplicity
and reverts to the root to return to the origin.
The true essence of primordial simplicity,
scattered and seen, generates the myriad things.
The flourishing abundance
can all have their materials taken and fashioned into vessels.
If the sage wishes to employ these vessels,
they become officials of yin and yang,
leaders of the multitudes,
preserving and uniting them to return to the One.
Thus great governance of the world
does not esteem division.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "Non-Action"; Peng’s version titles it "The Sacred Vessel")*

"Those who would take the world and act upon it,
I see that they will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel—
it cannot be acted upon.
Those who act upon it ruin it;
those who grasp it lose it."

All things either lead or follow,
either warm with harmony or chill with force,
either grow strong or weaken,
either rise or fall.
Therefore the sage discards excess,
discards extravagance,
discards excessiveness.

The world is like the body within.
The sacred vessel speaks of its utmost weight.
The Great Dao of prior Heaven
accomplishes through natural non-action.
Vulgar people often doubt its emptiness and stillness,
so the Old Master declares this to instruct them:
"Do people take non-action for emptiness and stillness?
If I were to take the world and govern it with action,
I would see that those who act only multiply disturbances,
only multiply contrivances,
achieving nothing without ceaseless toil."

The world’s sacred vessel is of utmost weight—
with action and many affairs,
it is not like non-action with few affairs.
Thus it cannot be acted upon.
Acting to seek completion only brings ruin—
to act is to ruin it.
Grasping to seek attainment only brings loss—
to grasp is to lose it.

The world is thus;
all things are likewise.
What dwells within the body:
some yang advances alone,
some yin arrives to follow,
some converges in warmth,
some drifts in cool breath,
some qi is full and robust,
some qi is tender and frail,
some ascends in bearing,
some descends in collapse—
all is naturally so.

Therefore the sage who practices the Dao
discards excess,
discards extravagance,
discards excessiveness.
These three are all afflictions of fondness for action,
so they are discarded.

**Chapter Thirty**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "Frugality in Warfare"; Peng’s version titles it "Military Strength")*

One who assists a ruler with the Dao
does not rely on military strength to dominate the world,
for such affairs readily rebound.
Where armies encamp,
thorns and brambles arise.
In the wake of great armies,
years of famine inevitably follow.

Thus the adept achieves results and nothing more—
daring not seize strength through force.
Having achieved results, do not boast;
having achieved results, do not brag;
having achieved results, do not grow arrogant;
having achieved results, act only out of necessity;
having achieved results, do not force it.
For when things reach their prime, they age—
this is called "not the Dao,"
and what is not the Dao ends early.

A ruler who strengthens virtue does not strengthen arms.
One who assists a ruler with the Dao—
how could they flaunt military might before the world?
Yet some deploy troops to vaunt their martial prowess,
while others withdraw their forces to cultivate civil virtue.
Worldly affairs often rebound in this way.
Wherever armies march, thorns and brambles spring up,
a sorrowful reminder of wounds and piercing harm.
After the passage of troops, famine arises,
a bitter legacy of war’s lingering poison.
How can warfare be spoken of lightly?

The ancients who excelled in arms
rooted out treachery, curbed violence,
eliminated bandits, and pacified the people.
Their banners lined the roads,
seen as welcome as sweet rain.
They achieved results solely to rescue the distressed—
not to assert strength.
Yet even in achieving results,
one must eradicate boasting, bragging, and arrogance.
Boasting breeds the impulse for war;
bragging fosters the ambition for endless conquest;
arrogance nurtures the desire to flaunt force.
Though results are achieved, no good intent remains.
If good intent guides the results,
and the people’s suffering persists,
then great armies will persist as well.
The aim lies in strenuously rescuing them from hardship—
not in displaying strength.

Should the enemy’s vigor not wane,
and fortifications stand firm in stalemate,
a strong army will inevitably age—
this too is to ravage one’s own forces.
To ravage one’s own forces
while seeking to punish those who act against the Dao
is to act against the Dao oneself.
Punishing those who act against the Dao
only to become what one seeks to destroy—
better to garrison fields, defend the borders,
and rest one’s troops.
Have those who crave strength ever observed things?
When things reach their prime, they age—
one may well imagine that strength must decline.
To use things while exhausting them
is to act contrary to the Dao.
Acting contrary to the Dao,
better to end early.

This chapter exhaustively expounds the gains and losses of deploying troops,
yet the marvel of the Dao turns on a single word: *thing*.
All action and endeavor arise from the decline of essence and the dissipation of qi,
necessitating restorative and guiding efforts—
this too is achieving results.
Whether building the foundation for a hundred days
or refining the self for three years,
it is still achieving results.
Or if the elixir foundation remains unlaid
and one’s inherent nature remains obscured,
one may rebuild and refine again—
this too is achieving results.
Yet do not boast of results as strength,
for relentless fullness invites exhaustion.
When the great medicine is near,
delay renders it useless.
Thus it is said: when things reach their prime, they age—
better to end early.

**Chapter Thirty-One**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "Laying Down Arms";
Peng’s version titles it "Fine Weapons")*

**Chapter Thirty-One**

Fine weapons are instruments of ill omen—some things abhor them, and thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in their presence. Therefore, the noble person in repose values the left, but in warfare values the right. Weapons are instruments of ill omen, not tools for the noble person. When their use is unavoidable, tranquility is paramount. To triumph yet not glorify it—those who glorify it delight in slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter cannot realize their ambitions under heaven.

Thus, auspicious affairs honor the left, while inauspicious affairs honor the right. For this reason, the deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right—positioned as in mourning rites. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with mourning rites.

The term *fine* (佳) implies auspiciousness, yet fine weapons are called inauspicious—how then can weapons be esteemed? The harm of warfare is abhorred by all things, for its schemes are endless and its disturbances manifold. How could one who embodies the Dao claim the name of a lover of war? Thus, the noble person in the world, when at peace, values the left—for the left is auspicious. In warfare, they value the right—for the right is inauspicious. This further reveals the ill omen of weapons.

Weapons are not the tools of the noble person, yet when their use is unavoidable, rescuing the distressed is paramount. Do not act with impatience or fervor; remain serene and detached. Even if victory is achieved and triumphant return secured, never regard warfare as a glorious affair. Those who do so must delight in slaughter. How could such a person be allowed to realize their ambitions in court or wage war across the land?

Observing human affairs, one cannot but sigh: auspicious affairs honor the left, inauspicious affairs honor the right. The left pertains to yang and life, the right to yin and death. Thus, in the military, there are supreme generals and deputy generals. The deputy general, without the supreme general’s command, dares not attack or kill—hence their position on the left, which holds the intent of life. The supreme general, bearing the intent of death, stands on the right. The right is the place of mourning rites, and nothing under heaven is more inauspicious. Thus, the supreme general is positioned as in mourning, cautioned against reckless killing.

Alas! A single general’s success is built upon countless bones—such a thing is cause for bitter weeping. Therefore, when the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with mourning rites. The heart of the highest sage is the heart of heaven and earth, which cherishes life.

*(This chapter’s metaphor suggests that the "female crucible" is inauspicious and should not be employed. Yet its critique of warfare’s harms is profoundly incisive.)*

---

**Chapter Thirty-Two**

The Dao is eternally nameless and uncarved. Though small, none under heaven dare subjugate it. If lords and kings can guard it, the ten thousand things will naturally submit. When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends—no command is given, yet it falls evenly of itself.

Once names are established, they too must know their limit; knowing the limit is how one avoids peril. The Dao in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas.

The great Dao is without name or form, a single mass of undifferentiated simplicity. Like the Limitless, though the uncarved block is small, it resides above the Supreme Ultimate—how could it be controlled or diminished? If lords and kings guard this simplicity, the great system remains unsevered, and the ten thousand things come as guests.

When earth rises to heaven, heaven and earth harmonize, and sweet dew descends. No effort is required to achieve balance—spirit and qi naturally attain equilibrium. When qi transforms into liquid, it is first called the "golden liquid returning elixir." Once the name "golden liquid" is established, it must be halted at the earthen crucible and nurtured. Knowing the limit avoids peril; embracing oneness and emptying the heart, peace naturally prevails.

This Dao, extended to the world, is like valleys to rivers and seas—it has its place of return.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Three**

To know others is wisdom;
to know oneself is clarity.
To overcome others is to have strength;
to overcome oneself is to be mighty.
To know contentment is wealth.
To act with perseverance is to have resolve.
To not lose one’s place is to endure.
To die yet not perish is to attain longevity.

One who understands others possesses wondrous wisdom;
one who understands their original nature attains perfect clarity—
for they have comprehended their inherent nature.
One who overcomes the desires of others has steadfast power;
one who overcomes the corpse-thief within possesses true might—
for they have comprehended their destiny.
To know contentment is to guard wealth and halt the fire to nurture the elixir.
To act with perseverance is to have resolve, like facing the wall for nine years.
To attain once is to attain forever, enduring as long as the earth.
To die in heart yet preserve the spirit is to live as long as heaven.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Four**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "The Task of Completion";
Peng’s version titles it "The Flow of Achievement")*

The great Dao flows boundlessly, extending left and right.
The ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse;
its work complete, it claims no possession.
It clothes and covers the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master—
ever without desire, it may be called "the small."
The ten thousand things return to it yet it does not act as their master—
it may be called "the great."
Thus the sage never deems himself great,
and so accomplishes his greatness.

Vast and without limit, it meets all needs wherever they arise,
allowing each to draw from it as they will.
The ten thousand things depend on the Dao for life, yet the Dao does not refuse,
merely following its timely course—
its work complete, it claims no name.
Clothing and covering without acting as master,
its virtue of nurturing and completion is all-pervading.
Rooted in non-action, none can name it as master.
Abiding in true constancy and free from desire,
its smallness cannot be broken—thus it may be called "the small."
Encompassing all returns yet not acting as master,
its greatness cannot be borne—thus it may be called "the great."
Only the sage does not display his greatness,
and this is why he is truly great.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "The Chapter of Benevolent Virtue")*

Hold to the great image, and all under heaven will come.
They come without harm, dwelling in peace and tranquility.
Music and fine food may make the passing traveler stop,
but the Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor—
seen, it cannot be perceived; heard, it cannot be listened to;
used, it cannot be exhausted.

The great image is that which has no image yet embodies all images—
thus it is called the great image, still referring to the great Dao.
One who upholds the great Dao will have all under heaven come to him.
Moving within his realm, serene and untroubled,
they suffer no harm, resting only in peace and tranquility.
Fine music and delicacies may make a passing traveler halt his carriage,
seeking a moment’s delight—
yet when the wine is finished and the songs end, they do not stay long.
The Dao is not so:
spoken, it moistens and nourishes, though it seems bland and flavorless.
Who knows that it transcends sight and sound?
Yet its use is inexhaustible.

**Chapter 36** *(He Shang Gong’s commentary titles this "Subtle Illumination")*

To gather, one must first expand;
to weaken, one must first strengthen;
to abolish, one must first exalt;
to take away, one must first give.
This is called subtle illumination.

The soft overcomes the hard,
the weak overcomes the strong.
Fish must not leave the depths;
the state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.

*"Fixed"* means *"first."*
To gather, first expand—scattered will return to unity.
To weaken, first strengthen—advance will turn to retreat.
To abolish, first exalt—glory will fade to decline.
To take, first give—departure will return again.
All things move in mutual dependence;
principles, though faint, become manifest—
hence it is called *"subtle illumination."*

The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong,
subduing without struggle.
Knowing fish must not leave the depths,
one knows the Dao does not depart from the self.
Knowing sharp instruments must not be shown,
one knows the Dao must be realized within.

---

**Chapter 37**

The Dao is eternally non-action, yet nothing is left undone.
If lords and kings can hold to it,
the myriad things will transform themselves.
When transformation stirs desire,
I will restrain it with nameless simplicity.
Nameless simplicity itself will then be free of desire.
Without desire, through stillness,
the world will right itself.

Non-action that leaves nothing undone—
this non-action is true action,
what is called *"abiding in the center to govern the outer,"
congealing spirit to form the body.*
If lords and kings can hold to it,
the myriad things will transform themselves.
Governing through reverent non-action,
one may rule all under heaven.
Is this not the legacy of the great antiquity?
Yet when peace endures and activity arises,
when feasting and splendor flourish—
this is no blessing for the state.

I will restrain them with primordial simplicity,
so they may guard simplicity and return to truth,
that those stirred by desire may cease desiring.
When desire ceases, the myriad things grow still.
Without seeking to right the world,
the world will right itself.

---

**Chapter 38**

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—
thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—
thus it has no virtue.

The highest virtue takes no action and has no purpose;
the lesser virtue acts and has purpose.
The highest benevolence acts but has no purpose;
the highest righteousness acts and has purpose.
The highest propriety acts, but if none respond,
it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
when virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
when righteousness is lost, propriety arises.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
the beginning of chaos.
Foresight is the flower of the Dao,
the beginning of folly.

Therefore, the great person dwells in the substantial,
not the superficial;
abides in the fruit, not the flower.
Thus, they discard the latter and take the former.

The person of highest virtue shows no sign of virtue,
yet possesses its full measure.
The person of lesser virtue clings to the name of virtue,
yet becomes one without virtue.

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—
it abides in non-action,
letting the myriad things transform themselves without purpose.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—
it delights in action,
stirring the hearts of the people toward purpose.

What benevolence does is love.
The world delights in it—
thus it has no purpose.
What righteousness does is awe.
The world is moved by it—
thus it has purpose.

Yet benevolence is but one benevolence,
righteousness but one righteousness.
As for propriety—
court rituals change, rural customs differ—
enforcing it is most difficult.
If one forces compliance, the people do not respond,
and instead roll up their sleeves in contention,
clinging to their own ways.
Will not the affairs of the world grow ever harder?

The great Dao does not contend,
yet it makes the people not contend—
how superior this principle!
But once lost, it becomes benevolence;
lost again, righteousness;
lost once more, propriety.

The lament that follows speaks of the turning of the times,
not that benevolence and righteousness are partial.
Propriety, rooted in loyalty and trust,
when customs thin, invites disdain and chaos—
only propriety can restore simplicity.

Foresight is the radiance of the Dao’s nature,
yet when its brilliance flames, it breeds folly—
such is the shift in foresight.
Therefore, the great person stands in the thick, not the thin;
dwells in the real, not the flowery.
Discarding and choosing rightly,
one may say simplicity still lingers among people.

**Chapter 39**

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became stable;
spirits attained the One and became numinous;
valleys attained the One and became full;
the myriad things attained the One and came to life;
lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.

This attainment was one and the same.
Without clarity, heaven would fear splitting;
without stability, earth would fear erupting;
without numinosity, spirits would fear vanishing;
without fullness, valleys would fear drying;
without life, the myriad things would fear perishing;
without the standard of honor and loftiness,
lords and kings would fear collapse.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root,
the high takes the low as its foundation.
Lords and kings call themselves *"the orphaned,"* *"the widowed,"* *"the unworthy."*
Is this not taking the humble as their root?

Therefore, the greatest chariot has no chariot—
one does not desire to gleam like jade
or clatter like stone.

*"Of old"* refers to before the Great Beginning.
*"One"* is the beginning of all numbers.
The first thing born is called *"One."*
Before the Great Beginning, all was formless;
after the Great Beginning, there was surplus.

To attain this One, one must return to the Great Beginning.
Between before and after,
there is qi but no form—
no form, yet trustworthy.

The Five Phases take water as the One.
This water is the utmost purity,
the utmost stillness—
its merit beyond conception.
To call it *"water"* seems forced;
not to call it *"water"* is empty.

Now let us trace back from those who attain the One:

The Dao’s beginning in the past—
Heaven opened from the past through the One.
Yet without this water, how could it divide?
How would its clarity be seen?

Earth unfolded from the past through the One.
Yet without this water, how could it bear?
How would its tranquility be established?

Spirits served from the past through the One.
Yet without this water, how could they be sustained?
How would their numinosity be revealed?

Valleys flowed from the past through the One.
Yet without this water, how could they contain?
How would their fullness be aided?

The myriad things arose from the past through the One.
Yet without this water, how could they be nurtured?
How would their life be sustained?

Lords and kings arose from the past to rule,
taking the One as their lord.
Yet without this water, how could they put it to use?
How would they bring steadfast peace to the world?

Heaven and Earth, spirits and valleys, the myriad things, lords and kings—
though their forms differ,
what enables their clarity, tranquility,
numinosity, fullness, life, and steadfastness
is all through the One.

Clarity without fissure—
the qi of water purifies it.
Tranquility without eruption—
the qi of water bears it.
Numinosity without cessation—
the qi of water moves it.
Fullness without exhaustion—
the qi of water fills it.
Life without extinction—
the qi of water nourishes it.
Steadfastness without constriction—
for the noble and exalted,
the virtue of water assists them,
by its nature lowly and flowing downward.

Since ancient times, rulers have humbled themselves to gain glory,
thus valuing the lowly as their root,
and the high taking the low as their foundation.
*"The orphaned,"* *"the widowed,"* *"the unworthy"*—
the self-designations of lords and kings—
are most lowly and most base.
Yet they do not realize that those who possess the Four Seas,
who are honored as the Son of Heaven,
who feast on the tribute of all directions,
attain this precisely through *"the orphaned,"* *"the widowed,"* *"the unworthy."*
Is this not taking the lowly as their root?

For lords and kings to guard their lowliness
is precisely to guard their One.
Thus, extending this principle to things:
it is like one who constructs a chariot of many parts,
turning things into mere vehicles,
recklessly driving them by their multitude—
unaware of their complete ruin.

Or like jade that gleams too brightly,
or stones that clatter too loudly—
those with the appearance of abundance—
the highest do not desire them.

Reversion is the movement of the Dao,
weakness its function.
The myriad things of the world are born from Being,
Being is born from Non-being.

Reversion: return.
Heaven and earth merge in darkness,
the first yang returns—
this is the Dao’s initial movement.
Weakness: softness.
Body and mind tranquil,
concentrating qi to attain softness—
this is the Dao’s wondrous function.
The work of returning the elixir
lies in taking the Being of Qian and entering the Non-being of Kun,
Qian planting the seed and Kun giving birth,
Non-being generating Being.
Thus the Dao is born from Being,
Being from Non-being.
All things under heaven follow this pattern.

The highest scholar hears the Dao and diligently practices it.
The middling scholar hears the Dao and treats it as if it exists, as if it does not.
The lowest scholar hears the Dao and laughs loudly at it.
Without laughter, it would not suffice as the Dao.
Thus the established sayings declare:
The luminous Dao seems dim;
advancing in the Dao seems like retreat;
the level Dao seems uneven;
supreme virtue resembles a valley;
great purity seems tarnished;
abundant virtue seems insufficient;
established virtue seems indolent;
substance and truth seem altered;
great squareness has no corners;
great vessels are late in completion;
great sound is scarce of voice;
great image has no form.
Only the Dao excels in bestowing and accomplishing.

The Dao of the highest scholar is practiced with diligence as its root.
Within it lies no self-display, no self-sharpening,
no self-differentiation, no self-substantiation,
no self-manifestation, no self-satisfaction.
Though practicing as if slack, believing as if deceived,
only then can one conceal brilliance and refine slowly,
dwell in the dust yet guard emptiness,
obscure one’s traces to seek completion,
cherish time and revere the Dao.
Otherwise, one remains with the middling scholar’s existence or nonexistence,
or the lowest scholar’s loud laughter—
how can this be called diligence?

The middling scholar hears the Dao and practices it intermittently,
hence it is said to exist and not exist.
The lowest scholar hears it and laughs loudly—
laughter is the mark of slander.
Yet even loud laughter does no harm to the Dao.
Without laughter, it would not be recognized as the supreme Dao.
The ancients in their teachings held this meaning:
Those who cultivate the Dao appear dim though luminous—
this is no self-display.
They advance as if retreating—
this is no self-sharpening.
Such is the concealment of brilliance and gradual refinement.
They appear uneven though level—
this is no self-differentiation.
Supreme virtue resembles a valley—
this is no self-substantiation.
Such is dwelling in the dust yet guarding emptiness.
Great purity seems tarnished—
this is no self-manifestation.
Abundant virtue seems insufficient—
this is no self-satisfaction.
Such is obscuring one’s traces to seek completion.
Established virtue seems indolent—
though practicing, one appears slack.
Substance and truth seem altered—
though believing, one appears deceived.
Such is cherishing time and revering the Dao.
All these are the diligent practices of the highest scholar,
beyond the reach of the middling and lowest.

Thus, while ordinary squares have corners,
great squareness has none—
it simply guards the center.
Ordinary vessels are expected to form early,
but great vessels take time—
they seek perfection.
Great sound, great image,
voiceless and formless—
are these not what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls
"fearful of not hearing, cautious of not seeing"?
Those who embrace the Dao in the world,
endlessly bestowing and bringing great transformation to completion—
these are the true highest scholars.

The Dao gives birth to the One,
the One gives birth to the Two,
the Two gives birth to the Three,
the Three gives birth to the myriad things.
The Dao stands above the Three Powers and before the Five Phases.
The Supreme One discusses creation,
thus necessarily beginning with the Dao.
The Great Dao is formless,
vast and boundless.
When stillness gives rise to movement,
the One appears.
The One is water, in the hexagrams it is Kan.
Kan resides in the north, a laborious hexagram.
All things begin and end through it.
In ending, the myriad beings return to their root;
in beginning, the first yang returns.
Yang is fire, thus when speaking of water, fire is within—
the One gives birth to the Two.
When water and fire harmonize,
yin and yang unite in prosperity,
the essence of wood stirs,
and the myriad beings flourish—
thus the Two gives birth to the Three,
the Three gives birth to the myriad things.
This speaks generally of creation,
yet the Dao of the elixir is also within it.

In my humble opinion:
The postnatal sequence is disordered and complex,
its numbers chaotic and numerous—
only when the Five are enumerated are the phases complete.
Metal generates water: four generates one.
Water generates wood: one generates three.
Wood generates fire: three generates two.
Fire generates earth: two generates five.
Earth generates metal: five generates four.
The prenatal Five Phases are ordered and simple—
when the Three are enumerated, the Five are encompassed.
Fire arises within water: the One generates the Two.
Wood flourishes through fire: the Two generates the Three.
When wood is born, it is the moment the myriad things first arise—
the Three can encompass the myriad.

Moreover, in the method of elixir refinement,
the Five Phases are all contained within the One and Two.
Water and fire are cultivated together,
the Three, Four, and Five all assist—
thus the Three need not be mentioned.
The Supreme One speaks of the Three
only to exhaustively encompass the myriad things,
hence the number Three is brought forth.
Yet even the Two need not be mentioned:
when qi becomes the elixir,
the Two, Three, Four, and Five all assist—
the Five Phases are all contained within the One.
Fire arises within water: the One contains the Two.
Wood mercury is hidden within water: the One contains the Three.
Metal lead appears within water: the One contains the Four.
True earth is held within water: the One contains the Five.
Yet even the One need not be mentioned:
the subtle and obscure,
the embryo of emptiness and nothingness—
these can be encompassed by the Dao.
Is not the art of returning the elixir
the most simple and the easiest?
Though the words are many, they return to the essential—
one finds them only more venerable, not excessive.

The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
harmonizing through the qi of the center.
As stated above, the Three gives birth to the myriad things—
the Three is the number of wood.
Things flourish through the vigor of wood,
wood flourishes through the vigor of fire,
fire is born within water—
thus the bodies of the myriad things
externally bear yin and internally embrace yang.

Externally yin and internally yang, outwardly empty and inwardly replete—this emptiness enfolds the yang qi, and this is called the *chong qi*. When the nature of things reaches this state, it unites with the Great Harmony.

Now, speaking in terms of the elixir method: when Kun (Earth) joins with Qian (Heaven/Metal), it transforms into Kan (Water). The body of Kan is outwardly empty yet inwardly replete; thus, one should embrace its qi with *chong xu* (penetrating emptiness), like the misty harmony of the Great Harmony.

What people despise—being orphaned, widowed, or unprosperous—kings and lords take as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet gain, or augmented yet lose. What others teach, I also teach: "The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural end"—I take this as the father of my teaching.

Nothing is more despised than base names, yet "orphaned," "widowed," and "unprosperous" are such names, and kings and lords use them to refer to themselves. Though their titles are diminished, in truth, they gain thereby. Thus, observing things, one sees that gain may turn to loss, and loss may yield gain—this is known through contemplating the Way of the *Yi*.

In the *Pi* hexagram, Heaven is above and Earth below; to transform this into benefit, the Way of Heaven does not dare exalt itself. Thus, it diminishes above to augment below, and the stagnation of Heaven and Earth not joining may become the benefit of the above descending to the below. Therefore, the noble person uses this to reform faults and amend errors.

In the *Tai* hexagram, Earth is above and Heaven below; to know the good of diminution, the Way of Earth does not presume to be full. Thus, it diminishes below to augment above, and the harmony of Heaven and Earth joining also follows the principle of the above acting through diminution. Therefore, the noble person uses this to curb anger and restrain desires.

Heaven and Earth gain through loss—thus, employing gain is not as effective as employing loss. Though the two hexagrams stand side by side, one should emulate the side of *Sun* (Diminution). Moreover, when *Shan Ze Sun* (Mountain and Marsh Diminishing) is inverted, it becomes *Feng Lei Yi* (Wind and Thunder Benefiting). The resonance of mountain, marsh, wind, and thunder arises precisely from diminution.

This is the teaching—the teaching of the *Yi*, the teaching of the ancients. The Most High said: "What others teach, I also teach—to teach people to know self-diminution."

The unskilled serve as the resource for the skilled—thus, the strong and overbearing are called the "teaching fathers." The strong and overbearing are those who seize and plunder, diminishing others to augment themselves, yet in the end gain nothing. *Fu* (father) here shares the same pronunciation as *fu* (beginning), read in the rising tone.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "Partial Application"; Peng’s edition titles it "Utmost Softness")*

The softest under Heaven gallops through the hardest under Heaven. The non-existent enters where there is no gap—thus do I know the benefit of non-action. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few under Heaven can attain this.

The "utmost soft" refers to *qi* and water. *Qi* reaches every unobstructed aperture; water finds every unblocked path—thus they gallop through the hardest without gap. Mountains disgorge stones; springs pierce mountains—this is visible. The "non-existent" refers to that without form or substance, only *qi* and water, which can likewise reach our bodies and enter where there is no gap.

The first two lines speak generally of *qi* and water under Heaven; this line refers specifically to the body, setting forth the analogy. It further states: "Thus do I know the benefit of non-action." Non-action means no forced movement, only natural surging. To unite the teaching without words with the benefit of non-action—truly, none under Heaven can match this.

**Chapter Forty-Four**
*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this "Establishing Admonitions"; Peng’s edition titles it "Valuing the Name")*

Which is closer—name or self?
Which is greater—self or wealth?
Which is more harmful—gain or loss?

Therefore, excessive attachment incurs great expense; hoarding leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—this is how one endures.

The self is closer than the name; the self is greater than wealth. Gaining the self brings no harm; losing the self brings harm. This principle is self-evident.

Thus, the Most High uses "which is closer," "which is greater," and "which is more harmful" to awaken people, stirring their innate conscience so they may realize for themselves—not like later generations’ didactic texts, which merely reproach and instead provoke resistance. This is the Most High’s humility and harmony.

Yet in the world, some grow close to their name while estranging their self, amass wealth while diminishing their self, value gain over the self, and feel no pain at its loss. Such deep delusion stems from prizing fame and profit while neglecting self-preservation.

How pitiful when the last breath is drawn, the final hour arrives, the name vanishes into nothingness, wealth becomes an empty fiction, and the lost one falls into ghostly realms, never to regain human form!

For one living in the world, what builds my name depletes my spirit; what enters through perversity exits likewise—this is what is meant by "excessive attachment incurs great expense; hoarding leads to heavy loss." Attachment that incurs great expense is disgrace; hoarding that leads to heavy loss is danger—neither is a path to endurance.

With a heart of compassion, the Most High speaks to awaken and teach: "Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—this is how one endures." Such is the virtue of the sage.

The Great Achievement appears deficient, yet its function never wears out.
The Utmost Fullness appears empty, yet its function is inexhaustible.
The Utmost Straightness appears bent,
the Utmost Skill appears clumsy,
the Utmost Eloquence appears inarticulate.

Restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.
Clarity and stillness are the correct governance of the world.

The Great Achievement appears deficient—like the light of the sun and moon, round yet temporarily eclipsed, advancing to regain its brightness, thus its function never wears out.
The Utmost Fullness appears empty—like the vastness of the sea, embracing all without overflow, boundless and without limit, thus its function is inexhaustible.
Those who are excessively straight are reckless;
those who rely on cunning are deceitful;
those who force eloquence are false—
none can compare to the great.

The sage and worthy use qi to attain straightness,
not flaunting hardness yet inherently hard, appearing bent;
their divine subtlety becomes skill,
not displaying wisdom yet inherently wise, appearing clumsy;
their virtue and Dao become eloquence,
not speaking much yet speaking well, appearing inarticulate.

As for refining lead and fire into harmony,
three winters can be endured;
sitting steadfast on a rush cushion,
the heat of nine summers can be forgotten—
this is precisely what is meant by "restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat."
These two principles embody the workings of yin and yang.
If one can observe the qi of dryness and dampness, cold and warmth
with a heart of clarity, emptiness, and stillness,
then the correct Way of the world is attained.

When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields. When the world loses the Dao, even mares in the wild give birth on the battlefield.

No crime is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than discontent; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, contentment in sufficiency is perpetual sufficiency.

"Following the Dao" refers to the time when the *yin* phase has reached its extreme and *yang* begins to rise after a long period of *pi* (adversity). "Losing the Dao" refers to the time when the *tai* (prosperity) phase has lasted too long and *yin* begins to emerge from the extreme of *yang*. When *pi* (adversity) is resolved and *tai* (order) is established, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields—nothing in the world remains unaccomplished. When *tai* (prosperity) flourishes and *pi* (disorder) lies dormant, warhorses are bred even in the outskirts—affairs of the world demand action. Yet from disorder, renewal begins, and *tai* (order) brings blessing.

To see what is desirable and desire it—no crime is greater. To be content yet remain discontent—no disaster is greater. To covet what one ought not—no fault is greater. Therefore, one who finds sufficiency in contentment attains perpetual sufficiency.

**Supplementary Note:**
*Que* (却) means "to remove." *Fen* (粪) means "to cultivate." When the world is at peace, though horses are unused, they still exist. To "remove" them means to send them to the mountains and marshes, akin to the idea of "returning horses to pasture." Moreover, horses are not meant for tilling fields; the phrase "to fertilize" is used as a metaphor for the withdrawal of arms and the rise of agriculture.

He who does not step beyond his door knows the world.
He who does not peer through his window sees the Dao of Heaven.
The farther he ventures, the less he knows.
Thus the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, accomplishes without acting.

*Hu* (户): a small door. By not going out yet knowing worldly affairs, seclusion clarifies worldly matters.
*You* (牖): a small window. Without peering yet seeing Heaven’s Dao, the hidden and subtle reveal the manifest.
Body, mind, nature, and life—these are where the Dao resides.
To abandon the near and pursue the distant is the way of fools.
What cannot be seen, heard, or grasped—where does one begin the search?
He who understands this truth finds the Dao between door and window.
He who does not grows ever more lost with each inquiry, more confused with each question.
Every path seems right, yet none can be fully traversed—
this is what it means to venture farther and know less.

Only the sage knows without traveling, for when the spirit is settled, wisdom arises.
He names without seeing, for holding to non-being gives rise to being.
He accomplishes without acting, for embracing the One returns to emptiness.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
In the pursuit of learning, one gains daily.
In the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.
Lose and lose again, until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
Thus he who would govern the world must always act without interference.
If he interferes, he is unfit to govern the world.

The pursuit of learning differs from the pursuit of the Dao.
Learning values accumulation, yet even in learning, one may progress from breadth to simplicity—what was gained is not without loss.
The Dao values reduction, yet even in the Dao, one may establish a foundation through worldly affairs—what was lost is not without gain.
Reduction means to strip away.
Lose and lose again, until the leaden *qi* dries and the mercury’s light appears,
until one nurtures the spirit and returns to emptiness,
acting through my non-action—
thus nothing is left undone.

To govern the world, one must first settle the world with a steadfast heart.
Act through non-action, and nothing is left undone.
Respond to movement with stillness, make virtue the constant,
cultivate governance with benevolence—
then the people will join hands and come together,
and all nations will turn their hearts toward unity.
Thus one may govern the world.
This is why one must always act without interference.
If one interferes, there will first be upheaval across the land.
Acting through action, one multiplies action,
meeting force with force, destruction with destruction, violence with violence.
To make war one’s skill and plunder one’s task
is to disturb the world and put oneself before it—
how can one govern the world thus?

Some say that those who govern the world must be men of non-action shouldering the burdens of action,
as were the recluses of Xinye, Panxi, and Nanyang in ancient times.
Yet when the affairs of the world weigh on their hearts,
their minds become disordered—
as with Fan Zeng’s grudge against Liu Bang or Xu Yuanzhi’s devotion to his mother.
This interpretation also holds.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
The sage has no fixed heart; he takes the hearts of the people as his own.
To the good, I am good; to the not-good, I am also good—thus virtue is goodness.
To the trustworthy, I am trustworthy; to the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—thus virtue is trustworthiness.

When the sage is in the world, he humbly unifies his heart with the world.
The people all turn their ears and eyes toward him, and the sage treats them all as children.

Having no fixed heart means having no partiality.
With no partiality, he can shield and embrace the people, harmonizing with their hearts.
What the people hope for is that the sage will treat them with goodness and trustworthiness.
Even the not-good and the untrustworthy receive goodness and trustworthiness—
how great is the sincerity of the sage’s virtue!

Thus when the sage is in the world, humbly unifying his heart with the world,
he shields and embraces the people.
The people all turn their ears and eyes toward him, each with their own hopes,
and the sage treats them all as children—thus he unifies them.
*Diedie* (惵惵): the appearance of sincerity.

**Chapter Fifty**
From birth one enters death.
Those who follow life are thirteen in number.
Those who follow death are thirteen in number.
Those who live yet move toward the realm of death are also thirteen in number.
Why is this so?
Because they overindulge in the pursuit of life.

Here is the translation:

---

It is said that those who skillfully nurture life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without being harmed by weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this so? Because they dwell not in the realm of death.

All things emerge into life and enter death, all falling within the thirteen. As for these thirteen, past commentaries have not grasped their true meaning, which I now clarify. The number ten represents the generative numbers of Heaven and Earth. One Heaven, one Earth; one *qian*, one *kun*. The *qian* hexagram has three yang lines, the *kun* hexagram three yin lines. All things meet the three yang and are born, meet the three yin and die. Only humans, in receiving life, share the three yang with other beings, yet their entry into the three yin is self-accelerated. The seven emotions and six desires greatly harm the original spirit, hence it is said they "move toward the realm of death." Yet even this self-acceleration returns to the three yin alone.

Why do beings and humans have three births and three deaths? When the pursuit of life is excessive, the dead are extinguished, and the living are replenished. The dead are at rest, the living in motion—this is the cyclical, interdependent pattern. Otherwise, if there were life without death, the teeming multitudes would fill the world; how could there be a place of repose?

Though the death of all things lies in winter and their birth in spring, their life and death are but the alternation of movement and stillness. For humans, however, death does not return to life. This is not because creation singles out humanity for harsh treatment, but because they do not know how to nurture life, thus continually entering the realm of death.

The Supreme Lord possesses the virtue of cherishing life, and the sage possesses the method of nurturing life. If one seeks wisely, one should transform the path of "yang birth and yin death" into the work of "yang departing and yin arriving," thereby attaining long life and enduring vision, no longer sharing the fate of those who, though newly born, move toward the realm of death.

Things are born through three and die through three. The Way of nurturing life thus takes the three yang of the *qian* hexagram and plants one yang within the three yin, so that *kun* becomes substantial and forms *kan*. The three yin of the *kun* hexagram sprout one yin within the three yang, so that *qian* becomes hollow and forms *li*. *Kan* and *li* are the medicinal substances. Entering seclusion and cultivating stillness, one observes the return of one’s solitary yang, then gathers and returns it, gathers and subjugates it. Thus nurturing life is the Way of the Returned Elixir, the work of returning to the root, the art of extending life, the secret of becoming an immortal.

To reverse and return is nurturing; to move from below to above is nurturing; to turn from outer to inner is nurturing; only with the Yellow Dame within can one nurture. Nurturing is not easily spoken of. Mother and child cherish each other, and nurturing runs deep; the infant and maiden unite, and joy is great; lead and mercury conjoin, and the sacred embryo forms; through non-doing, one verifies and the yang spirit emerges. Though tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons may assail, they have no power to bring calamity. How then could one share the three yang for birth and three yin for death with ordinary people and things?

**Chapter Fifty-One**
The Dao gives them life, virtue nourishes them, things shape them, and conditions complete them. Therefore, all things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise not by command but always naturally.

Thus the Dao gives them life, virtue nourishes, rears, raises, completes, ripens, tends, and shelters them. It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.

The Dao sows things, virtue protects them; thus things are born by the Dao and nourished by virtue. Things manifest form, and through conditions they are completed. All things revere the Dao and honor virtue because the Dao is nameless while virtue has a name. The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise without command, for the principles of things naturally converge.

Only the Dao presides over their birth, only virtue presides over their nourishment. It rears and raises, completes and ripens, tends and shelters. Preserving and protecting the spirit are all the arts of virtue. Not possessing, not relying, nor dominating, accomplishing through non-doing—this is true understanding. Profound virtue is the highest virtue.

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
The world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of the world. Having attained the mother, one knows her children. Having known the children, one again guards the mother, and to the end of life one does not perish.

Block the openings, shut the gates, and to the end of life one will not toil. Open the openings, aid one’s affairs, and to the end of life one will not be saved. Seeing the small is called clarity, guarding the soft is called strength. Use its light, return to its clarity, and one will leave no calamity for the self. This is called inheriting the constant.

The Way of the world has an end and thus a beginning, yet its beginning is not singular. The Golden Elixir has a place from which it first emerges, a practice with which it first proceeds, and a substance to which it first returns.

What is the place of first emergence? The *kun* furnace and the yin furnace are one. Yin conceals yang, hence it is called the yin-yang furnace. The moon appears in the *dui* direction, hence it is called the inverted moon furnace. *Dui* is the youngest maiden, hence it is called the primordial wondrous tripod. The *Awakening to Reality* calls it the "source of medicinal production"—all are places of beginning.

What is the practice of first proceeding? To reach the utmost emptiness, to guard perfect stillness, I observe their return. Turbidity settles and slowly clears; tranquility endures, and slowly life emerges—all are the first practices.

What is the substance of first return? The undifferentiated and complete, the profound and obscure—within it there is sincerity, within it there is essence. The uncarved block without name, the formless gold—all are the first substances. The Returned Elixir takes this gold as its beginning, hence it is said to have a beginning. Yet this gold is not a native substance of the *kun* household; it is the fiery essence of the *qian* household.

The elixir method takes cinnabar as its primary agent. Entering the *kun* furnace, it forms *kan*, harmonizing with the mercury of the Jade Pond to become *wu* earth—*wu* earth is the yang elixir.

The yang elixir is the external elixir, and the external elixir is the root of the elixir. The Golden Flower is it, the True Seed is it, the Yellow Sprout is it, the White Snow is it. Taking the external elixir as the mother of the internal elixir, thus it is said to have a beginning as the Mother of All Under Heaven. The mother has a sacred name, called Yang Lead. Where there is Yang Lead as mother, there is Yin Mercury as child. Yin Mercury is the postnatal qi of the child, while Yang Lead is the prenatal qi of the mother. When the external Yang Lead subdues the internal Yin Mercury, mother and child meet—hence it is said, "Know the child."

Yet this coming of Yang Lead requires the wondrous application of fire. For Lead is born in the *kan* palace, sunken and unmoving. To capture and restrain the true Mercury of the *li* palace, one must employ fierce fire for intense refinement, whereupon it soars upward. After meeting with true Mercury, one should then guard the city and bathe, refraining from applying fierce fire. At first, the mother comes longing for the child; later, the child lingers longing for the mother—thus it is said, "Having known the child, return to guard the mother." When mother and child long for one another without end, the Great Elixir is accomplished.

The Great Elixir is called the internal medicine; the Sacred Embryo is this, the Infant is this, the True Person is this. In nurturing the internal elixir, one must possess the natural true fire, continuously simmering within the earthen crucible, and also employ the external furnace’s yin-yang talismanic fire, diligently adjusting its intensity. Through the operations of withdrawal and addition, form is transformed into qi, and qi into spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth. Thus one must block the *dui*, close the gate, and devote oneself to this practice for life.

There are two kinds of nurturing: the internal civil fire and the external talismanic fire. Preserving it for ten months, one abandons effortful action to realize effortless action—hence one dare not busy oneself with external affairs, disturbing the inner stillness of the chamber. As the *Cantong Qi* states: "Securely seal their juncture, striving to make it complete and firm. Observe and attend with utmost care, carefully regulating warmth and coolness. Circulate through the twelve nodes, and when each node is exhausted, renew your closeness." This is the work of nurturing.

The inner realm does not leak outward, the outer realm does not intrude inward—blocking the *dui* and closing the gate is the essential technique. If one does not block the *dui*, one will daily engage with external affairs. Daoists often discuss worldly matters, wishing to aid external endeavors, yet first harming their inner cultivation. When the mouth opens, spirit and qi scatter; when the mind is disordered, the fire’s work grows cold. The great path of longevity, I fear, will not be achieved—hence it is said, "If you assist in such affairs, you will never recover for life."

The "small" refers to the golden light of the elixir, its form like a grain of millet—thus it is called "small." To see this small is called "bright." The "yielding" refers to the body’s royal water, whose qi is fundamentally harmonious—thus it is called "yielding." To guard this yielding is called "strong." The "light" is spirit, the very golden light. The "bright" is qi, the very golden essence. When golden light envelops golden essence, light and brightness are concealed within, spirit and qi interdependent. The work of embryo nurturing is accomplished, and the body escapes calamity—thus it is said, "Use its light, return to its brightness, leaving no misfortune for the body." This is the Way of inheriting the constant, the cultivation of long life and enduring vision.

To "inherit the constant" is to guard one’s true constancy. My mountain appraisal: This chapter is clarified sentence by sentence, each word extracted with precision—the Way of the Returned Elixir is fully revealed here. I have often said that the scriptures of the Most High are concise yet comprehensive, even true immortals cannot fully comprehend them—how exceptionally clear is this commentary! How joyous! How delightful!

Chapter Fifty-Three
*(He Shang Gong’s commentary titles this the "Chapter of Increasing Evidence"; Peng’s version calls it the "Chapter of Unwavering Resolve")*

Were I to possess unwavering knowledge,
I would walk the great Dao,
fearing only deviation.
The great Dao is utterly smooth,
yet the people prefer byways.

Courts are swept clean,
fields lie fallow,
granaries stand empty.
They don fine brocades,
gird themselves with sharp swords,
surfeit on food and drink,
hoard wealth in excess—
this is called the "thieving pole."
How far from the Dao!

*I*: refers to my lineage, not the Old Sage’s self-reference.
*Unwavering (介然)*: steadfast resolve.
My lineage’s nature is perfectly luminous;
were I to stabilize myself with unwavering resolve,
I would possess both steadfastness and complete awakening.
To personally walk the great Dao,
fearing only deviation—
for deviation follows outward dispersion,
greatly depleting my true essence,
and thus is to be feared.

Accumulating essence and amassing qi
can refine one into truth—
this is the great Dao’s level path,
the shared road all should follow.
Yet the people’s hearts prefer byways,
competing to enter crooked paths.
Delusion invites misfortune;
essence withers, spirit scatters.

Like a court’s former halls,
once purged and stripped,
the primordial yang is utterly lost.
Like fields’ boundaries,
all fallen to waste,
the gates and orifices are wholly blocked.
Like granaries’ stores,
all reduced to emptiness,
the essence and qi are entirely gone.

They merely don fine brocades,
gird themselves with sharp swords,
chase after feasts and revelry,
vainly imagining their wealth sufficient.
Such ones fix their hearts on pilfering the Dao’s name,
like thieves who use poles to hook objects over walls—
this is called the "thieving pole" and nothing more.
How far from the Dao!
How far from the Dao!

**Chapter Fifty-Four**
*(He Shang Gong’s commentary titles this "The Chapter on Cultivating Observation"; Peng’s edition titles it "The Chapter on Skillful Establishment")*

What is skillfully established cannot be uprooted;
what is skillfully embraced cannot slip away.
Thus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate it in the self—its virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family—its virtue becomes abundant.
Cultivate it in the village—its virtue becomes enduring.
Cultivate it in the state—its virtue becomes bountiful.
Cultivate it in the world—its virtue becomes universal.

Therefore:
Observe the self through the self;
observe the family through the family;
observe the village through the village;
observe the state through the state;
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Establishing the center and standing firm—thus it cannot be uprooted.
Embracing the One without separation—thus it cannot slip away.
Children beget grandchildren, manifesting through division—thus sacrifices never cease.

Self, family, village, state, and world—these are the realms where virtue is cultivated.
*With* (由): through.
*Observe* (观): to demonstrate the method.
Through the self, demonstrate the Dharma-body;
extend this to demonstrate the Dharma-body in family, state, and world—
all are this true body.
When virtue is complete in the self, the demonstration is inexhaustible,
thus by this I universally know the world.

**Chapter Fifty-Five**
*(He Shang Gong’s commentary titles this "The Chapter on the Mysterious Token"; Peng’s edition titles it "The Chapter on Embracing Virtue")*

One who embraces profound virtue
is like an infant:
poisonous creatures do not sting,
fierce beasts do not seize,
grasping birds of prey do not strike.
Bones weak, sinews soft, yet the grip is firm.
Unknowing of the union of female and male, yet the organ stirs—
such is the perfection of essence.
All day crying, yet the throat does not grow hoarse—
such is the perfection of harmony.

To know harmony is called constancy;
to know constancy is called clarity.
To augment life is called auspicious.
The heart directing qi is called force.

When things reach their prime, they age—
this is called "not the Dao."
What is not the Dao soon perishes.

*Embrace* (含): to hold within.
Those who hold virtue profoundly are true persons.
The heart of the true person never loses the heart of an infant,
thus they are like an infant, utterly forgetful of externals.
Therefore, noxious creatures, beasts, or birds harm them.
Bones weak, sinews soft—this is the body of a child,
thus the grip is firm.
People know the joy of male-female union,
yet such knowledge leads to the stirring of the organ and the loss of life.
The infant, without knowledge, embodies the perfection of pure essence—
this is the absence of desire.
*Organ* (朘): the infant’s yin; also, contraction.
Vulgarly, *retraction* is called *朘缩*—contraction without arousal.
People, through anger, disrupt their harmony, and their voices grow hoarse.
The infant, however, may cry and wail yet never grow hoarse.
*Cry* (号) is calling; *wail* (嗌) is sobbing.
All day calling and sobbing without hoarseness—
such is the perfection of harmony.
One who knows harmony abides in constancy without peril.
I who know constancy attain true clarity.
What benefits human life is the infant’s auspicious harmony.
Yet if one possesses knowledge and awareness,
using the heart to direct qi,
they turn from softness to force.
Those who love force in the world—
have they ever observed this in things?
The explanation of the final three lines appears in Chapter Thirty.

(This chapter is titled *The Chapter of Mysterious Virtue* in the Heshang Gong commentary and *The Chapter of Mysterious Sameness* in Peng’s version.)

Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.
Block the apertures, shut the gates,
blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,
soften the light, merge with the dust—
this is called *mysterious sameness*.

It cannot be approached with intimacy,
nor distanced with estrangement;
it cannot be gained through profit,
nor harmed by injury;
it cannot be exalted as noble,
nor debased as lowly.
Thus it is most precious under heaven.

Those who *know* are those who have attained through practice. *Not speaking* is because speech is difficult. For their understanding runs deep, and though the heart wishes to speak, the mouth cannot keep pace. If one merely exalts speech, claiming some immortal’s scripture or true transmission has exhausted all that needs to be said—no teacher’s guidance required, the Dao can be practiced—how can they know that while the truth is indeed true, its subtle details, its layered metaphors, its profound mechanisms may yet elude them? Moreover, ascending to truth and entering the Dao ultimately depend on the *returned elixir*. Only when the principle of the returned elixir is clear can one attain the Dao.

Now, let me ask you:
*Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Dui*—what trigrams are these?
Dragon and tiger, mercury and lead—what alchemical substances are these?
Guest and host, female and male—how are they distinguished in function?
The indistinct and the obscure—how are they embodied?
The floating and the sinking, the inverted and the upright—how are they arranged?
Without clarity on the *mysterious female*, one cannot engage in transformation.
Without summoning the *Yellow Dame*, how can union be achieved?
Beyond this, words are hard to convey,
authority hard to establish,
the primary scripture hard to find,
the firing times hard to grasp.

Furthermore, as the ancients said: *The great matter of the golden elixir must be pursued with the help of one who has power.* Where in which book is the wondrous use of such a powerful one recorded? Moreover, the practice and discipline of the work include elements that cannot be conveyed by books alone: cutting off sensual desire,轻财利, relinquishing affection, guarding virtue—these are all matters of personal cultivation, not things that can be resolved through texts.

Only when a sincere heart seeks the Dao,
moving heaven above,
dissolving worldly thoughts,
and receiving the silent aid of the numinous,
can one come to know the Dao.
To seek a steed by following a picture—how can this suffice to grasp its subtleties?
Thus, *those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know*—because there are things that are difficult to speak of.

Some may ask: *"If knowing is indeed difficult to speak of, how can those who are yet unenlightened come to hear of it? Must there not be those who can speak to guide their knowing?"* The alchemical classics say: *Only with a teacher’s oral instructions can one attain the Dao.* This seems to imply that those who know must speak, and those who speak must know. Let me explain further.

*Oral instructions* are intimate words, subtle words—layer upon layer of breakthroughs, not mere isolated phrases or a few sentences. When the Yellow Emperor sought out Guangchengzi, they spoke in detail for three days. When my teacher met Ancestor Zhong, they sat in discussion for ten days. Even for those of heavenly sincerity and the highest spiritual capacity, a few words cannot suffice—how much less for those below?

Today, people mistake *oral instructions* for shortcuts; this is wrong. When oral instructions are incomplete, the teacher departs and returns. During discussion, one listens closely and commits to memory, so as to connect with ancient texts and illuminate the stages. This is the wonder of oral instructions. When one has read many alchemical classics, a single hearing of oral instructions can bring sudden awakening. The classics verify the instructions, and the instructions verify the classics—true and unfailing, in accord with the great Dao. This is why a true teacher must be sought, and why mere cleverness cannot be relied upon.

Moreover, the root of a true teacher lies in one who has cultivated virtue and refined it into attainment. How could they not know the profound and secret words that heaven bestows upon the good and withholds from the unworthy? If one knows yet speaks lightly of them, why did Master Ziyang receive three divine reprimands? Their silence is not unwillingness to speak, but a reluctance to speak lightly.

Even when great vessels meet and the transmission is urgent, the teacher must repeatedly test and refine the disciple. Only after the disciple’s diligence and the teacher’s toil do they swear an oath, light incense, and pass on the bowl of transmission. From this day forward, the lineage extends into the future—take care not to hear and fail to practice, nor to receive and hoard in secret. Given all this, is speaking not difficult?

In my commentary on the *Daodejing*, though more detailed than those of earlier scholars, each chapter’s annotations follow the text and leave its words intact, unable to fully articulate the wondrous mechanisms of the alchemical Dao in complete passages. Heroes and aspirants, if you can find a wise teacher to point them out, attaining the method will be all the easier.

*Blocking the apertures and shutting the gates* nurtures spirit and qi.
*Blunting sharpness* without being blunted by sharpness—this is the ability to guard weakness.
*Untangling knots* without being entangled by them—this is the ability to remain serene.
*Softening the light* to conceal its brilliance,
*merging with the dust* to transcend it—
Mencius said: *The sage’s relation to the people is also like this.*
This is the essence of *mysterious sameness*.

Thus, it cannot be approached with intimacy, nor distanced with estrangement. If it could be approached with intimacy, it could also be distanced with estrangement. The same applies to profit and harm, nobility and lowliness. Therefore, it is the most precious under heaven—nothing surpasses the sage’s virtue.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven**
(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Pure Wind*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Governing with Rectitude*)

Govern the state with rectitude,
deploy troops with奇,
win the world through non-interference.
How do I know this is so?
By this.

The world abounds with taboos, and the people grow ever poorer. The people possess many sharp tools, and the state sinks deeper into chaos. The people cultivate many clever skills, and strange artifacts proliferate. Laws and decrees multiply, and thieves and bandits abound. Thus the sage declares: *I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.*

Rectitude is not mere idle governance—it truly embodies the teaching of reverence, moving people to respond with sincerity. The extraordinary is not mere deceit—it truly embodies the teaching of quiet mastery, making one’s intentions inscrutable. Thus one must govern the state with rectitude and deploy troops with the extraordinary. To win the world through non-interference is to achieve success through non-action. By this, I mean: the Way of cultivating the self reveals the Way of governing the world.

When the court teems with taboos, corrupt and base ministers advance, impoverishing the people. When the people possess many sharp tools, scheming and deceitful men arise, plunging the state into deeper chaos. When clever skills please the ruler, strange and extravagant objects multiply. When laws and decrees disdain the people, thieves and bandits flourish. These are all perversions of good governance.

Thus the sage’s words are recalled to observe the constancy of the Way of governance—it lies solely in the distinction between having desires and having none.

**Chapter Fifty-Eight**
*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Harmonious Transformation*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Governance*)*

When governance is muted and unobtrusive, the people are simple and sincere.
When governance is sharp and exacting, the people are restless and lacking.
Misfortune—fortune leans upon it;
Fortune—misfortune lurks within it.
Who knows their ultimate end? Is there no constancy?
Rectitude reverts to the extraordinary,
Goodness reverts to the ominous.
The people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.

Therefore the sage is square but does not cut,
sharp but does not wound,
straight but does not stretch,
luminous but does not dazzle.

*Muted and unobtrusive (閟閟)*: a manner of honest simplicity.
*Simple and sincere (醇醇)*: a state of tranquil composure.
When governance fosters simplicity, the people rest in stillness.
*Sharp and exacting (察察)*: harsh and demanding.
*Restless and lacking (缺缺)*: negligent and careless.
When governance is harsh and demanding, the people grow negligent.

The beginnings of fortune and misfortune’s mutual dependence—people should know their ultimate end and uphold constancy. The phrase *"who knows"* implies a lament that people do not understand. If one does not know the ultimate end, how can there be any who uphold constancy?

Rectitude, the straight path, reverts to the extraordinary and perverse—all because there is no constancy. Goodness, originally auspicious, reverts to the ominous and baleful—also because there is no constancy. If this is so, how could the people’s descent into delusion be the fault of a single morning or evening?

*Cut*: to sever.
*Wound*: to injure.
*Stretch*: to act without restraint.
*Dazzle*: to display ostentation.
These four are the delusions of the people.

Only the sage is vast and uncornered, requiring no severing;
pure and self-contained, avoiding injury;
straight yet restrained, never overreaching;
radiant yet not dazzling—thus walking the true path of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine**
*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Guarding the Dao*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Roots and Foundations*)*

Governing people and serving Heaven—nothing compares to frugality; this is called "early compliance." "Early compliance" means accumulating virtue in abundance. Accumulating virtue in abundance leads to invincibility; being invincible means none can fathom its limits. When none can fathom its limits, one may possess the state. Possessing the state’s foundational power, one may endure long. This is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, the Way of long life and enduring vision.

*Frugality*: thrift.
*Early compliance*: referring to enriching the state and pacifying the people.
*Accumulating virtue*: referring to the people’s peace and the state’s prosperity.
*Invincibility*: triumph.
To say it plainly: governing with reverence for thrift enables the enrichment of the state and pacification of the people, ensuring their peace and the state’s prosperity, and rendering all battles victorious. Being ever-victorious, none can discern its bounds. Gradually, with profound benevolence and deep kindness, one may surely attain the state. The *state* here refers to the nation’s foundation. Once the foundation is established, one casts true cinnabar into the jade pool, first refining the lead-mother. When the lead-mother captures the mercury-child, the state may be enjoyed long. This is the cultivation of deep roots and firm stems, the Way of long life and enduring vision.

*Roots and stems*: returning to the root to subdue one’s qi, nurturing the stem to preserve one’s spirit.

**Chapter Sixty**
*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Occupying the Throne*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Refining the Delicate*)*

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.

With the Dao presiding over the world, its ghosts lose their numinosity.
Not that its ghosts lose their numinosity—
their numinosity does no harm to people.
Not that their numinosity does no harm to people—
the sage also does no harm to people.
When the two do not harm one another,
their virtues converge and return.

Cooking differs from cutting: cutting values separation, while cooking values harmony.
*Small fish*: small things.
Viewing a great state as a small thing lies solely in harmonizing the people’s sentiments.

*Ghosts*: demons.
*Numinosity*: spirits.
*Does no harm*: does not disturb.
This means that with the Dao as the foundation of governance, though demons possess spirit, they do not disturb.
It is not that they do not disturb people—
the sage governs with stillness and does not disturb people,
so how dare demons disturb them?
Thus, demons and people forget one another,
and the sage’s virtue subdues all.

*Converge and return*: all submit.

**Chapter Sixty-One**
*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Humble Virtue*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Lower Currents*)*

A great state is the lower current,
the confluence of the world,
the female of the world.
The female always overcomes the male with stillness,
using stillness as her lower position.

Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state,
it wins over the small state.
When a small state humbles itself before a great state,
it wins over the great state.
Therefore, some win by humbling themselves,
while others win by being humble.

A great state, being too great, desires to shelter others.
A small state, being too small, desires to serve others.
When both attain what they desire,
the greater should remain humble.

This chapter instructs the lords of the world to cultivate humility in order to embrace smaller states.
*Lower current*: where all waters converge, likened to a great state uniting lesser ones.
Thus, a great state is the lower current—not that it dwells in a lowly position.
It unites tributary states, hence called the confluence of the world.
It should employ gentle virtue, thus compared to the female of the world.

*Female*: the Way of softness.
*Male*: the Way of hardness.
Though small states may be hard, a great state overcomes them with soft stillness,
so stillness is the virtue of humility.

When a great state humbles itself before a small state,
the small state delights in serving as its vassal,
and each year may offer tribute.
When a small state humbles itself before a great state,
the great state often rewards it,
and each year may bestow gifts.
Thus, some win by humbling themselves,
while others win by being humble.
Great and small naturally rely on one another.

A great state, in its excess, resembles the *Great Exceeding* hexagram:
an old man obtaining a young woman—
excessive yet harmonious—
thus possessing the virtue of sheltering others,
meaning it seeks to preserve small states.
A small state, in its modest success, resembles the *Small Exceeding* hexagram:
moving with the times—
excessive yet properly aligned—
thus possessing the Way of serving others,
meaning it seeks to depend on great states.
When great and small each attain their desires,
it is because the greater humbles itself before the lesser.
Otherwise, though the ruler of a small state may wish to serve a great state,
if the great state oppresses it,
the small state will not willingly submit.

The grand purport of this teaching is to instruct the lords of great states in the principle of gentle reciprocity with distant lands,
yet its subtle implications for self-cultivation are equally profound.

Let us now expound it:

The *great state* is Kunlun.
The *lower current* is the primordial sea.
The fluids of Kunlun descend into the primordial sea,
meaning the primordial sea connects with Kunlun—
thus, a great state is the lower current,
not that Kunlun dwells in a lowly position.

The *lower current* is the confluence of the world.
*Confluence*: attachment.
All submission and dependence reside here—
this is the Yellow Court.

The virtue of the lower current is the female of the world.
*Female*: softness.
Concentrating qi to achieve softness lies here,
hence it is called the female gate.

Within the female gate’s cavity resides primordial essence.
By quietly gathering kidney qi within it,
the kidneys are first regarded as the female gate,
and the heart as the male.
Yet now, the self is considered female,
and the other male—
this reverses hardness and softness,
not female and male.

The heart’s fire is by nature hard and restless;
water’s stillness can restrain fire’s movement—
this is the coming of lead,
which can restrain mercury’s flight.

*Using stillness as her lower position*:
employing silence and softness,
cultivating humility to stabilize the heart-mind.

Thus, Kunlun’s sweet fluids flow into the primordial sea.
The fluids transform into qi,
entering the cinnabar field.
A great state humbling itself before a small state
is like descending from Kunlun to the cinnabar field.
*Winning over the small state*:
gathering the cinnabar field’s metal-water,
reversing its flow to the celestial valley.
A small state humbling itself before a great state
is like ascending from the cinnabar field to Kunlun.
*Winning over the great state*:
merging Kunlun’s golden fluids,
both descending into the Yellow Court.

Thus, when Kunlun’s fluids flow down to the cinnabar field to generate qi,
gathering the cinnabar field’s qi is *winning by humbling oneself*.
Or when the cinnabar field’s qi ascends to Kunlun to generate fluids,
swallowing Kunlun’s fluids is *winning by being humble*.

The *great state’s excess* is modeled on the Dao of the *Yi*.
The *Marsh Wind* hexagram is favorable for advancement,
its image likening marsh water submerging wood—
when marsh waters rise high,
all trees are submerged,
this is the image of *Great Exceeding*.
When Kunlun’s sweet dew descends,
it originally advances with success,
aligning perfectly with *Great Exceeding*—
spirit transforms into qi,
and qi transforms into essence,
which fills the cinnabar field.
Thus, it possesses the virtue of sheltering others.

The *small state’s modest success* is also modeled on the Dao of the *Yi*.
The *Thunder Mountain* hexagram is favorable for maintaining integrity,
its image likening a bird’s lingering call—
just as a flying bird should descend,
so its call may be heard,
this is the image of *Small Exceeding*.
When the lower cinnabar field’s true fluids are contained within,
originally maintaining integrity is auspicious,
aligning perfectly with *Small Exceeding*—
essence generates qi,
and qi generates spirit,
which ascends to depend on the Yellow Court.
Thus, it possesses the Way of serving others.

One ascends and one descends, mutually supporting and preserving,
inverting Heaven and Earth,
reversing the flow of the Yellow River.
The wondrous secret of cultivating the body lies in nothing beyond this.

**Supplementary Annotation:**
Thus, some say: "When the Yellow Court resides below to gather the fluids of Kunlun, it is *taking by descending*."
Others say: "When the Yellow Court illuminates below to absorb the qi of the cinnabar field, it is *taking by descending*."
This meaning may also be considered.

**Wu Shan’s Commentary:**
The Yellow Court is the palace for nurturing the heart,
while the *mysterious gate* is the source for nurturing the kidneys.
Now, what nurtures the heart is called the *mysterious gate*—
for in preserving spirit and guarding essence, the Dao values stillness.
In congealing spirit and gathering qi, the Dao values softness.
In the empty spirit receiving qi, the Dao values humility.
In guarding spirit and awaiting qi, the Dao values weakness.
In spirit uniting with qi, the Dao values lowliness.
In harmonizing spirit and qi, the Dao values harmony.
The *mysterious gate* possesses the six virtues of stillness, softness, humility, weakness, lowliness, and harmony.
Thus, it borrows the name of the *mysterious gate* to provisionally replace the name of the Yellow Court—
this is not to move the gate’s location into the Yellow Court.
Those who practice the elixir often invert the trigrams and lines of the hexagrams, frequently borrowing names from one another.
When Hanxu speaks plainly, and Master Huidao further elucidates,
each phrase is a true secret,
sweeping away a thousand analogies.
Those who attain it should treasure it; do not show it to the unworthy.

---

**Chapter Sixty-Two**
*(He Shanggong’s edition titles this "The Dao Chapter"; Peng’s edition titles it "The Mystery of the Dao")*

The Dao is the mystery of the ten thousand things.
It is the treasure of the good,
and the refuge of the unworthy.
Fair words can be traded in the marketplace,
and noble conduct can elevate a person.
If people are unworthy, how can they be abandoned?
Thus, when the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed,
though one may offer a jade disk preceded by a team of four horses,
it is not as valuable as sitting and advancing in this Dao.

Why was this Dao prized in ancient times?
Was it not said: "Seek and you shall obtain; with it, even the guilty may be absolved"?
Thus, it is the most precious under heaven.

"The mystery of the ten thousand things" means the source of creation.
The good treasure it to refine the elixir and become a sage.
Even the unworthy preserve it to replenish qi and prolong life.
This is the utmost impartiality of the Dao.

Fine words about this Dao can make followers gather like a marketplace.
Exalted practice of this Dao can elevate a person.
The Dao does not fail anyone.
Those who abandon the Dao and run astray are unworthy themselves—
the Dao has never abandoned anyone.
Thus, when comparing the noble ones like the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes,
or the precious objects like jade disks and teams of four horses,
with the Dao,
none is as valuable as sitting and advancing in this Dao.

*Sitting* means *guarding*. As in the *Zuozhuan*: "The people of Chu *guarded* their northern gate."
It also means *kneeling*. As in the *Classic of Rites*: "When *kneeling*, one shifts position."

Why was this Dao prized in ancient times?
Because by seeking it, one obtains it,
and by obtaining it, one is absolved of guilt.
Thus, nothing under heaven is as precious as this.
*"Was it not said"* is an archaic phrase meaning *"Did the ancients not say?"*

**Chapter Sixty-Three**
*(He Shanggong’s edition titles this "Beginning with Grace"; Peng’s edition titles it "The Great Chapter")*

Act without acting,
attend to affairs without affairs,
taste without tasting.
Regard the great as small, the many as few,
and repay resentment with virtue.
Address difficulties while they are easy,
achieve greatness while it is small.
The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy.
The great affairs of the world must arise from the small.
Thus, the sage never acts as great,
and therefore accomplishes greatness.

One who makes promises lightly will surely lack trust;
one who treats things lightly will surely encounter many difficulties.
Thus, the sage treats even the difficult as difficult,
and therefore ultimately encounters no difficulty.

*Acting without acting*, *attending to affairs without affairs*, *tasting without tasting*—
all refer to tranquility and simplicity.
*Regarding the great as small, the many as few*—
this is impartiality in dealing with things.
*Repaying resentment with virtue*—
responding with uprightness is itself repaying with virtue,
not adding extra generosity.

*Addressing difficulties while they are easy*—
when others treat things lightly, I alone treat them as difficult;
this is not putting the difficult before the easy.
*Achieving greatness while it is small*—
disdaining small conduct will ultimately harm great virtue.
This aligns with the *Book of Documents*.
Thus, it is also said: "The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy.
The great affairs of the world must arise from the small."
This is clearly understood.

*Arising from the easy* begins with caution against treating things lightly.
*Arising from the small* begins with valuing small conduct.
The sage never acts as great,
and therefore accomplishes greatness—
further clarifying that the above must *arise from the small*.

To emphasize that it must *arise from the easy*,
another argument is presented:
For example, one who makes promises lightly will surely become untrustworthy.
Thus, one who speaks lightly will surely end as one whose actions are difficult to accomplish.
Therefore, the sage treats even the undifficult as difficult,
and thus ultimately encounters no difficulty.

**Chapter Sixty-Four**

What is secure is easy to maintain;
what has no sign is easy to plan for.
What is fragile is easy to break;
what is minute is easy to scatter.
Act before things arise,
govern before disorder begins.
A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout.
A nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth.
A journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step.
One who acts will fail;
one who grasps will lose.
The sage acts not, and thus does not fail.
He does not grasp, and thus does not lose.

In their undertakings, people often fail when near completion.
If one is as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
there will be no failure.

Thus, the sage desires what others do not desire,
and does not value rare goods.
He learns what others do not learn,
restoring what the multitude has passed over,
to assist the self-so of the ten thousand things without daring to act.

For those cultivating the great Dao:
What is secure is easy to maintain—otherwise, when trouble arises, it is difficult to hold.
What has no sign is easy to plan for—otherwise, when things have gone astray, it is difficult to plan.
The fragile is easy to break; the minute is easy to scatter—
this speaks of the difficulty of preserving the tender and the challenge of seizing the small.

At the stage of non-being, action ensures what is secure may be maintained, and what has no sign may be planned for. Governing before disorder arises ensures the fragile does not break and the minute does not scatter. How can one not be cautious in their method?

Moreover, progress in skill must be gradual, lest there be cause for retreat. It is like a living tree, growing from small to great; like building a terrace, rising from low to high; like traveling a road, advancing from near to far. These are clear proofs.

Those who act desire success but bring about failure. Those who grasp desire gain but incur loss. The sage, however, practices non-action. Yet even in non-action and non-grasping, one must remain unwavering from beginning to end to achieve completion.

I have often observed foolish people undertaking tasks, many failing when near success. How can one not be as cautious at the end as at the beginning?

Only the sage desires what others do not desire—desiring, he cherishes the Dao; not desiring, he scorns goods and values virtue. And he learns what others do not learn—learning, he possesses method; not learning, he remains serene in non-action. This is how he reverses the excesses of the multitude, assisting the self-so principle of the ten thousand things without daring to act.

As stated in the fifty-seventh chapter: *"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I do nothing, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves."* This is precisely the same principle.

The version of Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the "Chapter on Pristine Virtue," while Peng’s version calls it the "Chapter on the People’s Simplicity."

Those adept in the Dao in ancient times did not seek to enlighten the people but instead to render them simple. The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness. Governing the state through cleverness is the state’s ruin; governing the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing. To understand these two paths is to grasp the model. One who comprehends this model is said to possess mysterious virtue. Mysterious virtue runs deep and far, reversing the course of things, and thus attaining great harmony.

The Dao does not value knowledge or discernment, for these diminish its undifferentiated wholeness; it values instead the state of not-knowing and not-discerning, thereby preserving its namelessness. Thus, those adept in the Dao do not seek to enlighten the people but to render them simple.

“The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness” echoes the earlier saying: “When cunning and wisdom arise, great falsity follows.” “Governing the state through cleverness is the state’s ruin” corresponds to: “The more meticulous the governance, the more deficient the people.” “Governing the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing” aligns with: “Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.”

These two paths—cleverness and non-cleverness—truly determine the state’s fortune or misfortune and serve as the model for governance. One who understands this may be called possessed of mysterious virtue. Mysterious virtue sees profoundly, its radiance reaches far, appearing simple yet not simple, reversing the dullness of things. *Great harmony* means great transformation. Only through such mysterious virtue can one attain this great transformation.

Chapter Sixty-Six. (Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the "Chapter on Putting Oneself Last," while Peng’s version calls it the "Chapter on Excellence in Humility.")

The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel in staying low—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, when the sage wishes to rise above the people, they must speak as though beneath them. When they wish to lead the people, they must place themselves behind. Thus, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel burdened; though they stand ahead, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting them without weariness. Because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.

Rivers and seas excel in staying low, so all streams flow toward them—hence they are called kings of the hundred valleys. This illustrates the sage. To rise above the people while speaking humbly is what was previously called “the high takes the low as its foundation.” To lead the people while placing oneself behind is what was previously called “putting oneself last, yet finding oneself first.” Thus, the sage’s virtue is empty and harmonious: standing above, they possess no awe-inspiring majesty, yet the people do not feign reverence; standing ahead, they carry no overbearing force, yet the people feel no need to guard against harm. Therefore, the world exalts the sage with joy and never tires of it. None can contend with them because the sage, like rivers and seas that excel in staying low, leaves the hundred valleys with no way to divide their power.

Chapter Sixty-Seven
(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the "Chapter on the Three Treasures," and Peng’s version concurs.)

The world all calls me great, yet I seem unworthy. Precisely because I am great, I seem unworthy. Were I worthy, I would long since have been small!

I possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:
The first is compassion,
The second is frugality,
The third is not daring to be first in the world.
Through compassion, one can be courageous;
Through frugality, one can be expansive;
Through not daring to be first in the world, one can become the vessel of leadership.

Now, to abandon compassion yet seek courage,
To abandon frugality yet seek expansion,
To abandon the last yet strive to be first—
This is the path to death.

With compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.
Heaven will save them, shielding them with compassion.

The Dao is fundamentally without form or body, yet it is called great. If it had a form or body to imitate, it would no longer resemble its greatness. Only the great cannot be named as great, and so it does not resemble what people call great. If it resembled what people call great, then even the great would be small. Hence it is said, “Were it worthy, it would long since have been small!”

The highest speaks of the three treasures, which are but scattered manifestations of greatness:
The first is compassion—compassion must be resolute in benevolence, thus it can be courageous.
The second is frugality—frugality must excel in accumulation, thus it can be expansive.
The third is not daring to be first in the world—not daring to be first means great vessels mature late, thus one can become the vessel of leadership.

Yet to abandon compassion for courage is to harbor a heart of cruelty.
To abandon frugality for expansion is to harbor a heart of greed.
To abandon the last for the first is to harbor a heart of contention.
All these are paths to death.

Though the three treasures are presented in order, the first is most noble, so compassion is emphasized to complete the discourse.
With compassion, one triumphs in battle—seeing righteousness, one must act.
With it, one stands firm in defense—preserving benevolence, one must be steadfast.
“Saving them” refers to humanity: Heaven will save people, and it too must shield them with compassion.

How great is the Dao of compassion!

Chapter Sixty-Eight
(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the "Chapter on Matching Heaven," and Peng’s version concurs.)

A masterful warrior is not martial.
A masterful fighter is not enraged.
A masterful conqueror does not contend.
A masterful leader humbles himself before others.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
This is called the power of employing others,
This is called matching the ancient ultimate of Heaven.

Reliance on force is called martiality,
Reliance on qi is called rage,
Engagement in slaughter is called contention—
None of these are the way of the masterful warrior, the masterful fighter, or the masterful conqueror.

Of old, those who masterfully employed others,
Even when facing a tiger-like general among their foes,
Would always humble themselves to summon him,
Causing him to lay down his armor and come in surrender.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
That is, the power of employing others’ strength.
Moreover, such virtue suffices to match Heaven,
For Heaven does not vie for merit yet accomplishes all,
The ancient ultimate indeed.

The esoteric meaning of this chapter,
For those who cultivate the elixir,
Speaks of taming the White Tiger by first subduing the True Dragon.
For the White Tiger is a creature difficult to restrain,
And if the Dragon does not humble itself, the Tiger will surely flee.
Only when the self is refined without impurity
Can one wield the Tiger’s power.

Chapter Sixty-Nine
(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the "Chapter on the Mysterious Application," and Peng’s version titles it the "Chapter on Underestimating the Enemy.")

The strategist has a saying:
“I dare not act as host but as guest,
Dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.”
This is called marching without marching,
Repelling without arms,
Engaging without an enemy,
Wielding without weapons.
No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy;
Underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.
Thus, when opposing forces clash,
The grieving side prevails.

In warfare, let the other be host while I remain guest,
Yielding to their challenge,
Thus able to rest while they toil,
Advancing an inch and retreating a foot.
If I allow them to pursue,
I can then strike unexpectedly and capture them—
This is the subtle strategy of warfare.

“Marching without marching” means having no feet:
The left step is *chì*, the right *chù*,
Without both feet, one cannot march.
“Repelling without arms”—how can one repel without arms?
“Engaging without an enemy”—*rēng* means mutual reliance;
If enemies rely on one another, without mutual engagement, there is no enmity.
Weapons are instruments of advantage;
The warrior wields them to charge.
Without weapons, one cannot fight.

No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy;
Underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.
The greatest treasure is benevolence and righteousness.
Thus, when opposing forces clash,
Victory must belong to the grieving side—
“Grieving” echoes the previous chapter’s “compassion in battle.”

This chapter also contains the esoteric secret of the Returned Elixir,
Comparing warfare to tending the furnace.
“I” refers to cinnabar:
My household’s cinnabar dare not act as host
But must enter the other’s jade pool,
There to refine true essence—
Thus, the other becomes host and I the guest,
A reversal of host and guest.

“Advancing and retreating” refer to firing times:
Advancing an inch and retreating a foot
Does not mean failing to apply fire,
But rather exercising caution in firing,
Fearing missteps in the process.

“Marching without marching”—
Words fail to communicate, kindness and authority do not reach.
“Repelling without arms”—
The firing schedule is unclear, the matchmaker not yet found.
“Engaging without an enemy”—
Dragon and Tiger are unbalanced, weights do not match.
“Wielding without weapons”—
The talisman has not been transmitted, the medicinal ingredients not obtained.
How dare one tend the furnace and apply effort,
Risking the loss of my treasure?
My treasure: cinnabar.
Master Zǐyáng said:
*“When deploying troops, distinguish left and right armies*
*(The Upper Yang commentary notes: left and right refer to the other and myself),*
*Let them be host while I remain guest.*
*I urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy,*
*Lest you forfeit my household’s priceless treasure.”*
This is the source of his meaning.

When opposing forces clash—
That is, the other and myself face each other—
If I can use my inherent compassion and benevolence
To bind the other’s metal nature with compliant righteousness,
Then metal will come to submit to wood,
And I will surely prevail.
Thus it is said: the grieving side prevails.
Master Wúshān observes:
*“The true secret is entirely found here—*
*Where else would one seek immortal scriptures?”*

**Chapter Seventy**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the “Chapter on Knowing Difficulty,” and Peng’s version titles it the “Chapter on Knowing Me.”)*

My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.
Yet under Heaven none can know them,
None can practice them.
Words have their ancestry,
Affairs have their lord.
It is only through ignorance
That they do not know me.
Those who know me are rare,
Thus I am esteemed.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.

The Supreme’s words are all of the Dao,
Yet the Dao is not beyond the human body—
Thus it is easy to know, easy to practice.
Yet under Heaven, none can ultimately know or practice it,
As the *Doctrine of the Mean* says:
*“The Way does not prevail—I know why:*
*The wise overshoot it, the foolish do not reach it.”*
*“The Way is not evident—I know why:*
*The worthy overshoot it, the unworthy do not reach it.”*
Thus none can know or practice it.

Yet these words can serve as the origin of cultivation,
And these affairs can set forth the guiding principles of life—
Thus they have their ancestry and their lord.
This is the profound meaning of the Supreme’s scripture.
It is only because people do not know this Dao
That they do not know the Supreme.
The Supreme says:
*“Those who know me are rare,*
*Thus I am esteemed.”*
Like the sage who wears coarse cloth while holding jade:
Coarse cloth is the garb of the lowly,
Worn outwardly while fine jade is held within—
Even if few know, the esteem is undiminished.
This is what is meant by *“withdrawing from the world without being seen,*
*Knowing yet not regretting”—*
Only the sage can do this.

**Chapter Seventy-One**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the “Chapter on Knowing Illness,” and Peng’s version titles it the “Chapter on the Illness of Illness.”)*

To know yet seem not to know is supreme.
Not to know yet claim to know is illness.
Only by regarding this illness as illness
Does one avoid illness.
The sage is not ill
Because he regards illness as illness—
Thus he is not ill.

To know what others do not know
Is to have a clear Dao and manifest virtue—
Thus it is supreme.
To feign knowledge where there is none
Brings great harm to the self—
Thus it is called illness.
Only by regarding the illness of feigned knowledge as a grievous affliction
Can one be free of the illness of feigned knowledge—
Thus one avoids illness.
The sage’s freedom from illness
Follows the same principle.

**Chapter Seventy-Two**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the “Chapter on Loving the Self,” and Peng’s version titles it the “Chapter on Fearing Authority.”)*

When the people do not fear authority,
Then authority arrives.
Do not constrict their dwelling,
Do not stifle their livelihood.
It is only by not stifling
That one is not stifled.
Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Therefore he discards that and takes this.

Authority possesses the qi of stern severity;
If the people do not fear authority,
Heaven will magnify its severity.
Yet Heaven fundamentally favors life and dislikes killing—
It is people who bring killing upon themselves.
Thus one must not constrict their dwelling
Nor stifle their livelihood.

“Constrict” means to narrow;
“Dwelling” is the abode of spirit.
“Stifle” means to cut off;
“Livelihood” is the mechanism of qi.
One should broaden the abode to settle the spirit,
Extend the mechanism to guide the qi.
Only by not cutting off the qi
Can one nurture it without cessation.

Only the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Knowing himself, he retreats into solitude and self-vigilance,
Daring not flaunt himself before others.

Self-love places preservation and nurturance above all,
Daring not to boast or exalt oneself before others.
Thus one discards the heart of self-display and self-exaltation,
And embraces the heart of self-knowledge and self-love—
All centered on the earnest care of one’s own person.

Chapter Seventy-Three
Courage in daring leads to death;
Courage in not daring leads to life.
These two—one brings benefit, the other harm.
Who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion?
Even the sage finds this difficult.

The Dao of Heaven:
Though it does not contend, it excels in victory;
Though it does not speak, it excels in response;
Though not summoned, it comes of itself,
Serene yet excelling in strategy.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
Sparse yet nothing slips through.

*Courage* means resoluteness.
*Death* means the reckless heart is extinguished.
*Life* means the primordial spirit is revived.
To extinguish the reckless heart requires decisiveness—hence one must dare.
To revive the primordial spirit requires gradual cultivation—hence one must not dare.
Between death and life, harm contains benefit—dying to the heart revives the spirit.
Benefit contains harm—reviving the spirit first requires dying to the heart.
Thus it is said: “One brings benefit, the other harm,”
For benefit and harm complement each other.
Within this lies the Dao of Heaven.

Heaven has its likes and dislikes,
Silently meting out punishment and virtue,
Yet mortals struggle to fathom its reasons.
To speak only of its aversion:
The azure vault’s fundamental nature favors life,
Yet its killing mechanism remains inscrutable.
Thus even the sage, when speaking of Heaven’s Dao,
Does not dare to treat it lightly.

What is the Dao of Heaven like?
It does not dispute with mortals over right and wrong,
Yet in matters of length and brevity, it prevails.
It does not preach goodness to mortals,
Yet when fortune and misfortune arrive, all respond.
Unsummoned, it comes of itself,
Serene yet excelling in strategy.
This describes how swiftly or slowly, well or ill,
Rewards and punishments are meted out—
Applied to each person without the slightest error.

Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
Sparse yet nothing slips through—
How great and dense is its encompassing!
Those who cultivate themselves
Must steadfastly uphold their virtue to align with Heaven.

Chapter Seventy-Four
If the people do not fear death,
How can one threaten them with death?
If the people were always to fear death,
Then for those who act strangely,
I could seize and execute them—who would dare?
Yet there is always one who executes.
To execute in place of the executor
Is like hewing wood in place of the master carpenter.
Few who hew in place of the master carpenter
Do not injure their own hands.

If the people do not fear death, they will not dread execution—
Why then threaten them further with death?
If the people’s hearts always harbored a fear of death,
Then among the multitude, only those who act strangely
Could be seized and executed—who would dare grow complacent in their ways and defy death?
Confucius once said to Ji Kangzi:
“In governing, why resort to execution? If you desire goodness, the people will be good.”
When he later served in Lu, he executed only one man, Shaozheng Mao,
To strike awe into all who acted strangely—this was his intent.
Only thus could he be called a *heavenly officer*.
A *heavenly officer* is one who executes—
Heaven has its executor to eliminate the strange and perverse,
So that no one usurps the power of execution.

To forcibly take the place of the executor in carrying out executions
Is like replacing the master carpenter in hewing wood.
Few who replace the master carpenter in hewing
Do not injure their own hands.
Thus we know that few who replace the executor in executing
Do not injure their own benevolent heart.
Why resort to execution?
It is better to lead the people through goodness.

Note: *Resorting to execution* implies a deliberate intent to kill.
*Not resorting to execution* implies the absence of such intent.
If one aligns one’s spirit with uprightness,
All deviant forces will not dare to encroach—
This is the secret of effortless, virtuous execution.

Chapter Seventy-Five

The people’s hunger arises from their superiors consuming excessive taxes—this is why they hunger. The people’s unruliness arises from their superiors’ meddling—this is why they are unruly. The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life’s comforts—this is why they disregard death. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to are wiser than those who prize life.

When superiors consume excessive taxes, the people’s famine arises. When superiors meddle excessively, the people’s unruliness becomes evident. The people’s disregard for death stems from their greed for wealth and profit, their desire to enrich their lives—thus they treat their bodies lightly, heedless of danger. As the saying goes, “Men die for wealth”—this is the case. Only those who do not value wealth and profit highly maintain a clear mind and few desires, and they are wiser than those who prize life.

*My humble note: Excessive taxes starve the people, just as overtaxing the body with labor leads to withering. Excessive meddling makes governance difficult, just as overusing the spirit leads to chaos.*

**Chapter Seventy-Six**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Against Strength”; Peng’s version titles it “On Abiding Above”)*

When people are alive, they are supple and soft; when dead, they are rigid and hard. When the myriad things—plants and trees—are alive, they are tender and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus, the rigid and hard are companions of death; the supple and soft are companions of life. Therefore, when an army is strong, it will not prevail; when a tree is hard, it will be felled. The strong and great dwell below; the soft and weak dwell above.

The supple and weak pertain to *qi*; the rigid and hard pertain to bone. When *qi* gathers and the body harmonizes, there is life; when *qi* scatters and bones stand alone, there is death. The life and death of the myriad things follow this pattern. When tender and fragile, water-*qi* is abundant—thus life. When withered and dry, water-*qi* is exhausted—thus death. Rigidity and hardness are tied to death; suppleness and softness are tied to life. Should one rely solely on the easily visible forms and appearances to understand this?

Consider further the analogy: When an army is strong but does not prevail, its *qi* has already declined while the enemy’s *qi* is still flourishing. When a tree is hard, its joints knot—its hard *qi* cannot flow, and its growth halts at the size of a hand’s span. Thus, the distinction between above and below is also determined by rigidity and softness. In cultivating the self, can one not regard humility and harmony as paramount?

---

**Chapter Seventy-Seven**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “The Dao of Heaven”; Peng’s version concurs)*

Is not the Dao of Heaven like the drawing of a bow? What is high is pressed down; what is low is lifted up. What has excess is reduced; what is deficient is supplemented. The Dao of Heaven reduces excess to supplement deficiency. The Dao of man is not so—it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can take their excess to serve the world? Only those who possess the Dao.

Thus, the sage acts without relying on his actions, accomplishes without dwelling on his achievements—does he not wish to display his worth? The highest teaching speaks in plain terms: The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow, its essence lying in balance and uprightness. Press down the high, lift up the low—then both arms are level. Reduce excess, supplement deficiency—then the body is aligned. The Dao of Heaven’s marvel in harmonizing the seven celestial bodies and ordering the five phases lies precisely in its balance and uprightness. Hence it is said: “The Dao of Heaven reduces excess and supplements deficiency.”

The Dao of man is otherwise: it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive, causing the deficient to become even more deficient and the excessive even more excessive. Who can take their excess to serve the world’s deficiencies? Only those who embody Heaven’s Dao and desire that all things attain their proper place—such is the sage. He acts without reliance, accomplishes without dwelling, reduces his excess to serve the world without claiming virtue—does he not avoid displaying his worth?

*Vulgar annotation in verse:*
Heaven’s Dao diminishes the full and humility receives benefit;
Human nature consumes the meager, and loss brings greater misfortune.
If one can grasp the meaning of this classic,
The elixir of gold and cinnabar aligns with the sagely lineage.

---

**Chapter Seventy-Eight**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Trust and Responsibility”; Peng’s version titles it “Softness and Weakness”)*

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong, the soft overcomes the rigid, is known to all under Heaven, yet none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says: “One who bears the state’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain. One who bears the state’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.” Straightforward words seem paradoxical.

These three lines echo the earlier saying: “The softest under Heaven rides roughshod over the hardest under Heaven.” Nothing can replace it—no other thing can substitute for this power to attack the hard. That softness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength is a principle all know, yet none ultimately practice. Thus, the Supreme again cites the sage’s words to illustrate the great virtue of softness and weakness.

Bearing the state’s disgrace, bearing the state’s misfortune—these are the sage’s self-assumed burdens, as in: “I alone am at fault; what guilt have the people? My virtue is meager and thin; Heaven inflicts this calamity.” That “straightforward words seem paradoxical” means that the sage’s true words all turn inward, never blaming others. This, too, is the Dao of softness and weakness.

---

**Chapter Seventy-Nine**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Fulfilling Agreements”; Peng’s version concurs)*

Reconciling great resentment inevitably leaves residual bitterness—how can this be called true goodness? Thus, the sage holds the left tally and makes no demands upon others. Those with virtue oversee the contract; those without virtue enforce scrutiny. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever aligns with the good.

When the myriad regions brim with resentment, the ruler’s virtue must be meager. To encounter the people’s grievances and still refuse self-reproach, instead seeking to reconcile great resentment—even if reconciliation succeeds, unresolved bitterness remains within, and residual grievance cannot be dispelled. How can this be deemed perfect goodness? Confucius said: “Be severe with oneself and lenient toward others, and resentment will stay far away.” Thus, the sage governs the world by cultivating the virtue of self-rigor, earning the people’s trust. Without demanding of others, the people naturally place their faith in him. It is like a contract split into left and right halves, each party holding one as perpetual proof—then you harbor no deceit toward me, and I harbor no suspicion toward you. The sage holds virtue as one holds the left tally; how could the people not rejoice? Therefore, those with virtue oversee the contract, while those without virtue enforce scrutiny. *Scrutiny* means examining faults. To be meticulous in fault-finding while never reflecting on oneself is to act in a way the people will not follow.

The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever aligns with the good. As the *Book of Documents* says: “August Heaven has no favorites; it befriends those who revere it. The people have no constant allegiance; they cleave to those who are humane.”

---

**Chapter Eighty**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Standing Alone”; Peng’s version titles it “Small States”)*

Let the state be small, its people few. Though they possess tools for ten or a hundred men, let them not use them. Let the people regard death as weighty and not wander far. Though there be boats and carriages, let there be no occasion to ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, let there be no occasion to deploy them. Let the people return to knotting cords for use.

Let them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, contentment in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states may gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way, yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.

If there be those who wish to enlarge the state and multiply its people, let them possess tools for a hundred million yet not use them—surely their sufficiency will be all the greater. This is to emulate the return to antiquity and the restoration of primal simplicity.

The Supreme One does not act thus. He takes the small to exemplify the great, so that from the small, the great may be known. When a state is small and its people few, though they possess tools for ten or a hundred men and do not use them, their sufficiency will only increase. What difficulty is there in returning to unadorned simplicity? Thus, he lets the people not use their tools, treasuring only their own lives. Let them dwell in their native land and not migrate elsewhere. Let them hold death in awe and not die, nurture life and live long—what more could they seek beyond this?

In such a time, the people of the state walk with light and vigorous steps, so though they have boats and carriages, they do not ride them. Within the state’s borders, there are no thieves or bandits, so though they have armor and weapons, they do not deploy them. The governance of the state is simple and unadorned, so the practice of knotting cords may continue. Sweet food, fine clothing, secure dwellings, and joyful customs—neighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way, yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another. Thus, social obligations are few, and extravagance does not arise; material goods are abundant, and each family dwells in peace.

The lofty ones of the state say: “A single hill, a single ravine—we deem ourselves beyond the mortal world. A spring, an autumn—we seem to forget time within a gourd. Grandparents and parents live long in health; husbands and wives remain together for life. Brothers and sisters play the *xun* and *chi* in harmony; children and grandchildren train phoenixes and cranes. How is this different from the grotto heavens and blessed lands, the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss?”

---

**Chapter Eighty-One**
*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Revealing Simplicity”; Peng’s version titles it “Non-Accumulation”)*

Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.

The sage does not accumulate. The more he does for others, the more he possesses; the more he gives to others, the more he has. The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm. The Way of the sage acts and does not contend.

Truth, goodness, and wisdom all pertain to establishing words. This passage concludes the entire scripture’s meaning. Sincere discourse is simply genuine, not embellished to please the world. Those who seek to please the world employ embellishment, not sincerity—hence: “Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful.” The excellence of inherited teachings is simply correctness, not contrived to confuse others. Those who seek to confuse others employ contrivance, not proper transmission—hence: “The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good.” Penetrating writings are simply coherent, not overflowing to display talent. Those who seek to display talent overflow without restraint, not truly penetrating—hence: “The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.”

This is followed by establishing virtue and merit to fulfill the great function of this scripture. *Accumulation* means accumulating goodness. The sage does not speak of accumulating goodness but establishes his own great merit and virtue. Thus, his merit is boundless, his virtue all-encompassing. By acting for others through merit and virtue, he gains ever more; by bestowing merit and virtue upon others, he possesses ever more.

The Dao operates silently to generate and complete, thus it benefits without harming. The Way of the sage works with effortless spontaneity, not contending with others in accumulating good deeds—thus its greatness equals that of Heaven. As the ancient saying goes: “The highest establish virtue, the next establish merit, the next establish words—all three are imperishable.” This may serve as a colophon for this text.

After completing his commentary on this scripture, Master Hanxu reflected and pondered, aligning words with deeds, and declared that though he did not rely on written words, he had expressed the true mechanism. The final chapter’s commentary concludes with merit and virtue, which he deemed fine and good. Yet upon further reflection, he wondered how the four characters “acts and does not contend” could serve as the root of the eighty-one chapters. Suddenly, he realized: “Yes, yes—this single phrase is the very keystone of the entire scripture!”

The dread of cultivators lies in hearing the Dao yet still vying for petty merit, petty virtue, petty literary fame, or chasing after all ephemeral riches and honors—thus squandering their vital essence in vain. The sagely Dao aligns with the celestial Dao; the celestial Dao governs generation and completion, inherently beneficial and never harmful. Does not the sagely Dao likewise oversee creation, equally beneficial and never harmful? My wish is that those who achieve merit and fame, fulfill filial piety and loyalty, may each dwell in truth and each attain the Dao. First, practice the work of jade refinement, concealing oneself amidst the marketplace. Next, undertake the labor of gold refinement, dwelling deep in mountain valleys. Within, fulfill what must be done; without, extinguish all thoughts of contention. Only through non-contention can none in the world contend with one—such is the perfected person. The great conclusion of the sacred scripture reaches its utmost here.

*The Authentic Transmission of Laozi*
Laozi was a native of Chu. His father, Qianganyuan Gao, served as Senior Censor of Shang (alternatively, Zhou). He married Lady Hong, whose given name was Yingfu. One day, as she napped, she saw a five-colored radiance cradling the Supreme Old Lord descending from the heavens, suddenly transforming into a shooting star that flew into her mouth. There it congealed into a jade-like embryo, and after twelve years, she gave birth beneath a plum tree in Quren Village, Lai District, Ku County. Thus, he took Li as his surname. Because he was born after dreaming of the Old Lord, he was called Laozi; because his ears were long, he was named Chong’er and styled Baiyangfu. This occurred on the fifteenth day of the third month in the first year of King Wuding of Shang.

*(The above is recorded in the Immortal Scriptures and the* Lu Shi. *The* Nei Zhuan *states: “His surname was Li, his given name Er. His mother saw the essence of the sun descend like a shooting star, entering her mouth, and thus conceived. She carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth beneath a plum tree by the Guo River in Chen. Pointing to the plum tree, she said, ‘This shall be my surname.’ Born with white hair, he was called Laozi. As his ears had three openings, he was also called Lao Dan.” The* Wu Zong Wang Ji *records: “His surname was Li, his given name Zai, born on the fourteenth day of the ninth month in the year Dingsi of King Ding.” The* Yue Ling Guang Yi *states: “The Jade Maiden was Laozi’s mother. She dreamed of a five-colored radiance forming like a pellet, flowing into her mouth, which she swallowed and thus conceived. After eighty-one years of pregnancy, she rested beneath a date tree and gave birth by splitting open her left armpit. This occurred on the fifteenth day of the third month in the first year of Wuding.”)*

The *Suo Sui Qianliang Lu* states: “Qian Yuan Gao, at seventy-two years of age, remained unwed. He formed a union with his neighbor’s wife, the Lady of Extended Longevity, and after eighty years of pregnancy, she gave birth.”

The *Youyang Zazu* records: “Li’s mother was the Primordial Lady. The essence of the sun entered her mouth, which she swallowed and thus conceived. After seventy-two years, she gave birth.”

Liu Xie’s *Xin Lun* says: “Laozi was conceived by the influence of a fire star.”

The *Lu Shi* recounts: “Conceived by a shooting star’s shock, he was born after twelve years. At birth, he could speak, his face golden and hair white—hence called Laozi. His village was in Lai Township of Ku, where ‘lai’ means ‘goosefoot,’ so he was also called Lao Laizi.”

The *Gao Shi Zhuan* notes: “Laozi was born during the Yin dynasty.”

The *Shen Xian Zhuan* relates: “Laozi’s name was Chong’er. His mother conceived after sensing a great shooting star. Some say she carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth. Others claim his mother was unwed, and Laozi was her maternal surname. Still others say his mother happened upon a plum tree and gave birth beneath it. At birth, he could speak and, pointing to the plum tree, said, ‘Let this be my surname.’”

The *Lie Xian Zhuan* states: “Laozi entered his mother’s womb riding a white deer.”

The *Tang Ji* records: “Laozi’s mother conceived after eating a plum. His parents abandoned him, and after eighty years, he was born beneath a plum tree. Emperor Gaozu of Tang traced his lineage to Laozi, hence the phrase ‘the immortal plum roots entwine.’”

The *Za Zu* says: “The Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden descended with a cloud of dark and yellow qi, which she swallowed and thus conceived. After three thousand seven hundred years, she gave birth in the kingdom of Xina. This pertains to the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue, not Laozi.”

Utterly filial by nature, he transformed the customs of Lai.

From birth, he was serene and free of desire, outwardly forsaking glory and splendor, inwardly cultivating essence and qi. Through the transition from Shang to Zhou, he endured for centuries without decline, earning the name of an ancient recluse.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: “He lived to be over one hundred sixty years old, or perhaps over two hundred.” Ge Hong said: “Laozi remained in the Zhou court for over three hundred years.” The *Lu Shi* records: “His mother lived to be four hundred forty, or perhaps two hundred twenty.” The *Extensive Records* says: “He lived two hundred seventy years.” The *Shantang Sikao* claims: “Born in the reign of King Wuding of Yin, he lived until the ninth year of the First Emperor of Qin, spanning nine hundred ninety-six years.” Yet reckoning from the first year of Wuding to the ninth year of the First Emperor yields one thousand eighty-seven years in total.

During his time in Zhou, Laozi often changed his name. In the reign of King Wen, he was called Xieyi Zi (or Zhi Yi Xiansheng) and served as Archivist of the Royal Treasury. Under King Wu, he was called Yucheng Zi and served as the Chronicler Beneath the Pillar. In the reign of King Kang, he was called Guoshu Zi, and under King Qing, he was called Lao Laizi. His wife was profoundly wise, and together with Lao Laizi, they withdrew to live among the mulberry fields and plows.

He composed a work in fifteen chapters expounding the application of the Daoist arts. When King Zhuang of Chu heard of him, he sought to compare himself to Laozi. At the time, Lao Laizi was weaving, and the king approached to ask, “I wish to govern the state—may you assist me in this?” Laozi replied, “Very well.” The king then departed.

When his wife returned from gathering firewood, she asked, “Did you give him your consent?” He replied, “I did.” His wife said, “I have heard that ‘those who may be fed with wine and meat may be followed with whips and cudgels; those who may be granted office and emolument may be followed with axes and halberds.’ I cannot bear to be controlled by others.” She cast aside her basket and left. Overjoyed, Lao Laizi immediately fled with his wife.

Sima Qian records: “Laozi’s son was named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was enfeoffed at Duan. Zong’s son was Wang; Wang’s son was Yan; Yan’s great-great-grandson was Xia, who served in the Han. Xia’s son, Jie, became Grand Tutor to the Prince of Jiaoxi and settled his family in Qi.” At that time, their ancestors and descendants, fathers and sons, must have wandered without fixed abode, branching into separate lineages.

Some say: in Yue he was Fan Li; in Qi, the leather sack (Chiyi); in Wu, Tao Zhugong; in the early Han, the Yellow Stone Master; and in the reign of Emperor Wen, the Master by the River. All these remain unfathomable.

Ge Zhichuan states: Laozi appeared in every age, repeatedly changing his name. The reason, according to the *Nine Palaces*, *Three and Five Classics*, and *Yuanchen Jing*, is that each person encounters calamitous conjunctions in life. When such times arrive, one must change one’s name to align with the transformations of primordial qi, thereby transcending misfortune and prolonging life. Many Daoist practitioners today follow this practice. Laozi remained in Zhou for several hundred years, during which he must have faced more than one such conjunction, hence his many names. To properly establish the truth of Laozi’s life, one should rely primarily on historical records and verified accounts, cross-referencing them with Laozi’s esoteric scriptures. Other popular tales are largely fictitious.

Furthermore, the *Western Ascension’s Central Embryo*, *Returning Mandate’s Essence*, *Pearl Strategem and Jade Mechanism*, and *Golden Internal Classic* all describe Laozi as having a pale yellow complexion, fine brows and a broad forehead, long ears and large eyes, spaced teeth and a square mouth, thick lips, a forehead marked with three or five lines of insight, sun-like temples and moon-like brows, a nose with pure bone and twin pillars, ears with three passages, feet bearing the pattern of two and five, hands grasping the ten celestial stems, a height of nine feet, and sixty-eight teeth—such was the countenance of a sage. Those who receive the Mandate of Heaven possess divine foresight and differ from ordinary people, destined to become masters of the Dao. Thus, they are aided by celestial spirits and followed by immortals. For this reason, the methods he transmitted for transcending the world numbered nine hundred and thirty scrolls, and his talismanic writings seventy scrolls—all recorded in the central chapters of *Laozi’s Original Account*. The catalogues still exist and can be verified. Works not included in these numbers were later additions by Daoist practitioners, not authentic texts (as noted by Zhichuan).

Laozi embodied non-action and self-transformation, purity and self-rectification (*Records of the Grand Historian*). He devoted himself entirely to the pursuit of longevity, and though he remained in Zhou for a long time, his rank and position never advanced. This was because he sought to harmonize with the world while inwardly preserving his natural essence. Only after attaining the Dao did he depart—truly an immortal (*Biographies of Divine Transcendents*).

When Confucius traveled to Zhou to inquire about ritual from Laozi, Laozi said, “The man of whom you speak—his flesh and bones have long since decayed; only his words remain. Moreover, when the noble person finds the right moment, he mounts his chariot; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that ‘the good merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, and the noble person of great virtue appears foolish.’ Rid yourself of your arrogance and excessive desires, your affected demeanor and reckless ambitions—none of these benefit you.”

One day, Laozi asked Confucius, “Have you attained the Dao?”

Confucius said, “I have sought it for twenty-seven years and still have not attained it.”
Laozi said, “If the Dao could be offered to others, then none would fail to offer it to their lord. If the Dao could be presented to others, then none would fail to present it to their kin. If the Dao could be told to others, then none would fail to tell it to their brothers. If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then none would fail to transmit it to their children. Yet it cannot be done—there is no other reason: without an inner master, the Dao cannot reside within.”

When Confucius visited Laozi and spoke of benevolence and righteousness, Laozi said, “Chaff in the eyes makes the four directions seem displaced. Mosquitoes and gadflies biting the skin keep one awake all night. Now, benevolence and righteousness assail my heart and mind with such vehemence—no greater disorder exists! You, sir, should let the world not lose its uncarved simplicity, move with the wind, stand by embracing virtue, and return together to the natural—what need is there to act so strenuously, as if carrying a great drum in search of a lost child? The swan does not bathe daily to remain white, nor does the crow blacken itself daily to stay black. The natural black and white are not sufficient to distinguish beauty from ugliness. Unadorned observation does not expand one’s fundamental nature. When the spring dries up, fish find themselves on dry land, where they moisten one another with breath and foam—yet how much better to forget one another in rivers and lakes!”

Confucius said to Laozi, “I have studied the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, the rites, music, the *Changes* and its images, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—using them to seek audience with seventy-two lords.”

Debating the Way of the former kings and elucidating the traces of Zhou and Shao—yet not a single ruler could put them to use. How difficult it is to persuade others, and how hard to clarify the Dao! ”

Laozi said, “The *Six Classics* are but the worn traces of the former kings—how could they be the essence of those traces? What you speak of now are still only traces. Footprints are what shoes produce, yet are footprints the shoes themselves? ”

Confucius returned home and for three days did not speak. Zilu, finding this strange, asked him about it. Confucius said, “Of birds, I know they can fly. Of fish, I know they can swim. Of beasts, I know they can run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim with lines, those that fly with arrows. But as for the dragon, I know not how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the nine heavens. Today, having seen Laozi, is he not like the dragon? ”

Laozi dwelt in Zhou for many years. Seeing the virtue of Zhou in decline, he then rode a black ox cart westward through the Qin Pass to ascend Kunlun. The Pass Prefect Yin Xi, having observed the purple qi, knew in advance of his coming and swept the road for forty *li* to welcome him. Soon after, Laozi indeed arrived. Yin Xi said, “Master, you are about to withdraw from the world—pray compose a book for me.” Thereupon, Laozi halted his carriage at the pass and wrote the *Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand characters, imparting it fully to Yin Xi before departing.

During the Eastern Han, in Qingzhou there was a man of the Wang clan named Cheng, styled Xuanfu, with the Daoist name Donghua. He encountered the Queen Mother of the West, Wang Qizhu. Pleased by their shared surname, she bestowed upon him the title *Supreme Perfected of White Clouds* and transmitted to him Laozi’s *Azure Talismans and Jade Scriptures*, along with the *Golden Regulations and Numinous Writings*. Xuanfu practiced diligently for three years without slackening. Moved by his devotion, Laozi descended and condensed the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* into a single scroll, naming it the *Outer Radiance*, which he imparted to Xuanfu for cultivation, along with the nine revolutions and eight jade elixir’s firing times. Xuanfu then concealed his brilliance, built a hermitage, and refined himself in seclusion. Upon achieving perfection, he was titled the *Lord Emperor Donghua*, governing the lesser yang qi of the East. He was also called the *Lesser Yang of the Purple Palace* and the *Great Emperor of Fusang*, serving as a minister and assistant. After three transmissions, it reached the Pure Yang Master, who said: “Laozi’s *Outer Radiance* and the Jade Emperor’s *Inner Radiance* are both preserved in the Fusang Palace. The Donghua Patriarch extolled and transmitted them, thereby revealing Laozi’s intent to deliver the world.”

Now, Laozi’s former incarnation was as the Most High Lord Lao, and thus his concealments and transformations were as one with the Lord Lao. In high antiquity, the Lord Lao first manifested as the Three Purities. During the era of the Heavenly Sovereign, he changed his name to the *Celestial Master of Myriad Laws*; during the Earthly Sovereign’s time, to the *Mysterious Center Master*; during the Human Sovereign’s time, to *Master Unyielding*. After the Three Sovereigns, he became the *Golden Gate Lord Emperor*. In the time of Fuxi, he was *Yu Hua* (later changed to *Yu Mi*); during Shennong’s reign, *Old Master of Nine Spirits*; under Emperor Ku, *Lu Tu*; in the time of Yao, *Master of Accomplishment*; under Shun, *Master Yin Shou*; during the Xia of Yu, *Master True Conduct*; and in the Shang of Tang, *Master Bestowed Principle*. By the reign of King Wuding of Shang, he first descended in full spirit as Laozi—this was a time of opening a new phase and re-creating heaven and earth.

Later generations, not understanding, conflated the Lord Lao with Laozi, thus merging the deeds of his former incarnation with his later one. Some claim Laozi existed before heaven and earth, others that he was the essence and spirit of heaven. Those who seek the truth sigh at such vagueness, for these accounts do not appear in the *Authentic Scripture of the Old Immortal*. *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: “Where there is heavenly virtue, there is the arts of the Dao. The adepts of the Dao—when have they ever been absent? From the times of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor down to the Three Dynasties, those who manifested the arts of the Dao have appeared in every age. Why must it always be the same Laozi?” This is all due to later students who, fond of the marvelous and valuing the extraordinary, sought to exalt Laozi and thus fabricated such tales. In truth, Laozi was merely one who attained the Dao with exceptional precision—nothing divine or strange.

Why? If Laozi is said to have attained the Dao, then others may strive to emulate him. But if he is deemed divine and strange, then immortality becomes unattainable. In my humble view, the Lord Lao in earlier times was divine and strange, while Laozi in later times was like other men. What is divine and strange cannot be learned, but what is like other men can be. My intent, Zhichuan, is only to follow the factual evidence.

The Confucians say that the birth of sages arises from human qi and endows heavenly essence—this is most fitting. Laozi’s bodily existence borrowed the four great elements to form his shape. Through refined cultivation and grand endeavor, he became the model for divine immortals, the patriarch of virtue and the Dao’s tradition. When his merit was complete and his conduct fulfilled, he returned to the assembly of all heavens. Dispersed, he becomes myriad; united, he is one. His divided spirits descend into the world, all taking cultivation of the Dao as their foundation. What cannot be learned lies here, and what can be learned also lies here.

As for Zhuangzi, Dongfang Shuo, and the like, who are said to be Laozi under different names—these claims are unreliable, for they were merely those to whom Laozi granted gifts. The *Treasure Eulogy* says: “Those who produced Zhuangzi of the Mulberry Grove and Dongfang Shuo discerned subtle traces like cinnabar.” This is akin to the mother of Danyang, who dreamed of receiving a divine cinnabar script and gave birth to a great immortal. The *Immortals’ Biographies* state: “Those who follow Laozi’s teachings are all pure, empty, tranquil, and uncontentious, thus able to conceal jade within coarse robes and remain unshaken in perilous times.” Its source is deep and its flow vast—could this not be the teacher and model for all ages, as ordained by heaven and earth?

Having dwelt in Qingdao for several years, I once instructed the latecomers Zhu, Jiecheng Li, and Huifeng Liu in Laozi’s method of purity and stillness. I was ever cautious and reverent, never daring to forget the ancestral teachings.

Before was the Lord Lao, after was Laozi—are they one or two? Their harmony and distinction are perfectly clear.

The literary style of this text is like flowing water today and the former incarnation of the bright moon. (Wushan) interweaves narrative and discourse, blending history with profundity. The collected biographies of various masters all distill the finest essence. This is the first precious transmission of Laozi’s tradition.

*Categorized Explications of the* Yin Fu Jing
*Composed by Shuxia Hanxu*

**Preface to the** *Explication of the* Yin Fu Jing
The *Yin Fu Jing* establishes the methods of cultivation and refinement upon the principles of the Three Powers and the foundation of the myriad transformations. It is as if it were the primordial text since the opening of heaven and earth, for all it speaks of is the natural. Some say it is a work from the late Zhou or Warring States period, confined merely to the mechanisms of theft, life, and death. They suspect it of being bizarre and extraordinary, unaware that its principles are in truth level and upright. Some claim it was authored by Li Quan of the Daguanzi, and if Quan could speak thus, I would rank him alongside Guangcheng. Others say Guangcheng was Laozi’s former incarnation in the era of qi-transformation and should not have spoken in such terms. Little do they realize that the ancient was also heaven and earth, and the present is also heaven and earth; the ancient was also sun and moon, and the present is also sun and moon. Yet this text was obtained from the Tiger’s Mouth Crag on Mount Song, and only emerged in the Tang dynasty. Since the time of the Yellow Emperor, thousands of years had passed, so later generations could not but harbor doubts. Quan encountered the Old Mother of Mount Li, who transmitted to him the profound meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*. She admonished him: “The *Yin Fu Jing* contains over three hundred characters: a hundred expound the Dao, a hundred expound the arts, and the three are interwoven as one. Above lies the Way of divine immortals embracing the One; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the techniques for strengthening the army and securing victory. These are no empty words.”

The terms "upper," "middle," and "lower" do not refer to the names of three chapters but rather to three levels of meaning. These three are interwoven and blended within the text, recurring and unfolding subtly throughout its passages—precisely what is meant by "interweaving the three and merging them as one."

Daoist adepts regard "strengthening the army and securing victory" as matters pertaining to the refinement of the elixir and the upward ascent of the Dao. Why, then, is it labeled as the "lower" level? Laozi said: *"Fine weapons are an inauspicious qi; they are used only when there is no other choice."* In my earlier commentary on the *Daode Jing*, I mistakenly received the approval of a sagely teacher. Recently, upon continuing with the *Yin Fu Jing*, I admired its brevity of text, its profound intent, and how each character cuts to the essence of secret alchemical language. Thus, I once more settled my mind to observe things clearly and composed this commentary to elucidate its meaning.

*Preface by Juanshi Shanren Huoxi Yue on the Great River*

People know the divine as divine but do not understand why the non-divine is divine. I observe Hanxu—his appearance is that of a fool, and others take him for one. Yet I do not. When Hanxu annotated the *Daode Jing*, the *Qingjing Jing*, the *Dingguan Jing*, and the *Wuchu Jing*, people marveled at him, but I did not. Recently, upon contemplating the heavens and discerning the "Five Thieves," examining the earth and discussing the pacification of the people—principles for a peaceful populace and a prosperous state, techniques for strengthening the army and securing victory—all were expounded in his commentary on the *Yin Fu Jing*. From this, even I cannot fathom the depths of Hanxu’s wisdom.

The *Preface* asserts that *"since the beginning of creation, there must have been writing"* and vigorously defends its antiquity, demonstrating both talent and insight. The *Yin Fu Jing* emerged in the time of the Yellow Emperor, after the slaughter of Chiyou. The Yellow Emperor sought out Guangchengzi, who transmitted this text to him. Silently observing the ministers at court—such as Feng Hou, Li Mu, Qi Bo, Tongjun, Dou Bao, and Da Nao—all of whom understood the mechanisms of killing, the cycles of life and death, and the workings of the *jiazi* calendar, Guangchengzi surveyed them and spoke in cryptic, perilous language, concealing within it a path of perfect clarity. His intent was for all in the Yellow Emperor’s retinue to hear this wondrous teaching. To enlighten the Yellow Emperor was to enlighten his ministers—how vast was Guangchengzi’s true capacity!

Confucians of the Three Dynasties and later have doubted whether this is a text from before the Three Dynasties, but their skepticism merely skims the surface of its words. Suppose there were an elixir of immortality brought to market for sale. If one falsely claimed it was rat poison, or even said it could cure illness, people would surely dismiss and ridicule it, perhaps even revile it, for how could a poison also heal? Yet those with discernment would purchase and consume it, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight. This is precisely the meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*—precisely the meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*.

*Composed with reverence by Zhang Quanyi, Daoist friend of the Purple Radiance Grotto on Penglai Mountain*

*Collected Evaluations from Various Masters*

**Daguanzhi** said: *"Internally, it reveals the mechanisms of heaven; externally, it aligns with human affairs. In its subtlety, even the Eight Scenes of the* Huangting *are insufficient to match its profundity. In its essential teachings, the hundred schools of philosophy and history cannot compare. In its strategic ingenuity, even the works of Sunzi, Wuzi, and Han Fei pale in wonder. Thus, the nature of all things, the calculations of success and failure, the principles of life and death—all are but mechanisms."*

**Zhang Guo** said: *"To observe the Dao of nature is to observe nothing. Not observing with the eyes but with the mind. Observing the profoundly subtle yet seeing nothing—thus one illuminates the nature of the natural. This is what is meant by* yin. *To grasp the conduct of nature is to grasp nothing. Not grasping with the hands but with the mechanism. The mechanism is adaptable and unbound—thus one harmonizes with the manifestations of the natural. This is what is meant by* fu *(another interpretation)."*

Lü Chunyang said: *"The Song Confucian Shaozi was skilled in reading the* Yin Fu Jing. *‘The cosmos lies within the palm, the myriad transformations arise from the body.’ These are words from the* Yin Fu Jing, *and the* Jirang Pian *borrowed its lines—how subtle the resonance of those who grasp it without words."*

Lü Qiu Cimeng said: *"What the* Yin Fu Jing *calls ‘The Dao of nature is quiescent, thus heaven and earth and the ten thousand things are born. The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual, thus yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang mutually impel one another, and transformations proceed in accord.’ These few lines—even the words of the Six Classics cannot surpass them."*

Master Zhu said: *"The four lines beginning with ‘The Dao of nature is quiescent’ are exquisitely put. That stillness can generate movement means it gradually recedes in this way, then gradually grows in that. The Dao of heaven and earth constantly reveals itself to humanity in just this manner."* He further remarked: *"The line ‘The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual’ is superb. The Dao of yin and yang is such that they prevail over one another without a single day’s pause, steadily pressing forward bit by bit—this one retreats a fraction, that one advances a fraction."* And again: *"Were it not for utter stillness, heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things would not arise. The word ‘gradual’ is masterfully chosen—‘gradual’ means incremental. The Dao of heaven and earth incrementally waxes and wanes, thus hardness and softness prevail. This is the principle underlying good fortune, misfortune, constancy, and victory. The* Yin Fu Jing *is particularly fine in such passages."*

Master Zhu also said: *"The* Yin Fu Jing’s *teaching of ‘three returns in day and night’ resembles the cultivation practices of the midnight-noon circulation—today thus, tomorrow thus, and the more familiar one becomes, the more efficacious the results."*

The *Yin Fu Kao Yi* states: *"The commentary attributed to the Old Mother of Mount Li is often a later forgery, its language and meaning remarkably shallow."*

The inclusion of Zhang Guo’s sayings reveals that this text postdates him.

Ouyang Xunqi said: *"When the Dao and its arts fragmented, those who could write each composed their own books. Straightforward words often appear flawed or impure, yet the* Yin Fu Jing *alone employs paradox to align with truth."*

Wei Heshān said: *"Li Jiayou was broadly versed in the classics and the hundred schools, and deeply steeped in the* Book of Changes*. In his later years, he grasped the teaching of ‘specializing in qi to attain suppleness,’ and through exhaustive study and reflection on the* Yin Fu Jing *and* Cantong Qi*, he held fast to them without wavering. Thus, those who comprehend the Dao necessarily unite these two texts with the* Book of Changes*, employing them as one."*

Lu Qianxu said: *"The* Yin Fu Jing *and* Daode Jing *both speak of the mechanisms of inversion and counter-application. As for governing the state, waging war, seizing the realm, or the phrases ‘there are wondrous devices,’ ‘the ten thousand images arise,’ ‘the eight trigrams and the sexagenary cycle,’ and ‘divine mechanisms and hidden spirits’—all contain profound principles. Yet the world, not understanding, labels the* Yin Fu Jing *as a treatise on military strategy and uses the* Laozi *for governance, missing the mark entirely."*

The *Yin Fu Jing* is a manual of cultivation. *Yin fu* is spoken of in contrast to *yang fire*; it speaks of yin without mentioning yang, for yang is contained within it. The *Yi Yi* states: *"The Dao is called the alternation of yin and yang."* That yin is placed before yang reflects the principle of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things: without stillness, there is no movement, just as *Bo* precedes *Fu*. This single scroll of the *Yin Fu Jing* is the pivot of yin-yang interpenetration. The numinous perishes here, and the non-numinous numinous arises here. This is where concealment and manifestation, reversal and return, ingress and egress, the waxing and waning of sun and moon, the ebb and flow of great and small, the root of life and death’s restraint, the ground where kindness and harm contend, and the realm of water and fire’s advance and retreat all unfold. When yin and yang restrain each other, yin and yang prevail. The *Yin Fu* commands the numinous transformations of change. Yet those who wield the *Yin Fu* must know that the body possesses wondrous devices. Concealing these devices within, awaiting the moment to act, the trigrams, the sexagenary cycle, heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits will all accord with the Dao—what difficulty then remains in enriching the state, pacifying the people, strengthening the army, securing victory, and embracing unity to preserve the true?"

Zheng’s *Bibliographic Survey* records thirty-eight transmitted commentaries on the *Yin Fu Jing*, totaling fifty-one scrolls. Over the centuries since, the number of annotations has grown beyond measure. I have now synthesized explanations from the *Laozi*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *Cantong Qi*, entitling it *A Categorized Exegesis*. *"Observe the Dao of heaven, grasp the movement of heaven—this is all."*

*"Observe the Dao of heaven"*—the text opens by speaking of the *Yin Fu*. Laozi said: *"Achieving merit, attaining fame, then withdrawing—this is the Dao of heaven."* *"Grasp the movement of heaven"*—the next phrase supplements *yang fire*. The *Xici* states: *"Heaven’s movement is ceaseless; the noble person strengthens themselves without pause."* To observe the Dao of heaven is to witness its flourishing and fulfillment, its retreat and storage at winter’s advent—the meaning of *Kun*’s six lines reaching exhaustion lies herein. To grasp the movement of heaven is to seize its latent emergence, its vigilant leaping, until the ninth-five, when the flying dragon ascends to heaven—the meaning of *Kun* following heaven’s movement rides in its wake. The opening two sentences subtly encompass the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*, for the *Yin Fu* is the Dao of the *Book of Changes*. *"This is all"*—an exclamation of ultimate insight.

*"Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper. The five thieves reside in the heart, enacted upon heaven. The cosmos lies within the hand, the ten thousand transformations arise within the body."*

*Thieves* here align with the meanings of *restraint* and *plunder* below. The *five thieves* are the five phases. Heaven possesses the five phases, where mutual restraint harbors the subtlety of mutual generation, and mutual plunder conceals the mechanism of mutual appropriateness. One who penetrates this principle will see the flourishing of the Dao and qi. The five phases reside within the human heart; only by inverting and counter-applying them can mutual restraint and generation, mutual plunder and appropriateness be achieved. Observing this profound principle, one sees that it is already so in heaven. Those who embody heaven’s enactment will hold the cosmos in their hand and give birth to the ten thousand transformations within their body. *"Thus it is."*

Having spoken of *"giving birth to the body,"* the five thieves are no longer thieves. Heaven’s nature is humanity; the human heart is the trigger. *"Establish the Dao of heaven to stabilize human life."* *Nature* is principle. The *five thieves* are heaven’s principle, which is also humanity’s principle. Within the person, they are activated by the heart, enabling restraint to harbor generation and plunder to conceal appropriateness—all through the single word *trigger*. The *Yi Yi* states: *"Establish the Dao of heaven as yin and yang."* Speaking of heaven includes earth; speaking of earth includes humanity. Thus, *"establish the Dao of heaven to stabilize human life."* Yin and yang encompass the five phases—how could humanity exist outside yin and yang?

*"When heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, the stars and planets conceal (or fall) themselves. When earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land. When humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn. When heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the ten thousand transformations establish their foundation."*

*Unleashing* is the mechanism of life; *killing* is the mechanism of death. Life and death are the triggers of movement and stillness. Concealing the mechanism of life within the mechanism of death is stillness preceding movement. *"Conceal themselves"* speaks of covert transformation—stillness is spoken of, yet movement is implied. *"Rise from the land"* speaks of surging forth from the earth—movement is spoken of, yet stillness is implied. The phrases of the *Yin Fu* often each express half, prompting the reader to infer the rest. *"When humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn"*—humanity and heaven-earth form a triad, their killing mechanisms naturally analogous to the *Book of Changes*’ *"reversing its path, returning in seven days."* *Reversal* is the handle of life and death’s alternation, the power of waxing and waning’s control. *"When heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the ten thousand transformations establish their foundation."*

"This mechanism is the same, this principle is the same. Long ago, Patriarch Lü transformed himself into a servant in the Chen household. Chen and a Daoist were discussing how *'when humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn,'* yet they did not grasp the essence of the killing mechanism. Patriarch Lü interjected from the side, saying: *'The living do not truly live; the dead do not truly die. If one kills life after it has arisen and learns death before it arrives, then one attains longevity.'*

Now, considering Patriarch Lü’s words, we understand that the killing mechanism is the pivotal point of life and death. Alas, Chen was misled by the Daoist—startled at first, then swiftly bewildered.

Nature possesses both decay and clumsiness, which can be concealed. The nine orifices’ deviations lie in the three essentials, where movement and stillness operate. Fire arises from wood, yet disaster inevitably consumes it. Treachery arises in the state, and when the moment moves, it must collapse.

To know this and cultivate refinement is to be called a sage.

There is the nature of *qi*-constitution and the original nature. The nature of *qi*-constitution appears skillful but is truly clumsy. The original nature appears clumsy but is truly skillful. These two can be concealed. When concealed, they remain profoundly still; when stimulated, they penetrate all. The skillful conceals clumsiness, and clumsiness conceals skill.

The reason people cannot conceal themselves lies in the deviations of the nine orifices. Among these, the ears, eyes, and mouth are the three essentials. These three can move and can be still. In stillness, one contains the light of the eyes, condenses the resonance of the ears, and seals the *qi* of the tongue—thus the three essentials reverse into three treasures. In movement, form blinds, sound deafens, and flavor dulls—thus the three essentials become three calamities.

Do you not see fire? It arises from wood yet consumes wood, just as sight arises from the eyes yet harms them, hearing arises from the ears yet injures them, and flavor arises from the mouth yet dulls it. Likewise, treachery arises in the state: in stillness, deviance lies hidden; in movement, it collapses.

If one knows the mechanism of movement and stillness, masters stillness, and cultivates refinement, then one may be called a sage.

Heaven gives life, heaven takes life—such is the principle of the Dao. Heaven and earth are the thieves of the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things are the thieves of humanity. Humanity is the thief of the ten thousand things. When the three thieves are fitting, the three powers are at peace. Thus it is said: *'Eat in accord with the seasons, and the hundred parts of the body are ordered; move in accord with the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace.'*"

Life and death are the wondrous principles of Heaven, which are the wondrous principles of the supreme Dao. That which kills first steals and conceals the qi of life. Heaven and earth are the thieves of the ten thousand things. Thus, at winter solstice when spring returns, the qi of life first conceals itself in the place of returning to the root. The ten thousand things are the thieves of humanity, so when sprouts emerge and husks split, the qi of life first conceals itself within the union of essence. Humanity is the thief of the ten thousand things, so when taking much and using broadly, the qi of life first conceals itself within preservation and nurturance. Within killing there is life—this is to cultivate primordial qi while awaiting the proper time, which is called "theft."

In every movement and stillness, the constant of the Two Modes is that they nurture and advance together, and the three thieves nourish one another. Once they nourish one another, Heaven, earth, and humanity mutually conceal their functions. The Three Powers are Heaven, earth, and humanity; though "things" are not mentioned, they are included. If one is not at peace, there must be something that does not accord. When the three thieves are fitting, the Three Powers are also at peace. When the Three Powers are at peace, they give birth to and nurture the ten thousand things, moving in accord with the seasons.

The phrase *"Thus it is said"* continues the above and cites an ancient saying: the time when the mechanism of life first stirs is the moment when the qi mechanism first moves. If one swallows it into one’s own domain at that very moment, then the hundred parts of the body are ordered. The mechanism is the mechanism of killing; after great stillness, the first stirring of life arises, and if one ingests it in accord with the time, then the ten thousand images are at great peace. Thus it is said: *"Move in accord with the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace."*

People know the numinousness of the numinous, but do not know why the non-numinous is numinous. The sun and moon have their cycles, their waxing and waning have their measures, and sagely achievement arises from this, while the workings of spirit emerge from this. In the practice of refinement, nothing is more wondrous than spirit. People know that what is spiritually active is numinous, but do not know why what does not employ spiritual activity is numinous. This spirit arises from the extreme of stillness; when the time comes, the spirit knows, and skillfully discerns the mechanism of movement.

In its movement, the mechanism is like the sun and moon having their cycles. The *Cantong qi* says:
*"On the third day, brightness emerges, as Zhen and Geng receive from the west.
On the eighth day, Dui receives Ding, and the waxing half is level as a string.
On the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete, and the fullness of Jia fills the east.
On the sixteenth, it turns to receive governance, as Xun and Xin appear at dawn.
Gen meets Bing in the south, and the waning half is on the twenty-third.
On the thirtieth, Kun and Yi are in the northeast, where its light is lost."*
These are the cycles of the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.

The six gates and great medicine are measured by the sage using the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. And the six stages of obtaining the elixir should also be aligned with the measures of yin and yang. The *Cantong qi* says: *"Yin and yang intertwine, the small departs and the great arrives."* When the small departs, the preceding movement is brief—this is the second stage of seeking the medicine. When the great arrives, the subsequent movement is long—this is the fourth stage of compounding the elixir. The twelvefold firing times lie within the cycles of the sun and moon and the measures of their waxing and waning. The sage’s achievement arises from this, and the workings of spirit emerge from this.

As for the mechanism of theft, none in the world can see it, none can know it. The noble person who obtains it strengthens the self; the petty person who obtains it treats life lightly. The mechanism of theft is the mechanism of seizing and plundering. Not only are the mutual conquests of the Five Phases and the mutual encroachments of the Three Powers mechanisms of theft, but even embracing spirit and guarding qi, extracting from Kan to fill Li, are also mechanisms of theft. The perfected person silently moves the numinous mechanism, enters the watery palace, creates in the golden land, follows in the footsteps of the profoundly subtle, and cuts off seeing and hearing—within this, there is that which none can see, none can know. The numinousness of the numinous dies here, and the numinousness of the non-numinous arises here. Thus, the noble person who obtains this mechanism of theft can create destiny and strengthen the self, while the petty person who obtains it will surely harm the self and treat life lightly. This is what is meant by: *"The upright person uses it for uprightness, the deviant person uses it for deviance."*

The blind are skilled in listening, the deaf are skilled in seeing. Cutting off profit from one source yields tenfold advantage from the teacher. Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold advantage from the teacher. The blind use their ears as eyes, listening to discern people’s smiles and expressions—thus it is said: *"The blind are skilled in listening."* The deaf use their eyes as ears, using them to gauge people’s voices and emotions—thus it is said: *"The deaf are skilled in seeing."* Yet within our own bodies, there are those without eyes who can listen with subtlety, and those without ears who can see with acuity. Skill in seeing and listening lies in distinguishing whether the source of water is clear or turbid.

Laozi said: *"Water is good at benefiting the ten thousand things."* From this, we know that cutting off excessive beauty reveals the true source of the One. *"Yields tenfold advantage from the teacher"* refers to the *Yijing*’s hexagram of Earth over Water as "the teacher." Earth conquers water yet does not move it, so the water becomes even clearer. Using the teacher means employing earth to conquer water, advancing through danger yet proceeding smoothly. With this, one poisons the world, yet the people follow—what blame could there be? Ten is spoken of as the number of completion.

*"Three returns"* refers to the number three belonging to wood. The fire essence and water mercury of the Li palace are born within wood, and the fire concealed within wood sinks together into the Kun palace. Kun truly completes Kan and gives birth to water, and the true qi within water becomes metal. After wood carries metal back, one must use *Zhun* and *Meng* to draw and add—thus it is said: *"Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold advantage from the teacher."* Ten thousand is spoken of as the number of wholeness.

The fire tally of ten months can refine the treasure into the elixir. Seven returns and nine refinements are the three returns. The mind is born from things and dies from things. The mechanism lies in the eyes. Heaven is without kindness, yet great kindness arises from it. Swift thunder and fierce winds—none do not stir foolishly. The mind moves because of things—this is being born from things. Pursuing things to the point of loss—this is dying from things.

The deviance of the nine orifices lies in the three essentials. Of the deviance of the three essentials, nothing is more essential than the eyes. To halt the mechanism, one must employ "no kindness." Heaven is without kindness, yet great kindness arises from it—within death there is life, within movement there is stillness. Swift thunder and fierce winds all arise from the midst of foolish stirring, yet naturally possess numinous activity.

Should Heaven perpetually employ its wind and thunder, the numinous qi of wind and thunder would eventually be exhausted. How then, beneath the heavy yin, could it await the resurgence of earthly thunder and summon the renewing winds of *xun*?

Supreme joy is abundant in nature; supreme stillness is restrained in nature. Heaven’s utmost partiality becomes the utmost impartiality in its use. Extending the principle of "no kindness" from above, "no kindness" is akin to "non-action"—the utmost of joy, the utmost of stillness. Supreme joy is leisurely and abundant in nature; supreme stillness is pure and incorrupt in nature. Thus, at times Heaven thunders without wind, appearing utterly partial. Yet from this seeming chaos, it issues commands—this is Heaven’s utmost impartiality. Utmost partiality resembles "no kindness," while utmost impartiality gives rise to great kindness.

The regulation of creatures lies in qi. Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Kindness arises from harm, and harm arises from kindness. Sinking water into fire invites self-destruction. (These two lines, in Wang Fengzhou’s edition, follow "harm arises from kindness," forming a coherent meaning; here, the text follows his version.)

The *Baihu Tong* states: "禽 (*qin*) means to be captured and controlled by man." The regulation of creatures lies in qi—qi is spoken of in terms of fire, and creatures in terms of the Vermilion Bird. To regulate creatures with qi is to regulate fire with fire. The *Cantong Qi* says: "The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding balance and adjusting victory and defeat." This refers to the moment when earth suppresses water and prevents its rise; only the Vermilion Bird’s fire can maintain equilibrium, adjust the balance of power, and through intense refinement, cause water to boil and steam to rise, carrying metal upward with it. Thus, the regulation of the Vermilion Bird lies in sinking fire into water to lift water and restrain fire.

Within this lies the mechanism of life and death: when water boils and fire ascends into the *Li* palace, the *Li* fire is extinguished by the *Kan* water—this is "life as the root of death." Subdued and constrained, unable to fly or flee, lead and mercury both perish, returning together to the fertile earth. Only through this great death does true life emerge—this is "death as the root of life."

"Kindness arises from harm": sinking fire into water. "Harm arises from kindness": drawing water into fire. The marvel of sinking water into fire lies in its self-generated life and death within the process, hence it is said: "self-invited destruction." Fools revere the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred, while I regard the patterns of the seasons and things as wise.

Fools deem those who feign ignorance as sages; I deem those who do not feign ignorance as sages. Fools regard those who await the appointed time as sages; I regard those who do not await the appointed time as sages. (These six lines are said by tradition to be the words of Wu Bo’s praise. The Fengzhou manuscript omits them, but I retain them here, placing them below “self-invited destruction.”)

Fools take mastery of celestial patterns and scrutiny of earthly principles as sagacity—yet if this is all, what benefit does it bring to body and mind? I examine the marvel of seasonal movement within celestial patterns and contemplate the mechanism of life’s emergence within earthly principles, stealing from Heaven and Earth to seize the workings of Creation—only then do I not shame the name of wisdom. This is what is meant by “observing the Dao of Heaven and grasping the movements of Heaven”—it is perfection itself.

“Fools deem those who feign ignorance as sages; I deem those who do not feign ignorance as sages.” This is what is meant by “those who refine through knowledge are called sages.” “Fools regard those who await the appointed time as sages; I regard those who do not await the appointed time as sages.” This is what is meant by “people know the divine as divine, yet do not know the divinity of the non-divine.”

Moreover, the sun and moon follow fixed paths, the great and small adhere to their measures, the Three Powers steal from one another—all are the sagely workings of nature. What is strange about this?

These six lines all seem to elaborate and praise the preceding passage.

The Dao of nature is quiescent, thus Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual, thus yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang propel one another, and transformations proceed in harmony. The Dao of nature is simply quiescence alone. From quiescence arises movement, and through movement, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is simply gradualness alone. Gradualness is the image of nature. Yin gradually descends, yang gradually ascends. The marvel of yin and yang’s ascent and descent lies in their mutual overcoming. Without mutual overcoming, there is no mutual propulsion. Yin and yang propel one another, and transformations proceed in accordance with nature.

Transformations are the image of advance and retreat. Master Zhu said: “These four lines on nature are exquisitely put.” He also said: “The character ‘gradual’ is wonderfully chosen.”

Thus, the sage knows the Dao of nature cannot be defied and thereby harnesses it. The Dao of utmost quiescence cannot be matched by calendrical calculations. Hence, there is the marvelous device from which arise the ten thousand images, the Eight Trigrams, and the celestial stems and earthly branches. Within it lie the divine mechanisms, the hidden workings of ghosts, and the arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming. How luminous—it transcends mere images!

To “thereby harness it” means to take the Dao of nature and fashion it into the methods of refinement. The Dao of nature truly emerges from utmost quiescence. Within this quiescence, there exists another realm of years and months, Heaven and Earth—unfathomable by human calendars and measurements.

Where does quiescence reside? There is a marvelous device: the Mysterious Pass, the single aperture. Within it, the ten thousand images arise, the Eight Trigrams transform, and the celestial stems and earthly branches revolve. The divine mechanisms are unfathomable, the hidden workings of ghosts are inscrutable, and the numerology of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming all emerge from within. How luminous—this is a principle visible to all, not some obscure or esoteric matter. It transcends mere images, for images are but the images of the *Yi*.

The *Taishang Huangting Waijing Jing*
Secret Manuscript of the Two Perfected Ones, Danxia and Qingxia
Commentary by Hanxuzi of Zixia Cave, Mount Yuanqiao

**Chapter One**
Laozi, in leisure, composed seven-character verses,
Explaining the body’s form and the various spirits.
Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin,
Before the Dark Gate, behind the Gate of Life.
Breathing the void into the Cinnabar Field,
Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root.
The Youth Who Governs the True consumes fetal essence—
Those who can refine this may endure forever.

This chapter is the opening hymn of the Lesser Yang Patriarch. The Patriarch said: Lord Lao often recited the Jade Texts, and from the *Neijing Jing*, he distilled the essentials into seven-character verses, still calling it the *Huangting*, but distinguishing it as the *Waijing*. “Inner” and “outer” refer to before and after, not the internal and external of the body. What it expounds are the five forms of the body and the ten thousand spirits within—truly essential teachings.

The Most High takes emptiness and non-being as the root. Between above and below, before and behind, there exists a circle of emptiness and non-being. Those who can guard this will find their breath deeply entering the Cinnabar Field, nurturing the primordial, utterly pure water in the Jade Pool of another’s household to irrigate their own numinous root. When the numinous root is firm, the foundation of the elixir is established.

The Youth Who Governs the True is the fetal infant. The fetal infant is the ancestor of the ten thousand spirits. Nurturing it daily, consuming the mysterious essence of fetal breathing—those who refine this may attain immortality. Irrigating the numinous root speaks of nourishing the self with the postnatal; consuming fetal essence speaks of nurturing the elixir with the prenatal. Such is the marvelous meaning of this hymn.

The *Huangting Jing* transmitted in the world omits Laozi’s two lines on leisure and alters the rest into four-character verses: “Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin, before the Dark Gate, behind the Gate of Life. Breathing beyond the hut, entering and exiting the Cinnabar Field—those who can practice this may endure forever.” The line about the Youth Who Governs the True is missing from all versions. Without seeing the true text, one nearly loses the true visage of Mount Lu.

When I first intended to annotate the *Huangting*, I was suddenly visited in my mountain studio by the Perfected One Danxia, who said: “I received a letter from Lady Wei, instructing you to collate and annotate the *Huangting*, and to show you the secret manuscript from the Orchid Terrace for a day.” There was a Daoist, Canxia, who obtained a manuscript from Yang, the Prefectural Governor of Nanyue, and sent it to Chipingzi, who then showed it to me. Comparing it with Danxia’s version, I found that the celestial palace’s secret records were indeed identical. Delighted, I recorded this in the annotations.

**Chapter Two**

The Perfected One of the Yellow Court wears crimson robes,
With bolts and locks sealing the double gates.
The Dark Gatekeeper makes them towering and majestic,
While within the Cinnabar Field, essence and qi grow subtle.

The Jade Pool’s limpid water nurtures fertile soil,
The numinous root stands firm, never aging nor withering.
*Yao* and *yao* are both locks—their mechanism has yin and yang:
When the gate is closed, the yang bolt enters the yin socket,
so the lock fastens and the double gates seal.
This metaphor speaks of spirit and qi uniting,
like yin and yang interlocking.
Those who write *zhuang* (壮) are mistaken.

"Nurturing fertile soil" means drawing the purest, undisturbed water
from another’s Jade Pool to irrigate daily.
Thus, barren earth transforms into rich soil,
and the numinous root takes deep, stable hold,
remaining steadfast and unyielding,
never withering even in old age.
I have seen this in the fourth chapter of the *Inner Radiance*.

**Chapter Three**
Within the Central Pool dwells a scholar clad in crimson,
Three inches below the field lies the spirit’s abode.
Inner and outer are kept apart, doubly sealed—
Within the spirit’s chamber, devote yourself to cultivation.
The Mysterious Throat’s qi-channel receives the essence-tally;
Hasten to secure your essence to sustain yourself.

The Central Pool is the Sea of Qi, also called the Center.
Within it resides one who cultivates the body,
clad in crimson robes—this refers to the heart-spirit.
The *field* is the Cinnabar Field.
One inch below it is the Pass of Origin,
two inches, the Central Pole,
three inches, the Meeting of Yin—
all are dwelling places of the spirit,
not just the Central Pool.
Though the Central Pool and the three inches below the field
are separated by inner and outer,
if they are tightly sealed layer upon layer,
the inner spirit will not escape.

The *spirit’s chamber* is the spirit’s dwelling.
Within it, one must cultivate purity and stillness,
allowing no external distractions to intrude.
Preserve it as if it were ever-present,
nurturing the inner fire of spirit.
When water suddenly arrives to balance it,
the Mysterious Throat’s qi-channel bears the essence-tally.
The *essence-tally* is the union of essence and spirit,
using water to temper fire.
Essence within my body is called *child-essence*.
From this, swiftly secure and harmonize it to sustain yourself,
and the Orthodox Unity will contain its bloom.

---

**Chapter Four**
Within the dwelling resides a scholar ever clad in deep red—
If you can perceive him, you will not fall ill.
A horizontal path, a foot in length, binds him above;
If you can guard it, you will know no harm.
Inhaling and exhaling within the chamber to replenish yourself,
Preserve its wholeness and firmness, and the body will receive blessings.
Within the square inch, carefully conceal and store—
Spirit and essence return, and old age regains youth.
Let the Dark Gatekeeper’s flow descend to its end,
Nurture the jade tree of the child so it may serve as a staff.

The opening line echoes the *Inner Radiance*:
"Within the dwelling resides a Perfected One, ever clad in cinnabar."
The *dwelling* is the numinous abode,
the ground where yin elixir is cultivated.
It is also called the *chamber* or the *square inch*.
Measured horizontally, its length does not exceed a foot,
binding the inner spirit above.
Ensure the inner realm does not leak out,
and the outer realm does not intrude.
Guard it here, breathe here,
preserve and nurture here,
conceal and store here,
and spirit and essence return to their root here.

The Dark Gatekeeper makes the flow surge downward to its end—
*end* means cessation.
*Nurturing the jade tree of the child* means irrigating the numinous root,
so its jade branches flourish,
able to serve as a staff.
This metaphor speaks of the inner elixir’s accomplishment,
the meaning of supporting old age.

---

**Chapter Five**
The Supreme Dao is not burdensome nor deviates from its course,
The numinous terrace stands at heaven’s center, overlooking the central wilds.

Within the square inch lies the space beneath the Dark Gate,
Within the Jade Chamber stand the spirit’s gates and doors.
All these were taught to me by the Lord’s Son.

*Wù* means opposition, but also movement.
The Supreme Dao moves in reversal,
yet differs from the heterodox paths’ reversal—
those that ascend left and descend right are not the true course.
It must rise behind and descend before,
for this is the great road of nature.

The Numinous Terrace arises at heaven’s center,
the very place where the true heart manifests.
Below, it overlooks the central wilds,
its attention fixed upon the Central Yellow Court.
The *square inch* is the compass’s center;
*beneath the Dark Gate* is below the navel.
The Jade Chamber is the *Inner Radiance*’s Golden Casket and Jade Chamber—
when speaking of the Jade Chamber, the Golden Casket is also within.

Man’s spirit dwells in the eyes,
hence they are the spirit’s gates and doors,
as the classic says: “The mechanism lies in the eyes.”
This is the essence of the Supreme Dao,
all taught to me by the Lord’s Son, Wood’s Duke.
The Lord’s Son is the Thunder Sovereign,
the eldest son, the Dragon.
The Dragon emerges from fire,
mercury’s nature is numinous and penetrating.
The Dao teaches one to first clarify one’s own nature;
when one’s own nature is clarified,
one awakens of oneself.
Awakening of oneself
is like the Lord’s Son teaching me.

---

**Chapter Six**
The Hall of Light extends in four directions, the source of the Dharma Sea.
Before me stands the True Man’s Elixir Child.
Between the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—
if you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.

The Hall of Light is the Hall of Light Palace.
This palace lies within an inch between the brows,
where sun, moon, and constellations shine with radiance,
hence “extends in four directions.”
When the medicine is circulated here,
it is the gathering place of the elixir method,
the source of living water from which all transforms—
hence “the source of the Dharma Sea.”

The *Elixir Child* is the Golden Embryo.
The Golden Embryo is the True Man’s body.
With metal restraining wood,
the mother comes to see the child,
forming the true body—
hence “the True Man’s Elixir Child.”
From the Hall of Light, one enters the Spirit Chamber;
the Spirit Chamber lies before the Hall of Light,
hence “stands before me.”

The Three Passes are explained in the *Inner Radiance* commentary.
*“If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun”*—
this is a wondrous phrase within the mysterious,
not to be overlooked.

Upper Kunlun is the place for refining the yang spirit,
the realm of longevity and distant death—
this is what all know.
Yet there is more:
Middle Kunlun, hidden within the body,
is a realm of utmost purity and emptiness.
Qi and spirit merge,
blending into oneness,
as if entering a boundless void.
Though the body contains the Three Passes—upper, middle, and lower—
here, no such divisions exist.
The One True shines alone,
all phenomena are void,
transcending all extremes,
attaining the towering realm.
As Master Zhang Sanfeng’s *Daoist Song* says:
*“The idle True Man hides within,
the Master sits atop Kunlun.”*
Here, one beholds the precelestial, immortal yang spirit,
free from the postcelestial, karmic yin spirit—
hence *“Between the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—
if you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.”*

Those who recite the *Yellow Court Classic*
must focus on the words *“between.”*

There is also Lower Kunlun,
the source of firing the elixir—
all should know this.

Those who cultivate Kunlun
must concentrate their spirit between the Three Passes.
Here lies the purest essence,
the most refined qi.
When spirit enters this realm,
it is profound, vast, and boundless,
utterly empty—
the heart is perfectly clear yet free from thoughts.
In an instant, one transcends to the highest vehicle.

Ordinary people, upon seeing “Kunlun,”
say the secret lies in the Mud Pill Palace.
Had it not been for the repeated guidance of my masters Wushan and Baohe,
who would have known to direct their attention
between the Three Passes?

---

**Chapter Seven**
The Crimson Palace’s twelve-tiered tower,
within its halls, the five hues gather.
The Red Spirit’s Child stands in the Central Pool,
below lies the Long Wall and the Dark Valley’s town.

The essential wonder of longevity is received in the chamber.
The Crimson Palace lies beneath the tower.
When the medicine enters the Crimson Palace,
it must first descend the lung’s twelve-tiered tower.

*“Within its halls”* refers to the Yellow Court.
Pursuing the two qi along the Yellow Path,
uniting the three natures in the Yellow Court,
the five qi return to their origin,
all beauties assemble—
hence *“the five hues gather.”*

The *Red Spirit’s Child* is true intent.
Born from the heart, it is called the Red Spirit’s Child.
The *Central Pool* is the Primordial Sea.
When the five hues gather,
true earth seizes true lead,
true lead restrains true mercury,
stabilized and unmoving,
spirit and qi congeal—
hence *“stands.”*

Below the Central Pool lies the Long Wall—
the Golden Dike.
There is also the Dark Valley—
the Water Realm.
The town within is where cultivators receive their sustenance,
like a human city with walls enclosing it,
moats surrounding it—
a place of utmost security.

The essential wonder of longevity
is obtained from the chamber.
Daoists call it the *life-extending technique*,
akin to the union of man and woman,
yet not the art of sexual combat—
merely the mutual resonance of spirit and qi,
the merging of metal and wood.

---

**Chapter Eight**
Abandon lust and desire, focus on your essence;
the inch-field and foot-dwelling can sustain life.
Tethered to the long flow, the heart finds peace,
observing the will, the spirit roams—threefold numinosity.
At leisure, without affairs, the heart is at great peace.

The first line urges one to renounce lust
and secure essence by guarding against desire.
The *inch-field* is the Gate of Life.
The *foot-dwelling* is the spirit’s abode.
The *Inner Radiance* says:
*“Square and round, an inch within the Gate of Life.”*
This text says:
*“Measured horizontally, its length does not exceed a foot,
binding the inner spirit above.”*
This is the place to nurture oneself and preserve the heart—
the common folk mistake it for the face, but this is wrong.

If the heart is not at peace,
it is due to outward distraction and restless wandering.
Thus, one must tether it within to calm the heart.
*“Observing the will”* means closing off and inwardly gazing
to uphold one’s resolve.
*“The spirit roams”* means the True Man sinks into the deep abyss,
floating and guarding the compass’s center,
with the bearing of one swimming in self-contentment.

At this moment, essence, qi, and spirit unite as one, undivided—hence called the Three Wondrous Numinous. Leisurely and at ease, without affairs or action, the heart’s realm attains supreme peace.

**Chapter Nine**
Constantly preserve the Jade Chamber so spirit achieves clarity,
Timely contemplate the Great Granary to avoid hunger and thirst.
Command the Six Ding spirit-maidens to attend,
Seal the path of essence—thus may one live long.

"Constantly preserve the Jade Chamber" means moment by moment abiding in spirit; with eyes closed and inwardly guarded, spirit does not wander outward, growing ever more settled and wise. People know the spirit’s numinosity as clarity, yet do not realize that the spirit’s non-numinosity is true clarity. "Timely contemplate the Great Granary" means regulating and nurturing it with light flavors. The Great Granary is the stomach, where intention-as-earth resides; where intention abides, there too is the Great Granary—one must not cling to the stomach as a physical form. Daoist adepts regard the Mysterious Pass as the Great Granary Cavity, the place of embryonic breathing and abiding breath. The *Inner Radiance* states, *“Square and round, an inch within the Gate of Life.”* My mountain’s teaching holds it as the dwelling of intention—a truly penetrating discourse. When intention-as-earth flourishes, it enables the stomach to digest grains and liquids, transforming food and drink, hence “to avoid hunger and thirst.” The Six Ding spirits are called “maidens” as they are yin spirits. When yang spirit resides within me, I can command the Six Ding, summoning them to attend. Such is the Way of long life—all hinges on sealing the path of essence.

**Chapter Ten**
Within the central chamber, spirit’s dwelling place,
Wash the heart and govern oneself—let no defilement dare intrude.
Survey the five viscera, inspect their order,
The six bowels refined and purified, pristine as silk.
Emptiness and spontaneity are the Dao’s origin.

The "central chamber" is the spirit’s central abode, neither biased nor partial. With the heart cleansed and withdrawn, one diligently cultivates and governs, allowing no impurity to defile it. Thus, inwardly observing the five viscera, each appears as if illuminated by candlelight; the body’s rhythms may all be scrutinized. Thus, inwardly observing, the six bowels are each refined and purified, immaculate as undyed silk, utterly free of filth. The Dao of emptiness and spontaneity has been thus since antiquity. *Gu* means origin.

**Chapter Eleven**
Things possess their nature—affairs need not be burdensome,
Hands folded in repose, non-action brings the body ease.
Embodying emptiness, the heart finds leisure,
Silent and vast, the mouth utters no word.
Cultivating harmony, one stands alone in the True Person’s palace,
Serene and desireless, wandering the garden of virtue.
Pure and fragrant, immaculate, the Jade Maiden abides,
Cultivating virtue and illuminating goodness—this is the Dao’s gate.

Things include yin things and yang things,
Dividing inner and outer within Heaven and Earth.
Here, the term *thing* refers to what lies within.
For those who cultivate inner things, there is a principle of spontaneity—
No need for excess; their affairs are inherently unburdensome.
When the body is at ease, essence remains unmoved;
When the heart is at leisure, spirit is undisturbed;
When the mouth speaks not, qi does not scatter.
One should simply sit upright in non-action,
Embodying emptiness, free of things,
Silent and vast.
Cultivating the Great Harmony, guarding the center, standing alone—
This is called the True Person’s palace.
Serene and desireless within,
Wandering the garden of virtue, the jade sprout glows resplendent.
At this time, purity is untainted, fragrance unstained,
And the Jade Maiden endures.
The Jade Maiden is a metaphor for inner mercury.
*Virtue* is what one receives from Heaven—
Empty, numinous, and unobscured,
Possessing all principles and responding to the myriad things.
Cultivation restores its empty, numinous essence.
*Goodness* is what Heaven bestows upon humanity—
The primal spark,
The root of nature and the stem of the heart.
Illuminating it reveals one’s original truth.
The gate of the Great Dao first teaches one to fulfill their nature—
This lies in cultivating virtue and illuminating goodness.

---

**Chapter Twelve**
Practicing the Dao in leisure, the body dwells alone,
Nurturing nature and life, guarding emptiness and nothingness.
Serene and desireless—what thoughts or cares arise?
Wings fully formed, upright and flourishing,
One attains long life and enduring vision, then takes flight.

*Practicing the Dao* refers to cultivation.
The cultivator, whether in the world or beyond it,
Must move with ease and contentment,
Guarding their body and dwelling alone.
Within the body lie nature and life—
One must daily uphold and nurture them.
First refine jade to illuminate nature,
Then refine gold to establish life—
The essential secret lies in inwardly guarding emptiness and nothingness.
Born between Heaven and Earth,
Humans are beset by thoughts and cares.
If one guards emptiness and nothingness,
They become serene and desireless,
Acting without action—what thoughts or cares remain?
The immortals refine qi to forge wings;
When spirit is complete and qi is full,
The wings are formed.
*Upright and flourishing* describes the flourishing of spirit and qi.
From this, nature is preserved within,
The body is fortified without,
One may appear or vanish in the world,
Attaining long life and enduring vision.
Weary of the dusty realm,
They shed their shell and take flight.

---

**Chapter Thirteen**
The Five Phases interweave, sharing a common root and node,
Three and five unite—essence lies in their oneness.
Who shares this with the Dipper and Sun-Moon?
Embracing the pearl, cherishing the jade, harmonizing the Chamber of the Child.
If you can guard the One, all affairs are complete;
It is yours to hold—do not lose it.
If you wish not to die, conceal it in the golden chamber.

*Interweaving* refers to their intricate interplay.
In the Five Phases’ sequence,
Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth generate and nourish one another.
In their interweaving,
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth restrain and regulate each other.
Between them, Wood descends and Metal ascends,
Water presides and Fire serves—
Their functions cannot be equalized,
Thus the Five Phases interweave.
Yet when their qi converges,
They share a common root and node.
Three and five unite—
Their sum is eight,
Dividing yin and yang,
Fitting the return after seven days.
Tracing their origin,
They arise from the void, generating the One qi.
This One qi produces yin and yang—
Thus their essence lies in oneness.
This One qi is nurtured in emptiness.
*Who shares this?* The Northern Dipper and the Two Luminaries.
The Dipper’s handle and scoop move with the stars to mark time,
The Sun of Li and Moon of Kan—
Water and Fire dwell in the same palace, refining together.
I merely embrace the bright pearl,
Cherish the fine jade,
And cultivate harmony in the Chamber of the Child.
The Chamber of the Child is emptiness.
If you can guard the One qi of emptiness,
Awaiting its arrival to seize it,
Then nature and life are yours—
All affairs are complete.
The One is a thing you inherently possess—
Simply hold it firmly and do not lose it.
Lose it, and you die;
Retain it, and you do not die.
If you wish not to die,
You must conceal this One within the golden chamber,
Never parting from it—
Thus the Great Elixir is accomplished.

**Chapter Fourteen**
Emerging with the sun, entering with the moon—this is my Dao,
Heaven’s seven and Earth’s two guard together.
Ascending and descending, advancing and retreating—one unites with nine,
Jade and stone gleaming—this is my treasure.
You possess it yourself—why not guard it?

The heart understands the root and stem, nurturing radiant splendor,
Serving Heaven and following Earth, concealing the sea of essence.
Within seven days, they return and unite,
The nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.

*Emerging with the sun, entering with the moon* describes the path of yang departing and yin arriving—
Thus it is my Dao.
*Heaven’s seven* is the fire’s completion number.
Fire completes in Heaven, descending from above—
The hexagram *Wei Ji* (Before Completion).
*Earth’s two* is the fire’s generating number,
Fire arises from Earth, ascending from below—
The hexagram *Ji Ji* (After Completion).
These two hexagrams guard one another—
This is the work of Metal and Water.
*Ascending and descending, advancing and retreating* refer to above and below.
*One unites with nine*—Metal and Water must not part.
Advancing, Water’s Metal ascends;
Retreating, Metal’s Water descends—
This is the wonder of augmentation and reduction.
*Jade and stone gleaming* compares the golden liquid,
Droplet by droplet, like eggs or pills,
Descending the throat—
The supreme treasure of my body.
The Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is inherent in everyone—
Having attained it, how could one not guard it?
The work of guarding it is to deepen the root and firm the stem.
Those who understand this Dao know no method more wondrous than the heart.
When the heart comprehends the root and stem,
It nurtures the Returned Elixir with Metal and Water—
Glowing brilliantly, gradually producing radiant splendor.
This method requires only serving Qian Heaven,
Following Kun Earth,
Acting in accord with Heaven’s timing,
And concealing the sea of essence.
Within seven days, they return and unite,
The nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.

The Sea of Essence is the Primordial Sea. Within the seven days of returning and uniting, the revolving celestial cycle rises into the inner courtyard, merging with the elixir already conjoined within me. It is nurtured in the Central Kunlun and harmonized in the Upper Kunlun, where emptiness becomes clarity and the original nature shines with perfect brightness. Thus it is said, "The nature of Kunlun remains unconfused."

**Chapter Fifteen**
How towering stands the Mountain of Nine Springs!
Within it dwells a true person who may be summoned.
Shielded by the Crimson Palace and the Elixir City Tower,
Flanked by the sun and moon like luminous pearls.
For ten thousand years, its radiance shines without end—
Externally, the Three Yang substances arrive of themselves;
Internally, nurturing the Three Spirits grants longevity.
When the hun-soul longs for heaven and the po-soul sinks into the abyss,
To return the hun and restore the po is the Dao’s natural way,
That one may form the pearl and secure the numinous root.

The Nine Springs are the Nine Liquid Sources spoken of in the *Inner Landscape*. Nine is Metal; the source is Water. The preceding text spoke of the function of Metal and Water; this chapter speaks of their root. The Nine Springs lie within the Lower Kunlun, hence "the Mountain of Nine Springs." *Tingting* describes the mountain’s height. Within the mountain dwells a true person, named the Mysterious Dark Youth or Peach Vitality, who may be employed as a servant. "Shielded by the Crimson Palace and the Elixir City Tower, flanked by the sun and moon like luminous pearls" describes the strictness of its protection. When protection is strict, the inner fire remains pure, and the immortal Dao may be attained. "For ten thousand years, its radiance shines"—enduring brightness and prolonged vision cannot be measured by any fixed term. This is the joy of the Great Return.

When one first refines the elixir within and establishes the crucible without, Qian’s Three Yang and Kun’s Three Yin are inverted, host and guest intermingled. When Qian enters Kun, the Three Yang lie externally, and in an instant, the primordial single entity arrives of itself, unbidden—this is called "lead within water." With lead, one restrains mercury; from without, one returns within, gathering essence to nurture spirit, using the Three Yang to replenish the Three Yin, restoring the Qian body and thereby achieving longevity. The Three Spirits are the Three Yin. To nurture the Three Spirits internally is to subdue the outer elixir with the inner elixir. Once the inner elixir is subdued, clarity and stability prevail, and one may attain long life. Those who do not attain long life, at the moment of death, find their hun-soul longing for heaven and their po-soul sinking into the abyss—hun and po estranged, lead and mercury each following their own path. To return the hun and restore the po is to draw the hun downward when it seeks to ascend and raise the po upward when it seeks to descend, so that hun and po constrain one another. As the *Awakening to Reality* says, "The earthly po seizes the cinnabar mercury; the celestial hun restrains the watery metal." This is the natural affair of the Great Dao. When elixir refinement reaches this point, one may nearly have formed the luminous pearl, forever securing the wondrous root and becoming an immortal.

Chapter Sixteen

The revolving pivot suspends the pearl in endless gyre,
Jade key and golden key seal the body whole and firm.
Borne by earth, it revolves through heaven, circling Qian and Kun,
Its image the four seasons, red as cinnabar bright.

Before high, behind low—each a different gate,
One sends forth the returning elixir, the other the mysterious spring.
The tortoise draws qi to the numinous root.

The revolving pivot: when advancing the Yang fire, the pivot revolves upward.
The suspended pearl: when withdrawing the Yin tally, the pearl jade descends.
These two, like a ring without end.

When they enter within, the Yang elixir and Yin elixir congeal in union,
Jade key and golden key seal and secure the original body, whole and firm.
Borne by earth: the Yellow Court’s Kun earth.
Revolving through heaven: the white fluid’s Qian metal.
Within one celestial cycle, the wonders of Qian and Kun’s Yin and Yang are exhausted.
Its bathing at Mao and You, its waxing and waning, its generation and completion,
Again mirror the division of the four seasons.
As the four seasons proceed, with the blossoms and fruits of the four seasons,
In the tenth month, frost flies, leaves yellow, and fruit ripens—
Its redness like cinnabar—this is why returning to the root and reverting to the origin is called "elixir."

The place where the elixir is nurtured: before high, behind low.
Before, the Ren vessel ends at the lower abdomen—its image high;
Behind, the Du vessel begins at the tailbone—its form low.
One high, one low—these are the gates for the Golden Elixir’s exit and entry.
Their comings and goings differ: the outward journey sends forth, the inward journey returns.
When the returning elixir is in hand, it is entrusted to the mysterious spring.
The mysterious spring is the deep abyss within the void.
Vulgar explanations take it as the sublingual spring—this is exoteric speech.
The closing line says, "The tortoise draws qi to the numinous root."
If it were not deep, how could it be called the numinous root?

---

Chapter Seventeen

Within is a true person, head wrapped in golden cloth,
Bearing armor and holding talismans, opening the seven gates.
This is no branch or leaf—it is the very root.
Day and night, ponder it, and you may long endure.

"Within" refers to the midst of the deep abyss, not within the fleshly heart.
The seven gates correspond to the seven orifices.
The fleshly heart has seven orifices; the numinous heart also has seven orifices.
This may be compared with chapter twenty-eight of the *Inner Landscape*.

---

Chapter Eighteen

Immortal and Daoist are not possessed of spirits—
They accumulate essence and amass qi to become true.
All people eat grains and the five flavors,
Yet they alone consume the Great Harmony’s Yin-Yang qi.
Thus they do not die, and their heavenly phase is exhausted.

The qi of Great Harmony is that which Yin and Yang unite to form.
"Exhausted" means "fully realized."
To be exhausted with heaven is truly to be without exhaustion.

---

Chapter Nineteen

Let me speak of the five viscera, each with its direction:
The heart is the lord of the state, king of the five viscera.
When intent moves or rests, qi accompanies it—
The Dao naturally guards my spirit’s luminous light.
It connects my flowery essence to harmonize Yin and Yang,
All day radiant, at night self-guarding.
Thirst is quenched, hunger sated of itself,
Passing through the six bowels, stored at Mao and You.
Turning Yang into Yin, hidden within the nine,
If one can practice this with care, one will never grow old.

The five viscera take the heart as their ruler; the person takes the body as their state—
Thus the heart is called the king.
Intent arises from the true heart: at rest, it depends on qi; in motion, it assists qi.
These two are one, hence it is said they "accompany" it.
To attain true intent, the Dao lies in guarding the spirit’s luminosity.
If one can guard the spirit’s luminosity, one can generate true intent,
Connect one’s flowery essence, and harmonize Yin and Yang.
Flowery essence is true lead.
When lead and mercury unite, Yin and Yang harmonize.
From this, at dawn one practices *zhun*, at dusk *meng*;
By day, radiant and advancing fire; by night, silent and advancing the tally.
Withdrawing metal and adding water, thirst is quenched and hunger sated.
"Passing through the six bowels" means primordial qi fills the entire body,
Storing the elixir at the Mao and You gates.
To store is to turn Yang into Yin, like the hidden dragon concealed in the first nine—
All is the work of intent’s movement and rest.
If one can practice this with care, one will never grow old.

Chapter Twenty

The qi of the liver is supple and long,
Arraying the five viscera to generate the three luminaries.
Above, it joins the three burners; below, the jade nectar.
My spirit, hun-soul, and po-soul reside at the center.
Essential fluids flow like springs, transforming foulness into fragrance,
Standing at the suspended hall, embracing the Hall of Light.
Thunder and lightning, claps and bolts, follow one another—
Left Mao, right You—these are my treasures.
Hidden at the mysterious gate, awaiting the heavenly Dao,
Near to my body, yet guarding itself.
In purity and non-action, the spirit lingers and abides,
Essence and spirit ascend and descend, each in its proper place.
The heavenly Dao is unobstructed, the herb of long life grows—
The seven orifices are opened, and one never grows old.
Sitting at the Gate of Heaven, awaiting Yin and Yang,
Descending through the throat to connect with the spirit’s luminosity.
Passing beneath the flowery canopy, cool and clear,
Entering the icy abyss, one sees one’s own form.
When the returning elixir is complete, one may long endure.
Below is the flowery pond, stirring the kidney’s essence.
Standing at the Hall of Light, facing the cinnabar field,
It commands the various spirits to open the Gate of Life.
The heavenly Dao is unobstructed, reaching the numinous root—
Yin and Yang arrayed like streaming stars.

(One version ends with "The liver’s qi circulates without end," which seems to capture the essence of this chapter. Perhaps a later commentator’s note, these seven characters were mistakenly incorporated into the text and are preserved here.)

The liver’s qi is expansive and flowing, abundant and vigorous—
Truly able to shelter the entire body.
Earlier it spoke of the six bowels; here, the five viscera—
Both viscera and bowels are moistened by the wood’s fluid.
Arraying the five viscera, each viscus supports the others,
Joining the three burners and descending jade nectar,
Then uniting with the primordial qi to circulate without cease.
The liver stores the hun-soul; here, it speaks of my heart-spirit and lung-po,
All gathering in the central yellow palace.
Wood generates essential fluids, transforming them into flowing springs,
Which can wash away foulness and impart their pure fragrance.
"Standing at the suspended hall" means the fluids hesitate to descend,
Their qi already embracing the Hall of Light.
In an instant, the flowing spring surges forth,
Irrigating the three palaces; in the stomach, sounds like thunder and lightning—
Then it settles in the Hall of Light, following one another,
Descending to the Crimson Palace and returning to the primordial sea.

Here at the Gate of Mao and You, when turning left the qi emerges, when turning right the fluids enter—this is the supreme treasure of my body. Between Xu and Hai, it lies concealed at the Mysterious Gate, awaiting the revolutions of the Great Dao.

Men speak of the celestial Dao as distant; I say the celestial Dao is near. The cycles of the celestial degrees reside within my body—one must simply guard its principles. Through purity and non-action, the inner spirits abide; essence and spirit separate and order themselves above and below. Coming and going, they dredge the joints, opening the great Dao of the entire body—this is the immortal herb of longevity. Through diligent irrigation, the mind-ground becomes clear and bright; the seven apertures open, and aging is forever unknown.

This great fortune relies entirely on the two qi of yin and yang. The qi ascending above the Celestial Gate is "pure"; the qi descending below the Celestial Gate is "mysterious." As the *Inner Landscape* states: "Emerging pure, entering mysterious—these two qi shine forth." Thus, one must concentrate the spirit and still the breath, returning to sit at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the separation of yin and yang. When the pure ascends and the mysterious descends, then the cold spring drips drop by drop, flowing down the throat to connect with the divine luminosity. Passing through the floral canopy, it is clear and cool; entering the deep abyss, it is crystalline and cold. It washes the heart and purifies thoughts, revealing my true form—serene and desireless. This is called the Returned Elixir. Once the Returned Elixir is achieved, one may attain longevity.

Before the Golden Elixir returns, below lies the Floral Pool, called the Sea of Qi. The essence within the kidneys stirs here; I stand in the Hall of Light to observe it, illuminating the Cinnabar Field. This is the Office of the General, governing plans and deliberations. The General’s intent is to command all spirits to open the Life Gate, dredging the celestial Dao to reach the numinous root. Then yin and yang array themselves swiftly as shooting stars.

**Chapter Twenty-One**
The lungs govern the qi; the Triple Burner arises,
Concealed at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the old path.
The pure fluid, sweet spring, flows through the six viscera,
Following the nose up and down, known to both ears.
Gazing inward at heaven and earth, the Youth is preserved;
Harmonizing essence and brilliance, teeth and hair are moistened.
The complexion glows, radiant without medicine,
As the fluid descends the throat—how freely it falls!
All spirits gather, seeking one another;
Below, in the Crimson Palace, purple blossoms unfold.
Hidden beneath the floral canopy, it connects to the divine hut,
Focusing the heart-spirit, calling to one another.
Observing my divine luminosity, it repels all evil,
The spleen-spirit returns to its great home.
Reaching the stomach’s passage, it connects to emptiness,
Nurturing the numinous root, never to wither again.
Sealing the Life Gate like a jade capital,
Longevity extends ten thousand years and more.

The opening line refers to the internal commentary. To cultivate the lung qi, one must first lie concealed at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the old path of ingress and egress. When qi transforms into water, the pure fluid, sweet spring, irrigates the six viscera. This qi, following the nose up and down, bridges the magpie bridge—above as qi, below as fluid. The sound of flowing springs is heard in the void, known to the two ears. Through the work of inner illumination, one gazes at the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, preserving the White Prime Youth to assist the six qi. Harmonizing the essence of the entire body, it moistens teeth and hair, brightens the complexion, and eliminates the need for medicine. The fluid descends the throat like scattered rain; all spirits seek it, and each viscus partakes of its sweetness. Below lies the Crimson Palace, where purple blossoms unfold along the trickling stream. Hidden beneath the floral canopy, it connects to the divine hut. Heart and spirit are two yet one. By focusing the heart-spirit, one ensures the heart calls to the spirit, the spirit calls to the heart—now in the heart, now in the spleen—ever luminous, never dim. Observing my divine luminosity, it truly repels all evil influences. In the spleen, the spleen-spirit returns as if home, always abiding there. Reaching the passage of the stomach, it connects to the realm of emptiness, nurturing the numinous root so it never withers again. All this is the cultivation of lung qi. Yet in this nurturing, one must seal the Life Gate, pure as a jade capital, untouched by dust, all thoughts stilled. Thus the numinous root is fortified, and longevity extends ten thousand years with abundance.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
The spirit within the spleen governs the center,
Summoning the five spirits to harmonize the Three Lights.
Above, it joins the Celestial Gate and meets the Hall of Light,
Dredging the six viscera and regulating the Five Phases.
Metal, wood, water, fire, earth reign as kings;
Sun, moon, and constellations array yin and yang.
Dredging the blood vessels, sweat becomes nectar;
Cultivating the seven apertures dispels misfortune.
The two spirits unite to descend jade blossoms,
Receiving primordial qi, the years grow ever longer.

The spleen belongs to earth, so its spirit presides over the center. "Summoning the five spirits" means gathering the Five Phases; "harmonizing the Three Lights" refers to the revolutions of the Dipper, sun, and moon.

**Continuation of Chapter Twenty-Two**
The phrase *"Above, it joins the Celestial Gate and meets the Hall of Light"* distills the wondrous workings of the preceding two chapters. The Mysterious Gate awaits the Dao of Heaven—this is the spirit of the spleen. The Celestial Gate awaits yin and yang—this, too, is the spirit of the spleen. The Celestial Gate awaits the ancient Way—still, it is the spirit of the spleen. *"Meeting the Hall of Light"* refers not to the Hall of Light between the brows nor the Crimson Palace, but to the central void of nonbeing. *"Dredging the six viscera and regulating the Five Phases"*—among metal, wood, water, and fire, earth reigns as king. The sun, moon, and constellations harbor yin and yang within; who divides them? The spleen’s spirit governs their unfolding. *"Dredging the blood vessels, sweat becomes nectar"* and *"cultivating the seven apertures to dispel misfortune"*—all depend on the spleen’s spirit establishing the center, for intention arises from the heart. The *"two spirits"* are the spleen’s spirit and the heart’s spirit. *"Uniting"* means the two become one. *"Descending jade blossoms"* signifies jade liquid irrigating the heart, as earth also generates the yellow sprout. *"Receiving primordial qi"* means using qi to nourish spirit, for spirit relies on qi; when qi is full, spirit is complete, and the years grow ever longer.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Among the five viscera, the kidneys hold the highest rank,
Concealed in the Great Yin, they safeguard their truth.
Exiting and entering through the two apertures, they merge with the Yellow Court,
Inhaling and exhaling the void, my form becomes visible.
They strengthen my sinews and bones, enriching blood and vessels,
In the indistinct and imperceptible, I transcend to pure numinosity.
Seated within the hut, I observe the youth,
With inner breath and focused thought, the light of spirit shines.
Emerging from the Celestial Gate, I enter the boundless,
Serene and desireless, I nurture the root of radiance.
Ingesting primordial qi grants longevity,
Returning to the Seven Gates, I drink from the Great Abyss.
Passing through the Mysterious Throat, I traverse pure numinosity,
Seated within the hut, I behold the youth.
He asks me of the immortal Dao and wondrous methods—
I tell him to consume the purple blossoms of the magic mushroom,
To wear white silk upon his head, his feet planted at the Cinnabar Field,
To bathe in the Flowery Pond and irrigate the numinous root.
When the five viscera harmonize, the Gate of Life opens,
The five flavors all arrive, and good qi returns.
Practicing this with unbound hair ensures enduring existence.

*The Outer Radiance* concludes the five viscera with the kidneys, returning all to the One. The One is water, governed by the kidneys, so among the five viscera, the kidneys hold the highest rank. The Great Yin belongs to the lungs; *"concealed in the Great Yin"* means true metal generates true water, and true water conceals true metal. *"Exiting and entering through the two apertures"* refers to the gates of Qian and Kun, the doors of yin and yang—one metal, one water, one going forth, one returning. Their center is called the Yellow Court, the place where metal and water are stored and where exit and entry converge. The center is emptiness; emptiness is nonbeing. Guarding the center in breath, one takes the space between heaven and earth as a bellows, vibrant and fluid, vast and boundless, subtle and continuous, merging into a single whole—round and luminous, with qi and spirit full, so that one’s true form becomes visible. Thereafter, the sinews and bones grow strong, the blood and vessels flourish, and in the indistinct and imperceptible, one’s form vanishes, soaring beyond the realm of pure numinosity to ascend to the Central Elixir. This is the hut of spirit’s light. Seated beneath it, one observes a youth whose appearance mirrors one’s own—yet pay him no mind. Simply guard the inner breath, focus the thought, and the celestial light of wisdom will shine forth, the spirit growing ever brighter. From there, move the spirit to the Upper Elixir, emerging above the Celestial Gate to commune with the single qi of heaven and earth, vast and boundless, clear and empty—this is me yet not me, this is emptiness yet not emptiness. In harmony with the Dao, one enters the boundless, serene and desireless, nurturing the root of radiance. The root of radiance is the immortal seed; immortals abstain from grain, ingesting only the qi of the Mysterious Gate to attain undying longevity. Yet those who consume primordial qi must also guide the spirit inward, returning to the Seven Gates to drink daily from the Great Abyss. In returning, one takes the path of the Mysterious Throat, passing through pure numinosity to sit once more within the hut, where the youth appears again, asking of the immortal Dao and its wondrous methods. I tell him: there is no other wonder. Simply consume the purple blossoms of the magic mushroom, wear white silk upon your head, plant your feet at the Cinnabar Field, bathe in the Flowery Pond, and irrigate the numinous root. When the five viscera harmonize and a single qi surges in harmony, the Gate of Life opens, the elixir light emerges from the crucible, the five flavors all arrive, and good qi returns to the body. Practicing this with unbound hair—obtaining the medicine, laying the foundation, refining the self, returning the elixir, ascending to the origin, returning to the root, illuminating goodness, and reverting to the beginning—all lies within these few words. This is the immortal Dao and its wondrous method, ensuring enduring existence.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
The great Dao flows boundlessly—let not the heart grow tangled.
My words are complete; do not recklessly expound them.

Here, Laozi concludes his scripture with two closing exhortations: All that has been spoken above is the great Dao—vast and unobstructed, utterly upright, without crooked paths or deviant byways. Those who practice it must not let their hearts become entangled in complexity and stray onto divergent paths. My words are complete; do not recklessly expound them to the unworthy, lest you bring calamity upon yourself. Treasure and remember them.

**Explanation of the *Classic of Purity***
Laozi said: The great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth.
The Limitless generates the Supreme Ultimate.
The great Dao is passionless, revolving the sun and moon.
It is non-doing, yet nothing is left undone.
The great Dao is nameless, nurturing the myriad things.
Nonbeing gives birth to being.
I know not its name, so I forcefully call it *"Dao."*
The character for *"Dao"* is formed by combining *"head"* and *"walk"*—it moves and generates prior to heaven and earth. Though called a forced name, it is nonetheless natural.
The Dao possesses purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.
Without pure heaven and turbid earth, there would be no heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness.
Man is pure, woman turbid; man is active, woman still.
Descending from the root, flowing to the branches, the myriad things are born.
Purity and movement are the root; turbidity and stillness are the branches.
One descends, one flows, one bestows, one receives.
When purity and turbidity merge, movement and stillness unite in marriage, the myriad things flourish therefrom.

Purity is the source of turbidity. Nonbeing gives rise to being.
Movement is the foundation of stillness. Being returns to nonbeing.
If one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return to it.
Heaven is pure, earth is still—together they revert entirely to nonbeing.

Now, the spirit of man delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it.
The heart that disturbs the spirit is the deluded heart.
The human heart delights in stillness, yet desires drag it away.
To attain the heart that delights in stillness, one must first relinquish affairs.
To still the heart, one must first dispel desires.
When the heart is settled, the spirit becomes clear of itself.
To settle the heart is to wash it and withdraw it into concealment.
When the heart is like still water, the spirit becomes clear of itself.
Naturally, the six desires do not arise;
without eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind,
there are no forms, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, or dharmas.
The three poisons are extinguished.
The three poisons are: the yin spirit that harms human nature,
the yin essence that harms human life,
and the yin qi that assaults the five viscera—these are the three corpses.
The three corpses are the yin bandits within the human body.
Those who speak of the "three Pengs" or "three Gu" are deluded.
The reason one cannot succeed is that the heart is not settled and desires are not dispelled.
The spirit cannot become clear because desires have not been dispelled.
One who can dispel them inwardly observes the heart, yet the heart is no-heart.
One knows that the three minds cannot be grasped.
Outwardly, one observes form, yet form is no-form.
From afar, one observes things, yet things are no-things.
One knows that the four marks are all forgotten.
When these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.
Reflecting back, one enters emptiness.
Observing emptiness, even emptiness is empty.
When observing emptiness reaches the place of no-where,
emptiness becomes vast.
If there is something, it does not become emptiness.
When what is emptied is already nothing, even nothingness is nothing.
After observing emptiness reaches the state of no-where,
even emptiness is no more.
If there is emptiness, it cannot be without something.
Nothingness upon nothingness—even nothingness does not stand.
When nothingness upon nothingness is no more,
there is profound and constant stillness.
All dharmas are empty.
Stillness without anything to still—how can desires arise?
Stillness upon stillness—what worry, what thought?
When desires do not arise, this is true stillness.
This is why stillness must first dispel desires.

True constancy responds to things; true constancy abides.
When true stillness is constant, it is called true constancy.
My master said:
*"True constancy can respond to things,
responding to things without delusion,
without delusion, one’s nature naturally abides."*
This expresses the same meaning.
Constant response, constant stillness—this is constant purity and stillness.
The *Ding Guan* states:
*"Whether in affairs or not, always as if without mind.
Whether in stillness or clamor, one’s resolve remains single."*
Through such purity and stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao.
Having entered the true Dao, it is called attaining the Dao.
When the deluded heart is absent, the true heart is present.
Though called attaining the Dao, in reality there is nothing attained.
It is used with emptiness, never self-satisfied or pretentious.
For the sake of transforming sentient beings, it is called attaining the Dao.
Abandoning delusion and returning to truth—this may be called a Daoist.
One who can awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao.
When the work of nature is awakened, the work of life is transmitted.

Someone asked:
*"Above it is said there is nothing attained, yet here it speaks of transmitting the sagely Dao.
Does this mean the *Qing Jing* scripture has not yet spoken of the Dao?"*
Hanxu replied: Not so. You have misunderstood "nothing attained."
This is entering the Dao and reflecting back—it is the wondrous secret of original nature.
Lao Jun said:
*"The heart is long, the words are weighty—thus I expound again."*

The superior person engages in no contention; the inferior person delights in contention.
The highest virtue does not assert virtue; the lesser virtue clings to virtue.
Those who cling are not called possessors of the Dao and virtue.
Without contention, there are no desires.
With contention, desires multiply.
Not asserting virtue—this is true virtue.
Clinging to virtue—this is no virtue at all.
Without perfect virtue, the perfect Dao does not coalesce.
Those who cling to virtue cannot be expansive—how then could they embody the vast, numinous, and boundless virtue to unite with my vast, numinous, and boundless Dao?

Sentient beings fail to attain the true Dao because they harbor deluded minds.
With deluded minds, they disturb their spirit.
Disturbing their spirit, they become attached to the myriad things.
Attached to the myriad things, they give rise to craving.
With craving, there is affliction.
Affliction and delusion torment body and mind,
leading to defilement and disgrace, drifting through the cycles of birth and death.
Ever submerged in the sea of suffering, they forever lose the true Dao.
This passage employs reverse exposition to reinforce the meaning of entering the true Dao through purity and stillness.

Yet what is lamentable is this: with restless, deluded minds, they agitate the utterly pure true spirit.
Attached to things and lost in delusion, the heart cannot be still—
the true spirit is instead transformed into a deluded mind.
How then could they attain the Dao?

The ever-true Dao is attained through awakening.
Those who awaken to the Dao abide in constant purity and stillness.
The awakened never depart from purity and stillness.
The method of purity and stillness never departs from dispelling desire.
Dispelling desire is the crucial point of this chapter.
Moreover, when the heart is still, fire descends; when the spirit is clear, qi becomes wise.
Wisdom arises in samadhi, and the original destiny naturally returns.
There is also that which arises spontaneously, beyond knowing how or why.

*Commentary on the Jade Pivot Scripture*
Annotations by Xuanyi Hanxuzi

Dwelling at the center and revolving—this is called the *pivot*. The first star of the Northern Dipper is named *Celestial Pivot*, for it revolves from the center. In the human body, the spirit serves as the pivot; when not a speck of dust clings to it, it is as luminously pure as jade—hence the name *Jade Pivot*. The great purport of this scripture is to teach people to refine the primordial spirit.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “You, all gods and humans, wish to hear the supreme Dao. The supreme Dao is profoundly subtle, not to be found elsewhere. Since you wish to hear it, the one who does not hear is the one. Without hearing, without seeing—this is the true Dao. Even hearing and seeing must be dissolved; only you remain, yet you are not a thing, how much less so this?”

Clear as ice and bright as snow, no further explanation is needed. The word *this* refers to hearing, seeing, and speech.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The Dao is entered through sincerity, preserved through silence, and employed through softness. Employing sincerity appears as foolishness; employing silence appears as inarticulateness; employing softness appears as clumsiness. Thus one may forget form, may forget even forgetting. All these are the workings within emptiness and nothingness.

Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who preserve the Dao know how to be reverent; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom-light arises; knowing reverence, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, great stability and peace are attained. With great stability and peace, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, wisdom-light arises; with wisdom-light arising, one becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting.

Only in forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten, does the supreme Dao reside. The Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know it. Sentient and insentient beings are ultimately one and without duality.”

To enter, one must be able to preserve; to preserve, one must be able to employ. Knowing when to stop, one does not stray; knowing reverence, one does not deviate; knowing subtlety, one deeply enters the profound and obscure. From the profound and obscure arises the indistinct and vague, where numinous awareness attaches—this is wisdom-light. Not deviating, the spirit is tranquil; not straying, qi is still. When qi is still, the spirit is tranquil; when the spirit is tranquil, within the Great Void a single spirit moves alone, knowing only the Dao and nothing else—thus it is said: “This is called true forgetting.” True forgetting is forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten. True forgetting is the supreme Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “In this present world, how shall I benefit living beings? For all gods and humans, I expound this wondrous treasure. Those who awaken to it shall ascend to the immortal’s throne.

Disciples of the Dao, know that there is *qi* and *number*. As wind and earth differ, so too do endowments naturally vary—hence it is called *qi*. As wisdom and foolishness differ, so too do purity and turbidity naturally vary—hence it is called *number*. Number is tied to destiny; qi is tied to heaven. Constrained by qi and number, destiny is bound (bound, as in fettered), and the true Dao cannot be attained. Foolishness may become wisdom; turbidity may become purity—only destiny decrees it. Foolishness is dim; turbidity is dark—these too are shaped by the endowments of wind and earth, which shift and transform.

Heaven and earth move their mechanism, causing people not to know—this is called *spontaneity*. Even when one knows that one does not know, it is still called *spontaneity*. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowing, arises precisely from not knowing. Yet in relation to the Dao, it has never begun with foolishness or turbidity.”

All gods heard this, and the four assemblies rejoiced.

*Summary of the Scripture on Protecting Life*

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning was within the Fivefold-Luminous Palace of the Seven-Jewel Grove, together with the boundless assembly of sages, radiating boundless light that illuminated the boundless worlds. He beheld the boundless sentient beings enduring boundless suffering, tossed and turned in the world, revolving through birth and death, adrift in the river of love, blown about in the sea of desire, sunk in the mire of sound and form, deluded by existence and non-existence. There is no emptiness, yet emptiness; no form, yet form; no non-existence, yet non-existence. There is existence, yet no existence. From beginning to end, all is dark and obscure, unable to illumine themselves, utterly lost in delusion.

The beginningless is the ancestral qi. When ancestral qi transforms and engenders, the true spirit is revealed. This spirit resides within the heart of heaven, inside the Yellow Court. When the one spirit is rightly positioned, the ten thousand spirits pay homage. It is not like the boundless sentient beings, who are all but a single stream of consciousness-spirit, enduring endless suffering in the destinies. Those sentient beings are all clinging to delusion. Clinging to emptiness is wrong; clinging to form is wrong; clinging to existence within non-existence is wrong; clinging to non-existence within existence is also wrong. How pitiable indeed!

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “You sentient beings arise from non-existence into existence, from non-nothingness into nothingness, from non-form into form, from non-emptiness into emptiness. Existence is not made existence; nothingness is not made nothingness; form is not made form; emptiness is not made emptiness. Emptiness is just emptiness, yet emptiness has no fixed emptiness. Form is just form, yet form has no fixed form. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. If you can know that emptiness is not emptiness and that form is not form, this is called illumination, the beginning of attaining the wondrous sound. Recognizing the dharma of no-emptiness, perceiving without obstruction, entering the gate of manifold wonders, you will naturally awaken. Free from the net of doubts, not attached to the view of emptiness—this passage breaks through the delusion of emptiness, form, existence, and non-existence for sentient beings. If any sentient being awakens to this, they will be able to leave all delusions behind. Purifying the six senses, cutting off evil obstructions, I shall then expound for you this wondrous scripture, called *Protecting Life*. It delivers and saves sentient beings, spreads the teaching in the world, and circulates through recitation. Then flying heavenly deities, vajra warriors who shatter evil, dharma-protecting spirit youths, deliverers from suffering, golden-eyed fierce beasts—each in hundreds of millions—will all attend and guard this scripture. Wherever it is revered, they will ward off danger, support the weak, and deliver all sentient beings from defilements and attachments.”

This passage emphasizes purity once more. Only by purifying the six senses can one attain this wondrous treasure of *Protecting Life* and leave behind all suffering.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke a gatha:
*“Seeing yet not seeing me,
Hearing yet not hearing me.
Departing from all extremes—
This is called the wondrous Dao.”*

Not seeing me, not hearing me—then there is no self. The self is the harm of all extremes; without self, all extremes are departed. Confucius had no prejudices, no inflexibility, no obstinacy, and thus returned to no-self. For with no-self, prejudices, inflexibility, and obstinacy all cease.

*Summary of the Scripture on Daily Practice*
Daily practice refers to what cannot be departed from even for a moment in the twelve hours. Where there is effort, there will be efficacy—all depends on purifying body and mind. The scripture contains two passages: “In the twelve hours, constantly contemplate purity,” and at the end: “In the twelve hours, constantly maintain purity.” This is the crucial point for the followers of the Most High, hence it is reiterated. In the twelve hours, purity must constantly be cultivated as the foundation of daily practice. The scripture’s language is clear and requires no further annotation.

Respectfully noted by Xiyue of the Mysterious Lineage.

As for daily practice: when eating and drinking, be settled. Seal the mouth, sit upright, and do not arouse a single thought. Forget all things, preserve the spirit, and stabilize the intent. The eyes do not see objects; the ears do not hear sounds. The mind is inwardly guarded, regulating the breath continuously, exhaling gently without interruption, as if present yet absent. Naturally, the heart-fire descends, the kidney-water ascends, saliva is generated in the mouth, and the numinous true essence attaches to the body, attaining the path to longevity.

The first passage speaks of the initial effort: “In the twelve hours, constantly contemplate purity.” Not arousing a single thought is called purity; the numinous terrace being empty of things is called clarity. The body is the dwelling of qi; the mind is the abode of spirit. Where intent moves, spirit moves; where spirit moves, qi scatters. When spirit gathers, the five phases’ true qi coalesces into the elixir pellet, and naturally, within the body there is another body. The harmonious qi penetrates, and the finest essence showers upon the crown. In movement, stillness, sitting, and lying down, one constantly feels the body as if the wind is passing, the abdomen as if thunder is rumbling, the ears hearing the music of immortals without strings. Without speech, there is sound; without striking, there is resonance. Spirit and qi intertwine, the infant revolves. One perceives inner visions, can speak of oneself, sees the affairs of the formless, and dwells with the sages. Spirit moves in and out freely, and one’s lifespan equals heaven and earth, transcending birth and death.

The two lines “In the twelve hours” refer to the time of entering the chamber, when body and mind are pure, and efficacy naturally manifests. All that follows lies within these two lines. Do not allow any harm—“In the twelve hours, constantly maintain purity.” Spirit is the child of qi; qi is the mother of spirit. Like a hen brooding over her eggs, can one preserve spirit and nurture qi without separation? Wondrous! Wondrous!

Within the "twelve hours," these two lines are reiterated, now speaking of the time of nurturing the elixir. Observing the four characters "lest there be harm," one understands.

*Brief Explanation of the* **Great Permeation Sutra** *by Hanxuzi*

"Great Permeation" signifies the meaning of vastness and all-encompassing penetration. Within the *Sutra*, formlessness, bodilessness, imagelessness, signlessness, and non-action—all are boundlessly vast, unimpeded in their penetration.

**Chapter on True Emptiness**
It arises before heaven yet is formless in its arising.
It abides after heaven yet is bodiless in its abiding.
Yet in its bodilessness, it has never truly abided.
Thus it is said: "Inconceivable."
The qi of pre-heaven has no substance; the spirit of post-heaven has no direction.
Yet though spirit has no direction, its transformations operate within direction.
Thus it is said: "It has never truly abided." "Inconceivable"—its wondrous function is inexhaustible.

**Chapter on Profound Principle**
Stillness is its nature, and the heart resides within it.
Activity is the heart, and nature resides within it.
When the heart arises, nature vanishes; when the heart ceases, nature appears.
Like space devoid of images, it is serene and perfectly full.
Stillness is nature, and the heart resides within it.
When all is forgotten, nature is settled, and the heart too is settled.
Activity is the heart, and nature also resides within it.
With solitary awareness, the heart perceives, and nature too is perceived.
The reason ordinary people do not perceive nature is the presence of deluded thoughts.
With deluded thoughts, nature is concealed.
Without deluded thoughts, nature is revealed.
For the substance of nature is fundamentally empty.
Like space devoid of images, the substance of nature is serene.

**Chapter on the Profound and Wondrous**
The Great Dao is signless, thus it inwardly gathers what exists.
True nature is non-active, thus it outwardly does not generate the heart.
It is thus of itself, boundlessly vast.
Confronting circumstances yet forgetting circumstances, it does not sink into the demons of the six thieves.
Dwelling in the dust yet transcending the dust, it does not fall into the transformations of the ten thousand conditions.
Attaining stillness without movement, attaining harmony without change.
Wisdom illumines the ten directions, emptily transforming without action.

*Verse:*
With form, one awakens to formlessness;
Without cultivation, one dissolves cultivation.
It embraces the bodies of the ten thousand images,
Yet clings not to a single thread.

Signless, thus without existence—by inwardly gathering what exists, one returns to the Dao of signlessness.
Non-active, thus without heart—by outwardly not generating the heart, one reverts to the nature of non-action.
Gathering existence to return to non-existence is signlessness; collecting the heart to return to nature is non-action.
Signless and non-active, thus boundlessly vast.
From this, when confronting circumstances and dwelling in the dust, one may seem to perceive signs and action.
Yet without sinking or falling, one still perceives signlessness and non-action.
What concern are the six thieves and ten thousand conditions?
Stillness without movement is concentration; harmony without change is tranquility.
Wisdom illumines and emptily transforms—thus the primordial spirit operates wondrously.
In essence, it is signless and non-active.

*Brief Explanation of the* **Ancient Red Writings of the Cavern**

**Chapter on Holding to the Real**
Movement within movement arises from non-movement.
Action within action arises from non-action.
Movement within movement is yang qi.
It arises from quiescent stillness, thus it is said: "arises from non-movement."
Action within action is returning and restoring.
It is practiced within purity and stillness, thus it is said: "arises from non-action."
In non-action, spirit returns; when spirit returns, the ten thousand things are quiescent.
In non-movement, qi dissolves; when qi dissolves, the ten thousand things are born.
In non-action, spirit returns—for spirit delights in purity.
When spirit returns, things are quiescent—for purity is stillness.
In non-movement, qi dissolves—for qi enters *hai*.
When qi dissolves, things are born—for *hai* becomes *zi*.
Spirit guards spirit; things rely on things—their root returns to the origin.
What guards is non-union in non-union.
What relies is return in return.
Thus, the post-heaven returns to the pre-heaven, and the root is firmly established.
In silence, one awakens; I myself recognize it—entering the seamless.
Silent awakening is the arising of the dim and obscure.
"I myself recognize it" is solitary awareness.
Thus one deeply enters the profound and permeating, without obstruction.
Neither dying nor living, one becomes one with heaven and earth.
The Dao of holding to the real is attained.

**Chapter on Entering Sagehood**
Forgetting the eyes, light overflows boundlessly.
Forgetting the ears, the heart’s knowledge abides in the profound.
When both mechanisms are forgotten, the gate to all wonders is cut off.
When the mechanism of the eyes is still, wisdom-light naturally arises.
When the mechanism of the ears is still, the heart-ground naturally clarifies.
To observe wonders without desire—this is the moment.
Attaining this one wonder, all wonders are cut off in emptiness.
Pure and complete, it accords with the great square.
Vast and boundless, it accords with the measureless.
The greatness of heaven and earth is what I sustain.
The multitude of the ten thousand things is what I uphold.
How can there be an end, to speak of its limitations?
There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.
Vast without directional form, lofty without equal measure.
Heaven and earth, the ten thousand things—all are what I sustain.
Though there be those who speak well, none can fathom its limitations, for it is inexhaustible.
What is finite in the world has limitations to speak of.
The Dao is without end—how can there be limitations to speak of?

**Chapter on Abiding in the World**
Nurture its imagelessness, and images thus endure.
Guard its bodilessness, and the body thus preserves the real.
When the real is fully preserved and mutually aided, one can be long-lasting.
Heaven attains its real and thus is eternal; earth attains its real and thus is enduring; humans attain their real and thus are long-lived.
The reason worldly people cannot be long-lasting is that they lose their imagelessness and scatter their bodilessness, unable to make the nine orifices and hundred bones coexist with the real body—thus they die.
Imagelessness is qi.
Bodilessness is spirit.
When spirit unites with qi, the elixir path is naturally accomplished.
Thus it is said: "When the real is fully preserved and mutually aided, one can be long-lasting."
The following nine sentences are clear and easily understood; annotations are omitted here.

*Brief Explanation of the* **Sutra of Concentrated Contemplation*

Purple Radiance Permeating the Void Master respectfully expounds *Concentrated Contemplation*, which embodies the Buddhist principle of *śamatha-vipaśyanā*. Contemplation here encompasses internal observation, external observation, distant observation, and observation of emptiness. If one can practice concentrated contemplation, the spirit remains unshaken, enabling internal observation of the mindless, external observation of the formless, distant observation of the objectless, and observation of emptiness as emptiness itself.

*The Complete Collection of Daoist Texts* includes annotations by Master Harmonious Simplicity, but his explanations are fragmented and fail to clarify the essential meaning. Here, the exposition follows the original scriptural intent.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: "Left" (zuǒ) means to assist, to aid—one who assists in the mysterious work. As the *Book of Documents* states, "The Duke of Zhou assisted the former kings," where "assist" (zuǒ) is read in the departing tone, meaning "to aid." If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, one must first relinquish worldly affairs. Sever all external matters that conflict with the heart—external matters being those unrelated to body and mind. "Conflict" (wǔ) means opposition, which breeds affliction; thus, one must first abandon and entirely sever such matters to prevent the arising of afflictive thoughts. Only then may one sit in tranquility and inwardly observe the arising of the mind. If even a single thought arises, it must be eradicated to ensure stillness. Here, "thought" refers to those with attachment. As Buddhist scriptures state, one must work at the point where the mind stirs and thoughts arise; thus, they must be removed and extinguished. Even if the thoughts are not explicitly attached but are merely wandering and chaotic, they too must be entirely eradicated. One must practice diligently day and night without the slightest lapse.

"Explicit attachment" refers to the aforementioned "thoughts," such as those for fame and profit. "Wandering and chaotic thoughts" are those without attachment, arising aimlessly, drifting and ceaseless, disordered and inconsequential. "Lapse" means abandonment. One must extinguish the moving mind but not the illuminating mind. One should congeal the empty mind but not fixate the abiding mind. Without relying on any single method, the mind remains constantly settled. "Thought" is the moving mind; "illumination" is the mind of reflexive observation; "emptiness" is the desireless mind; "abiding" is the mind of attachment. "Not relying on any single method" means that all things are empty, yet the mind remains perpetually settled.

However, the mundane mind is restless and competitive. To conclude the above: For beginners, calming the mind is exceedingly difficult. Even if one momentarily succeeds, the mind soon strays again. The struggle between departure and retention causes the entire body to circulate restlessly. Only through prolonged and focused reflection can one achieve mastery. Do not abandon the endeavor of a thousand lifetimes because of a momentary failure to collect the mind. "Calming the mind" is what Buddhists call "pacifying the mind." "Momentarily succeeding but soon straying" is what Confucians describe as "maintaining when present, losing when absent." When lost, it departs; when departed, it is drawn by external conditions. When maintained, it remains; when it remains, it returns to the mind. The interplay of mind and conditions resembles a battle. Following the breath's ebb and flow, it is said: "The hundred parts of the body circulate." To achieve the method of retention, one must ponder the principle of harmonizing the mind. There is nothing that does not proceed from the temporary to the constant; through prolonged and focused reflection, one can achieve mastery. Initially, one may temporarily collect the mind, but subsequently, it abides constantly. The endeavor of a thousand lifetimes refers to the constantly abiding mind mentioned above.

Once one has attained a measure of stillness, then in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down—in all places of engagement and amidst clamor—one must intentionally cultivate calm. Whether occupied or unoccupied, one should remain as if mindless. In quietude or in noise, one's resolve should be singular. "Measure" means "slightly"; "attained" means "ceased." Having slightly attained stillness, one must test it in various conditions to observe whether the mind remains unmoved. Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, quietude, and noise—all are conditions. "Intentionally" means to establish and maintain. The four phrases regarding occupation, non-occupation, movement, and noise all describe intentional effort.

If one binds the mind too tightly, the tension may cause illness. The arising of qi may lead to madness and frenzy—these are its symptoms. The mind tends toward movement, and restraining it too forcefully will result in violent and agitated illness. Qi here refers to the qi within the mind; when the mind moves, qi moves. "Madness" is the symptom of violence; "frenzy" is the symptom of agitation. Madness is minor; violence and agitation are severe. If the mind does not move, one must allow it freedom. When tension and relaxation are balanced, one naturally remains harmoniously adjusted. To restrain without attachment, to release without movement, to remain unperturbed in noise, and to remain unagitated in engagement—this is true concentration. "Balanced" means appropriate. "Naturally harmoniously adjusted" means to be at ease, free, and unhurried. "Without attachment or movement" is the balance of tension and relaxation. "Unperturbed and unagitated" is natural harmony. "True concentration" is perpetual stillness.

Do not seek more engagement because one remains unagitated amidst affairs, nor seek noise because one remains unperturbed in clamor. Regard the absence of affairs as one's true dwelling and the presence of affairs as responsive traces. Like water or a mirror serving as a reflection, one manifests forms in accordance with things. Skillful means alone enable entry into concentration. How can one know that seeking more affairs will not generate agitation, or that forcibly seeking noise will not produce perturbation? "True dwelling" refers to the realm of stillness; "responsive traces" refers to the realm of movement. "Skillful means" means responding to things with the mind, which is the responsive trace. Constant response and constant stillness both aim to achieve the work of concentration. Thus, it is said: "Skillful means alone enable entry into concentration."

The arising of wisdom may be swift or slow, but this does not depend on the individual. Do not urgently seek wisdom within concentration, for urgency harms one's nature, and harm precludes wisdom. If, without seeking wisdom in concentration, wisdom arises naturally, such concentration is called true wisdom. If wisdom is not employed, true insight resembles foolishness, further enriching concentration and wisdom, both of which attain boundless excellence. Wisdom arises from concentration and follows its natural course. To use wisdom is not wisdom; not using it is wisdom. Cultivating both concentration and wisdom brings limitless joy.

If thoughts arise during concentration, one may attract numerous demonic influences. Malevolent spirits and myriad specters will manifest in accordance with the mind. The visions of Heavenly Worthies, immortals, and venerable figures are auspicious signs.

Signs: omens. Ancient scholars distinguished between auspicious signs and ominous signs; here, the latter is meant. Only when the mind in concentration is suddenly open and unobstructed above, vast and foundationless below, will past karma daily dissolve and new karma cease to form. Unentangled and free, one escapes the cage of the dusty world. With long practice, the Dao is naturally attained. Above, no obstruction; below, no foundation—nothing but emptiness. This represents an advanced stage in concentration practice, echoing the earlier scripture’s teaching: “Observe emptiness as empty; how can desire arise?”

Those who attain the Dao exhibit seven progressive signs. First, the mind easily enters concentration (governs itself), becoming aware of all sensory leaks. Second, chronic illnesses vanish entirely, and body and mind feel light and refreshed. Third, premature depletion is replenished, restoring vitality and lifespan. Fourth, one lives for thousands of years, known as an immortal. Fifth, one refines form into qi, known as a perfected person. Sixth, one refines qi into spirit, known as a spirit person. Seventh, one refines spirit to merge with the Dao, known as a realized person. Discernment sharpens with each stage. Upon attaining the supreme Dao, wisdom becomes complete—completeness meaning all seven stages have been traversed.

If, after long practice in concentration, the body shows none of these signs—if one’s brief, impure life fades and perishes, yet claims to possess awakened wisdom or to have attained the Dao—then the principles of the Dao remain unrealized.

A verse explains:
Knowing arises from conditions,
as fire arises from causes.
Each is the movement of true nature,
yet following the current, the source of the Dao is lost.
Striving to still knowing with the mind,
knowing arises and the mind grows more troubled.
Realizing that nature is fundamentally empty,
knowing becomes the gateway to all wonders.

This scripture guides people in cultivating the mind to enter the Dao, its compassion thorough and all-embracing. Here, the meaning is elucidated in accordance with the text to reveal its earnest intent.

*Inscription by Hanxu*

**Commentary on the *Five Kitchens Sutra***
*(The sutra employs a five-character classical verse structure, which is highly intricate, hence this detailed exposition.)*

**Original text annotated by Shi Zihanxu**

The Tang dynasty Perfected Master Yin Min of the Su Ming Abbey in the capital stated: “When one preserves the primordial qi in harmonious balance, the five viscera become full and the five spirits settle into correctness. When the five viscera are full, flavors are sufficient; when the five spirits are settled, cravings disappear.” This scripture addresses the nourishment of the five viscera, as if seeking food from a kitchen—hence the title *Five Kitchens*.

When the primordial qi is harmoniously balanced, the One Dao is entirely at peace. Harmony itself is without singular harmony, its profound principle merging with the profound boundary. The “primordial qi” refers to the precelestial One Qi. “Harmonious balance” means uniting the disharmonious qi within the five viscera. Once the qi of the five viscera is harmonized, the One Qi becomes the Dao’s qi, and thus the entire body is pervaded by harmonious qi. When the body is filled with harmonious qi, that qi circulates fully, vast and boundless, leaving no singular harmony to be named.

Principle: nature, wherein life resides. Boundary: intersection, where two profundities cannot be separated. When the profound intersects with the profound, each rectifies its nature and life, preserving the Great Harmony.

Do not employ the mind to pursue thought, nor seek thoughtlessness. When the mind is without thought, uphold the Dharma thus. The latter “mind” refers to true intention—wisdom’s light. “Do not employ the mind to pursue thought” means that at the intersection of the two profundities, the arising of wisdom is not subject to human control; one must not urgently seek wisdom in concentration. Yet neither should one seek thoughtlessness. Instead, one should attend to the center of the circle, forgetting yet not forgetting, not forgetting yet forgetting. In the space between intention and non-intention, the One Qi arises and wisdom’s light appears—this is the proper practice. Thus it is said: “When the mind is without thought, uphold the Dharma thus.”

Do not use the mind to contemplate the mind,
nor cling to the absence of contemplation.
When the mind is present, do not fixate on the mind;
in truth, guard the abyss of truth.

Do not use the inwardly illuminating mind to externally contemplate the mind of human desire, so that inner thoughts do not leak out and outer thoughts do not intrude. Having established a mind free from external contemplation, do not cling to the mind of absolute detachment. This means one must allow for appropriate flexibility, naturally adjusting, regulating without attachment, releasing without disturbance. The mind resides within, yet do not fixate on a mind that is within, lest it become bound by the Dharma. Simply abide in true constancy, silently guarding the deep abyss—what the *Cantong Qi* calls “floating and wandering, guarding the center of the circle.”

Cultivate principle, detach from intention;
accumulated cultivation does not align with detachment.
When intention is not cultivated,
one’s own karma remains unknown.

In cultivating one’s nature, first uphold intention, then detach from it. Upholding intention ensures focus; detaching from it entrusts intention to emptiness. If one forcefully cultivates nature by rigidly upholding intention, this is called an extreme view, inevitably leading to fixation and conflicting with the principle of detachment. To uphold intention without upholding it, to maintain it subtly—this is the cultivation of one’s own karma, free from personal views, naturally at ease, tranquil and effortless, thus achieving purity and non-action.

All who consume qi bind qi,
but not those who have long stabilized it.
Qi returns to its original qi;
take it as it comes, release it as it goes.

The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: “All people consume grains and the five flavors, but only the perfected consume the harmonious qi of yin and yang.” From this, we understand that those who consume flavors to nourish qi merely sustain temporarily bound qi, which waxes and wanes—unlike the harmonious qi of the One, which abides long and stabilizes within. Within the five viscera, each possesses harmony as its foundation. The realized person gathers the five qi into a cauldron. When the One Qi arises within the cauldron, it returns to the source of each qi. I take it as it comes and release it as it goes. Taking it, the five qi return to the origin; releasing it, the hundred bones are all regulated.

The *Book of Changes* speaks of "yellow-centered, penetrating principle, rightly positioned within the body—its beauty lies within, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in deeds and enterprises: this is the perfection of beauty." *Xie* (泄) here means "to flow forth."

The *Luminous Mirror Casket Scripture* states: The luminous mirror casket reveals the subtle workings of the Yellow and White, like a precious mirror drawn from its case—radiant, clear, and bright. Its essence lies in quicksilver alone; its method begins with the death of quicksilver, and its foundation lies in first refining the true earth. The Most High, in great compassion, has directly inscribed the essential principles of the Great Elixir upon bamboo and silk. If one can reach the heavens with utmost sincerity, a Perfected One of the Great Clarity will surely break open these subtle words, and all methods will become clear. The laws of immortality are most strict; I dare not rashly annotate them. I humbly reveal the essential wonders of the true scripture within these marks and circles.

The world does not recognize the One—yet from the One Qi, the myriad things are born. If one knows the One and pursues it, attaining the One, all affairs are complete.

The One is the foundation of water, continuing as the Wood of the East. *Gui*-lead gives rise to *Xin*-metal, white and lustrous as jade. The Two is the essence of fire, unerringly the father of the *Geng* direction. *Ren*-water generates yellow gold, and gold becomes the Earth of the Central Palace. Yellow gold is the father of cinnabar; white gold is the mother of quicksilver. The essence of *Ren* and *Gui* waters—recognize them as *Wu* and *Ji*. Black lead is not true lead, for within it lies the primordial water. Cinnabar is not true mercury, for within it lies the mysterious primordial fire. When water and fire achieve mutual completion, they do not stray from the Earth of the *Kun* direction. The true mother, if not spiritually attuned, must be supplemented with the correct yang. Extracting *Kan* to restore *Li*, all things return to the primordial ancestor.

The *Kun* mother nurtures the infant boy; the *Qian* father nurtures the pregnant girl. The maiden weds the infant boy, and they unite as husband and wife. Water and fire coalesce into a single mass, and the couple naturally regard each other. Male and female then conjoin their essences, and from their union, sons and daughters are born. Without a father, a mother cannot form; without a mother, a father is not permitted. When father and mother embody the true form, they do not lose the true Dragon and Tiger. Dragon and Tiger are the Yellow Sprout; the Yellow Sprout is the true earth. True earth is the supreme medicine; the supreme medicine does not depart from the ancestor. Departing from the ancestor, the Elixir cannot form—forming the Elixir is the true principle.

A hen cannot hatch chicks if there is a mother but no father. In vain she broods over single eggs; the qi scatters, and no offspring are born. If you wish to kill quicksilver, you must first kill its mother. When the mother dies and unites with the mysterious primordial, she may then pair with the cinnabar father. Only when father and mother conjoin their true essences is the quicksilver child put to death. Dead quicksilver becomes lead, akin to the Earth of the *Kun* direction. *Kun* earth nurtures the infant boy, transforming into the mother of quicksilver. Quicksilver is but a single substance, never departing from the fire of the South.

In the *Qian* palace dwells the Vermilion Bird; in the *Kun* palace dwells the Dark Warrior. The Dark Warrior produces *Kun* silver; the Vermilion Bird transforms into yellow earth. Only when they converge in the Central Palace is quicksilver put to death. The Northern Dipper is the pivot of heaven, containing within it the water of the Central Palace. When the Four Symbols gather in the Central Palace, South and North become *Wu* and *Ji*. True essence gives rise to *Qian* and *Kun*; lead and mercury are father and mother. Father and mother are *Geng* and *Xin*, truly endowed with the number of the Southwest. Recognize the essence of *Geng* and *Xin*, and you may then refine the earth of the Central Palace. True earth is produced within it, and only then does it govern the central water.

If one recognizes true mercury, within yellow gold lies the spirit-fire. If one recognizes true lead, within white gold lies the spirit-water. When the two qi conjoin to form the Elixir, one need not fear the death of quicksilver. If one does not recognize water and fire, how can one understand the principle of *Qian*-mercury? Damp earth cannot dry water; dry earth can restrain water. If one knows the mechanism of generation and destruction, one grasps the principle of the Returned Elixir.

Yellow gold is true fire; white gold is true water. How many elixir-refiners have become lost ghosts! *Ji*-earth is not true sulfur; *Wu*-earth is not celestial *Gui*. If one takes these as earth, one does not recognize the subtleties within. Quicksilver must mutually generate; quicksilver must be born and die. To kill quicksilver, one must first kill its mother.

The essence of prior-heaven *Qian* and *Kun* is the true *Wu* and *Ji*. *Qian* is yellow, *Kun* is white—yellow and white are medicines beyond compare. Use only the essence of yellow and white, not their physical forms. How is the essence of yellow and white obtained? Use only cinnabar as its match. When cinnabar dies and turns red, only then is quicksilver put to death. Quicksilver cannot fly—here lies the formation of the medicine. If immortals obtain this essence, they steal from heaven and earth. If worldly people obtain this essence, they amass gold and become wealthy. From one revolution to nine revolutions, nine times nine is eighty-one. If one understands this principle, one must firmly and secretly secure it. Conceal it without speech, and one ascends to the rank of immortals. If obtained, broadly aid others; if not obtained, do not waste it in vain. If one carelessly reveals this, even the celestial spirits will be displeased. Be cautious, again and again—these are a thousand words, ten thousand phrases.

The *Golden Valley Scripture*:
The *Golden Valley Song* clarifies the method of planting the medicine. The Great Elixir is like a grain of millet, first sown in the Jade Field. Cultivate, harvest, and reap the golden grain to consume it. Its essence lies in working within lead; its use lies in quicksilver alone.

The Elixir-Refining Formula, the Elixir-Refining Formula—listen carefully as I explain to you:
The mother qi first transmits to the child; the first child’s nature is still unrefined. The second child is likewise; in chaos, they are hard to distinguish. The third child begins to shine, transformed and divided into hardness and decisiveness. One child gives birth to another, and the nine children are fierce in nature. Ascending in purity to the Great Void, celestial immortals come to welcome you.

This Elixir conveys the supreme Dao—do not speak of it to the unworthy.
Elixir, Elixir, Elixir—a single grain grants longevity for ten thousand kalpas.
One gives rise to two, two to three, three to the myriad things without end.
Without karmic affinity, one cannot encounter this Elixir Scripture—this is the true oral transmission of the sages.

The crucible has no head; the cauldron has no ears.
*Geng* is the exterior; *Xin* is the interior.
There are no other medicines to take—only water and fire paired together.
Swallows do not hatch phoenixes; solitary hares do not nurse horses.
Without true father and mother, all that is born is false.
To plant grain, one must use millet—without millet, no grain will grow.

Refining the Elixir requires treasures—without treasures, the Elixir will not form.
If one uses common or杂 substances, all will fail to be true.
Use lead yet do not use lead—one must work within the lead.
When it comes to using lead, to use lead is still mistaken.
If one wishes mercury to die, first one must kill the mercury.
If mercury does not die, how can mercury die?
Raw and cooked mutually restrain each other; through restraint, they naturally attain numinosity.
Black and red cinnabar and mercury congeal—know clearly this principle is most profound.
It does not depart from male and female begetting male and female; the male and female begotten give rise to further descendants.
Mercury is one thing, yet nothing else—first it becomes flesh, then it becomes bone.
Bone and flesh intimately transform into the true; from this, the river chariot may freely reverse.
This medicine has no furnace, only a crucible—a single crucible transforms into ten thousand crucibles.
Gold transforms into gold, silver into silver—when was there ever another external spirit?
After three cycles of turning, refining, and parting the embryo, one even scorns the ancestral lineage as clamor and dust.
The medicine is gold, and gold is the medicine—the mother’s power to nurture the child runs deep.
The pregnant woman must be securely concealed within the chamber of spirit; reared in the inner chamber, her resolve naturally hardens.
Jade fields and golden valleys are sown in due season—I now expound this with utmost clarity.
If one obtains a person to guard it, one should keep it secret and hidden; if not secret and hidden, one will incur Heaven’s wrath.

*Commentary on "The Rootless Tree Lyrics"*
*Annotated by Liu Wuyuan of Mount Qiyun*

Li Hanxu of Changyi Mountain’s Commentary

Preface

The *Wuzhen* of Tiantai elucidates the great matter of returning to the origin through both inner and outer medicines. Yet in its time, those of shallow understanding and ignorance mistook it for a text on furnace fires and sexual arts. Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp the principle of returning, further appended superficial doctrines of purity to ride its fame. Weng Baoguang, upon reading it, laughed and said, “This is one who knows nothing of the Golden Elixir.” He then composed annotations to correct it. Lu Ziye and Chen Shangyang expanded upon it, and with the emergence of the three commentaries on *Wuzhen*, Ye’s annotations were soon buried.

Master Zhang Sanfeng of Liaoyang was a celestial immortal. During his time in Wudang, he composed *Twenty-Four Daoist Songs of the Rootless Tree*, a work peerless with Ziyang’s *Wuzhen*, though the world also misconstrued it as concerning sexual arts and furnace fires. Hanxu declared with clarity, “The Dao does not prevail because the Dao is not made clear.” He longed to compose an exegesis to illuminate it but lamented the lack of like-minded alchemical companions.

Liu Wuyuan of Qiyun, with his vast and discerning talent, authored dozens of works transmitted to the world. Among them was *Annotations on the Rootless Tree*. Hanxu obtained and examined it, finding its diction profound and its principles perfectly harmonious. Thereupon, he rejoiced greatly, for it had anticipated what his own heart had long affirmed. Where Liu’s work left some matters unexhausted, Hanxu supplemented them, revealing without omission the inner and outer medicines, the fire phases of returning, and the sequence of furnaces and crucibles. Thus, the two commentaries on *The Rootless Tree* stand as the three annotations to *Wuzhen*.

Having completed the commentary, he asked me for a preface. Though I am unworthy, I record here the depth of his intent.

Respectfully inscribed by Qingxia Cave’s Master, along with his fellow disciple He Xifu, on the day of the Beginning of Autumn in the year *dingwei*.

Two Lyrics on *The Rootless Tree* to the Tune of *Zhegu Tian*
Self-Composed by the Author

The Dao’s methods circulate—some orthodox, some heterodox;
Those who stray from orthodoxy and embrace the perverse spread across the earth.
Rarely seen is the phoenix soaring through the clouds,
While many, sunk in delusion, become frogs fallen into wells.
Hard to distinguish, the clamor grows chaotic—
All mistake red earth for cinnabar.
To know the true path that penetrates the mysterious,
Study closely the blossoms beneath the Rootless Tree.

*To the Tune of "Selling Flowers"*
Beneath the Rootless Tree, the eternal constant is expounded:
The six realms of sentient beings share a single light.
When you grasp the affairs before and after *Vairocana’s* voice,
You see there is fundamentally no coming or going—your form is majestic.

Inscribed by Zhang Sanfeng, remnant elder of the Great Yuan, on the Day of Balanced Harmony in the *jiazi* year of the Hongwu reign (1484), at the thatched hut on Mount Wudang’s Heavenly Pillar Peak.

[Liu’s Annotation]
"The Rootless Tree" is the title of these lyrics.
All trees have roots to grow and flourish;
Without roots, they cannot endure.
Human life in the world—birth, aging, sickness, death—
appears and vanishes in an instant.
A hundred years pass like a spark or lightning flash,
just like a tree without roots.
The Immortal’s twenty-four lyrics, named after the "Rootless Tree,"
awaken worldly people to see through the illusory dream of floating life
and cultivate nature and destiny early.

[Li’s Annotation]
"The Rootless Tree" refers to the *qi* of the human body.
The hundred meridians of the body all arise from *qi*,
and *qi* emerges from the realm of emptiness—hence "rootless."
The alchemists cultivate roots within the realm of emptiness;
both precelestial and postcelestial *qi* arise from nothingness.
Thus, the rootless is the origin of the rooted.
Those refining postcelestial *qi* must enter emptiness to seek being,
then merge being into emptiness.
Those refining precelestial *qi* must merge being into emptiness,
then return from emptiness to being—
the cultivation of roots follows this pattern alone.
Yet the *qi* of the human body differs in youth, prime, and old age,
and the *qi* of refinement varies in its early, middle, and late stages.
The twenty-four chapters correspond to the solar terms of a year,
all urging people to observe the blossoms beneath the Rootless Tree in due season.
This is the perfection of the Dao’s sentiment.

---

[Liu’s Note] Lamenting the world.
[Li’s Note] Exhorting people to nurture the hidden blossom.

The Rootless Tree, its blossoms deep in seclusion—
Who would cease their craving for glory and splendor?
Floating life’s affairs are a boat on the sea of suffering,
Tossed to and fro without freedom.
No shore, no boundary—hard to moor,
Ever drifting in the perilous haunts of fish and dragons.
If you would turn your head, there lies the shore;
Do not wait until the storm wrecks your boat.

[Liu’s Annotation]
Blossoms are the radiant spirit of a tree.
The human body is like a tree,
and the true numen is like the tree’s blossoms.
All trees have roots, so they can grow and bloom.
Only the human body is rootless—life and death are uncertain,
entirely dependent on the movement of a single spark of true numinous *qi*.
When the true numen flourishes, the body lives;
when it declines, the body dies.
Human existence and demise hinge on the flourishing or decline of the true numen.
Thus, though the true numen is the blossom of the human tree,
it is in truth the root of the human tree.
Wang Chongyang called this true numen the "Yellow Sprout,"
Laozi called it the "Golden Blossom,"
Lü Dongbin called it the "Numinous Root,"
Zhang Boduan called it "True Gold,"
Shao Yong called it the "Heavenly Root,"
the Immortal called it "Golden Essence,"
and various alchemical classics call it the "Primordial Unity of *Qi*."
Though its names are manifold, they all describe this one thing.
This thing is born of the precelestial, stored in the postcelestial,
governing Heaven and Earth, unifying yin and yang,
directing the Five Phases, nurturing the myriad beings.
Vast beyond measure, minute beyond limit,
when released, it fills the Six Directions;
when gathered, it retreats into secrecy.
In essence, for Confucians it is the Supreme Ultimate,
for Daoists, the Golden Elixir,
for Buddhists, Perfect Enlightenment.
In function, for Confucians it is Illustrious Virtue or the Heart-Mind of Heaven and Earth,
for Daoists, the Numinous Treasure or the Mysterious Pearl of Millet,
for Buddhists, the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye or the Wondrous Heart of Nirvana.
The true numen of humans is originally round and luminous,
pure and bare, untainted and free,
neither born nor extinguished, neither form nor emptiness.
It neither increases in sages nor decreases in commoners.
Yet, entangled with the postcelestial,
the multitude loses it, while the noble preserves it—
thus the division between sage and commoner.
The multitude loses it by chasing false numina,
while the noble preserves it by not pursuing false numina.
Because the multitude chases false numina,
the true numen becomes dim and obscure.
Following their desires, they crave glory and splendor,
compete for fame and profit, never ceasing.
Mistaking the false for the true,
a hundred worries afflict their hearts,
ten thousand affairs weary their forms—
like a boat on the sea of suffering,
tossed to and fro, drifting in the perilous haunts of fish and dragons.
If one could suddenly awaken and turn back,
leaping to the other shore,
one would not wait for the storm to wreck the boat
and lose one’s nature and life.
To lose the human form once is to be trapped for ten thousand kalpas.

[Li’s Explanation]
The mountain recluse has dwelt for years beneath the "Rootless Tree," ever wishing to expound its profound mysteries and summon those of like kind. One day, strolling through the mountain garden, he saw the flowers and trees in their serene seclusion, naturally abundant in grace, and there he grasped that this word "secluded" was the wellspring from which the twenty-fourth chapter’s "Rootless Tree" unfolds. Secluded—profound, the realm of emptiness and nothingness. All such realms of emptiness in the world are the altars of flowers and trees where Daoists practice. Thus did my mountain teacher inscribe upon the Bamboo-Embracing Study: *"Three paths of secluded blossoms, fragrance at ease; / Four gardens of cultivated bamboo, shadows intertwined."* How wondrous the words! They resonate with this same truth. If flowers are not deeply secluded, their fragrance cannot be at ease; amidst the red dust of the world, peace is elusive day and night.

As for *"shadows intertwined"*—this is the hollow heart and tranquil qi depending upon each other, so that one’s qi nourishes the heart, and the heart nourishes the qi. When qi flourishes, principle is full; when the heart is at peace, the spirit is whole. Thus may one preserve one’s true nature and contain one’s numen. Master Wu Yuan was right to take *"true numen"* as the flower and root of the human tree. True numen is true knowing and numinous knowing. Numinous knowing belongs to the nature, which is yin; true knowing belongs to the emotions, which is yang. If nature and emotions remain uncorrupted, the true numen is complete. Yet alas! The seven emotions and six desires consume and deplete it, inwardly damaging the nature and outwardly harming the emotions, so that the true numen vanishes. When the true numen vanishes, there is a tree without flowers, a tree without roots.

Master Wu Yuan’s meaning is thus. I have more to say: flowers grow from the tree, the tree grows from the root, the root grows from nothingness. The essence of the true numen is indeed conceived within emptiness, hence the phrase *"the flower is truly secluded."* That which is conceived within emptiness is the primordial wisdom of the human being, the emptiness and numen within. Without shadow or form, it embodies all principles and responds to all affairs. Sages and worthies employ it with abundance; immortals and buddhas cultivate it to sufficiency. Yet it must not be entangled with emotions and desires. If emotions and desires intrude, one daily extracts being from non-being to meet one’s needs. The more one extracts being, the more one loses non-being; the more one loses non-being, the more one loses the root. Lose the root, and the tree is lost; lose the tree, and the flower is lost. As the saying goes: *"When a man grows old, his mind wanders east; when a tree grows old, its heart is hollow."* Wisdom is exhausted, emptiness and numen scatter—what true numen remains?

All this comes from craving glory and splendor, refusing to rest, daily pursuing the affairs of floating life, never considering how a hundred years pass in an instant, how death severs all concerns. One sits in the boat of the sea of suffering, yet never thinks that in a single moment of impermanence, the nature may sink with the overturned boat—boundless, shore-less, mooring nowhere, drifting and wandering through the perilous haunts of fish and dragons, endlessly toiling, ceaselessly laboring, only to wound one’s wisdom and fetter one’s emptiness and numen. What benefit is there in this?

The immortal master, moved by profound compassion, turns the compassionate vessel to ferry them, saying: The reason worldly people sink deeply into the sea of suffering and struggle to escape is that they refuse to turn back and do not recognize the shore. If they would but turn back, that is the shore. The shore is the path of awakening. If one can tread the path of awakening, wisdom returns, emptiness and numen endure. Past errors may yet be corrected; future rightness may still be pursued. Though spirit and qi decline, there is a way to restore them. Only do not wait until the storm’s surging waves shatter the boat. Then, if the boat remains, the person remains—ready for the needs of the other shore, an aid to emerging from the abyss.

[Liu’s Words]
Strive, diligent seekers.

[Li’s Words]
Exhort others to graft and renew.
The rootless tree, its blossoms faint,
An aged trunk must sprout fresh shoots anew.
Plum on willow, mulberry on pear—
Such patterns passed to those who cultivate the true.
Since ancient times, immortals’ art of grafting stands:
Even the old may yet be cured by healing hands.
Seek a wise teacher, ask the way,
Begin at once—yet still the hour is late to start the Way.

[Liu’s Annotation]
Many doubt that age and feeble strength, with spirit spent,
Are like a tree whose flowers fade, its vital force undone,
Never to return to primal source, nor root reclaim,
And so they cast themselves away, awaiting death alone.
Yet mark how aged trees, grafted with tender shoots,
Burgeon anew in lush array—
Plum on willow, mulberry on pear,
All lifeless things, yet life restored.
How much more man, most numinous of beings,
Endowed with heaven and earth’s true qi,
Could age not also find its cure?
What is this healing art?
It is the Way of grafting age anew.
To know this Way, seek out a wise teacher,
Beg the true method without delay.
Once found, begin at once—yet still the hour is late.

[Li’s Exegesis]
Faint means decline.
When one grows old, the primal qi wanes,
And grafting must be hastened then.
Observe the plum on willow, mulberry on pear—
There lies the model.
*To lodge* is as in the elixir method:
Lodging in the Gate of Dui, or the Western Neighbor’s abode;
*To graft* is as in the elixir method:
Joining life to nature, self to other.
Thus plum on willow, mulberry on pear
Are patterns for today’s true cultivators,
Ancient immortals’ grafting Way.
Grafting is the cure for age.
Though grafting trees has proven arts,
Plum and willow, mulberry and pear are kindred kinds.
The old branch split, the tender shoot inserted,
Bound and wrapped, good soil applied,
Yin and yang conjoined—
Such is the tree-grafting art.
The cure for age must likewise match kind with kind,
Refined soil fused, then youth and primal source restored.
This method wise teachers know;
It rests with seekers to inquire.
“Begin at once—yet still the hour is late”:
Lest time outrun us, impermanence arrive unlooked-for,
Nature unenlightened, life unsecured,
And one stray into the boundless ghostly realm.
Immortal He Xiangu said:
“In the Gardens of Lang,
Peach trees bear willow branches;
On Fusang’s boughs, pears entwine—
These are the Eastern King and Queen Mother’s
Pointers to the immortal’s Way.”
Zhang Sanfeng’s words are not without foundation.

[Liu’s Words] On the work of refining the self.
[Li’s Words] On the subtleties of the flower and willow.

The rootless tree—its blossoms pure and green,
From ancient days to now, flower-wine makes immortals.
The brothel’s haze, the meat-and-wine grove:
No need to shun flesh’s scent, nor stray into lust.
Lust wastes the treasure of long life;
Meat and wine pass through the gut—yet the Dao abides in the heart.
Open the gate, I tell you this:
Without flower, without wine, the Dao cannot be achieved.

[Liu’s Annotation]
The Way of the Golden Elixir takes utter purity—without the slightest dross—as its goal. Yet to attain such purity, one must first pass through the realm of utter turbidity. Only by remaining unstained amid the deepest filth does true purity arise. Thus it is said: “The rootless tree—its blossoms pure and green; from ancient days to now, flower-wine makes immortals.”

How can flower and wine give rise to immortals? The brothel’s haze and the meat-and-wine grove are deft at ensnaring mortals. Yet if one can walk through the brothel seeing color as no-color, untempted by its haze; if one can dwell in the meat-and-wine grove, taking each day as it comes, unburdened by its fare—then one neither strays into lust nor shuns flesh’s scent. Appetite and desire are both transformed, the heart of the Dao abides, the human heart fades, and the true spirit remains unharmed, undiminished. The Way may then be hoped for.

The phrase “no need to shun flesh’s scent” does not mean craving it, but rather that meat and wine pass through the gut while the heart makes no reckoning. Unstained by lust, the heart is free of the brothel’s haze; meat and wine pass through the gut, yet the heart knows no meat or wine. A heart free of the brothel’s haze naturally bears the immortal’s blossom of long life; a heart free of meat and wine naturally holds the immortal’s wine of life’s extension. With immortal blossom and immortal wine, one arrives at the realm of pure truth. Those in the world who shun the brothel’s haze and avoid meat and wine—how could they know that immortals emerge from the midst of mortal blossoms and mortal wine? How could they know that without blossom, without wine, the Dao cannot be achieved?

The *Knocking on the Hexagrams Song* says:
“Wine is a good friend, blossoms a companion;
In the willow lanes and flower streets, seek the true person.
The true person is found only in the flower streets’ play.”
This is the subtle use of “blossoms pure and green.”

[Li’s Explanation]
For most people, the nature of appetite and desire is strongest. Master Immortal Zhang Sanfeng thus used flower and wine as pointers. Many crave flower and wine—yet who knows of the flower-wine immortals? The primordial qi within the body is fresh, verdant, and tender. If one can consume it, harness it, drink it, and wear it, one’s spirit becomes clear and qi invigorated. This is what is meant by “flower-wine immortals,” who have existed from ancient times to the present. Yet these are not the brothel’s haze or the meat-and-wine grove of the world.

The haze of brothels and the fare of meat and wine dull the spirit. The qi of meat and wine is rank, and the haze of brothels stirs lust—both are harmful, though lust is the graver. Those skilled in refining the self eat when food is at hand, without seeking more. Thus they do not shun flesh’s scent, yet forget it; they see color as no-color, without clinging to beauty. Thus they do not stray into lust, and lust is extinguished. Otherwise, essence scatters and fluids leak, causing no small harm. As the *Yellow Court Classic* says: “Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdancy; only by sealing and guarding the light can one attain lasting peace.” From this we know that straying into lust must waste the treasure of long life.

Meat and wine pass through the gut—yet the Dao still abides in the heart. How could flower and wine delude one? It is people who delude themselves with flower and wine! Without seeking mortal blossoms or mortal wine, one must find the immortal blossom and immortal wine. Immortal blossom and immortal wine aid the achievement of the Dao—they are the fresh, tender blossoms on the rootless tree, rich in flavor and fine in hue, most potent for nourishment.

The immortal master opens the primordial gate and tells you this: without such blossoms and wine, the Dao is difficult to achieve.

---

[Liu’s Words] Refuting heterodox paths.
[Li’s Words] Lamenting solitary cultivation.

The rootless tree—its blossoms solitary.
May I ask: have you found the matching yin and yang?
A hen’s egg—hard to hatch a chick,
For it has turned its back on the alchemical furnace of yin and yang.
A woman without a husband is a resentful maiden;
A man without a wife is a widowed man.
I sigh for the deluded,
So muddled—
Sitting in stillness, cultivating alone, their qi withers.

[Liu’s Annotation]
The Way of cultivating truth requires the matching of yin and yang to fully form the treasure of the true spirit. If there is yin without yang, or yang without yin, this is called “solitary blossoms without match,” and the true spirit cannot be formed—just like a hen’s egg. It is hard to hatch a chick because it has turned its back on the alchemical furnace of yin-yang union.

Again, like a woman without a husband or a man without a wife—how can they bear offspring? Those blind fools in the world, not delving into the principles of yin and yang, not tracing the source of creation, muddled in their affairs: some contemplate emptiness, some regulate breath, some fixate on spirits, some guard the apertures, some move qi—all are sitting in stillness, cultivating alone, yin without yang. Not only do they fail to benefit their nature and life, but they harm them, and the more they cultivate, the more their qi withers.

[Li’s Explanation]
“Solitary” refers to inner cultivation. Cultivating nature alone cannot establish life, for it is solitary and without counterpart, unable to give birth to the treasure of life. It is like a hen without a rooster—though it can lay eggs, it cannot hatch chicks. Today, those who cultivate nature to nurture qi do not realize that their qi is merely solitary yin. To avoid withering, true yang must be matched with true yin—only then are they of the same kind.

May I ask those who cultivate the Dao: have you obtained the matching kind? Here, true yang is righteousness, and true yin is the Dao. Matching righteousness with the Dao, one is no longer solitary. Yet there are three layers to this process: first, true yin gives rise to true yang; next, true yang is matched with true yin; finally, from the union of yin and yang, the vast qi of the true spirit is born. How could this be like a hen’s egg, hard to hatch a chick?

Those that cannot hatch chicks do so because they have abandoned the principle of yin and yang and the furnace of creation. Yin and yang are husband and wife. The Dao of the sage begins with husband and wife, and from them all things are transformed and born—so too is it with the men and women of the world. If a woman has no husband, she is solitary yin that cannot give birth and becomes a resentful maiden; if a man has no wife, he is solitary yang that cannot be nurtured and becomes a widowed bachelor. This principle is clear and easy to understand, yet the deluded of the world remain utterly confused, believing that sitting in stillness alone can clarify the mind, reveal the nature, and allow one to ascend directly—all without ever speaking of the matching of yin and yang. I fear that day after day of sitting and cultivating will only lead one to wander the halls of empty nothingness or play in the sea of extinction, until eventually their qi withers and fades.

*[Liu’s verse:]*
Matching yin and yang.
*[Li’s verse:]*
Inverting yin and yang.
The rootless tree, its blossoms askew—
separated from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.
Gold blocks wood, mercury blocks lead,
yang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side.
In the world, yin and yang—man pairs with woman—
bear sons and grandsons, generation after generation.
Following the flow makes one mortal; reversing it makes one immortal—
the difference lies solely in this inversion.

*[Liu’s commentary:]*
The *Book of Changes* states: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.” *Awakening to Reality* says: “When yin and yang are of the same kind, they return to mutual resonance; when the two eights are balanced, they naturally unite.” If yin and yang are each askew—if yang stirs but yin does not respond, if yin seeks but yang does not beckon, if yang is excessive while yin is deficient, or if yang is abundant while yin is lacking—then the blossom of true spirit is askew, neither centered nor upright, and the Dao cannot be complete.

A person’s true emotion is like gold, true knowing like lead—both are firm. The numinous nature is like wood, the numinous knowing like mercury—both are soft. True emotion and true knowing, being firm, easily sink; the numinous nature and numinous knowing, being soft, easily float. If nature seeks emotion, emotion returns to nature; if the true restrains the numinous, the numinous returns to the true—then firm and soft respond to each other, yin and yang harmonize, and they transform into one qi, with life’s mechanism enduring unceasingly. But if emotion does not return to nature, if the numinous does not return to the true—this is what is meant by “gold blocks wood, mercury blocks lead, yang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side.” How then can one return to the root and restore the origin, coalescing the elixir of true spirit?

Observe the world: when man and woman unite, they bear sons and grandsons, passing life from generation to generation without end. Know then that the Dao of cultivating the true is the same—when yin and yang unite, they give birth to immortals and sages, also passing on without end. The difference lies only in whether one follows the flow or reverses it, distinguishing immortals from mortals. Following the flow makes one mortal; reversing it makes one immortal—the contention lies solely in this inversion.

This “inversion” is profound in principle and subtle in practice. It is not the center of inside and outside, nor the center of the body’s upper and lower. It is the center of the union of bright yang, formless and imageless, called the root of heaven and earth, the aperture of yin and yang, the abode of life and death, the gate of primordial transformation. Human life resides here, human death resides here; becoming a sage or worthy resides here, becoming human or beast also resides here. If one cultivating the Dao can stand firm in this place, reverse the flow, and invert it, then calamity transforms into fortune, punishment into virtue—what is called “the elixir forming in a single hour.”

Alas! The “inversion” is not easily known, nor is the person who inverts it. The sexual arts take the place of union between man and woman as the “inversion,” with the man absorbing the woman’s blood as the reversal. The circulation arts take the Yellow Court as the “inversion,” with qi and blood rising in the back and descending in the front as the reversal. All these are but crude imitations—how could they understand the meaning of inversion in the path of immortals? Those who seek the truth should discern this carefully.

*[Li’s explanation:]*
“Askew” refers to yin and yang being separated, unable to complete the elixir. When yin and yang unite at the center, the knife-point of the elixir congeals, and the arts of the Dao are fully realized. Gold and wood, lead and mercury—these are yin and yang. The essence of wood and the nature of mercury belong to yin; the qi of gold and the emotion of lead belong to yang. Essence and qi require each other, nature and emotion resonate—gold cherishes the benevolence of wood, wood loves the righteousness of gold; mercury goes to welcome lead, lead comes to join mercury. Only then is there no illness of separation, and the great medicine of the true body is born. If yin is solitary and yang widowed, each to one side, then yin and yang do not pair, askew and incomplete—how can they transform and give birth to the supreme treasure, passing it down for ten thousand generations?

The method of matching is similar for immortals and mortals—only mortals use the flow, while immortals use the reversal. Master Wu Yuan said that the “inversion” is not easily known; I say that even the word “reverse” is not understood. To invert at the center, one must first know the wondrous use of “reverse.” If one knows reversal, then gold, wood, lead, and mercury are all within it; yin and yang, qian and kun, are all inverted—and moreover, all events revolve within the word “reverse.” Obtaining the medicine and returning the elixir can be achieved in an instant.

*[Liu’s verse:]*
When the medicine is born.
*[Li’s verse:]*
The principle of *kun* and *shen*.
The rootless tree, its blossoms fresh—
born in the *kun* direction, *kun* is the person.
Pluck the blossom, wear it;
gather the blossom’s heart,
its pistils layered in spring’s splendor.
People of the world do not grasp the principle within the blossom—
a single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.
Borrow the blossom’s name, become the blossom’s body—
every line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* speaks truly.

*[Liu’s commentary:]*
“Fresh” means that the original thing, long buried, suddenly reappears. When the blossom is fresh, its radiance is reborn—like the moon appearing in the southwest *kun* direction, beneath pure yin, where a speck of subtle yang emerges. This is like the empty room generating brightness, the true spirit manifesting, and the original face reappearing.

This original face is none other than the undying true person within me—with this person, one is human; without it, one is not. It is what I receive from heaven to be human. Yet this true person does not readily appear, nor is it often seen. Only in moments of utter emptiness and profound stillness, when all conditions are stilled, does its image fleetingly emerge. Utter emptiness and profound stillness are the very image of *kun* in its pure yin—hence it is said, “born in the *kun* direction, *kun* is the person.”

This person has long been buried beneath dust and grime, leaving no trace. When its image suddenly appears, it is like a fresh blossom—an opportunity not to be missed. One must act swiftly, plucking and gathering it to make it one’s own. To “pluck the blossom and wear it” is to take up this true person’s flower; to “gather the blossom’s heart” is to gather this true person’s heart. Gradually plucking and gathering, from little to much, one accumulates depth and radiance, and the true spirit remains undimmed. Then the pistils layer upon layer, all principles become luminous, and wherever the heart turns, the Way is present—its splendor as bright as spring, with yang qi spreading everywhere and blossoms blooming in every place.

Yet this flower belongs to everyone; everyone sees it, yet no one grasps it. Most let it slip past them, face to face. If one does grasp it, transcending the mundane and entering sagehood occurs in an instant—hence it is said, “a single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.” The immortal elder, out of compassion, borrows the blossom’s name to become the blossom’s body—now form, now formless—each line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* expounding the intent of the primordial, wishing for all to attain the Dao and each to become an immortal. Alas, how can those of this age not grasp the principle within the blossom, and instead recklessly speculate with “bedchamber arts” and “inner elixirs of the boudoir”? Even the immortal elder can do nothing about it. How lamentable!

*[Li’s commentary:]*
Master Wuyuan speaks of the character “person” as the original face—one who has glimpsed this person cannot help but speak at length and with deep feeling, seeking to awaken both self and others with earnest compassion. Yet the word “is” in “kun *is* the person” has not been fully illuminated.

Now, the blossom is likened to the person, and the person borrows the blossom as a metaphor. The blossom being fresh is like a person returning to the root, attaining emptiness and guarding stillness, observing the return of that single yang—unaware, the spring scenery is renewed. This blossom appears in the *kun* direction, meaning *kun* sees the blossom, the blossom sees the person, and where the blossom is born is where the person is born—hence “kun *is* the person.”

In the alchemical method, lead is sown in the metal village, mercury is scattered in the fire land. Metal and fire reside in the southwest; the southwest gains its companion. Where metal and fire unite is precisely above the *kun* direction. This person is a golden body and fiery form, a realm of pure yang—our true qi, also called true emotion. Vague and indistinct, within it there is an image: hot as fire, radiant as a blossom. Its fragrance intoxicates like wine, and to obtain it is to be as if drunk. At this moment, one must pluck and wear it without delay. One must further gather its heart, swallowing it whole. From blossom to pistil, penetrating layer upon layer, it is truly the splendor of spring’s palace. Yet people know only its exterior and not its interior, and thus cannot grasp the wondrous principle within the blossom.

The wondrous principle within the blossom is pure heaven’s mechanism. When heaven’s mechanism is revealed, a single secret is worth ten thousand gold. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh lines here are all from Lü Zu’s *Knocking on the Trigrams*. Master Feng said: “Lü Zu borrows the blossom’s name for the human body and takes the blossom’s body as the human’s body. My lines, each drawn from *Knocking on the Trigrams*, speak with utmost truth and savor.”

[Liu’s words] Seize the moment to pluck and gather.
[Li’s words] Before the furnace, settle into stillness.

The rootless tree—its blossoms now in full bloom,
Fair and delicate, their beauty rivals powdered jade.
Guard against the ape and horse, stubborn and wild;
Don the iron mask of your natal face.
Raise the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon,
Pluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall.
With wind-filled sails, return fully laden—
How could one pass the mountain of treasures in vain?

[Liu’s commentary] When the primordial true spirit shines forth, one root gives rise to ten thousand branches. In every moment, contemplate its images—nothing exists apart from the blossoms in their abundance. At the height of their bloom, when radiance is fully revealed and spirit expends itself outwardly, one is prone to vie for marvels and flaunt refinement. Thus it is said: “Fair and delicate, their beauty rivals powdered jade.” At this very moment, one must guard against peril and danger, firmly tether the ape and horse, don the iron mask of one’s natal face, and wield the treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon. In the presence of phenomena, forget emotion; pluck every blossom that emerges from the wall, allowing not the slightest attachment to form or dissipation of true qi. The “natal face” is the iron mask of unknowing and unawareness. The “treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon” is the true nature untouched by defilement. The natal iron mask and the Azure Dragon’s treasure-sword arise from the same source but bear different names: in terms of essence, it is the natal iron mask; in terms of function, it is the Azure Dragon’s treasure-sword. The iron mask is the settled body; the treasure-sword is the instrument of wisdom. Stillness employs wisdom; wisdom perfects stillness. Stillness and wisdom depend on each other; essence and function are never apart. The primordial true spirit is form yet emptiness, ever responsive yet ever still, without leakage or seepage—this is what is meant by “plucking every fresh blossom from the garden wall.” The blossoms on the wall have just emerged but have not yet left the wall, the moment when true qi has not yet dispersed. Pluck them at this instant, and they are utterly free of dross, purely celestial truth. Gradually grow, gradually gather; gradually pluck, gradually withdraw—one must pluck until nothing remains to be plucked. Alas! The great medicine is hard to encounter; the great method is hard to meet. Having chanced upon them, the moment must not be missed. With wind-filled sails, swiftly pluck the fresh blossoms, return fully laden—how could one pass the mountain of treasures in vain, only to regret it later?

[Li’s Explanation]
"Abundance" refers to the moment of fullness. The beauty of a fair face and delicate features is likened to the primordial unity of qi—just as the Immortal Elder’s *Five Watches Daoist Ballad* says: *"When all yin is spent, the radiant yang season arrives, / A branch of spring’s splendor, golden blossoms in bloom."* "Surpassing the powdered mass" describes the birth of the medicine, the very instant when the flower-demon vies in beauty. As the ancient immortals said: *"When the primordial arises, the demon of medicine readily stirs."* If one’s cultivation is not yet pure and unwavering in the face of beauty, who could seize the golden blossom in but half a moment? Thus it is said: *"Guard against the ape and horse, ever more stubborn"*—just as the *One Branch of Flowers* ballad puts it: *"With delicate, alluring grace, / Ten slender fingers, soft and fair, / Yet they stir not my intent-steed or mind-ape."*

Raise the iron mask of your birth-given face, bring forth your power of stillness—*"Let them try, yet not a trace of wavering remains."* Draw the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon, pluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall—this aligns with *"Repel the demon horde, fiercely wield the keen-edged sword of wisdom, / Dare to gather those blossoms newly sprung beyond the wall."* Wu Yuan takes the iron mask as stillness and the treasure-sword as wisdom, truly a kindred understanding. Yet if stillness and wisdom do not arise from the refinement of the self, then stillness is not true stillness, nor wisdom true wisdom—they cannot be employed when the moment arrives.

The *One Branch of Flowers* says: *"Moment by moment, guard the intent-steed, / Instant by instant, lock the mind-ape, / Day and night without rest, / Refine the self with unbroken effort."* One must cultivate until *"I am a sea of purity, unstained by a single speck of dust"*—only then is it true stillness. *"I am a night-shining pearl, suspended in the void"*—only then is it true wisdom.

The "garden wall" signifies the blossom that has emerged beyond the wall yet still clings to it—this is called the "blossom beyond the wall." The fire is at its purest, the timing at its truest; without a transmitted teaching, none can comprehend it, and without having traversed the path, none can know it. If one recognizes the moment the flower’s branch emerges beyond the wall and immediately gathers it, this is the immortal’s art. "Plucking every blossom" means drawing it all in with a single breath, swallowing it into one’s own domain—not the gradual gathering and gradual withdrawal. Gradual gathering and withdrawal belong to the later stages of nurturing, drawing out, and replenishing.

Seize the wind-filled sails, return fully laden—when the four signs converge, the elixir is formed, and the River Chariot is swiftly set in motion to carry it back. How could one pass the mountain of treasures in vain? This mountain of treasures is the birthplace of the primordial.

In the alchemical method, what is refined is called medicine, what is gathered is called medicine, and what is nurtured is called fire. Yet where there is medicine, there is fire—though not the fire of gentle nurturing. This chapter’s annotation correctly interprets the gathering of medicine.

[Liu’s Note] Advancing and retreating yin and yang.
[Li’s Note] Nurturing the returned elixir.

The rootless tree, its blossoms in flight,
Once shed, they bloom again at the appointed time.
When the lead-flower appears, as *gui* is spent,
Once more the western garden’s branches burst with bloom.
Just gathered beneath the moon’s waning light,
Again they mend the robe in morning’s glow.
This mystery, rare in the world,
Must be pondered deeply with the immortals.

[Liu’s Annotation]
When a person’s spirit declines and true numen scatters, it is like blossoms flying and withering away. Yet even fallen blossoms have their season of rebirth; so too does the decline of a person hold the way of return. What is this way of return? It is the path of yin yielding to yang once more, the way of withered blossoms blooming anew.

The "lead-flower" is the radiance of the Dao-heart’s true knowing. *Gui*-water is the selfish desire of the human heart’s guest qi. When the lead-flower appears, the Dao-heart remains undimmed; when *gui*-water is exhausted, the human heart abides in stillness. With the Dao-heart undimmed and the human heart still, the original, unblemished, and perfectly complete true numen reappears—thus the blossoms, though fallen, bloom again in full.

Because *gui*-water must be spent, it is said: *"Gathered beneath the moon’s waning light."* Because the lead-flower must appear, it is said: *"Mend the robe in morning’s glow."* The selfish desires of the human heart are like the guest qi from without, like the moon’s waning light. The true knowing of the Dao-heart is the original, upright qi, like the sun’s radiance. Gathering beneath the moon’s waning light sweeps away the selfish desires of the human heart—this is the retreat of yin. Mending the robe in morning’s glow gradually replenishes the true knowing of the Dao-heart—this is the advance of yang.

Retreat yin until not a trace of yin qi remains—only then is the waning light fully gathered. Advance yang until yang qi is utterly pure—only then is the robe fully mended. With yin spent and yang complete, one returns to the origin and reverts to the root; the original face is fully revealed. Is not the rebirth of fallen blossoms a true saying? This celestial mechanism of withered blossoms blooming anew is rarely known in the world. To know it, one must ponder its beginning and end alongside the immortals.

[Li’s Explanation]
Wu Yuan’s annotation is excellent in principle, yet it does not address the core meaning of this chapter. Here, the discussion pertains to the nurturing of the returned elixir. "Flight" refers to ascent and descent, signifying the morning advance of yang fire and the evening retreat of yin tally. "Shedding" means the elixir has taken form, leaves have fallen to return to the root—this directly points to the restoration of life.

After life is restored, one draws upon the external furnace’s metal-water, extracts lead, and replenishes mercury to nurture the spiritual embryo. As *Awakening to Reality* says: *"The external furnace’s increase and decrease require effort."* The *Triple Concordance* states: *"Observe and tend with utmost care, / Examine and adjust cold and warmth, / Cycle through the twelve nodes, / And when each ends, begin anew."* Elder Feng said: *"At midnight and noon, focus the fire’s timing; / At dawn and dusk, bathe the golden elixir in ice."* Thus it is said: *"Once shed, they bloom again at the appointed time."*

The "reblooming" refers to the branches of blossoms in the western garden below. "When the lead-flower appears, as *gui* is spent" means the great medicine of the returned elixir arises after *gui*. When lead is born, it is gathered. Gold, when far from its fullness, is unfit for tasting. Only after the initial surge of *gui*-water on the five thousand forty-eighth day does one carefully apply effort, seize the foremost treasure of the first tide—this is the supreme method.

When *gui* arises, it is the fourteenth; when *gui* is spent, it is the fifteenth—at this very moment, a single ray of yang light appears. In the human body, this is nothing other than the great movement within the great stillness. Gather and swallow it, and the returned elixir is formed. Yet once the great elixir is obtained, external lead arises anew, and the alchemist must take it for the purpose of gentle nurturing. Thus it is said: *"Once more, the western garden’s branches bloom full with flowers."*

Just as one faces the moon to gather and put away—this is the drawing of lead—so too does one turn toward the morning sun to mend the patched robe—this is the replenishing of mercury. The method of gathering requires clarity on the moon’s waxing and waning, hence the reference to "facing the moon"; the method of mending demands the use of the sun’s dawn and dusk, hence the metaphor of the "morning sun." Such are the subtle truths of the mysterious arts. These profound subtleties are rarely known in the world. Should one wish to understand them, one must seek them through careful inquiry with a realized immortal—only then may one avoid error.

**[Liu’s Verse]**
The Moon-Couch Furnace.
**[Li’s Verse]**
The Heavenly Treasure.

The rootless tree blooms in full,
Plucked from the Moon-Couch Furnace.
Prolonging life, dispelling calamity,
Best to forge good bonds and prepare the dharma-wealth.
From this, the Heavenly Treasure may be achieved—
Let the deluded masses mock my folly.

Urge the worthy to abandon cunning,
Without a wise teacher, do not force guesses.

**[Liu’s Annotation]**
The treasure of primordial true spirit is formless and imageless, without direction or place—from where, then, is it gathered to congeal the returned elixir? Though formless and imageless, without direction or place, it too has its time of blooming. When that time arrives, within the indistinct there is form; within the profound darkness, there is essence. Its essence is most true, and within it lies constancy. Its symbolic form resembles the Moon-Couch. Common practitioners, unaware of the ancients’ intent in taking this image, misidentify it as the space between the kidneys, or the bright hall between the brows, or the stubborn fleshly heart. Even worse are the demonic fabrications that point to a woman’s birth passage—gross errors, all!

What is meant by the "Moon-Couch"? It is the moon in its reclining aspect. Each month, on the third day, beneath the dark body of the southwest *kun* earth, the crescent’s light emerges, its glow reclining—hence the name "Moon-Couch." In the hexagrams, this is the faint yang beginning to arise beneath pure yin, the *Fu* hexagram. In the human being, it is the movement after extreme stillness, the birth of brightness in an empty chamber, the stirring of the heart of Heaven and Earth. Within this heart lies a single point of primordial ancestral *qi*, faintly revealing its signs from the depths of darkness, resembling the reclining light of the moon. Because this single point of ancestral *qi* is the root of Heaven and Earth, the origin of the Five Phases, it can create immortals and buddhas, forge sages and worthies, and secure both nature and life—thus it is also called the Moon-Couch Furnace.

This heart of Heaven and Earth aligns its virtue with Heaven and Earth, its brightness with the sun and moon, its order with the four seasons, and its auspices with spirits and gods—rarely encountered, difficult to meet. Should one chance upon it, the moment must not be missed. One must swiftly reach out to pluck it, seal it securely, and guard against leakage. Thus may life be prolonged and calamities dispelled. Yet such matters of prolonging life and dispelling calamity cannot be undertaken by those without great merit and conduct, nor accomplished by those lacking great resolve and strength. One must externally cultivate good affinities to refine virtue, and internally prepare dharma-wealth with sincerity—only then can one move the Imperial Ultimate and obtain the Heavenly Treasure.

Dharma-wealth is not worldly wealth, but the wealth within the dharma: single-minded devotion, true practice, and unwavering resolve—this is the good wealth. As the Perfected One of Upper Yang said: *"If Heaven resists, one must seek it with dharma-wealth and utmost sincerity. For to seek the Heavenly Treasure, one must exhaust human effort. If human effort is not exhausted, there is no dharma-wealth. Without dharma-wealth, to vainly desire the Heavenly Treasure is difficult indeed."* How can one seeking the Heavenly Treasure fail to first prepare dharma-wealth?

The Heavenly Treasure is no other thing than the golden elixir refined from true spirit, the returned elixir restored to the heart of Heaven and Earth. "True spirit" and "heart of Heaven and Earth" refer to it before refinement; "Heavenly Treasure" and "golden elixir" refer to it after refinement and maturation. Once the Heavenly Treasure is obtained, the ten thousand things are all empty, the roots and dust are transformed, and one enters the state of unknowing, without self or others—let the deluded masses mock my folly.

This folly must be transmitted orally by a wise teacher, heart to heart—it cannot be known through forced guesses. As the Immortal Elder said: *"Urge the worthy to abandon cunning; without a wise teacher, do not force guesses."* How greatly he warns later generations!

**[Li’s Explanation]**
"Blooms" refers to the jade bud’s first arising. The Moon-Couch Furnace has no fixed location in the human body, nor a fixed time, for it appears when yang *qi* first stirs, light within stillness—thus it is compared to the new moon born from extreme darkness. This moon in the sky has its *geng* direction and its third day, both with specific times and places. But in the human body, where it appears is the *geng* direction, and when it appears is the third day—it cannot be predetermined.

What is the shape of the Moon-Couch? It is as depicted in Liu’s diagram: reclining, with nine parts black and one part white, the white seen within the black, yang *qi* first arising—thus the white light appears above as the Moon-Couch. What people today describe has this shape, but it is the *upright* moon, not the *reclining* moon.

Why speak of "plucking it down"? Because its *qi* is in the void. When the alchemist sees this thread of white light, one must not rashly activate the river chariot. One should only, with a tranquil spirit and harmonious intent, gather it from where the *qi* arises—hence the phrase *"plucked from the Moon-Couch Furnace."* When spirit and *qi* unite, suddenly the yang light shines fully, like the full circle of the fifteenth day ○—this is the mid-autumn moon, the tide of *qi* at its peak. Only then does one drive it along the Yellow Path and send it to the Yellow Court. From this, life may be prolonged and calamities dispelled.

True companions of the Dharma and wealth are those of like mind who cherish the Dao, willingly offer their good fortune, protect the Dharma for others, and assist in their attainment of the Way. In *Discernments on Cultivating the Real*, Wu Yuan’s commentary on this chapter likewise interprets "Dharma-wealth" as something within the body—this is merely a corrective against greed. Speaking impartially, Dharma-wealth has two aspects: the inner Dharma-wealth, which is true gold, and the outer Dharma-wealth, which is a provisional treasure. Though borrowing the provisional to refine the true is indispensable, one should not covet it excessively.

When the celestial treasure is refined, one may feign foolishness and play the fool, holding jade within and embracing the uncarved block. Though the deluded masses may mock me as a simpleton, all such matters may be dismissed without concern. Yet how easily can one speak of refining the celestial treasure! Without encountering an enlightened teacher, one cannot know its secrets.

**Liu’s Verse:**
The Reverted Elixir ripens.

**Li’s Verse:**
The Reverted Elixir enters the mountains.
The rootless tree, its blossoms now full,
Bears fruit, its harvest complete in every flavor.
Like a crimson tangerine, round as a pellet,
Guard and defend its embankments—never neglect.
Learn the method of plants gathering their crowns,
Return to life, revert to the root, restore the origin.

**Liu’s Annotation:**
The treasure of true numen—what departs returns, what is old becomes new again, unharmed and undiminished, still the original substance—this is the fullness of the blossom. "Fullness" here speaks of the fruit’s harvest, its flavors complete. When the Golden Elixir is accomplished, the Five Phases cluster together, the Four Images harmonize, and benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust merge into one principle. Essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent return to a single *qi*. Further refined by the fire of talismans, it becomes a purely yang substance—lively and fluid, crimson as a tangerine, round as a pellet. At this time, one must guard its embankments, never neglecting vigilance in the twelve hours, concealing one’s brilliance and nurturing obscurity. Learn the method of plants gathering their crowns, return to life, revert to the root, and restore the origin, awaiting the stillness that gives rise to movement. Then, uniting with the primordial, one completes the Great Reversion Elixir. This speaks of the work of forging the Great Elixir after the Reverted Elixir is accomplished.

For the Reverted Elixir merely restores the original substance of one’s own nature—an affair of transcending the mundane. As Lü Zu said: *"With three leads, only one lead is secured; the golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to take form."* The Great Elixir, however, is the upward endeavor pursued after the Reverted Elixir—a matter of entering sagehood. As Lü Zu said: *"Reinstall the furnace, reset the crucible, ride the tiger and mount the dragon to leave the mortal realm."* If one only refines the Reverted Elixir without forging the Great Elixir, one merely completes the initial vehicle of the Dao, becoming nothing more than a whole person—how could one enter the realm of the sages?

The "selecting of a numinous site" and "establishing of a Dao hermitage" do not refer to external places but to the numinous site and Dao hermitage within. When cultivation reaches the point of reverting to the root and restoring life, the work of the Reverted Elixir is complete. Nurturing and warming it, when spirit and *qi* are abundant, the elixir becomes numinous—this is called the Numinous Elixir. From this numinous site, reinstall the furnace and reset the crucible—this is called establishing the Dao hermitage. "Selecting a numinous site" means awaiting the arising of the first yang. This first yang is the yang of primordial stillness giving rise to movement, unlike the yang of the Reverted Elixir, which arises from the postnatal to become primordial. Though both are primordial, there is a distinction of before and after. To complete the Great Reversion Elixir, one must unite with the yang within the primordial—without this, success is impossible. Thus it is said: *"Uniting with the primordial completes the Great Reversion."*

Only when the Great Elixir is accomplished does one lay the foundation of sagehood. If the Great Elixir remains unformed, it is but a halfway endeavor, not the full achievement of cultivation. As the Buddhist scriptures say: *"One who halts at the hundred-foot pole has entered but not truly arrived. Advance another step at the hundred-foot pole, and the ten directions become one’s entire body."* Does this not speak of completing the Great Reversion?

**Li’s Explanation:**
"Full" refers to the Reverted Elixir, signifying the reunion of nature and emotions. Its method lies in attaining emptiness and guarding stillness. Observe the moon’s waxing in the west—it is like the initial stirring of yang *qi*. Immediately mobilize one’s own mercury to meet it, where external contact sparks internal resonance, and internal touch evokes external response, like a magnet drawing iron. Gather it into the cinnabar field—this is the external elixir. The method is exceedingly simple and easy, so the ancient immortals said: *"It can be accomplished in less than half an hour."*

The Elixir has two grades, which may be divided into three vehicles. The methods of the three vehicles all involve gathering the lead blossom and are all called Reverted Elixirs, differing only in their scale and sequence.

The first is the initial vehicle, called the Coagulated Elixir or Jade Fluid Reverted Elixir. Within the postnatal, it returns to the primordial, departing from *gui* to take *ren*, nurturing it with jade fluid to round the inner elixir—this is the study of fulfilling one’s nature, the immortal of humanity.

The second is the superior vehicle, named the Reverted Elixir or Sevenfold Return. Using the primordial returned from the postnatal, it plants the seed of the primordial, establishing the Elixir Mother—this is the study of establishing one’s life, the immortal of earth.

The third is the great vehicle, called the Ninefold Cyclical Great Reversion Elixir. Its medicine is likened to the full moon of the fifteenth night. Within the primordial, it is primordial; when the fire arrives, it moves, transforming into white fluid. Swallowed into the abdomen, it congeals into something supremely firm—this is the Golden Fluid Reverted Elixir, most numinous and wondrous, perfecting sagehood and realizing transcendence. This is the study of uniting nature and life, the immortal of heaven.

"The blossoms now full" refers to the foundation of the superior vehicle’s elixir. Having formed one fruit and reaped one harvest, its method of refining lead involves the mutual absorption of two substances, with the Five Phases all complete—this is what is meant by "flavors complete." Though this elixir is not that of the great vehicle, it is nonetheless vividly crimson like a tangerine and perfectly round like a pellet. At this stage, one must silently attend to it, continuously preserving it as if it were always present. Otherwise, if one’s embrace is not intimate, it may easily slip away. Thus, one must guard its embankments and never neglect vigilance.

Learn the method of gathering herbs and bringing cultivation to completion—this is what the *Yi* means by "therewith wash the heart, storing it in secrecy." Returning to life, reverting to the root, and restoring the primordial—this is what the *Cantong Qi* means by "the true dwelling in whiteness, square and round within an inch."

Choose a numinous site and establish a Daoist hermitage. Wu Yuan states that the numinous site and Daoist hermitage reside within the human body, yet they also serve dual functions, inner and outer. For the inner numinous site and hermitage, one must seek clarity and stillness in the spirit terrace, with harmonious qi and spirit, and therein establish the Peaceful Hermitage of the Daoist’s heart. For the outer numinous site and hermitage, one must seek blessed mountains and auspicious lands, free from the disturbance of worldly dust, and therein establish the Thatched Hut of White Clouds for the Daoist. In this way, both the heart and its traces remain pure, true power fills to the brim, yang is born within lead, and through gathering and uniting, the Dao is accomplished in the ninefold great return—thus the sagely work is perfected.

**Liu’s Note:** The qi of true oneness.
**Li’s Note:** The place of union.

The rootless tree—its blossoms now flourishing—speaks of the rootless as though it had roots. The three talents’ apertures, the essence of the two and five: when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman unite, conception begins. How clear this is, yet when explained to you, I fear you may meet it and still fail to recognize it truly.

**Liu’s Commentary:** The treasure of the primordial true numinous, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs, still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, penetrating all—nowhere obstructed, nowhere not efficacious—this is the flourishing of the blossoms. Since the blossoms flourish, though the tree is rootless, the blossoms nonetheless have roots. What root is this? It is the aperture of the three talents—heaven, earth, and humanity—and the essence of the wondrous union of yin-yang and the Five Phases. Because it is the aperture of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, it is born prior to heaven and earth yet concealed within them afterward. One qi divides into yin and yang, and yin and yang unite to form one qi. Thus, when heaven and earth’s yin and yang above and below unite, they merge into one qi and the myriad things are born; when the sun and moon’s yin and yang come and go in union, they merge into one qi and cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman’s yin and yang unite with one another, conception begins. Observing heaven and earth, sun and moon, man and woman—only when one yin and one yang unite is there creation. From this, one may know that the Dao of nature and life cannot be completed without the union of yin and yang into one. This one qi is the root of nature and life, the aperture of life and death. With this aperture, yin and yang unite and life is born; without this qi, yin and yang turn away from one another and death ensues. Human life and death lie solely in the presence or absence of this one qi. Yet people do not know what this qi is or where it resides. Some mistake it for the qi of breath, or circulate it upward and downward in the Yellow Court, or gather it in the cinnabar field, or concentrate it between the brows, or collect it in the Celestial Valley, or amass it behind the brain—endless strange and fantastical notions, all ultimately leading to emptiness and loss. They do not realize that the primordial true oneness qi is invisible, inaudible, and intangible. The sage shapes the real through the empty, manifests the existent through the nonexistent. The real and existent are true yin and true yang; the empty and nonexistent are the qi of the two eights’ waxing and waning. When these two are juxtaposed, one qi resides in the center, congealing into the elixir—this is an endeavor of the empty void. How could it be guessed at through forms and images? How could it be sought in apertures with fixed locations? Since the Immortal Elder saw that people did not recognize this one qi, he pointed to the apertures of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, and further illustrated it through the union of heaven and earth, sun and moon, man and woman, clearly indicating this one qi to all. Yet he feared that when people encountered this one qi, they might fail to recognize it even when face to face. With boldness and at risk of censure, I, Wu Yuan, shall now vividly convey the Immortal Elder’s meaning for all to hear. Know that the primordial true oneness qi is no other thing—it is the qi of a single point of true numinosity. Because this qi is firm, strong, centered, and upright, it is called true oneness; because it is easy to know and simple in its efficacy, it is called true numinosity. True oneness and true numinosity are utterly without impurity, hence they are called primordial things. True oneness and true numinosity emerge from the same source under different names—they are not two separate things. Does anyone truly recognize this?

**Li’s Explanation:** "Flourishing" means unobstructed. The unobstructed qi emerges from the "union" in the following text. Blossoms grow from the tree, the tree grows from the root, and the root grows from nothingness—thus the rootless has roots. The rootless root is the root that generates heaven, earth, and humanity. This root is a single aperture of emptiness and nothingness, hence it is called the aperture of the three talents. This aperture is the place of essence-union, thus it is said: "the three talents’ apertures, the essence of the two and five." The two and five: heaven’s five is one five, earth’s ten is another five—thus the two and five are two earths, and when the two earths unite, the knife-point elixir is formed. The *Mud Pill* states: "The Mysterious Pass, an aperture no one knows—this is the knife-point elixir, most wondrous and rare." For the place where the two and five unite in essence is the wellspring of elixir production. The great cultivator, recognizing this empty aperture as the place of union, must be able to draw the primordial one qi from the emptiness and nothingness—how great is its function! Thus, when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman unite, conception begins—all evidence of this union. Though this principle is perfectly clear and easily understood by all, in truth, no one understands it. The Immortal Master, in his vast compassion, explains it to you: you need only unite the two qi into one mass where the two eights meet, and the great medicine will be born.

But one fears that when dragon and tiger meet, they may exhale the qi of the two bowstrings, and the elixir-refiner may fail to recognize it truly.

**Liu’s words:** The golden essence flourishes in abundance.
**Li’s words:** Recognize the golden essence.

The rootless tree, its blossoms at their finest—
facing the scene, forget emotion and admire the moon’s radiance.
When the golden essence waxes strong, its brilliance dazzles the eye;
do not, in the garden, mistakenly pluck the wrong melon.
The five metals and eight minerals are all counterfeit;
the myriad herbs and thousand formulas are all amiss.

The golden toad, the jade crow—
recognize them truly, and you are a master of the craft.

**[Liu’s annotation:]**
The primordial numinous treasure is firm and strong, upright and balanced, pure and refined—its blossoms are most excellent. At the time of their finest bloom, when the moon’s radiance unfolds, the golden essence flourishes in abundance, and one should admire it, lest it be lost before one’s eyes. These blossoms open month by month, appearing in season and not out of season, following the lunar cycle with unchanging regularity, their movement and stillness constant, not deviating by even a hair’s breadth.

The golden essence is the luminous essence of metal; in the moon, it is called the moon’s radiance; in man, it is called true essence. True essence is the essence of true numinosity, never dimmed or obscured, and thus it is likened to the moon’s radiance and the golden essence. The true numinosity of man is not easily known, yet it may be understood by observing the truth of the moon and metal; the true numinosity of man is not easily seen, yet it may be perceived in the moon’s radiance and the brilliance of metal.

The essence of all things decays with time, yet the moon’s radiance unfolds month after month, and the golden essence remains undiminished for ten thousand years. Just as the moon’s radiance and the golden essence endure, so too does man’s true essence—though at times it may seem obscured, this is only because postnatal yin qi veils it, while its original substance has never been extinguished.

When the golden essence waxes strong, it is the true essence waxing strong. When the true essence is at its peak, it illumines the world, its qi filling the cosmos—white snow flies across the sky, yellow sprouts cover the earth, golden light dazzles the eye, and wherever one turns, there are blossoms. Yet this true essence is formless and imageless, neither substance nor emptiness; it cannot be sought with intention, nor preserved with non-intention. It can only be grasped spiritually, not spoken of in words. Though it is bright and clear, fully manifest, seen by all, it is recognized by none. It is most difficult to recognize truly, and the cultivator must delve deeply into its subtleties, attaining true knowledge and penetrating insight, before daring to act—lest one mistake the false for the true, the seemingly correct for the genuinely so, and pluck the wrong melon in the garden.

Those blind practitioners of the world, who stumble in their refinement, may suspect the golden essence to be something with form and image, and thus refine the five metals and eight minerals, ingesting the myriad herbs and thousand formulas—things of a different kind from ourselves. How could they ever congeal the elixir and extend their lives? Is this not a grave error?

The toad is a creature of water, belonging to yin; yet when called *golden*, it is the yang within yin, the white within black—this is our true knowing. The crow is a creature that flies above, belonging to yang; yet when called *jade*, it is the yin within yang, the feminine within the masculine—this is our numinous knowing. Only true knowing and numinous knowing are of the same kind as ourselves, the treasures of our nature and life. Taking these two and uniting them to form the elixir, true yet utterly numinous, numinous yet utterly true—true and numinous undispersed, wholly embodying the principle of heaven—neither substance nor emptiness, neither arising nor ceasing: this is what is meant by the moon’s radiance, this is what is meant by the golden essence. When the moon’s radiance unfolds and the golden essence waxes strong, how could one not attain longevity?

Yet most people fail to recognize what true knowing and numinous knowing truly are. If one recognizes them truly, one is a seasoned master of the Dao, and there is none who does not attain the Way. Alas! In the Way of the golden elixir, a deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to a mistake of a thousand miles. How many are those who truly recognize it?

[Li’s Explanation]
"Excellent" signifies beauty, the designation for the golden flower. Alchemists call true lead the "golden flower." As the *Cantong Qi* states: "The lead’s body is black without, yet harbors a golden flower within." From this black lead, one extracts white gold and pairs it with cinnabar mercury, thereby producing the primordial qi. This is precisely the "golden flower." Returning it to oneself yields the reverted elixir, yet the reverted elixir must first be preceded by refining the self. When the self is purely refined, the reverted elixir comes easily.

One who "forgets emotion in the face of scenery" has achieved mastery in refining the self. All beautiful scenes stir no emotion; one’s sole desire is to cherish this single point of qi—this true qi, called the moon’s radiance. Why is it also named the moon’s radiance? Because the moon’s fullness serves as a gauge for the qi’s condition. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: "On the fifteenth of the eighth month, one delights in the toad’s glow—precisely when the golden essence waxes strong." This is identical in method to delighting in the moon’s radiance.

The moon begins to wax on the third day; Lu Yan likens this to tender qi. By the fifteenth, it is full; Lu Yan likens this to qi at its fullest. When qi is full, the golden essence waxes strong. The golden essence is the substance that appears within the moon’s radiance—same origin, different names. When it waxes, yellow sprouts fill the crucible, and white snow suffuses the sky. To the enlightened eye, it shines resplendent as a flower. The alchemist, wielding the sword that pierces heaven, gathers it, then applies fire at the proper time to refine the reverted elixir. This flower alone is the true prize.

One must never discard the true flower to pluck false gourds in the garden, lest one come to lament the error. Not only are gourds mistaken, but the five metals and eight stones are likewise false and not true. The myriad herbs and thousand formulas are all deviations, not the Way. What one seeks—neither false nor deviant—is this golden essence alone.

From whence does this golden essence arise? Observe the golden toad and the jade crow: these are its birthplaces. The toad, a yin creature of the water, is called "golden"—thus the true yang within Kan. The crow, a yang creature of the sky, is called "jade"—thus the true yin within Li. When true yin and true yang interact, they generate the qi of the two crescents. From the qi of the two crescents arises the true One qi. The moon’s radiance and the golden essence are both this same thing; one need only recognize it truly. If one recognizes it truly, one is a seasoned master, clear in fire times and discerning of lead.

[Liu’s Explanation]
Gathering the medicinal ingredients.

**[Li’s Words] Plucking the Yellow Flower.**
The rootless tree blooms with many flowers,
Scattered across the earth beyond the River of Love.
Hard to pluck—what can be done?
Step by step, walk into the Dragon-Tiger’s den.
Once the yellow flower is gathered and brought back to the cave,
Your name is inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.
Laughing heartily, oh white clouds,
Prepare the celestial ladder to ascend to the Great Luo.

**[Liu’s Annotation]**
Throughout the cosmos, the qi of the Dao fills all;
wherever the light of true spirit shines, there the flowers bloom—
so many, scattered across the earth.
Yet though the flowers bloom everywhere,
people fail to recognize them before their eyes,
as if blocked by a river.
Though they wish to pluck them, it is most difficult,
and they can do nothing.
The difficulty lies in this:
the world’s people are all ensnared by fame and profit,
entangled by love and attachment,
abandoning the true to grasp the false,
mistaking suffering for joy.
Step by step, they walk into the perilous lair of Dragon and Tiger,
opposing the Way of life and destiny—
thus the flowers are hard to pluck.
But if a man of courage and resolve,
a man of decisive action,
casts off worldly ties,
seeks a teacher’s oral instructions,
and cultivates the true through the false,
then among the many flowers he may select and gather
the most central and correct yellow flower,
bring it back to the cave,
nurture it into the elixir,
and prolong life.
Then his name is inscribed in the Purple Palace,
never to fade.
The yellow flower is the flower of the central earth,
the yellow realm of Wu and Ji,
the most balanced and upright of flowers,
pure vital energy without impurity.
When this vital energy returns to the cave,
spring endures through all four seasons,
as if dwelling in a nest of white clouds,
carefree and at ease—
another realm beyond the human world.
How could one not laugh heartily,
knowing such joy?
At this stage, the returned elixir is attained.
Then, setting up the furnace anew,
reestablishing the cauldron,
one undertakes the work of ascent,
preparing the celestial ladder
to become a Great Luo Heavenly Immortal.

**[Li’s Explanation]**
The innate, original substance—
the worthy do not increase it,
the foolish do not diminish it.
Everyone possesses it,
everyone is born with it—
the flowers are many indeed.
Yet they are blocked by the River of Love,
causing the original to be buried.
Though the flowers bloom across the earth,
how can they be reached when the River of Love stands between?
The River of Love is the human heart of the posterior world of desire,
which obstructs the heart of the Dao of the prior heavens.
Once the heart of the Dao is blocked,
plucking the immortal flower becomes difficult.
What, then, can be done?
The immortal master tells the seeker:
There is no other way but to search step by step,
to inquire path by path,
crossing one mountain after another,
ford one river after another,
until entering the Dragon-Tiger’s den—
only then may one see the original truth.
This Dragon emerges from fire,
this Tiger is born from water.
From the posterior heavens, they exhale the qi of the prior heavens.
The Dragon hides in yin,
the Tiger hides in yang.
When yin and yang unite,
they give birth to Dragon and Tiger.
When Dragon and Tiger unite,
they give birth to the golden flower.
This golden flower lies in the southwest, the direction of Kun.
The earth of Kun is yellow,
so its flower is also the yellow flower.
If one can gather this yellow flower,
take it back to the cave,
and congeal it into the golden elixir,
then one’s name is inscribed in the Purple Palace, never to fade.
Laughing heartily—profound mastery is self-attained.
Oh white clouds—deep abiding in tranquility.
If one wishes to advance further,
to become a Heavenly Immortal,
one must set up the furnace and cauldron anew,
erect the celestial ladder,
to ascend as a Great Luo Heavenly Immortal.
Those who aspire to become Heavenly Immortals
may prepare the celestial ladder thus.

**Fourteen**
**[Liu’s Words] Yang Arises from Yin.**
**[Li’s Words] The Cauldron Produces the Medicine.**

The rootless tree blooms with fragrant flowers,
The lead cauldron glows warmly with treasure-light.
On the golden bridge, gazing toward the winding river,
In the moon, the sun is clearly seen.
Swallow the raven’s liver and the hare’s marrow,
Replace all the dust and old intestines.
In the realm of fame and profit,
In the land of love and attachment,
Never turn back—vain is all your toil.

**[Liu’s Annotation]**
The true spirit of the prior heavens,
where all virtues gather and all goodness converges,
emits the most fragrant qi.
When its fragrance is at its peak,
it is the moment when the lead cauldron glows warmly with treasure-light.
The lead cauldron is true knowing.
With true knowing,
one can cast off the old and embrace the new,
cultivate immortality and attain the true—
hence it is called the lead cauldron.
The treasure is the treasure of true spirit;
without true knowing, true spirit does not appear.
True knowing holds the heart of the Dao,
and within the heart of the Dao lies the true One qi of the prior heavens—
this is called true spirit.
When the lead cauldron glows warmly,
it is the balance of firmness and softness,
neither biased nor partial,
and the cauldron stands firm.
When the cauldron stands firm, the heart of the Dao manifests;
when the heart of the Dao manifests, the light of true spirit gradually arises—
this is called the appearance of treasure-light.
The golden bridge is metal;
the winding river is water.
Standing on the golden bridge and gazing toward the winding river,
one sees the image of metal within water.
Metal born from water—
yang arises from yin—
this is seeing the sun within the moon,
which is also the lead cauldron glowing warmly with treasure-light.
When the cauldron’s light appears,
yin and yang unite in virtue,
spirit and qi ride the moment in harmony.
Thus one enters the womb of creation,
holding it in place and not letting it depart—
this is swallowing the raven’s liver and the hare’s marrow.
The raven’s liver is green, the essence of the sun,
symbolizing the luminous nature of spirit-knowing.
The hare’s marrow is white, the radiance of the moon,
symbolizing the true emotion of true knowing.
Swallowing the raven’s liver and the hare’s marrow,
nature does not leave emotion,
emotion does not leave nature—
true and utterly luminous,
luminous and utterly true.
Nature and emotion become one,
true spirit never obscured,
round and complete,
radiant and bright,
pure and bare,
unadorned and free.
All posterior accumulations are purged,
the heart of the Dao abides,
the human heart is forever extinguished—
all the dust and old intestines are replaced.
Once the intestines are renewed,
all things become empty.
Fame, profit, love, and attachment—
what is there to cling to?

[Li’s Explanation]
This fragrance is neither perceptible nor foul—an utterly pure and pristine fragrance, the fragrance of primordial arising, unstained by the postnatal realm.

The lead crucible is the external crucible. The method for refining lead requires establishing an external crucible in the southwest, called the "Village of Kun" or "Mother Kun." The mother’s body is inherently empty and must rely on the father Qian’s solar essence to produce lead. This solar essence is the dragon’s mercury. The dragon, as the eldest son, takes the father’s place and enters the mother’s womb, where qi and essence intermingle, and the crucible of primordial true lead is thus established. Ancestor Zhong said: *"The great yang shifts into the moon’s brightness"*—this is the method of establishing the crucible. The following line, *"Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen,"* refers to this state of gentle warmth. When the lead crucible is gently warm, the treasure-light appears. This treasure-light is the light of the life-treasure; when it emerges, it is the primordial qi, a white image reflected above the brows and eyes. Ancestor Lü said: *"The lead crucible gently warm, light pierces the curtain,"* and again: *"Examine the space between the brows—there lies the sign."* This describes the same vision.

The golden bridge is the magpie bridge below, located on the path to the southwest, where the golden qi shines. The winding river is where qi encircles the magpie bridge, its light imprinting the southwest. Some of old interpreted Ancestor Lü’s line *"On the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams pure"* as referring to the twelve curves of the small intestine—this is a descent into demonic delusion. Others have taken it to mean the space between the mouth and nose, an even graver fall into delusion. Only Master Chen Niewan said: *"On the southwest path, the moon’s radiance shines bright; the great medicine is born from this place. I recall an ancient verse: ‘Above the winding river, the magpie bridge spans.’"* This truly grasps the essence.

Why is this so? The southwest corresponds to *kun*, and *kun* governs the abdomen. Where the precious light appears, the moon’s radiance shines bright; where the moon’s radiance shines bright, the golden *qi* emerges. Thus, upon the golden bridge, one gazes upon the winding river, where the moon above the river shines directly upon the golden bridge.

The moon’s radiance gleams resplendent, and within yin, yang is born—hence the saying: *"Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen."* The sun is *taiyang*. The three-legged crow within the sun is the essence of the sun. To swallow the crow’s liver is to ingest the solar essence of the eastern direction; to consume the hare’s marrow is to partake of the moon’s radiance from the western direction. When essence and radiance are combined in ingestion, the great medicine is born. When sun and moon are both swallowed, the golden elixir takes form—thus the line: *"Swallow the crow’s liver and hare’s marrow, and the dust-laden old intestines are wholly transformed."*

What further attachment to love, fame, or profit could disturb this pure heart? Why turn back in thought, only to waste the day in vain? On the fifteenth, [Liu Yan] tends the furnace and applies the work.

[Li Yan] speaks of the work of *wenyang*—nurturing and refining.

The rootless tree bears flowers most fresh,
As talismanic fire sears mercury and lead.
At the furnace’s edge, visions arise—
Gathering all depends on the Dharma-boat.
The master’s hand, firm at the helm,
Lets the great waves churn the sea’s depths.

Cross the Three Passes, pierce the Mud Pill.
Early on, the nine apertures of the body are all opened.

[Liu’s Commentary]
The treasure of true love, once worldly dust is shed,
Becomes utterly pure and clear—how could its flowers not bloom fresh?
Yet their freshness depends entirely on the work of talismanic fire searing lead and mercury.
True numinosity is the essence of true knowing and numinous knowing;
True knowing and numinous knowing are the functions of true numinosity.
True numinosity divides into true knowing and numinous knowing;
True knowing and numinous knowing unite to form true numinosity.
To refine the lead of true knowing and the mercury of numinous knowing
Is to refine true numinosity itself.
Refining means using true knowing to govern numinous knowing,
And numinous knowing to align with true knowing.
When true knowing and numinous knowing congeal,
They restore the treasure of true numinosity—
The freshness of its flowers defies description.

Yet while true numinosity is easily formed, the firing times are most difficult.
As Master Ziyang said:
*“Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the firing times, it is all in vain.
The work depends entirely on the power of cultivation—
A hair’s breadth off, and the elixir will not form.”*

The Dao of the golden elixir requires gathering the medicine at the proper time
And refining it with the proper method.
Without knowing the time or the method,
Even if the great medicine is in sight, it will not be yours.
Thus, at the moment of tending the furnace,
Amidst the indistinct, forms appear;
Within the profound darkness, essence arises.
A single spark of true numinosity’s light
Emerges from the formless—
Seeming to exist, yet not existing;
Neither form nor emptiness.
Visions manifest—this is the moment the great medicine is born.

At this time, the Three Corpses, Six Thieves,
The Five Aggregates, and the Seven Emotions—
All manner of illusory visions—
May also appear before you.
You must steady the Dharma-boat,
Firmly grasp the helm,
Forget the visions, and remain unmoved,
Letting the waves churn the sea’s depths without wavering.
Through such effort, gradually gathering and refining,
Nurturing yang and restraining yin,
The longer you persist, the stronger the work becomes.
When the work is complete,
Essence transforms into qi,
Qi transforms into spirit,
Spirit transforms into emptiness.
Crossing these Three Passes,
The wind stirs in the Mud Pill,
The Dharma-body manifests—
And the yin qi of the body’s nine apertures is all transmuted.

The Three Passes are not the lower, middle, and upper *dantian* of the alchemical tradition,
But the three passes of refining essence, qi, and spirit:
Refining essence into qi is the first pass,
Refining qi into spirit is the middle pass,
Refining spirit into emptiness is the upper pass.
Crossing these Three Passes, spirit merges with the Great Void,
Moving freely without obstruction—
This is called piercing the Mud Pill,
For the Mud Pill Palace is where spirit is stored.
The nine apertures belong to the illusory body,
But once the Three Passes are crossed and the Mud Pill is pierced,
The Dharma-body is perfected.
The yin qi of the illusory body’s hundred channels and nine apertures
Is transformed into yang qi,
And every aperture shines with light—
Even the million and four thousand hairs
Become guardian spirits.
Students must not let words obscure the meaning.

[Li’s Explanation]
This chapter speaks of *wenyang*—nurturing and refining.
Wu Yuan’s interpretation—that crossing the Three Passes, piercing the Mud Pill, and opening the nine apertures refers not to the lower, middle, and upper *dantian* but to the three refinements after which spirit merges with the Void, moving freely, and the illusory body’s nine apertures all shine with light—is correct.
However, the preceding lines must be understood in the context of *wenyang*.
Otherwise, the stages of entering the chamber to return the elixir,
Nurturing the embryo, and shedding the husk
Would all be jumbled together,
Which does not align with the immortal masters’ intent of explaining each stage in turn.
Thus, this passage refers solely to *wenyang*.

“Fresh” means radiant—
The sign of deep *wenyang* work,
Renewing day by day, flourishing month by month.
“Talismanic fire” refers to the cyclical firing times:
At dawn, advancing the yang fire;
At dusk, retreating the yin talisman.
The *zi* hour is when yang is born, and fire should be advanced at *zi*,
But by dawn, it is the *yin* hour—
Why advance fire at *yin* instead of *zi*?
Because fire is born in *yin*, where yang qi flourishes,
So fire is advanced at this time.
The *wu* hour is when yin is born, and the talisman should be retreated at *wu*,
But by dusk, it is the *xu* hour—
Why retreat the talisman at *xu* instead of *wu*?
Because fire is stored in *xu*, where yin qi is concealed,
So the talisman is retreated at this time.
Retreating the talisman replenishes mercury;
Advancing fire draws out lead.
Lead governs mercury,
Mercury embraces lead—
Lead diminishes day by day, while mercury increases,
Hence the line: *“Talismanic fire sears mercury and lead.”*

“Tending the furnace” refers to the external furnace,
Not the furnace used when entering the chamber.
When entering the chamber to refine lead, a crucible is necessary,
But in *wenyang*, only the furnace is used, not the crucible.
Yet the furnace may be external or internal.
As Ziyang said:
*“Within, there is the natural true fire,
In the furnace, ever blazing bright red.”*
This is the internal furnace.
He also said:
*“For the external furnace, diligence in increasing and decreasing is key—
Nothing surpasses the true seed.”*
This is the external furnace.

At the furnace’s edge, wondrous visions appear—
Not the radiance of the treasure,
Nor illusory visions,
But the civil fire within and the martial fire without.
Civil and martial fires refine,
Gradually gathering, gradually adding.
The work of *wenyang* must not be interrupted.
It depends entirely on the Dharma-boat and the master’s hand,
Unshaken by wind or waves,
Undisturbed in its primal work.
Then the Dharma-boat sails boundlessly,
Coming and going without cease—
Like Bodhidharma carrying gold across the sea,
Directly reaching the other shore.
Hence the lines:
*“Gathering all depends on the Dharma-boat,
The master’s hand, firm at the helm,
Letting the great waves churn the sea’s depths.”*

The final three lines are already clarified in Liu’s commentary;
No further explanation is needed.

Sixteen
[Liu’s Note] Recognize true lead.
[Li’s Note] The singular true lead.

The rootless tree, its blossoms in full bloom—
Recognize true lead as the primal ancestor.
Essence, qi, spirit—one crucible refines,
Woman transforms to man, the old to youth.

To seize the White Tiger in the west,
First tame the Green Dragon in the east.
Like attracts like—strive well:
When the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.

[Liu’s Annotation]
“In full bloom” speaks of luxuriance and abundance. Amidst the flourishing blossoms, good and bad, partial and true, mingle together. Only the true immortal blossom may be gathered and used. What is this true immortal blossom? It is true lead. This lead is the true emotion of true knowing, the manifestation of true numen. As true knowing is outwardly yin and inwardly yang—outwardly black, inwardly white—it is called true lead, or “gold within water,” or “lead of the watery realm,” or “flower within the moon.” Its names are manifold, yet all denote this single thing: true knowing. Only this true knowing contains the primordial true unity’s initial qi, the root of yin and yang, the source of the Five Phases, the seed of immortals and buddhas, the lineage of sages and worthies—the true primal ancestor of all who cultivate the Dao.

Once the ancestor is recognized and brought home, revered and upheld without a moment’s separation, essence, qi, and spirit naturally gather in the crucible, without need for force. For when the father returns, where would the child go? With the added work of talismanic fire and refinement, even a woman may transform into a man, even the old may become youthful. “Woman transforms to man” does not mean the body changes form; rather, a woman, being purely yin, through cultivation and refinement, transmutes yin into yang, becoming like a man. “The old become youthful” does not mean the face regains youth; rather, the old, their qi withered, through cultivation and refinement, return to the root and revert to the origin, becoming like a child.

Yet the way of woman transforming to man and the old becoming youthful, though it begins with recognizing true lead and true knowing, also requires first mastering the refinement of the self. If the refinement of the self is not thorough, true knowing will not come; even if it comes, it will not stay. Thus it is said: *“To lead the White Tiger from the western garden, first subdue the Green Dragon in the eastern home.”* The White Tiger belongs to the west and metal, symbolizing true emotion; the Green Dragon belongs to the east and wood, symbolizing true nature. True emotion and true nature are originally one family—why the need to lead or subdue? Because after their entanglement in the postnatal, the true is mixed with the false: true emotion becomes false emotion, kindness tinged with harm. Like a tiger leaving its den, it rushes west to wound others, no longer belonging to me but dwelling in another’s home.

Once true emotion becomes false, true nature is obscured and likewise turns false. The false takes charge, the true retreats, and nature and emotion fall out of harmony—like the dragon in the east and the tiger in the west, never meeting. To restore the true, one must first dispel the false; to lead emotion, one must first harmonize nature. Harmonizing nature is the work of refining the self. Refining the self means refining the nature of one’s temperament. When the nature of temperament is transformed, true nature naturally appears. With true nature manifest, unshaken and unmoved, true emotion also emerges. When true emotion emerges, false emotion does not arise, and the White Tiger may be led back to pair with the Green Dragon, emotion and nature entwined in love.

The White Tiger is the primal ancestor of true lead, differing only in name. Because true knowing is unyielding and strong, it is called the White Tiger; because true knowing is soft yet conceals strength within, it is called true lead. To lead the White Tiger is to gather true lead. “Leading” here is not by force but a leading without leading—when nature is settled, emotion naturally returns. This is simply the way of like attracting like, the resonance of yin and yang within and without. Nature presides within and belongs to yin—the inner medicine; emotion operates without and belongs to yang—the outer medicine. Yin and yang are originally one qi, nature and emotion share the same root. When the inner medicine flows, the outer medicine cannot but flow. Inner and outer in harmony, nature seeks emotion and emotion longs for nature. When nature and emotion unite, true numen congeals, and the symbol of the returned elixir appears.

The Pure Yang Elder said: *“When nature abides, qi naturally returns; when qi returns, the elixir naturally forms.”* The Purple Yang Elder said: *“To refine the ninefold transmutation, first refine the self and hold fast to the heart.”* Both speak of the necessity of refining the self before the elixir may return.

Alas! True lead is easy to gather, but refining the self is most difficult—the work of refining the self is truly great!

[Li’s Explanation]
“In full bloom” speaks of the intensity of emotion. Lead is the true lead within a person. When true lead manifests, its emotion is most intense. Simply recognize the true and gather it, and the golden elixir is immediately accomplished. For this true lead is the embodiment of the central yellow and upright position, the primal ancestor of the great elixir. Gather it to restrain mercury, and the three families meet to form the immortal infant. Extending this, thousands upon thousands, generations of descendants all trace their lineage to this true lead. Thus it is called the primal ancestor.

“Essence, qi, spirit—one crucible refines” describes the state after lead returns and mercury is subdued, the three families meeting. Yet to forge true lead, there is first the wondrous art of woman transforming to man and the old becoming youthful. The fire of the Li Palace is true essence; the water of the Kan Palace is true qi; between Kan and Li, there is the wondrous earth at work—true spirit, also called true intent. When qi and essence interact, with spirit presiding, gold is born in the water, mercury descends in the fire. With spirit maintaining balance, regulating excess and deficiency, through fierce refinement, the fire steams and the water boils, and gold rises with the water—this is the power of essence, qi, and spirit refined in one crucible.

When it enters the Li Palace, the fire of Li is extinguished by the water of Kan. It does not fly or flee. Qi is stabilized by spirit, essence is congealed by spirit. Lead and mercury both die, returning together to the fertile earth. The three families meet in the central palace, refined into a single purple golden elixir—this is the wondrous work of essence, qi, and spirit refined in one crucible.

When first the Eastern House’s son entrusted his form to the West, the Western Dui became the true Maiden, the Maiden acting in place of Mother Kun. Within the female crucible appeared the Thunder Male—thus the female transformed into male. This male is called the Third Lord of the Nine, young in years, truly the Dao Father of Wood Duke incarnate in the womb of the child. Hence Wood Duke is renamed the Duke’s Son, the old transformed into the youthful.

This Duke’s Son rides a white tiger, roaming the Western lands with fierce might. Once a Daoist saw and asked him, “You, the tiger-riding youth—are you the transformation of Wood Duke?” The youth, knowing the man’s heart held true awakening, dared not conceal the truth and answered, “Yes.” The Daoist then turned and laughed, saying, “The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor. Master Cui’s words are true indeed.”

Now, to summon back the Duke’s Son, one must first capture his white tiger, for the white tiger is the steed formed from the youth’s primordial qi. If you wish to journey west to seize the white tiger, you must first subdue the green dragon in the Eastern House. For the white tiger is the nature of metal; the green dragon is the nature of wood. When wood interacts with metal, fire arises within wood, and fire in turn compels metal to return. When metal merges with wood, water surges within metal, and water in turn extinguishes fire to stabilize it. These four, though distinct, are in truth the same—different in kind yet alike in essence.

Since they are of the same kind, employ your mysterious skill to bring them together. Thus, inner and outer unite, outer returns to inner submission, and when the outer medicine connects with the inner, the inner medicine likewise connects with the outer. This passage speaks only of true lead, not of true mercury, for where there is lead, there is mercury—though mercury is unspoken, it resides within. Hence it is said, “When the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.”

Lead, qi, male, youth, tiger—all are outer medicine. Essence, female, elder, dragon—all are inner medicine. As for spirit, it abides between the inner and outer essence and qi.

Ascending cloud-laden skies, roaming free at will,
Sin, filth, and mundane dust—all erased with one stroke.

[Liu’s Annotation] The true spirit lies concealed within the postnatal, obscured by accumulated habits and guest qi. Its blossom is most difficult to unfold. Occasionally, when it does emerge, a single gleam of radiance pierces through the void—like a pearl, like dew—tender, delicate, and exquisitely fair. Its appearance is most fragile, as if opening yet not fully open. The primal qi, undifferentiated and whole, in heaven responds to the stars’ brightness (though not yet full), and on earth to the soil’s moisture (though not yet damp). The brightness of stars and the dampness of earth are both signs of yang qi’s initial stirring.

When yang qi first stirs, it is the tender moment of the true spirit’s blossom. At this very instant of fragility, the conscious mind may seize upon the spirit’s light to spawn delusion, scattering nature and shifting emotion. One must swiftly apply fierce firing and rapid refinement, nip deviations in the bud, and guard against subtle errors—nurturing yang while suppressing yin—to protect the treasure of life.

The dragon-slaying sword serves to curb the temper of qi; the tiger-binding cord serves to restrain delusive emotions. When the temper of qi does not flare, the true spirit manifests; when delusive emotions do not arise, true feeling is born. With true nature revealed and true feeling born, one revolves the Northern Asterism’s pivot and turns the Big Dipper’s handle, transforming killing into life and converting punishment into virtue. Thus can one forge and refine a crucible of true sun and moon.

The sun is the image of yang containing yin, an analogy for the numinous awareness inherent in true nature. This awareness is the female within the male, true yin. The moon is the image of yin containing yang, an analogy for the true knowing inherent in true feeling. This knowing is the white within the black, true yang. Forging and refining true yin and true yang—these two great medicines—returns them to a single qi, which congeals into the elixir. Swallowed and ingested, it extends life and reverses destiny.

This is the most sublime and wondrous Dao, not one of the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths that cling to emptiness or fixate on forms. For when the great Dao is accomplished, one ascends cloud-laden skies and roams freely at will, and all sins, filth, and mundane dust are erased with a single stroke. Those three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, however, merely tinker with the stinking skin-bag, only inviting more sins, filth, and mundane dust—how could they ever erase them?

[Li’s Exegesis] “Fair” describes the tender delicacy of the moment when the first yang sprouts. Heaven corresponds to the upper, earth to the lower. At the time of yang’s birth, a flicker of starlight appears above the brows (the ancients called this “heaven responding to the stars”), and a vast tidal qi surges within the abdomen (the ancients called this “earth responding to the tide”). Such are the signs of the medicine’s arising—this is no falsehood.

Master Wuyuan likened the stars’ brilliance in heaven and the dampness of earth to the initial stirring of yang qi, neither full nor moist, which is also a valid interpretation. Others cite *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine*, where “heaven responding to the stars” refers to the upper magpie bridge, and “earth responding to the tide” to the lower magpie bridge—both hold profound principles. Yet I have privately heard that “responding to stars” and “responding to the tide” pertain to aligning with the moon and the hour: the stars awaken one to the moon, the tide to the time. This is precisely the crucial firing timing of the great returning elixir.

I excerpt a few lines from the *Cantong Qi* as corroboration:
*“The metal reckoning is fifteen,
The water number is the same.”*

Before the furnace, fix the weight in two *zhu*,
Five parts water remain in excess.
When these two are taken as true,
The gold’s weight returns to its origin.
If the third enters, it will not do—
Two parts fire must accompany it.”

This is the true meaning of “responding to stars” and “responding to the tide.” The gold must weigh fifteen *liang* precisely because it aligns with the moon’s number, signifying the full vigor of metal’s essence. Over 5,048 days, the celestial *qi* first reaches completion, and fifteen *liang* of gold can generate fifteen parts of water—this corresponds to the first fifteen days of the lunar month. The water’s number matches the gold’s number, just as the tide’s number aligns with the stars’. If gold and water are insufficient, true water will not arise; this is what is meant by “heaven not responding to stars, earth not responding to the tide.” How then can one fix the weights?

To truly respond to stars and tide, take the first fifteen days of the lunar month as the standard. From new moon to full, count one and a half days as one part. Two such periods—three days—usher in *geng*. Only then does two parts of true water emerge: heaven responds to stars, earth to the tide. By the fifth day, it becomes three parts—three parts are unusable. By the eighth day, it reaches five parts—five parts are excessive. Neither aligns with the stars or tide.

Only when two parts of water are paired with two parts of fire does true alignment occur—this is the authentic response to stars and tide, the true sign of *kan* water. When gold first generates water, at precisely two parts, the source is utterly pure, possessing *qi* but no form: this is the *White Tiger’s* first channel. As the tiger exhales its breath, the dragon meets it with two parts of true fire, refining it into the elixir’s foundation.

As for the gold that generates two parts of water, it must wait until the fifteenth day, when the metal’s essence peaks and the water’s tide arises. This is the “two sevens’ period,” when true lead first descends—this is responding to stars and tide.

Some may ask: *Why must the fire be precisely two parts?*
Answer: In one hour’s work, divided into three *fu* and six *hou*, only one *fu* and two *hou* of fire are used. Thus, dragon and tiger remain balanced, devouring and being devoured in turn. At the critical moment, one must wield the sword to subdue the dragon and grasp the cord to tame the tiger. Circulating the *gang* and turning the Dipper, returning to the central palace, the sun and moon conjoin their essences. Refining and tempering them, the true Way is attained.

My teacher from Wuyi Mountain offers an even more precise and illuminating explanation, which I now detail here.

*Qian* heaven is yang; stars are heaven’s fire essence, yang within yin. *Kun* earth is yin; tides are earth’s water *qi*, yin within yang. Essence is the father of fire, *qi* the mother of water. When *Qian*-father and *Kun*-mother unite, *li* fire and *kan* water are born. Thus it is said: “Heaven responds to stars, earth responds to the tide.” “Responding” denotes the mutual resonance between them.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
*“Without stars and moon,
How could water be gathered?”*
From this, we know that when heaven’s light illumines earth, it responds with stars; when earth’s *qi* bears heaven, it responds with tides.

The immortals liken heaven’s stars to the fire within the human heart—fire is one’s nature, and nature belongs to the dragon. If it does not descend, the stars scatter and fire disperses. Thus, one must wield the dragon-slaying sword to subdue it; the sword represents great wisdom. They liken earth’s tides to the water within the human body—water is one’s emotions, and emotions belong to the tiger. If it is not tamed, the tide overflows and water flows unchecked. Thus, one must grasp the tiger-binding cord to subdue it; the cord represents great insight.

Great skill appears clumsy; great wisdom seems foolish. When insight and wisdom merge into darkness, the wondrous mind arises. To turn the *gang* and wield the Dipper’s handle requires the wondrous mind’s power.

The *gang* is the Northern Dipper. The Dipper governs life, residing in its handle. Wherever the handle points, life-giving *qi* arises. The human body’s wondrous mind, by moving the Dipper’s handle, can transform killing into life. As the Dipper’s handle revolves, the golden elixir enters within. When the golden elixir enters, the wondrous mind returns to me.

The wondrous mind is the true body, neither born nor destroyed, its virtue merging with heaven and earth, its brightness uniting with sun and moon—it is the true sun and moon within the human body. To seek the wondrous mind, one must return from the postnatal to the prenatal. First, cause the external sun and moon to exchange their light externally, mastering the firing times and understanding the *fu* and *ke*. Only then can it be attained. Upon its return, the internal sun and moon must exchange their light internally, shining ceaselessly day and night. By harmonizing and nurturing them, one forges a furnace of true sun and moon.

This is the wondrous secret of the golden elixir’s great Way, the profound mystery of the seven returns and nine refinements. It sweeps away the 3,600 side paths, allowing one to ascend the clouds and roam freely, erasing all karmic dust and worldly filth in a single stroke. Without understanding this great Way, there will never be a day of liberation. Karmic dust and worldly filth will only accumulate—how can one fail to awaken?

**[Liu’s Note]** Reverse the mechanism of *qi*.
**[Li’s Note]** Skillfully employ the art of theft.

The rootless tree’s flowers bloom high,
Ocean waves surge as the moon plays with the tide.
The Silver River’s path pierces the nine skies,
The raft’s shadow spans the void, striking the Dipper’s tip.
Touching the Weaving Maid’s loom stone,
Treading the Cowherd’s magpie bridge,
Entering the immortal court with bold courage,
Stealing the Queen Mother’s peaches from Jasper Pool.

**[Liu’s Commentary]**
The primordial great Way encompasses heaven and earth, governs the movement of sun and moon, and transcends all existence. Its flowers bloom so high they resemble the moon in the sky, its light reaching the ocean’s depths. Though ocean waves surge to the heavens, water cannot drown the moon’s light—instead, the moon plays with the tide. This is like a person in the sea of suffering: circumstances cannot harm their true nature but instead refine it through adversity.

Again, the Silver River’s path is distant, piercing the nine skies, yet humans cannot easily cross it. However, with a celestial raft spanning the void and turning the Dipper’s handle, one can traverse it. In ancient times, Zhang Qian rode such a raft across the Silver River and witnessed the Cowherd and Weaving Maid stars meeting—this serves as proof.

In terms of principle, the world also possesses its celestial raft, capable of crossing the Silver River. What, then, is this worldly celestial raft? It is none other than the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir operates within the void, capable of revolving heaven and earth, reversing yin and yang, seizing the workings of creation, and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood—this is the celestial raft. Yet the marvel of the celestial raft lies in the manipulation of the Dipper’s handle. The Dipper’s handle is the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, Yaoguang, also called the Celestial Stem. Where the Celestial Stem points is auspicious, where it rests is inauspicious, for where it points, the qi of life resides. In the instant the Dipper’s handle is turned back, yin and yang unite, and the sprouts of life emerge effortlessly—hence the saying: *“Grasp the Weaving Maid’s shuttle stone, tread the Cowherd’s magpie bridge.”* The Weaving Maid belongs to yin, the Cowherd to yang; the magpie bridge is where the Cowherd and Weaving Maid meet. By grasping the shuttle stone and treading the magpie bridge, yin summons yang, and yang comes to meet yin—when yin and yang unite, the Golden Elixir takes form. This principle is enacted within the waves, its workings performed in the void, enabling one to enter the ranks of immortals, with boldness of spirit, and steal the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches. The Jasper Pool lies in the west, and the Queen Mother is the ancient yin, the Mother of Earth. The peach is the Elixir, the single yang of the *Zhen* trigram. The Queen Mother’s peach is the image of *Kun* nurturing *Zhen* within; the Elixir resides in the west, but when stolen and returned to the east, it becomes one’s own, and the Elixir is restored. Yet the marvel of this restored Elixir lies in the union of yin and yang, and the marvel of their union lies in reversing the qi mechanism amidst the waves of the great sea, unmoving and unshaken. To remain unmoving and unshaken amidst the waves of the great sea is the mark of a man of bold spirit—what heaven among the nine skies cannot be ascended? What Silver River cannot be crossed? What Queen Mother’s peaches cannot be stolen? Those who cultivate stillness and forget form, acting only within quiescence, how could they know of this?

*[Li’s Explanation]*
"High" refers to the void. The surging waves of the sea are what Master Ziyang called the time when "the winds and waves are fierce, and the Mysterious Pearl is born." As the wind rises and waves surge, their sound shakes the void—hence "surging to the heavens." Yet the Mysterious Pearl, like a round autumn moon, appears upon the sea—thus "the moon plays with the tide." To reverse the flow of the Silver River and pierce the nine skies is like Zhang Qian riding the raft, its shadow spanning the void, the qi mechanism reaching its apex. Yet for the river raft to advance, there must first be guidance, lest the waters overflow their course and stray from the river’s path—this is why the Dipper’s handle serves as the mooring. The word "moor" is most apt: for mortals, mooring a boat means resting for the night, but for the immortal’s river raft, the Dipper’s handle is the anchor. To proceed straight and true, one cannot moor—yet to speak of "mooring the Dipper’s handle" is precisely to moor where one cannot, where one must not, mooring upon the Dipper’s handle. Following the Dipper’s revolution, movement contains stillness, death gives way to life—just as heroes and bold men act with unbridled resolve, their sails catching the wind without mooring, for this is the moment of grand resolution and great opportunity. Not mooring surpasses mooring, and mooring is as good as not mooring—such is the meaning of "mooring the Dipper’s handle."

The Weaving Maid and the Cowherd are the celestial yin and yang stars, meeting once a year on the seventh night of the seventh month. The Weaving Maid belongs to yin, the shuttle stone likened to mercury; the Cowherd belongs to yang, the magpie bridge the place where the Cowherd and Weaving Maid meet, the direction where gold and mercury unite. Above, the Dipper’s handle is mentioned; here, the Cowherd and Weaving Maid—thus the Dipper serves as their matchmaker. Without the Dipper, the Cowherd cannot meet the Weaving Maid; when the Dipper turns, the Cowherd crosses the river, and gold unites with mercury. As Ancestor Lü said: *“The work of advancing fire lies in the peril of the Cowherd and Dipper,”* and Niwan said: *“The marvel lies in the tail, the winnowing basket, the Dipper, the Weaving Maid, and the Cowherd,”*—both express this same idea. To grasp the shuttle stone is to have mercury receive lead; to tread the magpie bridge is to have lead and mercury travel the same path. From this, one’s heavenly fate is secured, and one’s aspirations can be fulfilled—one may encounter the immortal ranks and become bold of spirit. Why is this? Because one has stolen the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches. Wuyuan’s explanation—that the Jasper Pool lies in the west, the Queen Mother is the Mother of Earth, the peach is the image of *Kun* nurturing *Zhen* within, and the Elixir in the west is stolen and returned to the east to form the restored Elixir—is clear, yet the word "steal" is not as vivid as "thieve." To thieve the peach from the east is one matter; the *Kan* trigram as thief is another. To thieve the peach from the east is to go to the west to obtain gold; the *Kan* trigram as thief is to seek lead from the depths of water. How marvelous is the meaning of "thieve"!

*[Liu’s Words]*
Yin and yang wrestle and congeal.

*[Li’s Words]*
Giving birth to the Mysterious Pearl.

The Rootless Tree,
its flowers in full bloom,
Dragon and Tiger mount the altar for battle.
Lead enters mercury,
yin and yang unite,
the image of the Mysterious Pearl is priceless.
This is the true seed of one’s homeland,
restoring youth and prolonging life.
Ascend to heaven,
to the Land of Ultimate Bliss,
and escape the wheel of rebirth to meet King Yama.

*[Liu’s Annotation]*
The Golden Elixir is the image formed by the clash of yin and yang—thus the flowers must be in pairs to be of use. Yin and yang are the Dragon and the Tiger, lead and mercury. The Dragon is true nature, mercury is numinous awareness, also called the primordial spirit, both belonging to yin; the Tiger is true emotion, lead is true knowledge, also called the primordial essence, both belonging to yang. The Dragon and Tiger battling is the gathering of nature and emotion. Lead entering mercury is the congealing of spirit and essence. When nature and emotion gather, spirit and essence congeal, yin and yang unite, and the single qi blends—true numinosity becomes perfectly luminous, the Dharma-body takes form, round and resplendent, like a single Mysterious Pearl, a priceless treasure.

This treasure is no external object—it is the true seed of one’s own homeland, originally inherent, yet lost without trace after mingling with the postnatal. Now, with yin and yang harmonized, what was nonexistent is restored, what had departed returns. Planted in the homeland, with the root established the Way arises, generating endlessly, reversing aging to regain youth, extending life without limit, ascending to the heavenly realm of ultimate bliss, and escaping the suffering of rebirth.

[Li’s Exegesis]
The "pair" refers to the qi of the two crescents. When the qi of the two crescents unite, Dragon and Tiger mount the altar, mutually devouring and reflecting. "Battle" signifies this devouring. After a great struggle, Dragon and Tiger reach equilibrium: when the Tiger battles the Dragon, lead is cast into mercury; when the Dragon battles the Tiger, yin is matched with yang. When yang-lead and yin-mercury merge, this priceless treasure is born. As the *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"Tiger leaps, Dragon soars—waves surge rough,
At the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born."*
The Mysterious Pearl is the primordial singular qi, the original source of immortals and buddhas, the true seed of one’s own homeland, not an external thing. Veiled by the postnatal, it long ceased to manifest. Now, within the Dragon-Tiger altar, yin-mercury and yang-lead unite as true husband and wife, returning from within postnatal Kan and Li to the prenatal. Thus it is said: *"The Dharma-image of the Mysterious Pearl is beyond price."* From this true seed of the homeland, those who obtain it reverse aging to regain youth, prolong life, ascend to heaven, attain ultimate bliss, and escape the wheel of rebirth to avoid facing King Yama.

This speaks of the method of Dragon and Tiger, yin and yang, battling and uniting—one must seek its firing times in the annotation to the chapter *"When the Flower Is Most Radiant."*

[Liu’s Note]
The Elixir of Return is achieved in a single moment.

[Li’s Note]
The Returned Elixir’s nurturing and refinement.

The rootless tree—its blossoms most wondrous,
Cultivated in moonlight for but a fleeting moment.
With hands that seize the clouds, one ascends the cloud-ladder,
Plucking the first branch of the prenatal.

Drinking wine and wearing flowers, the spirit soars bright,
Laughing at the immortal elders sunk in drunken mud.
Entrusting the knowing heart, guarding with care,
Ever fearful the furnace’s firing time may flee.

[Liu’s Annotation]
The prenatal true numen, though nonbeing, gives rise to being;
though incomplete, it achieves wholeness—its blossoms most wondrous.
Yet what makes it wondrous is this: the prenatal, veiled by the postnatal,
vanishes without trace. Should one wish to cultivate it,
in but a fleeting moment it revives spring.
The marvel of this revival lies in plucking the first branch’s blossom.
The first branch is the ancestral qi of all life,
the numinous root that gives birth to heaven, earth, and humankind.
It does not fall into form, nor into emptiness;
concealed, it is true emptiness; manifest, it is wondrous being.
Utterly centered, utterly upright, utterly refined, utterly pure,
it flickers in the indistinct and obscure, like dew, like lightning.
It cannot be sought with intent, nor held with non-intent.
Sought with intent, one clings to appearances;
held with non-intent, one clings to emptiness.
It lies in settling the nature and forgetting the passions,
turning the light inward in reflection,
emptying to the utmost, stilling to the profound.
Not plucking, yet plucking; not taking, yet taking—
naturally, the true unity of the prenatal qi
arises from the formless,
congealing into a pearl like a grain of millet.
Within and without, radiant with light,
as if wearing immortal blossoms,
the spirit soars unimpeded, as if drinking immortal wine.
Wearing blossoms, drinking wine—joy abounds therein,
unaware, unknowing, following the decree of the Lord.
One enters the realm of intoxication.

At this moment, the Returned Elixir has formed,
and the face of one’s birth-mother is seen anew.
No need for external furnace adjustments—
hasten to the inner furnace’s nurturing and refinement.
The numinous works in silence,
guarding with vigilance, the intent undivided,
ever watchful lest the firing time err.
The "knowing heart" is not an external knower,
but the heart that knows itself within.
The firing time’s swiftness or slowness, the heart knows of itself.
Knowing yet not deluded, the firing time does not err,
and the Golden Elixir ripens.

[Li’s Exegesis]
"Wondrous" means beyond human fathoming.
Not only humans cannot fathom it—
even yin and yang cannot fathom it.

If one could fathom it, then yin and yang would fail, intermingling in boundless obscurity—how then could one cultivate the primordial? That which is cultivated in the moon’s embrace: on the third day, when *geng* emerges, the medicinal substance is fresh and tender. Within this *geng* phase of the moon, one cultivates the golden flower, blending two parts fire with two parts water, stewing in primordial chaos for a moment—only then does the first primordial sprout emerge within the crucible. This is the work of a fleeting instant.

In that instant, when the first primordial sprout truly appears, the wondrous heart takes charge, immediately reversing the celestial pivot, soaring back across the Milky Way—this is the hand that grasps the clouds, the ladder that ascends them, the gathering of the first primordial sprout. The drinker of wine drinks this first immortal brew, and the primordial transforms into white nectar. The wearer of flowers dons this first immortal blossom, and the primordial returns with vernal yang. Flower is wine, wine is flower; to drink it and wear it is to have wine as one’s good companion and flower as one’s dear friend. The spirit and qi surge in harmony, utterly intoxicated—hence it is said, *"Drink wine, wear flowers, the spirit soars bright; the immortal elder laughs, drunk as mud."*

The "knowing heart" is the heart in accord, the wondrous heart within oneself. Vigilant guarding means observing the firing time with this wondrous heart. Yet guarding entails several aspects, and the furnace fire has two phases: if the firing time is insufficient, one withdraws and supplements with *zhun* and *meng* to protect it, requiring external furnace adjustments; if the firing time is complete, one guards it day and night with contained radiance, needing no external furnace adjustments. When the ten-month count is full and nine years have passed, the true person emerges from the crown of the head.

Otherwise, if the external furnace is removed prematurely when it should not be, the firing time will be insufficient and the elixir will not mature; if the external furnace is not removed when it should be, the firing time will be excessive and the elixir will surely be harmed. If the inner furnace is removed prematurely when it should not be, the firing time will not be refined and the elixir will lack potency; if the inner furnace is not removed when it should be, the firing time will stagnate in dullness and the elixir will not emerge. All these are errors in the furnace’s firing time. It is thus hoped that the knowing heart, through meticulous vigilance, will avoid such errors.

"Flying" signifies deviation—this should be read in light of the earlier chapter *"When the Flowers Truly Fly."*

[Liu’s Exegesis]
Harmonizing yin and yang.

[Li’s Exegesis]
Obtaining the medicine and returning the elixir.
The rootless tree, its flowers in true yellow,
is born in the central land of wu and ji.
The eastern household’s maiden, the western house’s youth—
as husband and wife, they enter the bridal chamber.
The Yellow Matron urges them to drink the ghee-wine,
each day growing drunk in a haze of intoxication.
This immortal formula, the soul-returning nectar,
raises the dead and revives the living—it is the King of Medicines.

[Liu’s Annotation]
Yellow is the true color of the central wu and ji. Wu, as yang earth, governs movement; ji, as yin earth, governs stillness. When wu and ji unite at the center, they form the true trust, also called the true intent. When the flower’s hue is true yellow, the true numen has entered the central, correct position. Yet for the true numen to be centered and upright, one’s nature and emotions must be as one. The eastern household’s maiden is the nature of wood; the western house’s youth is the emotion of metal. One nature, one emotion—paired as husband and wife, they enter the secluded bridal chamber. With the Yellow Matron urging them to drink the ghee-wine and harmonizing the firing times, what was not in harmony must harmonize, and once harmonized, it remains so. The ghee-wine is not the dregs of the mundane world, nor is it the tangible substances of essence, fluids, or blood within the body. It is the qi of intermingled yin and yang in harmonious union, coalescing into the true unity of essence, flowing as the true unity of water—fragrant and sweet in flavor. The ancients called it "jade liquid," "nectar," "sweet dew," or "ghee," all terms that describe this single point of harmonious qi. To "urge drinking" means to regulate what is not harmonious until it reaches perfect harmony. In the practice of the Dao, when yin and yang attain perfect harmony, one remains constantly responsive yet still. From afar, one observes phenomena, yet phenomena are no longer phenomena; up close, one observes the body, yet the body is no longer the body; inwardly, one observes the heart, yet the heart is no longer the heart. Unknowing and unperceiving, one follows the decree of the Emperor. Daily, one drinks the ghee-wine and enters the realm of intoxication. This intoxicated delight is the immortal’s formula, the soul-returning nectar—able to raise the dead, able to revive the living. It is the great King of Medicines. "Central," "wu and ji," and "Yellow Matron" are all alternate names for the true trust. In terms of yin-yang harmony, it is called "central"; in terms of yin-yang movement, it is called "wu and ji"; in terms of yin-yang harmonization, it is called "Yellow Matron"; in terms of activity, it is called "true trust"; in terms of stillness and stability, it is called "true intent." Thus, one thing has many names, but in sum, it is merely the one true trust. Recognizing this trust, one must apply solid effort upon it. First, seek emotion through nature; then, return emotion to nature; then, harmonize nature and emotion; then, merge nature and emotion into oneness, forming a single true numinous treasure. From beginning to end, nothing succeeds without this one trust—how great is the function of trust! When reduced to its essence, the centered and upright true numen is the union of nature and emotion. When nature and emotion unite, the true trust resides within. When the true trust manifests, nature and emotion naturally do not separate, and the true numen is naturally centered and upright. These three depend on and yet give rise to one another.

[Li’s Explanation]
Yellow is the true color, the correct awakening of the Buddhist school, the correct qi of the Confucian and Daoist traditions. In the Buddhist canon, it is called "yellow flowers"; in the immortal classics, it is called "yellow sprouts." Yet there are two kinds of yellow sprouts: one is the new medicine of the third day, the other is the great medicine of the fifteenth day. As *Awakening to Reality* states: "Where yellow sprouts arise, kan and li conjoin"—this refers to the new medicine of the third day. Where yellow sprouts arise is where kan and li should unite to plant the second yellow sprout. *Awakening to Reality* says: "Plant the yellow sprout, and it gradually grows"—this is the second yellow sprout, the great medicine of the fifteenth day. The growth of the yellow sprout truly arises from the union of kan and li. This union of kan and li occurs in the central land of wu and ji. The center is where essence and qi coalesce; the land of wu and ji is where movement and stillness harmonize. Once harmonized and coalesced, in an instant, the yellow sprout is born from within—hence it is said, "born in the central land of wu and ji." This yellow sprout has many names; in this chapter, it is the western house’s youth. The western house’s youth is the qi of metal; the eastern household’s maiden is the essence of mercury. Gathering the qi of metal to subdue the essence of mercury—this is the Dao of returning metal and mercury, the pairing of husband and wife entering the bridal chamber. Once in the bridal chamber, the Yellow Matron must guard them. The Yellow Matron is the "knowing heart" mentioned in the previous chapter. If the couple fears discord, their spirit, intent, and qi will struggle to enter the realm of harmony, and the elixir will not form. Thus, the Yellow Matron must attend to them, urging them to drink the ghee. The ghee is the essence of external nurturing warmth, the qi of internal harmonious union. The Yellow Matron is the intimate confidant; the firing times in the furnace will naturally not err. Between dawn and dusk, she urges them to drink frequently, each day growing drunk in a haze—truly a joyous affair. This wine is not mundane wine but the wine brewed by the immortal’s formula, called the soul-returning nectar. It can raise the dead and revive the living; neither minor nor external medicines can compare. It is the King of Medicines. This chapter describes the work of the fourth firing time after seeking lead in the second firing time. Seeking lead is an external affair: on the third day, when the moon emerges in geng, one applies effort. This is called "pairing water with fire," "the dragon approaching the tiger," "yin meeting yang," "li uniting with kan," "nature harmonizing with emotion," "mercury investing lead," "the maiden marrying the man"—all methods of using the postnatal to generate the prenatal. In sum, it is the union of essence and qi, an external medicine. Its work lies externally, requiring only one talisman and two firing times to establish the foundation of the elixir.

The Reverted Elixir.

This is an internal affair. One applies effort at the time of the full moon on the fifteenth day, calling it "using water to extinguish fire." This water is the water of celestial menses. It is also called "the tiger marrying the dragon," where the tiger is the tiger of the western direction; "yang subduing yin," where yang is the yang containing the true; "kan filling li," where kan is the prenatal kan; "emotion returning to nature," where emotion is the emotion of metal; "lead restraining mercury," where lead is the lead of True Unity; "the man pairing with the woman," where the man is the pure qian; "using the prenatal to restrain the postnatal." In sum, it is the union of true qi with true essence—an internal medicine. Its work lies internally, requiring two talismans and four firing times to congeal the Golden Elixir.

All this has been left undifferentiated by the ancients; here I expound it in detail, that when reading elixir scriptures, one may clearly distinguish between the two medicines.

Twenty-two
[Liu’s words] Congealing the Sacred Embryo.
[Li’s words] Capturing and subduing the Fiery Medicine.

The rootless tree, its blossoms now bright,
The moon’s yin essence presses close to the sun’s yang spirit.
Golden Crow’s marrow, Jade Rabbit’s essence—
These two things captured and simmered in one place.
Yang fire and yin talismans divide at midnight and noon,
Bathing rites added at the gates of mao and you.
Guard the Yellow Court, nurture the Valley Spirit,
A man conceiving an embryo—how laughable it seems!

[Liu’s commentary]
The prenatal true numen, its original luminous body,
Pierces heaven and earth, illuminating all—this is the blossoms’ brightness.
What makes it bright is the harmony of yin and yang qi.
A person’s singular self is purely yin, like the moon’s darkness without light.
Only by borrowing another’s deathless method does yang arise,
As the moon borrows sunlight to become bright.
The moon’s yin essence pressing close to the sun’s yang spirit—
Yin and yang in union—can, at the heart of heaven, shine brilliantly.
This is the merging of true knowing and numinous knowing,
The image of the true numen unobscured.

The Golden Crow’s marrow is the sun’s yang spirit,
In humans, the feminine within the masculine—
The true yin of numinous knowing.
The Jade Rabbit’s essence is the moon’s yin essence,
In humans, the white within the black—
The true yang of true knowing.
Earlier, it spoke of crow’s liver and rabbit’s marrow;
Here, it speaks of crow’s marrow and rabbit’s essence—
There is a great distinction; they must not be viewed as the same.
For crow’s liver and rabbit’s marrow are the medicinal substances of the Reverted Elixir,
The true knowing and numinous knowing of yin and yang yet to unite but on the verge of union—
Thus, the liver of the crow, the marrow of the rabbit.
Crow’s marrow and rabbit’s essence are the medicinal substances of the Great Elixir,
The true knowing that can be numinous, the numinous knowing that can be true—
Yin and yang already united and in harmony—
Thus, the marrow of the crow, the essence of the rabbit.
Yet to unite but on the verge of union is forced effort,
The false returning to the true.
Already united and in harmony is natural function,
The true becoming even truer.

Gather these two true medicinal substances and knead them into one,
Refine forth the yang within yang,
Then apply the fire-tending of zi, wu, mao, and you—
Thus is the Golden Liquor Great Elixir perfected.

Yet what is called zi, wu, mao, and you
Is not the zi, wu, mao, and you at the edge of the sky,
But rather the zi, wu, mao, and you within the body.
When true knowing appears, it is zi;
The method is to use firm advancing fire to stir the true knowing forth from the mysterious.
When numinous knowing arrives, it is wu;
The method is to use gentle retreating tally to draw the numinous knowing into the feminine.
When true knowing advances to the central equilibrium, it is mao;
The method is to ice-bathe this central equilibrium so it does not advance excessively.
When numinous knowing retreats to the central equilibrium, it is you;
The method is to ice-bathe this central equilibrium so it does not retreat excessively.
This is the Dao of tally-fire and ice-bathing,
An unchanging method for ten thousand ages.
If one applies effort according to the zi, wu, mao, and you at the edge of the sky,
One strays far indeed.

When tally and fire are not in error,
When bathing aligns with the proper time,
Yin and yang respond to each other,
Neither leaning nor tilting—
The Mysterious Feminine is established,
And the Valley Spirit arises within it.

The Yellow Court is the central and correct position,
The single aperture amid the union of yin and yang,
Also called the Gate of the Mysterious Feminine.
When primal yang and feminine yin unite, yin and yang merge,
This aperture exists;
When yin and yang are askew,
This aperture does not exist.
Where this aperture exists, there is the Valley;
Where there is the Valley, there is the Spirit.
Where this aperture does not exist, there is no Valley;
Where there is no Valley, there is no Spirit.
The Valley is the Yellow Court.
Yellow is the color of the center;
Court means emptiness.
Because it is empty within, it is named the Yellow Court.
Empty, it is numinous;
Numinous, it is Spirit—
This is called the Valley Spirit.

Observe the mountains:
Two cliffs stand facing each other,
Between them a valley.
When one calls out, the valley echoes—
This echoing sound is the Valley Spirit,
Commonly called the "cliff baby."
When human yin and yang unite,
A Spirit dwells within—
It is just like this.
Yet if one has not reached the state where yin and yang unite,
There is no center,
No Valley—
How can a Spirit reside there?
Only when yin and yang truly unite
Does a center appear,
Does a Valley form,
And the Spirit arise of itself.
This is what is meant by "the primal qi comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness,"
By "true emptiness yet containing wondrous existence,"
By "to keep the Valley Spirit from ever dying, one must rely on the Mysterious Feminine to establish the root."

When yin and yang merge into one qi,
The Valley Spirit abides steadfast in the Yellow Court—
This is called "a man conceiving an embryo."
To "guard the Yellow Court" is to guard the center.
To "nurture the Valley Spirit" is to embrace the One.
Guarding the center and embracing the One,
After ten months the work is complete,
A body exists beyond the body,
And one endures as long as heaven and earth.

These are true and real dharmic signs,
Works accomplished within emptiness,
Not wrought from form and appearance.
Those who fiddle with circulation techniques on the stinking skin-bag,
Falsely hoping to form the sacred embryo—
How could they know what makes the Valley Spirit the Valley Spirit?

[Li’s Explanation]
Brightness is the arising of the Great Medicine,
The empty chamber giving birth to white,
Radiating great luminosity—
The time of great awakening, great enlightenment.
This Great Medicine is the yang within lead,
The gold within cinnabar,
The primal within the primal—
Like the moon’s dark essence at the heart of heaven,
Pressing close to the sun’s yang soul,
Forming a radiant orb of light,
Not like the sliver of the third day,
Far at the sky’s edge,
Near as the crescent brow.

The word "pressing" is crucial—
It means intimate closeness,
The two refining each other in one place.
Sun and moon unite as jade discs,
The sun’s yang soul pours entirely into the moon’s dark essence,
A thousand miles of brightness,
The heart of heaven gleaming like snow.
Seize the two and refine them together—
Not seizing the Golden Crow and then the Jade Hare,
But seizing the Golden Crow to grasp the Jade Hare,
Seizing one thing to thereby seize both.
At the moment of seizing,
There are the four phases of zi, wu, mao, and you, the fire at the gates.
Thus the Golden Crow flies into the Palace of Broad Cold,
And with the marrow of the Golden Crow,
The essence of the Jade Hare is harmonized.
Then the essence of the Jade Hare
Is entirely transformed into the marrow of the Golden Crow—
Only then is the moon’s dark essence pressing the sun’s yang soul,
Skillfully refined in one place.

At this time,
The yang soul is full,
The yin essence formless—
Two things become one,
One thing contains two.
Yin is exhausted, yang is complete,
Great luminosity radiates—
Thus it is called the yang within lead,
The gold within cinnabar,
The primal within the primal.
At this stage,
It is the Great Medicine of Golden Liquor,
And one applies the work of ingesting it according to the four phases of zi, wu, mao, and you—
Only then is it the Great Return Elixir of Nine Revolutions.

What time is zi?
When yang arises, it is zi—
Thus one advances the yang fire.
Where is wu?
When yin descends, it is wu—
Thus one retreats the yin tally.
Ice-bathing means natural adjustment,
Neither hurried nor slow.
This work should be applied
When the yang fire approaches mao,
When the yin tally approaches you—
Thus yang does not exceed firmness,
Yin does not exceed softness,
Firmness and softness attain the mean,
Entry and exit are in proper measure.

Formerly, Master Tao Cuncun elucidated the secret of fire-tending in the *Triple Concordance*,
And recorded his teacher’s *Fire-Tending Song* in his commentary.
I deeply admire it,
And now append it here as corroboration.

The song says:
"I recall my immortal elder’s Daoist methods,
All were those moves of our own house.
Originally there was no adding or withdrawing at zi and wu,
How could there be rabbit and chicken, punishment and virtue?
Ask: When is my zi?
Answer: At the time the medicine arises.
Ask: When is my wu?
Answer: When the medicine faces the Golden Gate.
Ask: When is my mao?
Answer: When the Red Child stands in the Cave of Fire Clouds.
Without the Guanyin Who Saves from Suffering,
The Great Medicine would surely burst.
This is the time for bathing—
Beyond this, the boat and oars of the Yellow River.
Again ask: What is the you gate?
Answer: When the Conception and Governor Vessels unite."

At this moment, if there is no Yellow Skirt,
How can the medicine attain primal auspiciousness?
Beyond this lies the *xu* treasury—
Pray inquire into the treasury’s secrets.
This is the mind-to-mind transmission of the One Thread,
The Supreme Dao requires no other seeking.”

When the medicine arrives at the *mao* gate,
One must employ the stillness of Guanyin.
Guanyin’s stillness governs with strict restraint,
Preventing the Red Child from seizing power—
Then sweet dew arises.
As for the *you* gate,
It is wrapped in the Yellow Skirt,
Preventing the primal pearl from spilling—
Then the white fluid congeals.
Such is the wondrous use of ice-bathing.

The Yellow Court is the center.
The Valley Spirit is emptiness and numinosity.
Abiding in the center to nurture emptiness and numinosity,
The Dharma-body manifests its image—
A man resembling a woman with child,
Laughable yet endearing indeed.

**Twenty-Three**
*[Liu’s words:]*
True emptiness, Dharma-form.
*[Li’s words:]*
Perfect penetration, self-so freedom.

The rootless tree,
Its blossoms now crimson—
Pluck all the red blossoms, and the whole tree is empty.
Emptiness is form, form is emptiness;
Discern true emptiness within form.
When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes,
Yet the Dharma-form endures, never falling into emptiness.
Named Perfect Penetration, called the Great Hero,
Nine generations ascend beyond the nine heavens.

*[Liu’s commentary:]*
The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir takes as its destination
The transcendence of all phenomena in soundlessness and scentlessness—
How could blossoms possess crimson hue?
If even the slightest trace of color remains,
The postcelestial qi and temperament are not yet fully transformed,
And the Great Dao remains unaccomplished.
The ancient immortals said:
“Not a shred of yin qi may remain if one is to become immortal.”
For if a shred of yin qi remains,
A shred of yang qi is incomplete,
And the true spirit may still suffer damage—
This cannot be called the Great Elixir of the sevenfold return and ninefold restoration.
The cultivator must pluck all the red blossoms,
Eradicating the adventitious dust-roots accumulated since beginningless kalpas,
Returning to the state where all things are empty,
Restoring the soundless, scentless visage prior to parents’ birth.
Yet this “emptiness” does not mean the lifeless stillness of wood or stone.
There is a Dao of borrowing the provisional to perfect the real,
And using the real to transform the provisional—
Hence: “Emptiness is form, form is emptiness;
Discern true emptiness within form.”
To be wholly without mind is to cling to emptiness;
To harbor even the slightest mind is to cling to form.
“Emptiness is form” means it is not empty;
“Form is emptiness” means it is not form.
Neither empty nor formed, yet both empty and formed—
This is true emptiness abiding within form.
“When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes,
Yet the Dharma-form endures, never falling into emptiness”:
True emptiness, once realized, settles all matters.
Originally without form,
Yet since form vanishes, the Dharma-form remains;
And since the Dharma-form remains, it cannot fall into emptiness.
Because it is true emptiness, the Dharma-form exists;
Because the Dharma-form exists, there is no form—
No form, yet Dharma-form abiding:
Thus emptiness is true, and truth is emptiness.
When cultivation reaches the point where true emptiness bears the Dharma-form,
And the Dharma-form preserves true emptiness,
The wondrous existence of the One Spirit,
Perfectly penetrating the Dharma-realm,
Becomes an indestructible vajra-body—
Water and fire cannot assail it,
Blades and weapons cannot harm it,
Tigers and rhinoceroses cannot wound it—
And it is called the Great Hero.
Not only does one ascend to the ranks of immortals,
But even nine generations of ancestors rise to the heavens,
Becoming deities together.
In former times, when Śākyamuni Buddha cultivated the sixteen-foot golden body,
And his Dharma-form dwelled in the Hall of the Great Hero,
It was this very Dao.

*[Li’s explanation:]*
Red is the symbolic form of the Great Medicine.
The immortal master’s *Daoist Sentiments Song* and *The Rootless Tree*
Are both essential works—
From them, this may be understood.
The *Daoist Sentiments Song* says:
“Of all phenomena, none are of the same kind;
A single red radiance is the utmost truth.”
When red radiance appears,
Its blossoms are crimson;
When the red blossoms are in hand, the true medicine is obtained.
Apart from these red blossoms, no medicine can be gathered.
Once the work of gentle nurturing is complete,
Furnace and crucible are entirely set aside—
All those blossoming trees are no longer discussed.
Thus: “Pluck all the red blossoms, and the whole tree is empty.”
Once the blossoms are empty, my Dao is attained;
Once my Dao is attained, emptiness is no longer empty.
Since emptiness is no longer empty, emptiness is form;
Form is not substantial form—it is the form of the Dharma.
Discern that true emptiness is not empty,
And true emptiness abides within form.
This “form” is not the form of form,
But the form of the Dharma.
When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes entirely;
When form vanishes entirely, the Dharma-form endures forever.
The enduring Dharma-form is true emptiness not empty.
“Perfect penetration” means merit and practice are complete,
All dharmas are penetrated,
And the substance and function of true emptiness are perfected.
Once called Perfect Penetration, one must be called the Great Hero;
Once called the Great Hero, one must become the patriarch of immortals—
How could nine generations of ancestors not ascend,
Rising together beyond the nine heavens?

**Twenty-Four**
*[Liu’s words:]*
Return to the formless.
*[Li’s words:]*
Attain the rank of the Three Purities.

The rootless tree,
Its blossoms now formless—
Without appearance or shape, hard to depict.
Nameless, yet responsive to call,
Seized and placed within the alchemical furnace.
Ignite the Samādhi fire of the microcosmic orbit,
Temper true emptiness to return to the Great Void.
Visit the immortal capital,
Receive the celestial tally—
Only then is one a true man, a great hero.

*[Liu’s commentary:]*
The treasure of the primordial true spirit
Is fundamentally empty,
A single qi harmoniously blended—
How could there be blossoms?
Without blossoms, without form or image,
It cannot be depicted or drawn.
If it cannot be depicted or drawn,
How could it have name or surname?
Yet though nameless and surnameless,
It is utterly empty and utterly numinous—
Still and unmoving,
Yet responsive when stimulated,
Like an echo answering a call:
Within true emptiness, the wondrous exists.
With this marvel of responsiveness,
One seizes the moment of resonance to act,
Placing it within the alchemical furnace of the Three Fields,
Using the true fire of Samādhi to temper and refine it to perfection.
From true emptiness, one may return to the Great Void.

The Dao returns to the Great Void, where emptiness itself is empty—nothing remains but the One True. There is no other thing.

The Three Fields are not the common alchemical terms for *qi*-sea, Crimson Palace, or Muddy Pellet; rather, they are the Elixir Fields where the Three Treasures—essence, *qi*, and spirit—converge. This is called the Gate of Primordial Transformation, also known as the Primordial Pass, the Central Yellow Court, the Alchemical Furnace, the Altar of the Great One, or the Gate of Wuji. In sum, it is the Cavern of Emptiness.

The treasure of the primordial true spirit governs the Three Substances—essence, *qi*, and spirit. When the true spirit is restored, the Three Substances are likewise restored. They transform of themselves, harmoniously blending in undifferentiated unity. First, from nonbeing they create being; then, from being they return to nonbeing. The refinement of true emptiness is precisely the marvel of transforming being into nonbeing. When being is thus transformed into nonbeing, both form and spirit attain perfection, merging with the Great Void in oneness. With merit and practice complete, one ascends to the Immortal Capital to receive the celestial mandate, becoming a Perfected One of the Ten Poles and the Great Primal Chaos—a true man whose great work is fulfilled.

*In Praise:*
Revealing the hidden depths of Laozi and Zhuangzi,
Continuing the heart-transmission of Zhong and Lü.
Unveiling the wondrous principle of the primordial,
Cleaving open the tangled paths of empty suspension.
The crucible’s right and wrong distinctly judged,
The medicine’s truth and falsehood plainly seen.
Emptiness and form blend into a single *qi*,
Hard and soft match as two strings in harmony.
Ah!
The alchemical method’s beginning and end fully disclosed,
The fire-tally’s advance and retreat wholly inscribed.
Twenty-four verses of the immortal’s formula—
Whoever grasps them becomes a deathless immortal.

*[Li’s Commentary:]*
The word "nonbeing" carries forward the meaning of "emptiness" from the previous chapter, deepening it to conclude the twenty-four verses. To refine the elixir to the point of emptiness is already perfect, yet if one clings to the notion of true emptiness, the notion of dharmic form remains. Emptiness still falls short of nonbeing. As Lord Lao said: *"Observe emptiness as empty; emptiness itself is empty. What is emptied is already nothing; even nothingness is nothing. Abiding in utter stillness."* Only this is the great liberation, the great awakening, the great purity, the great perfect enlightenment. Why? Because the wondrous being of utter stillness appears as emptiness, and emptiness as nonbeing—beyond all form, beyond depiction or illustration. Precisely because it is formless and imageless, it is difficult to depict or draw; it simply abides in utter stillness.

Before this, in gathering the primordial, there were those named after metals—gold for essence, yellow for the sprout, white for the primordial. But this utterly still true reality has no name or surname. Though nameless, it responds to every call, like an echo in an empty valley, answer following answer. Question it with words, and it receives the command as if facing you—this is the utmost subtlety in the world. Still and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated—this is the utmost spirit in the world. Why? Because this utterly still true reality is hidden within nonbeing.

The principles of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas penetrate the workings of creation. Within nonbeing, being is concealed. At this stage, the uncanny and wondrous manifest—such as Leng Qijing, Zhang Jinghua, and Immortal Zhou Dian. Our Master Sanfeng, embodying the Dao, must seize nonbeing with nonbeing and enter the central realm of emptiness. Through great creation and transformation, within the furnace he circulates the true fire of Samādhi around the celestial sphere, refining and tempering until the dharmakāya of emptiness returns to the Great Nonbeing.

The Great Nonbeing is the realm of the sagely perfected—such as the Jade Purity’s Primal Chaos Great Heaven or the High Purity’s Crimson Primal Nonbeing Great Heaven. Those who refine the immortal Dao receive only the ranks of the Great Purity. But those who return to the Great Nonbeing first pay homage to the Dao and its Power, then to the Jade Emperor, and finally to the Primordial Beginning, attaining the fruit of the Three Purities.

The word "return" signifies that all foolish men and women are originally beings of the Three Purities. Yet due to karmic delusion, they descend age after age, remaining foolish men and women, unable to regain the realm of the sagely perfected. If they turn their hearts toward goodness, seek the Dao, and find a teacher—progressing from foundation-laying and self-cultivation through the seven reversals and nine returns, refining to emptiness and then to nonbeing, and from nonbeing returning to the Great Nonbeing—they once again become guests of the Three Purities.

Yet refining true emptiness requires the true fire of Samādhi around the celestial sphere. The celestial sphere does not refer to the river chariot but to movement within the heavens, the subtle workings in the void, the profound and mysterious transformations of the Dao’s natural law. Samādhi does not refer to yang fire but to the union of heaven-one and earth-two as three. Within heaven and earth, I establish the crucible and furnace. Spirit and *qi* merge in obscurity—this is the fire of immortal refinement, the celestial primordial elixir.

With merit complete and practice fulfilled, one ascends to the Three Heavens, visits the Immortal Capital, receives the celestial mandate, and may be enfeoffed as a Perfected Lord, an Imperial Lord, a Heavenly Venerable, or appointed as a master of the Five Peaks, the sacred mountains, the grotto-heavens, or the blessed lands to select immortals. Only then is one a true man, the greatest of men—divine to the utmost!

*In Praise:*
Scattering flower-rain across the sky,
Spreading golden earth below.
Hand clapping fish-drum and clappers,
Mouth singing the immortal hymns of the Upper Grotto.
Delivering the four continents,
Eternally embodying the Dao’s sentiment.
Ah!
Wherever one awakens to the true spirit,
First hold fast to our school’s essential intent.
The mountain man proclaims the true formula by the book,
Broadly opening the nondual gate to deliver the world.

*[Original Notes:]*
Wu Yuan said: "I do not know what tune this is."
Hanxu said: "Those who sing *Daoist sentiment* are called *pulling dark clouds*."
In the *Wuyuan* annotated edition, "subtle" is written as "precarious," which also conveys the sense of decline.
In the *Wuyuan* annotated edition, "green" is written as "pure," yet "green" signifies the freshness of new growth, akin to purity untouched by defilement.
"Wall-top" is written as "jade flower," and "jade flower" as "wall-top"—I have seen both versions.

This annotation interprets "wall-top" with depth, so I follow it.
⑸ *Fixed*: The *Kongqing Cave Heaven* edition of *Wu Gen Shu Er Zhu* writes it as "wisdom," which is correct.
⑹ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* annotated edition writes "又向" as "旋趁," differing in character but identical in meaning. However, "才经" is written as "残经," which some interpret as human desires—thus "gathering" is meant to repel the yin thief—yet this risks compounding error with error.
⑺ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* annotated edition writes "对景忘情" as "月月开时."
⑻ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* edition writes "爱" as "碍," which is inferior.
⑼ *Original Note*: Refers to the later phrase "raven’s liver."
⑽ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* annotated edition writes "浓" as "秾," "擒" as "牵," and "方" as "圆," though the meaning remains unchanged.
⑾ *Spirit*: Based on context, this likely should be "nature."
⑿ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* annotated edition writes "泊" as "斡" and "盗" as "窃."
⒀ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* annotated edition writes "产在" as "色正."
⒁ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* annotated edition writes "金花" as "红花," which is preferable, so I follow it. "灭" is mistakenly written as "法."
⒂ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* edition writes the two characters "中间" as "三田," though *Wuyuan* still interprets it as the wondrous aperture within.

**Daoist Sentiment Poems (Twenty-Four)**

Men say it is good to be human,
I say being human is endless toil.
Even if wealth and rank mean nothing to me,
Must I still yearn day and night for the immortal isles?

As for me,
Hánxū is a Daoist.
Born into this world uncommon,
Yet my rebirth was amiss.
From childhood, I mumbled a few words,
And in adulthood, I was tangled in vines,
Dreaming of fame that would echo through ages,
Or of soaring as an immortal on earth—
All these fancies left me with nothing achieved.
Fortune’s five phases align,
And by grace, I still have a thatched hut,
Three fellow Daoists,
Roaming carefree, high above the mortal dust.
Laughing and smiling,
We linger among streams and stones.
Late autumn, early winter,
With no affairs in the mountains,
We brew a pot of chrysanthemum wine,
Admire the early plum blossoms,
And softly chant Daoist poems.

Alas, since descending into this world,
I recall my past life as a cold scholar,
Lightly drifting in a boat between Húnán and Húběi.
Why did I vow to seek the Western Paradise?
Wandering through clouds, waters, mist, and mountains.

And pity those born into this world,
Who enter the womb and lodge their souls,
Each layer of parents bestowing kindness.
Their faces resemble their fathers and mothers,
Nurtured with warmth and tender words.
Born as human—this is fortunate,
But one must know to cherish it.
After ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths to gain a human form,
One must understand the causes sown in the great kalpa.

The Pure Yang Ancestor’s compassion is boundless,
Urging us to value this body before us.

Those who cultivate the Dao—
Not a speck of mundane thought may arise.
Hear my recitation:
Spring water is muddy when it leaves the mountain, clear within it;
I regret my past journey into distant lands.
Suddenly seeing so much splendor,
Only then do I realize how hard it is to remain unmoved by circumstances.

Those who cultivate the Dao—
Where does the Dao-heart arise?
The melody of wind and springs winds through ten thousand pines,
Yet it cannot compare to the ten-mile expanse of a tranquil lake.
The moon hangs at the heart of the sky, the cold rests in the water,
Suddenly cooling the mind’s earth.

Cultivators of the Dao—
The superior begin from nothing to create being.
My family’s elixir method comes from Yíngzhōu,
Starting with emptiness and nothingness.
Fear not the absence of signs,
For one must seek the root in nothingness.

First, refine essence into qi.
On the yīn qiāo vessel, qi drifts hazily,
So much true essence lies within.
Gather it into emptiness and refine it into qi—
A path opens to Pénglái’s distant shores.

Second, refine qi into spirit.
Spirit and qi merge into the boundless,
Suddenly hearing the true scripture chanted in the void.
The five directions, the five qi swirl around,
Announcing the birth of the spirit from the primordial azure.

Third, refine spirit to complete nature.
The immortal qi must be sought in stillness,
Few on the red-dust path understand.
Sitting in the central courtyard for three months of fragrance,
A golden sprout grows an inch deep.

Those who leave the household—
After refining essence to generate qi,
Some effects will appear.
Daily, guide the qi to the mud-pill palace,
Sweet nectar gradually fills the tip of the tongue.
Irrigating the three fields, nourishing the hundred vessels,
Naturally, essence grows and the valley spirit is at peace.

When sweet nectar fills the mouth each day,
The immortal heart arises.
On a jade isle, dwelling in seclusion,
The Pure Yang Ancestor sits high in a painted pavilion.
Sweeping the floor, burning incense—utterly idle,
Only the flower studio’s leisure remains.

With the immortal heart comes stillness of mind.
Deep in misty mountains, one lingers.
From this, literary thoughts turn to elixir refinement.
Sleeves rolled with white clouds, returning to the cave abode,
Head bowed, eyes closed, seated on the rush mat.

With stillness of mind comes the true heart.
All that is known and perceived is false;
Only the unknown and unperceived give birth to truth.
A single somersault shatters the primordial chaos,
And one sets out to become a Daoist in the Eastern Realm.

When the true heart appears, the true seed is ever-present.
Gold meets wood, mercury lingers,
The infant and the maiden meet—how joyous!
Last night, the Lady of the Cinnabar Terrace sent a sweet dream,
And a red pill was conceived.

Why is it called "from being to non-being"?
Congeal the jade liquid into elixir wealth,
Place it in the Kūn palace—truly still.
Suddenly, a single yang rises from the earth,
The elixir’s resources return to me without guesswork.

Why is it called "from non-being to being"?
True lead emerges from the great void,
Planted in the Lí palace, born in the Kǎn palace.
I see the golden sprout burst forth in luxuriance,
While others speak of white snow filling the emptiness.

Why is it called "joining for long life"?
Mercury’s nature is light and fond of flight,
Lead’s essence is heavy and never fails to consume.
In refining the elixir, if passion returns to nature,
One will surely ride a green phoenix into the Tàiwēi realm.

Why is it called "life within killing"?
Lead meets mercury in distress, yet bestows grace within harm,
Mercury, bound by lead, is reborn from death.
If the wondrous treasure lacks restraint,
The work of immortality will not be perfected.

How does one meet the Green Maiden and give birth to the sacred embryo?
The Green Maiden is young and adept at cultivation,
Not a solitary yīn—her body cannot generate life.
After meeting in the bridal chamber,
They share a bed for ten months to bear the embryo.

How does one transfer the cauldron and shift the embryo, so the child begets grandchildren?
The Great Dao ascends step by step,
Once the returned elixir is achieved, one meets the immortals.
Year by year, the fire’s timing adds to the household,
Gazing toward Pénglái, the spirit soars.

Hear the mountain man speak of the wondrous principles of nurturing life—
There is much joy in them.
I wonder, in ordinary times, which masters and immortals did you admire?
The Pure Yang Recluse, old Chén Tuán,
A carefree immortal of the Five Dynasties.
The joy of the clapper and fishing rod beyond the world,
Unmoved by chaos, naturally at peace.

And which immortal master did you follow?
The Great Yuan’s remnant elder, known as Sānfēng,
Who vanished at the end of the Yuán dynasty.
Only when the Chéngpíng era arrived did he reappear,
Delighting in drifting clouds and flowing waters among lofty pines.

As for me, the carefree Hánxū of the Daoist sentiment poems,
These twenty-four chapters express it all.
In Chángyǐ Mountain, there is nothing else—
A single fish-drum, a single lyric.
To restrain the heart is the method; Daoist sentiments dispel cares.

If you wish to ascend to the Great Luó Heaven,
You must refine your heart.

Abandon thoughts of fame and fortune, sever ties to profit and desire.
Even if gossamer threads of calculation arise, fierce fire burns them away to reveal the celestial nature.
One end rises, one end severs—
Only subtraction is seen, no addition.
Fear not the ten thousand restless "heart-monkeys," nor the thousand galloping "mind-horses."
Practice internal work, breathe into the dantian.
Guard the true breath, and purity comes naturally.
Plunge into profound darkness to draw forth auspicious mist.
It tingles my Crimson Palace, intoxicates my limbs with languid softness.
This is my true method for taming dragons, my technique for slaying serpents.
Passed down everywhere among mortals, the celestial mechanism is not sold for silver.
Wealthy disciples present gifts in homage; impoverished disciples follow fate as it comes.
They remain unfeigned, I remain incorrupt—
Now, after three years of digging the well, I seek to establish some karmic merit.
Who could know the perversity of destiny, the hardship of the times?
Family fortunes decline, heroic spirit wanes, and the elixir furnace is utterly neglected.
Yet should the winds of fortune shift one day, I’ll cast off all and roam carefree to the immortal isles.

**The Heart-Mind Chapter**
Its heart-mind luminous, its functions manifold.
Its spirit profound, its substance serene and steadfast (I act not, yet qi naturally coalesces).
Thus the ancients directly grasped the "non-spiritual spirit" as the true spirit.

**Cultivating the Heart-Mind**
Sweeping away resentment and desire is no hardship;
When the heart-mind is at peace, the body too is at peace.
The moon casts its clear light upon still waters,
The wind carries coolness around the winding balustrade.
Buddhist scriptures penetrated, vexations vanish;
Daoist teachings attained, a steadfast vision arises.
Ever restrain the heart-mind within the chamber of the chest,
Walking alone, sitting alone, pacing alone.

**Three Poems on Emptiness**
Practicing is easy, attaining is hard—
Apart from emptiness, no elixir is made.
If the world seeks a place to stabilize the tripod,
Within this realm, the expanse surpasses the heavens.

Loving is easy, delighting is hard—
Apart from emptiness, no elixir is made.
If the world seeks where the life-nourishing medicine grows,
Within the gourd, the immortals’ altar already stands.

Attaining is easy, preserving is hard—
Apart from emptiness, no elixir coalesces.
If the world seeks where to establish destiny,
From beginning to end, it is all one undivided whole.

**Cultivating the Elixir**
Massage and daoyin techniques,
Easy to encounter, hard to perfect.
The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,
Hard to encounter, easy to practice.
Practicing is not without difficulty,
Yet it can be aligned with longevity.
Modeled on heaven and earth,
Tempered in nature and emotion.
Nature and emotion interact,
Echoing through the empty valley.
Manifestations transform and change,
The work lies in stillness and clarity.
Heart-mind clear, qi clear—
Beneath the earth, thunder rumbles.
Thunder shakes heaven and earth,
The two phases unite in true essence.
Dragon and tiger wage a great battle,
In the wild, supreme peace is established.
The three yang open the myriad apertures,
Gathering medicine into the central camp.
From this, for ten months,
The gentle fire nurtures the fetal immortal.
Splitting open the mud-pill peak,
Carefree, one ascends to the Jade Capital.

**Discoursing on the Art of Immortality**
Of old, there were gods who did not die,
But no bodies that did not die.
Those whose spirit attains non-death
Are precisely those who attain immortality.
When mortals die, their spirit perishes;
When immortals die, their spirit endures.
The gulf between endurance and perishing spans heaven and earth,
Immortals and mortals are not of the same rank.
In the world, centenarians
May endure many springs.
Yet as old age approaches,
Their true nature grows dim and lost.
Bewildered by avarice and desire,
Their will and vitality fade into stupor.
Before death, the body is already in chaos;
Before rebirth, past causes are obscured.
Not waiting for the next life,
They sink into ruin before their very eyes.
Who can embrace this wondrous art?
Dwelling in leisure, refining the primordial spirit.
Even if one cannot escape death,
The numinous nature alone transcends the dust,
Roaming carefree between heaven and earth,
Playing the flute in the wake of Lü Dongbin.

**Lamenting the Pass of Sensual Desire**
Through the ages, the greatest fools
Love beauty as they love flowers.
Through the ages, the most foolish
Are insatiable in their greed.
Indulgence in desire harms the essence,
Like a violent gale stripping the forest of its blossoms.
The *Guo Feng* warns against sensuality,
Yet still, there is a touch of elegance.
The dissolute revel in desire,
Their kind no better than swine.
Those who cultivate both sensuality and the Dao
Meet ruin and lamentable ends.
Better to take a fair maiden,
Sever desire, and refine cinnabar.
How wondrous was Zhang Guolao,
Who tended garden melons with his wife.
How illusory was Yi Yongchang,
Who sang of clouds and mist with his spouse.
Both sages were enamored of beauty,
Yet in the world beyond, their love was rare.
The perfected have no lustful thoughts,
The root of desire is severed, never to sprout again.
I admire the immortals of old,
Whose celestial consorts were their true partners.

**Those Who Cultivate the Dao Should Sever Desire**
The Great Elixir employs the furnace and cauldron,
Metaphors for refining and nurturing the medicine.
The vulgar, failing to understand, heap scorn and slander—
This is the fault of clinging to literal words.
In jest, I mimic their phrasing
To clarify the meaning for the rigidly conventional.

Fourteen ounces of refined gold
Can forge the immortal’s crucible.
Take the lead within *gui*,
To mend the losses within my body.
Crimson silk nurtures the true nature,
The alchemical chamber holds fine vessels.
Once the work is complete, all are discarded,
Selecting companions for shared cultivation.

There was a young man from the eastern household,
In the prime of his years, keen and perceptive.
Kan and Li inverted and overturned,
Nature and emotion mutually affirmed.
These are my numinous parents,
Together entering the grotto-heaven to seclude themselves.
When the Dao is perfected, a family of immortals,
The Great Luo will come to welcome them.

**Matching the Rhymes of Master Ma Bicheng’s "Declining Health in Prosperity"**
The year of the Boar ends, the Rat begins,
Winter’s start already reveals spring.
The first yang returns to its origin,
Myriad things gradually contain the new.
Snow-covered earth, rivers and mountains gleam,
Frost-laden sky, the atmosphere is true.
In the cold garden, fine fruits ripen,
Tangerine wine reveals the spirit’s fullness.

**Awakening at Dawn**
Ten thousand matters fail to go as wished,
Returning, I chant poetry again.
This body should be singularly good,
My Dao is not entirely mistaken.
Spring arrives swiftly, swallows come early,
The night is cold, the cock crows late.
The morning star is as large as a bowl,
Few know the celestial signs.

**After the Double Ninth, Inviting Disciples to Roam the Muyi Hermitage**
Emptiness congeals into emerald, following the azure vastness,
Clapping hands, singing as we ascend.
I wish all beings to ascend the realm of longevity,
Where the immortal spring is truly fragrant for the elderly.

**Double Ninth at the Yang Zheng Residence**
On the Double Ninth, the sky drizzles like silk,
In the Hall of Nurturing Integrity, the wine cup is raised.

**Jade Wine and Shared Resonance**
Jade wine intoxicates, yet one remains unaware,
Fine words await guests, few truly understand.
Only you and I share this tune in harmony,
Knees pressed close, hearts converse in wondrous speech.
When shall we ride twin white cranes together,
Beneath Green City Mountain to seek the magic lingzhi?

**To the Tune of "Man Jiang Hong" – First Variation**
Clapping hands, singing aloud,
I sigh—mortals flicker like candle flames,
Laughing at lives spent in vain, deaths in futility,
What resolution can there be?
The arena of fame and profit stretches wide, yet battles yield but emptiness,
The debts of poetry and books weigh heavy, faces seek elixir formulas.
When shall you roam the seas and skies, Master?
Permit me to speak.

Parents still live, yet home is hard to leave.
Debts of gratitude run deepest, ties are hardest to sever.
Loosen the reins of fame, return instead to the thatched hut.
Millet and beans bring joy as we till the verdant fields,
Mountain cups toast longevity with golden chrysanthemums.
Only when I’ve served the white-haired elders
Shall I make my final decision.

**To the Tune of "Man Jiang Hong" – Second Variation**
Pray tell, esteemed sirs,
What does it mean to cultivate immortality or Buddhahood?
First, one must thoroughly grasp the Confucian classics,
Then we may speak of this together.
Nurturing nature and preserving the heart embrace the wondrous Dao,
Cultivating the body and establishing destiny transmit the true formula.
Within vastness, the elixir is refined,
Riding the dragon forth.

When heaven’s fortune prospers, sages are nurtured.
When the lord’s Dao flourishes, talented ministers arise.
Laugh at our own carelessness and sloth—
Why offer uncut jade?
Who in this world has exhausted all worldly achievements?
The winds and waves of mortal life are boundlessly treacherous.
Better far to serve the mountains and forests,
And withdraw early.

**To the Tune of "Man Jiang Hong" – Third Variation**
The eight-legged essays and literary works
Are but dregs of the Six Classics.
Worse still, slick and glib tones are added—
Where is the truth in any of it?
The fawning postures of the times are truly laughable,
The rush for fame—why so frantic?
Relying on poetry and prose to become a high official,
To build a family legacy.

First, the learning is flawed,
Power once grasped, greed takes hold.
Weighing copper coins heavily,
While soldiers and common folk are cast aside.
If only there were a clear-sighted official who discerned right from profit,
Yet without silver to offer, even he becomes an enemy.
See how our kind, emerging from the mountains, must
Hastily retreat.

**Nine Characters of the Great River’s Western Lineage**
The Western Dao connects,
The Great River flows east,
The sea and sky stretch boundless.

**Inscription by Patriarch Lü**
The Great River’s first patriarch is Pure Yang,
After nine cycles, the elixir is perfected, the Dao’s qi flourishes.
Today, the transmission of the heart holds no other words—
May each of you steer the vessel of compassion.
