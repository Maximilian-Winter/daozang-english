**Wang Chongyang’s Ten Discourses on Internal Cultivation**
*Attributed to an anonymous author*

Wang Chongyang, disciple of the Eight Immortals’ Lü Chunyang, was a native of Xianyang in Shaanxi during the late Song and early Yuan dynasties. His seven direct disciples, the Seven Perfected, established the Quanzhen School. Zhang Sanfeng regarded these *Ten Discourses on Internal Cultivation* as the root of Taiji. The Venerable Wang Chongyang’s *Ten Discourses* likewise embody this principle. Those who receive these teachings in the mountains need not seek rare herbs or pluck immortal blossoms—here lies the elixir of longevity, the cinnabar of agelessness. Humbly transcribed here to guide later seekers of the Dao.

By spirit, one lays the foundation: purging filth, dispelling the dust of craving, and restoring the true state of purity and non-action. When spirit merges with the Great Void, the qi of yin-yang and the Five Phases unites with the qi of Heaven and Earth, becoming one—this is the Taiji of Heaven and Humanity as one. Through the movement of spirit’s transformation, natural harmony arises, seamless and continuous, endlessly shifting, profound and unfathomable—this is Taiji Boxing. Its myriad transformations, shaped by spirit, flow like drifting clouds and ceaseless currents, beginning without fixed form, concluding without set method. Free, unconstrained, at ease—this is the true Taiji Boxing, the natural endowment of humanity, born of the spirit’s transformation. To cultivate one’s innate gifts is to surpass the blue from which it springs. Clinging to old conventions and stagnation yields no new life. One must carry forth the true lineage and innovate to meet the future.

**I. On Sitting Meditation**

**Original Text:**
Prolonged sitting wearies the body, which is neither reasonable nor beneficial—it may even breed illness. Yet if the mind does not cling to things and remains unmoving, this is the true foundation of stillness. Using this as the basis of stability, the heart-mind and qi harmonize, and with time, clarity and freshness deepen. By maintaining this awareness, one may discern the true from the false. If all arising thoughts are extinguished, and perception is forever severed, one enters the state of oblivious absorption. But if one indulges every thought without restraint, one differs not from the common person. If one merely severs good and evil without giving the mind direction, letting it drift aimlessly, awaiting self-stabilization, this is self-deception. If one engages in all manner of affairs while claiming the mind remains unstained—though the words sound virtuous, the conduct is deeply flawed. True learners must especially guard against this. Now, one quiets delusion without extinguishing awareness, abides in tranquility without clinging to emptiness, and practices with constancy to attain true insight. If doubts arise, allow them to be pondered until resolution is found and understanding dawns. This, too, is the root of wisdom. Once understanding is achieved, cease all thought—thinking harms the nature with cleverness, injuring the root for the sake of the branch. Though it may display brilliance for a moment, it ultimately undermines a legacy of ten thousand generations. All vexing, perverse, and chaotic thoughts must be eradicated upon arising. When one hears slander or praise, good or evil, dismiss them at once—do not let the mind receive them. To receive them is to fill the mind, and when the mind is full, the Dao has no place to dwell. All that is seen and heard should be as if unseen and unheard, so that the myriad things do not enter the mind. When the mind does not receive externals, it is called an empty mind. When the mind does not follow externals, it is called a peaceful mind. When the mind is peaceful and empty, the Dao naturally comes to reside.

**Exegesis:**
To sit as if sitting is to guard a corpse. The living sit without lying down; the dead lie without sitting. A mere stinking skeleton—what use is there in discussing cultivation? One, two, three, four, five—two persons guard one earth. Unravel this meaning, and you are the patriarch of the Western Heaven. The "two persons" are the two pupils of the eyes, which do not stray outward; the spirit sits at the center, guarding the earth of the self, steadfast and immovable as Mount Tai—this is sitting. It is not a matter of the physical body but of building the foundation of one’s own spirit. Let bodily comfort determine the duration. The present is not the past; conditions differ across time. The method arises from the mind—naturally, it is the Dao. Sitting to seek understanding of the true principle through quiet reflection is the aim; halting thought to enter a dull void is a grave error in practice. To generate even a single stray thought is to invite illusory realms—this is called falling into demonic influence. The mind is like a mirror: a thousand forms and ten thousand appearances do not obscure its clarity. Let a thousand thoughts and ten thousand strands come and go—abiding in suchness without movement is the practice of sitting. Like an actor on stage, embodying joy, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, fear, and shock, the performer outwardly expresses these emotions, yet the inner world remains unmoved. Through stillness, non-action, and naturalness, wisdom arises. When the mind is absent, one sees yet does not see, hears yet does not hear, eats yet does not taste—sincerity begets efficacy, and efficacy begets clarity. Washing the mind with the mind, turning inward to illuminate, purging filth, halting thoughts to return to emptiness, and guarding the One—all things are accomplished. This surpasses ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures. Such is the natural, non-forced practice of sitting.

**II. On Emptying the Mind**

**Original Text:**
The scriptures say: If one can empty the mind, it is not that one desires the Dao—the Dao naturally returns to them. With the inner mind free of attachments, outward conduct likewise requires no effort. Neither pure nor defiled, praise and blame cannot arise. Neither wise nor foolish, profit and harm cannot disturb. In truth, one abides in constancy amid adaptability, adjusting with the times. To be free of all burdens—this is wisdom. If one forces thought and action out of season or without cause, though one may appear unattached, this is not true learning. Why? The mind is like the eye: even a speck of dust entering it causes discomfort. If trivial matters occupy the mind, the mind becomes disturbed. Once disturbed, it is difficult to enter the gate of stillness. The essence of cultivating the Dao lies in urgently eliminating afflictions—if afflictions are not removed, stillness can never be attained. Like fertile fields overgrown with brambles, fine crops cannot flourish. Love, desire, and anxious thoughts are the brambles of the mind—if not cut away, concentration and wisdom will not arise. With no place to rest, the mind cannot find peace. Even if momentary peace is achieved, it will soon scatter into chaos.

Rise and fall as they may, ensure the mind remains unmoved; with long and patient cultivation, it will naturally attain ease and leisure. Whether by day or night, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, and in all dealings with affairs and interactions with others, one must intentionally calm the mind. If it has not yet found peace, one must nurture and protect it, avoiding all irritation and disturbance. Even a slight attainment of ease brings its own joy; gradually, through familiarity, one draws ever nearer to purity and transcendence.

Consider cattle and horses, mere domestic beasts—if left unrestrained, they grow stubborn and refuse the yoke. Yet wild hawks and falcons, when tamed by human hands, remain docile at all times, naturally trained to obedience. The mind is no different: if left unchecked and unrestrained, it only grows coarse and scattered—how then can it perceive the subtle and wondrous?

**Exegesis:** The mind is the void and true emptiness, the very essence of the Tathāgata. It is inherently pure, originally empty, solitary and without peer—this is the One Nature. When it encounters objective phenomena, the arising of a single thought gives rise to sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness—this is the human mind. A single thought reflects ten thousand forms; ten thousand thoughts arise from the mind. The empty mind is inherently unmoving; it is only consciousness that moves within it. The more thoughts arise, the void does not increase; with no thoughts, the void does not diminish. The principle of non-increase and non-diminution returns to the fundamental ground. Though ten thousand changes may unfold, they never depart from this ground; when the ground remains unchanging, even a thousand thoughts and ten thousand ideas are naturally harmonious. To perceive one’s mind as disordered is to create duality; the arising of thought is delusion, and duality is not the truth. The disturbance of consciousness is but the obstruction of a single thought; if no second disturbance arises, the mind remains purely sincere.

A thousand thoughts, ten thousand strands—this one arises, that one subsides. A thousand come, a thousand go; ten thousand come, ten thousand depart. The mind is like a mirror: ten thousand thoughts arise from a single thought, and ten thousand thoughts dissolve within that single thought. The single thought of the empty mind remains sincere. Let a thousand thoughts and ten thousand strands come and go as they will; if no second thought arises, it is the purity of a single thought.

Laozi embraced the primordial and guarded the One. Śākyamuni returned the ten thousand dharmas to the perfect clarity of the One Nature. Confucius embodied the purity of the One Thought. Great Shun mastered the One, and the ten thousand dharmas became clear. If one returns the single thought to no-thought, it is the wondrous awakening, the perfect clarity through which the ten thousand dharmas are understood. When the single thought returns to the void, the void returns to the wondrous and great spiritual power.

**3. On Non-Attachment**

**Question:** Those who pursue the Great Dao remain untainted amidst phenomena and undisturbed amidst activity. They act without fail in all matters yet abide in stillness at all times. Now, why do you alone shun activity to seek tranquility, separate movement to pursue stillness? Striving to control the mind only creates the distinction between movement and stillness. Fixating the mind on abiding is itself a form of grasping and rejecting—both flaws remain unrecognized. To cling to externals and call this the essential step of the Dao—how mistaken!

**Answer:** To encompass all things is called great; to pervade all things is called the Dao. To remain untainted amidst phenomena and undisturbed amidst affairs—this is truly great, truly wondrous. Yet your understanding is not yet clear. Why? You see only the brilliance of brocade but do not comprehend the plainness of undyed silk.

Just as one hears the crane’s soaring cry yet fails to recognize its prior nourishment in the valley’s grain, so too does the towering tree begin as the tiniest shoot. The sage’s spirit, concentrated to perfection, is cultivated through accumulated practice. Now you merely speak of the sage’s virtue yet do not comprehend how the sage attains virtue.

**Exegesis:** The awakened nature of perception and cognition is called the Dao-mind. The Tathāgata’s mind is originally unstained. When observing objective phenomena and responding to sensory impressions, the moment a thought arises in consciousness—this is the human mind. The Dao-mind is inherently pure; the human mind is inherently still. Yet when the human mind clings to things, it is led astray by them. Greed and dualistic intention arise—this is the "three minds and two intentions." Such is defilement. A single thought of pure sincerity, free from desire, is called non-defilement. In perfect equilibrium and stillness, when thoughts and desires subside, one recovers one’s original Dao-mind—this is the Dao of returning to emptiness and the wondrous existence, the constant absence of desire through which its mystery is observed. The luminous and unobscured Dao-mind is the innate radiance of wisdom, briefly termed "wisdom-light." This light possesses responsive and interactive functions—what is called the solitary radiance of numinous light. Ordinary light, such as that of a lamp, has no such responsive function, serving only to generate heat and illumination. The lamp is the substance; light is its function. A lamp may be broken, but destroying light alone is impossible. Numinous light cannot be destroyed by any means, for its substance and function are both light, utterly without counterpart. It is not submerged in water, not burned by fire, not severed by blades, not altered by thunder, not scattered by fierce winds. When obscured by phenomena, it remains unillumined. Shattering appearances, removing things, and returning to emptiness—this is self-clarity, the perfect illumination of one’s nature. It is the removal of filth and dust, the cessation of thoughts, and the return to emptiness. This is the true life innate to every human being, the true faith and sincere spirit that illumines itself, attaining wondrous awakening and perfect penetration.

**4. On Simplifying Affairs**
The practitioner of the Dao should above all simplify affairs. Know what is essential, discern what is weighty, and clarify what to retain or discard. Whatever is neither essential nor weighty should be entirely abandoned. Just as one may consume wine and meat, wear silks and brocades, hold fame and position, or possess gold and jade—these are all excesses of desire, not the true medicine for nurturing life. The multitude pursues them only to bring about their own ruin. How deeply deluded they are!

**Exegesis**
The heart is fundamentally empty and still, serene and untrammeled, solitary and without peer—simplified. There is no perception, conception, volition, or consciousness; no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharma; no realm of sight, no realm of consciousness—simplified. As the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states, “All sages and worthies are distinguished by the non-doing Dharma.” The *Heart Sūtra of Avalokiteśvara* declares that the wondrous principle of true emptiness, the non-doing Dharma, is the Buddha’s guiding thread. With a mind unmarked by impressions, one contemplates perfect freedom, and all dharmas are empty. Thus one attains great freedom, entering non-doing yet accomplishing all—this is the bodhisattva of great freedom. Observing the myriad phenomena, generating the myriad intentions, responding to the myriad affairs, producing the myriad transformations: what comes is present, what goes is absent, the heart unobstructed—simplified. Dwelling in the sea of humanity amid wind and waves, in the dust yet apart from the dust, in desire yet apart from desire, harmonizing with the world while concealing one’s brilliance, turning from phenomena to contemplate the heart, the heart like a mirror’s clarity—simplified.

**5. On True Contemplation**
True contemplation is the foreknowledge of the wise and the keen discernment of the capable. Every meal and every rest is a source of gain or loss; every action and every word may become the root of fortune or misfortune. Skillfully managing the branches is not as good as clumsily guarding the root. Observing the root to know the branches is not the impulse of restless striving. Restraining the heart and simplifying affairs is called “diminishing doing.” Only when the body is still and the heart at leisure can one contemplate the wondrous.

Yet the body of the Dao practitioner must rely on clothing and food. There are affairs that cannot be abandoned and things that cannot be discarded; one must receive them with an open mind and address them with clear eyes. Do not let them become obstacles, stirring up vexation. If affairs cause vexation, the sickness of the heart has already arisen—how can this be called a peaceful heart?

Clothing and food are the boat and oars of human life. To cross the sea, one must rely on boat and oars. Why, before crossing, would one first abandon clothing and food? The illusory is truly not worth pursuing, yet one cannot abruptly sever ties to illusion. Though there may be pursuit, do not generate a mind of gain or loss. Whether in activity or inactivity, the heart remains tranquil, seeking the same things as others yet not coveting them, obtaining the same things yet not hoarding them. Without covetousness, there is no worry; without hoarding, there is no loss. One’s traces may resemble others’, but the heart remains apart from the vulgar. This is the essential principle of conduct—one must strive to practice it.

**Exegesis**
The eye sees what is before but not what is behind, sees the surface but not the interior. To inspect all things is to see, and seeing is awakening. The eye is merely a transparent organ of crystal; seeing belongs to the heart, not the eye. When the heart is not present, one looks but does not see—this is what is meant by true contemplation. Awakening to the wondrous existence of true emptiness is called contemplation, as in the *Heart Sūtra*’s Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. The *Daodejing* says, “Constantly without desire, one observes its mysteries; constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations.” With the eye of wisdom, one contemplates the mundane, seeing the heart and the surface simultaneously—this is called comprehensive contemplation. The Buddha, with supreme wisdom, observes that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature. Mundane contemplation sees only forms and appearances, not penetrating to the nature of the heart—this is called contemplation of appearances.

True contemplation recognizes one’s original heart and knows one’s original nature, awakening to who the contemplator is. The contemplator of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva is the heart of Tathāgata; the contemplated is also the heart of Tathāgata. Contemplating the heart with the heart is contemplating ○ with ○—what is the object of contemplation? Without perception, conception, volition, or consciousness, without eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind, what is there to contemplate? Turning inward to illuminate, turning back to hear one’s own nature, the hearer is awakening itself. Self-inquiry, self-awakening, self-realization: inwardly, no notions arise; outwardly, no heart of contemplation stirs. Contemplation is freedom, ease, and spontaneity—○. Illuminating the five aggregates as empty—○—thoughts do not generate appearances, the heart does not generate dharmas, non-doing is freedom, which is the natural void—○—of the great Dao.

To generate the notion of contemplation is to create an obstacle to the wondrous. With obstacles, what can one contemplate? The obscuring of contemplation dulls the contemplator. Without generating the notion of contemplation, one removes filth and dust, ceases thoughts, and returns to emptiness—○. All affairs are perfectly resolved, leaving not a single thing. The contemplation that does not contemplate is true contemplation.

**6. On the Evil of Sensual Traces**
Though the previous section severs karmic ties and simplifies affairs, some illnesses are difficult to eradicate—one must contemplate them according to the Dharma. If the illness of sensual desire is severe, know that all defilement by sensual forms arises from thought. If thought does not arise, there will ultimately be no affair of sensual forms. Know that sensual forms are empty externally, and the heart forgets sensual desire internally—when thought is forgotten, the heart is empty.

Only the wise, through skillful contemplation, attain understanding, delight in heaven’s decree, and know fate, thus free from the suffering of poverty and illness. The scriptures say, “Heaven and earth cannot alter their conduct; yin and yang cannot reverse their retribution.” From this, we know it is true fate—what is there to resent?

It is like a brave warrior encountering bandits: wielding his sword before him, the multitude of villains scatter in flight. Once merit is established, honor and emolument last a lifetime. Now, poverty, illness, and afflictions disturb my body like bandits. Immediately rectifying the heart makes one a brave warrior. Dispelling vexations and burdens is victory; serene and constant joy is honor and emolument.

Whenever suffering comes to press upon my heart, if one does not oppose it thus, one will surely generate worry and burden—like a man encountering bandits who, instead of establishing merit, discards his armor, abandons his troops, flees, and incurs punishment. Forsaking joy for suffering—how pitiable!

If poverty and illness assail together, contemplate that this suffering arises from having a body. The scriptures say, “When I have no body, what suffering can I have?”

**Exegesis**
The true emptiness of the Limitless is pure and utterly still; stillness reaches its extreme, and the Supreme Ultimate arises. The true emptiness of the Limitless—○. The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial undifferentiated qi. The Two Modes are the qi of heaven and earth’s transformations. The Imperial Ultimate is the qi of exchange—this is the material world, human society. From the undifferentiated qi onward, all is collectively called “form,” which arises from the transformation of emptiness.

On paper, there is only blankness; the artist transforms it into a painting—blank paper is the painting, the painting is blank paper. The Limitless transforms into the Supreme Ultimate—the Limitless is the Supreme Ultimate, the Supreme Ultimate is the Limitless. A single stroke creates all things. One transformation gives rise to heaven, earth, and the myriad beings. Heaven and earth and the myriad beings are nurtured and transformed by emptiness; blank paper is transformed into a painting by the artist. Heaven and earth and the myriad beings originate from emptiness, so emptiness is form, and form is emptiness. Without emptiness, form becomes water without a source, a tree without roots. Emptiness and form are one; emptiness gives birth to being, and being returns to emptiness. Today, six billion people on Earth will all become dust in a hundred years. Emptiness gives birth to illusory appearances, and the substance of appearances returns to emptiness. The nature of awakening is fundamentally empty, neither arising nor ceasing. The Yellow Emperor said: “Heaven and earth undergo material transformation, but the principles and qi have no end or beginning.” The six billion people in today’s human society are, in essence, the ashes of the dead moving about a hundred years hence. When the principles and qi depart from the body, they immediately perish. Heaven and earth and the myriad beings are all ephemeral material forms of true emptiness, their transformations ultimately void. The six billion people on Earth consume the planet daily; the planet’s life is also ephemeral, and when its resources are exhausted, it too will perish. All appearances are illusory. The human body is a temporary, illusory vessel. One wave recedes, another rises—like the Yangtze’s waves, where the new push forward and replace the old. The tide of humanity never ceases: one generation of emperors, one generation of ministers; emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties are but scenes in a film, vanishing without a trace when the time passes. Fame and fortune, wine and women, wealth and passion, the deep love of parents, the profound affection between spouses and children—none enter the flow of the true life ○. Whether you let go or not, it is all the same. Nothing is brought at birth, nothing taken at death—why sacrifice the true luminous life ○ for greed?

All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows;
Like dew and lightning, they should be seen as such.

**7. On Supreme Stability**

Supreme Stability is the ultimate departure from the mundane, the first foundation of attaining the Dao, the success of practicing stillness, and the completion of maintaining tranquility. The body is like withered wood, the mind like dead ashes—no grasping, no rejecting, the ultimate of quiescence. With no mind to stabilize, yet nothing is not stabilized. Thus it is called Supreme Stability.

Zhuangzi said: “When the universe is supremely stable, it emits celestial radiance.” The universe is the mind; celestial radiance is wisdom. The mind is the realm of the Dao; when emptiness and stillness reach their extreme, the Dao resides there and wisdom arises. Wisdom arises from one’s original nature, not from the person. Thus it is called celestial radiance. But due to the turbidity of greed and attachment, one falls into confusion. When the nature is confused, wisdom does not arise. Once wisdom arises, treasure and embrace it, and do not let excessive knowledge harm stability. It is not difficult to generate wisdom, but difficult to refrain from using it. Since ancient times, many have forgotten form, but few have forgotten fame. To have wisdom and not use it is to forget fame—few in the world attain this, hence it is difficult. To be noble without arrogance, wealthy without extravagance, is to be free from worldly faults, thus one can perpetually maintain wealth and nobility. To be stable and unmoving, to have wisdom and not use it, is to deeply realize the true and constant.

Zhuangzi said: “Knowing the Dao is easy; refraining from speaking of it is difficult.” To know and not speak is celestial; to know and speak is human. The ancients were celestial, not human. He also said: “Those in ancient times who cultivated the Dao used tranquility to nurture wisdom. When wisdom arose, they did not employ it as wisdom—this is called using wisdom to nurture tranquility. Wisdom and tranquility nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s original nature.” Tranquility and wisdom are stability and insight; harmony and principle are virtue and the Dao. To have wisdom and not use it, to be at peace and tranquil, and to accumulate this over time, is to naturally become virtuous and attain the Dao. Naturally, one is unshaken by thunder splitting mountains, unafraid of blades crossing before one; one sees fame and profit as fleeting as a crack, and knows life and death as a bursting abscess. When the will is undivided, it coalesces into spirit; the mind’s emptiness and subtlety are inconceivable.

**Exegesis**
The entire being of the self is inherently empty, numinous, and luminous—○ fundamentally unmoving and uniquely peerless. It is only the ideations and concepts born of the Dao-body that chase after the myriad desires of the world, pursuing them relentlessly and clinging without release. To awaken to the illusory nature of life: the fleeting pleasures of wine, sex, wealth, and passion vanish when the eyes close, and all becomes empty. To sacrifice the true luminous life for this foul skin-bag, enjoying momentary false happiness and enduring eternal true suffering—one believes the foul skin-bag is enjoying, but in truth, it is the nature of awakening that perceives. How can one not know that what is obscured is the wondrous luminous light! When stability, stillness, peace, and contemplation arise, wisdom naturally becomes clear; one suddenly realizes there is no true happiness in the human world, and even extreme joy leads to sorrow. Only the Dao-body ○ abides in ease, eternally radiant; knowing true happiness and abandoning false happiness, seeking principle and awakening to the true source, one understands the natural emptiness. All passes before the eyes, the body forever without trace. Without understanding the true principle, how can the mind be stable? To awaken to the illusory nature of society and life, to know that the unarising and unceasing is true emptiness—say a thousand things, speak ten thousand words, but only self-realization penetrates all dharmas. From ancient times to the present, using the mind to measure: emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties stand above the common people, shining brightly among the masses. But in the end, when all is seen, they are but dust and mud. Whether in Supreme Stability or not, it is all the same—why not naturally and freely awaken to the true and constant?

**8. On Attaining the Dao**

**8. On Attaining the Dao**

The Dao is a matter of divine marvel—spirit-like yet endowed with nature, empty yet without form. It follows and responds in ways beyond measure, its echoes and reflections ungraspable. One knows not why it is so, yet so it is. The utmost sages attained it in ancient times, and its wondrous methods have been transmitted to the present.

The Dao possesses profound power, gradually transforming body and spirit. When the body aligns with the Dao, it unites with spirit, and this is called the "spirit-person." The spirit-nature is empty and harmonious, its essence unchanging and undying. As the body moves in accord with the Dao, it transcends birth and death. Concealed, the form merges with spirit; revealed, the spirit merges with qi. Thus, one may tread upon water and fire without harm, face the sun and moon without casting a shadow. Life and death lie within one’s own control, entry and exit occur without obstruction. The body, though but a humble vessel, is already most empty and wondrous—how much deeper and farther does its spiritual wisdom extend?

The *Scripture on the Generation of Spirit* states: "When body and spirit unite as one, it becomes the true body." The *Western Ascension Scripture* says: "When form and spirit merge as one, they endure forever." Yet the Dao of emptiness and nothingness varies in its power. When profound, it encompasses the body; when shallow, it reaches only the mind. Those who embody it become spirit-persons. Those who grasp it only in mind attain wisdom and awakening, yet their bodies still succumb to decay. Why is this? Wisdom is the function of the mind, and excessive use wearies it. At first, one delights in small insights, engaging in much debate, but this scatters spirit and qi, leaving no radiant light to nourish the body, leading to an early end. This is why the Dao is difficult to fully realize. The scriptures call this "corpse liberation."

Thus, the great ones conceal their brilliance and hide their splendor to preserve wholeness. They concentrate spirit and treasure qi, practicing the Dao without intention. When spirit and Dao unite, this is called "attaining the Dao." The scriptures say: "One who is the same as the Dao, the Dao also attains." A mountain with jade causes the grasses and trees around it to never wither. A person who embraces the Dao causes the body to endure forever. Through long cultivation, their essence transforms to become one with spirit. Refining the body to subtlety, they merge with the Dao in darkness. Their wisdom illuminates boundlessly, their form transcends all limits. They employ the interplay of form and emptiness, achieving success beyond creation. True response knows no bounds—only virtue and the Dao.

The Dao is fundamentally without gain or loss; it is only that worldly people do not know its true essence. The essence of the Dao is the awakened nature bestowed upon humanity by the great Dao of emptiness and nothingness. Laozi called this awakened nature the sole great spirit within the natural world. Confucius spoke of the wondrously awakened and spiritually penetrating rational nature. Śākyamuni spoke of the supreme, right, and accumulated awakened mind bestowed upon all beings by heaven—a mind of vast spiritual power, mysterious and boundless. From the buddhas above to all living beings below, all possess buddha-wisdom. Those constrained by qi-endowment and obscured by worldly desires are called "sentient beings." When the buddha-nature is not dimmed, unshaken by the myriad forms of the human world, one suddenly awakens to life—all is illusory and impermanent. Not seeking, not craving, this is called the "awakened one." The deluded perceive loss where there is none; the enlightened see clarity where there is no gain.

Its mystery and wonder are innate abilities, inherent in all, not achieved through cultivation or effort. It is originally the golden elixir, the precious pearl, but it falls into worldly conditions, buried by the dust of desire and impurity. Through one’s own wondrous luminous wisdom, one polishes away the dust and removes the filth of desire, and it immediately regains its clarity. Like an eye afflicted by illness, removing the obstruction restores its original brightness—medicine does not add to it. The Dao is gold within ore; refining it yields pure gold, which never returns to ore. Wood, once turned to ash, never becomes wood again. When the one nature is perfectly luminous, it abides eternally in the natural—this is called "ultimate bliss," the "immortal of great awakening that never perishes." For humans are the seeds of gods and buddhas; cultivation yields fruit. Attaining the true fruit is called "attaining the Dao." Laozi said: "The highest virtue is without attainment."

**9. On the Pivotal Wings of Sitting in Forgetfulness**

If one wishes to cultivate the Dao and become a true person, one must first abandon perverse and deviant conduct. Sever all external affairs so they do not disturb the mind. Then, inwardly observe true awakening. When a single thought arises, it must be extinguished at once. As thoughts arise, so must they be extinguished, ensuring tranquility. Next, though not attached to desires, even wandering and chaotic thoughts must be entirely eliminated. Practice diligently day and night, without the slightest lapse.

Only extinguish the moving mind, not the illuminating mind. Simply concentrate the empty mind, not the fixated mind. Do not rely on any single method, yet keep the mind constantly present. This method is profoundly wondrous, its benefits deep. Without a predestined affinity for the Dao and unwavering faith, one cannot succeed.

If one’s heart is sincerely inclined toward the supreme Dao, with steadfast and earnest faith, one should first receive the three precepts and cultivate in accordance with them. Reverence at the end must be as at the beginning to attain the true Dao. The three precepts are: first, simplifying conditions; second, eliminating desires; third, calming the mind. Diligently practicing these three precepts without slackening, one need not seek the Dao, for the Dao will come of itself. The scriptures say: "If a person can always remain pure, heaven and earth will all return to them." From this, can the essential method not be trusted?

Yet the ordinary mind is restless and competitive, its tendencies long established. Relying on the precepts to still the mind is exceedingly difficult. Sometimes one stills it but cannot hold it; sometimes one pauses briefly, only to lose it again. The struggle between departure and retention causes the whole body to sweat. With long and persistent practice, one gradually becomes adept.

Do not abandon the work of a thousand lifetimes because of a momentary failure to gather the mind. Even a slight attainment of stillness allows one, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, or amidst affairs and clamor, to intentionally calm the mind. Whether occupied or at leisure, one should remain as if without mind. In quiet or in noise, one’s resolve should be singular.

If the mind is bound too tightly, it may generate illness and qi stagnation, leading to madness or delusion—these are the signs. If the mind does not move, one must also allow it freedom, maintaining a balance between tension and relaxation, always adjusting to what is fitting. Restrain without attachment, release without indulgence. In noise, there is no aversion; in affairs, there is no vexation—this is true samādhi.

Do not, because one remains unperturbed amidst affairs, seek out more affairs. Do not, because one remains unmoved by external clamor, draw near to clamor. Regard the absence of affairs as one’s true dwelling, and the presence of affairs as mere responsive traces. Like water or a mirror, one meets things and reflects their forms. Only through skillful means can one enter samādhi. The swiftness or slowness of wisdom’s arising does not depend on human effort. Do not urgently seek wisdom within samādhi, for seeking wisdom harms one’s nature, and harming one’s nature precludes wisdom. When wisdom is not sought, it arises of itself—this is true wisdom. Though wise, one does not employ it, and true insight appears as foolishness. Thus, samādhi and wisdom mutually enhance one another, their beauty boundless.

If, within samādhi, thoughts arise, one may attract numerous demons and spirits, which manifest in accordance with the mind. Only when the mind in samādhi is suddenly unobstructed above and boundlessly open below do old karmic debts dissolve and new karma cease to form. Unentangled and free, one transcends the snares of the dusty world. With sustained practice, the Dao is naturally attained.

Those who attain the Dao undergo five stages in the heart and seven signs in the body. The five stages of the heart are:
1. More movement than stillness;
2. Movement and stillness in equal measure;
3. More stillness than movement;
4. Stillness when unoccupied, yet movement when engaged in affairs;
5. The heart in harmony with the Dao, unmoved by contact.

Only upon reaching this state does one find true peace, with all karmic defilements extinguished and afflictions no more.

The seven signs of the body are:
1. Movement in accord with the seasons, countenance harmonious and joyful;
2. Chronic illnesses vanish, body and mind refreshed and clear;
3. Premature injuries are mended, one’s original nature and life restored;
4. Lifespan extends for millennia, and one is called an immortal;
5. The form is refined into qi, and one is called a perfected person;
6. Qi is refined into spirit, and one is called a spirit person;
7. Spirit merges with the Dao, and one is called a supreme person.

If, after long practice of calming the mind, one exhibits neither the five stages nor the seven signs, one’s impure and decaying form will return to emptiness. Though one may claim spiritual awakening or even attainment of the Dao, such assertions are unfounded.

The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind perceive objective sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts, each generating attraction or aversion, their memories naturally differing. The myriad phenomena are etched within, and childhood recollections remain vivid. Forgetting and not forgetting occur naturally. Stillness is the innate capacity of life, requiring no conscious effort—original luminous wisdom arises, and ignorance vanishes of itself. Laozi said the natural is the Dao, non-action is the method, for the original state is inherently pure. Without attachment or insistence, allowing things to flow freely, the mind naturally holds neither forgetting nor non-forgetting. Non-action and non-interference leave all thoughts and perceptions unattended. It is like a host who dislikes guests; the guests, ashamed, depart of their own accord. If they do not depart, the host grows weary, and the guests uneasy. Clinging to thoughts disturbs the mind, but forgetting liberates consciousness. Random thoughts, boundless imaginings, fanciful ideas, wild cranes in leisurely flight, wandering freely without restraint—utter chaos and extreme motion are the natural state of samādhi. The world is originally without affairs; it is the ordinary person who seeks them. If the mind does not stir, whence arises disorder? To seek stillness is itself disorder. Neither thinking of movement nor stillness—what then is thought? Spontaneity is the method; naturalness is the Dao. Those who do not recognize their original mind and see their original nature cannot enter non-action. The awakened nature of perception, hearing, and cognition dissolves delusion in each thought.

**Inscription on Sitting in Forgetfulness**

Ever silent, the primordial qi remains unharmed;
Little thought, the lamp of wisdom shines within.
No anger, the hundred spirits harmonize and flow;
No vexation, the mind-ground is cool and clear.
No seeking, no flattery or fawning;
No clinging, adaptable as round or square.
Not covetous—this is true wealth and nobility;
Not careless—what fear of kings?
Taste is cut off, and numinous springs descend of themselves;
Qi settled, true breath lengthens.
At touch, the form perishes and spirit wanders;
In thought, one dreams, leaving the corpse rigid.
Qi leaks, and the form returns to the grave;
Thoughts leak, and spirit hastens to the realm of death.
Only when the heart dies does spirit live;
Only when the corporeal soul perishes does the ethereal soul grow strong.
The subtleties of all things are difficult to fathom;
Transformations do not depart from the true constant.
Supreme essence hides in the indistinct;
The great image merges with the vast and vague.
The transformations of the Dao resemble the transformations of things;
Even spirits cannot fathom its movements and concealments.
No drinking, no eating, no sleeping—
This is the true person’s sitting in forgetfulness.

When the heart forgets thoughts and cares,
One transcends the desire realm.
When the heart forgets conditions and objects,
One transcends the form realm.
When the heart does not cling to emptiness,
One transcends the formless realm.
Leaving these three realms behind,
The spirit dwells in the land of immortals and sages,
And the nature abides in the realm of purity and emptiness.

Zhang Sanfeng said: These are the Ten Discourses of Ancestor Wang Chongyang. The Great Dao of Wuji is fully contained within them. In the Kongqing Grotto-Heaven, many immortals and perfected beings have come to wander. Those who left behind alchemical formulas and Daoist teachings did so with the intention of awakening the world and liberating people. The Ten Discourses of Ancestor Chongyang are based on this same principle. Having received these teachings in the mountains, why seek other elixir herbs or gather immortal blossoms? This is the medicine of longevity, the cinnabar of agelessness. Respectfully recorded to guide those who come after and love the Dao.

Lüzu said: My nature has always been naturally so,
Originally dependent on me, not on heaven.
At midnight, the iron man reflects:
Long life and immortality are made by human effort.
A hundred years of human life are but a dream of Nanke;
The awakened one strikes the morning bell for themselves.
The Dao is transmitted by sages, but cultivation depends on oneself;
Virtue is accumulated by people, but life is decreed by heaven.
Clouds over the sea obscure the path;
The awakened one takes a single step and does not stray from the Western Paradise.
Joy, anger, sorrow, and thought are settled by the heart;
The seeds of sages, immortals, buddhas, and gods lie in the field of the heart.
The numinous sprout grows within the heart—
Seeking it outside for a hundred thousand miles is futile.

Within, embrace the Origin and guard the One—
The One Nature, perfectly luminous, is one’s own.
Seeking guests beyond the heart,
Clinging to methods not one’s own.

A single body-mind gives birth to the ten thousand dharmas.
The Dao is fundamentally empty and non-being—what use are methods?
The heart is gold within the ore;
Methods are the fire that refines it.
When the gold is wrought,
There is no fire, no ore, and no gold.

Matter is inherently without nature—
The name “gold” is but a sign.
True gold is never tainted,
Yet ore confounds it with impurity.
When the heart’s wisdom-fire arises,
The ore is purged, and gold is pure.

All contrived efforts are false fire;
True fire springs from the root of wisdom.
Without burning, the ore vanishes of itself;
Without refining, it is gold already.

Cultivation is but a provisional name—
To grasp at methods is to obscure one’s own heart.
Abandoning methods, one loses the meaning;
Neither grasping nor abandoning, one’s own truth remains.

Sunlight is one’s inherent power;
Clouds and mist arise from without.
The heart is originally pure and still—
Objective conditions are external causes.
When moonlight shines, clouds and mist disperse;
When the heart is clear, external causes vanish.

No need for contrived methods—
In non-action, my true self abides.
