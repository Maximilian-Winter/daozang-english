**Yellow Emperor asked the Celestial Master:**
*"How do all things come to move?
How do grasses and trees come to grow?
How do the sun and moon come to shine?"*

**The Celestial Master replied:**
*"Observe the nature of Heaven and Earth—
Yin and Yang are the norm.
When all things lose them, they fail to endure;
when they attain them, they flourish.
To eat Yin and emulate Yang,
consult the divine and the luminous.

The Way of eating Yin:
Empty the five viscera,
expand the three faults,
yet do not abandon the uncarved.
Its worth lies in stillness and the spirit-wind,
standing apart yet aligned—
threefold construction without completion,
then the spirit-wind arises, and the five sounds respond.

Inhale no more than five [breaths],
direct it to the mouth,
count it in the heart—
the four assistants are precious,
and the Mysterious Vessel reaches its peak.

Drink no more than five [mouthfuls],
ensure the taste is sweet,
let it reach the five viscera,
then the form will retreat to its utmost.

Strike the flesh and skin,
down to the hair’s ends—
the vessels and pores will follow,
Yin-water will arrive,
splashing against the erect Yang,
firm and unyielding, never dying.
Nourishment as guest to the body—
this is called the *Restoration of the Marvelous*,
communing with the divine."*

**The Celestial Master’s Way of Eating Spirit-Qi.**

**Yellow Emperor asked Da Cheng:**
*"Why do people lose their complexion, turning ashen and sallow?
How do they attain smooth pores and radiant, luminous whiteness?"*

**Da Cheng answered:**
*"If you wish to refine your complexion to luminous whiteness,
observe the *cuivert* [尺蠖].
The *cuivert*’s diet harmonizes Yin-Yang—
eat blue, and it turns blue;
eat yellow, and it turns yellow.
Your own complexion will shift with the five colors you consume.

If you eat Yin as your constant,
supplement with *Zhì* [柏] fruit—rich and pure,
drink the essence of the *walking-beast spring*,
you may reverse aging, restore vigor,
and achieve a smooth, luminous glow.

Gather Yin in abundance,
follow with *flying insects*,
spring *jué* [爵] birds and *yuánzǐ* [员子],
awaken the *míngxióng* [鸣雄].
The *míngxióng* is potent—
if you truly ingest this,
the *yùzhé* [玉策] will regenerate.

The Supreme Art arrives—
block the *yùdòu* [玉窦],
fill it, then send it forth;
*yuánzǐ* conveys it.
If the encounter is not firm,
place it in *mì* [].
If you truly ingest this,
you may even raise the dead."*

「The Dao of the Supreme Art’s *resuscitation through bird-essence nourishment* begins. The Yellow Emperor asked Cao Nao, *"Why do people die? Why do they live?"*
Cao Nao replied, *"Gather the bird’s essence while its life is still manifest. Wait for its *qi* to harmonize, then subtly stimulate its form. If you can stimulate its form, you may summon the five sounds, then enter its essence. The empty may be filled with vitality, the strong may endure in splendor, the aged may live forever. The method of eternal life lies in the *yùbì* [玉闭], when the *yùbì* is sealed, its *shénmíng* [神明] gathers. When the gathering is evident, the *yùbì* preserves its essence, ensuring the *yùquán* [玉泉] does not collapse, so that no hundred ailments afflict you—thus, eternal life is achieved. The method of gathering Yin must be done with a resolute heart. When form and *qi* are mutually preserved, it is said:

*'One arrival—do not disperse, and the senses sharpen;
Two arrivals—do not disperse, and vitality ascends;
Three arrivals—do not disperse, and the skin glows;
Four arrivals—do not disperse, and the spine and marrow remain unharmed;
Five arrivals—do not disperse, and the buttocks and hips grow strong;
Six arrivals—do not disperse, and the hundred vessels flow freely;
Seven arrivals—do not disperse, and misfortune departs for life;
Eight arrivals—do not disperse, and longevity extends;
Nine arrivals—do not disperse, and one attains *shénmíng* [神明].'*

This is Cao Nao’s method of gathering Yin to regulate *shénqì* [神气].

The Yellow Emperor then asked Rong Cheng, *"When the people first practice *chúnliú* [淳溜] and *xíng* [刑], why do they live? When their *xíng* [刑] is complete, why do they die? Why do some live long while others perish young? Why do some have ill fortune while others thrive? I wish to hear the reason for the people’s *qì* [气] being either relaxed or taut."*

Rong Cheng answered, *"If you wish for longevity, then observe the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Heaven’s *qi* waxes and wanes with the moon, so it endures forever. Earth’s *qi* has seasons of cold and heat, risk and ease, so Earth persists without decay. You must discern the nature of Heaven and Earth, then embody it in your own practice. There are signs to be known—even sages cannot fathom them without the Dao. The utmost essence of Heaven and Earth is born without signs, grows without form, and matures without substance. Those who grasp it live long; those who lose it die young. Thus, the adept in *qì* [气] cultivation and essence gathering must take ‘no signs’ as their accumulation. When *shénqì* [神气] overflows like a spring, they absorb *gānlù* [甘露] to store it, drink *yáoquán* [瑶泉] and *língzūn* [灵尊] to nourish their constitution, and abandon vice and excess, so their *shén* [神] may *chúnliú* [淳溜] and *xíng* [刑] naturally. The method of absorbing *qi* must be directed to the extremities, ensuring the essence is generated without collapse. Both upper and lower bodies are filled with essence—cold and warmth harmonized, life thrives naturally. Breathing must be deep and prolonged; fresh *qi* is easier to retain. Stale *qi* brings aging; fresh *qi* brings life. The adept in *qì* cultivation scatters stale *qi* at night, replenishes fresh *qi* at dawn, thus purifying the nine orifices and filling the six *fǔ* [府]. There are restrictions on nourishing *qi*: in spring, avoid turbid Yang; in summer, avoid scorching winds; in autumn, avoid frost and mist; in winter, avoid piercing Yin. Eliminate the four flaws, then practice deep breathing for longevity. The intent of morning breathing must align with Heaven—when exhaling, measure by the *guīmǎn* [闺满], as if storing in an abyss, so that old *qi* is daily exhausted while new *qi* is daily replenished, giving the body a radiant glow. When essence is abundant, one endures forever. The intent of midday breathing must be gentle—ears and eyes remain sharp, and Yin-Yin [阴阴] delights in the *qi*, preventing internal decay, so the body suffers no harm. The intent of evening breathing must be deep and sustained—keep the ears from hearing, and rest peacefully. When the soul and body are at ease, eternal life is achieved. At midnight, breathing must be slow and measured—do not alter your sleep posture, withdraw gently, and let the six *fǔ* [府] open fully, reaching the utmost limit of relaxation. To nourish the spirit for longevity, one must breathe through the pores. The essence of *qì* cultivation brings life from death and death from life. Delight in fine grains and this will fill your form—this is called *shénqì* [抟精]. There are principles in *qì* cultivation: focus on gathering essence. When essence is full, it must be dispersed; when essence is dispersed, it must be replenished. The timing of replenishment and dispersion is done at the *kuī* [窍]. Outflow and inflow must refine the *méi* [美], and when the *bái* [白] is externalized and the *chéng* [成] is internalized, what illness remains? For those born with misfortune, their Yin essence leaks away, the hundred vessels stagnate, their emotions are untimed, and they fail to grasp the Great Dao—thus, their vital *qi* departs. Common folk are born with flaws, relying on *wūyī* [巫医], yet even if they live past ten years, their forms will wither early. They praise life while hastening their own demise—how tragic! Death and life depend on the practitioner’s mastery. Seal the lower orifices to retain essence, and *qi* will not leak away. The heart governs life and death—who can undermine it? Guard diligently without loss, and eternal life spans generations. Generational longevity and ease come from accumulation. The abundance of life depends on observing Heaven above and Earth below—those who excel become divine, thus their forms dissolve. Those who understand the Great Dao move like clouds, ascending from the *shāngshān* [山], water flows far, dragons ascend high, fatigue does not weary them—*□□□□□□□* [巫成] *□□* [□□] does not die. *Wūchéng* [巫成] relies on the four seasons as assistants, Heaven and Earth as the *jīng* [经], and *Wūchéng* [巫成] and Yin-Yang as the sources of life. Yin-Yang does not die, and *Wūchéng* [巫成] and Yin-Yang regard each other mutually—those who follow the Dao are thus as well."*

*"Alcohol and five flavors, when used to regulate *qì*, sharpen the eyes and ears, make the skin luminous, fill the hundred vessels, and let Yin essence flourish. Thus, one may engage in prolonged intimacy and distant travel, achieving lasting longevity."*

Emperor Yao asked Shun, *"What is most precious in the world?"*
Shun replied, *"Life is most precious."*
Yao said, *"How should one govern life?"*
Shun replied, *"Discern the balance of Yin-Yang."*
Yao asked, *"The body has nine orifices and twelve nodes, all established and dwelling within—why does Yin essence arise with the body yet depart before it?"*
Shun replied, *"Because they do not moderate their eating and drinking, and they do not restrain their scheming thoughts. They conceal its name and obscure its form, yet its demands are excessive without any respite—thus, it arises with the body yet departs before it."*

「Emperor Yao asked, *"How should one govern this (Yin essence)?"*
Shun replied, *"One must cherish and delight in it, nurture and scheme for it, drink and eat with it. When engaging in intimacy, one must make it firm and strong yet gentle in its approach. One must absorb it fully without letting it escape, and must keep it in joy without draining it. Thus, its substance will accumulate, its qi will be preserved, and one may live a hundred years, surpassing those of earlier times."* This was Shun’s Dao of harmonizing with Yin and regulating qi.

King Wang Ziqiao’s father asked Pengzu, *"How does human qi become the most refined essence?"*
Pengzu answered, *"Human qi cannot surpass the refining of essence. If one refines qi but it stagnates and closes off, the hundred vessels will breed disease. If one fails to refine qi properly, one cannot flourish in life, and thus longevity depends entirely on this refinement. To preserve and cherish refinement, one must fully integrate it into one’s nourishment and support—this is why those who follow the Dao can clarify their essence with a mere hand’s touch or arm’s stroke, and massage their abdomen, following Yin and Yang. One must first expel the old, then inhale refined qi, breathing in harmony with it, eating and drinking in harmony with it, completing one’s nourishment of refinement as if caring for an infant. Though the infant is capricious and often restless, one must be vigilant. Thus, one may engage in prolonged intimacy and distant travel, achieving lasting longevity. In daily life, one must cultivate beauty and moderation in all things, fortifying the inner essence to perfection—what illness could then take hold? If life brings afflictions, it is because one’s Yin essence leaks away, the hundred vessels stagnate and decay, emotions are untimely, and one does not grasp the Great Dao. Then, the vital essence departs. The vulgar crowd, lacking refinement, rely on sorcerers and physicians, yet by seventy years, their form is already stunted and buried in decay. They hasten their own demise through reckless conduct—how tragic! Death and life are but a matter of mastery. The true adept seals and preserves essence, letting no qi escape. The heart governs life and death—who could then fail? Guard it with care and never lose it, and one may attain longevity across generations. Longevity across generations comes from accumulation and preservation. The abundance of life stems from observing the heavens above and spreading roots below. The capable will surely become divine, thus achieving bodily transcendence. Those who grasp the Great Dao move like clouds, ascending to the highest peaks, their water flowing far, their dragons soaring high—never weary, never exhausted. [They] [endeavor with] [all] [their] [might], achieving radiant clarity, never dying. Radiant clarity relies on the four seasons as its assistants and heaven and earth as its framework, harmonizing with Yin and Yang in their eternal generation. Yin and Yang never die, and radiant clarity watches over them. Those who follow the Dao are likewise.»

Emperor Pan Geng asked the aged sage, *"I have heard that you harmonize with Yin to grow strong, absorbing the heavens’ essence to achieve lasting longevity. Where should I begin to practice this Dao?"*
The sage replied, *"A ruler must value that which arises with the body yet grows old before it—strengthening the weak, lengthening the short, enriching the poor with abundant grain. The practice is a balance of emptiness and fullness, governed by moderation: First, let limbs hang naturally, straighten the spine, and bend the hips; Second, loosen the thighs, move the Yin, and contract the waist; Third, close the eyes and ears, inhaling to fill the [vessels]; Fourth, savor the five flavors, drink the pure waters; Fifth, let all essence ascend, inhaling the Great Brightness. Stop at five, and the spirit will daily be at ease."* This was the sage’s Dao of harmonizing with Yin and nourishing the spirit.

Yu asked Master Shigeng, *"With the wisdom of ears and eyes, I governed the world, balancing the heavy earth and following the flowing waters until I reached the Mount Kuaiji. There, I dwelt upon the waters for ten years. Now, my limbs are useless, my household is in chaos, and my governance is in disarray—how should I govern this?"*
Master Shigeng answered, *"All governance begins with oneself. When blood and qi should flow yet do not, this is called the ‘root of calamity,’ the origin of the six extremes. This is the continuation of blood and qi, the lineage of sinews and vessels—it must never be neglected. When the body is exhausted, one must apply nourishment; when the senses are dulled, one must shift tastes. Guide it with intention, move it with purpose. Without nourishment, there is no way to fill the inner and lengthen the lifespan; without intention, there is no way to know the inner balance of emptiness and fullness; without purpose, there is no way to move the four limbs and dispel illness."*

The **Way** of cultivating the spirit and **qi** is thus:

*"Awakening from sleep and drawing in the yin*—this is called **refining the sinews**;
*stretching then bending*—this is called **refining the bones**.
When movement is applied with proper measure, the vital essence flows like a spring.

Who in this world could fail to be transformed by practicing this **Dao/Way**?"

Yú then drank the **湩** (a type of fermented drink), partook of wine and the five flavors,
and used his **intention** to govern his **qi**.
His eyes became clear, his ears sharp—his skin and flesh radiant,
as the hundred vessels filled and the yin essence flourished.
Thus, his descendants were at peace, and his household returned to order.

Master Shigeng’s **Dao/Way** of cultivating spirit-**qi**.

When **Wén Zhí** (文挚) saw **Qí Wēi Wáng** (齐威王), the king asked him about the **Dao/Way**, saying:
*"I have heard that you, Master Zhí, are well-versed in the **Dao/Way**.
Though I am already attending to ancestral rites, I cannot spare the time to listen at length.
I wish only to hear its essentials—just a few words."*

**Wén Zhí** replied:
*"Your servant has expounded the **Dao/Way** in three hundred volumes,
yet **意** (intention) is its most vital principle."*

The king asked:
*"You speak of **意**—how does it relate to eating and drinking?"*

**Wén Zhí** replied:
*"Pure wine and bitter leeks."*

The king asked:
*"Why do you praise the long leeks?"*

**Wén Zhí** replied:
*"After **Jiè** (后稷) first cultivated the land, the only grass that thrived for a thousand years was leek.
Thus, it was named accordingly.
It absorbs the **天气** (heavenly **qi**) early
and retains the **地气** (earthly **qi**) well,
so those who are **懹怯** (timid and fearful) grow bold when eating it;
those whose eyes fail to discern grow clear when eating it;
those whose ears fail to hear grow sharp when eating it."*

The king said:
*"In the spring, eating it [the leek] for three months—
no minor ailments will flourish,
and tendons and bones grow stronger.
This is called the sovereign of all grasses."*

The king asked:
*"Excellent. Why do you praise wine?"*

**Wén Zhí** replied:
*"Wine is the refined **qi** of the five grains.
When it enters, it disperses and flows through the body,
penetrating the meridians and reaching every passage
without lingering in the **意** (intention) but fulfilling its purpose.
Thus, it is the foundation for all medicines."*

The king asked:
*"Excellent. But there are things contrary to your words—
why do those who suffer from spring diarrhea,
when eating leeks, not drink wine but instead eat eggs?"*

**Wén Zhí** replied:
*"That is also acceptable.
The chicken is a yang beast—
it sharpens vision, clarifies hearing,
and stretches its head while flaring its feathers.
In the three months of yin, it harmonizes with leeks,
so those who follow the **Dao/Way** eat it."*

The king asked:
*"Excellent. Why do you praise **意** (intention)?"*

**Wén Zhí** replied:
*"**意** (Intention) is not merely for sustaining life.
Ducks, geese, cranes, wildfowl, turtles, fish, and all crawling creatures
all eat and live.
But those who eat must cultivate **意** (intention) to complete their essence.
**意** (Intention) ensures that food is not wasted,
disseminates medicine, and regulates punishment [of excess].
Compare **意** (intention) to food as fire is to metal—
without it for one night, recovery takes a hundred days.
If food is not transformed, it will become like a pure mass,
breeding stagnant **qi** and dark toxins,
leading to danger, injury, and paralysis—
thus, those who follow the **Dao/Way** revere **意** (intention)."*

The king asked:
*"Excellent. I often drink late into the night—
will this cause harm?"*

**Wén Zhí** replied:
*"It causes no harm.
Consider birds and beasts—
those that eat early rise early,
those that eat late rise late.
Heaven receives the light, earth receives the dark,
and those who follow the **Dao/Way** exhaust its principles and stop.
When **qi** from food subtly enters and silently transforms,
by midnight it reaches its full potential,
concentrating at the six extremities.
When the six extremities are firm and refined,
the body becomes internally solid and externally balanced,
no rashes or sores take root,
and no abscesses or obstructions form—
this is the ultimate attainment of the **Dao/Way**."*

The king said:
*"Excellent."*

The king **Wáng Qī** arrived, and **Qín Zhào Wáng** asked him about these matters, saying:
*"I have heard that consuming **yin** (shadow/cooling) foods enhances vitality, and inhaling **qi** sharpens clarity. Where should I focus to prolong my life?"*

**Wáng Qī** replied:
*"You must align with the sun and moon and absorb their luminous **jing** (essence).
Eat pine and cypress, drink from the springs of swift-running beasts—
this can restore youth to old age and prolong vitality with radiance.

In the summer’s third month, avoid heat,
using daily sun-cooked meals—
then your spirit will be wise and your senses keen.

Following the **Dao/Way** of **yin** (shadow/cooling),
strength comes from stillness,
calm your heart like water,
let the **linglù** (divine dew) dwell within.
Use slow, measured movements—
let your heart not tremble or sway—
as the five tones approach,
discern which is short, which is long,
and inhale their **shénwù** (spiritual mists),
drink the **tiānjiāng** (heavenly brew).
Concentrate this within the five **zàng** (viscera),
so it may sink deep and abide.

Breathe like the **lóng** (dragon) at dawn,
and your **qi** will become firm and strong.
Support [your practice] with [ritual] **xiāng** (incense),
and dwell near flowing water—
then your **jing** and **qi** will remain vigorous and enduring.

When the spirit is harmonized within,
your **húnpò** (ethereal soul/spirit) will flourish,
the five **zàng** (viscera) will be steadfast and resilient,
your complexion will regain its luster,
and your lifespan will rival the sun and moon—
you will be the foremost **yīng** (hero) of Heaven and Earth."*

**Zhāo Wáng** said:
*"Excellent."*

**Hé yīn yáng** (Harmonizing **yin** and **yang**)

To harmonize **yin** and **yang**’s **Dao**/Way,

hold the hand, extend the wrist’s **yáng** (阳),
press the elbow’s **fáng** (房),
block the armpit’s **páng** (旁),
ascend the **gāng** (纲),
press the neck’s **xiàng** (乡),
press the **zhěng** (拯) and **kuàng** (匡),
cover the **zhōu huán** (周环),
descend to the **quē pén** (缺盆),
pass the **lǐ jīn** (醴津),
cross the **bó hǎi** (勃海),
ascend **héng shān** (恒山),
enter the **xián mén** (玄门),
control the **jiāo jīn** (交筋),
and elevate the **shénwù** (神雾) to invigorate the spirit—
then you may gaze long and abide with Heaven and Earth.

The **jiāo jīn** (交筋) refers to the **xián mén** (玄门)’s intersecting pulse.
When grasped and pressed, the body thrills with **yáng** (痒),
delighted and pleased, as if drawn to its **hǎo** (好).

Even if you wish not to act,
the signs appear: sighing, embracing,
to indulge in the **xìdào** (戏道).
**Xìdào** (戏道): First, **qi** rises hot above—
slowly sigh; second, **rǔ** (乳) grows firm, nose sweats—
slowly embrace; third, the tongue grows thin and slippery—
slowly **tún** (屯); fourth, **yè** (液) descends, thighs grow damp—
slowly press; fifth, the throat dries, saliva gathers—
slowly **huǎn** (撼).
This is called the five **yù** (欲)’s signs.

When all signs are present, elevate—
elevate and do not withdraw,
to gather the **qi**.
**Qi** arrives, deeply withdraw and elevate it again,
to release its heat;
then return it downward,
do not let the **qi** rest,
or else the **nǚ** (女) will be utterly drained.

Then ten **dòng** (动) arise,
touching ten **jié** (节),
and ten **xiū** (修) intertwine.
When the form is fully engaged,
direct the **qi** to the **zōngmén** (宗门),
then observe the eight **dòng** (动),
listen to the five **yīn** (音),
and perceive the ten **yǐ** (已)’s signs.

The ten **dòng** (动):
First **dòng** (动), then twenty, thirty, forty,
fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, a hundred—
**qi** flows in and out without **xiè** (泻).
One **dòng** (动) without **xiè** (泻), ears and eyes grow keen;
two **dòng**, voice and sound become clear;
three **dòng**, skin and flesh radiate light;
four **dòng**, spine and ribs grow strong;
five **dòng**, buttocks and thighs grow robust;
six **dòng**, the **shuǐdào** (水道) flows;
seven **dòng**, firmness and strength arise;
eight **dòng**, pores and **lǐ** (理) shine;
nine **dòng**, **shénmíng** (神明) becomes lucid;
ten **dòng**, the body remains constant—
this is called the ten **dòng** (动).

The ten **jié** (节):
First, **hǔ yóu** (虎游);
second, **chán fù** (蝉附);
third, **chǐ huò** (尺蠖);
fourth, **gōng jiǎo** (囷角);
fifth, **yáng zhé** (蝗磔);
sixth, **yuán jù** (猿踞);
seventh, **chán zhū** (蟾诸);
eighth, **tù wù** (兔骛);
ninth, **tíng líng** (蜻蛉);
tenth, **yú zuǐ** (鱼嘬).

The ten **xiū** (修):
First, **shàng** (上);
second, **xià** (下);
third, **zuǒ** (左);
fourth, **yòu** (右);
fifth, **jí** (疾);
sixth, **xú** (徐);
seventh, **xī** (希);
eighth, **shuò** (数);
ninth, **qiǎn** (浅);
tenth, **shēn** (深).

The eight **dòng** (动):
First, **jiē shǒu** (接手)—
to press the abdomen;
second, **shēn zhǒu** (伸肘)—
to massage and resist above;
third, **zhí zhǒng** (直踵)—
to press deeply;
fourth, **cè gōu** (侧钩)—
to press obliquely;
fifth, **shàng gōu** (上钩)—
to press below;
sixth, **jiāo gǔ** (交股)—
to pierce too deeply;
seventh, **píng yìng** (平踊)—
to press lightly;
eighth, **zhèn dòng** (振动)—
to urge the partner to hold long.

**Zhènxī** (瘛息) is inward urgency;
**chuǎnxī** (喘息) is supreme beauty.
**Lěi’āi** (累哀) is when the **yùyè** (玉策) enters and **yáng** (痒) begins;
**huì** (吙) is when **yán gān** (盐甘) is intense,
**niè** (啮) is when the body trembles,
urging the partner to endure long.

**Hūn** (昏) is when the **nán** (男)’s **jīng** (精) is strong;
**zǎo** (早) is when the **nǚ** (女)’s **jīng** (精) accumulates.
I nourish my **jīng** (精) to cultivate the **nǚ**’s **jīng** (精),
as the **qiánmài** (前脉) pulses,
skin and flesh, **qi** and blood all respond—
thus closed and blocked passages open,
the **zhōngfǔ** (中府) receives and overflows.

The ten **yǐ** (已)’s signs:
First **yǐ** (已), **qīng** (清) **lù** (露) emerges;
second **yǐ**, foul odor like **fán gǔ** (燔骨);
third **yǐ**, dryness;
fourth **yǐ**, **gāo** (膏);
fifth **yǐ**, **xiāng** (芗);
sixth **yǐ**, slipperiness;
seventh **yǐ**, **yǒu** (有);
eighth **yǐ**, **zhī** (脂);
ninth **yǐ**, **jiāo** (胶);
tenth **yǐ**, **yǒu** (有).
**Yǒu** (有) returns to slipperiness,
**qīng** (清) **lù** (露) emerges again—
this is called **dàzú** (大卒).

The signs of **dàzú** (大卒):
Nose sweats, lips turn white,
hands and feet tremble,
the buttocks do not touch the bed,
they rise and depart—
death is thin.
At this time,
**zhōngjí** (中极) **qi** expands,
**shénmíng** (神明) returns to the **zàng** (藏),
and **shénmíng** (神明) is born.

The **Dao**/Way of Heaven and Earth is the ultimate **Dao**/Way.

The **Yellow God** inquired of the **Left God**, saying: *"Why do the nine orifices and twelve joints of yin-yang all arise, yet death comes first to one alone?"*

The **Left God** replied: *"Because one does not exert their strength, does not indulge in sorrow or joy, does not favor their diet—dwelling in extreme darkness yet never exposed to light—suddenly and violently using it, without waiting for its fullness, unable to endure the dual heat, thus hastening injury. To conceal its name and obscure its form, to engage in excessive violence without propriety, is why it arises with the body yet dies first alone."*

When anger comes but is not great, the flesh is not fully engaged;
when great yet not firm, the sinews are not fully engaged;
when firm yet not heated, the **qi** is not fully engaged.
If the flesh is not engaged yet used, it becomes **wěi** (腄);
if the **qi** is not engaged yet used, it becomes **bì** (避).
When all three are engaged, this is called **sān zhì** (三诣).

The ultimate **Dao**/Way of Heaven and Earth is spoken of thus:
Like water in taste, like the **qi** of spring and autumn,
those who depart are not seen, their merit not attained;
those who arrive are not obstructed, I feast upon their offerings.
Ah! Be cautious, for the matter of **shénmíng** (神明) lies in what is closed.

When the **jade-like closure** (玉闭) is carefully managed,
**shénmíng** (神明) will approach.
In general, those who cultivate the body
must strive to accumulate **jīng** (精).
When **jīng** (精) is abundant, it must be released;
when **jīng** (精) is deficient, it must be supplemented.
At the times of supplementation and release,
deficiency and abundance must be balanced.
If one sits in harmony with it,
leaving the buttocks, anus, mouth, and nose open,
each according to its proper time,
suddenly departing and arriving,
when the utmost **jīng** (精) is about to be lost,
how can I prevent it?

Vitality and depletion have their constants;
be cautious in its use, forget not,
neither exhaustion nor excess—
let sinews and bones be strong and resilient.
With the heels pressing the **jade spring** (玉泉),
and nourishment from fragrant sustenance,
entering and exiting subtly,
awaiting fullness as the norm,
when the three harmonies of **qi** are achieved,
firmness and vigor will strengthen.

When one seeks to cultivate it,
they must first examine their words.
With the heels pressing the **jade closure** (玉闭),
one can achieve **unity with the Dao** (壹仙).
**Unity with the Dao** (壹仙) once attained:
the first movement sharpens hearing and sight,
the second clarifies voice and speech,
the third brightens skin and flesh,
the fourth strengthens the spine and bones,
the fifth fortifies the buttocks and thighs,
the sixth activates the **waterways** (水道),
the seventh achieves the utmost firmness and strength,
the eighth elevates the will and pride,
the ninth aligns with the **Heavenly Vitality** (天英),
the tenth generates **shénmíng** (神明).

**Qi** has eight benefits, yet also seven harms.
If one cannot harness the eight benefits
or eliminate the seven harms,
then at **forty-nine** (四十九) years, the yin **qi** will be halved,
at fifty, movement and rest will decline,
at sixty, hearing and sight will dull,
at seventy, the lower body withers while the upper detaches,
and the yin **qi** unused will gush forth in tears.
There is a **Dao**/Way to restore vitality:
eliminate the seven harms to dispel illness,
harness the eight benefits to double the **qi**,
thus the aged regain their strength,
and the strong do not decline.

The **virtuous** (君子) dwell in ease and comfort,
indulge in food and drink as they please,
their pores soft and dense,
their **qi** and blood abundant and full,
their bodies light and agile.
If illness enters inward yet cannot be **channeled** (道),
they will sweat, pant, and be troubled by **qi**;
if it cannot be treated,
internal heat will arise;
if one forces **qi** through medicines, cauterization, or acupuncture,
and supplements with external tonics,
yet still cannot **channel** (道) it,
they will develop **boils, tumors, or scrotal swelling** (痤肿睾);
when **qi** and blood are abundant yet the nine orifices fail to **channel** (道),
and the upper and lower body are unused,
**boils and abscesses** (痤疽) will arise.
Thus, those who skillfully harness the eight benefits
and eliminate the seven harms
will have no five illnesses.

The eight benefits:
1. **Regulating qi** (治气),
2. **Directing saliva** (致沫),
3. **Knowing the times** (知时),
4. **Retaining qi** (畜气),
5. **Harmonizing saliva** (和沫),
6. **Stealing and accumulating qi** (窃积气),
7. **Awaiting fullness** (待盈),
8. **Balancing inclinations** (定倾).

The seven harms:
1. **Closure** (闭),
2. **Depletion** (泄),
3. **Exhaustion** (竭),
4. **Neglect** (勿),
5. **Disturbance** (烦),
6. **Forced suppression** (绝),
7. **Waste** (费).

The cultivation of the eight benefits:
At dawn, rise and sit upright,
straighten the spine,
open the buttocks,
contract the **state** (州),
suppress the lower regions—this is **regulating qi** (治气);
after eating and drinking, lower the buttocks,
straighten the spine,
contract the **state** (州),
and **channel** the **qi**—this is **directing saliva** (致沫);
first engage in playful and joyous activities,
then intermingle desires—this is **knowing the times** (知时).
When doing so, straighten the spine,
contract the **state** (州),
and suppress the lower regions—this is **retaining qi** (畜气);
when doing so, neither hasten nor repeat,
but harmonize and treat the entering and exiting—this is **harmonizing saliva** (和沫);
when **qi** is about to be released,
let someone rise and release it,
then vent the anger—this is **stealing and accumulating qi** (窃积气);
when **qi** is nearly spent,
contract the spine inward,
do not move,
contract the **qi**,
suppress the lower regions,
and still the body—this is **awaiting fullness** (待盈);
when **qi** is released, scatter it,
and when angered, release it—this is **balancing inclinations** (定倾).
This is the eight benefits.

The seven harms:
When doing so, if one feels sudden pain—this is **internal closure** (内闭);
if one sweats—this is **external depletion** (外泄);
if one does not cease—this is **exhaustion** (竭);
if one reaches the point of desire yet cannot complete it—this is **neglect** (勿);
if one pants and is troubled by **qi**—this is **disturbance** (烦);
if one does not desire yet forces it—this is **forced suppression** (绝);
if one reaches the point of illness—this is **waste** (费).
This is the seven harms.

Thus, those who skillfully harness the eight benefits
and eliminate the seven harms
will have keen hearing and sight,
a light and agile body,
strengthened yin **qi**,
prolonged life and vitality,
and enduring comfort in dwelling.

Two things in life are not learned by humans:
1. **Breath** (息),
2. **Nourishment** (食).
Apart from these two,
there is nothing that is not learned through study and practice.
Thus, **nourishment** (食) is the source of life,
while **sexual indulgence** (色) is its detriment—
this is why the **sage** unites men and women only with proper restraint.

Thus:
1. **Tiger’s Flow** (虎流),
2. **Cicada’s Attachment** (蝉附),
thinking outward,
3. **Earthworm’s Inch-by-Inch** (尺蠖),
4. **Antler’s Horn** (囷角),
5. **Locust’s Severed** (蝗磔),
thinking inward,
6. **Monkey’s Squat** (猿踞),
thinking outward,
7. **Toad’s Gathering** (蟾诸),
8. **Hare’s Leap** (兔骛),
9. **Dragonfly’s Flutter** (蜻蛉),
thinking outward,
10. **Fish’s Suck** (鱼嘬).
This is called the **Ten Postures** (十势).

1. **Directing qi** (致气),
2. **Fixing flavor** (定味),
3. **Treating the joints** (治节),
4. **Laboring with fullness** (劳实),
5. **Acting at the proper time** (必时),
6. **Opening the talent** (通才),
7. **Subtle movement** (微动),
8. **Awaiting fullness** (待盈),
9. **Equalizing vitality** (齐生),
10. **Stillness of form** (息形).
This is called the **Ten Practices** (十修).

1. **Elevating it** (高之),
2. **Lowering it** (下之),
3. **Directing it left** (左之),
4. **Directing it right** (右之),
5. **Deepening it** (深之),
6. **Shallowing it** (浅之),
7. **Hastening it** (疾之),
8. **Slowing it** (徐之).
This is called the **Eight Methods** (八道).

When the **Ten Practices** (十修) are complete,
the **Ten Postures** (十势) are prepared in advance,
and the **Eight Methods** (八道) are combined with the **form** (形),
then the **form** is managed until **qi** is spent in **dusk** (昏).

「Sweat does not reach the point of streaming, yet the **Way** (道) of **qi** and blood is opened.
The throat contracts, and the front is swayed—**pulse pathways** (脉) are unblocked, and **sinews** (筋) are made supple.

Then observe the **Eight Movements** (八动),
and where the **qi** (氣) resides.
Then discern the **Five Sounds** (五言),
which follow and which precede.
**Eight Movements**:
1. **Clasping the hands** (接手),
2. **Extending the elbows** (伸肘),
3. **Flattening the feet** (平踊),
4. **Straightening the heels** (直踵),
5. **Crossing the thighs** (交股),
6. **Shaking and trembling** (振动),
7. **Lateral hooking** (侧钩),
8. **Hooking upward** (上钩).

**Five Sounds**:
1. **Throat gasping** (喉息),
2. **Panting** (喘息),
3. **Repeated sorrowful sighs** (累哀),
4. **Guttural exhalations** (吙),
5. **Gritting teeth** (啮).

Examine the **Five Sounds** to understand their **mind** (心);
Examine the **Eight Movements** to know their **delights** (所乐) and **openings** (所通).

**Clasping the hands** (接手) is to **apply** (傅) to the abdomen;
**Extending the elbows** (伸肘) is to **stroke and press** (摩且距) upward;
**Lateral hooking** (侧钩) is to **stroke the sides** (旁欲摩);
**Crossing the thighs** (交股) indicates **piercing** (刺) is excessive;
**Straightening the heels** (直踵) means **deepening** (深) is insufficient;
**Hooking upward** (上钩) means **lower** (下) does not reach the **heart** (心);
**Flattening the feet** (平踊) indicates **shallowing** (浅);
**Shaking and trembling** (振动) is the **ultimate skill** (至善).
This is called the **Eight Observations** (八观).

When **qi** rises to the surface and heat appears,
**slowly exhale** (徐呴).
When the **breasts** (乳) harden and **nose sweat** (鼻汗) forms,
**slowly embrace** (徐抱).
When the **tongue** (舌) is thin and slippery,
**slowly apply** (徐傅).
When the **lower fluids** (下液) moisten the **thighs** (股),
**slowly manipulate** (徐操).
When the **lips** (嗌) are dry and **saliva** (唾) thickens in the throat,
**slowly agitate** (徐撼).
This is called the **Five Manifestations** (五征),
this is called the **Five Desires** (五欲).
When all **Manifestations** (征) are complete,
the **Way** (道) is ascended.

Anger that does not flare intensely means the **skin** (肤) is not affected;
Anger that flares but is not firm means the **sinews** (筋) are not reached;
Anger that is firm but not heated means the **qi** (氣) is not engaged.
When all three are present, **entry** (入) is achieved.

The first **stage** (已) is **cool and refreshing** (清凉);
The second **stage** (已) is foul-smelling like **rotting bones** (靡骨);
The third **stage** (已) is **dry** (燥);
The fourth **stage** (已) is **greasy** (膏);
The fifth **stage** (已) is **fragrant** (芗);
The sixth **stage** (已) is **dense and vital** (精) like **millet and wheat** (黍粱);
The seventh **stage** (已) is **stagnant** (滞);
The eighth **stage** (已) is **oily** (脂);
The ninth **stage** (已) is **slimy** (腻);
The tenth **stage** (已) is **congealed** (迄),
then **slippery again** (复滑),
and the **morning qi** (朝气) emerges.

1. **Hairpin-like radiance** (笄光),
2. **Sealing the meridians** (封纪),
3. **Empty gourd** (瓠),
4. **Mouse-woman** (鼠妇),
5. **Grain-flesh** (谷实),
6. **Barley-teeth** (麦齿),
7. **Virgin’s flesh** (婴女),
8. **Returning to the void** (反去),
9. **Where is it lodged?** (何寓),
10. **Crimson** (赤),
11. **Crimson Pearl Nine** (赤珠九),
12. **Cavity Stone** (石).
When obtained, **do not release** (勿释).
If **death** (死) is imminent, **thin the pulse** (走理毛),
**place at the waist and heart** (置腰心),
until the **lips** (唇) are fully white,
and **sweat flows to the popliteal fossa** (汗流至腘).
The count reaches **hundreds** (百).

Every person has **talents** (善者),
but **women** (女人) are not lost—
**women** (女人) possess them,
but only the **talented** (善者) can **master** (独能).
**Do not give** (毋予) nor **treat** (毋治),
**do not act nor doubt** (毋作毋疑).
**It must be done slowly and sustained** (必徐以久),
**subtly and persistently** (必微以持).
If **already achieved** (如已) yet **not perfected** (不已),
then the **woman** (女) will attain **great joy** (大怡).

**Throat gasping** (喉息),
the **qi** (氣) descends, and **saliva** (阴) is expelled—
**radiance** (光) is **yang** (阳), **sweat** (阴) is **yin** (阴);
**Panting** (喘息),
the **qi** (氣) rises and **presses** (相薄),
and **self-control** (自容) **expands** (张).

The **accumulation of ailments** (累疾者) arises when the **anus** (尻) suffers illness and **seals the meridians** (动封纪);
The **itching** (吙者) begins when one **holds bitter** (衔甘甚) and **itching** (痒) emerges;
The **gnawing** (啮者) causes **body tremors** (身振动), **settling** (置已) yet **persisting** (久).

Thus, **male and stallion** (雄牡) belong to **yang** (阳), **yang being external** (阳者外也);
**Female and mare** (雌牝) belong to **yin** (阴), **yin being internal** (阴者内也).
All **male attributes** (牡之属) **rub externally** (摩表),
All **female attributes** (牝之属) **rub internally** (摩里).
This is called the **principles of yin and yang** (阴阳之数), the **laws of male and female** (牝牡之理).
If one **fails to grasp** (弗得) this, the fault lies in **excessive haste** (过在数已).

The **essence of delight** (嬲乐之要) lies in **slowness and endurance** (务在迟久).
If one can **delay and persist** (能迟久), then the **woman attains great joy** (女乃大喜),
**loved as brothers** (亲之弟兄), **cherished as parents** (爱之父母).
Those who **master this Dao** (能此道者) are called **Heavenly Worthies** (天士).

**The Classic of Conception** (胎产书):
**Yu** questioned **Youpin** (幼频) and said:
*"I wish to **augment births and children** (殖人产子), how should one proceed to **ensure conception** (有)?"*
Youpin replied:
*"After the **new moon** (月朔已去), within **three days**, **follow** (从之), and **conception will occur** (有子).
The **first day** yields a **son** (男),
The **second day** yields a **daughter** (女)."*

Thus, when a person **conceives** (产),
They **enter darkness** (入于冥冥) and **emerge from darkness** (出于冥冥) before becoming human (乃始为人).

**The first month** is called **Flowing Punishment** (流刑):
**Diet must be refined** (食饮必精),
**Sour broths must be cooked** (酸羹必熟),
**Avoid spicy and game meats** (毋食辛腥)—
This is called **preserving purity** (哉贞).

**The second month** begins **grease formation** (始膏):
**Avoid spicy and rancid foods** (毋食辛臊),

**Men must not overwork** (男子勿劳),

**Fruits and vegetables take effect at night** (果蓏宵效),
At this time, **no fixed rituals exist** (未有定仪),

Thus, **rulers and nobles** (君公大人)
**Must not see dwarves** (毋使侏儒),
**Must not observe monkeys** (不观沐猴),
**Must not eat** (不食) **wild ginger** (姜) **or hare stew** (兔羹);
**To conceive a son**, **place bows and arrows** (置弧矢),
**Hunt male pheasants** (雄雉),
**Ride stallions** (乘牡马),
**Observe male tigers** (观牡虎);
**To conceive a daughter**, **wear hairpins and earrings** (佩簪珥),
**Adorn with pearls** (绅珠子)—
This is called **internal symbols forming the child** (内象成子).

**The fourth month**, when **water is imparted** (水授之),
**Blood begins to form** (乃始成血).
**Rice and wheat** are consumed,
**Fish is served in a vessel** (觯鱼),
To **clarify blood and brighten vision** (以清血而明目).

**Qi begins to form** (乃始成气).
**Rise late and bathe early** (晏起□沐),

**Avoid cold misfortunes** (避寒殃).
**Rice and wheat** are eaten,
**Cow and sheep broths** are prepared,
**Mixed with tiaojiu** (和以茱萸),
**Avoid** (毋食) **bitter foods** (□),
To **nourish the qi** (以养气).

**The sixth month**, when **metal is imparted** (金授之),
**Tendons begin to form** (乃始成筋).
**Labor in moderation** (劳□□□),
**Roam the wilds** (出游于野),
**Frequently observe running dogs and horses** (数观走犬马),
**Must consume** (必食) **sour and bitter** (□□),
**Though** (未) **rituals are unclear** (□□□□),
This is called **transforming the skin and tendons** (变腠□筋),
**Adjusting the pores and vessels** (□□□□).

**The seventh month**, when **wood is imparted** (木授之),
**Bones begin to form** (乃始成骨).
**Dwell in dry places** (居燥处),
**Do not remain stationary** (毋使定止),
**...[text fragment unclear]...**
**Avoid cold in diet** (饮食避寒),
**...[text fragment unclear]...** to **preserve teeth** (美齿).

**The eighth month**, when **earth is imparted** (土授之),
**Skin and hide begin to form** (乃始成肤革),
**...[text fragment unclear]...**
This is called **densifying pores and vessels** (密腠理).

**The ninth month**, when **stone is imparted** (石授之),
**Hair and fur begin to form** (乃始成毫毛),
**...[text fragment unclear]...**
**...[text fragment unclear]...** to **observe carefully** (伺之).

**The tenth month**, when **qi stagnates** (气陈),
**It becomes a **fetus** (以为胎).

**Prescriptions for Nourishing Life:**
[The aged shall not rise...]

**Prescriptions for Nourishing Life (continued):**

**For the Aged Who Cannot Rise:**
[If the aged cannot rise,] the stench of the body may be [treated] by [certain means]—when harmonized, it will [then] descend.
One method: **Preparation of *Dianji* (棘) Decoction**
Take *Dianji* thorns, each one inch long, three *dou*—[boil them] until they are thoroughly refined. Use a *gu* vessel to cook them until the liquid is thick and the thorns are firm. When boiling ceases, let it settle, then cook again.
If this is too troublesome, take two and a half *dou* of thorns, place them in an old earthenware vessel, and boil them with two *dou* of *ju* millet until done. When the *qi* is ripe, [let it steep] for ten days in coldness—it will then dry. [After drying,] soak it again. After two days, it becomes *jiang* (浆).
When ready, drink one *sheng* of this decoction near the inner chamber. If the decoction is not yet ready, squeeze its juice and mix it with the decoction, making it sour and sweet—then drink it. Even if the aged are [still] unable to rise, this will make them rise immediately.
[The method of] preparing *jiang*:
Another method: Soak [the thorns] in *wu* (乌) [liquor] until it is ripe. There is also [another method].
**Making *Li* (醴):**
To make *li*, take *shu* millet and rice, [and follow the process]—when the rice *li* is ripe, each morning, take it to satiate thirst, and [continue] as before.
**For Those Who Cannot Rise:**
For those who cannot rise, in the morning, prepare good water congee and [consume it] to satiate thirst, as before. [Do this] twice, and they will rise.
Do not [overdo it]. If unused for two days, [reheat with] hot water and [consume it]. If [still] unable to rise, take one sip, then another, then a third—do not exceed three sips. Afterward, use [additional] methods.
When sipping, do not do so consecutively—[pause] between sips. If already applied, splash with cold water, and do not [forget to] sip again.
When eating and drinking, [after spitting out water,] be sure to [inhale] the *qi* with an open mouth, facing upward. Gradually exhale through the nose, then [retain the *qi*]—this benefits the aged.
**Additives (加):**
In the fifth month on the full moon, gather *lai* (莱) and *lan* (兰), dry them in the shade, and refine them. Also refine white pine resin—[use] equal parts of each. Wrap them well with leather, and drink one dose daily.
Each time you drink, take a pinch [of the mixture] with three fingers into wine, [and consume it]. This will strengthen vitality and improve mobility. Even if taken in the morning or evening, it is effective.
[For those who are] weak.

**For the weak:**

On the full moon of the fifth month, gather the *lai* (莱) and *lan* (兰) from the *xiang* (乡) region, place them in a keyhole-shaped container filled to capacity. Let the container be five *zhang* (丈) long, place it in a steamer, and cook with a bamboo basket. When the steam rises, remove it, and repeatedly refine it until its nature is unknown. Then take the medicine from the container, as large as millet grains, and consume it.

Another method: In the fifth month, prepare *fúlíng* (茯苓) when it turns yellow, then refine and store it well—this is beneficial.

Another method: For treating the middle [region], cut *wū* (乌) [herb] and refine it, then consume it in wine. This is the method of *xiān* (酰).

**For making wine:**

**Making wine:** Use three *dòu* (斗) of fine wine to steep *mài* (麦) [grain], fermenting it into wine for consumption.

For men who are weak, use *lì* (醴) wine to cook *xiè* (薤).

**Treatment:**

Take one male *huángfēng* (黄蜂), crush it fresh, and bathe in wine. Dry it in the shade and refine it, adjusting the quantity like *huángfēng* itself. Soak it in wine for three days, then consume four *cùn* (寸) of the cured meat. This is sixty-five doses.

Another method: Take twenty *huángfēng* (黄蜂), place them in a cup of *lì* (醴), and drink it at noon for ten doses.

Another method: Take one hundred *huángfēng* (黄蜂), steep them in a cup of fine soy sauce for one day and one night, then use the liquid to soak *jiāng* (饘) and *zōu* (糗) in a ratio of nine *shēng* (升) and two *shēng*. Each meal, consume it with wine, taking a pinch with three fingers.

Another method: *Lǚ Lè* of *Pínglíng* (平陵), dry the *zhǎn* (蠃) worm in the shade and refine it. For twenty doses, use seven pinches; for ten doses, use three pinches, with one cup of wine.

**Barley eggs:**

**Barley eggs:** Regularly, in the morning, crush *mài* (麦) eggs into wine before drinking. Drink twice the next day, three times the following day; then drink once more, twice, and three times again. Thus, consume two eggs entirely, strengthening vitality and enhancing beauty.

Another method: In the eighth month, gather *túlú* (菟芦) seeds, dry them in the shade, separate the kernels, and refine them, wrapping them in leather. By spring, use the juice of a female bird’s egg to coat them, forming pills the size of mouse droppings. Dry them in the shade, then place eight pills in a bowl of bean sauce and consume them with food.

Another method: In spring, take one bird’s egg, crush it, and mix it into *zōu* (糗) to form pills the size of large *niú* (牛) lice. Consume many of them for benefit.

Another method: [Text incomplete] For those who have already dried and refined [the substance], [method unclear].

One method states: To treat *yīn* (阴, "yin" imbalance), soak [the pills] in bean sauce within [a certain container]. **◎◎** [unclear] **To enhance male potency:** Soak *bó* (勃, "vigorous") *lǎn* (蠃, *Lan* or *Bole* fungus) in [a substance] for fifteen days, then use the soaking liquid to treat the male—male potency is strengthened.

**To cauterize (灼):** On the fifteenth day of the fifth month, gather *bó lǎn* (勃蠃), soak it in [a substance] within a linen cloth, dry it in the shade, and heat it with [a substance]. **Easy method:** Take dried ginger, cinnamon, *yǐn* (蔈, *Yin* or *Atractylodes*) root, *shé jiā* (蛇蚧, "snake scales"), and [missing], all refine them, weigh equally, mix with honey or date paste to form pills the size of a finger’s tip, wrap them in coarse linen, place them inside [a container], and heat them gently.

Another method: In the fifth month, gather three *dòu* (斗, "dou" measure) of *pú bó* (蒲薄蠃, *Pu Bole* fungus) and two *dòu* of *táo* (桃, "peach") fruit, pound them together, put them in a jar, and pour three *dòu* of fine *jiàng* (酱, "fermented bean sauce") over them. Seal the jar, bury it in the ground, and let it ferment for three *cùn* (寸, "inches"). Cover the top with a *dù* (杜, "plug") so it is level with the earth. Boil it continuously for four days, then filter and discard the dregs. Use the liquid to dye a three-*chǐ* (尺, "feet") length of cloth, dry it in the shade, and dye it again repeatedly. When the liquid is exhausted, wrap the cloth well, ensuring it is not coarse. **When used:** Cut a piece as large as a palm, insert it into the nostrils—it causes great itching and heat; when pressed against the arm, the arm becomes itchy, firm, and hot. Do not let it touch the face, for if it does, the itching is unbearable. Adjust the amount of cloth accordingly.

**To increase sweetness (益甘):** [Text unclear] *Fú líng* (茯苓, *Poria*) is removed from its dregs, and its juice is used to fatten *pí* (豯, *Pi* or *Pigweed* seeds). Feed this to women to make them more sweet and beautiful.

Take a cow’s cheek, roast and refine it, together with dried ginger, *jūn guì* (菌桂, *Jun Gui* or *Fuling* and *Guizhi* mixture), and [missing], all combined, put into a pouch, and soak it in [a substance]. **Place it inside [a container].**

Another method: **Extract the juice,** and mix it with cow or deer *xiāo* (殽, "minced meat"), instructing women to insert it into their **vaginal orifice (戒, *jie* or *vaginal cavity*)**.

Another method: Peel and soften [a substance], remove its upper **noxious layers**, and finally cut it finely. Boil it until the **qi (气)** is fully extracted and the liquid is clear, then discard the turbid part. Reboil the clear liquid until it is exhausted; when dry, pound it finely, and place it below [a container]. When the time is right, sprinkle it with water and let it steep for seven or eight days before use.

Another method: Take **unhatched bird eggs (不鷇者)**, and with one meal, consume four of them, **drenching the mouth** with their liquid, then dry them in the shade. When dry, **use them**.

**For playful purposes (戏):** Those who **do this**, take the *shǒu gōng* (守宫, "eunuch" or *Toad-headed Lizard*), and **soak it in [a substance] for a long time**. Then, bury it below the **mouth (口)** of [a container], deeply. **Dye the cloth** with its extracted juice, and use it to dye a woman’s arm.

When a woman and man engage in **playful intimacy (戏)**, the cloth **immediately breaks or tears**; when **ejaculation occurs (去)**, it **immediately departs**.

Take the *shǒu gōng* and place it in a new jar, then place **cinnabar (丹)** in the jar, allowing the *shǒu gōng* to consume it. When it dies, refine it, and **paint the woman’s arm or body** with its juice.

When she and a man engage in **playful intimacy (戏)**, she **becomes infertile (不明)**; when **used**, it **is discarded**.

Remove its hair.

**Removing Hair (去毛):**
If one wishes to remove hair, let them first bathe with fresh breast milk, then bathe the lower body before the upper. The hair will then depart.

Another method: Fry the neck of a white toad with a earthworm, mix with spiderwebs and bitter gourd, and quench with iron. Then apply its juice to the body.

Another method: In the fifth month, pluck the hair and apply it with a mixture of *chēnglǐ* (称醴, "measured wine").

**For Severe Swelling (病最肿):**
For severe swelling: Refine willow bark (*liǔ gē*), mix it thoroughly with fat and grease, and apply to the swelling. Then wrap it with cloth. When done, proceed with the *Convenient for Nearness to the Inner* method.

**Convenient for Nearness to the Inner (便近内):**
To prepare the *Convenient for Nearness to the Inner* formula: Take the root of the *prettle thorn* (颠棘, *diān jí*), slice it into pieces of one *cùn* in length, two *shēn* (参, "hands"), and dry it well. Then take a fully black male *mó* (雄□, likely 雄蜂, "male bee"), crush its heart, brain, and chest (with wings intact) into a powder, and boil it with two *shēng* (升) of water in an old iron steamer. When the liquid becomes thick and concentrated, strain it and remove the dregs. Then boil the heart, lungs, and liver of a black *liè* dog (骘犬, "black dog") aged over one year, and strain the liquid through thick, concentrated layers with *wú* (芵, unclear—possibly 麻, "hemp"). Mix these five substances together and use them to soak the cloth. When the time comes, remove it and dry it. When thoroughly dry, refine it again.

Another method: For *Convenient for Nearness to the Inner*, take four *dòu* (斗) of millet, four *dòu* of good-quality curdled milk, four *fèn* (分) of *tiān mǔ* (天牡, "heavenly male," likely a type of male substance or animal), and peaches the size of dates. Take seven male *liú* (蝼, "mole cricket") heads and one *shāo* (赣, unclear—possibly 蛇, "snake") skin, and mix them with half a *shēng* (升) of *tiān shè* (天社, "heavenly community," likely a type of insect or medicinal substance). Soak all these in the curdled milk. When done, strain the liquid and soak a piece of fine cloth one *chǐ* (尺) in length. When the soaking is complete, dry it, then soak it again. When the juice is exhausted, apply *gǔ* (榖, unclear—possibly 枸杞, "goji berry") and *yǐ* (椅, unclear—possibly 桐, "paulownia") juice to the cloth and dry it again. Store it well.

When used, hold it with a *yù* (玉, "jade") staff while riding, and the stallion will become aroused. The *tiān shè* is the insect that feeds on peach and plum blossoms. The *táo kě* (桃可) is the peach when its hair is still present. The *mǔ liú* (牡蝼) are the heads of mole crickets. The *shāo* (赣) skin resembles that of a snake.

Another method: Burn *yáng sī* (杨思, unclear—possibly 杨树皮, "willow bark"), spread a cloth beneath it, and collect the falling ashes. Mix them with the juice of the cloth, then use the cloth to stimulate the female, and the stallion will become aroused.

**Lightening the Body and Enhancing Vitality (轻身益力):**
If one wishes to lighten the body, take the substances discarded by humans after consuming *yáng sī* (杨思), *hóng mǐ* (红蜜, "red honey"), and *bān huáng* (斑黄, unclear—possibly 斑蝥, "blister beetle"), and mix them together. Use this as a post-meal supplement. In spring and autumn, consume four *dòu* (斗) each of *yáng sī*, *hóng mǐ*, and *bān huáng*, along with *tiān mǔ* (天牡) to nourish and strengthen the body.

Another method: For *Convenient for Nearness to the Inner*, take two *qì* (萩, "lespedeza") pods, refine them, and soak in one *shēn* (参) of water. Extract the juice well, then soak the cloth in it. When the time comes, remove it and dry it thoroughly. If it is not dry, soak it again.

Another method: Dry the male mouse’s kidneys in the shade, refine them, and mix with the crushed eggs of a *yì* bird (邑鸟, unclear—possibly 鹦鹉, "parrot"). Apply this to a new cloth.

When used, stimulate both male and female with it.

Another method: Take one *dòu* (斗) of *dìng yíng* (岪嬴, unclear—possibly 丁香, "clove"), divide it into two parts, and soak one part in wine before exposing it to the sun. On winter days, place it above the fire until it boils thoroughly, then remove the *dìng yíng* and refine it. The rest is as before—soak the cloth in it and exhaust its juice. Then apply it to the cloth and use it to stimulate the male, causing the female to also become aroused.

Another method: Take four *dòu* (斗) of *bàng* (蠃, unclear—possibly 蚌, "clamshell"), four *dòu* (斗) of good-quality curdled milk, four *fèn* (分) of *tiān mǔ* (天牡), and peaches the size of dates. Take seven male *liú* (蝼) heads and one *shāo* (赣) skin, and mix them with half a *shēng* (升) of *tiān shè* (天社). Soak all these in the curdled milk. When done, strain the liquid and soak a piece of fine cloth in it. When the juice is exhausted, the process is complete.

When used, moisten the cloth and hold it with a jade staff while riding, and the stallion will become aroused. The *tiān shè* is the insect that feeds on peach and plum blossoms. The *táo kě* (桃可) is the peach when its hair is still present. The *mǔ liú* (牡蝼) are the heads of mole crickets. The *shāo* (赣) skin resembles that of a snake.

Another method: Burn *yáng sī* (杨思), spread a cloth beneath it, and collect the falling ashes. Mix them with the juice of the cloth, then use the cloth to stimulate the female, and the stallion will become aroused. This lightens the body and enhances vitality.

Another method: For the cloth, take the substance discarded by humans after consuming *yáng sī* (杨思), *hóng mǐ* (红蜜), and *bān huáng* (斑黄), and mix them together. Use this as a post-meal supplement. In spring and autumn, consume four *dòu* (斗) each of *yáng sī*, *hóng mǐ*, and *bān huáng*, along with *tiān mǔ* (天牡) to nourish and strengthen the body.

The Dao/Way permeates all under heaven, and where there is Dao/Way, life emerges; where there is no Dao/Way, death ensues. This is the great virtue/power of the Dao/Way. When anger does not manifest greatly, the skin is not affected; when it is great but not firm, the sinews are not affected; when it is firm but not heated, the *qi* is not affected. If the skin is not affected but one acts, it will be excessive; if the sinews are not affected but one acts, it will be evasive; if the *qi* is not affected but one acts, it will be sluggish. Therefore, the sage must regulate these.

**The Dialogue of the Dao/Way:**
