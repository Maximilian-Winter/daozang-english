**"The Inner Landscape Classic of the Yellow Court: Chapter One of the Highest Clarity – Before the Purple Mist Sovereign of the Highest Clarity**

The Highest Dao Sovereign, Lord of the Jade Dawn,
In leisure dwells within the Reed-Pearl Palace,
Transforming the Five Forms and dispersing myriad spirits—
This is the Yellow Court, called the Inner Classic.

With a heart like a zither, thrice resonant,
Dancing in the embryo of the Immortal—
The Nine Qi radiant, emerging from the celestial expanse,
A spirit child born, veiled in purple mist.

This is the Jade Scripture, to be refined with care,
Singing it ten thousand times ascends to the Three Heavens.
A thousand calamities dissolve, a hundred ailments cured—
Fearless before the ferocity of tiger and wolf,
Even old age is repelled, and eternal youth prolonged.

**Chapter Two of the Highest Clarity – The Celestial Framework**

Above, the soul and spirit;
Below, the vital essence of the *Guān Yuán* (關元).
To the left, the *Shào Yáng* (少陽);
To the right, the *Tài Yīn* (太陰).
Behind, the secret gate;
Before, the birth gate—
Inhaling the sun, exhaling the moon, preserving breath.

Where the vital essence converges, the starry hosts are divided,
And the purple mist ascends and descends, the Three Pure Ones’ clouds.
It irrigates the Five Palaces, nurturing the spirit root,
The Seven Elixirs flow through the cavern, surging toward the *Lú* (庐).
Returning to the purple, embracing the yellow, entering the *Dān Tián* (丹田),
The hidden chamber’s light illuminates the *Yáng Mén* (陽門).

**Chapter Three on the Mouth – The Jade Pool, the Grand Harmony Bureau**

The mouth is the Jade Pool, the Grand Harmony Bureau,
Rinsing and swallowing the elixir, no calamity remains.
The body emits radiance, its qi fragrant as orchid-lantern,
Repelling and extinguishing a hundred malevolent forces—
The jade refines the countenance.

If one diligently practices, one may ascend to *Guǎng Hàn* (廣寒).
Day and night without rest, the True Way is achieved—
Thunder roars, lightning flashes, the spirit merges and dissolves.
**Chapter Four on the Yellow Court**."

**Chapter Five on the Central Pool**

Within the Yellow Court, the inner person wears brocade robes,
Purple flowers fluttering skirts, clouds of qi woven fine.
Crimson and verdant branches—emerald spirits’ willows—
Seven jade *yuè* (玉龠) sealed, twin doors shut tight.
Double fans guard the golden gate, mechanisms sealed deep,
Mysterious springs in lofty halls, their grandeur sublime.
Within the Three Fields, vital essence grows faint—
A graceful maiden, slender, veiled in celestial glow.
The Hall of Grand Splendor shines with eightfold might,
Heaven’s Court and Earth’s Gate arrayed like cauldrons and axes.
The Spirit Platform, firm and unyielding, never decays.

**Chapter Six on the Celestial Center**

Within the Central Pool, the spirit wears crimson pearls,
Silken robes of cloud-dyed crimson, sashes bearing tiger talismans.
The Crossed Ford, three inches wide, is where the spirit dwells—
Hidden mushrooms, shadowed and dense, mutually supporting.
The Celestial Center’s peak: if one practices with precision,
The Cloud Abode clears, the Jade Emperor takes flight.
Paths open, unending, without rest.
Brows bear the *huàgài* (華蓋) canopy, covering bright pearls.
Nine Abysses—sun and moon—pierce the void, empty.
Within the dwelling lies the True Constant Robe of elixir:
If one sees it, no ailment shall plague them.
Crimson pearls, luminous skirts, radiant as *huāxiān* (華茜),
Beneath the tongue, the *yīngxián* (膺玄) generates the shore of life and death.
Emerging from green, entering black—two breaths resplendent.
If you encounter this, you ascend to the Celestial River.

**Chapter Seven on the Ultimate Dao**

The Ultimate Dao requires no labor—its secret lies in authenticity.
The *níwán* (泥丸) and hundred joints each hold spirit:
The spirit of hair is *Cānghuá* (苍华), named *Tàiyuán* (太元),
The brain’s spirit-root is named *Níwán*.
The spirit of eyes is *Míngshàng* (明上), named *Yīngxuán* (英玄),

The spirit of the tongue is *Tōngmìng* (通命), named *Zhènglún* (正伦),
The spirit of teeth is *Éfēng* (峨峰), named *Luōqiān* (罗千).
The spirit of the face is governed by the *níwán*.
The *níwán* holds nine true essences, each with its chamber—
Square and round, one inch in measure, here they reside.
Within, the inner person wears purple robes, flying skirts of silk.
But think on this one truth, and longevity knows no end.
Not separate dwellings—all within the brain they sit,
Ranked in order, facing outward.
Each exists in the heart, corresponding as one.

Day and night they exist, ensuring eternal vitality.
The lungs are the ninth chamber—
Their office resembles a *huágài* (华盖).
Below sits a child in *Yùquè* (玉阙).
The seven *yuán* (元) children regulate the *qi* (气).
They correspond externally to *Zhōngyuè* (中岳)—the nose and navel.
Wearing robes of white silk and a yellow cloud sash,
Their panting breath reveals a body unwell.
Swiftly preserve the *Bái Yuán* (白元) and harmonize the six *qi* (气).
The immortals, long observing, face no calamity.
Employing them ceaselessly brings no stagnation.

**Chapter Ten on the Heart**
The heart’s chamber is *Lián hán huá* (莲含华).
Below dwell children of the *Dānyuán* (丹元) family.

Wearing robes of green silk, jade skirts, and golden bells,
They harmonize and temper the soul and spirit, balancing *jīnyè* (津液).
Externally, they correspond to the eyes—*rìyuè* (日月) clarity.
A hundred remedies dwell here, none lacking.
Used together for seven days, they become fully replenished.
At the brink of death, focus on the spirit, and life returns.
Capturing the soul and restoring the spirit ensures no decline.

**Chapter Twelve on the Kidneys**
The kidneys’ chamber is *Xuányīn pǔ* (玄阴圃).
Within sits the *Míngshàng Xuán* (冥上玄) child.
They oversee the six *fǔ* (府) and nine *yè* (液) sources.
Externally, they correspond to the two ears and hundred *yè* (液).
Wearing robes of dark silk and cloud-patterned attire, they dance with *lóngpán* (龙潘).
Ascending, they bring forth *díxiá* (的霞)—*rìyuè* (日月) mist.
A thousand calamities and diseases demand urgent preservation.
The two *shuǐwáng* (水王) face the *shēngmén* (生门).
They enable eternal life, ascending to the ninth heaven.

**Chapter Thirteen on the Spleen**
The spleen’s office belongs to *Wùyǐ* (戌已).
Within sits the *Míngtóng* (明童), clad in yellow.
They dissolve grains and disperse *qi*, preserving teeth.
They are the *Tàicāng* (太仓) dual *míngtóng* (明童),
Sitting within the nine-layered *Jīnhéchéng* (金合城).
Square and round, one inch—the *mìngmén* (命门) chamber.
They regulate the hundred grains and five *zhǔxiāng* (朱香).
They repel *xūyíng* (虚赢) and prevent injury.
Externally, they correspond to the *chǐzhái* (尺宅) and its fragrant *qìsè* (气色).
The luminous *huá* (华) manifests clearly.
Wearing yellow silk and jade robes with tiger-patterned sashes,
They reflect the *Sānlǎozǐ* (三老子) in lightness and grace.
The high immortals attain eternal life, far from death’s reach.

**Chapter Fourteen on the Gallbladder**
The gallbladder’s chamber is the six *fǔ* (府) essence.
Within sits the *Yào Wēimíng* (曜威明) child.
Eight thunderous vibrations shake the *yùjīng* (玉旌).
The *lóngqí* (龙旗) waves across the sky, hurling *fǎlíng* (火铃).
They command all *qìlì* (气力) and control the *hǔbīng* (虎兵).
Externally, they correspond to the *yǎn tóng* (眼童) and *bízhù* (鼻柱).
They support the brain’s hair, making it vibrant.
Wearing nine-colored silk robes and green *huákūn* (华裙),
They adorn golden sashes and jade *lónghǔwén* (龙虎文).
They can preserve clarity, ascending upon the *chéngyún* (庆云).
They command ten thousand spirits, bowing to the *Sānyuán* (三元).

**Chapter Fifteen on the Length of the Spine**
The spine’s length is marked—

**Chapter Fifteen on the Length of the Spleen**
The spleen stretches one *chǐ* to veil the *Tàicāng* (太倉).
Within its chamber, *Lǎojūn* (老君) forges the *Míngtáng* (明堂).
Its name is *Língyuán* (靈元), *Hùnkāng* (混康) by virtue.
It heals a hundred maladies, consumes the grain of life.
In yellow robes and purple sashes, bearing *lónghǔ* (龍虎) emblems,
It lengthens what withers, sustains life through the sovereign’s grace.
Three invocations of its name—spirits respond in kind.
Three elders sit together, each with their own retinue—
Some refined, some embryonic, each holding their own method.
*Táohái* (桃孩) unites to prolong the *Shēnghuá* (生華).
Male and female *Yóuyóu* (徊尤) bear the *Táokāng* (桃康).
*Dàofù* (道父) and *Dàomǔ* (道母) face each other across.
*Shīfù* (師父) and *Shīmǔ* (師母) dwell in the *Dānxián* (丹玄) realm.
One may ascend the *Xūkōng* (虚空) through contemplation.
Divergent paths converge at the final essence.
Close the *Sānguān* (三關), grasp firmly and pause.
Swallow golden *jīnlì* (金醴), ingest *yùyīng* (玉英).
Thus, hunger vanishes, the *sānchóng* (三蟲) perish.
Mind and intent remain harmonious, joy unbounded.
The *Wǔyuè* (五岳) clouds rise, *Pénghéng* (彭亨) in might.
They nourish the *Yùlú* (玉庐), repaying themselves in kind.
The five forms remain unbroken, free from calamity.

**Chapter Sixteen on Upper Vision**
Upper vision beholds the *Sānyuán* (三元) like linked pearls,
Scattered luminous scenes illuminating the nine quarters.
The *Wǔlíng* (五靈) night torches blaze across the eight regions.
The *Nèihuáng* (內皇) abides within—let us wander together.
Clad in wind-garments, bearing the *hǔfú* (虎符),
One arrives swiftly, soon ascending to the void.
Within the *fāngcùn* (方寸), deep thoughts are concealed.
Not square, not round—windows and shutters sealed,
The three spirits return essence, vigor renewed.
*Sǔn* and *pò* (魂魄) guard internally, uncompetitive.
Spirit is born in the abdomen, clutching a jade *yuán* (珰).
*Sù* (靈) flows into the *yōuqù* (幽阙)—how could it be lost?
The *Lín* (琳) banners stretch ten thousand *zhǐ*—
The three *hún* (魂) rest in peace by imperial decree.

**Chapter Seventeen on the Spiritual Platform**
The *Língtái* (靈台) is dense with mist, gazing upon the yellow wilderness.
A three-*cùn* (寸) chamber holds high and low.
Between the *jiànxué* (間阙) and *yíngwèi* (營衛), the *Gāoxuān* (高玄) receives.
The *Dòngfáng* (洞房) stands at the *Zǐjí* (紫极), the sacred threshold.
This was revealed by the *Tàishàng* (太上) of old—
To my left, the *Shén Gōngzǐ* (神公子) speaks divine words.
To my right, the *Bái Yuán* (白元) stands without.
Within the *Míngtáng* (明堂), the *Jīnxīà* (金匮) and *Yùfáng* (玉房) lie between.
The *Shàngqīng* (上清) man stands before me.
In yellow robes, his *dānqì* (丹氣) swirls ceaselessly.
Asked where he resides, he points to the space between the brows.
Within, the *Rìyuè* (日月) and *Xiù* (宿) array themselves.
The seven luminaries and nine *yuán* (元) crown the *Shēngmén* (生門).

**Chapter Eighteen on the Three Passes**
Within the three passes, *jīngqì* (精氣) runs deep.
In the nine *Wēi* (微), darkness and obscurity dwell.
The mouth is the *Tiānguān* (天關), the seat of spirit-machinery.
The feet are the *Dìguān* (地關), where life’s vitality wanes.
The hands are the *Rénguān* (人關), governing flourish and decay.

**Chapter Nineteen on Obtaining [the Dao]**
If one obtains the three officials and preserves the *Xuándān* (玄丹),
The *Tàiyī* (太一) flows its pearl upon *Kūnlún* (昆仑).
Layered towers and pavilions encircle twelve times—
Ascending from high to low, all are true persons.
The *Yùtáng* (玉堂) deciphers characters of the *Xuánguān* (玄官).
The *Xuánhu* (璇玑) and *Wánghéng* (王衡) annihilate the *Lán* (蘭).
Gazing upon the child seated on the *Pánhéng* (盤恒),
Who asks, *"Whose child am I within my body?"*
This person may depart, entering the *Nílóng* (泥龍).
Thousands upon thousands connect in unbroken lines,
Each ten, each hundred, like towering mountains.
*Yún Yí* (雲儀) of the five *Huá* (華) stands at the ear-gate.
The *Chìdì* (赤帝) and *Huánglǎo* (黃老) share my soul.
The three *Zhēn* (真) escort *Xūshū* (胥吏) to the *Fángjīn* (房津).
The five *Dǒu* (斗) shine brightly as the seven *Yuán* (元).
The sun and moon traverse the six *Hé* (合).
The imperial domain lies at the center of heaven and earth’s threshold.
Within the face, *hún* and *shén* (神) intertwine eternally.

**Chapter Twenty on Breathing**
Breathe the *yuángqì* (元氣) to seek immortality—
The *Xiāngōng* (仙公) and *Gōngzǐ* (公子) now approach.
The *Zhūniǎo* (朱鳥) inhales and exhales from the *Báishí* (白石) source.
Condense essence, nurture the embryo, transform the body.
Retain the embryo, preserve essence—thus, eternal life.
The three *qì* (氣) hover to the right, illuminating the nine paths.
The *Zhēnyī* (正一) contains the *huā* (華), filling completely.
Gazing afar, the mind is like the *Luóxīng* (羅星).
Beneath the *Jīnshì* (金室), it may not topple.
Extend my white hair, return to infancy.

**Chapter Twenty-One on the Jade Chamber**
Within the *Qióngshì* (琼室), the *Tàisù* (太素) gathers.
The *Ní* (泥) Nine Ladies stand at its center.
The *Chánggǔ* (長谷) *Xuánxiāng* (玄鄉) encircles the suburbs.
The six *lóng* (龍) scatter, flying—difficult to distinguish.
To prolong life, be most cautious in the *fángzhōng* (房中).
Why die and cause the spirits to weep?
Sudden calamity strikes the three *líng* (靈).
But inhale the breath, record the child-essence.
An inch of field, a foot of dwelling—life may be governed.
If one must drain the sea, read it a hundred times.
When the leaf falls, the tree withers, losing its verdure.
When *qì* dissipates and *yè* (液) leaks, the form is no longer one’s own.
Seal tightly, guard the scene—thus, enduring peace.
Preserve my *Nílóng* (泥龍) and the three *Qí* (奇) spirits.
Serene and detached, vision turns inward, self-illuminating.
Things do not intrude—tranquility prevails.
Alas, if one neglects this, old age returns like a thief.
Meditate on the *Yùshū* (玉書) of the *Tàishàngqīng* (太上清).

**Chapter Twenty-Two on Constant Meditation**
Constantly meditate on the three chambers’ interconnectedness.
Perceive the void—no inner, no outer.
Preserve and rinse the five *yá* (牙), free from hunger and thirst.
*Sùhuá* (神華) holds the towel; the six *Dīng* (丁) pay homage.
Guard the *Jīngshì* (精室) carefully, lest essence be wasted.
Seal it and treasure it—thus, longevity.
Rising from the body’s depths, it is never distant.
The three officials are near, easily concealed within the *Yì* (易).
Empty and still, the void within is pristine.
If the form is thus, it should not be defiled.
The nine chambers stand in perfect emptiness, the abode of spirit.
Store thoughts, regulate actions—six *fǔ* (府) must be refined.
Then, soaring freely, one enters the celestial path.

**Chapter Twenty-Three on Nurturing Life**
The Dao of nurturing life is simple, not burdensome.
Cultivate *Dòngxuān* (洞玄) and the *Yùpiān* (玉篇).
Practice the eight *jǐng* (景) within the form—
Twenty-four *Zhēn* (真) emerge naturally.
Elevated and unforced, *húnpò* (魂魄) find peace.
The *Qīngjìng* (清靜) spirit speaks to me.
Where does it reside? Between the purple curtains.
Standing or sitting outside, the three-five *Xuán* (玄) gather.
Burning incense, extending hands before the *Yùhuá* (玉華),
Together, we enter the *Tàishì* (太室), the *Xuánhu* (璇玑) gate.
High and serene, the *Tiǎndàn* (恬澹) garden of the Dao.
The inner spirit gazes deeply—truth is revealed.
The true person dwells within—do not seek beyond.
Where else would one search for causes and effects?

**Chapter Twenty-Four on Concealing One’s Presence**
Conceal your form, differ from the world.
Retain the breath, nourish the essence—lips like vermilion.
Carry the *Xìngmìng* (性命), guard the void.
The *Dàshàngqīng* (大上清) removes death’s record.
The three spirits rejoice in seclusion.
Swiftly wandering, free from sorrow.

**Chapter Twenty-Five on the Five Phases**
Feathered robes complete, the eight winds drive—
Reining the chariot of three silks, riding the morning’s glow.
The golden palanquin stands firm, following the jade carriage—
Why not ascend the mountain to recite my scriptures?

The *Yùyù* (郁郁) caverns conceal the true person’s ruins.
Entering the mountain—what difficulty? Yet hesitation lingers.
The world’s turmoil stinks like rotten grain, swirling chaos.

The Five Phases shift yet return to One.
Three-five *qi* converges, nine-nine rhythms align.
One may employ the hidden earth to restore the eight methods.
The *Fùniú* (伏牛) seclusion, the *Yōuqióng* (幽阙) ranks arrayed—
The Three Clarities bloom at life’s threshold.
The *Dòngfáng* (洞房) spirit-forms contend with sun and moon.
Father is the *Níwán* (泥丸), Mother the *Cīyī* (雌一).
The Three Lights radiant, entering the *Zǐshì* (子室).
Preserve the *Xuánzhēn* (玄真)—all matters complete.
One’s spirit-essence must not be lost.

**Chapter Twenty-Six on High Flight**
High flight—sun and moon, my Dao ascends.
*Yùyí* (郁仪) binds the phosphorescence, well-guarded.
Then the *Yùqīng* (玉清) Old One of void appears,
Capable of reversing age, filling the blood-brain.
Mouth holding the spirit-beam, bearing the Five Sovereigns,
Waist girded with the Tiger Ledger, jade pendants hung.
Swiftly ascending, meeting life’s banquet at *Dōngméng* (东蒙).

**Chapter Twenty-Seven on the Primordial Origin**

**Chapter Twenty-Eight on the Immortal**

Refine the primordial soul and vital breath—
One thing, vast and mighty, now revealed.
Only the utmost truth allows a glance—
Beware the deadly *qi* and filth of death.
The Six Spirits gather in the void, at ease.
Form the pearl, secure the essence, nurture the spirit-root.
Jade spoon and golden key ever firm and whole.
Close the mouth, curl the tongue, consume the fetal fluid—
Thus I attain refinement, grasp the flying immortal.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine on the True Person**

The Immortal, the Daoist—no divine essence they possess,
But accumulated essence and *qi* make them true.
The Yellow Boy’s subtle tones are hard to hear,
Jade scrolls and red tablets bear the sacred text.
Their name: *Zhēnrén*—golden cap, golden veil.
Shouldering armor, holding talismans, they open the Seven Gates.
Fire soldiers and talismans guard the spirit pass.
Advance with head high, retreat with humility, arrayed above and below.
Wielding a sword a hundred *zhang* long, they dance with silk banners.
Ten miracles swirl in empty space, their fire-bells tolling through the clouds.
Where are they stationed? Between the brows at the Yellow Gate—
This is not branch or leaf, but the true root.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine on the Purple Clarity**

**Chapter Thirty on the Purple Clarity**

The Purple Clarity, the Sovereign of the High Dao,
The Lord of the Great Mysterious and Great Harmony stands firm and upright.
He transforms and gives birth to all things, making me an Immortal.
Ascending in flight to the Ten Heavens, he rides the Jade Wheel.
Day and night, seven days without respite, he thinks without sleep.
If the child can practice this, they may live eternally.
Accumulating merit and refining essence is not innate—
It comes from sincerity and steadfastness.
Within, he guards the unshakable essence, the truest of truths.
In emptiness, he remains tranquil and serene, attaining spirit naturally.
**Chapter Thirty of the Hundred Grains**

The Hundred Grains are the essence of the Earth’s soil,
Five flavors beyond, the stench of demons and spirits clings.
Foulness disrupts the divine clarity, and the prenatal *qi* vanishes.
How then does one return to youth and reclaim infancy?
The Three *hún* spirits drift, the *pò* soul crumbles and collapses.
Why not eat the *qi* of the Great Harmony’s essence?
Thus, one may not die—Great Yellow is at peace.
**Chapter Thirty-One on the Heart Canon**

The Heart Canon is one body, the sovereign of the Five *Zàng* Organs.
In motion and stillness, its thoughts are the Dao of virtue and power.
Pure and clean, it nurtures good *qi*, radiating natural light.
Whether seated or standing, it is my shared foundation.
By day, it governs the seven orifices; by night, it hides the five *zàng*.
It regulates the Hundred Grains’ essence, harmonizing *yin* and *yang*.
**Chapter Thirty-Two on the Meridian Circulation**

Circulating through the Six Extremes, hidden at the *mào* and *yǒu* points,
The spirit of the Two Kidneys sustains longevity.
Descending and transforming at the *dòu* star’s initial ninth,
Knowing the male to guard the female, one may never age.
Knowing white, one sees black—urgently seated in vigilance,
**Chapter Thirty-Three on the Liver *Qi***

The Liver’s *qi* surges, pure and long.
It arrays the Six Palaces, generating the Three Lights.
The Heart’s essence is guarded, its intent unwavering within—it does not topple.
Above, it unites with the Three *Jiāo*; below, it flows as Jade Essence.
The Mysterious Liquid ascends like clouds, leaving no trace of foulness.
It cures ailments, strengthens teeth, and refines the True Form.
Drawing the Mysterious Dew from the Great Bright Hall,
It irrigates the throat, making the divine spirit pass through.
Seated in wait beneath the Noble Canopy, it wanders to the Capital of Honor.
The Three Emperors’ banner sways, cool and clear.
Five-colored clouds swirl, verdant and lush.
Closing the eyes, it gazes inward and beholds itself.
It commands all spirits of the Heart to return and revere one another.
The Seven Mysterious Essences bloom at the Gate of Life—
Opening the Dao’s path, preserving the Mysterious Root.
At two hundred and ten years, one may still return.
Beyond this, guarding the Dao is truly difficult—
Only the Ninefold Refining into the Jade Elixir awaits.
To restore essence and thought, one must preserve the Seven Elements.
The radiance of the Sun and Moon rescues the aged and broken.
The Liver’s *qi* circulates endlessly without cessation.

**Chapter Thirty-Four on the Lung**

The Lung, as *qi*, arises from the Three *Jiāo*.
It perceives and listens in the depths of darkness, awaiting the Boy.
It regulates the Five Lights, making teeth and hair grow.
At thirty-six, the Jade Pool opens in the throat—
The Hundred Meridians begin to circulate, and the blood flows.
Complexion glows like gold, hair and teeth black as jade.
If this true spirit is preserved without decline,
One must remember this official has his seat.
All spirits gather, turning to seek me—
I hide myself.

**Chapter Thirty-Six on the Spleen**

Hidden beneath the feathered canopy, gazing at the Heavenly Abode,
I worship the Sun in the morning, joyfully calling out to its brilliance.
The **Splendid Spirit** of the Eight Decrees stands firm, repelling malevolence.
The Spleen’s spirit returns to its home—**the Stomach**—
Nurturing the **Soul Root** so it never withers.
Sealing the **Gate of Fate**, safeguarding the **Jade Capital**,
Ten thousand spirits now feast, with life abundant and more.
This is called the **Spleen**’s foundation in the **Central Official**.

The **Spirits of the Five Zang and Six Fu** shine as sovereigns,
Uniting with the **Heavenly Gate** in the **Great Hall of Brightness**.
Preserving the **Female** while cultivating the **Male**, attaining the Three Radiances,
Externally refined, internally rounded—**the Spirit dwells within**.
The meridians circulate freely, the Five Zang flourish.
Bones turn verdant, veins crimson, marrow like frost.
The **Spleen** rescues the Seven Orifices, banishing ill fortune.
Sun and Moon align, setting the **Yin** in place—
The two spirits converge, transforming into **Jade Essence**.

Pale yet flavorless, the **Heavenly Human’s** nourishment,
The **Child’s Elixir** is served—**properly refined**—as **Proper Yellow**.
Then it is called **Lingao** and **Jade Dew**.
The **Supreme Daoist** hides the **Encircled** and **Pure Jade**,
Irrigating and enriching the Eight **Liquids**, the **Kidneys** receiving the **Essence**.
It rests in the **Great Yin**, revealing its form.
The **Wind of Three Mysteries** ascends, first manifesting as **Azure**.
In a fleeting moment, it reaches **Pure Clarity**.
Seated upon the **Whirlwind Platform**, it sees the **Crimson** and **Verdant** born.
In the **Free Domain**, it radiates **True Nourishment**, flourishing the **Five Lights**.
Within, it gazes silently, refining the Five **Forms**.
The Three *Qi* hover about, attaining **Spiritual Clarity**.
The **Hidden Dragon** vanishes into the **Recluse’s Herb**, its **Lingao** essence—
It can sate hunger, sustaining all spirits.
Above, the **Mystic’s** covering; below, the **Tiger’s** chapter.
Bathing in **Splendidness**, **Chapter Thirty-Six** is complete.

Bathing in **Luxuriance**, casting aside **Grease and Fragrance**,
Entering the chamber, facing east, reciting the **Jade Scripture**,
Binding the **Ten Thousand Circulations**—its meaning is now clear—
Loosening the hair, free of desire, to preserve its existence.
When the Five **Officials** have all returned, **True *Qi*** is restored.
Smooth the heart, quiet the mind—**haste, vexation, and resentment** are gone.
The **Ninefold Counting** is fulfilled; the **Body, Spirit, and Essence** are refined.
The **Yellow Splendor** and **Jade Maiden** declare their **Child’s** intent.
The **True Person** having arrived, the Six **Heavenly Worthies** appear—
They then bestow the **Hidden Herb** and the **Great Cavern Scripture**.
Ten recitations, four bows—worship the **Supreme Daoist**,
First paying homage to the **Great Emperor**, then facing north.
The **Yellow Court Inner Scripture** and **Jade Book** flow freely—
The giver says, *"Teacher,"* the receiver replies, *"I pledge."*
Wrapped in **Cloud Brocade** and **Wind Silk**, bound with **Golden Fastenings**,
To replace the **sacrificial cutting of flesh and hair**.
Hand in hand, ascending the mountain, they **confront the Elixir**—
The **Golden Scripture** of **Master Wang** is now revealed.
