# 重阳真人金关玉锁诀

The **Zhuangyang Zhenren’s Precious Dao of the Golden Pass and Jade Bolt**

Someone asked, *"How is the Dao of cultivating the True One’s essence?"*

The reply was: *"First, eliminate the nameless afflictions. Second, refrain from clinging to wine, lust, wealth, and qi. This is the very method of cultivation."*

Now, a human body contains the principles of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth nourish all things, and all things flourish within Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are vast and luminous, they are never obscured by the myriad things. Those who cultivate the Dao should likewise embody all things in their responses. But someone might object: *"Heaven has darkness and obscurity; Earth has tremors and shifts. Mountains may crumble; seas may dry up. The sun and moon wax and wane. Even humans fall prey to unpredictable sickness—how can one govern these?"*

The reply was: *"To govern them, one must practice the **Supreme Dao’s** method of refining the Five Phases."*

Someone asked, *"What is the method of refining the Five Phases?"*

The **Precious Dao** states: *"First, one must uphold the **Precepts**, maintain purity and stillness, and endure suffering."*

「Compassion and mercy are the true benevolence. Cutting off the Ten Evils, practicing skillful means, and rescuing and guiding all beings. Loyalty to the sovereign and filial piety toward parents and teachers—these are the methods of cultivation. Then, one practices the **True Function**.

The **Precious Dao** states:
*"First, within the body’s East and West, one must recognize **Gēng-Jiǎ-Wèi-Yǒu** (the Heavenly Stems of Metal and Wood). Second, within the body’s South and North, one must recognize **Kǎn-Lí-Qiān-Yòng** (the Water-Fire and lead-mercury correspondences).*

The **Precious Dao** further states:
*"**Gēng-Jiǎ-Wèi-Yǒu** (Metal-Wood Heavenly Stems) pertain to **day and night**. **Jiǎ-Wèi** (Wood-Fire) are the **qi of the liver**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Spring** and **Spring Equinox**, the mouth produces **saliva (jīn)**. **Gēng-Yǒu** (Metal-Fire) are the **qi of the lungs**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Autumn** and **Autumn Equinox**, the mouth produces **fluid (yè)**.*

***Kǎn-Lí** (Water-Fire) pertain to **cold and heat**. **Lí-Qiān** (Fire-Metal) are the **central qi of the body**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Summer** and **Summer Solstice**, the body produces **blood**. **Kǎn-Yòng** (Water-Metal) are the **qi of the kidneys**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Winter** and **Winter Solstice**, the body produces **essence (jīng)**. Essence generates the **ethereal soul (pò)**; blood generates the **corporeal soul (hún)**. Essence is **innate vitality (xìng)**; blood is **life (mìng)**. Those who comprehend **innate vitality and life** have attained the **True Function** of cultivation.*

The **Precious Dao** states:
*"Essence and blood are the **foundations of the physical body**; **True Qi** is the **foundation of vitality and life**. Thus, it is said: **Where there is blood, there is the ability to generate True Qi**; where True Qi is robust and substantial, **longevity follows naturally**. Essence and blood coalesce to form the body.*

Someone asked: *"Yet, you are a human."*

Why do some die before others?
The answer is: Those who die first are those whose hearts cling to desire and pleasure, who covet the world. For men, this depletes their **essence**; for women, it depletes their **blood**. By day, they never cease their nameless vexations; by night, they fail to subdue the **Three Corpses** and **yin ghosts**. Thus, men and women alike already bear the mark of impermanence.

Someone asked: How then do some not die?
The answer is: Those who do not die are those whose bodies are pure and still, who cherish **True Qi** in the **elixir field**. Their **essence** and **blood** do not decay—such a person does not die.

A challenge was raised: Many today practice purity and abstinence, yet still fail to attain the **Dao**. Why is this?
The answer is: Though these people may be outwardly pure, they do not grasp the **True Purity and Stillness**. Though their bodies may be still, they cannot stabilize their **essence** and **blood** or nourish **True Qi**. Their bodies may be pure, but their minds are not; their forms may be still, but their intentions are not.

Have they not heard the *Scripture on Purity and Stillness* say:
*"The **Dao** has purity and impurity, motion and stillness. Purity is the source of impurity; motion is the foundation of stillness."*

The **Scripture** further states:
*"Without defilement, there is no purity. If one speaks of **True Purity and Stillness**, then within the eyes, there are no tears; within the nose, no pus; within the mouth, no saliva. One does not refine the large and small excretions. Men cultivate **essence**; women stabilize **blood**. All malevolence returns to harmony; all diseases do not arise."*

Now, the **Dantian** attains true purity and stillness.
Yet today’s talk of "purity and stillness" is but a hollow name.

In cultivation, when inner and outer align,
The **Great Vehicle** first speaks of the **Lesser Vehicle**.
The *Heart Sutra* says:
*"Capable of small, capable of great—
It does not first speak of the past,
But first speaks of the present.
The past is fruit; the present is function.
It further says:
'Function fulfilled, fruit complete—
Before speaking of the True,
It speaks of the False.'
Only the One Soul is True;
The four great elements of the fleshly body are False.
Through mutual borrowing, False refines into True,
And unity is achieved through sensation and harmony.
The secret says:
'Now, a body at ease is the **Lesser Vehicle**—
Yet it is the root of the **Great Vehicle**.
The initial ground of **dharma**-heart is the **Lesser Vehicle**,
While its fruition is the **Great Vehicle**.
The **Lesser Vehicle** is the root;
The **Great Vehicle** is the branch.'
The secret says:
'Branch and root borrow from each other—
The branch borrows the root to arise.'

Yet those who cultivate today
Do not know whence the body comes,
Nor how **nature** and **life** are born.
The secret says:
'All arise not apart from yin and yang.
They must borrow from **father’s essence** and **mother’s blood**—
These two are the body’s foundation.
Yet those who cultivate today
Do not spare **father’s essence** or **mother’s blood**,
Dissipating **True Qi** and damaging **Original Yang**.
Thus comes aging,
And from aging, disease,
And from disease, death.
Since impermanence exists,
Why not cure it?

The True **Dao** is:
Empty yet real, real yet empty.
The *Scripture* says:
'**The Great Dao** has no form,
Yet gives birth to heaven and earth.
**The Great Dao** has no name,
Yet nourishes all things.'
So too is the one born from True **nature**—
Thus it is.

In days past, **Laozi** refined the five phases—
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—
Leaving behind three **Vehicles** of wondrous speech:
Each line erases sin,
Each phrase brings longevity.

First: **Divine Immortals** embrace **Oneness**.
Second: **Wealth for the nation, peace for the people**.
Third: **Strong armies, victory in battle**.

**Question:** What is *"Divine Immortals embrace Oneness"*?
**Answer:** Oneness is the root of all under heaven,
The root of all things—
Oneness is the **Dao**.
In the beginning, it was **True Water**.
Water gave birth to **qi**,
And **qi** gave birth to water.
All things arise from Oneness,
All things are nourished by Oneness.
Oneness generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates all things.
Within Three, the Four **Wisdoms** function,
The Five **Eyes** manifest.
The Six **Senses** arise,
The Seven **Ghosts** are swept away,
The Eight **Trigrams** unfold,
The Nine **Reflections** speak of True **Dao**.
Relying on the **fruit of non-delusion**, all is harmonized—
Mind and thought become divine,
Dwelling eternally in the **Dantian**.
Embrace and guard the **Original Qi**,
Lest it scatter and be lost.
This is the method of **embracing Oneness**.

**Question:** What is *"Wealth for the nation, peace for the people"*?
**Answer:** Within the bodies of men and women,
Each holds nine rivers and four seas.
In the **Dragon Palace’s treasury** lie
Seven treasures and eight jewels—
Do not let the Six **Bandits** steal them.
This is wealth for the nation, peace for the people.

**Question:**

What is *"strong armies and victory in battle"*?
**Answer:** He who achieves victory in battle
Is known by few in the world.
Victory in battle
Is the eternal method.
**Objection:** You have spoken of the Way of Purity and Stillness—
How can you speak of victory in battle?
**Explanation:** Today’s people do not comprehend the method of victory in battle,
Yet they can still treat the diseases of decay and impermanence.
Victory in battle consists of three stages:
First, battle and retreat the nameless afflictions.
Second, within the night’s realm,
Battle and retreat the Three Corpses and ghostly demons.
Third, battle and retreat all phenomena.
This is the method of victory in battle.
If one attains the Three Vehicles,
They transform calamity into blessing.

The practitioner must always take Purity and Stillness as the foundation.
For those who seek the Great Vehicle,
They must first seek the Small Vehicle.
Purity does not depart from impurity,
Action does not depart from stillness.
Within stillness, movement arises;
Within impurity, purity emerges.
There are Heaven and Earth,
There are Sun and Moon,
There are Water and Fire,
There are Yin and Yang—
This is called the True Dao.
The scriptures say:
*"Pure Yang does not generate,
Pure Yin does not grow.
When Yin and Yang harmonize,
They can generate all things.*
Yet today’s cultivators
Do not cultivate the True Dao.
The Dao is the comprehension of nature and life.
Nature and life are essence and blood.
All the myriad diseases of man
Are injuries to one’s life.
Those who suffer illness
Do not harm the Five Viscera directly—
They all deplete the Three Treasures of essence, qi, and blood.
To seek peace and longevity,
One must uphold the awareness of Purity and Stillness.
For those not yet out of the household life,
If they cannot yet uphold the fruit of Purity and Stillness,
They may enter the Small Vehicle, then the Middle Vehicle, then the Great Vehicle.
The first stage is the City of Transformation,
The second is the Silver City,
The third is the Golden City.
Like a great tree—
First, there is its root,
Then, its branches.

As for ordinary times, one should only follow Purity and Stillness—
This is the Great Dao/Way indeed.

The questioner asks:
*"Suppose one’s body is in a state of Purity and Stillness,
Yet encounters a day when the Heavenly Demons* **assail**—
How should one treat it?
And if one encounters an External Dao/Way practitioner* **who wanders**,
How should one treat them?"*

The answer is:
*"The wandering one is a boundary.
Boundaries exist everywhere.
One must only discern how to advance or retreat.
Three principles must be clearly distinguished—pure and impure.
If one encounters a practitioner of Yin-Yang Dao/Way*,
One must apply the method of **adding fire to water**,
**Repelling impurity without scorching**—

The secret is:
*"When the Demon army arrives,
One must urgently prepare to **inspect the Three Thousand* **Qi-Refining* **Warriors**.
The secret is:
The **Three Thousand* **Qi-Refining* **Warriors** are the **qi** of one’s body.
If **qi** comes but does not depart—counting to a thousand breaths—
One must gather it in the **Dan Tian** without letting it disperse.
Only **warmth** is allowed,
**Coldness** must be avoided.
This is the **self-formed embryo of the Immortal**—
The **wondrous method** indeed.
If a person attains such wondrous refinement,
They will forever possess this **true qi-function**.
When the function is complete and the fruit fulfilled,
They will forever achieve peace and longevity.
All cultivators,
When facing calamity,
Must carefully prepare.

The questioner asks:
*"How should one treat it?"*

The explanation is:
*"When a person faces calamity,
They first perceive the **signs of death**.
The questioner asks:
*"What are the signs of death?"*

The secret is:
*"The **Heavenly Pillar** trembles,
The **Tree of Life** falls, mountains crumble.
The **Six Spirits** are disordered,
Life and vitality cannot be preserved.
The **spirit and mind** grow dim,
Heaven and Earth darken,
Sun and Moon lose their radiance—
This is the **sprout of Impermanence**.
A **leaky body** is **Hell**,
A **non-leaky fruit** is **Heaven**.
For a person with a **leaky body**,
If they attain the **perfected non-leaky fruit**,
All will together fulfill the **Dao-fruit**.

The questioner asks:
*"Suppose the White Ox departs..."*

How should one capture it?

The secret is:
When the White Ox departs, tightly grasp the **Mysterious Pass**,
Firmly secure the **Four Gates**.
Swiftly employ the **ancestor’s fishing method**,
And also use the **Three-Island Seal**.
Point to the Yellow River flowing backward,
Cover the **Golden Pass**,
Merge into the **Jade Lock**.
Like cutting an eye—
The White Ox will naturally not flee.
This is called the **method of emerging from the water and reaching the opposite shore**.

There are **ten methods** to stabilize life and vitality.
The secret is:
1. The **Golden Pass Jade Lock Stabilization**
2. The **Three-Island Revival and Exchange of Life and Death Stabilization**
3. The **Nine-Bends Yellow River Backward Flow Stabilization**
These are the methods for attaining the **perfected non-leaky fruit**,
All together fulfilling the **Dao of Immortality**.

If one achieves the stabilization of the **Precious Moment**,
Do not let it stagnate the **waist and limbs**,
Or dim the **eyes and vision**—
This is the method of stabilizing the **Three Treasures**.

The questioner asks:
*"If someone captures the Three Treasures,
Where should they transfer and store them?
First, use the **Reed and Cattail Piercing-the-Knee method**,
Boil the **qi** to surge into the **Precious Furnace**,
Carry the **qi** straight to the **Well’s Spring**,
Supplementing the **two feet**.
Then perform the **Seven Circulations of the Elixir method**,
If the **qi** stagnates and weakens the **waist and limbs**,
Then practice the **Iron Chariot Black Ox function**.
Then open the **Slaughter Gate**.
If one attains **original essence** strong and robust,
First practice the **Posterior Elbow Flying Golden Crystal method**.
If one does not practice this function,
Then do not practice the **Piercing-the-Knee method**,
Nor the **Seven Circulations of the Three-Island method**,
Then practice the **Posterior Elbow Transferring Essence to Supplement the Brain method**.
Aspiring to **eternal life and youth**—
Nowadays, people practice **functions**,
Attending to the **upper** but neglecting the **lower**.
Like a child building a tower,
The foundation is not firm.
What is the way?
The **central essence** must be solid and strong.

Again, in the **Kan Palace**,
Use the **Sheep, Deer, and Great Ox Three Vehicles**,
Transfer from **Jing Mountain** to store the **Precious Essence**.
The secret is:
Jing Mountain is nearby,
There was a man surnamed **Bian** named **He**.
One day,
He went to **Jing Mountain** to gather firewood.

Then he saw a phoenix perched upon a stone.
Bian He knew there was treasure within the stone.
He brought it to the emperor.
The emperor flew into a great rage,
And had Bian He’s feet amputated.

The secret says:
Bian He—this is *recognition*.
The stone—this is the stubborn *qi*.
The phoenix—this is the true *qi* forming its body.
The jade—this is the marrow’s essence.

Amputation—this is the inability to practice the Piercing-the-Knee method.

The secret says:
Those who excel in stillness
Are called *Lower Yuan Treasure* complete.
Like the sun and moon in harmony,
Then use the Three Vehicles to transport to the Kunlun Peak above.

He sighed:
Nowadays, people can speak of the Dao but cannot embody it.
They can explain but cannot reveal the secrets.

Again, he said:
When practicing functions,
The mind moves, but the intention does not.
Nowadays, many are deluded.
They do not cultivate their bodies.

First:
The divine nature is the Great Ox Vehicle.
One must seek the movement of the Green Ox to pull the vehicle.
The treasure within the vehicle is the Deer Vehicle.

Second:
Practice the White Ox to pull the vehicle.
The treasure within the vehicle is the same.

Third:
When warm *qi* moves greatly, this is the Sheep Vehicle.
The Red Ox pulls the vehicle.
The treasure within the vehicle is the same.

The Three Vehicles in motion first depart from the tail of Jing Mountain and the *Yúlǘ* pass.
They enter the Earth’s axis,
pass the Celestial Gate,
pass the Lower Double Gate.
The *Shènyú* acupoints mark the waist,
the legs descend into Caoqi Creek’s earth.
The *Jiājí* halts at the Double Gate—
*Jiājí* itself.
The double arrows ascend to Shangyuan’s rocky ridge, the Dividing Waters Peak—
also called the Heavenly Terrace Ridge,
or the Women’s Treasure-Carrying Ridge.
Place *ruxiang* resin at the front,
frequently advance the True Fire.
If this practice is followed,
a woman’s body in one year becomes like a boy’s.

Imagine the lead-mercury dual elixir—
shoot toward Penglai’s brain, where it opens.
The Celestial Gate itself opens, revealing crimson clouds.
True *qi* enters the marrow sea, warming it,
making one’s hair turn white, then black again.
This is called the *Elbow-Post Flying Golden Crystal* method.

My teacher said:
All see the well-digger,
but none see the rope’s use.
Though later-born ones possess divine water,
they still lack the Return-to-the-Dantian method.

When practicing, the *Zi-Wu* hours arise—
sit cross-legged, knead the hands,
as if True *qi* seethes through the body.
Pass the Celestial Bridge,
pass the forehead’s cranium—
only guide the upper and lower cheeks.
Use the mind to divide above,
letting True *qi* flow downward in two streams.
The primal *yang* essence
descends to the cheeks,
then flows upward through the teeth,
from the left mouth corner to the right,
extracting the fluid.

Again, the **Black Pearl’s Ambrosia** is refined—
the **Red Dragon** stirs it evenly.
When rinsed, it becomes **Snowflower White**,
with a sweet taste.

The mouth is an **Eight-Colored Glass Canal**,
where **Eight-Flavored Waters** dwell within.
From these waters arise the **Eight Consciousnesses**.
When the mouth holds **True Qi**,
that **Qi** divides into the **Eight Trigrams**:

**Gèn** marks the **Spring Equinox**,
**Zhèn** the **Spring Solstice**,
**Xùn** the **Summer Equinox**,
**Lǐ** the **Summer Solstice**,
**Kūn** the **Autumn Equinox**,
**Duì** the **Autumn Solstice**,
**Qián** the **Winter Equinox**,
**Kǎn** the **Winter Solstice**.

Within the **Eight Trigrams**, yin and yang arise;
within yin and yang, cold and heat divide.

**The Secret says:**
Swallowing saliva is **yin**—
then guiding the breath afterward makes it **yang**.
One must seek the **Water-Fire Balance**,
dividing the **Clear Saliva** into three parts—
swallow two parts, keep one in reserve,
lest the **Tree wither and dry**.

It is also said:
*"Cherish the flowing water—*
*do not let rivers run dry."*

**On the Seven Returns:**
**The Secret says:**
Swallowing **Divine Water**,
when it reaches the **Lung’s Preface**,
it transforms into fluid,
healing all coughs.
Gradually, it nourishes the **Po**.

It is also said:
Swallowing saliva to the **Heart** opens wisdom,
cleansing the mind—**Divine Water for the Heart**.
The **Ode of Washing the Heart to See Nature** says:
*"Seeing the five-petaled flower bloom,*
*step by step ascending to the Immortal Platform."*

**Divine Water** transforms into blood.
Swallowing it to the **Liver**—
the **Liver is Wood**, falsely named **Green Dragon**.
When the Dragon drinks water, it thrives,
healing all eye ailments.
The **Qi** condenses into saliva.

Swallowing to the **Spleen**—
the **Spleen is Earth**; Earth with water
grows **Yellow Sprouts**.
The belly holds the **Large and Small Intestines**,
nine curves leading to the **Navel’s One Inch Three Divisions**—
a round field, one inch wide:
**Left is Blue, Right is White,**
**Front is Red, Back is Black,**
**Center is Yellow**—**Wu-Ji**—
named the **Dan Field**.

Within the Field stands a **Palace**,
named the **Yellow Court**.
The Palace holds a **Fermenting Vat**,
named the **Dan Vat**.
Upon it sits a **Golden Cauldron**,
steadily fed with **True Fire** below,
constantly replenished with **Divine Water** above.
**Water and Fire** are **Kǎn and Lǐ**—
**Sovereign Fire, Minister Fire, Common Fire**—
the **Three Fires** are the **True Flavors**:
**Heart, Nature, Mind**.

Yet men do not grasp these Three—
the **First Flavor** is unclear,
the **Second** unenlightened,
the **Third** fails to reach **Dao**.

If one attains the Three,
they gain **Three Clarities and Six Powers**.

When refining, **wash above with water**,
**fuse below with fire**.
The **Classic** says:
*"Fire issues from below the body,*
*water from above.*
When the upper and lower unite,
**Heaven and Earth merge**—
teach the **Dragon to coil in the Golden Cauldron**,
let the **Tiger circle the Dan Field**—
this is the **Vat’s Blade-Pill**.

Whoever practices this
will forever know **Peace and Longevity**."

**Question:** *"When speaking of the Blade-Pill,*
*what is the **One-Grain Blade-Pill**?
What is the **Self-Ingested Blade-Pill**?
What is the **Iron-Separated Blade-Pill**?"*

**The Secret says:**
The **Three Blade-Pills** are **Treasure**—
**Essence, Qi, Blood**.

**The One-Grain Blade-Pill** is **saliva**.
**The Self-Ingested Blade-Pill** is swallowing saliva to nourish **Qi**.
**The Iron-Separated Blade-Pill** is **True Qi**,
practiced without retreat,
turning all evils to purity.

When practicing, one eats **Golden Rice** when hungry,
drinks **Jade Nectar** when thirsty,
adds **Fire** in cold,
adds **Water** in heat.
**Fire is True Yang, Water is True Yin**—
this is the **Method of Extraction, Addition, and Balance**.

**The Secret says:**
**Extraction** is drawing **True Qi** from above,
**Addition** is warming **Qi** from below into the **Dan Field**.
If the **Kidney Palace** is warmed,
all diseases vanish.

**Question:** *"Why do men and women suddenly fall ill without warning?
How should one respond?"*

**Answer:**

**For all men and women,**
their hearts are attached to desire and pleasure,
greedily clinging to the disputes of sensory realms.
By day, they do not sever nameless afflictions;
at night, in stillness, they cannot dispel the **Three Corpses** and **Yin Ghosts**.
Men deplete their **essence (精)**,
women deplete their **blood and qi (血氣)**.
The **Three Treasures (三寶)** flee, and **Original Yang (元陽)** is lost—
thus, people fall ill without warning.

If one does not heed the words of the **Immortal Daoists (神仙)**,
it is like a broken, leaky house:
the owner neglects repairs,
and the palace collapses,
ruining its beams and pillars—
this is why people fall ill without warning.

**The Secret says:**
*"Why do even young children, though pure and quiet,
not deplete the Three Treasures,
yet still fall ill without warning?"*
It is because their mothers’ **blood and qi (血氣)** were deficient.
They received their mothers’ **ten-month fetal qi (胎氣)** that was insufficient,
or their mothers violated the **Four Seasons’ prohibitions (四集不忌)**—
offenses against **wind, lust, heat, and dampness (風淫暑濕)**—
while pregnant with the child,
and thus the child suffers illness without warning.

**Question:** *"Why are there those with ugly and beautiful appearances?
What does this mean?"*

**Answer:**
Those with **comely features (貌正)** are born when their parents’ **two qi (二氣)**—
**Yin and Yang (父母二氣)**—
respond to the **sun and moon (日月)**.
Before **11 AM (午時)** or after **1 AM (丑時)**,
they gain **proper form (端正)**,
**true and lasting life (真實長命)**,
wealth and fortune (**衣禄**),
and win their parents’ **joyful hearts (喜悦之心)**.
If conceived between **1 AM and 11 AM**,
the child may bear **uncomely features (貌不正)**,
suffering **deafness, dumbness, or muteness (病聾喑哑)**,
a **weak constitution (多性劣)**,
unfavorable regard from others (**不得人意**),
shortened lifespan (**命穷**),
and lack of wealth and fortune (**無衣禄**).
This is the **fundamental principle of creation (造化之根本)**.

**Question:** *"If one encounters a **karmic demon (冤魔)**,
how should one treat it?"*

**Answer:**

When one encounters adversity, one must **cultivate stillness and quietude (清静)**.
Amidst busyness, steal moments of leisure (忙中偷闲);
Within leisure, seek inner tranquility (闲中取静).

When faced with calamity (有难之时),
one must swiftly withdraw and avoid (急须回避).
The **Mind-King (心王)** must employ the **meditative visualization (灌想)** method—
urgently driving the **spirit-intent (神意)** into the **upper nailed seat (上泥丸)**.
Sitting upright in the **Divine Palace (神宫)**,
visualize before you **celestial males and females (仙男仙女)**,
each playing **celestial music (仙乐)**.
**Tap the teeth (叩齿)** and steady the intent (定意),
gazing upon the **scenery of Kunlun Mountain (昆仑山景)** as it ascends—
**oxen, sheep, deer, horses, and jade rabbits (牛羊鹿马玉兔)**.
Direct the intent upward (意想上),
seizing and securing the **foundation of cultivation (系定功时)**.
Suddenly, conceive of a **treasure tree (宝树)** above,
its branches bearing **flowers (花)** that bloom into **fruit (结子)**.
Visualize plucking and consuming it (意摘取吞之).
Those who ingest this substance (此物)
shall attain **eternal bliss and longevity (永得安乐长生)**.
This is the **method of rectification (修正法)**—
a single phrase, fully comprehended (一句了然).
**The Great Lock secures the Four Gates (大牢镇四门)**.

**The Secret Formula (诀曰):**
When the **blood sea (血海)** and **life-gate (命门)** are stilled,
and **qi is settled (气定)**—
no opening or closing of doors (无开闭户),
**essence is stabilized (精定)**—
no distraction by external realms (不思外境),
**spirit is steadied (神定)**.
When **essence and blood disperse (精血散者)**,
they are the **vitality and lifespan (性命也)**.
A **single-minded intent (一意者)**—
this is the **true master (为真主人也)**.
The **teeth are the Mystic Pass (齿是为玄关)**;
closing the **elixir field (丹田者)**—
this is the **lower Mystic Pass (为下玄关)**.
Raising the **golden essence (金精)** to the **upper Mystic Pass (上玄者)**—
this is the **Golden Gate (为金关)**.
**Firmly tapping the teeth (紧叩齿者)**—
this is the **Jade Lock (为玉锁)**.
When the **six senses remain unmoved (六根不动者)**,
they are the **Six Perfections (六度)**,
known as the **Universal Gate (都关)**.
**Inhale and descend the breath (下纳气)**.

「This is the **Tightening of the Yang Lock (勒阳关)**.
The upper cheek is the **Yang Lock’s apex (上腮为顶阳关)**.
The nose is the **Celestial Gate (天门)**.
The flanks are the **Double Locks (双关)**.
When practicing the **alchemical work (行功)**,
all locks open simultaneously.
When the **spirit remains unmoved (神不动)**,
the **intent is not disturbed (意不乱)**.
The **intent (意)**—
this is the **delirious state (恍惚)**.
This is the **Method of Clarity and Stillness (清静之法)**.

In spring, summer, autumn, and winter,
if the **urine of a child remains yellow (小儿小便黄色者)**,
the **elixir field is depleted (丹田虚败)**,
and the **lower dantian’s true qi is lost (失却下元存真炁)**.
Urgent use of the **Ninefold Curving Method (穿九曲法)**—
also called **Nine Turns Piercing the Small Intestine (九转穿小肠)**.
Ninefold penetration of **true qi into the kidney chamber (九透真炁入肾堂)**,
and the **urine naturally becomes clear and white (小便自然清白色)**.
The whole body then attains **serene ease (安乐)**.

**Question:** What is the **Three Vehicles’ Method (三乘之法)**?
**Answer:** The **lower vehicle (下乘)** is like a **newborn infant (新生孩儿)**.
The **middle vehicle (中乘)** is like a **child sitting on the ground (小儿坐地)**.
The **upper vehicle (上乘)** is like a **child walking (小儿行走)**.
If one masters these **three vehicles (通此三乘)**,
one transcends the **Three Realms (三界)**—
the **Realm of Desire (欲界)**, the **Realm of Form (色界)**, and the **Formless Realm (无色界)**.
This is the **heart’s nature and intent (心性意)**,
manifesting the **Three Bodies (三身)**—
the **Body of Dharma (法身)**, the **Body of Reward (报身)**, and the **Body of Transformation (化身)**.
The three each possess **distinct divine traces (显迹之神)**.

The **First Assembly (第一会)**:
**Tàishàng (太上)** refines **Wood of the First and Second Heavenly Stems (甲乙木)**.
This is the **Assembly of the Void and Tranquility (虚坦会)**.
**Lǎojūn (老君)** wears a **green robe (青衣)**,
and **instructs the three thousand green-robed Daoists (度三千青衣道士)**.
He transmits the **Thirty-Six Chapters of the *Lingbǎo* Scripture (灵宝尊经)**—
the **Ninefold Transformation of the Yellow Essence (黄卷)**.
He leaves behind the **Ninefold Piercing Method (九转丹)**—
the **Yellow Sprout Piercing the Knee (黄芽穿膝)**.

The **Second Assembly of the Absolute (绝国第二会)**:
**Shìjiā (释迦)** Buddha leaves behind
the **refinement of the Southern Fire of the Third and Fourth Heavenly Stems (丙丁火)**.
His **body is clad in the fiery monastic robe (烈火袈裟)**,
and the **three thousand red children (赤子)**—
the **monks and nuns (比丘僧人)**—
are instructed.
He leaves behind the **Twelve Chapters of the Great Vehicle Scripture (十二部大乘尊经)**,
the **Method of Striking the Ninefold Iron Drum (射九重铁鼓)**,
and the **Piercing the Knee with Lotus Sprout (芦芽穿膝)**.

The **Third Assembly at Dragon’s Flower (龙华三会)**:
The **Master (夫子)** was in the **school of learning in Lǔ (鲁国之习学堂)**.
He refined the **Western Metal of the Seventh and Eighth Heavenly Stems (庚辛金)**.
The **three thousand white-robed laymen (白衣居士)** were instructed,
and he left behind the **Ten Volumes of the *Analects* (论语)**.
Together with the **Ninefold Piercing of the Clear Pearl (穿九曲明珠)**,
and the **Piercing the Knee with Lotus Sprout (芦芽穿膝)**.

The **Three Teachings (三教)** are like **three legs of a tripod (鼎三足)**.
Their **bodies merge into One (身同归一)**—
neither two nor three.
The **Three Teachings (三教)** do not depart from the **True Dao (真道)**.
**Illustration:** Like **one root bearing three branches (一根树生三枝)**.

**Question:** Of the **Great Dao (大道)**...」

The **Five Grades of Immortals (离几等神仙)**—**Explanation:**

It is heard in *The Transmission of the Dao Collection (传道集)* that there are **five grades of immortals (五等神仙)**.
The first: **Not observing precepts (不持戒)**, **not abstaining from wine and meat (不断酒肉)**, **not refraining from killing (不杀生)**, **not cultivating virtue (不思善)**—these are of the **ghostly immortals (鬼仙之类)**.

The second: Those who **nurture true qi to prolong life (养真气长命)** are **Earthly Immortals (地仙)**.

The third: Those who **love warfare (好战争)** are **Sword Immortals (剑仙)**.

The fourth: Those who **sit in meditation and cultivate (打坐修行)** are **Spiritual Immortals (神仙)**.

The fifth: Those who **revere and care for teachers, elders, and parents (孝养师长父母)**, practice the **Six Perfections (六度)** and **ten thousand good deeds (万行)**, employ **skillful means to save all beings (方便救一切众生)**, **sever the Ten Evils (断除十恶)**, **refrain from killing (不杀生)**, **abstain from wine and meat (不食酒肉)**, **avoid deceit, theft, and licentiousness (邪非偷盗)**, and **align their intentions with the Heavenly Will (出意同天心)**, **upright and without bias (正直无私曲)**—these are called **Celestial Immortals (天仙)**.

At the **very beginning when virtuous intent first arises (当初初发善心处)**, that place is **auspicious (吉祥之地)**. Such are **great cultivators of virtuous practices (善法大修行人)**.

Later, there are **prohibitions (禁忌之文)**. The **secret precepts (诀曰)** state:
Men and women in the **fifth and sixth lunar months should cultivate in purity (五月六月宜清静)**—**greatly forbidden (大忌)**.
In the **eleventh and twelfth lunar months, they should also cultivate in purity (十一月十二月宜清静)**.
Moreover, **the fifth and sixth months are months of great slaughter (大杀之月)**—men should **not approach women (勿近妇人)**, lest they incur **five labors and seven injuries (五劳七伤)**, **diminishing vitality and lifespan (男损性命)** or **women’s essence and vitality (女人损性者)**—this is the **essence, blood, and qi (精血气)**.
If diminished, it causes **left-sided paralysis and right-sided atrophy (左瘫右痪)**, **leukorrhea and bloody discharges (赤白带下)**.
If the **Five Phases’ true qi (五行真气)** is impaired, it is **labor (劳)**.
If the **Seven Treasures (七宝)** are impaired, it is **injury (伤)**.
All diseases have their origins (万病者，各有来处).

**Question:** From whence do diseases arise?
**Answer:** All diseases stem from **eight irregularities of the nodes (八节不正之气)**.

**Question:** What are the **Eight Evils (八邪)**?
**Answer:** The **eight irregularities** arise from **disordered yin-yang within the Eight Trigrams (八卦中阴阳不顺)**—these are the **eight nodal qi (八节中气)** that lead one into **perversity (入邪)**.
They are: **hunger and overindulgence (饥来痛饱)**, **cold and heat (寒极忧心)**, **exhaustion from travel and fatigue (远行困倦)**, as well as **cold and heat in the body (冷热身)**, **drunkenness (身醉)**—these are **not to be practiced (亦不可行功)**.
If practiced, they **transform into grave illness (变成大病也)**.
One should **cultivate in purity and moderation (宜清静行之)**.
When practicing, **do so with restraint (行时)**.

The **tongue** gathers the **Jade Essence Elixir (玉液丹)**.
The **nose** gathers the **Primordial Yang Elixir (元阳丹)**.
Within the **kidney chamber (肾堂)**, the **Golden Elixir (金液丹)** is gathered.
When **vital essence and marrow (精髓)** are full,
And **bones are solidified (骨实)**,
One who has died **a century past (死经百年)**
Yet **tendons and bones remain unsolved (筋骨不解)**,
Is called **the Conjoined Child’s Ring of Solidified Bones (连子环镇骨)**.

**Answer:** The **twenty-four prohibitions against the Great Elixir (二十四忌大丹者)**—
These are the **twenty-four *qi* cycles (二十四炁)** of a year above.
If one **informs my teacher (令告我师)**
And **seeks the wondrous method (愿求妙诀)**,
They must **first still their intentions (须索意自息)**,
And **willingly abandon all wealth and possessions (肯舍重金净财)**.
The **first offering** is **laying down one’s life in alms-giving (第一舍身布施)**.
The **second** is **presenting flowers to the teacher (第二将花献师)**.
The **third** is **offering food to sustain them (第三令膳而供养)**.

**Explanation:** **Laying down one’s life in alms-giving (舍身布施)**—
If one sees their **teacher, elders, or parents in peril (师长父母危时)**,
They must **sacrifice their life to save theirs (舍命求命)**.
**Presenting flowers to the teacher (将花献师)**—
If the **teacher or elders require discipline (师长须打骂)**,
They must **meet them with joy and laughter (须将喜笑迎之)**,
And **keep no trace of anger on their face (面上无嗔怒)**.
**Offering food to sustain them (令膳而供养)**—
When food has **delicious flavors (好味)**,
They must **first present it to the teacher (先奉其师)**.
This is called the **Three Offerings of Alms (三布施)**.

The **Immortal** says:
**Steadfastness (坚者)** is the **Dao/Way (为道)**.
**Joy (欢喜)** is **the connection (为缘)**.
If one **seeks the teacher without diligence (求师不勤)**,
How could they **ever attain the Dao (至于道)**?

**Master Lü (吕翁)** says:
**Without the teacher’s guidance (不因师指)**,
This matter is **hard to know (此事难知)**.
Again, he says:
**One who learns yet does not understand (学而不知者)**
Is **not one who learns yet awakens (不学而悟之)**.
**One who learns yet does not follow the teacher (学而不从师)**
Is called **a thief of learning (名为盗学也)**.
This is **the thief within the Law (是法中贼)**.
If one **conceals their ancestors or teachers (掩祖上师)**,
Their **lifespan will be shortened (得促自己寿)**,
Just as **with ordinary people (与常人同例)**.
**They will only exalt their own gains (自扬己得)**.

The **cutting off of practice and pretense**—
could such a person **ever attain the Dao/Way**?

They claim to **despise the teacher and slight the Law (法)**,
unworthy to be called a teacher.
Before **studying and cultivating (修行)**,
they **first aid others as if aiding themselves**,
relying on **merit and virtue (功德)**.

**Practitioners** each recognize their **ancestral lineage (祖宗科牌)**—
**Taishang (太上)** as **ancestor (祖)**,
**Shakyamuni (释迦)** as **lineage (宗)**,
**Confucius (夫子)** as **lineage branch (科牌)**.

Since the **three teachings (三教)** fell into stillness,
all men and women
**boil in the River of Love (爱河)**,
**drift in the Sea of Suffering (苦海)**,
enduring **torments (烦恼)**,
sinking into the **Six Realms (六道)**—
neither born nor extinguished,
neither departing nor abiding.

The **three teachings’ sacred sovereigns (三教圣主)**,
the **three realms’ sacred mothers (三界圣母)**,
return to **rescue and deliver (救度)** them.

Their **names and titles (名号)** are recorded,
their **manifestations clear (显现分明)**,
their **lifespan seals (寿印信)** verified.

**Explanation (解曰):**
A **fully ordained body (一身为全受戒者)** is the **record (记)**.
A **mind awakened to understanding (心悟了达者)** is the **fire (火)**.

As the **scriptures are sought (随求经云):**
*"The Wish-Fulfilling Seal (如意宝印)"*
reveals its name from the heart—
**ten titles (十号)** are the **Ten Good Deeds (十善)**.
**Ten titles (十号)** mark the **adept (能人)**.

1. **First title (一号元修):** *Original Cultivation*
2. **Second title (二号转分明):** *Clarified Transformation*
3. **Third title (三号通三界):** *Penetration of the Three Realms*
4. **Fourth title (四号长生):** *Eternal Life*
5. **Fifth title (五号光明现):** *Manifest Radiance*
6. **Sixth title (六号意通):** *Mind-Transcendence*
7. **Seventh title (七号全身主):** *Master of the Complete Body*
8. **Eighth title (八号福禄增):** *Augmented Fortune and Longevity*
9. **Ninth title (九号天元修):** *Celestial Primordial Cultivation*
10. **Tenth title (十号者为能人):** *The Adept*

**One title (一加性)** plus the **ten titles (十号)**—
**immeasurable merit (无漏功德)** naturally **accomplished**.

The **three teachings (三教)**—
**adaptively transform (随意演化) all beings**,
yet **never depart from the Dao/Way (不离于道)**.

The ancients said:
**"The affairs of life and essence (性命) are profound.**
**Practitioners endure birth, old age, sickness, and death—suffering.**
**Yet people today do not grasp the true Dao/Way.**
**They cling to emptiness, only to fall into emptiness,**
**and even now cannot awaken.**
**How could they understand the past?"**

It is also heard in the **Dharma of Bodhidharma (达摩经):**
*"The past is not truly spoken of,
the future is not truly real."*

**Taishang (太上)** refines the **Nine-Cycle Elixir (九转还丹)**,
**removing illness and death (去病疾, 了生死)."**

The Master teaches **ren (仁)**, **yi (義)**, **li (禮)**, **zhi (智)**, and **xin (信)**,
lest people invite **karmic retribution (業)** upon themselves.
If one cultivates these,
they may also **alleviate their illnesses**.

**Question:** How does one treat disease?
**Response:** *"The best remedy for the eyes is **eye-bright (除眼大良药)**."*
**Explanation:** *"**Longdan Xiegan (長大歡)** is the remedy."*
**Response:** *"Joy is the root of this medicine.
Constant vexation is the root of all diseases.
Those who remain perpetually serene are the sprouts of the **Great Dao/Way**.*

Yet observing today’s practitioners—
whether monks, Daoists, laymen, or women taking the **Five Precepts (五戒)**—
they still suffer from grave illnesses and impermanence.
Or, among men and women, those with spouses or without,
the **elixir field (丹田)** loses its **Linggui (靈龜)**,
**depleting true qi (耗散真氣)**.
The **lower dantian (下元)** grows cold and hollow,
gradually giving rise to myriad diseases.

Men who maintain **serenity (清静)** for **sixty-four days**
will have **semen-qi (精氣)** full.
Women who maintain **serenity** for **forty-nine days**
will have **blood-qi (血氣)** full.
**When things reach their extreme, they return (物極者則返).**
**Serenity returns to agitation (清為浊返).**
**Stillness returns to motion (静为动返).**
When the **mind and intent (心意)** scatter and dissipate,
the **nine orifices (九窍)** lose their **true qi (真氣)**.
**Turbulent qi (氣浊)** causes women’s **menstrual flow (月水)** to increase,
and men’s **night dreams (夜夢)** to turn toward **yin realms (阴境)**,
**plundering the Seven Treasures and Eight Preciouses (七珍八宝).**
Thus, people fall ill.

**Question:**

**How does one treat *yin-ghost* afflictions?**

**Answer:** Use the **Dao of the Knife and the Ruler (刀圭之法)**.

**Question:** What is meant by *Knife and Ruler*?

**Secret Key:** The *Knife and Ruler* is **One**—
it has **water** and **qi**.
It can give birth to all things.
**Qi** is the **Ruler**—
it becomes **clouds**.
**Water** becomes **rain**.

Again it is said:
**Outgoing qi** is the **Knife**,
**Incoming qi** is the **Ruler**.
When **functioning** is verified in all things,
this is the **Knife and Ruler**—
it is the **returning of aging to youth**.

The **Classical Text** says:
*"Fire issues from below the body,
Water issues from above.
Water and fire are the medicines."*

**Secret Key:**
*"Reed-sprouts pierce the knee"*—
**Upper and Lower River Chariots (上下河车)**.
The **furnace’s tripod** is the **purple river chariot (紫河车)**.
The **Upper Chariot** refines **jing** to nourish the brain.
When **fire advances**, water grows warm;
when **water advances**, fire grows cool.
**Dual movement of water and fire**—
this is the **gentle tempering of the lead cauldron (温温铅鼎)**.
When **qi enters the cauldron**, **restoration** arises, ascending with the chariot’s fire.
It **scatters into the hundred meridians**,
moistening the skin,
giving luster to the body.
This is the **method of cultivation**.

**Difficulty:** Why do the fat first grow old?

**Secret Key:** The fat cultivate **externally** but not **internally**.
Their bones lack **marrow**,
their **lower dantian** loses **true qi**—
thus they grow weak and ill.

**Cultivators of the Inner Dao** are the **seeds of ease and longevity**.

**Secret Key:**
*"Train the dragon to coil in the golden tripod,
Let the tiger encircle the dantian.
The **Zhen hexagram** summons thunder,
The **Xun hexagram** summons wind.
When functioning, **gargle the saliva** in one great mouth,
swallow it in three portions.
Press down as **qi descends** three times.
Naturally, there will be the sounds of **dragon roars and tiger howls**,
also able to dispel all diseases of the abdomen.
Listen with the ears—
like thunder striking a painted drum."*

**The Way of Ascension and Descension**

**Secret Key:**
The **ascending** is for elevation,
the **descending** for descent.

**Hymn:**
The **True Void’s** subtle principle—none know it.
Sitting at the **Qū River’s** bend, I watch crows fly.
Earth-shaking thunder roars, startling ghosts and demons—
This is the moment of **Yin-Yang’s** creative transformation.

**Timing:** Before noon for the **Child**, after for the **Maiden**.

Boil with **Water** and **Fire**—**Dragon** and **Tiger** follow.
**Jīn Gōng** drinks wine, **Huáng Pó** grows drunk.
Seize the **King**—who is he?
**Answer:** **Jīn Gōng** is the **Divine**,
**Huáng Pó** is the **Qi**.
The **Yang Qi** is the **Infant**,
the **Yin Qi** is the **Maiden**.

The **Azure Dragon**—this is the **liver’s qi**.
The **White Tiger**—this is the **lung’s qi**.
**Kàn-Lí**—this is **essence-blood**.

**Secret Key:**
When practicing, sit like **Tài Mountain**,
stand like a **jewel tower**.
Lock the **Four Gates**,
knock fiercely at the **Mystic Pass**.
Gargle the **saliva** once—
swallow it **three times** with ferocity.
Cross the **Kàn-Lí barrier**,
**three times**—naturally, the **Dragon-Tiger qi** follows.

As you **move, stand, sit, or lie**,
close your mouth, shut your eyes.
Do not listen with the ears,
but gaze inward.
Each day, focus on the **lower dantian**—
concentrate and visualize.
As you exhale, let the **qi descend**,
as you inhale, let the **qi ascend**.
Do not cross the **Kàn-Lí barrier**,
nor let it rush to the face.
The **Six Qi** meet at the **central pivot**—
**Clear Qi** circulates to the right,
**Turbulent Qi** to the left.
Each turns **nine times**—
the **qi** cannot escape upward or downward.
Left and right merge into the **furnace**—
this is the **Dragon coiling, Tiger encircling**.
The **qi** harmonizes naturally.

Again, the **Infant and Maiden**—this is the **union of husband and wife**.
The **qi** gathers above the **spleen**, establishing the **furnace**—
this is the **Huáng Pó’s pairing**.
Also called the **Heaven-Earth’s harmonious union**,
the **Kàn-Lí’s copulation**—this is **body union without sexual union**.
**Sexual union** is not practiced—
this is the **method of absolute stillness**,
the **thousand-fold unshaken, unmoving method**.

Now, people mostly cultivate **external Dao**,
not the **Inner Path**.
They see the **past methods of the Way**.
The practitioner has:
An **outer path**—the **Great Dao’s teachings**,
An **inner path**—unknown to all.

In the midst of the crowd, walk three *lǐ*.
You see three great ravines—
bottomless.
How to cross?
**Secret Key:**

The three great ravines are the **Three Teachings**—
the **Three Vehicles**—
they give rise to the **Three Corpses**,
establish the **Three Treasures**,
transcend the **Three Realms**.
Advancing yet another three *lǐ*,
one sees six deep chasms—
progress is impossible.
Which gate is this?
**Secret Key:**
It is the **Six Perfections** and the **Ten Thousand Practices**,
the **Six Senses’ purity**,
the **Six Thieves’ beheading**,
the **Six Desires’ restraint**,
the **Six Ladders’ planting**.

Advancing yet another three *lǐ*,
one sees the **Three Barriers**—
the **Barrier of Precious Purity**,
where the **Seven Forests’ Corpses** abound—
this is the **Critical Moment of Transformation**.
Walking three *lǐ* more,
one again sees a garden—
the **Garden of Discarded Fruits**.
An old man gazes fixedly at the garden gate.
Those with **affinity** may pass with empty hands.

Advancing through the garden yet another three *lǐ*,
one sees a great tree upon which
a **golden ox** is tethered.
By the riverbank stands a **platform**—
the **Yellow Gold Platform** for men,
the **Fénhuáng Platform** for women,
the **Immortal’s Fishing Platform**,
the **Platform of Eternal Bliss and Flowers**.
If one is **impermanent**,
the **Platform of Homesickness**.
At the river’s mouth are three women—
the **ferrywoman is a demon**.
The boat is full of people.
Crossing this river is **encountering the demon**.

Walking three *lǐ* further,
one sees a great mountain—
the **Mustard Seed Mountain** (*Sūmí Shān*).
On its eastern slope stands a **green sheep**—
this is **Laozi’s qi** (*Lǎo Jūn zhī qì*).
On its western slope, a **white sheep**—
this is **the Master’s qi** (*Fūzǐ zhī qì*).
Facing south, a **yellow sheep**—
this is **the Great Awakened Golden Immortal’s qi** (*Dàjué Jīnxiān zhī qì*).
The three sheep
guide and escort the multitude into the mountain—
the **Three Yang Converging Cauldron Mountain** (*Sānyáng Jùdǐng Shān*).

Within the mountain, a city stands—
the **Northern City** (*Běichéng*).
It has four gates.
Above each gate hangs a plaque,
and upon the plaque are characters:
The **Gate of Radiant Light** (*Kāiguāng Mén*) to the east,
the **Gate of Longevity** (*Chángshēng Mén*) to the west,
the **Gate of Golden Light** (*Jīnguāng Mén*) to the south,
the **Great Collapse Gate** (*Dà Lún Mén*) to the north.
This represents the **five sense-organs**—
eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and mind.
Entering the four gates,
one sees four **caves of the Dao** (*dòngfǔ*).
The **Cave of Celestial Music** (*Tiānlè Dòng*),
the **Cave of White Clouds** (*Báiyún Dòng*),
the **Cave of the Bamboo Realm** (*Zhúguó Dòng*),
and the **Cave of Longevity** (*Chángshēng Dòng*).
Entering the four caves,
one sees four **temples**—
the **Pure Temple** (*Wújié Sì*),
the **Mystic Void Temple** (*Xuánkōng Sì*),
the **Bamboo Grove Temple** (*Zhúlín Sì*),
and the **□□ Temple** (*[missing term] Sì*).
Within them dwell four **fruit-realization** (*ānuò*) **arhat** (*luóhàn*)—
**Anāthapindika** (*Ānàshè*),
**Sudatta** (*Sītuōshè*),
**Sundari** (*Xūduōhàn*),
and **Arahant** (*Āluóhàn*)—
as the four temple masters.
These are the **four fruit-realized immortals** (*Sìguǒ Xiānrén*).

Advancing further, one sees five **visions** (*guàn*).
The **Vision of Merit and Fame** (*Gōngmíng Guàn*),
the **Vision of Medicine and Herbs** (*Yīyào Guàn*),
the **Vision of Peaceful Vitality** (*Ānyáng Guàn*),
the **Vision of True Suchness** (*Zhēnrú Guàn*),
and the **Vision of Tuṣita** (*Dōushuài Guàn*).
Within the five visions,
five **palaces** appear—
the **Palace of the Twin Women** (*Shuāngnǚ Gōng*) is the **eyes**,
the **Palace of the Great Dragon** (*Dàlóng Gōng*) is the **mouth**,
the **Upper White Palace** (*Shàngbái Gōng*) is the **nose**,
the **Crystal Palace** (*Shuǐjīng Gōng*) is the **ears**,
and the **Heavenly Scales Palace** (*Tiānchèng Gōng*) is the **mind/heart** (*xīn*).
Inside sits the **Great Tower** (*Dàlóubié*).
Twelve breaths above and below—
this is the **Twelvefold Tower** (*Shíèr Chónglóu*).
Its **Central Palace Tower** (*Zhōnggōnglóu*),
the **Moon Palace Tower** (*Yuègōnglóu*),
the **Heavenly Immortal Tower** (*Tiānxiānlóu*),
the **Treasury Tower** (*Qǔbǎolóu*),
the **Holy Well Tower** (*Shèngjǐnglóu*),
the **Dao-Qi Tower** (*Fǎqìlóu*),
the **Wondrous Sound Tower** (*Miàoyīnlóu*),
the **Path-Recognition Tower** (*Shìdàolóu*),
the **Zenith Tower** (*Chándǐnglóu*),
the **Mirrored Yang Tower** (*Jǐngyánglóu*),
the **Bell and Drum Tower** (*Zhōnggǔlóu*),
and the **Tower of the Two Saints** (*Èrshènglóu*)
—each year on the **twelfth day of the twelfth month**, at **twelve o’clock**,
the human body contains these twelve towers.
The **twelve towers** correspond to
the **twelve meridians** (*shíèr jīng*) and
the **twelve celestial stems** (*shíèr zhī*).
Further, the **four cardinal directions** reveal nine **palaces**—
these are the **nine orifices** (*jiǎo*) of man.
The **nine palace-orifices** (*jiǎogōng*) are:
The **Palace of Wind and Thunder** (*Fēngléi Gōng*) to the east,
the **Palace of Twin Forests** (*Shuānglín Gōng*),
the **Palace of Purple Micro** (*Zǐwēi Gōng*) to the south,
the **Muni Palace** (*Móuní Gōng*),
the **Palace of the Holy Mother** (*Shèngmǔ Gōng*) to the west,
the **Palace of Huìluó** (*Huìluó Gōng*),
the **Palace of the Northern Dharma** (*Fán Gōng*) to the north,
the **Crystal Palace** (*Shuǐjīng Gōng*),
and the **Central Palace of Peace** (*Ān Gōng*) at the center.
This is called the **Nine Palaces** (*Jiǔgōng*),
just as the earth is divided into **nine regions** (*jiǔ zhōu*).
Further, the **Microcosmic Palaces** (*Wéifǔ Yuán*) are counted—
a total of **ten states** (*zhōu*).
These are also **ten realms** (*guó*).
The **Realm of the Fire Ancestor** (*Jiāozǔ Guó*),
the **Realm of Muni** (*Móuní Guó*),
the **Realm of Blooming** (*Kāihuā Guó*),
the **Realm of Deer Crag** (*Lùyán Guó*),
the **Golden Realm** (*Jīnsè Guó*),
the **Lapis Lazuli Realm** (*Liúlí Guó*),
the **Realm of Śrāvastī** (*Shèwèi Guó*),
the **Realm of Southern Zen** (*Nánchán Guó*),
the **Realm of Heavenly India** (*Tiānzhú Guó*),
and the **Realm of Double Yang** (*Chóngyáng Guó*).
The **ten realms** are the **ten stages** (*dì*) of **dharma-realization** (*shìdì*).
Within each stage, a **Tài Mountain** (*Shān*).
The body contains four **great oceans** (*hǎi*):
**saliva** (*jīn*) is the **Eastern Ocean** (*Dōnghǎi*),
**blood** (*xuè*) is the **Southern Ocean** (*Nánhǎi*),
**marrow** (*suǐ*) is the **Western Ocean** (*Xīhǎi*),
and **qi** (*qì*) is the **Northern Ocean** (*Běihǎi*).
There are also nine **islands** (*zhōu*)—
the **small intestine** (*xiǎocháng*) is the **island**.
Further, there are five **lakes** (*hú*).
The **body** is the **Dòngtíng Lake** (*Hú*),
**essence** (*jīng*) is the **Jade Lake** (*Yùhú*),
**sweet dew** (*gānlù*) is the **clarified butter lake** (*tíhú*),
**mind** (*xīn*) is the **Mystic Lake** (*Xuánhú*),
and the **small intestine** is the **Yangzi Lake** (*Jiānghú*).
The **three luminaries** (*rìyuèxīngzhēn*) are **consumed** (*xiāo*).
This is the **waning** of **blood, qi, and essence** (*xuèqìjīng*).
The **three consumptions** are likened to
**mountain collapse** (*shānbēng*),
**ocean exhaustion** (*hǎijié*),
and **earth fissure** (*dìliè*).

The **twelve hours** of a day within the **Ten Stages** (*shízhōu*)—
when one attains **Sitting Meditation** (*zuòmòyuè*), that person’s **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **fruit** (*guǒ*) are complete.
Men refine their **form** (*xíng*) as **virgin boys** (*tóngnán*),
and women refine their **form** as **virgin girls** (*tóngnǚ*).
The **sutra** (*jīng*) says:
**"Form and spirit** (*xíngshén*) are both wondrous**,
united with the **Dao/Way** (*dào*) in truth." (*hézhēn*)
This is the **method of extracting the embryo and replacing the bones** (*chōutiāohuàngǔ*).
The **true secret of inverted yin-yang** (*yīnyángdiāndǎo*) and the **Five Phases** (*wǔxíng*)—
the **Five Phases** contain **gold, wood, water, fire, and earth** (*jīn-mù-shuǐ-huǒ-tǔ*).
In **spring**, **wood** (*mù*) flourishes externally, but internally it does not—
people often suffer from **eye ailments** (*yǎnjì*).
In **summer**, **fire** (*huǒ*) flourishes externally, but internally it does not—
people often suffer from **diarrhea and dysentery** (*xièlì*).
In **autumn**, **gold** (*jīn*) flourishes externally, but internally it does not—
people often suffer from **coughing and wheezing** (*késòu*).
In **winter**, **water** (*shuǐ*) flourishes externally, but internally it does not—
people often suffer from **hernia** (*shuānqì*).
The **spleen** (*pí*) is **earth** (*tǔ*).
Its **qi** is divided among the four seasons.
When **yin and yang** are inverted, **reversal** (*fǎnfù*) occurs.
The **Five Phases** each have their **mutual restraining** (*xiāngkè*):
**Gold** restrains **wood** (*jīn-kè-mù*),
**wood** restrains **earth** (*mù-kè-tǔ*),
**earth** restrains **water** (*tǔ-kè-shuǐ*),
**water** restrains **fire** (*shuǐ-kè-huǒ*),
and **fire** restrains **gold** (*huǒ-kè-jīn*).
**Water** and **fire** are **yin** and **yang** (*yīnyáng*).
One **yin** and one **yang**—
this is the **true Dao/Way** (*zhēndào*).
This is **essence** and **blood** (*jīngxuè*).
Humans have **ten thousand diseases** (*wànbìng*).
None concern the **five viscera** (*wǔzàng*).
All stem from **depleting their parents’ essence and blood** (*shǔnliǎo fùmǔ jīngxuè*).
If the **elixir field** (*dāntián*) weakens,
then **sickness** (*bìngjì*) arises.
Swiftly **retrieve the spirit** (*shén*) and **stabilize nature** (*dìngxìng*).

The **Nine Immortals Scripture** (*Jiǔxiān Jīng*) states:
**"The Dao/Way** is **one** (*yī*).
When humans attain **one** (*yīzhě*),
all matters will succeed." (*wànshì bìchéng*)
When practicing **virtue/power** (*gōng*),
the **spirit** (*shén*) and **qi** transform.
**Qi** follows the **will** (*yì*).
At the moment of **circulation** (*yùnshí*),
**pushing forward and surging ahead** (*qián-gǎn-qián-chōng*) is **yin**.
**Leftward summoning** (*zuǒ-jiāng*), the **spirit** (*shén*) of **yin** enters the **Six Palaces** (*liùjiǎ*).
It **drives and revolves** through the **Six Sense Realms** (*liùxiàng*) and **Eight Consciousnesses** (*bāshí*).
**Rectifying the One** (*kuāngyīzhēnlíng*)—
internally it **wanders** (*yóu*) through the **Nine Palaces** (*jiǔgōng*).
It **observes** (*kàn*) and **plays** (*wán*) with the **Ten Countries** (*shíguó*).
**Longevity descends** (*jiàngtái*).
It makes **infants** (*yīng’ér*) and **maiden girls** (*zhǎnnǚ*)—
the **elixir field** (*dāntián*) is **firmly established** (*ānzhuó*).
**Fire** is **kindled** (*jìn*), and **medicine** is **burned** (*shāoyào*).
The **will** (*yì*) imagines the **furnace’s red heat** (*lúhóng*).
The **elixir** (*dānyào*) is then **formed**.
The **will** (*yì*) imagines:
**Green Dragon** (*Qīnglóng*) on the left,
**White Tiger** (*Báiǎng*) on the right,
**Vermilion Bird** (*Zhūquè*) in front,
and **Dark Tortoise** (*Xuánwù*) behind.
The **four great deities** (*sìzuòdàshén*), each **hand** (*zhě*) holding a **long spear** (*chángqiāng*) and **broad sword** (*kuòjiàn*),
**fix their gaze** (*kàndìng*) on the **medicine cauldron** (*yàolú*).
They **self-administer** (*zìfú*) the **wondrous medicine** (*miàoyào*).
If a person **repeatedly practices** (*lěixíng*) this **virtue/power** (*gōng*),
they will **forever attain longevity** (*yǒngdé chángshēng*).
It causes **evil qi** (*xiéqì*) to **dissipate** (*sàn*) on its own,
and **true qi** (*zhēnqì*) to **arise** (*shēng*) naturally.
Their **mouth** (*kǒu*) is like **drinking from the Jade Spring of Mount Jing** (*Yùquán*),
so their **mouth** (*kǒu*) is naturally **fragrant and sweet** (*xiāngtián*).

The **second lower orifice** (*èrxiàkuàng*) **connects** (*tōngdá*) to the **kidney chamber** (*shèntáng*).
**Follow the exhalation** (*hūqì*) to **take it** (*qǔzhī*).
The **precious qi** (*bǎoqì*) enters the **mouth**.

「Cough thirty-six times.
This is the **Snow Flower** (*Xuěhuā*).
Swallow it down into the **Elixir Field** (*Dāntián*).
This is the **Snow** (*Xuě*).

Then **upper and lower unite** (*shànghé xiàbì*), **exhalation and inhalation** (*hūqì bìqì*) follow suit.
**Heaven and Earth** (*Qiánkūn*) **harmonize** (*xiānghé*).
**True qi** (*Zhēnqì*) fills abundantly.
Those whose **spleen is warm** (*pí nuǎn zhě*)—
**all diseases vanish** (*wànbìng xiāochú*).
Like **firing bricks in a furnace** (*shí zào zhōng shāo wǎ*), it naturally completes itself in due time.
Like a **hen brooding an egg** (*rú jī bào luǎn*)
or a **woman bearing a child** (*fùrén huáitāi*),
it does not depend on timing.
Only when one **feels bodily pain** (*shēnzhōng tóngtòng zhě*)—
this is the **Iron Black Ox** (*tiě hēi niú*) **pushing the cart** (*bānchē yě*).
This is **True Unity of Qi** (*Shì Zhēn Yī Qì*).
This is **True Unity of Nature** (*Zhēn Yī Xìng*).
The **black** (*hēi*)—
this is the **lower qi** (*xiàqì yě*).
**Painful qi** (*tòngqì*) departs through **abundant defecation** (*dàbiàn chū*).
**Swollen qi** (*zhǒngqì*) departs through **urination** (*xiǎobiàn chū*).

There are also **methods of descending the Celestial Pass and Earthly Pivot** (*Jiàng Tiān Guān Dì Zhóu Fǎ*).
Gazing at the **Solar Pivot at the Crown** (*Dǐngyáng Guān*)
and the **Cinnabar Field** (*Níwán Gōng*),
draw **true qi** (*Zhēnqì*) long through the **nose** (*bízhōng cháng yǐn*)
and into the **mouth** (*rùkǒu*).
With a **great exhalation** (*dàhē*), perform it six times.
**Celestial Pass and Earthly Pivot** (*Tiān Guān Dì Zhóu*)
are like **stillness in death** (*sǐ bùdòng*).
Those who **practice this daily** (*měirì xínggōng zhě*)—
**long adjust** (*cháng tiáohé*) **Heaven and Earth** (*yīnyáng*).
At the **Winter Solstice** (*Dōngzhì*), one **yang** (*yīng*) **arises** (*shēng*).
At the **Summer Solstice** (*Xiàzhì*), one **yin** (*yīn*) **arises** (*shēng*).
The **Winter Solstice** (*Dōngzhì*)—
this is the time **after midnight** (*zǐshí yǐhòu*).
Gazing at the **eastern sunrise** (*dòngfāng rìchū*) is **yang** (*wéi yáng*).
The **Summer Solstice** (*Xiàzhì*)—
this is the time **after noon** (*wǔshí yǐhòu*).
The **sunset** (*rìmò*) is **yin** (*shì yīn yě*).
This is the **principle of yin and yang reciprocation** (*yīnyáng fǎnfù zhī lǐ yě*).
**Earthly qi** (*Dìqì*) ascends in **vapor** (*shàng téng*).
**Heavenly rain** (*Tiān yǔ*) descends in **showers** (*xià jiàng*).
Three days bring **one wind** (*sān rì yī fēng*).
Ten mornings bring **two rains** (*shí cháo èr yǔ*).
When **wind and rain follow their season** (*fēng yǔ shùnshí*),
the **people are joyful** (*rénmín biàn kuàilè*).
This is **joy within one’s own body** (*biàn shì yī shēn kuàilè*).
**No disease, long-lasting vitality** (*wúbìng chángjiǔ yě*).

For those with **ten thousand diseases** (*rén yǒu wànbìng zhě*),
each disease—
**each is treated by its own true method** (*gè yī bān Zhēn Gōng zhì bìng*).
It **responds naturally** (*zì yìng yě*).

The **first great refining method of the Nine-Turn Elixir** (*Dà Liàn Jiǔ Zhuǎn Huàn Dān zhī Fǎ*)
includes:
The **Yellow Sprout Piercing the Knee** (*Huáng Yá Chuān Xī*) method,
the **Shooting the Nine-Layered Iron Drum** (*Shè Jiǔ Chóng Tiě Gǔ*) method,
the **Prince’s Four-Gate Tour** (*Tài Zǐ Yóu Sì Mén*) method,
the **Golden Rod Pointing at the Wheel** (*Jīn Biān Zhǐ Lún*) method,
the **Reed Sprout Piercing the Knee** (*Lú Yá Chuān Xī*) method,
the **Yellow Emperor Straddling Fire** (*Xuān Yuán Kuà Huǒ*) method,
the **Jade Maiden Touching the Body** (*Yù Nǚ Mō Shēn*) method,
the **Zhongli’s Back-Sheath Sword** (*Zhōnglí Bèi Jiàn*) method,
the **Old Master Lu’s Fishing** (*Lǚ Wēng Diào Yú*) method,
and the **Chen Xiyi’s Great Sleep** (*Chén Xīyí Dà Shuì*) method.
All these **methods of the Three Teachings** (*Sān Jiào Nèi Xíng Fǎmén zhě*)
**cure diseases** (*jìn gè zhì yú jíbìng yě*).
Further, there are those who can **transcend birth and death** (*néng chāo shēng*).

When one **practices this transformation** (*rén xíng zhuǎn cǐ gōng*),
**nurturing true qi** (*Dāntián yǎng rè Zhēnqì*) in the **Elixir Field** (*Dāntián*),
during the **night**, they **often dream** (*yèjiān duō mèng*)
of **mountains where oxen are released** (*shānshàng fàng niú*).
The **oxen** (*qí niú zhě*)—
these are the **crimson ox** (*chì niú*) or
the **green ox** (*qīng niú*) or
**immortals and Daoists** (*huò xiānrén dàoshì*).
**Palaces, halls, temples, or Daoist abodes** (*gōng guān sìyuàn*).
**Fine carriages and good trees** (*gāochē hǎoshù*).
In the **night**, they see **children and maidens** (*xiǎo ér nǚ*)
or **great officials** (*bìng dà guānrén zhě*).
These are signs that the **Elixir Field’s qi is robust** (*biàn shì Dāntián qì zhuàng*).

If they dream of **wild thorns and desolate paths** (*xiǎo dào huāngjí*)
or **villains seizing broken houses** (*èrén qiān pò fángwū*)
or **collapsed pagodas, toppled tombs, and rivers in transit** (*tǎ mù shù dǎo hé dù*),
this is a sign that the **Elixir Field’s qi is weak** (*biàn shì Dāntián qì shuāiruò*).
It should be **supplemented** (*yīng bǔ zhī*).
**The formula states** (*Juéyuē*)...」

「Do not speak of the **Six-Eared Dao** (*liù ěr Dāo*) to these three kinds of people.
Fear that you will **betray the secrets of the immortals** (*shòu shénxiān zhī jī*).
The formula states:
These three kinds of people are:
First, the **ungrateful** (*bù xiào zhī rén*).
Second, the **disrespectful and unfaithful** (*bù jìngxìn zhī rén*).
Third, those who **do not uphold the precepts and are unworthy** (*bù chuán jiè bù shàn zhī rén*).
Do not impart this formula to them.

To all others—**regardless of gender** (*bù fēn nánzǐ nǚrén*), whether **monks, Daoists, or officials** (*sēngdào guānrén*)—
this formula is the **foundational precept** (*zuǒduì*) of all **sutras** (*jīng*).
Those who **find peace** (*ān lè zhě*) through it
are practicing the **Small Vehicle’s Dao** (*xiǎo shèng zhī fǎ*).
Though it is the Small Vehicle,
it is **the very root of great attainment** (*què shì dà chéng gēnběn*).
The **Causality Sutras** (*yīn guǒ jīng*) all affirm this:
In cultivation, there are **eight kinds of Auspicious Fields** (*xiūxíng yǒu bā bān fútián*).
**Healing suffering and tending the sick** (*jiùkǔ kànbìng*)—
this is the **first Auspicious Field** (*fútián zhě shì dì yī*).
**Preserving life is its supreme power** (*jiùshēng xìng qiáng*).
As with the **southern temples burning incense** (*rú nán sì shāoxiāng*)
and the **northern Daoist halls offering provisions** (*běi yuàn sòng gòng*)
to save a person’s life,
or as with **erecting a seven-tiered Treasure Pagoda** (*rú zào qī jí bǎotǎ*).
If **men or women** (*ruò nánzǐ nǚrén*)
**receive this formula** (*shōudé cǐ juéyuè*),
do not **transmit it recklessly** (*wùkě luànchuán*).
Should anyone **transmit it recklessly** (*rú yǒu luànchuán zhě*),
they will **lightly reveal the immortals’ profound secrets** (*qīng xiè xiānrén miàojī*).
The **Nine Ancestors** (*jiǔ zǔ*) will **all fall into ruin** (*jìn duò yú chénlún*).
They will be **forever bound to the Underworld** (*yǒng zhèn qīngdū*).
They will **never attain human rebirth** (*bùdé rénshēn*).
Be cautious, be warned.
**Believe, accept, and practice it faithfully.** (*xìn shòu fèngxíng*)」
