**The Comprehension of the Mysterious (Wuxuan Pian)**
*By Yu Dongzhen of the Yuan Dynasty*

**Oral Instructions on Seated Practice**

Those who study the Dao may practice at any time, provided the body and mind are at leisure. Seek a quiet place, close the eyes and mouth, sit upright, and forget the ears. Whether cross-legged or not, both are permissible.

When seated, forget the external form and do not cling to worldly burdens; forget the internal mind and do not attach to affairs. Abide within it as if present yet not present, as if guarding yet not guarding—thus resting in emptiness. With long and pure familiarity, thoughts naturally settle. When thoughts settle, yang arises, and when yang qi arises, there is ascent and descent.

The ascending qi rises from the tailbone at the waist, ascending straight through the spine and halting at the jiaji point. Borrowing the xun wind, it is propelled upward to the crown. The two qi converge and descend to the tip of the tongue, sweet as honey. Gently swallow and guide it, allowing it to enter the Central Palace.

The *Elixir Scripture* states: *"The breath depends on the xun wind."* It also says: *"At first, effort is required; later, it seems as if nothing is done."* In sum, if the ascent and descent, the firing times, the daily work, the wondrous functions of the Three Passes, and the mysteries of bathing are unclear, one may idle away years and achieve nothing in old age.

An ancient song says:
*"The immortals refuse to speak plainly,
Dooming countless in Jambudvīpa!
Why? Though these principles are known,
Earthbound immortals swarm like hemp."*

The celestial mechanisms and secret instructions dare not be revealed in writing; thus, they are transmitted orally and imprinted upon the heart.

**Fire Scorching and Water Overflowing**

When fire scorches, ascent does not cease; when water overflows, descent does not end. If regulated by method and measure, fire does not blaze excessively, nor does water flood uncontrollably—naturally, all settles.

When used, it exists; when unused, it vanishes. This profound principle lies in the oral instructions. Without knowing this wondrous function, how can one refine essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness?

Today, those who study the Dao are many across the world, yet those who receive the true transmission are few—scarcely one or two. How could such a principle be lightly imparted to others!

**Bathing**

Ten months of gestation, two months of bathing—together, they complete a full year of three hundred and sixty days. Yet even the two months of bathing—where do they reside? These two months do not involve firing times; they may be placed before, after, or within. Their practical application is not non-existent.

Those who study the Dao must inquire and learn, not rigidly adhering to the second and eighth months—this is incorrect. The moment of shedding the fetal body is transmitted only through oral instruction and heart-to-heart transmission.

**The Mysterious Pass**

The Mysterious Pass is the pivotal gateway of the entire body. This aperture is the heart within the heart. It is not the fleshy heart but the master within the heart, the spirit governing all affairs of the body. This spirit is formless and imageless, neither existent nor non-existent. When one is free of selfishness, this is the Mysterious Pass. The slightest selfish desire renders it absent.

Master Cheng said: *"Not leaning to either side is called the center; the slightest bias is not the center."*

Stone Immortal of Apricot Grove said: *"Within the body lies the mysterious mechanism; within the heart, no dust or defilement."* These words exhaust the meaning.

The Mysterious Pass is the origin of all affairs. In movement, it interacts with things; in stillness, it is nurtured within. Neither existent nor non-existent, neither form nor emptiness, it congeals in profound tranquility, and qi flows unimpeded. The White Tiger ascends on the left, the Green Dragon emerges on the right. Balanced at the central spine, the xun wind stirs. The furnace bellows fan open, penetrating the Kunlun peak. Heaven and Earth unite, transforming into a single pool. Descending to the tip of the tongue, it is swallowed into the Yellow Court. Within a day, this practice is repeated three or four times.

For the Initial Pass, one hundred days; bathing for one month. For the Middle Pass, one hundred days; bathing as before. For the Upper Pass, one hundred days; the firing times are exhausted. The fetal body is shed, the spirit transforms, embracing the One to nurture the youth. After nine years of practice, one ascends in broad daylight.

The Great Dao is wordless, not to be questioned.
Forget form, forget image, seek lead and mercury.
Guard the central One without the slightest attachment;
Focus the body and mind, hold them steadfast.

With each breath, the spirit clears,
The six pulses naturally align with life and destiny.
Essence, spirit, soul, and魄 each return to their origin;
At this point, body and mind are still and unmoving.

When the first yang arises and the second yang shifts,
Await the gentle firing of the present moment.
In an instant, it ascends straight to the Silver River,
The jade pillow and mud pill glowing like fire.

Heaven and Earth unite, descending to the Hall of Light;
A circular radiance hangs like a precious mirror atop the crown.
Gently descending to the tip of the tongue,
The mouth fills with fragrant, sweet nectar.

Slowly swallow it into the Yellow Court,
Golden light envelops the entire body.
The Three Families meet, forming the infant;
One trigram is three, two trigrams are fixed.

Morning and evening, grasp and circulate by the Celestial Stem.
Four and three all bow to the handle of the Jade Pivot.
In a year, the Niwan Palace at the crown is broken through—
Thus one transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood.
After nine years of embracing the One, the practice is complete;
Alone, one soars on the phoenix back to the Great Grotto.

I now reveal the sages’ mechanism,
Washing my ears and closing my eyes to preserve constancy.
Do not wait for lead to scatter and mercury to fly,
Lest you later accept death willingly.

The profound mechanism is dissected in heart-to-heart transmission;
Let all who study the Dao advance early in their practice.

It is also said: *"The Mysterious Pass aperture exists within, yet it is formless, imageless, and boundless. If one points to its location, it is as distant as thousands of mountains and myriad leagues. If one points to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys, missing the mark, it is like deftly carving a cavity in emptiness—though the words may strike true, fixing upon one place misses the center."*

**Medicinal Substances**

To gather the medicine is to extract true qi from the blood and true essence from the qi. When blood and qi ascend to the crown and unite, they transform into liquid.

The true essence and true qi, when qi ascends to the crown and unites, transform into gold. The liquid flows through the meridians and becomes white blood. This gold enters the Central Palace, coalescing into the elixir. When the work reaches its day, the blood and qi of the entire body transmute into white blood, and the true essence and true qi fully congeal to form it. Once the elixir’s body is complete, whether the spirit exits or enters, it is no longer burdened by the illusory frame. The next step above transcends beyond yin and yang, yet the oral instructions remain—this is the body beyond the body, though it is not yet the most wondrous.

It is also said:
*"Within essence lies qi and blood, within blood lies essence,
Essence and qi originally unite to form the Great Ultimate.
Do not speak of respiration as union,
For how can this thing know life and death?"*

**Fire Times**
When advancing the fire, a single celestial cycle completes in an instant. Over ten months and three hundred days, there are three thousand six hundred hours and thirty thousand moments. One may apply the fire times at every moment, at every hour, or every day; one may disregard moments within an hour or hours within a day, using them as needed. But without knowing the method, haphazard ascent and descent will prevent one from ascending. The oral instructions remain here.

**Central Palace**

The Earth gives birth to the myriad things, the heart governs the myriad affairs. The heart is Earth, Earth is the heart—thus it is called the central *wu-ji* Earth. The central is the Mysterious Pass, the single aperture.

To comprehend Earth is to still the myriad things; to comprehend the heart is to quiet the myriad affairs. Yet those who study the Dao today wander aimlessly, seeking only outside, never turning inward to the center to pursue the Way.

**Embracing the One**
Swallow the embryo whole into the belly, dwelling among men. Nine years of accumulated practice fulfill eight hundred merits, and one attains immortality. Through the Qian and Kun, one roams the famous mountains and grotto-heavens. When the eight hundred merits are complete, one receives the golden writ and jade decree, taking one’s place in the ranks.

**Exiting the Spirit**
This is called "releasing the embryo." Those who study the Dao, however, remain ignorant of the fire times, the bathing of transformations, and the preparation for transcendence. At the moment of liberation, nothing but oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction will suffice.

**Beginning the Work**
The Gate of the Mysterious Female:
All transformations are forgotten, yet the nature is not forgotten.
Where forgetting is no forgetting, wonder has no form.
This is the Mysterious Pass—how could muddled forms measure it?

**Breaking Through the Pass**
From the moment the pass and aperture are struck open,
The two qi circulate in response to the mechanism of transformation.
Coming and going without hindrance,
Not a thread stirs the turning of the celestial pivot.

**Breaking Through Illusion**
When the heart is bright and the nature is thorough,
Light is round as a mirror.
The moment a thought arises, all forms respond.
Those who study the Dao must not cling to them, for they belong to illusion.
Thus it is said:
*Why is it hard to keep dust from the eye?*
*Only because the nature does not conceal it.*
The moment a thought stirs, the nature ripples—
Ghostly faces and human heads appear in multitude.
This is what is meant by "tranquil yet responsive to stimuli."
If the student does not recognize this, there will be no demons.

**Confronting Demons**
When thoughts continue unbroken, unable to be cut off,
Ghostly faces and human heads appear in a thousand forms.
At once, mobilize the water and fire chariots,
Strike through the three passes, and penetrate straight into the inner court.
The Three Corpses flee, the Six Thieves scatter—
The demon horde naturally disperses.
Wave upon wave of stupor, darkness, and obscurity—
At once, wield the sword and array the *gang* wind.
From the furnace, ignite the fire of the three yang,
And in an instant, sweep away the demonic miasma.

**Establishing the Foundation**
At this stage in the practice of Śākya, it is called "forging into one piece."
Day and night without ceasing, one simply increases the power of concentration,
Advancing day by day, month by month, steadily progressing.
In the Daoist gate, one establishes the foundation and applies the fire times,
Tempering and refining to form the elixir.

When the elixir’s foundation is firm and thoughts are pure,
Day and night, the divine light guards and protects the body.
The two eyes naturally grow weary of forms,
And the single heart silently rests in the Mysterious Real.

**Fire Times**
The eight apertures divide into eight seasonal gates,
Warmth, coolness, cold, and heat responding to Qian and Kun.
If the fire of yin and yang is not lost in the four seasons,
Within the crucible, cinnabar congeals into purple clouds.

Master Bai the Perfected says:
For those who practice the fire times, each of the twelve hours contains one hour—
That is, five *ke*. Within three hundred days, half a month,
Totaling one thousand five hundred *ke*.
One *zhou-tian* through the eight *ke* of the body,
Each *ke* of work gathers a year.
If the student knows to use it thus,
Hunger comes—eat; weariness comes—sleep.

**Bathing**
Bathing within the body is the bathing of qi and timing.
Bathing within the moon is the bathing of the elixir’s head.
Zi Yang says:
*The month of the hare and chicken, and their times.*
These words refer to bathing in the two months.
When essence is whole and qi is vigorous, the medicine furnace is warm.
At the double-eight hour, the root is firmly secured.
Without applying the fire times of withdrawal and addition,
Wash the heart and cleanse the thoughts—Dao abides constantly.

Again:
When the qi tide arrives, one must seal the senses and lower the curtains,
Abiding in profound desirelessness, awaiting the qi tide’s passage.
Do not indulge in scattering the mind—
This is what is meant by "if one cannot secure and contain, the elixir will spill."

At this stage of practice, one must guard against danger,
For it is not like ordinary matters.
When the qi tide arrives, one must nurture and protect,
Seal the pass, close the senses, and abide in non-doing.

**Gathering the Medicine**
When gathering the medicine, observe its maturity—
Tender like a surging spring welling upward,
Mature like ants crawling, like fine hairs.

**Refining**
Close the eyes as if preserving the center,
Like emptiness that is not empty.
When the qi of Kun Palace stirs,
The back blazes with warmth.
The *xun* wind lightly dances,
A single qi penetrates the Celestial Palace.
Close it—do not release—
It transforms into a full head of flowing water.
Slowly release it downward,
And the great earth becomes sweet rain.

**General Secret**
Man’s head is where all yang converges,
Within it lies yin, called true mercury.
The five viscera are where all yin converges,
Within them lies yang, called true lead.
The heart, neither belonging to yang above nor yin below,
Attains the center and serves as the master of the body.
It cannot be seen, cannot be heard,
Yet when struck, it responds and communicates;
When entered, it is still and unmoving.
If one works within this unmoving center until fully refined,
One will know that the transformations of heaven and earth are all contained within oneself.

[Note] This text places great emphasis on the Mysterious Female, for the author holds that "if one comprehends this aperture, then the Three Powers and the myriad things are all contained within oneself." This aperture is not to be grasped as a physical thing. Its principle has no other technique—only forgetting form, extinguishing thoughts, and abiding in the center. With long and thorough practice, when the Central Palace is utterly still, the yang qi within the body will naturally arise. As yang qi gradually grows and yin qi gradually recedes, this is the meaning of "yang waxes as yin wanes." (From the author’s preface)

All that is discussed in this text pertains to the essential points of internal alchemy. The language is somewhat crude, and there are many places where the words fail to convey the meaning. The author, Yu Dongzhen, remains obscure in history.
