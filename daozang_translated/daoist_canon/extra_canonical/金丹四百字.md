**"The Four Hundred Characters on the Golden Elixir [First Section]**
True Soil seizes True Lead,
True Lead refines True Mercury.
Lead and Mercury return to True Soil—
Body and mind in stillness, unmoved.

**[Second Section]**
From emptiness, snow descends below;
From silence, a yellow sprout emerges.
The jade furnace warms gently—
Over the cauldron, purple vapors rise.

**[Third Section]**
In the Flowering Pool, lotuses bloom;
Divine waters, golden waves, lie still.
At midnight, the moon shines bright—
Heaven and Earth, a single mirror wheel.

**[Fourth Section]**
Cinnabar refines the Yang-qi;
Mercury cooks the Golden Essence.
When Essence meets Yang-qi,
Cinnabar and Mercury merge.

**[Fifth Section]**
The Sun’s spirit—fat of the Jade Hare,
The Moon’s essence—marrow of the Golden Crow.
Gathered into the cauldron,
They transform into a single pool of water.

**[Sixth Section]**
Medicine awakens the Mysterious Aperture;
Fire and timing stir the Yang Furnace.
When Dragon and Tiger unite,
The Treasure Cauldron yields the Mysterious Pearl.

**[Seventh Section]**
This aperture is no common thing—
Yin and Yang together forge it.
Called the Divine-Qi Cavity,
Within it dwell the Kan-Li Essences.

**[Eighth Section]**
One drop of Wood-Mercury, crimson;
Three *jin* of Gold-Lead, black.
Lead and Mercury coalesce into elixir—
Layer by layer, violet-golden.

**[Ninth Section]** *(incomplete)*"

「The homestead’s landscapes gleam in splendor,
As winds and rains mark the spring’s due hour.
Plowshares and hoes never cease their labor—
The earth reveals itself as golden treasure.  **[Tenth Section]**

True Lead is born from the *Kan*,
Its purpose lies within the *Li* Palace.
From black, it turns to crimson—
A single cauldron’s vapor thickens into mist.  **[Eleventh Section]**

True Mercury arises from the *Li*,
Yet its use belongs to the *Kan*.
A maiden passes through the Southern Garden,
Her hand clutching a jade olive.  **[Twelfth Section]**

*Zhen* and *Dui* are neither East nor West,
*Kan* and *Li* transcend South and North.
The Dipper’s handle traverses the Heavenly Cycle—
The adept gathers at the pivotal moment.  **[Thirteenth Section]**

Fire and timing need no fixed hour,
For Winter Solstice is not bound to *Zi*.
When seeking the method of bathing,
*Mao* and *You* mark the moment of emptiness.  **[Fourteenth Section]**

Crow’s liver and Hare’s marrow—
Seized and returned to one place.
Grain by grain, they are refined—
From subtle essence to full realization.  **[Fifteenth Section]**

Chaos enfolds the Void,
The Void embraces the Three Realms.
Seeking their origin,
One grain swells like a *shu* millet seed.  **[Sixteenth Section]**

Heaven and Earth merge in True Fluid,
Sun and Moon hold True Essence.
Mastering the *Kan* and *Li* foundation,
The Three Realms return to a singular body.  **[Seventeenth Section]**

The Dragon emerges from the Eastern Sea,
The Tiger rises from the Western Mountain.
Two beasts wage a single battle—
Transformed, they become Heaven and Earth’s kin.  **[Eighteenth Section]」

The golden flower blooms with mercury leaves,
The jade bud sprouts leaden branches.
*Kan* and *Li* never pause—
When will Heaven and Earth align?  **[Nineteenth Section]**

Bathing must guard against peril,
Drawing and adding must be held with caution—
All comes from three ten-thousand *ke*,
A misstep risks the loss of a *hao* or *li*.  **[Twentieth Section]**

When husband and wife unite,
The chamber’s clouds and rains form.
A year’s labor yields a child—
Each one knows how to ride the crane.
