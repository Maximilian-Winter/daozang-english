# 天口篇

**Heaven’s Mouth Chapter**
The ancients said: *"The sage is Heaven’s mouth."* I am no sage—how could I presume to speak for Heaven? Yet I do so only to uphold the August Supreme Lord, whose hidden virtue sustains the people below. To rouse the deaf and awaken the blind is but to fulfill the beauty of Heaven’s all-pervading light! To exhort goodness and correct faults is likewise a good cause for universal deliverance. Though my tongue stammers and falters, I do not shirk my dull roots; though the world teems with multitudes, I earnestly beg you to heed my words. Thus I compose these instructional texts, numbering several chapters, and title them *Heaven’s Mouth*, in gratitude for the venerable Cuiweng’s exalted praise.

Respectfully inscribed by Zhang Sanfeng, the Cavernous Mystery Perfected One.

**The Orthodox Teaching Chapter**
From ancient times to the present, there have been two teachings—no third. Why two? One is *orthodox*, the other *heterodox*. Why no third? Because there is only *the One*, only *the Dao*.

How then are they divided? How do they become three? Since the advent of Confucius, Laozi, and Śākyamuni—even unto their continued presence—though they endure, they are no longer merely Confucius, Laozi, or Śākyamuni. Confucius was fundamentally a Confucian, Laozi a Daoist, and Śākyamuni a Buddhist. Yet though they are distinct, they are ultimately undivided; because they are undivided, they must necessarily converge. Thus, one is neither Confucian nor Daoist, neither Daoist nor Buddhist. Śākyamuni, Confucius, and Laozi are all called *the Dao*.

Confucius’s *cutting off the four* [errors], Laozi’s *embracing the One*, and Śākyamuni’s *emptying the five aggregates*—all are forms of self-cultivation. Confucius’s *benevolence toward the people*, Laozi’s *salvation of the world*, and Śākyamuni’s *relief of suffering*—all are acts of benefiting others. In self-cultivation and benefiting others, their aims are one.

Those who distinguish Confucius, Laozi, and Śākyamuni do so because they mistake names for reality, or forms for principles. To see them as Confucian, Daoist, or Buddhist is to fail to see them as such; though they are not Confucian, Daoist, or Buddhist, they remain Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist. Confucius, Laozi, and Śākyamuni were all ancient sages. The sages’ teachings take *orthodoxy* as their foundation—anything not orthodox is called a *heterodox teaching*.

The Confucians Yang Zhu and Mo Di, the Daoists’ alchemists, and the Buddhists’ demonic monks—these too are "three teachings," yet they are all heterodox. Thus, those who divide the teachings into three are foolish; those who distinguish orthodoxy from heterodoxy are wise.

**The Confucian Canon Chapter**
Beyond the Six Classics, the only writings worthy of emulation are those of Confucius’s school. They do not discourse on transcending the world or expound on mystical scriptures, lest people fall into perilous chasms without true practice.

Confucius and Yan Hui’s cultivation of the mind aimed only at *retreating to nurture their aspirations* and *acting with righteousness to attain the Dao*. The Dao lies in aiding others—mountains and forests are no different from court and market. The Dao lies in self-cultivation—court and market are unstained by mountains and forests. Thus, their words often contain profound meaning, yet interpreting them is exceedingly difficult, as in the second passage of the *Great Learning*.

Confucius’s *self-cultivation* relied on the *four restraints* [against desire]; Yanzi’s *refinement of the self* did likewise. Before their efforts were perfected, they did not leave their humble alleys; once perfected, they did not forget the state. Thus, they could *seek action in reclusion* and *attain reclusion in action*. In reclusion, Confucius and Yan Hui were present; in action, they were also present. Even in neither action nor reclusion were they absent—*spiritual clarity* resided within them, and *transformations* followed their will. This is the true Great Dao.

Confucius transmitted to Zengzi, Zengzi to Zisi, and the *Doctrine of the Mean* is a work of profound and luminous Daoist subtlety, from which those who awaken to the mystery steal the truth—countless as the sands of the Ganges. After Zisi, Mencius stands foremost. He *held fast to the mind* and *nurtured qi*, neither aiding nor forgetting it, filling heaven and earth, *vast and unyielding*. All may be delivered, silently drawing upon it. The wonder of *flood-like qi* is difficult to express in words. In *refuting heterodoxy and aiding orthodoxy*, he overturned Yang Zhu and Mo Di.

I urge you, scholars and commoners alike: do not seek truth on the three isles of immortals—simply take it from the *Four Books*. Regard Yan Hui, Zengzi, Zisi, and Mencius as your enlightened teachers; take *minister, son, younger brother, and friend* as your practices; regard *body, mind, nature, and life* as your mercury and lead; and *refinement in righteousness and ripening in benevolence* as your ascension. When cultivating the Dao, do not covet its use; when nurturing the Dao, do not hasten its practice; when attaining the Dao, you may then manifest it. If the Dao cannot be manifested, vanish like the wind and return, transmitting it to the famous mountains—its source and flow will endure.

**The Chan Essence Chapter**
What is meant by *Śākya*? Śākyamuni said: *"I delight in ‘Śākya,’ so I established the teaching with ‘Śākya,’ taking it to mean ‘releasing the ten thousand conditions.’"*

What is meant by *Buddha*? The Great Being said: *"I delight in ‘Buddha,’ so I established the teaching with ‘Buddha,’ taking it to mean ‘awakening sentient beings.’"*

Thus have I heard: the Śākya Lord *departs the world*; thus have I heard: the Buddha Lord *awakens the world*. The entire canon, numbering hundreds of scriptures, aims only at *transcending worldly defilements* and *rousing the deluded*.

Thus, Śākyamuni is pure, and the Great Being attains purity. Śākyamuni encompasses purity, and the Great Being universalizes it—not clinging to purity, not destroying purity, not begrudging purity. Even to the point of *no purity, not purity; not purity, yet purity*—this is *great purity*, *perfect purity*.

If one can chant the tide-sound [of the sutras], one will attain a *pure mind* and a *prajñā mind*. Yet once prajñā is attained, forget prajñā; if prajñā is not forgotten, it is not prajñā. If it is not prajñā, it is not called prajñā; if it is *not-not prajñā*, then it is prajñā.

One who attains prajñā is called *Śākya*; one who can become Śākya *is* Śākya; there is *Śākya-Śākya*; the Śākya is *not* Śākya-Śākya; the Śākya *itself* is Śākya-Śākya.

This is called *Buddha*; one who can become Buddha *is* Buddha; there is *Buddha-Buddha*; the Buddha is *not* Buddha-Buddha; the Buddha *itself* is Buddha-Buddha.

Śākyamuni is thus; the Great Being is thus; even the śramaṇa bhikṣus are thus.

Can one become Śākya without this? No.
Can one become Buddha without this? No.
Why is this so?
Śākya is Śākya; not-Śākya is not Śākya.
Buddha is Buddha; not-Buddha is not Buddha.
Why is this so?
There is no Śākya beyond Śākya; to grasp Śākya is to be Śākya.
There is no Buddha beyond Buddha; to grasp Buddha is to be Buddha.
Why is this so?
Śākya-Śākya-Śākya: though devoid of Śākya-intent, this is true Śākya-intent.
Buddha-Buddha-Buddha: though devoid of Buddha-thought, this is true Buddha-thought.
Not-Śākya yet Śākya—this is the supreme vehicle.
Not-Buddha yet Buddha—this is the great vehicle.
The sutra treasury of Śākya and Buddha:
it is by becoming Śākya and Buddha that the treasury is formed—this is called the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye.

*Mysterious Sound Chapter*
Mysterious learning takes virtue/power as its essence and the golden elixir as its function; only then can one become an immortal.
There are five ranks of immortals, though in truth there are only four.

First, the human immortal.
The human immortal refines primordial essence to replenish primordial qi, having cultivated the root of immortality. Yet they can only nurture health and do not transcend birth and death—this is the immortal among humans.

Second, the earthly immortal.
The earthly immortal refines primordial qi to congeal the inner elixir, having dispelled the affliction of leakage. Yet they can walk on land and do not leave the dust and soil—this is the immortal among earth.

Third, the divine immortal.
The divine immortal refines primordial spirit to transform into primordial spirit, having attained the marvel of spiritual penetration. Water and fire cannot harm them; they are also called water immortals. When they refine spirit to return to emptiness, they become heavenly immortals.
Thus, below the heavenly immortal is the divine immortal; below the divine immortal is the earthly immortal; below the earthly immortal is the human immortal. Below the human immortal, there are only ghosts and no immortals.
Ghosts are pure yin; immortals are pure yang. Humans possess half yin and half yang, thus they do not escape birth and death. To lack the yin half is to become an immortal; to lack the yang half is to become a ghost.
Therefore, humans exist between the possibility of becoming immortal or ghost—indeed, they temporarily dwell between these two possibilities. To escape this in-between state, one must abide in the ranks of heavenly or divine immortals.
Turn your head to recognize the shore; let go and leave the dust. Though the elixir classics number ten thousand words, all depends on oneself. To mistake the self for another is to fall into heterodox paths.
The writings left by former sages must also be skillfully pondered. It is neither metal nor stone, neither mercury nor lead, neither furnace nor cauldron, neither woman nor man, neither sun nor moon, neither Kun nor Qian, neither father nor mother, neither dragon nor tiger, neither horse nor hare, neither female nor male.
Where, then, is the mystery?
The mystery lies in the mysterious place.

Where lies the marvel?
The marvel lies in the marvelous place.
I possess a true transmission, yet dare not speak recklessly;
People possess true feeling, and thus do not shut their doors.

To broadly accumulate hidden merits is the beginning of immortal rank;
To broadly practice convenience is the foundation of immortality;
To broadly cultivate cause and effect is the root of immortality.

If one finds such a person to seek my Dao,
I would wish to expound the supreme vehicle,
pointing out subtle words,
so that one sees the azure sky as clouds and mist disperse,
and departs with a long whistle.

**The Five Virtues Chapter**
Human life possesses five virtues,
which I have likened to the five phases of Heaven and Earth,
and the five channels of the human body.

Benevolence pertains to Wood and the liver;
Righteousness pertains to Metal and the lungs;
Propriety pertains to Fire and the heart;
Wisdom pertains to Water and the kidneys;
Trustworthiness pertains to Earth and the spleen.

Thus, not one of the five virtues may be lacking,
just as not one of the five channels may be severed,
or one of the five phases may be absent.

All say Wood cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no benevolence?
Without benevolence, one must lack the thought of nurturing,
and the liver is already severed,
so Wood withers and dries!

All say Metal cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no righteousness?
Without righteousness, one must lack the thought of expediency,
and the lungs are already severed,
so Metal rusts and dulls!

All say Fire cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no propriety?
Without propriety, one must lack a radiant countenance,
and the heart is already severed,
so Fire declines and extinguishes!

All say Water cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no wisdom?
Without wisdom, one must lack a clear and serene intent,
and the kidneys are already severed,
so Water darkens and dries!

All say Earth cannot be lacking,
yet why is there no trustworthiness?
Without trustworthiness, one must lack a sincere and trusting nature,
and the spleen is already severed,
so Earth crumbles and collapses!

Thus, one who would be human
must first possess the five virtues of the heart,
and only then the five channels of the body.

When benevolence is not severed, the liver’s qi flourishes;
When righteousness is not severed, the lungs’ qi is balanced;
When propriety is not severed, the heart’s qi is luminous;
When wisdom is not severed, the kidneys’ qi is numinous;
When trustworthiness is not severed, the spleen’s qi is awakened.

Virtue envelops the body,
the body envelops the heart,
the body serves the heart,
and the heart is illuminated by virtue.

This body is the heart,
this heart is the body,
and this royal virtue is the five channels.

When virtue is lost, the channels are lost;
when virtue is perfected, the body is perfected;
when the body is perfected, the channels are perfected.
Only then can one assist and harmonize with the five phases of Heaven and Earth.

**The Filial Conduct Chapter**
The osmanthus palace displays its pillars and couplets,
and of the hundred conducts, filial piety comes first.
If the cultured ancestor could practice filial piety,
his fragrance would endure for ten thousand myriad years.

Thus, in one’s own person,
to accomplish the Dao is to become an immortal;
to become an immortal is to become a sage;
to become a sage is to be both worthy and virtuous.

Radiance opens the sun and moon,
and love and longing connect Earth and Heaven.
If the people of the world desire to emulate filial piety,
know that filial piety is the origin of the hundred conducts.

When Yu Shun ordered the hundred offices, filial piety stood before all commendations;
When King Wen of Zhou rectified the hundred norms, filial piety preceded all good reputations.
Master Zeng valued the three ways, yet serving parents was the greatest;
Master Min excelled in the four virtues, yet serving his mother was most earnest.

Since ancient times, there have been many filial children—
I shall briefly expound a few examples.
Do not regard this as a mere filial classic;
you must observe it as a model of filial conduct.

Some carried rice on their backs,
some left behind savory broth;
some gazed at white clouds,
some wore patched robes;
some wept until their strength waned,
some cherished fresh tangerines;
some prayed for bamboo to sprout,
some moved stones to flow with springs;
some remembered the crow’s return to feed its parent,
some entreated the fish to leap from the abyss;
some held the An Yang decree,
some set aside the *Liao E* ode;
some canceled feasts out of longing,
some aged their faces in service—
all were streams of worthy and sagely men,
could there be no words of virtuous merit?

Among their hundred fine deeds,
none surpasses the enduring embrace of filial piety.

Only through filial piety can one befriend others;
shifting filial piety can become loyalty.
Only through filial piety can one model conduct for a wife;
through filial piety, one gains trust among friends.
One act of filial piety encompasses the five relationships—
know that filial piety can be a moral influence.

Supreme filial piety resides in the heart,
and love and longing reveal one’s true nature;
Moderate filial piety resides in the body,
and service and support should be earnest.

Though one may speak of filial piety,
one must both know and practice it.
Though one may feign filial piety on the face,
one deceives both others and one’s kin.

The virtue of filial piety is boundless—
each thought gains a portion,
portion by portion, inch by inch,
each inch reaches the heavenly spirits.

Filial, filial, ever filial,
sincere, sincere, ever sincere.
I compose this *Filial Classic*,
the great classic within the classics.

**The Debauchery and Evil Chapter**
The osmanthus palace bears its pillar inscriptions,
and of the ten thousand evils, debauchery is foremost.
Thus, the retributions for evil are many,
but none are as shameful as the retribution for debauchery.

Heaven’s punishments are each wondrous,
Heaven’s penalties are each manifest.
Some seduce another’s wife,
only for their own wife to be seduced by another;
Some embrace another’s daughter,
only for their own daughter to be embraced by another;
Some perish by lewdness;
Some cut off their posterity by lewdness;
Some squander their family’s wealth;
Some forfeit their official rank and longevity;
Some beget base descendants!
Some follow deceit and fraud,
and the retributions for debauchery are endless—
brush and ink cannot exhaust them.

This evil—who can let it pass?
Why do they not turn back!

One may say the debauched are full,
yet punishment arrives only when sins are complete.
But the moment one is debauched, retribution follows—
Heaven’s mirror brooks no leniency.

One case of a lewd ghost—
how lamentable, truly lamentable!
I urge you, people of the world,
do not violate the precept against debauchery.

What you have not seen, do not think of;
what you have seen, do not act upon.
Do not jest with virgins,
do not trifle with chaste women.
When you encounter another’s wife or concubine,
regard her as your sister.
Do not defile maidservants or male servants,
do not dally with courtesans or actresses.

The rouge and powder of a moment are but fleeting flowers,
and one’s spirit scatters in an instant.
To preserve the body, one must exit the pit;
to escape suffering, one must cross the shore.

Even with your own wife,
intimate feelings within the boudoir should be moderated.
To give rise to proper thoughts,
one must establish boundaries of reverence and avoidance.

Whether on the birthdays of sages and deities,
during solar or lunar eclipses,
on the days of the Stove God’s sacrifice,
on inauspicious days,
during dark and gloomy conjunctions,
or amid thunder and lightning—
one must separate quilts and beds,
or even beds and chambers.

The celestial spirits observe one’s reverence,
and blessings bestow themselves upon those who seek them.
The immortals honor one’s integrity,
and those who seek the Dao shall attain it.
If one can further refrain from all evils,
they are truly a great hero.

**On Retribution for Giving**

For families of wealth and nobility, accumulating goodness is easy,
yet seeking good retribution is not so simple.
It is not that goodness goes unrewarded,
but that retribution is measured by its weight.
For families of poverty and lowliness, accumulating goodness is difficult,
yet receiving good retribution is not hard.
It is not that goodness alone is rewarded,
but that retribution is likewise measured by its weight.
As for those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor lowly,
their accumulation of goodness and receipt of retribution
are also meted out in proportion.

By the measure of gold given:
When the high and noble donate gold, a hundred taels yield ten merits;
when the poor and lowly donate gold, ten taels yield ten merits.

By the measure of aiding others:
When the rich and noble aid others, helping a hundred yields ten virtues;
when the poor and lowly aid others, helping ten yields ten virtues.
For those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor lowly,
the standard is set by the common man.

For the wealthy and noble to claim the standard of the common man is improper;
to claim the standard of the poor and lowly is even more so.
What one generation amasses, the next dissipates;
what one generation strengthens, the next weakens.

Yet if the wealthy and noble act with propriety in their goodness,
even a few hundred taels will surely bring great retribution—
they need only expand and fulfill it.
For the poor and lowly to forcibly imitate the common man is unwise;
to forcibly imitate the wealthy and noble is even more so.
Lack of sustenance breeds transgression,
and deep hunger and cold invite the resentment of wife and children.
Yet if the poor and lowly act with propriety in their goodness,
even as their household teeters on collapse,
great retribution will surely follow—
they need only weigh and apply it wisely.

Heaven does not fail the good.
But if one dwells in wealth and nobility yet hoards their fortune,
rewarding much goodness with little,
or swift goodness with delayed retribution,
and thus neglects the cultivation of virtue,
then calamity will not be long in coming,
and misfortune will be plentiful.
A once-prosperous clan may vanish in an instant,
and the gates of a marquisate may crumble to ashes—
such are the consequences.
If one dwells in poverty and lowliness yet boasts of their deeds,
rewarding little goodness with little,
or delayed goodness with delayed retribution,
and thus treats virtue with carelessness,
then the calamities they invite will be stranger still,
and their misfortunes more severe.
Amid the desolation of war,
or the wandering of plague and sickness,
such fates unfold.
The same applies to those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor lowly.

Why is this so?
Those who dwell in wealth and nobility
possess the power and position to accumulate goodness.
For one born into such circumstances,
even if goodness goes unrewarded, it is their due—
clothed in abundance, fed in abundance,
renowned in name, prosperous in life.
To enjoy such peace and honor,
and to pass it on to one’s descendants,
is itself a form of good retribution.
Yet if they scorn goodness and refuse to act,
expecting retribution while indulging in reckless greed,
then Heaven will transfer their power to the virtuous,
showing no mercy.

Those who dwell in poverty and lowliness
lack the power and position to accumulate goodness.
For one born into such circumstances,
even small acts of kindness seem unremarkable.
Cherishing words and objects,
loving others and all things—
if one can persist in such ways,
piling earth into mountains,
gathering water into seas,
good retribution will surely follow.
Yet if they spurn goodness and refuse to act,
expecting retribution while their hearts grow dim,
then Heaven will deepen their hardship,
punishing the wicked without favor.

Thus is the law of good retribution,
and thus is the law of evil retribution.
Let those who are neither rich nor noble, neither poor nor lowly observe this.
Let those who are rich or noble, poor or lowly reflect upon it.

Alas!
The principle of giving and retribution
is seen most clearly by sages and worthies,
and practiced most greatly by immortals and buddhas.
Even the chivalrous may sometimes exceed in their deeds,
yet if the common people could but match the chivalrous,
it would be enough.
I, in my youth, delighted in giving,
and by good fortune ascended to the Nine Heavens,
thus gaining clear insight into the retribution between heaven and humanity.
How could this be mere abstruse theory?
Even the heart of Heaven operates thus.
Yet what does Heaven say?

**On Fullness and Decline**

The affairs of the world and the state
are ever subject to waxing and waning, obscurity and clarity,
fullness and decline.
The common people attribute this to the cycles of Heaven,
while the enlightened ascribe it to the hearts of men.
Their reasoning is sound, their words pure—
what commentary could I add?

Yet there are those who decline before reaching fullness,
or who, though destined to decline, do not.
The causes and circumstances of such cases
I shall now expound in detail, to serve as admonition for the world.

The momentum of a state’s power,
once at its peak, begins to wane.
Some dynasties face turmoil in a single generation,
and sigh over peril and collapse by the next.
If this is called decline,
why do some revive through restoration?
If this is not called fullness,
why do great crises suddenly arise?

For it is when rulers do not draw near to the worthy and capable
that treacherous villains corrupt governance;
when they do not cultivate poetry and ritual,
that descendants grow extravagant and reckless.
In times of peace and prosperity,
one must still harbor thoughts of peril.
With foresight and vigilance,
the noble-minded should take heed,
to fulfill Heaven’s allotted span.
Yet even Heaven’s span is not endless—
if one daily maintains fullness,
ten thousand years may yet be attained.

The vital energy of a state’s destiny,
once plunged into chaos, begins to stabilize.
Some dynasties, though their fortune wanes, regain their strength;
though their power declines, it rises again.
If this is not called decline,
why do they teeter like eggs on the brink?
If this is called decline,
why do they once more enjoy peace and stability?

For when one reins in the horse at the cliff’s edge,
disaster may yet be averted;
when one turns back upon witnessing the scene,
the dynasty’s blessings may endure.
Even in the smallest pleasures of feasting and drinking,
it is difficult to sustain unending joy.
Extending this principle to greater matters,
the noble-minded should awaken with urgency,
to avert Heaven’s ordained calamities.
Yet Heaven’s calamities are not fixed—
if one daily guards against decline,
even the mediocre may long endure.

Ah!
The heart of Heaven lies within human affairs—
why do people not strive for goodness?

**On Praise and Blame**

Why do people blame me?
Why do they praise me?
Why do they blame others?
Why do they praise others?

One who craves praise yet falls short of merit invites blame;
one who guards against blame and corrects their faults earns praise.
Thus, those who praise or blame me act without gradual cause,
while I invite praise or blame through gradual deeds.
Those who praise or blame others act without reason,
while others invite praise or blame for their own reasons.

I love that all under Heaven seek no praise,
yet act in ways worthy of praise;
I despise that all under Heaven fear no blame,
yet indulge in deeds that invite it.
I am ashamed that all under Heaven, unaware of praise or blame,
fade into obscurity—
to fade into obscurity is to self-destruct without others’ blame.

Those who, in life, self-destruct through their faults will surely be praised;
those who, in life, self-praise for their merits will surely be blamed.
Yet if praise exceeds truth, the wind of mutual flattery arises;
if blame exceeds truth, those who demand perfection deserve condemnation.
Let the world take heed and be warned.

**On Longevity and Shortness**

Who is fated for long life? Who for short?
Gazing from on high, the Emperor sees no separate eyes.
To teach all beings to flourish together,
the great earth must teem with life.
Thus, benevolence brings longevity, malice brings retribution;
merit brings longevity, faults bring reduction;
nurture brings longevity, harm brings loss.
Even immortals, Buddhas, and sages may not escape kalpas,
yet singing may serve as words to summon the lost back.

**On Prosperity and Adversity**

The prosperous know no endless sorrow,
while the sorrowful lack cultivated virtue.
Flourishing and withering—two paths like spring and autumn,
yet I dwell in both, free in concealment or display.
Life rushes by like an arrow—
why rejoice in prosperity? Why sigh in adversity?
Circumstances may bind, but not the hero;
fate may be endured, so play idly.
Reading to cultivate the Dao, one’s noble qi soars like a dragon;
with Yan’s gourd and a zither’s notes, Confucius and Xu would approve.
With a robe’s lapel and a Fuqin’s strings, I too may follow.
The dragon in the hut ascends to the clouds;
the donkey by the lake roams carefree.
Clouds rise to become timely rain;
streams recede to visit the pine and cypress.
Or, without ambition for office, like Yan or Wang the woodcutter—
why torment oneself to die in the weeds?

**On Character**

The boundaries of human character must be clearly discerned.
Some possess an upright qi, standing apart from the crowd—
others call them arrogant, I call them resolute.
Some dwell in humble light, no different from the world—
others call them fickle, I call them harmonious.
Some roam freely, following their nature—
others call them lazy, I call them at ease.
Some chant and sing as they please, following destiny—
others call them mad, I call them enlightened.
Some hold themselves with solemn dignity, bearing noble restraint—
others call them proud, I call them stern.
Some stand with simple integrity, their nature firm and enduring—
others call them dull, I call them unadorned.
Some distinguish right from profit, free of self-interest—
others call them affected, I call them principled.
Some have lofty hearts, untouched by worldly dust—
others call them eccentric, I call them noble.
Some radiate warmth and harmony, unversed in letters—
others call them vulgar, I call them refined.
Some take stillness as their cause, ignorant of scriptures and repentance—
others call them foolish, I call them awakened.
Some eat and drink no differently, unharmed by cold or heat—
others call them strange, I call them immortal.

Amid the mingling of worthy and unworthy,
some appear similar yet differ in truth—
one must observe closely.

Do not slight others’ hearts while valuing your own,
do not belittle others’ hearts while prizing your own,
do not lack others’ hearts while possessing your own—
then the spirit of the perfected emerges.
Shun lived in the mountains, differing little from others,
yet upon hearing one good word or seeing one good deed,
he shone like a crimson peak, his radiance filling the sky.

**On Joyful Living**

An old man from Ancheng said to Lord Weicheng:
"I hear that to live in a peaceful age is to be a man of peace—
without hierarchy, dwelling in ease and benevolence.
Do you know the joys of such a life?
Let me compose a brief rhapsody for you.

Red dust rolls on;
the bitter sea surges.
Follow me, guard my conduct;
nurture my vastness, preserve my loftiness.
Preserve great harmony, dispel worldly cares;
end strife, lessen contention.
Endure cold to deepen learning and cultivation;
forget desires to dwell in the groves.
As an official, do no wrong;
as a scholar, avoid resentment.
Teach children to shun debauchery and gambling;
instruct women to keep the household solemn.
Farming yields no shortage for taxes;
studies neglect not the garden of virtue.
Drink communal wine to cure deafness;
be a pillar among the people.
Dignified in bearing, ancient in appearance;
unfettered in spirit, whole in essence.
Amid the clamor of right and wrong,
all grievances vanish."

Be able to release life and abstain from killing;
thus nurture nature to prolong years.
With village elders, discourse on maxims;
summon the younger generation to expound merits and faults.
Perfect oneself to perfect others;
transform a thousand faces, ten thousand forms.
Spread mats in the thatched hall;
invite the mountain elder to take the seat of honor.
Plant lotuses of the gentleman in the pond;
cultivate chrysanthemums of Master Tao along the fence.
Plum blossoms fragrance the earth of the mountain;
bamboo fills the ravine of the recluse.
At ease wherever one finds oneself,
can one not find joy in what is not joy?

Now you, with furrowed brows and a heart of stagnant blood,
tread the marketplace;
cast your body among springs and rocks.
Staying brings no peace;
leaving brings no benefit.
You love greed and love strife;
you crave finery and crave indulgence.
Ground down with the dusty world,
you watch the setting sun fade away.

The distressed man then sighed and said, "Alas!
The immortal elder’s teachings reach even this!
I humbly receive your instruction."
He bowed deeply and withdrew.

**On Yielding**

In a chamber of harmony, in a household of accumulated virtue,
"west wall and east hall are fitting places for inscribed maxims."
For example, when one suffers a loss, many feel indignation.
Yet if I can endure and yield,
this is to cultivate harmony for myself
and to accumulate virtue for my children and grandchildren.
Now I shall inscribe a few sayings of sages, worthies, and wise men
to exhort others.

Some say:
*"What benefits others benefits oneself;
what suits others suits oneself.
If I benefit others but not myself,
if I suit others but not myself—"*
Some say:
*"Those who endure losses enjoy abundant fortune;
those who profit excessively always lose."*
Some say:
*"If everyone were to prevail,
who in the world would be left to bear the name of the vanquished?"*
Some say:
*"The two words 'fullness' and 'emptiness' are decreed by Heaven and Earth;
when one has endured every loss, the calamity is already dispelled."*
I too have a saying:
*"When I have endured many losses, Heaven cannot bear it,
and Heaven will surely grant me advantage."*

Students, take heed!
Those who endure losses ultimately suffer no loss.

**On Loyalty and Empathy**

Loyalty and empathy are the single thread transmitted by the Proclaimed Sage.
What is this "single thread that runs through"?
Loyalty is the essence, empathy the function.
"Loyalty" means centering the heart;
"empathy" means aligning with the hearts of others.
Does not the meaning of "establishing oneself to establish others" lie herein?

Loyalty unifies empathy.
Using the Way of empathy as benevolence,
one can refrain from imposing what one does not desire,
and the Heavenly heart remains undisturbed by human desires.
Using the Way of empathy in the world,
one can endure offenses without retaliation,
and the human heart remains free from violent opposition.
Using the Way of empathy to govern,
one can refrain from imposing what one detests,
and the hearts of ministers remain free from cruel policies.

The principles of sages and worthies,
drop by drop, return to their source—
truly, they can be practiced throughout one’s life.

If one merely desires to align with one’s own heart
but not with the hearts of others,
then one’s heart will surely generate
a mind that favors oneself over others,
a mind that values oneself and devalues others,
a mind that prioritizes oneself and belittles others,
a mind that profits oneself and harms others,
a mind that succeeds oneself and fails others.
All such minds are not aligned with the hearts of others.
If not aligned with the hearts of others,
how can one align with one’s own heart?
Though one may desire to align with one’s own heart,
greed harms the heart;
if unable to align with one’s own heart,
endurance corrupts the heart.
When the heart is corrupted, the heart is lost.
When the heart is lost, there is no center.
With the center gone, the root of benevolence dies—
no wonder the heart lacks empathy.

Thus, those who are not loyal
also fail to uphold the thread of empathy.
I wish for you, scholars,
to seek the meaning of this single thread,
to preserve its truth,
so that you may not become offenders against the gate of Confucius.

**On Emptiness and Nothingness**

Emptiness and nothingness are the shared teachings of Laozi and the Buddha.
What is emptiness?
An empty heart.
When the heart is empty, the spirit is clear;
when the spirit is clear, nature is wise.
Great transcendence, great enlightenment arise from this.
What is nothingness?
No self.
When there is no self, there are no others;
when there are no others, there are no desires.
Great purity, great joy are attained from this.

Now you, my two disciples,
do not understand emptiness and nothingness
but only seek "solid existence."
The term "solid existence" sounds fine,
yet in the end, those who enter delusion are like
those who, in their eagerness to seek reality, discuss minerals and metals—
achieving nothing—
or those who daily seek existence while reciting Chan verses,
only to generate the six dusts.
Of the infinite sands of the Ganges,
who has attained the first *paramita*?

I pity your ignorance;
I open the gate to your wisdom.
Observe the empty heart leading to innate wisdom,
and know that emptiness can grasp reality.
Observe the absence of self leading to the absence of desire,
and know that nothingness can encompass existence.
Confucius had no self;
Yanzi cultivated an empty heart.
Even Confucians esteemed this—
how much more should you?

**On Nurturing Life**

Of all human desires,
none surpasses the desire for life.
To attain life,
one must value life;
to value life,
one must never treat life lightly.
Sacrificing oneself to perfect benevolence,
offering one’s life in the face of danger—
this is not treating life lightly.
Preserving life in ordinary times,
using it in critical moments—
this differs from a vain existence,
for though one may die, one yet lives.
Loyal ministers, righteous scholars,
chaste women, steadfast widows—
only those who value life can achieve this.

If one lives in times of peace,
encounters a flourishing age,
whether noble or humble,
fulfills filial piety and loyalty,
serves as a pillar for the state,
or becomes a paragon for the world—
then one who cherishes life
must know how to nurture it.

The discourse on nurturing life
differs from the cultivation of truth.
Cultivating truth can escape calamity—
this is the Dao.
Nurturing life can prolong years—
this is technique.
Yet if one nurtures life without understanding
the principles of Heaven, Earth, and humanity from ancient times to the present,
one will ultimately find no effective method.

The people of antiquity,
with their unadorned simplicity,
harbored few concerns, few thoughts,
spoke little, laughed little,
saw little, heard little,
wore coarse clothes, ate rough food,
knew not, sought not—
thus they preserved their true nature
and attained long life.

The people of recent times,
with their daily-growing vanity,
harbor many concerns, many thoughts,
speak much, laugh much,
see much, hear much,
wear fine clothes, eat rich food,
scatter their will, dissipate their spirit—
thus they often injure their nature
and hasten their early demise.

The harmony of Heaven’s Dao lies in its power of return:
the sun, though waning, regains its fullness;
the moon, though waning, becomes round again;
rain, though ceasing, brings clear skies;
thunder, though roaring, returns to silence—
thus it preserves an undiminished spirit
and perpetuates the celestial cycles in ever-renewing freshness.
The disharmony of human Dao lies in excessive depletion:
essence is allowed to drain,
qi is allowed to wane,
the spirit ceaselessly moves,
the form unsteadily holds—
thus it is difficult to restore an already exhausted body
and merely linger in the world from dawn to dusk.

Therefore, for one who nurtures life,
medicine and diet come second,
protection comes first.
One may learn from Heaven’s Dao,
or one may learn from the ancients.

Alas! How lamentable!
All people are bound by the five kalpas.

What are the five kalpas?
Birth, aging, sickness, death, and suffering.
Must one not be born?
One should be born uprightly, born rightly—
not born in delusion.
To be born as a sage or worthy,
even if one dies young, is still to have lived—
one’s radiant spirit remains in the world,
one’s reputation endures,
one’s fragrance lingers—
how is this different from immortals or buddhas?
Only those who live evilly,
live cruelly,
live brutally—
after one life, they will not be born again as they were,
not that they will not be born at all,
but that they will be born rightly,
cycle after cycle,
all falling into evil destinies,
suffering uninterrupted torment,
and though they may wish not to be born, they cannot escape it.

Birth is but one kalpa.
Thus, sinking into the world,
struggling in human life,
unaware of turning the tide, unknowing of change—
slowly, one grows old: this is another kalpa.
Thus, essence depleted, form withered,
spirit gone, qi exhausted,
medicine cannot replenish,
nurture cannot restore—
weakly, one falls ill: this is another kalpa.
Thus, impermanence suddenly arrives,
the great limit draws near,
where is one’s home? Who are one’s wife and children?
Hastily, one dies: this is another kalpa.
Thus, evil must be repaid,
transgressions must be repaid,
wandering through the netherworld,
whimpering in sorrow—
this is extreme suffering, the stirring of karma.

Fortunately, if one is reborn one day,
one may be fated for blades and warfare,
or for water and fire,
or for various afflictions and hardships,
or for various trials and poverty—
still one will drift endlessly among the five kalpas,
not to mention the knife mountains and hells.
Those who fall into this kalpa
cannot dissolve their karmic debts
without cause and effect,
without virtue and merit.

Thus, in one’s lifetime,
one must cultivate goodness and accumulate blessings,
return to the origin and restore the primordial—
only then can one ascend the Terrace of Spring
and together attain ultimate bliss.
To be born is to seek long life;
to attain long life is to transcend birth;
to transcend birth is to transcend extinction;
to transcend extinction is to achieve liberation.
Let people strive for this!

**On Revering the Divine**

The divine is that which subtly pervades all things.
The Supreme Emperor established teachings through the divine Dao,
and thus the divine truly governs good and evil.
All who are wise, bright, upright, and just
are entrusted with the divine’s authority.
The celestial spirits are the divine,
guiding all things;
the earthly spirits are the deities,
upholding all things—
this is the vast virtue of the divine,
which the people receive daily yet do not perceive.
Only by fully exhausting one’s humanity
to align with Heaven and Earth can this be so.

As for the sacred peaks, rivers, suburban altars,
temples, shrines, and monasteries—
the steles erected and images enshrined within
are all imbued with the spirit of antiquity.
Their halls are grand,
their numinous power resplendent—
all who gaze upon them cannot but stand in solemn reverence.

Yet when incense burns brightly, those who pray for blessings multiply;
when supplications are frequent, those who seek blessings arrive—
how could the divine be deceived by people?
The origins of the divine are manifold,
but all arise from the upright qi.

As the *Discourses of Lu* states:
"In the ancestral rites of the sage-kings,
those who established laws for the people were enshrined,
those who labored to the death in service were enshrined,
those who toiled to stabilize the state were sacrificed to,
those who averted great disasters were enshrined,
those who warded off great calamities were enshrined"—
and the mountains, rivers, and altars of the soil and grain
were all those who had rendered great merit to the people.

To "establish laws for the people"
was never to expect repayment;
to "labor to the death in service"
was never to hope for gratitude;
to "toil to stabilize the state"
was never to seek favor;
to "avert great disasters" or "ward off great calamities"
was never to await entreaty.
To spread merit and virtue among the people
was never to wait for their prayers.

Even in the solemn rites of spring and autumn,
with frequent offerings and sacrifices,
the ancestral temple’s purpose is merely to pray to the divine
to protect our lord and state—
nothing to do with oneself;
merely to pray to the divine
to protect our parents—
nothing to do with oneself;
merely to pray to the divine
to bless our people and creatures—
nothing to do with oneself;
merely to pray to the divine
to deliver lost souls and lingering spirits—
nothing to do with oneself.

Moreover, one purifies one’s body,
cleanses one’s thoughts,
calms one’s concerns,
washes one’s heart and liver—
revering the heart to revere the divine—
thus, without seeking blessings, one naturally obtains them.
Therefore, to revere the divine
is not as wondrous as revering one’s own heart.

The human heart is the divine,
the divine is the heart.
Only without shame in the heart
can one be without shame before the divine.
One can face the divine,
and one can face the heart—
yet the divine is not beyond the heart.
It dwells in your chamber,
it dwells in your heart.

Just as the divine of Heaven abides in the sun,
and wherever the sunlight shines, nothing is unseen;
the divine of the human heart abides in the eyes,
and wherever the gaze falls, nothing is hidden.
Yet people still seek to flatter and ingratiate themselves with the divine
to erase their sins and impurities—
how could this be possible?

Beware: the way of revering the divine has two paths,
and the obsequious flattery of the vulgar is not among them.

The superior person maintains a heart of uprightness and magnanimity, establishing merit and conduct with profound and far-reaching intent. In their dwelling and movements, they fear the divine’s scrutiny, and though blessings and felicity come, they still attribute them to the divine’s consideration. Such a person, though they may never burn incense or hold candles, nor reverently approach the temple gates, has already grasped the great Way of revering the divine.

The middling person maintains a heart of meticulous reverence, speaking of the Emperor of Heaven with trembling awe. When good thoughts arise, they are spurred by the divine’s encouragement; when merit and virtue accrue, their heart bears the divine’s grace. Such a person, though they may fast, bathe, and pay homage to the bodhisattvas, may be said to follow the lesser Way of revering the divine.

As for those who outwardly display petty caution while inwardly harboring great wickedness—rushing to and fro on the first and fifteenth days of the month—the divine will say: *"You come to me, yet I seek you out! Do not flatter me, do not profane me. You offer me incense, and I bind you in chains. Go and reform your heart—only then may it be acceptable!"*

**On Loving Others**
Of all things born, humans are the most numinous. Having surpassed other beings in spirit, they must cherish their own lives. Do not scheme against others in secret, do not harm them with sharp weapons, do not poison them with drugs, do not oppress them with power. Those who entrap, injure, poison, or oppress others—whether by fire or other means—face clear punishment by state law and hidden retribution from Heaven; none shall escape in the end.

Even creatures that can speak and dance, plants with fragrance and color, animals that can be tamed and played with, and aquatic beings that can be raised and enjoyed—humans still cherish them. How could humans not be more precious than these?

Now I urge you, people of the world: live together in harmony, do not bully or abuse one another. In your comings and goings, reflect on the virtue of loving others, of accomplishing for others—their reputation, their merit, their affairs, their benefit. For in accomplishing another’s reputation, you accomplish your own; in accomplishing another’s merit, you accomplish your own; in accomplishing another’s affairs, you accomplish your own; in accomplishing another’s benefit, you accomplish your own. All is love.

When you accomplish another’s reputation, merit, affairs, or benefit, do not obscure the loyalty of loyal ministers, do not steal the achievements of meritorious officials, do not slander the chastity of widows, do not defame the purity of maidens. Do not envy ability, nor falsely claim another’s skill; do not resent talent, nor conceal another’s gifts. Do not hide goodness, nor steal another’s virtue; do not spread evil, nor imitate another’s wrongdoing. Do not secretly obstruct another’s advancement, do not recklessly erase another’s writings, do not ruin another’s grand undertakings, do not undermine another’s good deeds. Do not thwart another’s noble plans, do not diminish another’s wealth or longevity, do not seize another’s land, do not meddle with another’s property. Do not aid villains in seizing the geomantic fortunes of the virtuous, do not ally with petty men to lead astray the descendants of the renowned. The embrace of universal compassion is too vast to enumerate fully.

Thus, the Everlasting Heavenly Worthy tirelessly exhorts: do not humiliate the good and the humble, do not deceive the poor and destitute, do not separate fathers from children, do not divide flesh and blood, do not break marriages, do not mock the deaf and mute. Rescue those in peril, aid those in urgent need, pity the orphaned, tolerate others’ faults, relieve suffering, provide for the hungry and cold, support your kin, assist neighbors and friends, show compassion to widows and orphans, respect the elderly, and cherish the poor. All these are acts of loving others.

Alas! Heaven births countless beings to serve as the ground for the benevolent to practice benevolence, the stage for the good to accumulate goodness. If one can extend their heart broadly and protect and nurture the multitudes—whether dwelling in wealth and nobility or poverty and lowliness—those who love others will surely prosper their descendants or achieve prominence. Heaven blesses the good, the Emperor favors the virtuous; since ancient times, such rewards have been most abundant and swift.

Therefore, to those who wish to know the Way of living in the world, I still urge: love others.

**On Medicine**
The Way of medicine can preserve a state or sicken it; medicine in the world can save lives or take them. One cannot be careless in this art. There is a principle within it—learning it is endless, practicing it is boundless.

Medicines are divided into sovereign, minister, assistant, and courier; illnesses are distinguished as deficient or excessive, chronic or acute. Though all physicians can speak of these, few truly understand them. The sages’ learning is refined, yet their aspirations grow ever humbler; their virtue is lofty, yet their hearts remain modest. Those who practice the art of *Qi Huang* should be the same. Do not belittle yourself, do not mislead yourself, do not deceive yourself. To deceive yourself is to deceive others; to mislead yourself is to mislead others; to belittle yourself is to belittle others. The sin of such actions rests upon your own person.

Thus, in this Way, achieving merit is easy, but incurring fault is also easy; accumulating blessings is difficult, but inviting disaster is not. To seek merit without fault, blessings without disaster, one must hold oneself in vigilant restraint. The subtleties of pulse and principle are profound; shallow learning cannot grasp them.

Now I urge you, physicians: when entering a patient’s chamber, first inquire about their history—do not experiment with medicines on them. Now I urge you, patients: before the physician, first clarify the cause—do not gamble your life to test the doctor. To gamble your life to test the doctor is your own fault; to experiment with medicines on others is the physician’s fault.

Furthermore, when aiding the critically ill, do not inflate your fees; when saving the destitute, do not calculate payment. If you can clearly discern the symptoms, proceed to rescue them; if you cannot, defer to those more skilled—this is the accumulation of steadfast and sincere goodness.

I further urge you, scholars and literati: study the divine prescriptions extensively, delve deeply into the principles of medicine. Do not hoard knowledge, do not act recklessly—benefit yourself and others. Fan Wenzheng and Lu Xuangong, with the hearts of loyal ministers, devoted great attention to medicine. How could one neglect the Way of medicine?

**On Physiognomy and Divination**
The superior person has their physiognomy, the inferior person has theirs, but the middling person has no fixed physiognomy.

The superior person has their destiny, the inferior person has theirs, but the middling person has no fixed destiny. As for the superior and the inferior, their natures are difficult to alter—this need not be discussed. Now, it is only you, the middling person, neither high nor low, who may rise or fall, now ascending, now descending. Neither high nor low is still low; capable of rising or falling remains low; sometimes rising or falling ultimately remains low—only by breaking free from the low can one cease to be low. Physiognomy is transformed by oneself, destiny is shaped by oneself; the ancients spoke truly and did not deceive you.

Even those who practice physiognomy and divination—though they may excel in reading your form, they cannot read your heart; though they may excel in calculating your fate, they cannot calculate your virtue. If they cannot read your heart, they cannot truly read your form; if they cannot calculate your virtue, they cannot truly calculate your fate. Do not be foolish in accepting physiognomy, for wisdom lies beyond appearances; when the heart is upright, even favorable readings are good. Do not be deceived by divination, for spirit transcends fate; when virtue is steadfast, even one’s destiny is good.

I wish for you, people of the world, to read your own form and calculate your own fate. I wish for you, physiognomists, to urge great cultivation of the heart. I wish for you, diviners, to encourage others to accumulate virtue. All bone and qi—observe what the books describe; all fortune and misfortune—follow what the books predict. Yet when predicting, speak again of virtue; when describing, speak again of the heart. Embed exhortation and transformation within physiognomy and divination, and the Three Ancestors of the *Máyī* tradition and Master Zǐpíng will surely grant you sustenance.

**On Geomancy**
Heaven covers both good and evil, earth bears both good and evil, and the immortal masters conceal both good and evil for heaven and earth. Heaven covers without partiality, earth bears without partiality, and the immortal masters bestow favor without partiality. When people are swayed by selfish desires, their perception of principle becomes obscured. Geomancy is the principle of heaven. Where there is the principle of heaven, there is no room for human desire—thus, only the wise, upright, sagely, and virtuous can truly discourse on it.

Now, you people of the world recklessly discuss fengshui, profaning the mountain spirits. You exhume the bones of your kin to seek fortune and rank, consult temporal masters to debate blessings and misfortunes, either searching on others’ behalf or seeking for yourselves. You swindle people’s wealth, demand their praise, and with such hearts, how can you know the principle of heaven? "Nine out of ten geomancers end in poverty"—what is strange about this?

When the immortal masters bestow land, the auspicious receive auspiciousness, and the inauspicious receive inauspiciousness. The auspicious do not receive undue favor, the inauspicious do not incur undeserved blame—principle is impartial, and the heart is clear. I have often discussed geomancy with others, and when speaking of it, I always couple it with retribution—it is no different.

Those who oversee the earth are immortal masters, for their office is that of immortals, not of mortals. If one seeks land from mortals, why not seek immortality from mortals?
